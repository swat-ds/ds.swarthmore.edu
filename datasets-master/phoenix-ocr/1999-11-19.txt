Art proposal wins
Art proponents say space
will not exclude other groups
By Brendan Karch

Phoenix Staff

Sharpies 111 will be converted into student art space next
year, according to the results of a referendum held this week.
The proposal, put forth by the Student Art Association and
the Photo Club, edged out Swarthmore College Computing
Society's (SCCS) proposal for a 24-hour computer lab by 78
votes.

About 850 students, over sixty percent of the campus population, voted this week in balloting in Parrish Halland Sharpies
Dining Hall.
The art proposal calls for a lounge and art gallery on the
main floor of Sharpies 111, a darkroom upstairs, and storage
space or Pottery Club space in the basement.
But Brandon Silverman 'O2, the president of the Student Art
Association, stated that Sharpies 111 will not be an exclusionary space.
"We are going to do everything we can to bring everyone to
this space," said Silverman. "It's going to be something students are proud of."
The fate of Sharpies 111 quickly ballooned into a major campus-wide issue this week following controversy over the Men's
Resource Center proposal and vigorous advertising from both
SCCS and art proponents.
The campus reacted strongly to the late proposal for a 'safe
space for men,' which gathered 146 signatures to add it to
the ballot, but only received 110 votes in the first round of
voting. SCCS's proposal won in initial balloting but a runoff
was called because no group was able to garner a majority
of the votes.
Silverman quickly began what became an übiquitous campaign when he posted signs around campus promoting the vote
for art. Soon after, SCCS humorously mocked the art campaign
by placing computers in famous pictures and artworks. Then,
late Sunday night, students got out the art vote with a massive
all-campus chalking, including a giant, multi-colored promotion on the roof of Sharpies.
Both groups emphasized there was no ill-will and the advertising campaign was largely for fun. The extent to which advertising affected the campaign is questionable.
Al Bui 'O2, an SCCS system administrator, offered his own
reason for the defeat of the computer-lab proposal. "We were
trying to sell people a concept that was alien to them," he said.
Tom Stepleton 'O2, another SCCS administrator, was visibly
disappointed by the results. But he also felt optimistic about
the newly inspired campus support for Swarthmore's largest
student organization.
"The SCCS is dying to expand and we'll try to get a space
like [Sharpies lII] for years to come," said Stepleton. "If nothing else, the vote showed, since it was so close, that there's a
real demand for [our services]."
In other voting, neither of the two positions for College Judiciary Committee was filled. Patrick Hagan 'O2, Adrienne
Fowler 'O3 and Robyn Harshaw 'O3 all vied for the spots, but
voters overwhelmingly chose to abstain.

Art and SCCS supporters plastered the campus in an advertising war of epic proportions this week, alternately urging
students to plug in or to unplug, as did this creation of unknown artists, found on the steps of Parrish Hall Sunday night.

Planners settle on 2
DuPont possibilities
By Brendan Karch
Phoenix Staff
Architects will return to campus next week to present updated plans for science facilities
renovations. Two designs, designated X and Y, will be on display
for the Science Center Planning
Committeeand for students during two presentations in
Kohlberg.
The new computer-aided models are the result of two months
of review after preliminary
plans debuted this September.
Design X, an update of preliminary design E, proposes a twostory building, to be constructed
in place of the Math wing. Design Y, which combines preliminary designs C and D, calls for
substantial construction in front
of DuPont and for the demolition
of the math wing.
Both designs connect Martin
Hall, Cornell Library, and
DuPont Science Building to form
a unified L-shape structure. The
new designs also hope to incorporate a commons area between
Cornell and DuPont that will
serve a function similar to that
of Kohlberg Coffee Bar.
As part of the upcoming committee activity, students will be
able to view the design models
and hear from committee members. Two presentations, one at
9:30 p.m. on Tuesday Dec. 1 in
Kohlberg Lounge, and a second
at 12:00 p.m. the next day in the
Scheuer Room, will be open to
the public.
Despite all the upcoming planning, biology professor and committee co-chair Rachel Merz
says that no details are fixed. For
example, no one is yet sure
where the math department will

be housed when their current
home is demolished.
"We are still at the conceptual
stage," continued Merz. "We're
trying to get a general feel for
the architecture."
By the end of the semester, the
committee hopes to have narrowed down their design options
from two to one. The architects
will return with detailedplans this
spring, which will be subjected to
review by the science departments and the committee. It will
take architects a year to draw up
thefinal construction documents,
and then several more months for
construction firms to bid on the
project. Construction is slated to
begin June 2001 and will last about
three years.
Fundraising for the project,
now in its fifth month, has already yielded pledges of $lO
million. The renovation project
will cost about $43 million for
construction and another $17.5
million for infrastructure improvements and operating costs.
The college hopes to have $5O
million in construction money by
the time ground is broken on the
science renovations. The college
is confident that fundraising will
not interfere with the construction timeline, according to Merz.
The last capital campaign,
launched to raise money for
Kohlberg Hall and for renovations to Trotter Hall, netted 120
percent of its goal.
Merz also insisted the drawnout planning process is as much
about complex design decisions
as about money. Four architecturaland planning firms, including the architect behind
Kohlberg Hall, have been involved from the start to ensure
all aspects of the project conceptual, aesthetic, structural and
environmental are thoroughly
covered. And after each round
of proposals, committee members and science faculty are
given a substantial review period to address issues specific to
their interests.
For Merz, this is the only way
she could imagine such a complex project being successful
and thorough.
"Theloss of efficiency because
you have 20 people vaguely talking about something," said Merz,
"is more than made up for by articulate thinking."

SAC funding cut upheld

Student Council refused to
overturn a Student Budget
Committee decision that cut

By Drew Adams

Phoenix Staff

Those of you who leave your

rooms unlocked might want to

reconsider:

Thursday's public

safety e-mail detailed nine re-

ported residence hall thefts in
the past week, including seven

from Wharton and one each
from Dana andWillets.
Items stolen included cash, a
game system, compact disk players, a camera, jewelry and two
computers.
In at least eight of the nine
crimes, the property was unattended and in an unlocked room
or common area at the time of
the theft.
Director of public safety
Owen Redgrave cautioned
against drawing hasty conclusions regarding the perpetrators
of these crimes.
Since faculty and staff generally weren't working during the
hours the crimes were committed, they are not likely to be involved.
And while students may be to
blame, Redgrave maintained
that any conclusion is "pure conjecture" at this point.
The recent rash of theft has
produced speculation that even
more incidents occur but go unreported.
While Redgrave maintained
that "we're seeing most of the
picture, but perhaps not all of it,"
he also suggested that the mass
public safety e-mail might elicit
more reports, or at least make
students more comfortable reporting such events in the fu-

ture.

In the meantime, Redgrave
has met with Wharton RAs and
urged them to send out an email
telling students to lock their
rooms and be on the lookout for
future crimes.
When rooms are left unlocked,
there is little that can be done to
safeguard them, he said. "We
certainly are making it easy for
[thieves] if dorm doors are left
open."

Abe Pachikara, right, withdrew his Sharpies 111 petition Tuesday night.
He spoke as Student Council co-chair Matt Schwartz looked on.

Men's resource center
protested in proposal
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Abe Pachikara 'OO, author of
a petition to turn Sharpies 111
into a "house of ill repute," told
Student Council Tuesday night
that his goal was not serious but
that he wanted to protest the
addition of a Men's Resource
Center proposal to the primary
ballot last week.
"What was kind of interestthat 10
ing," he said, "was

anything on the ballot."
Pachikara referred to the
Men's Resource Center proposal, which was added to the
ballot for use of the student
space after Carey Kopeikin 'O3
gathered 146 signatures in support. The Student Council constitution requires signatures of
10 percent of the student body
to initiate a referendum.
Pachikara thought the idea
was silly and began his own petition in protest. "While I did
spend six hours gathering signatures," Pachikara told the
council, "I never intended to
bring it to you seriously."

Kwabena Adu 'Ol told his colleagues Tuesday night. Adu
appealed the decision of the
council's election committee to
not halt balloting on Sharpies
111 to add Pachikara's proposal
to the ballot as well. Adu said
that the referendum proposals
should have been treated in the
same way, and asked the members to vote on whether that decision was in error.
"We have to make sure that
this mistake is not repeated,"
he said.
But most other council members, who voted to reject his appeal, did not agree.
Schwartz defended the process for adding the MRC proposal to the ballot. "It was an
earnest proposal," he said. "It
was made in good faith."

funding for the Social Affairs
Committee's spring semester
special projects budget at its
Tuesday night meeting.
SAC had requested a total of
$9OOO in funding for the special
projects account. The budget
committee, which originally
granted $5OOO in funding for
that account, granted an additional $l5OO after SAC appealed to the committee. But
the full council, which oversees
both committees, rejected
SAC's claim that it should receive the $9OOO, which it has
received in the past.
SBC did approve an increase
to $lOOO in funding for regular
weekend events. Previously,
SAC had only $BOO to distribute for parties each weekend.
Student Budget Committee
assistant treasurer Marvin
Barron 'O2 told the council that
the SBC decision should stand
because there was not enough
money available to fund every
organization fully.
"Right now, the BC reserve
fund has about $3,000 for the
year," he said. "[At] this time
last year, we were at $14,000,
and last year we overspent by
$25,000." Barron also said that
the Halcyon will cost about
$lO,OOO more than expected
this year, which he said would
put the account in the red by
$7,000 at the end of the year.
But the SAC representative
to Student Council, Dave Thomas 'O2, said that with only
$6,500, SAC would not be able
to throw as many events in the
spring. The annual traditionsof
Spring Fling, Worthstock and
Margaritaville cost a total of

about $6,000, he said.
"If we have $6,500 for this semester, we only have $5OO in
discretionary money for 13
weeks," he said.
He said the discretionary
funds support events like Olde
Club shows, hall parties, finals
study breaks and the Willets
Homecoming barbecue.
Barron, on the other hand,
noted that approving SAC's appeal would undermine SBC's
authority, by "setting an incentive for groups to come and
appeal more often."
"I don't think that's a precedent that needs to be set," he
said.
SBC member Jared Miller
'OO said that SBC's decision to
allocate an additional $1,500 to
SAC "was a fair adjustment to
our original decision."
SBC usually sets the budget
of SAC for the entire academic
year during the previous
spring, but last semester SBC
budgeted SAC for only this fall
semester. In the wake of the
miscommunicationand controversy between SBC office staff
and SAC officials at that point,
SBC decided to set SAC's
spring 2000 budget during this
semester.

"I think it's bad if BC is
micromanaging SAC," said Student Council co-chair Matt
Schwartz 'Ol, "[but] I think it's
an even worse idea for SC to try
to micromanage BC."
Schwartz, as well as council
members Louisa WhitfieldSmith 'O2, Mike Spiegel 'O3,
Nick Attanasio 'OO, Jared
Solomon 'Ol and Brandon
Silverman 'O2 voted to uphold
SBC's decision.
Voting to overturn the decision were JordanBrackett 'Ol,
Kwabena Adu 'Ol, Rodney Morris 'Ol and Amber Adamson'Ol.
Barron abstained.

Riding on a wave of enthusiasm, the

Halcyon coeditors Linda Thai 'O2 and
Erica Kaufman 'O3 are ready to make a

the sections clearly defined and look to
give the book a degree of campus value
tor freshmen and seniors.
Appointed a little over two weeks ago,
Thai and Kaufman hope to reestablish the
of the yearbook for the entire college community. Because "Swarthmore is such a small school, you get to
toow everyone," as Kaufman noted. The
yearbook is particularly important to the
senior class, though, so Thaiand Kaufman

yearbook head honchos hired to organize staff, plan book

are working with the senior class officers to make sure that the book has the
right personality. "To have a good yearbook, it has to accurately reflect the students," said Thai. "That's why we need
campus input." In a meeting Tuesday
night with the senior class officers, issues
including picture retakes, job vacancies,
and focus of the yearbook were discussed.
Due to the late nature of the appointments, the yearbook has been at a loss to
cover some of the fall semester. "We are
going to have to rely on other sources to
gather pictures from the first quarter of
the year," Kaufman said. "We're hoping
to get photo submissions of all sorts, from
freshman orientation, to fall sports, to
candid shots." Although they intend to
make some changes in the Halcyon, the
editors promise a gradual evolution
rather than a sudden revolution in yearbook design.
The Halcyon is actively seeking people
to fill paid positions as department editors and photographers. If interested in
the positions or if you would like to give
input or submissions for this year's yearbook, ccontact either Kaufman or Thai.

Meningococcal vaccine available
Only three Swarthmore students have
contracted meningitis in past 13 years
By Marina Boevska
For The Phoenix
It is thetime of the year when
diseases are spreading rapidly
around us and we try to take all
measures to stay healthy
at
least until finals. A disease that
has been raising more and more
worries around colleges' health
centers is the meningococcal
disease. There were 26 outbreaks of the disease between
1994 and 1996 and three of them
occurred on college or university campuses. There are
around 3,000 cases every year
in the U.S., and about 10 percent
of them result in death.
Scientists are not absolutely
sure what causes the disease, but
it has been discovered that it is
very common among college students. Most susceptible to the
disease are freshmen living in
dormitories. Some of the explanations are that exposure to
smoke and "excessive alcohol
consumption" may be diseasecausing factors. Approximately
100 to 125 college students contract the disease each year, and
5 to 15 students die or suffer
from its consequences (permanent brain damage, loss of hearing, limb amputation, kidney
failure). The disease can be contracted through respiratory secretions in the air or by direct
contact with a person who has

the disease.
Meningitis is most active in
late winter and early spring.
The symptoms can often be mistaken for thoseof common flu—high fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting, lethargy. However,
the disease has to be treated immediately, since it develops extremely fast and in "six or eight
hours you can be extremely
sick," according to Worth
Health Center director Linda
Echols.
Swarthmore is one of the 200
colleges and universities that
has an educating campaign
about the disease and provides
its students with the opportunity to get a vaccine against the
disease.
Echols said that although
Swarthmore has had the vaccine option for a long time, this
is the first year she has decided
to enclose informationabout the
disease in the freshmen health
packets, since first-year students are at greatest danger of
contracting the disease. In the
past 13 years, there have been
only three cases of the disease
on campus, and none of them
were freshmen.

So far, this fall, 50 students
have gotten the vaccine and
most of them are freshmen.
Echols ordered 25 more shots
because she expects more students will decide to get the vaccine since the cold months are
approaching.
Echols believes that around 50
new students got the vaccine before they came here. Most of the
students have heard about the
disease or learned about it from
the packages they received over
the summer. Some students decided to get the vaccine over the
summer, so that they don't have
to worry about it now.
It seems that parental urging
is often the driving force behind
decisions to get the vaccine.
Mike Camilleri 'O3 said that after seeing the "20/20" special on
meningococcial disease, his
mom persuaded him to get the
vaccine. There are also those
students who are not planning
to get the vaccine unless a serious breakout occurs in the
nearby area.
The price of the vaccine,
available at Worth, is $55. According to Echols, Swarthmore
charges just the price it has to
pay to order the vaccine, not the
up to $75 charged by some other
institutions.
The vaccine is highly recommended since there have been
two cases of it already in schools
in the local area. Echols clarified that "although not a lot of
people get the disease, a lot of
the once who get it suffer from
its harsh consequences."

Abu-Jamal receives

stay of
execution, could take stand

By Christine McCluskey

Bi-Co News

The world-famous death row inmate

Mumia Abu-Jamal recently received a

stay of execution for his 1982 conviction
for killing a Philadelphia police officer,
Daniel Faulkner. He has been appealing
the decision from death row for the past
17 years.
The October 26 stay arrived within less
than two months ofAbu-Jamal's most recently scheduled execution date, December 2. At this time U.S. District Court
Judge William H. Yohn, Jr. and lawyers
for both sides of the case have begun "setting boundaries for a final appeal that
for the first time
see [Abucould
Jamal] take the witness stand," according to the Oct. 27 Philadelphia Inquirer.
This is just the most recent development in the controversial case, whichhas
stirred up action around the world both
by those who support and by those who
decry Abu-Jamal's case.
The jury convicted Abu-Jamal on what
it perceived as the strength of the
prosecution's account. Thirteen years
later, on June 1,1995, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge signed his death sentence, and his execution date was set for
Aug. 17 of that year.
The execution was delayed for three
years by the three additional post-conviction hearings requested by the defense.
After the completion of the additionalhearings on Oct. 31, 1998, the Pennsylvania
State SupremeCourt concluded, in a unanimous ruling, that Abu-Jamal was guilty.
On Oct. 13 of this year, Ridge again established a date for Abu-Jamal's execution by lethal injection, the Dec. 2 date.
Three weeks ago Yohn stayed the execution in response to Abu-Jamal's appeal.
His appeal asserts that he was served
by an inexperienced lawyer at the first
trial in 1982 and that the he was sentenced
by a biased judge, Albert F. Sabo.
Yohn will not start any new hearings
until at least March. The only issues admissible in the hearings will concern

newly discovered evidence or violations
of any "newly-defined constitutional
right" ofAbu-Jamal.
Yohn raised the possibility of having
Abu-Jamal testify under oath for the first
time in the 18-year case. At this point AbuJamal has not spoken about the crime
other than to affirm his innocence.
He has continued to address the public, however, as an activist. He taped 12
short spots for National Public Radio,
which were pulled amid protests against
putting a convicted murderer on the air.
He next wrote a book, Live from Death
Row, that has gone through several
reprintings to date.
Some believe that the white police officers, including Faulkner himself, targeted Abu-Jamal because of the fact that
he is black and because of hisradio shows,
which addressed police brutality in Philadelphia.
His frequent participation in demonstrations prior to his arrest and his membership in the Black Panther Party as a
teenager also serve, for his supporters,
as reasons as to why officers would target Abu-Jamal.
His supporters question the issue of
fairness in his trial. They say that witnesses who identifiedAbu-Jamal as the
killer later recanted and said that they
were intimidated or bribed by police.
Supporters also point to the fact that 11
black jurors were replaced before the
final jury came into formation, as well
as to the fact that Sabo has sentenced to
death more people than any other judge
in the country.
Those who maintain that Abu-Jamal is
guilty argue that Abu-Jamal's defense has
not yet brought any convincing evidence
of innocence to the case. In addition, they
say, Abu-Jamal often "acted as a guilty
man would" during his trial in 1982, disturbing the courtroom repeatedly. They
also ask why William Cook, a prime witness to the murder, has never confirmed
his brother's innocence.
Cook is no longer available for the case,
as he is presently listed as missing.

JUSTIN KANE | Phoenix Staff
Student Budget Committee assistant treasurer Laura Farra, who will take over current
SBC treasurer Josh Bess's post in the spring, takes notes during Tuesday night's Student
Council meeting.

Student Budget Committee
contemplating SAF increase
By Laura Farra
For The Phoenix
Faced with ever-increasing numbers of student groups demanding funding
and limited funding resources, Student Budget Committee (SBC) has found itself in an increasingly uncomfortable situation.
In the past year, Student Budget Committee has allocated over $290,000 to
pay for the various supplies demanded by student groups, including fliers and
dance instructors, and for the numerous events, such as speakers, hosted by
those groups. Because most of the ideas that are presented during SBC meetings are funded, SBC is facing what is coming to look like a budget crisis.
To make things worse, the capital replacement account that is set aside for
major purchases of equipment that has worn out, such as Van 16A, is on its way
to being depleted.
SBC's endowment fund, intended to be a long-term investment for the future,
is also being depleted as money is withdrawn from it to fund groups and events.
And as more and more student groups are chartered and apply for money, the
day-to-day reserve that SBC maintains for new allocations has become dangerously low.
SBC is faced with two choices: to decrease spending, or raise the Student
Activities Fee, currently $226 per student per year. If the committee chooses to
curb spending rather than raise the fee, it will have to either turn down many of
the ideas currently funded or allocate less money for each event. The other
option, raising the fee, is no more appealing to SBC.
The StudentActivities Fund (SAF), comprised of the combinedactivities fees,
is allocated to almost one hundred differentstudent groups, at last count. Though
the student activities fee has traditionally increased only to account for inflation and other small considerations, a proposed increase this year would have
to be larger in order to maintain the current level of spending. The increase
might be on the order of $2O to $25. The additional $30,000 or so in the SAF from
this increase would provide a larger cushion and allow SBC to continue supporting student groups in their endeavors while replenishing our capital replacement fund.
This decision will not be an easy one; the cost of raising student fees needs to
be balanced against the risk of fewer student activities on campus. The decision will be discussed early next semester; student input will be appreciated.
Laura Farra will replace JoshBess as Student Budget Committee Treasurer
next semester.

Curriculum changes, tenure

From CHAT, pg. 2
think we have to be realistic."
Some were concerned about the effect
of these requirements on science majors.
Students expressed concern over engineering and science majors that allow
little room in their schedules to fit in more
requirements
"I think we have to face that there's no
equity for science majors who have to
take a lot of labs," Ariss DerHovanessian
'OO said.
Most agreed that the question was central to the philosophy behind
Swarthmore's educational policy.
"It's the whole issue of what a liberal
arts education is," Whitfield-Smith said.
Keith answered, "With liberal arts you
a major
and you
try to have depth
have to have breadth. Beyond that it gets
very difficult to tell students how to map
their courses. You lose a lot the more you

constrain."
The other topic addressed at the fireside chat was procedures usedfor faculty
hiring and tenure. There are 160 tenured
positions at the college. Other faculty are
hired as replacement faculty for professors who go on leave. When faculty have
been teaching for six years, they can be
considered for tenure.
"As far as I know, every department has
students involved in the process," Keith
said. "I'dbe very unhappy to find out that
students were not involved."
Each department has different ways of
involving students in the tenure process,
but the most important factor in evaluating a professor's teaching ability is the
25 required letters written by students
who have studied with the professor.
"There is no way I could over-emphasize how important those letters are,"
Keith said. "When you look at the whole
file, it is usually very clear."

An immodest proposal
We have a proposal. We know you saw all those posters supporting the art
association made on a computer and those supporting the computer people
that had works of art in them. We know you probably voted for one or the
other of them. We know we're submitting our proposal two months late, but
we have a proposal and we think it should get on the ballot.
We want to put a television and PlayStation in Sharpies 111. We think there
should be a sexile room there, and weekly seminars on such life skills as
how to,carbon copy e-mail to administrators and write long, sarcastic ones
to the student body. Our proposal is called the Student Council Resource
Center. It will be a support group for a small minority group on this campus
a group of people who made a stupid decision a week and a half ago.
Two Tuesday nights ago, when Student Council received a shabby pile of
140 signatures in favor of creating a Men's Resource Center in the
reservable all-campus space, it should have denied the petition a space on
the primary ballot last week. While it is difficult to separate the logistics of
the proposal from its idea, one that many students find repugnant, it should
have been rejected from the beginning on purely procedural grounds.
The MRC petition, as we understand, asked the wrong question of the 146
students who signed it. "Are you in favor of a Men's Resource Center?" it
said. Not, "Are you in favor of an MRC in Sharpies III?" Not, "Are you in
favor of an MRC that would exclude the art space and SCCS proposals?"
While two weeks ago it might have looked like a good idea to approve the
proposal to meet the requirements of the council's constitution, we agree
with the Student Council members who this week said that the body had
made a "mistake." While the constitution does note, "A petition with a
number of signatures equal to 10 percent of the student body is requred to
initiate a referendum," it does not say that Student Council is required to
immediately place the referendum on a ballot already waiting to be distributed. More importantly, though, the very next sentence of the constitution
says, "The petition must clearly state the referendum resolution as it is to
appear on the referendum ballot." The petition did not contain an appropriate resolution and Student Council did not print it on the ballot as required.
The real lesson of the past two weeks is not that the vast majority of
as was clearly
Swarthmore students are against the MRC proposal
demonstrated but that a council acted against the spirit of the student
body even as it tried to follow its own constitution. That is all the more
reason, we think, for our council to act with more conviction: enforcing its
own deadlines, screening poorly-made proposals, continuing to push for
more student space, and revising its constitution to add clarity to the
referendum procedure. If, on the other hand, our council does not learn
from its mistake, the Student Council Resource Center would be the real
"house of ill repute."

Raise the activities fee
we have a budget crisis on
Sound the honker and call the Parrish dogs
our hands.
The warning signs are already out in full force. Student Budget Committee (SBC) and Social Affairs Committee (SAC) have already had their
annual monetary squabble in front of Student Council, and some groups are
finding out that SBC is being a little stingier with funds this year than last.
"So what's all the fuss about?" you may be asking yourself now. "I paid
shouldn't SBC have plenty of money?"
my Student Activities Fee
We 11... no. At some point last year, SBC decided it wanted to encourage
more student activities on campus, and it did it the one way it knew how
by being more generous with its funds. This meant that more groups were
getting more money more often. Unfortunately, due to miscommunications
and poor projections on the part of the College Budget Committee and SBC,
the Student Activities Fee did not keep pace with the spending, and now
we're seeing the consequences.
Student Budget Committee knows this, and as the time to decide next
year's fee approaches, it has a crucial decision to make: cut back spending
and keep the fee the same, or jack up the fee and keep spending at the
current pace.
For us, the decision is obvious. Most people here don't even know how
much the fee is right now, but they do know when their favorite group's
funding gets slashed. Furthermore, when you're paying over $30,000 a year,
what difference does an extra $25-30 make?
The diversity (and occasionally the quality) of student groups is part of
what makes Swat Swat, and it would be a shame to lose any of them to
budget cuts, especially at a school this wealthy.
So when it comes time to decide next year's Student Activities Fee, we
encourage you to tell SBC to support student groups and to raise the fee.
With more money to go around, student groups won't have to fight for
funding. Maybe SAC and SBC will kiss and make up. Then again, maybe not

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

SAC needs more money
To the Editor:
I'd like to see better social events here
on campus, and I'm sure you would too. I
think we'd agree that social activity here
at Swat has gotten repetitive at best, and
by junior year, justplain boring. Of course,
it would seem that money is at the root of
most things these days, and this is no exception. SAC needs funds to make the campus a more interesting place to be. So you
heard BC gave SAC more money for each
weekend next semester? True, but that only
serves to help make the pathetic party
scene here at Swat a bit more bearable every Friday and Saturday night. SAC, on its
current allotment per weekend this semester, is forced to fund mediocre parties held
at the same locations, deejayed by the same
people. Don't you wish sometimes there
would be just a little more than a single
straggly streamer hanging across Paces?
That is what theraise in funding each weekend is for. I can tell you in the last year a
week where SAC didn't have to cut down
almost every party proposal or deny funding for an event was very rare. So the new
allocation of funds for each weekendis welcomed, but SAC isn't jumping for joy, the
extra money every weekend is gone long
before it arrives next semester.
So why does SAC need Special Projects
money? Remember the ML Halloween
Party? I heard it was pretty good and I can
guarantee without Special Projects it would
not have happened as it did. You know that
huge band concert that takes place every
Spring near the end of classes at Worth?
Worthstock, I recall. (Sorry, sophomores,
SAC didn't have money for it last year either, and we had $9,000 then.) It too gets
funded from Special Projects. The International Club's Valentine's Formal and International Day—also out of SP Spring Fling,
too (sorry, we didn't have money for that last
year either). Barbecues, study breaks, game
shows, Margaritaville, you name it—most of
the funding for these events come from the
old SP subcode. This past Tuesday, Student
Council turned down the final appeal to have
SAC's Special Projects raised from $6,500.
I can't go into the budget breakdown and
why SAC thinks this isn't enough in this letter or it would become an article, but just
when you thought SAC was refreshed and
that new and exciting events were going to
emerge among the better-loved traditions,

you're going to have to deal with disappointment. Unless something changes in the price
of activities, I think my replacement next
semester will have fun balancing SAC's

checkbook.

of U.S. democracy
To the Editor:
Whilst searching for foreign news for my
home paper, the Trinity News, I encountered
yourarticle on thereferendum regarding the
Men's Resource Center. Aside from whatever
the substantive issues may be in discussion,
the very central premise of democracy is that
it represents the views of the majority. This
is often lost within colleges where public
opinion is largely governed by the concept
of political correctness, a concept near and
dear to only a minority of Americans. However, democracy and the American nation are
founded upon the very concept of majority
rule. Therefore, perhaps it would be wisest
to let the students of your college speak with
their votes.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Swat in dire need of more student space
To the Editor:
Hello, my name is Tim Gray. I am a junior currently majoring in physics. I am
an RA in Willets. I am a McCabe Scholar.
I play football. This is something I have
thought about for the last two and a half
years. I like to think that I am an open
minded, fair individual, but if I'm not, you
can discount the following on the basis
that I am an asshole.
As one of the few people I have come
in contact with at this school who doesn't
drink, I often think about what else there
is to do on this campus besides partying
on the weekend. This led me to think
about what I enjoy doing in my spare
time. I realized that I generally like to
hang out with people, friends or otherwise. The only problem with this on this
campus is the lack of space for general
"hanging out."
As a straight white male, I don't belong
to any minority group that is discriminated against in any way (unless you
count football). Don't get me wrong by
saying this, I think support groups, etc.
are great, it's just that I personally haven't
experienced this type of discrimination.
I noticed that there are only a couple
"hang out" spaces on campus—the support group spaces (BCC, IC, WRC, etc.)
and the frats. I can't belong to any of the
former, and I choose not to belong to the
latter (if in fact I could even get in). There
seems to be drive at this school to keep
separate groups separate. The recent
MRC proposal just goes to illustrate my
point. I myself find the MRC proposal a
silly idea, and I am sure that it was not
proposed for the reasons I am stating, but
it is pointing out, however childishly, the
fact that there is no space where everybody and anybody can go, without feeling out of place, and "hang out." One of
the few groups that has been left out by
this is the straight white male—maybe
that's why I've noticed this. However, I
know not all minorities choose to hang out

in their support group space; I can also
safely say that not all women hang out in
the WRC. This stresses even more the
need for an ALL student space.
This is a topic that needs to be addressed NOW. If the college wishes to
truly educate its students, there needs to
be a place where the general student can
go and meet others, both like them and
differentfrom them. (NOTE: I don't want
to hear any Game Room bullshit anybody can tell you how bad it is and that it
definitely does not qualify as an all student general space.)
I always thought it was sad that nobody
ever got off their lazy ass and did something about this for the student body, so I
have finally decided to get offof my lazy
ass and at least try to do something. I realize that it is unfair to criticize without a
proposed solution, so here they come. I
would personally like to see all of these
done, but seeing how the Student Council
and the college have acted in the past, I
wouldn't be surprised to see no action
taken at all.
1) Make the game room FREE. It is just
going to waste right now. At least try to
encourage people to make use of it.
2) I have heard rumors that there is a
completely unused faculty lounge in
Kohlberg. Unused space stupid. I have
also heard rumors that there is the possibility that this might be turned over to
students. If so, I wish it would happen

now.
3) Find some space on campus and renovate it (by this I mean put new carpeting
in, nice lighting, and maybe a couple of
computer jacks). Then, purchase a large
screen TV, get cable and a VCR, buy some
nice couches and chairs, throw in a vending machine or two, and make it a place
where people will want to go and hang out
(not study). This of course brings up the
touchy topic of space. I recently went into
Old Tarble. The basement is being used
for storage, mainly chairs. This is ridicu-

To the Editor:
Last Thursday during my English class,
one student asked the day's date.Another
classmate replied, "It's the 11th...isn't
that Veteran's Day?" Yes, it was Veteran's
Day, but a Swarthmore student would be
hard pressed to tell.
I am surprised and disappointed that
Veteran's Day (Thursday, Nov. 11) went
unrecognizedby the Swarthmore community. This national holiday, honoring veterans withmemorials and remembrance,
seems to have slipped by unnoticed. I do
not expect a day off from school, but the
lack of attention at such an "aware and
active" college was neglectful. The
American flag flew at full mast, and, to
my knowledge, not a single related lecture, discussion, or event took place. Students at ray high school criticized the
administration for hosting only one nonmandatory, morning assembly in honor
of Veteran's Day. I find it hard to believe
that the number one liberal arts school
cannot keep up with my high school's political conscience.
Veteran's Day may not be as hip or
trendy as other causes or holidays, but it
deserves more respect and recognition
than itreceived. I did not expect (or want)
the Swarthmore student body to hold
hands and sing "We are the World," but
activities related to Veteran's Day would
have been both relevant and beneficial.
Some individuals may be bothered by the
war aspect of the holiday, but such controversy would have fueled an intriguing
dialogue. Many students, faculty, and
staff may have veteran relatives, friends,
or other personal connections to wars.
Some students are currently studying the
wars and events observed by this holiday
m class. Dialogues or speakers couldhave
discussed wartime experiences—some- *'*
thing most of the current student generation has not had to experience. By disregarding Veteran's Day, we missed out on
these potentially enriching opportunities.

To the Editor:
We members of the Women's Resource
Center board would like to draw the attention of Swarthmore's female student
population to the fact that the WRC is a
resource for all women, of all ethnicities
and sexual orientations. Having said that,
the board acknowledges that sometimes
itisn't perceived as such a resource. Current board members are committed to
changing the WRC's current image as an
exclusive space where nonwhite women
students find nothing ofrelevance to their
concerns. Therefore, our upcoming elections will be dedicated to the diversification of the WRC board.
There are many reasons for womenstudents to run for a place on the board. Running the WRC is a big responsibility—board members have to deal with both
special events and everyday maintenance
of the facility. Current board members
have done everything from writing grocery lists to hosting a creative coffeehouse, from dusting the library to deciding to sponsor campus speakers. The upcoming semester promises to be exciting
as well. We're going to be planning a
Women's Retreat, continuing our extensive renovation of the library, and hosting all kinds of events and speakers, like
a car mechanics workshop, a carpentry
workshop, a lecturer on race and gender
issues, and a talk on women's athletics.

lous, since this would be a perfect space
for a student area. I'm sure that this material could be stored elsewhere on campus if not, buy or rent some sheds to put
this stuff in. I realize that the art students
use the main floor. Since the basementhas
its own entrance, it would be relatively
easy to install locks/keypads on the main
floor to bar non-art students from the studio. I also noticed that there was a room
on the second floor that was
totally
empty. Could this possibly be made into a
student reservable space for meetings
and such?
As stated before, I would like to see all
of these done. I think #3 is the best idea,
though the most expensive. The other two
would cost pennies to do. I would love to
see them all done. As I have stated before, this is something that needs to be
made available now (or at the latest, the
beginning of next semester). I know that
somewhere down the road (ten years?),
once the new dorm is built, the administration will be moved out ofParrish first
and into the old Parrish dorm rooms. It is
my understanding that Parrish first will
then be made into student space. This is
great. This is a fine approach for a building a big new dorm/renovating Parrish.
This is a bullshit approach when it comes
to student space. If these next couple of
classes are not worth the bother to come
up with an immediate solution to hold the
school over until this large Parrish/dorm
project is finished, then tell, so I can lose
all faith in this school in this area.
I hope something can be done to remedy this problem NOW. I have lodged a
complaint, and offered a workable solution that can be carried out for a relatively
small expense (considering how much we
have spent on pinball machines, free laundry, and Waylon— $7OK+?). I would hope
that you recognize the importance of this
and decide to make a difference.

Tim Gray 'Ol

point of speech
To the Editor:
The headline of the recent article
"Harvard's Wilson urges minority political alliances" (Nov. 12, pg. 1) completely
missed the point of the terrific lecture
to which it was referring. Wilson's call
to action did not simply suggest the formation of minority alliances, but rather
asked for a broad-based, multi-racial
coalition. In Wilson's opinion, this coalition would unify racial groups in order
to fight for social justice. Such an alliance would allow workers who are often
divided by race conflict or party politics
to unite behind such issues as this
nation's growing income inequality. The
coalition's strength would derive from
the values and goals that people of all
races have in common as human beings
in America.
Your misrepresentation of Wilson's
message was unfortunate for those who
were unable to attend the lecture. A message of racial unity is, I think, an important idea for a student body such as ours.
While celebrating our diversity, it may
also be to our benefit to consider what
our individual struggles have in common. Discovering our similarities can
only strengthen our ability to create
change.

Cultural
problems in
crash inquiry
The National Transportation SafetyBoard
is ready to turn over its investigation of
EgyptAir Flight 990 to the FBI, and it's important to know why. The cause of the 767's
plunge intothe Atlantic shortly after takeoff
from JFK last month has remained a mystery so far. But now American investigators
think they have found evidence of sabotage:
a phrase on the cockpit voice recorder of a
pilot entrusting his life to God, just before
the plane dove into the waters below.
What could this mean? NTSB officials believe that these were the last words of a suicidal pilot intent on bringing downthe entire
airplane with him. Gamilal-Batouti, the Egyptianrelief pilot suspected of the sabotage, was
nearing mandatory retirement age and was
never promoted
disappointed that
from co-pilot rank to captain during his career. He had made no plans for after his retirement from EgyptAir, as is customary
among airline pilots. His daughter suffered
from a serious illness, which he was often
distressed about.Batouti had a colleague take
home gifts and cash for his family rather than
carry them himself.
But there are two sides to every story.
Batouti's friends and relatives say he had
not made post-retirement plans because he
was looking forward to some time off, and
that his rank concerned him but never
greatly. Batouti's wife says that he had just
received encouraging news about his
daughter's medical prognosis before he
boarded the flight, and his son says that
Batouti frequently sent giftsand cash home
with a colleague on a separate flight. All who
knew Batoutifind it difficult to believe that
he would deliberately kill himself, let alone
bring down a jumbo jet down with him.
Of most concern, however, is Batouti's
utterance in the voice recorder moments
before the crash. The Arabic phrase,
"Tawakilt ala Allah," is translated, "I entrust myself to God," and American investigators believe the religious phrase indicated Batouti's intent to crash the plane.
But Egyptians reject this implication, saying that Americans misunderstand the
heavy use ofreligious references in Arabic.
At most, they say, the phrase carried the
same significance of an Americanpilot saying "God help me" when he noticed an engine problem. But even if there were no
problem with the plane, the statement would
not be considered unusual. Religious Muslims use that expression dozens of times a
day, when they enter rooms, turn on cars
and begin cooking dinner. As a language,
Arabic is infused withidiomatic expressions
which reflect the piety of Muslim culture.
"People of other religions say 'Jesus
Christ' or 'Oh My God,' and that does not
mean they are preparing to kill people,"
said an EgyptAir pilot.
Muslim culture also makes suicidal airline pilots an unlikely possibility. Islam forbids suicide, and Egypt has one of the lowest per-capita suicide rates in the world.
What is at issue here, unfortunately, is
a case of cultural ignorance, insensitivity and fear. Thanks to the media, Americans can easily conjure up the mental picture of a crazed Arab terrorist crashing
a jetliner into the sea in the name of Allah and Islamic Fundamentalism. Americans do not generally think of Arabs as
peaceful and their religion as anything
but a force for Holy War against the West.
But we need to reconsider these prejudices before we jump to the conclusion
that because an Egyptian pilot uttered, "I
put my faith in God," he sabotaged Flight
990 and sent 217 passengers falling to their
deaths. He may well have done so—Boeing
767's are notoriously safe—but from evidence like this? Better stick to the facts.

U.S. should

Russians on

Chechnya
matter
As Russian military forces have

surged deeper into Chechnya, Washington has searched ever more urgently for

an appropriate response. In essence, this
latest conflict has forced the United
States to weigh the issue of humanitarian rights against the issue of strategic
international concerns. With our relations with Moscow as frigid as they already are and with the lack of U.S. interest in the issue, Washington would be well
advised not to alienate the Russians over
this matter.
These are indeed turbulent times for
the Russian people. With a failing
economy, a staggering crime rate, and a
seemingly inept government, few in the
former USSR have experienced the prosperity that they had hoped democracy
wouldbring. Furthermore, there exists a
perception among many Russians that the
West, especially the United States, has
failed to do enough in easing their nation's
often painful transitionfrom socialism to
a free economy.
Several years ago, however, Russia hit
an especially low point when the armed
forces, traditionally her last bulwark
against both internal unrest and international triviality, were soundly defeated by
rebel forces in Chechnya.
Since that time, Russians have continued to bear the brunt of pressures both
domestic and external. The Kosovo War,
especially, was a sour point for many
Russians. Their government proved powerless to stop the West from conducting
a military campaign against historical
Serb neighbors. Both anti-government
and anti-Western sentiment have remained dangerously high in a troubled
Russia.
Simply put, the Russians are a people
who have endured much oflate and there
is little practical reason for Washington
to provoke them in an area as insignificant to the national interest as Chechnya
not when important arms control
agreements remain to be negotiated and

implemented.
Given its own recent war with Serbia,
one often punctuated by unintended civilian casualties and questionable objectives, the United States also appears
somewhat hypocritical in its condemnation of the Russians. They, at least, can
claim national sovereignty in their actions (Chechnya, after all, is officially
still part of Russia). Also, there is some
truth to Moscow's claim that it was provoked into this conflict by a low-level
Chechen invasion of the Russian republic of Dagestan.
The Russians, at least in their own view,
are a people due for a victory, someplace,
somewhere. If Chechnya is the arena they
have selected, then very well, let them
have it. As mentioned before, the United
States has no strategic concerns there,
and the benefits of accommodating the
Russians on this issue trivial for us, important for them may prove justifiable
indeed. In strictly practical terms,
Chechnya provides the United States with
a cheap way of currying some Russian
favor —all in exchange for allowing them
the opportunity to fight a pointless war
and, afterwards, pat themselves on the
back.

Activists have stopped seeking truth
By David Ellis and Jared Eisenstat
For The Phoenix
As we walked into Sharpies one day last
year, we were accosted by the usual students tabling. Only this time, the paper
they wanted us to sign didn't concern
signing up for the Asian Food Festival. It
didn't involve buying a t-shirt. Rather, the
issue at hand cut at the very heart of
United States policy and could affect the
health and happiness of millions of nameless faces.
We approached the table, and we were
dutifully informed what the obvious truth
was: the School of the Americas was an
evil institution, an anachronistic relic of
our Cold War past aimed solely at training terrorists to kill innocents and maintain multi-national corporations' global
hegemony. We smiled and walked past.
The student behind us wasn't so lucky.
"Oh, that sounds horrible. Where do I
sign?"
What just happened? A gullible, nonquestioning student was deliberately and
selfishly duped by members of an organization purportedly concerned with uncovering lies and half-truths of the military industrial complex.
What is the truth behind the School of
the Americas? One of us thinks he is for
the School of the Americas; one of us believes he is opposed. But neither of us has
the sheer audacity to maintain that we
know enough about the issue to a) form a
dogmatic opinion; b) believe we have
found a Platonic truth; c) try and change
a longstanding U.S. policy which affects
millions of people, most of whose situations we cannot even fathom; d) deceive
others by oversimplifying this complex
issue into a mere sound bite.
What if, upon the elimination of the
School of the Americas, Colombia's military is incompetent to the point that the
government falls to unelectedFARC guerrillas, resulting in a chaotic, widespread,
hopelessly violent civil war whereby

truth.
thousands of innocents are brutally murdered? Furthermore, what if the closing
of the School of the Americas leads to a
disturbance in the United States' ability
to effectively limit domestic drug supply,
and one of our friends gets embroiled in
drug addiction as a result?
We are not suggesting that things such
as these will happen if the School of the
Americas is closed, but that for all we
know, they could happen. And we cannot
fathom the confidence that "activists"
have in absolutely dismissing all possible
negative effects so flippantly. It is very
well possible that a few activists understand the situation fully enough to merit
such strong, narrow views. But it appears
highly unlikely that most activists have
done their homework, meaning that they
have read extensive analysis from many
viewpoints on such topics as Marxist ideology applied to Latin America, the legitimacy ofLatin America's elected officials
and the economic and moral foundations
for Latin American society. Rather, they
are extrapolating massive assumptions
about the nature of the world and human
nature from limited, biased information
provided by sources with an obvious
agenda. Would everyone in the School of
the Americas group, muchless the people
they "convinced" to sign their petition, if
given the power to single-handedly close
the School of the Americas, decide to undertake the massive risks, responsibilities and repercussions of this difficult

decision?
Our aim is not to pick on the School of
the Americas group. The reason we bring
them up as an example is due to their incredible success at bringing a culture of
activism to the forefront of our college.
Unfortunately, this culture of activism
has come at the expense of a culture of
intellectualism. We substitute quick and
easy answers for tough and complex
truths. Many of us want to go out and save
the world; but in our rush to do so, some
of us have lost sight of the fact that we
may really not know how. Such a climate
of narrow activism precludes a search for
truth, which is really the true mission of
this college.
In defense of activism, we are not condemning Martin Luther King's March on
Washington or the Gay Rights movement.
With Civil Rights, the situation was as
simple as being against discriminatory
behavior. Gay rights activists are supporting the individual's right to express their
deepest convictions and beliefs. But we
are sick of seeing signs such as those
posted last year stating, "Stop the Killing! Start the debate! End the death penalty."
While in the past activism and intellectualism were intertwined, today's "activism" bears more resemblance to a 30-second Budweiser ad than a search for truth.
The current political institutions on
campus view truth through a narrow and
warped ideological perspective. We applaud the critics who will point to the numerous errors, vagaries and inconsistencies presented in this piece, for they serve
to prove our central point: no current
venue exists for in-depth analyses aspiring to objectivity. The space provided
here was entirely inadequate to express
the complex philosophical question: When
should one act upon one's beliefs? Inplace
of our culture of activism, we propose a
forum for seeking truth. In the words of
Warren Beatty, "Stay tuned. We'll be back
after this message."

Swarthmore should offer free laundry

At this point,

It's a common cause of panic for the
residents of Willets, and I wouldn't be
surprised if the same problem exists in
all other dorms. It makes an already disturbing situationfor most students all the
more painful. Put yourself in this typical
Swarthmore laundry-doer's position.
It is a dark and harrowing day
you
have been relegated to wearing rubber
scuba gear, a hot pink jumpsuit or—even
worse
an Amherst shirt. You scuffle
down to the laundry machines with a
mountain of laundry that seems as if it
will topple at any moment. You overfill
three washing machines with your dirty
laundry. Just before you close the lid, you
remember to throw in that extra detergent for all those pizza and beer stains.
The lid shuts, and you take out your
stack of quarters only to realize, to your
horror, that the quarter slots are stuck
all of them. You can't do your laundry. You
are going to have to wait until they fix
those damned quarter slots again.

fum-

ing anger towards two sources. You could
march down the halls, searching the halls
for the idiot who tried to put pesos in the
washing machine again, for the umpteenth time. (Hey that's understandable,
I've been there myself.) Or you could realize that even though he's a dope-head,
there's a bigger issue that needs to be
dealt with.
There's a way to circumvent this whole
broken washing machine problem, and it
should have been done a long time ago. If
we didn't have to put those god-awful
quarters in the machines in the first place,
they wouldn'tbreak.
I've seen a lot of broken washing machines in my first couple months at this
prestigious college, only one of which has
had a mechanical error that wasn't associated with a jammed coin slot. Logical
deduction reasons that if we get rid of the
coin slots, we get rid of most of the problems with broken washing machines.
There is no reason Swarthmore stu-

dents should have to pay an extra couple
hundred dollars each year to do their
laundry. We already pay over $32,000 a
year to live, study and eat here it seems
that the washing machines are a part of
room and board. I don't have the numbers,
but I know it also costs the college a good
deal of money to have the washing machines constantly fixed.
Anyway, making students pay 75 cents
per wash cycle and a dollarfor clothes that
never seem to fully dry doesn't make for
cheerful campers or encourage good hygiene. It would be a nice gesture if the college could take the price off washing the
students' clothes. Bryn Mawr does so, and
the students really seem to like the policy.
Swarthmore could kill two birds with
one stone. The college would be contributing to a cleaner student body, which
(without the aid of compelling scientific
studies by my side) makes for happier
students. More importantly though, it
would stop that guy withthe roll of pesos
from breaking the laundry machines,
thus making laundry day just a little less
bleak.

GUEST EDITORIAL

Sports teams should not broadcast prayer
Staff Editorial
Brown Daily Herald (Brown University)
The U.S. Supreme Court
(U-WIRE)
has elected to embroil itself once more
in the debate regarding the separation of
church and state.
Specifically, the court agreed on Monday to grapple with the role of school
prayer, after a Galveston County, Texas,
school board appealed a lower-court ruling.
Galveston County would like to perpetuate a practice that can only be viewed
as constitutionally questionable allowing students to broadcast prayer over stadium public address systems prior to public high school football games.
The separation of church and state as

it relates to public schools has been delineated time and again, but the Court
must now remind the nation of its clear
stance on this issue.
Due to Court rulings, students are no
longer required to partake in formalized
prayer of any fashion.
Proponents for the Galveston cause will
argue that because students, not teachers, are leading the prayer at the football
games, then the prayer is acceptable.
The prayer, they say, comes not from
faculty initiative or from any formal dictate, and thus the statements of religiosity impinge in no way on the secular freedoms upon which the nation was built.
But by projecting prayer across a loudspeaker, the school district violates the
dictates of separation. Members of the

crowd, given no option but to sit through

the prayer, must listen to it as attentively
as if they were in their classrooms.
These students should not have to cover
their ears or leave their seats to avoid
religious messages they may not wish to
receive.
If students wish to engage in prayer
prior to kickoff, it is completely within
their right to do so as long as they establish purely elective groups that do not
force others to listen or participate, even

passively.
The Supreme Court should uphold the
lower-court ruling and maintain the strict
separation between churchand state. If it
doesn't, Americans may find themselves
on a dangerous course, overturning Constitutional precedent and common sense.

Debt:

Should debtor nations
be held accountable?

THE DEMOCRATS

Debt only serves to
maintain poverty

Foreign debt is It's so hard
taxpayer money to 'keep it
real'

By David Thomas
For The Phoenix

Currently, Africa spends four times more on debt service than on health
care. Latin American countries collectively owe foreign nations and governments 36 percent of their GNP, while the Sub-Saharan Africa owes 83
percent. This is clearly a crisis situation, for these are the countries that
most need to be investing in their infrastructure and their citizens ifthey
are ever to reach a place where their economies can pull their people out
of poverty.
In this way, the debt burden keeps poor nations poor. The product of the
labor of the people, instead of improving their own situation, is taxed away
from them and sent to a foreign power to service debts that can never be
repaid. Their debt must be forgiven unconditionally, and a procedure must
be created to deal responsibly with highly-indebted countries in the fu-

I want to begin this week's column on a purely
personal note. If I ever lend you money, I expect that
money back. If you borrow $lO from me to buy a
book for class, I would hope you would pay me back.
However, I suppose that if you run into a financial
crisis, you could pay me back later, or maybe, if we
were really close, just forget about the whole thing.
But, if I lent you someone else's money, then you
had definitely betterpay me back. Or, I would at least
ask them if it was okay that you were not going to
pay themback. I certainly wouldn't just let you keep
the money without consulting them.
Funny how common sense never seems to quite
work out in foreign policy. The Clinton administration has decided, unilaterally, to go ahead and forgive the debt owed the U.S. by 36 Third World countries. Those countries feel that when they borrowed
money from us, or the IMF, that they didn't really
know what they were getting into, so to help them
out, we just won't make thempay us back.
While that is fine, in theory, remember that the U.S.
Government has no money ofits own. It doesn'tmake a
profit. So when the government lends other countries
money, it is lending themyour money. Now, withoutasking, it is essentially going to justgive that money away.
It is not that I have a problem with giving money
to people who are in financial difficulty. (Well, maybe
just a little.) But before we go throwing money at
other countries, why not start here at home? After
all, isn't it our government? Every year, thousands
of low-income students graduate with college debt
that they have real difficulty paying off. Why not
have the government forgive their debt?Low-income
families max out credit cards, or take out mortgages
on their home (if they have one) simply so they can
feed their families. Why not forgive their debt?
If we are going to lend foreign countries money,
then forgive their debt, why don't we just be honest,
and call it foreign aid? After all, isn't that what we
are doing anyway?
So you see, it is not that Republicans have a problem with the idea of forgiving debt. It is just that if
we are going to help out people in financial need,
maybe we ought to start here at home. Shouldn't a
government look out for its own citizens first?

The vast majority of this outstanding debt was run up by leaders who
were not elected by the people on whose backs it has been laid. Rather,
these despots took out huge loans from First World banks to line their own
pockets and to conduct military operations, often at the behest of theFirst
World governments and Wall Street. These banks made many loans that
were extremely risky, knowing that nation-states are not allowed to go
bankrupt and that the U.S. Government would bail them out anyway. This
is exactly what happened, and when Washington bailed out these banks,
the government took possession of the debts.
When these dictators fell, the U.S. government then went to the new
regimes and demanded payment. The new governments, who had had no
role in creating the debts, have been forced to pay them. However, for
many countries, there was already a lack of capital, and they were forced
to apply for further loans from the IMF and the World Bank.
These loans came with requirements that the borrowing governments
strip away virtually all social spending, including health and education, in
order to service these debts. Currently, these debts are driving a billion of
the world'speople further and furtherinto poverty. As Dr. Adabayo Adedeji,
of the African Center for Development Strategy in Nigeria said, "Debt is
tearing down schools, clinics and hospitals and the effects are no less devastating than war."
The argument that debt forgiveness will make countries in the future
less careful about running up debts, therefore, falls down on this reality:
the current debt load of the world's poorest nations is not the result of
normal mismanagement under fairrules ofinternationalfinance. The debt
loads are the result of a specific historical situation which has passed,
leaving devastating consequences.
Therefore it is our historic duty to immediately forgive all debt to the
world's most impoverished and to construct a system of bankruptcy for
countries so that banks will not make irresponsible loans. We must not
allow thepoor people of today to suffer at the hands of the plutocrats and
tyrants of yesterday.

Ritalin doesn't let kids just be kids
By Nikolaus Olsen
Rocky Mountain Collegian
Colorado State University
(U-WIRE)
I'm lucky I got out of the
public school system when I did. You see,
I was (and in some ways, still am) an onry
spaz of a kid. I had a hard time concentrating in school, and spent most of my
time horsing around instead of doing my

classwork.

When I was in elementary school, my
teachers dealt with my hyperactivity by
assigning me projects that interested me.
If I were a hyperactive grade school student today, teachers would only have to
give me a pill.
Ritalin
the wonder drug that helps
kids pay attention, has quickly become the
way to control a kid who just can't seem to
sit still. The problem is when kids take
Ritalin, just sitting there is all they do.
Ritalin is stimulant. It stimulates the
body so much, it becomes over stimulated, leaving the mind aloof (biology
majors please forgive me for this simplified explanation). When someone has
headaches, they take aspirin to relieve the
Pain, but it doesn't always fix the cause
of the headaches. The argument with
Ritalin is that it is overprescribed to children who merely don'tpay attention very
well.

halfyears when I was in high school. Five
days a week I supervised Ist through 6th
graders after school and during vacations. During my child care tenure I saw
differenttypes of kids that reflected different types of parenting decisions.
A small fraction of the class was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder. Of
those five kids, one was so hyper he
couldn't pay attention without Ritalin.
Two had the ability to control themselves
if they had to, but were put on Ritalin so
they could do better in school. The other
two had been diagnosed with ADD, but
their parents chose to not administer
them with daily medication.
Of the kids with ADD in the class, all
who took the medication were very selfconscious. They didn't want other children in the class to know they had to take
Ritalin. I would ask them why, usually
getting littleto no response One child told
me it made him feel different from everyone else to have to take something to
concentrate. Of course, even looking different is detrimental at that age.
By far, the most compelling testimony
I've heard about Ritalin is from the child
who had to take it to pay attention. This
kid was not taking medication during the
summer, so I had a better chance to interact with him then. He was hyper and obnoxious, but so is every ten year old. I
would see him during the summer, always

asking questions, running around on the
playground and playing with classmates
—until August. That's when the medication started. Almost overnight, the wiry,
obnoxious kid I had watched all summer
would go silent. No more questions, apathy on the playground, quiet around other
students.
I asked him why he was acting differently. "Don't know," he'd say. His eyes
would be bloodshot and glassy, and he was
always staring off into the distance.
One day he told me he was trying to
behave better so he wouldn'thave to come
to day care after school and wouldn't have
to take Ritalin anymore. After a few
months of trying, he was off Ritalin and
had learn to control himself. He found
sports were a great asset in relieving extra energy.
Ritalin reduces behavioral problems
for six weeks or so, but does nothing to
improve long term behavior.
It's hard to sit there and look at a child
who is so drugged up, he can't be obnoxious. Unless a child is going to take Ritalin
all of their life, they must be taught to
control themselves. Taking psychiatric
medication as a child may cause more
problems in the long run.
What's more important, making a kid
sit still in their 4th grade class, or providing a positive mental picture of themselves though the rest of their education?

Funny. After reading Matt Schwartz's
corrections ("Gangster, Compton labels
wrong" Nov. 12) of my last article ("Pop
music aids cultural, family bonding for
immigrant," Nov. 5), I wanted to react to
it but didn't know how.
I toyed with thinking I wasn't "keepin'
it real" for not respecting hip-hop
enough to check facts. Then, thanks to
introspection and a wise textual analysis from Supriya Kota I remembered
why I detailed my musical influences.
While it is important to know the historical errors, I urge you to read my last
article as a recollection of the perceptions that I had at the time of encountering the music.
Most of the music I listed was released around 1988. I was in the fifth
grade! Then, I understood all my
brother's rap as "gangster." While writing the last article, the present Jenny
did know that Egyptian Lover was not
"gangster" but I still felt like I was telling the right story. At 10 years old I
wasn't that keen on getting the music
classifications right.
I have been trying to gain a deeper understanding of my musical influences.
Part of this has been my trying to make
sense of lyrics locked in the "Random"
Vault of my mind. Even prior to
Schwartz's corrections, the present, more
politically-conscious, and slightly PublicEnemy-educated Jenny has made some
meaning out of why Chuck D "got a letter from the President, the other day" and
that "the rhythm, the rebel" is not just
something that "sounds cool." (Note: Just
purchased the "Yo! Bum Rush the Show"
and "It Takes a Nation of Millions" and
plan to scour them for the song with the
"President" lyrics. Anyone know what
song this is?)
A little explanation is also in order for
making the "mistake" of calling my
brother's utterance of "I left my wallet
in El Segundo!" in front of our refrigerator as "Compton-style." At that time, I
never thought to ask my brother about
the origin of those lyrics. I was just letting myself be amused because El
Segundo was right next to where we
lived, (Torrance, Calif.) and it was cool
to think that he was probably saying the
lyrics of an actual popular song. It was
like seeing your full name in print or
hearing it on the radio.
Also, I thought all the rap my brother
had was from Compton (he had many
Eazy-E, NWA and other explicitly
"Compton" artists) and that his imitation
would be too. Not having heard the actual song, my perception relied on my
brother's rendition and an understanding
of my brother's rap tastes.
Not having spoken to Supriya, she understood my "mistakes." Her words from
an e-mail best summarize this situation:
"The 'mistakes' are a subtle way of textually incorporating the narrator's consciousness
a way of showing how this
music, though it may have 'come from'
Queens, also belongs to [a] southern
California[n]. if we consider the importance here of perception, rather than of
historical fact, then perhaps we can begin to see how the 'mistakes' in the text
lead to richer meaning."
I could've called Schwartz's corrections
hip-hop intellectual snobbery, but I won't.
Not only am I recreating my history for
the sense of a present identity, the present
Jenny is trying to aspire to an intellectual understanding of my musical tastes.
I wouldn't want to be called a hip-hop
snob.

Turning west on 35th Street, the crowd sings. Crossing Third
Avenue, they receive for the first time a cacophony of honking
horns, drivers cheering them on. Further down the street, a
woman stands clapping at the front door of a brownstone.

march of their lives
By David King
Phoenix Staff
For 31 days last month, several
hundred people marched between Washington, D.C., and
New York City to protest what
they see as worldwide economic
human rights violations. As the
group descended upon the
UnitedNations in Manhattan, 11
Swarthmore students walked
among them.For all, it was a day
long anticipated.
A bright sun hovers over Dag
Hammerskjold plaza in New
York City. It's late morning on
Nov. 1, and a lull can be felt on
the wide swath of pavement directly across from the United
Nations. A handful of men and
women move about tables lined
with snack foods and drink
bottles. Others, mostly collegeaged, sit clustered on the ground
and on benches, their facial expressions nondescript.

Suddenly, a noise takes form
in the distance. A procession of
packed bodies led by police officers files slowly down the
block. Several in front carry a
banner reading "March of the
Americas"; a number hold flags.
A faint jumble of excited murmurs grows louder as the group
draws near.
"Do you know what's across
the street?" exclaims a woman
over a megaphone, as the mass
assembles on the plaza.
"Yeah," shouts the jubilant
crowd, erupting in cheers.
"Where did we march from?"
she cries out.
"Washington, D.C."
And so culminates the March
of the Americas. Organized by
the Kensington Welfare Rights
Union (KWRU), an organization
in North Philadelphia that works
with poor and homeless people,
the march began in front of the
White House and ends today in
Manhattan.
As much symbolic as purposeful, the aptly-titled event has

served to bring publicity to the
plight of economically disadvantaged people in Northand South
America. On this, the final day,
marchers will officially file a legal brief against the United
States for violating the U.N.'s
UniversalDeclaration ofHuman
Rights.
The crowd today, made up of
poor and homeless people and
supporters from a variety of
backgrounds, numbers roughly
400. Only about 75 have marched
the entire way; the rest, like
many others in the past month,
have walked only a portion of the

route.
Among the latter are 11
Swarthmore students. Empty
the Shelters (ETS), a student
group whose goal is to work to-

wards ending poverty, has devoted most of its time since the
beginning of the semester to
bringing students to the march.
No student has marched the entire way, but several ETS members have walked more than
once over the course of the
month.
Perhaps the most devoted participant has been Sarah
Scheckter 'OO.
The president of ETS, her
frizzy hair pulled up into a bun
and a sweatshirt tied around her
waist, stands at the perimeter of
the pedestian plaza. She has
marched for the past five days—her fourth time walking in the
month leaving Swarthmore on
Thursday morning to join the
group in Newark, New Jersey,
and spending last night in a
church near Columbia University. Her facebears an introspective look now, as her eyes
thoughtfully scan the crowd.
"We've had a really good reception today marching along
the streets," she says.
It would seem so. Excitement
fills the eclectic crowd, which
comprises a mix of ethnicities
and ages. Many have on black Tshirts with the words, "Poor

People's Human Rights Campaign." Some carry signs, with
slogans like "Why Are People
Homeless In A Land Of Plenty"
and "No interpreters NO
PEACE." Still others wear mesh
orange vests, members of the
marchers' own security force.
Beyond a line of nearby police
horses, men in crisp suits stand
stolidly, their eyes focused on the
ralliers. Passers-by heading up
First Avenue turn their heads
curiously, occasionally stopping.
Lindsey Newbold 'O2 joins a
growing line by the food tables.
Newbold has marched for the
past four days and is excited
about arriving at the United Nations, remarking on the large
number of students around her.
The marchers have become a
tight-knit community, she says,
despite theirincreased numbers
in the last couple of days.
After a quick lunch that includes sandwiches, snack bars,
and breadsticks, the marchers
assemble again. Ten minutes before noon, they begin a crosstown walk to a church on East
35th Street, where they will convene for a final rally.
Their 16-block trek through
midtown resembles a parade.
Police hold traffic at intersections, and motorists and pedestrians alike wait for the snaking
line of people, who walk one to
four abreast. Before arriving in
New York, the marchers walked
on the streets (they took over the
eastbound lanes on one level of
the George Washington Bridge),
but New York City police have
instructed them to keep to the
sidewalks, and walk alongside
them now as they do.
"A lot of police have been really nice," comments Newbold,
as she heads with Nina Schichor
'O2 down Second Avenue. "Some
haven't. For the most part,
people we see on the street are
really supportive." But some,
she adds, have yelled "Get a job."
Turning west on 35th Street,
the crowd sings. Crossing Third
Avenue, they receive for the
first time a cacophony of
honking horns, drivers cheering
them on. Further down the
street, a woman stands clapping
at the front door of a brownstone.
One officer by a police van can
be seen wearing a slight smile.
Arriving at the Community
Church ofNew York, the marchers filterinto a three-story-high,

red brick sanctuary. Newbold
takes a seat towards the back,
near Dann Naseemullah 'O2.
Scheckter, who has been filming
a documentary about the march,
positions herself at the front of
the room with her video camera.
A dozen or so flags— images of
a cross, star of David, Yingyang— drape down over the
crowd, which nearly fills the
pews.
The activities kick off with
Freda, a 60-ish Haitian woman
who has marched all the way
from D.C. She sings a song in
Creole, slowly and with devout
concentration, her voice at times
giving out. There is emphatic
applause. Three women from
Quebec then sing a song about
liberty, followed by another
woman who introduces Cheri
Honkala.
The Director of KWRU takes
the stage to a standing ovation.
"Argentina," she offers the
crowd, slowly enunciating the
word.
"Presente," comes the response.
"Bolivia," she continues.
"Presente."
"The United States of

She continues on, finally ending with, "The entire world."
"Presente."
Relatively few in the crowd
have marched for the whole
month; the march was 350 miles
and walkers passed through five
states. Among them, they speak
11 languages and represent
Canada, the United States and
Latin America.
"We are truly making theroad
by walking," declares Honkala.
An eclectic succession of figures follows her on stage. Three
people read articles from the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. A French-speaking
woman relays through an interpreter her experiences in Quebec. Wyclef Jean, whose recorded music has inspired the
marchers from the back of a
truck, strums on his guitar, "We
Shall
and
Overcome"
"Guantanamera," as a standing
audience claps and sings along.
Tony Mazzochi, national organizer of theLabor Party; Patricia
Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women;
a woman from Ohio with the
Deaf Community on Human Universal Rights. Each is received

enthusiastically.
But by 2:45 p.m., the crowd has
thinned. Bodies slip out after
each speaker, and those that remain appear weary. Somberness
fills the room as a young man
leads a prayer and soft chants of
"Hallelujah." Excitement then
returns with a final, communal
song.

"Well, I
rich man's house, and I
took
back what he stole from me."
The crowd, reinvigorated,
swings to the lyrics, arms raised
in the air. The voices resonate
louder than they have all afternoon, resounding strongly
through the chapel over several
refrains.
Then, with a last burst of energy: "Ain't no system gonna
walk all over me."
Outside, the sun has faded
some. Sleeping bags and backpacks line the wall of the church,
five deep in places. A flatbed
truck parked at the curb holds a
sign reading "Day 32"; on the
ground nearby he cardboard cutouts of people painted a variety
of colors.
As the crowd trickles from the
building, the enthusiasm of just
a few hours ago has been replaced by a disorientation of
sorts. A voice blares from a
megaphone, but to no one in particular. College students sift
through the dense pile of bags.
Clusters have formed withinthe
crowd, and the sound of amiable
chatter
in English, in Spanish
fills the cool, autumn air.
In all, more than a dozen
Swarthmore students have attended the March of the Americas. Most have made it to the
church today. Now, they, like others in the crowd, make plans to
get back home.

manages to say, fumbling for the

'Arcadia'
Order and chaos rule Osborne's
board

Energetic cast, elaborate set make semester's first drama

presentatiton

successful

By Mimi Hanaoka
Phoenix Staff
Armed with a $2OOO budget, an energetic cast and an elaborate set, Catherine Osborne 'Ol successfully directed Tom

wham, bam,
thank you ma'am

Black Dice has the reputation of putshow, often attacking
the audience and leaving people with
welts and bragging rights. I wanted a survivor story too, so I went to Black Dice's
encore show last Friday night at Olde
Club. Once again, Black Dice played for
all of four minutes, maybe five, half the
length of their 7" LP.
The first time Black Dice played at
Olde Club, I got to the concert late but
didn't realize it. The lead singer was
writhing on the floor and deliberately
bumping people and getting beer poured
on his head. And then it was over.
I guess a Black Dice show is only ever
a finale. There is no low point, just a constant high, almost unbearable and a little
one long climax. Most shows
scary
start out a little slow; that one person in
the front doing the head-bobbing thing.
A couple of songs in, and then the band,
if they're good at playing live, somehow
coaxes more of the audience into losing
all inhibitions. The people dance, the too
cool set stands back and makes snide
comments, and it all ends in this frenzy
of disorder that makes me look a little
flushed.
Black Dice doesn't give you that adjustment time. My roommate had a different
vision of this column. In the spirit of Black
Dice, she thinks this column should have
read, in its entirety:
Fuck you all. Good night.
There is no getting-to-know-you period
with Black Dice, just a wham, bam, thank
you ma'am set that forces you to submerge yourself immediately into the
show.
Maybe I'm not punk rock enough, but I
was frightened. It was dark, for one, and
I'm scared of the dark. It was also unpredictable, as if any second the guy might
jump up and start biting my arm. The
band deserves every cent it makes, because in one Black Dice set is the condensed energy and frenzy of almost any
other band's hour-long show. Actually, the
Black Dice experience, though concise,
is not accurately condensed into an expletive. Maybe a few, if they're heartfelt,
because a Black Dice show isn't at all
jaded or detached.
On Friday night, Black Dice played in
the basement ofOlde Club. First the lights
went out. I don'tknow if that was a choreographed thing or just a coincidental,
cosmic occurrence, but then both the upstairs lights and camera bulbs continued
to randomly flash throughout the show,
adding to the unsettling disarray with
momentary blindness.
There was a semi-circle of space
cleared out in front of the band, which
was filled by people going through the
beginning motions of moshing. I felt a
push, some girl scurried to the other side
of me, and then there was this great succession offlashes in which it seemed like
people were moving towards a collision
that never happened. It was like when the
slow-down on your computer is broken
when you're playing a fighting game.
Chun Li jumps towards Guile in choppy
animation, her leg extended for an unfluid
half-second, and then you see Guile unleash a sonic boom, you predict the collision, and then they both miss.
The room was throbbing, I had the
metal images of corn silos imploding and
floating Elizabeth Taylor devil heads, but
no
1 hadn't been physically hurt
bruises, no scars, no proof or evidence as
to the intensity of the show.
Black Dice is a three-member band
from Brooklyn, and last Friday's blow-out
was the final Olde Club show of the seting on a physical

mester.

Black Dice's show:

Stoppard's "Arcadia" this past weekend.
The philosophical basis of the play is, in the words of one of
the characters, that "the only thing going wrong [in the universe]
is people fancying people who aren't supposed to be in that part
of the plan," and the play attempts to trace, both physically and
figuratively, the chaotic path of bodies in motion. Osborne, with
the help of dramaturgist Heather Weidner 'OO, created a production that effectively communicated the spirit of the play.
The lone senior in the cast, Andrew Bryce delivered a solid
performance as Septimus Hodge, playing skillfully opposite
Mara Gustafson 'O3, who made her debutas Thomasina Coverly.
While many of her lines were lost due to insufficient projection, Gustaf son was convincingly pert in her portrayal of the
precious genius Thomasina.
Perry Grossman 'O3, in the role of Bernard Nightingale, contributed to the show with his indefatigable energy and confidence. Grossman interacted well with the other actors, a talent
which was particularly evident in his comic interactions with
Laura Seeley 'Ol, who delivered a convincing portrayal of frigid
academic Hannah Jarvis.
In one of the most promising debuts of the freshman class, Chris
Keary 'O3 flaunted his great comic timing in his role as Valentine
Coverly. Keary, with his finely calibrated speech, entertaining facial expressions and consistenteye contact with other actors, created a charmingly funny and intelligent character.
Lady Croom, played by Laura Wolfram 'O2, was poised, elegant, and engaging the creative inflections in the tenor of
Wolfram's voice, coupled with her clear projection and perfectly
metered speech, made her character one of most credible and
natural in the production.
Laura Louison 'O2 landed the role of a hoyden, Chloe Coverly,
and delivered an appropriately bold and coquettish performance.
Ezra Chater, played by Brett Klukan 'O3, could not seem to
decide where he was from, and his accent wavered between
English, American, and at times a very perplexing Scottish.
Klukan's energy, however, compensated for any indecisiveness
in choosing his accent, and he interacted well with Captain Brice,
played by an entertaining Tom Stepleton 'O2.
Blair Cochran 'O3, double cast as Gus Coverly and Lord
Augustus Coverly, was charmingly and appropriately awkward
in both roles, almost too much so in the case of the latter.
David January 'O3 played the butler, Jellaby, with the composure and decorumbefitting an early-19th-centuryEnglish servant,
and JumatatuPoe 'O3 played the supporting role ofRichard Noakes.
The set, comprised of the a second floor landing and a staircase which lead down into the study where most of the activity
took place, was elaborate and attractive. Designed by Pat
Thrasher 'Ol, the wooden set was adorned with the detailsrequisite in a stately English country house, including elegant curtains, period books, and lamps; the only inexplicable touch was
the ivy wrapped around the staircase which, while evocative of
a theme, was utterly inappropriate to the set. The thrust stage
created a cozy atmosphere by bringing the audience closer to
the actors and by creating the impression that the actors were
truly in a room in a stately Derbyshire country house and not
on the LPAC mainstage.
Hannah Schneider 'OO designed the costumes which, with the
exception of a couple of anachronistic costumes, were attractive and appropriate.
Much of the lighting, designed by Adrienne Aiona 'OO, was
unexciting but unobtrusive. The evening scene, however, was
unjustifiably and distractingly dark.
The different facets of Osborne's "Arcadia" the gorgeous
set, the ensemble of talented actors, the fluent, melodious piano played at appropriate junctures by Kristin Chadderton 'Ol
coalesced to create what Stoppard would call the gentle music of orderand clarity in a world of the frazzled noise ofchaos.

Above, Chloe Coverly (Laura Lewison) stares longingly at Bernard
Nightingale (Perry Grossman), bottom center, as he convinces

Hannah Jarvis (Laura Seeley) and Valentine Coverly (Chris Keary)
that Lord Byron fought a duel with Ezra Chater.

Stott winner's 'Double' headlines concert
By Nick Goodness
Phoenix Staff
Nicholas Brooke, winner of the inaugural Gilmore and Mary Stott music commissioning competition, will have his latest work "Double" featured in the Orchestra 2001 concert in Lang Concert Hall on
Saturday at 3 p.m.
In "Double," Brooke aligns influences
of the past century and symbolically
views them through the stacked lenses of
a 19th-century double magic lantern.
Known as Brooke's Y2K piece, "Double"
draws upon his studies of mechanical and
Balinese music to create a textured sound
unique to the piece. Movements for the
piece are based upon musical technology
from the turn of the century.
"A lot ofmy research at Princeton deals
with mechanical music like player pianos
and other self-playing instruments,"
Brooke said, "so I often incorporate references to that in what I write."
To add to the imagery, during the concert slides will be cast through a lantern
which will in turn project the images
against the walls, as was popular during

the turn of the century.
Brooke is apast recipient of the ASCAP
Young Composer's Award and a
MacDowell Colony Fellowship. A graduate student in music at Princeton, he completed an intensive application process
that drew many compelling nominees.
"Most orchestras only program one, or
at most two, contemporary pieces by living composers on every program, and a
lot of these spaces are won out by established new composers," Brooke said. "So
orchestral commissions, even readings,
are hard to come by."
Established by Eugene Lang '3B, the
Stott music fund is designed to commemorate the generosity of Gilmoreand
Mary Stott by affording promising composers the opportunity to have commissioned work performed by professional
orchestra. Through this program, the
College is offering a $5,000 commission
each year for an original work by an upand-coming composer.
Gilmore Stott, for whom the scholarship is named, is a long-time Swarthmore
administrator. He has served Swarthmore in a number of capacities, includ-

ing registrar, assistant provost and professor of philosophy. He is currently the
Assistant Dean for Awards and Fellowships.
Under the direction of James Freeman,
Orcestra 2001 will also be presenting
"Time and the Bell" by Gerald Levinson,
a piece premiered last year by the group.
Since then, Levinson has won the Arthur
Honegger Prize in 1999. The final piece
on the bill is Mozart's Violin Concerto in
A Major, which will be performed by Erez
Ofer, former concert master of the Philadelphia Orchestra.

"The Messenger: Joan of Arc" bastardizes legend

A little girl when I first heardof Joan of Arc, thispowerful, young woman who, empowered by God and His
Holy Spirit, led the French to great victory by following
her heart and instincts instead of doing as she was told,
I was fascinated with this wonderful woman.
She was exactly as I hoped to be. Playing with my
brothers, I was Joan and they the British soldiers. I
would slay and overpower them. Staging each triumph
for France, I felt a personal victory for womankind.This
forceful feminine figure intrigued me so much that I
didn't think twice about seeing director Luc Bessen's
latest film.
Perhaps I should have foreseen the bastardization.
American filmmakers transform historically powerful
figures into pathetic, groveling dramatists all the time.
Why shouldn't a French director do the same?
It's possible that I expected too much, that I wanted
more from Milla Jovovich's character (though I can't
think of an actress who would'vebeen a better aggressive heroine). Still, I was disappointed in the film's ultimate portrayal of Joan of Arc as a more of schizy teen
than a saint.
The movie began in an appropriately medieval manner, with parchment maps filling the screen, slowly be-

ing immersed in blood. However, as soon as more than
three of the characters opened their mouths, the medievaleffect and realism of the film rapidly disintegrated.
The accents were intermittent at best and the dialogue
was over-modernized.

Suddenly, she is overwhelmed by a strange wind and
the first of many otherworldly visions. She finds a sword
in the grass and, believing it to be a sign from Heaven,
rushes (never mind that the sword is probably as least
half as heavy as she) home to find her village in flames,

Joan's older sister shoves her into a closet for hiding,
from which she, and, unfortunately, the audience, witness her sister's violent, ultra-graphic death and rape

From here, the movie flashes several years forward.
Joan is 17 and speaking to Dauphin Charles VII (John
Malkovich) who was convinced by his mother-in-law
(Faye Dunaway) to hear the girl out. Having coerced
the Dauphin into allowing her to join his army, Joan
heads off to battle. Thus begin the scenes that might
have made the movie, if not for their blatant, but failed

she's hard as
A hockey player meets a prima donna figure skater. You know the kind
nails on the outside, but soft and sensitive on the inside. Predictably they fall in love. The
End. A cutesy film that should appeal to the socially conscious middle-schooler in us all.

An 1981 Indiana Jones classic. A good time is had by all when Steven Spielberg, John
Williams and George Lucas combine their talents to provide the ultimate swashbuckling
cliff-hanger.Thoroughly entertaining.

"House on Haunted Hill"
R. 115 minutes.
Starring Geoffrey Rush, Peter Gallagher and Lisa Loeb.

10:20

Supposedly a horror story about the illicit, unexplained deaths that occurred in a 1950's
psychiatric unit and the ghosts that haunt the remaining building, this movie is much more
gruesome than frightening. If you're in the mood for a true sense of terror with the
added bonus of a possibly plausible storyline, try "The Bone Collector" instead.

"Anywhere But Here"
PG-13. 113 minutes.
Starring Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Hart Bochner
and Shawn Hatosy.

7:10,9:45

Fleeing small-town boredom, a restless mother drags her reluctant daughter to Beverly
Hills. Adjusting to their new environs and ever-changing relationship, they finally reach an
understanding as the daughter prepares to leave for college. Director Wayne Wang
effectively brings credible, intelligent female characters to the screen.

"The Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc"
R. 130 minutes.
Starring Milla Jovovlch, Faye Dunaway and Dustin
Hoffman.

7:40, 10:45

In 1429, a teenage girl from a remote village stood before the world and announced she
would defeat the world's greatest army and liberate her country. This epic drama
chronicles one of history's most awe-inspiring women, but has faced harsh criticism from
historians.

"The Bachelor"
PG-13. 101 minutes.
Starring Chris O'Donnell, Renee Zellweger and Mariah
Carey.

7:30,9:55

A happily unmarried man plodding along in life, letting things take their course, meets The
One and decides to pop the question but botches it. When an inheritance comes into
play, he's forced to choose between the woman he loves and a hefty reward. Full of
hilarious mishaps and a quirky new take on relationships, this should be a decent comedy.

"The Bone Collector"
R. 11 8 minutes.
Starring Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, and Queen
Latifah.

7:30, 10:10

This thriller details the scheming of a serial killer, his crafty attempts to evade capture, and
the sheer brilliance ofAmerican forenstcs in action. The intensity and fast pace of this
show, in addition to the superior acting skills of the talented cast, should make it worth
your white.

"American Beauty"
R. 118 minutes.
Starring Kevin Spacey,Annette Bening andThera Birch.

8:00, 10:40

One of this year's most critically acclaimed films/American Beauty" shines a spotlight on
suburbia through a rich structure, intense drama and high-quality acting. Spacey and
Bening give excellent performances that evoke a high emotional response.

"The World Is Not Enough"
PG-13. 127 minutes.
Starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau and Denise
Richards.

7:00,9:50

"The Insider"
R. 155 minutes.
Starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Diane Venora.

7:10, 10:30

One hundred fifty-five minutes is an awful lot of time to dedicate to the story of a top
news reporter trying to coerce an ex-tobacco producer into revealing the tricks of the
trade. I'm interested in the logistics of plot development of it, but I don'tknow that I'm
intrigued enough to devote that much time to a film that sounds slightly less than riveting.

"Pokemon:The First Movie"
PG. 96 minutes.
Starring Ash, Pikachu, Meowth, Misty, Brock and Team
Rocket.

7:20,9:35

For kids, you say? Nah ..."Pokemon" has an appeal all its own.Well-done Japanese
animation, a campy premise and some damn cute fighting "pocket monsters" (hence the
name Pokemon) make "Pokemon" an excellent way to catch up with those childhood fads.
Go late to avoid the hordes of 11 -year-olds.

"The Sixth Sense"
PG-13. 107 minutes.
Starring Bruce Willis, Olivia Williams and Haley
Osment.

7:50, 11:50

If you've heard about "The Sixth Sense," you already know the premise. If you haven't,
suffice it to say,"l see dead people." If you go, you'll see more than just dead people; you'll
see a tantalizing, confusing, intelligent, overloaded horror film with a killer ending. This
one's been in theatres forever

ways got a smile on his face.
Thorn is the young woman who helps
out Fone Bone. GrandmaBen looks after
Thorn and partakes in the annual cow
race (she actually runs against the cows
—and always wins). Supporting members
include jivin' Ted the Bug, the mysterious Red Dragon, the stupid, stupid Rat
Creatures and the scary Cloaked Figure,
who is after one of the cousins.

WhyI love thisbook: Smith has created
a captivating hero in Fone Bone. Short and
big-nosed (he is quite sensitive about it),
he is simply adorable; at the same time,
however, he is the ultimate knight in shining armor. His willingness to stand by his
cousins at all times is endearing. His resourcefulness is inspiring. His crush on
Thorn is cute.
Smith's work is not just mushy stuff,
though. The mysterious Cloaked Figure,
the Red Dragon and Thorn's haunting
dreams about her childhood keep the
readers on their toes, wondering how all
these pieces will fall into place.
Perhaps most important, though, is that
"Bone" is side-splittingly funny. Neil
Gaiman ("Sandman") wrote that hardly
anyone can pace a joke better than Jeff
Smith. There's no question about it. As an
example: the monstrous Rat Creatures,
who capture Fone Bone, end up arguing
over whether they should make him into
a stew or a quiche. "Quiche?! What kind
of food is that for a monster to eat? [To
Fone Bone] Listen, do you think you could
come back in half an hour? We'll have this
straightened out by then!"
As far as his artwork goes, Smith is a
fine cartoonist. His ability to give the anatomically simple Bones a myriad of facial expressions (all in black and white)
is impressive. His work is clean and
simple, yet he successfully and vividly
brings the forested valley to life.

The story thus far: Each issue of "Bone"
begins with the following inscription:
"After being run out of Boneville, the
threeBone cousins are separated and lost
in a vast, uncharted desert. One by one
they find their way into a deep, forested
valley filled with wonderful and terrifying creatures ..."
Issues No. 1-12 begin with the cousins
getting separated and end with their reunion at the annual village spring fair. A
list of characters provides insight into the
fantastic world that Smith creates.
Fone Bone is the Bone with a heart of

Directing class
presents 'A Night
of Scenes'
By Hilary Rice
For The Phoenix
The Theatre Department will be presenting "A Night
of Scenes" this Sunday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. in the Frear
Ensemble Theatre. The four realistic scenes is directed
by students enrolled in Theatre 35 (Directing Workshop):
Cathy Muller 'OO, Christian O'Toole 'Ol, Julie Russo 'OO,
and Heather Weyrick 'Ol.
In a scene from "A Lie of the Mind," written by Sam
Shepard and directed by Muller, a mother lies sick in
her son's bed, resolved to die there. Her daughter will
try anything, including the truth, to get her out. In this
scene, these strong women battle over memories, soup,
clothing, and men.
Russo describes the characters in her excerpt from
"The Maids," by Jean Genet, with a quote from Sartre:
"Low, hypocritical, disagreeable, and mean because their
employers dream them that way, they belong to the 'pale
and motley race that flowers in the minds of decent
people.' They are disturbing only in that they are dreams
who dream of swallowing up their dreamer."
Weyrick's piece from August Strindberg's "Miss Julie"
explores the troubling aftermath of a relationship between an aristocratic young lady and her family's manservant, highlighting the tension that arises when a relationship crosses class lines.
"The Lover," directed by O'ioole, was written by
Harold Pinter, one of Britain's premier postwar dramatists. "The Lover" features characters Richard and Sarah, who conduct themselves with apparent respectability in the mornings, while living out a sequence oferotic
rituals in the afternoons.
The cast includes Shirin Ali 'OO, Carlos Duque 'O3, Sara
Gravelin 'O2, Melanie Hirsch 'O2, Christine Lattin 'Ol,
Elisa Matula 'O2, and Cathy Muller 'OO.
Performances will be Sunday, November 21, 1999 in
the Lang Performing Arts Center's Frear Ensemble
Theatre at 2 and 8 p.m. Reservations are recommended
and can be made by calling the cultural events hotline
at xB2OO. There will be an informal reception with the
directors and actors after the show.

it's a fantastically funny ending. Smith has been on hiatus since then;

I miss reading new issues terribly.

Did I mention that I love this book? If
you want to try something new, please try
this book. It's great for kids, but I feel it's
also wonderful for adults, because they
can catch all the subtle humor as it plays
out.

Smith has also turned hisEisner Awardwinning book into an animated movie,
which will be released by Nickelodeon
next summer. He had full creative license
over the production of the film; the plot
of movie draws heavily on issues No. 112.
Last, but not least: Just because you've
been such a good audience, here is a clip
of a never-been-published-before interview with Jeff Smith:
JL: So, um, is Bone's nose, like, squishy?

orders, was a little less than realistic.
Believability aside, the scenes were also
unnecessarily explicit and the blood splatter in the corner of the camera got pretty
irritating.
A few fights, the crowning of the Dauphin, and the action comes to an abrupt
halt. Joan is captured, incarcerated, and
plagued by her thoughts, her conscience,
Satan, and God, all nicely done by a
cloaked, malevolent Dustin Hoffman.
Here, the movie branches, becoming
two movies with one title. Deviating from
the straightforward interpretation of
Joan's life and conquests, "The Messenger" delves into her soul, presenting the
audience with a sketchy conclusion about
the innermost concerns of this 19-yearold superwoman. As Hoffman hits Joan
with one semi-logical guilt-trip after another, she falls to pieces, taking the movie
with her as she goes.
Questioning her own faith, Joan feigns
confidence before a judgment council of
Catholic headsmen. Alone in her cold,
dank cell, she is tormented by the thought
that her actions stemmed from personal
pride and realizing the brutality and destruction she facilitated. Had she really
done God's will? For the last half of the
movie, the audience becomes as confused
as Joan. Suddenly, the trial is over, and
Jovovich is writhing at the stake, the inevitable flames lapping at the hem of her

Despite youthfulness of team, men's basketball optimistic
By Ben Park
For The Phoenix

forward, Richard Barrett 'Ol,

With the loss of four seniors,
three of whom were starters,
the Swarthmore men's basketball squad faces a difficult
road ahead. Garnet legend and
last year's leading scorer Tim
Schofield will be missed this
season, as will his average of
18.8 points per game.
"On paper, it looks like an uphill battle for us to be really competitive," said Coach Lee
Wimberly. "We are extremely
young —ll of our 14players are
freshmen and sophomores... We
only have 5 players who have
any on-the-court experience at
all."
Last year's champions, Johns
Hopkins, returns four starters
this season. As if that were not
enough, so do the runners-up,

this year's squad.

Intramural soccer competition
reaches its final stage
By Stephen Armah
For The Phoenix
The 1999 intramural soccer competition entered the final stage after two exciting
semi-final games last Sunday. Fabulous Faculty and the Stupendous Staff will play
Curious George and the Junk Monkeys in a final game that will determine who gets
the prize t-shirts at stake. The prize t-shirts, which are given to the winning team
each year, have "Intramural Champions" inscribed boldly on their fronts.
In the first of the two semi-final games played last Sunday, Curious George and the
Junk Monkeys shut out the challenge from opponent team 120 with two excellent
goals from striker Jed Lewis 'OO. In a game that had tempers flaring and curses
flying, the gifted 120 could not find the net, despite putting Curious George under
intense pressure in the second half with successive corner kicks. 120 conceded defeat after Lewis struck again late in the second half off a fast break. Fatima Jaffer
'OO, mid-fielder for 120, summed up the feelings of her team members when she
stated, "I think Curious George and the Junk Monkeys can win the T-shirts. I do not
think we played badly at all. They were just better."
The second semi-final game between Expediter and Fabulous Faculty and the Stupendous Staff proved to be even more interesting. In fact, the Faculty could only
beat Expediter on penalties after a 2-2 draw during the regular time game. In the
penalty shootout, Roger Foltz 'Ol, first shooter for Expediter, scored, but goalkeeper
Don Farriz of Faculty was able to deflect the shots of subsequent shooters Frank Yeo
'Ol, lan Huntington 'Ol and Marc Jeuland 'Ol. Karl Moehlmann, Lloyd Guindon and
Larry Schall each scored for Faculty and Staff, setting up the final game between
Faculty and Curious George. The final is slated for 12:30p.m. this Sunday on the
Cunningham fields.
In a related development, several participants in this year's intramural competition have commented on the low participation rate of females in the games. While
some players cite the unwillingness by team captains to play the females from their
teams as the cause of low female participation, other players believe that the very
physical nature of this year's games as well as questionable officiating could be more
pertinent reasons for low female participation.
Unfortunate as this situation is, some veteran participants in the competition, such
as Marc Rockmore 'Ol, who has played 7 seasons, argue that the situation is not hopeless. More women can be encouraged to play if there is stricter enforcement of the
male-female ratio constitution of the teams. Under this proposal, teams would not be
allowed to participate if they do not have at least one female player. Referees should
also be given proper cards (red ones and yellow ones) in order for them to take more
control of the games and assure players of their safety while out on the field.
Overall, however, this year's intramural soccer season has been a very fulfilling
one. As Antenna Tesfaye 'O3 put it, "My weekends actually got better once the games
started. Even though time constraints with work and academics prevents me from
Playing a team sport, I enjoy the two hours that I spend playing soccer on Sundays."
If Tesfaye's sentiments can be generalized across all participants, then kudos to
Annalise Bloss Paaby 'OO and women's varsity soccer coach Amy Brunner, who helped
to coordinate the games this year. As for Sunday's final, may the best team win.

Joe Culley posts up his defender David Gammill.

indeed freshmen who were
thrust into the pot of boiling oil
very early in their careers. All
three showed flashes of brilliance and
all three have a
chance to be very good players
in our league."
Critical to the success of this
season will be the six incoming
guards
Joey
freshmen:
Armstead, Eran Garnotand Ben
Wiles, and forwards David
Pearce, Josh Leffler and Zak
Gelacek. Guard Joe Culley 'OO
will also be crucial to the team.
Culley played in only seven
games last season due to injuries, and the team hopes that his
off-season knee surgery will pay
off. As co-captains, Culley and
Gregg Holtmeier 'OO will be expected to keep this young team
from falling apart when opponents make their runs.
If Culley and Holtmeier can
step up and take active leadership this season, and if a couple
of players besides Lewis,
Gammilland Brubaker can play
well enough to put in ten to fifteen quality minutes a game,
then this team can compete.
Wimberly is optimistic.
"I have been very pleased so
far with the learning curve and
the effort level of our team," he
said. "They are pretty tough
physically and mentally and will,
I believe, compete for 40 minutes every night."
The bottom line for the team
is talented play.
"Our goal, as it is every year,
is to qualify for the Centennial
Conference Playoffs," said
Wimberly. "We will have to play
our absolute best and get some
breaks along the way to accom:
plish that goal. There are no
pushovers at all on our schedule
this year."

Darting here
and there
Some random thoughts, observations,
and commentaries listed in no particular
order:
Congratulationsto the two Swarthmore
cross country superstars who will be representing the Garnet in Wisconsin at the
National meet this weekend. Joko
Agunloye 'Ol and Liam O'Neill 'OO both
placed second in the Regional meet. Best
of luck to both of the sexy...uhhhhh, I
mean talented, runners.
What the hell is going on in the NFL
this year? The Rams and Colts look like
world-beaters while my beloved 49ers
would get blown out even if they lined up
against the Garnet Tide. And who would
have guessed that the key to Detroit's
success would be to get rid of the greatest offensive weapon in the league? I simply cannot take seriously any season
when Olandis Gary and Errict Rhett are
two of the top running backs in the league,
while Terrell Davis and Jamal Anderson
can only watch from the training room.
All things considered, this topsey-turvy
has been exciting to say the least.
•Is it possible that the best basketball
player at Swarthmore is also one of the
best football players. Of course, this being Swarthmore and all, he does not play
for either team. J.T Haskins 'OO, who can
be seen knocking down 35-foot jump shots
and breaking opponents' ankles in pickup games in the field house, showcased
his gridiron skills in last Sunday's flag
football tournament. He had a dizzying
number of catches for who knows how
many yards, not to mention a handful of
clutch touchdowns.
•Speaking of flag football, Sunday's
tournament might have been the best
football action of the season. Four teams
battled it out in high-flying and fast-paced
action. The championship game pitted the
Best Freshman Athletes against the
69ers. The game went down to the wire,
with the 69ers winning 46-40 on a lastminute Haskins TD. Students from diverse athletic (or in some cases, unathletic) backgrounds proved that some of
Swarthmore's most talented athletes do
not play for any teams.
•How weird is the NBA? Iverson claims
he has "lost his love for the game," then
promptly scores 46 points the next night.
I'd hate to see what he could do if he was
motivated. Then, 19-year-old Mavericks
rookie Leon Smith tells his coach off at
practice, throws a rock through the window of his new Ford Explorer, covers himself in green face paint, and is finally
found facedown on the floor claiming to
be a Native American fighting against
Columbus (cuckoo cuckoo)...and I
thought Dolphins rookie Dimitrius
Underwood was nuts for slitting his own
throat.
•In a slightly saner basketball league,
the Centennial Conference, I have a notso-bold prediction to make: Swarthmore's
very own HeatherKile 'O2 will have another huge year and lead our women's
team to an impressive season. In limited
time in last Saturday's scrimmage, Kile
scored 28 points, grabbed a dozen boards,
had four assists, and even stole the ball
twice.
•More on Saturday's scrimmage.. .wow,
was that ever unfair. We imported Cedar
Crest College (although I was convinced
they were a high school team) to take a
beating at the hands of our v/omen bailers.
While most sporting events here have a
eerie similarity to David and Goliath, it
was awkward to see Swarthmore playing
the role of Goliath for a change. For 40
minutes, Swarthmore pushed Cedar Crest
like a group ofbullies playing keep-away
with some nerd's calculator (something
many Swatties can probably relate to).

Women's basketball ready for season tip-off
Garnet look to improve on last year's .500 record

By Caitlin Ryland and Christina Ciambriello
For The Phoenix

They do not dash for cash or wear spandex, but
there is no doubt that Swarthmore women's basketball will be turning heads this year. Rumor that this
team is on the rise is making rounds in the Centennial Conference, creating cause for concern.
Swarthmore is no longer a team to be overlooked.
Coming off a solid .500 season last year, the
women's squad boasted a 12-12 record, the most
successful since the 'B4 'B5 season. Although the
ending of the '9B '99 saw the departure of the rebounding sensation, captain Jean Quinn, the future
looks only brighter for the promising millenium
squad led by tri-captains Kira Cochran-Bond 'OO,
Heather Marandola 'Ol, and Kristen English 'Ol.
The Garnet Tide looks to build on last year's
achievements and become a force to be reckoned
with in the Centennial Conference. Who are these
determined women? The squad will be once again
led by the commanding leadership dance of English
at point guard and Marandola and Katie Tarr 'O2
rounding off the impenetrable backcourt. Centennial conference standout Heather Kile 'O2 returns
to start in the power forward position this season.
Other key contributions include returning Tide
women Christina Ciambriello 'O2, Emily Gray 'O2,
Caitlin Ryland 'O2, Thalia Mills 'OO, and CochranBond.
In addition to this wealth of returning starters
and seasoned veterans, four fresh new faces will
grace Tarble Pavilion. Ally Fufman 'O3, Pam
Lavallee 'O3, and Karima Wilson 'O3 will create a
formidable attack in the backcourt, as Sarah Tufano
'O3 will provide much-needed depth to Swat's low
numbers in the post position. "The upperclass backbone makes for a potent line-up in and of itself,"
said Gray, "but add in those frisky freshmen, and
you've got a recipe for success better than Martha
Stewart herself could put together." She added, "We
have the luxury of a very deep, talented team this
year, and it will be interesting to see how we step
up to the challenge."
The sideline tag team duo of Coach Adrienne
Shibles and new Assistant Coach Rebecca
Cusumano-Seidel will combine forces to lead the
Garnet to victory. Affectionately dubbed "Coach
Coos," Cusumano-Seidel is a decorated athlete and
1999 graduate of Wellesley College. Her "no-nonsense" practice ethic and vast knowledge of the
game is sure to be an asset to the team.
Overall, the team has a very positive outlook coming into this season. "The team is going extremely
hard in this preseason," notedKile. "We still have a
lot to work on, but are eager to make the transition
to the game phase of the season."
With the intense preseason training under their
belts, including a rigorous practice and lifting regimen, these women are conditioned to bear down on
the most competitive opposition the conference has
to offer. With all of the pressures to perform on this
squad, Shibles aims to keep things in perspective.
"Many of the women on the team place a lot of expectations and pressure on themselves," she said.
"I would simply like to walk away from our 19992000 season feeling like we did thebest that we could
do and knowing that we had fun doing it."
Swarthmore anticipates success as they tip off
against Endicott College at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday in
Tarble Pavilion in the second annual Swarthmore
Tip-Off Tournament. The winner of this contest will
advance to play the winner of the Wesleyan University/ Heidelberg College game on Sunday at 3:00
