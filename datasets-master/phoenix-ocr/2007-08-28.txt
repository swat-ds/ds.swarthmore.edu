A day off in the Poconos

After days of intense training, waking up early in the morning, attending numerous meetings and tackling different reinacted hall
scenarios, RAs took off on Saturday to Lehigh River in the Poconos for a chance to let off some heat on a rafting trip.

SwatMail encourages earlier communication
BY MARIA KHIM

mkhiml@swarthmore.edu

The Class of 2011 was the first in Swarthmore's history
to receive their college e-mail addresses over the summer,
rather than upon arrival to campus as in years past. While
the change has provided the administration with an
enhanced ability to communicate with first-years prior to
Orientation, it has also led to increased Internet communication among the new students, particularly through the
social networking site Facebook.
According to Dean of Students Jim Larimore, the
administration decided to set up the new students' email
accounts earlier than in previous years to allow for more
efficient distribution of information regarding advising,
housing and getting to campus. In addition, the administration conducted online student surveys over the e-mail
system, including the Cooperative Institutional Research
Program survey, which targets first year college students.
"This change has been a positive thing for everybody,

were actively checking their e-mail. In addition, students
also received their housing information after activating
their MySwarthmore accounts.
Early access to Swarthmore e-mail also made it easier
for first-years to meet online, especially through Facebook.
Many of the incoming freshmen have already created
groups of friends using Facebook and some students have
even gone to the extent of planning their own social events
during orientation week.

"It could be unfair... But knowing a
few people has helped me feel
more confident. I can't imagine coming here not knowing anyone."
Michael Xu 'll
...

...

not only for the administration in making it easier for

them to communicate with the students, but also for the
students to start talking to each other and for them to feel
like they know people when they first get to campus," said
Associate Director for Client Services RObin Jacobsen.
"It's also just one less thing to worry about."
According to Jacobsen, within the first week approximately halfof the class of 2011 had set up their account and

"The main concern is that people will have already
made many friends and be less willing to participate in the
orientation activities," said Orientation Committee
Co-Chair Douglas Gilchrist-Scott 'O9. "However, it
may also have a good effect in getting the pleasantries
out of the way earlier and helping [incoming first-years]

form more meaningful relationships during their first
week."
Michael Xu 'll felt that meeting classmates online has
eased his transition to college life. "It could be unfair to
those who do not use Facebook since there are already
cliques and even couples that have formed," he said. "But
knowing a few people before coming here has helped me
feel more confident. I can't imagine coming here to a completely new place not knowing anyone, especially since I
am from abroad."
Janis Libeks 'lO, an 1-20 international club member
involved in the InternationalStudent Orientation, did not
think this would greatly affect how the first-years form
friends. "During orientation you meet new people and
become friends with people who are not necessarily the
same people that you met or talked to online," he said.
"The friendships you develop when you actually get to

school end up being the ones that really last."
Members of the Orientation Committee have also been
able to use Facebook as a communication device, to advertise orientation events and send invites to the first-years.
"Many incoming freshmen spend the whole summer
feeling nervous," said Myrt Westphal, Associate Dean for
Student Life. "Hopefully many of them will come feeling
more comfortable having talked to a few of their classmates. It will be interesting to see how it plays out between
the freshmen and the various hall dynamics and how it
may change the nature oforientation."

RAs undergo thorough summer training
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu

The ten-day long Resident Assistant
training, which took place prior to
Orientation, has left this school year's new
group of hallparents fit, robust and ready
to welcome the incoming first-years from
the Class of 2011 as well as the returning
students.

Training, which lasted from Aug. 19 to
Aug. 27, was organized by Coordinator of
Residential Life Liz Derickson, Associate
Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal and
the second-year RAs. The goal was to
instruct incoming RAs regarding general
hall and dorm policies, potential scenarios
that could arise in the dorms, information

on the various campus resources and facilities available and tactics to create a
vibrant hall environment through decorations and activities.

"They had props, they
rehearsed It was a
blockbuster hit. The logistics were just impresive."

"A lot of [the training] is really about
strengthening the RA community and reinforcing that it stretches beyond the RA and
connects with the other folks who work in
the college and provide support to stu-

dents," Derickson said. "Having fun is in
that list of goals. That's a big one. We have
a lot offun."
"I think the main point of RA training is
getting RAs prepared for handling issues
that might arise in our halls," said Mertz
RA Seth Hara 'OB. "It also includes introducing and familiarizing RAs to the

THE PHOENIX

resources on campus. I really appreciate
getting to know better certain aspects of
how Swarthmore operates. I feel like that is
definitely important as an RA
to know
your resources and how to use them to
direct the students."
In order to learn how to handle a wide
array of situations, the RAs were not only
given the rundown on party guidelines,
roommate contracts and vandalism policies, but also took part in an intense training called Behind Closed Doors in which
they had to handle simulated scenarios in
an acted-out hall environment and were
really put to the test as an RA.
"The second-year RAs set up scenarios that we actually had to handle,"
Hara said. "We broke up into groups
and took turns playing the part of the
RAs. The designated RA would come into a
room or would wait for someone to come to
them with a problem. There would be
some situation and, of course, they did
all of the biggest problems that you
could think of, whether it was someone
being sexiled, causing noise out in the
hall or having drugs or alcohol in
the room. We would have to then handle
the situation. Afterwards, we would
debrief in the group and discuss what we
did well or ways we could have handled
it better."
"That session, Behind Closed Doors,
tends to be one of the most memorable and
most engaging of the sessions," Derickson
added. "It takes of all of those hypothetical
issues and puts them into an immediate situation of concern that requires them to
make use of those skills they learned in sessions. They had props, they rehearsed
It

In addition to doing role-playing and

"WHAT IF...": HOW TO DEAL WITH DILEMMAS AT SWAT
Your parents have finally left you alone. But now
you’re alone and silently panicking about the endless

RA’s keys can open every residential door in their
building. Public safety also has keys that can let you
back into your room.

A student receives a caffeine boost at Kohlberg Coffee Bar, just north of Parrish Hall.

PLACES TO BUM AROUND SWAT
looking for the best place to take a quick snooze
or the best place to party all night. The wisdom I
will impart was gained through blood, sweat and
a copious or, some would say, shameful, amount
of tears. Without further ado:
Best place to take a nap:

The Kohlberg Coffee Lounge is best when it
comes to a short catnap. As the embarrassingly
numerous Swatties that have seen me passed out
in Kohlberg can attest to, the wide sofas in the
lounge are extremely comfortable when you want
to catch a few quick Z’s. Coincidentally, this is
also the best place to study if you want to coat all
your textbooks in a layer of drool.

Best place to study:
Sure, those first floor McCabe carrels are
nice, but you probably won’t get one unless you
feel like displaying your prowess of merciless
elbowing. A great alternative is the Cornell
Library lower level, which is quiet enough for
study, but also allows gentle conversation. You
won’t feel isolated or distracted and you’re in
easy access to a cuppa joe from the Science
Center Coffee Bar or killing a tree (or four.. .or an
entire forest) while printing out your Soc/Anth

reading.
Best place to hang out:
Parrish Beach (the irony of the name will only
become crueler as the winter months set in) is a
perfect place to take a break and just chill out
with friends or hold a club meeting. Sit on the Big
Chair, toss a Frisbee around or bring out your
iPod and do some sun worshipping.
Best place to watch unicyclists cheat

death:

Sharpies Hill. Prepare to be amazed and try
not to scream and cover your eyes when they
whiz by effortlessly. Not that I did. Twice.
Best place to pull an all-nighter:
The Science Center Math Stat Lounge is the
definite winner. The chilly air conditioning and
bright lights keep you alert and the nearby Coffee
Bar makes killer mocha smoothies. The lounge
boasts comfy couches to sink into, plenty of outlets for late night work on laptops and even kind
EVS staffers who turn out the lights for you when
your “quick nap” turns into a near-death slumber.
Best place to satisfy your late-night

munchies for free:
Sometimes, stale pierogies smuggled from
Sharpies in a napkin don’t make the cut. Luckily,
when Kohlberg Coffee Bar closes at 10 p.m. every

4

night, they give out the leftover coffee, pastries
and sandwiches from earlier in the day for free. I
have received numerous threats for disclosing
this information and thus increasing the studentall
to-pastry ratio. I do it allfor you, first-years
for you.
Best place to watch television:

Willets’ Mephistos Lounge easily defeats the
competition. The widescreen TV dwarfs other
dorms’ meager and occasionally funky-smelling
offerings (I’m looking at you, Danawell) and
boasts a roomy lounge with plenty of couches on
which to park your tush and kick back with an
episode of Grey’s Anatomy.
Best place to hook up:
Scott Arboretum at night is apparently The It
Place to schmoozewith your latest conquest since
it gets particularly dark and offers privacy that
dorm rooms routinely fail at providing. Sources
tell me you can’t see anyone’s faces, both a relief
for shy couples and awkward Phoenix reporters
who keep accidentally stumbling in on said couples.
Only Best place to socialize:
Like it or not, Paces is going to become mighty
familiar to, you over the course of the next
four years. Soon the path from your dorm
to Paces will be so ingrained that you’ll be
able to find your way back even when completely
inebriated and stuffed into a bustier (also
known as, err, Friday night). Most organizationsponsored parties take place here on weekends.
Sunday through Wednesday, the room is
transformed into the Paces Cafe, offering homemade fare like quesadillas and desserts. On
Thursdays, Pub Night starts at 9 p.m. at, drum
roll Paces.

Best place to regress to childhood:
Because SOMETIMES you just don’t feel like
discussing heteronormativity, okay? No fear of
Public Safety when you’re clambering all over
Swarthmore’s Official Climbing Tree located in
the Science Center lawn. So go ahead, satisfy
your inner childlike urges, and bring that spitball
shooter with you. Also be sure to check out the
campus swing, located between Sharpies and the
train tracks on the edge of campus.
Best place to feel like the lone survivor of
some massive wipe out of human civilization:
Third floor McCabe carrel tucked in the cor-

ner. After studying there once and sufferingfive
mini-panic attacks in rapid succession, I have
determined it is only for those who prefer a tomblike silence when they study.

FROM PACES TO PHI PSI: THE CAMPUS PARTY SCENE
When the weekendrolls around, or when you can no
bear McCabe (whichever comes first),
Swarthmore offers a surprisingly wide array of
nightlife options for such a small campus. Between the
private and SAC-funded parties and concerts scattered
throughout campus, party-hearty students can find
plenty of ways to occupy their evenings.

Paces
On Fridays and Saturdays, Paces converts its student-run cafe into a dance floor. From 10pm to 2am, students can dance the night away to hip-hop, reggaeton,
and other beats spun by the DJ of the hour. Students
man the bar, pouring rum and coke or screwdriver concoctions; however, alcohol, though often free, is not
funded by the college and is not always a guarantee.
Depending on the party and the hour, Paces can be
packed to its full capacity, ensuring a sticky, sweaty
proximity with fellow Swatties, interrupted intermittently when someone accidentally, but inevitably,
brushes against the light switch or sets off the fire

alarm.

Lily Ng ’OB described Paces as “generally a big
enough space for dancing, but small enough so that you
can easily go to the DJ to request a song or get something to drink. And if the party turns out to be bad, you
can hang out with your friends in the game room or

other parts of Tarble.”

You should know by now that serious injuries
require a call to 911 Now, what if it’s not an emergency, but you still feel sick? The Worth Health Center
is the place to go. Staffed 24/7, you will always be able
to find someone to help you and you can always make
an appointment to see the doctor, usually within the
week. Besides a doctor’s appointment, you can also go
to the nurses to ask about colds and coughs. They also
have a nifty table set up with packets of ibuprofen,
throat lozenges, hydrocortisone cream and such. The
Health Center, along with your Sexual Health
Counselors, are also great for talking about STDs, HIV
testing and contraceptives. On the other side of the
health center, you can find the counseling and psychological services. You can call in for an appointment
or in an emergency, talk to the nurse.

“Getting Too Mainstream”
You’re getting too mainstream if you don’t
realize the significance of getting too mainstream. Appropriate for any incoming class.
Example: “Did you hear that one of the incoming frosh was once a high school quarterback?

“They’re getting too mainstream.”
Heteronormative
An adjective describing things that reinforce

social institutions and cultural memes

that support the gender binary (male/female) in

personal identity, sexual relations and “natural” societal roles. Example: “How is labeling
our hall a ‘Queer Safe Space’ being heteronormative?” John the RA asked Cindy. “Because
‘Queer’ doesn’t necessarily include those who
are pansexual, omnisexual, androgynous, intersexed, asexual...” Cindy retorted.

Screw
An annual event at Swarthmore that entails
individuals “screwing” their roommate’s over
with a blind date. The key to this is that the
dates are sent trying to find each other in
Sharpies, relying on a costume they are
instructed to wear by their own roommate in
order to find their “logical” counterpart. Takes
place near the end of February. Example: “Here,
tape these fake bags of cocaine to your shirt,”
said Brendan as he handed the snow over. "...
Am I looking for Kate Moss?” said Jack, who at
this point began to worry as to just which campus druggie was his Screw date.

A splicing between the abbreviation “Swat”
and the word “gossip.” Describes a phenomenon
in which due to the size and interconnectedness
ofthe school, everyone knows everyone’s gossip
about everything. Everything. Example: “I

that John’s ex-roommate had just walked in
with John’s pastor, his biology professor and
his girlfriend’s best friend’s cousin.

You've only been at Swarthmore for a few hours, and
you're already overwhelmed. The questions you might
be asking yourself are: Will I ever be able to sort through
all these new dorm items and see the floor of my room?
(Yes, when you move out in May). Will I actually remember the names of the hundreds of overenthusiastic
Swatties I meet? (No, but that's what the Cygnet is for).
And, most importantly, where can I squeeze one good
meal out of my parents' wallets before I have to brave
Sharpies? Here are some suggestions from returning students:

Swarthmore ("The Ville")
Da Vinci's Cafe (1 Park Ave): Frequently visited by
students looking for a place to study, Da Vinci's Cafe
f offers delicious food options at a reasonable price. (Not
to mention that is has free wireless!) Their menu
includes a wide array of coffees and teas, including a beverage called the Red Eye, which includes two shots of
espresso. Pair these drinks with any one of their many
sandwich or salad options. If you're lucky, you might
even be treated to live music along with your dining.
The Co-Op (341 Dartmouth Ave): Although The Co-Op
is mostly regarded as a high-end grocery store, it boasts

an impressive deli with options for salads and sandwiches. The Co-Op also carries gourmet delicacies to bring
back to your dorm try Bobbi's Hummus; it's to die for
and it's made right here in Philadelphia.
Renato's Pizza (8 Park Ave): Flex your new collegiate

status by ordering the student special
one large cheese
pizza and large soda for only $9. Otherwise, Renato's
offers various types of pizza (anything you could want,
basically) as well as subs, water ice and many other
types of hot food.

Nadia Thai Cuisine (42 E State St): Come here for reasonably priced, but utterly delectable, Thai food. The restaurant was formally a noodle bar and still maintains much of
its original menu. Locals often boast that this is one of the

best restaurants in Media.

Fellini's Cafe Trattoria (106 W State St): With hefty portions and an intimate atmosphere, Fellini's is a solid choice
if you're in the mood for Italian. Monday night is opera
night, when singers perform arias for the dining crowd. The
restaurant's menu is extensive, varied and fresh
what
more could you ask for?
Iron Hill Brewery (30 E State St): At Iron Hill Brewery,
what a customer drinks is just as important as what they
eat. The restaurant boasts a list of fresh house brand beers,
as well as mouthwatering contemporary American cuisine.
In 2006, the brewery was voted "Best Brewpub" by

Alyan's (603 S 4th St): A small middle-eastern eatery
located right on South Street Philadelphia's mecca for
the young and hip. The food is said to be extremely wellpriced and very tasty. It's worth it just to poke around
South Street, too.
-

Bookßinders (125 Walnut St): The City of Brotherly
Love's most famous restaurant is Bookßinders. The original Bookßinders opened over 140 years ago and the
restaurant still serves quality seafood and is home to the
world's largest circular lobster tank.

Gino's and Pat's (1219 S 9th St and 1237 E Passyunk
Ave): Searching for the perfect Philly Cheesesteak?
These two cheesesteak stands have been battling each
other for years (Pat's claims to be home to the original
cheesesteak.) They are located right across the street

from one another.

Moving in with class
BY MOLLY PIELS
mpielsl@swarthmore.edu
Move-in day is always hectic. There is no way for 30(Hstudents, their families and their belongings to arrive on
campus, then find Parrish, their dorm and
Ben West without a bit of confusion. That
said, there are a number of things new and
returning students can do today to make
everything go as smoothly as possible.
It's late August, and most people involved with
Orientation will spend most of the day well out of the reach
of any air conditioning, so dehydration is a real risk.
Rudeness is one of the early symptoms of dehydration, so
please carry a water bottle with you at all times. It's a good
idea to fill it up before going to Ben West to get a student ID
because the line stretches out the door.
Parking next to the dorms is extremely limited. New students should limit the time they spend parked next to their
dorm as much as possible by unloading the car at the curb,
sending one member of the move-in party to park the car in
DuPont and then bringing all their things up to their rooms.
There are enough people around that theft is not a huge
threat, but it is still best to move the most expensive and
easy-to-steal items into the room first. For returning students, today is not the day to leave the car parked behind
Wharton or in Ben West. Just leave it in C lot (off Fieldhouse
Lane, by the South Entrance) and walk.
CAs (Campus Advisors) are posted at every dorm to help
new students move in. They are happy to direct traffic, help
find rooms and introduce new students to their RAs. Since
they have to spend the whole day outside in the sun, are not
getting paid beyond room and board and are generally not
competitive weight lifters, they're a bit less happy about carrying heavy things back and forth, so please do not ask them
to do so.
The Sharpies serving area, especially at first, can be a
very confusing place. It is also very small. It only takes one
person standing in the wrong place to cause a human traffic
jam, so please try to keep out of the way while deciding what
to eat. Returning students, please be patient. The food isn't
going anywhere and we all had trouble figuring it out once

Around this time my freshman year, most of my high
school peers were filing into thousand-seat auditoriums to
receive their class syllabi and the first of
many impersonal seminars on topics that
may or may not have interested them. As I
thought about that, far off in a Swarthmore
classroom, I had to put down my copy of "The Magic Ring,"
a medieval-era Russian fairytale about a man with a fivemile-high penis, and evaluate: the first-year seminar is a
great idea. Not only was I delighting in the simple vulgarities
of world literature, but if I had any questions, comments or
disbelieving chuckles to share with my professor and 11
classmates, I couldbe sure that a reflective discussionwould

ensue.
That was a year ago, and the seminar was "Love and Sex
in Russian Literature," taught by Sibelan Forrester. Now,
considering a minor in World Literature that traces back to
that particular class, I can still appreciate the value of the
first-year seminar. Students of the class of 2011 can enjoy
small class sizes, engaging lectures and

you, crude medieval literotica
in more than 30 first-year
seminars, specifically designed to create the kind of intense,
insightful learning environments upon which this college
prides itself. There's even one about Harry Potter, the idea of
which just galls non-freshmen.
That seminar, "Battling Voldemort," and all the other
new ones that make their first appearances on the class list
this year remind us not to miss our chances. That's the way
first-year seminars go. You only get this one chance, so make
sure one finds its way onto your schedule, lest the faculty
decide to offer a way cooler one next year. The first-year seminar is a sort of welcome gift to the class of 2011 that should

Garnet women give season preview at Spikefest

Bangs said that adding Lambert will allow the team to
run a new offense. "That will give us more options and a
stronger attacking line," she said.
The Spikefest was the first time the team played full
six-on-six volleyball, as Swarthmore has a small squad

year that prevents the Garnet from being able to

scrimmage in practice. The first glimpses proved promising for the Tide. "We have a good energy this year
which is maybe something that we've lacked in the past,"
Gold said. "[The Spikefest] was a good assessment point
in our progress."
Wang agreed that things are looking promising for the
Tide in the early going. "We have a great team dynamic,"
she said. "We mesh better this year."
The Garnet will have another chance to get out on the
court before classes begin, as the team heads to the Red
Dragon Classic at SUNY-Cortland next weekend.
Swarthmore's first Centennial Conference match-up will

veterans continued their impressive play, showing that the
offseason had not slowed them down, while newcomer
Sarah Lambert 11 put in a promising performance as she
joined Bangs on setting duty. The team is excited about
having Lambert, one of the three first-years on the team, as
a versatile player. "We can do a lot more with [two setters]," Wang said. "This gives us a lot of flexibility with

opened its 2007 campaign with renewed energy last weekend. Hosting the Swat Preseason Spikefest in Tarble
Pavilion on Sunday afternoon, the women fell to teams
from Neumann College and Johns Hopkins University, but
defeated the Gwynedd-Mercy College squad in informal
matches that gave them a chance to test their skills and
chemistry after a week of preseason practices.
The Garnet first faced off against Neumann, a team that
Swarthmore defeated in four games the last time around,
in October of the 2006 season. The Tide took an early
lead in the first game of the hour-long match, pulling
ahead 15-8 behind strong serving and offensive attacks by
Johanna Bond 'lO and Jen Wang 'O9. The Knights
responded with a strong run, taking advantage of multiple Swarthmore errors to tie the score at 16-16. The game
remained close, with each team converting big blocking
opportunities, before the Knights pulled away and sealed
the first-game win, 30-25, on three straight Garnet errors.
In the second game it was Neumann that charged out of
the gates, dominating Swarthmore on the floor for a 14-4
advantage. The Garnet managed to snap out of its daze
and narrowed the gap with big shots from Kearney Bangs
'lO, Katie Gold 'OB and Karen Berk 'OB before time ran out
the Knights holding on to a 22-17 lead.
In its second match of the day, Swarthmore was paired
up with one of the two Johns Hopkins squads that attended
the Spikefest. Despite falling behind early in the game to the
talented Blue Jays squad, the Garnet crawled back from a
15-8 deficit to drop the first game by a nail-biting score of 3028. Swarthmore used its height at the net to its advantage in
registering multiple blocks down the stretch, but Johns
Hopkins kept its composure to hold off the surging Tide.
The second game of the match was a tight battle all the way
through, as Vanessa Wells 'OB displayed her power with
three early kills and the Garnet continued to hang with the
Blue Jays before the game was called at 21-19 Hopkins.
Swarthmore's fortunes were reversed in its third and
final match of the day, as the Garnet was able to put away
Gwynedd-Mercy in two convincing games, defeating the
Griffins 30-23, 30-18. Gwynedd-Mercy stayed within striking distance in the first game before Swarthmore registered five straight points at 21-20 behind two kills and a
block from Wang and was able to persist onwards, landing
the Garnet with a victory. Swat took an early lead in the

Field Hockey: co-captain Rachel
Turner 'OB
Q: How have Lauren Fuchs and Diane
Siebold, the new additions to the coaching
staff, affected Swat field hockey?
A: I believe they both have affected the
team in a positive way With two new
goalies, it is great to have Diane concen-

trate on them and help introduce the turf

game. Lauren's experience has also been
invaluable to the team and her defensive
knowledge has really had an impact.

Q: After losing eight players to graduation, how has the influx offreshmen affected the team's game?
A: We have a really strong core of
returning players to set the standard. It is
still a little early to see how the freshmen
will ultimately impact the team, but so far,
it has been really good. We have great
incoming talent and I have high hopes for
the season.
Q: This past Saturday, Swarthmore participated in a play day at Franklin &
Marshall College where the Garnet defeated Ramapo College but lost to Eastern
College and F&M. How do you see this

8

affecting the season?
A: The play day was really used as a
gauge for our formation and to see where
our problem areas were. We have a week
until our season opens and we will use what
we have learned at F&M to come out on top.
Q: What do you look forward to most in

the season?

A: I'm looking forward to a great season
and the bonds this team is going to form on
and off the field. I'm excited for our team to
get closer and for us to make our mark on
the conference.

The field hockey team opens its season at
Bryn Mawr College on Sept. 1 at 4 p.m. It
returns home to Clothier Field on Sept. 6
against Widener University at 4p.m.
Women's Soccer: co-captain Kristen
Traband 'OB
Q: Last season, the women's soccer team
had its best record ever including the firstever conference playoff appearance. What
do you expect from your team this year?
A: We are expecting to do even better
this year. We have so much returning talent and a great freshman class, so we have
high expectations.
Q: How have the ten new freshmen
affected the team dynamics?

A: Our freshman class this year will
surely see a lot of playing time. We have
meshed well during preseason and hopefully this will continue as the season progresses. Each of the freshmen bring something unique to our team and we're excited
to see how everything will fit together.
Q: What are you looking forward to
most in this season?
A: I'm looking forward to playing
Hopkins. We lost to them 1-0 in the
Conference Championship last year, but
I'm confident we can beat them. I think
we're all anxious to prove who the better
team really is.
The women's soccer team will host the
Swat Kick

Classic this weekend where it will

play Catholic University on Sept. 1 and
Neumann College on Sept. 2, both at 12p.m.
Men's Soccer: last year's captain
Patrick Christmas 'OB
Q: What are the differences between the
men's soccer team this season and those of
past seasons?
A: One of the biggest differences I would
say between this team and teams in past
years is that there is a larger contingent of
seniors that have spent time on and off the
field and we have become exceptionally com-

mitted to the team. Ever since our class has
gotten here as freshmen, we have been gunning for a championship. This is our last
year. The juniors, sophomores and freshmen
are great:We have as good a shot as we have

ever had to do something special.
Q: How has Coach Wagner's international recruiting affected the team's dynamic?
A: If a team member from four years back
hung out with us now, they would find the
team unrecognizable. The team dynamic on
the field, in the locker room, in the dorms,
it's a direct result to the coach's recruiting.
Q: What do you look forward to most in
this season?
A: During the soccer season, all of the
guys spend almost all of their time togeth-

er. This team as a whole has become
extremely close over the past couple of
years. I think I can speak for the seniors in
saying that we are going to value the time
we have together doing something that we
all care about immensely and have committed ourselves to at this school.
The men's soccer team opens its season
with the Garnet Alumni Classic on Sept. 1
with a game against Delaware Valley College
at 7 p.m. on Clothier Field. On Sept. 2, it
returns to Clothier with a game against
Merchant Marine Academy at 3 p.m.
