MIT economics professor Robert Solow explains the phenomenon of
low unemployment and low inflation at Tuesday night's Pierson Lecture.

Nobel laureate Solow
ponders high growth
By David Ellis

"What is responsible for the
marvelous macro-economic
behavior of the United States
in the 1990'5?"posed MIT economics professor Robert
Solow. This is the question
that has confounded economists throughout the decade
as the United States, in an
unprecedented manner, has
managed to combine astonishingly low unemployment
with controlled inflation.
As the 1987 Nobel Laureate
for his contributions to
growth theory, Solow certainly has the credentials to
tackle this economic puzzle,
and he proceeded to do just
that before a packed Kirby

Nate Stulman and Rachel Stein told Student Council Tuesday night that
the decision to purchase three pinball machines forTarble was ill-advised.
he said, students should support
that interest from the student
activities budget as is done with
other "niche" groups.
Student Budget Committee,
whichmade the final decision to
purchase the machines, often
funds similar special interests,
said Marvin Barron 'O2, assistant
treasurer for the committee. "It
isn't unusual," said Barron, "to
give the five percent of the student body who would use these
machines on a weekly basis the
$6,000 to do this."
But the students speaking at
the meeting also said they were
disappointed that playing pinball
required quarters and was not
free.
"Itmakes no sense to me," said
Stulman, "that Student Council

tertainment." Most other students speaking said they agreed,
but did not go as far as Stulman
in saying that the machines
should be returned.
"Student Council is not in the
business of making money,"
Schwartz countered, noting that
the money would be used for the
machines' maintenance and then
to pay back their $6,000 purchase cost.
That revenue has been rolling
in. So far, reported Student Budget Committee Treasurer Josh
Bess 'OO. the machines have
grossed $250 in their first two
weeks of operation.
Schwartz said he would investigate the possibility of setting

Feminist Majority leader Smeal speaks
By Deirdre Conner
Phoenix Staff
Out to prove that the feminist movement is more
than just another offbeat American organization,
Eleanor Smeal, leader of the Feminist Majority
Foundation, spoke Thursday night to a filledLPAC
Cinema. The Feminist Majority, in cooperation
with other groups on campus, presented the lecture.

Smeal, a prominent figure in the feminist move-

ment for the past three decades, served three
terms as president of the National Organization
for Women from 1977-1982. Finding NOW to be
too conservative, Smeal left the organization to
found the Feminist Majority. Known as a

grassroots organizer, her many accomplishments
include pushing to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, the integration of Little League and organizing an abortion rights march on Washington,
D.C. of over 100,000 people.
Smeal commented on Swarthmore's Quaker traditions, including alum Molly Yard '33, who also
served as president of NOW. "The Quaker school

system promoted feminism... and produced some
of the most active feminists," she said.
Smeal first gave an update on the two main issues she spoke about when she was last at the college two years ago: abortion clinic violence and
gender apartheid in Afghanistan. She described
both as fighting backlash against feminism.
"The good news," she said, "is that there is something to have a backlash to."
Though at first the two problems seem vastly
different, Smeal declared that both stemmedfrom
the same source, religious fundamentalism. Last
Oct. 29, a doctor who performed abortions in Rochester, N.Y., was assassinated by a Christian militia group known as "The Army of God." Smeal
spoke of the Feminist Majority's clinic defense
partnership with NATH and Planned Parenthood
that went into action in the area, providing U.S.
Marshal protection for doctors.
"The miracle is that doctors have not stepped
back," Smeal said.
However, she reminded the audience that clinic

Contacted by Professor
Stephen O'Connell, Solow was
brought to Swarthmore for
the annual Franklin Pierson
Memorial lecture series,
named after the longtime
Swarthmore economics professor. In introducing Solow,
Professor Mark Kuperberg
brought out the superstar status of Solow within economics circles. Somewhat jokingly, Kuperberg said, "Robert Solow is one of the few
people that has lived a life to
stand up to an Al Bloom introduction." Later, Kuperberg
added, "He has a professionwide reputation for being a
rigorous thinker, and being a
genuinely nice person."
In his talk, Solow sought to

Reagan dubbed the "misery

Purchasing pinball machines
with student money was a questionable decision made in an undemocratic way, several students told Student Council Tuesday night.
"There's been some skepticism about the decision to install
pinball machines in Tarble," said
Nate Stulman 'Ol, speaking at the
meeting. That purchase, he said,
was "at best misguided and in
some ways against the spirit of
a representative Student Council."
Joining Stulman, Rachel Stein
'Ol suggested that many students would not use the new
machines and that the purchase,
of three machines for $6,000,
should have been made with
more student input or a referendum.
Stein cited figures from a poll
she took in Sharpies, which she
said found that few students
were planning to play pinball
often and that few would have
supported the decision to purchase the machines. When asked
by her survey to choose between
pinball and other uses of the
$6,000, she said 93 percent were
in favor of other options.
Student Council co-chair Matt
Schwartz 'Ol, who proposed the
pinball machines at the beginning of the semester, defended
their purchase. Even ifonly several students were to use them,

Haverford to offer minors at last Animal testing choice
Students at Haverford may
soon have the option of completing a minor in several academic
departments. The move was announced to the college last
month and will be sent to the faculty by the Educational Policy
Committee for final approval at
their October 21 meeting.
The Educational Policy Committee, the organization entrusted with forming schoolwideacademic policies, asked individual departments to submit
proposals for minors in their
departments. When the college
originally considered making
minors apart of the curriculum,
it opted for areas of concentration instead, what Paul Smith,
the Chair of the Educational
Policy Committee, calls an "educational experiment." Areas of
concentration were offeredby a
department to their majors and
fostered work in other departments that would be connected
to that major. A department
would decide what other academic programs at the college
might be of use to their students
and then offer an area of concentration in the other department.
Minors will be offered by individual departments and students will have the option of
completing the requirements for
a minor regardless of their major. For example, a Math major

will now be able to minor in
Spanish. The interdisciplinary
nature of minors is in sharp contrast to the intra-disciplinary focus of areas of concentration.
Most colleges and universities
across the country offer minors,
including Bryn Mawr. Students
who had previously completed a
minor at Bryn Mawr but were
unable to put it on their
Haverford transcript will now
be able to do so.
The
disparity between
Haverford and Bryn Mawr in
terms of minors has received
many complaints from students
over the years by students who
were doing the workbut not getting credit. Similarly, at
Haverford many students take
enough classes in a department
outside their major that would
normally constitute a minor at
other schools. President Tom
Tritton cites both "keeping close
with Bryn Mawr" and giving
credit where credit should be
due as the two main reasons for
accepting minors now. "My perspective is that students have
been completing the requirements for minors of a long time,"
said Tritton. "Thy should get
credit for that."
The Educational Policy Committee and individual departments have stressed the importance of rigorous minors that
would supplement the difficult

majors that students must currently complete. Smith emphasized that nothing would be easy
and the academic viability of departments would not be weakened
by minors. "We are reluctant to
certify the mastery of a discipline
based on a certain number of
courses taken," said Smith. "We
want students to get enough of a
discipline so that it holds together
in a significant way."
Israel Burshatin, Chair of the
Spanish department, which submitted a minor proposal to the
Educational Policy Committee,
is also quick to say that the minor "will be a major commitment
on the part of the students."
"The minor will consist of a
coherent introduction to the field
of study," said Burshatin. "Students will have to complete six
classes above the intermediate
level and of those six one must
be a 300 level course to ensure
that students are exposed to the
advanced level."
Tritton says that the college is
still committed to majors and
interdisciplinary concentrations
and that the move towards offering minors should be done carefully "There is a realization that
in certain selected areas of study
students are well served by minors," said Tritton. "I don't think
it is a good idea if it simply proliferates, but if in selected areas
it can be demonstrated that a minor will add to the department
then it is a good thing."

Housing Committee low on applicants
By Matt Sharp
Bi-College News

Wmm

Any Haverford student who
has been through the Room
Draw knows that it can be a complicated and harrowing process,
even for an individual student to
complete the routine housing
selection. For the Housing Committee members who run the
draw, it is an immense task, relying on many people's help for
its smooth operation and successful completion.
The Housing Committee has
received a record low number
of applicants this year, leading
housing officials to question the
likelihood that the spring Room
Draw will be able to run as
usual. While the draw will most
likely be able to occur in some
form, it may be impossible for
Housing Committee to conduct
a full-scale draw unless the
committee receives more applications from potential representatives.
The committee, along with
Student Housing Director Robin
Doan, serves to oversee issues
surrounding student housing on
Haverford's campus. According

to committee chair Ilya
Enkishev 'O2, during the year the
committee meets oncea week to
discuss housing policies; issues
requiring attention include revision of the rules governing the
Room Draw, in addition to such
everyday concerns as party
guidelines and soap dispensers
in dormitory bathrooms.
Enkishev mentioned current
projects including relaxing the
Room Draw rules to possibly allow coed apartments in HCA and
extended deadlines for specialinterest housing, and the production of a "housing guide for dummies" which would present a
simplified version of the complex set of rules.
The committee's single greatest responsibility, however, is to
conduct the spring Room Draw
and the mid-year "Mini Draw."
The spring draw represents a
formidable amount of work for
the committee, including the
running of the evening housing
selectionprocedure and the daytime sign-up periods. These signup sessions, held in the foyer of
the Dining Center, are when stu-

swarthmore crime

dents actually register their applications for entry into the
draw, and generally last three
hours on each day of the
weeklong draw. During these
periods, Enkishev said, at least
two committee representatives
need to be present at all times to
accept applications, and then to
draw priority numbers for each
round of the draw. Due to the
length of the process and the difficulty of piecing together the
schedules of all the committee
members to ensure that the
sign-ups are covered, Enkishev
said that at least ten to twelve are
necessary.
At the moment, however,
Enkishev said that the current
committee consists only of him
and six other members. With a
committee this small, he said,
"we are severely restricted in
terms of what we can do." Although Doan called the draw "a
very demanding process to run
even withtwelve people plus me
working full tilt," and said that
running it with the current committee would be "hard to imagine," she said, "I refuse to accept
the possibility that we would not
be able to do the room draw."

policy necessitates panel

By Heather Grigo
Bi-College News
At Haverford's 1999 Fall Plenary, a friendly amendment to
the resolution entitled "Student
Choice Policy for Classroom
Animal Use" was passed, calling
for a policy in the psychology
and biology departments that
gives students the right to abstain from participation in animal experimentation. The original resolution was authored by
Bernie Fischlowitz-Roberts 'OO,
Erika Straus-Bowers 'Ol, Kate
Conway 'O2, Chris Blount 'O2 and
Christy Stockard 'O2.
The
friendly amendment, authored
by Nathaniel Rounds 'O2 and Peter Ingebretson 'Ol, emphasized
that the resolution's intent was
to foster dialogue between the
faculty and students.
The initiative to create the
policy stemmed from the authors' desire to create an educational environment in which all
students can feel comfortable
taking classes from a wide variety of disciplines, including those
with a sincere objection to animal
testing in the laboratory. More
importantly, the goal of the resolution is to facilitate discussion
and promote collaboration between the students and the two
departments. As a result, a student/faculty panel will be formed
whose first job will be to create a
document stating the current
policy, a description of theclasses
using animal experimentation,
the content of those experiments
and any available alternatives.
The document will available to
the student body and faculty, a
new element that Straus-Bowers
claims is particularly important
for freshman. "Freshman are not
aware of alternatives to animal
experimentation from reading
course descriptions," said
Straus-Bowers. "They are afraid
to ask theirprofessors about options, and I hope that by raising
this issue and forming this panel,
faculty and students will get a
better idea of how many students are concerned about this
issueand what sorts of concerns
they have. As it stands now,
there is only a certain percentage of students who are discussing this with this professors."
The panel will also be able to revise the policy as needed.
Before discussion of the resolution at Fall Plenary, the Psychology department posted a
statement on both the comment
board and the web asserting
their belief that the passage of
the resolution was unwarranted
and the policy undermines their
educational efforts. The statement was a revised version of
the department's response to a

Swarthmore College's Public Safety record for the dates of Oct.
Francis for The Phoenix.

However, one of the four half-

semester methods courses which
must be taken by Psychology

majors requires participation in
an animal conditioning project,
posing a stumbling block for students with objections to animal
experimentation who wish to
major in Psychology. Of the additional four advanced courses
that majors must complete, one
must be in the "biological" area.
In the course most commonly
taken to satisfy this requirement, students take part in special classes before participation
in any lab sections involving animals. In these classes, they discuss the issues surrounding the
use of animals in research. The
instructor encourages students
to carefully consider these issues, providing readings which
argue both sides of the animal
rights debate. Says Professor
Davis, "We're very serious about
people's concerns about working
with animals. We're determined
to have this discussion in the
class so everybody gets a chance
to take part, and we've tried to
make accommodations with students'reluctance to be involved,
but there is a minimal level of
involvement that we think is
critically required of some of the
majors in Psychology."
Without this minimum level of
exposure to experimental and
comparative approaches to behavior, Professor Davis feels
that a student's education may be
limited since so muchof psychology has involved animal experimentation and the information
obtained from research with
other creatures' nervous systems directly benefits humans.
He stresses that it is extremely
important not to force people to
do animal experimentation, but
to force themto think about why
psychology involves such a great
deal of it and to consider the
larger justifications of using animal models.

Student Council develops active agenda for semester
SC asks for revised parking policies;
administration delivers cool response
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman

Phoenix Staff

Student parking policies need to be reformed, Student Council told Vice Presi-

dent for Facilities and Services Larry

Schall in an open letter sent before October break.

The letter, written by Outreach Chair

Rodney Morris 'Ol, asked that the admin-

istration stop booting students' cars, refund boot removal fees from this semes-

ter, and seriously investigate creating

more student parking spaces. The letter

had requested a reply by the end of the
break.
Schall responded to council's letter
Wednesday, stating in an e-mail that the
number of parking spaces on campus was
unlikely to rise in the near future and that

the booting policy had always been clear.
Morris's letter notedthe "difficulties of
acquiring convenient and adequate parking in Swarthmore," but said the current
student parking situation "isn't working."
Morris's letter was sent after weeks of
complaints to the council from students
the parking committee turned down for
permits at the beginning of the semester.
The Student Council parking committee has recommendedthat the DuPont lot
be relined, proposing a rearrangement
that would create additional parking
spaces. The letter to Schall noted that as
an option for increasing the studentparking capacity of the campus.
"Simply, if a student wants to have a
car while at Swarthmore," the letter to
Schall said, "they should be allowed to do
so."

Vice President Schall,
Student parking at Swarthmore has always been a perennial problem. From student concerns over
the permit allocation process, to the actual tickets issued for illegal parking, to the increasing
number of students who've had their cars randomly booted, the message being sent to Student
Council is that something, if not everything, isn't working.
In order to address these concerns and encourage action with some deliberate speed on the part
of the college, Student Council asks that the administration and Public Safety consider the
following:
I)That Public Safety cease booting student vehicles until the booting process and procedure are
thoughtfully articulated in writing and made available to the student body.
2) All students who have been booted this term be given a refun or credit for the boot removal,
fee.
3) A serious look be taken at new or existing options (like redrawing DuPont lot) to create more
student parkingspaces. Students shouldn't have to have a dying relative, 60 hour a week off-campus
job, or run a community service program in a neighboring community to be assured of a place to
park their car when they return to Swarthmore. Simply, if a student wants to have a car while at
Swarthmore they should be allowed to do so.
Student Council recognizes the difficulties of acquiring convenient and adequate parking in
Swarthmore. Student parking is an issue that comes uip in discussion year after year.We hope the
college also acknowledges this problems and plans to act quickly to alleviate the unnecessary
stress to students created by unwarranted bootings, mysterious practices, and a sensed lack of
concern on the part of the administration.
We have drafted this letter (to you, the Phoenix, Public Saftey.the Deans, and President Bloom) in
the anticipation of a written response by the time students return from fall break. We will review
your response at the October 18th council meeting and plan further action accordingly.
Thank you for your concern,

Student Council

Stulman and Stein, however, said Student Council should reform its decisionmaking process to allow more student
input in large budget decisions.
Stein suggested a referendum process
for large expenditures, e-mail surveys to
a response group, or all-campus surveys
deposited in students' mailboxes.
But Student Council members, openly
pessimistic, said they felt from experience that those ideas would not work at

Swarthmore.
"There's something about the culture

of this college," Bess said solemnly,
"that's not going to work. I've stuffed 1400
mailboxes and then I go weigh the recycling bin."
Schwartz agreed that students were not
politically involved, and suggested that
the problem was an outdated system of
representation for the council.
"The problem is structural," he said,
adding that this weekend the council will
begin revising its constitution.
Social Affairs Committee representative Dave Thomas 'O2 noted that students
are apathetic enough as it is that the turnout in the last set of elections was only 35
percent. "People, they just don't care," he
said.
But Stein was more optimistic about the
possibility of ending apathy.
"The way to change that," she said, "is
to show themthat their opinion does mat...

proposals
New Genuardi's van
service begins Sunday
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Student Council is investigating four-

teen proposals suggested by co-chair

Jared Solomon 'Ol. In a speedy session

Tuesday night after discussing pinball,

Solomon told the council of his ideas,
ranging from establishing a school mascot to lowering phone rates to putting all
course syllabi online.
In its consideration of other business,
the council heard from Student Budget
Committee assistant treasurer Marvin
Barron 'O2, who reported that the new van
service to Genuardi's and Target on Baltimore Pike will begin Sunday. Running
each Sunday and Tuesday from 7 p.m. to
9 p.m., the van will depart from the rose
garden side of Parrish every 20 minutes,
Barron said.
The council voted to recommend to
McCabe Library that the deadlinefor return of overnight general reserve books
and binders be shifted a half-hour later,
to 9:30 a.m.
That decision followed a complaint
from Jenny Yun 'Ol, who said that
McCabe Library's circulation policies for
the return of reserve books and binders
were unnecessarily harsh. She said the
library adds a $1 fine and a penalty point
for returning an overnight reserve late,
even if it were only 15 minutes overdue.
The council members decided to begin
consideration and action on many of
Solomon's proposals, which were:
To address the need for new ID
cards. Solomon said he wanted to investigate using the cards for dorm access,
laundry credit, and potentially services
in the ville.
To set a deadline for establishing
a multi-cultural dean position. Solomon's
tentative resolution noted that there is a
"vague understanding" of when the position will be created.
To examine the possibility of organizing a campus-wide bookswap.
To attempt to get free laundry
privileges for students.
To make a "conscious effort to
uncover the best possible phone rates for
Swarthmore students." The proposal
notedthe "obscene rates charged by STC"
and "the monopoly STC has over long dis•

To select a mascot for the school.
The proposal suggested that could help
solve the "vast lack of school spirit and

Turing of Student Council. Solomon noted
that students have a "general lack of interest
in Student Council," rapid turnover of the council's members, low voter
turnout and poor structure of the council. At an open brainstorming retreat, the
council would develop ideas for reform
of its constitution that wouldthen be presented to the student body in a referendum, Solomon's proposal said.
To provide food to students between midnight and 2 a.m. Solomon noted
that Director of Dining Services Linda
McDougall had offered to provide snacks
last year but the council rejected the idea.
He advocated running a two-week trial
program.
To have Student Council table
once a week in Sharpies. The proposal
noted that "SC often fails to grasp the
concerns of students" and having an opportunity for student input could change
that.
To provide Internet access to the
WRC and DU house. The proposal noted
that "the WRC and DU serve large constituencies on campus" and advocated
connecting them to the campus network.
To organize a school slam book.
"Given that incoming students and even
upperclassmen are unsure about the quality of both courses and [professors]," the
proposal noted, "it is important that we
provide a means to inform students."
To ensure that student space is a
priority in the upcoming capital campaign.
To make an effort to retain the
desk sitters in McCabe. "Given that anyone can walk into McCabe, security on
this campus is already lax, [and] the book
detectors do not protect us from the outside world, we need one library with a
trained guard in the evenings, and people
really like Ben."
Each of Solomon's proposals suggested
that representatives of Student Council
meet with faculty and staff to discuss the
ideas.

Solow offers explanations
for economic success
From SOLOW, pg. I

index," the sum total of inflation
and reported unemployment. "In
1990, there existed a consensus
that there was a critical unemployment rate of an economy's
capacity to produce that has the
property that if unemployment
gets below that [point], inflation
accelerates," Solow said. Despite
this consensus, while unemployment has dropped from 7.5 percent in 1992 to 4.2 percent last
month, inflation has actually
dropped from 3 percent to 1.6
percent. The reason for this intimate connection between the
unemployment and inflation
rates, the relationship between
aggregate supply and aggregate
demand at the current price
level, can be recited by any veteran of Introduction to Economics.
Solow offered a number of different reasons for the United
States' success. The first line of
analysis was that a number of
lucky breaks had occurred in the
US economy that had served to
lower inflation, three of which he
mentioned. "One obvious one is
that we have been blessed with
computer prices that are falling
like stones. If you took computer
prices out of the [consumer price
index], it does not look as good."
The second lucky break proposed by Solow was that health
care costs are rising far more
slowly than before, largely due
to the HMO revolution, because
one of the primary measures of
inflation is the Employment Cost
Index. Because health care is a

fringe benefit, the fact that
health care prices have not risen
considerably means that wages
are more static. "Additionally,
one third of the lucky breaks is
purely measurement," said
Solow. Because the consumer
price index is taking quality into
account more in its traditional
"basket of goods" measurement
of price inflation, Solow contended that inflation was simply
measured as lower than before,
while it may not actually be as
low as measurements indicate
by comparison with the past.
Beyond the lucky breaks,
Solow offered a variety of other
factors that contribute to the
1990s economy.
"I am convinced this cannot be
the whole story. Most of the
things just suppress price inflation, but wages have been unusually well-behaved," Solow said.
He proposed that demographic shifts have lead to a tremendous decline in unemployment. Because there are less
young workers today than there
were in the Baby Boom generation as a proportion of the total
workforce, and because young
workers tend to have disproportionately high unemployment
rates, Solow posited that unemployment rates reflected the aging of the population.
However, he then dismissed
this theory as not telling the
whole story, because the fall in
unemployment should have occurred earlier than they did. He
went on to offer two more demographic hypotheses: the labor
force is better educated now, and

Smeal addresses backlash against feminism, social activism

violence is going down. Today,
two-thirds of all abortion clinics
are experiencing no violence.
"We are gradually winning the
battle," she said, "but it is a painful one that should never have
been."
The Feminist Majority is also
fighting gender apartheid in Afghanistan. The Taliban, a rightwingregime thathas seized control over the country has installed a rigid oppression
against women. Women in Afghanistan cannot work, go to
school, get a passport, or leave
their house without a male family member.

"The situation now is worse
than it was two years ago.
Women are killing themselves
and their children because
there's no hope," Smeal said.
The Feminist Majority was
lobbying the United States and
the United Nations to come out
against the Talisban, and in
March of 1998, they did.
Smeal told horror stories of
refugees escaping Afghanistan
told to Feminist Majority workers interviewing those who managed to cross the border.
"They were desperate for
someone to hear what had happened!" she said. "Researchers
say they hope they never see
anything so bad in their lives.

There is virtually no humanitarian aid, and conditions in the
camps are horrific."
Since July of 1998, one million
refugees had escaped into Pakistan, making Afghanistan's the
largest refugee population in the
world. The Feminist Majority is
working to get them more humanitarian aid and entrance in
the U.S. It has also organized an
underground railroad to get
women and girls out of the country.
Despite the difference in magnitude between abortion clinic
violence and the gender apartheid inAfghanistan, Smeal drew
them together.
"In essence, we have these two

horrific things happening... all in
the name of religion. Backlash to
feminism is an understatement,"
she said.
Smeal also spoke of what she
feels is a serious problem in law
enforcement's investigating of
rape and domestic violence cases.
She cited a Philadelphia Inquirer
report which found reports that
showed police assumed women
were lying about being raped.
"They [police officers]
doubted women's stories in very
stereotypical ways," she said.
"We've been consciousness-raising for 30 years, and still stereotypes persist. It's as if nothing we
know has happened, has happened!"
Though women were 1% of
caseloads 30 years ago, now they
are still only 14%.
"We have law enforcement
that is reluctant to investigate
rape and domestic violence,"
Smeal said. "We in the Feminist
Majority are trying not only to
integrate the police force, but
also increase response time to
domestic violence and prevent
police brutality."
The Civil Rights Division of
the FBI handles 66,000 police
brutality cases every year.
"I was staggered!" she said. "I
had no idea!"
Smeal's stressed that her point
behind mentioning the police
brutality is the fact that all social problems are related to each
other. She moved from specifics
to address the students in a more
broad manner about social
change in general.
"The more we know about the
various issues, the more we are
able to change the world we live
in," she said. "So often our opponents push us intolittle boxes. In
truth, it is all intertwined; that is
why the Feminist Majority is a
multi-issue group."
Smeal spent a significant part

ofher lecture offering heradvice
to students who want to pursue
thekind ofactivism she has been
doing over the past 30 years.
"Thinking outside the box is
extremely important if you are
going to have social and economic justice," she said. "So
much of what you hear is
you must
disinformation
check, double-check and recheck again."
Smeal admitted that part ofher
agenda was to recruit young
people to join the feminist movement. She toldstudents that skills
of all types were useful, be they
medical, business or scholarly.
"I think the challenges your
generation must met are staggering," Smeal said to the audience. "The next 15 or 20 years
are crucial; we just celebrated
six billion people, but one billion
of those people don't even have
clean water!"
Smeal concluded with an appeal to students to attend the
Feminist Expo, which she estimated will have 6,000 to 10,000
people in attendance. A short
question-and-answer session followed, and the subject of birth
control was discussed. Smeal,
who was raised Roman Catholic,
supports abortion and birth control. She said that 500,000 women
in the Third World die from maternal illness, mostly from illegal abortion.
"This should be weighing
heavy in our hearts," she said.
"If people are concerned about
human rights, I don't see how
tljey can not be pro-choice."
Smeal finished the session
with a surprising statement.
"I think something really boring about the feminist movement
is that there is no disagreement
within it," she said. "The only
difficult part is figuring out how
to get our agenda accomplished."

Expanding student space
The so-called student space known as Sharpies 111 could use both a formal
function and an overdue overhaul. At some point this semester, a decision
will be made to renovate the dilapidated building and make it more useful.
So far, Student Council has heard two proposals for new uses for the
space. The Photo Club and Student Art Association have drawn up plans for
a student art gallery with a darkroom and workshop space. A coalition of
political action groups are supporting a proposal for turning the building
into a "political resource center."
Student Council needs to publicize its desire for proposals from additional
student groups so that others are encouraged to offer suggestions and
participate in the process. There are many other student groups who would
probably jump at the chance to acquire some real estate, and it is only fair
to hear from them as well.
Since this is such an important issue, the council also needs to find ways
to seek input from the student body in discerning which of the proposals for
Sharpies 111 should eventually be selected. Although Student Council
members are elected to represent the student body, they themselves have
acknowledged a lack of accountability. Council members should take care to
make sure that the process for picking a Sharpies 111 proposal will be fair
and representative of the whole student body's wishes, especially since
some students have called into question the recent purchase of pinball
machines for Tarble lounge. We think a referendum may be the only fair
way to pick one proposal.
But whether Student Council makes the decision itself or puts it to a vote
of the whole student body, the process is still unfair. Two groups have
submitted workable but mutually exclusive proposals for the use of the
space, and other groups may have decent ideas as well. How can picking
just one proposal be at all fair when there is such an obvious need for
increased student space on this campus?
All organizations need space to meet, store records and call their own.
Student Council, which is calling the shots on this issue, doesn't have any
space of its own, to say nothing of other activities. Individuals, too, need
more space to meet informally, study and have fun. In short, what this
campus needs is a new student center with lounges, food and meeting
rooms for organizations.
Renovating Sharpies 111 and the Wharton C/D basement are good ideas, and
as increasing student space goes, something is certainly better than nothing.
We applaud the instrumental efforts of Vice President for Facilities and
Services Larry Schall in those proposals, but we are sorry that this week's
fireside chat with him was canceled. It would have been an opportunity for
discussing a sorely needed commitment to bigger proposals for student space,

Respect@swarthmore.edu
From the moment we arrive on campus as freshmen, Swarthmore's
administration tries its best to treat us like responsible adults.
It's a philosophy that can be seen in the alcohol policy, Student Budget
Committee, the RA system and more. We are mature enough to make our
decisions, the administration believes, and so it treats these decisions
respectfully.
It is for this reason that we are so disappointed by the lack of respect for
the students the administration demonstrated by failing to respond to the
Oct. 7 letter sent by Student Council asking Vice President for Facilities and
Services Larry Schall, Public Safety and others to clarify and to reform the
student parking policy.
Although Student Council did ask the administration to consider action, it
by no means demanded immediate action only a simple reply. When a
reply was not received by Oct. 18, more than adequate time to confirm the
receipt of the letter at the least, it became clear the administration was and
is not taking this concern as seriously as it should.
Parking has emerged as an issue that year after year leaves students
scratching their heads and stomping their feet, wondering why they didn't
get a parking permit, why there is a boot on their car, why they are paying
parking tickets. Now that Student Council is actually making headway on
dealing with this problem, it is a shame that the administration has decided
to look the other way.
It takes only 30 seconds to hit "Reply" in Eudora and dash off a brief
letter indicating that the letter was received and is being considered. Thirty
seconds for the administration to show that it really does respect us
and
it didn't.
So where does that leave the students? They are now forced to make the
administration respect them. We encourage all students, regardless of
whether or not they have a car or even care about parking, to throw their
support behind Student Council's efforts to reform student parking
even
if it means burning parking tickets in the Ben West parking lot.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Phoenix has no privacy obligation
To the Editor:
Will the enlightened students of Swarthmore ever enlighten themselves as to the
function of journalists and news sources in a
community? As the pathetic letters to the
editorlast week (pgs. 4-5) indicate, probably

not.

Time and time again, the guardians ofrigh-

teousness have raised a foul stink whenever

The Phoenix decides to print anything that
might actually probe a controversial topic in
any way. These indignant folks seem interested in demanding grade-school apologies
to achieve some sort of personal satisfaction.
Yes, the forces of virtue are alive and well,
and may live down the hall from you.
According to the protectors of good, printing a negative story with names in it "on such
a small campus" is the equivalent of some
kind of journalistic misdeed stemming from
the parties not wanting their names released,
the paper not being sensitive to the community, or a host of other vague reasons. Furthermore, they argue, gossip will inform the
people who really want to know.
This is archaic, reactionary lunacy barely

worth even an attempt to refute it.
In the real world, if you beat the shit out of
somebody and get arrested, your name is
going to appear somewhere. If you're lucky,
it may just appear on a police report. If you're
unlucky, it may appear everywhere. That's
the choice you make.
Furthermore, the entire reason that these
kinds of things are made public is to ensure
thatthe parties are treatedfairly and receive
due process in every step of the proceedings.
Every member of the Swarthmore community should be interested in seeing that incidents occurring within the community are
dealt with appropriately. How can that happen if gossip dictates how the student body
gets its info, or if the Phoenix runs anonymous, inaccurate stories?
Protecting someone's name is not the business of the campus press. Ifsomebody thinks
The Phoenix violated laws or a campus code
of conduct, they are free to take appropriate
action against the paper. If not, it's time to
take some responsibility and grow up.

Chinese characters inaccurate, disrespectful
To the Editor:
It is ironic that the same issue in which The
Phoenix proudly proclaimed its belief "in the
fundamental journalistic ideal of revealing
the truth in full" ("Responsible journalism,"
Staff Editorial, Oct. 7) that it showed an offensive disregard for cultural accuracy in the
article "A guide to Chinatown." It is great that
the Phoenix is writing a guide to Chinatown,
for once not being titled in the "chopstick
font," yet I am deeply concerned by the dis-

CORRECTION
Due to an editing error, The Phoenix
printed inappropriate Chinese characters accompanying last week's article "A guide to
Chinatown" (Living & Arts, pg. 11). The correct characters are as follows:

play of very incorrect and stereotypical Chinese characters.
Two out of the three characters are wrong.
I mean "wrong" as in they don't exist. I can
guess what they are supposed to be, together
meaning "China-city," the literal back-translation of "Chinatown," an incorrect type of
straight word-to-word translation.
I don't understand why The Phoenix could
not have consulted someone who actually
knows the characters. There are many students on campus who learns or knows Chinese and will easily recognize that the real
name for Philadelphia Chinatown is actually
printed right in the picture of the Chinatown
arch as shown in the article. The pseudo-Oriental markings in the article title serve no
purpose but hightlight The Phoenix's ignorance and and lack of respect for Chinese
culture.

On global warming, Schelling not so hot
If it is indeed true that "all's well that
ends well" then the contrapositive, which
is logically true, is that what ends poorly
is not well.The Thomas Schelling lecture
the Monday prior to October break
started out well, and then took some misguided, unfortunate, and dangerously
delusional turns, and thus concluded on a
disturbing note.
His topic was climate change, or as it
is more popularly known, "global warming." It began with what every good progressive, liberal Swattie would want to
hear. After describing his extensive background in the field, which dates back to
1979, Schelling began discussing the basics of climate change and how the issue
came to the fore. He articulated whatthe
causes were, and how the existence of the
problem was no longer denied by
academia. He even added the factoid that
the 1992 environmental conference in Rio
de Janeiro was the biggest diplomatic
event in history, exemplifying the importance of the issue.
All the while I it felt as though he was
leading the audience to believe that climate change was a real problem, withreal
consequences, and for which real measures would be needed to reverse these
environmentally damaging trends. Sometimes I'm wrong, and sometimes I'm
wildly wrong. This is a case of the latter.
My sympathies for his views withered
and died when he began to expound upon
his overall "don't worry, be happy" point.
Before I get into the meat of his views, it
is important to note that Schelling was not
only a Professor at Harvard and Yale, and
thus a respected academic, but he was
also hired by President Carter in 1979 in
order to give an assessment of what steps
ought to be taken by the U.S. to deal with
the problem of climate change. Since his
work twenty years ago, he has been
viewed as one of the experts of the field
by both academics and policy makers
alike. Given his enormous clout, one
would hope that Professor Schelling's

advice would be of the most sage-like
quality. But instead of hearing the enlightened words of a well-respected academic
like Linus Pauling or Amartya Sen, I was
subjected to the misguided thoughts of a
Dr. Strangelove.
V. hy Dr. Strangelove? While Schelling
didn't have any hint of a German accent,
aid he did not sit in a wheelchair, what
the two gentlemen from the academic/
public policy world did share was a similar penchant for crackpot prognostica-

enlightened words of a wellrespected academic like Linus
Pauling or Amartya Sen, I was

tions about the future and the decisions
our government ought to make in order
to properly prepare. Schelling asserted
that many of the effects ofclimate change
we fear will fall upon the shoulders of the
future generation a generation which
will most likely enjoy leaps and bounds
of technological advancement, and thus
new methods to deal with those troubles.
Hence, many of the worries we have concerning the negative impacts climate
change will encompass will be neutralized
by advancements we haven't yet developed. Let me repeat that: advancements
which we have not yet developed.
Academics, on occasion, can be accused
of living in an ivory tower. If there is truth
to that statement, then Schelling not only
resided in the elephant-tusked house, but
he also held the keys to the tower's penthouse. A question from the audience
raised the point of global warming melting the arctic ice caps. The professor confessed that that potential reality was a
distinct possibility. Yet instead ofhis condemning the possibility of this grim fu-

ture, he began resembling Peter Sellers
(again) with the advice he gave.
It amounted to "Don't worry about the
oceans rising twenty feet, we will probably
be able to dam up most of the important
cities."While I waited for a "Just kidding,"
he proceded to describe his efforts oflooking at various maps of Boston, Rotterdam
and Amsterdam, and figuring out where
the most cost-effective dams could be constructed. Schelling even admitted that we
would have to sacrifice Bangladesh, as it
is too low-lying. He was being serious.
But even if he was kidding and I missed
his twisted humor, the conclusions presented from the other examples he gave
unequivocally lead to the message of"taking action against climate change is too
difficult and mostly unnecessary." Yet he
freely admitted that not reversing the
trends of climate change could lead to
Kevin Costner's "Waterworld" becoming
our grandchildren's reality.
I hateKevin Costner, I hate his movies,
and I hate the sets used in his movies. If I
can help it at all, I want to avoid Kevin's
"vision" from becoming a reality.
Overall, Schelling advocated taking the
course of inaction. While I might get my
jollies from calling him a crackpot, the
fact remains that heis and hasbeen a man
taken quite seriously by policy makers
and academics. My fundamental disagreement lies in the expectations of the
future. What we can safely predict about
the future is that we can not predict the
future at all. Relying on the technological advancements made by people who
don't exist, and assuming that they will
use their knowledge to clean up and fix
the global climate, seems to be putting a
wee bit too muchburden upon their shoulders. Even though any efforts made now
aren't going to completely eradicate our
climate woes, doing nothing and waiting
for future generations to take action, I
believe, is synonymous with cramming
for an exam. You might get lucky and
squeak by, but if you don't... well, this
would be one hell of an exam to fail. But
this time the world might really end. So
much for going to Paces.

Starbucks not the answer to Ville's woes
By David Ellis
For The Phoenix
I had this column all ready to go. I
thought about it throughout fall break. I
was going to do a hard-headed opinion
piece decrying the restrictive zoning authority of the Ville and the injustice of it
all.
When I looked at the Ville, I noticed a
lot of stores with one thing in common.
None of them is a chain.
We don't have Borders. There is no
Baskin Robbins. No McDonald's. And
first and foremost, there is no Starbucks.
Instead, we have the Christian Science
Reading Room.
Were any of these chain stores to come
into the Ville, I would undoubtedly be an
avid consumer. And because none of these
is in the Ville, I was pissed about what I,
and the rest of Swarthmore's earless
population, was missing out on. I was
bursting to write on how it was an abuse
of government authority that coercive
force could be used to artificially allow
teeny businesses to charge exorbitant
prices on minute selection in the name of
traditional community, all at the expense
of consumers such as myself.
But then a funny thing happened. The
assumption I had made all along was that
zoning laws were the culprit behind the
Ville's lack of chain stores. And I still do
feel that zoning laws are an affront to
freedom, and that they are the primary
reason why the suburbs unfortunately
reach from here to eternity.
This said, I went to the town administration in the Swarthmore Public Library
and had a look at the zoning laws. And to
my shock and chagrin, the zoning laws
for the business district are quite general.
There is no mention of chain stores.
So why no Starbucks? I posed this question to Jane Billings, the very friendly
Borough Manager of Swarthmore. She
smiled and said she recognized the frustration Swarthmore students felt at the
lack of consumption opportunities offered by the Ville, and that she would be

SWARTHMORE
overjoyed to see a private coffee shop
open.
Unfortunately, the Ville seems to lack
a number of factors that would lead to a
McDonald's wanting to move in. Primarily, there are no lots other than the co-op
that are large enough to contain a decently sized store. Instead, most plots are
only large enough to contain a boutique
store, such as the paint store we all visit
so much.
Secondarily, there is simply not enough
parking in the Ville for a franchise to desire to move in, and additional parking
expansion is extremely restricted. In this
same vein, there is not sufficient car traffic to sustain a healthy chain business,
although there is enough for specialty
stores.

Furthermore, coffee shops have been
tried in the past, and they have failed
miserably. Older Swarthmore students
will remember the coffee shop by the
train station that simply could not garner
enough business to operate in the long
run.
So where does this leave us? Am I still
annoyed that our next-door shopping district, seemingly ripe for business, does
not offer Big Macs in one minute or less?
A little bit.
But I feel the Swarthmore Borough
community as a whole offers far more in

aesthetic appeal than a Starbucks
espresso could ever hope to in practical
appeal. The most beautiful thing about
this College, and the reason many of us
chose it, is the sense of friendly community that is both real, unique and universal within the College.
Isn't the natural extension of this College community the Swarthmore community at large? So we don't have Baskin
Robbins. But what we do haveis a friendly
mom-and-pop ice cream shop where you
can go in and give them a handful of
change, and they won't even stop to count
it. We have Renato's right next door, which
is both good and fast.
In short, the annoying conservative in
me has taken a backseat to my idealism,
and this idealism is more than your typical average Joe idealism. It is real.
But enough sap. The Ville does need to
be improved, and fortunately I feel the
necessary steps are being taken towards
this end. The Ville has applied to both the
state and federal governments for funds
to expand the co-op so that it contains both
a coffee shop and a convenience store,
similar to Wawa. These are necessary
improvements towards our quality of life,
and, if the higher governments kick in,
relatively cheap, too.

Coup d'etat
at home
and abroad
Everyone's talking about it. The coup.
It threatens to destroy the legitimacy of
popular sovereignty. It reverses the will
of the people. It is more than just the sum
of its parts, for it endangers not only the
current population but the entirefoundation of democracy as well.
I must have double vision, because I see
two coups.
One began in Pakistan this week, as the
Army's Chief GeneralPervez Musharraf
led a bloodless military takeover of his
country after being fired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif and other civilian leaders were placed under house
arrest, and Musharraf went on national
television to proclaim that the Pakistani
people have suffered enough under incompetent leadership. Musharraf has
made vague allusions to his desire to return Pakistan to democracy sometime in
the future, but you can bet he hasn't exactly set a date for the next election.
That's the first coup. It's the one most
of us are talking about.
But there's another coup out there. Actually, it's right here—in America. It began in 1994 when Newt Gingrichbecame
Speaker of the House and signed the
"Contract with America." It gained
strength as Kenneth Starr, Independent
Counsel assigned to investigate the
Clinton's Whitewater deal in Arkansas,
took it upon himself in 1998 to prosecute
the President's affair with Monica
Lewinsky. People first began to use the
term "coup" in earnest late last year,
when the House of Representatives actually impeached the President—without
popular support for doing so.
Even though the Senate did not convict
the President and remove him from office, Congressional Republicans have
continued their impeachment. First, they
openly criticized the American military
campaign in Kosovo, and continue to do
so to this day. Second, they have refused
to compromise with the President on a
budget, which is three weeks overdue.
And finally, to reinforce their refusal to
cooperate with the President no matter
what, they voted down a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty that could put an
end to the dangerous level ofnuclearproliferation around the world today.
I call this a coup because Republicans
are violating conventions of American
government that have existed for centuries, and they are subverting the popular
will. In the history of this country, legislators of either party have rarely challenged the president regarding ongoing
military campaigns, and they almost always pass major treaties the President
has negotiated and signed. And it should
be a matter of course that the White
House and Congress agree on a compromise budget before the government is
forced to shut down.
More importantly, a Congress which
targets the President without popular
support targets the democratic will of the
entire country. The Republicans who are
trying to cancel the 1996 and 1998 election mandates are behaving as irresponsibly as the Pakistani general who deposed Prime Minister Sharif.
In some sense, this American coup is
the more sinister of the two, as this one
has come about slowly and without national televisionannouncements. This one
has insidiously crept its way into the everyday workings of our legislature, our
media and even our pop culture. This one
is under no international pressure to revert to democracy. If we don't do something, this coup is here to stay.

By Nick Attanasio
Phoenix Staff

When William Jefferson Clinton unleashed upon society convicted terrorists
in an effort to secure his wife a job in New
York, one could but shake his head and
mutter, "Of course. That's Clinton."When
the man goes so far as to toy with our
nation's safety for equally base political
reasons, it seems quite too much.
On paper, the Senate's rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty appears
a crime against peace and rationality. The
sad truth of the matter, however, is that
the entire affair was a farce created by
the Clinton administration to curry ill
feeling against Republican opponents.
How could the Clinton administration
reasonably expect the Senate to approve
a treaty that was utterly lacking in guarantee? American administrations dating
back to the Eisenhower era approached
the issue of arms-control with caution,
asking two principal questions:
1) Could the United States, with a strategy of nuclear deterrence, maintain a
reliable stockpile of nuclear weapons
without testing?
2) How would arms-control be enforced
and in what ways would violators be penalized?
Clinton must have been aware of his
failure to address these critical questions.
Furthermore, much of his failure to address the Senate's concerns lay in the fact
that he made no effort to include the Senate in the treaty-making process. Arms
control negotiations of the 1980s were
successful because Reagan and Bush involved Congress from the start and even
allowed bipartisan Senate "observers" to
attend the talks. Real efforts were made
to address the senators' very practical political and military concerns.
This time, however, Clinton completely
failed to involve the Senate in the treaty
negotiations, ultimately dumping upon
the legislators a draft about which they
still hadmany unanswered questions. Apparently, the President deemed it unnecessary to brief the senators on the treaty
he was asking them to approve, relying
instead on political pressure to compel
ratification. The Senate erred on the side
of caution, preferring not to endorse a
treaty at all than to adopt one that held
no guarantee of gain.
President Clinton must have realized
that his ill-conceived treaty was doomed.
The man as always, however, was measuring success not based on the national
good but political benefit. As impractical
as the treaty was, its ratification would
have nevertheless marked Clinton as a
President who advanced arms-control.
Hey, a few pictures, the right headlines,
and anyone can look like a hero, right?
Sadly, Clinton was planning success
through the more likely outcome of his
treaty campaign—failure. After all, to the
ill-informed citizen, an arms-control
treaty is just that...who in the world would
not want to ratify it? With the Senate's
rejection of the treaty, Clinton opted to
settle for a little, old-fashioned Republican bashing. Those militaristic, isolationist nuts! Howcould they possibly not want
to stop the spread of nuclear weapons!
Ironically, the American public proved
far less susceptible to manipulation than
Clinton had counted on. Recent surveys
have indicated little support within the
populace for the treaty. Furthermore, although this need not be a cause of pride
for the United States, surveys have shown
only 5 percent of Americans to be seriously concerned with the issue of nuclear
weapons. Not only did Clinton wage a political battle against his opponents with
unreliable tactics, he even picked the
wrong field on which to wage his battle.

Parking problems make life difficult

uncoraraop Student parking should be a priority for the college

Clinton the
culprit in
treaty debacle

oct.

Student parking at Swarthmore sucks.
This is not a revelation. Every year,
people complain about parking in the
trademark disorganized Swarthmore
way. Letters and Op-Eds appear in The
Phoenix every fall, students engage in
surveillance of parking lots to count perpetually open spots, members of the clandestine parking committee are peppered
with invective in private conversations.
A lot of whining goes on. Last year, I was
even approached by students who had
"hot tips" regarding public safety officers who were illegally parked while offduty. There is no doubt in anyone's mind,
student or administrator, that students
want more spots.
The question is, then, why don't we get
them? The answer is simple: we don't get
spots because it is not a priority for the
college.
The college treats parking as an "extra," a kind bonus for students. It is not a
necessity, but an expendable space (which
is why construction vehicles and materials are taking up four spots in C lot). Student parking at Swarthmore, in the opinion of the administration in general, and
ofVice President Larry Schall in particular, has reached its carrying capacity.
From Mr. Schall's perspective, the college
can accommodate only so many spaces,
and through the efforts of his office, we
are already pushing the limits. Furthermore, Mr. Schall (who presumably speaks
for the college on matters of parking),

uyijll->^r^iimumjii.yii.^.^yy^yg^^
■ ■

"

•

■

s-iAi^B

sees student demand for spots as everincreasing and always in excess of available spaces. Build ten more spots, and
ten more students want parking; the college can never meet demand.
This isn't an unreasonable position. It
certainly must seem that way to Mr.
Schall. However, to students, greater
demand means simply, that 1) cars are
more of a necessity now than they were

Maybe the one thing more
universally acknowledged than
the crappiness of parking is the
crappiness of student life.
five or ten years ago, and 2) we still don't
have enough spots to meet student demand. After all, student demand for spots
really isn't infinite, is it?
It is this essential miscommunication
that condemns student parking to its
present status. Administrators aren't
being malicious or sneaky. Students
aren't communicating their demands ineffectively. We're just speaking different languages. Maybe miscommunication isn't as glamorous or controversial
as evil administrators and oppressed students, but it's a lot harder to fix.
What needs to be done is that the college needs to align its view of parking
with that of students. The reason they
have to do this is not simply that a good
percentage of students would approve,

but also that parking, while not a necessity, is not really a luxury. Especially at
Swarthmore, parking is important for
several reasons.
First, parking contributes to student
activities. Swarthmore already has precious little support for student groups.
The school even acknowledges the difficulty groups face in its own recently completed self-study. They come to the conclusion that students need "leadership
training." However, I thinkthe reason so
many student groups have problems staying solvent is that, for many of them, it's
so damn hard to get even the littlest things
accomplished.
When you're the editor of The Phoenix it's hard to find a better publisher
when you don't have a car. When you're
tutoring in Chester four days a week and
you can't get a ride, you might as well
stop going. When you're protesting
something in Philly or trying to meet a
political candidate, a car would be awfully nice.
Individually, these things don't really
add up to a decrease in student activities, but since most student groups are
run by sophomores, its aggregate effect
is a pretty inconveniencing one, another
reason for busy Swatties to get discouraged.
Second, parking contributes to student
life more generally. Maybe the one thing
more universally acknowledged than the
crappiness of parking is the crappiness
of student life. Add too few parking spots
to the most boring town in America and
you have a recipe for bad student life. It's
a hassle for students to go out to eat, pick
up a light bulb or go to a bookstore.
It shouldn't be.

Bush lacks foreign policy know-how
Bush's foreign policy ignorance, reliance on advisers
more inexcusable than Quay le's famous slip-up
By Caleb McDaniel
The Battalion (Texas A&M U.)
(U-WIRE)
Misspelling the word "potato" should be a forgivable offense.
Mislabeling the East Timorese as East
Timorians is somewhat less trivial.
Nevertheless, while pundits and public opinion lambastedDan Quayle in 1988
for writing a fateful "e" on a school chalkboard, Americans seem frightfully unconcerned with George W Bush's inability to call foreign peoples by theirproper

names.
Thus far in the race for the White
House, Bush has revealed and even reveled in his ignorance about a variety of
internationalaffairs. Quayle's inability to
spell the name of a root effectively barred
him from future political success, but
Bush's apparent inability to speak on the
roots of foreign situations has done nothing to slow his rapid rise as the Republican frontrunner.
This irony must be reversed. Thinking
Americans must begin to call Bush's loose
grasp on diplomacy into question.
More than ever before, the United
States needs a chief executive with the
ability to tread lightly on the scattered
eggshells of internationalrelations. Volatile ethnic conflicts, continuing fallout
from the breakup of the Soviet Union and
rising rogue dictators must be dealt with
by prudent and practiced politicians.
But wisdom on these matters can only
belong to diplomats who know their stuff.
And Bush has proven he is not a member
of this select group.
Referring to the East Timorese as East
Timorians is not disastrous in and of itself, but it is symptomatic of a larger gap
in his knowledge. Bush has an unabashed
habit of deferring to his advisers on all

foreign matters.
"I may not be able to tell you exactly
the nuances of the East Timorian [sic]
situation," Bush told The NewYork Times
several weeks ago. But rest assured. He
said he would "ask the people who've had
experience."
The favored presidential hopeful has

used this ploy to play down a variety of
international situations. Most recently,
after Republican senators carelessly
thumbed their noses at a Nuclear TestBan treaty last Tuesday, Bush released a
statement the next day saying he would
have no formal statement on the vote until he had consulted with advisers. The
promised press release came Thursday,
but it merely rehashed the party line.
Perhaps Bush's habitual reliance on
advisers for foreign-policy opinions
would be excusable if he intendedto educate himself on international issues before moving into the Oval Office.
But it is clear the governor has no such
plans. Bush thinks it is permissible for
the chief executive to perpetually trust
foreign affairs to a small coterie of policy
gurus. As he told Maureen Dowd of the
Times, all a president needs to know is
which foreign-policy advisors to trust and
which to "kiss off."
There are two foreseeable problems
with this pass-the-buck policy.
First, with a constantly changing global landscape, America needs a president
who knows his way around. It does not
need a chief diplomat who flounders out
of his depth across any body of water
wider than the Rio Grande.
One shudders to think of a president
who, if China invaded Taiwan, would call
up Beijing on the hotline and say things
like "kiss off."
The second problem with Bush's foror his conspicuous lack
eign policy
thereof is the ideology of the advisers
he is so eager to trust.
Admittedly, Bush has assembled an
impressive array of seasoned foreign
like
policy veterans. Most of them
Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney and Brent
Scowcroft
are holdovers from the
presidential administration of his father.
But their former job titles also make
Bush's advisers holdovers from a different diplomatic era. As Cold War veterans,
Scowcroft and company see an international balance of power as the United
States' most critical objective.
From such a perspective, any policy

Bush thinks it is permissible for
the chief executive to
perpetually trust foreign affairs
to a small coterie of policy
gurus.As he told Maureen Dowd
of the Times, all a president
needs to know is which foreignpolicy advisors to trust and
which to "kiss off."
action which jeopardizes U.S. power must
be eschewed. Translated, this approach
to foreign policy means a Bush administration would only favor external U.S.
action when America's vital interests are
at stake.
Such a stance is not as isolationist as
right-wing extremists in the Republican
Party would like it to be, but it will practically exclude humanitarian missions
and conscientious decision-making.
A realist policy would continue rosy
relations with China out of economic interest, even as human-rights abuses continue to worsen.
And it may very well signal a return to
the days when the United States gladly
supported illegitimate and unjust political regimes for the sake of stability.
Snowcroft hinted as much when he reportedly objected to the Clintonintervention in Kosovo.
According to The New Republic magazine, Snowcroft said demonizing
Milosevic "led us astray" because
"Milosevic happens to be the strongest of
the thugs down there."
This type of realpolitik may have
worked during the Cold War, but it is increasingly stale. Of course, given Bush's
ignorance of foreign affairs, Snowcroft's
boss has no way of knowing his advisory
team is comprised of diplomatic relics.
Because Bush is relying on antiquated
advisers, it will be difficult for him to
adapt to a changing world order.
The next president of the United States
will have to make sure the diplomatic
buck stops at his desk. So if Bush continues to handle foreign issues like hot "potatoes," his campaign will quickly head
south.

Test ban treaty a waste of paper

Veto of treaty negates hard work

By Dave Thomas

By Ben Schweigert
For The Phoenix

For The Phoenix
Last

week, the Senate defeated the Comprehensive Test Ban

Treaty (CTBT) in a decisive vote. Immediately, President Clinton

launched into a tirade againstRepublicans in the Senate for practicing "partisan politics," claiming that rejecting this treaty
would only lead to an increase in nuclear weapons across the
globe. After all, how could we expect the rest of the world to
sign on if we would not?
At first glance, it might seem as though the Senate had lost its
collective mind. After all, who is against preventing nuclear war?
Who is in favor of another arms race? The answer, and it should
be obvious, is no one. But Republicans did not reject the bill
because they want nuclear war, they rejected it because it is a
ridiculous and useless bill.
On the face of it, it seems like a good bill, one which prohibits
even low-grade testing, even underground. The problem comes
with the enforcement. It is incredibly easy to mask an underground explosion with a simple, small mine explosion. So, the
only way to catch people would be if they were so stupid as to
openly violate the treaty, or to willingly and openly allow UN
inspections. (And we know how well that worked in Iraq.)
The other option, that we simply trust the goodwill of countries to abide by the restrictions, is ridiculous. After all, countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq have already openly violated the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by pursuing
nuclear capabilities. And let's face it, these are the countries we
are worriedabout. Not many are worried about nuclear war with
Britain. Essentially, we are trying to ask countries not to test
weapons they were not supposed to develop in the first place.
So, what is left? A treaty with a good idea, but a useless plan of
execution. After all, many weapons need not even be tested. The
bombs that put an end to WWII had never been tested as airborne. Remember, preventing the spread of nuclear weapons
and banning the testing of those weapons are two very different
things. Personally, I am still afraid ofan untested nuclear weapon.
In the end, this treaty does nothing with regard to our adversaries, and serious harm to our own deterrentabilities. The inability to test our nuclear weapons only makes them more dangerous, not less. We would still have those weapons; the treaty
does not require us to give up ANY weapons, only to not test
them. If the bombs are going to be around, I would rather be
sure they worked.
The fact is, the US may never be able to stop North Korea, Iraq
or Iran from possessing nuclear weapons, tested or not. As long
as there is the possibility of their having nukes, I wouldrather
the US had some way of deterring nuclear war. Until a reliable
method of intercepting the missiles is devised, only our own
nuclear weapons can deter a nuclear strike. If thePresident wants
to do something about nuclear war, he should try limiting the number of nukes people have, not the safety. One tested nuke is far
less dangerous than 5 untested weapons. The CTBT is more than
just useless, it is dangerous to American safety. The Senate did
the right thing by rejecting this pointless treaty.

Sleep is
for
wussies.
Join the Phoenix staff.

The Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban

Treaty represents a huge step backwards in the struggle to
create a more secure and stable world. For years it has been
the policy of the United States to control who has access to
nuclear weapons as much as possible and to ensure that they
do not fall into trigger-happy hands. By rejecting this treaty,
the Senate risks allowing all of this work to unravel.

At present, the United States has an overwhelming advantage against every other country in the world in terms of
both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction (such as nuclear weapons). The implementation of this
treaty could do nothing but secure this advantage. Although
it is possible for both state and non-state actors (such as
Osama bin Laden or the Michigan Militia) to acquire existing nuclear weapons without conducting nuclear tests, it is
virtually impossible for any new weapons programs to be
started without nuclear testing. Indeed, even existing programs will be unable to develop without the complex computer simulation techniques that exist now almost solely in
the United States.
And the treaty does not just represent a bunch of empty
pledges from the member nations. The treaty would put in
place a world-wide network of seismic and radioactivity monitoring stations that would be able to detect nuclear explosions
anywhere on the planet, as well as an inspection procedure
for suspicious sites. Furthermore, by becoming international
law, it would allow for member nations to punish a non-compliant party to the treaty.
And although the treaty would indeed secure American
nuclear superiority, that is hardly its purpose. The United
States only needs nuclear weapons as a deterrent against other
nations with nuclear weapons.Any policy maker would agree
that, especially given the overwhelming superiority ofAmerican conventional forces, the United States would be infinitely
more secure in a world in which nuclear weapons are minimal. It is in the best interest of everyone to create a world
free of mutually assured destruction. And this cannot happen unless there is first an agreement to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons and to halt their development.
By defeating this treaty, the United States is not only giving itself the go-ahead to develop its nuclear program, but is
telling other nations to do the same. Russia and China both
explicitly said that they would not ratify the treaty if the US
did not. Similarly, prospective nuclear powers can hardly justify abandoning weapons programs when these weapons are
often the only thing that gives them the credibility to stand
up to the superpowers, who would be, after all, developing
their own nuclear stockpiles. Finally, without the treaty, we
are left with little ability to detect nuclear tests and no authority to forbid it. By voting as they did, the Senate passed
up an historic opportunity to make this world a safer place to
live.

Beware of study abroad ads
To the Editor:

The Phoenix publishes ads for foreign

study programs. It does not check with

the office for foreign study before doing
so. Students should know, therefore, that
programs that advertise in The Phoenix
may not be on the College's recommended
list.

For any program in which you may be
interested, please check with the office
for foreign study to find out whether or
not it is on our list. You may thereby spare
yourself some wasted time and effort.
Ditto for ads on bulletin boards, not to
mention the Web.

Make your voice beard.Write a letter to the editor, phoenix_letters@swarthmore.edu

What are we really doing by attending
Swarthmore College? Perhaps we are
here to get a diploma that signals our
worth to employers. How about the idea
that we are here to grow personally, intellectually and spiritually—with all three
given equal weight?
Swarthmore is presently structured so
that our primary task is academics. It is
to inherit all the ways of thinking that
have circulated amongst those who were
of the "educated" before us. Those "educated," the professors and the administration, have been given the appropriate
credentials and we paid them so that we
can interact with them. After some evaluative exchanges between the mentioned
parties, most of us graduate to be deemed
fit to be "educated" too.
I would say that the very questioning
of our role in this educational process
should be a part of liberal arts education
at Swarthmore. This task is not structured
into the institution, and the integration of
the intellectual, personal and spiritual
could also be improved.
Some solutions could include increasing support for Bond as an interfaith center and providing academic credit for
service learning. What about a faculty and
administration that explicitly conveys an
overarching philosophy behind the academic and student life support system?
We can sing a litany of student support
acronyms (WA, SAM, RA, FA, CA) but
they have yet to be linked in a coirimon
tune that helps students make more sense
of how the three components of college
life develop in relation to each other.
An even more controversial proposal
could be to create a course where every
student learns about Swarthmore, and the
institution of higher education in America
and internationally. While the analysis of
the topic would be interdisciplinary in
nature, each professor could teach the
course primarily through their own discipline, or even teach with other professors. Professors of all disciplines could
be encouraged through institutional or
outside funding to create this innovative
curriculum.
This course would be created in the true
spirit of Quaker-like self-reflection and
liberal arts interdisciplinary thinking. We
must learn how to participate wholly in a
process while being able to study and critique the very process we are participating in. This new "doublethink" is the primary responsibility for being the inheritors of the history and privilege of higher
education, and if we are to develop our
"ethical intelligence" as articulated by
President Al Bloom last spring.
This course idea in particular could
face tremendous opposition. Any sort of
student-consciousness raising about
flaws in the fundamental structure of the
institution could mean more student (or
even alumni) demands for change. And,
frankly, deep-cutting reforms would
make College employees' jobs more difficult. It's not in the interest of College
employees to encourage students to be
more critical of an institution that is supposed to please students.
So as verified through my experience
with College planning processes, the College is afraid of thinking "big." I don't
mean "big" as in expensive new science
building. I mean creative reforms that get
at the structure of governance and a different vision about what Swarthmore students should represent. My ideas are just
the beginning for how we could start
thinking "bigger" so that we can truly get
closer to our goals of educating for an
"ethical intelligence" and a "world-class
liberal arts education."

less it was an immensely agonizing time for

Krattenmaker.
"As you can imagine, being someone in your twenties and being
really into your career, the thought of having a little kid with you,
solo," he said, his voice rising again in a rapid crescendo, "is a little
bit daunting. There are a lot of tough decisions to be made there."
But he decided to take the plunge anyway. And it proved a challenging balancing act indeed.
Working at the AP Trentonbureau covering the state government
and legislature, Krattenmaker was doing what he loved the most
again, but unfortunately it also meant less time for Holland, three
years old at the time.
"Journalism is very demanding, but especially with the AP," he
said. "Because I was covering the legislature, I was often getting
home a couple of hours late. It was very unpredictable."
Gradually it became apparent to him that it was timefor a change
in lifestyle.
"It was becoming increasingly difficult to do a good job at
[parenting, and at the same time] do a good job at the AP,"
Krattenmaker said. "I decided, because of the stress the conflict
was putting on me, it was better to give up the reporting career at
that point."
After learning of a job opening for Senior Writer at the Office of
Communications at Princeton University, Krattenmaker applied
successfully for the post. After a four-year stint at Princeton,
Krattenmaker applied to become Director of Public Relations here
at Swarthmore, where he has remained.
And thus at perhaps the pinnacle of his blossoming career,
Krattenmaker made a decision that most journalists dread
he
jumped across the fence. He "sold out," as many a conscientous
journalist might put it.
Looking back at his move then, Krattenmaker is oddly unemotional. His daughter was his first priority then, he insists.
"The main reason I went for it is because I thought it would be
more conducive to single parenting," he said, "which is really the
most important thing I had going on then."
Krattenmaker even made the conscious choice of staying in
an hour-and-a-half commute from Swarthmore
Yardley, Pa.
throughout his various career moves in order to provide Holland
with a stable environment.
Recently, Krattenmaker, who had primary custody of Holland,
agreed to allowher to spend her school year with her mother, essentially switching parental prerogatives with Mary, his first wife.
Fresh from a two-day visit with his daughter, who has now spent
her past two years in California, Krattenmaker waxes a bit nostalgic.
"That was a big decision," he admitted, but "I still think it was the
right decision and I feel good about it."
Despite this, he conceded, "I still miss her a lot during those nine
months."
From Hotshot Reporter to Spin Meister
For Krattenmaker, a longtime journalist with traditional journalistic ethics, the switch to public relations was not a smooth one.
The very concept of public relations never quite resonated with
the man. In fact, he was so wary of the negative connotations of
"public relations" that last year he decided to change the name of
the Public Relations Office at Swarthmore to Office of News and
Information.
Before he even contemplated a career switch, he thought to himself, if he were to give up reporting, "it would have to be for a very
good cause."
"I could never do itfor the tobacco industry," he said, thinking out
loud. "I don't even think I could do it for a corporation that has a
neutral moral standing, if it made some product that was useful."
"I could only do it if it was something that was really good and
important," he said, "a worthy cause or institution."
And he did not find that cause on the hallowed grounds of Princeton
University. "I didn'tfeel like I fit in all that much," he said. "There
was something about it that was high-powered. It was about getting
ahead."
"When I came to Swarthmore I thought it had a lot more heart
[compared to Princeton]," said Krattenmaker, sounding more like
Oprah Winfrey than the college spokeperson he is. "I noticed something a bit more deeper and inspiring about Swarthmore. I really
feel that Swarthmore is an institution that is doing the right thing
and is a force for good in society."
In the time he has spent here, he's discovered a great passion for
Swarthmore.
"I really pull for it," he says. "I want Swarthmore to do well, I
want it to get the recognition it deserves."
Now beginning the fifth year of his tenure at Swarthmore,
Krattenmaker feels that the evolution is finally complete. Over his
four years here, he has become "a lot more intentional" in giving
out information about the College, he said.
"It's not really a 'let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may' situation at
all. We want to ensure that every media interaction is an opportunity to get the College's message across," he said. "I guess you can
call it spin, but that's a negative, negative term,"he cautioned, sounding rather like a good Catholic boy who's just heardthe f-word.

Most crucially, what makes Krattenmaker's job attractive for him
is returning to his first love.
"I still get a kick out of dealing with the media, being involved in
the news process," he said, "but from a different angle."

AKA Tom Holland
Whatever frustrations may stillbe lingering have been channeled
music, a pastime that almost took on a
life of his own. At the height of his musical career, he opened for
The Byrds at Tin Angel, a popular club in Philadelphia.
Krattenmaker was always somewhat musically inclined
becoming a performer was another one of his childhood aspirations—but he did not start playing the guitar frequently and composing
until, as he put it, "my life started falling apart," at the time of his
divorce.
Around that time, hebecame so engrossed in his emerging musical career that during the last several months as a reporter for the
AP, he would work on his lyrics while attending press conferences.
As Krattenmaker gradually made a name for himself on the Philadelphia circuit
under the stage name of Tom Holland, after his
daughter the raving reviews began to pour in. Critics compared
him to Bob Dylan and Roger McGuinn of The Byrds.
Indeed, the similarity to Dylan is obvious. Like Dylan,
Krattenmaker favors the acoustic guitar-harmonica combination.
He even lowers and coarsens his voice slightly in his vocals he
sounds nothing like the way he talks to give it a Dylanesque feel.
And following in the footsteps of the legendary beatnik,
Krattenmaker's lyrics often consist of social commentary, but unlike Dylan, his carry a much more sarcastic and cynical edge.
Consider "Shooting the Unemployed," a response to a gun-control debate in the Connecticut State Senate, in which the Republicans argued that gun-control laws would harm the local economy,
given the abundance of gun and bullet factories. The chorus of the
song reads: "Let's round up all the unemployed, get them in arow /
and put a sure-fire end to our fiscal woe / Every bullet needs a home
and death we can't avoid / Let's promote prosperity and shoot the
unemployed."
One of Krattenmaker's biggest critical hits was also a social commentary song, "Blue Patriot," dealing with post-Gulf War
triumphalism. It is an issue thatKrattenmaker gets worked upabout.
"It was very ugly," recounted Krattenmaker, his displeasure evident, referring to the domesticreaction to the US 'victory' "There
was a lot of jingoism."
He remembers reading Iraqi jokes in his local newspaper.
"It seemed to revel in the deaths of Iraqi soldiers," he said. "There
was a sort of 'we kicked their ass' mentality, and I was appalled by
it."
Besides serving as a vehicle for his political opinions,
Krattenmaker also found emotional solace in his songwriting. His
songs were an additional outlet for his "personal things."
""I've always been and [still] am closed up about personal feelings," he said, "but when it comes to songwriting, I'm brutally, brutally open."
But even brutal honesty has its limits. Just when one thinks he is
about to pour his heart out, Krattenmaker draws the line again. He
is careful to label his brand of folk music "hard folk," to distinguish
himself from his sappier counterparts.
"I didn't want to be lumped together with the mellow singersongwriters," he emphasized.
Be it slow or hard folk, once Krattenmaker's career took off, there
was no stopping him. At one point a "mover and shaker" in the Philadelphia music scene started courting him, trying to persuade him to
take his music "to the next level."
But again, his parental instincts kicked in, and with a little prodding from his then-girlfriend and now wife Caroline, he scaledback
his involvement vastly, limiting his performances to occasional gigs
at his church.
"Caroline started to point out, 'Duh! I thought you were about
being a parent,'" recalled Krattenmaker, in a quintessential
Krattenmaker tongue-in-cheek moment. '"You cannot be parent and
take your music to the nationallevel.' It was very obvious and I saw
that."
To keep his creative juices going outside of work, Krattenmaker
still freelances for several publications, including the Swarthmore
and Princeton alumni bulletins. And during his daily commute to
and from Yardley, he tends to his virtual sports leagues on his laptop.
Among his imaginary teams are the Minneapolis Lakers.
"Thanks to themiracle of fantasy sports, I've restored the Lakers
to their proper place," he said (The Lakers originated in Minneapolis but moved to Los Angeles in the 60s).
And there's also wiffie ball. It's a brand new tradition in the Community Resources Center (CRC). Krattenmaker and his staff have
organized a weekly wiffie ball game in the CRC open space, right
outside their new offices.
Informed of a student's surprised reaction upon witnessing senior staff members indulging in a moment of "goofiness,"
Krattenmaker mused, "Well, it just goes to show that you can't stereotype adult admimstrator types."
And he's right.

'Fight Club'
anarchy for
dummies
I rented a lot of teen movies over
break—they were inanely satisfying, had
soundtracks I can recall more easily than
their plotlines and almost made me think
I missed being a virgin—and then I went
and saw "Fight Club."
A lot of people have been asking me
what I thought of it and I haven't known
what to tell them. I want to say that I liked
it because of the absolutely brilliant black
comedy of the film's first forty-five minutes (in that first third, "Fight Club" is,
just the way Ed Norton promised, "The
Graduate" rethunk as a nightmarish music video, all at once very funny and very
sad and very scary) and because I want
to say I liked it because it's fun to use the
words it would take to describe liking it:
wordslike "incendiary," "shocking," searing," "explosive," "subversive," "radical,"
words with exclamation points built into
them.
But the fact of the matter is that, in its
final seventy-five minutes, "Fight Club"
is a movie that despite its best pretensions
gets increasingly ridiculous and increasingly sucky. It's not just that director
David Fincher's movies ("Aliens 3,"
"Seven," "The Game") have this tendency
to go all shitty near the end. It's not just
that I resented being lectured to by Brad
Pitt about how I am not my khakis. And
it's not the finale's over determined
Keyzer Soze-style plot twist, which imbues the film not with added depth but
rather a viral incoherence that spreads
backwards to the opening credits. It's
something else, but I'm not sure what.
To read "Fight Club" as satire rather
than manifesto may save it from accusations of fascism. In the end, it critiques
the basement brand of violent anarchism
shown as dangerously misleading and literally mind-numbing— not liberating at
all.
But satire cannot save the movie from
itself. The film actually seems to take
seriously a kind of testosterone Marxism,
some hokum about men being hunters
condemned by late capitalism to be shoppers and spectators. Its best tricks expose
the way we the audience are just sitting
on our asses in the theater, inert, dumb,
being IV-fed entertainment—like when
Edward Norton points out that the little
dot in the upper-left-hand corner of the
screen signals the projectionist to change
the film reel—but it's much more enamored of its own alienation-emasculation
minstrel show.
The film looks like something new—visually, it's black ice, like one critic said,
dark and menacing and glistening and
slick—but it ain't got anything new to say,
well, about anything. It's just anarchy for
dummies, punk for poseurs. The film
maybe works at the start as a perverse
coming-of-age bit, as Fincher himself has
suggested, but it's IQ is way too low and
its position as Hollywood blockbuster way
too compromised to provoke as a political piece. But maybe I just dislike it because it's fun to say the words: "ridiculous," "sucky," "incoherent," "compromised."
This has all gotten me to thinking: Why
do some movies get dubbed 'The Films
ThatDefine a Generation,' and how do we
trade them in for better ones? We're a

'Sensation' explores limits of art
By Brendan Karch
Phoenix Staff
By now everyone knows the story.
Rudolph Guiliani takes offense to a Virgin Mary adorned with elephant dung
at the Brooklyn Museum's new "Sensation" exhibit and threatens to cut off
funding. He ignites a laughable legal
controversy and manages to turn sixty
percent of New York against him. Unrelenting, he threatens further action
this time to terminate the museum's
lease and fire its board of directors.
He appears on national TV to flex his
moral muscle and criticize his Senate
opponent, Hillary Clinton.
All this, mind you, and the mayor
hasn't even seen the exhibit.
With all the brouhaha in Brooklyn,
it is obvious that what has been most
neglected is the art itself. One hundred
works by over forty different young
British artists take up almost two
floors of the Brooklyn Museum. As I
waited to see "Sensation" in a long line
in driving rain, amid chattering New
Yorkers, I wondered if the exhibit was
anything more than Big Apple hype.
Much to my surprise, "Sensation"
managed to be thought-provoking and
substantive and offensive all at once.
The artworks reveal a body of young
artists that are disenfranchised, disgruntled, angry, playful, morbid and
perverted. Their art, in running such
a gamut of emotions, is strong, complex and often confused.
At first glance, many of the works
simply shock and disgust. Wall-sized
sketches of female genitalia, animals
in formaldehyde and castrated mannequins are only a few of the grandiose
pieces. While smaller artworks
complement the behemoths, the exhibit is clearly preoccupied with big
and bold.
In the entrance gallery sits a seventeen-foot-long glass case containing a
tiger shark in formaldehyde. In another gallery, the same artist presents
ten cross-sections of different cows in
separate glass cases. The display allows the viewer to get in between two
cross-sections and viewthe disgusting,
intricate innards of the bovine species.
A whole sheep and a sliced pig are also
-

on display.
Another set of resounding works
perverts girl mannequins by warping
their bodies and joining them together
in awkward ways. Many of the girls
have penises for noses and gaping, vagina-like holes for mouths, not to mention legs for arms and vice-versa. In
one of the two sculptures the girls are
joined in a ring of melted acrylic, with
two girls kissing so that one's "nose"
penetrates the other's "mouth."
With such visually repulsive works,
what is to be made of Chris Olifi's infamous "Holy Virgin Mary"? Despite
the petrified elephant dung (which is
a sign of sustenance in some African
cultures), and, more noticeably, the
dozens of vaginas cut from pornographic magazines and pasted onto the
canvas, the Virgin Mary is one of the
more aesthetically pleasing pieces in
the exhibit.
The glittering, purple-clad Mary,
highly stylized and with an exaggerated, chocolate face, is placed against
an equally glittering, muted orange
background. Olifi uses millions of paint
specs, rather than brush strokes, to
give the work a radiance that even the
vaginas can't ruin.

Holy Virgin Mary"
By Chris Olifi
Even if the Virgin Mary isn't repulsive, the rest of these artists are just
out to turn our stomachs, right? Well,
not exactly. What is inherent in many
of the works, even the most revolting
ones, is an awareness and a challenging of the history of art. For example,
the dead animals and their encasing
resemble minimalist sculpture. Mutilated mannequins are styled after a
Goya portrait. One painting is a Dali
replica, edited and censored to the
artist's taste. Another canvas skews a
classic Poussin. And several works
are clearly influenced by Andy
Warhol.
Among the myriad works that don't
offend, and that don't draw directly
on older artists, many provoke deep
questions about art and its limitations.
One entire room is devoted to dozens
of sculptures that were molded from

tive and negative space. Here, those
conceptions and questions are given
a new and fresh twist.
Another room is devoted mainly to
life-sized horse portraits on stark
white canvases that question the conflict between detachmentand verism.
Another work has been put into a tent,
forcing the viewer to crouch low to
see it, and challenging the museum
painting-on-the-wall mentality.
The show is chock-full of such
thought-provoking pieces. Admittedly, there is little stylistic or ideological coherence to the exhibit, and "The Physical Impossibility of Death in the

20th century marks
orchestra's opening
By George Macros
For The Phoenix
The Philadelphia Orchestra began its 1999-2000
season with a month of predominantly 20th century music led by maestro Wolfgang Sawallish. In
commemoration of their 100th anniversary, they
revisited important works they had premiered in
the United States under previous conductors, such
as Eugene Ormandy and Leopold Stokowski.
On Sept. 25, the program started with the instrumental arrangement of a Suite from Stravinsky's
1920 theatre work, "Pulcinella." The first of
Stravinsky's "neoclassical" works, "Pulcinella" has
strong ties to the musical traditions of previous
centuries, most noticeable in the baroque style orchestra consisting of 33 members.
Pianist Boris Berezovsky performed the
Shostakovich "Piano Concerto No. 1." This jubilant
piece borders on delirium, and features the sense
of humor of a composer most oftenknown for his
morose symphonic moments. Berezovsky fit the
mold of this concerto wonderfully with a bubbling
rendition. David Bilger played the prominent solo
trumpet part with precision. Pianist Eugene List
gave the U.S. premiere of this concerto under the
direction of Stokowski in 1934.
The program closed with Maurice Ravel's "Bolero." This engrossing piece begins from nothing
and gradually crescendos for approximately seventeen minutes before erupting. The champion of
this piece was the snare drum player who provided
a flawless rhythmic backbone for its duration.The
orchestra gave a deftperformance on a large scale,
but seemed to forgo individual colorations.
The Oct. 16 concert began with the Rachmaninoff
PianoConcerto No. 2 performed by Ivo Pogorelich.
Born in Belgrade, Pogorelich studied at the Central School of Music as well as the Tchaikovsky
Conservatory and made his debut in 1981 at
Carnegie Hall. Throughout his career, Pogorelich
has pursued humanitarian ends both independently
and with UNESCO, even serving as their ambassador of goodwill at one time.
With the length of the piano parallel to the edge
of the stage, the sound carried poorly to those who
had a view of his back. In many sections, the orchestra drowned him out, and even when playing
alone, the full sound of the piano did not reach.
This program ended with another piece premiered in the U.S. by the Philadelphia Orchestra,
this time directed by Ormandy on New Year's Day,
1971. Shostakovich's Symphony No. 14, written
approximately 35 years after his First Piano Concerto, shows a drastically-matured Shostakovich
addressing the theme of death. More of a song cycle
and less of a symphony, this work featured soprano
Christine Brewer and baritone Hakan Hagegard.
The combination of dramatic death lyrics and dramatic death music proved overwhelming. Compared to the moments of extreme austerity, the
breaks of humor stood at the opposite pole of depression.

Superheroes reign in fresh 'Astro City'
the world from ending.
In "The Confessor," Brian Kinney is a
young man who desperately wants to be
a part of the superhero scene. He leaves
his home and a father he has no fond
memories of, to make a name for himself
in Astro City. The story begins with
Kinney getting used to the city and his
attempts to become one of "them." By
issue #5, he's an apprentice to the mysterious Confessor, stopping car-jackers, and
trying to solve mysteries such as who's
the Shadow Hill killer. Kinney also has
his own mystery to solve: who is the Confessor, really? And while he starts to find
some disturbing answers, all of Astro
City's resident superheroes are faced
with a growing hysteria against them, in
response to the still-on-the-loose Shadow
Hill killer.
What's oh-so-good: AC is top dog at combining the old-school superhero bit, with
an incredibly fresh perspective. It's a superhero book, but each storyline is told
with a different point of view: a city resident, the heroes themselves, or even the
villains. "The Confessor" is seen from
Kinney's eyes, and thereader must, therefore, deal with a young man's fears and
dreams as he struggles with his present
and past. And it's never the same core
cast ofcharacters either.Kurt Busiek has
created a whole city full of people; he's
not going to limit himself, or the reader,
to just a handful.

Everyone in the whole darn industry,
by the way, loves Busiek. This man is on
everyone's "Top Writers in Comics" list
and AC shows why. The whole creative
team, including penciler Anderson and
inker Blyberg, has won numerous Eisner

Awards (like the Oscars for comics) for
their work on this book. The artwork is
clean and smooth; there is great use of
vibrant colors. And to top it off, the
monthly cover artist is Alex Ross, multiple Eisner awards recipient and painterextraodinaire.
What's not-so-good: The lengthy
storylines tend to drag on. "The Confessor" is six issues long, and probably could
have been told in four or five. This also
makes it more difficult for someone picking up the book for the first time. The selfcontained storylines mean you don't have
to follow the book religiously, but you
might be confused if you pick up only issue #7, for example. Also, Busiek has
fallen behind schedule before, for legit
reasons, so one can't always count on the
AC books getting out on time.
The final word: It's a good book and the
fact that you don't have to be a monthly
collector to appreciate the book makes it
great for a once-in-awhile sorta read. The
series is up to #2O and "The Confessor" is
my favorite storyline thus far. But knowing Busiek's track record, there will be
many more brilliant ones to come.

Harsh violence of 'Fight Club' a necessary evil
stroy Norton's scheme. She makes it impossible for him
to pretend: he can't cry, can't sleep. His concern over
Maria's intrusion, however, turns out to be the least of
his worries when he returns home to find his condo a
heap of smoldering rubble on the street umpteen stories below. Needing a place to crash, he spontaneously
calls Tyler Durden, a soap-selling, pimped-out vigilantetype who earlier sat near him on an airplane.
After meeting Pitt's Durden in a sleazy bar and exchanging their philosophies on life and a few punches
in the parking lot, Norton accompanies him to his dilapidated, probably condemned, home. Following a series of humorously creepy events, Durden and Norton
become the best of friends, Norton's job and life take a
serious nosedive and Helena Bonham Carter's smutty,
Durden-obsessed thrift queen provides the movie's only,
very trashy, portrayal of womanhood. Having incited
the interest of several pubmates, Norton and Durden
decide to start a club: the beat-the-living-hell-out-ofeach-other-in-a-bar-basement-at-midnight club, or, as
Tyler cleverly dubs it, Fight Club.

MOVIE REVIEW

By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff
The previews are over and the screen is rushing at
my face. My head swims, drowning in biological imagery. I'm back in high school science class, studying the
components of the brain. Again, the screen melts, twists.
I feel like I'm falling. My eyes refuse to focus until, at
last, the camera halts, zooming in on Edward Norton's
beaten, sweaty face, his mouth contorted around the
barrel of a gun. The theater fills with his sullen voice,
spurring a sudden flashback to elucidate this nameless
narrator and his precarious situation. In a swirl of brilliant technique, the story unfolds, divulging splotches
of plot in timed-release: just enough to maintain the
viewers' interest. Meanwhile, sensory projections
threaten to engulf the room.
"Fight Club" begins as a basic description of Edward
Norton's typical life. A lower-level businessman, Norton
is constantly moving, earning big dollars for another
pair of CK Jeans or the designer sofa he's been coveting. Despite his effort to buy himself a happy little life,
Norton is miserable. He can't sleep, can't have a good
time, and can't find meaning in his life. Battling his debilitating insomnia, Norton starts attending support
groups for diseases that he doesn't really have: parasites, tuberculosis, sickle-cell anemia, and, the best, testicular cancer. The meetings give Norton release that
lets him cry. Soon, Norton can sleep, work, enjoy life

After 15 years of total dedication, Willis and Pfeiffer scramble to find just one more
reason not to bag their messed-up marriage. Not quite the sap story of"Random

that's lost its spark.

7:30,10:30

A thriller narrating the pathetic life of a man controlled by secular society who latches on
to a more powerful being in an attempt to improve himself, and displays his new power in
disturbingly violent outbursts. If you can get past the graphic content and abrupt twists,
it's an enticing thought-provoker. If not, at least it's packed with outstanding special effects.

An in-depth version of the Saturday Night Live skit,"Superstar" delves into the making of
the odd but entertaining Mary Katherine Gallagher. It's definitely not a movie to be taken
seriously; even the humor could prove marginal. There's only so much Mary Katherine a

Director David Fincher has been criticized for the film's violence, especially
in light of the Littleton incident. Without
the callousness, however, much of "Fight
Club" would be lost. The film is all about
breaking dependence and gaining inner
strength, and the violence, brutal as it
gets, is crucial to the plot. Other things,
like the penis shot at the end of the show,
are less essential. The storyline is slightly
rocky, but the message is strong and pervasive. If Fincher did indeed create a
mess as he's been accused, it's a debacle
worth fighting for.

Men's Ultimate goes 4-0 at CFCC, tied for

1999

no. 1 seed

Earthworms to host second leg showdown of tournament against U. of Delaware
By Matt Murphy
For The Phoenix
Swarthmore's Men's Ultimate team is coming off
an undefeated first leg of
the Chesapeake Fall ColChampionship
lege
(CFCC). The Earthworms
scored two wins against
the large universities of
Maryland and Richmond,
as well as a forfeit win and
a game against a pick-up
team. The team will be
preparing to host the
tournament's second leg at
home. The major showdown will be at 12:00 PM
on Sunday against the undefeated University of
Delaware.
Fall break ended one day
early for the seventeen
men of the Ultimate team,
who traveled down to Annapolis, Maryland on Sunday to compete in the first
leg of the CFCC.
The tournament included 16 teams from the
DC area, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and
Delaware, who will compete in round-robin fashion until the single elimination tournament on November 14.
Upon arriving in Annapolis, the men were informed that St. Mary's had
not arrived. In their place,
a team was createdfeaturing five first-year players
from Swarthmore and five
new players from Navy.
This team, "Swavy," was
the first opponent of the
Swarthmore A team, and
the score was appropriately 15-4 in the A team's
favor in a very enjoyable
game for both sides.
The next game was the
Earthworms' toughest
matchup of the day,
against the University of

Maryland. It was the closest game the men had
played so far this year.
After being down 9-6 at
half-time in the game(first
to 15 wins), Swarthmore
fought back to tie it at 9.
The teams traded points as
the game was tied at 9,10,
11, 12 and 13 before the
Worms were able to take
the last two points and se-

cure their most impressive
victory of the past two

years.
Next on the docket was
a strong University of
Richmond team, whichthe
Earthworms will face
again at the Fall National
Invitationals in North
Carolina in 2 weeks.
Swarthmore seemed to be
tired by the emotional vie-

tory over Maryland and
fell behind early. Yet they
rallied back, going up 8-5
at half-time. The teams
each went on small runs,
but Richmond never got
close enough to tie; the
Earthworms picked up
their third victory of the
day with a 15-12 win.
Swarthmore's fourthopponent, the University of

Virginia, had lost three
straight and chose to go
home rather than to play
the final game. Consequently, the Earthworms
were credited with their
fourth win of the day. Thus
ended the first undefeated
tournament
for
Swarthmore in over two
years, leaving the men full
of hope for the second leg

of the CFCC, whichis to be
held at Swarthmore this
Sunday.
The University of Delaware also went 4-0 this
weekend, leading to the
showdown for the #1 seed
going into the single-elimination tournament at
CunninghamField (assuming it does not rain). Don't
miss it.

Media hype surrounds
otherwise dull World Series
By Patricia Barrientos
Phoenix Staff
The baseball world is trying to make this World Series more exciting than it really is when by the nature
of the game, the fanbase was greatly reduced after the
Division Series. All four teams moving on to the second
round of the playoffs were from the East coast. At least,
there was some intrigue in the New York Yankees-Boston Red Sox series mostly due to the urban legend of
the "Bambino curse." It would have made a nice story is
the "curse" had been reversed withthe team that started
it in the first place. Yet, Boston Red Sox fans and players alike can complain all they want about the inferior
umpiring, but ultimately as often is the case, the better
team wins. As for the National League series, the Atlanta Braves were suppose to sweep the NewYork Mets..
Who would have known that every game except for the
first would be decided by one run. Although the Braves
jumped to an early 3-0 game lead, those wins could have
gone either way. Then the final two games were true
nail-bitters any sports fan would have enjoyed. After
that series, which will be heading its way into the baseball record books, the World Series is destined to be a
bore. Additionally, though the Yankees are very popular, their fanbase is as large as their hatebase and the
Braves are not everyone's darlings.
In order to improve television ratings, going to the
ballpark, selling newspapers, and tuning on the radio,
the Team of the Decade debate is headlining this year's
Fall Classic. The 1995 World Series ring ofAtlanta General Manager John Schuerholz appropriately has "Team
of the 90s" engraved on it—this ring and title belongs to
the Atlanta Braves franchise. Even if the Braves were
to lose to the NewYork Yankees, they still have claim to
that title.The Braves are the proud owners of most regular season wins by a team this decade, three former Cy
Young Award winners, eight straight division titles, five

trips to the "Big Dance" and yes, only one ring but no
other team can challenge their dominance. That said,
why is there a media frenzy on the topic? Obviously, the
Subway Series between the two New York teams, the
Mets and the Yankees, would have generated much more
attention and television viewers, albeit only in the New
York-New Jersey-Connecticut area and among the countless relocated New Yorkers.
At least last year, people tuned in to the games just to
see if the Yankees would fall flat on their faces Of
course, they did not, making therecord setting 114 wins
during the regular season more of a feat and not a fluke.
Nonetheless, the four-game sweep did not help the television ratings; they were the lowest in recent years. This
year, the folks at NBC will be crossing their fingers for
a long series.
Will a rematch of the 1996 Series team participants
be eventful? A comparison of that Series and the 1999
teams cannot be made considering team members have
changed. The idea of the Braves "stepping up" their
game to take care of the Yankees unlike last time, is
useless. Mark Wohlers will not be serving up a slider
turned into a three-run homer by Jim Leyritz and Kenny
Rogers will not be giving up six runs in the first four
innings. The Braves have added the likes of Kevin
Millwood, John Rocker, Brian Jordan, and Gerald Williams whilethe Yankees have Orlando Hernandez, Roger
Clements, Chuck Knoblauch, and Scott Brosius.
Much has changed and catchy conceptions to attract attention such as which team will win the Team of
the Decade title or check out which team will send the
knockout punch in the rematch of Braves versus Yankees in the baseball ring will not spice up this seemingly colorless Series.
While many fans will be tuning out of the big-market matchup, others will be watching and enjoying the
coming games for what they are— the 1999 World Series.

Sari Altschuler
For The Phoenix
Women's soccer team
has played hard in the last
several games, although
the score results have not
reflected this effort.
Outside of the conference, the team has not only
played well but also won.
The team posted impressive
wins
against
Immaculata (7-2) and
Neumann (3-2), showing
Swarthmore can perform.
In the first game,
Swarthmore out-shot
Immaculata 22 to 3. Individual goals were scored
by Heather Marandola 'Ol,
Erica Kaufman 'O3, Emily
Manetta 'OO and Marah
Gotcsik 'O2, while E.B.
Fortier 'O3 had a hat trick.
Swarthmore similarly
dominated the game
against Neumann, firing
twenty-two shots in the
first half alone (45 total)
and allowing Neumann
only eighteen. Despite this
disparity, Swarthmore had
difficulty settling the
score until late in the second half.
The rest of the recent
games boast only one conference win. On October
14th, Swarthmore beat
Washington College 2-0
with both goals put away

by Claire Hoverman 'O3.
Otherwise, the record
shows a number of wellplayed games which ended
in difficult loses for the
Garnet women. These
games include: Franklin
and Marshall (5-0), Western Maryland, ranked
number one in the conference (6-0), New York University (2-0) and Villa Julie
(4-1).

The women's soccer

team has many players

who perform well individually, yet their difficulties lie with injuries and
scarce scoring. E.B.
Fortier 'O3, who had been
the Garnet's leading
scorer and who boasted
the title of Centennial Conference player of the week
earlier in the season, was
plagued by a concussion
and unable to compete for
over two weeks. She finally returns to the team
this week. Stepping up in
her absence has been
Claire Hoverman 'O3, who
gained a place on the Centennial Conference Honor
Roll this week after scoring five of the team's last
seven goals.
Meanwhile, the defensive
support of Becca Schmitt
'OO, Michelle Lowry 'O2, Nia
Wright 'OO, Karly Ford 'O3,
Erica Kaufmann 'O3 and

Lizzy Pike 'O3 has been
strong. Likewise, Heather
Marandola 'Ol, captain Sarah Jay 'Ol, Marah Gotcsik
'O2, Annalise Paaby 'OO, Liz
Brainard 'O3 and Caroline
Lorenza 'O3 have been playing forcefully in the
midfield, though the team's
luck has not seemed to fully
reflect these efforts.
The team, however, remains hopefully and upbeat about the rest of the
season. Jay says the team
is overdue for some success. "It's just going to take
some time. I think everyone is working really hard
out there and hopefully the
scores will start to show all
the effort," she said. "At
this point, we all really
want some wins and I think
we're ready to play so we
can get them."
As a young team with a
new coach, this fall has
been a learning season and
the team hopes to take the
experiences gained this
year on with them into the
upcoming seasons.
The team's overall
record for the season is 69 and 1-5 in the conference.
The team takes on
Gettysburg at home this
Saturday at 1 PM and
Haverford the following
Saturday at the Fords
home field.

The Swarthmore Cross-Country Project
By

Josh Bloom

For The Phoenix

On October 2, 1999, twentyone Swarthmore runners disappeared into the woods of Maryland. Five days later their results were found.
Here's a survivors account: In
the heights of Maryland's western hills, the Swarthmore Crosscountry team competed on the
Frostburg course. Although
beautiful in its landscape, the
course seemed simple, mundane, containing no dangers. It
just had low-cut grass, small
hills, and no cultic, goat-worshipping Fords.
Yet things were not what they
seemed. The Frostburg run
turned out to be one of the most
adrenaline-filled projects some
Swatties had ever completed in
in their lives (perhaps explaining why so many ran their fastest ever cross country times).
On the warm-up, Joko
Agunloye 'Ol
demanded,
"Alright, who's got the course
map?" Mysteriously, no one
claimed to have it. After a few
minutes, Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol
dropped to the forest ground,
laughing maniacally, twitching
joyfully. He squeaked: "Your
missing map... I snot-ragged
that thing twenty minutes ago."
The teams were to run unguided,
effectively undone by a brute
who over-dosed on Krispy
Kremes; the harriers were to
madly rush to a finish that might
have been their last.
At two separate times, with
much bric-a-brac, Swarthmore
found its members lined up on a
starting line two hundred people
long. First the women were
called, then the men. Everyone
found themselves nervous, hot,
about-to-be-tired, and scared.
Very scared. No one had been to
Frostburg before; no one knew
what secrets lay under its piney

finishers. But then, the women
required only 5K to get out.
The men—led by trash-talking
punks such as Liam O'Neill 'OO
and Marc Jeuland '01 —ended up
taunting other teams for too
long. In their distraction, they
lost their way and were bewitched into confusion. They
found themselves needing to run
over the same ground twice because the course had loops.
On a hill-side house the races
ended; many collapsed, as if hit
from behind. There the last

Then the ritual began. Guns
fired, teams fled all through the
grayish-green pines that made
up Frostburg State Forest, and
the harriers found that it took
them at least 15 hunger-filled
minutes to get out of those
woods.
The women, more willful than
the men, found their way home
in less time. They escaped in as
fast as nineteen minutes to
longer times that—although
longer—still beat the best men's

records of their races were
found, though other information
was missing:
Women's SK, 201 runners. Survivors: Agunloye in 4th (19:09),
Karen Lloyd 'OO in 19th (19:46),
Alissa Parmelee 'Ol in 48th
(20:39), Alicia Googins 'OO in 58th
(20:51), Christen Lungren 'O2
(21:23), Shalini Ayagari 'OO, and
Jessica George 'OO.
Men's BK, 217 runners. Survivors included: O'Neill in 4th
place (26:17), Jeuland in 6th
place (26:20), Jeff Doyon 'OO in

37th (27:37), Marc Niermann 'Ol

(27:38), Josh Bloom 'OO in 49th
(27:54), Joseph Makin 'O3 (28:29),

and Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol
(30:50).

After they underwent cryo-

genic resuscitation, both teams
competed at Dickinson on Satur-

day, October 9th. Those results,
along with the break and postbreak race results—from
Gettysburg, Allentown, Tufts &
Seven Sisters—will all be forthcoming in a flood of cross country extravaganza results.
