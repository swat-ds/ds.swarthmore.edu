New CIVIC leaders turn to volunteer training
By Mark Kernlghan
CIVIC, theumbrella organization for all college-funded student
volunteer groups, will temporarily
cut down on volunteer activity in
order to step up training, according
tothis year's new coordinators, Alix
Webb '92 and CarolynStillwell '92.
The coordinators, who graduated with degrees in art history, will
act as a team, almost as a single
person. "This is one job with two
people doing it," saidStillwell. "We
even finisheachother's sentences."
Webb and Stillwell will focus
on "needs that have been expressed
for several years" and carry on the
reforms of Serge Francis '9l, said
Webb. Francois stepped down this
year after two years as coordinator.
"Each coordinator has put her
orhis own imprint on theposition of
CIVIC. Serge made a major impact," said Associate Dean Bob
Gross, thechairmanof theCommunity Services Advisory Board and
CIVIC's chief link to the administration. Gross said that this semester, CIVIC would try out Francis's
most radical proposal, known as the
"BigRevolutionary Idea:" suspend
volunteer work temporarily so that
volunteers who feel frightened or
underqualified can come to the job
better prepared.
In thepast, volunteer activities
began in early September with an
introductory week of training that
gavethefalse impression that "after

the training, you're ready to go out
and become a perfect volunteer,"
said Webb. This year, on CIVIC's
orders, new students will waituntil
the second semester and all groups
will
until after October
break so that volunteers can be
trained by coordinators during the
weekend of October 2-3.
The coordinators added that
training would continue throughout the student's volunteer work,
and that CIVIC plans to team up
with the Pennsylvania Campus
Compact, a government-spawned
national organization chapter that
trains volunteers and explores the
relationship between service and
higher education.
Grosssaid thatvolunteersneed
training in "the technical skills...to
connect with kids of a particular
age," as well as "how to enter a
community and maintain a relationship of mutual respect" and an
understanding of "the culture of a
community...from a different perspective than that of a student" He
added thatthe October training will
cover first aid and CPR.

volunteerprocess...and making sure
the programs are working," said
Stillwell.
Webb said that "burnout has
been a really big problem" because
some projects have been loosely
organized while others don't fully
understand the needs of the communities they serve, such as Chester.

Gross favors a "win-win" approach
that "balances the benefit to the
students and to the community."
"We 're inviting bumed-out or
frustrated volunteers to come back
and take another look," said
Stillwell. Webb added that CIVIC
will encourage former volunteers
to "share their experiences, both

good and bad."
Webb believes that, while the
volunteer spirit ofSwarthmore is in
flux, CIVIC is fairly stable. "There
have been changes in the college in
terms of an [increasing] interest in
service," she said."One ofthe things
we're trying to do is create continuity."

Angry exit '
leaves student
with 25 stitches
'

Student, library both sustain injuries
By Ligeia Jennis
and Andy Perrin
A student sustained serious injuries Monday evening while
exiting McCabe Library when he missed thedoor handle and hit a
glass door with enough force to shatter it.
According to Public Safety officerFred Martino, "...a student
was angry or upset and put his arm through the window at McCabe."
Diane van Roden, who was sitting at the desk near the entrance
when the incident occurred, said, "He hit with a tremendous amount
of force. I think he was very angry about something....there was
glass all over." VanRoden praised both Security and theambulance
for prompt arrivals.
The first medical assistance to the student was from other
students, according to McCabe CirculationLibrarian LibbyAmarm.
But a security van and a Taylor Hospital ambulancearrived "quickly."
The student walked to the ambulance and was transported to
the Crozer Chester Medical Center, where he was treated for
"severe cuts on both arms."
Ellen Holloman '95, another witness, was worried that the
"ambulance took 15 minutes" to arrive; "...what if this were someone with a heart attack?" she asked.
Holloman said the students who offered first aid, Bosi Cohen
'94 and Susan Daily '94, were there "immediately and remained
totally calm." The student was treated for his injuries at Crozer
Chester Medical Center, receiving a total of 25 stitches, and was
released.
, Romana Khan '94, a friend of the victim, said "he looks fine.
A little shaken, but fine." She said the victim found that "it hurts
more now than it did at the time."

Alcohol program targets women
By College Press Service

TROY, NewYork—ln some of the women's restrooms at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, bright, highly
visual posters can be found that tout the effects of alcohol on female sexual satisfaction, skin conditions,
professional success, weight gain, self-esteem and pregnancy.
The powerful graphics, which were created to target women, are part of a research project by Michael
Calsher, associate professor ofpsychology at Rensselaer, who studies the effects of alcohol on male and female
college students.
The posters, which also hang in sorority houses and dormitories, also note, for example, that a daily glass
of wine can boost your weight 10pounds a year, that frequent heavy drinking can lead to bulimia, and that even
moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer.
"Our research has shown that posters with information that is optimally relevant to the needs of specific
target groups are more likely to attract attention and increase knowledge," said Kalsher. "By doing so, they can
set the occasion for making wiser alcohol-related decisions."
The research team found that women exposed to the posters scored significantly higher on alcohol
education tests than control groups that did not see the posters. The women rated the posters as "very helpful"
for making choices about whether to drink alcohol or not

Special Security Report
The campus has been hit with a rash ofbike thefts since students have returned

to campus. A total of seven bikes have been stolen as of the writing of this report

Most of the thefts occurred in the inner campus: Wharton, Dana-Hallowell, and
Parrish lawn. Three of thebikes had been locked prior to theft.
A white pick-up truck with Pennsylvania tags was seen at approximately 10
p.m. near Clothier. The occupants: an African-Americanmale driverwithblack hair

Some Theft Prevention Tips:
a) LOCK YOUR BIKE with a quality lock. There are good locks for sale at the
college book store.
b) If you have removable wheels or similar items, take them to your dorm.
c) Secure your bike to a sturdy object.
d) Getyour bike registered withPublic Safety. Call xB2Bl to set up the
appointment There are stickers and engraving (if you wish) can be donewhile
you wait
e) Mark your bike in a hidden spot with information that only you can identify.
f) Report any or all suspicious activity to Public Safety immediately. Emergencies

Environmentalist to give
the year's first lecture
By Eli Rubin and April Chan

Environmentalist Bill McKibben, wellknown for hisbelief that nature will soon be
destroyed by humans, has been invited to
give an address at Swarthmore College on
September 21.
The talk, entitled"Desire and Nature,"
will be held from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. in the
Scott Outdoor Amphitheater (Pearson Hall
Theater in event of rain). According to
Associate Provost Mark Jacobs, who invited McKibben to speak at the College, the
talk will address the theme of"how human
desire should perhaps be readjusted with
respect to nature...[resulting in] renewing
our ties with nature and our understanding
of what lessons nature, as opposed to what
TV and our current informationflow, teaches
us."
Jacobs, who was namedAssociateProvost this year, was asked by the senior
administration to invite someone who would
"set theintellectual tone for the school year."
Jacobs, in an interview with The Phoenix,
stated that he selected McKibben because,
"As a biologist concerned with the totally
humanocentric way most of us live our
lives, I wanted to bring in someone who
could address the apparent problem many
humans have in acknowledging, and interacting with, theirnon-humanenvironment."
McKibben will begin his stay at
Swarthmore with a lunch meeting with students who were involved in the Eastern
Forest Project. After his talk, there will be
a reception open to all from 5:30 to 6:30
p.m. After dinner at the President's house,
from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., he will hold an
informal chat with any interested students.
Although McKibben is not as well
known as lastyear' s first speaker,Bill Cosby,
Jacobsfeels strongly about the importance

and relevance ofMcKibben's views.
"I have a real interest in trying to shake
students, particularly in the introductorybiology course, out of whatI suspect for many of
them is a very humanocentric view oflife....
I found that every time I've read one of
[McKibben's] articles, I found a very sympathetic voice to a lotof deepfeelings I have that
I have not necessarily put into words myself."
"I think," Jacobs continues, "it's actually important particularly to a liberal arts
college [to hear McKibben speak]. I think
that in the middle of thenecessary and important introspective discussions we have all the
time at this college about humans, for humans, of humans, it's very, very good and
important for all of us to remember that there
is another way to look at the planet that
doesn't put humans at the center. And of
course, one of McKibben's points is that by
putting humans at the center for so long we've
helped start what hecalls the 'end ofnature.'"
After receiving a bachelor's degree from
Harvard in 1982, McKibben became a staff
writer for The New Yorker.
Since 1987,he has been a freelance writer.
He lives withhis family in the
of
New York State and is a lay leader at his
Methodist church, as well as treasurer of the
local fire department
Though currently involved with his
Guggenheim award entitled "The EnvironmentalProblems ofSustainableDevelopment,"
McKibben agreed to accept Swarthmore's invitation.
"He knows about Swarthmore and about
the students who have been working on the
Eastern Forest Project challenging the forest
service to take greater account of the environmental impact oflogging," Jacobs said, adding
that he hoped McKibben would give students
some interesting discussion.

College hiring practices
bring student criticism
'to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable'
By Andy Perrin
The recent spate of new hirings on campus has brought to the forefront the question
ofhow Swarthmore finds new staff
how
hiring criteria are determined, who sits on
hiring committees, and so on.
Three years ago, when the College was
searching for a new President, the search
committee spent countless hours looking for
candidates, reading resumes and recommendations, and interviewing. Toward the endof
the search, the committee asked groups of
students, faculty, and staff to interview the
finalists and participate in the decision process.
Similarly, two other recent hirings
the new Dean of the College and the new
Dean of Admissions—incorporated the same
concernforopenness and representation. Each
of the committees met for months and made
a genuine effort to includevarious sections of
the campus community.
Significantconcerns, however, have been
voiced about two other recent personnel
changes.
I started this column because of a personal concern over the replacement ofSerge
Francois as director of CIVIC, the College
volunteerprogram. I felt that there had been
a danger of the process becoming closed to
important voices from students and others
involved in community service work. Upon
investigating the situation, I found that the
job description and expectations had been
significantly changed with little or no student
involvement. The dean's office had determined thatthe position needed changing, so it
was changed.
That's a problem. CIVIC was started
severalyears ago as an office for facilitating
student initiatives in community service and
social change. The fact that it proved so
easily included in the administrative functions of the dean's staffshows the dangers of

disregarding student participation in all levels of hiring and administration.
When the hiring process for the new
CIVIC directors began, a search committee
was formed; some job announcements were
put out; and the next thing that most of the
campus heard, the job was filled. A commitment, made by the head of the committee, to
give a formal hearing to critics ofthe CIVIC's
current program and priorities was ignored.
A reliable source said some members of the
search committee were not even told of the
decision before it was made public!
That, as I said, is a problem. Thefact that
CIVIC directors are not part of Senior Staff
does not mean the search is unimportant or
that student involvement is not crucial. The
fact that the program, at least at its inception,
was intended primarily as a student group,
suggests that student and volunteer involvementshouldbe regarded as vital. The fact that
the previous director had aroused significant
controversy over the direction of the organization makes it particularly disturbing that
dissenting voices were not raised during the
searchprocess.
While discussing this issue with other
students, I found that similar complaints had
been raised over the process of replacing
Gloria Thomas Walker, who left the Admissions office this year. Her position was filled
by Yvette Dennis, another Admissions employee, and Dennis's former position is now
open. I have not been able to research that
decision process—perhaps that will come in
a future column
but some students are
apparently concerned that little or no search
was undertaken for Walker's position.
It is crucial that Swarthmorerealize that
all administrative positions are important to
students, staff, and faculty. Procedures and
committees to hire new staff may be cumbersome and annoying
but they do serve a
vital purpose.

PITTSBURGH- The spirituality practiced in Africa is the subject of a new course
at Dusquesne University taught by a Catholic
priest who made his home in Kenya.
The class is being taught by the Rev.
Raymond Mosha, head of the Spirituality
Department from the Catholic Higher Education Institute of Africa in Kenya.
The goal of the class, according to Rev.
Clyde A. Bonar, director of the Institute of
Formative Spirituality,is to teachabout world
views that mold African spirituality.
DAVIS, Calif.- A new program at the
University of California-Davis law school
provides legal representation for indigent
people who cannot afford counsel in civil
rights claims against the federal government.
The plaintiffs, most ofwhom are prisoners unable to afford an attorney, will be referred to law students in the clinic by federal
judgesin theU.S. District Court for theEastern District ofCalifornia.
Margaret Johns, a law school professor
who developed the concept, said the clinic
will provide students with litigation experience and provide clients with representation.
The clinic will "relieve the court of the
burden of the people representing and trying
cases themselves," Johns said.
The UC Davis students will work on
every aspect of litigating civil rights cases,
and will be supervised by a practicing civil
rights attorney.

U.S. District Court Chief Judge EmeriLawrence Karlton called the program
"critical" and said it could become a prototype for the country. "Tomy knowledge, this
is the first time that the program is being
offered as formal education" to law students,
he said.

Credit/No Credit
The faculty regulation on credit/no credit grading provides that the only grades
recorded forfreshmen in their first semester shall be CR (credit) or NC (no credit); and that
in the balance of the undergraduate years, students may select as many as four additional
courses on a credit/no credit basis. For any course, this credit/no credit option is
available only if formally requested within the first two weeks of the semester, not
later.
Juniors and seniors are reminded that the minimum equivalent grade for CR (credit)
is a C. The equivalent grade for freshmen and sophomores is D.
If you wish to take one or more courses on a credit/no credit basis during the
current semester, obtain a form from the Registrar's Office and return it to the Office
of the Registrar by Friday, September 17. This must be done even though you mayhave
indicated such a choice on your green enrollment card.

Barr, Wartenburg discuss admissions plans
By Frank Kuo-Hui Yu
and Erik Huneke
This year Robert Barr, theDean ofAdmissions for the past seventeen years, and
Carl Wartenburg, former Princeton admissions officer and current Director ofAdmissions, will share the responsibilities of presiding over the admissions office. Barr is
"very pleased" with this arrangement and
describes Wartenburg as a person with superb moral values and commitment. During
this transitionperiod, Wartenburg is "learning the ropes" oftheSwarthmore admissions
process. Both Barr and Wartenburg say everything is going smoothly so far.
Several significant changes took place
duringBarr's seventeenyears atSwarthmore.
As a result of the admissions office's increased efforts at student recruitment, the
applicant pool has doubled. In addition, there
is moreracial, economic, and social diversity
in the student body today. Barr hopes
Wartenburg will sustain this diverse applicant pool inspite ofthe decreasing numberof
graduating high school students. Barr also

Alum to give drug talk
By lan Hansen
Addicts, dealers, libertarians, hippies, narcs, mods, regular folk, deadheads, law-andordergoons, freaks, and economists will gatherin theKirby Lecture Hall on September 23.
This potentially unsavory crowd will listen to, cheer on, andattack Jeffrey Miron '7B as he
articulates his view that all drugs, from Tylenol with codeine to heroin, shouldbe legalized
and deregulated. Miron is the chair of the Economics Department at Boston University,
and has been arguing strongly and publicly for drug legalization for several years.
The man responsible for Miron's presence, Matt Taylor '94, met him as a guest on
Taylor's Boston-area cable show. Impressed withMiron's views, and later discovering he
was an alum, Taylor sought to bring Miron back to shake up a few minds. Taylor hopes
the eye-catching legend on his promotional flyers ("everybody get high") is not taken
literally. Consequences of suchbehavior are enumerated in a lengthy footnote at thebottom
of the flyer.
Those who are threatened by an end of the war on drugs and those who think the
violence can stop withoutresorting to thedrastic laissez-faire solutionMironproposes will
doubtless be preparing themselves for the arguments he will present. Most of these
arguments will be somewhat familiar. To prevent deja vu, however, Miron will also be
employing some less-known arguments.
His studies have shown that there is a profound sense in which all prohibitions have
been not-so-subtle forms of nativist backlash. For example, illegalization of alcohol
coincidedwiththerise ofIrish immigration. Illegalization of marijuana coincidedwith the
huge migrations of Southern blacks to Northern cities. Illegalization of opium coincided
with the flood of immigrants from China.
Drug law buffs should be prepared for economic propaganda methods like costbenefit analysis curves as well as an overload of "disgusting statistics" about drug abuse
and themethods used to stop it

about the college. It is for this reason that
alumni are encouraged to communicate with
potential applicants within their communities. It also explains why many faculty, when
attending conferences around the country,
express their willingness to speak to Advanced Placement classes in local high schools.
Wartenburg and Barr commented that
thestudent body was unexpectedly large this
year, not because of the sizable first-year
class but because more upperclassmen decided not to study abroad. There are no plans
to expand the student body, since such a
change would require an accompanying increase in services, would upset the favorable
student-faculty ratio, and might make such
college mainstays as the External Examination Program impossible.

For the record
The Phoenix last week incorrectly
referred to the new Director of Admissions, Carl Wartenburg, as Dr.
Wartenburg. Wartenburg is not, as of this
date, a Ph.D. The Phoenix regrets the
error.

On socio-nihilism at Swat
Where do I begin? How doI begin? Should Ibegin at all? These are all concerns with which
to addresswhenthe thought ofwriting this editorialfirst presented itselftome. Thesubject
matter is of the most delicate, yet provocative, nature. lam going to address my people. lam going
to offendsome individuals.I mayhurt yet some others still. However, I hope to affect the behaviorand
perceptions ofsome students in a very profound andpermanent way with this indictment ofsorts.
There issomething very unique abouttheblackstudentatSwarthrnore atype of diversity which,
to me, is not very desirable. When I say "theblack studentat Swarthrnore" lam not referring to every
black studentat Swarthrnore, but I am attempting to coin a substantial number of individuals under
the rubric of thatcharacterization. What isso unique is not that they are,for the mostpart, intelligent,
articulate, self-empowered, and the like. However, what is unique is the result ofplacing these
achievers together to work, toplay, to interact witheach otherand with non-black students in the
confines oj Ike ever-beautiful Swarthrnore College. Theresults are cataclysmic. Suddenly self-esteem
lowers, whitesbecome theproverbial 2x4's uponwhich to vent frustrations,jealousy ofpeers takesthe
form ofself-hatred, and students begin, as f.S. Eliot said in the "Four Quartets' (or maybe it was
"Generations"), to "motive hunt of a motiveless malignity."
Why, brothers and sisters, why? I will attempt to respond to that rhetorical question in the
remainder ofmy editorial. Lets shiftblame herefor afleeting moment. Itsnot completely your fault,
brothers and sisters. You have been baited, race-baited to some extent, by the administration who
placed you at Swarthrnore in the first place. They knew thatyou would be insecure about yourrole
at the College. They knew as theyprinted averageSAT scores of1300+ that, more often than not, you
would feel marginalized—intellectually, academically, and humanistically (please don't dwell too
long on thisclaim or drawconclusions thatI oppose Affirmative Action, because thatis not theissue
here). Admissions officersare qualified to determinewho is, and is not, a viablecandidate. They know
who can pass and who cannot. They know who will thriveand who will struggle miserably to survive
atthe margins. But they implementwishful thinking anyway. They knowingly disrupt thefragile psyche
of minority students who may soon fad inevitably. So, what happens?
What happens is that these students who are perceptive recognize their inferiorities and try to
overcompensatefor them "by any means necessary." They vent on theirpeers who succeed, they
redefine their personae along racial lines such that everything is "a black tiling you wouldn't
understand." Hell, they even redefine blackness to distinguish themselvesfrom thosethatdo succeed
at Swarthrnore. There are now DEGREES to race and ethnicity. Beneath the "sell-out' rests the
"incognegro." They disdainfully look upon theirbrothersand sisters who don't suffer comparably,
lam, so I' m told, regardedwah such scorn. lam not going toproceed to justifyand detailmy blackness
with accounts ofmy childhood, police brutality stories, descriptions of my neighborhood, or tearjerkers about the fate offriends and acquaintances. For then I wouldfall prey to what I condemn:
making blackness hierarchical. Tm not quitefinished with my indictment.
I am toldyear after year byfirst-year minority students (tm a seniorby the way) that there are
certain members ofthe community whofeel it is their duty to educate thesefrosh No, no. They don't
detail them on what courses to take, whatprofessors are mostcompelling, what are some ofthe better
ways tofill PDC requirements, or even how to survive at Swarthrnore; believe me, there is a method
to the madness. What they do isprovide free, although it is not sofree, information on who is "cool"
and who is not, who is "black" and who is not; in essence, who they like and dislike. It has become
clear to me thattheseindividuals most dislikethemselves as self-hatred has infected theirbody politic.
There is a reason why they, most often, provide subjective information instead of substantive
information. Itis because they are insecure about their ability orqualifications to provide the latter.
They can't stomachthis college themselves, letaloneprovide instructions on how to do soforothers.

Reflections on Dinesh D'Souza
To the editor:
Last semester during Dinesh D'Souza's
lecture on campus, a student in the audience
mentioned that he felt that the influence of the
Iroquois Confederacy's constitution on Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and others involved in the writing of the United States
Constitution was one example thatcalled into
question many of the assertions that D'Souza
made in his talk.
The gist ofD'Souza's response as I rememberit was that any such supposed "influence" ofNative Americans on the U.S. Constitution was basically bogus and not sup-

Kennedy assassination needs to be reexamined
Goodfaith effort by Clinton would resolve the debate and see justice done
By Chuck Stevens
Justice is, at best, subjective. Sorting out
loose ends of a past event until the malefactors are punished and theinnocent cleared can
never be clear-cut, in part because, in the
process of the sorting out, accusations may be
made and verdicts handed down that subvert
the grander workings of justice.
A system of justice, with its necessary
inexactitudes and inefficiencies, may become
sidetracked on its way to the truth; circumstances may cause poor judgment on the part
of the human components of the system, and
thus obscure thetruth. Our natural distaste for
delving into the past to question apparently
reasonable decisions, for "digging itup again"
so to speak, resists a second examination, and
the years go by with the truth still concealed
or misrepresented.
However, no justicesystem is static. The
potential always remains to right wrongs and
atone for past mistakes in the pursuit of truth.
As might be said of some higher system of
justice, honesty and a fresh start can redeem a
multitude of sins. Moreover, the imperfections of our system makeit imperative that we
keep an eye on the past, questioning, skeptically examining, and rethinking decisions. So
easy is itfor an otherwise impartial judge and
jury to be swayed by a preponderance of
misleading evidence, a failure of existing
contrary evidence to come to light, and other
temporary circumstances, that one would be
hard-pressed to declare any case officially
closed. Without the opportunity toreview and
revise, justice is a hit-or-miss affair.
This November will mark the thirtieth
anniversary of the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, a crime whose investigation serves to this day as an indictment of the
justice system as a whole. The Warren Commission verdict, that Kennedy was shot by a
lone assassin who was himself shot by an-

other lone assassin, has come under heavy stayed for twelve years.

felt throughout

What is with these guys, anyway?
By Jonathan Seitz
This week, I felt like Rip van Winkle.
While I was in my catatonic state for the last
100 years, someone slipped the PLO and the
Israelis some kind of hallucinogenic drug.
From what I can tell, they are being downright
civil to eachother now. (Well, at least most of
them are.)
I don'tknow ifit's just me in my littleold
news vacuum here, but this whole peace thing
seemed a bit sudden. Really, they've having
peace talks now for quite a while, but they
seemed to be acting like me driving a stick
shift: Hardly did they get the process moving
when it would come to a creaking, crashing,
bone-shaking halt.
Not that I'm complaining, you understand. I wouldrather we didn'thave the guerrilla warfare going on inplaces like the Occupied Territories, Northern Ireland, and such.
It just seems all too sensible, that's all.
The problem as I see it, in many situations like this, is that the participants forget
exactly what they're working for —they forget the big picture. For instance, there are
some groups in both the Israeli and Palestinian camps that believe that this agreement is a
sellout 1 wonder if they remember what they
are—or at least what they should be—fighting for.
They should be fighting for theirpeople.
Not land, people. Not for revenge, not for their
fallen comrades, but for the future of the
people who must follow them in a land that
has been torn apart by bloodshed and violence
for so many years. As far as I can tell, this
agreement gives some ofthePalestinian people
the right to self rule, with an agreement to
work towards further democracy in the region. Now this may not have been thebest of
resolutions, but I would humbly give my
opinion that it is better than living in a police
state.

As for the Israelis, I would imagine that
what their people would like most is peace.
Peace to go about their business and to live
their lives without interruption from war, terrorism, or threat thereof. With this agreement,
at least part of the PLO (most importantly
their chairman) has agreed to forego violence
as a means to their ends.
I was amused as I listened to the radio
coverage of a press conference with Yasar
Arafat at the Press Club in Washington, D.C.
on Tuesday. The most confrontational state-

ments, complaints, and doomsday predictions came from the press in the audience.
While Arafat seemed willing to give theprocess a try, the press seemed to think that all
this peace stuff made for lousy copy, so it
would be better if we threw in a little posturing, threats, and perhaps a small terrorist

attack out ofLibya.
That is not to say that there was no
posturing or hints at stumbling blocks which
may come up along the way to a lasting peace.
However, Arafat seemed content to say that
those problems would be worked out when
they came up, and that the Palestinians and
the Israelis should concentrate on quickly
enacting this peace agreement to reap the
benefits it will surely bring.
One somewhat confrontational reporter
brought up the question of Jerusalem, which
is claimed by both the Palestinians and the Israelis (along with
severalother groups), asking about
Arafat's prediction that a Palestinian flag would fly over Jerusalem one day (and Israeli Prime
Minister Rabin's reply of not a
chance).
Arafat clarifiedthathe meant
West Jerusalem, and then went on
to say that both sides were concerned about many issues which
needed to be clarified. "I have to
respect what [Rabin] is saying,
and [Rabin] has to respect what I
am saying," Arafat told the reporter. We'll work it all out, in
other words, when the time
comes—by discussion, not by violence.
Later in the press conference,
the same reporter asked Arafat,
"Now thatyou have signed a peace
treaty with Israel, who do you
consider your enemy?"
"You," Arafat replied, remarking on the reporter's penchant for looking on the not-sobright side oflife.
Shortly after that exchange,
Arafat was asked what the Palestinian priorities would befor their
newly autonomous people. Arafat
did not say "the eradicationof the
Israeli state," "finishing the job
on the World Trade Center," or
even "appointing me head-

honcho-for-life." He said that the top priorities for his people would be feeding the his
fellow Palestinians, whomhe said were living
in starvation, and educating thepopulation, so
that thePalestinian people wouldhave a bright
future.
Most people who had followed the conflict would have thought this bright future
impossible hadanyone asked them a yearago,
or even several months ago. Yasar Arafat, the
chairman of the PLO, and Yitzahk Rabin, the
Prime Minister of Israel, were shaking hands
on the White House Lawn after signing a
peace accord on Monday. And the next day,
Arafat declares that his enemy is an abrasive
reporter, and his first order of business is to
feed and educate the Palestinian people.
That is what, I hope, they have been
fighting for all these years.

Clinton's Justice Department. The recent releaseofheretofore classified documents concerning the assassination paid lip service to
the notion of finding the truth, but those
released told little of note. A release ofCIA
and FBI records might help: insight into the
FBl's investigation, which sometimes conflicted with thoseof the Dallas police and the
Warren Commission, might be useful. The
multitude of CIA connections to Oswald,
Shaw, and other mysterious players on the
fringes of the case shouldbe explored as well.
Fundamentally, however, it is the old
evidence thatshould be reexamined. Until an
investigative team takes a clearlook at previous findings (notably thebullet that supposedly smashed through threebones, made seven
wounds, took some strange turns en route,
and emerged with less than .65% ofits original mass gone) justice will remain an ideal.
I call, therefore, on the current Justice
Department to reopen the investigation. The
timing could hardly be more apropos—John
F. Kennedy was Bill Clinton's childhood
idol, and now, on the eve of the three decade
anniversary of his mentor's death, the new
president has a chance to right an obvious
wrong. More importantly, a more forthright
look at President Kennedy's assassination
might provide our nation with a chance to
reassess a half-century of turmoil.
The events ofNovember22,1963, were
no ordinary death, noreven an ordinary presidential assassination. The repercussions of
those shots were felt throughout the decade,
in the disillusionment that sparked student
protests, in the armed-camp mentality felt in
thenation'sresponse to theurban riots and to
the escalating Cold War. Oliver Stone was
not far wrong in calling the assassination of
President Kennedy the"seminal event" ofhis
generation. Certainly, the effect of that moment, in the destruction of an ideal and the
consequent loss offaith in government on the
part of many citizens, wouldbe hard to understate. Financial considerations, though important, should not hinder the search for
truth—too much is at stake.
The legitimacy of our justicesystem and
(for many young citizens) of justice itself, is
at issue here. If we believe in our power to
right wrongs, to atone for past mistakes, we
must enact it. Disturbing enough is the portraitofotherwise intelligent people constructing a ludicrous case and ignoring contradictory evidence; even more unsettling is the
specter of other intelligent people defending
that claim as they might their lives. The
average citizen, observing the case, might
well conclude that those blindly following
the verdict of the Warren Commission are
afraid of what they might find should they
examine the case with eyes open, and such
may be the case.
We need truth, not convenience and
palatability, at this point. Kevin Costner's
Jim Garrison confronts critics with the line,
"Let justicebe done though theheavensfall!"
Indeed. Your call, Mr. Clinton.

A conscience is more
important than orders
By Kar-yee Wu
The military has long argued that it is a
separate entityfrom the rest of society. For its
own survival and protection, it enforces certain ideas that the rest of society does not
exactly follow. One of the most basic tenets is
that a soldier obeys, without question or hesitation, all orders issued by a superior officer.
If someone says "jump", a soldier asks how
high, not why. A soldier could be punished,
dishonorably discharged, and in certain circumstances shot for not obeying a direct order. However, and thismay cause some raised
eyebrows, a soldier can also be punished for
obeying a direct order (examples are A Few
Good Men and the Nuremberg trials). The
soldier is in a
Catch-22 situation, and it is a
terrible place in
which to be.
However, I ultimately believe
or
that if an order
to
absolutely violates a soldier's
conscience/morality, he or she has the moral
obligation to disobey the order.
My argument goes directly against what
boot camp and the military try to indoctrinate
into recruits. Perhaps I am asking the impossiblefrom them, that Irequire these soldiers to
do something that undermines military authority; I am asking each one to be an individualwith independent thought, not a nameless, faceless member of a homogeneous
group. I am not advocating that a soldier
disobey any order that he or she chooses; that
wouldbe completely counterproductive. What
I advocate is Henry DavidThoreau's concept
ofcivil disobedience—ifyou feel that a law or
order is wrong or immoral, then you have the
moral obligation and duty to break it. Thus, as
a soldier, if yourlieutenanttells you to kill the
civilian that welcomed you into your home,
then you might seriously consider not killing
that civilian. However, if the same lieutenant
tells you to drop to the floor and give him or
her 100 push-ups, obedience would be in
order.
The argument goes that the military is
not like the rest of society; thus, it shouldn't
abide by the same laws or be held to the same
standards. It fulfills a specific function and
this specialty exempts the military from societal rules. In order to fulfill this specialized
role, the military requires and actively fosters
an obedient atmosphere. The military doesn't
require original thought among its recruits
and probably discourages it. The military
looks for a very specific profile ofperson who
is intelligent, obedient, loyal, and physically
fit, someone who will be able to solve complex problems, but not so creative as to question every order that comes from his or her

However different, the military is still a
part of society and as such is subject to the
larger societal rules. Nuremberg plainly
showed this to us; the "simply following
orders" defense does not hold water when the
orders so grievously violate societal moral
codes. To take a less extreme example, the
Amish in the U.S. are a group who have a
different set ofrules that govern their lives (I
may be simplifying this). They do not use
electricity, they do not place faces on their
dolls, and so on. Their law is the Bible.
Whatever rules they follow among themselves, they are still subject to the laws of
Pennsylvania and the U.S.A. The same applies to the military; whatever rules they follow among themselves, they still answer to

superiors.
While the military fulfills a very necessary function within society as a whole, this
specialty does not excuse it from acting in a
moral manner. Whether or not war itself is
moral is something we can argue at another
time. I will concede that during war, people's
moral standards change. After all, it's accepted to lay waste to the enemybut not your
neighbor. However, there is NO situation
whatsoever that could justify the Holocaust,
theKhmer Rouge massacre in Cambodia, or
any other large-scale destruction of a people
or country. Simply because two governments
are at war does not give anyone free license to
decimate a people. All is not fair in love and war.

someone he or shehas been taught daily not to

that most orders should be obeyed without
question. However, an order that fundamentally goes against a person's conscience probably should be disobeyed. That is the heart of
Thoreau's idea. By bringing in Thoreau, I ask
even more than simple disobedience.Part and
parcel to Thoreau's ideas of civil disobedience is the admonishment that you must ac-.
cept responsibility for your actions and understand that you will be punished for whatever disobedience you perform. One is to
offer no resistance to punishment, accept it,
and through this acceptance change the thinking of those in charge. My Thoreau is a bit
rusty, so bear with me if this sounds a little
strange. I wouldnot ask this much ofa soldier
unless I thought that he or she could live up to
it.
A soldier is not an automaton. He or she
is an individual capable of independentthought
and judgment. Despite all of the indoctrination that the military forces upon its recruits,
ofobedience and oflack of thought, they will
hope-fully not havelost their sense ofhumanity and morality. Ifyou have ever seen Gallipoli
you will understand the devastation a stupid
order can cause. A soldier must remember
thathe or she has a greater loyalty and duty to
humanity thantowards the military. That is all
I ask.

D'SOUZA from page 4
with even the merest suggestion that the topic
of the Iroquois Confederacy influencing the
Articles of Confederationand the U.S. Constitution ought to be worth further investigation?
Despite D'Souza and Schlesinger, there
is much interest and debate about this topic
among other historians, and easy conclusions
about these matters are impossible. At the
same time, a good deal is at stake, including
many assumptions that D'Souza and others
make about how to define the "Western"
tradition itself.
I believeit is not a matter ofdenying the
influenceof European political theorists like
Locke on the "Founding Fathers" (though it's
interesting to research to what degree Locke
himself was influencedby accounts ofNative
American governments). Rather, itis a question of looking at the historical record with
fresh eyes and noting, among other things,

Obedience is the
better part of valor
By Ligeia Jennis
I am about to posit an argument that most liberals, and most young people
as well, will find unpalatable. Simply said, the military, with its specific
function ofcivilian defense, depends on a rigid hierarchy, a force of complete
obedience from below and total decision making from above. We often scoff
at the military's claim of separatism because, quite honestly, it is often an
excuse for simplyrationalizing away valid change. But there is some validity
to a part of the claim.
Every institution in the world is shaped by itspurpose. The United States
Congress, for example, must create and implement the laws which will guide
our nation into the future. Some of theselaws will be unpopular and, were the
Congress likeany other job in America, the representatives might fear constant
firing and, hence, never enact these unpopular but necessary rules. As a
safeguard we have setterms of office. The congressperson who hopes to be reelected must still respond to some degree to the will ofhis or her electorate but
is insulated from a large measure of impulsive retribution.
Similarly, the military is to some degree separate from other American
institutions. We need a military to fight wars, waste lives and kill. It is thus
formed differently than, say, the institution of academia. In the military, the
hierarchy which can be mitigated in the rest of America is necessary in the
business of death. To succeed in this, the military has the unhappy task of
undoing every rule Mommy and Daddy taught their little darlings. Where
normal society has tried to instill a love of life and individuality, the military
must turn this around so these darlings are willing to kill and maybe even die.
This is no easy task. The sublimationof the sense of selfnecessary to get
people to act like lemmings simply because a leader has put claims on a patch
of land is not a partial thing. You cannot be willing to kill and, okay, maybe
willing to knit socks but, darn it, not willing to peel potatoes or do push-ups.
There are inarguably times when consensus and debate are the best modes
of cooperation. If there is the time and the opportunity then such detailed
debating and discussion can be most helpful. There are other times, however,
when the best means to the end is hierarchy and obedience. For the most part,
military time, especially in battle, is a time to obey. Equals (speaking in terms
ofrank) might discuss. Subordinates must obey. If the orders they are given
are so odious thatobedience is impossible, then they must pursue the necessary
channels to see that the superiors are taken to task by yet another set of
superiors. And obedience is not a bad thing. It does not necessarily insure evil
ends. This is the heart ofmy real argument.
Whenever these sort of discussions occur people point to the Holocaust,
Vietnam, and so on. I would agree that crimes were committed in each event.
My disagreement, however, is in the nature of these crimes.
In A Few Good Men, for example, it could be said thatthe two marines who
obeyed a bogus command were at fault. They should have disobeyed. I would
argue, however, that thereal flaw lay in a lack of military obedience not in an
overabundance. Specifically, various characters forgot their places. Jack
Nicholson's colonel disobeyed direct orders. Had he obeyed, as he should
have, the tragedy would not have occurred. Similarly, in obeying the bogus
orders, which were directly in discord with higher military orders (the "code
reds" were patently illegal and every recruit knew it) the two unfortunate
marines also were wrong.
It wasn't that they shouldnot have obeyed any orders but, rather, that they
shouldhave obeyed the highest orders. The same arguments could be extended
to the other examples. The Nuremberg soldiers are guilty of war crimes, not
because they obeyed when they should have abstainedbut because they chose
to obey the most convenient orders instead of the most valid, such as
international law. There are laws ofcombat (e.g. the Geneva Convention) and,
in their frenzy to obey der Fuhrer, they disobeyed the larger commands. It is
for this that they were punished, not for obedience but for a distinct lack ofit.

representatives were invited to Philadelphia
during 1776, and that John Adams' Defence
of the Constitutions of Government of the
United States (1787) contains references to
Native American political ideas, and then
asking what this means.
In 1987a hearing before the Select Committee on IndianAffairs in the U.S. Senate led
by Senator Inouye contained much testimony
affirming the complexity of the Iroquois system of self-government and the keen interest
in the Iroquois shared by Franklin, Adams,
and others; as a result of this hearing, the
Senate passed a resolution in 1987 "to acknowledge the contribution of the Iroquois
Confederacy of Nations to the development
of the United States Constitution."
A copy of this hearing is available in
McCabe in government documents under
"Iroquois Confederacy." The documentalso
includes the texts ofboth constitutions printed
side by side. Students will find very interesting both the similarities and the differences

(including the prominent role played by

There is also a running debate on the
matter in the Fall 1988 and Summer 1990
issues oiEthnohistory (available inMcCabe),
where readers will find that the problem of
determining whether "influence" existed or
not (and if so, how to define it) is a good deal
more complex than D'Souza implied during
his visit here. Even students who conclude
that the Iroquois contribution was relatively
minor must admit this.
Focusing on Native Americans' influence on those who arrived in the Americas
from other continents is not the only way, or
even the central way, of understanding the
contributions that Native Americans have
made to civilization on this planet. But it is
one place to start.

A personal interview with President Al Bloom
By Andrew Brown

human beings and new ways to approach
issues I hadbeen considering. The fact that I
took both courses at the same time led me to
question assumptions about what I thought
was important about life, and what I thought

Bloom has noted differences between
his alma mater and Swarthmore. "I very
much believe that for undergraduate education a small college environment like
Swarthmore provides a much richer education than a large university. Classes are
smaller. Students have a chance to develop
close relationships with faculty." In retrospect, Bloom remarked, "I should have come
to Swarthmore."
Bloom gave me a brief tour ofhis office

Willets' Legend Explained
By Mike Mirarchi
It's usually the third question asked at
freshman orientation, following "What's your
name?" and "Where are you from?"
"So, what dorm are you living in?"
"Willets."
The name itself has taken on somewhat
legendary status, often inspiring awe and
wonder in the listener. Oral tradition and
frequent parties preserve the mystique surrounding what one student called"thisinsane
animal house."
The guide to residence halls describes it
as "a typical 'fifties dorm.' Willets has the
special charm of the average Howard
Johnson's.. .The first and second floors tend
to be noisy."Will Craig '96 agrees. "People
have no respect for Willets. They'll walk
quiedy down the hall of another dorm, but
they'll come into Willets and start yelling."
According to the guide, "Willets is
known as a social dorm." Jeff Spritzer '96
who is living in Willets for his second year,
elaborated on this description, "It's just a
bunch ofnakedpeoplerunning around drunk.
Gotta love it."
Willetsis a love/hate affair, and students
are often passionate about their opinions. "I
think Willets is the best," said Mike Tomko
'97. "It's the best way to meet a lot of
freshmen. Willets is the place to be."
"It's a legend," said Dhruvi Kakkad '97.
"That was the greatest freshman experience," said Mike Kuh '94 who spent three
years in Willets and was an RA therelast year.
"You come back at 2:00 in the morning,
and you can get a good whiffle-ball game
going," said Matt Grossman '96.
The stories surrounding Willets are numerous, and passed downfrom generation to
generation. One part of Willets' lore is the
curse of Willets North 2nd floor, the "RA
black hole." Over the past five years, only
two RA's of this hallhave been reappointed.
Legend has it that one year, the hall members
even tried to burn down their RA's door. The
current RA, Cary Schaub '95, said being in
"the hall from hell"made him apprehensive at
first, but "it's been good so far."
Kuh recalled an anecdote from"the glory
days of Willets" during his freshman year.
"We would always break into theroof just to
hang around out there and get a tan. And we'd
put up a lot of furniture and futons," Kuh
explained. "We were on theroof one time and
there was a wedding going on at the Scott
Arboretum House, whichis in full viewof the
roof. This guy in a tuxedo who we guessed

was the groomstarted yelling to us 'Moonmy
mother!' So there were about five or six of us
who just dropped our shorts. All these guys in
tuxedos who were pretty drunk were just

dying laughing."
The vast majority of students living in
Willets are freshmen, so "tons of bonding
goes on at Willets," said Tomko. "Willets is
bonding galore."
The bonding, along with the numerous
festivities, however, takes its toll on Willets.
"There' s tons oftrash in thehall—pizza boxes,
food, etc." said Kakkad. Consequently, the
housekeeping staff at Willets gets paid more
than in other dorms.
"My CA lived in Willets as a freshman,"
said Peter Zustovich '97. "He said that the
image of Willets that most stayed with him
was wading through broken glass and vomit
in the bathroom the morning after a particularly eventful Saturday night."
"We couldn't flush the toilets last year
because of some apparatus attached to them,
and it really began to stinkafter a while," said
Paul Krause '96.
Chris Hourigan '96 said "I stayed in the
basement for a week last year, with a rat this
big." His hands shaped a football.
One notorious drawbackoflife in Willets
is "the stench." "I think you'll get used to it,"
said Rebecca Giguere '97. "You don'tnotice
it unless you go someplace else."
Yet despite its less than perfect condition, Willets residents remain proud of their
dorm. "We like the smell,." said Travis Elliott
'96. "We produce it." "I'm proud of it," said
Neal Cohen '96. Grossman added, "We like
the stains on the carpet."
"The dirtiness got itscharmafter a while,"
said Krauss. "I began to like living in the
squalor. I began to look at it from the outside
as a cardboard box."
Willets' reputation often discourages upperclassmen from seeking housing there. "I
requested anywhere on campus, except
Willets," said Hourigan, "and they stuck me
in Willets."
While the reputation deters some students, it attracts others. "We couldn't resist
the lore of Willets," said Grossman, who,
along withhis roommate Elliott, choseWillets
after a year of living in Wharton. "We heard
the Call of the Wild, if you will," explained
Elliott
Tomko tried to put itall in perspective. "I
guess we might be rowdy for Swarthmore,"
he said, "but anywhere else I guess we'd be
considered a convent."

the off-campus students. Freedom, space, a
place away from the close-knit atmosphere
of the dorms are some of the benefits that
people havefound living on their own. There
is a definiteart to coexistingpeacefully in the
samebuilding with 50 other living,breathing
bodies. Some tolerance is needed in scheduling time for showers and placing two beds
plus desks and chest-of-drawers in a space
not much bigger than your closet at home.
"I wanted the privacy you get living offcampus," said Jen Setlow '95. "No matter
how quiet your dorm is, it's nice always
having a space ofyour own, somewhereyou
know you can study." Krysia Kubiak '94
agrees. She transferred from Washington
University in St. Louis the second semester
ofher sophomore year. **Atmy otherschool
everyone moved off campus junior year. I
expected to when I came to Swarthmore. It's
a lot more like I have a home. I can leave
campus and have a separate life, a separate
existencefrom school. I study better and can
do whatever I want, whenever I want It is a
lot of work, but thereis a lot more freedom."
Laura Ascenzi '94 livedoffcampus last
spring after being in South America the previous semester. "I hated being so guarded by
Swarthmore. I wanted to be a student who
goes to school then has a life awayfrom it."
Shannon Allen '94, one ofAscenzi's house-

mates, said, "It's nice to be a real person with
a real house. You have your own space and
your own food."
Along with freedom, independence, and
own space, preparing one's own food struck
a chord with off-campus students. Unlike

residents of many other colleges withseveral
mealplan choices, residents on Swarthmore's
campus must buy the 20-meal-a-week system. "It [the decision to live off-campus] was
mostly because of Sharpies. We can make
our own food; it's better; we can eat when we
want and it's cheaper. And the campus is
right there," stated Cam Boyd '96. Any
drawbacks? "I missed the Internet system,
but we just got a modem so it' s not a problem,
Boyd said." Kubiak added, "I don't get tosee
friends as much as I used to, but.. .it's amazing how little I miss."
Every student who has requested offcampus housing in the last five years has
received it The college's student handbook
states, "It is recognized that some students
may prefer to live off campus, and, with the
exception of first-year students, they are generally allowed to do so." Myrt Westphal,
Director of Resident Life, aft-jr reading the
policy, explained, "But we've never said you
can't live off [campus] to anyone."
Compared to districts around other
schools, Swarthmore has more expensive
housing. However, it is still cheaper than
living in the dorms. Buying and preparing
food costs considerably less money than the
meal plan. A student in her second semester
living away from campus said, "It's cheaper
and you don't have anyone cooking or cleaning for you, no one serves you. You 're taking
care of yourself. It's more work but a good
experience."
All the students interviewed who had at
least a year left at Swarthmore said they
wouldremain offcampus. Many agreed they
couldn't go back to living under someone
else's rules. All wanted to remain in their
own apartments, with their own schedules
and freedom.
I wanted a transition of
independence between undergraduate and the
rest of my life," said Kubiak, "I wanted the
responsibility."
"And," Setlow added, "you can have a
cat"

Swarthmore's definition of sex

Paula Abdul-pint size glasses, and grumbling
discontentedly under my breath. Now one

I am bitterly complaining about the Pepsi.

Evil Buzzards falter in preseason
By Scott Williams
Men's rugby opened its season
disappointingly Saturday with losses
to Kutztown and West Chester at the
preseason Kutztown tournament.
Twice Swat started strong, but then
slipped and lost its lead in the 2ndhalf.
Swat played Kutztown first,
whom they had edged out in a close
game last spring. After falling behind
5-0, Swat came back to lead thegame
8-5 at the half. But Kutztown recoveredand went upby aninsurmountable
margin of 17-8.
"The intensity and enthusiasm
were there," said Guy Danilowitz '95,
"but it seemed that when one person
made a spectacular play, the whole
team didn't follow up. When we were
up, we lost our intensity."
The game against Westchester
later that afternoonfollowed the same
pattern. Once again, Swat took an early
lead-thistime 8-0. Then in thesecond

half thedrivecollapsed. Thelossplaced
Swat last inthe tournament and shocked
the veteran players.
"I came into Saturday's tournament somewhat skeptical of our young
team. But we played the first half of
both games with the skill and enthusiasm reminiscent of last year's powerhouse team," said Ron Groenendaal
'94. "Our performance during the secondhalves crushed my expectations."
Swat's level of play was a bit
uneven, but not altogether unskilled.
JimSavage '94 came through with "a
great performance in the tournament,"
saidDanilowitz. "Hewassolidthroughout both games." Mike Madden '95
scored in the second game and played
the second half even after suffering a
concussion. Itis this type of grit which
the team will rely upon this fall to
overcome larger schools in thecompetitionfor the lead in the EasternPennsylvania Rugby Union (EPRU).
Though disappointed with their

performance at Kutztown, the Buzzards look ahead to the fall games,
which count toward divisional play.
Their first regular-season tests come
against Delaware, East Straussberg,
and then West Chester-which
Danilowitz points to as one of their
biggest games. Swat tied WestChester
and East Straussbergfor first place in
the EPRU last spring.
"We're a lot smaller thanmanyof
the schools we compete against We
must concentrate on superior fitness
and fundamentals," remarked
Danilowitz. "This year we're a less
experienced team, and we're going to
try to prove ourselves in the course of
theseason. I'mhoping tostart off with
a win against Delaware."
Swat, led by captains Avi Rao '94
and DarinFriess '95, hopes to mold its
young team into skilled veterans
through tough mental and physical
preparation. This will help themretain
their standing as a leader in theEPRU.

Women drop the ball
Volleyball starts season with two losses in a row
By David Lischer
TheS warthmore women's volleyball season startedoff on a disappointing note as they lost their first
two matches against Wilmington
and Western Maryland.
S warthmore got off to a good
start against Wilmington on September 10, winning the first game
15-11. Wilmington, however, came
back to sweep the next three games
to take the match 11-15, 15-8, 1510,15-6. "To win the first game is
a rarity [for Swat]... maybe we were
a little too hyped," said co-captain
Way-Ting Chen '94. "It got us a
little too pumped."
On Tuesday against powerhouse Western Maryland Swat was
unable to put forth a concerted effort. "We just couldn't do anything

right... it was like the court was
jinxed," said JennyWillis'94. "Everybody was doing things wrong.
The inexperience of our setters combined with our bad passing [means]
you can't get good hits." Swat lost
in three games, 15-1, 15-11, 15-1.
"What happened in both of[the
matches]," explained teammanager
Matt Schenk '95, "was [that] our
passing fell apart... and the ability is
there, I've seen it in practice and in
past years. They just need to build
their confidence up." Another reason for the loss, according to Chen,
was that the team was unfamiliar
with each other."
Strong plays from Rachel
McKaig '95 and weak side hitter
Nancy Rosenbaum '96 were Swat's
highlights. "Nancy made some great
sprawls and dives to save some big
hits [and] Rachel had ways to get
around blocks... they [Wilmington] had an awesome middle
blocker," said Willis.
The only positive note from
the Western Maryland match
was Christina Richards '94, who
added "a lotof consistency, which
is what we needed... [ she] kept
us afloat," said Chen.
In fairness to the team, Swat
was experimenting with a new
defense. Instead of theirusual 51,five hittersand one setter, they
employed a 6-2, with a rotation
of six hitters and two setters.
Coach Dale S tra wbridge did
not take out his frustration with
the team's poor performance on
his players. "He told us he had
high blood pressure so he wasn't
going to yell at us," said Willis.
Added Chen, "Coach has
chilled out a lot since freshman
year [1990]. He'i> letting us take
control of out own season more
or less. The responsibility of
doing well is in our own hands...
we have to motivate ourselves."
Perhaps the best explanation for the two defeats came
from Willis, who said "[we]
didn't play up to our potential."
Swat had a chance to meet this
potential in its match Thursday
night against Cabrini, which, according to Schenk "could turn
our confidence around." Results
were not available at press time.
Regardless ofhow Swat does
at Cabrini, it must have all its
problems solved by Saturday
when it competes in a tri-match
against Haverford and Franklin
and Marshall. Swat usually
doesn't have trouble with
Haverford, but F & M might
pose a stiffchallenge. Saturday's
matches are must wins; they are
both league contests and have
playoff implications even this
early in the season.

The place to get this week's picks...
...is right here in our Week Three NFL Preview
By Rob Utley
Week Three marks the first of
what the NFL calls "open dates" or
bye weeks. Although teams will only
play sixteen games, the 1993-94
regular season is eighteen weeks
long. Each team will have two bye
weeks. The Bills, Colts, Dolphins,
Jets, Bears, Packers, Vikings, and
Buccaneers are all off this week.
Starting this week, I'll only do capsule predictions on what I think are
the four best matchups of the week.
For the other games, I'll just pick a
winner. As always, the home team
is listed first.
Eagles vs. Redskins: The
Redskins are my favorite team, but
this week I'm going with Philly.
Washington lost QB Mark Rypien
for at least three weeks. Secondstringer Cary Conklin doesn't have
the game experience to operate the
Redskins' new 49'er-style offense.
In the second half of their game
against Green Bay, the Eagles defenseand offense worked in tandem
to both shut down Sterling Sharpe
and company and put the tying and
winning points on the board. This
momentum coupled withhome-field

advantage and the absence of Rypien
shouldpush the Eagles to 3-0. Winner: EAGLES.
Cardinals vs. Cowboys: Dallas is in desperate need of a victory.
Following last week's 13-10 loss to
Buffalo, the Cowboys released
kicker Lin Elliott (Roger Ruzek
better watch his back). With a new
kicker (formerLion Eddie Murray),
Dallas travels to the Valley of the
Sun and should come away with
theirfirst victory. Phoenix RB Garrison Hearst has not yet been a factor, so why should this weekbe any
different against one of the league's
best defenses? Winner: COWBOYS.
Chargers vs. Oilers: After
humbling the Chiefs last week, the
Oilers are beginning to come together. Buddy Ryan's defense shut
out Kansas City, forced a couple of
turnovers, and returned one for a
score. The Chargers, coming off a
loss to Denver, are already having
problems with their running game.
RB Marion Butts, expected to carry
most of therushing load this season,
only carried the ball eight times for
four yards. Not good Chargers QB
Stan Humphries can throw but he's

11

September 17, 1993

good enough to out-gun Warren
Moon and therun-and-shoot. Winner: OILERS.
49'ers vs. Falcons: Reserve
Falcons QB Bobby Hebert threw
three fourth-quarter TD passes in a
narrow 34-31 loss to New Orleans.
Whether Hebert or Chris Miller will
start at QB is still uncertain at the
time of this writing. In any event,
Atlanta proved that they have the
firepower to compete with anyone.
The Niners currently sport a 1-1
record, courtesy of the Cleveland
Browns. With Steve Young, Ricky
Watters, Jerry Rice, and John Taylor, San Francisco is probably favored. It'll be close but they should
edge the Falcons. Winner: 49ERS.
Other games this week:
Patriots vs. Seahawks: A close one.
Winner: PATRIOTS.
Steelers vs. Bengals: An easy
choice. Winner: STEELERS.
Raiders vs. Browns: Rolling after
Monday night. Winner: BROWNS.
Chiefs vs. Broncos: Piece of cake.
Winner: CHIEFS.
Giants vs. Rams: Who cares?
Winner: GIANTS.
Saints vs.Lions: Noproblem, folks.
Winner: SAINTS.

Four full-fledged races for the finish
The major league baseball races heat up late in the season
By Robert Fleegler
At a timewhen the chances for
peace in theMiddle East lookexcellent and Bill Clinton is introducing
a potentially revolutionary healthcare reform package, I think it is
about time we got down to what is
really important: major league baseball. The final weeks of the baseball
season are upon us and the baseball
gods have given us four outstanding pennant races. Let's take a look
at what we should expect down the
stretch.
The American League
The most heated race throughout the summer has been in the
American League East. At one
point, five teams were dueling for
the title. The Boston Red Sox and
Detroit Tigers have faded, leaving
the Toronto Blue Jays, New York
Yankees, and Baltimore Orioles to
fight it out. The Blue Jays have a 2
1/2game lead over the Yankees and
three over the Orioles as of press
time. Most observers believe that
the Blue Jays have the most talent in
the division and they seem to be
asserting themselves. The Yankees,
whohave missed numerous opportunities to take the lead, seem to be
faltering. The team's slidehascoincided with the inopportune slump
of star first basemanDonMattingly.
The Orioles, who have had a tremendously streaky season, recently
made another run at it The Orioles

and the Blue Jays play their last
series of the year against eachother
in Baltimore. This writer predicts
that Baltimore, led by the
Gehrigesque Cal Ripken, Jr., will
pull it out at the last minute.
Baltimore's likely opponent in
the playoffs will be the Chicago
White Sox. The Sox, who have
beenled by likely Cy Young winner
JackMcDowell and likely ALMVP
Frank Thomas, have a three-game
advantage over the Texas Rangers
and retiring strikeout king Nolan
Ryan. Texas has stayed close all
year because of the tremendous
power of sluggers Juan Gonzalez
and Rafael Palmeiro. But Gonzalez
hurt his back yesterday, and could
be out for several days. Besides, the
depth of the White Sox pitching,
with the stellarAlex Fernandez and
blossoming Wilson Alvarez, will
be too much for the Rangers in the
next couple of weeks. Sentimentally, it would be nice to see Ryan
get to the playoffs in his final year,
but it seems that the White Sox will
likely put Texas away andfaceBaltimore in the American League
Championship Series.
The National League

MontrealExpos basically conceded
the divisionby trying \o trade away
star pitcher Dennis Martinez. The
Expos then won 16 out of 17 to
move withinfiveand one-halfgames
of the Phillies. This has caused the
Philadelphia media to stir up the
memory of 1964, a year when the
Phillies blew a sixand one-halfgame
lead with 12 games left. The Phillies
start a key series today against the
Expos in Montreal that could decide the fate of the division. This
writer believes that history won't
repeat itself and looksfor thePhillies
to pull it out.
Just as the Phillies looked like
a metaphysical certainty in theEast,
the San Francisco Giants looked
like a lock in the West. However,
the Giants' seemingly insurmountable 10-game lead has been erased
by an amazing charge by the AtlantaBraves. The 10-gameleadhas
now turned into a threeand one-half
game deficit. A key reason for this
change has been the breakdown of
the Giants' pitching. Also, the
Braves' acquisition of slugging first
basemanFred McGriffafter the AllStar break energized a dormant Atlanta offense. The combination of
this powerful lineup and the already
stellar starting pitching, led by Greg
Maddux and Tom Glavine, has
pushed the Braves toward a third
consecutive appearance in the NationalLeague ChampionshipSeries.
This writer thinks the Braves will
hold on to theirnew-found lead and
face the Phillies in the playoffs.

New QB leads with awesome air attack

Freshman Straub ready to lead the Garnet Tide into the future
By Amy-Ellen Duke
A new era in Swaithmorefootball began September 11 whenfreshman quarterback Patrick Straub led
the Garnet Tide over Randolph-Macon 24-17.
Forgotten were the thoughts that
Swaithmore wouldbe unable to find
a quarterback who could lead the
passing attack.Erased were the fears
that star widereceiver JoshDrake'94
wouldbe lefthanging. Instead, Straub
filled tall orders: guiding a strong
passing attack by connecting with
Drake for two touchdowns. And he
managed to break a college record
with a9l -yard touchdownrun.
"I was pretty happy with the
results of the game," said Straub. "It
was a great way to start the season. I
was glad to contribute and help the
team.

"I was definitely nervous and
not sure ifI was ready to play football

at this level.But I think Iplayed well
enough to show that I'm ready to

play here."
Swaithmore scored on its first
possession on a 10-yard pass from
Straub to Drake. Randolph-Macon
answered withafield goal and scored
to take a 10-7 lead. With little time
left in the first half, Swat began a
drive down the field. Coach Karl
Miran was hoping the Garnetwould
be able to score a field goal, but with
the help of a few penalties and a onehanded catch by Drake, they were
able to drive 90 yards and Drake
scored with 3 seconds left in the half.
Walking into the locker room, Swat
led 17-10.
"Josh had an amazing game. He
caught this pass and I have no idea
how he stayed inbounds. It was like
Jerry Rice," said Eric Williams '95.
"It was a spectacularpass... Like
walking on a tightrope," saidMiran.
The second half held more surprises for the Garnetand their QB.
With the Garnet deep in their
own territory, firstdown and 17yards,
Miran's plan called for a quarto-back
draw. The result: Straub's 91-yard

touchdownrun thatshatteredthe college record.
"There was a big gap in the
center and he went right through it,
cutting to the left hand side and
booking right up the field," said Bob
Park '95, who recorded 3 tackles.
Miran said: "I called for a quarterback draw. We thought that it
wouldbe okay, but we didn't expect
to make 91 yards."
Straub completed 11 of 20 attempted passes for 113 yards. Drake
had 8 receptions for 93 yards and
DaveReeser '95 rushedfor 93yards.
Tavis Tindall '94 had 12 tackles.
Straub was poised and competed
hard. He just did an outstanding job.lt
was a good game for a veteran, let
alone a freshman. Reeser quietly
strung together a 90 yard game. He
had a couple big plays and broke
some tackles at the end thathelped us

tonight at7:3oinßaltimore. Hopkins
is predicted to win the Centennial
Conference crown and are led by
fifth-year senior quarterback John
Guglielmoand fifth-year seniorlinebacker Stu Markley, who missedlast
season due to a knee injury. Both
were All-CFC two years ago, and
stand as threats to Swat's offense and
defense.
Williams, who hadfour tackles
againstRandolph-Macon, willbe unable to play due to medical school
entrance exams. Park acknowledges
thattheloss will cost Swat's defense.
Thedefensive strategy includes stopping Hopkins' passing attack.
Last weekend, Hopkins defeated
Lebanon Valley, 33-7.
"They have a new defensive
coordinator and ran many different
offenses againstLebanon Valley last
weekend. It was a strong pass rush
and both linebackers looked good.

The defense has to stop the passing
game because that will rip us apart,"
said Park.
The last time Swat traveled to
Baltimore, it lost 14 players to injuries, including star quarterback Chip
Chevalier '93 and linebacker Rob
Ruffin'93. The Garnetalso lost the
game, 47-19. Many attributed the
injuries to Hopkins' artificial surface, but Miran stressed the importance of overcoming any fears of a
repeat occurrence.
"It'slikeifthePhillies go around
thinking about 1964when they lost
a monster lead.". It's a bad thing. We
are a new team with new guys and
win or lose we have another opponent next week," said Miran.
Miran is optimistic: "We need
to show up and pick our game up a
notch over last week, but I think
we're ready to do that."

Women ruggers prepare for season
By Pia Houseal
The Women's Rugby team
opens this Saturday with a game
against major rival Bryn Mawr /
Haverford. The club has beenpracticing vigorously for its opening
game and anxiously awaits a first
game victory.
"The team's main object is to
enjoy ourselves. However, each
year we have becomebetter and this
year we hope to compete at an even
higher level," says Paula Garrett
'95, who is also the club president
This year the forwardline is all
returning experienced players. Involved in this are Jennie Romich
'94, who is also the forward line
captain, Kim Lundgren '94 and Deb
Cunningham '95. Team work between the forward pack and back
line is imperative to the success of a
rugby team. At Swat thisyear, the
backs consist ofreturning younger
players and newcomers. Delta
Ruscheinsky *9s,captainof theback
line, is very enthusiastic about the

two full lines ofbacks the team has
this year.
"On defense it will be important to contain thekicking game and
make good tackles and passes, especially against teams like Bryn
Mawr/Haverford and Princeton,"
says Ruscheinsky.
Ruscheinsky adds that therole
of thedefensive as well as the offensive end of thebackline will be vital
to Swat rugby thisyear. The goal of
thebackline is to score once or twice
a game this year. As Ruscheinsky
says," if we produce yardage and
score, that should be all we need to
win because we have such a strong
defense."
The forward pack is powerful
this year, with all positions filled by
returning players. However, rookie
Bridgette Arbour '97 has done "an
amazing job in our scrimmage: she
made some tackles, a nice run and
good assists," according to Romich.
The forwards are a united force that
need to work cooperatively with the
back. "We are working on commu-

nication. We have the strongest
backline I've seen in four years and
as forwards we are going to be looking to kick the ball to the backs as
quickly as possible," adds Romich.
"The newcomers have been
playing back positions. They look
very promising and workreally hard
to learn the game and become better," says Nicole Jassie '95, a prop
player in the forward line.
In the past, Swat rugby has
come up against many powerful
teams and thisyear will be no different Swat will go into the game this
Saturday as the underdog. According to Romich, "the other team has
more to draw from, having both
Haverford and Bryn Mawr, yet we
are very confident. We have looked
forward to winning seasons and now
I feel we can win every game."
Come out and support your
team this Saturday in a true tricollege event The blue bus will be
leaving at 10:25 am from the Rose
Garden for an 11:00 game. Good

Soccer starts on the ball

Men's team rolls to victories at home and away
By Joe Leahy

In theirfirst home game of the
season last Saturday, the men's soccer team put forth a solid effort and
defeated a strong S.U.N.Y Stony
Brook team. Then, in an away victory whichfinished justbefore press
time, the men put away obviously
outmatched Albright The victories
improved the team's record to 3-1
this year—their only loss coming
from last year'snational champions
last week.
"Stony Brook was a tough
game, but we came through," said
senior defender Ashee Bhan. According to Bhan, an important part
of the victory was Swat's ability to
pressure Stony Brook at the outset
of the game. "We wanted to put it to
them in the first couple of minutes,
so we came out strong right away.
Then they had the advantage for a
while. But in the second half, we
just realized that we were a better
team than they were, andwe went in
and scored some goals," said Bhan.
The team's effort to pressure
its opponent early translated into
early success, when less than five
minutes into the first half, junior
forward Jay Rose caught Stony
Brook offguard, and put a pass from
juniorhalfbackKrister Johnson past
the Stony Brook goalie.
Swat had several more chances
to score in the first ten minutes of
the half, but Stony Brook came on
after that and played the team to a
standstill. Crucial to maintaining
the team's lead was the excellent
play of freshman goalie Shawn

Bundy, who madeseveral big saves
in the waning minutes of the half.
Throughout the gameBundy would
see almost as many shots as his team
would take; Swat outshot Stony
Brook (13-12).
Spearheading Swat's effort to
put some distance between themselves and Stony Brook was sophomore striker Len Cuello, who was
the first of the Swat men to score.
Junior Ben Cook had the assist on
Cuello's goal.
Swat's final goal was an
unassisted shot by senior captain
Jeff Nebelsieck.
In the game against Albright,
Swat showed a lot of muscle, but
not a lot of finesse. Much of that
was due to theconditionof the field,
however. "It rained all day so the
field was pretty rough. That detracted from our usual, control-oriented, style of game," said
Nebelsieck.
Though Albright was the first
team to score in the game, for the
most part it was a lopsided match.
Swat dominated the game and had
numerous chances in both halves
that they failed to convert; overall
the men outshot their opponent 264. The final score was 3-1.
"We didn't play that well...but
we didn't have a lotof luck, either,''
said Nebelsieck."Wecontrolled the
ball about 90% of the time, but we
just didn'tfinish it off."
In the end, though, Swat would
do the job- even if it wasn't pretty.
Rose scored a goal in the first half,
and then Nathan Fairman '95 and
Cook put two others in quick sue-

goals, only one was worth noting.
"Natescoredonanincredibleshot
fromthe corner "saidCook."He turned
itright into theside of the net"
Of the other goals, including
his own, Cook seemed less pleased.
"Wehad a couple offlukegoals, but
they were enough to win. I missed
a lot of empty nets myself. We had
it in their end a lotof the time, but we
couldn't convert to save our lives."
Eventually, however, Swat didfind
a way to put Albright away; the

team's final goal came when Cook
himself put a corner kick in off an
Albright player.
With two more victories under
their belt, the Swattie soccers can
move on and put this week behind
than. But they must hope that an
inability to make big plays will not
continue to plague themlike it did in
the drizzle at Albright. From the
way that the season has looked so
far, though, Albright will most likely
be the exception.
"That's the big difference be-

tween this year and last year

we
are making more of our opportunities. We're not happy with a good
effortanymore; we're only satisfied
with a goal," said Bhan. "Last year
also taught us that any team can beat
us at any time if we let down— so
we have to guard against that this
year. This week we start a stretchof
4 games in 8 days. Hopefully, we'll
stay tough and win all four."
The team'snext two games are
at Western Maryland and Trenton
State, on September 18 and 20.
