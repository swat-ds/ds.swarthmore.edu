says, 4This diversegroup of people

of the seven people on the committee. Henry stresses that no member
of the team will violate the confidentiality of any student.
When asked about the two recent sexual assaults happened on
thiscampus, sheresponds, "the two
victims have not come to me to ask

To educate the campus about

it was unauthorized and misrepresentedthe administration'sposition

Subsequent paragraphs imply
thatthe administrationdoes notprovide adequate support for the Conservative Union to achieve its goal

them states that President Bloom
provided $3OOO, which was far short

letter's author, James Taylor '72, a

While President Clinton is
speaking at Bryn Mawr Monday,
former Senators Paul Tsongas and
Warren Rudman will be right next
door. The Concord Coalition, described by Alison Meloy '94 as an
"educational interest group aimed
at deficit reduction," will be sponsoring a speech by the senators on
Decmeber 13 at 7 p.m. in Marxhall
Auditorium at Haverford.
The senators are in town for a
conference on entitlements, where
Clinton will also speak.
Unlike Clinton's speech, the
speech is open to all Swarthmore
students. In fact, students are the
primary audience. "If we can't solve
the problem now, the students will
solve it for us," said Meloy.
The meeting is a part of the
Clinton Entitlement Conference,
organized by Congresswoman
Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky,
who earnedClinton's attendance in
exchange for her "yes" budget vote.
Meloy called the conference
"one of thefirst national forums on
entitlements." Entitlements, which
make up nearly 75% of the federal
budget, are non-discretionary government grants to individuals: programs such as Medicare, Medicaid,

to conduct a workshop for girls and
women ofall ages on Sunday, Dec.
12, 1-5 p.m. in Bond Hall.
The workshop will serve as a
follow—up discussion for the new
theaterpiece "Growing Up Female"
of Paula Sepinuck, longtime member of the Swarthmore dance faculty. This piece will be presented
on Friday and Saturday, December
10 and 11, at 8 p.m. in the Pearson
Hall Theater, LP AC. In this performance, women of ages 8-90 will
"use music, dance and story to share
personal accounts illustrating how
cultural, racial, classand age differences shapetheirperceptions ofwhat
it means to grow up female in our
society."
In addition, Henry is currently
working on a protocol designed to
provide detailed steps for helping
the victims of sexual misconduct.
She will probably incorporate it into
the current ASAP workshop.
Henry discerns a general indifference ofthe public about the issue
of sexual misconduct. She says,
"Students believe that sexual violence does not happen at Swarthmore. We need an awareness that
there is such a thing happening in
this campus." She also wants to
remind those who are victimized to
seek support. Henry sees being
supportive of the needs of the victims of sexual assault and advocating an awareness and prevention of
sexual assault as two of her most
important functions.

Karen Henry' 87, the new Gender Education Advisor of Swarthmore College, has been adjusting
happily to her new position. When
asked about her working environment, she says, "Many people introduce themselves to me and tell me
how glad [they are] that I am here."
As the GenderEducation Advisor, Henry wants "to be supportive to the students who have been

as the liaison between the deans'

The new editors plan to be open
to any proposals from the administration or Student Council. When
that accord is met, Perrin and Seitz
will ask for a new election to be
held. Both men wanted to make
clear that their actions were not for
self-aggrandizementbutfor the good
of both the campus and the paper.
PerrinandSeitz plan to be in charge
only for thetimeit takes to lobby the

college.
According to Perrin, "Swarthmore loves to complain that The
Phoenix is a poor newspaper, has
bad writers, and is more gossip than
news. There's no way we can ever
have a top-notch campus newspaper whenit depends entirely on volunteer work. The people who work
on thepaper deserve some recognition of their work, and the college
deserves the quality paper that this
kind of commitment can give it."

SCU funding letter questioned
LETTER...from page 1
concern was echoed in the recent Board of
Managers meeting, in which some members
questioned whether the Young America's
Foundation's support was meant to "pursue a
political agenda without reflecting the [actual] view of students."
Gotwalsknew ofalumni who would be
interested in supporting this effort and had
started working together withmembers of the
Conservative Union over fall break. Yet the
letterthat was actually sent came as a surprise
to Gotwals.
Apparently Flynn, who signed the letter
on behalfof the Conservative Students' Union,
inexplicably did not receive a letter sent to
himby Gotwals on November 10thuntil after
the solicitation had been sent. He was concerned that after having givenbackground on
the goals ofthis endeavor and not getting any
response, "although [President Bloom and
Harry Gotwals] both said they would help we,
weren't sure how sincere they were."
Taylor states that the money raised was
notfor die use ofthe Young America'sFoundation. According to Flynn, the only reason
why the money went through the Young
America's Foundation at all was to allow
contributions to the SCU's effort to be taxdeductible. He claims to be working on a way
to attain tax-deductible status for this purpose
without having to channel themoney through
Young America's.
Gotwals notes thatthere are other sources
from which student-initiated projects can receive funding. He notes that Bloom's grant
was particularly generous, considering that
student projects are usually given a considerably smaller portion of discretionary funds.
"To say [in the letter] that they were refused
[funds] because therewas no [perceived] value
in their request is one thing; to say they were
refused becausethey missed a published deadline is another thing."

Several alumni have expressed discontent and surprise at receiving such a letter.
Elise Jones '53, a former member of the
Board of Managers, said in a letter that "this
is the first time in my 40 years as a Swarthmore alumna that I have received a solicitationfor funding for a particular campus activity." Gotwals emphasizes that regardless of
the purpose, "sending solicitations to alumni
that are not authorized is strongly discouraged."
In a conversation with Gotwals, Taylor
saidhe was unaware thatthe alumni directory
could not be used as a mailing list for
fundraising, and both Gotwals and Taylor
have agreed that an explanatory letter is necessary. Gotwals said, "I hope that this letter
would be sent out within the next week" in
order to eliminate "the perception that the
college was not supportive of this effort" to
invite conservative speakers to the campus,
as well as to explain the misunderstanding
which caused such a letter to be sent.

Board meets
By Erik Huneke
This pastweekend, theBoard of Managers
convened forits secondmeeting of the semester.
A broad variety of issues were discussed, the
most important ofwhich were the judicial code,
the Honors system, new public relations efforts,
and a new financial plan.
TheStudentUfeCommitteealso addressed
an article in the Washington Times which referred to students involved in a sexual harassment case by name and painted theway in which
the case was deliberated upon by the deans'
committee in a negative light Resident Bloom
composed a letter which stated that the"article
breached the clause of confidentiality of our
judicial system" and was characterized by an
"incorrect presentation offacts.".

The transition team for the Women's Resource Centerhas decided to postpone
elections for the Board until next semester due to general lack of energy.
A few weeks ago, an all-women's meeting has held. During that meeting it was
decided that a board should be formed to determine the future of the Women's
Resource Center. The Board is to have nine members, with a minimumofthreewomen
of color and two queer identified women serving. This proposal for the structure of
the Women's Resource Center will be reconsidered in the fall of 1994.
Those interested in running for a position on the Board should consider writing
their platforms over winter break. Positions last for one year, so only women who will
be on campus for both the spring and fall of 1994 are eligible to run. Groups which
address women'sconcerns are strongly encouraged to offer a candidate. Elections will
be held within the first weeks of next semester. Keep an eye out for further
announcements.

the city of Chester, the housing development,
and the current efforts underway throughout
the semester (this will give you an opportunity
to choose a program for the rest of the semester).
After the introduction, participants will
be bused to William Perm where they will be
introduced to the residents and begin a successful day ofservice. The threeprojects areas
are:
A Health Survey Team:
Efforts to install a satellite health center
and provide health care for theresidents in the
housing development are currently underway.
Swarthmore students will play an important
role, working withadultsfrom the community,
in conducting a health survey to determine the
needs of theresidents. This group will also be
involved in asthma testing and asbestos testing
sponsored in conjunction with the Clean Air
Council.
Community Center Renovation:
The William Penn Community Center
provides a safe haven for the children of the
development, and is thehome of many Swarthmore tutoring efforts. As a member of this
team, you would join with these same children, to paint murals, build benches, and otherwise renovate their center.
Outreach and Assistance Team:
Working with residents, this team will
directly assist the elderly people of William
Penn, a group given very little attention. Not
only will students have the opportunity to
interact and become friendly with residents,

but they will also work in cleaning their
houses, moving heavy items, and providing
various other forms ofassistance.
After a hard morning at work, participants will be treated to a tremendous lunch.
William Perm residents are eagerly looking
forward to meeting Swarthmore's new freshman and are excited at the possibilities of
working withyou over the coming four years.
During the weekend following the service
day, CIVIC will host its required freshman
service training. The experience working in
Chester will provide you with an excellent
base to begin discussion of Swarthmore's
role in revitalizing the community.
Again, this opportunity is available to
on
you Saturday, January 22 (before you have
any work). Ifyou are interested inparticipating, please contact Beth Greenthrough e-mail
(egreenl) by Saturday evening. In your message, please indicate the top two projects of
interest to you. We, however, cannot guarantee your placement. During the week of
fmals, each team will have a short meeting to
discuss the service day and take care of permission slips and questions.
If you are interested in working with the
community of Chester during your time at
Swarthmore, this is your opportunity. Not
only will you get your hands dirty doing
much-needed work, but you will also be introduced to many residents of Chester. Come
get a feeling for what you would like to do
later in the semester. Take the initiativeMake a Difference!

hegemony

.to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable'

By Andy Perrin
Central to the arguments of our conservative
colleagues is the claim that this campus and die rest of
the nation's universities—to look at the amount of their
publication that comes from off-campus sources—is
subject to an overarching, 'liberal' hegemony.
In previous columns I have pointed out the fallacy
of the 'hegemony' side of that claim; there is no
evidence whatsoever of discrimination by the college
against conservative views, students, or speakers. Indeed, looking at theinstitutional commitment offunds
for this semester'sright-wing talks, itbecomes nothing
shortofludicrousfor theconservatives to complain that
theirviewsare unfairlyrepressed or that they are subject
to institutional discrimination.
Of course, I'm not denying that the campus is
overwhelmingly non-conservative. What I'm saying is
that there's no evidence whatsoever that this nonconservative opinion strain is produced in an atmosphere ofrepression ofarguments and an unfairarena of

This point is illustrated well by the bizarre chart
that appeared in the firstedition oiCommonSense.The
chart, designed to display the 'liberal bias' of the
lectures given at Swarthmore over the past few years,

listed feminists, scientific ecologists, multiculturalists,
policy analysts, and more, all under its simplistic and
unexamined label of 'liberal.'
Thefact is that few pairs of the speakers on thelist
would agree with each other's views, and many pairs
would even consider eachother's politics unexamined
or even harmful. For an example, see many
multiculturalists' disagreements with environmentalist Bill McKibben, listed in the CommonSense list as
ifhe werefunctionally die same aseveryother 'liberal'
speaker who has been here.

that 'imbalance.'

Now,a similar argument has been made against
those of us who oppose the Conservative Union's
ideology. Anybody who read the first issue ofCom-

mon Sense, for example, noticed that it contained
blatant and irreconcilable conflicts with itself. The
editorsbrushed off the criticism by explaining that not
all conservatives agreed with each other.
It is fair to assume, though, that an ideology
labeled"conservative" by the paper's masthead cannot reasonably be expected to be blatantly self-contradictory. How, for example, is it 'conservative' both to
advocate 'diversity' on the frontpage and then to argue
for nearly unrestricted bigotry (in the form of being
intolerantof 'deviance') in the editorial on thesecond
page?
Thedifferencebetweenmy argument—that there
is no homogeneity of political thought here because
what they call 'liberals' differ wildly on a variety of
issues—and theirs, that Conservative Union arguments needn't agree with each other, is based in who
does the labeling.

Clinton stance on families is misguided
By Chuck Stevens

ing to findanother mate, plays as muchofarole
in theadverse effects on thechildren as doesthe
family structure itself. Put another way, I think
that if single parenthood were less of a stigma
and less of a burden in our society it would be
less harmful to children.
But how do we make itless of a stigma?
The coming welfare reform may help, but it
may not. Budget cuts are a priority, and I find
it unlikely that anyone will be saved by
greater welfare benefits to come. There are
too many people to feed and house, and there
is not enough financial support coming to
address everyone's needs. But welfare systems that encourage parents to find jobs
through better benefits and training help to
address the issue (although they also necessitate some form of subsidized day care),
and they might help liberate some single
parents from welfare dependency. What will
not help, however, are sweeping condemnations of single parents, whether self-righ-

teous, as in the case of the Quayle and thefar
right, or simply a bit confused, as in the case
pf Clinton. There are very few people in the
world who will undertake a lifestyle change
because the president has suggested to do so.
Then again, attitudes on this particular subject are hardly about to change.
Legislating to solve social ills is, as they say,
a way fraught with perils. It is possible, though
somewhat disillusioning, that the idea of happy
one-parent families as anything other than an
exception is not feasible. Perhaps, given the state
of our social structure, thereis no way to ease the
burden. Butthere are somecases of well-adjusted
people who do not come from two-parent families; I also believe strongly thatthe fact that many
one-parent families live in crime-ridden, strifetorn cities accounts for a good deal of the emotional wreckage ofthechildren I thinkßill meant
well—l think he truly wants to see more stable
families—butI think, in the end, he's looking atit
the wrong way.

Who would have thought? A year and a
half after former-Vice President Dan Quayle
dragged the "family values" debate into the
spotlight with his attack on Murphy Brown,
he has gained a supporter in his much-maligned quest for a more moral America, or
rather in his policy ofblanket condemnations
of single parenthood. The supporter? None
other thanPresident Bill Clinton, until now an
ideological opponent of Quayle on virtually
every position imaginable. Though Clinton's
unlikely defense of Quayle hedged its bets in
calling the Murphy Brown reference a "mistake" and opining that "[not] everybody who
becomes pregnant out ofwedlockis immoral,"
the sentiment was similar to Quayle's complaint of a "poverty of values," and the implication that marriage is necessarily a purifying, stabilizing force was just as misguided.
Clinton, certainly, managed to couch his
position in considerably less accusatory terms
than Quayle and Quayle's far-right compatriots acquired along the way. There was no

use is 'liberal.' The conservatives, on theother
hand, take a certain sick pride in labeling themselves 'conservative' as a way of setting themselves apart from what they see as a homogeneously liberal' campus.
Thus it is entirely fair, in a situation where
theConservativeUnion sponsors two speeches,
articles, and so on, to point out the areas where
their logic simply makes no sense. That does
not make it reasonable to say that everybody
from Lenin to Al Gore is ideologically the
same.
If the Swarthmore Conservative Union
wants to keep bringing right-wing speakers to
campus, that's fine. I, for one, resent the Office
of the President pouring thousands of dollars
into their project based on a false, trumped-up
charge ofdiscrimination.There is no evidence
whatsoeverof that discrimination, and no need
for money that is needed elsewhere to line the
pockets of the already-rich Young America's

agenda oftheAmerican Right: HeritageFoundation, American Spectator, National Review, the Rand Corporation, Commentary,

Young Americas. In fact, our SCU is so
implicated in a national network of Rightist
institutions that it is able to ignore such
Swarthmore resources as, say, the Cooper
Foundation, which dispenses grants for lectures and performances by a variety of campus organizations explicitly not contingent
on ideological position. Rather, the
SCU is able to fund
its events and newseven paper
through outside sources. This is
all not to mention the
ostensibly "liberal"
media that uncriticallyreproduces the Right's
complaints, nor the grassroots sprawl claimed
by the religious right in its generally
coterminous battle.
Perhaps the most disheartening result of
the SCU's publicity machine has been its
seeming success in convincing its "Liberal"
student audience that the SCU has broken a
silence imposed on it by an oppressive PC
monolith.Mouthing the anti-PC line promulgated in Newsweekalmost weekly, the SCU
claims to endorse openness and thedebate of
substantive ideas.Let's not be fooled by the
embattled tone the SCU has copped from the
National Review. No one is silencing this
discourse. Contrary to the hermetic framework within which the SCU's complaints
rest, Swarthmore is permeated by and implicated in a network of larger power relations.
The SCU's persecution complex is not only
irritating, but insulting to those who are genuinely silenced, even exploited, by the status
quo the neocons celebrate.
It is interesting tonote the way in which our
SCU interprets its own movement. Wisely, the
Swarthmore conservatives have chosen to cull
their sources selectively, avoiding for the most
part the sarcasm that generally foregrounds the
libertarian anxiety proffered as intellectualproduction by the National Review and other neoVictorian humor magazines. Rather, the SCU
has adopted the tactics of Die New Right which
have been proven effective, namely its aggressive appropriation of traditionally leftist tropes/
rhetoric and its reflexive intellectual dishonesty.
In the looking glass worldoftheneoconservatives,
theThomas-Hill hearings become a "lynching."
Theanti-Bork campaign is "McCarthyism The
contras are "freedom fighters," as are the Irancontra criminals. NAFTA is good for Mexicans.
Conservative welfare reform is good for poor
people. Universal health care is bad for sick
people. Indifference to socioeconomic inequalities is laissez-faire justice.
Closer to home, the SCU casts its anti-PC
posturing as a defense of tolerance and freespeech. "Pro-choice" comes to describe a freemarket education. Devoid of any real commitment to social justice, though, the language of
choice, tolerance, and anti-racism becomes an
insulting maskfor the greed and oppression that
theneoconservative platform actually endorses.
If the Reagan revolution has finally ran out of
credit, the Reagan revision continues unabated.
The questions Swarthmore should beasking itself, incontrast toCommon Sense's myopic
list, are not whetherthere is a dearthof conservative opinion on campus. Rather, we should ask

Humortorial: Phoenix on strike, and the bases are loaded
By Ethan Borg
This is the last Phoenix you will see for a
while, unless you are like me, and hoard them in
the bathroomuntil they become so old they begin
towalk and talk on theirown and growhairbehind
their ears. At which point it is always best to let
themfree, because sometimes they can argue with
you for hours on end (odd at Swarthmore, isn't
it?) —which is rather foolish because frankly I

Now I know you don'thave thatmuch time
to spend on the pot, soI'll try to make this as quick
as possible: next semester there will be no Phoenix. This is an awful thing. This is a terrible,
slithering stupidthing. The Phoenixis our paper,

paper—always improving; if you were to say,
why yes, Ethan, the Features section is perhaps
even better than Cats, again, I wouldn't deny it. It
is a fine paper, though a bit under-funded, and
always needy of talent and enthusiasm. Editors
put in long hours to shove this thing in your
boxes—andnotsimply because thosedumbboxes

oldand cranky institution withhair growing from
behind its ears through a Features section that
presents some light fare—a nibbleofhumorhere,
a dose of community there, a revelation about
space-time both here and there—this means a
shutting of doors, the creation of a school with
walls, an empty lavatory. This is an awful thing.
To temporarily destroy this escape would be a
shame, to permanently do so wouldbe acrime. In
culinary terms, we are talking either a wrong-way
evacuation on one side, or a quick through and

I, like most of the staff, decided on a through

administration will snip away some of the
institution's ear hair, so that it can correctly hear

down the paper. Several generations of amoebas

the paper to revive itself. Several students will
implode in that same amount of time.
In quasi-Marxist terms, we're talking about

from whichthispaper was conceived. Inculinary
terms, we're talking about reading the labels,
learning aboutthe ingredients, meconomicterms,
we're talking about the invisible hand reaching
out for a pittance so that editors won't have to
work several jobs,spend over 10hours a week on
this paper, and also pass their courses. In physiological terms, we're talking about slicing off rat
heads so that we can analyze the lipids and
proteins that keep the system functioning like a
very healthy rat and not for example, a very
healthy GeraldoRivera.
Swarthmore, support The Phoenix, revive it
from the dead, or simply wait until its ears get
fuzzy and it talks thetalk and walks the walk.
