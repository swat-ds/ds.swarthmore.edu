Yard addresses abortion conference

Destruction of pro-life signs draws criticism
By Erik Huneke
On Saturday, November 13,
student pro-choice groups from
Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, the University of Pennsylvania, and Cheney
University sponsored a cooperative
conference at Swarthmore entitled
"Mobilizing for Choice: Promoting
Political Action." The event consisted of speeches and workshops
designed to expose current abortion
issues and suggest ways to advance
the political activism of pro-choice
groups.
The conference was a product
of discussions organized by Planned
Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania. Pro-Choice Task Force
coordinators Emily Bromley '95 and
Cherry-Rose Anderson '95, along
withKristin Sostowski '97 andKatie
Klingensmith '97, attended a series
of meetings entitled "Students for
Choice." The purpose of these semester-long meetings was to discuss ways in which to consolidate
the efforts of college pro-choice
groups in the area.
The conference began with a
keynote speech by Molly Yard '33,
the former president of the National
Organization for Women (NOW).
Participants then chose one of four
workshops: "The Politics of Entering a Women's Health Care Center,""HealthCareReform and Abortion Coverage: How the Politics of
Power Violates Women,", and "Political Control, Oppression and Censorship: The Far-Reaching Ten-

tacles of the Religious Right." After a one-hour break for lunch, students attended another one of the
workshops offered in the morning.
The day ended with an "Action
Workshop" in which Elizabeth
Terry, the executive director of
NARAL-PA, provided suggestions
forways in whichpro-choice groups
could increase their political activism.
CherryAndersonremarked that
"historically the Pro-Choice Task
Force has not made a huge effort to
have a college-wide voice. It's so
easy to assume that since a lot of
people are pro-choice, everybody is
pro-choice. I hope it can become a
more important group in dealing
with campus issues." This conference was one step towards achieving that goal.
The appearance of small signs
withsuch statements as "a child, not
a choice" in Parrish Hall and in
some dormitories coincidedwiththe
conference. Shanika Fernando, the
secretary of the Students for Life
organization at Swarthmore, explained that "it didn't seem like a
coincidence that" the conference
"occurred along with sibling weekend" and that her group felt it was
"necessary to provide a voice" for
the pro-life stance, hence the signs.
The signs served several purposes. First, they spoke for pro-life
students who "are afraid to voice
their opinions" and showed them
that "there are other people [at
Swarthmore] that share their view-

points." According to Fernando,
seeing such "short, thought-provoking "messages challenged students
"to think again how they stand on
abortion." Many of the signs were
torn down shortly after they were
posted. Fernando remarked, "When
you take down a sign, you are denying someone the opportunity to be
challenged by another viewpoint."
Bromley considered the signs
"negative propaganda" that constituted an unwarranted response to
the conference. Anderson felt that
"there is room for sincere debate"
and that "it was a sign of their weakness that they were attacking us."
Neither Bromley nor Anderson,
however, condones the destruction
of the signs. The pro-choice bulletin board itself was recently stolen
from Parrish Hall. Both Bromley
and Anderson were especially disheartened thatsuch things happened
on a supposedly tolerant campus
which "supportsfreedom of speech."
In one sense the conference,
and the resulting reaction from prolife agencies, has not been finished.
ThePro-Choice Task Force has not
yet had a meeting to discuss the
implementation ofideas brought up
during the conference. Fernando
also pointed to the need for Students
for Life to consolidate and spoke of
comment boards analogous to the
one put up last semester. The key,
according to Fernando, is to encourage healthy communication
between students on both sides of
the abortion debate.

Series
CEP considers
explores
technological honors changes
frontiers
By Brenda Arellano

By Brenda Arellano
Humanity seems to have a fascination with technology and its
technological toys. This curiosity
prompted some members of the
S warthmoreCollege Computer Society (SCCS) and the Swarthmore
branch of theInstitute for Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (lEEE)
to sponsor a video series on Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality.
The videoseries lastedfor three
consecutive Wednesdays starting
October 27 and ending on November 10. The first video topic in the
series was oncomputer graphic techniques. "Virtual Reality" technology was the next theme for the
series of clips. Finally, Stephen
King's movie, The Lawnmower
Man, which revolves around a Virtual Reality system, ended the series.
"It was really amazing to see
the kinds of things thatresearchers
are doing withthe computer graphics and Virtual Reality," remarked
Marc Rieffel '94, SCCS President
and lEEE Section Chair.
The videos showed clips of
graphics being used in commercials, ray tracing demos, and the
Virtual Reality system. Virtual Reality is a type of technology used
see SCCS...page 3

Things could soon change for students planning to enter the
honors (External Examination) program. The Council on Educational Policy (CEP) is discussing changes that might be made to the
current honors system. The council is looking into ways ofCreating
a more effective honors program. They hope a new program will
motivate more students to choose the honors route.
About 50 students showed up for the Student Council meeting
on November 4 to discuss and voice their opinions on possible
changes. The CEP is suggesting that the requirement of taking six
double-credit seminars be lowered to four. Ithasbeen suggested that
the number of required seminars discourages some students from
going honors. There are, however, some students who are against the
change and would like the current six seminar requirement to stay.
Another change might be that honors seminarswould be given
grades instead of being evaluated only by the outside examiners.
Many feel that grades wouldbe beneficial for students when applying to grad school.
Currently, students who are not in the honors program are
allowed to takehonors seminars. The council has also proposed that
seminars should only be for those in the honors program.
One student taking seminars feels that thehonorsprogram is "a
good mode of learning, but the program needs to examine what
students it's benefiting. The program seems to be geared more for
people who've had a higher background from high school. Other
students are kind ofleft to catch up on their own."
Each department is being asked to submitideas and suggestions
of what they want from thehonors program. There is no time
specification as to when these changes will be finalized, but they
could take place within the next two to five years.
Students can contact their Student Council representatives to
give their opinions. The results of the department proposals probably won* t be finished till theend ofthe year,and the student council
will hold another meeting and take polls on student opinions.
Student Council representative and Council on Educational Policy
member Asahi Pompey '94 noted, "I'm optimistic about what's
going on. I think we're moving in the direction of progressive
change to help serve students."

Children playing at a day-care center. Swarthmore's Day
Care Working Group has been looking at ways to provide day
care to faculty and staff children, but action is expected to wait
over a year.

Day care: wait a
little longer
By Frank Kuo-Hui Yu

For many years the College
administrationhas been looking for
ways to provide day care to the
childrenofSwarthmore faculty and
staff. For example, The Women's
Concerns Committee had convened
to come up with possible solutions,
but their plan never resulted in any
action. The biggest obstacle for
providing this service is obtaining
the amount of funding it requires.
Recently, the administration
again picked up this long ignored
problem and tried to get something
concrete done. The Day Care
Working Group was formed to explore how the day care system
would operate, how to fund the
needed program, where to find a
space for it, and how muchit would
cost.

The members of this working
group are Vice Presidents Bill
Spock '5l and Larry Schall '75,
Treasurer Sue Welsh, Director of
Personnel Linda Fox, Ponna Lisle,
and Sociology professor Robin
Wagner-Pacifici. Spock, head of
the working group, says, "We call
ourselves working group because
we want to get something done. If
you call it a committee, people
have the impression that you are
only talking about it."
They held their exploratory
meeting about two weeks ago and
will reconvene on December 17. It
was hard for the group to get togetherbecause of conflicting schedules. In the meeting, President
Bloom and the working group met
Anne Hansen, the director of Trinity Cooperative Day Nursery in

Swarthmore. Hansen expressed
interest in cooperating with the
working group to come up with
possible day care plans. Hansen
hasn't called since the meeting.
In the meeting, Hansen explained how her center operates its
day care and the amount they
charge. For example, the monthly
rate for full day child care for children from one to two years ago is
$739. Hansen further stated that
thereisn't enough space in her center to provide the day care for all
children ofSwarthmore faculty and
staff. Therefore, finding a space
for day care has become another
hard problem for the working group
to tackle. There is no space available oncampus; however, theyhope
to find a space near S warthmore for
the convenience of Swarthmore
faculty and staff.
The members of the group
want to understand other options
fully. They will later talk to people
at theKendal-Grosslands day care
center. Lloyd Lewis, one of the
board members, is affiliated with
this day care center.
The group is slowly exploring
its options and coming up with
possible alternative solutions by
investigating how other child care
centers work. The Day CareWorking group hopes to come up with a
concrete plan by the end of the
spring semester. The plan, however, will probably not be implemented in the fall of 1994 because
the administration still needs to
solve many problems, such as finding space and funding for this serSee CHILDCARE.page 3

Dean's Official Notice
On November 13 and 14, 1993, a Dean's Committee met for more
than thirteen hours to consider two complaints against a student. One
complaint, brought by Tedd Goundie, was of violating the active-avoidance directive issued by the Deans on October 4. The other complaint,
brought by another student, was of sexual harassment and intimidation.
The members of the Dean's Committee were Lynn Westling, Peter
Schmidt, Tom Francis, Ruth Lieu '94, and Neal Potischman '95. The
Committee was convened by Ngina Lythcott.
All of the information presented was carefully consideredbefore the
Committee deliberated to reach its finding. In the first complaint, the
Committeereached a finding of guilt. The second complaint was dropped
by the Committeebecause after hours of deliberation, it was impossible
to break a tie vote. [According to section M of page 62 of the Student
Handbook, "Decisions of the judicial committees will be made by
consensus. However in particularly difficult cases, or when it is impossible to reach a consensus, a vote may be taken. In the event of a tie vote,
charges against the student will be dropped."] This is neither a finding of
guilt or non-guilt.
The Dean's Committee again deliberated in order to identify appropriate sanctions and decided as follows:
First, the student was given a non-notational suspension for spring
semester, 1994.
Second, the student may continue to be on campus for theremainder
of the fall 1993 semester, but only with the following restrictions:
He must be on probation for the rest of the semester, if
guilty of any other offense before the
end of the semester, he will be suspended.
He must practice active-avoidance of the complaintant;
specifically, he must actively avoid her by keeping at least forty
feet between them. When this is not possible, he should vacate
the spaceno matter who arrivedfirst. When a required academic
event is at issue, the student should work with Dean Bob Gross
or any otherdean to arrange scheduling. It is the intentionof the
Committee that the accused student should adhere to thebroadest definition of active-avoidance; if there is any confusion or
doubt, the student is strongly encouraged to consult with Dean
Grossfor advice. Violationof this sanction will result in another
hearing with the likely sanction ofimmediate suspension and an
extension of his spring suspension.

Swarthmore'sAlcohol Policy
Committee is on the verge of revising the school's policies concerning alcohol consumption and
campus parties.
Although members of the
committee say that the basic collegepolicies regarding alcohol and
partying will not change, several
smaller alterations are nevertheless being considered by the committee. Some of the proposed
modifications include providing
more responsible bartending
through the use of hired bartenders, providing more security at
parties, and separating the alcohol
policy from the party policy.
The policy revision is in accordance with a federal law which
requires a committee to update the
policy every two years. That law,
the Drug Free Schools Act of 1989,
also requires schools to make their
policies explicitly against underage drinking.
Dean Bob Gross, in charge
of the committee, said, "Initially,
whenthat law was passed, we said
we would not comply with it. But
President Bloom and Dean
Lythcott feel that it is necessary
that we do comply."
Gross continued, saying "We

are concerned that our present
policy regarding parties is not being followed. The first year the
policy was enacted, it was observed. But since then, people
have not been following the party
guidelines. We are looking for
more enforcement mechanisms.
We feel that problems of vandalism, sexual assault, etc. happen
under the influence of alcohol."
Committee member Valerie
Threlfall '96 commented, "We're
basically revising theofficial policy
in the handbook, and looking carefully at the whole party scene.
We're not trying torevise the whole
party system; instead, the changes
are designed to make parties better
run, to prevent incidents like the
[alleged] sexual assault of the Bryn
Mawr student [at the Phi Psi party
in the beginning of the year], although we're by no means focusing only on that situation."
"The most visible problem
with the written policy as it stands
now is thatthe wholealcohol policy
is mixed in with the party policy,
and it is very vague," said committee member SamDavis '95. Davis
also mentioned that under consideration was a policy of requiring
differentpermits for differentkinds
of parties, for example, dorm parties versus all-campus parties.

College students who want to get the most out

a panel of educators advised incoming freshmen.
The anonymity of large lecture classes may be comforting in

Students who attend Jesuit
campuses have formed an organization to increase communication
among their colleges and universities, student leaders in the organization said.
Jesuit University Students
Concerned with Empowerment
(JUSTICE) was started in 1992 as
a link between 28 Jesuit campuses
nationwide. Its purpose is to help
the students bond spiritually and
allow them to develop friendships
with students in other Jesuit uni-

versities. Students talk about their
concerns within the university or
the nation. The organization also
serves as a liaison for othercampus
groups that could benefit from the
topics discussed in JUSTICE meet-

ings.
The main event of JUSTICE
that brings its members together is
itsnational convention, which was
held this fall at Spring Hill College
in Mobile, Alabama. In addition
to hearing speakers, the attending
Jesuit students chose a national issue to support for the year. Last
year's issue was AIDS awareness.

Karen Henry '87 chosen for gender advisor
After a lengthy search process, Karen Henry 'B7 has been
selected from more than 100 applicants as the gender education
advisor for the College. The selection committeeâ€”made up of
students, faculty, and staffâ€”narrowed the pool of candidates to
nine, and again to three. The three

finalists were then asked to take
part in day-long interviews at the
College with students, staff, and
administration. All three spent an
hourbeing interviewed exclusively
by men, and had a lunch meeting
with the Women of Color group.
The committeeaskedall interviewers for feedback, based on their
impressions of the three finalists.

Third, the student must practice active-avoidance (as described
above) of the complainant for his first semester back from suspension.
Once again, violation of this sanction will result in another hearing with
the likely sanction of immediate suspension.
Finally, the Dean's Committee would like to remind all students that
intimidationof other students is considered a serious form ofmisbehavior. Attempts to intimidate either the charging or accused student or their
witnesses will result in charges and if found guilty, serious sanctions.

If the changes go into effect,
official monitors will be placed at
parties to check ID's and remove
anyone acting in a disorderly fashion. In addition, the College will
hire a specific person to serve liquor, so that people who are already drunk can be cut off.
Mandatory alcohol awareness
workshops for first year students,
which will take place either after
Thanksgiving break or at the beginning of next semester, will also
be instituted. The workshops are a
result of the committee's desire to
not onlyregulate drinking, but prevent serious drinking problems
among the student body.
Another way in which the
committeeis hoping to look at the
party and drinking scene is through
the use of surveys. The results of
a survey taken last year by Swarthmore students inquiring into the
nature of theirpartying habitshave
just come back to Gross, who pi ans
to release them after Thanksgiving.
Said Gross, "Until now, the
only way we have of getting a
sense of the drinking and party
scene isfrom personal experiences,
anecdotes from RA's and other
students. We never hadany scientific wayof analyzing the situation
until now."

Sloane, one of the student members of the selection committee,
was someone with whom most interviewers "feltcomfortable." Her
strength as a candidate was also
due to her experience with counseling and her familiarity with
Swarthmore. The committee submitted a recommendation to Dean
Ngina Lythcott, who made the final decision.
Henry will report directly to
Dean Masonand work most closely
with Fernando Chang-Muy, director of the IC, Joan Eldridge, director of the BCC, and Gloria Evans,
liaison to international students.
"It'll be a real team approach,"
says Henry.
Henry's duties will revolve
primarily around gender-related issues and sexual misconduct. "And
that does not mean only women,"
says Henry. "Issues of sexual misconduct face the campus, not just

women. I will be trying to make
sure mine is not a position just for
women but forall victims of sexual
misconduct."
Henry will be organizing education around sexual misconduct,
emphasizing prevention. She will
also develop a target group offaculty and staff from which students
can choose, should they ever need
advice on dealing with sexual misconduct. Further, Henry will act
as liaison to the Women's Resource
Center and Women of Color.
As Masonsays, "Karen Henry
and myself will be a team charged
with the wide issues of various
populations at the college thathave
at various timesnot felt completely
included in the life of the college.
We will look at where we might
need to work more systematically
to make the college more inclusive."

Henry will start next week.

Equal Opportunity Committee forms Library sex
President asks for evaluation and recommendations on complaint process
offenses rise
By Andy Perrin
A new College committee, the Equal
Opportunity Committee, has formed to engage in campus-wide education and serve as
a conduit and facilitator for all equal opportunity concerns of the college community.
As one of its projects, the committee
expects to deviseand evaluate a survey which
can provide fairly accurate data on equal
opportunity issues and theireffective implementation.
The committee, chaired by English Literature professor Abbe Blum, is supposed to
represent all constituents of the college: fac-

ulty, staff, and students.
Thefirst major task ofthe committee, at
the request ofPresident Bloom, is to work on
the definition of the new all-college Equal
Opportunity Officer's position.
Committee members are now consulting with their constituencies about thenature
of the job and what candidates should be
considered.
According to Bloom, the committee is
charged with monitoring compliance and
issues regarding the College's equal opportunity policy and acting as a conduit to make
sure equal opportunity complaints get heard
by the appropriate officials.

Campaign challenges
Cuba travel ban

'Freedom to travel' coalition sends groups to Cuba
By Andy Perrin
In October, 175 people from around the
U.S. travelled to Cuba as part of what they
called the "Freedom to Travel Challenge."
U.S. law currently forbids casual travel to
Cuba; theFreedom to Travel group considers
that regulation unconstitutional.
"U.S. citizens have a right to travel that
is guaranteed by the Constitution," declared
Medea Benjamin, director of Grlobal Exchange, one of fifty groups thathave endorsed
the Freedom to Travel Campaign. "We will
continue to challenge this remnant of cold
war policy until the Clinton Administration
makes major changes."
The Clinton Administration is currently
evaluating itsCuba policy while at the same
time considering indictments against theparticipants in the trip. Last week the United
Nations voted to condemn the U.S. blockade
of Cuba.
Myron Simmons, a Philadelphia busi-

nessman who participated in the trip, said "I
went to Cuba because it is my right and my
responsibility to visit countries that are the
focus of our government's foreign policy. I
have been there twice now and it is a fascinating, delightful place to visit U.S. policy towards Cuba is dead wrong and our failure to
aggressively pursue diplomatic rather than
punitive solutions to our differences is damaging to the citizens of both the U.S. and
Cuba."
Philadelphia is the site of one of 36
offices of the campaign, which opened on
November 10. The offices will continue to
promote visits to Cuba to challenge thetravel
ban.
The next travel challenge will arrive in
Cuba today, and a third is scheduled for
December 27 to January 3. The campaign
plans to organize a trip every month until the
ban is lifted, including a major trip in June,
1994,for which it hopes to recruit as many as

500 people.

'Sex by the books' gains
popularity in Arizona
By Jon Burstein
Arizona Daily Wildcat
TUCSON
Indecent exposure is a
touchy subject at the University of Arizona
main library.
In a recent two-week period, six sex
offenses in the library were reported, leaving
police baffled, psychologists trying to provide explanations and library officials saying
they were unaware of the incidents.
"In the past couple months there has
been an increase in incidents, but I have no
idea why," said Sergeant Brian Seastone of
the university's Police Department. "Maybe
people are becoming more tolerant of such
acts."
Nineteen sexual offenses were reported
on campus in 1992, including indecent exposure and voyeurism, police said, while nine
have been reported so far in 1993.
GloriaAvilliar, senior business manager
and library monitor, said she was unaware of
thenumber ofsex offensesreported to police.
Carla Stoffle, dean of the University of Arizona libraries, also saidshe didn'tknow about
the recent sex offenses reported to police.
Larry Morris, a Tucson clinical psychologist, theorized that university libraries are
popular places for people who like to expose
their genitals because there are so many places
to hide and usually a large number ofyoung
females.
People may expose themselves because
they are insecure or lack self-esteem or fear
approaching people in sexual relationships,
said Ken Marsh, head of mental health at
Student Health Service.
"They might pick the library because it's
a high traffic place and they might feel anonymous," Marsh said.
A humorous editorial in the Daily Wildcat suggested that the increase in indecent
exposure and voyeurism was only a side issue. "The real question is, what's so exciting
about the library?" the editorial asked, going
on to suggest that the library could be divided
into "masturbation" and "no masturbation"
sections.
The Phoenix was unable to contact officials at Swarthmore'sMcCabeLibrary to find
out if a similar trend was underway there.

Some practical applications of this technology include architectural walk-throughs
and visualization ofcomplex scientific data.One such example shown was a walk-through
of an ancient Japanese temple that was replicated with graphics.
Some of the other graphics were clips of research that were purely scientific, like
modeling of rippling water, some were humorous pieces, and some were displays of
graphic art. ProfessorEberhardt expressed his excitement over thevideo series and the new
computer technology by saying, "We're getting into a real exciting age where computer

The College also has manyolher programs to budget. Students want better student
services. Faculty want more grants for research and higher salaries. Providing child care
for the children of Swarthmore faculty and staff has not traditionally been one of the top
priorities because of the enormous funding it requires. Spock hopes to explore all possible
solutions and eventually come up with the most efficient solution.
The group will present its finding at the upcoming board meeting, in which the
members of the group will detail their options with the investment committeeand budget
committee. Spbck expressed the hope that the school might start the program small and
increase its magnitude later.

Two separate Pennsylvania police

The street gang known as the "Bloods" has
a new initiation practice. They drive
around without their headlights on and
follow the first car to flash its high beams,
with the intent to kill the driver.
This information, inpart, was provided by a New Jersey State Trooper who warnedthat the
may come across the New Jersey bridges. Reports have also been compiled from
the Norfolk Southern Police Department among other police departments.
Apparently, gang

Ethan Borg's November 12 article: "Coke: Is

as usual for Mr. Borg. Indeed, I find many of

observations acute, but his final diagnosis of the
problem with Coke ads doesn't seem to me nearly
as perceptive as his symptomology. Allow me to
offer a second opinion.
Mr. Borg suggests that"itis our sexual repression which fuels Coke and most other American
industries."The hapless consumer is "unconsciously
propelled to use their services. Why? Because sex
is so unacceptable in our culture...."
Reading thisjam compelled to wonder what
other, more sexually liberated cultures does "Mr.
Borg have in mind? Are there countries that have
saved themselves from the (quite real) cultural
ravages of consumerism and sex-as-commodity,
simply by letting go of their inhibitions in some
unspecified way? And if we compare our own
decade to past decades less accepting of sexual
expression, do we find that sex now figures less
largely in advertising than it did then? I think not.

A new stress release for
Swarthmore students?
By Jonathan Seitz
Sometimes there are

events

that just cry

out to an editor to be written. This week,

WHYY (the local National Public Radio affiliate, for the uninitiated) had just such a
storyâ€”a story that had Swarthmore written
all over it. And I am most assuredly not
making this up.
The news story was about a dance company in Philadelphia that had come upon a
vast untapped musical resource: the human
body. Now, you might say, Bobby McFerrin
has been making music in this way for years.
But McFerrin can't hold a candle to these
folks.
The dancers useno music, onlyrhythms.
The rhythms are created by the dancers hurling themselves against the walls of the dance
studio, and falling face first to thefloor. Why
in the world, you ask, do they dosuch a thing?
I haven't the foggiest idea. The report did not
say.
Nonetheless, this seemedlike the perfect
stress reliever for Swarthmore students. If
you are torn between a Nirvana concert in
Philly and the dance concert in PAC, why not
combine them? It's a dance concert and mosh
pit all in one!
But then the report moved on. It turns out
that this dance troupe conducts classes in
which real parents bring real kids to these
people. And what do they teach the kids?
How to dance by slamming themselves into
the wall and then spinning around in time to
impact the floor face first. One of the members of the group commented that the first
time thekids try this, they look to their parents
standing a little ways away, as if to ask "Did
it hurt?" When the parents look unconcerned
(!), thekid decides that it must not have hurt
much. Pain, the ddncer commented, is still a
new and exciting experience for these kids.
(Note that this does not explain why the
dancers, no doubt more experienced in the
pain department, choose to do this.)
That was when the truth struck me. This
dance method is not the perfect stress reliever
for Swat, THIS IS SWAT!! Just think of the
correlations: Our parents pay the College
$26,000 a year. Those of us stupid enough
takeOrganicChemistryl(WHACK!,THUD!)
look at our grades (parents) and say: it didn't
hurt too much. Then we go and take Organic
Chemistry II (WHACK!, THUD!). By the
time we get the third test back (with the mean

of65%, i.e., great shooting pains throughout
the body), it's too late. We've hit the floor.
For more parallels, look at the Engineering
majors (WHACK!, THUDL..WHACK!,
THUDL.WHACK!, THUD!...) The parallels hold for your major tooâ€”don't deny it.
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
about the social life 'round here.
Other observations:
â€¢Congratulations to the genius who sent
NewsWatcher to everyone on the [students]
alias. Way to get all campus e-mails discontinued! Crashing the e-mail server was a nice
way to prove the maturity of some people
around here.... Fortunately, there's no all
campus voice-mail (I checked), or we'd all
probably be getting copies of the same person
reading the Gettysburg Address or something.
â€¢And why is it that so many people
around here think it's sooooo cool to forge email or send anonymous messages? People,
it's easy. We know. You don't have to prove
it.
â€¢LIBERATE THE NAPKIN HOLDERS!! For those of you who don't use napkins, and thus haven't noticed, the napkin
dispensers have been evicted from their native homes in the middle and small rooms.
They are being held against their will in an
undisclosed location in Sharpies. There will
be a letter-writing table in Parrish next week
for you to help these senseless victims...

mean, for you to help these victims of this
senseless crime.

near a Sharpies Pasta Bar, s/he loses all sense
of temporal reality. I've seen snails on glaciers move faster than the Pasta Bar line. In
fact, people havebeen spotted who appear to

NOT IN THERE, FOLKS! They're all the
sameâ€”gooey and soggy! Slap a spoonful on
your plate, and move on to the complex decision making process of choosing the perfect

â€¢Finally, for those of you who have actually read this far: Shouldn't you be doing
something more productive with your time?

shooters, junk mail, packaging. Likewise, with
phones, TV's and computers comes a deluge of
advertisements, sitcoms,soaps, sound-bites, allcampus mailings and automated calls: blatantly
impersonal information whichyet insists that itis
central to our lives.
How much easier itis to have sex partners,
friends, neighbors, or family members trapped
behind a glass wall, or pre-recorded on a phone
line, unable to really touch us or, worse, argue with
us or (horror of horrors!) get to know us. How
much cleaner to live out theirsterilizednarratives
man to attempt our own sometimes messy and
ridiculous stories! TV Sex is far safer, bothphysically and emotionally, than sex with areal person
could ever be. But it is no longer a mode of
interaction between people, with all the unique
risks and joys such interactioninvolves. Rather, it
is separable from ourselves; we can turn it on or
off, manipulate the volume. There is nothing
human left in it Sex becomes like sweating, a
bodily function, no more.

TV Sex also entails that well-known evil,
theobjectifieation of thesex partner. Understanding sex as something purchased, by flowers, an
expensive dinner, or"therightmoves," allows us
totreat thefocus ofour desireas a desirable object,
to be purchased ami used, rather than as a person
with feelings and rights, someone withwhom we
migntconverse. When a person says "No," itis to
be taken seriously; when an object says "No," it
is a meaningless curiosity.
True, many, perhaps all, of us do still have
misconceptions about sex. Leamingto talk openly
and frankly about it is a worthy goal,personal or
intellectual, for anybody. I approveof sensitive,
open-minded discussionsofsex in and outside of
the classroom. But in liberating the libido, let's
hot let it fry free of our emotional, social, and
spiritual lives. Let's instead recall the values of
intimacy, commitment, and caring. Despite, or
perhaps because of, the emotionalrisks, there are
rewards to bereaped if we learn to see sex firstnot
as drive or commodity, but as one way we can
grow to love said understand one anotherbetter.

Article is unfair and biased
Dear Editors:

I am not acquainted with Phyllis Fry, nor had I heard the name until I read the article
entitled "Phyllis Fry departs from the College" by Mark Osterweil in the November 12 issue
of The Phoenix. Even without direct knowledge of the events described or the participants
involved, I would like to cite this article as an example of very irresponsible journalism, and
both the author and the editors should be ashamed for publishing it.
First of all, Osterweil never substantiates why Fry is one of the most "respected and
appreciated staffers" of the Computing Center. The only examples given of people who
became very "upset and confused" at Fry's departure are Margaret Patterson (who she is,
Osterweil never explains), and, of course, Mark Osterweil himself, whose opinion is obvious
throughout the entire article.
Osterweil describes the resignation as "forced" without any substantiation besides the
testimony of Phyllis Fry herself. Osterweil then explains how, "[apparently, Fry had. been,
quite by surprise, confronted by Directors of Computing and CommunicationServices Judy
Downing and Professor Boccio." Although Osterweil presents this as fact, it is based, once
again, on the sole testimony of Phyllis Fry. Osterweil continues describing What Fry did, rather
than what she said she did, which is surely all that he can possibly know. Osterweil later
describes Fry's concern for those who depended on her, something that Osterweil does not
even support with a quote by one ofthose who did depend on her.Whether or not the "Fry story
touched a sensitive spot" with Boccio and Downing is something that the reader will infer
based on the given "facts," but Osterweil shouldnot be telling us how to interpret these "facts."
When Osterweil states that "Phyllis Fry had been a hard-working employee" and that "she
was also a dedicated member of the College community" he is just spouting his own personal
opinion. Osterweil tells us that her resignation is "a loss for all of those who knew her," but this
is just conjecture, and Fry's description ofhow Downing and Boccioforced hertoresign very
obviously contradicts this statement. Lastly, any editor shouldknow better than to let a new!s
article end with the author's opinion such as Osterweil's conclusion: "She will be missed."
A proper course of action for The Phoenix would first be to apologize to the College for
presenting them with very unreliable accounts of the news. Then, Osterweil and the editors
should apologize to both Judy Downing and Professor Boccio for damaging theirreputations
with unfounded allegations.
Sincerely,

seems quite likely that there are a

idea was that pro-lifers have nary a
trace of hypocrisy in them (you say
you're pro-life, but you don't particularly care to address those
women who die because they can't
fund abortions?), and thatthose who
opposeabortion would never dream
of extramarital attachments that
might contravene theirbe-individually-responsible creed. To take the
most blatant examples, what say we
look at the philandering leaders of
thereligious right, say, Jerry Falwell
or JimBakker, whom we might well
characterize as promiscuous? Again,
one should avoid generalizations.
I'm intrigued by Mr.
Schuchardt's source of statistics.
Just as his assertion several weeks
ago that second-hand smoke-induced cancer can only develop in a
non-smoker if he inhales smoke for
several years in a locked windowless closet sounded suspiciously like
something from an R.J. Reynolds
study, his citation of figures such as
"abortion will increase [women's]
risk for breast cancer by fifty percent,""pelvic inflammatory disease
increases of thirty percent," or
"ninety percent of all post-abortive
women suffermental illnessesranging from depression to suicidal tendencies" sound like something from
the far edge of the facts.
Frankly, it doesn't make much
sense to me that a surgical procedure involving the abdomen increases the chance for breast cancer
by fifty percent. The idea of trying

chart mental illness and attribute
it to abortion is a way fraught with
perils. How many of those same
women suffer those same mental
illnesses after childbirth? (Ever hear
of postpartum depression?) After
any surgical procedure? After having to carry an unwanted child to
term? And before you label this
mental illness thing as conclusive,
find me someone who doesn't suffer from depression.
Counseling against abortion because some may react unfavorably
(and it's a shaky cause-effect situation) is analogous to warning against
pregnancy because some suffer
morning sickness. Perhaps there
wouldbe a lowerincidence of mental problems if getting an abortion
didn't entail so much harassment.
Space is short, I've already
gone on too long, so this little ride
must endhere. The pro-life side has
its points; certainly, there are those
who might unfairly characterize
abortion as a bed ofroses, and turn
a blind eye to the mental consequences of a poorly-thought-out
abortion procedure. But neither is
the pro-choice position as simple or
as narrow-minded as you might
think. It's your right to find fault
withthe notion of rushing into abortions and not considering the humanity of the child in question,
but it's also the right of others to
make thatdecision thoughtfully, and
deal with the consequences of a
murky problem for themselves, not
have their decision handed down
from on high. As Ross Perot might
say, it's not that simple.

By Sylvia Chong
With only two fraternities on campus, perhaps Swarthmore College is not die best place to
observe brotherhood at its finest Maybe this is a
blessing, for Swarthmorehas not had to deal with
dieproblems of vandalism, hazing, sexual harassmentand assault, anti-intellectualism,homophobia
andracism to the extent that larger universities may
encounter. But Swatbrothers are far from immune
to theseproblems, and muchof the lack of respect
on campus for fraternities is quite justified. However, my objections to fraternities, as institutions,
are broader than my particular feelings for
Swarthmore frats, and rest mostly on thetraditions
and values of fraternities nationwide. This is a
critiqueoffraternity as cultural icon, as a structured
organization, as an institution with anoted history
ofperpetuating poor attitudes towards women and
minorities, and as a severe reflection of problems
society shares as a whole. This is a glance at the
whole forest, and not the individual trees that stand
within it.
I won' t begin by harping on thehorrorstories.
A quick glance at the media will reveal more than
enough incidents of pledges dying from hazing
rituals, of women being gang raped and sexually
assaulted, of violence and vandalism motivated by
racism, sexism, homophobia, and (of course)pissass drunken misjudgment. Fraternities complain
that the media focuses solely on these "isolated"
and "rare" occurrences, which are supposedly
unrepresentative of the actual experience ofbrotherhood.But theseincidents stirup theoutrage they
dofor twomajor reasons: one, that adisproportionate number of sexual assaults and othercrimes on
college campuses involve fraternities, and two,
thattheseincidents are only the severest symptoms
ofdeep-rooted beliefs coded into fraternity life. If
it seems appalling that 7% of the population possesses 84% of the wealth in America, then it is
equally appalling thatat the University of Illinois,
63% of the rapes reported on campus are committed by brothers, who make up 25% of the male
population.
But the unreported incidents disturb me far
more, for they are morepervasive and more difficult to eliminate.Thesamebrotherswhodenounce
rape will then turn around and play "scoring"
games in which women are objectified into numbers representing sexual conquest, never realizing
thatboth these things are symptoms of the same,
deep-rooted sexism. The same fraternal camaraderie that attracts men to fraternities becomes a
weapon against its detractors, especially women
whofall victim to one ofthose "isolated incidents"
that makefor suchbad press.At the University of
Tennessee, fraternities, especially the prestigious
football fraternities, are considered so important
that even substantial reports of rape are swept
underthe rug so asnottodisturb thefootball season
and the reputation of the brotherhood. An air of
secrecypervades most fraternity on-goings, so that
brothersfeel safefrom thecensureof thoseoppressivePC voices on campus; often,however, secrecy
breeds complacency, and the one brother who
won't "lighten up," and then takes the sexist and
racist jokesofhis fellowbrothers tooseriously, and
goes out and commits yet another "isolated incident Oneaberrantbrother gets kicked out parties
get toned down, and everything seems to be under
control... until thenextincident bredfrom thesame
fraternity valuesthat change littlefrom year to year.
Of course, I am being narrow-minded by
generalizing and dwelling on the negative. I'm
ignoring all the good that fraternities promote: a
sense of community,civic service projects, leadership opportunities, strong friendships. But let's
"

face it: people do not pledge for the opportunity to organize a blood-drive, or to enhance
theirresumes. Ifastudentreally wanted to do
charity work, they'd be far more helpful by
joining an actual community service group.
No, students pledge be-cause of the fantasy
offrat life: the beer, the babes, the brotherhood. Entering college is a rough transition
for most students, and opting for the fraternity life is an attractivealternative to braving
the social waters by yourself, with only the
fleeting friendships offreshman life to help
you along. Unconditional loyalty is what a
fraternity provides, especially in the area of
reinforcing a tenuous, barely post-adolescent masculinity.
This recipe for instant friendship is
marred by the values of the fraternal community. In striving for acceptance from
fellow brothers, men will do just about
anything: work forcharity, steal aroadsign,
break into someone's room, drink until
they puke, or (at the most extreme) gangbang a drunken woman. These rituals are
seen as therite-of-passageofmany collegeage boys into manhood, and rarely are
questions askedabout the validity of these
rituals. Granted, things do change, and
fraternities have made an effort to reform
themselves and adapt to changing norms.
But often, the spirit behind such changes
make the reforms seem largely cosmetic,
for they don't challenge the fundamental
values behind the spirit of''fun and games"
and serve only to reinforce that line of
tradition that will always remain the same.
Fraternities aren't innovators. They benefit
from their link to the Establishment, from
the weight oftheir History. Take thataway,
and they are no differentfrom any other
social organization on college campuses.
Toremain unique, fraternities must appeal
to these connections. And the alcoholwomen connection, because it leads to the
debauched "isolated incidents," is nearly
impossible to clean up. I cannot blame
fraternities as the source of all societal
woes, but certainly, fraternities exacerbate,
intensify, and even encouragethedark side
of community and loyalty. Even though
street gangs and sports teams are often
accused of encouraging the same type of
negative behavior fratemi tiesoften exhibit,
fraternities are more insidious justbecause
ofthe sheer number of men who join them,
and because of the institutional structure of
the fraternities that allows these behaviors
to be passed downfrom brother to brother
like a family heirloom. Sports teams are
generally more fluid in structure, and gangs
are not socially accepted and even admired
in the way fraternities are.
Don't get me wrong. I go to frat
parties. I play some of the same games. I
even like some of the brothers, as individuals. And I perpetuate my share of societal
problems as well.But the institution of the
fraternity is like a rotting forest that tries to
divert your attention from the stench by
planting a few, sweet-smelling trees. It is
not a garden. It should stop pretending to be. It
stinks from theverybasis ofits growth. And unless
reform can, ona national-widelevel, change these
perceptions about fraternities, and unless these
"isolated incidents" become truly isolated and
scarce, I for one wouldnot mourn for the demiseof
fraternities. Even if they did provide a keg at the
funeral.

Fraternities play crucial role
By Jude O'Reilley
Where there is no room for reflection, there is none either for justice or

prudence.

â€”Simone Weil, 1940
Rarely at S warthmorecan one see
thebreakdown ofcritical thinking more
quickly than in thediscussion offraternities. The word draws instant and
largely uninformed reproach from
minds presumably finer tuned on issues with less rhetorical safety. Many
of these attacks share common monolithic themes, reflect archaic and
cliched notions reserved for few other
institutions and rest on tenuous innuendo as evidence, inadmissible in any
other discussion. Secure in a vast and
mistybody of insinuation, the freelance
socialcritic trades necessary construction for destruction. He or she neednot
refer directly to racist or misogynist
policies or practices but can merely
infer them. The boldest will fabricate:
last weekend rumors circulated that
Phi Psi was raffling off my sister for
sibling weekend. (At 6'l" with the
bangs, she was not amused.) This approach does a great disservice not simply to fraternities but to the progress of
liberal dialogue on this campus as a
whole. Nevertheless, it is the subtext
that underlies any debate on fraternities, no matter how formal, and so it
shall be these myths that I will in this
space hope to discredit. In the process
I might just get one more person to Phi
Psi' s Seventies Party on Saturday.Let's
discuss...
Historically fraternities havebeen
racist; thus any move to diversify now
is more cosmetic than genuine. I can't
speak for the long-term history offraternities as a whole, Swarthmore or
anywhere else. My suspicion is that
theyprobably were blatantly racist here
and elsewhere. In 1963,Phi Kappa Psi
broke from the national organization
partly inresponse to the perception (or
reality, I wasn't there) of its acceptance ofracial intolerance and became
independent as Phi Omicron Psi. As a
skeptical, non-fraternity editor of The
Phoenix wrote that year, "The firm, if
overdue, decision of Phi Kappa Psi
(nee) to divorce its tainted national
weakens the rational position of those
us who oppose fraternities for their
exclusiveness. Now, it takes an irregularity of personality, not blackness of
skin, to leave an eager applicant
unrequited" (April 23, 1963). The results of this decision are apparent today. Even without targeted minority
recruitment Phi Omicron Psi is currently made of 50% percent ethnic
minorities. In a campus with lots of
'
policies on racial acceptance, lots of
speeches on creating a "multicultural"
environment, it's nice to find the occasional
reality.
You're all a bunch o' drunks. Now we're

talking. Many of usare in fact drunksbut many
are not Please keep in mind a numberof things
in our defense: A) Drinking is not all of what
we do but is in fact just the one most easy to
identify from the outside. B) Phi Psi has an
optional non-alcoholicprogram that is stressed
early in therush process and that has, believe
it or not, actually been applied. (I imagine
Delta Upsilon has a similar policy.) The occasional religion major does comes through. C)
The campus as a whole does not pay directly or
indirectly for Phi Psi parties or activities ofany
kind unknowingly. Neither DU nor Phi Psi is a
campus funded group; Phi Psi survives solely
on dues and occasional alumni funding, DU
has dues and an alumni endowment.
Fraternities are inherently misogynist,
because they exclude women. Misogyny and
fraternities both exist at Swarthmore. Some
misogynists in black turtleneck sweaters and
berets quote Nietzsche and chuckle to themselves in the basement of Palmer. Some misogynists in hockey jerseys and baseball caps
quote their high school football coach and
snicker in Sharpies. Both would exist without
fraternities. Contrary to what you might think,
we don't sit around at these meetings and forge
plans to sustain hetero-patriarchal global hegemony. We can hardly get our keg-a-rator to
work! The absence of women allows for a
different kind of dialogue between men than
would be possible otherwise. But it hardly
allows for rampant misogyny any more than
the converse condition assumes male-baiting
and Schlafly-esque feminist plotting at the
Women's Center, Grapevine, or Women's
Rugby.
Fraternities promote an unsafe environmentfor women. Fraternities on this campus
have an undeniableand absolute responsibility
to create an environment safe for all. Phi Psi
brothers are chosen not simply for their good
looks and charmbut for theirbelief in this goal.
If a prospective pledge is found not to conform
to this basic requirement, he does not receive a
bid and he is told why. This is not a policy we
developed yesterday, but one that has been
actively implemented at Phi Psi since I have
been a brother. Both Phi Psi and DU have
internal by-laws condemning sexual assault
and harassment. Zero tolerance for such behavior at Phi Psi was reaffirmed this semester
by a unanimous vote with no abstentions. This
means not just increasing security at parties
but working for change, as individuals and as
a brotherhood, in groups like Friends of Survivors. None of us in the fraternity system have
any vested interest in becoming a harbor for
violence towards women.
I joinedPhi Psi because they were a group of
guys thatdidn'tlooklikemy Midwestern graduating class, because they allowed me to express my
own opinions as they were free to express theirs.
Fraternities have a responsibility to speak articulately for a certain segment of our community th at
might otherwise remain silent Men historically
have been a sizable missing piece in gender dialogue. Now we're not about to start passing the
talking stick and holding sweat lodges, but we will
continue to represent a less two-dimensional versionofmasculinity. Only then can issues that affect
the entire community be addressed by the entire
community and not simply the active few.

Swat on the Rez, South Dakota

Claudia Fagioli greets students with a smile at her station in Sharpies. Fagioli
tries to learn students' names and faces while on her job as a Sharpies checker.

By Rachel Meyers
"My dog chewed it." "It got in the laundry and disappeared""Iforgot it, OK? OK???"
These are just a few of the many excuses,
ranging from the creative to the mundane, that
Sharpies checker Claudia Fagioli has heard in
her 14 years as a Swarthmore employee. "I
can tell by their face; when students come up
to me, this person doesn't have their ID," she
said.
Fagioli, a familiar face at lunch and dinner, enjoys getting to know the students who
pass by on their way to eat. Every year, "I get
my Cygnetbook and look at theirpictures and
study them so when people come in they don' t
feel like no one here knows them. I say, 'Hi,
Jenny' and they say, 'How do you know my
name?' and we become friends," Fagioli ex-

Of course, the job has its drawbacks.
Fagioli is annoyed by students who deliberately try to sneakinto Sharpies. "I'm a grandmother and a mother, so I have eyes in the
back of my head....l call them back but since
we can't leave our stations, some of them get
away."
Fagioli is also active in the Swarthmore
community and in her hometown of Clifton
Heights. Last year she served as a staffrepresentative on theDining Committeethat helped
to chose Swarthmore's new self-run dining
service. She noted, "I'll volunteer for anything that will make [the dining service] better for students."
In addition to her involvement at Swarthmore, she was a member of the town council
ofClifton Heights for 24 years, and is about to

In fact, she becomes so friendly with
some students that "it breaks my heart when
they leave." Still, there is consolation in each
new batch of freshman faces. "There were
times when I wouldn't go to graduation exercises because I would cry a river," Fagioli
said, "but I got over it."
Fagioli started at Swarthmore working
on the deli line, which was then full-serve.
She later moved upstairs to checking and has
been there ever since. "I feel very fortunate
and lucky that I've got the kind of job I want
to go to every day," she said, adding with a
smile, "I don't really consider it work." The
job has become a family tradition, since her
daughter Michelle also works as a checker in
Sharpies.
"Thekids keep me young,"Fagioli noted
"When you work here, you can't be old in

As tax collector, she takes in local taxes
for Clifton Heights and the Upper Darby
school district, an amount that totaled just
over $3 million last year. "I keep the records
straight, deal with mortgage companies and
taxpayers, and turn the money over to the
borough and school district authorities,"
Fagioli explained "Now that's a challenge!"
Fagioli appreciates the openness of
Swarthmorestudents, andnotes, "These young
students are accepting me at my age as a
friend. Sometimes they want to get away from
their parents and grandparents, but I think
some people enjoy having someone my age

Rose came to S warthmore in 1967,and this
is the only teachingposition thathehas everheld.
"I had a strong desire to teach at a place like this,"
says Rose. "I had a desire to make the job of
teaching a personal one, and to be in an environment thatvalues teaching and enables teachers to
become involved with students, not only in the
classroom. I value having lasting friendships with
students after they have left." So, he says he

However, Rose does experience some frustrations along with thebenefits that he has gotten
out ofhis career. "To some extent, we teachthe

How to cook
duck & tuna
Phil Weinstein shares his

culinary knowledge
By Professor Phil Weinstein
Here are 2 of my recipes, both adapted
from earlierversions. The first is sumptuous,
quirky, takes time, and needs 4 people to
justify. The secondis quick and perfect for 2.
Roast duck (adaptedfrom Proust's wild
duck with cranberries)
Ingredients: 14-5 pound duck, 1 sliced
onion, 1/2 cup chopped onions, 1/2 bottle
cooking red wine, 1 cup cranberries (raspberries may be substituted), 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2
cup white wine vinegar, 20 coriander seeds
(or good sprinkling coriander powder), 20
peppercorns (or goodsprinkling pepper), cinnamon stick (or good sprinkling ground cinnamon), and 1/8 teaspoon basil.
1) Preheat oven to 350 6 prick duck skin
with fork all over (to allow fat to escape),
season with salt and pepper, add chopped
onion, then cook uncovered for 1 3/4 to 2
hours (I like my duck overdone, so I usually
go the whole 2 hours). After duckhas cooked
1 hour, prick its skin again (you may need to
drain the fat away) and return to the oven for
remaining cooking.
2) As soon as duckis in the oven, brown
giblets in duck fat, add sliced onion and basil,
sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with
water (about 2 cups) and simmer this duck
stock.
3) Prepare base of sauce by slightly
browning sugar in saucepan, then pouring in
the vinegar and reducing until 3-4 tablespoons
left (be careful hereâ€”the sugar will petrify
when the vinegar is added; stir it back into
liquid condition while reducing). Add wine,
cinnamon, basil, coriander, and peppercorns;
reduce over low heat to about 1 cup.
4) When duck is done, remove and keep
warm; pour out fat (which is clearâ€”reserve
darker color liquids and onion in pan), use a
bit of sauce to deglaze the pan (thus retaining
everything that has stuck); add this to sauce.
5) Take your simmering duck stock
(should be about 1 or 1 1/2 cup) and add to
sauce; reduce sauce to a total of 1 1/2 cups;
thicken to desired consistency with some cornflour mixed in a little water (be careful
cornflour thickens powerfully).
6) Add cranberries or raspberries to
sauce, stir carefully to heat them through and
give them flavor.
7) With a strong carving knife, quarter
the duck, removing the backbone, and serve
with sauce. Your diners will not mind working the meat free from the remaining bone.

Grilled tuna steak
Ingredients: tuna steak for 2 (preferably thick cut, at least 3/4 inch and up to a full
inch, about 6-8 ounces per person), 2-3 tablespoonsofolive oil, good sprinkling of ground
dill, 2-3 tablespoons of fine chopped onion, 1
tablespoon of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of
balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.
1) Prepare marinade by mixing olive oil,
balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, dill, chopped
onion, salt, and pepper: pour into a flat glass
or enameledpan.
2) Put tuna steak in the marinade for 30
minutes, turning every 5-10 minutes (keep
covered for the best marinade results).
3) Remove tuna from marinade and,
over hot coals, preferably on an oiled grill that
may be separately maneuvered (so as not to
push the fish around too much), cook tuna 3
minutes per side (near the flameâ€”you want
some char). Do not overcook.
4) Remove tuna and serve immediatelyâ€”it will be quite pink and moist inside.

By Adam Blakeley & Will Buttram
W: I'mbaaaaaaaack!!!!
A: Yee-ha. So now we can go back to
ripping off Johnson at the Movies, eh?
W: Does that preclude us from talking
about the movies?
A: Noâ€”we justcan't say anything intelligible about them.
W: So muchfor the"moral high ground"
approach. Anyhow, to the movies, you tool.
And I believe you have an apology to make?
A: Yeahâ€”l didn't see this week's first
movie. Sorry, Willâ€”you'll have to take it.
W: That's all rightâ€”l owe youfrom last
week.
A: Hey, that'sright. So, this Friday, we
have a movie I haven't seen. Will will tell you
all you will want to know about it. And then
we'll both tell you about Fast Times at
Ridgemont High, a movie you've all seen
before. It's playing Saturday night at DuPont
(7:30 & 10p.m.).
W: Well, A Room With a View is playing
on Friday, also in DuPont, also at 7:30 and 10
p.m. Go figure. Anyway, what we've got
here this weekend is a juxtaposition of the
ultimate chick flick and the ultimateguy flick.
Both are classics of their genres, movies that
many people have seen many times. If you
haven't seen thesefilmsyou can probably get
a detailed review from whomever is sitting
next to you at this moment. If you're a loser
and are all alone, then I'll fill you in on it.
A: Easy, Will. That describes you as of
late.
W: OK, never mind. On with the review! Room is a great movie about coming of
age in Victorian society. There's beaucoup
de romance and sappy musicâ€”itmakes for a
great movie to see with your sweetie. Maybe
the perfect movie for just that occasion. It's
also fun to see to inspire you to go out and find
that special someone.
A: Even if you have to leave the country
for a week?

W: Ahem.... As I was saying, Merchant
and Ivory do a fantastic job adapting this E.M.

Forster novel for the big screen. Helen
Bonham-Carter is perfectly cast as the budding heroine, and lookfor an incredibly subtle
performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as her notso-beau beau. He is really fantastic. If you
likedHoward'sEnd, then, well, you've probably seen this flick, but if you haven't, make
it a point to. Breath-taking scenes of European countryside, beautiful Victorianhomes...
A: All right, already! I think we get the
picture. If you feel like being absorbed by a
sensitive movie then go see A Room With a
View. If you're in the mood for a VERY
different kind of cinematic experience, then
hold out for Saturday night and some fast
times.
W: AtPhiPsi? Palmer lounge? Tarble?
A: Ridgemont! Circa '81!
W: 'B2, actually.
A: Anyway, we're talkin' feathered hair,
prototype stoner-surfers, and... Missile Command! Ah, those were the good old days.
These objectsofreminiscing makeFast Times
at Ridgemont High a fun movie. By P.C.
standards, it's a little rough, but if taken
merely at face value it's a load of laughs. It's
about high school kids just being kids.
Andy: It's funny, themovie's only really
about a bunch of adolescents trying to get
laid.
W: One of the oldest plots there is!
A: It's basically Shakespeare.
W: Basically, (gives quizzical look)
A: (returns withhis permanently quizzical look) I mean, it is.
W: I guess no one can really argue with
that, except for the fact that there are no
corpses in the end.
A: Anyway, aside from the fact that
Sean Perm is hysterical, there'snot a lot to say
about...
W: Hey, don't forget Phoebe Cates and
Jennifer Jason Leigh! Fast Times was one of
their earliest movies. And watch for Forest

Whittaker's cameo.
A: True. What I was trying to say was
that there isn't a lot to say about this flick
other than that it's a lot of fun, a good brainless veg-out, and... a lot of fun.
W: Ad, sometimes I'm convinced you're
on pot.
A: Just like Mr. Hand!
Andy: Who's Mr. Hand?
W: Go see the movie, which reminds

IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
A: Calm down! But I guess it is telling
that we can't come up with anything else to
say about it. Well, I'd skip U.S. History to see
it...
W: But then you'd have to spend some
time with Mr. Hand later.
A: What's that supposed to mean?

It's alive!?
Indeed, Swatties can party
By Jeremy Weinstein
What do you get whenyou release hundreds
of wild, caged-up animals, give them some feelgood drugs, and keep them all in a smallroom with
loud music? Before I came here, I would have
looked around in puzzlement with absolutely no
answer to this question. Now, I know the answer:
Swarthmore Parties.
Everyone downgrades this campus, saying
that we are definitely not on "Playboy's Top Ten
Party Campus" list, so I arrived expecting little and
sincerely believing that I would need to create a
good time for myself. So for the first couple
months, Swarthmore social life was basically a trip
to Paces during the week (no offense, the frozen
yogurt ina wafflepizelle bowlwithraspberry sauce
is dynamite, especially ifyouaddchocolate sauce)
and maybe a jaunt over to the Okie Club on
Saturdays (where I could watch fifteen people
listen to a band). Don't even ask about Fridays:
Top TenSwat Activities on Friday nights:
10) Attempt to enter the forbidden underground corridor extending from Old Tarble to
Sharpies.
9) Listen to WSRN (Occasionally Ned is
OJC).
8) Choose your classes for senior year.
7) Writean all-campus e-mail,maybe including NewsWatcher as an attachment (not anymore!).
6) Go see your WA and maybe ask them out
to Renato's (the Swarthmore high school hangout).
5) Go to Perm.
4) Check your mail (again).
3) Go over to Willets, maybe the freshman
aren'tstudying. WRONG.
2) Host a spec.
1) Join the other 1200 students in McCabe.
Anyway, you get thepoint aboutthe first two
months of school. However, two weeks ago, in a
dorm called Mary Lyon, the Swatties began to
emerge from their shells. Whether it was the
continuedpressure of 1000-pagereading nights or
200-pagepapers, I saw thefully-released vigor and
animal instincts of the Swarthmore student body.
My faith was renewed as the party lasted past 2
AM with 1000 people dressed as hippies, 6bodiedpersons, bowling balls, you name it And it
continued with the Fall Formal, as people went
wild to the rock and roll tunes ofDJ Chris Cool, a
major stud, whohad Swarthmore grooving till the
early morning.
Now that I have seen my classmates backpack-less (the new phrase for ready to rumble), I
have completed my scientific observation and
concluded that there are three types of students.
TYPE 1: Soulus groovis consistis
This student is one owning a full disco outfit,
early 80's relic clothing, some sixties gear, and a
JamesBrown album who does not need to waitfor
a party to get hisAier act together. These people can
do themoonwalk in theirown room if they have the
right music. You have seen these people often
around campus.
TYPE 2: Normalus willdancis ifcoollis
Like most swatties, the ifcoolis will go to the
parties, listen to the music, and dance when everyone else is moving. Often seen studying, this type
recognizes the need forrelaxation on the weekend.
TYPE 3: lnsamts erectus gocrazis
These are the newly discovered, prevalent
student types. Typically observed wildlythrowing
their bodies in different directions in contorted
positions, they can be seen shirtless and attempting
to engage in inappropriate behavior on the dance
floor. Typically seen once every two months, the
gocrazis attempts torelease academic, social, and
sexual frustration in one extended evening of wild
motion (I can't call it dancing, you'd understand if
you've beenhitby thembefore). Otherindications:
sweating profusely (usually because not inphysical shape for the exertion), wild jerky head movements, and no alcohol in hand (already inbody).
Officially, thiscampus is not on anyone's top
ten for excitement, but ithasproven its worth to me.
So as I depart to strap on my platform shoes and
slide in that "sex machine"of soul, I hope thatthe
gocrazis, ifcoolis, and consistis will re-emergefor
some intense (notice use of typical Swarthmore
terminology) Saturday night study breaks before
February kills us all.

New faces out for track Old powers dominate college ball
Teams work together under new head coach
By Joanna Vondrasek
I walked into our first official
indoor trackand field team meeting
on Monday and was stunned to find
that we filled Room 20 in the Field
House completely. I was a little late
so I plopped down on the floor and
searched for a pencil to fill out the
NCAA form in which I promised
my first bom to the track gods. As I
sat and listened to CoachTedDixon
give a pep talk and explain the shoe
policy, I looked around the room,
and to my surprise, I, even as a
senior, recognized only about half
the folks. Interpretation: we've got
a heap offirst year athletes. This is
a very good thing, even though it
made me feel really old. One thing
that struck me was that there were a
lot more men than women. I'm not
sure about the numbers (where are
you O Great Record Keeper?) but

this may be one of the biggest combined teams that we've had in a
while.
This year is a noteworthy one
anyway, simply because this is the
first time that the men's and
women's teams will be combined
under one set of coaches. Although
the season is yet in its infancy, I
have a feeling that this will be a
more unified team than in years
past. One event that will hopefully
bond the team and also help in our
training is the much awaited return
of the Spring Break Trip to Florida
(aka the 18 hour Bus Ride with
detours through D.C. and Pedro).
Since there are entirely too
many people to mention, I'll just
say... Our first meet is in a few
weeks on Saturday, December 11. It
is here, in our own field house. We
run; we jump; we throw; we do it
indoors. Come watch us.

retain an extremely talentedand seasoned group of players. Seven-foot
senior center Eric Montross should
once again lead the way, with support from guard Derrick Phelps and
forward Brian Reese. Also, look for
junior sharp-shooter Donald Williams to have another banner season.
As if this weren't enough, the N.C.
recruiting class includes top prospects Rasheed Wallace and Jerry
"Outback" Stackhouse... Unbelievable!!

Suzanne Myers '97 was one of 27 women in the 1819 age group to participate in the November 14 New

try," said Myers, who ran 1000 miles between late
April and early November in preparation for the race.

NHL must reform now
New commissioner has important task ahead
By Nick Gisonda
It seems to me that theNational
Hockey League is at a crossroads in
its existence. Many people have
proclaimed that hockey will be the
next major sport in the United States,
but the popularity of the sport has
only marginally increased in thepast
few years. The league took a positive step in hiring Gary Betteman, a
former top NBA front office mastermind, as its commissioner last
year, replacing the knowledgeable
but ultimately ineffective John
Ziegler. When he was introduced as
the new chief official, Betteman
pledged himself to placing the NHL
at the forefront of American sporting events. In my opinion, he has
made slow but steady progress in
this regard. Hockey will probably
never surpass baseball, football,
andbasketball in fan appreciation in
theU.S. However, I think thatthere
are some important things that
should be done in order to make the
NHL a more viable commercial
option to the average sports fan. For
example:
1. End internal dissension. Last
year, a strike by the players almost
ruined the entireplayoffs. The team
owners have been accused repeatedly of collusion and have threatened to lock out the players from

playing numerous times as well.
Recently, the on-ice officials have
proposed striking to solve their labor dispute with management. This
must cease. The NHL must look at
the bad names baseball and football
have made in their labor relations
and leam from those mistakes.
2. Promote star players more
in the media. There are many talented hockey players out there, but
with the exceptions of Wayne
Gretzky and Mario Lemieux,
none of them havereceived wide
media coverage.
3. Promote college hockey.
There is some quality hockey beingplayedright under the glimpse
of the sports fan. Besides, look
at the success of college football
and basketball in publicizing the
professional equivalents of their

It will take a superhuman

effort to dethrone the boys from
Chapel Hill, but don't be terribly
surprised if another team is cuttin'
the nets down in April.
The Contenders
With the loss of all-world forward Jamal MashbumtotheN.B.A.,
you might think that the Kentucky
Wildcats are due for a down year.
You would be wrong. The Cats
return 5' 9" sparkplug Travis Ford
whose deadeye shooting can't be
matched by anyone, anywhere. With
the shadow of Mashburn gone, look
for potential mega-star Rodrick
Rhodes to step it up and make an
immediate impact. Kentucky will
continue to count on the steady play
of center Andre Riddick and scrappy
forward Jared Prickett. What the
Wildcats lack in height and talent
they definitely make up for in heart,
in-your-face-defense, and a floorburning style that'll make your head
spin. Let's face the facts, head coach
Rick Pitino is God. And with God
coaching the Wildcats, they are unquestionable contenders.
Imagine waking up in the morning, running for about an hour, prac-

Okie State center Bryant "Big Country" Reeves is overrated and is the
ugliest player in the Big Eight. My
condolences to last year's winner
Patrick Richey of Kansas, who still
managed to finish a close second
behindReeves. Anyway, don'tworry
about having to endure "Big Country" or Sutton in the Final Four because they won't be there.
The Fighting Illini of Illinois
play in arguably the best conference
in America, but despite the schedule
from hell they never do anything in
the Tournament. They've had some
very good players over the years and
this one is no different, but Coach
Lou Henson can't win the big ones.
The Sleepers
The most exciting aspect ofcollege basketball is picking the team
that will obtain Cinderellastatus and
surprise an unsuspecting top-ranked
team. My all-glass slipper team includes Santa Clara, Western Kentucky, and Tennessee State.
When Santa Clara's star Andy
Karich decided to quit the team this
year,Broncos headcoachDick Davey
said in tears, "wepaidhim toquit,no,
just kidding, with four seconds to go
in the first half and the other team
shooting free throws, there's no one
I 'drather have on thefloor than Andy
Karich." Now, a moment of silence
for the greatest player to ever not
play the game,but looked damngood
on the bench, Andy Karich. Despite
this tragic loss, the Broncos return
starters "Pistol" Pete Eisenrich,
DeWayne Lewis, Steve Nash, and
budding sophomore center Phil Von
BuchwaldL Dick Davey is almost as
godlike as Rick Pitino, so expect
great things from Clara.
Both Western Kentucky and
Tennessee State hope to build on
their strong finishes last year. Western came within an eyelash ofknock-

ing off Florida State in last year's
Tournament and advancing to the
Great Eight. And with last Wednesday nights strong showing against
NorthCarolina in the Preseason NIT,
they could once again mix it up with
thebigboys. TennesseeState waltzed
through the always tough Ohio Valley Conference last year for the
school'sfirst-ever trip to theNC AAs.
This year, they return all but one
starter and look to be stronger and

more athletic. Of course, they'll have
to knock off those pesky Murray
State Racers in the conference tournament in order to advance. This, as
everyone knows, willbeanextremely
difficult thing to do.

4. Stop expansion for a
while. It is always good to break
into new markets, but in general,
expansion depletes the talentpool
of quality players. There needs
to be an emphasis placed on good
skating and hard hitting rather
than on goons whose job it is
simply to fight with the oppo-

ticing for about an hour, running for
another hour, then going outside to
watch the sun come up. You probably don't live by this regimen. If
your a basketball player for the
Temple Owls, you have no choice.
Head coachJohnChaney always gets
a 100% effort out of his players, and
this year will be no different. The
disciplined Owls revolve around the
Terrific Trio consisting of guards
Rick Brunson "Burner" and Aaron
McKie, and forward Eddie Jones.
Look for Temple to finishfirst in the
much-improved Atlantic Ten Conference and make some serious noise
in the NCAA Tournament.
University of Louisville Coach
Denny Crum seems to get the most
out ofhis teams when it counts. Unfortunately for Crum, the Cardinals
have come up short thelastfew years
due to a lack of talent. This year,
however, the'Ville maybe one of the
most athletic teams in the country.
Juniorcenter/forward CliffordRozier
has unlimited potential and is thekey
to the Cardinals offense. Also, seniors Dwayne Morton and GregMinor can shoot the lights out from
three-point land. This is a team that
will start characteristically slow, yet
finish with a bang.
Amongst the other major contenders are Arkansas, Michigan,
Duke, and California. The baby Razorbacks aren't so young anymore,
and they will give anyone "fortyminutes of Hell." Despite the loss of
Chris Webber to the NBA, the hotheads from Michigan still have
enough mustard to make arun. With
a healthy Grant Hill, Duke could
once again be synonymous with the
Final Four. And Jason "Hurley's
Name" Kidd may not be the only
gem onan improved Californiateam.
The Pretenders
Leafing through Roget's Thesaurus the other day, I noticed that
Arizona is now a synonym for the
word "pretender". It reminded me of
a joke thatKevin "Mad Dog" Babitz
'94 once told me. Why did all the
bars in Arizona go out of business?
Answer: Because everyone left after
the first round. For two consecutive
years, Arizona has fattened up on
regular season cupcakes, inflated to a
high seed in the NCAA Tournament,
then bowed out in the first round.
While 'Zona's schedule is a little
tougher this year due to the resurgence ofUCLA and Cal in the PAC
10, coach Lute Olsen should once
againplan to watch a majority of the
NCAA Tournament on television.
One could go on for days about
other pretenders, but OklahomaState
and Illinois deserve singling out. The
Oklahoma State Cowboys are a team
that has really come on strong in the
last few years. But it doesn't really
matter because Eddie Sutton is still
the coach. Sutton is not only a crook,
but he has successfully ruined the
careers of some very good basketball
players, including his own son's.

Applications for the Spring 1994 Semester are still being accepted.

Swat swimmers have high expectations for its upcoming season
By Matt Cohen
Witha mighty splash and arousing "BOOM CfflCK-ABOOM," the
1993-94S warthmoreswimming season got underway. Now four weeks
into the season, thestrokeshavebeen
corrected, the hearts and lungs have
readjusted to the rigors of 2-hourplus oxygen deprivation sessions, and
the times are rapidly dropping.
The season holds a great deal of
promise. At a team meeting prior to
starting official practices, swimmers
dreamed of making nationals, making the CentennialConferenceChampionship cuts or finally swimming as
fast as they could possibly go. The
bitterreality is that one can dream all
one wants, but what pays off is hard
work and dedication. Led by senior
captains JennyDiamond, Kate Moran
and Dave Helgerson, the team set off
on its five-month quest to do just
what it dreamed it could do. The
determination shown so far has been
nothing short of extraordinary. The
pool boils with the furious abandon

of swimmers during every set
Keeping the whole team in focus are the coaches. Sue Davis returns for her 18thyear as head coach,
bringing with her the intensity that
she collected over a semester sabbatical last year, and some newly
acquired techniques (some stranger
than others) that made Pablo Morales, M att BiondiandSummer Sanders legends. Joining her is Dan (just
Dan), the new assistant coach. Together they are trying to mold a team
with potential as yet unrealized "We
hope to come in the top two or three
slots [at the conference championships]," said Helgerson.
After the loss of the Fab Five
(Swarthmore's own) to graduation,
the men's team was looking to the
freshman class to fill some very big
shoes. The women were less dramatically hit by the departure of the
class of '93, but are looking to a
strong freshman contingent to improve uponlast year's incredible success (second in conference).
Led by Dave "Reggie"

Helgerson, the men's team has the
resources to go as far as they choose
to go.The arrival of Justin Herring
'97 (he swam the entire way down
here from Alaska and was not allowed through the Suez Canal for
reasons)
heralds

Swarthmore's continued domination
ofthebutterfly. With returning sophomores Alex Huk and Kendrew Witt,
we will rule the breaststroke. Ross
Dickson '97 and Julian Lartigue '97
give the team needed depth and the
prospect ofa distance stud The most
visually confusing arrival to the men's
team is thelittle brother contingent of
Doug McCrath '97 and Jaime
"Suave" Raich '97. In following the
footsteps of their elders (they are
dead ringers for them), they have
come to make Swarthmore swimming great.
The women's team is once again
strong this year. First-years Anne
Byrd, Nina Paynter, Sarah McMillan
and HanaanHussein join theranks of
Moran, Maria Kaufman '96, Sarah
Werneck '96, and Lizzie Hallworth

'96 among others to create a formidableforce in theCentennialConference. The only negative display so
far by the freshmen has been their
definite lack of hip mobility.
Therehavebeen twodisplays of
this talent.Thefirst was the drubbing
that we gave a small team from
Rutgers-Camden. The score was irrelevant since Swarthmore dominated every event, winning all but
one (and that was a give-away). This
was a promising start with some times
forecasting great things for the future.

The second meet was against
defending champions and division
powerhouses Gettysburg. "Going in,
we were optimistic we could give
them some good races," said
Helgerson. Their speed proved far
toomuchforSwarthmore.There were
some fantastic performances, inspite
of the loss. The women's medley
relay team won in near-record time.
SkyeFulkerson '96, ice bags and all,
cruised to a personal record and nearnational time in the 100breaststroke.

Witt and Huk (a.k.a. the back brothers) cruised to fantastic early season
times in thehundredbreast, losing by
a fingernail at thefinish. Herring was
the fastest flier in the w ater, but turned
much like a manatee might, and was
beaten.
In every case, Swarthmore
swimmers can be pleased that they
are on theright trackfor a successful
season. With a training trip over
Christmas break, the team will have
the opportunity to bask in the Caribbean sun and swim their hearts out
They will then return to Swarthmore,
the taper and the Championships.
So if you feel the need to see
graceful swimmers plane over the
water in record times, go watch the
Olympics. If you want to see people
working hard to be as good as they
can be, come down and cheer at the
meet on Saturday. We swim against
Kutztown University (Div. IT) in what
should acompetitvemeet. Withfive
weeks under their belt, Swarthmore
swimmers should out up some great
times.

Week Twelve marks the final
bye week of this season; Phoenix
and Seattle are off this week. As
always, home teams are listed first.
Eagles vs. Giants: Ah, yes.
TheEagles didn't signBernieKosar,
much to their chagrin. Now look
where they are. They're duking it
out with the Redskins for squatter's
rights in the NFC East. This week,
they entertain New York. Will the
Eagles end their five-game losing
streak?Uhh...no. Winner: GIANTS.
Broncos vs. Steelers: Face it,
the Steelers got lucky last week.
Yeah, they drubbed Buffalo, but the
Steelers have one of the league's
most inconsistent offenses. RB
Barry Foster has punch and ran well
last week. However, at Mile High
Stadium this week, it's going to be
a different story. The Broncos,
smarting after a three-point loss to
Minnesota, have something to prove
to their critics. QB John Elway,
rookie RB Glyn Milbum and TE

Shannon Sharpe(Sterling'sbrother)
will lead the charge as the Broncs
win by a touchdown. Winner:
BRONCOS.
Packers vs. Lions: The Lions
are owners ofa 7-2 record, their best
record in years. RB Barry Sanders
has placed the Lions into heavy contentionfor a playoff spot. The Packers, led by QB Brett Favre and WR
Sterling Sharpe, upset NewOrleans
and strengthened their own playoff
chances.TheLions have faced light
competition to date (Atlanta, New
England, Tampa Bay twice, Minnesota, Phoenix) so the Packers will
be a real test. The Packers have
more versatility and they have
proven that they can win the big
games. Add to the mix the homefield advantage and I think the Packers will gain the victory. Winner:
PACKERS.
49'ers vs. SaintsCMon.'): The
Saints were upset last week at the
Superdome by a Chris Jacke field
goal. Since the49'ers won last week
against Tampa (Jerry Rice 4 TD 's),
-

theNFC West race is tightening up.
This is going to be a great game.
