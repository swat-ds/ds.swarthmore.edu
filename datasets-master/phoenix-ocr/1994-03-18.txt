expressed their concerns that student opinion, which was solicited
by the department and the administration, was not taken into account
in making that decision. They also
implied that there were improper
procedures involved in the process.
Juhasz attended Amherst College as an undergraduate and then
went on to earn her Ph.D. in cinema
studies in 1990 from New York

University. She did her dissertation
on alternative, non-traditionalAIDS
videos, including her own material.

This proposal has since been modified by SC, whichintends to have a

Seitz is pleased that the strike

agreed, adding, "It's not my favorite arrangement but it's a solution
that lets us get The Phoenix back
into publication." The editors 'original proposal to SC requested $3OOO
to compensate the editor in chief
and eight section editors, with some
funds to be put toward paying writers and other staff. The proposal
was rejected by the council.
"The bottom line is that student opinion was generally against
monetary compensation but I think
that everyone was open to investigating other ways to compensating
the editors," said Andy Feldman
'96, current Charter Chair. He called
the resolution a division of labor,
saying that "the Student Council
deals with school policy and the
administration the best, so we're
going to investigate academic credit.
The editors put out a paper best, so
they'll do that."
This will be the only issue of
The Phoenix produced under the
leadership of Perrin and Seitz. A
new election will be held this Sunday, March 20, to determine the
who will take over the newspaper
for the rest of the semester.
Currently, Student Council is
looking at alternative ways of con-

ducting a course similar to chorus,
which is in effect a performance
class that offers its participants a
half-credit, and the writing associates program, which requires WAs
to take a one-credit course. SC hopes
that examining programs like this
will help them to design an alternative credit course with The Phoenix
as its focus. They plan to have a
definedproposal available by April
which they will present to the administration. "Developments in the
pursuit should come soon," says
Dallas Brennan '94, a StudentCouncil member. According to her, SC
has already approached the deans,
the provost, and the registrar with
their concerns and questions.
Feldman said, "When we have done
our investigation and made a proposal, then it will be up to the students and the administration to decide if this is what they want."
Brennan expressed optimism
at the resolution of the strike, and
although she found the process of
negotiation interesting, said that it
was difficult to keep students informed about developments in the
discussions between SC and The
Phoenix while thestrike was going
on. Whatever happens with the new
proposal, she says "there should be
more communication between the
studentcouncil and thestudentbody
on what exactly we're doing. There
wasn't a consensus when we had
our open Thursday night meeting
[the collection in January to get student opinion on the strike]."
Opinions still differ about the
resolution of the strike, but, as
Brennan says, "People were excited
that we were actually getting the
paper back."

were also involved because ofsome
candidates' particular interests.
The students interviewed the
candidates and read their resumes,
then submitted their recommendations to the department. The student
groups and the English majors recommended Juhasz as their top pick.
In addition, other students sent over
50 letters ofsupport for Juhasz. The
student outcry came about when,
despite the prodigious student support for Juhasz, the English Department offered the job to Patricia
White. White received her Ph.D.
from the University ofCalifornia at
Santa Cruz and is currently Resident Fellow at the Humanities Institute at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
Juhasz said of the decision, "I
felt hurt, betrayed, confused and
surprisedby thedecision, but I don*t
thinkthat it is appropriate for me to
discuss it in an open forum, with
students."
Williamson explained that "It
seemedclear that Alex was going to
be in a very strong position in this
search. But I toldher that because it
was a national search, it was unpredictable. No promises were made.
There are other elements in these
searches, such as the opinion of
other members of the
department, other faculty, the letters of recommendation for the
candidates, their writing samples, and their
lectures. Alex's support
was strongest among the
students, but everywhereelseit was mixed.
Finally, a decision was
madeinfavorofPatricia
White. On the basis of
concentrators and

all these pieces of information, we
had tomake a decision on who would
be best for Swarthmore."
"We had to choose who would
be better for the department in the
long-term," said Anderson.
The student groups were angry
because they felt that their input
was not adequately considered.Kari
Hong '94, an intern for the LBGA,
said, "The English Department approached LBGA and asked us if we
would take part in thesearch. It was
very well intentioned. LBGA overwhelmingly supported Alex, and our
opinion was ignored. We were confused as to why they had even asked
for student input."
There was also concern that
Juhasz had been improperly forced
to declare her bisexuality and that
her non-traditional work was a consideration in the department's decision not to rehire her. This concern
came about because of an alleged
debate within thesearch committee
as to whether a heterosexual should
be eligible for a Gay and Lesbian
Studies position. During the course
of the search, Juhasz declared her
bisexuality.
Inresponse to these allegations,
Williamson said "We had candidates coming in who ranged across
fields. Primarily, in this particular
appointment, the arguments were
madewith regard to the candidates'
capabilities to do film. Alex asked
to be considered also as a candidate
for the secondary field of Gay and
Lesbian literature.We agreed to this.
The student charge that we forced
Alex into a declaration about her
own sexual politics we reject absolutely."
Anderson added that, although
thefocus ofPatricia White's studies
is oriented more towardsmainstream
film than Juhasz, White is still involved in"leftist activism, and very

interested in lesbian issues infilm."
In an attempt to make the administrationexamine its hiring procedure and search process, Hong,
Jeremy Weinstein '97, and Seth
Brenzel '94 went to a meeting of the
Board of Managers and presented
them with a letter requesting an investigation into theprocedures taken
by the department,and thattheBoard
directPresident Bloom and the Provost to develop a definite policy as
to how they includestudent opinion
in decision-making processes.
Weinsteinsaid, "When we went
to the Board of Managers, we did
not go for Alex. Students were entirely in support of Alex and the
department went in another direction. We want a definite policy of
how the college will take student
opinion into account. It's about how
the college values its students, and
about how it empowers them."
In response to the students' requests, Marsha Brown, Administrative Assistant to the Provost, said
that Neil Austrian, Chair of the
Board of Managers, "did not feel
that it was appropriate for theBoard
to intervene" and that they "had
complete faith in the President and
Provost in carrying out the hiring

process."

"Whenever there are searches,
you learn something," says
Williamson. "We will try to make
use of what we learned in future
searches. Oneof thehard things was
how to balance a candidate who's
been here for three years against
someone who comes in for an interview for one day."
There will be a meeting today
(Friday, March 18) at 4:oopm in the
Whittier room in the Meeting House
in which Williamson and Provost
Jennie Keith will answer any student questions and concerns about
the matter.

The student-run Unix computer, Raptor, has gained an impressive base of users,
especially in the youngerclasses. Raptor was
installed last summer as part of a compromise between the Computing Center and
students concerned about the planned demise
ofUnix computing at Swarthmore.
Unix is a complicated and powerful operating system particularly useful for large
computations as well as communications.
Most Swarthmore users never see the
Unix computers they use, since software on
their Macintosh makes the utilities much
simpler. Some students, faculty, and staff
consider Unix easier or more useful than its
Macintosh faces.

"I use it for email, newsreading, talk,
and learning about UNIX," said Raptor user
Matt Reed '96. "...there are five usual uses
for raptor: email, news, talk, programming/
learning UNIX, and playing games."
As the graph below shows, nearly a
third of the student body has, at one time or
another, used Raptor. Furthermore, the trend
seems to be growing, since more students in
younger classes are using the machine. One
administratorof the system saidit frequently
came close to its login limit: the number of
people that can be using it at one time.
In addition to basic services like e-mail
and newsgroups, Raptor provides an online

The College Judiciary Committeemet on Friday, January 21, and found a S warthmore
student guilty of plagiarism in a final paper handed in for a course taken last semester.
After the case was appealed, the College Judiciary Committee and the President have
recommended that the student fail the course and receive a one-semester, non-notational
suspension, beginning immediately.

In cases heard on Thursday, January 20, and Monday, January 24, 1994, the College
Judiciary Committee has found four students guilty of cheating on written homework for
a course.
Because of the circumstances surrounding the case, we have recommended that all
four students be placed on academic probation beginning immediately. For three of the
cases we have also recommended that if ever there is another conviction of academic
dishonesty the College Judiciary Committee consider no less a punishment than a
notational suspension. For what we determined to be the most severe case of cheating, we
have recommended that if the student is ever again convicted of academic dishonesty the
College Judiciary Committee consider no less a punishment than immediate expulsion
from Swarthmore College.

OPiniOf!

Media coverage fails
in Whitewater scandal
by Chuck Stevens

As the various mind-numbing details of
the Whitewater affair unfold, or rather fail to
unfold in any comprehensible fashion, we
would dowell to remember an insight by that
noted political analyst Elmer Fudd, specifically: "There's something vewy stwange
about this."There are certainly many stwange
things about Whitewater, but the stwangest
ofall is thepuzzling gap between administrationofficials whoinsist that nothing' s wrong,
everyone should go back to bed, and Republicans who seem convinced that the whole
affair has earth-shaking consequences. The
implications are disturbing: are investigations of questionable activity now entirely a
partisan affair, and are we expected to believe either that Whitewater concerns nothing worthy of notice, or that it will bring
about the imminentdownfall oftherepublic?
The partisan position-taking isn't exactly difficult to explain, however, given the
nature of the media attention.The reaction to
the story has been, somewhatpredictably, an
outbreak of reporters dashing energetically
across thecontinent looking for the solution
to the case, which seems to give the affair
more weight than it originally warranted.
The whole mess has cast some light on the
role of the media in today's world: the
Watergate-era style of investigative journalism seems to have spawned a new judicial
branch in itself, carrying grim implications
for the future of our political workings.
Among the more striking features of
Whitewater is that the general public apparently doesn't care
much about it;
'^^^^^^^^^^M

that professed itselfunable to take
a position either
way. To extrapolate that the public attaches no
great weight to
ethics charges, or
that the public has
mulled the case
and decided that
the Clintons are
excusable,
would—at best—be distorting the
issue; far more
likely is that
people simply do
not understand
the nature of the
case. And the media must bear some of the
blame on this count; certainly, this is a complicated issue, certainly, the willingness of
the average voter to puzzle through
labyrinthian issues is notoriously suspect,
but the media has a duty to report the issue
and what it means clearly. Clarity has not
been a featureof themediacoverage thusfar.
For, when issues are left wildly unclear,
the general public is left unclear on whom
exactly to believe, and questionable statements on the topic, like those currently being
exchanged, can pass unquestioned. To wit:
Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of
"getting this off the country's radar screen"
and claimed that the affair was "not a scandal." Obviously, no one wants the investigation to drag on any longer than necessary, but
wanting simply to get it out of the public eye
sounds duplicitous. There are important issues at stake, and breezing through them in
the name of expediency sounds uncomfortably like the casual attitude toward ethics
that may or may not have led to questionable
behavior in the first place. Insisting that the
affair is simply a failed land transaction is
also disingenuous. Some strange things have
obviously happened, the White House has
beenless than forthcoming about explaining
them, and theethicalconsiderations involved
all along theline might well classify obstructive behavior as scandalous. Mrs. Clinton's
statement, "Mistakes were made," both echoes Ronald Reagan and epitomizes the
it's-not-my-fault tone that has characterized
administration statements, which points in

itself to something more than a failed lane
transaction.
At the same time, however, the Repub
lican response to the affair has been exces
sive. Allegations by Senator Alfonse
D'Amato and others that the seriousness o
the affair equals or exceeds that of Watergate
are simply overblown, in part because no
allegations havebeen proven—the case rests
entirely on circumstantial evidence and sup
position—and because even the worst-case
scenario points only to ethically question
able activities but nocriminal offenses. There
is nothing here even remotely on the scale o
a burglary of theDemocratic National Com
mittee headquarters, guys. So sorry. Anc
screaming "Cover-up!" at every moment's
delay in furnishing this document or that, or
in White House aides contacting Treasury
Department officials, is simplypartisan bick

Most disturbing (and most offensive) of the
groundless allegations are suppositions tha

the most important coverage goes to exactly what has

whether it has any bearing on truth. Rather
than taking on a "mirror" role, the media
chooses to be a "lamp", to illuminate each
and every dark corner of the world in the
name of the public's right to know.
The power of the investigative media
tendenciesto slant public perceptions is considerable: journalists loudly trumpeting their
quests forThe TruthOf The Matter leave the
impression, without benefit ofany hard evidence, that the players in question are inevitably guilty and will certainly be indicted just
as soon as that key missing link is found.The
mass media becomes a judicial branch unto

rules.
The roots of the media's quasi-judicial
role are complex, but the importance of the
Watergate scandal in shaping the perception
of the media, especially vis-d-vis our political system, is undeniable.The glory in journalism, it might not be too farfetched to
speculate, has come to hinge more on being
the next Woodward and Bernstein, than in
simply reporting the news accurately or being thefirst on the scene. And now, given the
fervor with which reporters pursue stories of
possible wrongdoing,relatively insignificant
stories, such as, say, Whitewater, instantly
become crippling allegations. The essence
of Whitewater, if (a big if) the supposition is
true, is that Hillary Clinton arranged—temporarily —to keep a savings and loan afloat

Rising from the ashes...
When we started on this endeavor, we didrCt quite know whatlo expect. The Phoenix
was faced with diminishing staff resources, consistently low morale, and the general
perception on the part ofthe College community that thepaper failed to meet its standards
for quality; it was clear that something had to be done. Unfortunately previous attempts at
rectifying the situation had only tinkered around the edges, avoiding the real problems.
From previous experience on the staff, we hadfound that the real problem facing the staff
was the lack of the time required to do the job to the best of its ability.
Previous editorial administrations had repeatedly approached Student Council with
various proposals to fund the staff, but were literally laughed out of the meetings. It was in
this context that the staff decided to begin the strike, electing us to lead it.
We originally presented a plan for the editorial staffand writers to be paid salaries.
This would have freed staff members from the obligations of work-study. 100% of The
Phoenix staff has a campus job in addition to theirclass loads in addition to their Phoenix
responsibilities. This is not a play for pity; it is simply afact oflifefor those who chose to
work on the newspaper at Swarthmore,
We thought financial compensation was a belter and more easily implemented
solution;few students are in need of extra credits, and the supervision implied by academic
credit could threaten the journalistic integrity of the paper. Nevertheless, it became clear
that neither the administration nor the Student Council was wilting to finance a monetary
solution, so we decided to work with Student Council to create a plan for academic credit.
This solution will improve thepaper in the long run. Unfortunately itstilldoes not strike
at the heart of the problemsfacing The Phoenix; the lack ofstaff time to do the jobright.
At an all-campus collection called by Student Council to discuss the issue, many
students attended and voiced various opinions. Several students implied that they wouldbe
willing and able lo run the paper themselves in order to make the strike irrelevant. Imagine
our surprise, therefore, when we discovered thai no one was interested in editing The
Phoenix foreven the fewissuesremaining this semester!
This is, actually,achronicproblemfacing The Phoenix,
always short; and in
several recent semesters, thepapernearly diedfor lackojcandidatesfor editor-in-chief. The
question that needs to be answered is whether or not the compromise with Student Council
will address—and solve this critical problem.
Swarlhmore deserves a top-notch campus newspaper. Because it has been poorly
funded and lacked other crucial resources, the talented journalists who worked on The
Phoenix were unable lo make it the truly exceptionalpaper it could have been. We hope that
the compromise solution will be implemented so as to solve some, if not all, of these
problem.
In the meantime, The Phoenix will attempt to publish as usual. As we agreed at the
beginning, however, this will be our last issue as editors-in-chief We know that there are
capable students out there who could do an excellent job We cltallenge and urge these
people to come forward. As we said, there are only a few weeks left, and there are many
people willing to help anyone who chooses to lead the paper. If you are interested in any
position, come see us on Sunday, al Bpm in Parlours. If you can't make it, give us a call—we'dloveto hear fromyou.

Michael Rogin to close Swat Cooper Lecture Series
Berkeley political scientist combines public policy, political culture
by Andy Perrin
Political scientist Michael Rogin, of the
University of California at Berkeley, will
close out the year-long lecture series, "The
Politics of Possibility: Forging Democracy in
America" on March 31 with a lecture entitled
"Democracy in Burnt Cork: The End of
Blackface, the Beginning of Civil Rights."
The series, sponsored by the Cooper
Foundation and the Department of Political
Science, began in September with a lecture
by economist Bob Kuttner.
Rogin is known for analyses that span
different academic disciplines: political science, sociology, literary theory, political
theory, and psychology.
According to political science professor
Meta Mendel-Reyes, Rogin's work centers
around what he calls "political demonology:"
the tendency of Americans to "define ourselves in relation to an other."
"That's a really important and hot topic
thatpeople will be interestedin," saidMendelReyes.
Mendel-Reyes characterized Rogin's
general approach by saying he looks at phenomena generally considered to be at the
margins of American political culture and

An installation of "Picturing Asian
America," a photographic exhibit of Asian
American life, will be displayed at the
Swarthmore College Bookstore from Thursday, March 17 through Thursday, March 31.
Bookstore hours are Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-5
p.m. and Saturday 11 a.m.-3 p.m. The exhibit
is free and open to the public.
"Picturing Asian America" was first developed at the Headlands Center for the Arts
in Californiain the spring of 1993.Theproject
involved over 150 Asian Americans in the
San Francisco Bay Area and resulted in an
exhibition/installation featuring almost 200
photographic images describing the Bay Area
Asian American community. In seeking to
refute external stereotypes ofAsians in American society, the project asked Asian Americans to describe their culture candidly and
through their own eyes.
Recognizing the diversity and regional
distinctivenessofAsian American communities, the project has been expanded to include
other cities and areas. The exhibition at
Swarthmore is the result of artist Mei-ling
Horn's distribution of single use 35mm cameras to Philadelphia area Asian Americans to
record on film the images describing their
contemporary cultureand environment. These
photographs will be displayed against the
backdrop of photographs taken by the Bay
Area Asian Americans. Together the pictures
from East and West Coasts willrecognize and
celebrate this cultural blend of American society as seen by Asian Americans.

Profs to Compare Clinton,

Eleanor Roosevelt and
Hillary Rodham Clinton on March 21 at

Murphy will give a political and historical layout of the two first ladies and make
comparisons or parallels in the lives of these
two women, both of whom have played a
significant role in politics. Nackenoff will
then step in as an analyst and respond to the
comparisons made about Mrs. Clinton and
Mrs. Roosevelt.

Swarming Earthworms have Ultimate good time

drive, and played a club team that called

University, and a team from Louisiana

games, unfortunately, as was expected;
outmatched in size, speed, and experience, the Earthworms nonethelessplayed

The Swarming Earthworms have returned! The ultimate frisbee tournament
season has begun, after a long winter of
practice: its first official action of 1994
came during the spring break in the
Frostbreaker Tournament in Gainesville,
Florida. Though the competition at the
first tournament proved a bit much for the
inexperienced team, local action looks to
be more favorable to the Worms' hopes.
The team first hit the fields (make

before wearing down in the second half.
Highlights included Dave Lewis' layout

numerous spectacular efforts, and a score
by Ben Rutter against Georgia on a daring
end-zone cut.
Four Swarthmore women (Courtney
Harter, Kate Walker, Patrice McGuire,
and Gena Merliss) made the trip down
with the team, and the team was intending
to play coed. When the UPenn women's
team, Venus, asked the Swat women to
play with them, however, the four accepted, and played on the Penn team
throughout the weekend, posting a 1-4
record. The players enjoyed the chance to
play with some experienced teammates;

Before returning to the colder climes,
the team played some split-squad games
with the Florida State team while visiting
Tallahassee, and did relatively well. One
of the Swarthmore teams won its game (96, in a game that lasted for more than 90
minutes, somehow), and the other lost.
Memorable moments included a Momeni
catch over a Florida State player known to
the Swat team only as Big Dave, as well as
Mike (Benedict Arnold) Morton's sudden defection to the other side.
Coming up for the Earthworms are
numerous local tournaments, including a
tournament here at Swarthmore tomorrow, with teams including UPenn, Lehigh,

The second day of the tournament
brought two more losses, sadly, against
Augusta and University of Pennsylvania,
but the team was not discouraged. The
UPenn game saw Rutter encounter the
elbow of an opponent and suffer a broken
tooth (eliciting a "Bite the disc!" cheer
from his teammates), unfortunately necessitating a root canal the next day.
Standout players were Momeni, as always (more layout scores for Prince Ali),
as well as Robin Mandel, one of the team's
best handlers, and Japhet Koteen. The

refined by captains Matt Robison and
"Free" Willie Young) to surprise the local
teams.

The Worms are mostly first-year—key frosh players include Momeni, Rutter,
Mandel, Sacker, Lewis, Morton, and Mike
Brogan—and have a lot of learning time
ahead.
The fledgling women's team (which
is still searching for a name; War Mothers
has been nixed, it seems) is practicing on
its own, and will play in the upcoming
tournaments separately from the men, so
the team is now officially divided.
Gym credit or not (not, thus far, and
for the foreseeable future), the ultimate
team is hoping to rebound from its losses
down South and improve its play as the
spring progresses.

Gambling season is upon us. The onslaught oftheNCAA basketball tournament
has littered pool sheets all over campus.
Sportsfans whohave meticulously filled out
the tournament brackets can finally turn off
their brains and giddily focus all of their
attention on the TV. Yet while all sports
gamblers seek the perfect combination of
victories leading their teams to the Final
Four, the experienced ones know that the
next several weeks will inevitably bring
much more despair than elation.
For those who have no interest in basketball, people's infatuation with the tournament seems ridiculous, if not downright
annoying. Suddenly neglected soul mates of
tournament junkies are not pleased that their
date has been preempted by Temple versus
Drexel and Louisville versus Boise State.
From noon on Thursday until Sunday
evening, sports fans will completely
marginalize their schoolwork and any important relationships in a perpetual quest for
the gambling high. If their teams lose, their
hearts will drop to their shoes, and they'll
watch the next game with even more intensity. Those whose hopes are crushed this
weekend will wake up Monday morning
with a serious gambling hangover: no sleep,
a couple latepapers, and perhaps a relation-

ship to mend. Those who survive this weekend with their brackets still in tact have the
pleasure of running through the television
gauntlet again next weekend. Their hangover
men will ultimately be much more intense.
Inevitably, some random clod whoknows
nothing about sports and pays no attention to
the tournament will win the pool. Those who
spent all of their waking hours making the
picks and watching the games will tear their
hair out, scream bloody murder, and anxiously await next year's tournament when
they will finally win.
To all addicted sports fans, I offer some
wordsof advice. In almostall pools, the later
rounds are more important. So unless you
have Wisconsin Green Bay or Western Kentucky winning it all, it might not be a great
idea to neglect your paperand yourloved one
to make like Mr. Potato Head in front of the
TV. Ifyour teams avoid losing this weekend,
you will be able to watch them later, when it
really matters. Next, the sooner you lose
hope, the better off you will be. If you're
trying to figure out if you are mathematically
eliminated by the end of the second round,
give it up. Finally, don'tbreak up or fail out
because of the tournament. There's always
next year. Besides, the serious sports gambler
who loses money on the NCAA knows that
Rotisserie League baseball is just around the
corner.
