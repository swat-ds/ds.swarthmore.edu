Swarthmore Inn progresses to next phase
The Board of Managers will review a proposal submitted by the Goldenberg Group this weekend
BY JACK KEEFE

jkeefel@swarthmore.edu

This weekend, Vice President of
Facilities Stu Hain will present to the
Board of Managers the most recent results
of the committee that has been meeting to
discuss the prospects of constructing a
"Swarthmore Inn" complex near the softball field. The committee will recommend
pursuing the plans of one developer
the
Goldenberg Group
as the project moves
forward. The project, if eventually
approved for construction, is estimated to
cost at least $4O million and to be completed in 2011 or 2012.
The plans of the two developers who
presented proposals to the committee centered on developing not just hotel rooms
(the "inn" itself), but also retail space, residential complexes, a restaurant with a
liquor license and extended parking. In
addition, all plans made use of the roughly
three-acre plot in between the train station
and the Palmer, Pittenger and Roberts dormitories, intersecting with both the softball field and the C Lot parking area.
"[The Goldenberg Group] demonstrated
by the way they presented to us, by the people they've involved in their plan so far
that they've paid much more careful attention to what the town and the college are
looking for. They've had a very strong
environmentally sustainable component to
the plan," Hain said.
In Hain's opinion, the Goldenberg
planned focused more on the hotel and
retail component of the plan (as opposed to
the other plan, which had a primary focus
on the residential component). This positively influenced the committee's opinion
of the Goldenberg plan.

McAuliffe brings with her an impressive academic reputation and a mandate for change.
Arlene Joy Gibson, a Bryn Mawr College

Crum Woods committee discusses elimination of deer
BY MATT BLEI MAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

ordinance to allow shooting on College property, specifithe Cram Woods. The college would then be
required to apply for a deer removal permit from the
Pennsylvania Game Commission.
Associate Professor of Biology Jose-Luis Machado, the
Chair of the Crum Woods Stewardship Committee,
believes the forum was a necessary step to make sure student opinions were heard and questions answered. "We
are at a point at which we want an open discussion with
students," he said. "We are in an educational institution so
our jobs are to educate ourselves and the students."
The committee wants to make sure that students understand why this particular recommendation was put forth
after three years of investigation and research. Machado
said that the report demonstrates the college's commitment to transparency on the issue and a concerted effort
cally in

The Crum Woods Stewardship Committee held a public
forum last night to discuss their recommended solution for
addressing the overabundance of deer in the Crum Woods.
Members of the committee and Bryon Shissler, a consultant from Natural Resource Consultants, Inc., were present
at the forum to explain their proposal and address questions and concerns of community members.
According to the college's Web site, the Crum Woods
Stewardship Committee was established seven years ago
"to create a protection, restoration and stewardship plan
for the woods." Since then, the committee has arrived at
the conclusion that an overpopulation of deer is jeopardizing the ecological well-being of the Crum Woods.

"The ultimate goal is to find a
balance between the deer
population and a safe forest. What
we do today will have implications
in the next hundred years."
Jose-Luis Machado
Associate professor of biology
After much research, the committee issued a report in
2007 with the help of Shissler that weighed potential solutions to the population problem. After ruling out all but
one, the report concluded that the most efficient and likely way to reduce the deer population would be to use specialized sharpshooters to lure and snipe deer. The meat
would then be donated to charitable groups as food for
those in need.
The Stewardship Committee supports the decision to go
ahead with the sharpshooter deer cull. The committee's
Web site states that the college will need to commence a
lengthy bureaucratic procedure before proceeding with
the initiative, which will include asking the Swarthmore
Borough and Nether Providence Township to amend an

by the committee to disseminate relevant information to
the public.
Machado hopes that the forum clarified the need for
sharpshooters. The committee believes that this method of
deer culling is the best option at this time, although committee members are open to change as research continues.
For now, the goal of the committee is to keep the forest safe.
"The ultimate goal is to find a balance between the deer population and a safe forest," said Machado. "What we do today
will have implications in the next hundred years."
Machado explained that no one sees a problem now
because the trees are visible. In several decades, the deer
population, if left alone, will cause the forest to completely
stop regenerating. When the current trees are gone, none
will come back. "We can make a difference for the future,"
Machado said. "What people see today is the result of someone planting the forest in the 19305. We are trying to prevent
a reversion to 70 years ago."
At the forum, committee member Zachary Eichenwald
10 introduced the issue at hand and gave a brief overview,
saying that an overhead infrared scan found that there are
an average of 29 deer per square mile in the Crum, well

above a normal number.
He then introduced consultant Shissler, who explained
the conclusions of his report and the recommendation to use
sharpshooters. "Sharpshooting is the only appropriate
option in our situation," he said. Shissler defended his conclusion by discussing all of the available options and their
effectiveness. He discredited recreational hunting as being

ineffective because hunters are not allowed to hunt within
150 yards of residential areas and because deer are good at
adapting and hiding when being hunted. He also argued that
capture and euthanasia would be ineffective because the
woods are used by many people and it would be dangerous
to have traps all over the woods.

"You can get up to 90 percent [deer
population reduction] in the first year,
but you just can't get rid of them all."
Bryon Shissler
National Resources Consultants, Inc.
While he did not initially bring up non-lethal methods of
reduction, the subject was brought up in the form of a question. "You really can't use mitigation techniques at a landscape ecosystem level," Shissler said. He explained that
fences and barrier methods work on a garden but are not
effective at protecting a tract ofland as large as the Crum. He
added that all current contraceptives for deer are at an
experimental stage of development and are not considered
ready for use at this time.
Shissler believes that snapshooting is a very effective
way of reducing the deer population. "You can get up to 90
percent reduction in the first year but you just can't get rid
of them all," Shissler said. He said that the most effective
course of action is a long-term plan where sharpshooters
come over winter break every year. With careful monitoring
of deer impact in the woods, they will be able to reduce the
number of sharpshooting nights in future years.
When asked if it was possible to exterminate the deer
population, Shissler said, "If you do, you'll be the first." If all
goes according to plan, eventually the deer population will
find an equilibrium with forest growth and the forest will be
able to regenerate.
The Crum Woods Stewardship Committee is very interested in hearing feedback about the proposed plan of action.

Rugby denied National Guard grant, is recompensated
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu

After

the
administrators asked
women's rugby team to decline a $5,000
grant from the National Guard, the college
decided to provide funding to the team for

purchase
of new equipment.
Ideological reasons such as the Quaker
heritage of the college and the questionable
implications of advertising war-affiliated

the

institutions like the National Guard were
cited as the basis for the administration's

decision.

According to team co-captain Maria

Mello 'OB, the team had received an e-mail
from USA Rugby sometime last semester
informing them that the National Guard
was interested in sponsoring teams in the
Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union
(EPRU).
"There was this application and we just
ended up applying on a whim," Mello said.
"The application was to get a bunch of
equipment
jerseys, shorts, socks, balls,
ball bags, kicking tees, posts and other rel-

evant equipment."
Co-captain Karen Minyety 'OB said that
the team saw the grant primarily as a way
to minimize the equipment costs for each
team member. "We didn't think we would
have any conflict because we were getting
free stuff because that would help alleviate
the costs for the individual players,"
Minyety said. "[Players] wouldn't have to
buy things the school didn't pay for and the
budget would be

a little bit more flexible."

According to Minyety, the money allocated to Women's Rugby through the

Student Budget Committee is not sufficient
in covering all of their expenses since the
majority of that funding goes towards paying for transportation.
Therefore, players need to cover the
additional expenses out of pocket, which
include $BO cleats, $5O scrum caps and
short socks that range in cost from $25 to
$3O.
"The way our budget was structured
before... we could only give [each individual player] up to $2O dollars which is negligible if you look at everything else they
have to buy," Minyety said.

"Apparently, [the women's rugby team]
had been in conversation with the
National Guard before because they had
needs for uniform and equipment that will
make their play more safe and so on," Vice-

President Maurice

Eldridge '6l said. "What

the National Guard expected in return
was that the uniforms and equipment
would advertise the National Guard."

Once USA Rugby informed the team
that they had been selected to receive the
grant, the team learned that the grant

would require their jerseys and equipment
to be labeled with the words "Go Guard!"
as obligated by a year-long contract with

the National Guard.
"There was some controversy on our
team about whether we should get it or not
for about three weeks," Mello said.
"[Team members] would be opposed to
wear a jersey saying 'Go Guard!' on it."
Team members also learned of a possible violation of National Collegiate
...

Athletic Association (NCAA) guidelines
when students from varsity sports teams
wished to continue playing after being
sponsored by the National Guard.
"Varsity sport players at Swat wouldn't
be able to play rugby and then go back to
playing their sport because they were
sponsored by the National Guard," Mello
said. "We had decided for the most part
that we didn't want to do that because we
didn't want to bar other [varsity players
from playing rugby in their off-season."
Regardless of these disadvantages of the
grant, the President's Office asked the
team to decline the National Guard funding in keeping with the college's Quaker
heritage and values.
...

The team learned of this decision soon
after they discussed the grant with the
Athletics Department.

According to Mello, the team understood
that this type of decision was within the
authority of the President's Office, but were
still discouraged.

expected in return [for the

uniforms and equipment
would advertise the Guard."

"They're trying to preserve the culture

of the college, so I understand why they
denied us this, but at the same time it was
unfair because it was a lot of stuff that
would have been cool."

Mindful of the team's need for more
funds to finance activities and equipment,
the President's Office offered another

option to accepting the National Guard
grant.
"We suggested

that the President's
Office fund their equipment
instead of
getting external funding for their needs,"
Eldridge said.
Ultimately, Rugby team members were
pleased by the administration's decision to
fund the team the same amount as they
would have received from the grant.

2020 campaign strives to incorporate student visions
Student Council hosts an informational forum to gather feedback on the long-term planning process
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu
Last Wednesday, Student Council and
student committee representatives held an
open information session to provide stu-

dents with the opportunity to learn more
about the 2020 campaign planning process
and to advocate and submit their ideas concerning the college's budgetary and structural direction 10 years from now.
According to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l, the current planning process
of the 2020 campaign is one that "helps to
identify that which you believe you must
have [in order] to sustain the new directions that you want to go in and how much
it's going to cost, to dream about the future,
to guess at the pressures and so on that will
be out there. [We want] to make sure that
we can keep doing well the things that we
already do well and find the money that
allows us to go there."
The 2020 planning information session
event was structured around two objectives
one being to inform students about
the current process of the 2020 campaign
and the importance of students becoming
involved, and the other being the compilation of student feedback for inclusion in a
report that will eventually be given to the
various committee chairs and the Board of
Managers, according to

Student Council

President Peter Gardner 'OB.
"I think it's crucial for people to realize
[that] it's very open. The advantage of it
being very open is that no idea is too outlandish," Gardner said. "People should be

thinking about their vision for what the
[college] community in the next 15 to 20
years should be."
During the event, Gardner introduced
the 2020 campaign and described the roles
that the steering committee, on which he
and Student Council Vice President Sven
Udekwu 'O9 currently serve, and the subcommittees will play in the planning
process.
"The steering committee is basically a
cross section of every constituency of the
alumni, members of the board,
college
staff, senior staff, faculty and students,"
Gardner said.
The steering committee will evaluate a
report compiled by the sub-committees
that will include the student input
obtained from the information session, emails and other channels of communication, including the Student Council comment box used during their Sharpies

tabling.
Additionally, they will head the planning process of the 2020 campaign, evaluating and prioritizing the student, faculty
and staff input that has been collected, and
begin the process of budgeting and

"The advantage of [the
planning process] being
very open is that no idea is
too outlandish."
Peter Gardner 'OB
Student Council President
"The facilities and resources ideas will
have to really categorize the needs in terms
of dollars and or physical spaces that these
priorities suggest or imply so that you can
get a sense of what the dollars are and figure out how much of those dollars you can
really raise," Eldridge said.
After having gathered the student
input that was collected, each individual
planning group will draft a report detailing the progress and prioritization of

ideas for the campaign. These reports
will be compiled into the one report being
presented to the steering committee.
The report that will be presented to
the steering committee is expected to
take shape by next fall. Student Council
and others involved in the 2020 planning
process stressed that some short-term
proposals could potentially be implemented before 2020.
"There are certain ideas that were put

out there that are common sense things
that can be done over the next three to
four years
that Student Council could
...

be working on," Udekwu said. "[Other
ideas are] things that can be talked about
over the next 10 years."
Additionally, the planning committees have the role of preparing materials

Gardner said. "The planning groups

would play a doublerole preparing the
materials for the evaluation and
now
that that process is done, to prepare for
the future of the college
and that's

A major component of the information session was when students were
allowed to write down their ideas that
pertained to each of the subcommittees,
hand them in, and in addition talk to the
student representatives to discuss their
ideas in detail or to learn more about the
way the committees work.

Gardner also introduced the student
representatives from the subcommittees
assigned to handle specific planning
aspects of the campaign. The subcommittees include Academic Program, Broader

said.

Gallagher said she attended the session
with a friend and, despite being unsure of
what was to become of the ideas she contributed, appreciated being able to speak
from her own perspective about what she
felt the college needed to work on. "I was
influenced by my personal bias in the
groups I am involved in and sort of my own
individual needs," she said.
"We want students to know that the
process [is] open enough that their voices
will still have an impact," Udekwu said.
"There will definitely be outcomes from
anything they put in. We're always tabling.
We do read the messages in the box. The
important thing is for us to show that
we've gotten the ideas, that we've compiled
them and that we're discussing them. It
will show people that we're serious about
hearing from them," he said.
Although students were free to contribute ideas to any of the subcommittees,
Gallagher talked about financial aid policy
as one of her biggest issues.
"There should be a more specific taking
into account of the specific family situation
of the students," she said. "For instance, if
parents are divorced, and a student lives
with one parent and not the other parent, I
don't think it's realistic for the non-custodial parent to pay a part of the tuition."
As an institution, the college is constantly contemplating about future constraints or necessities. Consequently, campaign ideas, whether small or big, are continuously being proposed by different
members of the college, according to
Eldridge.
No
"There will always be campaigns
higher education institution will ever be
able to do the good work they do without
philanthropy," Eldridge said.
Just recently, the college completed a
capital campaign called "The Meaning of
Swarthmore" that took into account several pressing issues, including the need
for more financial aid, increasing the
number of summer internships and financial aid for them, expanding departments
like Film and Media Studies and Islamic
Studies, supporting new faculty positions
and building construction and renova...

tion.
This campaign raised more than 200
million dollars, exceeding its initial goal of
funding. According to Gardner, the next
campaign does not yet have a target goal,
but is expected to equal or even exceed the
last campaign.
"I think people are optimistic that we
can raise a similar or larger amount of
money," Gardner said. "The take away
lesson for everybody is that we're dealing
with lots of money, huge amounts of
money, that will be spent towards creating the college that we want to see in the
next 15 to 20 years. What I do know is it's
going to be a significant amount of funding."

Planning group committees are expected to finish reports by the end of the semes-

ter, and the final report will be presented to
the steering committee by next fall. All
those in involved, particularly the student
representatives, strongly encourage student input, even from those who were
unable to make it to the information ses-

sion last week.

Quiz Bowl wins in the Mideast Hotel planned for 2011
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's Quiz Bowl team is heading to St.

Louis for the National Academic Quiz Tournament
finals in April after winning the 2008 Mideast sectionals this month in Pittsburgh.
Quiz bßwl is a trivia game where a moderator
reads questions to two teams, usually made up of
four players each, and players compete to buzz in
first with the correct answer to win points for their

team.

Two types of questions are asked: tossup and
bonus questions. Any individual player answers
tossup questions, whereas the team answers bonus
questions after a tossup question is answered correctly, according to the NAQT web site.
The questions cover academic subject areas representative of a liberal arts college education, such
as literature, history, science, fine arts and philoso-

phy.
"To be good at Quiz Bowl, it helps to have a good
memory, especially for useless stuff," Scott
Shearousse 'lO, a member of this year's team, said.
"You have to be interested in a wide range of

things."

At a recent practice, questions covered topics
from ancient capitals to string theory to ESPN's forays into reality TV, all within one round of play.
"The biggest subject areas are usually science and
literature," Josh Sokol 'll, a team member, said.
Sokolis responsible for the revitalization of the

team this year.
"The team's been around a long time, but it went
defunct last year," Sokol said. The college's previous quiz bowl team had national success, winning
the undergraduate championship in 1998, but
stopped competing last year.
"I played in high school, and I really missed it
and wanted to do it here too," Sokol said. Sokol
recruited people with previous experience on a Quiz
Bowl team and used the sign up list from last year's
activity fair to contact students about the team's
reincarnation.

Although none of the members from the previous
team were interested in participating, Sokol found
enough interest from freshman and sophomores to
create a new team.
"I did Quiz bßwl back in high school, but it was
definitely not as important as it is here," Alexander
Warso 11 said. "It's a lot of fun. You get to see what

you know, and it makes you appreciate the random
applications of what you learn."
This year, the team has participated in tournaments at Princeton and University of Pennsylvania,
as well as the sectionals in Pittsburg, where they
went 12-0 and won their division.
Because the team is young and still inexperienced, it is eligible for Division 11, in which they
can compete against other young teams of equal cal-

iber, according to Sokol.
Many larger institutions have teams with more
resources, including graduate students who still
continue to be active members. As opposed to
underclassmen, these graduate students have had
several more years of learning and experience in
the Quiz Bowl competition.
"The harder areas are usually social philosophers and international literature," Sokol said. "We
just don't have experience with those because we
are only freshman and sophomores and haven't had
enough time to learn about them yet."
The tournament in Pittsburgh and the upcoming
finals in St. Louis are both NAQT style tournaments, which the team prefers, according to Sokol.
"Right now the majority of the team prefers
NAQT because the questions are shorter and it is a
little easier," Sokol said.
The team is funded by the college in order to pay
for the transportation needed to get to these tournaments.
"We initially got funding from the Dean's office,"
Sokol said. "This semester we submitted to [the
Student Budget Committee] our initial budget

request."

Part of this money was used to buy a set of
buzzers for the team and part goes toward buying

questions for the team to practice with, according to

Sokol. Teams with more experience are expected to
write their own questions for the tournaments,
something Sokol hopes the Swarthmore team will
be able to do in the future.
For now, Sokol's goal for the team is to place in
the top five at the upcoming tournament.
In future years, he hopes to expand the team by
advertising at next year's activity fair to let students know that the team is competing again.
The team right now has about 12 players, enough
to make two teams that compete at each tournament, according to Sokol.
"I'm just doing this for fun," Shearouse said.
"And I hope to continue to play next year."

"aggressive."
However, as Billings noted,
the Borough
did receive
around $1.5 million for the
reconstruction of the Ville's
sidewalk and street lamp system two years ago, so the
Borough has been "encouraged so far in its conversations with the state."

As for the college, there
will be an undisclosed financial risk that the committee
will "try to minimize so as to
have as little burden as possible."
"We may, in the end, wind
up with no burden," Hain
said. The college will continue
to own the land, which the
developer will lease from the

college for an amount of time
that will likely be at least 60
years, according to Hain.
During this time, the college would receive rent for the

land, and after the end of the
lease period all of the
improvements made on the
land would revert to full ownership by the college.
Contrary to some of the
ideas that had been floated in

previous discussions of the
inn, portions of the Crum
Woods will not be used to

make up for the loss of athletic space that the construction
of the inn complex will cause.
According to Hain, past
expansions of other athletic
spaces mean that the softball
field can more-or-less be relocated to an area between the
proposed driveway into the
inn complex and PPR.

Gardner said.

will lead to the elimination of
the C lot student parking area,
Hain said that the Goldenberg
plan provides for enough
parking to at least make up for
the loss of C Lot and to provide for estimated commercial
traffic. Also, temporary parking solutions would be provided when the construction
starts.

"We'll have a more formal

Eldridge recalls racial tensions of undergraduate days
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu
In honor of Black History Month, Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l held a fireside chat sponsored by the Swarthmore
African-American Student Society on
Monday evening, in which he discussed the
state of race relations during his own years
as a Swarthmore student.

"[A dean] said to me that
maybe I didn't belong at
Swarthmore there was no
way I wasn't going to come
back after hearing that."
Maurice Eldridge '6l
Vice President
...

"It is Black History Month and SASS
wanted to keep the focus local, on the institution of Swarthmore," said Yoshi Johnson
'OB, one of the event's organizers.
"Specifically we wanted to bring Eldridge's
perspective on what it was like then, when
he was one of the few African American students, and now, when over 36 percent [of the
student body] are students of color."
In his talk, Eldridge spoke about what it
was like to be at the college at the height of
the civil rights movement. Eldridge came to
Swarthmore when he was 17. "It was a place
I wanted to be
I was excited to come,"
Eldridge said in his talk. Eldridge was in
ninth grade in the D.C. public school system
when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Brown vs. Board ofEducation to desegregate public schools.
-

He was then recruited to a progressive
boarding school, and it was the headmaster

of the school who encouraged him to apply
to Swarthmore.
"When I think back on that part of the
experience of getting to Swarthmore, I realized that my headmaster and his wife really
pushed me out here as an experiment to push
Swarthmore to go further in the right direction," Eldridge said. At the time, there were
very few students of color on campus, and
when Eldridge arrived in the fall of 1957, he

was shocked by the school's atmosphere.
"Here I was, this naive, eager, aggressive,
liberal person, expecting to come to a paradise where what I felt and believed in and
what was really true in life was going to be a
part of my experience at Swarthmore, and
sadly, it was not," Eldridge said.
Eldridge explained that the social aspect
of the college was split between two groups:
the half ofcampus that was more progressive
and socially active students and the half that

was dominated by fraternities and athletics.
Unlike Swarthmore today, both of these
groups lacked diversity. "The black people
were mostly people who made beds and
served food in the dinning halls," Eldridge

advised him to take a year off from school.
"He said to me that maybe I didn't belong at
Swarthmore," Eldridge said. "That was the
right thing to say because there was no way
I wasn't going to come back after hearing
that."
After his year off working, Eldridge
returned to Swarthmore with a new motivation. "I came back determined to be myself,
chart my own course," Eldridge said. "Part of
not being in a community is that it allows the
majority to project onto you what a black
person is."
Many African-American students at the
time lost track of their identities because of
the lack of support systems for minorities in
colleges. "In colleges at the time, if you were
a person of color, and there were very few on
campus, there wouldn't be a large peer
group, or black faculty," Christopher

said.

"It was really powerful to
finally hear his story I felt
like I was sitting at home
listening to my grandfather
tell me his personal history."
Ayanna Johnson 'O9
...

While at Swarthmore, Eldridge became
politically involved in desegregation, helping
to organize bus trips and marches on
Washington. Partly because of this involvement and its effects on his academics, a dean

Densmore, curator of the Friends Historical
Library, said. "Those kinds of support structures were not there. It was a different kind

of environment."
Although he said it took some work,
Eldridge was able to come back to
Swarthmore as the person he wanted to be.
"It happened because I took charge of my
life," Eldridge said. "It doesn't only have to
do with race. Every adolescent has to at one
point."

Student's reactions to Eldridge's talk
were mostly positive. "It was really powerful
to finally hear his story," Ayanna Johnson
'O9 said. "And it was interesting to learn what
Swarthmore was like in the past. I felt like I
was sitting at home listening to my grandfather tell me his personal history."
"I'm really glad he could come," Johnson
said. "The turn-out was amazing."

Wisconsin students bring big poll turnout
the voting process was smooth, but "it would have been
fine if people would register beforehand."
Young said he is all for registering at the polls, "but it
is a real big burden when 90 percent of the people come in

unregistered."
If pre-registered voters came in Young moved them to the

front of the ballot line.
Over the 24 years Young has worked as a poll worker, he
said yesterday's turnout was one of the greatest he has seen.
"Obviously the candidates targeted youth," Young
said. "Obama especially made a really strong presence on

Tuesday's presidential primaries.
Members came and went as leaders frantically directed
them to polling places around the city to help facilitate the
voting process and keep voters waiting in line patient by
distributing small candies costing under a dollar.

campus."
The voter registration line at Lowell Hall was never in
a lull, as new voters kept on coming. The conversation in
the line was small but friendly, said Elaine DeSmidt, a
Lowell poll worker and Dane County supervisor for
District 3.
"People in line are willing to help each other, vouching to verify addresses, but there is no chatting about
candidates," DeSmidt said. "People are respectful of others' business."
Young said a city official conducting the polling place
accessibility survey stopped by Gordon Commons and
examined door handles and handicap parking spots.
But according to Young, the real problem with accessibility was the treacherous, icy sidewalks all around

Arctic temperatures and ice-covered sidewalks certainly did not keep people from the polls yesterday they came
in masses, said College Democrats Chair Oliver Kiefer.
"I'm pretty sure my whole floor has come through,"
said Witte Hall resident Abrianna Barca, a UW freshman
and member of the College Democrats.
Barca was stationed at the Gordon Commons polling
place as a poll watcher. Sitting next to the voter registration
tables, Barca said she was there to make sure every student
could vote and if one was turned away to figure out why.
Her presence had nothing to do with supporting
Democrats, she said.
"It is so important for students to vote because we are
coming into the age where politics will really affect our
lives," she added.
The College Democrats stationed poll watchers at every
ward around the city where students vote.
Adam Young, chief inspector for polling places in the
45th ward, worked the poll at Gordon Commons. He said
-

Gordon Commons.
"If the city and the

university are really concerned
with accessibility, why aren't they clearing their sidewalks?" he asked, adding for a person in a wheelchair,
just getting to a polling place is a problem.

Gordon Commons and Lowell Center polling places
were equipped with AutoMARK, a machine that lets visu-

ally impaired people vote independently. According to
Matt Zimmerman, chief inspector for the Lowell Center
polling place, no one used the AutoMARK as of 5 p.m., but
in past elections it has been used.
After the 8-hour workday during which the polls are
open, the poll workers' day is still not over. Workers clean up
the poll room and go through every ballot, checking for
write-in names, or what Young called "Mickey-Mouse votes."
"Why would you waste your vote like that?" he asked.
Back at the College Democrats' tent at Library Mall,
Awais Khaleel, vice president of College Democrats of
America stopped by to see how the night was going and
what he could do to help.
Khaleel is also a Democratic Party superdelegate, representing the youth voice ofhis party. At the political convention, superdelegates are free to vote for whichever candidate they want, free of primary results. In close primary
elections, superdelegate votes can be the deciding factor

for who wins the nomination.
In the past few weeks, Khaleel said he has been acting
as a resource for the UW chairs of Students for Obama and
Students for Hillary, "helping them on different levels and
not stepping on their toes."
While waiting in line with her friends at the Lowell
Center, Justine Newhouse, a UW senior and member of
Tri-Delta sorority, summed up the reason for voting.
"You're supposed to have a voice. If I don't agree with
the choice that's made in the end, at least I know I did my
part," she said.

Northwestern U. faculty call plagiarism allegations a crisis
BY NATHALIE TADENA
DAILY NORTHWESTERN (NORTHWESTERN U.)
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111.
Members of the
Northwestern University Medill faculty released a statement Monday afternoon strongly condemning Dean John
Lavine in a controversy surrounding anonymous quotes
used in an alumni magazine.
The situation has led Northwestern University
provost's office to examine accusations made against
Lavine and provoked an outcry from Medill alumni.
"This matter has become a crisis for the school," said
a letter signed by 16 members of the journalism school's
faculty. "The principles of truthfulness and transparency
in reporting are at the core of Medill's professional and
academic mission."
The statement, which was also sent to the Chicago
Tribune as well as NU President Henry Bienen and
Provost Dan Linzer, called for the dean to "put an end to
what has become an embarrassment to Northwestern and
to Medill."
The controversy began after a Feb. 11 column by Daily
columnist David Spett that questioned the use and
authenticity of anonymous sources in an article published the alumni magazine last spring.
In the "Letter from the Dean" that opened the issue,
Lavine quoted an anonymous student praising an advertising class. Spett wrote that he contacted all 29 students
in the class but could not find the source of the quote.
Lavine said he could not remember the source of the
quote but vouched for its authenticity, pointing the way
to a video where students made similar comments.

Lavine's office referred requests for comment Tuesday
to university spokesman Al Cubbage.
"Questions have been raised recently regarding the
use of unnamed sources and the veracity of quotations by
John Lavine.
The Office of the Provost is reviewing
those questions," Cubbage said in a written statement.
NU cannot comment on the review because it is a personnel matter, the statement continued.
Many faculty members said they signed the statement
to uphold the fundamentals of journalism that Medill

some people perhaps wanted more time to mull it over
and think about it," she said.
An additional lecturer added his name to the statement after its release, bringing the number of faculty signatures to 17. Professor David Protess said the statement
will be re-circulated among faculty Wednesday.
Members of the school's Board of Advisers have
responded to the statement with support for faculty.
"I think this raises questions that many people believe
the dean has not answered," said George de Lama, Medill
'79, deputy managing editor for news at the Chicago
Tribune.
The Tribune has editorialized on the controversy and
covered it since the column first appeared.
"It is imperative that the dean and Medill be totally
transparent on this issue because that is one of the basic
tenets of good journalism," said Sidmel Estes-Sumpter,
Medill '76 and '77, a broadcast producer in Atlanta.
The controversy has also provoked discussion on
Medill alumni e-mail listserves and on journalism Web

...

teaches its students.
"The most important thing as a result of the statement
is to generate the type of discussion about the sorts of
standards we're teaching about in class every day
the
sanctity of reporting methods, the kind of bond of trust
we have with our sources and with our readers, that anything we place in quotation marks was reliably said precisely," said Associate Professor Douglas Foster, who
signed the statement. "It was important for those of us
who teach the subject to say the same thing to the outside
world as to the students every day in the classroom."
Former Dean Loren Ghiglione, who was replaced by
Lavine in Winter Quarter 2006, was among the faculty
members to sign the letter.
"I'm saddened by the controversy and coverage and I
hope that the dean will take steps that will end the controversy and allow him to continue making the needed
changes at Medill," Ghiglione said.
The decision to sign is a personal one for professors
and lecturers, said Assistant Professor Mindy Trossman.
"The controversy was escalating very quickly, we felt,
and we knew we wanted to get something out quickly and

sites.
Lavine was already a controversial figure because of
the changes he has instituted in the journalism program,
and a faculty resolution in June criticized the methods he
used to make those changes.
"It's a good first step, but I do think it needs to go a
step farther than just pulling out the name of a student,"
Estes-Sumpter said. "We need to have a very honest and
frank discussion about the values that Dean Lavine has
when it comes to journalism and journalism at Medill.
Just pulling out a name doesn't answer the question: Are
we the same Medill as we have been historically?"

Mark Dlugash spends a moment v#th one of the

Although they are all smiles for the camera, these children ail suffer from malaria. The current project of

BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS
azalokol@swarthmore.edu

Typical Swarthmore: Mark Dlugash 'OB, an
Honors psychology and education major, manages
to find an open time slot in his hour-by-hour, dayby-day overscheduled schedule to pencil in "save
the world." Recently named a 2008 Academic AllStar by USA Today, Dlugash is one of 20 undergraduates whom the newspaper honored for both

their academic excellence and their contributions

to society.
"I was very surprised [to receive the award],"
Dlugash said. "I didn't expect it because a lot of
people apply. I thought that maybe I'd get onto the

second- or third-teams or on the list of honorable
mentions, but I didn't at all expect to get chosen
for the first-team."
Jy|
USA Today singled out Dlugash partly because
of the anti-malaria campaign he helps run
through the Global Health Forum, an organization that he co-founded with Athena Samaras 'O7.
According to Swarthmore's Student Activities
Web site, the Global Health Forum is a non-partisan, educational organization that raises awareness of global health issues, such as HIV/AIDS,
malaria, poverty and violence against women.
The group's current project is an anti-malaria
campaign that seeks to raise awareness of malaria in Uganda and to fundraise for its treatment
and prevention.
Dlugash realized the extent of the malaria epidemic in Africa when he attended a malaria conference that was sponsored by Americans for
Informed Democracy. At the conference he
learned sobering statistics such as the fact that
every 30 seconds, one child under five dies from

research, accompanied Katie Camillus 'OB on a
trip to Uganda. In Uganda, Dlugash spoke with
the mothers of children who were suffering from
malaria. Although he had initially intended to
interview the children themselves, he realized,
upon arriving in Uganda, that they were much too
sick for that. "I didn't realize that that was what
it was going to be like," Dlugash said.
Still, the trip was very important to him. "I
wanted to take stories back since not everyone
can go to Africa, or can go to a place that's having
a lot of difficulties. Once you see it first hand, it
radicalizes you a little bit and makes you feel like
you need to fix this. I thought that bringing stories'back would be one way to get people involved,
even if they don't have a chance to go there themftjfl
selves/' Dlugash said.

"Once you see it first hand, it

makes you feel like you need

Mark Dluglash 'OB
The combination of the conference and the trip
to Uganda opened Dlugash's eyes and spurred him
to action: he and Samaras, who had also attended
the conference, decided to start a chapter of
Americans
for Informed Democracy at
Swarthmore and started hosting events on campus. Eventually, Dlugash and Samaras decided to
focus their efforts on global health issues.
"We thought it would be cool to start our own
organization and have a place on campus for people to talk about major gk>bal internationalhealth
problems, and that, malaria was something we

could focus on," Dlugash said. "Malaria is so inexpensive to treat and prevent. If everyone in the
area uses bed nets, it completely kills the mosquitoes and drastically reduces malaria."
Dlugash has big plans for the anti-malaria
campaign. He intends to use the $2,500 that he will
receive from USA Today to try to make the camsustainable.
"There are 10,000 people in the Acholi Quarter
of Uganada. That means that we need to find
sources of funding to fund 10,000 bed nets every 5
years," Dlugash said. "Ultimately, the goal for
Global Health Forum is to have it be a non-profit
in the world, and to get funding from difference
sources, and to apply for grants from different
sources, but to be based at Swarthmore," he
added.
After graduating, Dlugash plans to travel to
Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania: in Ethiopia, he
intends to work with an organization that is concerned with HIV/AIDS advocacy; in Uganda, he
wants to do a follow-up for the bed net program;
and in Tanzania, he plans on working with a particular orphanage with which one of his acquaintances was once involved. Dlugash stated that in
the long run, he would like to go into public service and study human rights law.
While Dlugash says that he doesn't think of
himself as an activist or an idealist, there's no
doubt that his vision for the future is one that is
rooted in the principles of idealism. Still, the very
real difference that his anti-malaria campaign has
produced makes the ideals that Dlugash works
toward seem more and more like a practical possibility rather than a hard-to-reach dream, as
does the work of the other 19 USA Today
Academic All-Stars.
If nothing else, these remarkable undergraduates show us that Swarthmore's particular brand
of idealism, though sometimes construed as uhrealistic, is happening all around us.

Enjoying a concert with coffee at DaVinci's
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

Dwight Smith 'OB, Harry Russin 'O9
and Yaeir Heber 'll certainly know how to
draw a crowd. Last Friday night, dozens
of Swarthmore students flocked to
DaVinci's cafe in the Ville in order to
hear the trio perform a blend of original
and cover songs.

The presence of the
accordion and Herber's
skilled mandolin playing
added a pleasantly
non-traditional aspect.
The band, referred to loosely as Dwlght
Smith and Friends, took a very simple
approach to making music. Smith played
the guitar and sang lead vocals while
Russin alternated between the accordion
and keyboard. Heber mainly played the
drums, switching to the mandolin at one
point in the evening.
Russin described the band's music as
"pentatonicized jazz folk." For Smith,

THE PHOENIX

Russin and Heber, this meant short pieces
with gently pleading vocals and rhythmically rumbling accompaniments. The
presence of the accordion and Herber's
skilled mandolin playing added a pleasantly non-traditional aspect to the set.
Most of the songs that the trio per-

formed at DaVinci's were originally written by Smith and feature lyrics that are as
insightfully terse as snatches of poetry.
Two pieces, composed by Russin, opened

with lingering keyboard melodies. The
trio also treated the crowd to covers of
Bob Dylan's "It Ain't Me Babe" and "Don't
Think Twice, It's Alright" in addition to
The Beatles' "A Day in the Life."
Students at DaVinci's responded
enthusiastically, asking for an encore
when the band was slated to end its set.
The venue itself also proved to be a
draw for those who wanted to venture
slightly off-campus.
"For me, going to see live music is
much more than the performance itself,"
Ruth McDonough 'OB said, "So the freshness of an off-campus venue was nice."
For those who missed Dwight Smith
and Friends' performance or couldn't

make it past the crowd that blocked
DaVinci's door, the band will be making a
special appearance next Friday night,
Feb. 29, at the Women's Resource Center.

Real Old Prospector
I'm not sure if it's the fact that our
remaining time at Swarthmore can be counted in weeks instead of months, the longawaited comeback of the Jolt, which had
sunk to Raghu's backpack levels of Bolivian
or the heretofore discussed gauntlet of
February romantic torments that deaden
mind and loin alike, but nostalgia seems to
be in the air these days for seniors
although, granted, that could just be the New
Dorm II asbestos. While this sudden yen to
think fondly back to younger days may dissi-

Sunflash the Mace), there has nevertheless
been a marked wistfulness among fellow
'oBers to return to old stomping grounds, and
with that spirit in mind I headed out on
Saturday night with my hopes soaring higher than Dwight Howard, only to be deflated
by the bleakest sight on campus: A dead
Paces party.
It is the eternal question of Swarthmore:
What does one do if one has pre-partied to
the gills and is in mixed company only to
find the familiar confines empty, with the
dregs of disheartened party coordinators, a
frantically grinding couple oblivious to the
world outside their pelvises, horrified
specs wondering how binding early
admission really is and the continuous risk of reggaeton remain-

people publish anony-mously.) By all rights
after the recent scandals the Frat world
should have been more ripped to shreds than
a College Republican flyer, but believe me
they were in biznasty on Saturday night.
I tend to avoid writing about my admit
tedly limited experience in the frats because
they're not my tea cup and I know there are
people who swear by them (and later at
them), but I can say that I admire their
approach to dating. To this day the frat-boy
en masse non-cross-dressed storming of my
sophomore year Sager at 1:30 remains a

maneuver so efficient that even Omar

Bradley would nod in approval. That room
was so full of people hooking up by 1:45 that
I felt like I was the bathroom sink in the
Escape music video. The apparently legendary "graffiti party" is another masterstroke. Essentially, there are a bunch of people walking around with phallus substitutes
marking their territory with various semiexplicit drawings and, as space fills on white
t-shirts, having no choice but to enter more
risque territory. I couldn't help noticing in
comparison to various women that the queue
forming to write on my paper-white skin was
non-existent and thus realized again that I
should have pledged freshman year. Kudos.
Now, despite my last paragraph, I shoulc

mention that the party was pretty fun, with
free tomato juice, a marginally well DJ-ed
dance floor and a huge number of seniors
who seemed to have been bitten by the same
nostalgia bug that got me. The next time
Paces is empty I might even consider going
back, although there is another great
Swarthmore tradition that I will soon be nostalgic for that I might indulge in instead:
complaining about the frats.

ALEX HO

Critical Mass Media
Kanye West's acceptance speech at
the 2008 Grammys may have been
about as shrill a public staging as any
of his past diva antics: his message
about crossing genres was pretty stale,
considering that that's about all any
mainstream hip hop artist has done for
the past decade or two. But his

expressed ambition to be "the number
one artist in the world," to say nothing
of his totally queer Rocket Man-esque
get-up that night, speaks to a general
trend for hip-hop towards an increasingly abstract and faceless product
that can appeal to as many people
across the globe as possible. Nas was
right, and wrong. Hip hop is far from
dead, but it's certainly miles away
from its original social and political
roots.
To start with the obvious, hip hop is
no longer alternative. It is and has for
a while been the status quo of mainstream pop
music. Today,
the
inevitable progression for, it seems,
nearly every pop artist is to go hip hop,
from a means for once squeaky clean
bubblegum pop figures to get "Dirrty"
to the unexpected reinvention of folksy

Furtado. And with its induction
into the mainstream, hip hop has
largely shorn off its counter-cultural
Nelly

context. It's tough to imagine anything
as straightforwardly angry as Public
Enemy's "Fight the Power" today. But
that's hardly a problem since hip hop
has so many other elements to chew
on. As a musical niche with a heavy
visual component, namely its style of
dancing, no doubt propped up by the

MTV and the music video,

hip hop has become an easily accessible signifier of modernity and of coolness that any youth culture can latch
on to. Just look at hip hop's prominence in virtually any nation's pop
music industry.
Hip hop's übiquity makes the criticism of its lyrical content all the more
ironic. It's undeniable that by the late
'9os much of mainstream hip-hop's thematic scope had regressed to a total of

The recent glorification of the ghetto bares itself in a pretty recent text
that caters to the suburban high school
demographic, (I may just have to crucify myself for referencing it) the
direct-to-video masterpiece "Bring it
On 3: All or Nothing." Okay, I can't
speak for the whole of the film, as I've
only seen about half an hour of clips
through YouTube, but what I've seen is
just so excellent. Not even getting into
the movie's over-the-top horniness,
this sequel takes the cheerleadingcomedy-doubling-as-an-after-school
special-on-racism paradigm and goes
way further than could ever be conceivable in 2000, somewhat making

amends for the offensive "separate, but
equal" message of the original. Our
new
white-as-snow
protagonist,
Britney (now Hayden Panettiere), has
to leave her beloved cheerleading
squad when she moves to a largely
black and Hispanic school. Initially
ostracized for her whiteness ("This
ain't 'The O.C" she's told when she
arrives.), Britney has to prove to
Solange Knowles' queen bee that she is
talented i.e. ghetto enough to be on the
cheerleading team.

Hip hop is far from

dead, but it's certainly
miles away from its
original social and
political roots.
The 'hood culture is played to a cartoonish excess here with Britney's new
squad krumping to literally scare her
former squad off the stage in the film's
hilarious final dance-off. But, unlike
somber, tasteful miscegenation movies
of the early 'oos like "Save the Last
Dance" and "Crazy/Beautiful," "Bring
It On 3" isn't lip service; it's the real
deal, unabashedly reflecting how hiphop has been wholly embraced by

youth culture.

This is all to say that Kanye West
isn't accomplishing anything new. Hip
hop has long dominated pop culture,
and West is merely coasting along its
mass appeal. Electing every pop star in
your phonebook to guest perform in
your records, sampling like there's no
tomorrow and randomly spewing out
topical issues makes for a compulsively listen-able pop album, but it's hardly new or relevant. Is the irony completely lost on him when, in

"Stronger," he raps, "Do anybody
make real shit anymore?" West's
brand of hip hop reflects what's most
boring and self-promoting about making it to the top.

Soweto at Swat
BY SUNNY COWELL
scowelll@swarthmore.edu
This past Friday, the Soweto Street Beat Dance
Theater brought Zulu music, rhythms and a whole lot of
people to the Lang Performing Arts Center. This special
event was sponsored by the Mellon Mays
Undergraduate Fellowship Program as part of a five-day
residence at Bryn Mawr, Haverford and Swarthmore
Colleges. Several students attended the workshop as
well. The company, originally formed in 1989 in Soweto,
South Africa by Executive Director Peter Ngcobo and
Artistic Director Isabelle Doll Ngcobo, is a South
African dance and music troupe from Atlanta that aims
to teach audiences of all ages, especially at-risk youth,
about the cultural history of South Africa. Peter and
Isabelle created the group in order to help youths in the
crime-ridden Soweto Township of Johannesburgwhere,
due to poor circumstances, school dropout rates were
high. In order to keep the youth in school, the Ngcobos
encouraged education by teaching them about South

MINOR CATASTROPHY METER

African's rich history of the arts.

Friday's performance opened with a brief introduction by Charles James, Professor Emeritus and coordinator of the Mellon Mays Fellowship Program. James
first saw the Soweto Street Beat Dance Theater perform
in Atlanta and has workedfor over a year to bring them
to Swarthmore. In the words of James, the Soweto per-

formers "bring the flavor and complexity of [the] sound
and music" of the Zulu Kingdom to the stage. The dance
troupe performed an extensive piece entitled "Zulu
Kingdom: a history of the Zulu Nation" for an audience
of students and professors from the tri-colleges as well
people from the town of Swarthmore.
The piece began with eight male performers on a
stage tinted by red lighting. They played various kinds
of drums and were dressed in decorative costumes and
elaborate headdresses that swayed whenever the performers danced. They were adorned with necklaces,
white paint on their bodies and fur around their ankles.
Amplified by a microphone, one singer started the piece
with a solo before the rest of the group joined in. After
the troupe continued this call-and-response style, they
moved front stage toward the audience performing a
dance routine

with high

energy and

intensity.

Emmanuelle Wambach 'OB, who attended the Soweto
workshop, said, "It was a lot more high-energy than I'm
used to. The performers and drummers are amazing."
The dancers incorporated whistling sounds as they
synchronized their dancing to the beat of the drums and
worked their entire bodies with high jumps and fastpaced movements. The piece was composed of several
parts that were characterized by different styles. During
one movement, the performers even called as many as
30 audience members to the stage to dance with them.
The dancers gradually got the audience to join them on
stage by first asking them to clap to the rhythms.
The troupe quickly alternated between playing
drums, singing and dancing. Many of the troupe members took turns performing impressive drum and dance
solos during which they would stand, crouch, sit down
or even dance on their backs. They encouraged audience participation by signaling them to clap at different
speeds. Many parts of the piece featured traditional
Zulu dances; however, some movements were distinguished by ethno-fusion styles. At one point, the Zulu
performers danced and drummed to American hip hop
beats easily recognized by the audience. Marshall
Morales 'OB, who also attended the dance workshop,
said, "various members of the company taught different
styles in a challenging and enjoyable manner."
The troupe then taught the audience how to say
some phrases in Zulu. Next, the dancers called about 30
students onstage to learn a few Zulu moves. To the audience's amusement, the dancers also called several professors onstage to dance with them. After the audience
participated, the Soweto Street Beat dancers resumed

Elanchenny 10 thought the performers did an excellent
job of uniting movement and rhythm. She said, "I

general to visit and support education in South Africa.

Culturally sensitive conquistadors of the old world
The first real trip I
took last fall (excluding the obvious one
that initially brought
me
across
the
Atlantic) was to Eger,
a small town about

three

hours

from

Budapest by commuter train. To the
extent that Eger is

famous, it is known
for its cathedral, its
minaret (a dilapidat-

ed building that hap-

pens to be the northernmost exemplar of

Ki Vagy?!

Turkish architecture
in Europe), its mod-

estly sized castle and
its truly outstanding
wine, although I was only clued into these many attractions after our language professor suggested we go there.
The trip was also my first exposure to last minute
gonzo traveling sans plan. My family functions like a
small army, albeit a poorly organized one, so the idea of
showing up someplace without having found a place to
stay or things to see was anathema to the first 20 years of
my development.

That, however, did not stop three friends and me from
buying tickets at the last minute, barely making

the

train, wandering aimlessly through several obligatory
tourist stops and then wandering even more aimlessly
for several hours while we tried to find a place to stay.
My friend, attempting to explain that we needed a room
for four, might actually have asked for four young boys.
Despite all the stupidity we could muster, we did find
lodgings for the night, and Day Two dawned with a sense
of purpose: we were going to find the Valley of Beautiful
Women, home of Eger's famed wine cellars.
The scope of our journey seemed reminiscent of Ponce
de Leon's quest for the fountain of youth, minus any
altercations with the Natives. After wandering through

Hungarian suburbia for several hours, the valley opened
up before us, beckoning like K.B. Toys in the local mall.

What we had come to see consisted of maybe two

equally grizzled farmer friend, who opened said wine cellar and brought out a two-liter plastic bottle of an

unidentified local red wine. Our friend put
it four small glasses, filled them up, and
en we watched as the Hungarian farmers
>sed wine back like Robitussin.
The first important lesson I learned while
road was that any attempt to decline spirits
am a Hungarian is doomed to failure.
We chattered for a while, by which I
mean that they asked us questions we
spent a lot of time trying to understand
without success. Laughter seemed the
most effective way of communicating. It

dozen wine cellars built cheek-to-jaw in a ring, so exploring was as exotic as wandering from one door to the next.
The interesting part, though, is that once there, you're
actually a stone's throw away from the vineyards them
selves.
After meandering up a short path, my female frient
and I found ourselves face to face with scenery most fre
quently seen on Italian postcards: row upon row of vine
adorned with turgid, alluring grapes, following the
contours of the hillside out of sight. In the distance we
could almost make out a cluster of pastel houses that
might have been the city.
Following the same narrow, stony
path, we wandered past two small
fenced-in
houses with an
orchard in between. A grizzled
farmer hailed us from within
and, when we responded with
all the enthusiasm befitting

must have been going well, though,
because our friend excused himself for a
moment, only to come back with an armload of assorted fruits.
Not to be outdone, his friend also left
and returned with a comparable armload. Suddenly we found ourselves short
on time but long on two kilos of deli-

college-age females exploring the countryside, he
came out to meet us on tl

Writers strike ends, but networks still need to reform system
that has gone on for as long as this one is
bound to change the medium's landscape at
least a bit. Being forced to go without something in this case, screenwriters for so

Writers Guild of America strike has come

than Paris Hilton while being slowly lowered into a lake full of sharks and admitting
to his family that he did, in fact, have a

The current system used
by networks to find new
shows is inefficient and
expensive and is in definite
need of retooling.
The network executives, however, have
also gained some new knowledge about
their medium. Yes, the writers are needed,
but maybe not as much as everyone
thought. The most consistently popular
show on television is an unscripted singing
competition. The ravenous ratings beast

Remember, these are the people who
brought you a sitcom based on a series of
car-insurance commercials about postmod-

preparing to cut back on scripted television
next season.
The addition of extra primetime hours
of reality shows is nothing new. The major
change that could result from the strike is a
drastic cutback in the number of pilot
episodes ordered at the beginning of each
season, accompanied by lowered importance offall and spring "upfront" presentations. The upfronts are basically gigantic
news conferences held by the networks
every year at which the new shows for the
fall season are introduced to the press.
Each year the networks start out with a
large number of scripted series, as well as
reality shows, which are incessantly hyped
at the upfronts in an attempt to guarantee a
large pilot audience. Most of these shows
never make it to a full season, with some
being cancelled after only one or two
episodes. (Remember "Emily's Reasons
Why Not?" Neither does anyone else).
Compounding this problem is the increasing expense of producing special effects
laden pilots for shows like the fall flop

ern cavemen. They can't always be trusted
to have good taste.
The planned cutbacks in pilots also
make it even harder for struggling writers
to catch a break. The eagerness of executives to cancel a show within five episodes
if it doesn't have monstrous ratings has
already created a cutthroat climate in the
industry, to the point where many television veterans believe that a show like
"Seinfeld" one of the most popular series
of all time would not survive today. If
pilot episodes are dispatched with altogether, this problem will become even more pro-

But cutting back on pilots, however

move on the part of the network executives.

little recourse in the event that one of the
new shows is not well received.
The current system used by networks to
find new shows is inefficient and expensive
and is in definite need of retooling.
However, killing a script based simply on a
network executive's opinion of the script is
unfair both to the writer whose script it
was and the viewer whose favorite show it
could have been. Rather, the networks
should stop pouring money into flashy special effects and instead focus on scripts
with intriguing characters and relationships. The networks have finally given the
writers the money that they deserve for
Internet content; refusing to afford those
writers the opportunity to pursue their art

would be a punishment not only for wordsmiths, but for fans as well.

want you to think
that all conspira-

cies are far from
fact, when in reality many conspiracies are closer to the truth than any of us will ever know.
In January of 1996, an ex-U.S. government geologist

and structural engineer by the name of Phil Schneider
was found dead in his apartment. His good friend and coconspirator Ron Rummel had been found dead in a park
three years prior to Schneider's death, due to a gunshot
wound to the head. Cause of death: suicide.
Prior to their deaths, Schneider and Rummel had
worked for the federal government for 17 years, after

which they began to publish a magazine called "The
Alien Digest." The magazine received wide circulation,
but was soon brought to a halt in 1993 with Rummel's
death.

Phil quit his job and toured the
country for the next two years,
lecturing on the secrets he had
been privy to during his work for
the federal government.
Phil was convinced that his friend had not committed
suicide, and had in fact been murdered. Subsequent to
Rummel's death, Phil quit his job and toured the country
for the next two years, lecturing on the secrets he had
been privy to during his work for the federal government.

As Schneider began his lecture tour he made clear
that he was going to be targeted for revealing government secrets and probably would not live long.

THE PHOENIX

We have to consider the
possibility that Schneider
might have known something
that our government does not
want us to know.
Schneider's story was particularly interesting
because he was the first man with such a high level of
security clearance Rhyolite, one of the highest levels
attainable to spread classified information. He made
claims ranging from the pernicious intentions of the
United Nations to the government development of the
AIDS virus. Most importantly, he spoke about the U.S.
-

tion/isolation therapy

for more than four hundred days

and later discovered that he was only one of three men
who made it out alive. Sixty-six others had perished in
battle with the humanoids.
Schneider was found dead seven months after giving
a lecture on his story. Cause of death: suicide. All of his
research and collected evidence of extraterrestrial mineral samples were missing from his apartment. His blood

and urine samples sent to medical examiners were conveniently lost.
Was the U.S. government responsible for Phil
Schneider's death? If so, does this lend validity to
Schneider's claims? Although his story sounds outlandish, we have to consider the possibility that
Schneider might have known something that our government does not want us to know.

government's extraterrestrial relations.

Schneider maintained that the U.S. government has
had relations with extraterrestrials for more than half a
century. He attested that in 1954 the extraterrestrials
signed the Greade Treaty, arranging an exchange of
extraterrestrial technology for the rights to test extraterrestrial implanting techniques on U.S. citizens and livestock.
Schneider went into details about his first and only
encounter with the aliens in August of 1979 while he and

a crew of military government employees were working
on a new underground military base in Dulce, New
Mexico. After their drilling machines repeatedly broke
down, Schneider and others were sent into a subterranean orifice to collect rock samples.
Upon entering the hole Schneider distinctly noted a
repugnant smell unlike anything he had ever experienced. After reaching the bottom of the shaft, Schneider
found himself in an opening with what appeared to be
some kind of humanoid creature. Schneider was naturally startled and began to reach for his pistol. He fumbled

for several moments, trying to free his pistol from his
bulky suit, when he made out the distinct figure of what
appeared to be an extraterrestrial humanoid soon joined
by other similar creatures. Schneider shot and seemingly killed two of the extraterrestrials, and the military
personnel also began shooting the creatures. After two
extraterrestrials had been shot, a third made some kind
of rubbing motion across its stomach and Schneider was

blown backward.
The blast from the creature had split Schneider's
chest open, destroyed several fingers, burned off his toenails and severely burned his bones. He was in radia-

Anonymous The Phoenix staff increasingly diverse
ignorance
This week, the College Republicans collectively made the decision to appropriate
language that is often associated with the
queer community. Over the past several
days, both the forums on the Daily Jolt and

the

Gazette have featured a flurry of
comments critiquing the Republicans' publicity campaign and the anonymous responses to it, which included the removal of some
Daily

of the original flyers.

While these online forums provide an
accessible venue for discussion, we question
the utility of anonymous postings that
relieve their authors of accountability.
There is a clear disconnect between the
language students use in their classes,
among acquaintances and friends, and the
language they use regularly on anonymous
Internet forums like the Daily Jolt and the
Daily Gazette's comments sections. Most of
the language used on these forums, particularly on the Daily Jolt, is reprehensible
hateful, vitriolic and ignorant.
We are certain that comments on the Jolt

are not a representative sample of the opinions that students hold on this campus, nor
do these comments reflect our institutional
commitment to dialog and debate.

We are certain that comments on the Jolt are not a

...

The resurgence of activity on the Daily
Jolt seems to suggest that students would
rather relegate controversial issues to marginal online forums than address them in an
open and honest debate in which the concerned parties and their grievances are
explicitly identified.

Wave upon wave of flyers
and retaliatory posters have
obscured the issues that
students should be
discussing face-to-face.
Wave upon wave of flyers and retaliatory
posters have obscured the issues that students should be discussing face-to-face.
Sabotaging or removing an offensive flyer
not only infringes upon the freedom of
speech; it also precludes constructive dialog
for all parties involved.
It is unreasonable to expect the Young
Republicans to rethink their appropriation
of queer language without expressing this

a reasoned and respect-

recommendation in
ful manner.
We applaud Nick Forrest, Sebastian
Duncan-Portuondo and Shane Breitenstein
for their signed editorial, and urge all concerned parties to take responsibility for
their words and actions. We believe in ownership of language, whether it be in virtual
forums or on the walls and walkways of this
campus.

To the Editor:
In last week's issue, Benjamin
Bradlow wrote about The Phoenix's
diversity. I am grateful that Bradlow
initiated this dialogue as I have often
questioned it myself. Having worked on
the staff and editorial board, I have

been able to experience how The
Phoenix is run and how (and if) diversity is incorporated.

One particular incident comes to

mind when the hiring board was deciding between candidates for a writing
position. I noticed that the group we had
formed consisted of only male writers.

Immediately after bringing this point
up, the hiring board reconsidered the
entire composition of the group in an
attempt to provide more diversity. I
wonder at what point do we look beyond
the diversity of backgrounds to the
diversity of thoughts.
Would it have been right to have an
all-male section if the opinions were all

diverse? Or was The Phoenix obligated
to hire that female writer?
Bradlow specifically noted that the
editorial board was inclusive offew students of color. Perhaps my experiences

with The Phoenix have been unusual,
but I have always seen increasing diversity on the staff. Last semester, the
majority of the editorial board members
were women of color. A further analysis
of the staff would show a wide range of
interests, sexualities, socioeconomic
classes, etc.
In addition, though by no means am
I suggesting that Bradlow did so, I
would caution anyone who would study
The Phoenix's diversity through last
names, skin tones or participation in
campus cultural and support groups.
The Phoenix has multi-ethnic staff
members, several of whom have
expressed their discomfort with having
their ethnicity assigned by such
assumptions.

I agree with Bradlow that The
Phoenix should make steps to become
more open. This move would benefit
The Phoenix's reliability as a media
outlet and would help The Phoenix connect to the community. I also agree that
The Phoenix should sit down with
Deans Sams, Smaw and Zapata.
However, I see this step not out of a specific need but rather as general support
for the existing and growing population.
I would encourage more diversity on
The Phoenix and I'm sure that the editorial board would agree. There is
room for
always
improvement.
However, we cannot ignore the diversity already present.
Many of the students work hard to

ensure that The Phoenix offers fair and

representative coverage. If anyone does
have suggestions, the editorial board, in
my experience, is always open to positive change.

No 2020 preparation without representation
BY SUNG CHOI

schoil@swarthmore.edu
The decisions made in the 2020 planning process will mark a pivotal moment
in the history of Swarthmore College. We,
as a college community,

must boldly reaffirm our
commitment to true diversity and critical multiculturalism by taking this opportunity to
redefine the standards of undergraduate
education. As we heard Maurice Eldridge
speak this week about his experiences
■

here decades ago, we were reminded that

this noble institution's founding ideal of
social justice cannot remain in the ethereal realm of words but must be ceaselessly embodied in our every action and
deed. We cannot stop to applaud ourselves
for being ahead of our peers and our time

when we have the ability to become the

leaders of tomorrow, today.

Galvanized by this chance to leave a
legacy even better than the one we inherited, students primarily from the
Intercultural Center and Black Cultural
Center communities have gathered over
the past several weeks in order to delineate the concrete steps necessary to reach
these goals. At the same time, we have
become very concerned with what we see
as the under-representation of student
voices within the capital campaign and

its planning processes.
First and foremost, we believe that

Swarthmore's commitment to diversity
must be reflected in all facets of the colFebruary

lege. This means filling in the geographic
and cultural gaps in our curriculum and
in
expanding
offerings
course
American/Ethnic Studies with the goal of
developing a minor and major in the field.
It also means having a faculty and staff
as diverse as the student body, providing
spaces and funds that reflect the large and
growing size of the IC/BCC communities
and removing the last vestiges of an
inequitable admissions process by providing need-blind admissions to international students.
The college must also commit to fully
supporting its diverse students and communities. The college must start by aiding students with their transition to life

at Swarthmore by providing an expanded

international orientation as well as a new

bridge program for those coming from
underprivileged school systems.
Afterwards, it must continue its support in the form of mentoring across the
board, for women pursuing careers in the
natural sciences, for members of underrepresented communities interested in
pursuing professional degrees or for
those in need of financial aid counseling.
No less important is the pressing need
to expand the IC and BCC staff in a manner befitting its size and mission. In addition, emergency funds must be made
available to students who find themselves
in a variety of unexpected situations such
as being financially cut off by their parents because of their queer identity.
Lastly, student voices should be fully

structured into the framework of the col-

2% 2008

lege's decision-making process. In addi-

tion to the future implementation of
increased transparency and plenary sessions, there must be greater student rep-

resentation in the planning process at

hand. The Student Council president and

vice president alone simply cannot fully
represent the diverse voices of the student body. Moreover, committee meetings

should not be the only forum to collect
student opinion concerning Swarthmore
and its future. This inadequacy in student
representation threatens Swarthmore's
ideals of community, consensus and selfdetermination.
Therefore, we call upon the college
and the Board of Managers to firmly
uphold these principles and provide a
forum for discussion with a larger crosssection of the student body. We specifically ask that the leaders of the IC and BCC
be given an opportunity to meet with you
in the very near future if not at this
upcoming board of managers meeting in
order to share our vision of Swarthmore
in 2020.

The Ambient Medium
The FDA recently made it legal
to sell meat and milk from cloned
animals, declaring cloned organisms to be just as safe for human
consumption as conventionally-

bred animals.
While that idea makes me
squeamish, they're almost certainly right. However, there is a broader argument to be made here.
Regardless of whether cloned milk
becomes mainstream, it's important to understand that there is
nothing inherently wrong or evil
about genetically modified organisms.
A practical argument can be

made against the application of

genetic engineering to agriculture,
definitely. A discussion of genetically modified crops will actually
be the topic of my next column.
But to be against genetic engineering itself requires a certain level

of ignorance.

It is important to
realize that gene
manipulation is... a
part of the natural
world.
There is no practical basis for
such a position, nor is it possible

to categorically

reject

genetic

because it is morally

reprehensible.
First, on a practical level, there
are applications of genetic engineering that incur next to no costs
or risks, but have huge and fundamental benefits to society. Saying
"no" to genetic engineering is saying "no" to the entire field of
microbiology research today and
most of the recent advances in the

field of medicine. The basic tools
of the trade are gene deletions,
amplification, and recombinations... all of it: genetic engineering. These techniques have been
used by scientists since the 19705.
On a moral level, it is important to realize that gene manipulation is actually very much a part

of the natural world. Scientists
didn't invent the tools to do it,
they discovered them.
Tampering with genes is exactly how viruses make their living

cold viruses.
Is it a huge moral leap to have
scientists use equivalent viruses
to insert genes that make bacte-

ria create life-saving insulin for
diabetics instead of creating
more copies of a virus? We used
get
to
from

cadavers...most people would
agree that synthesizing it in a lab
is a vast improvement.
Genetic engineering isn't just
about shuffling genes around; we
sometimes make new ones by fiddling with existing ones, or even
build them from scratch. But there
is nothing objectionable about
that. First, genetic mutation is a
part of evolution, so new genes in
themselves are not novel.
Second, humans constructing
DNA should not be regarded as
from
fundamentally different
humans constructing other biochemical molecules. We already
manufacture artificial hormone
disrupters, like atrazine, that can
change the sex of an organism simply through exposure. We make
testosterone and estrogen from
scratch, and neurotransmitter
mimics, too.
DNA is often touted in magazines as the building blocks of life,
the essence and blueprint of everything. But, that's really not the
opinion of the biologists, whose
"central dogma" includes two
other molecules: RNA and proteins.
The relationship between your
environment and the expression of
your genes, which ones get turned
on and off and when, is complex
and can vastly change who you
are. DNA is far from be-all-end-all
of everything.
It is powerful because it is heritable, but that is a practical argument. To say DNA is morally on a
different plane because it can be
inherited is to say that it is ok to
transform one organism, but not
okay to transform its offspring.
There is no logic in that.
The question that should be
asked is not, "Is it categorically
wrong to make up genes?" but
"What is a new gene's purpose and
what are the possible implications
of its use?" It's not the tool that
should be judged, it's the purpose
for which it is used.
And so we enter the realm of
GM crops, the topic of my next column. For now, what I hope to have
dissuaded you from is a conviction, or even a vague opinion, that
genetic engineering should be categorically rejected.

Republican misappropriation
BY NICK FORREST AND
SEBASTIAN DUNCAN-PORTUONDO
nforresl@swarthmore.edu and
sduncanl@swarthmore.edu

We would like to address the recent parodying of queer language in the Campus
Republicans posters and our response to a legitimate frustration with this flipP ant appropriation.
in advertising for an upcoming
meeting
the Campus
Republicans used the slogan "It's OK to Come
Out." In response to these fliers, anonymous
posters were placed alongside a row of
Republican fliers in the Shane Student Lounge.
Although the anonymous posters did cover
two Republican posters, the Republican posters
occupied a significant portion of the flier
boards with multiple and repeated identical
fliers. The next day, these anonymous posters
were removed and in their position were placed
even more Republic fliers reading: if you
believe in freedom of speech, do not deface or

remove our fliers. This misconstrues our original exercise of public speech; we did not
remove or deface any fliers.
While we did not mean to challenge the specific personalities associated with the Campus
Republicans, our intention was to acknowledge
the irony of their actions given the institution
for which they speak. For queer people, coming
out is an experience that never ends; in nearly
every new encounter or social situation, the
feeling of difference and marginality associated
with coming out repeats itself.
Coming out, in this way, is meant to signify
a rejection of the normalizing silence that is
projected by a heterosexist world-view. To witness this tradition reduced to an advertisement
February 23, 2008

for the Republican party is personally
affronting and disregards the lived reality of
queer people. While Republicans might understand an aspect of coming out at Swarthmore,
the appropriation of that term by an institution
that instigates the social and juridical marginalization of queer minorities is unacceptable.
Our original posters were meant to challenge their statement in this manner. In
response to the removal of our original posters,
we have hung new fliers in the Shane Student
Lounge and throughout other public campus
spaces. Like the original fliers, our language is
non-confrontational and direct; it reads as fol-

lows:

Campus Republicans have removed signs
questioning their usage of the term "coming
out." We believe it was an act of silencing and
homophobia, directly violating standards of
public speech on campus. The signs removed
were in response to a blatant misappropriation
of what is meant to be an act of pride in self and
in a community as expressed through the term
"coming out."
The parodying of queer language to create a
catchy slogan for an overtly homophobic institution is hurtful. Regardless of the positions of
Republicans,
Campus
individual
the
Republican agenda clearly promotes and
enforces homophobic policy.
Though we don't know if they'll be there
tomorrow, we hope that Campus Republicans
and the student body alike can stop to consider
the implications of their rhetoric. To misappropriate other cultures' language and traditions, irrespective of their historical and political context, is irresponsible, damaging and, at
base, a covert form of cultural violence.

it's that this nation gained its independence as a little guy
fighting the Leviathan. I was fortunate enough to hea

about such a story this weekend, the real life incarnate o
Rocky IV.
When Kelly "The Ghost" Pavlik beat Jermain "The Prid
of Little Rock, Arkansas" Taylor on Saturday night for th
second time, I couldn't help but smile and be happy for th
guy.

Though this fight certainly did not help Taylor's career
I do believe that this fight was good for the sport of boxing
There is no hiding the fact that boxing is in decline. Muc
like Super Bowl XLII did for the sport of football, I think
that Kelly Pavlik's wins over Jermain Taylor can do for th
sport of boxing.
The most striking aspect of the dichotomy that exist
between these two fighters is their backgrounds. Growing up
in the less than affluent city of Youngstown, Ohio, Pavlik i
America's kind of fighter: the rags to riches fighter wh
keeps his humility. Kelly Pavlik trains in the same gym hj
has trained at since he was just a boy and thrives under th
tutelage of Jack Loew, the only boxing coach he's eve

learned from.
Much like his now-world champion fighter, Loew's lif
revolves around modesty and humility. For example, afte
Pavlik first knocked out Taylor last September, Loew

returned to Youngstown to fulfill obligations he had with hi
second job as an asphalt driveway sealer.
Unlike Taylor, Pavlik was not the kind of fighter wh
could hire the most prolific trainers and spar in a comfort
able and secluded resort while surrounded by the best name
money can buy. Kelly Pavlik is a family man as well. Almos
every member of his family works on Pavlik's career in som
fashion, and Pavlik prefers to sleep and eat the home-cooke
food in the same house he grew up in.
Kelly Pavlik is the ideal American success story. He rep
resents the romantic notion that heart and not money i
what is takes to succeed in life. Sure he never had th
flashy lifestyle or expensive products that Taylor was priv
to from his success as a fighter, but Kelly Pavlik had th
pride and determination to stun a champion and take bac
the sport of boxing for the underdog.
Even the first fight itself is reminiscent of somethin
you would see in a movie. Pavlik was sent to the canvas b
Taylor, the previously undefeated Taylor (a stunning 27-0
1), in only the second round and though his fate seeme
sealed, he was able to regain his composure and survive t
the bell.
Though he was able to battle back courageously, Pavli
was still losing on the judges' scorecards until he landed
barrage of punches in the seventh round that sent Taylo
away and showed the 10,000 fans in attendance that some
times the feel-good stories do win.
Judging by his post-fight interview, Pavlik wants th
same thing that happened to him to happen to his home
town. He wants Youngstown, Ohio, to fight back against th
odds and become a top community.
Even though Jermain Taylor had a rematch clause wri
ten into his contract in case he were to fall to Pavlik, Taylo
again battled but lost to the Youngstown hero by unan
mous decision this past Saturday.
If this story doesn't help reaffirm your confidence i
rooting for the underdog, then I don't know what will. In a

jfairfal@swarthmore.edu

Showing poise typical of a seasoned college veteran, runner Caitlin Russell 'll has been having a banner freshman campaign, both on the course and on the
track. Fresh off a selection to the All-Region freshman
team in cross country, Russell followed that up with a
Conference-qualifying performance in the 3000 meters
indoors just one week ago. Jaymes Fairfax-Columbo
sat down with the freshman sensation to understand
the challenges that face a student athlete.
JFC: When did you first start running and why?

CR: I started running track my freshman year of
high school and then cross-country sophomore year
after I realized that I really liked the longer distances.
I had never done a team sport before high school, and
I honestly just wanted to try something completely different. I really liked the group of people and the feeling I got after racing, so I stuck with it. The pasta
feeds weren't bad either.
JFC: Was it easy to make the transition from prep
running to college running?
CR: It doesn't really have to do with college
specifically, but the hardest thing in the transition has
been the weather. Coming from California, I've never
done indoor track, and I thought for indoor track,
well, you trained indoors. Apparently not.
Unfortunately for my teammates, I've found that it
helps to whine. I'm toughening up, though. I definitely was shocked when snow was predicted for our final
cross-country meet and there was no possibility of it
being cancelled. Now, freezing rain, ha, not a problem.
Seriously though, the team made the transition really

exciting, not that running repeats isn't exciting in

itself.
JFC: Do you have any pre-race rituals?
CR: I always have to retie my spikes before a race.
Once, they were so tight that I got that feeling of pins
and needles in my feet the whole race, but I still like
them tight. When I was in high school, I would listen
to Sublime on the bus ride to each meet, but I've
moved on now. Still, I need to pick a song to play in my
head each race. For some reason, that was "Carol of
the Bells" for Conferences, and I think the rhythm
worked really well.

"Coming from California, I've never
done indoor track, and I thought
for indoor track, well, you trained
indoors. Apparently not."
Caitlin Russell 'll
JFC: What aspect do you miss the most about being
home?
CR: I miss running with my dad, and my parents’
cooking. I really like to bake desserts (and eat them),
and it’s just a lot more difficult to find adequate supplies and time here. The bay area weather is definitely pretty nice, too. Overall, it’s the people my family
and friends but I’ve just learned to not take it for
granted when I’m back.
-

-

JFC: What’s your favorite food?
CR: I’m a bit obsessed with food, so this is a hard

easy.
My high

school team wasn't the most serious, and

here, much like it is in classes, you don't feel weird for
wanting to work hard. Everyone is just really enthusiastic, too. Before Conferences, our lockers would be
filled each day with little surprises. There's a few girls
that really go all out. It made coming each day so

question. Because this is supposed to be pertinent to

track, I’ll say that my favorite post-race food is cold
watermelon. I’m always up for ice cream, though, and
nothing beats a chocolate chip cookie right out of the
oven.

Garnet women drop two to Mules and Bullets, look to rebound
BY LAUREN WALKER

lwalkerl@swarthmore.edu

The women's basketball team fell short in two hardfought battles this week. Last Wednesday, they took on
the Mules of Muhlenberg College at home in Tarble
Pavilion, and on Saturday they traveled to Gettysburg
College to face theBullets in Bream Gym.
Unfortunately, neither fight resulted in a win, bringing the Garnet's record to 3-13 in conference and 6-16

overall.
The Garnet started the game against Muhlenberg on a
high note, taking an early 9-5 lead, but the Mules quickly regrouped and answered back, going ahead 11-9 with
about 15 minutes left in the half. The Mules held the lead
for the remainder of the half, extending the margin to as
many as 15 points.

"Something that really hindered us
was our free throw percentage we
were 41 percent from the charity
stripe, and that prevented us from
really making a solid run."
Melissa Grisby 'O9

...

...

Muhlenberg's strong shooting ability greatly con-

tributed to their ability to rack up the points. "We had a
tough time stopping their outside shooters," said stand-

out Kathryn Stockbower 'IL In the second half, the Mules
maintained the pressure, continuing to hold the lead and
finishing the game with a 20 point margin of victory as
they defeated the Garnet women 77-57.
Despite the loss, there were once again several
impressive performances by the Garnet. Stockbower continued to own the boards for Swarthmore, bringing in
her 18th double-double of the season, solidifying her spot
at the top of the Centennial Conference in that category.
She finished the game with 12 points and 11 rebounds.
Captain Pam Costello 'lO scored a season high 16
points, while also tallying three assists and five
rebounds.
Captain Karen Berk 'OB also had an impressive game,
bringing down seven rebounds and contributing 11
points. Summer Miller-Walfish 'll, who currently leads
the conference in blocked shots, stuffed two more opponents on Wednesday, bringing her season total to 44
blocks. This feat is enough to tie the school record held
by Berk.
On Saturday, the Garnet hoped to bounce back from
the Wednesday defeat, but after another hard-fought battle, came up short against the Bullets, 84-72. It was a closer game than the final scoreboard suggested.
The Garnet's abnormally low free-throw percentage
was an important factor in the loss. Coach Renee
DeVarney thought the team played well, however:
"Against Gettysburg we played a pretty good game overall
we just killed ourselves with our missed free
throws. We lost by 12 points and missed 17 free throws in
the game. Free throw shooting is usually a strength for
us."
Melissa Grigsby 'O9 agreed that the team played a
good game, but that the missed foul shots were a huge

Over the past week the Swarthmore men's
basketball team has been getting busy on the
dominating visiting Muhlenberg
College on Feb. 13 and then giving
Gettysburg, the number two team in the
Centennial Conference, a tough game on Feb.
16. As Steve Wolf 'OB said, "We played two
good games. Even though it's a bit late in the
season, we're really starting to develop as a

court,

team."
The Muhlenberg game, which ended with
a 72-57 Swarthmore triumph, was a shining
example of this developing team unity. As lan
McCormick 'OB and Raul Ordonez 'O9 dominated the glass, pulling down 15 and 13
rebounds respectively, Sam Lacy 11 kept the
Mules on their toes with his pressure and

hustle.

"We played two good
games. Even though it's a
bit late in the season, we're
really starting to develop as
a team."
Steve Wolf 'OB
A close game at halftime (33-31
Muhlenberg), the Garnet men came out of the
locker room ready to play, hitting key shots
from both the inside and the outside. Along
with their impressive shooting, the guards
played their part by keeping the turnovers
down, resulting in the second lowest team
turnover total this season.
Lacy described the rousing win, saying,
"We came out intense and stayed intense for
THE PHOENIX

forty minutes, which we haven't done all season."
While the Gettysburg game was a tough
loss, it was also one for the record books.

McCormick broke the school record for
career rebounds, surpassing the mark set by
Rob Ruffin '92 of 768. McCormick now has 770
and counting.

"We came out intense and
stayed intense."
Sam Lacy 'll
He currently holds numerous school
records, including career blocks, blocks in
season, as well as his new career rebound
record to go along with his superb outside
shooting, all the more impressive in light of
his center position.
Saturday was also a big scoring day for
Matt Kurman 'OB, second only to McCormick
in total points for the team. Ordonez had yet
another terrific rebounding game as the men
battled the Bullets. Unfortunately, despite
their valiant efforts, the Swarthmore men
had a tough time getting the ball in the basket. "The effort was there. We just couldn't

Coming off of these great efforts, the
Garnet men are getting geared up for their
last game of the season. "We're looking forward to smashing Haverford this Saturday
around 4-ish," says forward Matt Turner 10.

factor. "In the Gettysburg game, we hung with them for
most of the game. We were only down by seven and we
matched their offensive pace. Something that really hindered us, however, was our free throw percentage. As a
team we were 41 percent from the charity stripe, and that
prevented us from really making a solid run."
Grigsby tallied a season high of 14 points, including a
long half-court shot to end the first half. "It's the longest
shot I've ever seen made in my 20 years of coaching!"
said DeVarney. "It gave us great momentum going into
the second hah."
The game also brought yet another outstanding performance from Stockbower, who raked in another dou-

ble-double (her 19th), with team-high 19 points and 12

rebounds. Berk also tallied 14 points for the Garnet, and
she brought down eight rebounds.
The two games, although neither were official wins,
brought with them their own small victories for
Swarthmore. The team was successfully able to minimize
turnovers, and, according to Berk, "the team has really
been focused on cutting down the opponents' offensive
rebounds" and "making smarter decisions on offense."
The team was able to do these things much better in the
games this past week.
The Garnet is playing the final week of the season
with confidence. They played at Washington College last
night, but the finish was too late for this printing. They
will play against Haverford College at home on Saturday
for their final conference game and Senior Day.
"I think we all would like to finish the season on a
high note," said Stockbower. "Washington and Haverford
are both beatable teams, but we are going to have to
come out and play our best if we want to end up with victories."

Basketball teams Think
Pink to raise awareness

The
team,
men's
basketball
Dickinson College's women's and
men's teams, as well as gameday officials joined the Swarthmore women's
basketball team as they participated in
the Women's Basketball Coaching
Association's "Think Pink" week on
Feb. 9.
"Think Pink" week was created in
2007 to raise breast cancer awareness
in women's basketball, as well as on

campuses and in communities. Their
mission is to create "a global, unified
effort for the WBCA nation of coaches
to assist in raising breast cancer
awareness on the court, across campuses, in communities and beyond."
This year over 900 teams nationally
participated in the time spanning Feb.
8-17. Referees joined the initiative with
their own "Calling for a Cure" campaign, in which all NCAA Women's
officials blew pink whistles to signify

their commitment to the cause.
"As female athletes ourselves, we
felt that the least we could do was to
support the 'Think Pink' initiative in
whatever way possible. We wore pink
warm-up t-shirts, pink shoelaces and
sweatbands, and the referees had pink
whistles," explained Karen Berk 'OB.
Dickinson players also willingly
joined in with the Swarthmore team to
express their dedication to the cause.
"It was honestly very nice to be able to
unite with Dickinson for the 'Think
Pink' initiative," Berk added.
Prior to the game, the Swarthmore
captains read information about breast
cancer to teams and fans. "For a brief
moment before the game, we were not
standing on the sideline as two oppos-

ing teams," recalled Berk.
Pam
Costello 'lO added, "I think this is
important because it really puts sports
in perspective. We were easily able to
put our rivalry aside and focus on
something much bigger than basketball."
"The statistics about breast cancer
that were read by our captains before
the game hit extremely close to home
one in three women will have breast
cancer so that means that probably two
of our teammates will be faced with it
during their lifetimes. When you think
of it in those terms, it really makes you
think about the gravity of the situation," explained Kristen Traband 'OB.
The men's teams also showed their
support for the initiative by wearing
pink shirts. "It was great that the men's
teams joined us. Breast cancer isn't a
disease that affects just women
millions of men are affected when their
mothers, wives, girlfriends, sisters and
friends are diagnosed, so it's important
that everyone, not just women show
their support in finding a cure for the
disease," said Traband.

Concession proceeds from the doubleheader went to the Kay Yow/WBCA

Cancer Fund, contributing over three
hundred dollars to the cause.
All of the teams are looking forward
to participating in "Think Pink" week
again next year. "I am hoping we can
further our involvement next year,"
explained Costello. "At the rate the program is expanding, I am sure numerous

other college sports teams, not just

women's basketball teams, will join the
program."

Though matches themselves are intense,
the atmosphere surrounding them is
peaceful.

Swarthmore Badminton triumphed
over Haverford College on Tuesday, Feb.

The role of the coaches is very different than in other sports as well.

19.

According to Armstrong, Swarthmore
coach Bhavin Parikh tends to be hands-off
during matches, giving pointers when
necessary, but typically saving most
instruction for practices.
Badminton games are played to 21
points, and a match is won by taking two
out of three games. A team can only earn
a point on its own serve, and the serve
goes to whoever won the previous point.
There are singles and doubles matches,
with slight rules changes accordingly.
At Swarthmore, only women's badminton is varsity; when men do play
women, it is counted as an exhibition
match, with the women earning the
default win.
This is often the case, as it was on
Tuesday night, since Robert Manduca 'lO
and Armstrong were the only players on
the men's team, and Haverford came to

For those of you who have never
attended a Badminton match, perhaps a
few words about the sport are in order.
A badminton match is, in many ways,

strikingly different from other athletic
events. There are no referees or line
judges, so players are relied on to make
close calls. As a result, as Kim Kramer 'lO
points out, players are very honest and
easy-going.

In contrast to other sporting events,
badminton players extend exceptional
levels of cordiality and camaraderie

match between Cole Armstrong 'lO and
Alex Warres of Haverford was peppered
with remarks like "nice shot" after a wellplaced return.

"Pressure on us comes
from ourselves, not outside
sources."

Kramer thinks this is partly explained
the
lack of physical
contact.

Badminton matches are quiet, with little
to be heard other than whizzing shuttlecocks and casual sideline conversation.

the Lamb Miller Field House with four
men in tow.
The lack of men on the team is difficult, Manduca said, because he and Cole
play against each other a lot. They play at
"about the same level," and it is difficult
to move forward because of the lack of
variety in their practicing environment.
Most of the men they play, Manduca said,
"are really, really good." Still, he won both
matches on Tuesday, a result with which
he was very pleased.
When asked for comment, Armstrong
said, "I have to get back to the court now."

It's a good thing he did, because
Armstrong won both matches easily, dominating by scores of 21-3 and 21-5.
Unfortunately for the Garnet, since he
was playing a woman, the win ultimately
went to Haverford. "In other words,"
Xiang said, though Armstrong appeared
to be dominating, "he is actually losing."
Armstrong said that though this particular match was not competitive, he
finds that closer matches can get very
intense, even if they are just exhibitions.
The character of a match largely
depends on the players in it, for as
Armstrong said, "Pressure on us comes

from ourselves, not outside sources."
Kim Kramer 'lO, who won both of her
sets, said the team has been doing "more
footwork recently, [which] was helping."
Though it was "really hard," Kramer
noticed a difference.
The work focused on making the steps
of a match automatic and increasing agility, and the hard practice definitely
appears to be paying off in the team's
matches.
At the moment, Kramer is ranked in
the top 20 in women's badminton in the
country (among adults, not collegiate
players). Though she added the caveat
that ranking is dependent on attending
specified ranking tournaments, she is

still one of the most competitive players
in the nation.
Kramer is excited for National
Collegiate Championships, which will be
hosted by Swarthmore from March 21-23.
If you have never been to a badminton
match, Kramer recommends going to this
one, as the quality of play, especially in

2% 2008

the final stages, should prove to be excellent and exciting.
Highly competitive teams like UC
Berkeley and Stanford University will be
attending, and many of the nation's top
ranked players will compete.

look forward to. It's going

said.

A year ago, Kramer was the women's
singles champion at the 2007 Northeast
Collegiate Badminton Tournament; perhaps similar success awaits her, as well
as standout Maithili Paraikh 'll, at this
year's competion.
Alice Xiang 'lO calls the team "really
supportive." This is essential on a team
that is comprised of people of many different skill levels. Alice started as a firstyear and it helped her to have a supportive network.
This network has helped greatly in the
development of a strong core for

Swarthmore's new and improving bad-

minton team.
