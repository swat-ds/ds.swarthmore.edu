Many drivers fail
tougher van test
BY MARY MINTEL AND SUE CHEN
mmintell@swarthmore.edu and schenl@swarthmore.edu
Students living off campus will be getting exercise on a few mornings before break.
The morning shuttle is now running on a limited schedule due to a lack of drivers, and
the problem may spread to other van services.
The movie shuttle is still running regularly, but the Target shuttles are not running,
and van coordinator Joe Alberti 'O6 is not sure if its services will return after break.
These gaps are due to a decrease in the number ofavailable drivers. Some student drivers have failed recent van re-certification tests and are no longer eligible to drive.
"Failing just one or two people has caused a huge lapse in service,"Alberti said.
Alberti is concerned about this trend but said the loss of shuttle services was not

Cohen put it, “there was a big boom and things went flying.” The window, already
out of its frame, had been balanced on the sill. High winds pushed it off its precarious perch. Even though the two DJs were sitting close to the window, both escaped
unharmed. “We’re fine,” Ferrell said, “which is kind of miraculous.” Public Safety
quickly arrived to clean up, and the window has since been boarded up.

Swarthmore has been infected again by
the latest incarnation of the MyDoom worm,
which infiltrated the network last week
because some students had not updated their
virus-scanning software.
A scan run by Information Technology
Services discovered the worm on the network while searching for a file associated
with the virus, ITS Networking and Systems

was able to block the ports of the infected
users to keep them from infecting other com-

pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

Manager Mark Dumic said.
ITS found 16 student computers with the
characteristics of Netsky.B, the newest form
of the MyDoom worm, according to Client

Services Manager Robin Jacobsen. The
worm spreads by forwarding itself through
e-mails.
"We're not sure why a handful of students
did not have the updated definitions for the
virus scan," Jacobsen said, but "it could be
because people haven't installed the virus
scan."
The problem of inadequate virus protection has been a problem for the Swarthmore
network before. When the MyDoom virus
first hit the network several weeks ago,
many were vulnerable to infection because
they did not have virus-protection software
that could accept ITS's new virus definition,
which would recognize MyDoom.
"We expect that most of [the infected com-

puters, according to Jacobsen.
To remedy the issue of non-protected
computers, ITS has developed a plan of placing the unprotected computers on a quarantine VLAN, which is a network specially separated from the main Swarthmore network,
according to Jacobsen.
It would work specifically as a "self-service" station at which students could only
download virus protection and register on
the network before gaining access back to
the main network.
Jacobsen said she expected ITS to implement the quarantine VLAN after spring

break.

An additional problem with the virus was
that it could not be stopped at the e-mail

server level.

Even though there are filters in place on
the Swarthmore e-mail servers that should
stop viruses, the Netsky virus was able to
slip through because it was packaged as a
corrupt zip file, Jacobsen said.
To get back onto the network, the 16 students who have been blocked from the network must contact a dorm consultant, who
will purge the virus from their computer

indicative of overall incompetence. At this time, there are still enough certified students to work as evening shuttle drivers. "[The evening service] is still running fine
with no interruption in service at all," he said.
But Evening Shuttle Coordinator Lesley Goodman 'O6 said she feared this might
change. She said there were gaps in the schedule and that a number of her drivers had
failed the new test.
"We lose another driver every few weeks," she said. "I've had some really hard
weeks with the scheduling."
Goodman said the drivers were being tested on maneuvers and circumstances some
of them have never encountered before. "They're fine drivers in normal circumstances, and then they fail this test," she said.
Students are tested on highway driving and parallel parking, a skill Goodman herself had trouble with when she took the test last week. "It's so hard to parallel park a
gigantic van," she said.
Aaron Hollander 'O7, an evening van driver, said the new test "was a lot harder"
than the old test, which "just involved driving
there weren't any special skills

involved."
Hollander said he "passed by a very small margin" and had lost most of his points
on the highway for "laws I've never heard of." For instance, he lost points for stopping
at a yellow light. Alberti told him that momentum of the van could cause it to roll
through the intersection at the stop.
Hollander said he had not found the test completely unfair but was nevertheless
concerned. "It's probably a good thing that's being done, but it's just a major inconvenience that we're firing so many people, particularly with the evening shuttle," he

said.

Despite these complaints, Alberti has no plans to make the test more lenient. He
refuses "to let people pass when they're not good drivers."
Four van accidents occurred last semester. The damage totaled to $4,000, half of

which came from the student activities budget, Alberti said.
"It's ridiculous we're taking money away from campus activities to pay for accidents," he said.
Alberti, along with Vice President Larry Schall '75 and Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave, decided the college needed to revamp its certification requirements.
Over winter break, Alberti designed this "much more comprehensive test" based on
the one used by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to certify state drivers. He said he felt that the old certification test was "a joke" and hoped the new test
will "prevent drivers that shouldn't be driving the vans from driving them."
Public Safety is not involved with testing the drivers, according to Redgrave.
Alberti said that because it only has one officer on duty during the date, Public Safety
does not have time to administer the test. Instead, Alberti, who underwent comprehensive training over break, is the examiner.
Unlike the old test, which lasted 10 minutes, the new test lasts an hour, during
which drivers practice with Alberti for 45 minutes before the test begins.
Drivers can fail the test for any of four reasons: accidents, serious violations, dangerous actions or losing more than 30 points for mistakes made during the test. Every
action is worth a certain number of points. For example, failing to signal would result
in a reduction of 10 points.
Alberti has been testing and re-certifying drivers since the third week of classes.
"The first week that we did it we had a 57 percent pass rate," he said. "People are definitely failing."
"I've encountered a lot of people who don't know how to drive," he said.
Those who fail usually take it well, although there have been a few arguments. "I
don't feel I was unreasonable," Alberti said. "It's hard to tell a Swattie that they've
failed at something. People here have this mentality that they're really good at everything they do."
Zach Weintraub 'O6, who failed the test, disagreed. "I though it was ridiculous," he
said. "It was much, much harsher than the DMV license test."

Poli sci to hire Middle East prof
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN

akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

The political science department plans to hire a
temporary Middle East specialist for the spring 2005
semester.
Last week, a candidate for the position came to
Swarthmore to present his dissertation comparing
India and Egypt's uses of religion to mobilize public
support and how they backfired when extremists
employed the same strategies.
"I was very impressed. He presented materials
clearly, seems like a nice guy and was engaging. He
was factual and wasn't engaging in ideological politics," Ben Schwartz 'O6 said.
The department offers no classes on the Middle
East. As of 2003, courses that would count toward an
Islamic cultural studies minor were offered by the

Christina Procacci Phoenix Staff

Under the stricter van certification guidelines, many drivers, including
Jason Lee, right, failed the test.

Stricter van test leaves
gap in shuttle services

history, religion and sociology and anthropology
departments, The Phoenix reported last year.
"The college's campaign is to strengthen its offerings in this area. The provost's office provided us
with this opportunity, one our department decided
to accept and follow up on," political science department chair Tyrene White said.
"Al Bloom and I agreed that developing coverage
here [in Middle East studies] was appropriate both
in light of the international situation and as a complement to other curricular developments involving
Islamic civilization," Provost Connie Hungerford
said in an e-mail.
"Political science is short of course offerings [in
spring 2005], especially in international relations,

because of Professor [James] Kurth's leave,"
Hungerford said.
The temporary professor would teach two sec-

tions of International Politics, according to
Hungerford.
Because the hiring process is in the final rounds
of decision-making as the department is considering

its offer, no information about the candidate could

be released.
However, according to political science professor
Raymond Hopkins, the department is likely to offer
the candidate the position.
"The candidate was quite attractive for a variety
of reasons. I'm hopeful we'll make the offer and it'll
be accepted in the next 24 hours," he said.
Some students said they thought that, without
the field of Middle East studies, the department was
missing a crucial aspect of global politics.

"[The political science department] is long over-

due for this position. We have specialists on" Asia,
Africa and Latin America. The last few wars the
United States has been involved in have been in the
Middle East, and this will probably be the location
of the next few," Schwartz said.
Honors political science major Carla Humud 'O5
agreed. "In general, the department needs someone
to fill that area. There is a huge gap in the political

science and history department," she said.
"The closest options are classes on Islam in the
religion department, but not having accompanying
politics or history classes is like saying by having
a class on Christianity you don't need one on
American history or politics," Humud said.

From VAN TEST, pg 3
During the test, Weintraub thought he was "doing wonderfully"
until he arrived back on campus and Alberti informed him that he

failed. Weintraub lost five points for not using a turn signal in the
Dupont parking lot, 15 points for going 5 miles over the speed limit on
Baltimore Pike and five points for another minor infraction.
Weintraub also lost 10 points for a law he said he "can't find anywhere," when he "turned into a left-turn-only lane and didn't immediately get into the right lane." He said there had been traffic in the
right lane, preventing him from moving over, and was told by Alberti
that this was fine for him to do, even though he eventually lost points

for it.
Alberti said he believed students who argued that the test was
unfair were just angered by its difficulty, which he believes is necessary. "Sure, the test is hard. Driving vans is a difficult task," he said.
But "if you know how to drive, and you understand the maneuvers,
you can pass it."
Others felt making drivers take the test in the middle of the semester is bad timing. "I think it's kind of messed up
to throw it right
in the middle when programs are active. It's a real hassle," Jason Lee
'O6, who failed his test, said. Lee drove for the Chinatown tutorial program, which will not be able to go into Philadelphia today because it
no longer has a certified driver.
Alberti is re-certifying students in reverse class order and expects
to be done with the sophomores by the week after spring break. This
may occur sooner if current drivers decide not to attempt the re-certification five decided against it last week. According to Hollander,
students can retake the test "almost immediately" if they fail.

BY CHRISTINA TEMES

ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

Beginning with the fall 2004 semester,
the college will begin to offer a dining
plan with five meals per week for students living off campus.
The five meals can be used any day of
the week but only for lunch, Director of
Dining Services Linda McDougall said.
It will cost students around $325 for
the 14-week plan, which is about 50 cents
cheaper than paying for each lunch.
Students are asked to pay for the plan
in advance through the Dining Services

office.

McDougall was approached by Student
Council Campus Life Representative
Heidi Fieselmann 'O6 about the plan three

weeks ago.

"Student
Council was getting
requests about different meal plan
options, and I think this stemmed from
that," she said. The five-meal plan "was
the compromise."

McDougall, the plan received approval
from the administration, Fieselmann
said.
It was designed to decrease the cost of
meals for off-campus students who eat
regularly at the college.
"Something I've personally seen is

the plan is something nice for

"I know I personally wouldn't use the
plan, because I have enough friends who
will swipe me in. But I think it's still a
good idea generally." Adrienne Mackey
'O4, an off-campus student, said.
"The idea in principle of a smaller
meal plan for students living off campus
is good, but if it's only five meals a week
and not that much of a financial advantage, it's not that great," said Aaron

'50 First Dates' not good enough for one
BY EVA HOLMAN
eholman2@swarthmore.edu
An Adam Sandler movie
always stirs up excitement, luring

us to theaters with images of
"Gap girls" and angry hockey-

dancing
players-turned-golfers
through our heads. Whether or
not one likes Adam Sandler, his
utter willingness to relinquish
dignity in exchange for laughs is
legendary.
But
somewhere
between "The Wedding Singer"
and "50 First Dates," Sandler
movies have turned from hilarious slapsticks to semi-solemn
ones that want to be taken
seriously.
Well, sort of seriously.
Though "50 First Dates" satisfies our craving for a second love
story between Adam Sandler and
Drew Barrymore, the clumsy vacillation between drama and the
very basest of humor weakens
this ambitious new film.
The premise is: Adam Sandler
is Henry Roth, a sea veterinarian in Hawaii who has a way with
the ladies and a fear of commitment. Drew Barrymore is Lucy,
who has lost her short-term
memory after a car crash on her
father's birthday. When Henry
finds out about Lucy's condition,
he realizes that the one woman
he
wants
to
commit to is the one who re-forgets his existence every day.
According to the expert medical
opinion of "50 First Dates," this
means her existence is now a
cross between "Memento" and
"Groundhog Day." She is doomed

to repeat the same actions every
day for the rest of her life, right
down to her compulsive Waffle
Houses and donning of a pink
shirt. The movie's portrayal of
short-term memory loss is hardly realistic. But then, considering that every character in the
movie wears Hawaiian shirts,
realism does not seem to be
Sandler's main concern.
Where Adam Sandler's humor

used to be hilarious slapstick, it
is now joke after unfunny joke

groups that
don't fit into society's norm. A
slew of them were directed
toward Alexa, his androgynous
assistant, whose purpose in the
movie seems solely to reinforce
Henry's masculinity. Without
him, Sandler would have no
opportunity to say, "Dude, I'm
not into guys!" as he burlily
protests after Alexa comes onto
him. Of course, one could argue
that his other purpose is to tell
Henry he "prefers sausage to
taco" in a sly apology. Natives,
cross-dressers and short-term
memory loss sufferers also fall
prey to jokes by Sandler. It seems
that, instead of making himself
the butt of the deliciously selfdeprecating situations that peppered his older movies, Sandler
would rather point out the lack of
targeting various

normalcy in others
and make
many,
many walrus-as-penis
jokes.

Faking your homework is an intricate and multifaceted
problem. Faking a WA copy, for example, is very different
from faking questions for the Resume Blitz in order to get
free pizza. For my own convenience, I have narrowed the
field down to an area in which I have done recent research:

2. Skim through your notes or the textbook to find
an equation or statement that contains at least one of
the words in the question. Not the most relevant one,
the first one. If you can't find anything in 30 seconds,
open the textbook to a random place and write down the
first official-looking sentence you find. Not only will you
look obscure and intellectual, but if it's from a chapter
you haven't covered, the professor will think you read the
textbook for fun. Luckily, a cursory search turns up a

theorem:
"(Second Sylow Theorem): Let PI and P2 be Sylow psubgroups of a finite group G. Then PI and P2 are conjugate subgroups of G."
3. Change the statement somehow, either by reordering or restating the phrases. This shows you
understand the equation well enough to manipulate it and
you aren't just copying it down. Write out every step to
take up more room. This will make you seem conscien-

tious and detail-oriented:
"Drawing from the well-known Second Sylow
Theorem, we can characterize G as a group of p-subgroup
composition. Continuing our examination, we find the psubgroups to be PI and P2. It is these findings that lead us

to the finite nature of G."
4. Finally, write an answer that relates to the statement. If you really have no idea, restate the statement,
then say, "therefore" and make up an answer. This will
take up even more precious space. (Bonus: The professor
will think you are trying hard to conceptually understand
the equation.)
"When comparing p-subgroups g and P, we cannot
ignore the Second Sylow Theorem. As the Theorem suggests, p-subgroups PI and P2 are conjugate; therefore,
they can be conjugated into the super-group P. We have
now proven that P is a sum of two p-subgroups; it must
follow that P is bigger than g, which is only one p-subgroup.
"QED, gHg-1 £ P."
And there you have it: a full-fledged answer that, upon
first glance, appears reasonable and even scholarly, without wasting any time trying to comprehend the material at
hand. Now you can get back to important matters. Jordan

MUSIC REVIEWS

"meet next life"

(morr music, 2004)

IDM is elusive. The name itself is the most notoriously laughable genre descriptor in modern music
the first two letters stand for "intelligent" (presumptuous, self-limiting, meaningless) and 'dance" (for the
most part, blatantly and ontologically false). Their
only contentful connotation is that this is electronically based music, which is appropriate enough. The
use of electronics for creating
and manipulating sound is

in the genre,
besides a tendency for non-danceability and occasionally willful
unobtrusiveness (hence the term "ambient," which
was at one point essentially synonymous with IDM
but has been out of vogue since Moby's misappropriation).

This kind of music the work of folks like Boards
of Canada, Mouse on Mars, Mum, Nobukazu
Takemura and Manitoba, to give examples from
Scotland, Germany, Iceland, Japan and Canada
has a characteristic elusiveness, at least for me. I
sometimesfind that my reactions to albums by these
artists vary substantially from listen to listen, so that
a record that had struck me as remarkably beautiful
would on rehearing seem, well, nice enough but perhaps rather dull.
That makes albums in this style difficult to
endorse unequivocally and makes me hesitant to recommend "meet next life," the undeniably gorgeous
new record by English IDM duo ISAN, as glowingly
as I intuitively feel I should. I can say, perhaps objectively, that the group belies its mechanical moniker
(it's an acronym for "integrated services analogue
network," or something equally banal) with the gentle warmth and approachability of its music. From a
broad but cohesive palette built around analog synthesizers and an array of percussive sounds including bells, clicks, whirrs, rattles, gurgles and other
onomatopoeia, each track offers a constituted balance between drone, melody and rhythmic elements.
Stylistically reminiscent of the artists I mentioned
above, though the more idiosyncratic and perhaps
forward-looking elements of each, "meet next life"
serves in some ways as a summing up of the directions that melodic ambient electronica has taken in
the last seven years
or so, from the childlike playfulness of
"Willowy" to the

sense that a few of these pieces recall the mid-to-late
'9os era, before IDM had been fully liberated from
drum loops. And, as with many of this ilk, a number of tracks might be criticized for a lack of a discernable compositional structure. But these are
quibbling complaints. The goal here is neither stylistic innovation nor formal songsmithing, but
rather the construction of sonically interesting
mood pieces. Due to the benignity of the moods

feels incongruous to describe this music as profound, but there can indeed be a marked, quiet depth

more months of listening, as well as corroboration
from other listeners, to determine whether "meet

'Manet and the Sea' comes to Philly
BY CLAIRE RUUD
cruudl@swarthmore.edu
Whether you've never been to the art museum or you're
a member and regular visitor (props to you), now is a great
time to make the trip. "Manet and the Sea" is on display at
the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The blockbuster exhibition on the seascapes of Manet and his contemporaries
opened two weekends ago to huge audiences. I visited the
museum last Saturday and enjoyed myself in spite of the
crowds. (Most of the people there were either more than
twice or less than half my age, an observation that reminded me how inexcusably we college students are neglecting
our cultural education.) All that stands between you and
the museum's worthy collection is a $7.50 train fare, a 30minute ride to Suburban Station, and a refreshing 20minute walk down the Parkway to the museum.
"Manet and the Sea" attempts to give us a new angle on
Manet's body of work through his seascapes. The catalog
for the show counts 40 of Manet's 400 paintings as
"seascapes," including images of boats, open sea, harbors
and beach-goers. Combined with a number of sketchbooks
filled with watercolors and pencil drawings, the curators
claim that the subject of the sea has been egregiously overlooked within Manet's oeuvre.
Edouard Manet (1832-83) shook up the French Academy
of Art in 1863 when he, Gustave Courbet and other painters
whose work the Academy had rejected from the 1863 Salon
mounted their own show, the "Salon des Refuses," in
revolt. At that time, Romanticism was the conventional
style in the Academy, following in the footsteps of artists
like Delacroix and Gericault.
Manet is best known for his paintings that parodied
Romantic mythological subjects and replaced them with
scenes from everyday modern urban life. For example, in
"Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe" (1863), Manet parodied paradisiacal images of nymphs bathing and frolicking in nature by

painting two men clothed in bourgeois suits and hats picnicking in the park with two nude women. In "Olympia,"
(1863), Manet took the traditional paintings of the nude
Venus and replaced her with a modern-day prostitute,
lying on her bed, staring out at the viewer. These paintings
upset the art establishment in France because they depicted modern life instead of myths and critiqued traditional
artistic themes and motifs.
"Manet and the Sea" shows us a much less rebellious
and much more bourgeois side of Manet. Most of his paintings and sketches of seascapes were conceived during time
he spent in the seaside resort towns of Boulogne, Arachon
and Berck. His extended vacations from Paris to these

towns are a sign of his bourgeois status. The curators have
created a virtual copy of a pocket-sized sketchbook from
one of his trips. As you leaf through it on a touch-sensitive
computer screen, you imagine Manet wandering the
beaches leisurely and painting as a diversion, not out of
political conviction. His work

seems much less socially
motivated and much more personal and decorative.
Manet's seascapes contain some of the same social commentaries as his other works. His first and last seascapes
both deal with political events. The first is "Battle of the
USS 'Kearsarge' and the CSS 'Alabama,' June 19, 1864,"
which depicts a battle fought during the American Civil
War off the coast of France. The event received a lot of
media attention, and by late July Manet was already displaying his painting in a gallery window. He may have
been riding the wave of public appeal, but the catalog suggests that this picture is politically motivated. Manet was
a staunch anti-Bonapartist. The emperor backed the
Confederates during the Civil War. For Manet, the defeat of
the Confederates, allies of the emperor, in this battle may

have symbolized the defeat of the Napoleonic Empire.
Similarly, the last seascape Manet painted was a

romantic reconstruction of the escape of a radical political
journalist from the penal colony to which the emperor had
sent him. This painting, "The Escape of Rochefort'"
(1880-81), demonstrates again Manet's revolutionary sym-

pathies.

The curators of this exhibition, however, are more
interested in the artistic influences of Manet and his contemporaries on one another than on Manet's politics. Each
of about 10 other artists, including Courbet, Whistler.
Monet, Morisot and Renoir, has between half a dozen and
a dozen seascapes in the show and receives an article in
the catalog. The curators and scholars compare and contrast each artist's work with Manet's to conjecture how the
pair learned from one another. This angle emphasizes the
vacations the artists took together, correspondences they
kept, and their concentration on style over content.
Disappointingly, the artists, Manet included, seem like
members of a bourgeois social club and not politically or
socially radical except in the most urbane way.

Good grief, played out on the big stage
BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu

Kathy Liu 'O4 first heard the
music to "You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown" back in 1999, when
she was a junior in high school. "I
thought it was the funniest, most
unexpectedly
intelligent
show
around," she recalled. She never
expected to put it on herself, but
when she decided this fall to direct a
musical, it seemed a logical choice.
"Big musicals just aren't possible here, because of the level of commitment they require," she said.
With a cast of six, "Charlie Brown"
was small enough to be manageable

but still a popular show. Liu
obtained funding from Drama
Board and set up auditions for the

beginning of the semester.

"It's tough to find space
to practice in that's
real. So far, it's been
mostly classrooms,
lobbies and hallways."
Allen Frost 'O4
Those involved agreed that things

were coming along well for the show.
"The six of us have been working
really hard, and we still have a long
way to go," Catharine Parnell 'O6,

who plays Lucy, said. "I almost don't
want to say so, because lots of people
think it's bad luck, but I think we're
in a really good place right now."
Starting this week, the cast will

be going off-book for the first time.

"We're only just starting to combine
everybody,
putting everything
together," Allen Frost 'O4, who plays

Schroeder, said.
"I think it's going great," Liu
added. "The actors are brilliant; it's
a really great group of people to
work with. We're going to start really pushing this week." So far,

according to Liu, the biggest difficulties have been technical, mostly
trying to find space to rehearse.
Though "Charlie Brown" is a mainstage show and will go up on the
LPAC stage, the cast has yet to
rehearse in that space, because
other groups are also using it.
"It's tough to find space to practice in that's real," Frost said. "So
far, it's been mostly classrooms, lobbies and hallways."
According to Parnell, "Charlie"
Brown" is a real challenge for the
actors. "It's hard doing this show,"
she said. "The characters are pretty
much predetermined, so there's not

much room for the actors

site tickling, punching, laughing,
food stealing, blanket borrowing."
Though Liu said she was "a little
scared about how the audience is
going to take it here," most everyone
is enthusiastic about the play itself.
"It's really difficult, because
there's no real narrative. It doesn't
tell a story, per se," Frost said. The
show, as he described it, consists of
a series of short sketches, which he

called "uproariously funny."
"There's a combination of adult
humor and 7-year-old joie de vivre,"
Parnell said. "It's going to sound
trite, but I think there's a lot to be
said for going back and looking at

childhood in a different way."
Musical director Emery Ku 'O5
said he believed the audience would
be able to connect with what it saw
on stage. "I don't know about you,
but I grew up reading Peanuts," he
said. "I think everyone has a personal relationship with the characters."
For Ku, the show's music defies

description. "The music is incredible," he said. "There aren't any really good adjectives for it. It's sort of
modern, sort of pop-ish, sort of jazzy.
The music sort of typifies each
character, really brings out
their personality traits."
Frost described it as
running the gamut
from vaudeville to
blues. "It's all in
there," he said.
Though the orchestra parts haven't
come yet, Ku said
he expected them to
arrive this week. As
Parnell put it, "It's nice
to be a kid again."

BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART

Last Friday, a handful of
Swarthmore students had the
opportunity to do a read-through
of writer William Strauss's new
musical, "Anasazi." Kathy Liu 'O4,
Emily Gasser 'O7 and Eric Glover
'O7 coordinated the event.

The actors sat down with him,
copies of his script, and his 139minute score on CD. They read

through the script for three
hours, playing the songs at necessary intervals, then discussed the

and weaknesses of the
musical afterwards. "The exercise was mostly for the writer,"
Liu said. "He wanted to see if the
music matched the script."

about the musical's success in a

"I thought the reading went

me to make a few minor changes
in the story and dialogue,"
Strauss said in an e-mail. "If all
goes well, a large regional theater
somewhere in the U.S. will present 'Anasazi' sometime within the
next year. We'll see what happens."
The complex story took five
years of preparation and study.
"The idea came from a book I
wrote in 1997 with Neil Howe
called 'The Fourth Turning,'
Strauss said. "It's a book about
the cycles of history and seasons

Strauss strove for authenticity
in all aspects of the musical,
working with composer Peter

Strauss said. "Any musical is only

Dean Bob Gross about having students read the script. Gross
passed the word to Drama Board,
and Liu found out about the
opportunity. Along with Gasser
and Glover, she assembled a cast
that included herself, Glover, Phil
Katz 'O7, Allen Frost 'O4, Ryan
Budish 'O4, Becky Strauss 'O6 (the
writer's daughter), Tanya Hahnel
'O5, Lauren lanuzzi 'O7 and Eric
Eisenberg 'O6.
"I invited Kathy to organize
this reading because I was in
Swarthmore giving speeches and
making other appearances on
Thursday," he said. Strauss, who
is also the founder of Capitol
Steps, a political comedy group
that performed at Swarthmore on
a Cooper Grant last semester,
gave a lecture on the generation
of current college students, which
he called "Millenials," and their
growing influence on American
society.

Before

sushi in the Science Center, before drunken Crum parties,
even before Bob Gross, one building stood alone in a rural
Pennsylvania field. Swarthmore College began with Parrish Hall,
199 students and a $350 fee. Today it is 357 acres, home to over 1,400 students and a yearly cost of $37,716 per student.
In the 1830s, Martha Tyson, a prominent figure in the Hicksite
Quaker Meeting of Baltimore, envisioned a college that would provide
higher education for Quaker youths. In 1864, her dream became a reality when she received a grant to create Swarthmore. The first Board of
Managers elected Edward Parrish, a Philadelphia pharmacist who had
been active in fund raising, as the college's first president.
When Swarthmore officially opened in 1869, Parrish Hall, then
known simply as the College, was its only building. Aside from dorms,
classrooms and dining rooms, Parrish housed a library, a museum and
a chemistry lab. Of the 200 students who enrolled, only 26 qualified as
college students, so Swarthmore initially served as a preparatory school
and an undergraduate institution.
In the past two centuries, Swarthmore's iconic building has seen dramatic events and changes. In 1881, Parrish was gutted by fire and rebuilt
that same year. It was in his Parrish office in 1969 that President
Courtney Smith died of a heart attack. Since then, Parrish hasn't
changed much. But, by 2005, it will have undergone renovations that
will completely alter the interior and character of the building.
On this 140th anniversary of Swarthmore's conception, The Phoenix
brings you back through these eventful years of change. In the first of
two installments, we explore the college's history of physical, academic

classes in ethics, chemistry, astronomy, physical sciences, literature,
rhetoric, history, mathematics, Greek and German. The engineering
department was added in 1874. According to "Swarthmore College: An
Informal History," the authoritative chronicle on the college,
Swarthmore's curriculum did not deviate greatly from other contemporary colleges, except that it offered electives and science courses.
Academics at Swarthmore became rigorous under Frank Aydelotte,
the college's seventh president. He introduced the honors program in
1922 and decreased the importance of football and other athletics. The
honors program "really transformed the college," Dean of the College
Bob Gross '62 said. "Aydelotte boosted the intellectual prestige of the
school."
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l remembered Swarthmore as a
"purist liberal arts kind of a place." The science departments were
strong, but he recalled that the engineers were less integrated into the
college as a whole. As an English major, most of Eldridge's classes were
on the second floor of Parrish.
Gross, who also majored in English, said that and the political science were two of the most popular departments when he was a student.
History professor Pieter Judson '7B also described English, history and
political science as popular during his time at college. "I don't think economics was half as popular as it is now," he said. "A lot more people did
modern languages."
Many changes among academic departments have occurred in
recent years. Professor Larry Westphal, who began teaching economics at Swarthmore in 1985, recalled that programs such as theater,
dance, Asian studies, film and media studies and linguistics did not
exist.
The development of the performing arts into academic departments
was a cause of contention among faculty, Westphal remembered. Under
the Quaker tradition, the arts, especially theater, were perceived as having too much entertainment quality to be considered serious academic
pursuits, he said.
The incorporation of the performing arts into the curriculum has
been "a big change," Gross said. Foreign study was also strongly discouraged before the Bloom presidency, according to Westphal. Judson,

bling the United States permeated the campus. The curfew rules "were
mostly enforced, though under attack" when he attended Swarthmore,
Maurer said.
The movement against segregation combined gender and racial
issues. Eldridge, a student in the early 19605, said there were few female
professors, no faculty members of color and no student minority groups
when he was in college. Usually the only African-American in his classes, Eldridge said he struggled to be himself "without having to live with
a stack of labels."
In 1969, after meetings with the admissions committee, communication with college President Courtney Smith, and a demonstration in
which it burned Swarthmore in effigy on Sharpies patio, the Swarthmore
Afro-American Students Society organized a sit-in in the Admissions
Office. It was advocating a recruitment and support program for black
students, set off by the admission of only eight black students in 1968. The
direct action ground college life to a halt. One week later, while students
were still controlling the office in Parrish, President Smith died of a heart
attack in his office. Author Richard Walton called it "the darkest week in
the history of Swarthmore," according to "Swarthmore College: An

Informal History." (The Phoenix published an in-depth report on the
admissions sit-ins in the Jan. 24, 2002 issue, available online.)
Minimal change began in the 19705, though by the end of the decade
Swarthmore still had no women's studies program. "The general feeling
was that women's studies was not academically rigorous or a real academic field," Judson said.
It was not until the 1980s that the number of black students on campus was enough to actually attract other African-Americans to the college. Today, Westphal said, issues of race and gender are integral aspects
of the Swarthmore curriculum, largely due to interdisciplinary minors
and departments that "grew out of faculty interest." He even had to eliminate his weekly "oral recitations" for Intermediate Microeconomics,
where students were graded on solving problems in front of the class. A
group of female students complained that the practice was "too macho,"
he said.

According to the Admissions Office, Swarthmore now has 32.9 percent minority students, one-quarter of whom are African-American.
Though women outnumbered men five to one in the first class, female
students are still slightly in the majority, at 53 percent.

Nader's run
In 2000, the political situation looked more or less stable. The economy was booming, the United States safely
held an undisputed place as global hegemon and the
candidates for both major parties were running on relatively moderate platforms. It seemed like a fairly boring
election; it looked like a good time for a third party to
make its mark, so the Greens drafted Ralph Nader to get
on TV and put far-left ideas back into the debate.
Now it's 2004. A wave of conservative triumphs have
swept over Washington in the wake of 9/11, leaving us
with the most Republican foreign policy and budget
proposal in over a decade. The economy is painfully
climbing out of recession, the military is embroiled in a
protracted occupatio and the specter of terrorist attack
continues to loom over us.
This will not be a boring election. This will be a
major election whose results will have a direct impact
on the future of our country. Whether or not the parties
are based on the same oppressive sociological structures, a Bush presidency in 2004-08 would have a very
different impact on gay marriage, on American inter-

vention in the Middle East and on the distribution of the
tax burden from that of a Kerry or Edwards presidency.
Despite all this, Nader, once again, has announced his
desire to run.
There is a legitimate argument for attempting to
increase third-party influence on politics, but the fact
remains that our single-vote plurality-based election
system means only a Republican or Democrat can realistically win. Those who agree with Nader's radical
political views will do a lot more to actually realize
them by voting for the Democrats' candidate in the
general election, even if that candidate seems to make
unconscionable compromises in other respects.
While we applaud all those who add to political debate

by expressing views far from the norm, we disagree that
an election is an appropriate event to make into a
soapbox. The results of this election will have a material
effect on people's lives, and people should recognize that,
even if Nader's campaign has a positive impact in the
media, their votes actually count. Voting for Nader will

both never get Naderhimself into office and still substantially affect the election, probably helping Bush.
Like it or not, politics is about factions and alliances.
There is nothing wrong with supporting ideals that are
greatly left or right of center, but refusing to compromise
with the center when necessary, even to avert the greater
evil, is irresponsible and self-defeating. Republicans who
don't like Bush still appear to understand this fact, while
many Nader liberals don't. While we encourage those
who find Nader the most appealing candidate to say so
openly, we hope anyone who wants real political change
votes for one of the two major parties this year.

Don't use Taliban to judge sharia
Dear Editor:
In Randy Goldstein’s Feb. 19 column, “Iraq: separate
sharia and state” (pg. 16), Goldstein expressed his concern
that the new Iraqi constitution might be based around
sharia, which he translated as “Islamic law.” Besides the
troubling fact that Goldstein seems to think the United
States should be able to impose its own wishes on the
emerging constitution of Iraq, Goldstein seems to be using
an incomplete definition of

sharia.
When defining sharia,
there are many things to
take into account. From
my academic understanding of the word, I believe it
is unfair and inaccurate to
equate the discursive tra-

according to my understanding, sharia is constantly
evolving based on the changing needs and understandings

of the specific scholarly communities that create it.
This very basic definitionof sharia as a discursive creation of an Islamic scholarly community goes against
Goldstein's fear that a sharia-based legal system would be

the same as the Taliban's constitution. Sharia is not a stat-

ic legal code. One community's understanding of sharia
might vary from another's.
Obviously, it is highly
important not to judge a reli-

dition of sharia and the law of the Taliban and other "fundamentalists." Even though one translation of sharia is
"Islamic law," it is not, in essence, a codified or concrete
set of laws, like many Western systems. It is the product
of centuries of discourse by scholars and judges based on
the Quran and hadith (the reported deeds and sayings of
the prophet Muhammad). This discourse creates and re-

creates sets of rules that each Muslim community is
organized around. Unlike certain Western legal codes,

though the Taliban
might have said it was carrying out its rule under the

of Islam,
many
Muslims would strongly disagree. No one would assume the Ku Klux Klan is the true
spirit of Christianity, even though it justifies its violent
acts with what it says are Christian principles. No one
would say burning crosses are an accurate embodiment of
Christianity. Therefore, we must not judge Islam by its
extremists. As Goldstein correctly points out, Islam is a
religion of peace, and we must not assume that a shariabased legal system would not reflect that peace.

"Original Man" is not to be
understood as the hero of Elijah
Muhammad's Nation of Islam.
No longer is he the mere antagonist of the white man. No longer
is he the black supremacist
awaiting salvation from the
white devil. Malcolm X wrested
"Original Man" from black mil-

lenarianism and redefined him
as the archetype of black power.

TARU TAYLOR

Gadfly

He left God to the heavens. He
rendered unto Caesar the things
that are Caesar's. He rendered
unto God the things that are
God's. Original Man, which is to

be understood as the role on the
world stage scripted by Malcolm
X, is the hero of Pan-Africa.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad was a great man. He did,
after all, found the Nation of Islam. But he had myopic vision and
narrow scope. His was a closed system, dogmatically airtight.
But Malcolm X was circumspect, open to the cosmos.
Muhammad's demonology had blackness as pure good, whiteness as pure evil. Yakub, the "big-headed scientist," grafted the
race of white devils, who were given 6,000 years to rule, up to 1914
all years hence are "years of grace" lasting only as long as it
takes the chosen of Allah to resurrect themselves from the
mental death imposed upon them by Yakub's creation. Upon resurrection, Allah would destroy the devils in the Battle of
Armageddon. Muhammad'sfrozen theology, stagnant and static,
cast "Original Man" as a millenarian awaiting Allah.
Malcolm X cast Original Man as a militant. The Nation of
Islam was a millenarian cult unto itself, but Malcolm X's black
America was a Pan-African base of operations. He founded
Muslim Mosque Inc. on the one hand, the Organization of AfroAmerican Unity on the other. Unlike the fatalistic Nation of
Islam, which had confused church and state, Malcolm X
separated church and state. He raised Original Man up from
black millenarianism to black power. He is the tragic hero of that
paradigm shift.
The Muslim Mosque Inc. alienated black Christians sympathetic to Malcolm X's black power movement. For blacks of the
Nat Turner brand of Christianity, as well as likeminded Muslims
and others, the secular OAAU was to serve as an umbrella. It was
for the black masses. But civil rights is black bourgeois.
As a militant, Malcolm X had been stymied by the Nation of
Islam's millenarian conservatism. Elijah Muhammad had misunderstood fate as fatalism. Indeed, his Islamic brand of millenarianism made his Black Muslim no less passive than the
black Christian who looked forward to God in heaven. The
Uncle Tom Christians passively await the afterlife in heaven;
meanwhile they endure a slave-driving hell on earth. The
Black Muslims passively await the day Allah will scourge the
white devil and purge the world of evil. Malcolm X realized
that Muhammad's millenarian fatalism was just as bad as
"Reverend Chickenwing's" pie-in-the-sky fatalism. Uncle Tom
and the Black Muslim are both reactive and emotional. If Du
Bois epitomizes house Negro resentment, Muhammad epitomizes field Negro resentment. Both merely antagonize the
white man. Du Bois is the light side, Muhammad is the dark
side, of Marginal Man.
As our "shining black prince," Malcolm X is our protagonist.
He epitomizes black power. He understood fate as destiny.
Napoleon once said, "I have made all the calculations; fate will
do the rest." That was Malcolm X's sense of destiny, proactive
and volitional. Comparing the fatalism ofMuhammad to the destiny of Malcolm X is like comparing numerology to calculus, or
astrology to astronomy. It is to compare a provincial outlook to a
Pan-African worldview.
Muhammad's "Original Man," stymied by belief in providence, was weak-willed. He believed in a capricious God who had
arbitrarily chosen the Nation of Islam as his kingdom on earth.
A god given to favoritism, willy-nilly choosing this race or that,
is ill-conceived. But Malcolm X, as a militant, preferred a God of
inexorable will. His god was constant and fixed, thus predictable
insofar as man can understand the mathematical symmetry of
destiny. Virtue is a byproduct of man's allegiance to the divine
will, an allegiance he demonstrates through militant action on
behalf of his god. Malcolm X taught us that Original Man is destined. But the Marginal Man, resentful of the white man, is the
slave of manifest destiny.

I have no morals for you this week. Just a few tips
and tricks for you to use as you will.
You can make papier-mache: Heat three parts
water and two parts cornstarch until it thickens, let it
cool and apply it to newspaper. Hey, vegetarians: If
you're not into the night's menu at the veggie bar, you
can always make yourself a tasty veggie wrap with fixings from the salad bar and the microwaves. Stores
that sell house paint will often give you mis-mixed
buckets for little or no cost; just ask. You can get free
drinks at fast food restaurants by bringing your own
cup (that looks like theirs) and getting a refill. You can
give your friends backrubs; this helps with everyone's
stress levels and deepens your friendships. You can
protect yourself from the effects of tear gas by wearing

swimming goggles and placing a bandana soaked in
over your nose and mouth. If you
play an instrument, you can teach your friends; if you
don't, you can get one of your friends to teach you. You
can make really big banners for events you are planning by creating, drawing or printing your image and
slogan to a transparency and using a projector to project the image onto a sheet, as a guide for painting.
If your hall wants to invest in a blender, you can
bring fruit and ice cream back from Sharpies and
make delicious smoothies whenever you want them.
apple-cider vinegar

You can suspend banners from helium balloons; this is
fun to do in a mall. You can write fierce, beautiful,
dangerous poetry.
You can make paint stencils out of cardboard or
clear plastic acetate to make your messages clear and
attractive. You could organize a community garden
with open lots for people to grow food. What about in
one of those abandoned lots in North Philly? You can
go skinny-dipping in Crum creek.
Alternatively, you could organize a Crum Cleanup,
so that you don't get a disease when you skinny-dip
there. You can take the Chinatown bus between
Boston, Philly, New York, D.C. and Baltimore for
between $lO and $l2. If you need to go somewhere far
away, you can post to an online activist ride board and
find someone who might take you with them for a little gas money. Arnica (best in cream form) will make
bruises go away nearly overnight and helps tremendously with muscle pain. If you want to build something, check the dumpsters at construction sites for
scrap wood and even nails and such. If you ever have
any free time for reading (yeah, right), talk to people
on your hall about setting up a list of what people have
in their bookshelves, and you can have your own
informal hall library. You can (and should) listen to
Porcupine Tree. Next time you take a train into Philly,
you can sit down near someone you don't know and
talk to them.
If someone on the street asks you for money, you
can offer to have dinner with them instead and actually get to know a little bit about them, instead of just
tossing a dime. If you're in a band, you could get

THE

LIVING

Judgmental distortions teach critic a lesson
Dear Editor:
I am grateful to Anna Perng 'O3 for her Feb. 19 reply
("Opposition to living wage elitist," pg. 15) to my commentary on the pitfalls and implications of the living wage
("Think before signing living wage pledge", Feb. 12, pg. 20).
Before I read Perng's
mt

insightful letter, I had been
sure the living wage was a
serious issue, with strong
moral and economic argumy
ments on both sides. I had
also been under the false
impression that my opinion
piece had voiced genuine
concerns about the living
wage campaign and that I had written it with the interests of the community in mind.
Luckily, Perng's informative piece showed me how
wrong I was.
Thanks to her, I realize now that "elitism" actually
"underlies criticism of a living wage." After all, it's
absurd that anyone could have thoughtful, responsible
reasons to oppose it.
She also convinced me that we shouldn't worry too
much about maintaining Swarthmore's educational
excellence, because that concern just boils down to a
desire for "access to wealth and privilege" as part of a
"Me, Myself and I" worldview. Silly me for thinking the
college safeguards a higher purpose and responsibility.

And I was particularly glad to be informed of the utter
foolery of the economic issues I raised
such as how our

current workers might well be displaced by overqualified
workers who could be earning those higher wages elsewhere. Impressively, Perng showed me my folly without
resorting to any economic
reasoning
or analysis

when one considers that,

at

a recent meeting,
Melanie Young, the chairwoman of the ad hoc com-

mittee, said herself of the
over-qualification problem that "there's nothing you can
do about that.")
Although I would be hard-pressed to repay Perng for
reforming my views on this matter so completely, I will
submit the following, though now in full seriousness:
Our staff, and workers everywhere, do deserve more.
Unfortunately, the living wage is hardly a magic bullet.
Moreover, it's admirable and right that Perng, an
alumna, should join the very important debate surrounding the living wage at Swat. The community would have
been better served, however, if she had contributed in a
real and informed way, instead of misrepresenting half
the arguments she encountered and belittling the rest.

plenty of information ("Living wage

"four years," she knows enough to

opinion of the issue and the

campaign.

It is excellent that
Donovan has an informed opinion,
but, unfortunately, she ignored the
actual content of the flyer she
received. Contrary to Donovan's
letter, it was not information about
getting involved in the campaign. It
was a notice about the administration's
not the campaign's
feedback session, held to hear diverse student opinions and to answer ques-

tions. The campaign advertised that
forum (with summaries of the Ad Hoc
Committee on a Living Wage's report
and the campaign's comments) hoping that all students, no matter their
opinion or level of education, would
attend. Does this "infringe upon"
Donovan's "right to have a difference
of opinion"? Rather than being dismissive of efforts to involve everyone
in a college decision-making process
that will happen with or without us,
Donovan should support the feedback
process by expressing her opinion.
Obviously students vary in terms
of informationalneeds. Let's try to be
understanding while we all work to
get on the same page in terms of education. If you get a flyer you don't
want or need, recycle it. If you want
more information, ask the campaign,

Dear Editor:

Having read the Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage's
report and attended as many of the meetings and events
as my schedule would allow, I am left with important
questions that still have not been addressed: namely, how
the proposed wage increases would be financed and the

crucial point of how the student body feels about possibly
shouldering the burden through even higher tuition
rates. The Living Wage and Democracy Campaign's tactic
of demanding action before the community at large has
had a chance to respond is irresponsible, while its tendency to label those with concerns as elitist is annoying
and more than slightly absurd. In any case, elitist or not,
I stand as one of what I feel is a silent majority of
students, faculty and staff unconvinced, unsure and
increasingly disillusioned.

letter by Anna Perng 'O3 attacking Garth Sheldon-Coulson
'O7 for writing an op-ed critical of the living wage campaign. Perng's decision to write off Sheldon-Coulson's
arguments as elitist attempts to defend his "access to
wealth and privilege" makes me ashamed of my
Swarthmore diploma. Perhaps Sheldon-Coulson's worries
that the living wage would be expensive and self-defeating
are misguided, but Perng made no attempt to address
them, preferring to resort to overt distortions and ad
hominem attacks.
An open and pluralistic society requires a basic level
of respect for the opinions of others and an interest in
serious dialogue with those who disagree. Unfortunately,
Swarthmore's monolithic political climate produces too
many graduates like Perng, who display active disdain for
any beliefs outside a narrow spectrum. Consequently, I
have made the painful decision to withhold my financial
support from the college.

Thank you, Howard
During the fall of 2002,
I surprised my family by
informing them that I was
supporting Howard Dean
for president. Their reaction, if I remember correctly, was to ask who he
was. Indeed, when Dean
began his campaign, there
were not many people outside Vermont who knew

much about this doctor-

durturned-governor
ing 2002, a New Republic

PATRICK HART
cover story on Dean was
entitled “Invisible Man.”
The Drawing Board
That was before. It was
before Dean electrified
the Democratic National
Committee Winter Meeting in February 2003 with a speech
criticizing congressional Democrats' capitulation to Bush
on issues ranging from Iraq to tax cuts to No Child Left
Behind. Dean's rousing speech had the delegates on their
feet, cheering wildly as Dean used Paul Wellstone's line:
"I'm from the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party!"
It was before Dean's campaign made an agreement with
Meetup that helped Dean's message spread like wildfire
over the Internet. As 2003's spring moved into summer,
each month seemed to bring bigger and bigger crowds to
the Dean Meetups. It was before Dean shocked the political
world by using small, Web-driven donations to raise more
money than any of his opponents during the second
fundraising quarter of 2003. It was before polls in the fall
showed him with commanding leads in New Hampshire
and many other important primary states. It was before
the endorsements of Al Gore and two of the country's
largest unions made Dean appear to be the inevitable
nominee.
And it was before the January polls began to show an
increasing wariness about Dean among primary voters. It
was before the night of the lowa caucuses, which started
off badly for Dean supporters with Dean's disappointing
third-place finish and ended worse with Dean's famous
scream a minor misstep, but one CNN later admitted to
wildly overplaying and one that came to define many voters' view of Dean. It was before John Kerry won New
Hampshire, whereDean had once held a 25-point lead. And
it was before Dean finished a distant third place in
Wisconsin and decided to exit the race.
I'm not going to try to analyze the reasons for Dean's
fall from grace here, both because I'm not sure anyone
entirely understands them and because Dean evokes such
diametrically different responses from his supporters and
his opponents. Supporters like me see an innovative, committed and strong candidate who stuck to his beliefs and
wanted to bring real change to Washington. Dean detractors see a slightly unstable governor of a tiny state with no
foreign policy experience who thrived on demagoguery
and anger. I know what I believe but it is unproductive
to rehash the Dean debate. He's out of the race. Whether
you view that as a good or bad fact, it is a fact.
Whatever you may think of him, though, Dean deserves
a lot of credit. His campaign team, led for most of the campaign by Joe Trippi, used the Internet in innovative ways
that will surely be used again by many future political
campaigns. More important, he brought many voters who
had been disaffected and apathetic into the political
process. I've read many testimonies by people who say
Dean brought them back into politics and gave them hope
and a reason to vote again. One can only hope these
Deaniacs won't disappear
all who want progressive
change in this country will need them in the next election.
I have a feeling that Dean's followers, if they resist the
temptation to vote for Ralph Nader, will end up being a
boon for the Democratic nominee. Already, Dean and
many of his followers have talked about continuing to
build a grassroots movement that will help effect progressive change across America.
That is for the future, though. For now, I'll simply end
by saying, "Thank you, Howard. Thank you for being the
most inspiring candidate in the 2004 race. Thank you for
giving so many people hope in politics again. You did a lot
of good things in this campaign, and whatever happens in
the future, you deserve enormous credit from the
Democratic Party and the United States of America."

Women swim to fourth place at conferences
other teams just had more depth than us. It will be

BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
The women's swim team finished its season with a
fourth-place finish at the Centennial Conference championships last weekend. The Tide managed to score
463.5 points just behind Franklin and Marshall (748),
Gettysburg (562.5) and Dickinson (497). Tara Trout 'O4
scored a third-place finish in the 1,650 freestyle with a
time of 18:12.52, earning her a bronze medal at the
finals. This was also only the second time Trout had
swum this race, which converts to 66 laps in the pool.
Trout's time was only two seconds off the school
record, set by Gretchen VandeWalle in 1989 with a time
of 18:10.50.
"I think overall we performed very well, although
our conference is getting much stronger," Trout said.
"Our conference definitely has swimmers who hold
above-average Division 111 times. There are national
record holders in the Centennial Conference, and, in
general, most swimmers hold Division I times."
Michele Horn 'O7 also placed for the Garnet, swimming the 200 breaststroke in 2:32.52 for a sixth-place
finish. Horn swam well in the 50 freestyle, as well,
earning a personal best. While Horn and Trout were
the only swimmers to make the finals, the team was
happy with the personal-best times of their swimmers
and hopeful for next year's season. Melanie Johncilla
'O5 earned personal-best times in the 200 freestyle, with
a time of 1:57.20, and in the 100 freestyle, with a time of
54.86.
"It was a good meet in general," Horn said. "A lot of
our swimmers had personal bests, but some of the

good for us to pick up right where we left off next year,
with a goal to place higher at conferences."
The women also turned out a third-place finish in
the 400 freestyle relay, earning a time of 3:41.79.
Martyna Pospieszalska 'O6, Leah Davis 'O4, Johncilla
and Patricia Funk 'O6 at anchor brought the Tide in
strong at the finals. Johncilla, Pospieszalska, Funk
and Katherine Reid 'O5 also swam well in the 800
freestyle relay.

"The relays did really well," Johncilla said. "I think
the seniors will leave this season with a good vibe
about their swims. It will definitely be sad to see them
go. For next year, I think we'll get better, sticking to
our training and focusing on improving our swims
and our attitudes."

"[Johncilla] swam very well, dropping times in virtually every event, but people are so fast that placing
frequently comes down to a couple hundredths of a

second," Trout said.
As a senior, Trout swam in her last race of her
career over the weekend. "It was a nice to get an individual medal at my last race of my last meet. I was
really ecstatic," she said. "The team is very young, and
I think it will build over the next couple of years, with
promising swimmers developing and improving along
the way."
Leah Davis also reflected on the closing of her
Swarthmore swimming career. "While I wish I could
have gone out with more of a bang, it's been a great
experience overall," she said. "Even if the meet was
not perfect, I'm glad I got to spend four years on this
team."

Wise Up.

Pannorfi batted .340 and led the team in runs

Men's baskeball ends season with losses to Bullets and Fords
BY MATT SCHILLER

mschilll@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet men's basketball team was
eliminated from the playoffs on Tuesday
after a loss to rival Haverford 59-55 in the
final match of the season. The Tide also
fell 67-63 to Gettysburg on Saturday. They
dropped the final three games of the season.
Against Gettysburg, Matt Gustafson

'O5 led the way with a game-high 18
points, and Chris Loeffler added 14 points
and 13 rebounds for his second doubledouble of the season.
The Tide rolled out to a seven-point
halftime lead on tough defense and scrappy offensive play. The Garnet made up for
37.5 percent shooting from the field in the
first half by knocking down four threepointers and being a near-perfect 15-of-16

from the charity stripe.

Swarthmore's shooting slump continued into the second half. "Gettysburg shot
the ball better than we did," coach Lee
Wimberly said. "I give them credit. I
thought they played very well."
Gettysburg first tied the score at 46
with just less than 13 minutes remaining,
but the Garnet responded with free

throws from Jeff Maxim 'O7 and a Jacob
Letendre 'O4 three-pointer to go back

ahead 51-46. Gettysburg bounced back
with a run of their own, taking a 53-52
lead with 7:42 remaining. As the Garnet
continued to struggle on offense, the
Bullets extended their lead to 63-55, the
largest of the game. The Tide cut that lead
to five on a Loeffler three-pointer but
couldn't convert on its following position.
Gettysburg sank two free throws to put
the game out of reach.
The Garnet were unable to revive
their playoff hopes with a win against
Haverford. Jeff Maxim 'O7 posted a gamehigh 18 points on 8-of-13 shooting, and
Loeffler put up 12 points and nine
rebounds in the losing effort.
They trailed by two at the half, 29-27, in

front of a raucous home crowd, despite
shooting only 24 percent from the field. A
pull-up jumper by Jacob Letendre 'O4 put
Swarthmore up 51-48 with under three
minutes to play.
The Fords jumped at the chance to
play spoiler to their biggest rival, going
on a 7-0 run to take a 55-51 lead with less
than a minute left. A layup by Loeffler
pulled Swarthmore within a basket at 5755, but Haverford hit two foul shots to
seal it.
"We were definitely into the game as
far as our energy was going. We were all
over the floor and the offensive boards,
and we came out strong defensively,"
Mark Rohde 'O7 said. "What it came down
to is we didn't execute in crunch time."
Despite not making the playoffs this
year, the Garnet have had an eye-opening
season. Voted a distant ninth out of 10
teams in the Centennial Conferences preseason poll, the Tide proved the outsiders
■wrong, finishing in sixth place just one
game out of a Conference Tournament
berth. They posted a 12-13 (9-9 Centennial
Conference) record on the year.
"Looking back over the season and
looking from where the program was
three years ago to where it is now, I can
honestly say I'm truly proud of everyone
involved," tri-captain Jared Passmore 'O4
said. "The commitment they've made, the
work they've put in, the dedication
they've shown, and their willingness to
sacrifice for the team has made me very

proud."
"I feel great about the season," coach
Wimberly said. "This team has been an
absolute pleasure to coach. They're hardworking and unselfish. They've really

overachieved.
"We've overcome a number of adversities all year long," he added. "They just

continued to fight and battle, and I think
they've done absolutely great. I'm totally
proud of those 12 guys and what they've
endured all year long and how successful
they've been."

Garnet crush Fords but fall a game short of playoffs
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu

The women's basketball team finished its season on a
high note Tuesday night, blowing out Haverford 84-42 at
home to cap a three-game winning streak and ending the
season with a 16-9 overall mark (11-7 CC), one game out of
the playoff picture.
Katie Robinson 'O4 turned in a sensational performance in the final game of her collegiate career, hanging a
season-high 31 points on the Fords while shooting 11 of 20
from the field and five of eight from behind the three point
arc. Radiance Walters 'O6 added 10 points and 8 rebounds
to the Garnet cause, while Zoey Adams-Deutsch 'O6
chipped in with eight points and nine rebounds for the
Tide en route to their spanking of the visiting Haverford
squad.
Swarthmore jumped out to an early 16-1 lead against
the Fords in the first half and never looked back, staying
up on Haverford 37-16 at the half before burying it in the
second. "I think we had a great week," Robinson said. "It
was a great way to end the season, and we were all happy
about it."

Despite the overall team effort, Robinson still emerged
as the star, as her 31 points garnered her and Jerusha

Rodgers 'O4 their 81st victory in four years. The victory
put an end to Robinson's stunning career as she finished

with a conference record 420 steals, good for 13th all time
in Division 111. Her career total of 1,682 points ranks her
fourth all-time in the conference and third in school history, while Robinson ranks first in conference history in
free throw shooting percentage (87%, 247 for 285) and third
THE PHOENIX

in three-point field goal percentage at 38.3 percent (57-149).
"It was a great way to end my career, and I couldn't
have asked for a better game," Robinson said. "It was so
much fun, and I think it was really a fitting way to go out.
I just feel so blessed to have been able to play here for four
years, and I'm going to miss it. I wouldn't ask for anything

more from here."
The women also defeated Gettysburg 60-54 last
Saturday in action, led by Robinson's 17 points. The victory, however, was a hollow one as a Franklin and
Marshall victory officially eliminated the Tide from playoff contention. "I think we pretty muchk new after the
F&M game that we were out of it," Robinson said. "It was
disappointing, seeing as it's the first time not making
post-season in my career, but hopefully next year they'll
be able to get it back
The game was close the entire way the Bullets were
tied with the Garnet at 27 at the half, then managed to
draw even with Swarthmore yet again in the final minutes of the game after the Tide jumped out to a big lead
early in the second half. With the score knotted at 54,
Robinson hit two huge jumpers, and Adams-Deustch sunk
a pair from the line to seal the game for
Swarthmore."Gettysburg was a good game," Jen
Stevenson 'O6 said. "It was one of the few games where we
put 40 minutes together, and a lot of people played well."
While the team is losing both Robinson and Rogers, it
will still return a key nucleus for next year's team and
promises to be in playoff contention for years to come.
"

"We're going to take off where [Robinson] left us,"
Stevenson said. "She's hard to replace, but we're confident about next year."

Boredom in b-bal
Now that last week's rant is out of the way, we feel much better. All bitterness and cynicism aside, February is just a boring
month for sports. This is not to say, however, that we here at 90%
Half Mental have nothing to write about. Because luckily the

world of sports is filled with debates, many of which get more
heated as the actual games cool off. So while the games in
February may be boring, the debates are hardly so. Without further ado, we'll leap into an important debate this time of year:
Which sport is better, college basketball or professional basketv

ball?

Now, we know what you're thinking. "Ben, just last week,
didn't you characterize the professional basketball season as
'boring,' while calling the college basketball season 'neither boring nor miserable?' Yes, in fact, we did. But, alas, it's not really
"

that simple. Because an important ingredient was missing from
our evaluation last week. That

ingredient sometimes goes by the
moniker "Big Mo," but we're
going to call it by its precise technical name: momentum. And
while the NBA may be "boring"
and the NCAA "neither boring
nor miserable," the fact remains
that the NBA has tons of momentum, while the NCAA has none.
This is important to this
week's column, even though it
wasn't to last week's. See, it
wasn't important to last week's
BEN WHARTON
column because boring is a concept concerned only with the
here and now. Boring cares not
whether the NBA is getting less
boring while the NCAA gets
more boring. Boring cares only that right now, the NBA is "boring," while the NCAA is "neither boring nor miserable." But if
Boring were looking into the future, perhaps using specialized
graphs and predictive charts, Boring would see that sometime
fairly soon, Boring would be wearing a college basketball jersey.
It might be a Stanford Cardinals jersey or perhaps a Kansas
Jayhawks piece. But it would definitely be collegiate and it
would definitely be boring.
So why is college basketball becoming boring, while professional basketball is becoming exciting? Basically, because the
pros are getting a lot of talent that either never or only momentarily plays college ball. Nowadays, if a player has real talent,
he spends maybe two years at a major Division I school, putting
up good numbers and maybe helping his school win a conference championship en route to being bounced early in March
by some mid-major terror squad. If that player is truly great, he
might help his team win the NCAA Championship before he
leaves, a la Carmelo Anthony. More likely, though, he goes right
into the NBA, like Lebron James, Kevin Garnett or Kobe
Bryant. This sort of thing is so epidemic now that high school
players who simply think they have the talent are jumping into
the NBA
a la James Lang, Ousmane Cisse and Leon Smith.
And then these players get waived and end up playing for the
Asheville Altitude, or the Gary Steelheads, or somewhere in

90% Half Mental

Germany.

Now both of these scenarios are obviously bad for college basketball. Imagine what kind of college careers Kevin Garnett or
Lebron James could have had. College basketball is missing out
on a lot of bona fide superstars who jumped straight to the NBA
or only stayed for a few years. But the college game is also missing a lot of quality players who went to the NBA straight from
high school and either didn't perform, or got injured, or cracked
under the pressure. The absence of these players hurts the college game a lot, while it doesn't really hurt the pro game at all.
After all, if they couldn't cut it in the pros, the pro game is better
off without them.
There are a lot of other reasons the pro game is rapidly surpassing the college game in excitement. The NBA is gaining a lot
of talent from overseas, while American colleges get almost
none. The NBA can and does market itself as a big money league.
If the NCAA tried anything like that, it would just be farcical.
But the NCAA has a wildcard that the NBA will never approach
in terms of excitement. Here, of course, we're referring to that of
the field of 65, the NCAA Tournament. And while the games may
not be as exciting, nor the players as talented as they used to be,
we'll be damned if March Madness doesn't make us want to skip
the NBA altogether.

Swimmers take fourth place

The men's swim team finished in fourth place at

conferences last weekend. With lifetime bests posted
for many, it is no wonder why. Host Franklin and
Marshall led the conference with 810 points,
Gettysburg finished second with 730 points and
Dickinson squeaked by the Tide's 536 points to finish
with 558. Though it was in fact the Garnet's lowest
finish

in
Conference history, it was a
masterful performance by the

vides much hope for the
future. Coach Sue Davis was

efforts. "The entire freshman

rose to the occasion. All the
men had absolutely seasonbest performances, and in the majority of cases they
that also includes the sophowere lifetime bests
more, junior and senior classes," Davis said.
The Garnet breaststrokers performed well in the
meet. Andrew Koczo 'O7 saw silver in the 100-yard
breaststroke with Eric Shang 'O4 and Kaena Horowitz
'O6 finishing just behind in fourth and sixth places.
Anders Taylor 'O7, Brian Rose 'O6 and Aaron Modic 'O4
also contributed points in the event for the squad,
tacking on a total of 61 points for the Tide. In the 200yard breaststroke, it was the same story. This time,
Shang took second, Koczo took the bronze and Rose
came in sixth, finishing just ahead of Rob McKeon 'O7.
Koczo also contributed to the high-performance
relay teams. He teamed up with Taylor, Jason Horwitz
'O7 and Mike Auerbach 'O5 to take bronze in the in the
400 medley relay with a time of 3:37.69. If you substitute Jonathan Augat 'O7 for Taylor, you have the 200
medley relay team, which finished fourth with a time

&&Mmxi&jiB6k*

of 2:0192. The presence of Swarthmore's first-year
class was no more strongly felt than in the relays. "We
really had a huge impact on the meet," Augat said.
"All the freshman did really well overall."
Jason Horwitz posted several lifetime best swims.
With the crowd roaring, Horwitz turned it on in the
final leg of the 800-yard freestyle in the last race
Saturday night to defeat defending champion
Gettysburg with a bronze medal-worthy finishing
time of 7:15.57. Swimming the anchor for the relay
team, Horwitz swam a 1:46.69

split, the third fastest of all
swimmers in the conference.
In the 200 backstroke, he finished strong again with a
sixth place finish and a time

of 2:0L35.
Adam Morris 'O6 had somewhat of a life-changing experience Saturday. After two lifetime bests in the morning, he
returned to the pool in the evening for two more for a
grand total of four lifetime bests in one day.
"I had a really great performance, and my taper
worked really well," Morris said. "F&M has a fast
pool. The intensity of the competition and the excitement leading up to the meet all had a big impact."
Morris also was impressed by his team. "I was really
proud of how the whole team swam. Both teams
(men's and women's) finished fourth, which really
doesn't reflect how well we swam," he said. "The conference just got better this year."
Overall, coach Davis gave the team high marks for
finishing off the season strong. "We knew the
strengths of the conference, and we were trying to battle it out with Dickinson for third," she said. "It came
down to the freestyle relays and they had more firepower than we did, but absolutely straight across the
board our guys had one of the most outstanding performances that we've ever had."
