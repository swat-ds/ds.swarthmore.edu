STC Addresses Student Concerns
By Ben Maulbeck

Some Swarthmore students have expressed dissatisfaction with the telephone
service for this academic year. As of this
summer, STC Services has taken over
the billing for Swarthmore's phone services; a variety of circumstances surrounding this transition have led to several problems with both billing and the
actual phones.
Mark Dumic, Manager of Networking
and Systems at Swarthmore, said, "I'm
certainly aware, and the College is certainly aware, and STC is aware, that there
are problems with their level of service.
I certainly talked on a regular basis with
people at STC and, from my perspective,
they seemed to be doing all they can to
get beyond the problems that we've had."
Many students complained that this
year's rates seem to be higher than last
year's, and that they had not been informed ofany change. Dumic says, "The
discount is not as good as it was lastyear.
They are correct. While we're not trying
to hide that fact, I guess we didn't go out
of our way to make a lot of noise about
the fact thatthe discounts were not going
to be as good." He notes thatthe rates for
the last two years represented a ten percent discount on AT&Tresidential rates
based on the assumption derived from
other colleges' experience that the average student would spend $4O a month in
telelphone calls. Dumic notes, "Ourreality is students are making somewhere
between $2O and $25 worth of calls per
month. And so, to some extent, we got
caught with some deficit because our
projection did not match reality. This
year what we have done is eliminatethat

10% discount, and so what faculty, staff,
and students are getting are just standard
AT&T residential rates, which we still
feel are better than the other options."
Many students also found that their
phones were not functioning properly at
the beginning of the year; several had to
wait for long periods of time before their
phones were repaired. STC was actually
only tangentially involved in the repairs;
the college itself is still responsible for
phone maintenance.
Dumic says, "Initially, when students
started coming back into the dorms, we
had a real crunch with a lot of broken
phones that took longer than we would
have liked to have repaired." The College removes thephones from the dorms
at the beginning ofeach summer "so that
the summer camps can come in and there
won't be any damage or theftof phones."
Since the summer camps stayed in the
dorms two weeks longer than in thepast,
there was relatively little time to "reinstall 1300phones, test them, and then to
fix them. So a lot of the students came
back with phones still not working, and
we had a situation where we were shortstaffed and it took a long time to. ..fix [all
thephones]." Dumic thinks that all of the
repairs have been made and that any
requests for service can now be fulfilled
more promptly.
Other students havehad difficulty with
the billing service itself, for which STC
is responsible. Steven Shin '9B says, "I
just thought the bluebill was very unprofessional; it had typos, sentences that
didn't quite make sense, and the wrong
dates for the billing period. In addition,
what kind of self-respecting company
hands out a bill asking for a random sum

of money for services not described?"
Other students also reported incorrect
billing, where students were sometimes
charged twice for the same call or for
calls they had not made. In addition, the
first bill, only received by those students
in theirdorms during the summer, incorrectly said to make checks payable to
STC instead of Swarthmore College.
Many of theseproblems are due to the
recent expansion of STC Services. STC
sent an e-mail message to all Swarthmore students yesterday explaining the
many unexpected technical problems that
have led to the billing diffficulties. A
fully accurate summary invoice will be
sentto all students to clarify any previous
problems, as well as to inform all students ofhow they can get in touch with
STC.
Dumic explains the reasons for switching to STC: "We decided to go with
STC... last Spring. We [previously] had a
Swarthmore staff who operated a computer with billing software on it that we
had purchased two years ago." Dumic
describes the current set-up: "They have
equipment that's connected to our telephone system that records information
on who's calling, where they're calling,
how long they're calling. They take that
back to their computer system and run it
through their accounting software, torate
the call, to assign it a cost, and to track
that, and then to send out monthly bills
and track the payments that come in."
STC Services also helps in fielding student requests for assistance. There used
to be only one person on campus, "and
during the beginning of. the year, that
person was always overwhelmed. And if
thatperson was sick for a couple of days,

then no problems got solved on campus
for a couple of days, whereas with STC,
they have three or four people at any one
time manning the phones...So the potential is certainly there for a much better
level of service." He also cited STC's
experience and its ability to provide higher
level consulting services.
"My commitment is to provide a high
level of service to the whple
community...We do take seriously the
fact that the transition from what we had
herelast year to what we have here now
has been a rocky one and that there have
been some ongoing problems with STC.
We'll iron those problems out, and so all
I would ask the community to do is to
give us the benefit of the doubt for a
couple more months.
"I think you'll see the level of service
improve dramatically, and that we'll be
able to get bills out in a very consistent
manner—accuratebills—which is something, frankly, we didn't dovery well last
year when it was run by the college. And
if that doesn't happen, then we'll do
something different to...[provide] a high
level of service." He encouraged students to contact STC with any problems,
and to inform him if they stilldo not feel
satisfied.
STC services reflects Dumic's sentiments: "Despite all of these obstacles,
STC Services' personnel and management remain committed to providing
Swarthmore College students with
friendly, courteous, timely and accurate
customer service. To this end, most of
our staff has been working late into the
night and every weekend since mid-August and will continue their diligent efforts until any problems are resolved."

College Investigates Options For
Campus Use During Summer
By Kate Bernstein
SwarthmoTe Collegemay soon be undergoing some major changes during the
summer months. The Summer Swarthmore Exploratory Group, a sub-committee of the College Planning Committee
(CPC), was recently formed to examine
different possibilities for campus use
during the summer.
Currently, the school's facilities are
mainly used for athletic camps, the Upward Bound program, and student-faculty research. This fall, a groupof faculty
and staff members hopes to investigate
what other activities are available to the
College. The committee wants to look at
a wide variety of programs for current
students, prospective students, and the
elderly. Inquiries about the school's facilities are widespread, and there are many
different organizations seeking to use the
campus.

hire S warthmore majors and serious nonmajoTS to teach courses in studio and art
history. The second would be for graduate student residencies. The modelwould
be based on the current system used by
the professional dance companies in the
Lang Performing Arts Center. There are
many problems associated with both
ideas, but both programs have great potential."
The Pre-College Outreach Programs
subgroup is currently evaluating
Swarthmore'scurrentprogramsand looking for models at various other campuses, including CTY at Johns Hopkins
and Explo at Wellesley. The Retreats,
Conferences, and Workshops subgroup

is considering a proposal to expand the
College's hosting of conferences and
workshops.They are also discussing what
kinds of organizations should or should
not be present on campus in terms of
political and religious affiliation. "However," said Professor of Astronomy and
subgroup member John Gaustad, "there
is no particular reason to do so, and it may
be costly. Although we do get many
requests, there are plenty of other facilities in the area. The other subgroups
seem to be generating a greater enthusiasm for their type of activity."
The group is adamant about only suggesting programs that the College can
administer successfully, however, some
might entail certain complications. Larry
Schall, Associate Vice President for Facilities and Services, commented that
some of the intended programs will not
make money, and that can pose a big
problem. "We rely on the money that we
make during the summer; right now, the
summer programs bring in a quarter of a
million dollars. That moneypays for five
professors' salaries or the renovation of
faculty houses or a v ariety ofother things.
If a program is chosen that won't make
any money, we need to find another source
of income to support the rest of the year.
Dreams are OK, but we can't forget the
other piece. The school can have an art
camp and also make money with it."
According to Schall, the choice that the
CPC will have to make is if a program is
important enough, perhaps in terms of
maintaining the school's reputation or in
terms of recruitment, to lose potential
revenue because of it.
A problem could also arise in terms of
housing. Housing is limited and certain
dorms are not open during the summer
months. Time is needed at thebeginning
and end of the summer to prepare the
dorms for students' arrival on campus.
"There's definitely a limit as to how
many people we can house. Even if there
is extra room in a dorm, we cannot stick
two groups together," commented Schall.
Also, an overwhelming number of programs would pose a strain on the current
staff, and increases in staffmay therefore
be required. Furthermore, in terms of
conferences, the lack of air-conditioning
would discourage a lot of organizations
from using the campus' facilities. Airconditioning and other additions might
need to be made if more conferences
were to take place on campus.
It is obvious that the Summer S warthmore Exploratory Group will be making

important decisions during the course of

the semester. Many of these decisions
will directly or indirectly affect the student body. A question that then arises is
what part students will play in the decision-making process. Pasternack invited
all the appropriate subgroups to add students. However, it is unclear whether any
students are active members of the subgroups. At this point, itis more likely that
the subgroups will solicit student input
through individual interviews. Pre-College Outreach Programs plans to rely
heavily on input from students who have
attended Pre-College programs and would
welcome any information at this point. It

magazine nine months later. The October 19,199S issue of the magazine read,

has launched an intense search for a
College mascot. Elizabeth Hirshfield'96
is soliciting suggestions until Saturday,
October 7 through either E-mail or campus mail.
The impetus for this search came from
the desire of a small group of students
who felt that a new symbol for the
College's identity needed to be found. A
few administrators had the same feeling,
and the two groups collaborated to "act
upon their ideas," as Hirshfield says.
The new mascot would appear at athletic
events and be featured on College clothing and other memorabilia sold in the
Bookstore.
So far, Hirshfield has received ninety
responses, some of whichcontained multiple suggestions, and others of which
expressed "concern over the idea of
adopting a new mascot," according to
Hirshfield. The suggestions have included ants, squirrels. Garnet Tide, redtailed hawks, trees, bushes, a crumb, a
wild kangaroo, nerds, books, earthworms, a pterodactyl, and a phoenix.
The search has also led to a lively
discussion in the swat.talk group in
News watcher. Suggestions there include
the following contributions by Andrew
Brown' 97: "Arboretum, Bleeding Heart,
Different Drummer, the Other."Patrick
Friel '96 said that the Parrish Hall logo
didnot necessarily have to be discarded.
He writes thatthree people dressed up as
the building for the '93 Mary Lyons
Halloween party. He suggested, "We
make a few alterations, put it on one
person, and have him run all over the

place at sporting events. It builds school
spirit, provides a few laughs, and keeps
the logo the same for all our stuff."
Barring this, Friel suggested the Inner
Light, which would the prevent the College from wasting "money making the
costume or putting it on sweatshirts—you feel it, rather than see it." He also
advocated the Guilty Complainer, who
might say during a game, "I guess I'll
stay until the end of this quarter, but I
really shouldn't.I have SO much to do."
Some students feel that the search
itself is unnecessary. Amita Sudhir '9B
wrote that having Swarthmore did not
need a mascot becuase "we are not
like...any other American college or
university...One of the reasons I chose
Swat is that it is, beyond doubt, a unique
institution. We don't need some dancing animal to prove our existence to the
outside world. Our lack of a mascot is
part of our charm."
Ross Dickson '97 agreed, saying "I
think dropping the matter is the best
suggestion yet" Sudhir went further,
asking, "Besides, how are we ever going
to get 1300 S watties to agree on a single
mascot without stepping on someone's
toes?" The fact that Hirshfield has multiple endorsementsof some of the same
mascot candidates indicates that coming to a consensus might indeed be possible.
The final decision as to the identity of
the mascot will take the form of an
election in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, alumni and parents
will take part. The contender which attracts the most votes will become the
new mascot Hirshfield expresses her
personal desire thatthe mascot be "something that isn't ridiculous."

Locking doors for twenty four hours is not the solution
Last weekend, a few S warthmorestudents happened to be visiting Perm together, and had the
pleasure of staying overnight in one of theirdorms.
The Swarthmore students were signed in by their
hosts, dropped off their belongings and went out
to a party. When they returned about two hours

at the desk. Their names were still written in the

If students did strongly agree that security is
threatened on campus and that locking doors will
make them feel safer, then perhaps the policy
would make sense. However, the results of the

This is a busy time for you. But while you are
choosing classes and making the decisions that
will help you build a good life for yourself, the
Congressional majority is working to make drastic cuts in education in your student loans, in
national service, and even in your scholarships.
And the cuts will jeopardize die future you and
your generation are working toward.
I want you to know that I oppose these cuts. 1
will do everything in my power to fight them. I
will do this not only by defending the opportunities of those of you who are already in college, but
by opening the doors further to make sure that
even greater numbers of deserving Americans
have the chance to stand where you stand today.
For the first time in a long time, leaders from
both parties are resolved that we must balance the
federal budget. From the day I took office. I’ve
been committed to this goal—to getting rid of the
budget deficit that quadrupled our national debt in
the 12 years before I came to Washington. So far,
we have made great progress. In three years, we
have cut the deficit nearly in half, from $290
billion to $160 billion.
Now we are ready to eliminate the deficit entirely. On this, the Congressional majority and 1
see eye to eye.
But just how we get rid of the deficit is anothei
matter. The majority in Congress wants to balance
the budget in seven years, and do it while giving
an unnecessarily large tax cut. But in order to do
these things, the Congressional majority would
make enormous cuts in education.
My balanced budget plan would take more
years than Congress’ to eliminate the deficit, but
that’s a small price to pay to keep your scholarships, your student loans, and national service
safe and well.It would also preserve our ability to
protect the environment and the integrity ofMedicare for our older citizens.
Balancing the budget is about more than numbers. It’s about our values and our future. Education has always been thecurrency of theAmerican
Dream. When I was your age, it was assumed
based on our long history that each generation
would have a better life than the preceding one.
More than anything else, a good education is the
way we pass thisvision on to those who come after

us.
The facts speak for themselves. Earnings for
those with no post-secondary educationhave fallen
substantially in the last 15 years. The onlypeople
for whom earnings have increased steadily are
people exactly like you those Americans with
more education. Every year of higher education
increases your earnings by six to 12 percent
Those years also mean a stronger overall economy
and richer lives for those who have them.
Balancing the budget will be good for our
economy and your future if it’s done right. But
simply balancing the budget won’t do us much
good in the long term if your generation does not
have the educationit needs to meet the challenges
of the next century.
Just think over what the Congressional
majority’s plan, if it went through, would do to
you, your classmates, and any of the one out of
two college students whoreceives federal aid. It
would:
Raise the cost of student loans by $10 billion
over seven years by charging you interest on your
loan while you are in school. This would increase
the cost of a college education by as much as
$3,100 for undergraduates and $9,400 for graduate students.
Deny up to 360,000low-income students who
desperately needed Pell Grants in 1996.
Shut down Americorps, our national service
initiative, which gives thousandsof young people
the chance to earn and save money for college
while serving their country.
By contrast, mybalanced budget plan builds on
the national consensus that we must help people
help themselves, through the power ofeducation.
It eliminates both of our deficits: our budget
defecit and our education deficit. My plan cuts
wasteful spending by more than $1 trillion, but it
also increases investments in education by $40
billion over the next seven years.
Think over ho w my balanced budget plan would
help guarantee your future and all the hard work
you’re about to put into it. It will:
Increase binding for Pell Grants by $3.4
billion. Almost one million more students would
benefitfrom the scholarships. And we would raise
the top award to $3,128 by the year 2002.
Expand Americorps to let even more young
Americans serve their communities and go to

I don't
usually get involved in political debates, least of
all the types ofdebates that are enacted in successive issues of the Phoenix. In this instance, however, I feel compelled to speak out, even ifI must
"hold my nose" and go on.
I am a straight woman. I have straight friends,
gay friends, bisexual friends, male friends, female
friends. I was not shocked by theLBGA chalkings,
partially because I had friends who wrote the
messages. I do understand, however, the discomfort of those who were.
Homosexuality involves, by definition, sexual
activity with members of the same sex. It thereby
obviously involves licking tw*ts and kissing cl*ts,
sucking d* cks and anal sex. So why is it necessary
to explicitly describe these actions on the sidewalks ofcampus, when .any phrase incorporating
the word "homosexual" would convey the same
message? Why?Because these specific acts are an
essential part of what makes homosexuals different from heterosexuals. And heterosexual discomfort with these acts is, specifically, the essence of homophobia. The chalkings made specific references to homosexual acts.
Why are these chalkings labelled "shocking"
when the average sex scene in a movie, which
includes the explicit act of vaginal penetration, is
not?
Even more pervasive, and more penetrating
(excuse the pun), are the non-explicit ways in
which heterosexual sex is asserted. Why are these
chalkings labelled "shocking," while the image of
a woman blowing her boyfriend's saxophone in a
Newport cigarette ad is not? Why is this shocking,
while the image of phallic-headed Joe Camel
playing pool with a bunch ofbuxombroads is not?
Why is this shocking whenthe image of a Swedish
bikini team descending on a couple of men in a
beer ad is not? Whether or not these images
graphically portray heterosexual sex, you know

exactly whatacts they imply. Youknow what that
Newport lady is going to do with her boyfriend
after she puts down the sax, just as you know what
brand of cigarette she's going to smoke afterwards. You know what those guys in the beer ad
and are going to do, or want to do, with thatbikini
team once they kick back a couple Buds.
We were all produced through the act of vaginal
intercourse. For most of us, the question of where
we came from was answered at some point in our
lives with an explicit description of heterosexual
sex. The nuts and bolts of heterosexual sex are
built into our conciousness. Images of homosexual sex are notThey are thus shocking.LBG A's
chalking s were one small step towards making

gay sex and straight sex equally understood and
equally accepted. I don't doubt that every person
at Swarthmore knows that "real homosexuals"
exist here. But whether or not they are comfortable with the actualities of homosexual sex is
another question.
I personally would be uncomfortable if a person, male or female, told me that their boyfriend
had given them great head the night before. Sex is
not something that most people talk about with
strangers. However, the chalkings were not a case
of an individual telling the world "I licked c*nt
last night;" they were deliberately anonymous
descriptions, directed at no one in particular (or,
rather, everyone: both queer and straight). "Cl*t"
is NOT a "dirty" word. The phrase "Gay by
nature, proud by choice" is not a "confrontational" phrase. It implicates no one, assumes no
unlike the
positioning of self versus other
phrase "your columnist." The LBGA chalkings
no more imposed homosexual imagery on the
viewer than the average movie, advertisement, or
love song imposes heterosexual imagery. "Shock,"
my dear Mr. Stevens, is a relative term. As are the
words "eccentric" and "odd." Perhaps you should
try to approach your gay peers with a little more of
the tact that you so liberally advise them on.

makes student loans more affordable, with more
repayment options, and saves taxpayers, parents,
and students billions of dollars.
I just returned from Pearl Harbor, where I took
part in ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary
of the end of the Second World War. In the late1940s, when the veterans we honored left their
loved ones to go off and serve their country, they
were the age most of you are now.
When they came home, the country recognized
their service and their potential, and it responded
with the GJ. Bill, which guaranteed a college
education to every returning veteran. Those who
served weren’t given a handout, and they didn’t
want one. They were given the opportunity they
needed to take responsibility for their lives.
Your generation has its own battles to wage.
You face the choice of doing something right and

In taking on the responsibility of educating

Why else would I encounter George, the
over-hyped new political magazine and
persona] project of John Kennedy, Jr.,
while on line at the ten items or fewer
check-out?
There it was, the inaugural issue of the
magazine that's "not just politics as
usual," with CindyCrawford on the cover
in the guise of our first president, staring
out at me from in between TV Guide and
People. I had read a lot about it, coming
across only one positive review, but I felt
the need to snag a copy and see for
myself. For $2.931 was treated to a whiff
of the latest fragrances, a glimpse of the
hottest fashions, and a vision of the deprived nature of contemporary politics.
Most critics have attacked George as
nothing more than the latestoffering from
the vanity press. They ridicule its attempt to treat politics strictly as a popculture phenomenon and they dismiss
George as the misguided effort of a moderately-talented man floundering in the
flood of expectations that is his father's
legacy. But George, no matter how conGrants...from page 3

(Oops, your columnist let the cat out of

programs—food stamps prominent
among them—that work well and efficiently; there are state assistance programs (and all manner of other state
stuff) that resemble that proverbial rat
hole down which money is thrown.
Antipathy to Washington should not
obscure the grim truth that state legislators can, urn, do some remarkably dumb
things—perhaps the 104th Congress is
trying to bring Washington up to speed
with the nation in that regard—and that
there is nothing inherently superior about
more state administration.
Picking up the federal system and
throwing it at the states in the form of
block grants is akin to clipping one's

George, it's sad to say, seems to have a
good handle on its target audience's political sentiments.
Paging through George, one gets the
impression that politics is just another
playground for therich and famous. Not
only does George devote ample attention
to Hollywood's laughable political forays (Julia Roberts's much-criticized trip
to Haiti is given a positive spin and we 're
informed thatAndrew Shue recently met
Itzhak Rabin), but the magazine gives
fluff-treatment to actual politicians as
well. Liberal George Stephanopoulos's

is not analyzed in the context of Bill

Welfare reform of this nature is generally touted as a necessity for deficit reduction, which certainly sounds nice,
except that it requires that the nation's
welfare and unemployment situation
obligingly remain at 1994 levels forever
and ever, amen. It may do something to
alleviate the federal deficit, but running

Moreover, deficit reduction requires
sustained economic growth, and swelling the ranks of the destitute and the
homeless just doesn't sound like a way to
maintain growth. (You say you want to
hack the Department of Education and
job-training programs as well?
Hmmm...that'll take some of the bite off

there's a sudden need for uneducated,

Doing things in the name of deficit

and while cutting the deficit is a worthy
goal, there are objectives to keep in mind
as well.
It may be easy to cut AFDC and food
stamps and the like, as organized opposition is scant and scattered, but there are
real consequences—to state and local
economies, since those evidently mean a
good deal more than actual people to the

over to the states in the name of antiWashington rhetoric. Trying to solve

Over time, they will become familiar
with welfare reform and balanced budgets and social security, but these are not
the passions that drive them. Understanding these issues is the necessary byproduct of entering into politics, but,
make no mistake, concern for these issues is not the reason for their political
involvement. Members of our generation, it seems, will go into politics because politics offers fame and power; not
because they want to improve people's
lives.Which brings us back to George. I
must admit I was excited when I first
heard about this magazine. I'm deeply
interested in the intersection between
politics and culture and I thought George
might be a publication devoted to exploring this area. Of course, itis not. Politics
and culture are indeed inextricably related, but George makes thefatal error of
being unable to separate the two. Politics
can be entertaining, but it should never
be treated as entertainment a crucial
distinction George does not make.
Those few who defend George will
accuse me of being a stuffed-shirt. They
will say that I'm unable to recognize the
absurdity of politics and that I take it far
too seriously. This isn't the case. lvalue
entertainingpolitical coverage and analysis as much as any person.
One of my favorite pieces of political
writing is Hunter S. Thompson's Fear
and Loathing: on the Campaign Trail
'72. Thompson, often in a drug-addled
state, exposes the political campaign for
the ridiculous spectacle that it is. His
observations are outrageous and hilari-

ous, but Thompson never loses sight of

the fact that the election campaign is
deadly serious because its outcome will
have a profound effect upon people's
lives. Thompson can mock and ridicule
all he wants, but his writing makes it
perfectly clear that behind all of his insanity is a deep concern that Richard
Nixon will be re-elected. The ridiculous
spectacle, Thompson knows, has a serious purpose. The book is able to give the
reader a taste of the horrid nature of a
campaign while showing us the reasons
such campaigns even matter.George,with
all of its fluff, does not seem capable of
explaining why we should evencare about
politics, save for the fact that other people
seem to care about it and hence politicians are famous, thus making politics
worthy of our attention.
Perhaps George will improve as time
goes on and grow into a smart magazine
that actually contributes something to
thepolitical dialogue, but, chances are, it
will not because it does not have to.
George already has an audience, and that
audience, lamentingly, is our generation.
George has realized that our generation
worships power and fame and celebrity,
and by treating politics as a field that is
nothing more than an embodimentof that
three-headed Hydra, the magazine is catering to an established taste. Call it the
Vanity Fair-ing of politics, but George is
the inevitable answer to our generation's
conception of politics. The fact that we
can now do our "political"reading while
on line at the supermarket seems entirely
fitting and deserved.

By George, That's
Leadership For Ya
By Michael Brus

Jackie had a disdainfor politics, JFK had
just about everything politically substantive. Civil rights and domestic policy bored and annoyed him.
And he cared little about economics,
whether it be the distinction between
monetary and fiscal policy or the dichotomy between his own wealth and
that of the world beyond Hyannis port.
In light of this, why is Jackie's "passion for fashion" such a crime? I presume it's because fashion is a "superficial" pursuit, and Rosen, as The New
Republic's Legal Affairs Editor, sees his
own life's mission as a much weightier
one. Fair enough. But was Jackie's
husband any different? After all, the
35th President's "passions" were limited
to primarily: (1) sex (2) himself (3) sex
(4) the Communists and (5) sex. In fact,
John Jr. should bepraised for embracing
his mother's legacy, for while Jackie's
superficial politics of fashion were benign, JFK's similarly-shallow politics of
adultery and hubris were potentially destructive.
But that's only half the story. JFK's
true legacy actually has little to do with
his ego, libido, or military machismo.
Indeed, Jack Kennedy the person is of
a disdain for

I recently bought a magazine with
Cindy Crawford on the cover. No, I
wasn't reliving my middle school days,
when hanging swimsuit models in your
locker was as cool as living in McCabe is
now. I bought a copy of George, JohnF.
Kennedy Jr.'s chic new political mag.
What, you ask, is Cindy doing on the
cover of a political magazine? Why,
dressed up as George Washington, of
course, complete with wig, breeches.
Revolutionary general's overcoat—and
bare midriff.
(Wait a second. Since when were
exposed navels part of 18th century fashion? I know
perhaps Cindy is implying that had the founding fathers been
blessed with washboard stomachs like
she, they too would have ripped off the
bottoms of their ruffled, starched shirts.)
As you can probably tell, I will never
confuse George with American Political
Science Review. There's no empirical
analyses here, just slick features stories
on political personalities. Hence
Kennedy's mission statement for his perfume-laden, multimillion-dollar glossy:
"Georgeis a lifestyle magazine with politics at its core, illuminating the points
where politics converges with business,
media, entertainment, fashion, art, and
science. Whether it's violence in the
movies or free speech on the Internet,
culture drives politics."
Well, no one ever accused John-John
of being too cerebral. Even so, his definitionof "politics" sounds strangely ...
broad. George's contents, for example,
are divided into Features, The Art of
Politics, and The Politics of Art. Madonna, who definitely practices the politics of art (though perhaps too much of
the former and too little of the latter) was
asked what she would do were she (God
forbid) our president On her agenda:
"Howard Stern would be kicked out of
the country and Roman Polanski would
be allowed back in." This is the same
Roman Polanski convicted of statutory
rape, and the same Howard Stern that
inconveniences America by controlling
a tiny fraction of the airwaves.
Not surprisingly, this sort of well-financed fluff has sent the Washington
pundits into apoplexy. "How childish of
you to dabble in popular culture," they
impute. "After all we're talking about
thepower gamehere!" Some righteously
declaim that the Kennedy kid is just too
damn flip about The Pantheon of American Statecraft, while others call him a
self-absorbed traitorfor his refusal to use
his bimonthly as a partisan soapbox.
Jeffrey Rosen of The New Republic
embodies this snobbery. Deriding George
for "aspiring to be a cross between GQ
and CQ," he despairs that "[President
Kennedy] 's only son has squandered the
most valuable remainder of his father's
legacy. The heir of JFK is, in fact, the
heirof Jackie 0., combining his mother's
disdain for politics with her passion for
fashion."
What Rosen means by "politics" is, of
course, ideology
preferably his own.
"As the SupremeCourt and theCongress
propose to dismantle the New Deal in
front of his aquiline nose," he sneers,
"Kennedy has concluded that what
America needs most is a 'lifestyle magazine,' which he defmes as 'post-partisan.'" Overlooking that Newt and Co.
have yet to put much of the Contractinto
law near the end of their honeymoon
term, or even that certain facial features
do not necessarily obligate one to fight
for social programs, I am puzzled by
Rosen's characterization of the President
and Jackie Kennedy.
First, what's with this associationbetween President Kennedy and the New
Deal? Despite what speechwriters may
have put into his mouth at times, JFK was
hardly a champion of the little guy. If

It is actually

John F. Kennedy the legend who resides
in the public mind and who, ironically,
most resembles George's inspiration and
namesake
President Washington.
Just as George Washington defined
proper presidential decorum for the age
of aristocracy, so John F. Kennedy perfected the presidential look for the age of
television. Both men cultivated images
that, effused presence, levelheadedness,
and above all, competence. Washington
was patrician, Kennedy debonair, yet both
qualities gave them a regal aura that
transcended partisan politics.
There is a post-partisan thread that
runs through the American presidency,
from the monarchical Washington to the
worldly Kennedy to the populist present
day. And George
glitzy, cynical,
celebrity-studded—is impeccably populist. It's mission is to redefine therelationship between leadership and public
perception for this generation, much as
the father of its Editor-in-Chief did for
the last.
George, ultimately, asks this: Whither
thatregal aura in the Ageof Information?
That is, how can the modern chief executive appear simultaneously accessible and
presidential? Certainly not by discussing one's underwear on MTV. But neither by being ignorant of the price of
milk. How about a nationwidebook tour
does that toe the line? Potential leaders will continually test the waters;
George will gaugewhether they've made
a splash. Thus John Jr. embraces the
legacy of both his parents insofar as his
magazine focuses on public perception at
the expense of ideology. Wonkish journalists like Rosen will continue to attack
George as the inevitable brainchild of a
spoiled, apathetic playboy reared by a
mother more concerned with her private
wardrobe than the public welfare. I,
however, think Kennedy deserves more
credit.
Most intellectuals would never go
slumming through some of the sophomoric Hollywood gibberish John-John
serves up, but that's the point. Most
intellectuals scorned the O.J. trial, yet
that spectacle did more to shape Americans' perceptions of their justice system
thancould have all theconstitutional law
courses in academia.
This is not to discredit intellectualism,
just to point out that leadership is at heart
anti-intellectual. Which is why the scion
of America's most regal and seminal
political family is attempting to sketch a
portrait of contemporary leadership. And
why his medium
a splashy magazine
with models and movie stars
is a
welcome window into the art of politics.

Swatties' Clothes
By Leslie Hennsdorff
The S warthmore campus is oozing with
funky tattoos discreetly hidden
underneath clothes. Equally prevalent
are body piercings of all types and all
bodily locations.
Although yourbestbetfor discovering
artistic body adornmentwould be at the
next Paces party, two confessors have
come forth with tattooing stories. Scott
Reents '96 tells ofhis adventure: "I was
skeptical, but at some point, I decided
that getting a tattoo wouldbe much more
fun if I wasn't even sure that I wanted to
get one, seeing as how it's permanent and
all. So we drove into Portland, Maine,
parked outside the world-famous Portland Parlor Shop (it may have been
Shoppe, but I'm not sure), and started
browsing. We narrowed our choices to
skull and crossbones on our shoulder, or
a full-length, full-color, naked woman on
our back. Well, the skull and crossbones
cost $2O and the naked woman $2OO, so
we went with the skull and crossbones.
Happily, my mother had sent me $4O a
day earlier with a note saying, 'Treat
yourself and Blaine to something fun.'
At the time it seemed like the right thing
to do, though now I notice my mother no
longer sends me money. I look back at
getting the tattoo as the greatest thing
I've ever done, though I'm still not absolutely sure I'll want it in 50 years, so the
thrill is still there. The skull and
crossbones make me look like a bad-ass,
adding to my already intimidating im-

age. Oh yes, what does
the "Love" that's written
underneath the design
mean? Does it mean that
I love death, that my love
is poisonous, that to love
is to die, that love and
death are really the same,
or something evendeeper
and more philosophical?
Actually, it means nothing—it just seemed like a good idea."
Stephanie Bishop '96 has some different ideasabout body piercing and tattoos
(she's writing her thesis on this stuff):
"Piercing and tattoos can be seen as
intersecting with people's lives in several different domains: for example, as a
ritual, an aesthetic, a form of identity
composition, and/or a sexual enhancer.
Piercing and tattooing (S&M as well, for
that matter) increase in popularity can be
paralleled to therise of the AIDS crisis.
The common strain is the twisting of the
languages of desire and body lines, as sex
becomes dangerous and deadly. Through
action on the surface of the body one
collapses the agent and the object into
one as they become complimentary
signifiers for each other. The identity of
the body art communicates with the identity of the person on multiple levels. A
quote fromCreative Review April 1994:
'All of the people interviewed are looking for something very simple: a way of
fighting back atmass-produced consumer

Bishop relates a funny story about her
first tattoo: "It was my freshman year
here; a friendknew of a good tattoo artist
up near RISD (Rhode Island School of
Design). I worked on the design for a
fairly long time trying to get the 'perfect'
combinationof symbols. Finally, whenl
got there, the tattoo artist didn't work in
a shop, but in the kitchen of his onebedroom apartment. I was really nervous
to begin with (and sick, as I found out
later). The place I had decided to have
the tattoo was on my lower back—hence

there I am, butt in the air, as I lay on an

to the stove. Some people came in and
out during the tattooing, with my white
butt glowing in the air. When I look back
on it I feel like it was out of some strange
novel."

Devilish Denzel Gets Into Trouble
By John Derderian
Devil in a Blue Dress

(***

out of 4)

Man loses straight job. Man needs to
pay mortgage. Man reluctantly accepts
shady job. Man finds out that shady job
involves mysterious and beautiful
woman. Man gets more involved in
shady job than he wouldhave liked. Man
curses himselffor taking shady job. Man
goes on quest to free himself from the
shady job. Manenlists friend to help him
on his quest. Here you have the essential
story ofDevil in a Blue Dress, a stylish
detective mystery with a lotof new twists
on an old formula.
Adapted from the Walter Mosley novel
of the same name, the film is set in 1948
Los Angeles. The story follows Ezekiel
"Easy" Rawlins (Denzel Washington), a
fired factory worker who is desperate to
salvage the life he has made for himself.
In his midstappears the Mephistophelian
DeWitt Albright (Tom Sizemore). He
offers Easy some private detective work,
which Easy's friend characterizes as
"nothing to worry about." Both Easy and
the audience distrust theproposition, but
Easy can see no other way to save his
home. He is tasked with locating Daphne
Monet (Jennifer Beals), the estranged
lover of the mayor. Easy quickly becomes involved in a web of intrigue and
deceitwhich stretches from theback street
jazz clubs to city hall. He finds himself
neck deep in political corruption, black-

mailing, and murder.
Writer and Director Carl Franklin—whose first feature was 1992's critical
success One False Move—has created a
period piece with an attentive eye for the
recreation of the South Central L.A. locales. While Devil is standard film noir,
using many conventions of the detective
genre (protagonist narration, femme
fatale, labyrinthine plot), it is the representation of the era through a black perspective which makes this picture distinctive. The subtle observations of racism, the seductive ambiance of the jazz
infused nightlife, and the sensuousness
exuded by Easy, help the film succeed in
portraying a neglected past. The film is

both a murder mystery and an exercise in
social realism, scoring on both counts.
While the atmosphere is richly textured, it is merely a backdrop for the
marvelous Mr. Washington.
Easy
Rawlins is his best showcase to date
(matched only perhaps by his hedonistic,
pre-IslamMalcolmX). His Easy is decent
and humane, which makes us empathize
with his guilty conscience. His moral
character makes him an everyman, but
his physical presence makes him a hero.
The sight of Mr. Washington in a white
undershirt has the capacity to both make
women swoon and men run for cover!
Ms. Beals breaks no rules in her run-ofthe-mill portrayal of the woman caught
in the middle, and Mr. Sizemore acquits
himself nicely as the cocksure bastard
who likes waving a gun (a role he has

humor, sexuality, and suspense. Franklin
and Washington have found a character
and settingperfectly suitedfor theirtalents
(In fact they have optioned two of the
remaining three of Mosley's Easy
Rawlins novels, so a possible series could
develop here). The film invigorates an
old genre with a fresh perspective, giving
a little history lesson in the process.

McCabe Video Desk Pick of the Week
Kiss Me Deadly (••**). Director Robert Aldrich brings Mike Hammeralive in
this fast paced, violent adaptation of a
Mickey Spillane novel. Ralph Meeker
plays Hammer with a shocking
malevolence and brutality, deriving great
pleasure from the pain he inflicts on bad
guys. Shot in black and white, Aldrich
has woven together a remarkably taut
and engaging film noir. The much sought
after case with the mysterious contents is
the obvious raison d'etre for the
mysterious case inPulp Fiction. Made in
1955, the film is considered by many
critics to be the granddaddy of theFrench
New Wave cinema.

In a large lecture class, matters of the
heart can be, shall we say, impersonal.
So how does one get to take a bite out of
the apple of one's eye? We aim here to
dispel the notionthatthere
is no chance for love in
the academic purgatory/
oasis that is Swarthmore.
Subsequently, let us offer
a catalog of Introductory
courses and respective
ways to get more than the
academic work done.
Bio 2: Organismal
and Popular Biology:
First off, a warning
don't call this one "orgasmic" bio. The course essentiallyrequires students
to watch animals, and then
"scientifically" report.
Well, one works better in
groups, right? Right So,
introduce yourself, and
pick a nice animal, kids—bunnies or kitties;
suppress your love of "gross reptiles" or
"really big bugs."
Intro to Psychology: Another quick
don't nod your head a lot
warning
during the "Abnormal" section of this
course. In Intro Psych, you have lectures,
and then these things called
"attachments." Essentially, you meet
for 3 hours with a small group and fall
asleep in the basement ofTrotter. Play
footsie.
Intro to Econ: A caveat: "inflation"
—

is a technical term and not "something
my mom caught me doing once." Instead,
to be a "Mac (ro) Daddy," try using lines
like "supply my demand, baby" and "how
bought a little growth, sugah."
Chem 10: We don'tknow much about
Chemistry, but the CollegeBulletin says
something about "bonding theory." Ask
about practical applications.
Intro to Education: Avoid comments
like "I could teach you stuff." They say
field work is required, so work the field,
kids!
Intro English Lit. classes: All these
classes are pretty much about sex anyway.
Try "Illicit Desires" for a real doozy.
They basically let you say anything in
these classes, so try it. And isn't there a

about throwing game.

Language Intros: They're labelled
"Intensive."'Nuff said!
International Politics: If they teach
you to be greasy and slimy like real
politicians, this could be very, very
useful. Pay careful attention to any
mentions of the Kennedy family.
Intro to Philosophy: Get your hands
on as much Kant as you can. Rumor has
it that he dated Christie Brinkley and
Keanu.

Engineering 11: Physical Systems
Analysis: good stuff.On second thought,
the entire department is literally riddled
with classes about sex. Take "Fluid
Mechanics" and "Heat Transfer," for
instance. For all ofyou with a slight bent
for domination, "Control
Theory" would do you up
right.

Karsten Scherer-Nadal
Kendrew Witt

Hey wait, we
shoulda majored in this
stuff.
Computer Science:
Avoid ANY class in this
department, at all costs. It
might kill you, your GPA
and even worse, it'll kill
your game too.
Da Math Dept.: See
above. (Yet another
warning: do NOT let the
title of Math 61
("Modeling") fool you.
You'd hate yerself for the
rest of your life...)
Art History 1: Critical

book named Tom Jones! Whassup,
pussycat?
Intro to Linguistics: I think they
teach you how to say "Voulez-vous
couchez avec moi, ce soir?" Or maybe
they don't. If you major in this stuffand
say neat things in class, people might
even call you a cunning linguist.
Religion 1: Naaaaah.
Physics6: The Character of Physical
Law: So ya wanna get physical, eh? The
prof drives Porsches and Alfa Romeos,
so he could probably teach you things

Study in the Visual Arts:
If you'rereally immature,
take this class. You get to look at naked
people. If you have little experience in
this field, this will help you out. A lot.
This, dear gentle reader, is meant as a
guide of what classes to take...and how
to work 'em. You might wonder why
we're giving away the secrets of the
trade. Well, folks, we're saddened and
disillusioned to be hearing ofhowbarren

Taurus

(April 20-May 20)
Remember possession is ninetenths of the law. Thus, resist
sacrificing something you treasure
to an unreliable source. Also, don't
regret any decisions you've made
lately (even if it was to eat at
Sharpies on beef yak night). You
were using the world's best
judgment at the time. Most
importantly, resist kissing that
innocent stranger on the cheek. It
could lead to huge trouble.

for the upcoming confident phase
that will propel you toward your
most important goals.

Afro, Lenny Kravitz, and the

Inside View of Politics: Top Ten
Ways To Improve Student Council
By Stewart Plyd

Being an international student of foreign origin, I was pleased to recently
have thechance to observeS warthmore 's
studentcouncil in action. My own country
is a poor third-world cesspool of
corruption and economic decline,
seething amidst its own human
weaknesses, and I was pleasantly
surprised to find that Swarthmore's own
student council is very similar. It's good
to feel at home. However, I have a few
suggestions that I would like to make to
improve the general
functioning ofthe student council. Aside
from the obvious
("hold meetings in
OldeClub on Fridays
so the campus will
have something exciting to attend!"), there
are many more subtle
improvements that
could be implemented...
10. One common
concern of many
governments is the
controlof bribery. An
easy solution to this
isfound in third-grade
morality: "If you
bring it to class, bring enough for everyone." Each bribe should be in sufficient
quantity to "persuade" each and every
member of the council.
9. Gunz-4-Student-Council-Members:
No, that's not a band. People who paid
lots ofmoney for guns and are stupid can
trade in their guns for products of much
lower value than the guns. In this case,
each gun trades for one member of the
student council. As each member is
traded, a new member is elected in his or
her stead. A traded member has all the
rights and responsibilities normally
accorded to a gun. The guns that are
collected are distributed to members of
the Garnet Patrol to keep the guns from
ever possibly being present in a dangerous
situation.
8. The Scrum Policy: In my own
country, rugby is a popular sport. I've
been an avid fan of rugby my entire life,
and I still have no idea what the hell the
refs are thinking. I don't understandhow
the game works at all. Something I have
observed repeatedly, though, is a"scrum"

(which literally translates into "whoever

meetings to raise money (among other

is on the bottom is probably in a lot of
pain"). Anyone who has observed arugby
game has witnessed a scrum. It's a bunch
of guys (women on occasion) exhibiting
extreme precision and technical expertise
in tonal grunting. In application to the
student council, whenever more than one
opinion is expressed, we'd have a quick
scrum to speed things up. Whichever
side gets the ball gets to move the discussion in their own direction, ignoring the
weaker members of the council. If someone loses more than four scrums in one

things).
4. Forget pizza at the Wednesday night
meetings. Hand out blunts before the
meeting, then discuss and formulate
schoolpolicy. "I dunno, man, I really like
the idea of painting McCabe purple..."
4.b. Implement a Frequent Flyer
Program for those who attend the new,
improved Wednesday night meetings:
anyone who comes to more than two
meetings per month gets to kill the
annoying Swattie of their choice, then
stand trial before the O.J. jury.
3.Budget Committee is a waste of time.
Each student activity
meets at DuPont
Field, where the
groups do battle with
Sharpies meatloaf
("rock-hard to the last
bite") and a few stale
bagels. The last group
standing gets the pot,
plus a victory kiss
from Al Bloom.
2.5. Implement a
speech code: Every
third word spoken by
every student must
with
rhyme
"pulchritudinous".
Students who don't
obey get their asses shipped home.
2. Reduce the numbers on the student
council to one: Me.
1. Three Words: Dash for Cash

meeting, the rest of the council gets toeat
that member. In a few weeks the meetings would run like clockwork.
7. Weed Out TheStupid: I don'tknow
how you woulddo it, but it sure would be
great

6. Name That Candidate!: The Party
Advisors at each party approach one
randomly chosen Swattie and interview
him. If that Swattie can name even ONE
person on the student council, or can give
a general idea of what the student council
did in the past decade, that Swattie wins
a free trip to Columbia.
Typical dialogue:
PA: "Hey Swattie! Can you name
something implemented by the SC in the
past year?"
Swattie: "Beer?"
PA: "No, that's SAC. Name something
implemented by the SC in the past year,
and we'll send you to Columbia!"
Swattie: "Marry joo wanna?"
PA: "No, that's PPR..." etc. etc.

bit We watched the first one, Miller's
Crossing, earlier this week and it was
quite a thriller for you mob-type movie
fans. Starring Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay
Harden, John Turturro, Jon Polito, J.E.
Freeman, and Albert Finney, this film
tells the story of fights between rival
crime bosses in an unnamed town during
the prohibition era. Tom Regan (Byrne)
is an advisor to a crimeboss Leo (Finney).
The film begins as rival boss Johnny
Caspar (Polito) and Leo feud over a
bookie who has cheated Caspar while
Regan attempts to make everyone satisfied. Regan then finds himself in the
middle of a war between the bosses that
is filled with interesting twists. It's great
to see the way the mayor and chief of
police are depicted as pawns of thebosses,
and the acting is really pretty good. I
enjoyed the story, but was a little
dissapointed by the ending. I'm not sure
what I would have wanted instead, but
when it was over, I went "hmmm...."
Kate: I'd have to say that, as far as
gangster movies go.Miller's Crossing is
a good one. I liked the characters, I liked
the dialogue, the cast is great, and there
are a few creative plot twists. The fact
that it's written by the Coen brothers,
Joel and Ethan, is reason enough to see
this film. (They're also thebrains behind

Thanks to the huge bulletin board on
Parrish Ist, Jewish students on campus
know where to go if they're looking for
support, religious services in both Hebrew and English, and kosher Shabbat
meals on Friday nights: to Ruach,
Swarthmore's main Jewish organization.
Emphasizing a mixture of the spiritual
and the social, Ruach has close ties to the
national Hillel.
"For Jewish students Ruach can be a
vehicle to having a fuller Jewish Me, be
it spiritual, intellectual, or social,"
explained Mara Landers '97, the
Administrative Coordinator and a
memberof the nine-memberBoard. "For
non-Jewish students, Ruach offers an
opportunity to learn about Judaism and
Jewish life."
Ruach's main activities each week are
the Shabbat services and kosher meals
served from thekitchen in Lodge 5 every
Friday night. Elizabeth Weber '9B usually leads services, which she describes
as "amalgam of Reform, Conservative,
and Reconstructionist services." There
is also Parscha, in which a sectionof the
Bible is read and discussed every week.
For example, this week's Parscha is
Deuteronomy 32:1-32 and Samuel 22:1-

51.

Lately, however, the organization's
mainfocus has been the High Holy Days
of Rosh Hashanah, on September 27th,
and Yom Kippur this past Wednesday.
For Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New
Year, Ruach sponsored greeting-card
making in Parrish Parlors and cards
distributed to every Sharpies table explaining the significance of apples and

honey. For Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement, Ruach celebrated a special
"break-fast" after sunset. The members
also organized and supervised the transportation of students to local synagogues.
Upcoming holiday celebrations will include abuilding of an outdoorsukkah for
Sukkot, a Hanukkah party, and a first
night's seder, plus an eight-day kosher
co-op meal plan for Passover.
Ruach also sponsors many social
events: the occasional dance or party in
collaboration with SASS and HOLA, a
traditionalannualfield trip with students
from Bryn Mawr Haverford Hillel, and
Speakers on issues of local or national
interest. "There will be at least one, maybe
two, faculty-student discussions this
year,"said Board Facilitator Ben
Thomases '97; professors Emily Passow
and Nathaniel Deutsch have already
agreed to help lead such discussions.
Israel-related newspaper articles and
events often appear on the aforementioned bulletin board; Ruach is closely
associated with the Swarthmore Zionist
Association, whichkeeps a close eye on
events in the Middle East and works to
support Israel.
"Ruach is not an organization that tallies its membership," saidLanders. The
number of members can vary greatly,
depending on the eventWeberestimated:
"There are usually 10 to IS people at
Friday night services, and another 10 to
IS people join us for dinner
some
people come every week, some every
few months.I'd guessthat 30 to 40 people
join us for one meal, all of their meals, or
somewhere in between during Passover,
and there are also a few people who join
us only for the High Holidays or the
Hanukkah party... Everyone is always
welcome at Ruach events."
So why should students join Ruach?
"I, as somebody who became a member
of Ruach during my first semester at
Swarthmore, view membership as an
opportunity to be a part of a kind of
community that can be hard to find," said
Thomases. Weber emphasized the
group's dynamic quality: "We really are
the driving force behind Jewish life on
campus." Anyone who wants to join can
contact Ruach through Landers, Naomi
Michlin '9B, or Nick Lehmann '97.

Evil Buzzards Fall
Prey to Kutztown
By Tony Sturm

handling a kick. They ran it into the By

After losing badly to Princeton a week
earlier. The Evil Buzzards were anxious
to avenge that loss last Sunday. They
would have to wait another week, however, as Kutztown came to Swarthmore
and beat the home team 25-12.
There is a lotofbad blood between the
two teams.
Three seasons ago,
Swarthmore beat Kutztown in a close
game. The next year, Kutztown sent
theirB -side squad, which was dismantled
by theBuzzards. The next time the teams
played, Swarthmore barely pulled off a
victory, and a fight ensued after the game.
It was rather apparent from the game
Sunday that the teams had not reconciled. Several scuffles ensued throughout the match. Early in the second half, a
more major fight started. The referee
called captains from both sides asideand
ordered them to keep their team in line.
Kutztown was a big team with a lot of
size, but not much speed. Many of their
players were penalized for punching and
kicking and stomping on ankles throughout the game. Only five minutes into the
game, one of their tight five was thrown
out of the game and given a three game
suspension for punching a Swarthmore
player away from the play.
Prop John Kowolski, '99, making his
first A-side appearance, contributed
nicely while playing the entire game.
Also making his a-side debut was Tony
Sturm'99.
Kutztown scored first on a chaotic
play when a Swarthmoreback had trouble

zone, and the kick was converted.
Kutztown padded theirlead to 10-0 when
they scored on a penalty kick from 40
meters away.

Swarthmore answered when Mark
Pletcher '96 made a good kick and
Swarthmore recovered it very close to
the try line. A few quick passes were
made, and Tom Hooper '96 dove across
the line for his first career score to make
it 10-5. The conversion was missed.
Kutztown responded with two more
scores before Swarthmore was able to
answer. The final points scored by Swat
were a result ofanother penalty. Midway
through the second half, ChazTeplin '96
broke free from the pack and raced into
the open field with the ball.
Upon confronting defenders, Teplin
pop-kicked theball forward, and appeared
to have the clearest path to the ball and
the try zone.
Teplin never reached the ball, however, because he was tackled from behind by a Kutztown defender. Inrugby it
is illegal to tackle a man who does not
have the ball, andbecause of the circumstances, a penalty try was awarded.
Unfortunately for Swarthmore, it was
not enough to keep them in the game.
In the B -side game,Swarthmorecould
only field 13 players, so they played a
completeKutztown squad two men down.
The Buzzards didnot look too bad in the
match, but Kutztown dominatedmost of
the game, winning 24-3. The lone points
scored by Swarthmore were a result of a
penalty kick by Sturm late in the second
half.

Rough Week for Women's Soccer
By John P. Simon

Starting the week with a 1-7-1 record
and 0-2 in the Centennial Conference,
the women's soccer team desperately
needed a positive result to help turn their
season around.
Unfortunately, hard timesfor the team
continued as they dropped two games,
one to Western Maryland 5-1 and the
other to Cabrini College 4-1 in overtime.
On Saturday the Garnet Quakers suffered the cruel fate of having to travel to
the middle of nowhere. Western Maryland, to play their third league game.
Western Maryland is one of the better
teams in the Centennial Conference and
displayed theirconsiderable skill by running to a 3-0 lead by the half.
In the second half, the Garnetcame out

firing and closed the deficit with a goal
by Sarah Jaquette '97. She volleyed the
ball from outside the eighteen yard line
into theupper portion of the goal on what
one teammate called "a beautiful shot".
This goal gave the Garnet ahint of life,
but it was only a flicker as Western Maryland scored two late goals to send Swat
home with a 5-1 loss.
Tuesday afternoon, the Garnet Quakers hoped to beat up on Cabrini. This
game promised to be a close one as both
teams came into the game with similar
records. The records didn't lie because
this game was a nail biter until the very
end.
After a scoreless first half. Swat got on
the board first on a goalby Claire Baxter
'9B. Baxter, a defender, volleyed the ball
into the top of the net for her first colle-

giate goal.
Swat often has had problems this
yearholding onto second half leads, and
in this game they demonstrated more of
the same trouble. Cabrini managed to
push home a tying goal that forced the
gameinto overtime. In the thirty minute
overtime period, Cabrini totally dominated, scoring three unanswered goals to
cruise home with a 4-1 overtime win.
The loss dropped the Garnet to 1-9-1 on
the season.
This week Swat takes on Dickinson
Collegeaway on Saturday, and Drew on
Thursday. The team has spurts when
they play well, but they lack the overall
consistency that it takes to bring home a
victory.
Hopefully this week they will pull it all
together and play a strong 90 minutes.

Women's Rugby Accepts a 0-0 Tie
By Jen Philpott

Swarthmore's female ruggers traveled
to Millersville University in Millersville,
PA last Saturday to play an important

divisionalmatch. The gameended in a 00 tie, leaving both teams in an ambiguous
position in their bid for the Divisional
Championships in October.
The women's rugby team was "playing hurt," so to speak, when the game
began, and was even more hurt when the
game ended. Senior fly half Rebecca
Cole could not play due to a shoulder
injury from a previous game, and was
very capably replaced by Katie Laird
'96.
The back line was rather patched together from the start of the first half.
Then, at thebeginning of the secondhalf,
a key back line player, Liza Bonilla '9B,
took one too many hits to the head and
left the game. Players were shuffled
around and the team compensated for the

loss, but some back line momentum was

lost
The forward pack was similarly affected by injuries. Senior prop Margaret
Cohen was playing with a painful knee
injury which slightly impaired her speed.
Heather Goff '96 started herfirst game at
prop, but was quickly moved to her old
position of eight when second row, Julia
Kernochan '9B, took a hit to the nose and
bled profusely. After Kernochan left the
field holding a towel to her broken nose,
Andrea Johnson '9B moved to second
row and Goff moved to eight. Freshman,
Annie Bacon, made her A-side debut in
the prop position.
Given all of this shuffling of players,
the forwards still played a tough game
and were able to win every scrum. Marcy
Governale '96 played an amazing game
at hooker, and stole or won almost every
hook in every scrum. Kelly Shannon '96
and Hanan Hussein '97 also played very
strong forward games, making many key

tackles and getting to every ruck first.
The first half was dominated by
Millersville, even thoughthey could not
move the ball beyond Swarthmore's 22
meter line. The team's were evenly
matched, butS warthmore quickly learned
the reason for Millersville's first half
dominance whenthe teams switchedsides
of the field for the second half— the field
was on a slope and S warthmore had been
fighting uphill the entire first half.
The B-side played a good game and
gained much more experience than they
did in last week's game against Rutgers
University. The back line, particulary
Courtney Clark '9B at fly half and Beth
Vose '99 at inside center, played well
and put together quite a few good lines.
After some initial scrumming dificulty,
the B-side forwards played a good game
as well.
Swarthmore will be on theroad again
tomorrow to play Scranton University at
10:00 AM.

Frisbee Teams Play Tough Games
By Jcnnl Anderson

The Men's Ultimate Team played their
first official league game this past Sunday against University of Pennsylvania,
on our own Mertz lawn. The first scheduled game was against Princeton last
week, but the opposition forfeited the
win to Swat's Swarming Earthworms.
Though the Earthworms put up a good
fight, the University of Pennsy lv ania team
was comprised of a strong bunch of players, and ended up winning the game 1710.
Swarthmore'scaptain,Dave Lewis '97
viewed the game not as a loss, but as a
learning experience. "They had a very
experienced team, and over half ours is
made up of rookies. We showed much
improvement, considering this was our
first game against another team. There
are, of course things we can work on."
Thursday's game against long-time
rival Haverford was a bit disappointing,
though as John Rieffel '99 points out, "It
was Ultimate Frisbee at its best. People
were diving and sliding everywhere in
the mud and rain." After a 5-1 lead by
Haverford at the beginning, Swarthmore
rose to the challenge, and were on a
comeback until the game was called off
due to darkness. The final score was 117, in Haverford's favor.
This week promises to be an exciting
one for the Earthworms. For the weekend, the men will troop down to Delaware to trounce their opponents in
Sectionals. With each game, the men's
Ultimate team garners more experience
and confidence in their level of play,
therebycreating a force with which to be
reckoned.

By Jennifer Z. Chen

This past weekend, Swarthmore's
Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team beleaguered by illnesses and other factors
limped into Drew University to play
in their first inter-collegiate tournament
on Saturday and battled against University of Pennsylvania's Venus thefollowing day.
The Swarthmore War Mothers (represented by just seven players on Saturday)
competed in three matches, in which they
won one and lost two. This lackluster
performance was by no meansan indication of the War Mothers' frisbee throwing ability. Rather, the fact thatthe War
Mothers had only seven players at the
tournament in a sport thatrequires seven
players from each team to be on the field
at one time, and the fact that one of the
players sprained her ankle half way
through the second match, contributed
greatly to the disappointing record in the
Drew tournament.
The War Mothers played their first
match against Rutgers University, which
has one of the best Women's Ultimate
Frisbee Teams in the country. "In the
first half, we were really intimidated,"
Leslieanne Yen '9B admitted later. "But,
we did get three points in a row against
them, which was probably the best anyone did against them in the whole tournament." The War Mothers emerged from
that game with a score of 13-3.
The next opponents that the War Mothers encountered were from Drew University. Being a young and inexperienced
team, Drew proved to be an easy match
for the War Mothers, who won with a
score of 10-3. Although this game could

be considered an easy victory, the
Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team lost
Sarah Knudsen '9B, one of their key
players, to a sprained ankle.
Playing with one woman down, the
War Mothers competedagainst Princeton
University's team, which had a copious
supply of substitutes waiting on the sidelines. Princeton won this match by a
small margin, but nevertheless, the War
Mothersremained optimistic about their
performance. "We had Princeton tied 33 at one point," Mandie Hourihan '9B
commented. "I was really surprised that
we could do that."
Over all, the tournament was a learning experience for the WarMothers. Gabi
Kruks-Wisner '99 summed up the tournament at Drew, "Even though playing
savage seven put us at a disadvantage
physically, it helped us mentally. By the
end of the day, we had really come together."
The next day, the War Mothers faced
Perm's Venus on Mertz Lawn. The fatigued players showed up energetically
against Penn in a tough loss (9-7). Cocaptain Lena Loe wen thai '97 commented
on the game as being
a frustrating loss
because we were ahead 7-5 at one point,
and I think we had a mental block against
holding onto our lead. It didn't help that
our big-time players Erika Baumgartner
'9B and Becca Nef f '97 were sidelined by
feverish illness."
The War Mothers will compete in their
sectional tournament on the lawns of
SwarthmoreCollegethisweekend. Hopefully, a more mature and healthy team
will win this weekend's tournament and
advance to the October Regional Tournament in North Carolina.

games.

On Saturday, the men played a team
that has become their nemesis as of late,,
the Red Devils of Dickinson. For the past
two years, a better Swarthmore team has
not been able to beat Dickinson. This
past week, the string continued as the
Garnet fell 2-1.
If games were won by the team who
played better, Swarthmore would have
walked away as winners. Unfortunately,
it is the scoreboard that ultimately decides thevictor. Swarthmore completely
outplayed Dickinson in every aspect of
the game, outshooting the RedDevils 174. Asked why the team lost, and Alec
Stall '9B replied with three words with
which many team members agreed with:,
"We couldn't finish."
After allowing two quick goals in the
first half, the Garnet dominated,but could
not find the back of the net. Kyle Barnett
'97 claimed, "It's tough to lose a game
like that. We were obviously the better
team and should've won." Junior Dave
Lane added, "We had so many opportunities to score, but [we] were just extremely unlucky."
The Garnet knew they had to build
from the loss, and came out roaring against
Eastern on Monday. The team was really
fired up to avenge the loss and played
great team soccer. New starter Austin
Harris '99 made a great first impression,
scoring two goals. Lenny Cuello '96
scored the other goal as the Garnet won
3-0. The bench played a strong game, led
by first-year player Ricky Phillips, a senior who decided to come out for the
team this year.
Carrying the momentum of the victory, the men were eager to face Wesley,
a relatively weak team. The Garnet once
again played a strong game in running
away with a 3-1 victory. Dave Lane '97
remained on his torrid scoring pace by
scoring two goals. Fellow junior Kyle
Barnett netted his first goal of the season
later on a controversial play. After taking
a pass from Stall, Barnett beat a sliding
goalie on a nice shot. However, on his
follow through. Stall accidentally kicked
the goalie in the head, resulting in a
dramatic bit of acting by the opposing
coach. The ruckus ended when the referee shouted to the coach, "Go to your
bus!"
While the opposing coach watched
from the Greyhound, the Garnet took all
the starters out and played the backups.
According theB arnett, "The benchplayed
another outstanding game. It was really
good for them to get qualityplaying time.
They played as well as the Wesley starters."

Women's
X-Country
By Danielle Wall

This past Saturday at Rose Tree Park,
the Swarthmore women's cross country
team proved that they are a true threat to
the other members of the Centennial
Conference. So far this season, thepower
and talent of the Amazon women have
gone unnoticed by those important and
well-informed professionals who create
theconferencerankings. After Saturday's
invitational, however, theseofficials can
no longer feign ignorance of the up-andcoming Garnet Tide.
Overall, the Swat Lady Harriers captured second place with a total score of48
points to Allentown's winning score of
44 points.
This week the Swat pack was led by
Shoshannah Pearlman '9B. In a stunning
display of strength and perserverance,
Pearlman ran for a seventh-place finish
with a time of 20:14. Following closely
on her heels was the legendary Becky
Riskey '9B, earning a ninth place finish
with a timeof 20:19. Solai Buchanan *96
busted-out for a fine performance, crossing the finish lane in tenthplace. Danielle
and Ingrid
Wall '9B, DanielaLearner
Spies '96 exhibited stellar stamina while
securing 15 th, 16th, and 18th places, respectively. Once again, studly Frosh
Jessica Lane proved her worth to the
team by finishing seventh for Swat and
26th overall.

The Phoenix

Field Hockey
By Jean Quinn
The Held hockey team continuedtheir
domination of their opponents on the
field, racking up a recent win against
Gettysburg, 3-2. Swarthmore, 8-1 overall, is undefeated in the Centennial Conference (4-0) with half the season's conference games remaining.
Gettysburg was considered one of the
better opponents in the league. "They
were a strong team," according to Sam
Peltz '97, who scored 2 goals in the
match. "Gettysburg knew how to take
their free hits quickly, and they had a
couple ofbacks whose drives were really
good," she said. Added Jennifer Hagan
'99: "Gettysburg was a quality team that
worked well together. Their passes were
precise, their stick skills were excellent,
they were constantly stopping all the
balls headed their way,"
Gettysburg was not strong enough to
stop the onslaught of Swat's offense,
though, as the Garnet led throughout the
game. Peltz's described her first goal as
a "hard drive from outside of the circle
that a Gettysburg defender actually deflected in past her own goalie." The second was "a tip-in from a cross pass from
the right hand side of the field." Donna
Griffm '99 scored the third Garnet goal.
The Garnet dominated the game and had
the ball in their offensive zone more
often than the squad from Gettysburg.
Every victory of this close-knit team is
the sum total of every individual's hard
work. It is difficult to find a player who
does not praise the diligent contributions
of her teammates. Hagan was the most
recent member to praise her fellow field
hockey players. "Sam Peltz continues to
amaze me with her ability to constantly
feed theoffense with her forceful drives.
Kelly Wilcox saved the team several times
during the game, effectively stopping the
attacking Gettysburg team. Donna Griffin, Lurah Hess and Danielle Duffy
proved to be quite the assets to the team
by keeping the ball down with the opponents' defense. Holly Baker and Lia
Ernst controlled the midfield and were
responsible for dominating the bewildered Gettysburg team, and Erin Flather,
Michelle Walsh, and Lynne Steuerle terminated many Gettysburg attempts at
scoring drives," said Hagan.
Team members tried to explain the
difference between the Gettysburg match
and last week's tough loss to Wellesley at
the Seven Sisters Tournament. Said Peltz,
"We were fresh going into the Gettysburg
game. When we played Wellesley, we
had had two hard games the day before
and we were tired. Also, though
Gettysburg did have some strengths as a
team, I don't thinkthat overall, they were
as skilled as Wellesley." Swat did not
view the game as very difficult. They
seem to have quickly risen to a higher
level of play and continue to exceed the
skills of their foes.
Swat's next major game will be against
Dickinson. In the past, Swarthmore and
Dickinson have had quite competitive
matches. This year should be no exception. Both teams are undefeated in conference play, with the winner likely to
finish in first place.

SPORTS FEATURES
Volleyball
Wins Three
By David Lischer
After out-battlingWashington College
in a marathon five game match, the
women's volleyball team has inched
closer to evening its record at .500. The
victory over Washington was their first
conference victory, against three losses,
and has extended their winning streak to
three straight matches.
Overall, the Garnet are 4-6 (1-3) and
have positive momentum heading into
one of their most important weekends of
the year. The team will travel to Boston
to compete in the Seven Sisters' Tournament hosted by Wellesley. There they
hope to improve on last season's sixth
place finish.
In the first game of the Washington
match, the Garnet blew a 14-10 lead as
Washington rolled off six straightpoints.
However, they rallied right back in the
second game capturing a 5-0 lead on
strong serving by Marcela Escobari '96
and Holly Barton '99, whohad two aces
during therun. Washington tied the score
at 7 by outlasting the Garnet in several
long rallies. Then two kills by Barton and
an ace by co-captain Diana Bieber '96
launched the Garnet to a 15-9 win.
The thirdgame followed apattern similar to the second. The Garnethad an early
6-1 lead, but Washington battled back to
close the gap to 9-7. At this point in the
game, Nancy Rosenbaum '96 turned the
tide. A kill by the co-captain broke a
three point Washington streak. She then
combinedwith Jordan Hay '9B on a block
to give the Garnet a 10-7 lead, turning the
momentum in Swarthmore's favor. A
Barton ace broke the Washington spirit,
and the Garnet finished the game with a
commanding 15-7 final score.
Early in the fourth game it was evident
thepattern was broken. A combination of
Washington snapping out of a funk and
the Garnet slipping into one made for a
lopsided game. Washington blockers stymied the Garnet hitters and soon it was
11-2. Yet they almost blew the lead. It
was 11-9 whenthe Garnet were unable to
keep their rally going. A succession of
mishits and tough Washington serving
ended the game 15-9.
The fifth game seesawed back and
forth as the teams were never separated
by more than three points. It was played
under rally scoring rules, where a point is
issued on every play. Fittingly, a Garnet
ace by Deena Bahri '9B ended the game
and the match 16-14.

A Panel Discussion on the Admissions Process

SwarthmoreCollegebaseball will have
a new look this year with coach Brad
Hoffman taking over the reigns as head
coach after justtwo years as an assistant.
Hoffman replaces the legendary Ernie
Prudente, a former fixture on the diamond.
The abbreviated fall season has given
CoachHoffman his first look at many of
the players who will form the core of the
team this spring. Hoffman has very large
shoes (size 14, in fact) to fill after taking
over the head coaching role from the
retired Prudente. John Crawford has
joined Hoffman this fall and served as a
batting and outfield instructor. Both
graduates of the class of 1993, they may
provide the spark the team needs to realize its full potential.
If the team's work ethic this fall is any
measure of Hoffman's coaching ability,
then the team will be in excellent hands.
"Consideringit's thefall season, wehave
accomplished a lot at practice in terms of
strengthening our fundamentals. Coach
Hoffman has done a good job organizing
the practices and determining which aspects of the game need the most work,"
said second baseman Jeremy Bonder '97.
"I think it will be a great season."
The addition of two promising rookie
pitchers, David Giles '97 and Ben Sousa
'9B, has significantly strengthened the

veteran staff, led by Chuck Hudson 96,

Pat Straub '97, Sam Voolich '96, and
David Lischer '97. The catching duties
will be shared by Andrew Clayton '96
and Paul Krause '96.

Rodner '96 and Frank Santora '96 will
patrol the outfield with JeffSpritzer '96.
Additionally, the return of senior Brian
Luetke from Australia will add to the
speed and power of the outfielders.
In their first game of the fall season,
the Garnet played solid all-around. Disregarding one bad inning, the team played
even with a local semi-pro team. Considering that most of the team spends time
on the gridiron in the fall, the baseball
team appears to be stronger this year.

Featured Athletic Personality:
Soccer Coach Cheri Goetcheus
By Rachel Gutman

Cheri Goetcheus fell in love with
S warthmore at first sight in the spring of
1992;she's been loving it ever since. As
an assistant professor of physical education and head coach of both women's
soccer and women's Softball, she has
become an important part of Swat athletics. She describes her experience here
these past few years as "excellent."
"When I first came here, I found that the
people are sincere, friendly and willing
to help me out. The students are a pleasure to work with and are also challenging. They keep me on my toes and
motivated intrying to meet their expectations. S warthmore is a really nice place
to work."
Goetcheus erew ud in Tolland. Connecticut. She received her bachelor's
degree at Ithaca and a master's degree in
teaching and coaching analysis.
Goetcheus has been involved with sports
since juniorhigh school, whereshe played
field hockey, basketball, and Softball. As
a junior inhigh school, she started to play
soccer instead of hockey, and in college
she continued to play soccer and Softball.
Goetcheus chose to go to Ithaca because
they had a music major, and she thought
that's what she wanted to pursue. She
figured if she didn't like it, or failed some
music classes she could lean back on
physical education. She actually did quite
well in her music classes, but decided to
study physical education anyway. Her
first job was at a junior college in upstate
New York called CantonTechnical College. She worked therefor seven years as
an associate professor and coach of
women's soccer and Softball. In the
spring of 1992, Goetcheusrealized that
she was ready to move on; her job at
Canton had become stagnant. She applied to about 25 schools for positions.
Swarthmore advertised for a soccer and
Softball combined position that seemed
pretty open-ended. She didn't even know
where Swat was; but shelooked ona map
and saw that it was near Philadelphia, so
she thought the job would be hard to get.
But they offered it to her, and she fell in
love with Swat at her first interview and
accepted the position.
Goetcheus generally has a very laid

back coaching style. She "used to be a
type-A personality," but she changed and
adopted a new philosophy. Now she
feels that winning is just "the icing on the
cake." Her goal is to help the athlete
improve in her sport and feel good about
her accomplishments, as well as to grow
as a person. She feels that especially at
Swarthmore, athletics should be enjoyable and an opportunity to be successfula diversion from "everything else."
The one thing Goetcheus wouldlike to
improve is the understanding between
thefaculty and coaches. The students are
often in a bind between academics and
athletics; they want to do both. Some
professors think that they are the only
professors and so they assign great
amounts of work. It can be difficultand
unfair for the athletes. However, academics and athletics can bebalanced by
someone who is organized. Some people
play two or three sports and also do well
academically. It just takes organization
and desire.
Goetcheus feels that the sports facilities are "outstanding." Other schools
have complimented Swat on the facilities, especially the playing fields which
are diligently attended by a wonderful
crew of people. The one thing that
Goethcheus looks to improve is the fitness and nautilus room, for the teams and
just for general "wellness."
Cheri is very excited and anxious about
this year's Softball team. There are some
good freshman that have already begun
to practice.'They're very gung-ho."
"We've struggled in past years with low
numbers but this year looks hopeful."
The women's soccer team is currently
struggling. Their record is 1-10-1 and
the team just has a "difficulty with putting the ball in the net" As Goetcheus
says, "Someone just has to step up and
score. It's frustrating for the women that
put in so much effort and time and get no
payback. Sometimes, as a coach, I just
don't know what to say. It's an especially hard time now with midterms. The
players are stressed and not getting much
sleep. They can't always focus. I just try
to motivate and focus the women and get
them to play aggressively. The players
really try hard and are very committed
and supportive of one another. So I'm

still optimistic. We now know where we
stand and where we need to go; we still
have seven games left to play."
Aside from coaching, Goetcheus is a
Boston Red Sox fan. She also enjoys
listening to music (all kinds except for
country "twang-twang"), watching movies, and reading. Her new "baby passion" is working out.
Goetcheus lives right in town and she
loves the peacefulness and serenity, as
well as the proximity to Philadelphia.
"The campus offers a lot to do, and the
town is nice and quiet."

Nancy is an amazing all around athlete and is a great leader for the
women's volleyball team. Because of loss of personnel from a year
ago, Nancy was asked by the coach to switch to middle hitter, an
unfamiliar position for the senior. 'What she lacks in height for a
middle hitter, she makes up for in her vertical jump. In last week's
wins over FDU-Madison and Neumann, Nancy totaled twenty kills
and seven aces. Against Washington, Nancy played strong throughout the grueling five gameset. For her efforts, she was named to the
Centennial Conference honor roll.
