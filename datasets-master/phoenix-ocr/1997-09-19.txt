In the fall of 1996, Aaron
Marsh '9B began volunteering
his time to help PC users on
campus hook their computers
up to the college network. Over
the course of the year, he
helped 30-35 people with the
installation of Ethernet and
Windows '95, and connected
them to the college servers. A
few days ago, however, Marsh
resigned and will no longer be
available to help campus PC
users. Although Swarthmore is
Macintosh-dominated, there
are currently over 100 PC users on campus who are now left
without a support system.
Marsh was involved in the
effort to install Ethernet on
campus two years ago and said
that because he "felt a responsibility for those who were so
close [to getting connected],
yet so far," he started taking
calls from students whoneeded
help with their PCs. But helping students could take anywhere from half an hour to four
or five hours per person, depending on the work that was
needed and the complications
of the PCs. Nonetheless, his
support was invaluable to users. Jessica Sonnenschein 'OO,
a PC user said, "If Aaron hadn't
been my dorm consultant and

I didn't have a friend [who
knew about PCs], I wouldn't

As this year's freshmen arrived'on campus, Marsh's voice
mailbox was filled with requests for help in a matter of
days. He said that his schoolwork was beginning to suffer
and that, although his decision
to resign his services "was a bit
impulsive," he had to do it simply because he didn't have
enough time to respond to all
the requests.

When Vincent Jones '9B, Treasurer of
Budget Committee (BC) sent out an allcampus email offering a "bribe" to any student group which was willing to give up
its meeting space in Sharpies on Sunday
evening to BC, all he wanted to do was to
highlight the urgency of their situationand
solicit a quick response.
BC is scheduled to meet on Sundays between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Jones had
tried to make reservations for Sunday

night—which is when BC traditionally
meets—in the middle of the first week of
school, only to find, much to his surprise,
that all the rooms had been booked. "Usually groups don't get their act together so
soon," said Jones. Room reservations in
Sharpies are dealt with on a first-come, firstserve basis.
The new meeting time "precludes several
members from serving on the committee and
makes it impossible for many group treasurers to request money due to religious (and
other) reasons," according to the email. Simi-

larly, other meeting times during the week
would conflict with Jones' and other
member's schedules.
What Jones had in mind as a bribe, however was not money, but a handful ofchocolate-filled gold coins.
So he was both pleased and slightly amused
when he received a reply on Monday from
DESHI, the College's South Asian Students
Association and one of the three groups who
had made reservations for Sunday evening—the other two were CaritasChristian Community and Swarthmore African Students Asso-

ciation (SASA)
saying that they would be
willing to "sell" their meeting time for $350,
subject to negotiation.
Before sending out the email, Jones had
tried to persuade the three groups which
held reservations for Sunday evening to
give up their time slots, but he met with no
success.
At that point, Jones decided to pursue an
alternative strategy. The prospect of a
"bribe," he thought, would capture the at—

has scared the long lines away? Still
we are pleased that overcrowding
doesn't seem to be a problem so far
this year.
Since Sharpies seems to be running
well, this seems to be a good time of
year to discuss the fairness and efficiency of the meal plan. For many of
us, eating at the Tarble snack bar is a
necessity from time to time, usually for
thepurpose ofsaving time.But thinking in financial terms, not all ofus can
afford to eat there.
The difference between the price
ofa meal at Sharpies (which is paid
at the beginning of the semester as
part of the meal plan) and its meal
equivalent at Tarble is typically a
few dollars at dinner. Where does
this money go? Hopefully it is regenerated into other sectors of the
college to fund other programs. But

With the current status of the 14

Letters

to the Editor

SAC should not fund alcohol use or at least provide alternatives
To the Editor:
Allow me to relate to you an experience I had this evening.
It was 10:30. I had just come
back from a play in Philadephia,
and I was thirsty. After the drink
machine in my dorm ate my remaining cash, I thought to myself
"Where can I get something to drink?"
Then, suddenly, it hit me... "Hey, it's
after ten on a Saturday night, there must
be a party going on somewhere!" So I
figuredI wouldride the shuttle to campus, see what parties were going on,
get something to drink and hang out
for a while.
When I got to Paces, I heard music playing, and I saw people walking out with beverages. This, I
thought, must be a good omen. I
walked inside, and I surveyed the
crowd. People were packed into
the room and everybody was dancing. Folks seemed to be enjoying
themselves, and everybody was
holding either a glass bottle or a
plastic cup. Seeing this, I felt certain that I would soon be able to
procure a beverage for myself. So

I walked up to the person who
seemed to be distributing the beverages and I asked him for something NON-alcoholic...
Wait... I forgot to mention, and
this is important for our story- I
don't drink. For one thing, I (like
the vast majority of students at
Swarthmore College) am not oflegal age to drink in this state. Furthermore, I don't have any desire
to drink. It's just not my scene.
Anyway, back to the story...
There I was, thristy as hell, and I
had asked the guy for a non-alcoholic beverage. Upon hearing my
request, this guy looks at me for a
moment-he was clearly amusedand he says to me: "There's a water fountain right outside."
I immediately walked out of Paces.
As I walked back to the rose garden to catch the last shuttle home,
I thought about my little adventure.
Something didn't seem quite right:
How could it be that at a SAC
funded party, there could be an
abundence of alcoholic beverages,
and abolsoutely nothing else.

There wasn't even anything to eat.
No food, no soda, no OJ, no K 00l
aid, no Yoo-Hoo chololate, just
booze for the folks who drink. And
for those who don't, there's the water fountain.
I am not a prude, all right? I don't
care if people drink. It doesn't matter to me. But what happened at
the SAC funded party thisevening
was not only grotesquely unfair-it
was WRONG. And it wasn't an
isolated occurance either; EVERY
SINGLE SAC FUNDED PARTY
I have ever been to has been EXACTLY THE SAME (with one
lonely exception, a WSRN party).
All the food and the non-alcoholic drinks have always run out by
the time I show up; But there is
always plenty of booze.
I don't think I need to convince
you why someone needs to put a
stop to this. It seems pretty obvious doesn't it? These parties
should be for everyone, NOT JUST
DRINKERS. Whatlwant-theonly
thing I want-is to see some good
old fashioned AUTHORITY im-

posed upon the people who are
breaking the rules on a weekly basis. I don't think it would be too
hard to stop students from using
SAC funds to buy booze. But if
you really can't do that, here is
what I suggest:
Establish a rule whereby any
party that serves alcohol must also
serve food and non-alcholic drinks
as well. If, at any point, the latter
runs out, then the former can no
longer be served. With this rule in
place, it will be rather easy to see
if folks are follwing the rules.
Hell, I'll even be your official
"Party Narc." If I walk in, and it
turns out that there is plently of
booze but virtualy nothing else then
I will contact SAC and the people
running the party in question will
be obliged to refund some portion
of the SAC funds they used out of
their own pockets.
This is, I realize, an extreme measure. But it will work. If you don't
like my idea tho, by all >means,
come up with something else that
works. Ultimately, I don't care how

Dedicated Volleyball team should be given more consideration
To the editor:
We are writing in regards to some
concerns that we have about the
volleyball team. Although this letter is a bit long, we would very
much appreciate it if you would
take a few minutes out ofyour busy
schedule to read this over. Thank
you.
Since the first day of practice four
years ago, volleyball has been an
integral part of our Swarthmore experience. The hours ofpractice, the
thrill of competition, the
comraderie of the team—all have
meant so very much to us. And
nothing would please us more than
to have a super season in our senior year. Fortunately, that seems
to be an attainable goal. Our team
is filled with dedicatedand talented
women 4hat sincerely care about
the sport and we have already surpassed the skill of last season's
team. Furthermore, there is still
much unrealized potential residing
within our players. However, the
school, particularly the athletic department and the administration,
has made it difficult for us as a team
by the decision to replace the gym
floor. Although it is wonderful that
the gym is finally being renovated,
the fact that the construction is occurring during our season is quite
upsetting. Even more frustrating

and infuriating is the suggestion
that volleyball is less important
than basketball—the floor should
be ready just in time for basketball
preseason. The Swarthmorean system of Quaker values, with its emphasis on equality, has been shamefully transgressed.
We have always stood behind
Swarthmore and are very proud of
our school, but we have been rather
disappointed by the aforementioned decision. And since no effort has been made by the administration or athletic department to
offer any kind of apology or even
explanation to the volleyball team,
we are forced to draw our own conclusions. The conclusion that we
have come to is that the school is
more concerned with earning
money from the various summer
camps than about a varsity team
comprising its own students. We
had always thought Swarthmore
to be a school that cared about its
students, and thelack of respect our
team has felt from the athletic department is very disturbing. We
realize that Swarthmore has to be
run as a business in order to continue to offer a superb education,
but there are times when
Swarthmore as a school should be
put first.

We are currently having practice
from 5:30-7 am—meaning we
wake up at 4:30 am each day. In
order to get 8 hours of sleep, we
would have to be in bed at 8:30 pm,
practically an impossibility at this
school. First, Swarthmore is an
academically challenging school
that expects over 100% from its
students, and going to bed so early
is difficult. Additionally, a number of our members are active in

other extracurricular activities,
many of which hold theirmeetings
late in the evening. And have you
ever tried to sleep with music blaring from every direction? Quiet
hours don't begin until around 11
pm. We have several players who
are ill and have not been able to get
better because of the lack of sleep.
Others are having difficulty with
keeping up with work and staying
awake in class. The dedication our
members have to the team and the
sport is absolutely amazing. We
have numerous times heard from
our fellow students that they simply couldn't do it, yet our team consistently shows up at 5 am.
We realize that the gym is in the
process of being redone and that
little can be done about that now.
What concerns us most now is the
lack ofregard for our team. No rep-

resentative of the school bothered
to inform our team that we would
not have a gym floor to practice on.
If another team had not informed
us of the gym floor renovation, we
would have been in for quite a surprise on the first day of preseason.
Furthermore, the athletic department continually told one of our
captains that everything would be
fine and taken care of, but that was
not the case. We showed up at Widener to practice on the first day of
our preseason, and the Widener
team was there, expecting us to
scrimmage. We arrived at the
Healthplex for practice at 5:30 am
Monday, September 8 and were
told that we weren't supposed to
be there until the next day—the
floor was being refinished. Miscommunications and mistakes on
the part of the athletic department
have made a trying situation even
more difficult and frustrating for us,
and have also made us feel inconsequential and brushed aside. We
give our all to the team and the
school, and this kind of disrespect
is inexcusable.
We thank you for taking the time
to read over our concerns and hope
to hear your comments.

millions of Black and Latino families and individuals. Several states,
such as California, plan to deny any

But this current tactic in the war on
drugs (which should be named a war
on Blacks and Latinos because its
fought primarily in neighborhoods
with a high concentration of poor
people of color) has drastic implications, especially when one considers incarceration and poverty statistics among these groups.
For instance, police spend more

Now I'm sure that other factors
color the decision of law enforcement to focus primarily on predominandy lower income communitiesof
color. Nonetheless, one cannot ignore the questions raised by such
actions and feel comfortable with the
unequal justice which results.
To make matters worse, those
most affected by the so-called war
on drugs often overpopulate the
lower socioeconomic strata. Thus,
a high proportion of this population receives or received federal
aid for a variety of reasons. Our
nation shoulddo all that it can to curb
drug use, especially among young
people, but does revoking much

If anything, it would seem as if it

Police: In the right
by Christine Leahy

Last

weekend I was riding back
to my dormitory when, regret
tably, the driver made an im
proper turn, unnecessarily
wide and without a signal. So
it was no surprise that the Swarthmore police pulled us over. An officer approached
the car, asked for identification, registration and proof of insurance, and then explained why we had been stopped.
When backup arrived, another cop noted
empty shotgun shells in the car's trunk. Proceeding with caution, they asked us to step
out of the vehicle as they searched for a
weapon. The driver reassured that his shotgun, for which he had a legal permit, was
not in the car. Furthermore, he volunteered
that the empty shells had been collected so
as to not pollute his hunting grounds.
After a brief inspection, the officers repeatedly explained that they had probable
cause to search the vehicle: first, because
of the traffic violation and second, because
potential evidence was in plain view. In
fact, the backup officer apologized for the
inconvenience, while the other officer

merely issued a warning.
Two Swarthmore students, who were observing the excitement at what they presumed to be a safe distance, approached
us after the officers left.
"What are the Swarthmore police up to
this time?" one of them asked sarcastically,
as if their supposed intellectual haven is
impervious to crime.
We explained the situation as thoroughly
as possible. Offended at the idea that they
searched the vehicle, his friend protested:
"They can't do that."
I corrected him: "The police may search
your car if they have probable cause, which
was doubly provided in our case."
But he insisted: "They have to impound
the car," and later explained that this meant
it had to be towed somewhere. Anywhere.
Just not on this campus. Not where a bunch
of recalcitrant liberals are exerting their inalienable rights.
When I offered the fact that a car may be
searched on the shoulder of a highway, his
friend retorted that the car could be impounded there if the officer"fills out a piece
of paper." Relentlessly and in vain, I tried
to convince them of their misconception.

DEA officials targeting college
campuses? Granted, drug abuse
does pose a problem in most urban
areas. However, I would bet that
similar amounts of drugs can be
found inside the ivory tower as in the
deteriorating cores of our nation's
cities. Most of the law enforcement
officials went to college and should
have seen the rampant drug use first
hand. I bet that the prisons would
better reflect our nation's racial and
socioeconomic diversity if college
campuses were targeted just as much
as the inner city in the war on drugs.
Yet something tells me that this
would never happen. Despite the
heavy volume of drugs in both environments, one thing separates
the two. Inner cities tend to be
predominantly Black and/or
Latino, and lower income,

One of them, haughty and indignant, sauntered off while yelling: "ACLU all the
way!" although no civil rights had been
violated. In fact, the officers were protecting the students' safety, as innocent bystanders, as well as their own.
To set the facts straight, the Supreme
Court ruled in Delaware v. Prouse (1979)
that officers may search an automobile if a
law is being broken. The United States v.
Raw (1982) grants them permission to search

Opperman (1976) gives them further right

the legal definitionof "impound" is to "seize
and take into custody of the law or of a court."
For pragmatic reasons, the fourth amendment is not literally interpreted. It is debatable whether current search and seizure laws
allow for social control ofindividuals without the violation of freedom. But this was
not what the students were arguing. Rather,

we are unable to express anything but polite niceties. The gag on honesty pervades
many aspects of Swarthmore life, and nowhere is it better illustrated than in that last
bastion of truth: the press. At Swarthmore,
we find that the people organizing lectures,
sitting on the committees, and facilitating
groups are our friends. This is the inevitable
result of living at a school of only 1,300+
people— you are bound to know a lot of
them, and you are bound to find someone,
somewhere, that you like. When this
miracle occurs, we are unwilling to be honest for fear of loosing or offending a friend.

One

of my main goals on
campus thus far has been
to offend as few people as
possible while not ignoring my beliefs. With junior year, I'm seeing the light: I've failed.
In a last attempt to keep the career path of
diplomacy open to me, I will maintain that
my failure was, in many ways, inevitable.
What is most unfortunate about offending
people was (and I'm afraid still is) not the
unpopular connotation it loans to my name,
but rather the effect that offense has on the
expression of this campus.
For fear of insulting and angering each

a drug addiction will still be poor
and have an addiction without any

After that basic introduction, the journalist spends a few hundred words searching
for meaning where there is none, so that he
may write about it in his article. The writer
then ends the article with two quotes, one
positive and one negative, regardless ofhow
many people express one side or the other.
By following the above formula the article
in question becomes space filler designed to
win friends and influence people.
These articles exist as a voice of what
we already know— that the person involved in the organization is a very
nice person who has worked hard. The
rampant nicety in lieu of honesty was well
exemplified earlier this
year in the September sth issue of the
Phoenix. It contained a front page story illustrating my point. The story, entitled "Wet
and Weary, Orientation a Success", expresses not a single view of orientation as
less than the idyllic time that so few in reality and hindsight remember it being. The
article enumerates the new orientation ideas
and weather difficulties associated with this
year's orientation; not mentioned were the
disappointing aspects of the rain including
that it interrupted many of the CA groups
on their trust walks, causing them to scatter and never meet up with the rest of their
class. Instead of this criticism, the article
included a vague statement from an upperclassman organizer about how difficult it
would be to know how successful orientation week was.
The Phoenix does not hold the monopoly
on my criticism. The September Bth issue
of the Daily Gazette ran an article entitled
"Linda Chavez-Thompson Addresses Students." The article discussed for three paragraphs the various topics under Ms.
Chavez-Thompson's lecture, and finished

law and general distaste for authority.
For the sake of argumentation, one might
go the extreme by prophesying a slippery
slope: Allowing officers to search automobiles without being issued a warrant inevitably leads to absolute power ofthe state. However, I wouldcontendthat the opposite is true.
It is not compliance with the law, but rather
being unaware of one's rights that allows for
abuse of power and greater tolerance of police brutality. Hence, the ignorance of a few
leads to the detriment of many.
What I find most disturbing is that these
students demonstrated the pervading attitude of Swarthmore to challenge authority
blindly. Such mindless revolt is typical of
those fighting a system without understanding how it operates, and never considering
why. The instantaneousdismissal of external authority is superficial and trendy at
best. This collective paranoia, a cliched Us
vs. Them mentality, is probable cause for
rebels without a clue.

Thompson
the article with two quotes, one from me
expressing my disappointment with the lecture, and another expressing a positive
view. While this may be seen as balanced
reporting, it may also be seen as an easy
way to appear to be showing both sides
while relying on one person to represent
the views of an unknown number. I am not
suggesting that every member of the college be polled for their opinion, merely that
if the opinion is expressed more than once
(as I was assured my view on this lecture
was) that prevalence of opinion is reported.
As a conservative on campus, I don't mind
being cited as "In the minority, Hillary Thompson '99 felt that..." However, if by any
chance I'm in the majority, I'd like that acknowledged also. Quotes exist to be representative or illustrative, not to bear the entire burden of dissent without introduction
or indication of prevalence.
I respect the work that goes into bringing a speaker, setting up orientation, and
similar activities. The negative reaction, or
the reporting of a negative reaction,
should not be taken as an invalidation of
the work that any group put into the
event. Indeed this reaction is necessary
for the improvement of events, as well
as the continuation of dialogue about the
events, which after all, are not intended
to exist in a vacuum.
In the same way, I respect the amount of
work that goes into writing an article. I
urge, however, that the work would be lessened greatly if the writers allowed themselves the freedom of honesty. Journalists
are supposed to "call 'em as they are," if
you will, and without this, thePhoenix risks
becoming merely another promotional
flyer, though published and posted after the
fact. A newspaper of promotional flyers is

In short, America needs to deal

Why
beer is
bad
By Benjamin Chan

Before

I begin, I must say that I
would never have had the courage
to write this piece had it not been
for Salmon
successful evasion
of the Mark of Death. Still, when I contacted Mr. Rushdie and asked him if writing such a piece while living on a college
campus was wise, he called me a "madman" and promptly hung up. Therefore, I
■shall proceed carefully.
Beer, and other forms of alcohol, are not
that bad. Just the other night I was playing
chess against my friend Rick, who is of
roughly equal chess-playing ability. Rick was
"totally ripped" on his carefully crafted
vodka-and-pink lemonade cocktails, while I
had the misfortune of having my senses
dulled by a television strategically positioned
across the board from me, and behind my
opponent. The inebriate trounced me in consecutive games. So liquor is clearly not as
bad as "Third Rock from the Sun."
From the standpoint of the carpet outside
our hall's bathroom, however, beer is considerably worse than "Third Rock." While
"Third Rock" has been known to cause
vomiting on occasion in the past year, it
has nowhere near the reverse-peristaltic
potency of alcohol. That stuff is supposed
to stay in your stomach, and this is one of
the reasons that beer is bad.
Beer is also bad because beer-drinkers are
loud & obnoxious, usually after they've had
a few beers. This is of great importance to
me, because I sleep in a first-floor room
with three windows. Prior to guzzling three
or four Buds, few people would feel the
need to say, "my butt is sweaty and it
itches." After a few drinks, not only will
one say this, but one's tipsy companions
will be intensely amused and begin emitting loud, piercing guffaws which are not
conducive to a non-inebriated person's
sleep process. Sleep is good. Beer is bad.
I know what you're thinking: "But beer
is fun!" Well, fun is good. Fun is even better when you can remember it the next
morning. Okay, not all alcohol consumers
have prolonged blackouts. Perhaps a couple of
beers loosens you up a little bit and lets you
have some fun that you can remember, which
is the experience of most students. It certainly
does not, in my experience, act to expand your
consciousness. I like to quote Richard Feynman
on his aversion to drugs: "I love to think, and I
don't want to screw up the machine." While
you probably won't "screw up the machine"
permanently by casual drinking, you will screw
it up at least temporarily. Frankly, my machine
is screwy enough so that I don'tneed the extra
help of a special blend ofbarley and hops.
To review: Gastric juices inside your
stomach are good. Gastric juices on carpet
are bad. Sleep is good. Drunken laughter
that interrupts sleep is bad. Most importantly:
mind is good, beer is bad. If you didn't find
this amusing, have a few beers and try again.

tention ofthe entire student body, and
not only the leaders of various groups

but also the membership would become aware of the situation. "If the
leadership of the groups didn't want
to discuss it, the members could bring
it up," remarked Jones.
In his email, he wrote, "Budget
Committee is willing to give a handful ofmoney to the first group which
agrees to give us their reservation.
In other words, we're offering a
bribe. At this point, the amount of
the "bribe" has not been decided but
we're willing to negotiate. We have
never offered a bribe for anything
else in our history but we feel that
this matter warrants such a move."
Jones' main intention was to demonstrate how desperate the committee was. "It's like we're saying, we're
to
almost
do
willing
everything...anything within our
laws [to get the room]," said Jones.
He felt that he had left enough clues
in the email to indicate that it was a
hoax, pointing out how he had painstakingly put "bribe" in quotation
marks and used the phrase "handful
of money," when BC usually issues
all its payments with checks. "I felt
it was ambiguous enough so it could
be understood [the way I intended it
to be]," said Jones, "but it still said
what it wanted to say."
According to Giridhar Srinivasan
'9B, who was chosen as the representative ofDESHI to negotiate with
BC, the group needed the money to
cover two unplanned events for the
upcoming year. They were hoping to
bring both Shabanah Arani, a famous
Indian actress and journalist Chitra
Raghavan —who had gained fame
through her reporting on a financial
scandal implicating former Indian
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi—to
campus. Both of the prospective

speakers will be traveling to New
York over the course of the year. The
$350 would only barely cover the
transportation costs and the cost of
snacks and refreshments after each
event, claimed Srinivasan. "We
didn't want to pressure the BC too
much," he added.
After receiving the email, Jones
promptly replied explaining his situation and offering to "increase" the
"bribe" with an all-campus study
break thrown in honor of DESHI. He
also assured DESHI that BC would
take into account their "gracious act"
and "look more favorably" upon any
"reasonable proposals" they submit
in the future.
DESHI agreed to his terms this
Wednesday. A Daily Gazette article
published on Tuesday claimed that
the organization had already accepted the offer when in fact it was
still in the process of deliberation,
making it hard for them to say no,
according to Reena Vaidya 'OO, copresident ofDESHI. Prachi Patankur
'OO, the other co-president, also cited
Jones' promise that BC would lean
in favor of future proposals put forward by DESHI a reason behind the
final decision.
Jones downplayed the "bribery"
aspect of the deal. The money for the
study break will be coming out of the
BC office budget, he sa"id, which
pays for office supplies and the food
and refreshments served during annual budgeting sessions. While BC
will keep in mind what DESHI did
for them, no "special privileges"
would be granted, but rather the budgeting process would be "less bureaucratic" for the group.
However, Jones did concede that
theemail couldhave easily been misconstrued. "I can see how people
would feel that it was inappropriate."
"But sometimes you gotta do what
you gotta do," he said.

Linda Chavez-Thompson
By

Dan Fanaras

The recent strike by United Parcel Service
workers protested the shipping company's practice of hiring part-time employees in place of
full-time employees who receive comprehensive benefits and a higher salary. Led by Teamsters President Ron Carey, the strike succeeded
in creating 10,000 new full-time jobs at UPS
an apparent victory for organized labor.
But did the strike have an effect on the rest
of the American labor movement? "Definitely"
says Jessica McFarland '9B who represents the
Student LaborAction Group (SLAG)." 185,000
people walking out on their jobs is an incredible event," states McFarland, an honors Phi-

losophy major. She feels that major companies
have been sent a message that "part-time work
isn't enough" and that their underemployed
workers need job security.
UPS, the nation's largest shipping company,
is still recovering from its loss of business to
other carriers including the U.S. Postal Service.
McFarland is bringing news of the current
labor movement to the Swarthmore College
campus through a series oflectures and workshops, sponsored by the William J. Cooper
Foundation and SLAG, along with the History
and Political Science departments.
Linda Chavez-Thompson, the executive vice
president of the AFL-CIO and first person of
color elected to an executive office within the
organization, was the first lecturer in the threepart series. Last Friday Ms. Chavez-Thompson spoke in the Cinema of the Lang Performing Arts Center to a packed room of students,
faculty and staff.
A self-described militant, Chavez-Thompson
commented on the UPS strike by asking "why
should a part-time job pay half the wage of a
full-time job for the same level of work?" Supporting her claimthat workers aren't being paid
adequate wages, she stated that although
worker productivity across America has increased by 24 percent, real earnings for workers have fallen by 12 percent.
Ms. Chavez-Thompson also urged students
to "join our fight to achieve economic justice"

by participating in the Union Summer program
and acknowledged the students in the audience
who previously participated in the program.
Union Summer, funded by the AFL-CIO, has
given 1500 college students the opportunity to
get involved with labor organizing for the past
two years through its national campaign.
McFarland, who recently completed a summer with the United Farm Workers (UFW) in
New York City, also participated in the Union
Summer program last year in San Jose. Organized labor forces businesses to treat their workr
ers "with dignity and respect," says McFarland
who fondly recalls her Union Summer experience.
The American Labor movement will be addressed again in the upcoming weeks, during
the last two installments of the Cooper series
which will again be held during campus collection. The next lecture will be on Friday, September 26, given by Professor Joel Rodgers,
who is a professor of political science, law and
sociology at the University ofWisconsin-Madison. On Friday, October 31, Professor Nelson
Lictenstein, a professor history at the University of Virginia, will give a talk entitled "The
New American Labor Movement: Learning
from its History." Both lectures will begin at 1
p.m. in the Cinema of the Lang Performing Arts
Center and will be followed by a panel discussion at 4:15 p.m.

coach has fallen victim to the less-than-ideal
surface.
The rigorous schedule of their morning practices has also taken its toll physically on the
team members. Many have become ill, making it hard for them to focus on their academic
work.
The coach was given several options by the
athletic department as to where and when the
team could practice instead of the field house.
The team voted in favor of the 5:00 am slot at
the healthplex since other available times in the
afternoon conflicted with the lab sessions of

certain members. A new floor had also been
laid down in the healthplex recently.
The team currently only has three home
games scheduled, a great disappointment to
many of the seniors on the team who were hoping to have their friends watch them play for
the last time. The team has maintained a positive outlook on their situation though. "I think
that this will affect the morale of the team in a
positive way, making us closer that we ever
have been," says Hay. The team won its first
game last night in a grueling five-set battle with
Widener, 17-15, 9-15, 15-11, 16-18, 15-12.
Their record for the season so far is 1-2.
President Bloom said he was prepared to

work with the team on the issue. "I apologize
for the college," said Bloom, and I will help
find a way to ease the problem." Bloom has
proposed extending the dinner hours at Tarble
for the team and giving them a greater credit
allowance to make the 4:30-6:30 time slot at
the healthplex more attractive.
Bloom eagerly anticipates the impending
completion of the new floor. "I am really looking forward to the impact that the floor will
have to volleyball and other sports in the future," said Bloom, "The new floor will be a
wonderful recruiting tool showing student ath- 1
letes that we are serious about both volleyball"
and basketball."

have answers, having never heard their
story, will build resentment. To go in identifying yourself as other... you have drawn

VC: The one [goal] that I'd speak most
about is the development and publicizing
of the open house for the Lang Compete
tion. For the first time this upcoming
spring, any Swarthmore student will have
the opportunity to apply for Lang funds to
do a community service project. Previously, just those that had been admitted as
Lang Scholars had the opportunity to have
access to approximately $ll,OOO in pro-_
posal and enrichment funds to do that type
of service. $ll,OOO is a lot of money. I
know a lot of people who have to wait for
either job opportunities or other financial
types of windfalls to be able to do that
while... still a visionary in developing those
types of understanding of self, of community, of others. Any Swarthmore student
can have access to that funding in an open
competition this spring, so advertising and

of those students will get the opportunity
to use that I find very exciting.

As a result, there are no names Marsh
can refer PC users to, and those who

The most difficult part about PCs is
that most require the purchase of
Ethernet cards in order to be hooked up
to the campus network. The PC has to
be opened up, the card installed, and in
some cases, additional software needs
to be installed as well. PC use is "not
extremely difficult once the Ethernet is
set up," said Sonnenschein, but she did
cite many difficulties she and other PC
users ran into including "not being able

Beardsley (a problem that Marsh said he'
has attempted to rectify), not being able
to get any software, and not being able
to take work from the computer lab

The result of Marsh's resignation is
that PC users have to search for support
on their own and try to combat the in-,
conveniences of being in a predominantly Macintosh environment. "I wish
somewhere in between a safety net had
been built... but it just doesn't exist now,"
said Marsh. He did, however, express
some optimism toward the future of PC
use on campus— "I think [that] a change
is coming. Between the dissatisfaction
of students and what is happening to

Premiere
List exhibit

What

I have learned is to distrust
intellectualization. I need to
confront my subject matter directly, in all its complexity." These words
were from Richard Upton at an exhibition
of his work at the List Gallery on Septem-

ber 11.
His drawings and paintings of Italy and
Ireland, which makeup his current exhibit,
reveal his philosophy. His art manages to
encompass an incredible sense of space in
a small frame; Upton does not try to simplify through rationalization the complexity of nature. At his gallery talk, Upton
told a story that explained the small size of
his art. He remembered his father trying
to fit eight-foot paintings into their car and
asking "Why the hell do you make such
big paintings?" At the time, Upton had
launched into a discussion about abstract
expressionism in response. However, years
later, he asked himself the question again.
"I began hearing these voices," Upton
said, twirling his index finger in a circle
by his temple. "I began to question all the
authorities I had allowed to become authorities for me....The experience about
sizc.is not necessarily tied to the bigger
the painting, the bigger the experience."
, Upton's statement is evident in his paintings. By painting within a space of Bxlo
inches, he heightens the intensity of his
paintings. Created with thick layers ofoil
paint, they are rich in texture and color. The
brushstrokes are clearly visible on the canvas; they range from short dabs to longer
angular and wavy lines. There is a sense
of quick motion in Upton's art, which may

your last significant
other? Was he addicted to love?
Was his name Jones? Probably not.
But this week, ifyou want to bring back that
feeling that you lost in Top Gun, you might
want to try Addicted to Love or Love Jones,
or maybe you just want to try your luck in
the Crum with that cute first-year.
Love Jones is set in an area of Chicago
where it rains six days a week and African-Americans have no problems getting
taxis. Young poet/author Darius Lovehall
(Lorenz Tate) encounters gorgeous photographer Nina Mosely (Nia Long) at a beat
poetry club; he woos her, wins her, and then
struggles to keep her. Unconvinced of his
sincerity, she considers going back to an
earlier beau and later dates his somewhat
obnoxious hearse-driving friend Wood
(Bill Bellamy); he, not sure of his love for
her, sees other women and refuses to call
her on crucial occasions.
The plot hinges on those phone calls that
Darius and Nina refuse to make, times
when they inexplicably leave one another,
well-meaning but bad advice from friends,
and all the old, contrived plot elements of
a romance. You know they're destined for
one another, and, sure enough, despite a
breathtaking point near the end where the
movie threatens to break out of its mold
and become something new, Darius and
Nina end up kissing in the rain. Sure, the
characters are witty, the poetry sparkles
occasionally, and the leads are damned
good looking, but what does Love Jones
do that no other film has done, except have
an all-black cast?

(no delivery yet). For a restaurant that put
so much work into its decor, however,
Cheng Hing remains mediocre when it 11
comes to food, serving up cuisine ranging 1 (

from fair to good nothing outstanding.
Dishes sampled during a recent dinner
varied within that range. The fried pork 1

steamed vegetable dumplings, with their 111

chewy. The hot and sour soup, as described 11

The greatest discrepancy, however, came 1S

A
place really in the Ville?
Upon entering Cheng Hing, there is a
sense of modernness and elegance to the
one-room restaurant that is immediately
apparent. A wooden-paneled facade
complements pastel-colored wallpaper
■ and soft green carpeting. Black lacquer
■ chairs and speckled green tabletops, each
with a thin vase of real flowers, are illuminated well by three chandeliers and a
number of spotlights. Waiters hurrying
back and forth provide for a somewhat
rushed feeling though table spacing is
roomy. The dark white ceiling is pleasing
to the eye, making the mood in the dining
room pleasant.
As one of Swarthmore's only full-fledged
restaurants, the opportunity for the Cheng

college students is certainly there. The prices
are on par with similar, neighboring Chinese
restaurants, and its location —on Dartmouth

Geneva

Above: Geneva,

Their new and only
album cover tries to
make a statement.

by

Josh Kramer

The name conjures images of lakes (we
don't have any here),
peace talks (we've got a
lot of talks, but hardly any
peace) and, for me, at least, a picture of
Andrew Montgomery and his new Scottish
sensation, Geneva.
Geneva is a recent introduction to the US
rock scene, having started theirfirst US tour
just recently. They are already on good
footing in the UK, where one of their
singles, Tranquilizer, broke into the top 30,
and the album "Further" is already making a splash.
Geneva's sound, both live and recorded,
has a distinctive mix of a number of different influences. Some of the guitar themes,
especially those on the intro to Best Regrets sound as strummy and intense as the
Jayhawks, while the hard guitar rock and
vocals of such songs as Further and the God
of Sleep sound like a cross between
Radiohead and Ash. The band's live sound
was even a step beyond what they have on
their CD
while Montgomery did not
have the tonal perfection on the high vocals he has in the studio recordings, obviously, the live performance seemed like a
group experience with the crowd of 100
mostly standing for Geneva, the second
opener, a significant difference from the
reaction to the first band. All of this was
due to Montgomery, who was clearly not
only the band's leadman, but also its only
personality; everyone in the room knew
who was wearing the pants in this band.

And well deserved pants they were. Without showmanship, Montgomery took songs
that sounded heartfelt, specifically Tranquilizer, and added a true flair for performance. From "you hold your breath, and I
hold mine" to the last heartfelt "let's be
happy while we're still young," Montgomery maintained the tone of the piece pernot easy with a
fectly in mannerisms
tune as diverse as tranquilizer.
the
Just one negative comment
Trocadero staff, even though our promo
tickets were a little on the quick and dirty
side, were really, really rude. Unless they
get The Prodigy or Aphex Twin down there,
the Troc has lost at least one customer- Me.
if the guy's got a
(Hint to Troc staff
dictaphone and a notepad and is standing
around looking impatient, the $l4 you're
out is negligible.)
All in all, if you've got musical tastes like
mine
you followed the Spin Doctors/
Blues Traveler boat for a little bit, you've
got everything Radiohead ever made and at
least some of the Trainspotting soundtrack
made your day—l'd say Geneva is a must
buy, especially if you want to be ahead of
the trend I see at least a good US single out
of Tranquilizer, and possibly even more.
I give Geneva a 8.5 out of 10 for live shows
(Phish, they are not, but much better than,
say, Smashing Pumpkins live) and a 8 on
the CD, which I'd rank about at the level of
Pablo Honey without "Creep" in terms of
musical quality, but with a really, really good
video of Tranquilizer on the enhanced partition (PC and Mac compatible.)

Cheng
Hing:

be explained by the fact that he tries to
work with more intuition than reason. At
his gallery talk, Upton saidthat he asks himself: "How do I get to see the landscape
through the spectacles ofinnocence?"
His drawings, which are composed of
graphite and paint, have the same sense
of motion. Many of them seem abstract
or realistic depending upon the distance
from which the viewer sees the picture.
Art, to Upton, does not "lead to one conclusion or truth about things."
Upton's work is a journey, according to
Andrea Packard, director of theList Gallery. After separating from his wife, Upton
began working with Artists for the Environment. The personal upheaval and new
work made him begin to question what he
had been taught as an abstract expressionist. Also, his father died, which led him
to journey to Italy. Since 1982, Upton has
traveled to the hills of rural Tuscany every year to study the landscape. He has
created more than 200paintings, drawings,
and monotypes from this intense exploration of a particular area.
Upton has received awards from many

what bland, but otherwise filling. The
saut6ed string beans in a rich brown
sauce, were average-sized but good,
while the Moo Goo Gai Pan was
soggy, almost syrupy, and not too flavorful. The white rice, though hot,
was not sticky enough. Dessert consisted of juicy seedless oranges and
packaged fortune cookies.
To the restaurant's credit, in addition to offering standard Chinese
fare, the menu also lists some inventive dishes not often found in
suburban Chinese restaurants. A
choice between chicken, pork,
shrimp, and vegetable dumplings,
for example, is a welcome treat,
while Stuffed Phoenix (chicken
breast stuffed with crab meat and
shredded pork) and Sea and Earth
(scallops and beef with mixed vegetables) sound appealing. What's
more, the restaurant goes so far as
to offer eight different tofu dishes
and nine different soups, including
the much sought-after chicken corn
(or, if you prefer, crab meat corn).
If that isn't enough, lunch specials

make taking an inexpensive break
from Sharpies more than justified.
It's disappointing that the Cheng
Hing doesn't yet deliver, but in the
meantime, students have other options for delivery. China Moon, in
Morton, and the Secane Panda, in
Secane, offerfree delivery to campus,
as long as the order totals at least eight
or ten dollars, respectively. Ifone should
feel the need to seek out a nearby competitor (that also doesn't deliver), one
can take a stroll up to Olde Classic, located in the OldeSproul shopping center, across the street from the Springfield Mall on Baltimore Pike. Olde
Classic, with its visually-stimulating
Chinese decor, is nice to look at, but
the food is slightly less satisfying
than that ofCheng Hing.

Overall, the prospects for Cheng
Hing look good. While the food
leaves something to be desired, the
restaurant is clean, service is quick
and friendly, and the location can't
be beat. If the craving for a brief
immersion in Chinese culture
should arise, a half-hourride on the
R3 into Philadelphia's Chinatown,
which offers a plethora of restaurants from which to choose, is the
way to go; if time or travel costs
are an issue, Cheng Hing will fit
the bill for a pleasant, satisfying
meal, just steps away from an
understocked and over-pressured
dorm room. The Cheng Hing is
open until 10pm on Sunday, 11pm
Monday-Thursday, and midnight
on weekends.

Which is not to say the movie
isn't enjoyable; it's a great date
movie, and an interesting look at
the things people say—and don't
say—to their friends. Tate and
Long have nothing to be ashamed
of, though their characters' actions
can be hard to understand sometimes (why does Nina, a smart
black woman who clearly wants
little to do with men at the start of
the film, allow Darius into her
apartment after she rejects him and
he steals her address off of one of
her checks? Did the word "stalking" never come to mind?) and the
supporting actors are mostly
good, including Isaiah Washington as Darius's cynical friend
Savon and Lisa Nicole Carson,
who appears onscreen far too infrequently, as Nina's friend Josie.

Tennis serves it up
By

Laurie Smith

The fall season for women's tennis had a
rocky start with their match last Thursday,
losing 1-8 to Millersville University.
Freshman Jennifer Pao had the one win
within the six singles players and three
doubles teams on the ladder last week, a
feat which excited the entire team. Her rigorous two hour match gave the team new
energy and hope for the season ahead.
The loss to Millersville didn't come as a
big surprise, though, considering that it is
a Division II school.Coach Dan Sears
hopes that playing hard teams will help
them as they advance into their normal season in the spring.
This semester, with only four scheduled
matches and two tournaments, is more a
■time to "get to know the incoming players
and get the team reacquainted with the tennis rackets," stated sophomore Sara Coe.

"We lost a great player this year, and we
thought it was going to make a big dent in
the team." With the graduation of last year's
number one singles player, Michelle
Martinez, thereturning players' concern for
the upcoming season included questioning
who was going to become the new leader.
"We're all going to try to fill her spot together," said Coe. The atmosphere during
practice is definitely one of fun and hard
work, as the five returning varsity players,
four freshmen, and two transfer students
get ready for their match on the 25th, their
last home game this season.
When asked if she felt last week's match
brought down the team's spirits, Coe replied that "we're just going to try our best
and not get down on ourselves." With the
spring season somewhat off in the distance,
the team can take this time to strengthen
themselves physically as well as mentally
in anticipation of what's to come.

It's September Ist. Courtney

Becky Snyder '9B (the forward captain) look upon the glorious sight
before them: 34 chiseled women
andashortmustachedman. However this new team differs from its
predecessor: it's faster, it's stronger,
it responds to a whistle.
This whistle is being blown by
Alan "You Da Man" Matas, the
new coach for the women's rugby
team. A former coach at the University of Delaware with 23 years
of experience under his belt, Alan
generously volunteers his time to
the Swarthmore women ruggers
because he sees the team's potential which has yet been unrealized.

While this group of women has
never experienced the guidance of
a coach, the Swat women have
blossomed under the expertise and
leadership of Mr. "You're On My
Time" Matas.
As lady luck would have it, the
women's team welcomes back
many members of its undefeated
squad. And even luckier is the fact
that they are initiating 17 rookies
to the sport. The season is long and
promising with 9 weeks ofmatches
ahead. They open their season this
weekend with two away games
against Lehigh University.
Unfortunately, the beginning of

maining players found themselves
wondering if they would be able to
field a team at all, much less a competitive one.
It seems as if the rugby gods have
been listening to the Evil Buzzards'
prayers, because this season has
produced as rich and promising a
crew of rookies as any in recent
memory. Led by senior captains
Dan Barrick and Chris Jahnke, the
team has been running, passing,
rucking, and tackling for three
weeks in preparation for the first
match of the season. Barrick will
be leading the backs from the position of flyhalf, as Jahnke, at wing
forward, captains the forward pack.
Other returning players to watch
include prop Peter Zustovich, centers Ryan Madder, and George

Rosenbaum,

eightman

fullback Dan Green. The rookies
have also shown promise and enthusiasm.
The ruggers are eager to test
themselves against the other teams
of the East Penn Rugby Union, and
join the ranks of the many illustrious Evil Buzzards of past seasons.
Catch them all in action this Saturday against Millersville. The Buzzards will be playing away from the
friendly confines of DuPont Field
this weekend, due to the annual arboretum plant sale being held there,
so stroll down to Clothier Fields,
on the practice football field, for an
afternoon of exciting rugby action.

players some quality playing time.
•The Warmothers are looking forward to a short but strong season
With a large team and a good
amount of talent. Although they
lost a significant number of veterans who are either abroad or graduated last year, the skill level on this
year's team remains high. By
working on some basic skills this
week, they should do well this
weekend when they go to Rutgers
University for a tournament, and be
ready for sectionals the following
weekend.
The men's ultimate frisbee team
attended the second tournament of
the season on Saturday, September
13th at Haverford College. The
Swarming Earthworms split into
two even squads to work first-year
players into the rotation as much
as possible.
Team A started the day by avenging last weekend's loss to Lehigh,
defeating the understaffed and sluggish Lehigh 13-8. The Earthworms
then raised an impregnable zone
defense against Haverford's 20man B-Team, routing them 13-11
and going on to defeat a strong
Bucknell team 11-9. The final
game pitted Team A against regional power Penn State. The lead
changed several times between the
two undefeated teams with the

starts season
Earthworms pulling ahead to 7-5 by
halftime. Though Penn went on to
defeatthe Earthworms 13-11, Team
A fought valiantly with Matt
"Wheels" Coddington '99 zipping
around a 6'5" Penn State defensive
player to connect with Roger
Bock's '99 unerring foreh, and and
Nate Schaffran 'OO valiantly spraining his ankle diving for a catch,
sacrificing his body to advance the
disk.
Team B faced a tough pool, and
lost their games against Haverford
A, Columbia, Princeton, and
UPenn.
"I really enjoyed this, I'm definitely coming to another of these,"
remarked Owen Lipsett 'Ol at the
end the tourney. Matt Schwartz 'Ol
concurred, "It was great playing for
the Earthworms, I love the game, I
love the groovy jerseys we get, and
I love sampling the cafeteria fare
at exotic, faraway schools."
The team is looking forward to a
tournament at Rutgers this weekend in preparation for Sectionals
the weekend of September 27.
Prospects look good, and the Earthworms hope to draw on the experienced talent of Bock, John
Christodouleas '9B, Menendez, cocaptain Sasha Clayton '9B, and Tim
Sibley '9B as well as first-year
standouts Muspratt and Matt
Murphy 'Ol to lead them onward
to further glory and victory.

N.F.L Opens
with upsets
The 1997 N.F.L. season has
started off in a way which none of
the experts have predicted or could
have predicted, as early upset losses
have raised doubts about the
league's three elite teams.
The word "elite", in the N.F.L.
sense, of course means "of the
N.FC." At least, that's what the experts say. They can back this up
with the fact that the last time an
A.F.C. team won the Super Bowl,
Ronald Reagan had recently entered the White House.
In the past few years, the only
teams who were even mentioned in
the same sentence as "champions"
were the Dallas Cowboys, the San
Francisco 49ers, and recently, the
Green Bay Packers. All three of
these teams have lost at least one
of their first three games, and defending champion Green Bay managed to drop their second game to
Philadelphia after the prediction of
an undefeated 16-0 season. Dallas
lost to Arizona for the first time in
seven years, and San Francisco
dropped its opener to Tampa Bay,
losing quarterback Steve Young and
receiver Jerry Rice, two future hallof-famers, to injury in the process.
The effect on the season will be
minimal, except for the injuries
sustained by the 49ers. The early
part of the N.F.L. season means
about as much as the early part of
the baseball, hockey or basketball
season: nothing. Sure, football only
has sixteen games, but everybody
will lose a few, and even with an 02 or 0-3 start, a team can end up
winning their division.
Green Bay is still the team to beat,
with two-time league M.V.P. (and
self-proclaimed best football player
in the world) Brett Faure leading a
potent offensive attack. This offense
was no doubt the main reason for the
success of the team's defense in '96,
a unit which allowed fewer touchdowns in a single season than any
other team in football history. The
Pack's offense scored often and left
opposing offenses so desperate for
points that they would, naturally, try
a desperate offensive strategy which
had a small chance of working.
The D may not have been one of
the best in history as the statistics
show, but it does contain a league
best defensive line anchored in the
middle by 370 pound tackle Gilbert
'Turkey" Brown. Brown gets his
nickname from the fact that he refuses to play on Thanksgiving day
because he might miss the turkey.
Ends Reggie White (all time sack
leader) and Santana Dotson provide
exceptional containment for the
championship unit.
The Packers still seem to be the
favorite to win it all this year,
though the NFC still contains the
Niners, Cowboys and Panthers, and
new addition Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That's right, Tampa Bay.
Along with a new logo, the Bucs
began the '97 season with a 3-0
streak, upsetting the Niners in week
one. Head coach Tony Dungy
seems to have turned around one
of the league's historically worst
teams with running back Dunn and
defensive stars Nickerson and
Sapp. Only time will tell if this
trend will continue.
It almost seems futile to even discuss the AFC, but eventually the
time will come when this conference produces a champion. Still
undefeated, both New England and
Denver seem to have a shot at the
Super Bowl, while the Brunell-less
Jaguars still hold their own at 2-0.
This season has already had its
share of last second comebacks,
crushing hits and highlight-reel
catches after just three weeks.
There will be much more to come.

Field hockey continued to
trample their competition this
week, overpowering their first two
Centennial Conference opponents
by wide margins. The Green Terror of Western Maryland fell to the
Garnet 5-0, and Swat routed
Franklin and Marshall, 5-1.
Swarthmore is now 4-0 overall, 20 in conference play.
Against Western Maryland, the
players said they came out slow but
still were up 2-0 at the half. "I think
we played an excellent second half.
We kept up the intensity... never allowing WM to get a chance against
us,"saidLynneSteuerle'99. "WM

really worked hard the entire game.
They didn't give up at all. They
were very aggressive physically
and tried to push us around, but we
were much faster than they were,"
commented Michelle Walsh '9B.
Speed was not the Garnet's only
strength: they pushed three more
goals past the keeper in the second
half, proving that their offensive
line is not to be taken lightly. Lurah
Hess '99 scored twice, and Holly
Baker '99, Julie Finnegan 'OO, and
Walsh each once. In addition,
Danielle Duffy '9B racked up two
assists, and Baker and Steuerle
earned one a piece.
"Western Maryland had a pretty

good forward line and midfield, but
we were able to keep the ball away
from them and maintain possession. I really wanted the team to
play intense [sic] and pressure the
other team when they had the ball.
I think we did this well most of the
game," praised Coach Karen
Borbee.
The Garnet won their twentieth
consecutive conference game with
the victory over the Diplomats
Tuesday. This time, Swat started
the game very strong and earned a
comfortable cushion. Complacency may have set in in the second half, but five goals were too
many to be made up by F&M's last

ditch efforts. The Diplomats scored
their lone goal in the final seven
minutes of the game. Five players
scored for Swat: Baker, Duffy, Jen
Hagan '99, Hess, and Walsh. Walsh
and Finnegan picked up assists in
the game, and Duffy notched three
on her own.
"During the practice before each
game and during pregame warmup, Karen has been doing a great
job of reminding us that, though
each prior game has been in our
favor by a considerable amount, we
must play one game at a time and
remember that each of our opponents could consider a win over us
their biggest game of the season

and will play like they want that
win. I think this has worked to get
us mentally ready for each game,"
commented Hess. The team's leading goal scorer, Hess, was named
Centennial ConferenceCo-Player of
the Week for her outstanding offensive performance. She had scored
five goals on seven attempts in the
first three games of the season.
Duffy leads the conference in
scoring, with 12 points (2 goals, 8
assists). Hess and Baker are third
and fourth with 10 and 8 points respectively. Swarthmore's two goalies, Lauren Hopkins '9B and Jane
Kendall 'OO are at the top of the
conference's goalkeeping statistics.

Last Saturday the Warmothers,
Swarthmore's women's ultimate
team, played their season opener,
defeating three out of the four
teams invited to a Swat-hosted tournament. The 32 member team defeated Bucknell, U. Delaware, and
Haverford, while losing a tight one
to U. Penn.

■

In the first game Swarthmore
handily defeated Haverford, 11-3.
It was a similar story against the 6
person Bucknell team (to which
Swarthmore had to lend two players.) Swarthmore threw a zone on <
for a couple points before the
Bucknell captains informed
Swarthmore's captains Leslianne
Yen '9B and Mandy Hourihan '9B
that their team was all inexperienced freshmen players and the two
junior captains. Even after taking
the zone off, the Warmothers proceeded to crush Bucknell 11-1.
The game against U. Penn. was
the most challenging of the day. Swarthmore started off strong,
holding its own against the experienced Venus team. Once U. Penn
put a zone on Swarthmore, however, it became more difficult for
the Warmothers to hold onto the
disc and advance it up the field.
Jill Belding
Swarthmore played stronger in the
second half and managed to catch
up to U. Penn, tying the score at
10-10. But the game was put to an
end following a turnover by
Swarthmore, and a quick throw into
the end-zone by U. Penn.
In Swarthmore's last game
ries. Sweeper Rebecca Schmidt
against U. Delaware, Swarthmore
was out for the majority of the second half with an injury, though she played out several long points,
managed to return near the end of causing the captains to agree on a

Warmothers reached, defeating U.

First-year Heather Marandola Delaware 9-3.
"Overall I was very impressed by

taking over for Rosenbaum, but our play this weekend. Our vets

the Tide was a different team altogether in the second half, than others, so I'd say the success
outplaying Ursinus in every facet was a team effort, which bodes well
for the rest of the season" said
of the game. "The difference between the first half and the second Hourihan. Throughout the tournament Hourihan and Yen were carehalf was fantastic, we were impressed with the way we could ful to keep experienced players in

finish off week strong despite series of setbacks

The women's soccer team
struggled against Pomona-Pitzer
last Friday on Cunningham Field
losing 5-0. With Claire Baxter injured, Betsy Rosenbaum's twisted
ankle left Swarthmore with only
one captain, Sarah Jaquette, to lead
the team in their 5-0 loss to
Pomona-Pitzer last Friday.
Sundary, theTide was set back even
further with the news that left-wing
midfielder Amy Markey, who injured her wrist in Sunday's game
against Kutztown, would be out for
the season.
The next day, however, the Garnet Tide responded well to the setbacks, playing aggresively against
Misericordia, and pulling out a 1-0

victory.

With the support of their fans, the
team played physically, preventing
the Misericordia women from
achieving much success with the
ball. "We focused on getting physically aggressive, and we really
threw them off balance," said
Jaquette. "Though they are an extremely talented team we did not
let them get their job done," said
Rosenbaum.
In the first ten minutes of the
game, junior Kirstin Knox crossed
the ball to Jaquette who scored the
game's only goal. Though
Swarthmore maintained their lead,
they were plagued by penalties.
Jaquette received a yellow card
from the referee, while the assistant coach received a red card and
was ejected from the game for

screaming loudly at the officials.
Swat played its first away game,
and its first conference game
against Ursinus on Wednesday, losing 3-2. Two of the three captains
were still injured. The Ursinus
Women scored two goals in the first
half of the game and in the opening minutes of the second half they
scored yet another goal. The Garnet Tide, however, came back to cut
the lead to one where it remained.
The first goal came on a corner kick
from Kirstin Knox which Sara
Jaquette proceeded to knock into
the net. Knox scored the second
goal on a direct kick. "They were
a very tough team;" said Jaquette,
"they are huge girls, while we are
a small team, and yet they played
like animals."

There is no better way to describe the
Garnet Tide's loss Saturday against
Bethany than by the final score: 56-0. After many costly turnovers in their own territory and non-existent defensive play,
Bethany took an early 35-0 lead within
minutes of the second quarter, then coasted
the rest of the way.
Unfortunately, the loss cannot be attributed to Bethany's skill or strength, because
neither should have been particularly
daunting. Bethany had lost the week before to a team that went 1 -9 last year. The
Bison are young, with only 13 juniors and
seniors on their roster.
As for Swarthmore, the loss could be at-

tributed to inexperience. Of the seven starters returning from last year's team, only
two play defense. The loss of twelve seniors to graduation and seven probable
starters over the summer have proven devastating thus far. There are also only three
seniors on the roster this season.
Swarthmore, however, did experience
some successes during the game. The offensive line, which has often struggled over
the years, did not allow a sack. Freshmen
Tony Hillery and Rob Castelluci improved
over the course of the game, combining for
three interceptions. Additionally, Ansa
Yiadom 'Ol proved a capable backup quarterback.
There were individualefforts that deserve
recognition. Tucker Zengerle 'OO, in his

first start, made the conference honor roll
by accounting for 13 tackles (9 solo) despite playing in severe pain due to a broken hand. Tony Skiadas '99 and Bernard
Nossuli '9B showed flashes of brilliance
against a much bigger offensive line.
On the other side of the ball, Ben Hall
'9B and Shawn McAdams '99 played a
solid game at offensive line, and sophomore running back Joe Aleffi rushed for
35 yards in the first half.
With just a 41-man roster, the GarnetTide
will often be outmatched in terms of numbers, and the 95-man Bison team was no
exception. The Tide will have to eliminate
turnovers and mental mistakes to be successful, both of which contributed to their
downfall Saturday afternoon.
