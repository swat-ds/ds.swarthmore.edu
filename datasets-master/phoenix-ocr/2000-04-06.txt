Hess, Mejia awarded Sharpies
Watson Fellowships
By Sonia Scherr
Phoenix Staff

By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff

'

l\vo Swarthmore seniors, Anna
Hess and Juan Mejia, have been
awarded prestigious Watson Fellowships for next year. The fellowships, sponsored by Thomas
Watson, the owner of IBM, fund
Wanderjahrs, or years of wandering, for sixty newly graduated
seniors each year. Hess intends
to use her Watson funds to sketch
plants; Mejia will use video to
explore South America.
Mejia and Hess were notified
of their selection by the Watson
Foundation two weeks ago, a full
seven months after they began
the application process. The initial stage in this process is the
writing of a proposal outlining a
plan for a year of international
travel. The guidelines provided
by the foundation are vague,
stipulating only that the projects
be unique and have personal significance. Watson fellows are
also prohibited from returning to
the United States at any time during their Wanderjahrs. The
project proposals submitted each
year demonstrate a striking variety of interests.
Hess's project, entitled Voyage
of Discovery, spans two hemispheres and three continents.
"I'll be drawing plants in Great
Britain, Costa Rica and Australia to see how plants have
adapted to [their] habitats," she
explained.
This proposal blends her dual
biology and art majors, and the
time spent in Costa Rica will help
her to gain fluency in Spanish.
The inspiration for theproject
came from her seven year hobby
of drawing plants, an activity her
busy schedule at Swarthmore
has left her very little time to
Pursue. Although her project has
a strong scientific element, her
ultimate goal is to "make lots of
sketches," which could perhaps

Juan Mejia andAnna

culminate in the publication of
her sketch book.
The Watson Fellowship will
also provide Hess with her first
opportunity to travel outside of
the United States, aprospect she
views with excitement and some
trepidation, as she will be travelling by herself. Mostly, however,
she is thrilled by the rare opportunity to spend a year travelling
on someone else's bank account.
"I've always wanted to travel
outside the country," she said.
Mejia, as an international student born in Colombia, has had
much more experience with
world travel. His project, however, is more localized than
Hess's, constrained to the continent of South America. Entitled
South America Through theLens
of Video Transformation, his
project encompasses threemonth stays in Peru, Chile, Ecuadorand Venezuela. Related, as
Hess's is, to his major plan of
study, sociology/anthropology,
Mejia's project involves work in
the field of visual anthropology.
He will use video, he said, "to
learn more about some of the
marginalized communities of
South America and how they
cope with their problems."
Mejia described his Watson
fellowship as directly related to
his long-term career goals. It
combines "indigenous media and
art therapy," he explained.
"That's the way I would like to
take visual anthropology"
Mejia will travel with his
fiancee Roosbelinda Cardenas
'00; they have plans to marry in
June before departing on their
Wanderjahr. The idea for Mejia's
Watson proposal originated in a
documentary he filmed with
Cardenas last summer about the
children of El Salvador.

New Mullan Tennis Center
The new Mullan Tennis Center attracted large
crowds and rave reviews in its opening days.

D Course minors fireside chat
Members of the CEP, including Provost Jennie
Keith, held a fireside chat Tuesday to discuss the
implications of the proposal for course minors.

III to reopen Saturday

Swarthmore's student art-

ists, who for years have lacked
a space of their own, will soon

have the opportunity to practice their art and display their
work in Sharpies 111. Scheduled to reopen on Saturday,
April 8, after undergoing extensive renovations, Sharpies
111 will now be devoted entirely to student art space,
housing an art gallery, a workroom, and a storage area.
"The purpose of the art
space is to make the fine arts
a more prevalent part of
Swarthmore," explained Student Art Association (SAA)
president Brandon Silverman
'O2.
Student works from a juried
art show will grace the newly
painted walls of the first floor
gallery when Sharpies 111
opens to the Swarthmore community this Family Weekend.
Members of the SAA and the
Photo Club are currently in
the process of choosing 20
works to be exhibited in the
show from a total of about 75
submissions, according to
Silverman. A formal reception, to which the Swarthmore
public is invited, will mark the
show's opening and will take
place Saturday at 5 p.m. in
Sharpies 111.

signed in the minute the doors opened,
until 9:00 p.m., when the last person
left.
"In my four years here I never saw
this many people in the weight rooms
in the fieldhouse. It's great that this new
facility can accommodate a lot of
people without feeling overcrowded,"
said Peter Hutchinson 'OO.
The natural light that pours into the
fitness area from the large windows
facing the football field, combined with
the freedom of mobility provided by
the large 4,000 square-foot room, fosters a much more social atmosphere
than that of the three weight rooms in
the Lamb-Miller Fieldhouse.
The three rooms which formerly constituted the college's fitness facilities
are now empty, dark and unused. Vice
President for Facilities and Services
Larry Schall said that the three rooms
will be converted into meeting rooms
and coaches' offices over the summer.
Even students who formerly avoided
the fieldhouse were drawn to the new
fitness center on Monday to use the
$150,000 worth of new weight resistance and aerobic equipment, which
includes 16 MedX machines, a half
dozen treadmills and numerous bikes
and stairclimbers.
"The aerobic machines in this fitness

center are much easier to use and there

are more of each type. I like the whole

ambience, especially the ID policy,

which prevents people unaffiliated
with the college from using our facility," enthused Joanna Perry 'OO, referring to the new ID policy requiring all
students to leave their cards at thedesk
and sign in and out when they use the
fitness facility.
The quality of the new MedX machines provides the college with an increased ability to cater to a larger audience. In addition to being more appropriate for students undergoing
physical rehabilitation due to sports injuries, the new machines accommodate
a wide range of body types and allow
for small adjustments in weight resistance.

"All of the new weight resistance and
cardio machines are wonderful for the
rehab of my ACL [anterior cruciate
ligament]... If this new facility hadn't
been built, I would have liked to join
an outside gym for my rehab," stated
Caitlin Ryland 'O2.
The well-hyped new tennis courts
also represent a marked change from
the old facilities. The three indoor tennis courts are covered with Rebound
Ace surface, a material also used in the
Australian Open, which is significantly
different from the material in the indoorLamb-Miller courts.
"The surface is pretty slow and the
ball bounces a lot, so it will take some
getting used to," said Pete Schilla 'Ol,
who plays for the men's tennis team.
"The ball will get 20 percent faster after six months of using the courts, so
as the surface wears down the ball will
get noticeably faster."

Snack bar cuts time for breakfast credit

"majorplus one"proposal voiced at Fireside Chat

Along with Dining Services' new "open door policy," which began
Monday, Essie Mae's has changed the hours when meals are debited.
The snack bar changes will principally affect late risers accustomed to using their breakfast credit there. Breakfast, previously
debited until 11 a.m., will now be discontinued at 10:30 a.m. Aside
from that, the snack bar's system of operation will remain the same.
For Sharpies, however, the rather unfortunately named "open door
policy" (it is not an imperialistic trade policy, but a mealplan option)
has altered the meal system completely. Students can now eat meals
at any time of the day during the normal hours that Sharpies is open.
And this may, in turn, affect the operation of Essie Mae's. Director
of Dining Services Linda McDougall predicts that the new policy
will draw some of the late meal stragglers away from Tarble and

An unusually large number of

night's fireside chat with Provost
Jennie Keith and othermembers
of the Council on Education

Policy to discuss CEP's proposal
to allow optional course minors.
The proposal, which will soon
be brought before the faculty,
would create the option of minors
for course students but would
impose a "major plus one" restriction, which would allow only
a major plus one other "curricular element," which could be another major, a minor or a concen-

Mock Trial places tenth at nationals
The Swarthmore Mock Trial Association placed tenth out of 325

at the National Mock Trial Tournament March 31-April 2 in Saint

tration.

Under the proposal, depart-

ments would be able to choose
whether they offer a minor and

set the terms of it. Minors will
probably consist of five or six
courses in the department and
would not include the capstone or
comprehensive examinations required of majors.
The CEP scheduled the fireside chat to gauge student opinion before bringing the issue to
the faculty for discussion (and a
possible vote) on April 14. The
faculty's decision will probably
not affect current students and
will certainly not limit any plans
they might have.
The topic is still controversial,
as was evident in Tuesday's fireside chat, with strong student
opinions favoring and opposing
restrictions on the number of
curricular elements.
"People need to be protected
from themselves," said Dan
Kraut 'OO. "You don't want someone running around with three
majors, because they'd be locked
in theirroom and you'd never see

them."
Mimi Hanaoka 'O2 disagreed

strongly, saying she considers
the proposal "a really unfair restraint on what students would
like to do."
Some thought the restrictions
would be particularly unfair to
honors students, who would not
gain anything from the addition
of course minors and would actually lose the option of a second
major or concentration. Keith
reassured honors students that
they will still be able to course
major in theirhonors minor subject under the new program.
Keith said that, despite their
original ambitions, less than 10
percent of graduating seniors in
recent years have pursued more
than a major plus one. She added
that "no one is forbidding anybody to take anything," since the
restrictions would not have any
impact on what courses students
would be able to choose.

Provost Jennie Keith, left, back to camera, held a fireside chat Tuesday night.
Most students attending said they supported adding course minors but

proposed changes are not excessively restrictive. "If you do high
quality work in an area, it doesn't
have to be labeled a concentration for it to have a positive influence later in your life."
Keith and Collings reminded
the crowd that student desires to
have many distinctions on their
diplomas translate into added
administrative work for already
overloaded departments. Collings said faculty are concerned
about the quality of the work of
double majors; they think that,
were students are allowed to pursue more than two curricular elements, they are spread too thin
and their work suffers.

Hanaoka countered this point
by saying that she believes those
few students who do have more
than two curricular elements are
"the most organized, motivated
kids it's a self-selecting group."
The members of CEP in attendance said they believe the faculty will probably pass the proposal only if it includes the restrictive clause. Keith maintained that there is a strong consensus among faculty and students in favor of adding minors,
and several students at the meeting said the benefits of the plan
outweigh its costs, even if they
do not completely agree with the
restrictions.

On the list of most popular whining topics, gripes
about housing at Swarthmore are perhaps third only to
complaints about the workload and Sharpies. Witness
the past week's Daily Gazettes, where, more often than
not, a joke about the dreaded housing lottery has graced
the weather report.
But on the whole, one must agree, the housing situation
here isn't bad. Sure, it may be a little tight, and you aren't
guaranteed a swank Wharton single or a spacious Mertz
double, but if you want a place to live, you will get one,
and it won't be completely falling apart.
Don't take our rosy view of housing as a sign that we
worked out a deal with Myrt Westphal and her housing
minions in exchange for some good press. If we had, we
wouldn'tbe writing this
the random number generator was by no means kind to Phoenix editors this year.
But housing is run efficiently and fairly, and there's
generally enough to go around.
That said, we would like to point out one of the few
problems with housing at Swarthmore: the way blocks
now work under the newly implemented cohort system.
Blocks, as the housing committee writes on its Web
site, are intended for "the enhancement of student life
and bonds of friendship." But under the current
cohort system, students who receive blocks their
sophomore year, when blocks are perhaps most popular,
are considered to be in the first cohort regardless of
their actual lottery numbers. This means that in subsequent years, students who blocked (often on lottery
numbers that were not particularly good) are punished
for their decision to block.
The cohort system, while not perfect, is a good
method to equalize the room choosing process, but if the
college genuinely wants to enhance the bonds of
friendship, it should consider making the system more
fair to those who choose to block.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

RA selectors receptive to concerns

...

...

and Board

Keeping the Sharpies door open all day is a wonderful idea and it is a shame that it has taken so long to
implement such a reasonable policy. Already, students
are taking advantage of the ability to use their meal
credit more flexibly by going to the dining hall at any
time between breakfast and dinner rather than being
locked into rigid meal periods. This is a definite plus,
and while student dining is and always will be a long
way from four-star restaurant service, this new policy
makes a great deal of difference.
Unfortunately, while Swarthmore does not have the
worst dining experience around, even with the new
policy it is nowhere near the best in terms of convenience. Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall
came up with the idea for the open door policy, she
said, at a meeting of food service staff from many
schools. Not only do other schools have such an opendoor policy, but they also have things like longer hours
in the first place, student-run dining options like
pizzerias open after snack bars close, and get this a
smattering of food actually available in some dorms.
And although most of the new open door policy is good,
one result of it has been decidedly negative. Breakfast
credit at the snack bar is now only available until 10:30
a.m. on weekdays, rather than 10:55. While thankfully
people with 10:30 classes are still able to get food before
rushing out, there were still some people who depended
on the snack bar up until the deadlineof 10:55 as was
evidenced by the rush at the very end of the morning. If
they are not hurrying to class, they may be able to take
advantage of Sharpies to get breakfast or lunch credit at
that point, but we regret this reduction in flexibility.
Of course, Swarthmore as a community may decide it
does not need all of the services offered by other schools,
or that implementing them would not be worth the cost.
But it is good to see some progress in the creation of the
open door policy toward making Swarthmore's dining
experience better. We hope there is more to come.

To the Editor:
We are writing this letter on behalf of the RA Selection Committee regarding the concerns surrounding
diversity among RAs in Wharton. While all actions of
the committee are necessarily confidential, the importance and complexity of these issues plus the public concern expressed about the results require that
we explain our rationale.
When the committee met to fill an empty slot in
Wharton, we reviewed our procedures and discussions
as they related to issues of diversity. The process reviews applicants based on consistent criteria and extensive review from 23 committee members. Candidates are chosen based on their prospective ability to
initiate social activities, provide personal counseling
and complete administrative duties. The ability to deal
with a diverse student body was covered in each candidates' references, application and interview. The
placement of RAs for next year explicitly takes into
account several factors: candidates' dorm preference,
dorm team compatibility and RA diversity.
Inter-RA dependence is vital in all dorms, so the
committee considered team compatibility crucial.
Dorm teams are selected to deal with issues of difference and represent diverse backgrounds. The former
is more practically important because a good RA will

establish a sound rapport with hall members. This rapport allows the RA to either deal with the problem him/
herself or refer the student to a more appropriate campus resource. Composing diverse teams of RAs is also a
priority at many stages of the process and was explicitly
discussed at several points in the deliberations.
Addressing concerns voiced by students resonates with
the fundamental premise of being an RA. We were disappointed at how the mission of the committee was misunderstood and misinterpreted. As a committee, we welcomed the opportunity to reconsider the role of diversity in RA placement, and the Wharton team in particular, when a position there opened.
This year's RA Selection Committee was limited by a
lack of students from diverse backgrounds, both in terms
of students of color and males in general. While this limited dorm team diversity, we are nonetheless very
pleased with next year's RAs. Deans are exploring ways
to increase the applicant pool, including different compensation packages. The bottom line remains the same:
a diverse group of RAs demands a large and diverse applicant pool. We appreciated the student concern and our
subsequent reflections on diversity at Swarthmore.

Protest IMF and World Bank next week
To the Editor:
I am a member of the Class of 1985, and while at
Swarthmore I participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations, anti-apartheid demonstrations, protests against
U.S. military involvement in Central Americaand even
protests on behalf of fire safety on campus. I traveled
to rallies and marches in Philadelphia, New York and
Washington, D.C. I did these things because I believed
in them, not because it was cool or because it is what
"lefty Swarthmorons" do. Indeed, I still do these
things.
I write to you now because a very important meeting and demonstration is about to take place right in
your backyard
Washington, D.C. (I live in Seattle,
mind you)
from April 8-18. Nuclear weapons, U.S
military intervention, divestment campaigns what
they all have in common are multi-national corporations that are pulling the strings from the shadows.
And the "shadows" they use are such power-broker
institutions as the World Trade Organization (WTO),
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank.
During the week after this past Thanksgiving, the
WTO met in Seattle, and the people of the world gave
them quite a welcoming party. Tens of thousands of

us were in the streets of Seattle, but the student contingent took the brunt of police violence. The students were
the heroes of Seattle, as they martyred themselves in
the spirit of MLK and Gandhi. Without them, we would
not have shut the WTO down.
This month the IMF and the World Bank are meeting
in Washington, D.C. I am encouraging all of you to give
them just as big a welcoming party For more information, go to www.al6.org.

Elián: American freedom revisited

The Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) has deported Haitian
friends of mine from Brooklyn who escaped political persecution, the heels of
murder, disease, death and worse when
they fled Haiti in search of a better life in
America (Wyclef Jean's album "Wyclef
Jean presents The Carnival" displays this
beautifully). Sometimes, they've had children in the United States and debated leaving them here. Haiti is so bad that people
usually choose never to see their own children again. This isn't a series of isolated
incidents; this story isn't unique, it isn't

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

lESSE TAYLOR

How are all these far right anti-immigration folks suddenly considering
giving a little Cuban boy American citizenship so he can know "freedom"
when American citizens who want to bring family members here from
Third World countries must fight for years to do so?
America has one big fat ego. "We" as a
country do not care about sending Haitians and Mexicans back because their

that we don't need to prove how much better and more powerful we are. Castro got

it. Some government officials still have a
bone to pick with the man and a few votes
to win. Never mind that a father and his
young son are being kept apart for it.

that they won't return Elian to his father
even if he comes to get his son. Who are

N-word letter wrongfully implicates frat
To the Editor:
I write in response to the published letter to the editor "Excessive use of N-word
distressing" (March 23, Opinions, pg. 9).
As a brother of Phi Psi, I wished to respond
to the author of the letter. This is a statement of my opinions as well as an address
to the campus community.
As a brother of Phi Psi, I speak out of
concern and mild upset. Such a public indictment of the house is a reckless way of
handling the matter of racism. This type
of institutional attack is normally reserved for a case of deep-seated and directed hate, something that is shunned in
Phi Psi. The media is an extremely powerful tool, and its use to settle personal
upset is rash. Perhaps the author should
have said something directly to those who
used the N-word; perhaps the time and
place was inappropriate to do so. Nonetheless, regretting inaction is no excuse
to act in haste. By naming the house, the
author indicts it through ambiguity, as
those closest to the organization (the
brothers) are inherently blamed.
. With regards to the use of the N-word

the use of the word in hip-hop is a means
of taking control of its power. By using it

That is the magic of telnet, an
old-school e-mail program,

poor man's version of instant
messaging and an incredibly disturbing stalking program all
rolled into one
and it is my
favorite new toy. I once thought
telnet was the domain of people
who ate in the small room,
hunted dactyls and were
bafflingly good at computers. I
was wrong
telnet is easily the
best invention since sliced
bread.
If, for example, I have neglected to pick up a copy of The
Phoenix and do not know what
movie is playing in DuPont, all I
have to do is open my telnet account and type in "movies" to see
a display of the all the movies
that the Movie Committee will
show this semester
unfortunately, this week the Saturday
night movie was "Dirty Dancing." On May 8, however, "The
Secret of NIMH" will be playing,
and I will be there in Kirby to
watch with my telnet brothers
and sisters in capes.

If I have presumptuously deleted Terri Narkin's reservedstudents e-mail without reading
it, only to realize later that it was
actually an important message
about daylight savings, and I am
flustered because I do not know
whether to turn my clock backwards or forwards, I simply
need to type in "calendar" for
telnet to tell me which way to
turn my clock.
IfI type in "nethack," I become
privy to a nonsensical world of

complicated telnet computer
games, and if I allow "nethack"
to select a character for me, I am
told, "Hello, mhanaokl, you are a
chaotic elven Priestess." Apparently this dark underbelly of
telnet is Dungeons and Dragons,
a role-playing game favored by
the Magic-playing crowd. Since
this beastly game does not allow
me to simply quit, I log out of
telnet altogether.
While telnet is incredibly convenient, it is also unnervingly

creepy, not least because any
SCCS user can see where all the
other Swarthmore students with
an SCCS are logged on, when
they logged on and what they are
doing. Telnet takes the conventional Eudora "f" command to a
terrifying new level; the command is called "watch," which is
a bit of a misnomer, because
"stalk" is more appropriate. Any
stalker with an anxious trigger
finger only has to press "w" to
see what every SCCS user is do-

ing. Anyone with an SCCS ac-

count can check every place and

every time someone has logged
on for the past month. Nothing
could possibly feed the stalker

\^AV

When the original members of
OGS sat around to trying to find
a name for their band, they came
up with the mysterious name that
few people on campus know:
Oota Goota Solo.
"We realized that we all liked
Star Wars a lot, that was what we
had in common" Tracy McNeil
'OO said.
Translated from a line in "Star
Wars," the line means "goin'
somewhere, Solo?" The fate of
Han Solo may not have been so
certain, but OGS is already on its
way.
OGS is difficult to describe
its music is as diverse as the
people who make it. Originally,
the founders wanted to combine
live music and live instrumentation with hip-hop vocals. They
cite The Roots as an inspiration,
but their songs are a blend of
rock, jazz, funk, hip-hop, classical and reggae, plus some songs
that incorporate swing and Latin
music.
"I think we name ourselves
predominantly hip-hop/funk because we want to keep ourselves
constantly eclectic and in motion," McNeil said. "The music is
very diverse... [we] don't really
have a straightforward type. We
listen to hip-hop and rock and a
fusion of what everybody likes."
The members of OGS come
from different musical and ethnic backgrounds. Some are music majors, while others had no
prior performing experience before joining OGS.
"We are some strange family,"
said McNeil. "When we walk in,
people don'tknow what to expect,
and I think that gives us an ad-

vantage."

OGS is also known for its group
dynamic. That unusual kind of
group creative process, said keys
player Marie Abe 'Ol, means that
everyone is involved in the making of songs.
"The process of writing has
gotten more efficient," said
Marie Abe. "We bring in ideas,
but no one person writes a whole
song; we jam for like half an hour,
and look for inspiration by
freestyling and jamming, then
we talk about it and tighten it up.

straightforward type.

We listen to hip-hop
and rock and a fusion
of what everybody likes."
Tracy McNeil
Everyone has a part."
Part of the "tightening up"
OGS has been doing paid off in
January, when the band made
their newest album, "Arts and
Crafts." Recorded in Olde Club
and mixed by Nick Kourtides,
"Arts and Crafts" was released
March 16, and has 10 tracks.
"We invested a lot of time and
money into the album, and we
want to show people what we've
done," vocalist JedLewis 'OO said.
In a new move to promote the
album and get their name out in
the public eye, OGS has taken
advantage of a service offered
my theWeb site mp3.com. On the
site, some of the songs from the
album are available for download
on a page that has information
about the band and places to buy
the new album. The song "Goin'
Wookiee" (which includes au-

thentic wookiee noises) recently
has reached no. 27 on the site's
Alternative Hip-Hop chart. The
band gets a certain amount of
money from the site when people
download songs or buy the album.
McNeil used the Web site to

gauge the success of the album.
"I think I knew the CD was
good when I called my friends
from home to tell them it was
online, and they are very honest
New Yorkers, and they told me it
was good," McNeil said. "I knew
we'd made it."

The album has also had a positive effect on the shows OGS
plays off campus.
"We don'tplay much out of the
Tri-Co area, but now that we have
the album, it's easier to shop ourselves around and get shows,"
Lewis said.
At a show last month in
Boston's Market Place Cafe, the
band noticed Natalie Portman,
who played Queen Amidala in
"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace," in the crowd. As the vocalists performed the song
"Amidala," they did get a bitflustered, though.
"They practically choked on
their words," Abe said.

Today I feel like telling dead baby jokes

slug
I was once told to never write about
writing or talk about talking. And here I
am, humor me please, writing about writing about writing. It's like "Enjoy the Silence"
"Words are meaningless and
forgettable...words are very unnecessary/
they can only do harm." Lyrics about not
speaking. I'm not going to insult your intelligence by pointing out the irony.
But that puts me in a bit of a bind. I want
to write about him, I know it would help
me get over him, seeing these pathetic
words in print; it would overextend the
melodrama of the silly situation to the
painful point of numbness and then I could
finally whip out the Ace bandage and
laugh at my stupidity.
In a fit of drunkenness one night I set
up a hypothetical situation. A crazy breaks
into the dorm room and puts a gun to my
head. He says, "You must now venture a
guess as to whether or not said boy likes
you, returns your affection, even wants
to see you. If you are wrong I will kill you.
You must be honest."
And because I really have no idea I
would say yes. Because then even if I was

wrong I wouldn’t mind if I got shot.
I sat there basking in the beautiful
tragic scene I had set up, and then I started
laughing hysterically and knocked over
my drink. It is funny, no? Pain is funny.
Especially when it’s in excess.
That seems to be thetheme in the comic
books I have been picking up lately
selfindulgent wretched overkill almost to the
point where I groan and roll my eyes, but
instead stopping short so that I merely
curl up in a ball and alternately giggle and
put tear stains on my pillow. Here are
some of the better scenes, or at least those
fhat fit into my argument, in the comics I
read this week:
Jhonen Vasquez, who also did “Johnny
the Homicidal Maniac,” created
fillerbunny in one night for a comic con
one-shot. “Fillerbunny” is damn near the
cutest thing I’ve ever seen, but the poor
bunny is living with so much pain and loneliness that all he wants to do is die. At one
point he is given a monkey friend, who
then promptly is shot in the head.
“I understand now. I was just not meant
to be happy,” says fillerbunny.
Then a new friend appears, a moosey
adorable
godzilla-looking
thing.
Fillerbunny attempts to resist moosey’s
appeal, but gives in and finally smiles and
ventures a “Hello,” at which point then
moosey is also shot in the head.

A scene from "Acme Novelty Library." Below/'Fillerbunny," from a
"Acme Novelty Library" is drawn in the
style of old comic strips, all muted colors
and crisp lines. It describes itself as the
"best saddle-stitched booklet about lonely
bald men." And I can't think of a much
better explanation than that.
Then there's "Watchmen," which is often cited as the best series ever, beating
out even "Dark Knight Returns" as the
granddaddy of all today's grim 'n' gritty
books. If I start sneaking gin into one of
those ugly Earthlust mugs to help get me
through the day, I will blame it in part on
this comic. And yet, despite the graphic
novel's apocalyptic view of the future
the cover-up of the murder of half the

tical joke by the man who caused it all.
And then there's the naked blue Dr. Manhattan and his naked blue ass spouting
quasi-profound comments about fate, intertwined with panels of a breaking bottle
of Nostalgia perfume.
Too much fun. It's like dead baby jokes.
Here's one the similarly almost-too-cuteit's-painful Paula told me the other day.
"What's more disturbing than a pile of
dead babies?"
"A live baby at the bottom of the pile of
dead babies eating its way out."
Hahaha ha. Ha.
"Fillerbunny" was published by Slave

Brazilian capoeira group mixes dance, martial art

Photos courtesy www.capoeira-life.com

Brazilian capoeira dancers will visit Swat Saturday.

By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
If you think the most impressive martial arts moves are only
from Asia, think again.
Two masters of the part-martial art, part dance from Brazil
known as capoeira will be giving
a workshop and performance on
campus Saturday.
Capoeira was invented by
slaves in Brazil as a form of self
defense. To build their skills
without being punished for showing aggression, slaves called
their sparring dancing and set it
to music. The result is an elegant
form of mock combat called

"playing." A player
can make any number
of
moves
against an opponent
from a fluid crouchlike position called
the ginga in which
theplayer's legs are
always in motion.
But don't let the
dancelike beauty
deceive you like it
did slave owners;
escaped slaves took
advantage of the
fact that capoeira
moves can be lethal
to protect against

recapture.
Brandon Silverman 'O2 arranged the visit by Mestre
Ombrinho, the only North American master of capoeira, and
Grand Mestre No, who has been

practicing capoeira in Bahia,
Brazil for 50 years. They will be
accompanied by students at the
Capoeira Angola Palmares NY
Academy.
Ombrinho, whose real name is
Michael Goldstein, is able to walk
on his hands for a distance of 50
feet or effortlessly move into flying pushups where his body is at
an angle to the floor and his feet
never touch the ground.
Goldstein founded a capoeira
center in New York, where he is

the lead instructor. His program
is one of the few to offer courses
in capoeira to children.
Grand Mestre No, who has
been teaching for 35 years, is
credited with training the largest number and the most skilled
capoeiristas and mestres in Bahia, where capoeira first developed.

single @

swat

A few months ago at Sharpies I was sitting at the round tablebetween themiddle
and big rooms whining to one of my closest friends, "Now I'm single at Swat." She
looked at me without sympathy and
snapped, "Shut up, it's only been two
days!" No one wanted to hear me complaining about being single... at
Swarthmore. Its not like it's hard to meet
people on campus. That is only a problem
when there are people out there you want
to meet. Yes, there have been a couple of
times when I see someone mildly interesting at the condiment bar, but many times
it boils down to "oh, that person was with

I'm not a John Cusack fan. Never have
been. I can't quite pinpoint it, but there's
something about him that has always
turned me off. In fact, I'm inclined to not
see movies because he's in them. He
doesn't score promising roles, he's at a
total loss for anything that could be construed as charisma (or style), and he generally manages to destroy any glimmer
of potential his characters could possibly
have had with his distinguishing over-dramatization. So, I don't like John Cusack,
but I did like his latest movie, "High Fidelity."
In his latest role, Cusack plays a guy I
couldn't imagine anyone else even trying
to be. Cusack's character, Rob Gordon,
suits him perfectly, perhaps because
Cusack himself had a hand in Rob's creation. The owner of a borderline bankrupt,
customer-free record store, Rob Gordon
is the epitome of dork. Wearing tight black
jeans and scruffy from his lack of motivation for anything, including his own
personal hygiene, Rob prizes above all else

freshman year
when I saw them on
Parrish beach." But I don't want to make
generalizations because most times I don't
see anyone interesting at the condiment
bar.
So instead I went around telling people
that I was going to start a column in the
Phoenix called "Single at Swat" in which
I would decry the ridiculousness of the
dating scene with a bitter edge. Most
people thought my idea was funny at first,
but after a while everybody was sick of
hearing me talk about something they
thought I would never really do. I changed
tactics and asked a broader range of
people at different social scenes on campus what they thought about my idea and
I received a variety of responses:
"Hey, you can't talk about me."
"Are you from Bryn Mawr?"
"I think you are palpating a sensitive
issue, and that's repidifying."
"I don't want to read a column about
what a loser I am."
"Ummmm, do you like onion rings?"
...

"I always vote abstain. Always."
"Wait, you are going to talk about relationships with real people?"
Perhaps dating at Swarthmore can be
compared to eating hard pretzels. Think
about it. No one really likes them, but if
there's a bag of hard pretzels sitting
around, you'll probably eat them, even if
you're not hungry. Not that pretzels are
something people dislike. They do, after
all, have structure and a solid consistency.
But no matter where they come from, the
taste is pretty blah. You might as well eat
them, especially since many times there's
nothing else around to eat. It's not like
chocolate covered pretzels
now those
are good even though deep down, they're
just a pretzel.
But it's very unlikely that you'll find a
bag of chocolate covered pretzels lying
around... at Swarthmore.
So, here I am, each day becoming more
of an expert on the single scene, and having left the la-la land of freshman year, I
am facing reality. And I am not taking any
easy escapes like going abroad (well, acbut I'm back

we could probably all use some serious advice on how to pick up the right person
("Hey, weren't you in my CA group?" is

chronicle the many aspects of
Swarthmore's dating scene. So if you're
feeling a little frustrated, talk to me, we'll
get your story across to the masses.

John Cusack's 'High Fidelity'

over all things musical, though he's not
actually a musician and the female vocalist he sleeps with halfway through the
show is about as close as he'll ever get to
being one. Rob Gordon really hasn't got a
lot going for him. Maybe that's the reason
Cusack plays him so well.
"High Fidelity" is the story of Rob Gordon and his sad-sack existence. After his
most recent breakup with a long-term girlfriend, a punk rocker turned lawyer and
ready to get on with her life, Gordon turns
to the camera with one of his many top
five lists: his top five breakups of all time.
From there, he delves into the gruesome
details of each breakup, in a desperate
attempt to discover exactly what it is that
makes him such a romantic washout.
The first relationship he examines on
his neurotic list of flops is the one with
the girl (he, of course, remembers her
name and assorted other unnecessary details) in seventh grade that lasted a whopping six hours. The fact that, years later,
he's still thinking about the chick he locked
lips with behind the bleachers says a lot
about his character. Rob Gordon is the personification of obsessive compulsive disorder; he lavishes inordinate amounts of

and "Midnight

Garden of
Good and
Evil" were

neuvers, his psychoses and relentless obsessive behavior kept me interested, waiting to see what quirky thing he'd do next.
I even have to concede that John Cusack
was actually pretty good. He made a convincing Rob Gordon, and didn't do too
shabby a job in turning Nick Hornby's
novel into a decent screenplay. The plot is

attention on things of relatively little import. His life is consumed by his love of
music, dictated by the various Top-5 lists
that float back and forth throughout the
show. Basically, he's a pretty big nerd, but
at least he's an interesting one, and, in
spite of my overwhelming disdain for
John Cusack and his acting abilities, I
found myself actually liking the guy.
Though it was a movie that I wasn't particularly keen on seeing, "High Fidelity"
wound up being a surprisingly entertaining show. Rob Gordon's unexpected ma-

well-maintained throughout, Cusack for
once keeps the audience's interest by involving them, speaking to them directly
instead of relying on dull narration.
A movie based on music and its significant role in Rob Gordon's otherwise bleak,
pointless life, "High Fidelity" packs a powerfully eclectic soundtrack, with more
than 50 songs. It's worth seeing, for want
of a better reason, to boost your own self
esteem and reassure yourself that, as bad
as things get, there are always guys like
Rob Gordon who'll makeyou, in your most
pathetic romantic blunders, seem staggeringly smooth.

The Pope should avoid this film religiously.A satire on the more hypocrticial tenets of

The renovations on the

built new walls in front of the
existing ones to increase the
amount of space available for

the removal of all but one of
the radiators on the main

new flooring was also installed downstairs. Major
renovations on the second
floor included the addition of
new office space, increased
power and internet capabilities. The walls throughout the
building were repainted a
lighter color to provide a less
oppressive atmosphere.
Both Silverman and
Semler said the construction
work proceeded smoothly
and on schedule, with the only
setback being a tree that fell
on the roof ofSharpies 111 last

this incident, workers from

Although the name of the

But whatever its new

"The new art space will

Silverman said. "It's an incredible opportunity for us to

Tiven highlighted the importance of the art space for

estimated that next year's class will contain around 370 students.
In addition to heightened confidence in
the matriculation of regular decision recruits, the predicted increased yield could
also be due to the admissionof more early
decision applicants this year. In keeping
with a nationwide trend, the college relied
more this year on applicants guaranteed
to enroll. More than 120 of next year's
class, or just under 15 percent, were ad-

Warmothers win Spring Phling title

UD

We don't suck

.

Saturday was a good day. Beautiful spring
weather and more importantly, success for
almost all of the Swat teams who played at
home. Softball pulled off two huge wins,
their first of the season, baseball split their
doubleheader with nationally ranked Johns
Hopkins, women's rugby continued a winning streak and women's lax demolished
Dickinson. It was definitely a good day to
be on campus.
"Yeah, yeah," you say. "Big deal. So we won
a few games. What about men's lacrosse?
Their winning streak came to an end down
at Western Maryland." (No, I'm not about to
trash the men's lacrosse team.) Their success so far is not a freak of nature.
I do have to admit that I'd never heard of
King's College until Swarthmore recorded
its first shutout in Centennial Conference
history against them, but that doesn't diminish from their overwhelming victory.
Swat does play a large number of local
colleges that most people haven't heard of
and that aren't very strong athletically. Almost all of the teams here do play random
schools, whether it be the College of Notre
Dame (Md.) in women's lax or Cabrini College in softball and golf. But we don't pad
our schedules with easy teams to counterbalance our lack of success in the conference. Most of the Swat teams finish at least
in the middle of the conference standings,
with many having a run at the championship. Women's basketball and the swim
teams were a significant presence in their
respective races for the Conference championships. So why do we, as a school, constantly bash our athletic programs?
Repeat after me: "Swarthmore athletics
do not suck." Case in point the men's tennis team. Led by coach Mike Mullan (who
now has a building named after him), the
team has qualified for the NCAA Division
111 playoffs numerous times and been very
successful in the tournaments. Just look at
all the banners in Tarble Pavilion.
One reason that the men's tennis team has
been so successful is that it has a schedule
packed with high caliber, non-Centennial
teams. No Cabrini College for them. It seems
like they're off traveling out of the region to
play highly respected teams like Trinity or
Williams every weekend. So why don'tall of
the other teams branch out and spend every
weekend trekking around the greater eastern seaboard to play top-notch teams?
It's my understanding that it depends on
how the particular NCAA tournament bid
criteria is for each sport. As both men's and
women's lacrosse are expanding, the number of slots in each tournament are increasing, and the criteria are being redefined. As
it presently stands, the lacrosse team could
beat every New England Small College Athletic Conference team, but because they're
out of our region, the wins wouldn't be
counted in the consideration for bids. And
besides, we have plenty of worthy Centennial Conference foes to contend with.
The men's lacrosse team will be traveling to Kingston, N.Y. to play Bates (who
plays in NESCAC) Saturday, and it will be
interesting to see the outcome. They lost last
year 14-4,but this year's squad is different.
They've already tripled their wins, and their
impact will be felt in the conference this
year. So, keep youreye on the men's lacrosse
team. They are, after all, off to their best
start since 1984.

When you see them around campus or on Mertz field, congratulate the Warmothers, Swat's women's Ultimate Frisbee
team, because they won their first championship of this season.
At Spring Phling, hosted by Penn State, the women beat 14 other
teams for the trophy. Although they lost theirfirst game Saturday 8-7 to Salisbury State, the Warmoms rebounded to win their
next six games. On Saturday, they cruised by Syracuse 13-1,
humiliated the University of Rochester 11-2 and then thoroughly
trampled the University of Virginia 11-4.
On Sunday, during the elimination rounds, the games were
much more competitive. The Warmothers narrowly defeated
Columbia University 12-10 and Bucknell University 12-10 in the
semifinals. The women played host to Penn State in the finals
and earned a hard-fought 13-11 win.
On the men's side, the Earthworms performed admirably,
going 4-1 against schools with much larger enrollments. Swat
crushed their first four opponents, winning 13-2 runaways
against both Allentown and Pitt at Johnston, easily eviscerating
Vassar 13-3 and finally smacking down Penn State 13-5. However, in the elimination round, Penn State spoiled the Worm's
day by winning theirrematch 13-11.
As usual, the captains of the Warmothers cited their rookies
for great playing, especially during the round robin on Saturday. Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol commendedLaura Fanucchi 'OO for
immense effort all weekend. Fanucchi made frequent end zone
bids and was responsible for more than her share of the
Warmom's points. Goldsmith also glowed over fellow captain
Jenny Hoedeman's 'Ol huge layout grab for the winning point
of their semifinal game against Bucknell.
Various Earthworms related their highlights from the weekend. Co-captain Nate Schaffran 'OO described a memorable play
by Brandon Silverman 'O2: "Brandon made a perfect transition
cut along the right sideline, and I put it to him. All I remember
after that is a freeze-frame of Brandon about four feet in the
air, completely stretched out and horizontal, with a disc in his
hand. It was one of the best offensive layouts I've ever seen."
Silverman himself commented on the playing of all the Earthworms present at the tournament. Here's an edited version of
the list, with a few statements from other players: Al Bui 'O2 played
big defense all weekend, especially against Allentown and Penn
State. Dan Schwartz's 'Ol equally big defense against Penn State
and solid playing all weekend forecast a bright future for him.
Star freshman Paul Wulfsberg played well all weekend, and
very hard, as evidenced by a play where he plowed into a metal
trash can four yards out of bounds while chasing after a disc.
Misha Horowitz 'O3 did a perfectly horizontal layout on the second point of the whole tournament and played very well on both
days. Schaffran as usual put forth incredible effort on every point,
running some of the longest and hardest cuts of the weekend.
Special kudos have to go to Mark Murphy, who managed to shut
down 6'B" Jason of Penn State in the finals.
Of Vincent Pallaver 'OO, Silverman said "Vinny is a highlight.

Jeremy Slezak skies over DLma Shchelokov at practice on Monday.
He played throughout the weekend, despite a nasty finger injury. Jeremy Slezak 'O2 relished taunting his defenders with a
brief view of the disc in the end zone before reaching up over
them to snatch it for a score. Thomas William Mather 'OO played
tremendous defense as usual."
Silverman concluded his sermon with praise to Rob Delgado
'Ol, who played injured against Pitt, and displayed some pretty
cuts, nice dumps and tight defense.

Track takes victory at Widener WrestUngmania
By Sarah Jay, Donald Nguyen
and Marc Jeuland
For The Phoenix
Last Saturday, the Swarthmore track
squad took their effort to another level.
Putting forth a strong mixed relay effort,
Joko Agunloye 'Ol, Karen Lloyd 'OO and
Marc Jeuland 'Ol were some of the most
impressive performers, tearing up the
Haverford track during the 10,000 meters.
Agunloye, spurred to glory by the enthusiastic cheers of her teammates, came in
first and qualified (provisionally) for nationals. Lloyd, running her first 10K, finished a strong second, and Jeuland blew
the competition away with a first-placefinish and new school record of 31:43.7.
On Saturday, the team headed out to Widener to dominateand destroy all of the competition. It all startedwith Jeff Doyon's 'OO
his first
in
amazing steeplechase
which he cruised to a time of 10:30.62.
Next was the women's 4xloo relay, in
which Desiree Peterkin 'OO, Imo Akpan 'O2,
Emily Gray 'O2 and Soenda Howell 'Ol sped
to a second-place time of 52.06. The speed
kept coming in the 5000, in which Eileen
Estes 'O2 ran a personal best time of 24:15.2.
AlissaParmalee 'Ol won herheat of the 1500.
In an intimidating display, Akpan and
Peterkin finished first and second in the

100.Akpan also blazed to victory in the 200
with a spectacular time of 26.11. Peterkin
won both the long and triple jumps, qualifying for nationals in the triple for the
eighth time in eight seasons.
In the 400, Keith Gilmore 'Ol took fourth
with a 51.14. Fresh off running the grueling
steeplechase, Doyon still felt light enough
to record a personal best in the 800 with a
time of 2:01.60. Kwaku Ntoso'O3 placed second in the 110 hurdles with a time of 17.05
and no scabbed knees. Steve Dawson 'OO
soared to new heights with a high jump of
6'4", and freshman phenom Matt Rapoza
took sixth in the shot put and the discus.
Clara Fuchsman 'Ol was a powerhouse
in the throwing events, taking third in the
shot and fourth in the discus. Christen
Lungren 'O2 displayed her speed and endurance in the 3000, taking first with a brilliant time of 11:17.36. Sarah Jay 'Ol was finally happy withher race, demolishing her
arch-nemesis with a time of 2:26.82 in the
800. In a noble but potentially foolish act,
she attempted to throw the javelin
and
wound up in fifth place. To cap off the
strong meet, the women's 4x400 relay of
Jay, Peterkin, Gray and Akpan finished
second with a season best of 4:18.91.
This coming weekend, Swarthmore will
compete against Johns Hopkins University
in a conference meet.

President/Owner/Bad Ass Vince McMahon
has expanded his company from Stamford,
Conn., all the way to Brazil, Japan, Germany
and beyond. He has spawned the XFL, which
just recently signed on with NBC for complete coverage starting next winter. WWF
paraphernalia includes every toy or trinket
you can imagine. Their live events go on sale
months in advance and sell out in minutes
(try getting tickets for the next time they're
in Philly). Their bi-monthlypay-per-views are
the most ordered events. And most importantly (at least for me), their two biggest
weekly shows ("Monday Night Raw is War"
and "Smackdown!") are two of television's
most watched shows. Despite being on cable,
"Raw" routinely garners a 6.5 rating and goes
into 5 millionhouseholds and "Smackdown!"
has similarly impressive numbers.
I'm still not convinced that wrestling is
anything more than a soap opera with
roid-raging egomaniacs.
Well, actually that's a pretty good description. But before you write off professional
wrestling as simple-minded and barbaric, I
challenge you to watch a show. Next Monday, from 9-11 p.m., watch "Raw" on USA.

action doesn't suck you in and make you one

they get on the playing field.
Until Saturday, though, the potential to
win had yet to be turned into that much
needed victory for the then 0-10 squad.
That's where Castleton came in. A fledgling program on approximately the same
level as Swarthmore, Castleton needed
the W's just as badly as Swarthmore.
Led by Lindsay VanSciver 'O3,
Swarthmore took both of those games.
VanSciver pitched every inning of the
twinbill; she tossed a dominating complete-game shutout in the first game,
and put up another solid performance
in the second game, giving up just two
runs. The squad needed every bit of that
first performance, squeezing out just a
single run for a 1-0 win. In the second
game, Swarthmore won 6-2.
VanSciver hasbeen a workhorse to say
the least. She has pitched eightcomplete
games and has an ERA under 4.00.
VanSciver has solvedSwarthmore's most
serious deficiency from last season:
pitching. In losing routs by wide margins
last year, the Garnet pitchers often surrendered double digits in walks.

While improved pitching has played
a big part in Swarthmore's success, an
improved offensive attack has alsobeen
key. Stephanie Wojtokowski 'O2 has been
on fire, hitting .556 with six extra-base
hits and a slugging percentage of 1.000.
The sweet-swinging lefty also has stolen three bases. Shortstop Heather
Marandola 'Ol is hitting at a .370 clip
with three stolen bases. Perhaps more
impressively, Marandola has not struck
out once in 27 plate appearances.
The lone senior on the squad, pitcher/
outfielderAmy White, has seven singles
for a .318 average, while providing flawless defense.
Reality may set back in for a whilewith
tough conference games in the near future. Nevertheless, this victory is an important one for Swarthmore Softball. It is
a victory that brings respect and confidence to a program that has long been
struggling. First-year head coach Mitch
Kline has molded a team offreshmen and
rookies into a competitive squad. With
only one senior, this is a team that will
continue to improve over the next year.
No longer is Swarthmore softball
something to be laughed at.

Catcher Josh Lindsay
takes a big cut at a pitch
on Saturday. Lindsay's
clutch two-on, two-out
RBI single gave the
Garnet an early margin
against heavy favorite and
conference powerhouse
Johns Hopkins. The team
won the front end of the
twinbill against the Blue
Jays 6-3. They fell 9-3 in
the nightcap.

From BASEBALL, pg. 16
Farneth pitched a complete game, limiting the high-octane Hopkins offense to
just three runs.
Farneth improved his record to 4-3, with
a stingy 3.32 ERA. He has pitched four
complete games and could have several
more wins under his belt if not for poor
run support and the sometimes shaky defense played behind him.
In addition to Farneth doing his part, the
team needed to produce some runs. They
had to do without the help of starting third
baseman Brian Lopez-Stiller 'OO, out after being hit in the eye by a stray throw
on Thursday. Run production has been a
problem all season, as Swarthmore's big
bats at the top of the lineup have been slow
to wake up. At times, they looked as ifthey
were trying throw the gameaway. Three
consecutive Swarthmore base runners
were picked off.
"We pretty much looked like idiots on the
basepaths," said Scott Kushner 'O2. "We
were really shooting ourselves in the foot,
but Steve came through and we picked up a
huge win. For a team that's been struggling,

knocking off a ranked team is a big boost."
Catcher Josh Lindsay 'Ol, who has been
struggling with the batall season, was the
main offensive catalyst. His clutch 2-out,
2-run single broke the game open early.
Lindsay also called an excellent gamebehind the plate, helping Farneth dissect the
Blue Jays lineup. Jay Schembs 'Ol went 3
for 3 with an RBI double late in the game
to give the Garnet an important insurance
run late in the game.
In the second game of the twinbill,
Swarthmore fell 9-3, a victim of some
sloppy fielding and scattered hits.The Garnet made four errors and stranded nine
runners on base. Joe Aleffi'OO had two hits
in the game and scored two runs. He is
currently leading the team in hitting with
a .325 average. Lane Oatey 'O3 had the lone
RBI for Swarthmore in game. The freshman right fielder has shown flashes of tremendous potential at the plate.
Swarthmore plays Muhlenberg on Friday
and then has a doubleheader against Western Maryland on Saturday. All of the games
are CentennialConference matchups. Three
games in two days will seriously test the thin
Swarthmore pitching staff.

Strong pitching leads Swat over
nationally-ranked Johns Hopkins doubleheader sweep of Castleton
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff

By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff

On Saturday, the Swarthmore baseball team opened its conference schedule with a doubleheader at home against nationally-ranked Johns Hopkins University. On paper,
Swarthmore seemed significantly overmatched against the
Bluejays, who have strong pitching and a lineup loaded from
top to bottom. Of course, games aren't played on paper, and
in baseball pitching is the great equalizer.
In the first game, Swarthmore had its version of Greg
Maddux, Steve Farneth 'OO, on the mound and on his game.

"Swarthmore softball wins both games of doubleheader."
It's a headline you think you could only see on April 1. But
this was no April Fool's joke. With a doubleheader sweep of
Castleton State College of Vermont, the softball team served
notice that they are no longer to be laughed at. After last
season's abysmal record and several graduations, there was
little hope for the 2000 season. However, a new head coach
(Mitch Kline) and an infusion of freshmen and rookie players has turned this team into a squad that can win every time

Ultimate

tourney at
Penn State

As a diehard wrestling fan, I have been
determined to incorporate the World
Wrestling Federation into my columns.
The launch of the XFL gave me an excuse
to use wrestling cliches and allusions, but
I have yet to feature the WWF.. .until now.
Sunday marked the 16th Wrestlemania in
WWF history, the popularity of which
warrants a wrestling article.
But Scott, don't you know that professional
wrestling is fake?
Now before you flood theeditor's office
with letters about how professional wresting is scripted entertainment and therefore doesn't deserve to have a place on the
sports page, in the words of DX, "SUCK
IT!" Scripted or not, wrestlers are athletes. They are also (cough) actors, but
that should not take anything away from
their tremendous athletic feats. In fact,
real professional athletes have tried their
hands at wrestling only to find that it's a
lot more than pulled punches and collapsible tables. Dennis Rodman has teamed
with Hulk Hogan on multiple occasions in
World Championship Wrestling. Rodman
remarked afterwards, "I bump bodies
with the biggest men in the NBA every
night, [but] my body has never been more
sore than the day after a wrestling match."
Other than cameos, are any of these guys
legitimate athletes?
Rodman is not the only "real" athlete to
turn to the squared circle. WWF's Kurt
Angle is an actual Olympic gold medalist
in wrestling. Ken Shamrock competes in
the Ultimate Fighting Championships
(about as far from scripted as possible).
Mark Henry won the World's Strongest
Man Competition. Farooq and Dewayne
"The Rock" Johnson played college football at Florida State and Miami respectively and Goldberg played for the Atlanta
Falcons. There are many more WWF and
WCW superstars who have legitimate athletic backgrounds.
Anybody could be a wrestler if he really
wanted to, all you need is steroids and a gimmick.
Professional wrestling is actually a very
selective profession. The WWF's Power
Plant Gym is an exclusive club for wrestling wannabes to go to learn the basic
holds and moves. Wrestlers even have to
go through a training process on par with
the minor leagues, CBA, or CFL. Professional wrestling organizations have been
around for years, usually as rest havens
for has-beens or starting blocks for upand-comers. Venues vary from wrestling
in a friend's back yard to high school auditoriums to community centers all in
preparation for performing in front of a
sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden.
Competition is fierce and often the line
between WWF superstar and backyard
brawler is nothing more than a lucky
break.
Wrestling is great entertainment for
midwestern white trash, not for the average
American.
True.
I'm still not convinced—
Whoa...wait, let's go back to that last
comment. Wrestling is not just a pastime
for Inbred Jed and Cletus the Slack-Jawed
Yokel. It is entertainment for the entire
strike that
for the entire
country
world. The WWF is as global as any other
major sporting association. WWF CEO/
