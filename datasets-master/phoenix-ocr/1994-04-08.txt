Multiple Incidents of Hate Speech Cause Campus Uproar
By Erik Huneke
Neal Potischman

&

During the night of Friday, April
1, someone scrawled the words "Fuck
Niggers" in chalk on Magill Walk near
the entrance to the tunnel underneath
the trainstation. This slurhas led to the
staging of an eight hour sit-in demonstration in front of theAdmissions Office on Monday initialed
by SASS members, a
quiet hour-long vigil on
Parrish Beach on Tuesday afternoon, and an intense dialogue among
members of the college
community.
Many students first
learned of this eventfrom
a skit that was staged at
6:00 pm in Sharpies on
Saturday, April 2 by Joel
Johnson '96. In commenting on his initial reaction to the slur, Johnson
says,"Ifeel I'vebeendesensitized my personal experience
hasbeenfull ofit[hate]." Yet in light of
the hate speech incidents on campus,
including epithets on the door of the
Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Alliance,
Johnson and manyotherstudents have
decided to take a more active stance.
Johnson's skit was based on the
"happenings" createdby Alan Kaprow
in the 19505, which were improvisational theater representing aspects of
theartist'sculture."My fearwasthatthe
administrationwould say that we condemn this but we can't do anything
about it"

He proceeded to select AfricanAmerican audience members, who
were not informedbeforehand, to participate. In one gesture, Johnson read
passages from Great Philosophers of
Our Time to a" studentbound in a chair
and thenproceeded totearout thepages.
The tearingof thepages symbolized the
cracking of the intellectual exchange
embodied by this philosophy "in the

Ultimately, Johnson believes that
the skit, which was watched by approximately two hundred students, accomplished its goal ofinitiation ofdiscussionamong students at their dinner
tables. Triisdiscussionhasbeencontinued in meetings among members of
SASS, SAO, HOLA, and LBGA as
well as over Newswatcher.

as "the struggle against white supremacy" and the boldness to "call
into question the invisibility of certain classes of people." He added

Campus Braces for Room Selection
By Kathleen Lawton

MoststudentshereatSwarthmore

look upon the housing process as a
necessary evil. The stress involved in
gauging the "market value" of one's
lottery number andfmding aroommate
permeates the consciousness ofthe student body in April. The aftermath of
room choosing may continue into the
following year, as bruised feelings and
undesirablerooming situationsaffect a
student's long-term experience at
Swarthmore. Rebecca Smith '96 recalled, "It's such a stressful time, with
everybody re-evaluating their friendships and who they really want to live
with."Because of this, Smith has decided to live offcampus next year.
This year, a number of factors
have coincided to make the housing
process more stressful for some students, and much easierfor others.Controversy surroundirignewhoiKingpolicies and the construction which is to
year have discouraged and even angered some students. Other students,
however, are taking advantage of the
separate substance-free room choosing
and the increase in thenumber ofblock
housing arrangements made available.
On the week of March 28, the
Housing Committee released copies of
the new Housing Contract to students
via a network newsgroup,
swat.announce.housing. By that
evening, many students had written on
the newsgroup complaining about aspects of the contract. Matt Trebelhom
'96, who posted a message on the bulletin board, said, "I don't like the way
these policies were just handed out to
us. If we're signing a contract, maybe
we should get some promises, as well."
Abraham Nussbaum '97 agreed: "It
doesn'tseem like a contractto me at all,
because it's a one-sidedresponsibility.
[lt] dictates only my responsibilities,
not the College's."
Among the issues cited were the
lar.lrnfrWinirir»nr»fthpPr»ll<»of>'ctTiatn-

in dorms, the new policy of making all
the students living in a dorm share the
cost of any damage incurred to that
dorm during the year, and the needfor
a dialogue between studentsandHousing Committee in the development of a
Housing Contract. Trebelhompointed
out, "I think that the damage policy is
one thing that just wouldn't fly if this
[contract] were talked out between
Housing officials and students."
Some students are also reconsidering their first-choice rooms because
of the construction of the new Parrish
Annex that will be going on during the
fall semester. Rodrigo Dobry '95 lives

Adler '96, who will be an R.A. in Dana
next year pointed out that, "A lot of
groups of underclassmen can stay together [with a block arrangement], unlike inmy class.We werebroken uplast
year because of the housing crunch."
Another option for avoiding the
general housing system was to participate in the substance-free housing lottery whichgrew more popular thisyear.
Last year, only one hall on campus was
designated substance-free. This year,
all three halls that were set aside as
possible substance-free areas wereused,
with only one double in Willets left
empty. Anna Rich '97 explained," My
roommates and I decided to do the

Other students may be forced to
change theirroom planning because of
the larger quantity of block housing
offered this year. Hong-An Tran '96
had planned to live in a room in Roberts
nextyear, buttheroomshe wants is now
being offered as part of a block. She
said, "Iguess[theblocks] are ameasure
against getting all stressed out about the

think that they went way too far. I think
there's way too much block housing."
Many of the new blocks were
created with the class of '97 in mind,
and the new possibilities do seem to be
an asset to them. Nussbaum, who hopes

On Thursday, March 31, Professor Michael
Rogin delivered the final speech in the 6-part
Cooper Lecture Series. In this talk, entitled "Democracy and Burnt Cork: TheEnd of Blackface,
the Beginning ofCivil Rights," Rogin chronicled
the portrayal of African Americans in the arts
throughout the first half of the 20th century, concentrating particularly on the use ofblackface in
film. Rogin noted that early in American history,
minstrel blackface was the most popular and
successful form of entertainment. As America
enteredthe twentieth century, blackface was used
inmoviemusicalsmostlyby Jews, whoatthesame
time were perhaps the greatest proponents ofcivil
rights for African-Americans.
Arguing that the use of blackface by Jews
served symbolically as a parasitic vehicle with
which Jews could enter American culture, Rogin
also asserted that there was something inherently

of while supremacy "haunts even the

"We need to ask, 'ls it the case that white
supremacy is limiting democracy?'" West
said later, in the speech. "We must make a
place for brothers and sisters on the block, m
the form ofreai opportunities,' he saio. adding that all blacks, not just those considered
"special," those who "laugh when it's hot
funny, scratch when it don't itch" must have
a place in this democracy if it is to work.
West also added that the success of some
black stars, such as Magic Johnson and
Michael Jordan, does not necessarily mean
blacks are making progress. "As Malcolm
said, 'Stabbing a man in theback nine inches
and pulling it out six inches is no! progress.
Part of the invisibility of blacks, West
asserted, can be traced to the objectification
ofblacks in America. African-Americans, he
said, "are viewed as problem people rather
than people with problems," as he made fun
of whiteswho believe that one African-American in theirmidst should represent all blacks.
West then emphasized the "Promethean" and
"sublime" power of everyday people includmjg blacks, and the "plutocrats" who tremble
at the thought of this power.
Moving on to another central theme of
bis speech, West focused on linking the unraveling of democracy to the erosion of community bonds. He equated a rise in poverty to
a riseindespair, and a rise in paranoia to a rise
in distrust. Recalling Dr. MartinLuther
Jr., as he did at other times throughout the
speech, West said "King was a radical democrat. When he said we are in a web of
mutuality.., he wasn't being polyannish or
naive."
He continued, "The bonds of affection,
the networks of support are waning." He
made the point that a child is raised not only
by parents, but by "aunts and uncles, dance
teachers and little league coaches, rabbis and
ministers,,.'' and that these are the bonds of
affection and support which we are losing.
West also related his Concept of Our society as
becoming "gangsterizecL" "I'm not just talking about gang bangers. I mean at all
levels... what a frightening way of life! What
a spiritually impoverished way of life!" He

wouldn't know that from the white media."
West went on to explain thattheblacknationalist message appeals to the despair and pessimism among blacks, but that Farrakhan's
"vision is truncated."
Closing his speech, West said that he

not just whites and minorities who find favor
with whites, "But," he added, "I am a prisoner
of hope, that is, one who engages in a leap of
hope, going beyond the evidence,"
After the speech, West fielded inquiries
from the audience, including aquestiohabout
why he did not take his "fire" onto the street
and "start a revolution" West replied that
around two thirds of his talks are given in
churches and prisons and trade union centers,
and that he did not want to be the "Moses-like
leader of arevolution," but that he wanted the
revolution in our democracy to be led from
the grassroots, not himself
Another student questioned why West
was accepting a position as professor of African-American studies andreligion at Harvard
University as opposed to a historically black
college. West, who presently occupies a position at Princeton, answered that he needed
to reflect," "time for sustained reading," and "time for a variety of diverse and
challenging conversations," and that at a historically black college he would be teaching
four classes a semester, thus hot having this
time. West, who is also Honorary Chair ofthe
Democratic Socialists of America, also felt
thatthe generally conservative atmosphere of
many historically blackcolleges wouldnOt be
receptive to his more radical philosophies.

Debate Society Gets Top Honors
By Mike Scott
During this past academic year,
Swarthmore's Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society has become a force to bereckoned with on
the nationalparliamentary debate circuit. The
Society started its year well, with a number of
successes in the fall tournaments, and has
continued to do well through the spring semester.

In January, Swarthmore was represented
by four debaters at the World Debating Championships held in Australia. TheWorld Championships featured teams from the United
Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Canada, and the United States. One
Swarthmore team finished in the top quarter
of all teams present, a fine accomplishment,
especially when considering that the World's
formatof debaterepresents a broad departure
from the American parliamentary format.
Peaslee continued its success in recent
months competing at several tournaments,
including those hosted by Cornell and the
University of Virginia. Peaslee teams occupied spots 3,4 and 5 at Cornell and dominated
the speaker awards, taking places 1,2,3 and 4.
At UVA, a Peaslee team won the tournament
while two individuals came home with the
2nd and 3rd place speaker awards. In addition
to the more regional tournaments Peaslee has
attended this academic year, Swarthmore debaters have also made the long trek to Canada
on several occasions. Swarthmore has been
represented at tournaments in Concordia,

McGill, and Hart House in Toronto. At these
Canadian tournaments, which again feature a
style different from the traditional American
parliamentary style, Peaslee debaters have
won numerous team and speaker awards making Swarthmore a highly respected force on
the Canadian circuit.
Swarthmore hosted its own tournament
here on the weekend ofMarch 19. The theme
of the tournament was *TheKremlin on the
Krum," a name given to Swarthmore by onetime vice-president Spjro Agnew. The tournament went well, thanks in large part to the
help the Society received from students volunteering to judge and host visiting debaters.
Approximately thirty teams competed, representing colleges and universities from
Stanford to the U. of Pennsylvania. A team
from Princeton endedup winning the tournament.

With the schoolyear drawing to a close,
there are only a few tournaments left.
Swarthmore will be attending Yalethis weekend (April 8-9), Bryn Mawr (April 15-16),
and then theNational Championships later in
the month at April.
The Society enters the home stretch with
the #2ranked team in the nation as well as two
of the country's top ten ranked speakers. In
short, Swarthmore's Peaslee Debate Society
has had one ofitsbest years in memory and is
clearly one of the top five schools in the
nation. With just three tournaments left,
things look set for an exciting end to an
outstanding year.

April Fools' Pranks Create Headaches and Havoc
By Jay Herrick
How much did April Fool's Day cost
you this year? Well, it may cost Swarthmore College upwards of $20,000 in materials to undo all the pranks inflicted upon
the campus. If you add on top of that the
labor cost, and the opportunity cost of diverting those resources, it wouldn't be outrageous to think $50,000 worth of "good
fun" was had this year at Swarthmore.
Is this the point of April Fool's Day?
Physical Plant employee Bill Maguire and
a co-worker spent theirafternoonremoving
portions of the college's Calder mobile
from the dome of Parrish. This inconvenience was turned into an insultwhen someone padlocked the door to the ballroom
behind them. So don't complain that your
radiator leaks or that the showerhead in the
bathroom shoots water all over—a fool's
errand has taken priority.

Last Monday Afternoon
To the Editor

"I join with Joanand Maurice Eldridge
in condemning those who wrote hateful
and offensive disgusting statements on
Magill walk. If you must display your
pathetic incivility in public, at least have
the courage to sign your name/s. This sort
of hurtful and offensive language has no
place in this academic community."
It's Monday afternoon, April 4,1994,
the day afterEaster. Jesus hasrisen from
the dead, signifying the rebirth of Christ
and a cleansing for all Christians. The
greyness from the day before has left behind a softblue sky.
Oh yes, another Monday afternoon at
Swarthmore College.
"Fuck Niggers."
Students strolldown to Sharpies chatting away about their weekend events,
Rugby games, the Old Club, etc..
"Die Niggers."
Oh yes, another Monday afternoon at
Swarthmore College.
Sometimes Ibegin to wonder ifwe're
all doing something wrong. Maybe we're
taking the wrong approach to things.
"This superb institution consists of a
multi-cultural group of students from all
over the globe."
Yes. But what about the multi-cultural groups of students from America? I
am aware of the various ethnic organizations of campus, SASS, HOLA, SAO and
others. At the same time I sense a wide
canyon forming between thesegroups and
the larger community. Many students
choose not to participate in thesegroups in
fear ofbecoming stigmatizedby their associations with these organizations. Others,
once they join, become engulfed in the
groups' causes but can't seem to see things
from a differentperpective. But then again,
maybeI'm wrong. Maybe I'm the one who
needsmy own organization, "The Association of Confused College Students who
aren't content with this present form of
Multiculturalism." IfI could have such an
organization, I would probably take a
different approach to things.
"I believe that these students need
more of a politic that stresses first their
belongingness, as members of a human
community, to the world they are joining.
What they get, sometimes out of the best
intentions, is a politic that tells them their
differences are everything—from the reason they got admitted to thereason for their
frustrations—and a climate that has replaced sympathy and genuine involvement,
is now with polarization and disengagement." —Claude M. Steele, Stanford University, a sermon delivered in commeration
of Martin Luther King Jr., 1994.
Swarthmore needs a new politic that
will create the so-called community that is
supposed to exist here. Instead, I see a
bunch of segregating groups all hundled
together in theirrespective cliches. Why is

Sharpies the wrong question or look at them
in the wrong way?
Swarthmore's multiculturalism seems
to place differences aheadof commonality.
Let itfirst be noted that this prioritization is
not without itsmerits. Many ethnic groups
challenge, rather than assimilate to, white
Anglo-Saxonstandardspresentedin our media, schools, and popular culture. As a result
we have seen thebeginnings of a wider more
accurate representatiion of the American
people expressed in our laws, media, and
even our textbooks. Ethnic groups have
challenged what was formerly assumed to
be the standard and has shown that American society is more than just baseball and
apple pie.
However, this emphasis of our differences has brought along with it some negative repercussions. The politics of difference has created a canyon between whites
and other ethnicgroups. As a result, it makes
it harder for sympathetic whites to identify
with these ethnic groups and with the injustices they suffer. The politic of difference
stresses thatthe special voice and experience
of these groups is virtually inaccesible to
outsiders. De-emphasizing commonality
among groups reduces the likelihood that
whites will feel a moral responsibility to
redress group inequities; this politic makes
difference a central part of theircharacter.
I am not saying that minority groups
should "sell out" to the white community,
nor am I saying that ethnic groups should
compromise their goals in order to "get
along" with the larger community. But as
Dr. Steele said, "The pursuit ofdiversity and
the respect for difference should always
procede from the pursuit of commonality_
the pursuit of commonality should be the
entering wedge of diversity. This isbecause
once commonality is established, differences and change are not quite as threatening; in the absence of commonality, they
do." Without any cohesiveness in a community, the slightest comment by either group
to the other has the potential to ignite a
powder keg of anger and misunderstanding.
Oh yes, another day at Swarthmore.
Are students really thatblind to what's
going on around them, or do they just not
want to face these problems hanging above
their heads (or right in front of them on
Mcgill Walk)?
Easter signifies a new beginning for all
Christians. Jesus has risen.
Perhaps we too can experience a new
beginning in which the attitudes we live by
will focus on our commonality first and
differences second. Only then will we be
able to address the racial problems and any
other hatred or misunderstandings which
exist here at Swarthmore or anywhere else in
the world.

Diversity Includes DU
To the Editor:

A disturbing occurrence on Thursday,
March 31st has prompted me to write to
the Phoenix. I was walking through Parrish
when a sign caught my attention-Alex
Juhasz Commemorative Keg Party." I
looked closer and was amazed to see an
invitation from the "boys ofDU" to come
celebrate "this ground breaking, outspoken example of emancipated womanhood." Angered Iproceeded to take down
about fifteen more signs plastered on the
walls in Parrish and Trotter. The implication, of course, was that the brothers of
Delta Upsilon were ecstatic at the imminent departure of a woman who is an
outspoken bisexual, feminist scholar and
faculty member. So ecstatic, as a matter
of fact, we would throw a "keg party" in
honor of her departure.
The only response I can direct to the
author of those signs is resentment. Resentment at voicing yet another stereo-

type on this most emancipated of college
campuses; resentment at the attitude directed towards fraternities by some members of this college; resentment at those
who advocate diversity but have a limited
definition of what it includes; resentment
that I will walk into Alex's class next
Wednesday and worry that she associates
me with that sign, and not with the letter
I sent long ago in protest of her
department's hiring decision. If the members of this College community are serious about the multicultural issues they
espouse, serious about "diversity," then
the challenge they face is to make it
accessible to all, and not limit it in any
way. It would be a serious error to fail to
recognize the unique nature offraternities
on this campus, and to fail to appreciate
that they have made, and continue to
make important contributions to Swarthmore College for over one hundred years.

Portnoy's Vision Inspires
By Kirsten Schwind
This Monday I woke up at 4:00 pm to
the tolling of the Tarble Bell Tower and
peeled my cheek off the page of my Poli
Sci book —a page with a number on it a
little lower than it should have been. At
thebegining of the sunny season I couldn't
resist trying to study on Parish
Beachzzzzzz....Four o'clock—Alicia
Portnoy is speaking in Bond. OK, weigh
my choices: finally catch up on Poli Sci
reading or hear a. writer speak from her
personal experiences about being a woman
subjected to Latin American political repression? I roll to my feet and stumble
down the hill, poking at theside ofmy face
(grass stuck to it) trying to make it take its
normal shape again.
Alicia Portnoy is a writer, poet, and
Vice-President of the Board of Directors
of Amnesty International, but the title that
impressed me morewas "desaparecida," a
politically terminated person in
Argentina's "Dirty War" of the seventies.
Sheread a small story from her bookabout
a woman enjoying a late morning in Buenos
Aires, padding down the hall in her
husband's slippers to answer the door.
The intensity of the knocking makes her
realize what standsd behind it. She turns
and scrambles toward the garden in back,
losing both slippers and finding her young
daughter. Unfortunately, the two cannot
hide in the weeds with soldiers stationed
on the surrounding rooftops. Alicia is
abducted to a secret prison camp where
she lives through fear, hunger, heat, cold,
and torture in the semi-darknessof a blindfold for several years.
Still perfecting her accent in English,
Alicia leaned in on the more difficultsounds
in her effort to enunciate the mush of our
vowels and consonants, and with this emphasis her speech hit a powerful rhythm as
it soared to a volume above polite speak-

ing level. She read her own stories and
poems from this period, as well as those
from other women who have writtenabout
their experiences withpolitical repression
in Latin America.
With respect to speakers, I believe
thereis a time for self-righteous agreement
and there is a time for critical cynicism.
However, there is also a time for honest
reflection on what you actually got out of
it. Alicia's talk strenghthened my lagging
belief in far-away events. I tend to forget
that they exist on sunny Swarthmore afternoons. What really made me lean foward
over my cheeseand grapes was theway she
talked. Who told this woman she could
raise her voice, or that we wanted our
peaceful afternoon interrupted with her
poems of pain (so naked I was almost too
embarrassed to hear them)? Who even told
her shecould write? Who advised it would
be "a sensible idea" to devote her life to
prisoners of conscience? Did the world
inviteher to write and rhyme and shout her
passion?
I watched her wondering ifI coulddo
the same, but her presence there already
answered my question. I left the reception
early—after such a one-sided searing
glimpse of soul how does one chat over
wine andcheese? Instead I sit here writing.
I could be writing as a woman who's a
sucker for anguished stories of political
repression, but I think I'm mostly writing
as confused young student trying to build
my role in the world, feeling as if I'm
wearing a blindfold now.
What I took from Alicia Portnoy's
talk (and what others may have takenfrom
Cornel West's later that evening) is that
although I may not always be able to see
whether anyone's listening, my voice too
can sound as strongly as hers. Raising that
voice may be the only way I can offer
anything unique, beautiful, and powerful
to the world.

Hate Speech Must Die
Our campus has been stained by ugly and disgraceful vandalism on Magill walk. In addition to an anti-PC diatribe, the graffiti
included a racist slur which has sparked student outrage and
community action. While the racist slur may or may not have been
written by the same individual, its juxtaposition with anti-PC
graffiti highlighted a fundamental flaw in the overblown debate
about political correctness on college campuses across the nation.
While many argue that a politically correct straitjacket has
asphyxiated free speech, this is far from reality. When people
generalize that anti-hate speech is anti-free speech, they make a
critical and painful error. Politically correct people see free speech
and hate speech as mutually exclusive. The only speech which
most "politically correct" people wish to truly censor is hate
speech, such as me racist slur which was written on Magill walk.
Admittedly, people's definitions of "hate speech" vary to exFor example, some politically correct people
that
women s lingerie ads qualify as hate speech; a majority would
likely categorize these ads as free speech, with no abusive intentions. PC people may not like uinesh D 'Souza or Phyllis Schlafly
have to say, but they will defend their rights to say
for what theySense,
it. Common
Swarthmore's conservative paper, which does
not represent a majority of students' opinions, has been acclaimed
by a majority of students for providing a needed outlet for
conservative ideology on this campus.
Peoplewhopoopoopolitical correctness are not beingcensored—nor is there any movement to do so. They might notbe liked by
all PC people, but there is no law saying that people must like eacn
other. They must simply like the Phoenix.
There is no placefor this language in any community. When
we as the editors of the Phoenix sayjiate speech must die, we are
speakim about abusive language, not all language. After this
incident, it is right to condemn the words, the act, or feel sorry for
the agent. It is also right to learn and grow from this encounter.
Now that it is spring, let us live by the land's example—here is
growth in spite of pain. That there is renewal ofground trampled

Meet the Jumping Cow
By Wendy Cholbi
The villeofSwarthmorehas long lacked
something many other college towns have—a coffee house, open late at night, where
students can hang out over cappuccino, dessert, and poetry. That gaphas now been filled
by the Jumping Cow.
For those of you who haven't ventured
ville-wards recently, the Jumping Cow is
located in the train station, on the site of the
lateSidetracks. Its hours are: Monday through
Wednesday, 7am to 9pm; Thursday and Friday, 7am to 12 midnight; Saturday, 12 noon
to spm and 7pm to 12 midnight; closed Sunday.
But what about Paces, you say? Doesn't
that fill our need for coffee and conversation?
Perhaps, but only from 9pm to 12 midnight on
three nights a week, conveniently the nights
that the Jumping Cow closes early. Paces has
Sunday Brunch, but the Jumping Cow has
breakfast, lunch, and dinner six days a week.
It would be a mistake to say that one
establishment is the same as the other. The
two are quite different in several ways—price, selection, and atmosphere. I won't talk
about prices, since the items that the two
places have in common are priced similarly.
But that's just it—they don't have many

etables.
Paces has muffins, store-bought bagels,
and delicious fresh-baked bread. The Jumping Cowhas huge crusty bagels, brought fresh
daily from Media, as well as muffins, giant
cookies, brownies, and biscotti. If you don't
know what a biscotto is, get one and try
dipping it in your coffee. Mmm!
This brings us to dessert. Paces is wellknown for its dessert specials, ranging from
pies to mousses to tortes. The Jumping Cow
doesn't have cakes or pies, but it does have
twelveflavors ofice cream and four of frozen
yogurt, plus at least ten toppings to choose
from. You can also get milkshakes of any ice
cream flavor, or their famous Espresso
Milkshake. No more long treks to the Village
Porch!
However, the main item most people
will order ateither place is coffee, in any of its
permutations. With more types of drinks,
such as Hot White Chocolate and Caffe Latte,
more flavors, and the added attraction of one
free refill if you bring your own mug, the
Jumping Cow is a clear winner in this category. There is a cappuccino bar with cinnamon, nutmeg, and cocoa, as well as sugar and
cream, to spice up your drink, which is guaranteed to be hot, rich, and smooth. The Jumping Cow also offers more varieties of tea.

The Jumping Cow is quite small, but
usually not crowded Perhaps this is because
you can order something at the counter 'to
go', which relieves you of the necessity of
sitting down. Also, with the coming of warm
spring weather, the outdoor tables are opening up. There are cute cow-spotted tablecloths, and in the evening you can play chess
or backgammon with theboards theyprovide.
They also show local artists' work on their
walls, and feature poets and singers most
weekends. Saturday, April 16th, they are holding a reading with three of our own student
poets: Sylvia Chong, Sarah DeWeerdt, and
David Sobel.
The Jumping Cow and Paces each offer
unique selections. It all depends on what
you're in the mood for. But do check out the

Listening in at Paces
By Sarah DeWeerdt and
Deirdre Edwards
(A conversation, between two
Swatties we'll call A and B, overheard inPaces. Transcribed by D.S.
Baatol.)
A: Ohmigod! Ijustsawafilm
by th:s artist from New Zealand! it
was beautiful, there were sheep everywhere!
B: Sheep? That's interesting.
New Zealand films are practically
becoming defined by their use of
the sheep motif, after years of being
in th: shadow of Australia's cinemati c hegemony.
A: Yeah, that's what she said.
She s es the sheep as a metaphor,
greater sustainability, large herds.
She was contrasting it to the bovinemythos of the industrialized West.
B: The bovine-mythos as it
appears in American films, you
mean? OrFrench films? I mean, in
French films the Derridean critique
of the bovine image is increasingly
complex and, I think, increasingly
irrelevant as we move into the postCold War era.
A: Totally! But what I see
about the American obsession with
the bovine is that our reach exceeds
our grasp. I mean, we want the cow,
the whole big, grandiose cow. We
want to feed it, milk it, butcher it,
and eat it. But when it comes down
to it, we just can't handle it. It's too
big, too much. Just look at fat-free
yogurt, skim milk, leanbeef. We're
trying to cut it down so that we can
grasp it, and thus lose its essence.
B: Absolutely! That's exactly
my point! And I think that if you
look at it from a post-Marxist, postpost-structuralist perspective, you
see that the semiology of the cow is
getting more and more divorced
from the physical reality. I think
that's particularly true of the discourse of the American paradigm,
where the essence of the cow is its
packaging in these commerciallyprepared forms.
A: Well, I think I see where
you're coming from, but I think

you're forgetting the roots of the
bovine-mythos in the imperialist
power structure. I mean, according
to Hume, long before there were
cows or sheep, there was the goat.
Thus, Freud's depiction ofthesemiphallic Ur-goat with massive horns
as a motivator in childhood. As the
sheep and cows moved in, they,
afraid of the goats' primal sexuality, attempted to destroy them. Now
we're only beginning to realize the
essential hypocrisy in the promise
of the cow, and slowly moving back
to primary caprinity.
B: You're right, totally, but I
think you can make a stronger case
than that. I mean, Freud's Ur-goat
is not semi-phallic, it is patently
phallic, and its horns reflect the primal male paternal anxiety as reflected in the cuckold jokes that go

Swat Track Meets Its Redeemer
By Eric Pakurar
The Haverford College men's
track team has a certain indescribable aura that gives the average Joe
Track-Runner the insatiable urge to
grolsch (onomatopoeia figure it
out), then run about frothing and
foaming like mad dogs. The meet
against Haverford was supposed to
be held on Haverford's sparkling
new red track last Friday, but the
track...well, it buckled. We're not
sure where or why it buckled, but
the fact remains that it buckled.
In the end, the April 1 meet was
moved to Swarthmore where the
whole campus got thechance to see
Swat track and field at its finest.
Haverford's football field inside
theirprided track now reads "Buckle
up, H.C." followed by a 45-foot
block "S", all in a pleasing shade of
garnet.

At the actual meet, Widener
and Ursinus made a showing, but
frankly, didn't pose enough of a
threat to make them worth mentioning. The rivalry between Swat and
Haverford is much more important
—puts the Hatfields and McCoys to
shame—and is chronicled thus:
Despite a strong showing by
Swarthmore in field events,
Haverford's depth in many events,

especially the long distance, racked
up points that simply overpowered
Swat and forced them to concede
the meet 54-89.
This is not to say that Swat's
long distance squad is not a force to
be reckoned with in the Centennial
Conference numbers just weighed
against us. Indeed, Scott Reents'96
laughed at Haverford's attempt at a
clean sweep of the 5000m, winning
the event formidably with a time of
15:03.5, just 4 seconds off the school
record.
Mike Tumer'94 turned in the
only Swatpoints in theshort sprints,
with impressive second places in
both the open 100 and 200m.
The hurdles proved to be profitable for the Swat men: In the
110 high hurdles, Nathan
Barbour'96 took third in 17.1 seconds. Eric Pakurar'97, Adam
Cole' 94, and Al Molnar'97 took
first, second andfourthrespectively
in the 400 m intermediate hurdles to
keep Haverford to only two points
in the event.
It was the field events, though,
where the skillofSwarthrnore'srelatively young team turned in huge
(read HEW-ge) performances and
kept Swarthmore in the thick of
things.

Garnet Tide baseball suffered a tough week, dropping its
record to 3-15 (0-3 conference

beginning on a rough note when
the Tide faced the mountainous
task of visiting the 17th ranked
Trenton State Bears on Wednesday. Thursday, the Garnetbanged
out 16 hits in a 13-6 thrashing of
Del Val. Saturday, the Tide traveled to face Western Maryland
for a double header. In the first
ball game, the GarnetTide lost 54, withthe Green Terrors scoring
a decisive run in the seventh inning. Finally, on Tuesday, the
Ursinus Bears visited Swat and
took home an 11-2 victory.

second in the 1500 m run.
And now for the speedy sprinters. They won BOTH relays, with
the 4xloo team consisting of Jill
Wildonger '97, Kim Killeen '97,
Dempsey, andTina Shepardson '94,
and the 4x400 relay composed of
Dempsy, Shepardson, Megan
Cunningham '95, and Wildonger.
Cunningham had a blueribbon day,
also capturing first in the 400
hurdles and first in the 400 sprint.
Davis placed fourth in both the 400
hurdles and the 100 m hurdles. Claire
Farel '97 placed fourth in the 400
sprint. Participating in the 200
sprint were Dempsy, Shepardson,
Wildonger, Killeen, and Farel. Using their fast-twitch muscles in the
100 sprint were Shepardson,
Killeen, and Wildonger.
Springing along in the triple
jump were Shepardson, Vondrasek,
and Killeen. Bounding in the long
jump were Shepardson, Dempsey,
and Vondrasek. Our six event
champ, Shepardson, won the long
jump and placed second in the triple
jump. VondrasekandKilleen placed
one and two in the high jump.
We'd like to thank all of our
spectators last week. For all of you
who missed the meet, start worrying. We'll just send out Joanna
Vondrasek, our one-woman demolition squad. The girl can run, jump,
and throw. You'll be squished in
about 2 seconds flat. But lucky you
will have a chance to REDEEM
yourself because we have one more
home meet which takes place next
weekend (April 16th). You should
come, and maybe forget about your
work for at least one measly hour?

our minds is: what next for Ted's

Women's Rugby had an incredible season start, playing intense games against Princeton and
Penn, ranked number 1 and 2 respectively in the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union (EPRU). On
March 26, number 3 ranked
Swarthmore lost a close game
against Penn A side, 8-5, with a try
by Lori Melichar. Swat then beat
Penn B side 20-0, in what was the
first game for many of the players.
After thisgame, Swat won an amazing game (54-0) against West
Chester.
The following Saturday Swat
played Princeton and although losing 15-5, the team scored against
Princeton for the first time. During
the game, Mel "Speed Demon"
Bonder perfected "the special" play,
also known as fake scissors. With
possession of the ball, Mel faked
consecutively to each player in the
back line, bewildering Princeton as
she dashed to the try line to score.
Star backs Rebecca Cole and rookie
Rachael Johnson astounded
Princeton with amazing kicks. The
forwards also had a terrific game.
Second row rookie Pia Houseal excelled in line outs andflankers Karen
Kleiber and Deb Cunningham supported the team well. Rookie Dana
Correale shone in the B side game,
playing both flanker and eight-man.
This week rugby heads to University ofWest Virginia.

Walton'97 and Kurk Selvarian'97
took second through fourth places
in the shot, Walton putting a personal record by three feet to clinch
third and shut Haverford out of the
scoring. Vagner and Walton also
placed one-two in the discus.
Sophomore Chris Henry won
the pole vault at a height of 12 feet
even, with Shan Sutherland '97 and
decathlete Sam Paschel '96 taking
second and third for a clean sweep.
Paschel strained his back taking fourth in the javelin, effectively
removing him from a large part of
the meet. Ignoring his painful injury, Paschel set the standard for
toughness and dedication, completing his field events and still capturing fourth place in the long jump
and high jump for Swat.
The mile relay team of Mike
Turner, Eric Pakurar, Adam Cole
and Walid "Mad Dog" Gellad dug
in hard and turned in the fastest time
this season by two seconds (3:31.3)
to take second place to Haverford's
first.
In numbers, Swarthmore did
not win, but nonetheless heldd the
huge moral victory. Swat buckled
downwhen Haverford's trackbuckled up, and scored better against the
arch-rivals than in any other confrontation in recent memory.

'Zards Best Albright
By Michael Topodas
In their thirdmatch this season,
the Swarthmore men's Rugby team
played as ifthey still had not recovered from the boisterous revelry
(read drunken stupor) of the postYork victory celabration. But as
Captian Avi Rao '95 put it, "Good
teams win, even when they play
crappy." The Buzzards emerged
victorious over a young and well
coached Albright team, but certainly
did not win in the most graceful
fashion.
The ruggers of Swarthmore
certainly had their chances to dominate and intimidate the sloppy
Albright team. Early in thefirst half,
scrum-half Justin "Run Straight"
McLean '95 retrieved the ball on a
goal-line ruck, faked a pass to the
try-lustful backline and sneaked in
for the score off weakside. Darin
Fries '95 made the conversion and
Swarthmore eased comfortably into
a seven point lead.
Catching the Buzzards napping, Albright lined their team
across the width of the field taking
advantage ofthe overpursuing Swat
defense. A nifty run by Albright's
midget outside center made the score
7-5.
Late in the half Swarthmore
adjusted to Albright's open-field
play. Ricky "Deion" Phillips '96
burst hard onto a pass from outside
center Guy "Wiggles" Danilowitz
'96 and flew through the Albright
backline, landing finally in the try
zone. Not feeling as cocky as last
