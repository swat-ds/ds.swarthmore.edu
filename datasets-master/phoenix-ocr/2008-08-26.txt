New observatory an asset to Astro department
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
Four years after the opening of the $74 million
Science Center, the college has fulfilled one of its
ambitions for the astronomy department by
installing the new Peter van de Kamp Observatory.
On Aug. 15, a crane lowered a shiny silver dome
atop a small room adjacent to the astronomy observatory deck on the roof of the Science Center.
Within the next few months, the installation of a
research-grade telescope will complete the observatory, setting Swarthmore's astronomy facilities on
par with those of rival institutions nationwide.
According to Assistant Professor of Astronomy
David Cohen, the installation of this telescope has
been in the plans all along. "The dome is new but
that rectangular room that it's on has been there
ever since the building was built, because the college knew that one way or another, we would eventually have a telescope."
The rectangular room that will house the telescope is vibrationally isolated from the rest of the
building. Adjacent to the room is the control room,
where professors, astronomers and students will be
able to adjust the telescope and examine data using
sophisticated computers and equipment.
Funding for the new observatory comes from
three sources. A National Science Foundation grant
covers the cost of the telescope, as well as pay for
studentresearchers. An anonymous donation by an
alumna made in the name offormer astronomy professor and director of the Sproul Observatory Peter
van de Kamp funds the dome. Finally, the

Mara Revkin Phoenix Staff

The astronomy department will benefit from a new facility this year: the
Peter van de Kamp Observatory. The new dome, installed in August, will
soon be outfitted with a research-grade telescope.

Astronomy Department's "Scientific Equipment
Fund" pays for computers and other specialized
equipment to be used in conjunction with the telescope, Cohen said in an e-mail.
According to Cohen, the astronomy department
began the process of applying for a grant from the
National Science Foundation five or six years ago.

"Our goal for a long time has been to develop a facility here... where students who want to get involved
in astronomical research here on campus have

modern equipment, a modern telescope, to do that
research," Cohen said.
After three attempts, Professor of Astronomy
Eric Jensen and Cohen succeeding in winning a
$3104.09 grant from the NSF to "acquire a 0.6-meter
research telescope ... which will be used with a separately-funded camera and spectrograph for faculty
and studentresearch."
For many, the arrival of the new telescope is a
long-awaited event. Colin Schimmelfing 'lO, an
astronomy major, has been anticipating the
research-grade telescope ever since last summer,
when, while working on an astronomy-related computer program with Professor Eric Jensen, he happened to spot an invoice left in the printer for an
expensive new telescope. He remembers feeling
really excited, especially for the "amazing" spectroscopy device. "Hopefully I'll be able to take data
with it to use over the summer. Maybe I'll find
something no one else has."
Zach Sinemus 'lO, who plans to major in
Astronomy and Philosophy, is also looking forward
to using the telescope. "It'd be great if we actually
Especially since it
get to use the observatory
means we won't have to be outside in freezing
weather to look at the sky," he said in an e-mail.
Both astronomy majors are likely to use the telescope in the future, for it is especially suited for
...

advanced labs and research. "Students will work on
big ongoing research projects that the astronomy
professors already have under way, and we'll hire
students to make observations and analyze data,"
Cohen said.
The telescope will particularly serve those who
plan to pursue graduate degrees in astronomy.
"Maybe half our majors go on to grad school, and
most astronomy grad students have to go or get to
go observing in places like Arizona and California
and Hawaii and Chile, which are sort of the four
main places where there are big telescopes, and
when our graduates get to those telescopes in major
observatories, we want them to have had

For international students, early arrival eases the adjustment to a new college and culture
Thirty-Five students hailing from countries as distant as Brunei and Kenya
arrived on campus last Saturday for a
three-day orientation. The international
students defied the effects of jet lag as they
navigated a lively schedule of events
including an ice scream social, a barbeque
in Wharton courtyard and an excursion to
Phffly.

Orientation volunteer Frances Kvietok
10 said that the first day's events focused
on familiarizing new students with their
environment and introducing them to
peers. "We have several ice breakers
planned as well as trips to Target in order
to help people settle in and get to know

each other better," Kvietok 10 said on
Saturday.
International Orientation was not
always so elaborate. When Gloria Evans
first assumed her role as international students adviser, "There wasn't much orientation programming for international students," Evans said. "Years ago, orientation
consisted of a 30-minute session in the
admissions office. I recognized that international students could benefit from a
more thorough introduction to the college," Evans said.
Over the years, Evans expanded the
initially modest schedule of events to an
elaborate three-day affair packed with
speakers, tours and social events. Evans

THE PHOENIX

has also made an effort to include practical sessions addressing topics such as the
American banking system, with which
many international students are unfamiliar. "Students really seem to appreciate
the weekend. A few have already
approached me to request volunteer positions at next year's orientation," she said.
Alice Xiang 10 and Michael Xu 11, the
co-presidents of the international club,
began preparing for the event last spring.
They and volunteers kept in touch with
the students over the summer.
Adriana Pope 12, a new student from
Romania, saw Swarthmore's campus for
the first time on Saturday. "I didn't get a
chance to visst [Swarthmore] before, but I
guess that would have spoiled the surprise. I adore it... and nothing 1 had imagined could compare," Pope said.
The scheduled activities have been
helpful to Pope, but she said that informal
interactions with peers were actually the
most informative. In conversations with
other students over the weekend, she was
alerted to the presence of insects and mice
in some dorms a piece of information
that informed her selection of merchandise from Target. "My first acquisition at
Swarthmore was bug spray from Target.
I'm going back today for mousetraps,"
Popa said.

said.
However, underclassmen and incoming students shouldn't anticipate extensive use of the
new telescope
at least not immediately.
"Probably Astro 1 students will be able to use the
telescope too, for something recreational, like
looking at Saturn," Cohen said, "but we're not
sure how useful it will be for intro level courses."
Lauren Cardenas 'l2, an incoming first-year,
hadn't heard about the new observatory before
arriving at Swat, but plans to take astronomy
classes at the college. "I think that's pretty sweet
to have all these new resources," she said.
Currently, the biggest telescope on campus
resides in Sproul Observatory. Astronomers and
those pursuing astronomy master's degrees in the
1950s often used the older telescope. In order to collect data, students had to expose a photographic
plate coated with chemicals to light for hours,
develop the plate in a darkroom, and use a magni-

fying glass to examine the stars. Although this telescope was obsolete for modern research, the
department began opening it up every second
Tuesday to allow community members to peer at
faraway stellar bodies in the night sky.
Astronomy students have been usingrelatively
small, portable telescopes for their nighttime

observations on the observation deck atop the
Science Center. However, professors have had to
travel to other institutions and locations across
the world to conduct up-to-date research. With the
new telescope, professors and astronomers from
all over the nation will be able to conduct their
own research at the college.
Whether the Peter van de Kamp Observatory
will draw more students into the astronomy
department, nobody can be sure. "I hope that it'll
bring more people into the astronomy fold,
because it's not a very visible department,"
Schimmelfing said.
The Peter van de Kamp Observatory is LEEDcertified, which means it has been examined by
the Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design and deemed an "environmentally responsible, profitable and healthy place to live and work."

New face in the dean's office
Rachel Head recently assumed
her role as Assistant Dean of
Residential Life, a position vacated
after Liz Derickson 'Ol left to attend
graduate school. Holding a Bachelor
of Science from Florida State
University and a Master of
Education from University of South
Florida, Head comes to Swarthmore
with years of experience in both residential programs and social work.
In e-mail correspondence with
Phoenix Managing Editor Kaitlin
Kyi, Head elaborated upon the
changes she hopes to bring about as
assistant dean.
Kaitlin Kyi: First of all, welcome
to Swarthmore! At the time of publication, you will already have been situated here for around 8 weeks. How

RH: I can honestly say that I am

Dartmouth was unique in that 1) I
had the opportunity to work with
the Advancement Office stewarding
donor monies and 2) I had the opportunity to work closely with members of the faculty to develop curriculums for learning outside of the
classroom. I am not sure that the
need
is the same
here at
Swarthmore. There is already a
strong culture of faculty and student
interaction that is evidenced by the
commitment of the College to undergraduate involvement in research,
experiential learning, and peer-topeer instruction.

might be able to bring something to
the table here at Swarthmore. For

know that students say that they

There are a lot of simple things that
individuals can do to help increase
security in the dorms. Not propping
doors is probably the simplest thing
that everyone can do. I know that

Swarthmore has a pretty open com-

munity where people trust each

other, but, simply pushing a door
shut anytime you see it open is probably the most effective way to
increase security anywhere.
KK: Is there any possibility residential dorm doors might one day be
opened by swipe-card keys?
RH: I think anything is possible
but, from what I have learned since
I've been here, there are a number of
factors that are being taken into
account as swipe-cards are being
considered, including the cost associated with that type of system and
the logistics of trying to upgrade so
many different buildings with so
many different doors. I know that
there are many people who feel
strongly about the issue. It is something that was really important to
the students I met during my interview As with any important issue,
we are open to hearing what everyone has to say.
KK: If you had to choose, what
dorm would you most want to live in?
RH: This is a great question!

either
Palmer/Pittenger, because I love
how every room is different and
unique, or in Worth (again, the
spaces are unique and have a lot of
character).
KK: Any personality quirks or
traits we might lookforward to when
stopping by Parrish 116?
RH: First off, I really do encourage people just to stop by. It is kind
of exciting being the new person in
town. I can't wait for the students to
get here this week so I can get to
know everyone. As for quirks or
traits, I do have this serious fear of
dogs, so, don't be surprised ifI freeze
up if a student comes walking in
with a huge dog.

ARTS AND LEISURE AT SWAT
I Bamboo Garden

Swarthmore's Bamboo Grove is an unexpected, but much appreciated, burst of botanical

diversity.

2. Beardsley

Home to both Art and Art History courses, this building is the perfect place to eavedrop on a
lecture on Western Art, or, to take one of those sculpture or Contempoary Art classes yourself.

3. Bender Oak

Rather than let the ancient oak deteriorate, artist Marty Long transformed this rare hybrid
tree into a sculpture in the form of an oak leafand acorn intended as an "ode to oaks."

4. Calder Mobile

Sculpted by famed American artist and mobile inventor Alexander Calder, this colorful structure is entitled "Back from Rio." The mobile is covered by a prickly undergrowth to discourage
students from spinning this priceless work of art.

5. Crum Creek

Crum Creek is the famed site of the Crum Regatta, during which students equipped with paddles and their own makeshift and rarely seaworthy "boats" tough out the chilly waters in a harrowing 500-meter race. With its shallow waters and gentle rapids, Crum Creek is also a favorite
place for a refreshing paddle or a late night swim with friends.

6. Hicks

Venture to the third floor to view the murals painted by James Egleson '29. The panels depict
themes of racial solidarity, technological progress and perhaps, as an outraged College donor

once protested, a healthy dose of Communist propoganda.

7. Kitao Gallery

This intimate art gallery is run entirely hy students and features student art, as well as
themed events such as a Recycled Runway fashion show.

8. Lang Music Building

This venue provides a gorgeous view of the Crum to complement its a cappella concerts,
music recitals, and the all-important screening of "The Graduate." Grab a private practice room
and make some of your own music.

9. Lang Performing Arts Center

LPAC is the arts epicenter of Swarthmore. Student thespians, musical acts like The Roots and
even high-profile celebrities like Margaret Cho have all graced the stage.

10. List Gallery

The List Gallery's stark white walls feature exhibits ranging from John Dubrow's contemporary oil paintings to Brian Meunier's whimsical clay pieces. This year, look forward to Sonya
Clark's hair comb sculptures and Bill Scott's abstract paintings.

II McCabe Exhibits

A procrastinator's paradise, these exhibits have featured everything from Banned Books to
lithographs by Andy Warhol.

12. Old Tarble

Olde Tarble is primarily used as Art Department studio space. Even if you aren't taking art
classes, make sure to stop by and admire fellow students' artwork-in-progress.

13. Olde Club

Olde Club's very structure, thanks in part to its art-splattered stairwell, seems to breathe art.
The venue frequently hosts indie musicians ranging from the ranks of Broken Social Scene to
Jay Reatard and is also the site of the annual Battle of the Bands and student open mic nights.

14. Rose Garden

Since 1898, the Dean Bond Rose Garden has perfumed the campus with the fragrance of its 660
roses. The garden, encircled by intricately wrought iron gates known as Josephine's Gates, features over 213 types of roses.

15. Science Center

Who says art and science can't coexist? Comedy shows, plays and movie screenings all take

place here.

Take a walk towards the President's House to the whispering bench with a friend and sit at

With a little help from my friends
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

Although orientation does a good job of acclimatizing both incoming freshmen and transfer
students to the wonderfully unique environment
that is Swarthmore, it cannot teach you everything. As a supplement to the information
imparted to new students during orientation,
The Phoenix offers you some pearls of wisdom
all volunteered by veteran Swatties to help
you ease into campus life.

Respect the Sharpies Lines

Philadelphia is Close and Media is Closer
Your first semester at Swathmore can be
very overwhelming and it is easy to feel
trapped on campus. However, try to make
some time to take the R3 into Philadelphia to
explore the restaurants, museums, film
screenings and historical sights that the city
has to offer.

If the twenty five minute ride into Center
City is too much, start out by going to Media,
which is also on the R3 line and has a fair
number of great places to eat. For a special
treat, check out Fellini's Cafe on a Monday
night. The waitresses will sing opera while
you attempt to finish a more than generous
helping of pasta.

Now that it has been established that
Sharpies is not, in fact, terrible, you might want
to spend a little bit more time in the food lines
browsing for options and assembling the perfect
breakfast burrito. Unless you feel like incurring
the wrath of hungry Swatties, it is best to get the
items you will need for the perfect breakfast burrito and then assemble the aforementioned burrito when you are sitting down at a table. Lines
are often long and all will be happier if they
move fairly quickly.

Swarthmore has a Philly Car Share Space
If you do not feel like taking SEPTA or need
a car, the borough of Swarthmore was recently equipped with a Philly Car Share space.
Anyone over the age of 18 who has a valid driver's license is eligible to register for the service online. With many different rental rates,
Philly Car Share makes it easy to acquire a

Have Movie Nights

and start driving.

vehicle. Go to phillycarshare.org to sign up
Instead of watching films on a small laptop
screen or in the noise of Mephisto's, you can
reserve a room in Kohlberg, Science Center 101
or Science Center 199, which come equipped
with a projector and large screen. To obtain one
of these spaces for an* evening, simply click on
the "reserve space" link on the student dashboard.

You Can Get Locked In McCabe
Although you are clearly alerted to leave
McCabe when 2 a.m. rolls around, it is possible
to sleep through or blatantly ignore the warnings. After the lights are shut off and the'doors
are locked, the innocent library becomes something akin to a terrifying labyrinth. There are
horror stories floating around campus about students groping fearfully in the dark to find a way
to escape. Do not let this happen to you.

Papazian has Roof Access
Enough said.

Ask Questions
The best way to get to know Swarthmore is
by asking a lot of questions. Students, faculty,
and staff are extremely approachable and are
happy to guide you if you are lost. On a similar note, it is also completely okay to ask your
professor for an extension on a paper or project. It can feel embarrassing to request more
time but professors usually do not regard it as
a big deal if you approach them ahead of the
due date.

Swarthmore Is Beautiful
You have probably been
told that
Swarthmore's campus is an arboretum more

Old friends, bookends: reflecting on Orientation 2007
BY EVA AM ESSE
eamessel@swarthmore.edu

This semester I've returned to Swarthmore early as a
CA leader and I am truly enjoying being on campus without the pressure of choosing classes, taking placement
exams and learning how to navigate the campus. I am
especially a fan of those "running-toward-each-othersmiling" hellos from my friends. Of course, last year this
time I felt differently
as much as I loved what I had
heard about Swat, I couldn't help but wonder if it really
was the perfect college for me. As an incoming freshman,
I was really anxious about arriving on campus for orientation. I worried about how I would fit in at Swarthmore,
what my living situation would be like and whether or
not I would get along with my roommates, hallmates and
RA. I even wondered whether it would be more appropriate to greet the people I would meet on my hall with a
warm huge or with a more polite handshake.
My anxiety towards the overwhelming newness of
everything was quickly eased by the warm welcome I
received from both the new students and upperclassmen
alike. The very first Swattie I "met" last year was Miyuki
Baker 'IL As I sat in the backseat of the family Subaru a
couple of miles down the road from Swarthmore, my family and I noticed a girl in the car next to me laughing at
the amount of stuff crammed into our car. I had a feeling
she was a Swattie, so at the next light I rolled down the
window and nervously introduced myself. "Hi! I'm Eva.
I'm a freshman." I found out that she was a freshman too,
but all her stuff was in her dad's car. As the light turned
green, we bid goodbye and I smiled knowing that there
were so many more people to meet that day. Literally, the

8

moment I stepped out of my car and into the parking lot
two CAs were offering to help me move in and minutes
later I remember my neighbor, Ambar Laforgia 'll, greeting me with a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. I was
slightly shocked at her immediate affection towards me,
but very thankful that someone skipped out on that awkward "nice to meet you" head nod. The fact that people
were happy to meet me during orientation and seemed
genuinely interested in getting to know me was a pretty
big deal. For me, this spoke to the level of respect students have for each other at Swarthmore and it eased my
concerns about being the "new kid" on campus.
One of my favorite bonding activities during last
year's Orientation was the unforgettable campus-wide
Trust Walk. At first it was terrifying and I kept kicking
all sorts of people and objects, but after the first fifteen
minutes my group got the hang of things and started to
warn each other before going up staircases or jumping
over curbs. I can still remember hearing my group
marching all over campus singing "I'll Make A Man Out
Of You" and hearing lots of laughter from passing CA
groups. I was in complete awe when we arrived at the
secret destination and we were asked to do some selfreflection as a class. I felt that my inhibitions to trust the
students around me and act like myself were erased
when we were all blind (literally) in this somewhat awkward and slightly scary situation together. Trust makes
relationships work and it seems to be something that
Swat prides itself on, and so I thought that this was a
great way to bring the entire class together for something fun while simultaneously introducing the freshman to a community where trust and honesty are valued

and the students are treated like adults.
•August 26, 2008

First Collection also helped instill in me an idea of
what Swat's unique sense of community was really like.
I can still remember exactly where I was sitting in the
amphitheater,, the way the lighting of all 365 candles
evoked this warm feeling of connectedness and how our
attempt to learn Swarthmore's Alma Mater lightened the
mood and brought a smile to the candle lit faces. I also

felt an awesome sense of community while watching
"The Graduate" with the entire student population the
night before classes started. Hearing the seniors singing
along to "The Sound of Silence" and shouting out their
favorite lines made appreciative of this small school
where I could share all of these quirky cool traditions
with so many intelligent and interesting people. I believe
that the Orientation traditions help create memories,
make great first impressions and reinforce the great
things about Swarthmore's open-minded and close-knit
community.

As for my initial fear of not fitting in, it didn't take me
to long to find students I could relate to; many of the people I spent time with during Orientation are my best
friends here, and while others have sort of dropped off
my radar, I do run into them at Tarble, where we remind

each other of how much fun we had on our Trust Walk or
agree how ridiculous it is that we never see each other
anymore. My Orientation experience had its moments,
feelings of homesickness, confusion about the course lottery process, and even fear of not finding a seat in
Sharpies, but the good certainly outweighed the bad.
Now, as a CA, WAM and sophomore I hope to give the
freshman a warm welcome, provide them with the support I appreciated so much, and honor the Swarthmore

traditions that make this place so unique.

BY YOEL ROTH

yrothl@swarthmore.edu

I operate under the assumption that
most people are genuinely good people
who genuinely mean well. Nevertheless, I
also operate under the assumption that
you and your roommate will fight, as have
countless pairs of roommates before you.
For the six of you who have found the
perfect roommate you can get along with
one hundred percent of the time, stop
reading now, and try again once the honeymoon has ended in a week or two.
But given it's a near statistical certainty that you and your roommate will eventually argue about something, it would be
a waste of a perfectly good soapbox to
write about how to avoid conflict.
Instead, I'd like to spend my time taking a
good, long look at what happens when
cohabiting college students actually do
disagree. Once the orientation bonanza
has ended and life at Swarthmore actually
begins, what do you do when your roommate, inevitably, begins to seem insufferable?
Whether roommate offenses are real or
merely stress-induced hallucinations,
dorm room disagreements all boil down to
questions of aggression. On nearly every
scale, aggression is easy to spot.

Despite all this, it seems that within
the bounds of a college dorm room the
standard rules of aggression disintegrate.

When it comes to our
roommates, are we simply
incapable of behaving
rationally? Sadly, the
answer seems to be "yes."
The microbial world is teeming with
bacteria slaughtering each other at the
rate of several million per second. (Life is
hard as a unicellular organism, it turns
out.) The strangler fig grows atop and
ultimately kills its host tree in a battle for
sunlight and nutrients. Male elephant
seals, the largest living carnivores, are
known for their vocal and often violent
conflicts over females during mating sea/
son.

The microbial world is
teeming with bacteria
slaughtering each other at
the rate of several million
per second.
Humans, arguably the most aggressive

of all creatures, routinely destroy each
other over issues from the right of two
men to marry to the right of the country
of Georgia to have its own entry in the
World Book Atlas. We've even developed
these fancy things known as Weapons of
Mass Destruction to make aggression that
much easier and more brutal.

THE PHOENIX

While Wikipedia tells me that my aggressive tendencies are centered in my hypothalamus and something called the "periaqueductal gray midbrain," it mentions
little about where, exactly, in the human
psyche or physiology the tendency to pas-

sive-aggressive behavior originates. And
given passive-aggression is par for the
course in roommate-roommate relations,
this seems like a pretty glaring oversight.
One candidate theory is that passiveaggression is a social construction based
on the supposition that certain people in
the dean's office would probably be
unhappy if students beat up their roommates. By this logic, in lieu of violence

and confrontation, Swarthmore students
may turn to any of the following tools for
keeping their roommate rage in check:
L Fiery but conspicuously unlabeled
Live Journal entries, which immediately
make the rounds on campus faster than a

bad viral video.
2. Facebook status updates along the
lines of "Yoel is in desperate need of noisecanceling headphones" or "Yoel didn't
come in drunk at 3 a.m. and trip over his
bookshelf, unlike someone he knows" or
"Yoel's room smells bad and he doesn't
know why."
3. Hushed conversations in Sharpies
and McCabe with anyone but your roommate about your roommate's latest offense
against mankind.
4. Shooting puzzled glances at your

roommate's side of the room every few
minutes while writing a paper, as if to say,
"You're actually listening to that without
headphones?" .
5. Loud, staged conversations with
yourself on the subject of "Where did all
the granola bars go, since I know I didn't
eat them?"

And so on. Conspicuously absent from
this list of conflict suppression methods is
the relatively straightforward "have a
calm and collected discussion with your
roommate and attempt to resolve the issue
at hand in a reasonable manner." Which
begs the question: when it comes to our
roommates, are we simply incapable of
behaving rationally?
Sadly, the answer seems to be "yes."
The single most difficult thing for a
Swarthmore student to do is admit that he
might be wrong about anything. For an
open-minded, progressive campus full of
intellectual heavyweights, it's a not-sosurprising fact that the idea that one
might be mistaken on even the most trivial of issues is anathema, ergo the difficulty of resolving disagreements. When
no one wants to admit that they're wrong,
problems fester just below the surface,
turning a dorm room into the staging

ground of a miniature Cold War.
Thus, the first step to resolving a conflict is acknowledging that, just as your
roommate's
nail-clipping/pentapping/music-listening/phonecalling/video-gaming may be making you
insane, you're probably making them just

as irritated with your obnoxious ringtone/strong

cologne/late

night

visitors/rotten food/dirty laundry.

Once you've accepted the inevitability
that you are just as challenging to live
with as your roommate, it becomes infinitely easier to have a substantive discussion with him about your concerns, set
boundaries, and actually resolve conflicts.
And when it comes to surviving the year
without having to bribe the college administration for an emergency single, that
critical step of mutually recognizing problems where they exist makes all the difference.

BY PHIL ISSA
pissal@swarthmore.edu

By the first Thursday of my freshman year, I
had already arrived at the same revelation that
everyone else had about my new school: nobody is
pretty. Yes, it was a bit hyperbole, and yes, my judgment was hasty, but between the Daily Jolt and the
relentless exhortations from sophomores and juniors that Swarthmore is, in fact, the ugliest school
on the planet, I found my conclusion decidedly
hard to shake. So, this year, in an effort to preempt
the debate on just how ugly Swarthmore is for the
144th year running, I have decided to see what
scholars have to say about the age-old question: are
smart people ugly? It turns out that the answer is,
"No."
You may think that it is self-evident that intelligence and physical beauty are uncorrelated. After
spending a few months (or nights) on this campus,
you may find yourself thinking that it is self-evident that intelligence and physical beauty are actually negatively correlated. In a paper published in
Psychological Bulletin in 1992, psychologist Alan
Feingold found that there is no correlation between
the two attributes, using GPA and standardized test
scores as measures of intelligence.

Psychologist Leslie Zebrowitz (presumably
equine) conducted a similar study ten years later
using IQ as her measure of intelligence and found
that there is no correlation between intelligence
and facial symmetry or distinctiveness, two attributes that are positively correlated with attractiveness and that are largely prescribed by genetics.
This suggests that, all other things held equally, we

Swarthmore students are blessed with the same
pretty faces as everybody else. Are we squandering
all this average natural beauty for below-average
attractiveness?
Discussions about whether we should conform
to the modern age's prevalent norms of beauty can,
and no doubt will, go on forever; discussions about
whether we Swarthmore students are attractive

should not.
Overall attractiveness is a definable and obtainable ideal; it transcends norms and stereotypes and

and distinct personality, and keeping those blessed
faces and bodies in shape and reasonably groomed.
Fortunately for us, nature has made it easy to
pursue these four traits in conjunction. Exercise,
for instance, not only keeps us fit, but it also helps
to build self-esteem, so make those PE credits
count. Another great example would be to stop complaining about how repulsive everybody is. This is
a two-for-one deal no one likes complainers and
the rest of us enjoy marginally higher self-esteem.
-

"After spending a few months
on this campus, you may find
yourself thinking that...
intelligence and physical beauty
are negatively correlated."

...

...

I'm no expert on self-esteem or beauty. However,
I can imagine a feedback loop at work here that will
lift us all out of the gutter: We all stop publically
complaining and privately judging, which will
boost self-esteem. Already, our attractiveness is
going up. The relaxed atmosphere will allow us to
explore our own identities and feel more secure
about ourselves. This way, we'll feel more comfortable trying new things (like socializing, exercising,
and not acting like buffaloes in heat at Paces) and
appreciating the diversity of backgrounds and
lifestyles represented at the school. As such, we'll
also feel more comfortable developing our own
uniquely attractive personalities, and we'll become
more interesting people, too. Attractiveness continues to rise, and the school is even more relaxed.
This cycle continues until we won't even have anything to complain about anymore.
My point is this: Everybody, calm down, and
let's hold our heads up high. We're all (potentially)
good-looking.

What the internet can't tell you
about your first year in college
BY JEFF DAVIDSON
jdavidsl@swarthmore.edu
My last summer after high
school was jam-packed with
vacations, fast-paced adventures, and minimal relaxation
time. In the end, it was a summer like any other. But every
day there loomed that unthinkable change
always inching
closer, until finally there are
less than 100 hours before I
enter my first year
at

Swarthmore.
The days became choppier,
the tension grew, and my feelings scattered. One day I was
filled with enthusiasm thinking of all the wonderful people
I am about to meet; the next it
is a pounding fear of the academic rigor.
Everyone

at

this

point

understands the implications
of living away from watchful
parenting eyes. But as the time
of my departure grew closer, I

found myself growing more
apprehensive about leaving.
I needed to research, I needed to discover, I needed
answers, and I needed them
now. Unfortunately in the end
this fear of not knowing only
lead to more stress on that
very issue.

My personal diagnosis of

the problem at the time told
me that I required more stuff
for my room. The guest room
of my house became the storage bin for my dorm "essentials." This collection included, but clearly was not limited
to, a set of seven tooth brushes, an industrial-sized Suave
Men's body wash, a stash of 357
paper Dixie cups, and a bag of
bed linens and towels that
could easily swallow several
persons.
The closer my upstairs hallway got to impassable, the
more I questioned how my delicate, simple life would handle
such a drastic change filled
with so many unnecessary

commodities.
Faced with this challenge, I
confronted it like any techsavvy student would: I hit up
the hot new Macßook Pro. The
World Wide Web is a resource
that, most importantly, brings

people from anywhere in the
world to a singular location in

one must wonder where the

In fact, most of the college

Fall sports teams returned to campus this week to
jumpstart their seasons with pre-season training.
Volleyball, field hockey and soccer players descended on
the Field House for daily practice sessions and nonConference scrimmage games.
Field Hockey
Field hockey dominated in their first scrimmage on
Saturday, beating Widener University six to one. This
win came as a result of the team's hard work in pre-season according to sophomore Sophia Ferguson. "We have
been working on cementing our fundamental skills and
working as a cohesive unit," Ferguson said. "We have
high hopes for the season despite our small numbers."
The team this year has 15 players with one of those players injured, leaving only two field player subs for the season.
However, the team does not expect this lack of players
to be a problem for the season unless other injuries
occur. The team also has a new coaching staff. Head
coach Lauren Fuchs is replacing Kelly Wilcox, who
coached the team for the last six seasons, to become the

Men's Soccer
Coming off of a training trip in Argentina and Brazil
and an August 23 Alumni Game win, the men's soccer
team is optimistic about the upcoming fall season and

the new freshman class.
"In the games we played in Brazil and Argentina, we
were all very challenged," Omari Faakye 'lO said. "We
played against guys who are paid to play soccer, so we
were really challenged. I think we learned a lot from
their style of playing. If we can play as strong [this season] as we did in Brazil, I think that will be great,"
Faakye said.
In the August 23 Alumni Game, recent alums had a
strong showing against the Garnet men. "A lot of recent
graduates came back for the alumni game, like Pat
Christmas, Michael Bonesteel, and Andrew Macurdy. It
was a young alumni team so there was a lot of pressure
on us," Jason Thrope 'O9 said. "In the end we came
through 2-1, but I don't think we scored as much as Coach
Wagner would have liked."
A strong freshman class will help support the team
this season, according to Faakye. "The team has the
most talented players this season in the history of men's

soccer," Faakye said. "We have 32 people right now, and
I don't know how the coach is going to make cuts. There
are about 12 to 14 freshmen trying out, and everyone is
talented. I think we'll have a great season," he said.
"I would guarantee conference championships for
us," Gage Newman 'll said.
Thrope said there is strong team unity, even this early
in the season. "I think we have some really great freshmen. They've really blended in with the team quickly,"
Thrope said.
"It doesn't seem like there is a division between classes. It's less class-oriented and more about the team. I
think it's good for team morale and will help us play better together."
Men's soccer has a slew of upcoming games this
Friday, including a scrimmage against Skidmore as part
of the Garnet Alumni Classic at Swarthmore.

Women's Soccer
The members of the Women's Varsity Soccer team
had their best season ever last year, and hope to have an
even better one this fall. The team is led by Todd
Anckaitis, who is beginning his fourth year as the coach
of the Garnet women.
