The second argument was that if

have perspectives which are
rarely heard in the mainstream
media—or in the ongoing welfare debate. As Finkle remarked
at the opening reception for the
exhibit, "We've all developed
these blinders. We call it welfare
reform, but it's really a shredding: the shredding of the social
safety net, which eventually affects everyone." As for his own
role in helping movements like
the KWRU, Finkle said, "I like to
think of my stuff as influencing
the debate—putting stuff in front
of theireyes that [the public] may
not see in their local newspapers."

Smoking in Tarble, which continues even
in violation of College policy, has been the
subject ofmuch controversy and debate. Since
1993, smoking has been prohibited in indoor
public spaces, yet students continue to smoke
in Tarble lounge. This activity has caused
rnntr"v/-ri- v over no" smokers' lights, the
dangers of second hand smoke are the feasibility of creating a smokers' lounge on campus.
Some students argue that smoking in Tarble
makes thespace uncomfortableand unhealthy
for non-smokers. "The lounge is not sectioned off from the eating area, which makes
it rather difficult to eat your lunch," said a
junior on Swat Talk. Students also complain
because Tarble is the entrance to the game
room, Paces, and the all campus space.
Some smokers feel that the unenforced
policy is unfair. "I believe that the rules
governing smoking on campus are utterly
nonsensical and unfair to smokers," said
Sergio Villegas 'OO. I feel no obligation to
obey an unjust law." Other smokers, however, voluntarily refrain from smoking in
Tarble. "I cannot personally get much pleasure out of my nasty habit when I'm feeling
self-conscious about it and where it's going
to make people miserable," said Elizabeth
Nickrenz '99.
At the core of the debate is student disagreement about the degree ofharm inflicted
by second-hand smoke. A sophomore remarked, "I shouldn't have to sit around and
breath in carcinogens because some of the
people around me have no interest in their
health, and don't respect mine." In contrast,
one non-smoker, Dave Mimno '99 commented that the fear of second hand smoke is
"a bit exaggerated...aren'tmost ofthe studies
of second-hand smoke based on people who
have chainsmoking relatives in their households?" In order to placate the two sides,
some students suggest the creation of a
smoker's lounge. Ngina Lythcott, Dean of
the College, also a public health professional,
said "I think it would be possible for the
College to identify a spot where people who
hadn't stopped smoking yet could smoke."
An anonymous sophomore objected to the
suggestion, "Giving smokers their own lounge
doesn't seem terribly fair because it takes
away from the already limited campus space."
Students have informally suggested various locations for the lounge: Parrish sth
lounge, Old Tarble, the game room or Olde
Club, Sharpies 3 and the room adjoining
Paces.
In addition to the smoker's lounge option,
a number of suggestions have been proposed
to alleviate the problem. In a Swat Talk
conversation, David Phillips '99 suggested
the possibility of installing powerful suction
vents in the lounge." Al Bloom suggested
that a student groupredo the Tarble lounge in
order to discourage smoking, because "if it
were more aesthetically appealing, perhaps
people would respect it, like Kohlberg Coffee Bar." Fred Bush '9B suggested that,
rather than continuing futile debate, students
can put together a petition calling for a referendum on the issue.
Deans have the power to discipline students who violate the policy through suspension or dismissal, but currently, administration most frequently gives only warnings to
smokers in Tarble and no further action is
taken. A Student Council working group is
currently evaluating what students perceive
to be the largest problem with Tarble, which
includes a question about smoking.

two greedy, corrupt families, the

Capulets and the Montagues, are violently struggling for power. Both
families are represented by their respective gangs, whose members (including the Capulet's Tybalt, played
by John Leguizamo, and the
Montague's Romeo and his friend
Mercutio, portrayed by Harold
Perrineau) tote human-size guns and
shoot up everything within their enemies' path.
Romeo, the son of Ted Montague
(Brian Dennehy), is a rebellious lad in
search of true love. Juliet, the daughter of Fulgencio Capulet (Paul
Sorvino), yet raised by her boisterous, roly-poly nurse (Miriam
Margolyes), is a strong-willed lassie
in search of true love. Consequently,
at a wild Halloween party, the two go

together. However, as their love
progresses further into marriage and
sex, the parents' strong dislike for
each other causes a distinct problem
for the duo. Although Romeo and
Juliet are assisted by the nurse and
new-order Friar Laurence (Pete
Postlethwaite), an unfortunate twist
of fate eventually condemns the
young lovers. (We won't give away
the end, but, this time around, Juliet
uses a gun rather than a dagger.)
This movie is to be admired for
several reasons. First, BazLuhrmann,
the director/cowriter/producer, ingeniously imagines a modern, decaying
urban setting filled with brilliant exotic colors, massive post-modern sets,
and terrifically dizzying camera shots.
The presentation of the media as the
narrator, of destructive weapons as a
way of easily killing the masses, of
incapableL. A. police forces not coming to the scene on time—all give this
rendering of Romeo and Juliet an
original spin. The film is directed
with a fast, in-your-face quality, a
method which furthers the devices of
the doomed story line, and in a way,
further hits home the messages of the
movie.
Second, the acting is solid. We
must admit, we enjoyed both leads,
but Danes has a better grasp of the
spoken Shakespeare English than

DiCaprio. Also, due to the loudness
of the movie and its soundtrack, it is
sometimes difficult to hear Romeo.
However, their believable on-screen
chemistry and passionate longing for
one another overshadows the
Shakespeare part (after all, when we
saw it, the audience was filled with
teeny-boppers who gasped whenever
DiCaprio appeared). That aside, the
rest of the cast is terrific. There are a
few standouts beside the superb
Danes, including Perrineau as the
angry Mercutio (what a "curse upon
your house" speech!), Margolyes as
the bubbly, dedicated, though cautiously caring Nurse, and, finally,
Diane Venora as the unhappy, suppressed Gloria Capulet.
Finally, there's Shakespeare's play
Romeo and Juliet. Beneath the interesting exterior of the movie lies the
classic itself—thematically charged
with fate, doom, love, hate, family
loyalty, deceit, dest "v. etc.. etc.. etc.
While Luhrmann's version is original and very well-executed, it is the
story of the star-crossed lovers that
endures.
Continuing the theme this weekend, Kenneth Branagh's Henry V
gives a much more traditional but
no less effective-interpretation of another Shakespeare classic. Fear not,
Branagh adds enough originality and

emotion to keep you riveted for the
whole movie. Get ready for some
seriously passionate and motivating
speeches!
Although many of the same themes
run throughout this play, it is quite a
change of pace from Romeo and
Juliet. The story does not end in
timeless tragedy (it actually has a
slightly cheesy ending, for
Shakespeare); instead, it is the story
of (you guessed it!) Henry V (Kenneth Branagh), and his struggles with
the French. The movie begins with
the narrator (Derek Jacobi) in his telltale black trench coat, introducing
the setting in the empty set of the
movie.
The young King Harry or Henry
(the names seem to be interchangeable) is faced with a decision: to
claim lands thatbelonged to his grand
forbear, Edward I, and have since
fallen into the hands of the French, or
to let ihr mistake slide. Since his
legitimacy as a strong king is implicitly on the line, the decision doesn't
seem too hard.
The entire cast is very strong, but
Branagh is by far the star of this
show. He vividly portrays Harry's
courage, intelligence, and inner conflicts, creating both an immortal king
and a human. His eloquent and fiery
speeches (brace yourself, he might
convince you to go join the army!)
are often followed by private scenes
ofexhaustion or self-questioning. Of
course, much of this noble character
is the creation of Shakespeare, but
Branagh breathes such vitality and
sincerity into the role that you can't
help but be awed by the power of his
acting. Henry's Uncle Exeter (Brian
Blessed), the French King, and the
French Dauphin also put on super
performances. The only small weak
spot is Emma Thompson as
Katherine, daughter of the French
King. Her acting is fine, as it adds
some humor to the plot, but herFrench
leaves a little to be desired.
The movie is amazing-we definitely suggest you go see it. In addition to the acting, some innovative
camera work adds much drama and
emotion to the story, and the final
battle scene is one of the best, and
saddest, we've ever watched. The
language can be hard to follow at
times, but the strength of the acting
from all sides quickly overcomes this.
Besides, after seeing two Shakespeare
flicks in a row, you'll understand it
perfectly anyway!

theirbaby birds from the nest into the
snarling jawsof academia, and they're
feeling a little vulnerable.
Third, the alums. You can easily
recognize them because they're really old and bitter.
Now that you know your opponent, it is important to study their
movements. You never want to be
caught unaware. You must be emotionally and psychologically prepared
for your attack. Fortunately, the administration has seen fit to aid you in
your quest by publishing the tour
schedule on our very own Swarthmore web pages. No more boring
undercover surveillance of the administration office for you. You can
now just turn on the computer and
find your opponents at any time.
So now let me end this article with
specific examples of appropriate tour
tormenting.
You're standing on Parrish Beach,
peacefully talking to a friend or looking at a book, and you spy a tour
group approaching. Once they are
within hearing distance, clutch your
head with your hands and yell, "She's
gonna blow, Cap'n! She's reached
maximum capacity and she's gonna
blow!" Then run away screaming.
Dress completely in camouflage,
complete with an NRA hat if you've
got one available, and hide in a bush.
When a tour passes, jump out of the
bush, point an imaginary weapon at
them and start making machine gun
noises. After a couple of seconds of
this, stop and say in your best backwoods accent, "Oh, sorry. I thought
you was a baby squirrel." Then run
away screaming.
Get a bunch of friends together and
sit in the middle room of Sharpies at
lunch. When a tour comes in, everyone at your table should start coughing and choking violently while clawing at their tongues. Then pass out.
Disguise yourself as a Hasidic Jew
(You don't really have to dress as a
Hasidic Jew, I just put that in for
shock value.It worked, though, didn't
it?) and join a tour. Stay at the back of
the tour group and say in your best
Australian accent at some inappropriate time, "I was here a few years
ago and a dingo stole my baby. Is it
still loose on campus?" Then run away
screaming.
Just remember that the key to any
good tormenting is to find your
opponent's weakness and exploit it.
Have fun out there, kiddos!

Support for Swarthmore Queer Union's
to modify roommate questionnaires

efforts

Three weeks ago, The Phoenix reported on SQU's efforts to work with
the dean's offices to modify the roommate questionnaire, which currently
does not contain any reference to sexual orientation. The new items would
give incoming first-years a chance to indicate whether they would be
comfortable with a queer roommate. Since then, the deans have voted not
to make any changes.
The deans do understand the type of harassment queer students are
vulnerable to, and they are aware that hateful comments coming from a
roommate especially taint a queer student's first experiences at and of
Swarthmore. However, they feel that the roommate questionnaire is not
the place to address the issue, although they have made it clear that this
decision is not set in stone, and may be changed in future years.
While we understand that this is a difficult decision to make, we feel that
questions concerning sexual orientation must be included in order to best
serve all first-years, queer or not. The deans point out that asking students
to self-identify as queer on the questionnaire may cause tension between
the student and the parents who are not aware of their child's sexual
orientation. Students are free to indicate their sexual orientation in the
comment space at the end of the questionnaire. However, this type of
question is not very likely to identify queer-friendly roommates for those
first-years who indicate their sexual orientation on the questionnaire. We
see great value in including a question concerning whether or not a student
feels comfortable living with a queer student.
Currently, the roommate questionnaire has space for students to identify
themselves as religious, liberal, feminist, etc. We see no reason why
queer-friendly could not be included in this list of adjectives. This enables
students not to categorize themselves but rather to describe themselves. It
does not ask students to self-identify explicitly nor is it a mandatory
question.
The deansfeel that putting the administration's hand in the matter would
only detract from student's learning experiences here. Having students of
different backgrounds living together and near each other should enhance
their learning experience. We agree that this educational opportunity is
one of the most valuable in a college experience. However, it should not
come at the expense of the queer student's happiness and well-being. Why
should a queer student be forced to educate his/her roommate and free him/
her from prejudices? How long should the queer student suffer before it
is clear that the roommate's homophobic views are not going to change?
We feel that this situation is unfair.
While students are not expected to feel comfortable in every location on
campus, their rooms certainly ought to be a safe space. People go to their
rooms to escape hostility and the negative energy that can sometimes
surround them when out on campus. Queer students should not have to
deal with awkward comments and a hateful atmosphere when in their

Liberals Should Work With, Not For, Others
By

Vincent Jones

During the '96 elections many progressive Democrats bit their tongues
in response to several pieces of legislation passed or supported by the
Clinton administration. The passage
of the infamous welfare bill epitomized the rightward focus of the
President's reelection campaign and
disregard of the core ofhis own party
but party faithfuls continued to support the President, at least in public.
Now that the Democratic party has
regained control of the White House
and diminished the Republican control of Congress, progressives must
become more vocal. The country's
growing conservatism demands that
liberals become active participants in
political dialogue. More specifically
we must learn how to frame debates
and to speak WITH, not for, people.
Much of the recent success of con-

should use their resources, privileges
and skills to assist those activists directly affected by their collective efforts. Not only does this course of
action increase the likelihood of
sustainability, it allows politically
disempowered people to assert their
rights as humans and citizens.
Since the Republican takeover of
Congress in '94, progressives have
been engaged in a critical dialogue
trying to figure out what went wrong.
However, I haven't heard much discussion on what we can change and/
or do better to be more effective.
Without any intrinsic change in our
agenda, rhetoric or action plans, liberals will continue to lack any true
control over contemporary political
debates. Hence, conservatives will

which will garner support without
diluting our message. This requires
greater utilization of liberal/progressive think tanks, more active participation in the media and a clear understanding of how the public reacts to
certain issues, words and phrases.
In addition to learning how to better frame debates, progressives must
also learn how to speak with not for
people. Most left-leaning activists
find themselvesfighting for the rights
of other people. Given this fact, efforts must be made to ensure that the
progressive agenda parallels their
agenda. To accomplish this, more
progressives should follow what I'll
call the ETS (Empty The Shelters)
model. Leftists should not assume
that they must always take a leadership role in other people's movements. Instead, such individuals

Letters to the Editor
Swarthmore Queer Union Explains Reasons for Additions to Roommate Questionnaire

To the Editor:
A committee composed of lbout
eight members of SQU has proposed
the addition of two questions to tho
roommate questionnaire. The questions are: 1) Are you comfortable
rooming with someone who is lesbian, gay, or bisexual? 2) Do you
prefer to room with someone who
answered "yes" to the above question? Among members of the administration, and among the campus at
large, the same arguments have arisen.
Again and again we come up with
two or three main objections: l)lfwe
are going to include queer identity on
the roommate questionnaire, why
shouldn't we account for other very
important identities? 2) The rooming
situation is not necessarily intended
to provide every student with "comfort." Living with anotherperson from
a different background is part of the
larger educational experience that
Swarthmore provides. 3) How can
you be sure that students will identify
as queer-friendly? Many queer students fill out their forms with their
parents and cannot self-identify.
These are valid points, but they are

servatives has been aided by their
ability to frame debates on their terms.
Conservative think tanks along with
spin-doctors effectively shape public
opinion to support or be more sympathetic to the political agenda of the
Right. Consider the debate on welfare reform. The Right created an
image of welfare mothers in the inner
city living off government largesse
instead of working. Through the use
of reports, guest appearances on talk
shows, opinion pieces and rhetoric,
the American public began to see
welfare recipients as responsible for
their own problems and not worthy of
public assistance. Such public sentiment created a perfect opportunity to
end welfare as we knew it.
If progressives had been more successful in framing the welfare debate
maybe it would still be a federal entitlement. In other words, we need to

a considerable time, yet, for whatever reasons, were not able to be out
before coming to Swarthmore. Queer
identity, unlikeother forms ofdifference, often emerges once a student
arrives at college. The room, then, as
"home," becomes integral to developing a safe foundation for this emerging sexual identity. It is a private
space that can have a great impact on
the process of coming out. If the
room is a contested territory, in which
a straight student constantly utters
homophobic slurs, thenthe queer student can possibly be prevented from
fully realizing his or her identity.
Queer students, in the great majority of situations, do not come from
queer communities, queer families,
or queer cultures. This places the
queer student, again, at a particularly
vulnerable juncture in his or herprocess of questioning and coming out.
The queer student not only lacks a
culture and a home community or
householdthat fosters or at least sustains a healthy queer identity, but he
or she may not be out at all to his or
her family. This means that if there
are problems in the room, the student
is often forced to choose from three
options: just deal and don't come out
on any level, speak with Myrt
Westphal about changing rooms, or
seek out peer support and resources
from SQU.
Those choices are not simple nor
are they adequate solutions. If aqueer
student is worried that his or her
roommate will be hostile or will grow
even more hostile if he or she comes
out, then that queer student may feel
afraid enough to avoid affiliating with
SQU at any level. Along those same
lines, that student may not be ready to
completely come out to Myrt
Westphal. This could necessarily entail coming out to the roommate in
the process of changing rooms, as
well as outing yourself to the entire
staff of deans. If you are feeling particularly vulnerable, if you've never
really been out before, this mechanism offorced outing in order to seek
resources or a better housing situation is not viable. Compounded with
that fact is the above mentioned lack
of support from parents and home
communities.The rooming situation,
then, becomes a barrier around the
queer student who faces much more
than mere "discomfort."
All of these factors working together lead us to respond to the second concern: how can the rooming
situation be in the least bit educational under these sorts of circumstances? There is far too much burden placed upon the queer student,
and it is completely possible for the
queer student to live in a closeted
state, bearing thebrunt ofhomophobia
while the ignorant roommate carries
out his or her daily life without having to face the same issues on any
level whatsoever. We would argue
that in any rooming situationbetween
a queer student and a straight student,
the queer student will still have to
deal with coming out, testing and
exploring identity, and learning from
that experience, and the straight student will also benefit from the experience. However, we are only asking
for some possibility that this "educational experience" does not turn into
a stifling, caged situation.
In response to a number of concerns about the actual details of the
question, we have some fairly simple
responses. The questions are framed
so that they do not necessarily force
any student to out him or herself to
thedeans. There are certainly straight

people who might say that they would
prefer to live with someone who is
queer-friendly. The question serves
the purpose of initiating in every student who receives the questionnaire
in August some thinking about sexual
orientation. "Hey, it's possible that I
might end up rooming with a bisexual!" Lots of folks never entertain
that possibility before arriving here.
For queer students entering Swarthmore, the question will indicate to
them that the administration does
consider queer identity to be a significant part of a student's life.
Everyone also points out that not
everyone will truthfully identify

whether or not they are queer. This is
certainly true, but there are also many
people who will find a way to answer
the question truthfully. Underestimating the ability of closeted queers to
find ways to navigate around the
closet in order to secure a safe room
is a mistake. And we also wonder:
certainly not everyone who smokes
identifies as a smoker, yet the administration feels that it is enough of a
priority for non-smokers to avoid
smoky rooms to ask that question.
Can it be a priority for queer students
not to live in hostile, destructive situations? It should be.

Myrt Westphal Responds to SQU's Request
Myrt Westphal requested that this
letter, which was sent to SQU in
response to their request, be printed
for the entire College community.
Yesterday at our weekly Dean's
meeting we revisited the request of
SQU to add items to the frosh roommate questionnaire concerning issues of self identification and comfort with living with a gay, lesbian or
bisexual roommate. The discussion
occurred during this week's and last
week's meeting in addition to being
reviewed by the Deans last year at
the request ofLGBA.
After in depth discussion, enlightened by written materials produced
by SQU and several meetings with
membersof thedean's staff, the deans
have again decided not to include
this type of question on the roommate questionnaire.

Let me give you some insight into
our thoughts as we came to this decision.
First we do understand the issues
of hurt and injury experienced by
members of the queer community
when they are placed in a living
situation which feels uncomiortable
or wor«p W? unrtpfTtirid fhat a Had
living situation for a questioning or
queer student is very painful when
there are so many adjustments to
make to college life. Where we disagree with SQU is in how to address
this problem. Our collective wisdom
tells us that the roommate questionnaire is not the place to address the
issue. Also the questionnaire has been
suspect for giving false and inaccurate information because in many
instances parents are involved in filling it out, students are not sure who
will read the information and students do not know what their feelings and habits will be when they
join this community. In particular
we do not feel that the questionnaire
will produce the kind of disclosure
that will be helpful in having students identify as queer or questioning or will produce true responses
about comfort levels in living with
queer students.
Other concerns include that if we
address the special needs of your
group we will find ourselves having
to address the special needs of many
groups: ethnic, religious, racial and
interest groups all of whom experience some painful living situations
similar to the ones you describe. We
will find ourselves creating apattern
of living that goes against the fundamental philosophy of our residence
halls—that the halls are a place where
genuine diversity exists and where
members ofmany groups must learn
to live together in harmony. If we
include questions for special groups
on the questionnaire we raise the
expectation that all will be solved by
getting a good roommate and that

there is no work involved in creating
a good living situation within the
room and on the hall. These types of
questions ask for an administrative
mechanism for solving problems that
students need to address. We believe
addressing the differences in human
patterns and beliefs is a core value in
being a residential college which requires students to live in shared space
for their first two years in the residence halls. We cannot promise a
painless environment for every student through this administrative device.
Now what can we do to assist queer
and questioning new students to make
the best possible entrance and adjustment to Swarthmore? We have several suggestions.
First I can include in my cover
letter with the questionnaire a rephrasing of the College's equal opportunity statement which includes
sexual preference. This should alert
all students that we value and protect
students in many categories. Second,
I will place self identified students in
buildings where there are queer students living.lfyour group gives mea
list of students who are willing to
serve as support persons to queer and
questioning frosh, I will place those
frosh in spaces nearby to those support students. During spec weekend
you can encourage queer and questioning students to self identify on
their roommate questionnaire so we
can make this placement. You can
also make this suggestions in any
materials you create for this population. Third, we recommend that you
develop a publication that can be
handed out to new students when
they arrive on campus, a publication
that gives information to both queer
and straight students about supports
on campus and suggestions ofhow to
live with roommates who do not have
the same sexual preference. Finally,
ifthere is information we should convey to the RAs during training to help
this process we would be glad to
include it.
I know you will be disappointed in
our decision. We valued the work
and thought you have given to this
issue. While we were not able to
accept your proposal I believe we
havehad an important and thoughtful
discussion of the issues. We are
strongly in support ofyour group and
its goals to makeSwarthmore a comfortable place for queer and questioning students. I hope our suggestions
will help to create and maintain this
commitment to this group of students.
I remain happy to talk at more
length about our conversation and
decision and about other possible
ways to address concerns of SQU and
its members.

The Garnet Takes
Battling with Snow,
Second Place to
Rain, and Gettysburg
Wellesley at
Seven Sisters

Softball

By

Jean Quinn

The snow on Monday put a hold on
the Garnet's schedule, delaying three
of this week's contests. The team
played a doubleheader against
Gettysburg last Saturday and lostboth
games, dropping to 2-12 overall, and
0-4 in conference action.
Rainand lightning delayed the start
of the games. The score of the first
game, which went the full seven in-

nings, was 9-2.
Apryl Dunning '99 knocked both
runs in on two singles. Pitcher Dana
Lehman '9B doubled in the outing
and gave up only six earned runs.

Defensively the team performed well,
not making the physical or mental
errors that have plagued the Garnet
lately.

Gettysburg had a solid lineup that
hit the ball well and executed on both
ends. Center-fielderMichelle Walsh
'9B threw someone out at the plate in
the earlv wninr« ?«H her powerful
arm kept many runners from trying to
advance and score. Executing very
well on the defensive end. the Garnet
held Gettysburg scoreless in the last
three innings and kept the game from
ending by the five-inning/eight run

"mercy" rule.
Walsh is just one of a number of
players who are trying out new positions this season. Coach Cheri
Goetcheuslikes theaddition ofWalsh,
and her well-respected arm, to the
outfield. RhianaSwartz'oo has penetrated the pitching rotation, "talcing
the burden off Lehman and Wendy
Lawrence '99, and has also filled the
void at third base" created by the
moving of Walsh.
Dunning has tried out a number of
infield positions recently, adding
shortstop, first-base, and third-base
to her credit, on top ofher invaluable
duties as catcher. "She has been really valuable in her diversity and flexibility. She's a pretty solid, consistent player wherever I've had to put
her," said Goetcheus. With a small

roster, everyone has been trying out
new spots and all seem to be adjusting well to whatever comes their way.

The second game of the doubleheader ended after six innings, 14-6.
Offensively, the Garnet performed
much better. Dunning got on base on
each of her three at-bats, drove a run
in, and scoredtwice. Walshalso went
3 for 3, and tripled when the bases
were loaded to give the team an offensive rush. Lurah Hess '99 scored
twice. The Garnet were ahead in the
game, but were routed by their perennial problem of not playing with con-

sistency..
Goetcheus explained, "Our seasonal woe is that we can't put together more than three innings of
solid softball. We'll play tight defense and get some great defensive
plays and then the bottom falls out in
an inning when we get 2 quick outs
and then the other team scores 4 runs

sta*"* out bittir»™ like <rano hu«t(;rs and
then we'll ease up a bit and let other
teams back into the game and then
before we realize it, we're trying to
catch up!"
Walsh expressed similar feelings,
"It is very frustrating because the
team has much more ability and potential than it has in recent years, and
we still are not putting it together to
win."
The team is looking more confident and aggressive at the plate, but
consistency remains an issue. Mary
Beth Alvarez '9B says, "While we
have some consistent hitters, we need
to have production out of every part
of the lineup."
Another weakness that the team
needs to work on is getting the
"pitcher/catcher combos to present
more of a challenge to hitters."
Monday's game against Beaver
College has been tentatively planned
for Sunday April 20, 4 p.m.
The doubleheader against conference rival Western Maryland will be
played today at 2:30 p.m.

The Women's lacrosse team returned Sunday after a successful
Seven Sisters Tournament at
Wellesley College this weekend. The
team once again came in second place
after Wellesley. But they were very
happy with the way they played at the
tournament this year.
"A lot of us were sick and a little
run down," said Sarah Singleton '99.
"It showed in our playing and we got
off to a slower start then usual."
Despite their slow start, the Garnet
had a 10-9 victory ever Yassar College on Saturda v morninc Vacsar
played much better than last year's
tournament.

The game was tough for the Garnet, but they still managed to sneak
by with a close win. This victory
allowed the team to play Mount
Holyoke College on Saturday afternoon.
Swarthmore defense played ex-

tremely well and heldMount Holyoke
to only six goals. Even a heavy downpour that drenched the players and
made the field a treacherous pit of
mud didn't deter the Garnet.
The game was called with 8 minutes left to play. However, the team's
experience with playing in poor
weather and field conditions proved
to be an advantage and the Garnet
walked away with a smashing 16-6
victory.
Unfortunately, Swarthmore did not
have as much luck on Sunday in their
game against Wellesley. Although
the game was close, the Garnet still
did not play their best game.

Track Team Leaps From the Starting
Block to a Successful Outdoor Season
By Sarah

McClure

On Saturday, the men's and

women's outdoor track team travelled to Haverford College to compete in a five-way challenge against
Bryn Mawr, Delaware Valley,
Ursinus and Haverford. As only the
second meet of the season, this competition was not scored which gave
the Swat track team a chance to see
whatkind of competition they would
be up against and to try new events
without the pressure of racking up
points for the team.
CatherineLaine' 98 stole first place
in the triple jumpcovering a distance
of 34' 10.75" followed by Desiree
Peterkin 'oointhirdplaceat33'9.7s."
In the shot put, Heather Mateyak '97
reached 29'11.5" capturing third
place and Amy Cuthrell '97 finished
eighth at 24*5.75." Mateyak and

Cuthrell also competed in the discus,
throwing 94' 1.25" and 86' 11.25" respectively. Stephanie Herring '99
cleared 5' in the high jump winning

the event.
The women's team continued to
succeed in the running events with
Danielle Wall '9B taking third place
in the 1500 at 5:06 followed by
Karen Lloyd 'OO at 5:35.2 and Sarah
Howard '9B right behind at 5:37.1. In
the 400m, Swat led the race with
Danielle Duffy '9B finishing first at

On the Road Again
By Wendy Kemp

Routine for the women's tennis
team now consists of traveling upand

down the East Coast without batting
an eyelash. On Thursday March 27,
the team traveled to Western Maryland College, and then to Washington College the next day. However,
the lineup continues to suffer with
the loss of the top singles player
Michelle Martinez '97, wounded in
action during practice and unable to
return to the courts for three weeks.
In addition, the absence ofregular
#2 player Neena Shenai '9B led to a
big jump for the other starters on
Thursday, as they all played two slots
highe* than usual. Yet even with this
handicap, the team gave Western
Maryland a hard fight before suc-

prolonged their matches with fast
serves, high lobs and low returns,
leading to an 8-4 score for each of the
three matches: Rani Shankar '9B and
Nga Lai '97 at first doubles,
Rosenbaum and Kemp at second, and
Brown and Sara Coe 'OO at third.
On Friday March28, the team rode
out to Washington College for yet
another match. However, although
Shenai was back and raring to go,
regular starter Lai was not able to
make the match, which forced many
of the players two slots higher once
more.

Although the team played better
and won more games overall, the
final score was 1-8, Washington.
Brown, at fifth singles, posted the

Swat Women Ruggers Would Put
American Gladiators To Shame
By

Jen Philpott

Amber

&

Halsey

This Wednesday, the Swarthmore
women ruggers played two games
against West Chester University, a
nationally ranked team. Once again,
the opposing team was no match for
Swarthmore's undefeated A-side
squad, whose record now stands at 30. Swarthmore outscored their opposition 15-10. The B-side squad, while
playing a very intense game, lost by a
score of 0-10.
Thefirst try ofthe game was quickly
scored yet again by scrum-half Jen
Philpott '97 who dove into the try
zone after yanking the ball from the
vicious ruck. The remainder of the
first half was scoreless, but West
Chester evened the game with a try at
the beginning of the second half.
Swarthmore quickly retaliated with
five more points scored by the combined efforts of Giovanna Giuliani
and Atexa Miller 'OO. Giuliani
s§3rtm tfeS ball into the try zone where-

0'97

upon Millerhelped her touch it down.
This try was followed up by yet another score by Swarthmore. Sarah
Cross '99, the club president, scored
her first try ever in an A-side game.
Cross made a heads-up play by touching a loose ball down in the try zone,
leaving West Chesterbaffled. A West
Chester back managed to score once
more before the close of the game.
Beth Vose '99 had a good game,
deftly retrieving fumbled balls and
gaining yardage on every play. Christina Cost as '99, who played wing,
carried the ball well and barreled
through the opposition, despite her
many recent injuries. Swarthmore's
fly half, Courtney Clark '9B kicked
often and well as did West Chester.
As a result, Meghan Brennan 'OO
fielded andreturned numerous kicks.
However, Swarthmore's impressive forward pack dominated the majority of the game. The pack has had
a powerful scrum all season, but in
this game, their lineouts had the fans
cheering. Philpott's throws were con-

sistently accurate. The referee, Paul
MacGregor announced to the fans,
"Her throws are so straight, she should
replace Swarthmore's Quarterback,"
after declaring his admiration for
Philpott's new hairdo. Becky Snyder
'9B and Cross lifted the jumper to
unparalleled heights, and Amber
Halsey '9B made several outstanding
catches. Halsey also had many opportunities to run the ball in open
field play and proved that she is more
than just a good hooker.
Second Rows, Lara Estroff '97 and
Pia Houseal '97, played two tough
games, both A and B side against the
relentless opponent. Snyder and Kira
Cochran-Bond 'OO also played both
games.Although B-side was
outscored, they were certainly not
outplayed. Lynn Matthews' 97 played
at fullback, a new position for her,
and skillfully fielded and ran back
the ball consistently. Danielle
D'Oliviara, who played at wing,
caught the ball well and used her
speed to break through the opposi-

tion frequently.
In the forward pack, Corinne Bright
'9B, one of the flankers, continued to
demonstrate that she was meant for
contact sports with her fierce posts
and rucks. The other flanker Jessica
Roney 'OO, played well despite a
bloody lip. Becca Hover '99, while
still a novice at lineout throws, threw
them directly to B-side jumper and
hooker Katie Jozwicki '97.
Despite the inordinate amount of
tape needed to hold Jozwicki together,
she showed a remarkable amount of
hustle on the field. Kim Hart '9B
provided much needed support in
lineouts by ripping the ball from the
jumper and passing cleanly to scrum
half, Brennan.
After the games, Hanan Hussein
'97 told her teammates, "I was
pumped for this game and we won, so
if we can get as pumped for Saturday
again, I have no doubt that we will
deflate Temple." Swarthmore will
face Temple University at home at
11:00 am on Saturday.

Swimmers Attend Nationals
By

Jill Belding

Recently, four female and two male swimmers competed at the
NCAA Division 111 Swimming Nationals in Oxford, Ohio, home of
Miami University. For the women, junior Kristen Robertson, sophomores Cathy Polinsky and Jill Belding and freshman Claire Arbour
teamed up to achieveAll-American Honorable Mention status in two
relays. Their 800 freestyle relay finished 12th, while the 400
freestyle relay finished 16th. Robertson brought home bothrelays in
lifetime best times proving how fast fear can push you. The women
also excelled in theirindividual events. Belding placed Bth in the 200
butterfly earning All-American honors. In the 200 freestyle, Arbour
received All-American Honorable Mention with her 10th place
finish. The four women finished 29th as team.
For the men, junior Andy Robbins and freshman Brandon Walsh
competed at an exceptionally fast meet relative to previous years.
Each turned in strong swims in the 50 freestyle as well as in the 100
backstroke and 100 butterfly respectively. In the 200 backstroke
Robbins finished 17th, while in the 200 butterfly Walsh finished
18th.The men and women look forward to upcoming years with even
more swimmers competing at Nationals.

Canadians Take Over Swarthmore
By

Chian Ang

women, children, and cute, fluffy bunnies, but Canadians
are just too polite for that. Instead, the invading Canadian

Last Tuesday marked the beginning of a new era in
Swarthmore College history. On that day, the College
entered into a historic partnership with the Government
ofCanada, orLa Gouvernement du Canada, as it's known
up north, effectively adding Swarthmore to the Canadian
system of higher education and ensuring its financial
stability well into the 21st century.
On campus, the agreement was jokingly referred to as
the "Canadian Invasion of '97." The word "invasion"
usually conjures up horrific images of jackbooted soldiers with automatic weaponry mowing down men,

contingent showed up with free beer, fight-free hockey
games, and socialized medicine for everyone. The most
threatening action accompanying the Canadian takeover
appeared to be a fierce winter storm the Canadianrepresentatives arranged to give Swarthmore a taste of the true
Canadian environment.
Bob Bytmycrankski, spokesperson for the Council of
Ministers ofEducation, Canada (CMEC), said thatpeaceful expansion has been the Canadian way throughout its
history: "You know, it's just like when we were just a few
lonely fur trappers going westward, and instead of deal-

Canadian Invasion
Tuesday was a Canadian field day.

Bottom, the invaders were quick to
bring President Bal Loom over to to
their side. He was convinced by a
Canadian descending from the
heavens.

ing with the natives by decimating their villages, and
sending them to live in rat-infested, alcoholic reservations as some might have done, we greeted the savages
with tolerance and understanding, and now we co-exist
peacefully with the Red Man. Well, except for the occasional scalping, eh?"
The official reaction from the administration focused
less on tradition and more on the financial future of the
college. Neel Tocanadians, Chairman of the Board of
Managers and Head Ballboy for the National Football
League, said only, "they mayhave some shitty football up
there in the CFL, but those Canadians sure have a lot of
money,eh?" Swarthmore'salreadyimmenseendowment
will now be backed up by all the economic powerhouse
that is Canada, making tuition free to Canadians and far
less costly for all other students.
President Alfred E. Bleaume's only official response to
the invasion was some garbled French that no one could
understand. Many who attended his press conference
thought he might as well have been speaking Chinese.
Around campus, reaction was mixed. An ad hoc student group, 5.P.1.K.E., for "Swatties Promoting the Invasion by Kanadians, Eh?," was formed to support the new
Canadian presence on campus, but its members could not
be reached for comment since they were largely drunk
and insensible after a night spent celebrating the replacement ofSAC-bought Milwaukee's Best with governmentally-subsidized Moosehead and Laßatt's.
Other students were less enthused. In an unusual alliance, the two D.U.'s, Diversity Umbrella and Delta

Upsilon, released a combined statement protesting the
agreement, which expressed concern about Canadian
cultural and racial hegemony as well as fear of "them
foreign, French-speakin' retards." Shaniqua VasquezCheng of Diversity Umbrella commented caustically,
"Do you think it's just coincidence that they call themselves 'The Great White North?' Why not "The Great
Brown North?'," and a D.U. brother known only as Pud
said, "This is America, man. Love it or go home."
Swarthmore Conscious Consumers had a similar response, urging students to boycott Canadian products,
particularly tampons, which SCC supreme leader J. Oscar Mayer said have been known to cause a curious
craving for Canadian bacon known as Toxic Pork Syndrome. SEO director John Dott reportedly sent an email
to all his friends calling Canadians "big-footed tools," but
had no comment when asked about it.
Like it or not, however, students, faculty, and staffalike
are learning to accept Swarthmore's new Canadian management. The Equal Opportunity Advisory Board has
begun drafting a new Canadian-American consensual
relationship policy, which will strongly discourage international relationships, but not expressly forbid them.
The Canadian deal may not drastically affect most
aspects of daily operation at the College, but it will
undoubtedly result in a new awareness of cross-border
issues. As prospective student Yukon MacKenzie from
Regina, Saskatchewan noted, "Hey, you know, the Bible
says 'Love thy neighbor,' and when it comes down to it,
we're all just hosers, eh?"

Board Approves Climate Dome
By

Hatt Moward

In a meeting that went on until almost sunrise, the
Board of Managers approved the construction of a climate controlled dome over Swarthmore. "Wehave grown
tired of the complaints of wimpy West Coast students
who say it's always too cold and that the weather is
unpredictable," said Eil Naustrian, former Board chair.
"This dome will hopefully put an end to that problem."
When asked about the details of construction, Buildings and Grounds head Scharry Lall was ecstatic. "I've
wanted to be a part of a project like this my entire life,"
Lall said. The dome will encompass all of the campus
buildings with the exception of Mary Lyons. Planners
had hoped to include the dorm, but then decided that if
you were foolish enough to live in ML, it is your tough
luck. The structure will be made of plexiglass, and will be

approximately 3/4 of a mile high at its peek over Magill
Walk. The temperature inside the dome will be maintained at about 75 degrees, and scheduledrainfall will be
engineered. A large vacuum cleaner, to be installed under
Parrish, will suck pollutants out of the air through one
main vent, and spew them into the outside air. To combat
cloudy days, a giant video screen, much like the n"e in
time square, will be mounted on a track that will move
across the axis of the dome, serving as an artificial sun.
This screen will alternately display video footage of the
sun, and President Bal Loom's head shot.
President Loom, who had reservations about the project,
is now behind it 100%. "With the help of our Canadian
partners, I am confident that this project can be completed
without putting the school in financial jeopardy," Loom
said. "Besides, $2OO million is a small price to pay for
good weather.

Secret Subway Plan Revealed
By

Hatt Moward

In a meeting with students in Parlors yesterday, Scharry Lall confirmed rumors thatthe College was in
the midst of a multimillion dollar
subway construction project, and that

main station of the subway will be the
newly renovated ground floor ofTrotter Hall. "We have done our best to
get in touch with student needs," Lall
said. "There is no reason S warthmore
students should not have a subway to
take them around campus."

Artist's rendition of the new campus subway station,

When asked whether the millions
of dollars spent on this project would
be a real benefit for students, and
whether the project would put undue
strain on the College's budget, Lall
was quick to respond. "The subway
is already paid for. If you take away
the repair bills we have to pay when
someone wrecks the shuttle every
week, and the phenomenal cost of
insurance on the shuttle, since the
insurance company knows we only
hire incompetent drivers, the entire
cost ofconstruction and maintenance
of the subway for the next two decades is taken care of." Lall also said
that students "need no longer fear for
their lives" when trying to get around
campus. Though Trotter construction
is scheduled to be completed this fall,
the subway will not begin service
until the spring. "Wert Mystphal
wanted to prevent students from seeing the subway as a legitimate housing option," Lall said. Mystphal had
no comment. She is apparently busy
securing tents for next year's freshmen class's overflow housing.

Madison

The two Mary Lyon shuttles
collided in a fiery explosion
Thursday, killing six students
and forcing the residents of
ML, PPR, and Woolman to
walk through the perilous
streets of Swarthmore after
dark until the College decides
how to make the route safer.
The accident happened
when the Ford Aerostar, nicknamed "Shuttle Two" by Ben
West and those involved in
the shuttle program, swerved to avoid
one of two Public Safety Jeepsspeeding eastbound on Chester Road, and
collided head on with the larger
shuttle, affectionately named "Shuttle
One." Apparently, Public Safety was
racing to DuPont in response to an
urgent call from a student who had
accidentally locked her book bag inside. "I really needed my Chemistry
notes for the test on Monday," said
Jackie Benson '9B, "But it was 12:30
at night and all my friends with keys
to the building weren't around."
The two shuttles collided with full
force, sending two board members of
WSRN and a leader of SWIL to the
ho«pit*i with massive intestinal
trouble, and tragically killing all studentsaboard Shuttle Two. JasonMacy
'99, driver ofShuttle One, explained
why he did have time to react to the
fast approaching Aerostar. "I saw
some guy with his hands in his pockets walking toward PPR," he said.

"Fulfilling my Garnet Patrol duty, I
was straining to see if he was doing,
or about to do anything which would
constitute 'suspicious behavior.'
Then I realized that he was justkeeping his hands warm. I was phoning
him in to Ben West when the accident
happened." While Macy reached for
the CB, Shuttle Two lurched into its
lane. The man on the sidewalk was
never apprehended.
"I expected this to happen eventually," said shuttle coordinator
Rolanda Yosi '9B. "I was just hoping
that it wouldn't happen while I was in
charge. Oh well."
Student reaction to the accident
was mixed. "Now they have no excuses not to build us that subway,"
said Aaron Swanson 'OO.
"If Nerri Tarkin had sent an allcampus crime prevention tip about
this, I am sure it could have been
avoided," said Sue Martin' 97. "Well,
live and learn."

Witnesses to the accident
declined comment, excepting
one. "When I saw those bodies
strewn out in the street, I had
only one thing in mind: how
much money did they have in
their pockets?" said James
Johnson 'OO. "But, typical
S watties, they didn't even have
wallets. I did manage to snag
the ID card of one of the dead
guys, though, and you know
what that means—Tarble
credit forever!!"
Administratorshave already
formed a committee to study safer
routes to ML and PPR. "So far, we
have a route which completely bypasses that intersection," said President Bal Loom, who amazingly is a
member on the Committee for More
Safe Routes for Shuttle Drivers to
Take to MaryLyon (CMSRSDTML).
"We haven't got it entirely set, but so
far it involves taking 1-95 into Delaware, and fording the Crum Creek
near Crum Meadow.
What was most mysterious about the
accident is that both shutdes were on
the street at the same time. "The shutde
schedules clearly state that while one
shuttle is making its run, the other
shuttle should be parked at Parrish,
waiting ten minutes to make its run,"
said Yosi. "I am going to get to the
bottom of this. What good are two
shuttles if one isn't standing idle at all
times?" When asked to elaborate, Yosi
shrugged. "We need to spend our budgeted money somehow," she suggested.

College Decrees New Rule:
Specs Can't Feed Students
By

said Peter Piscov, a spec from West Potluck, Miss. "The

Mave Dimno

In a move sure to disappoint many at Swarthmore
College, the admissions office has announced a new
ruling forbidding tour groups to feed the students. The
move was precipitated by a recent incident in which Gim
Kallup '9B was sickened by a piece of rancid beef jerky
tossed to her by a passing group of prospective students.
Upon hearing of the decision, President Bal Loom commented, "Here at Swarthmore, we try to maintain the
illusion for students that they are living in the real world.
When they are fed by the prospectives, however, they
often become docile and lose the ability to survive when
they are ultimately reintroduced into the wild. We are
always happy to give prospective students an opportunity
to view our students, but, for the students' safety, we
cannot allow them to interact."
His sentiments were echoed by many in the administration who have been concerned about the health of the
College's world famous collection of students. "We pride
ourselves on the wide variety of students here," said Wert
Mystphal, Director of Residential Life. "Many of them
can be found nowhere else in the world. They therefore
often require very specific environmental and dietary
conditions."
The prospective students have, for the most part, taken
the new regulations in stride. "It's not that big a deal,"

most important thing is that we get to see the students in

-

their natural habitats."
Not everyone, however, is pleased with the new ruling.
Several students have complained about the loss of a
valuable dietary suppliment. "Those bits of stale bread
can really go a long way towards making Sharpies bearable," said Boss Rowling 'OO. Many prospective students
have also continued to feed Swatties, in open resistance
to the new rule. "He was soooo cute!" exclaimed one
prospective, who preferred to remain anonymous, ofCatt
Moddington '99. "Did you see him? He was eating right
out of my hand!"
Several administrators pointed out that the recent food
poisoning was not the first incident in recent years involving prospective students. In the fall of '94, two specs were
attacked and badly mauled by a roving pack of SWIL
members. The prospectives later admitted, however, that
they had been teasing the students by poking them with
sticks.
"What prospective students must realize," said Uusan
Suntereker, dean of admissions, "is that these students,
although they seem quiet and harmless, are actually very
sensitive and tempermental. They must be treated the
respect due to any group of exotic creatures."
By the way, according to The Daily Gazette, there will
be a SAC-funded party in Paces celebrating this decision.

We would like some more work
So the other night one of us went to sleep at 1 a.m. And every once in a while,
when we’re up here in the Publications Office early in the evening drinking
Coke and hanging out like usual, doing nothing in particular, we wander on
down to Parrish Fourth to use the bathroom or get a drink of water or try and
steal food unobtrusively from their study breaks and we realize that there are
people going to sleep before midnight.
We’d like to say that this is wrong. Very wrong. There is something very
disturbing about thn fart that college students (Swarthmore students, no less)
can be going to sleep at such reasonable hours. What kind of standard is this
setting if students at the number one liberal arts school in the country can be
well-rested and fresh in the morning for class? What does it sayabout the roots
of our College community that bottles of caffeinated water sit untouched for
days in the lonely, cold refrigerators in Essie Mae’s?
There are certain things that a school like ours must uphold. We don’t have
an honor code, like some other schools, but nevertheless there are important
traditionsand behavioral patterns that all students here should feel personally
responsible for upholding and fully committed to.
We need to be dedicated to our studies. We cannot be getting this much
steep. If we are, there is a symbol that something deeply needs to change in
this school.
The clearest solution is that professors need to give more work. Obviously
it is becoming difficult for students to find things to do, especially after
McCabe closes and students can no longer waste timereading the messages
written on the study carrels. E-mail can only take up so much of our time, as
can communicating with our roommates or honing social skills through phone

conversations.

If the students themselves cannot find ways of spending their time, then it
is up to the College to mandate that all professors in every department begin
assigning more work. We realize that this may have repercussions on other
facets of campus life, but we feel that this is the only way to adequately
address the problem.
We’d like to recommend that professors begin by requiring students to
check out more books from McCabe. Oh, and Cornell. See, if youlook around
the libraries right now, you’ll notice that they seem to be entirely too full of
books. And we think that a great solution to this is asking students to do a
much-needed cleaning of the libraryby clearing out some of the dusty stacks?
Obviously there’s plenty of room in studentdorm rooms for stacks and stacks
ofbooks. If you live in Danawell, try filling the empty room in one of those
spacious dresser drawers in the closet with books.
Another ideal solution seems to be asking students to write more. We don’t
really see the point of requiring students to write five and ten page papers.
Really, what kind of sense of a person’s writing style can you get in five or
ten pages? More importantly, if students are reading more, they’ll clearly
have more to say. So we suggest a minimum page length of twenty pages for
all Swarthmore papers.
We also feel that we do not spend enough time in class. Sure, the three hour
afternoon blocks are wonderful. But we all know that discussion really
doesn’t get going until four. We would like more professors to follow the
example of political science seminars that last for six hours. Just imagine how
much more we would get out ofclass if we could develop our discussions for
this long a period of time.
We also do not understand the point of having snake breaks. Often, getting
up to stretch and steal a Nutter Butter disrupts the momentum and excitement
that has been gathered in class. Plus, if we eliminated our lingering trips to the
Coop, we would have more time to work.

This semester, notorious Swarthmore junior Sam Shuffy-Wools decided that he was tired of only being
able to wield power once a week.
This decision sparked the conception
of the Daily Gazette, a daily e-mail

publication.
Clearly Swarthmore does not need
adaily publication. After all, we aren't
that exciting a school. What the hell
does The Daily Gazette have to write
about? How many times do we need
to read about SAC's weekend party
plans? Or, my favorite, summariesof
the lecture that I didn't care enough
about to go in the first place? They
have even stooped to the level of
reporting on responses to Phoenix
articles.
Often, they move outside the school
to provide us with world news briefs.
What does that have to do with
Swarthmore? More proof that there
is no worthy news around here.
A sometimes-staffmembershamefully admits, "Sometimes [the editors] hold ir" t"-'"'-' mv will and
force-feed me M&M's in an attempt
to get story ideas out of me." That's
how desperate they are.
An editor of The Phoenix confessed, "Sam requested that I sell my

soul to him. His salesman smile nearly
convinced me, but I resisted the corrupt bargain he offered."
The Daily Gazette is just a plot
hatched by a "group of certain Swarthmore students" to control ourminds.
Let's face it: everything you read in
thatrag is justanother brain cell taken
over by Shuffy-Wools. This is the
same guy who plays country music
over WSRN. Need we say more?
Staff members of the Daily Gazette haveresorted to brutal arm twisting to recruit cohorts from all areas of
campus to join theirminions.Swatties
Unite, you have nothing to lose but
your chains. Resist the hegemonic
discourse imposed by the Daily Gazette, and realize that you only believe them because, living in this glass
bubble known as this campus, you
don't know any better. More importantly, Shuffy-Wools and his cohorts
make you believe that you actually
need to waste valuable time in the
mornings reading about things that
you really never needed to know in
the first place.
Thp Dnih Gazette doesn't even
have pictures. Of what worth is a
paper where the number of words
exceed thenumber ofpictures? It's as
ifthey want us to spend even more of
our time reading.

I Will Live

in Wharton Or You Will Die, and My Handgun is Ready

To the Editor:
I want to live in Wharton next year.
I don't care what my number is, I
don't care what Wert Mystphal says,
I will live in Wharton next year. Anyone who picks Wharton ahead of me
will be shot; I'm telling you this now
so you know better than to pick
Wharton come room choosing time.
See, I can't live anywhere else. I
can't live off campus because people
off campus might have cats. I don't
like cats. When they look at me I feel
like they're hypnotizing me with their
eyes. One time a cat instructed me to
move to San Diego and devote my
life to following the Chargers.Luckily my mom found me just as I had
bought my airplane ticket and took
me to the world-renowned hypnotist,
Dr. Freelove, who cured me; now I
just feel uneasy whenever I watch
ESPN. I can't live in ML because I
don't like having my own bathroom,
and I can't live in Woolman because
Wert doesn't believe I'm female yet.
I can't live in PPR because it's full
of people wearing black. I was once
assaulted by a bunch of people wearing black. They poured Cheez Whiz
on my head while chanting the lyrics
to Bryan Adams songs. Granted, this
was in Philly, and all sorts of things
happen in Philly, but wheneverI take

the shuttle to PPR I see lots of people
wearing black and waving tiny wands
with red tips. That's another thing: I
don't like taking the shuttle. A tiny
voice comes out of the magic black
box and the shuttle driver talks back
to it in secret code. I think they're in
communication with the Blue Bus
and, when Armaggedon comes, only
a select group of shuttle drivers will
be able to speed away and seek seclusion in New Jersey.
I can' t live in Mertzbecause I might
get eaten by the burlap. I can't live in
Willets because I might get eaten by
a first-year. I can't live in Danawell
because I might get eaten by the trailer.
I can't live in Parrish because I
don't like being in such close proximity to my mail. You have to be very
careful about when you get your mail.
All mail that comes through the College is coated with a special paint that
infects you with the desire to pierce
your body in weird places.
Last year was the worst: every
time I turned around, someone else
had fallen victim to their mail. This
year it's much better. Of course, being a reasonable person, you might
ask, "Why would the people who
stuff mailboxes want people to pierce
themselves?" I understand it's a bit
of a leap. The truth is that the metal

stud cabal bought out the mail staff a
long, long time ago. For every new
object you implant in your tongue or
eyebrow or God knows what, the
mail workers get a commission. Right
now I'm very careful and only check
my mail once a month, when most of
the paint has dried out, but I'm afraid
ifI lived in Parrish I'd slip and check
it too often.
So it has to be Wharton. Also it has
to be a single. My roommate is a very
nice person, and I,don't have anything against her, but the deadrabbits
hanging from the ceiling have started
to annoy me, and she never cleans up
after her friends come over. One time
I slept through my alarm, hurried out
of bed to get to my 9:55, and slipped
on a human liver she'd left lying
around. In short, I don't want to deal
with a roommate anymore.
I know my number might be pretty
low. I don't care. I'm going to buy a
handgun tomorrow and I will shoot
anyone who chooses Wharton ahead
of me. I justhave to make sure to get
my ice cream cone from SCF beforehand since they probably won't want
to give it to me afterwards. Which is
fine. Everyone's entitled to an opinion. But nobody's entitled to Wharton
except me.

Violence is the Answer to the Invasion
To the Editor:
Canada? I'm sorry, but Canada?
The recent successful invasion by
those wimpy beer-drinkin' bumpkins
from up North has revealed the sorry
state of Swarthmore' s defenses. Why,
I don't think we could even stop
Haverford ifthey chose to try a more
direct way to get the Hood Trophy. I
recommend that we reevaluate our
defensive posture, and consider the
following steps:
1. Mandatory firearms training for
gym credit, replacing namby-pamby
so-called sports such as "badminton," "aerobics," and "soccer."
2. Land mines guarding primary
entrances to the College. Buy now
whilethey're still cheap; international
arms ban may drive up the prices.
3. Daihatsus armed with rockets
and miniguns

4. Campus nuclear accelerator retooled to produce nuclear fuel.
While the above steps may seem
painful to some people, we're better
off without those people anyway.
The fruits of such a program would
be amazing, perhaps allowing us to
solve the eternal space problem by
annexing Bryn Mawr as a fiefdom.
If we ever lost in US News again,
we could avenge our defeat with big
explosions. Williams won't look so
hot when it doesn't have a dining
hall.
In sum, I would suggest that the
only way to properly ensure the safety
of this campus is to hire someone
experienced enough, tough enough,
and patriotic enough to defend us
from those wily Canucks. I hear Bob
Dornan is out of a job...

so all this stuff about welfare reform is really messed up because i
thought that people deserved to be
helped out once in a while but i guess
other people dont think that especially since the people who make the
laws sit around on their fat asses all
day long and have power lunches
don't you think they could give some
of the power and some of the lunch to
all of us other folks i guess not

On

Friday night in Trotter 206, the
Drama Board is bringing to you
one of the most heart-stirring new
musicals of the decade: Parrish West Side
Story. This classic tale tells the story of
Toby and Mariah, lovers from opposite
sides of Parrish, bound together despite
the clashes of the Bloomists of 3rd West
and the Women on Top of 4th East. The
story opens with a Beirut game in the
remaining Parrish Classroom that turns
ugly, but soon moves on to a moving duet
between our lovers: "Hey, You're That
Person Who Posted on the Newsgroup
About Smoking in Tarble." Soon after,
Mariah's next-door neighbors Annika and
Hester join her in the rousing, "We're
Seniors, Dammit, Why Can't We Get
Beach-Side Singles?" Meanwhile, Toby's
best friend Alfredo tries to convince him
to give Mariah up with the heartfelt "You
Can Always Get Some at Bryn Mawr."
Soon allfalls quiet, and the lovers sneak
down to Parlors to declare their passion
for each other. "I'd Spend the Night With
You, But I Have an 8:30" is a shoo-in for
next year's Oscar for Best Song. But they
must flee when a security guard comes
upon them; he calls in his friends and they
begin the "Security Guard Waltz," a surreal yet sweet display thatrivals anything
ever done by Fellini. Soon after, however,
the movie's tone darkens: when Annika
goes down to Parrish 2nd West for a meeting of the Committee to Raise Tuition by
Oodles and Oodles, she is viciously attacked by the men living there. Outraged,

she reponds with a strong "You' re Infringing on My Personal Space."
Soon the rumors are flying and the tension could be cut with a knife. However,
the Women on Top are arrmed with something worse: plaid. The confrontation finally comes at Tarble, where the two
groups square off over the last remaining
tuna salad box lunch. Toby and Mariah
sing a desperate reprise of their earlier
love song
"I'd Spend the Night With
You, But I Have Grad School Applications to Finish"
before all hell breaks
loose (but in a very provocative, wellchoreographed way) ending in Bal Loom,
Lythina Ngcott, and Gedd Toundie joining in the movie's final song, "Now We
Can Take Over All Their Rooms For Administrative Offices." Test audiences left

The

way in which campus tours are
conducted is to change as of this com
ing Monday, according to the Admissions Office. In a memo released yesterday,
the office cites "lectures not quite representative of Swarthmore" and "tour guides who
tend to fabricate the 'student experience'," as
well as a barrage of complaints made to the
office by observant students.
It goes on to describe reportedly unacceptable behavior, such as "luring tactics commonly found at schools like Haverford, where
they have trouble attracting students" and
"severely downplaying the suffocating stress
level."
Among other things, the memo specifically states that guides are no longer permitted to claim Kohlberg as a "newly-refurbished, state-of-the-art engineering building"
and Hicks as "condemned." They must also
stop describing the Courtney Smith House as
a "cozy, rustic student center," while saying
Sharpies 111 is "humble ol' Al's house." In
addition, guides are hereby forbidden from
insisting that "Parrish dorm rooms are airconditioned like the offices below them."
"I'm so glad they're not making us spew
out all that [expletive] anymore," said one
relieved tour guide. "I mean, I felt so bad
lying to people... you know, like, 'You can
take advantage of Philadelphia on the weekend,' and 'The flowers are beautiful in the
spring.' Who believes that crap, anyway?
And when do you have time to look at the
[expletive] flowers?"
"I felt so rotten inside, I was almost driven
to Psych Services," commented another guide.
"You see the optjmkfic 1ooV«j nn the people's
faces, but they... sniff... just don'tknow what
they're getting into, and it's all because of

you."
The response to the memo was not all
positive, though.
Said one guide, formerly a student at
Harvard, "Oh, bother... it was soooo much
easier having the Admissions Office carry
the burdenof keeping out theriff-raff. Why is
it up to us now? And do you think I'll have to
tell them I'm not allowed to have my Benz on
campus? Oh, I'd be the laughing stock."
In addition to the internal memo, an allcampus e-mail was sent to students, advising
them of the new procedures and asking for
their help. It offers suggestions, such as yelling the catch phrases: "Go to Yale, it's easier!"
and "Ask him about Willets and ML!" when
tours pass by.
It also recommends inviting unsuspecting

This movie is marked by many strong
performances, the best being Pike Man as

sides and San Dachar as a hothead armed

Goseph
Joodman '97. "We had more people coming

Student Council's upcoming CD." An emergency election was held in February; the
Porsche won a tight race over the Sharpies
hot chocolate machine and former Happy
Days star Henry Winkler. Siridhar Grinivasan
'9B, current Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream
Committee chair, attributed the Porsche's
victory to public campaigning: "Thatappearance at the Willets Scavenger Hunt really
boosted his image. And let's face it: the Fonz
just ain't what he used to be."
Professor Froscatelli himself was somewhat amused to learn of his car's ambitions.
"It was planning on auditing a class somet i me
next semester, but I had no idea it planned to
get this involved," he said at the time. "I'm all
for it, though. I think it has some really good
ideas beneath its hood."
However, controversies erupted from almost the first meeting, when the car and Bean
Sarney '9B, Member-Very-Large, clashed
over a previous Jincent Vones column in the
Feenicks. Vones argued that StudentCouncil
was trying to eliminate funding for the popular Take-Your-Puck-to-Lunch program. In a
moving column, Vones declared the love and
compassion he felt for his duck. "Student
Council has no idea how much help it can be
to a student, feeling cut off from all support,
to be able to have a quiet lunch with an
understanding duck like Tipper," he wrote.
"But some people would rather you eat your
duck than eat with it."

throughout the day, "Shoot... they know the

In

light of the recent cult suicide in Rancho
Santa Fe\ I find it necessary to reconsider
Swarthmore's presence on the World
Wide Web. I've listened to all the news
reports, and it's clear that the members of
Heaven's Gate committed suicide because
they spent too much time on the Web. Just
check out all the headlines about "Internet
Cult" this and "Cult online" that. Anyway,
we here at Swarthmore have been priding
ourselves on our nettiness. It's time to recognize the danger inherent in the Internet! Ban
Netscape!
I also note that Hustin Jail is offering
another one ofhis "Sinner" seminars on Web
design. Combine sin and the WWW, and
death is soon to follow!!! Bpwsm-p.M!
Consider the advantages to the administration if students engage in a mass suicide. Not
only will it garneryet more press attention for
Swarthmore (remember: all press is good!),
but it will also open more room for next
year's class, and conveniently remove all
students who remembered niceties like an
uncrowded Sharpies line or a Danawell
lounge. Yes, getting rid of those griping malcontents and replacing them with naive, doeeyed frosh is definitely in the interests of the
Powers That Be.

On

Sunday, Student Council will hold
a special meeting to decide what to do
about the recent upheavals caused by
the newest memberand Council Council chair,
physics professor Mank Froscatelli' s car. This
special Feenicks in-depth report traces the
controversy from the beginning.
Professor Froscatelli's
Porsche was elected to fill
the vacant Council Council chair left open when So
its previous occupant,
Beck, left for the
to
Grammy s and never came
Council
back. The
Council chair's responsibility
is to keep track of the
number of councils and
someone
to work to increase the

laced binoculars! I don't trust that astronomy
department one bit. That Wolff Heintz fellow, he acts the brilliant professor, but in
reality, a cult-happy comet fiend, just waiting
for national exposure! I mean, did you catch
him on Totally Tabloid? I sense the antichrist
at work. Those astronomy profs are waiting
for us to be wiped out so they can remove all
campus buildings, thus allowing their telescopes free play.
This campus can be cleansed! All it takes is
to deny the reality of Netscape and the evil
Web, and embrace Microsoft! Yes, Chairman Gates is waiting with arms spread wide
open to take us all in his glorious geeky hug
of market dominance. Explorer will conveniently stop you from being influenced by the
Evil Web by crashing any time the Web is
going to exert evil upon you. Yes, the divine
"circuit breaker" will kick in, leaving you to
reboot and reflect upon the error of your
ways. Praise Bill!
I also think that the campus' unhealthy
focus on a capella may reflect a vulnerability
to cult influence. A capella groups are notorious for their discipline, closed-mindedness,
and, most important, *identical clothing*!
Fix Teen Seat is well known for wearing
identical bluejeans and footgear, just like
Heaven' s Gate.And this weekend, even members ofSeat from fifteen years ago will be in
attendance. No mere singing group could
inspire such patriotism! Seat is evil, evil I tell
you, and all who attend their unholy rituals
run the risk ofbarbiturate-addled CD buying!
Flee while you still can!
And stay away from those astronomy profs.
There are only a few of them, but they're
wily.

College community as a whole."

Froscatelli'scar,
by contrast, ran
on a pro-duck
platform, so it
was inevitable

that it would
come into conflict with Sarney.
"There
are

still...some tensions because of
that," admitted
Grinivasan. As
of this writing, SC has yet to decide on the
duck issue.
But the car's troubles were only beginning.
On March 1, it got into a public feud with SC
member and Mary Kay Cosmetics Sales. Kosh
Jramer 'OO. The car played "You're So Vain"
on its horn beneath Jramer's Parrish window,
after which Jramer hurled water balloons at
it. The car refused comment; Jramer would
only say, "I hate Carly Simon!" The car issued a public apology, but sources within
Student Council have reported that it continues to make fun of Jramer, occasionally shining its brights on Jramer's bald spot during
meetings

Meanwhile, the car has apparently run afoul

air-conditioned, heated, closed parking garage on campus; an annual Monster Truck
derby on the football field; the establishment

their most likely major; changing the College
motto to “We Put All Those S’s in Stress”;
and adding the ability to successfully Ipaid.a.

and sponsoring a tag-team wrestling match
every spring between the staffs of Spike,

Mamer’s bad side when it followed his car
for weeks, demanding tenure for Professor
Froscatelli. Mamer’s only response was a
press release saying, “Damn fool car—he
already has tenure.”
And there are hints the worst is yet to come.
According to unnamed sources, the Porsche

Samey is rumored to be concernedabout how

Should SC members decide the relationship
inappropriate, the next question would be
whether to dismiss the car or to ignore it until

Once upon a time in 1889, Swarthmore cheerleaders were men. They lived
by strict codes of conduct befitting cheerleaders: they always wore their long
underwear outside. (See Above Pix) In the 1950'5, feeling left out of the

action, Swarthmore women challenged the all-male cheerleading squad.
Since Swarthmore officials voted against women cheerleaders even after
holding a "Forum on the Merits of Female Cheerleaders," a group of women
punched out the whole male squad until only one man, the young Calvin dc
la Renta. remained I >ee Pix in Upper Right) The women let him stay «iw«
he designed the grooviest polyester skirts for the team. After young Calvin
left, the women honored his memory by wearing those skirts. (See Pix in
Lower Left) Eventually, the skirts ripped and shrunk after years of wear. The
Athletics Department lacked the funds to buy new skirts to replace the old
ones. This is how the Swarthmore cheerleaders came into being.

"It's not as easy as it looks," said
Jup Line '99 as she wiped the sweat
beads pulsating off of her brows.
Putting one foot in front of the other
gives most people enough trouble
already, but imagine having to do
that and hop at the same time. These
are the skills which Line has perfected over the years while growing
up in the City of New York.
Facilities were not accessible in
her neighborhood. Playgrounds were
the only places where Line could
safely practice her art without having
to worry about being run over by cars
and trucks. As Line became more
obsessed with the sport, she began
practicing in her apartment, because
playgrounds converted to narcotics
exchange markets after sunset. Soon,
her neighbors complained. Line recalled her neighbors shouting "Take
it somewhere else!" and "We're not
that type of people...all those thumping noises!"
"It's quite remarkable how people
can mistaken the thumping noises of
jumping rope for something else."
Line laughed. "I was just a little kid
jumping rope!" Finding places to
pursue her interest was not the only
obstacle that Line faced.
Line broke through her trial and
tribulations when she met JumpRope
Master Sensei Phil. "I was very impressed by the way she handled the
rope when she jumped. Pure, raw
talent! I realized I had to grab her as
soon as possible." Indeed, Line's rope
handling skills were often admired
by her opponents.

"Jup has an incredible sense of
where she is at all times. She just
seems to always know where her body
is." Broque N. String, Line's archrival from Haverford College, said.
"I'm surprised that she doesn't trip
more often."
Sensei Phil explained, "You have
to be one with the rope. The movement ofyour body and the movement
of the rope should be syncopated like
your heartbeat." Line trained under
these principles in addition to Rope
Master Sensei Phil's strict diet plan.
Sensei Phil earned
Rope
his title in 1987 after defeating the
reigning champion Vyacheslav
Tripnekov in the Federation of Outstanding LoopSters (or F.0.0.L.5.).
Sensei Phil and Tripnekov were long
timerivals just as String and Line are.
Sensei Phil now insists that Line
follows that same regime as he did
when he prepared to compete against
Tripnekov which involved strapping
an anchor around the ankles while
jumping rope in order to build up leg
strength. When asked why use an
anchor instead of weights, Sensei Phil
answered, "When I was young, we
didn't have these things called
weights. We had to make do with
what we had." He continued. "My
father was a sailor and we happened
to have an anchor lying around, so I
used that to train. I won. So, Jup
should do the sam<"
The training program has taken a
toll on Line's body as she often fell
off the chair during our interview.
"My coordination isn't what it used
to be." Line commented. "But I'll do
anything to win."
"

A Rare Moment Captured on Film
Jup Line ’99 performing the never recorded, virtually impossible
move of jumping rope one-footed with three ropes and an anchor
strapped to her ankles. It is all a part of the Rope Master Sensei
Phil’s strict training regiment. Some experts have criticized his
program as too strict and unhealthy for his athletes.
The competition whichLine spoke

ofis the same as the one where Sensei
Phil became Rope Master Sensei Phil.
Many people in the roping worldhave
speculated the outcome ofthis year's
event. Line is the favorite to rope in
th. title in the marathon event.
A International Press Daily evaluated, "Line has practically no competition in the endurance area as she
had been jogging for fifteen minutes
daily. However, the problem area lies
in her speed. The sprint category
would not be recommended for Line
;

to cast her sight. If Line

does not

overextend herself, she shouldrise to
the top."
Even if Line does not capture the
championship title, Line has come a
long way to the F.0.0.L.5. competition from those playgrounds in New
York City. When asked wh~* T <ne
plans to do after the tournament, she
answered, "I don't have a definite
plan yet. All options are open. I could
always try double-dutch or drawing."
This attitude has helped Line to stretch
where she is and will stay.

Rachel is famed among her fellow cross-country runners back in
highschool for her respiration skills. Running several miles in practice
often led to increased desire for cigarettes. Therefore, the team started a
ritual of smoking after every a quarter of a mile.
In this past weekend's meet, Rachel accomplished a feat which exceeded hers and anyone else's expectations. She ran a one-mile course
under three hours and stopped only thirteen times for cigarettes. "The
weather was beautiful," said Rachel. "I think that affected my performance
tremendously."
Rachel is currently training for the Intramural Wacky Tracky Day with
her boyfriend Brantley. So far, they have accumulated enough points for
the Marlboro billiards table.
