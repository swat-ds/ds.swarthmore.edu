Gholston, who is president of
the Swarthmore College Democrats, began contacting speakers
last summer for whathe initially
planned as an African American
Democratic leadership forum,
but he decided to broaden the
umbrella because "it doesn't do
political issues justice to think of
the black community as a political monolith."
With the help of Professor
Reeves, Gholston invited nonDemocrats Fulani, Keyes, and
J.C.Watts, although he found it
harder to balance the panel than
he had originally hoped.
The panelists' areas of interest
and expertise vary significantly.
Rep. Clyburn, whose recent tenure as the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus has
been characterized as more reserved than his predecessor's,
will speak on the role of black

leadership in Congress. Rep

Fattah, who started GearUp, a

program that links inner-city
high school students with state
colleges and universities, will
address education policy. Fulani,
who has endorsed Patrick
Buchanan for president, will talk
about her Reform Party candidacy and the role of political independents. Harrison is the
policy expert on the panel, and
will discuss the racial implications of the 2000 Census.
According to Gholston, it was
difficult to convince such prominent speakers to share the limelight with each other, but his efforts to bring them together have
paid off.
The forum is co-sponsored by
the College Democrats and the
Black Cultural Center, with the
Swarthmore African American
Students Society (SASS) and the
College Republicans providing
additional funding.

According to College Democrat Jordan Brackett 'Ol, "To

bring these panelists together for
one evening moderatedby one of
the best professors on campus is
truly one of the semester's most
important events." He added that
despite costing much less money,
it could rival any Cooper event.
Through the forum, Gholston
hopes to inspire campus-wide
reflection and discussion on
black political issues. The panelists have taken political views
familiar to Swarthmore students
and dedicated their lives to working for change within the American political system.
"Too often Black History
Month is characterized by reflectionrather thanprojection," says
Gholston. "It is important to commemorate the workof past builders, history makers and barrier
breakers, but it is also important
to realize that their work has

"Things are currently going
well. We hope to have this project
completed by the time students
return from spring break," said
Larry Schall, Vice President for
Facilities and Services.
Kohlberg is donating the cost
ofboth the building as well as the
tennis facilities that it will contain, and Swarthmore will be financing the additional expenses,
including the equipment that will
be in the fitness center.
Twice the size of the combined
size of the two current weight
rooms, the new fitness facility
will house $160,000 worth of
aerobic and resistance equipment from Medex. The hours of
the new facility will be from 7:30
a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Mondays
through Thursdays, 8:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m. on Friday and 10:00
a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday and
Sunday. All students will be required to present their
Swarthmore ID card to use the
new facility.
"Naming projects and buildings after people he knows personally and respects typifies Mr.
Kohlberg's generous style. I'm
very flattered and honored, but
also very humbled by it all," said
Mullan, who has known Kohlberg
since he joined the faculty in the
fall of 78.
The project began in mid-1997
with a conversation about a tennis and fitness center between
Kohlberg and administrative
members of the college. As a

tennis fan, Kolhberg was excited
and highly motivated to develop
a facility where Swarthmore
students could develop their
skills and share his love of the
sport.
Although the idea of the
Mullan Tennis Center was conceived over two years ago, the
project has been slow to come
to fruition because the college
encountered difficulty laying
the groundwork for the project,
both conceptually and physically.
Designing the new building
took longer than the college expected because there was extended discussion on how to create an acceptable design that fell
within the target budget of approximately $2.5 million.
The college also encountered
two primary difficulties once the
contractor began the construction work in early June 1999:
first, while the college knew that
the construction would take
place on a former college dump
site, they had underestimated the
amount of debris, such as tree
stumps and old concrete building

foundations, that they would encounter.

Second, while the college facilities office was aware that
there was an underground water source somewhere in the vicinity of the construction area,
they could not pinpoint its exact

location. As a result, the construction team unexpectedly hit
the water source, in the form of
an underground spring, and the
construction of the building was
delayed further. Both the issues
of the debris and the water have
since been resolved.

Ad hoc committee formed to
evaluate Swarthmore athletics
By Justin Kane
Phoenix Staff

NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN | Phoenix Staff

Provost Jennie Keith chairs the committtee which will address concerns
about the athletic program.

In response to concerns about
the athletic program, the college
is forming an ad hoc review committee to evaluate therole ofathletics in the college.
Chaired by Provost Jennie
Keith, the committee, which includes members of the Board of
Managers, faculty, administration and students, will pursue
answers to questions such as
how the college should support
athletics and how the athletic
program can better integrate
itself with the rest of the college,
as well as a variety of other issues.
The committee, which met for
the first time Wednesday after
press time, has yet to set an
agenda or a timetablefor the inquiry. Keith said she expects the
review to take approximately an
entire year and to cover a broad
range of issues facing varsity
athletics at the college.
The committee is the result of
the volume and intensity of concerns expressed from all areas
of the college.

"The impetus has come from
several different sources," said
Keith. "We have heard from the
athletic department, student-athletes, faculty and other students."
According to Keith, the issues
raised range from student-athletes feeling like outcasts to the
number of admissions slots allocated to athletes. Keith also said
the faculty has voiced worries
that "any effort to strengthen the
athletic program will undermine
the academic program."
These concerns were brought
to the Board of Managers at the
latest meeting, held Dec. 3-4. The
athletic program was one of the
issues discussed in the closed
session of the meeting, and Keith
said the board has tapped it as a
matter of importance.
"I thinkthe fact that thereview
committee already has board
members on it shows that this is
a serious inquiry with long-range
implications for the college," said
Keith.
Keith was also careful to stress
that thereview committee's findings will have more far-reaching
implications than those of the

Valentine's Day weekend overscheduled
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff

i

Dar Williams. The 30th Annual EnglishScottish Ball. The Valentine's Day Formal.
"The Vagina Monologues." The weekend
beginning Friday, Feb. 11 will not be your
typical (read: boring) Swat weekend. Yet
this dense scheduling has its downside as
iwell. Although most of the campus is abuzz
with excitement, the coordinators of these
events are struggling with frustration and
disappointment. The scheduling overlaps
will force students to make difficult
choices when planning their weekends,
reducing attendance at all events.
Three of the four events of the weekend of Feb. 11 could not have been rescheduled even if their coordinators had
Iknownof the problem well in advance. The
date of the Dar Williams concert is the
result of struggles withher booking agent
to negotiate any possible time. Amber
Adamson 'Ol, one of the co-writers of the
Dar Williams proposal, explained that
even now the concert is not definite.
"We're 95 per cent sure," she said.
Both the Valentine's Day formal, thrown
for the third consecutive year by the International Club, and the Folk Dance
Club's English-Scottish Ball are constrained by the same particular date. By
convention, each dance must take place

Trang Pham

as close as possible to Valentine's Day.
"We always have the ball on the weekend nearest Valentine's Day," said Otavia
Propper 'OO, one of the members of the
Folk Dance Club coordinating the event
this year. "It's tradition. It's the 30th Annual. You can't mess with tradition."
Unfortunately, this folk traditionresults
in the most critical overlap of the weekend. Both the Dar Williams concert and
the English-Scottish Ball are scheduled to
begin Friday evening around 8:00 p.m. In
addition to the pull of her fame, the folk
music of singer Dar Williams might attract some of the students who have gone
to the ball in previous years. Propper did
not seem too worried about this possibility, however, explaining that many of the
attendees are alumni or members of the
folk dance community for whom this annual event has the draw of a long tradition.She did, however, express disappointment at the scheduling conflict. "It really
is a shame that you can't do both," she said.
The other major scheduling overlap of
the weekend occurs on Saturday evening,
the time slot of both the Valentine's Day
formal and the first performance of "The
Vagina Monologues." Anna Woodiwiss 'O2,
the directorof the production, had initially
planned a Friday night performance, but
then had to reschedule due to Dar Williams. Without hesitation, Woodiwiss

Student Council plans to leave the position unfilled for the rest of this year and

Pressure mounts to change
withdrawal deadline
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
The pressure on the Curriculum
Committee to move back the course
withdrawal date mounted this week as
Student Council launched an e-mail
campaign to solicit student involvement. Students and their advocates in
the Dean's Office are pushing the Committee to move the date back a week
so that students may consider their
midterm grades before deciding
whether or not to withdraw from a
course.
Student Council Co-Chair Brandon
Silverman 'O2 sent out an all-campus
e-mail Monday asking students to respond with opinions about the proposal, whichwould also move back the
date for students to change from pass/
fail grading back to regular grading.
Since then, Silverman said, "We've
gotten about 65 e-mails, and the responses strongly favor pushing the
deadlineback."
Student concern about the course
withdrawal date is a relatively recent
phenomenon, but the issue itselfis not.
It was first raised in 1993 by an administrative committee on pressures
on student life that included the Dean
of Students, and it has come before the
Curriculum Committee two or three
times since then.
The committee last considered moving back the withdrawal date early last
fall. According to Mike Spiegel 'O3, the
student representative, the committee
approved the proposal, but "anything
that goes through the Curriculum
Committee has to go through the faculty, so the proposal was shot down."
Spiegel said that faculty members
tend to favor the status quo in this issue. "My impression is that they see
that [a change in the course withdrawal date] as a move toward more
emphasis on grades and less on a class
itself."

5

According to Craig Williamson, chair
of the Curriculum Committee, at the
request of the Dean's Office, the committee will reconsider the issue sometime this spring. Members of the
Dean's Office declined to comment on
the issue, but Spiegel said, "The deans
have traditionally been on the side of
students. They would like to see that
pressure taken back."
Spiegel is in favor of changing the
withdrawal date, but he does not know
when students can expect the committee to make a final decision on the matter. "They tend to move slowly, and it's
not a matter of laziness...The committee works mainly by consensus, and
that's a stopgap."
He does plan to raise the withdrawal
date issue at the committee's meeting
on Friday but not for the purpose of
encouraging action on it. "I'm going to
apologize for this issue being sprung
on them. It seems to have come up out
of nowhere, and the e-mails have been
flying."
For committee member and Registrar Martin Warner, however, the tide
of student response is positive. "I'm
glad that students are looking into this
matter. My hope is that students will
give thoughtful reflection to this problem and report through Student Council to Mike [Spiegler]."
As indicated by the volume of e-mail
responses, students are doing just that.
Alejandro Perez 'O2, commented, "I
really want it to be pushed back because this is the first time I have considered taking a class pass/fail. I want
to look at my midterms before I make
up my mind."
Student Council is gauging that when
the withdrawal date deadline finally
comes up for discussion, the voices of
students like Perez will make a difference. Spiegler encouraged students
who wish to comment on the issue to

WRC, DU, Phi Psi join forces in
attempt to get Ethernet access

SC amendment aims to
simplify election language
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
With the hope of reducing the number of no-confidence votes in
its elections, Student Council Tuesday night amended its constitution to eliminate "abstain" from the ballot.
The amendment deletes the consitutitional language requiring that
"abstain" appear on the ballot, giving the council discretion over
whether or not to include that word on the ballot.
In the elections at the end of the fall semester, the council included
"abstain" on the ballot as constitutionally required, but it added an
explanation of "none of the above" in parentheses. The ballot also
contained a "no preference" option.
Co-chair Jordan Brackett 'Ol, who submitted the amendment, said
many students found that language confusing and the ballot would
be clearer without the word 'abstain.'"
"Abstain is replaced by two options, either 'no preference' or 'none
of the above'," Brackett said yesterday.
He said the ballot had never clearly defined 'abstain' very well
and voters were confused about whether it was a protest vote or a
vote of neutrality. The new language, which can be modified at the
council's discretion without a constitutional amendment, will distinguish the two.
Brackett said eliminating "abstain" will make elections a fairer
system. In the past, some candidates had chosen not to run for fear
of losing a one-candidate race because of abstentions.
"Hopefully, it'll increase the people running and make races more
competitive," Brackett said.
The council began investigating the possibility of eliminating "abstain" from the ballot after College Judiciary Committee candidate
Pat Hagan 'O2 received 282 votes in a race with 390 abstentions.
Hagan has since been elected to the committee.
At a meeting after Hagan's defeat last semester, the council theorized thatbecause the ballot directed students to vote for two candidates, many students who voted for Hagan also marked "abstain."
Voters who chose "abstain" effectively nullifiedany other vote they
cast for one of the candidates, since the constitution required that a
winning candidate receive more votes than abstentions in the race.
The council's constitution requires a two-thirds majority of its
members to enact an amendment. It also requires that proposed
amendments be introduced one week before they are voted on.
Brackett introduced his amendment last week.
The council is also considering many other amendments. One, sponsored by co-chair Brandon Silverman, aims to eliminate frivolous
referenda by increasing the requirements for initiating a referendum.
Other amendments include a laundry list of changes suggested by
last semester's co-chair Jared Solomon 'Ol, who is abroad this semester. The council has not yet taken action on these other amend,

of $20,000, and while both SC and Associate
Dean Tedd Goundie support the initiative,
Larry Schall, who, as vice president for facilities, is ultimately in charge of all construction
on campus, feels that the cost is prohibitively
high.
The fraternites and the WRC already have
computers and, with the construction planned
for Sharpies 111 this summer, more are expected to be installed in the area. But without
a connection to both the Internet and the oncampus network, these computers lack the capability to be truly useful tools. As Gardner, a
member of the WRC board, explained, "Without Ethernet, the space is completely
underutilized."
Elaborating, she enumerated the ways in
which network access would improve the WRC,
including the transfer of its library's outdated
card catalog to an online catalog accessible
through Tripod. This could transform the WRC
library from a rarely visitedcollection to a campus-wide resource.
Phi Psi member Silk, who is spearheading the
project, expressed similar concerns about the
underuse of Phi Psi's one computer due to the
lack of Ethernet access. He emphasized the
role Ethernet would play in maintaining communication between the on-campus members
of the fraternity and Phi Psi alumni.

Without a connection to both the
Internet and the on-campus network,
these computers lack the capability to
be truly useful tools.
Addressing Schall's objections to the project,
Silk conceded that "$5OOO is a lot of money, but
Sharpies is hooked up, and they only have two
computers." Part of the foundation of Silk's argument is that the college provides Ethernet
connections to every other group and building
on campus. He wants to see this service extended to the fraternities, the WRC and
Sharpies 111. While fully in agreement with Silk,
Gardner did complicate his analysis by admitting that "three out of the four of us [the exception being Sharpies lII] aren't campus organizations." The groups do not receive college funding.
With the construction pending for Sharpies
111, however, there is a possibility that building will be wired along with the student space,
and it is much more cost-effective to do all
four at once. As Silk explained, "The college
admits that it has to happen eventually, but
the question is when." Both he and Gardner
are hoping for this summer.
All three organizations are going out of their
way to increase the initiative's likelihood of success. The proposal does not request any money
for computers, which Silk sees as the groups'
own responsibility to provide.
In addition, while the WRC does not have the
resources to make an offer in kind, the fraternities have offered to donate both money and
labor. They believe in the importance of this
project because, as Silk said, "Ethernet is really big in a lot of students' lives."

Krisp Kremes coming;
yogurt flavors not

By David King
Phoenix Staff

Sharpies patrons who have missed the highly acclaimed Krispy
Kreme doughnut need not worry.
It should be back.
It's just not clear when.
Janet Kassab, Director of Purchasing for Dining Services, explained thatlabor problems withthe local distributor have prevented
shipments of doughnuts to the college. She has tried contacting the
distributor, located in nearby Folcroft, to push him to resume deliveries to the college, but as of yesterday afternoon she had not heard
back from him.
Dining Services essentially has two other options to bring Krispy
iKremes to campus, explained Kassab and Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall. They can either buy the doughnuts at retail
prices from Acme or become a Krispy Kreme franchise at a cost
of $750,000.
The latter is not an option, said McDougall. She would buy the
doughnuts from Acme, she said, but there would be no way to get
them to campus, because Acme could not deliver them.
Meanwhile, students awaiting the other 40 flavors of soft-serve
frozen yogurt promised at the beginning of the year will be disappointed. They're not coming.
The college entered into an agreement with four other colleges at
the start of last semester to buy the extra yogurt flavors in bulk. The
other schools, however, decided to stop buying the flavors, and Swarthmore followed suit.
The problem in offering a variety of yogurt flavors, explained
McDougall, is that after a flavor is used up the yogurt machine needs
to be cleaned and sanitized in a time-consuming process.
Moreover, leftover flavored yogurt was being thrown out, which
McDougall saw as wasteful. Sharpies will continue to serve Miss
Karen's vanilla and chocolate yogurt.

Cygnet shopping in cyberspace
The technical framework for a
cyber-Cygnet is currently in
place, with the pictures for the
Class of 2003 already scanned.
Albert Bui 'O2, a system administrator for the Swarthmore College ComputingSociety, which is
engineering the online project,

The online Cygnet is not fully
approved for use yet, however.
So far, the Dean's Office has only
approved the online Cygnet to
display the person's name, class
year, and e-mail address. The
deans are still wary of the new
service, afraid that students may
abuse it. If the initial project
runs smoothly, the deans are expected to approve the inclusion

for weeks by the Housing Committee. At last Monday night's
meeting, however, the discussion

will report to Facilities about the

Installation of coinless machines would not actually result
in free laundry for students. In
order to finance the new system,
either tuition or room and board
expenses would have to be increased. The amount of the increase was one of the points of
the proposal under heavy debate.
The initial proposal recommended a cost of SSO per semester. Most committee members
felt that this figure is more than
students typically spend on laundry and that a fee of S2O to S3O is
more reasonable.
Other points of concern include the possibility of off-campus students taking advantage of
the new system and the potential
waste of environmental resources if students begin doing
laundry more frequently than
necessary.

Haverford joins international labor rights organization
Decision makes Haverford only the third college in the
country to join the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC)
By Heather Grigo and Tim Harvey
The Bi-Co News
Before students returned from Winter

Break, Haverford President Tom Tritton

signed his name on behalf of Haverford
College to join theWorker Rights Consortium (WRC).
Tritton signed on Dec. 23, making
Haverford just the third educational inbehind Brown
stitution in the country
and Loyola ofNew Orleans —to be a member, and the first offive Philadelphia-area
schools where students have been active
in labor rights.
The WRC defines itself as "a non-profit
organization that supports and verifies licensee compliance with production codes
of conduct." Colleges and universities nationwide have created these codes to ensure that workers' basic rights are respected during the production process.
The WRC is backed by a growing number of international labor rights organizations. This network gives workers the
opportunity to report complaints securely
and confidentially with no risk of job termination. By exposing workers' experiences to public view and having investigations of alleged workplace abuses, this
provides a very powerful incentive to licensees to make systemic changes in how
they source their products.
Not all organizations uphold the reputation of the young WRC, nor is it the only
organization out there for schools to support. In fact, Haverford nearly linked it-

HAVERFORD
self with a different one last summer. This
group, the Fair Labor Association (FLA),
enforced a June 15 deadline for schools
to join, influencing some colleges to jump
on the bandwagon.
Having been involved in worker rights'
at Haverford for some time, senior Ben
Stokes remembered his feeling of panic
when Haverford's administration was
about to join the FLA.
"They sent out an email to some of the
students who had initiated the anti-sweatshop debate on campus. And we screamed
'No! Wait!' Perhaps because of the smallschool, dialogue-oriented place that
Haverford is, the administration listened
and agreed to wait to hear the student concerns," said Stokes.
The reason for the student group's
strong opposition was the FLA's unreasonable methods of investigation. In an October meeting betweenmembers of the student group and the Committee on Investment and Social Responsibility (CISR),
Stokes, freshmen Adam Berg and senior
Maria Roeper outlined these techniques.
The largest faults cited were instances
ofFLA notification to companies in question as to when inspections would take
place and where they would occur. This
allowed sweatshops to cover up poor facilities or policies for a period of hours,
defeating the purpose of the inspection.
Said Roeper of the association's meth-

ods, "The FLA will monitor factories, but

in an inadequate way: only 10 percent of
the factories are monitored, but 100 percent of all the labels read 'sweatshop
free.'"
Furthermore, managers could then
threaten to fire employees if they failed
to give a positive impression of the company.
The result of this explanation was the
creationof a sub-committee, the Committee on Sweat-Free Workplaces, comprised
of Berg, Roeper, sophomore Kristine
Farrenkoff, administrator Alan Crosman,
professorLinda Gerstein, Haverford College Bookstore employee Mary DiLullo,
and CISR member Russel R. Reno. This
group worked toward finding a better option the WRC.
Roeper was particularly instrumental in
the organizational process, according to
Stokes, as she joined forces with the
United Students Against Sweatshops
(USAS) this fall. Now she is taking a semester off from Haverford to open the
New York office, for which she is the National WRC Coordinator, and focus solely
on helping the WRC get off its feet.
Roeper commented on the duty of students to play a part in this effort.
"There are workers struggling for their
own rights, working 80 hours a week,
sometimes single mothers with children,
given forced pregnancy tests and forced
contraception," said Roeper. "Nobody
pays attention whenthese people organize
and get fired or when organizers have
death threats made against them. It's our
job as students to pay attention to that, and
to force the companies to pay attention;
where they wouldn't pay attention to the

workers, they have been paying attention

to us."

Student representatives from local colleges went to the Philadelphia councilmen
to draft a resolution and find supporters
for the upstart WRC. Success shortly followed as the city hosted a press conference where students, councilmen and supporting organizations like the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) were all on hand.
The next day the City Council unanimously approved the resolution and
Haverford students presented the results
to President Tritton in mid-December, just
days after the announcement. Tritton, adamantly in favor of joining the WRC, told
students that he wanted to speak with senior staff members before committing.
He promised a decision before second
semester began.
At the moment Haverford signed onto
the WRC, only two other colleges across
the nation had done the same. Whenasked
why Haverford decided to take the initiative to join the consortium, particularly
so soon after its conception, Tritton re-;
sponded, "We're not followers, we're leaders."
The decision received the support of
much of the college.
"A small group of students worked on
this very hard for a long time. The whole
student body had a plenary resolution ex-,
pressing their support," said Tritton.
The Board of Managers also becamej
involved, creating a resolution supporting
the principles outlined by the plenary
resolution as well as the Committee on
Sweat-Free Workplace, whose members
were appointed by the Board.

Stand up for justice

,-

Despite weeks of investigation into the recent rash
of license plate thefts, Public Safety has practically no
new leads and is unwilling to name any suspects.
Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie is also officially dumbfounded by the license plate thefts and could not go on
the record to discuss his part in the investigation.
1 Such official responses are expected from campus
higher ups, who must act judiciously to protect the
integrity of the investigation and to avoid spreading
unsure rumors.
But it is undoubtedly true that someone on campus
knows who stole those 43 license plates. In a community of less than 1400 students, secrets are about as
secure as license plates are on cars, and the truth is
surely floating around.
Unfortunately, Swarthmore students often confuse
rumors with the truth. Perhaps it is because they hear
too much of the former and not enough of the latter.
Rumors are an outgrowth of the small spaces that
Swatties inhabit. Late-night ramblings in Willets,
roundtable parleys in Sharpies, pre-class chats in
these are the college's unofficial places of
Kohlberg
student interaction and verbal exchange.
These spaces engender an spirit of secrecy and
anonymity partly because students are unwilling to
offend and partly because those they will offend are
Jikely friends or friends of friends.
It is this attitude that prompted the return of about
20 of the stolen plates, which were found lying outside
an academic building after an anonymous phone call to
Public Safety. Even with the returned plates, there are
still unanswered questions. Does the same person or
group who gave back the new license plates also have
last semester's still-missing plates? And was it a
harmless group prank or a moneymaking scheme?
And even with the returned plates, the guilty party
remains anonymous. With no reported stolen plates in
the past few days, it may be too late to catch a thief.
Will it be sufficient to let the guilty escape punishment if the issue fades with time? It may have to be.
But at the risk of offending students, we think that it
ehouldn't be. It is, when you get right down to it,
absurd to put the risk of offending fellow Swatties (or
even friends) above justice. Someone out there knows
the truth from the rumors; to them, we say: you know
what you need to do.

Staff wage problems
The college's policy toward staff salaries is fundamentally flawed.
Firstly, the policy is ill-defined.The staff pay structure
havebeen described as "arbitrary," with newly hired
employees sometimes earning more than veteran staff.
There is no formal evaluation procedure and hence little
Incentive to perform well, despite overwhelming approval from staff for just such a measure. Staff members
at Swarthmore College are generally dismayed and in the
dark when it comes to salaries, and this attitude of
befuddlement often grows to a general sentiment.
For a college that generally responds to student and
faculty opinion, the staff salaries policy is also conspicuously anti-Swarthmore. Why is it that a committee
formed by members of the Swarthmore staff with issues
affecting their well-being was unable to influence policy?
Part of the reason is that the lines of communication
between the staff and college officials are strained. But
even so, the college cannot have ignored the data that
have flowed in. Faculty are paid 102.5 percent of the
average among top liberal arts colleges and 125 percent
*of the average among all colleges; staff members are
paid 100 percent, but only in the last few years has the
college ensured compensation at the fair market price.
The college is clearly sending a mixed message. As
ironic as it sounds, the college should form a committee
to suggest tangible improvements to ensure fair
treatment of all in its community. Speaking as members
of that community, we feel it is the least we can do.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Make time for collective efforts
To the Editor:
No students went to the MLK Day of Service. No students go to Collection. While we can blame administrators for scheduling these events so poorly, there is no
question that these fiascoes also suggest a deeper unwillingness among students to invest themselves in the
Swarthmore community. In other colleges, students
gauge their progress through the school by their increasing presence in student politics and campus organizations. Here, the longer students stay, the more disengaged they get, retreating into the library, their
rooms, or off-campus apartments.
It's true that students disengage in part to engage more
thoroughly in their classes, and the sense of seriousness
and camaraderie about work here is hard to find elsewhere. But the fact remains that at no time during the
school year is everyone in the same place at the same
time. At no time are we made to step away from our
individual struggle, that we can better define our collective endeavor. Nor are we ever made to ask what unites
our role here with the roles played by those who clean

our collective endeavor.
our dorms, make our food, and teach our classes. Not to
ask these questions is an act of cowardice.
So I have two small suggestions. The first is that one
dorm or off-campus house be turned into a co-op, so
that students can cook their own food and pay their own
bills without opting out entirely of the college community. The second is that one Collection every semester
be made mandatory. One of the costs of belonging to a
community is the time to listen to one another's concerns, and to celebrate one another's accomplishments.
For most of us, that bill is long past due.
Jacob Hartog 'OO

Re-examine collection time slot
To the Editor:
I want to respond to Mimi Hanaoka's column "Harried by sloppy scheduling" (Opinions, Jan. 27, pg. 10)
with a bit of history. The College Planning Committee
appointed a task force severalyears ago (1993-94) to look
at pressures in student life. One thing that students felt
keenly then was the lack of an unscheduled time during
which, among other possibilities, Collection might be
scheduled. (There was also a strongly expressed wish at
the time to reintroduce regular Collections.)

HEATHER DOYLE | For The Phoenix

By Tim Stewart-Winter
For The Phoenix
It started with the morning shuttle.
Well, actually, it started with the snowstorm, which surprised the campus early
last Tuesday morning with about a foot of
white stuff. I woke up around 8:15 and
looked out, bleary-eyed, on the patch of
grass outside my third-floor window, with
Strath Haven in the distance. I had a moment of wanting to turn on the radio, that
magic oracle that used to tell us in the
early morning hours whether the people
running our schools had the good sense to
close them for the day.
Swarthmore College, however, can't just
be closed that way. They could cancel
classes, though they didn't; but there are
still 1400-odd 18- to 22-year-olds living
here, and the college has to continue dealing with our need for shelter, heat, food,
and safe passage across campus. I thought
about my 9:55 statistics class. I called a
friend in the class, who pointed out that
Prof. Iversen is Norwegian; it seemed unlikely he'd cancel class.
If we were (probably) having class, then
the question became, is the shuttle running? The shuttle, after all, is a fact of life
for those of us who live in ML
and a
service that seems never to be running
precisely when we need it most. There are
very understandable reasons for this;
shuttles driven by busy students, no matter how responsible, simply cannot operate with the regularity of other services
provided by "essential" staff.
Which brings me to my point. Last Tuesday was a weird mix of f un-in-the-snow, and
the strange universe of a day with classes
but without "nonessentialservices." In the
middle of this chaos, I feel like I got some
new insights into the college and how it
works, through the sudden division of campus life, and particularly the employees
who make that life possible, into the "essential" and the "nonessential."
My day went something like this. The
shuttle was nonessential, according to the
(essential) public safety operator, so I had
to walk to campus for my (essential) 9:55
class. The (absolutely essential) facilities
staff had cleared the path to campus, however. Once on campus, I stopped at the coffee bar, only to discover, to my horror, that
it was nonessential; I had to backtrack to
Tarble to get my caffeine fix. The library
was essential, and consequently so was my
afternoon shift working at the circulation
desk. Sharpies was essential, Essie Mae's
was less so.

According to the college's severe
weather plan, it seems that college administrators are not essential. This means, I
think, that their presence in their Parrish
offices is not absolutely necessary for the
basic business of Swarthmore to go on. In
contrast, the staff who serveus food, clean
our hallways, clear our sidewalks of snow,
and maintain the physical plant were officially marked off as essentialstaff. Their
presence was needed, required under the
official weather contingency plans, for the
life of the college to go on.
Faculty seemed to be in a nether world in
all this; it was apparently left to their own
discretion whether to hold class. College
faculty don'tfit neatly into the usual job categories, and they're famously resistant to
administrators telling them what to do. On
the collective level, they are essential, "sine
qua non," the very incarnation of the
college's overarching educational mission.
But, day to day, what an individual faculty
member does is pretty much up to him or
her. Lots of faculty presumably wanted to
hold class last Tuesday so they could cover
the planned material. Faculty are not subjectto thekinds of immediate, hourly pressures that other staff are under.
Getting to work was more difficult for
everyone, which again highlighted the divisions among Swarthmore's workforce. Most
faculty live in Swarthmore and can walk to
work pretty easily, but lots of otherstaff rely
on the public bus system to get here. In the
snowstorm, staff who live further away had
to negotiate another system that was itself
struggling to deal with the day's hazards.
Faculty and staff with young children
faced a whole other set of issues, which
brings back my own memories of listening
to theradio very early in the morning, waiting breathlessly for my school's name to be
mentioned among the closings. A kid's eager wish, of course, can be a parent's nightmare; since on-site day care does not exist
in any way, shape, or form at Swarthmore,
let alone as an "essential" service, lots of
college employees had to scramblefor ways
to take care of their kids.
As I got my ID swiped at the entrance to
Sharpies, a couple of staff members' kids
playing near the entrance reminded me that
our lives at Swarthmore, sealed from the
real world though they often seem to be, are
very deeply embedded in the universe of
work and money and families and getting
up early in the morning all those things I
remember from the years before I joined
thiseffete corps of impudent snobs (as Spiro
Agnew referred to academia), and to which,
I'm a little relieved to say, I will return.

(U-WIRE) AMES, lowa
After the
shootings at Columbine last spring, the
right wing wasted no time lashing out at
Marilyn Manson, KMFDM and "Doom,"
blaming them for the horrific actions of
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
It seemed like censorship would arise as
one of the hottest topics of this election year.
But now that election mania is at its
peak, many candidates haven't addressed
censorship at all. Most of them have
dodged the issue, opting to convey their
ideas about health care, campaign finance
reform and the military.
Maybe censorship is too controversial,
and when you're a presidential candidate
looking to maintain voter appeal, it's best
to stand clear of it.
Unless you're Bill Clinton, waving goodbye to the White House without the worry
of losing votes in an upcoming election.
During Thursday's State of the Union
Address, Clinton brought up the topic of
censorship, offering some ideas that just
don't make sense.
"I want to begin by thanking the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games,"
Clinton said. "But, frankly, the ratings are
too numerous, diverse and confusing to be
really useful to parents. So tonight, I ask
the industry to accept the First Lady's
challenge to develop a single voluntary
rating system for all children's entertainment that is easier for parents to understand and enforce."
Lewinsky scandal aside, Clinton has
enacted a lot of legislation compatible with
many of the Democratic ideals I consider
important.
He's done wonders for education and
been a strong supporter of environmental issues and health care, but when it
comes to censorship of entertainment, he's
tended to be a bit on the wishy-washy side.
Current regulations regarding the censorship of entertainment media are completely flawed and can never do justice to
what we in this country hold to be an inherent right to freedom of speech and expression.
Rating systems just don't work.
For years, kids have been sneaking into
R-rated movies, and at least renting them
at the video store, if they are denied entrance into the theater.
Whether censorship supporters like it
or not, kids will always be exposed to lyrics conservatives deem "explicit."
The infamous black-and-white sticker
with the words "Parental Advisory Explicit Lyrics" just isn't a valid way of
evaluating lyrical content.
In fact, it's obvious record companies
sometimes use the sticker as a marketing

tool to sell more albums. The music industry knows much of the appeal of gangsta
rap and heavy metal is itsrebellious spirit.
By applying the sticker to albums, they
can attract buyers and listeners.
The American Civil Liberties Union has
been a staunch supporter of anti-censorship regulations.
According to the ACLU Web site, the
Recording Industry Association of
America issued the system of uniform labeling in 1990, offering no guidelines for
what should be considered "explicit."
It affirms the fact that placing the stickers is optional for record companies, ana"
that they can apply it when they see fit.
The ACLU points ouj that the RIAA has
targeted rock and rap albums for explicit
lyrics stickers, but not recordings of country music, opera or musical comedy that
contain the same "explicit" words or
phrases.
Furthermore, while "fuck" could be
sprinkled all over the lyrics of one album
and not contain a warning sticker, it coulsU**-*
appear once on a different album which
still cautions for explicit lyrics.
Basically, censorship is another example of the music industry acting as a
bureaucracy. The industry wants to be
seen as a moralistic entity, looking out for
its consumers by applying these stickers.
Warning stickers are just pointless figureheads
puppets used to create an
image of the concerned music industn
looking out for its consumers.
In reality, though, record companies
don't care about the content of their products; they just want your money.
Many complain that censorship is important because it helps discourage acts
of violence among youth. They use movies and music as a scapegoat, looking for
an easy explanation for why tragedies like
Columbine occur.
The truth is, we can't denounce entertainment for corrupting the youth of
America. It's just too simplistic of an explanation. Children are a product of how
their parents have shaped them, and their
actions reflect this.
Parents should be responsible for the
values they instill in their children, not
entertainment.
In the months that remain before the
election, I want the candidates to talk
about the issue of censorship. As a primary consumer of arts and entertainment,
censorship is at the top of my list of important issues.
Sooner or later, the time will come for
government to consider harsher censorship regulation.
For liberals and advocates of freedom
of speech, we can only hope the new pe>son in charge of our country understands
the importance of preserving artistic
merit and condemns the bastardization of
our entertainment.

The alien at Swat... might be human
By Hofan Chau
Phoenix Staff

Salutations, from the Alien at Swat.
For those of you who have pondered
upon the title of my cartoon, let me explain. It was drawn by an alien that arrived by a metal bird. Oh yes. Immigration made me stand in line next to the
squat red Martians and the fragile will'owisps from Venus.
So what is it like to be an alien? To come
from a place where (according to the Chinese restaurant in the Ville), we eat
"Noodles in Delicious Brown Sauce"?
This winter, I went to the Multi-Cultural
Institute Winter Institute organized here.
Surely I thought, multiculturalism... many
cultures... but it was all American! Um,
urn.... what about cultures outside the
States?
Trust me, I had a wonderful time there
and learned a lot about the diversity of this
country. It was wonderfulbecause it gave
me a deeper understanding about this
country, a place I am to live in for three
more years. Someone even thanked me for
bothering to learn and care andbe active
about the issues (we say "problems" back
in Hong Kong) here. Argh! Did you think
that America has a monopoly on racism,
classism, sexism, homophobia, and the
rest of the -isms? Don't you know that I
care because there is something very common about human beings being nasty to
other human beings?
At the same time, can you conceive a
culture where homosexuality is so taboo
that it doesn't exist in society? Where guys
walk hand in hand, and grown-up girls
sleep on the same bed? Or of sexism so
integrated in the culture that it's not a Big
Deal?
I think a lot of Aliens like me when we
first land in this country find that Americans make a Big Deal out of things. Which
of course is understandable considering
the history of the States. Yet there are
many different ways to go about changing the world. Making noise about your
rights is only one of them.
Before you shout "Free Tibet," do you
really know what it is like to be Tibetan?
Or Chinese? What communism in China
means to its people? Before you judge

China over human rights and lack of individuality, think: Why? Why did the culture
develop so?
Perhaps it is easy for citizens of a Dominant Power to forget that there are many
many other countries and cultures outside, many of which hold norms very different from theirs. Other countries who
subscribe to CNN or are blasted with
American pop culture are reminded of a
different viewpoint of life from their own
culture every time they turn on the TV.
(Unless you have no TV, or your government owns all the channels.)
We talk of Swarthmore the Bubble.
Sure, it's easy to intellectualizeabout stuff
and talk of far away places. I've sat
through a class where we talked about a
terrible war going on right as we spoke
and people have nodded and jotted down
notes as if it was a math equation. At least
Swat is a little better then some other institutions. My Canadian friend tells me her
poli-sci class discussion on nuclear warfare went thus:
"I think nuclear arms is bad."

"You know I don't see why we need the
capacity to blow ourselves up 37 times
over. Isn't once enough?"
The teacher's response? "Hmm. Does
anyone else have a problem with that?"
I think Swatties are at least more
worldly than that. Yet often in classes I
still there is a long way to go and I am a
little tired of saying, "Urn, that's not the
truth in my country..." American values
are not the only values!
Please, stop and think. Go forth and discover other paradigms. Have you ever
thought about:
What does it mean to be American?
What does it mean to be an Earthling, a
global citizen? What does it mean to be a
human being?
Am I, being of a different nationality,
that different from you, an American?
Different, yes. Oh yes. As different as a
Peruvian is from an Argentinean. Or a
Korean from Japanese from Chinese. As
different as my values are from my cousin
at U-Mich.
But alien?

LETTERTOTHE EDITOR

To the Editor:
There may be a lot of validity to Nate
Stulman's argument in his recent opinions
piece in The Phoenix (Jan. 27, pg. 9). Personally, I'm pretty value-neutral on the
topic. Print. Photocopy. What do I care?
Still, his treatise in last week's Phoenix
does not fully grapple with the issue.
Essentially, what he's attempted to do is
to create a cost-benefit analysis. Those
economists, hisbastions of efficiency, would
generally give this technique a thumbs up.
Unfortunately, he's only done a ramshackle
job in his analysis. In order for a cost-benefit analysis to be worth the newsprint it's
printed on, it has to attempt to account for
all significant costs andbenefits—or at least
as many of them as he can think of.
I'll rattle off a few examples to demonstrate my point:
Digital copies are theft-and-lossproofed. Often copies are stolen from reserve binders at the library, resulting in
frustration and wasted time for students.
Analog is now. Digital is forever. Once
the electronic file is created, it can be
viewed and accessed semester after se-

|

many as you need, anywhere. Digital copies can be accessed by Swarthmore students at home on breaks, cross-registered
Bryn Mawr students in their dorm rooms,
faculty on the road, or from your laptop
in the Kohlberg coffee bar.
The pleasure of students. By all accounts that I've heard, the digital readings
currently being distributed by the
library's e-reserve system are very popular with students. The happiness of resource users is a benefit.
The college's e-reserve system is the
result of a grant from the Andrew J.
Mellon Foundation. Had we submitted a
grant saying, "We're going to print photocopies of articles for students," the college would have received no funding, and
would have alienated itself from one of
its most important donor foundations.
Our current e-reserve project allows
our librarians to make sure that electronic
copies are brought into compliance with
applicable copyright laws. By centralizing the permission-seeking and royaltypayment process, we can bring about the
equivalent of an insurance policy against
costly litigation for the college.

spaces so small you couldn't see them with

probably quote for you the cost to the college of maintaining one linear foot of

And that cost might make your eyes pop

Voters this season are more concerned
than ever that they don't know enough
about the candidates to make an informed
decision when they go to the primary polls.
Withlittle more than sound bytes to go on,
serious voters wonder how to decide
among seven Presidential candidates and
countless state and local office-seekers.
Enter Project Vote Smart, a non-profit,
non-partisan public interest organization
that seeks to provide as much free and
accessible informationabout political candidates as possible. Founded in 1990 with
support from the likes of Barry
Goldwater, Geraldine Ferraro and Bill
Bradley, PVS seeks to provide extensive
biographical and contact information,
public statements, voting records, campaign finance sources, survey results and
special interest groups' evaluations of all
candidates on all levels.
The most helpful of these to voters, it
seems, is the extensive survey PVS sends
to the candidates. The survey asks for
candidates' detailed positions on dozens
of the most pressing political issues of the
day. It does not ask them about their
sexual problems or their devotionto Jesus.
Of course, the quality of the information
Vote Smart can provide is limited by the
cooperation of the candidates. Some, including Bush, Gore and Bradley, have refused
to give a comprehensive, public account of
their positions on the issues. PVS leaves it
to voters to decide what that means.
Bush did fill out a different survey in
1998 when he ran for Governor of Texas,
so PVS provides those responses instead.
Republicans John McCain, Steve Forbes,
GaryBauer andAlan Keyes responded to
the survey.
Even when candidates don't respond to
the survey, special interest groups rate them
based on their voting record. For example,
Al Gore got a 100 percent rating from
Planned Parenthood but a zero rating from
Citizens Against Government Waste.
McCain received 100 percent from the NRA
but got a zero from Planned Parenthood.
In the interesting-but-useless category,
Project Vote Smart collects information on
all candidates, even those no one has heard
of. It lists about 25 political parties for the
2000 presidential election, for a total of 150
candidates! Sixty claim to be running as
either Democrats or Republicans. Other
dubious candidates include Jackson Kirk
Grimes of the United Fascist Union Party,
Temperance Alesha Lance-Council of the
Anti-Hypocrisy Party, Da Vid of the Light
Party, and Michael Ross Tunick Strauss of
"Mike's Party." Their photographs are
downloadable.
The key point here is that information
about our office-holders and candidates is
available, it might just take some work on
our parts. But isn't that what healthy citizenship isall about —being active citizens?
Project Vote Smart is available on theWeb

circus,

Shorter
exam period
is bad news
In their witch's cauldron of proposed
changes to the academic calendar, the Curriculum Committee has included the idea
to hold graduation earlier at the cost of
shortening the spring exam period. lb understand how ludicrous this is, it's necessary to have some background information.
In 1990 the faculty designed and instituted the calendar we have been using for
the past decade, and this year it is the Curriculum Committee's responsibility to reexamine the college calendar. The committee has cooked up a few potential changes,
the most devastating of which is the proposal to hold graduation a week earlier at
the cost of shortening the time that students have to prepare for and take Honors
written exams, course final exams, concentration requirements or comps in a double
major. Their proposal would shrink the
Honors written exam period from nine
days to five days and course final exam
period from nine days to eight days.
The Curriculum Committee offers two
feeble reasons, and a third whichis implicit
but equally pointless, for wanting to dothis.
Their first rationale is that Honors written exams warranted a nine day exam period because in the past students took eight
written exams for an eight preparation
program. Currently Honors students only
take four written exams, and thus they
think that nine days is excessive. What the
Curriculum Committee completely fails to
recognize is that perhaps eight exams in
nine days was hellishly excessive. Their
second reason is that some people think
that the period between the end ofclasses
and graduation is too long. Who precisely
thinks this I have no idea I can only presume it would be faculty, staff, and administrators who want to jump start their summer holiday, and that this is the third and
implicit reason for the proposal. While
there are approximately four weeks between the end of classes and graduation,
during that time students take Honors and
course exams and complete their concentrationrequirements or comps in a double
major while also indulging in a week of
Dionysian and hedonisticpleasures known
as Senior Week.
There are a host of good reasons to
leave the current May schedule as it
stands. Shortening the period for both
Honors written and course exams would
merely serve to make the examination
period more stressful. Even if there are
a few disgruntled students who want
graduation to be a week earlier, it would
certainly be unfair to appease themat the
cost of forcing students who may have
Honors written exams, course exams, and
comps in a double major to complete their
work in a shorter amount of time than
other students had in years past.
The Curriculum Committee's proposal
is absurd, and the onus is on the student
body to tell the faculty and administration that it is an unfair proposal, because
otherwise it might just be instituted.

By Jesse Taylor
For The Phoenix

All is not right in the land of the fourcolor fantasy.
Comic books are in trouble. Tom
Breevort, an editor for Marvel Comics
(creator of Spider-Man, the X-Men, and
the Fantastic Four, among others), feels
that the death knell for the industry is
sounding, and that the beleaguered enterprise will be gone in less than five years.
But why? I'm sure almost all of us can
remember, at some point or another, reading a comic book or being introduced to
comic book characters. We all know Superman. He is an American icon, having
enthralled us for three generations. We
know Batman. We know Spider-Man, and
more recently, the X-Men.
The Statement of Ownership that runs
yearly in comics reveals something disturbing. Daredevil, a Marvel comic that
can be considered a bona fide hit, sells 8090,000 copies per month. 15 years ago, a
comic selling twice that would have been
canceled, no questions asked. The cutoff
at Marvel for cancellation is about 40,000
per month, at DC, about 25-30,000 per
month.
On the surface, the problem seems to
be availability. Go into your local grocery
store or drug store. Try to find a comic
book. There may be a few ragged copies
of Superman or some Archie digests next
to Better Homes and Gardens. But, far and
wide, the only place to find comics are in
dedicated comic book stores. Often out of
the way, these stores make the chore of
buying what used to be an impulse item
even more difficult than it already was.
These dedicated stores helped to promote the three overarching problems
plaguing comics today:
1. Availability. A lot of comic stores got
inordinately successful because comics
were very popular. They then complained

when they were doing great business, because they felt that grocery stores and the
like were drawing away from their business. So, Diamond ComicDistributors (the
distributor of 90-95 percent of American
comics) withdrew product from their normal outlets and focused exclusively on the
comic-oriented stores. The problem? Consumers don't just know that they want
things. They have to be exposed to them.
By taking away the primary method of
exposure, point of purchase impulse buys,
Diamond committed what could be one of
the worst business decisions in history.
2. Content. If you pick up most mainstream comic books, you will be embroiled
in an overwrought angst play, replete with
meaningless violence and empty plot. In
1992, several of Marvel Comics' hottest
artists decided that they wanted to fight
the good fight for creators' rights. Not
having realized that the battle had been
fought and won 20 years earlier, this group
created Image Comics. Creator owned and
operated, it could have brought exposure
to both the creator-owned small press
realm, and to ideas that differed from the
superhero norm. They instead took the
grim-n-gritty fad that had been made all
the rage by Frank Miller's "The Dark
Knight Returns" and Alan Moore's
"Watchmen," and removed any narrative
structure from it. In the end, they came
up with numerous gaudily clad superheroes (that bore more than a passing resemblance to other well-known heroes) standing around moaning and killing.
3. Collector Mentality. Todd
MacFarlane, Jim Lee, and Rob Liefeld
are all millionaires. MacFarlane's
"Spawn" was a movie. Lee's WiIdC.A.T.S.
became a television show. Liefeld made
copies of every popular character under
the sun and people bought enough of
them to put his kids through Harvard.
Why were they so big, other than name
recognition? Collectors. People who

DEA DELCAMPO | For The Phoenix

shelled out hundreds of dollars to comics that will hopefully appreciate in
value, not reading them, because that
might damage them. This brought on a
rash of new premiere issues, new characters, and desperate events and gimmicks in the hopes of drawing in
buyers. Multiple covers, multiple interiors, big events, all of these things
brought in people who were buying, and
pushed out people who were reading.
So, how does this get fixed? Try this: An
issue of Superman on the newsstand at
Genuardi's. Clean, prominent, seated next
to dozens of other comics. This issue of
Superman has a story starting, and then
ending either in that issue, or in the next*
issue. The reader is told all that they need
to know to read the issue within the issue,
and can be comfortable that the next issue will be just as entertaining, and just
as available as the previous one.
It's not that hard. It was done for years.
It can be done again. And this is the last
chance that comic books will get.

Vouchers widen rich-poor education gap.
To the Editor:
In his article last week "Give out vouchers," (Opinions, pg. 10) Tony Hillery wrote
that vouchers were "one of the quickest,
easiest, and most effective ways to reform
the American educational system." While
I agree that implementing vouchers would
be one of the quickest and easiest things
to do, I strongly disagree that it would be
one of the most effective solutions. After
living through Republican Governor Jeb
Bush's voucher program in Florida, I feel
that vouchers only widen the education
gap between rich and poor students.
What Mr. Hillery fails to do in his article is explain how the voucher program
actually works. In Florida, for example,
only after a public school is labeled a failing school by the state are students in that
district eligible for vouchers. The vouchers, however, for the most part do not
cover the entire cost of going to a good
private school.
So what happens? The wealthier students in the district take their vouchers
and go to private schools. Meanwhile, the
poorer students in the district who cannot afford going to private school even
with the vouchers have no choice but to
continue attending the "failing" school.
Do we want to help the wealthier students get a private school education at the
cost of leaving the poorer studentsbehind
at a "failing" public school? Using public
dollars to help some students get into private schools hurts those left behind by
taking money away from teacher salaries,

school construction, and teaching materials. In addition, private and parochial
schools, which have the right to accept or
reject applicants, for the most part only
take the higher-performing children, leaving public school classrooms filled with a
higher percentage of students with learning, language, and behavioral problems.
Mr. Hillery goes on to label parents who
leave their children in these failing
schools as "negligent" parents. I feel this
characterization is both incredibly unfair
and somewhat ignorant. Unfortunately,
Mr. Hillery fails to take into account the
large number of hard working parents
who care about their children's education
very much but do not have the financial
capabilities (with or without the vouchers)

to jump ship and send them to private

school. I personally disagree with Mr.
Hillery that loving, caring parents who
cannot afford a private institution should
be labeled "negligent" parents.
The real solution should be to use the
voucher money to improve the failing public schools. Forgetting about public schools
and letting them fail will not make the education problem go away. It will just make*
the education gap between rich and poor
that much more noticeable. Hopefully, if
Mr. Hillery truly believes his own rhetoric
that "all parents deserve the opportunity
to provide their children with a decent education," he will rethink his position and
realize that vouchers are not the answer.

Flushed!

NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN j Phoenix Staff

A tawdry tak of bathroom humor
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhi man
Phoenix Staff
"Please reCORNELL SECOND FLOOR, Jan. 31
member that this is the no talking floor," scolds the sign
in the stairwell. "If you must carry on a conversation,
please go downstairs."
Swarthmore's science and engineering library prohibits all verbal discussion here, making it one of the quietest, most intense places on campus. You can feel the floor
concentrating. The air pressure is a hundred millibars
or so higher than normal, amplifying the slightest sound
of pencil scratching from the desk across the room and
steadily straining students' senses until they need to communicate with something, anything.
Many natural science majors acquire that need for articulation from long periods of reading and homework,
but few follow the sign at the top of the stairs. They remain on the second floor, with their mouths motionless
but their brains busy. The stimulation-starved masses
use scrawled messages to communicate in the commode.
At first glance, the Cornell men's bathroom appears
neat
utilitarian like the rest of the building. (This
reporter did not investigate the lexicography of the female lavatory.) In fact, if one came in only to use the
urinal he might leave with that superficial impression.
But opening one of the two toilet stalls exposes the sheets
of paper that cover the walls, protecting them from sarcastic scrawlings such as the one that complains about
its stall's writing amenities: "[s]3o,ooo a year and we don't
get a decent board. Hmmm."
The messages display mixed emotion. Few are serious,
although the humor in many is wryly true. They are so plentifulthat it took 30 consecutive minutes in the bathroom to
copy down only those that were funniest. There is little
art, but, it being the science library, there are a few graphs
to demonstrate a point. Because they are public, many
especially the most controversial
garner multiple re-

sponses that wind their way around the paper. The stall's

next user receives verbose transcripts of this irreverence

and irrelevance, much like bad e-mail forwards.
Unlike most e-mail, though, a great deal of the comments reflect some thought, so it seems Swatties cannot
escape their intelligence when on the toilet. In fact, there
is such a dearth of vulgarity and bathroom humor that
even this campus's bathroom scribblings start to reflect
President Al Bloom's concept of "ethical intelligence."
In Cornell, it begins on the door of the stall next to the
urinal. The only laser-printed writing in sight reminds
patrons, "Please do NOT throw toilet paper on the floor"
and adds a cheesy italicized "Thank you!" Below that, a
similar sign says, "PleaseFLUSH the toilets."But someone found that illogical and noted his qualification: "I'm
sorry, I only use one at a time."
Above both of these is an argument over whether David
Duke is a "putz" or a "Great American Leader." A nearby
response slurs the author of the latter comment, ending
the debate, for now.
The handicapped stall gets less use, at least judging
from the volume of writing there. But it has the advantage of a tiled wall. Dozens of puns on the word "grout"
are squeezed into the tiny white spaces between the tan
tiles. Among them: "Sauer-grout," "Alexander the grout,"
"Wall creatures grout and small," "Oscar the groutch,"
and "Twist and grout."
Opposite this are two unfinished top-10 lists. The roster of "Non-science majors seen in Cornell" manages to
include only one name. Similarly, the "Top 10 ways to get
laid at Swat (please contribute)" list stops after counting
down to number four, apparently under the impression
that there are no more than seven ways.
Back in the other stall, there are more comments complaining about the pressure of the college. For instance,
someone thought a cute yellow smiley face was so incongruous that he wrote, "That's easy for you to say...
Try going to Swat for a semester."

The offended artist wrote back, "I am a junior biochem
major." But that just inspired the response, "Find a support group, you're a minority." This, of course, set off a
vigorous debate over the role of support groups on campus, one that trailed off into the shadowy corner of the
page.
Elsewhere on the right side of the stall (strangely, the
density of comments is far lower on the left side, which
has the toilet paper roll) are two graphs depicting theories about the college's student body. One, whichis unitless,
compares the mean ability of Swarthmore students and
people in the "real world" in fixing cars and in dribbling
basketballs. Both comparisons are, of course, lopsided.
The other graph was titled the "half-life of cuteness"
and stated that beauty declines along the "time at Swat"
axis. It was drawn next to an inconclusive discussion of
whether the Class of 2003 contained any "hotties."
Judging from the response, though, far more
Swarthmore men seemed to be interested in "The Great
Toilet Politics Poll." The poll's unscientific sampling predicts a defeat of vice president Al Gore if the contest
were held today. Gore received 3 votes, while former
senator Bill Bradley got 20 and Texas governor George
W. Bush failed miserably with only 1. Arizona Senator
John McCain, off the ballot in the crapper as well as in
New York, received 11 write-in votes. The survey also
gave some indication of voter apathy, with two respondents choosing "Who are these people?" Of course, all
bets are off for the election since "your mom" got 6 votes,
and "me," an unprecedented tally of 52.
That smart-aleck attitude extended across the page,
ending the discussion of politics and beginning one much
more immediate. "Why," the wallasks, "do we take a shit
and not leave a shit?"
Nearby, in smaller lettering, a response questions why,
even in the bathroom adjoining the most studious room
on campus, the scribblings have to be so, uh, academic.
"Do we give a shit?"

Feng Shui a positive source of well-being

The Daily Cougar (U. Houston)

tßetuße
'The Sopranos'
televisions's best
The whole thing sounded like the set-up

to a joke I wasn't going to like: a mobster

walks into his psychiatrist's office and
says... But when "The Sopranos" (HBO,
Sundays 9p.m.) turned out to be truly beautiful instead, it was like finding a symphony
tuning up in a bathroom stall. Originally
rejected by each of the four major networks, this series about a mobster on the
verge of a nervous breakdown turned out
to be the surprise hit of last year. It was
nominatedfor a whopping sixteen Emmys
and had the self-respect to lose all but one
of them, and it made TV, like the best TV,
seem inexhaustible in its ability to describe
the weird complexities of American lives.
If "The Godfather" trilogy constituted
a kind of blood opera, then "The Sopranos" comes across as something better: a
pop song—like The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" or maybe Weezer's "Say It Ain't
So"— whose banal and stupidly familiar
subject matter makes our everyday doings, our falling in love and our sitting on
our asses, light up, revealing and irradiating them as infinitely rich, exquisitely
textured and deeply felt. The show's finest moments come as much from the pathos and comedy of domesticity as from
the gross, grim violence of criminal fraternity; and the show's magic is made in
the suffocating closeness of the two.
I figure plot summary is just going to get
confusing. Suffice it to say, "The Sopranos"
is about a family of North Jersey mobsters
like "The New Testament" is about a fruity
carpenter and his twelve homeless buddies.
The show, which boasts about twenty solid
roles, dilates around the character of Tony
(James Gandolfini), a mob kingpin and family man who's absolutely and spectacularly
losing his shit. Gandolfini was a character
actor specializing in rapists before he got
to work inside one of the most original character creations in the last decade of television. To call this meatball-shaped manarevelation would be underselling him he's a
freaking miracle.
As a guy stricken by that brain disease
of the baby boomer middle-aged, the
midlife crisis, Gandolfini makes Tony by
turns heartbreaking and monstrous, confused and cocky, terribleand terribly broken down, sensitive and vicious, very very
funny and very very sad.
American audiences might love mob
movies for their family meshes and
messes of murdering goombahs, but Tony
with his fucked-up life is like a man trying to adjust the rabbit ears on a station
that won't come in clear for him. Peace,
which he wants so badly, just won't hold.
John Corman, a TV critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, gets it right when he says,
"There's a reason Tony can't find his bliss
at home; at his strip joint hangout, the
Bada-bing Club; or in his psychoanalyst's
office. He's a criminal; his life has rotted
from the inside out."
I love "The Sopranos" for all the reasons above, but I have to say that I hate
the way that everyone has just wet themselves over the show, as if this was the first

And this week, a reminder about never
underestimating your opponent based on
their size.
What: "Gon" Books I-IV by Masashi
Tanaka (Paradox Press)

A history lesson: Dinosaurs continue to
fascinate people of all ages; this is a fact.
It isalso fact that these gigantic creatures
roamed the earth 65 million years ago.
But rather than focus on facts, such as
the long-gone T. rex, pterodactyl, or stegosaurus, Tanaka chooses to tell the tales of
the one dino that continues to roam the
planet today: Gon.
He is the smallest (and arguably the
cutest) of dinosaurs, but also extremely
fierce and deadly. Standing at about 2 feet
tall, with large jaws, huge feet, and tiny
little arms, Gon doesn't really appear to
pose much of a threat to anyone.
Tanaka reminds us that looks can be incredibly deceiving. He has created in this
collection ofbooks 12 stories that highlight
Gon's adventures throughout the globe.
The tales are realistic and also fun, unexpected and delightfully humorous.
For example, in "Gon Fights Alongside
the Wolf Brothers," Gon leads four wolf
cubs in an effort to avenge the death of
their mother by a monstrous Siberian tiger. The tiger, the tundra wolves and the
death of the mother create a scenario not
at all uncommon to Siberian wildlife.
The presence of Gon, however, creates
a plot twist, the results of which are gor-

source of well-being and prosperity for its
occupants," Seann Xenja, a Feng Shuipractitioner, said. "Living and working in places

that reflect imbalance can cause or exacerbate many of the problems and stress of
modern life."
Underlying the principles of Feng Shui is
the concept ofch'i -life energy. This energy
fills the atmosphere, and people as well.
"A person's ch'i animates the body and is
the source of their unique essence," Xenja
said.
The importance of the ch'i is that of interplay between people and the environment. The goal of Feng Shui is to harmonize andbalance energies while curingproblem areas and deflecting harmful energies.
"Ch'i enters a structure through its doors
and windows," Xenja said. Hallways and
interior walls serve as corridors for the flow
of ch'i throughout the building. Plants, furniture arrangements, objects such as mirrors, round-cut glass crystals and brass
wind chimes can further direct and shape
the course of ch'i."
Now what? So your dorm faces the
wrong way and there is no immediate
source of water other than what collects in
the gutter, or what is stored in the tank of
the toilet. Without feeling vital in your
space, how can you possibly be expected
to perform?
In most situations, easy solutions will cure
your problem, unless of course, your
"space" happens to be built over a cemetery
If that is the case, call the wrecking ball.
If you suspect that your dorm or apartment has a problem, call a Feng Shui consultant to do a reading. Like a doctor doing
an exam, theconsultant will visityour space
and give advice on how best to arrange and

design for maximum harmony andbalance.
In addition, the consultant can also diagnose
problems and offer remedies.
"One of the easiest things to do to remedy poor Feng Shui is to rid the room of clutter, get rid of sharp angles and create a
workspace with a wide view of the room,"
Wilcox said. "This will better focus attention and heighten creativity."
If it's your ch'i that's feeling under the
weather, Wilcox recommends adding nine
healthyplants to your office or bedroom. If
you're sleeping on a waterbed don't.The
stagnant water could cause urinary or bladder problems.
Wilcox also recommends minimizing the
existenceof electricalboxes and appliances.
Outlets, transformers, electric blankets,
microwaves, computers and other electrical devices slowly affect the nervous system. If you're feeling like life in the hall
closet might be safe, think again. All rooms
must be well-illuminated and ventilated.
Your home can be fixed, and so can your
office, but what about your school? You
could transfer to a more Feng Shui-friendly
university
although to Wilcox's knowledge, there are no universities set up according to Feng Shui. The only alternative,
then, is to fix what we've got.
Wilcox recommends starting at the top.
"I would start with offices of the administrators, because Feng Shui is related to exposure. To have good Feng Shui in a classroom really doesn't mean anything if you
don't spend a substantial amount of time in
it," Wilcox said.
Starting with the decision-makers would
have a trickle-down effect. Let's just hope
it works better than the last promises of
"trickle down."

Gon a delightful, ferocious dino
geously detailed by Tanaka to make up a
moving story.
A nature lesson: In short, "Gon" is National Geographic meets "When Animals
Attack." While Tanaka takes a few liberties and adds some anthropomorphic effects to his drawings, for the most part
his artwork is quite detailedand realistic.
His subjects are all animals; he includes
no humans. The landscape ranges from
the Amazon River ("Gon Goes Down the
Big River") to the Australian outback
("Gon Glares"). Tanaka takes care to incorporate the animals indigenous to these
areas in his stories.
"Gon" is also presented without captions
or dialogue. Thus, Tanaka relies on subtle
facial expressions to convey the emotions
of his animal characters and clear, concise artwork to portray the story.
At its heart, "Gon" is an underdog story.
The cute dino is generally pitted against
the "kings" of the wild, such as the grizzly bear or lion. The reader will undoubtedly root for Gon.
These confrontations sometimes involve Gon protecting the helpless, but
their primary feature is the almost sadistic pleasure that Gon receives when taking down something 10 times its size. Oh,
and Gon always wins.
But Tanaka knows the power of irony
as well. My favorite story in this collection is "Gon Struggles Against a Tick," in
which the little dino that has downed an
American Black Bear and a Siberian Tiger meets his match in a little tick that
crawls into his nose.

games. Wolves are mauled and little birds
are attacked. In short, these stories aren't
for pacifists. However, in the wild, pacifists have a habit of losing their lives.
I recommend "Gon" as a great survival
story. It is also a wonderful reminder to
watch out for the little guy. I don't think
it's necessary to buy all four books from
this collection, but you deserve to treat
yourself (or someone you like!) to one of
the four books. Get to know Gon, you
won't regret it.

Concluding remarks: Before Pokemon,
there was Gon. The books were an instant
sensation in Japan, leading me to believe
the Japanese have exclusive rights to all
things cute.
But beware; this isn't all cuteness and

Fun fact: If you're really good at Tekken
3 on the Sony Play Station, you can play as
Gon! First beat the gamewith all theregular characters, and then beat the Ball
mode. Then you get to play as Gon! Have
a blast.

Ryder, Jolie inhibited by script in 'Girl, Interrupted'

Film compared to 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest;' takes fresh view of institutionalization
By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff
If you've read Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" or seen the movie,
you know the basic premise: a group of men whose lives are long lost to the twisted,
methodical conditioning of the psychiatric ward they call home are greatly impacted
by one man who refuses to conform to the system. Kesey's character McMurphy waltzes
in and shakes things up, forces the men into awareness, and tempts them to question
insanity and humanity.
Kesey's take on theevils of the establishment presented the American public with a
new concept, and since the release of his novel in 1962, his theme has been adapted,
twisted, manipulated and rehashed in countless ways. Set in the same decade, the
recently-released "Girl, Interrupted" offers a fresh take on the trials of institutionalization. Only this time they are ladybirds who, led by Winona Ryder's character Susanna
Kaysen, prepare to fly over the cuckoo's nest.
"Girl, Interrupted" is a direct adaptation of Kaysen's written account of her own
institutionalization, and the movie begins as do most films adapted from books. Ryder,
as Susanna, fills the theater with her rich voice, educating the audience with the narrative necessary to its understanding of Kaysen's current predicament. This is facilitated by some wonderful imagery and intense flashbacks that stop abruptly about
halfway into the film. Susanna tells the audience about her high school graduation and
how she fell asleep and thereforefailed to respond when the orator called her name to
accept her diploma; how she met JaredLeto's character, her sexy random hook-up, at
the post-grad party, and how afterwards she swallowed an entire bottle of aspirin,
chasing it with a bottle of vodka in an attempt to "cure her headache."
The stage set, Susanna sits before a retired psychologist, a friend of her father's*
who tells her, after visiting only briefly and listening only selectively, that the best
for a person like her is Claymoore, a psychiatric hospital not far from her home.
Astonished and confused, Susanna climbs into a waiting taxicab with no way of anticipating the crazy things that lie before her. Shortly after her arrival, Susanna meets
unkempt, tangle-haired Lisa (played excellently by Angelina Jolie), who is hauledkicking and screaming back to the ward for her eighth admittance.
Lisa is a free spirit; a charming, manipulative, and very controlling sociopath. She
harasses the other patients and heckles the staff, but she hits it off with Susanna almost immediately. Over the course of Susanna's two-year stay, the two form a close
bond, which they both come to value (though Susanna doesn't always agree withLisa's
behavior, which results in her own shock therapy and affects those around them to an

Crackling tension between Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie ignites their newest film.
even greater degree). They stick it out together, raging against the system that pushes
pills in their faces and analyzes their every move.
Both Jolie and Ryder, who was also an executive producer of the film, take their
roles to the limit and present dramatic, affecting characters stifled only by the restricting walls of their script. The over-reliance on narration and the inconsistencies
in the script definitely affect their performances, not because they aren't capable of a
top performance, but because they are working with an incredibly inhibiting script.
In all, the acting is fantastic, the story is poignant and thought-provoking, and the
lasting premise, like that in similar movies that have come before it, is an indispensable lesson in madness and the human condition.

Rose Tattoo Café to create venue for musicians
By Jae Won Chung
For The Phoenix
On Friday night at Paces, Rose Tattoo Cafe will open
for the first time, allowing the entire campus to enjoy
musical performances by Swarthmore students.
Those scheduled to perform include Damon
McMahon 'O2, David Murphy 'O2, Alisa Greenberg 'Ol
and the Standard Exploration. The first three performances will be solo acts, involving acoustic guitar and
vocals. Standard Exploration is a jazz band. Each act
expects to hold a 20 to 30 minute set.
The purpose of Rose Tattoo Cafe is to provide a lowpressure venue for the diverse musical talents of the
entire Swarthmore community.
"All genres are welcome," said Greenberg, one of
the principal organizers of the event. Other organizers include Jenny Yun 'Ol and JeffWu 'Ol.

Greenbergsaid that while themusic scene is strong

at Swarthmore, it is dominated by a number of elite
bands. The goal of Rose Tattoo Cafe is to provide op-

portunities for hidden musical talents on campus who
want to be heard but cannot find an appropriate venue
in which to perform.
The organizers were inspired by the Dead Dog Cafe,
a series of open mike nights staged in the Mary Lyon
breakfast room last year.
For now, Rose Tattoo Cafe will be scheduledmonthly.
Based on funding and the success of the first show,
the organizers will determine if the event should run
bimonthly. All those interested in performing in the
future are encouraged to contact the organizers.
Those planning to attend should expect a non-alcoholic, cafe atmosphere. The event will begin at 9 p.m.
in Paces. While refreshments will be available, "The
music will be the central attraction," said Greenberg.

Serial nature of television is what makes it so great
From SOPRANOS, pg. 15
time anything good ever made it onto television. TV critics are notoriously susceptible to a kind of chronic amnesia and their gushy forgetfulness usually results in
them declaring every big hit to be the absolute best show
ever. Case inpoint: The NewYork Times, apparently looking to burn its bridges with, well, everyone, called "The
Sopranos" "the greatest work of American popular culture in the last quarter century." That's so silly it seems
barely worth commenting on, and wouldreally only hold
true in some alternate dimension where Bob Dylan, Bill
Murray and David Letterman all died in some terrible
White Castle food poisoning epidemic in 1974.
Besides, my beef isn't with wanton hyperbolizing, it's
with this: a recent Time magazine spread announced that
"The Sopranos" is "filled with the kind of surprising stories, nuanced acting and hard won redemption that make
the show feel more like a mini-movie than a mere hour
of TV." It makes me mad that the moron who wrote that
thinks the highest compliment someone can pay a television show is to call it "cinematic," as in, "No, it's not
really just a TV show...it's practically a movie." But I

need to know, what makes television its own thing and
not just some smaller, shittier version of the movies?
I don't think a rundown of the unique possibilities of
the television medium will fit inside my wordlimit. However, I watch enough TV that it raises some eyebrows—my mom says I'm addicted—so I feel I have some authority on the subject of what's great about TV.
What I love most is the obvious serial nature of television shows. Even the crappiest of daytime soaps give us
lives that accrue biographies, experiences and backgrounds
like barnacles on a boat's hull or interest on back accounts.
Movies are concerned with one story about one group of
characters only—Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have no lives
before or after one another—but in television stories always lead into more stories. Shows are always bookended
by scenes from previous episodes and scenes from the next,
and these characters never get a break because they are
expected to live for our entertainment every week.
"The Sopranos" may not be the best television of the
last 25 years but lately it has been doing television's best.
The series gives viewers the most amazing feeling of
really seeing its characters loving, screwing, trying, killing, breaking, losing, happening, becoming.

BEARING THE BURDEN
Despite increased attention to staffing issues at Swarthmore in the last few years, many staff have concerns
regarding their salaries, training and education; opportunities for advancement; and role in college governance.
The general consensus among staff members seems to
be that their concerns are not taken as seriously as student and faculty concerns, and that they are not always
sufficiently valued by the college.
Out of the more than 500 non-faculty staff at
Swarthmore, fifteen were interviewed for this article,
of whom all but two asked to remain partly anonymous.
The interviewed staff members work in Dining Services,
Environmental Services, Physical Plant, McCabe Library
and various administrative positions. Although concerns
differed widely between departments and individuals,
wages, training and education were mentioned as problem areas by a majority of the staff interviewed. Most
felt that staff issues are not consistently given the priority they deserve.
These findings tend to support the results of a survey
administered to 187 staff, or 37 percent of the total staff
workforce, by the Staff Advisory Committee (SAC) in
late 1998. Seventy percent of survey respondents felt that
receiving fair pay "relative to other employees in their
work unit" was "one of the five most critical issues" or a
"fairly important issue." Moreover, 60 percent ofrespondents deemed receiving fair pay relative to other employees in the market a "critical" or "fairly important,"
issue and an approximately equal percentage said that
merit-based pay was similarly important.
In the realm of education, 58 percent of respondents
placed support for learning opportunities unrelated to
one's job in the "critical" or "fairly important" category.
And 55 percent of respondents indicated that the level
of regard given to staff concerns relative to faculty concerns also belonged in these high-priority categories.
On the other hand, most of the staff interviewed emphasized that their concerns were limited to distinct aspects of their work experience. Some praised the
college's pleasant, safe work environmentand described
an excellent relationship with their immediate supervisor.
This week's in depth article, the first in a two-part series, provides a brief history of staff concerns at
Swarthmore and focuses on staff salary and wages. Next
week's article will cover training and opportunities for
advancement; the grievance procedure and recruitment;
and Human Resources and the role of staff in college
governance.
In recent years, staff have increasingly voiced their
concerns. Although the College staff has never been
unionized, in the fall of 1991, two years after a report by
the Middle States Accreditation evaluation team reported
that many staff felt "underpaid [and] undervalued," nine
administrative assistants formed the Ad Hoc Salary ConCommittee. In the fall of 1996, a group of administrative assistants, including several on the Ad Hoc Committee, outlined a series of concerns related to staff salary and grievance procedures that they subsequently
brought to Provost Jennie Keith and former Director of
Human Resources Barbara Carroll.
This action prompted the college to respond to one of
the group's concerns—the inaccessibility of staff salary
structures—by publishing a chart showing the minimum
pay and Fair Market Rate (FMR). In the fall of 1997, the
Long-Range Planning Committee Sub Group on Staff Issues (PSG) convened for the first of a series of monthly

When people think of Swarthmore, the words "faculty" and
"students" often come to mind. But Swarthmore also includes
another group essential to the well-being of the college community:
staff. This week's article is the first of a two-part series that offers
an in-depth look at several key aspects of the staffing experience.

job evaluations, a living wage, a revised grievance pro-

cedure, increased support for training and education and

more opportunities for staff to play a role in college governance.
Many of these issues would be considered by the PSG
during the course of the planning process. Moreover, the
letter also led to the restructuring of SAC, an elected
body of staff representatives.
The efforts of the PSG culminated in its Accreditation
Self-Study report, which included eight detailed and specific recommendations in the areas of staff salaries, benefits, performance evaluations, training, performance
evaluations, recruitment, policy and strategic planning.
These recommendations were approved by the Board of
Managers in May of 1999.
In its own overwhelmingly positive report submitted
to the college last spring, the Middle States evaluation
team noted staff concerns and recommended "that
Swarthmore take care to address signals and symbols
that may be conveying a message of inferiority to its
staff."
One of these "signals" is wages, which became a major focus of the PSG Accreditation Self-Study Report and
remain a source of contention among staff. Many employees interviewed felt that they earned less than those
in similar positions at other businesses and institutions.
"We're underpaid," one employee stated

the widespread perception among staff that faculty salary spending is substantially higher than staff salary
spending. On the contrary, said Aslanian, the total staff
salary budget is larger than the total faculty salary budget.
But Swarthmore's staff salary expenditures remain
below those of many schools belonging to the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE), according to a May 1997 COFHE report. The report showed that,
at 1.15-to-l, the ratio of Swarthmore's non-faculty salary
budget to its faculty salary budget lagged behind the
ratios of all 17 schools in the study with the exception of
one. The ratios ranged from a low of 1.07-to-l to a high of
2.01-to-l, with a mean of 1.5-to-l.
The Accreditation Self-Study hypothesized that
Swarthmore's comparatively low spending ratio might
result from its deliberate efforts to maintain a low faculty to student ratio. "Swarthmore may deliberately
weight its human resources cost more heavily toward
faculty than toward staff, in order to fulfill its mission
of providing an exceptional student academic experience," said the Self-Study.
Swarthmore was in the middle of all COFHE schools

flatly.
In recent years the college has taken action
to investigate and correct this problem.
Spurred by the findings of the 1989 Middle
States evaluation team, the college analyzed
its salary structure and found average staff
salaries below the FMR. The college has since
adjusted its salary compensation to 100 percent of the FMR, according to Vice President
for Finance and Planning Paul Aslanian.
This strategy of setting compensation at 100
percent of FMR means that the college is paying employees at the 50th percentile of market wages. In other words, half of the employees in the general market earn more and half earn less when staff salary budgets were compared to student
enrollment size.

Part One: Staff Wages
prise. It's not consistent with the Swarthmore's values
of equity to have second-class citizens... From a market
standpoint, [this policy] says we value faculty comparatively more highly than we value staff."
Aslanian admitted that he also feels uncomfortable
with this double standard. "I don't like the numbers; I
want the numbers to be the same," said Aslanian. "The
issue of 100 percent for staff and 102 percent for faculty
is one I'd like to see us question."
Both Aslanian and Westphal stressed, however, that
the matter is not as straightforward as it may seem. The
market for staff involves many different types of jobs,
both in public and private industry, whereas the market
for faculty consists solely of institutions like Swarthmore
employing professors with relatively similar job descriptions. Consequently, it is much more difficult to compare
staffsalaries to a market average than it is to do the same
with faculty salaries.
Compensating differentials, or non-monetary remuneration such as benefits or job security, further complicate the effort to compare salaries across public and
private industry, according to Westphal.
Indeed, Aslanian stated that Swarthmore has an "inordinately good" fringe benefits package for all staff working at least three-quarters time.
Medical benefits total $4600, of which $2400 cover individual health insurance and $2200 comprise a benefits
bank that employees may take in the form of cash, according to Aslanian. He pointed out that total cash from
the benefits bank translates to an additional dollar per
hour above employees' standard salary compensation.
If this were taken into account when comparing employees' wages to the market average, it would drive staff
pay up above 100 percent of the FMR.
Moreover, the college's recent revamping of its retirement plan, available to all employees working at least
half time, has resulted in better benefits for employees
in lower salary ranges.
This fall, the Faculty and Staff Benefits Committee
increased the amount of money available for staff training and education. Funds were also allocated for graduate work, which previously did not receive support from
the college.
Virtually all of the staff members interviewed were
pleased with their benefits. An overwhelming majority
of those surveyed by SAC "agreed" or "strongly agreed"
that medical, retirement, vacation, sick and holiday ben-

The issue of how the college should define the market
for staff also requires consideration, said psychology
professor Barry Schwartz. "While faculty and senior
administrators are recruited nationally and paid based
on ongoing comparison of similar institutions across the
country, staff are recruited locally," explained Schwartz.
"Should we just be using the average wage for various
jobs in the local labor market to set our standards or
something else?"
Some staff members wonder whether Swarthmore's
salary compensation is high enough to attract exceptional
employees and keep them at the college.
"It is becoming ever-increasingly difficult to recruit
and retain knowledgeable staff," stated a staff member
who has had supervisory experience.
The findings of the Self-Study provide support for this
perception. "Swarthmore's current staff compensation
strategy appears insufficient to attract the quality of
workforce it may need to sustain excellence," the study
said.
Aslanian is certain that Swarthmore's compensation
strategy in no way prevents it from filling its staff positions with highly qualified workers. "In some areas we
might have to recruit really hard to be successful and it
might be easier if we paid slightly higher salaries," he
said. "But I don't believe for a moment that our compensation goal has prevented us from attracting very successful and talented staff."
Nevertheless, most of the staff interviewed felt that
they should be paid a living wage.
"Swarthmore has a moral obligation to pay people a
salary they can actually live on," said one employee.
The lowest hourly self-sufficiency wage in Delaware
County in 1998 was $7.33 for one adult, according to a
1999 study prepared by Diana Pearce, Ph.D and Jennifer Brooks for the Women's Association for Women's Alternatives. This wage is above the minimum in several
pay grades in Swarthmore's salary structure,and above
the FMR in one pay grade.
Westphal, who cited the problematic nature of measuring need, does not agree that the college must pay
the self-sufficiency wage. "I don't have a lot of patience
with the notion that we should pay people outside of what
is available in the marketplace," he said. "I think it's more
reasonable to make sure that to the degree we can pay
equitably, we're doing it."
According to staff, however, inequities exist not only

efits were "basically good" compared to those offered
by other employers.
Westphal questioned the accuracy of the 100 percent
figure, suggesting that the college may compensate some
of its staff above this standard when other factors are
taken into account. One problem is that the college has
not gathered sufficient evidence to make an informed
conclusion about its staff salaries relative to the market.
"It's not clear that the story is being told the way it
should from the college's perspective," asserted
Westphal, who also emphasized the difficulty of obtaining the necessary data and the heavy investment it would
require from a small school like Swarthmore. But, he
added,".. .1 don't think that the college has takenthe time

various "compensable factors" such as experience, education, and the difficulty level of the work. These points
are then grouped into various pay grades under several
job classifications.
Most of the staff interviewed had little confidence in a
pay structure that they frequently deemed "arbitrary"
and "unfair."
"There's no consistent salary review process," said
Hegg. "This is something the staff have asked for again
and again."
For instance, Kawlaic and Thompson Bradley, professor and chair of the modern languages department, believe that the college should publish the highest wage in
each staff pay grade.
Aslanian explained that disclosing an individual's sal-

ary goes against

college policy. Moreover, this information might be "constraining" for supervisors who want
to pay an employee above the highest wage.
Another problem is that the pay scale does not consistently reward employees for long-term service to the
college, according to a number of staff.
"You never have the feeling that you'll goup the scale,"
said Kawlaic. "There's no incentive for longevity."
Many of the staff interviewed shared Kawlaic's frustration. Some claimed that newly hired staff receive
higher wages than those of longtime employees.
"A bad signal is sent to existing staff that have been
here when a new hire is brought in at or above what current people are paid," said one employee. He said he knew
personally of instances when employees with seven or
eight years of experience found themselves earning the
same wages as someone who had just been hired.
Another employee put it more bluntly. "Seniority
doesn't mean squat," she said.
The SAC survey showed employees approximately
evenly divided on the issue of whether they were paid
fairly "relative to other employees in their work unit."
Aslanian was sympathetic to these concerns. "We're
aware of the situation, and we try to avoid it," he said.
"It's bad human resources policy, the practice of bringing in someone and paying them more than a loyal, hardworking employee."
Nevertheless, Aslanian made the distinction between
a "rookie" employee and one with prior experience.
Sometimes a new employee who has worked in a related
job outside Swarthmore might be paid more than someone who has worked longer for the college but has less
total work experience, said Aslanian.
Not only longevity, but job performance as well, has
little connection to pay, said several employees. The SAC
survey showed that nearly 80 percent of respondents
supported some form of merit-based pay.
But performance cannot be linked to pay until the college institutes standard job evaluations, which it currently
lacks. The Self-Study reported that the college has no uniform system of evaluating employees. Although the Human Resources Department did develop evaluations, they
were not suitable for all departments. The Self-Study
stated that "some departments have designed their own
forms; others write narratives; many do nothing at all."
Although a majority of those interviewed reported
receiving some form of evaluation, one staff member
who deemed evaluations "a necessity"
said he has not
been evaluated in two years. Another employee said she
has never received a job evaluation.
An administrative staff member expressed hope that
the situation would change. "Hopefully the Human Resources Director will pick up where Barbara Carroll
[former director of Human Resources] left off and institute a job performance evaluation," he said.
But that process will entail expense and careful planning, said Westphal. "It could be worse than nothing if
done wrongly," he warned. "The question is, how does a
small school deal with formalism without getting bogged
down?"
This is a question that the college may have to consider in
the near future. The Self-Study has recommended that the
college more closely link performance to compensation.
Meanwhile, most staff and faculty agreed that the college has made progress in addressing the pay issue,
though more slowly than they would have liked.
"There's been more support in the last year but I
haven't seen results," said one employee, who acknowledged that the college may not have had time to act on
its recommendations.
"Wages are lower than they should be, and while the
college has been moving consistently to fix this problem, I don't think it has been moving as fast as it should,"
said Schwartz, who also mentioned the complicating factors involved in the process.
There is still a lot more work to do, said another employee. "The college has addressed the compensation
issue and made some strides, but in my opinion, the college should not feel as though [it's] finished."

Garnet loses to Gettysburg, 72-52
By Ben Park
Phoenix Staff
In 1903, Swarthmore became
one of the first colleges to adopt
the sport of basketball. In 1918,
Haverford followed suit. In 1920,
the two teams met for the first
time, beginning what would become one of the most heated rivalries in Division 111 basketball:
137 games in 80 years. Last
Wednesday, the Garnet defeated
the Fords in the Alumni Field
House at Haverford, 65-58, to
win for the 83rd time.
Both
Haverford
and
Swarthmore have been having
difficult seasons, and, at the time
of the game, both had won only
one Centennial Conference
game. Haverford had managed
to win a total of three games all
season, and Swarthmore had
pulled out two. However, when
the opening tip was tossed,
records were forgotten and only
one thing remained: arch rivals.
The Garnet fell behind 6-0 in
the first three minutes, but tough
defense on the part ofboth teams
and poor shooting by Haverford
earned Swarthmore a 12-12 tie
with 8:17 left in the half.
Haverford promptly reeled off a
10-3 run over the next four minutes, capped by a three pointer
from
senior guard Tim

2-5 in the conference, and 3-14
overall. The few bright spots of
the Gettysburg loss included the
large audience (450 people), and
the chance to see the future of
the team get some minutes together. Sophomore guard Mike
Jefferies scored six points in
three minutes to keep the margin within 20.

on Sunday she was absolutely
repulsive. It wasn't her commentary, on-field reporting or interviews that turned my stomach,

of the evening belonged to none
other than the WWF. The idea of
Miss Congeniality dropping the

The convalescent home version was even better. Any commercial that includes a flying

gets my stamp of approval. Unfortunately, ABC does not feel

The Pro Bowl is coming up,
that's always an exciting game

It is ironic that Dyson, the "Music City Miracle" hero, was the
one stopped at the goal line. The
amazing kickoff return in the
Wild Card game against the Bills
defied all odds. First, the Titans
had never run that play all season. When they ran it in practice,
the play was designed to go to
wide receiver Isaac Byrd. Byrd
could not play because of an
ankle injury, nor could his
backup, wide receiver Derrick
Mason, who sustained a concussion during the game. Dyson had
never practiced the play before,
but the coaches pulled him aside
and quickly explained it as the
return team took the field. Despite never having run the play
before, Dyson and the Titans ran
it perfectly (or illegally, if you're
a Bills fan).
Now, fast forward to the final
play of the Super Bowl. Dyson,
who practiced that play every
day, who ran that very same slant
pattern countless times all season and who relied on the receiver/linebacker match-up to
make big plays in every game,
could not deliver a second time
with the season on the line. I'm
not trying to take anything away
from what Dyson or the Titans
did to get to within one yard of a
championship, but just because
a guy comes through in the clutch
in one big game does not mean
he's absolved from choking in the
next big game.
As difficult as it is to take the
focus off the final play of the
1999-2000NFL season, the Super
Bowl provides us with much
more than just a game. In fact,
the game itselfoften takes a back
seat to the commercials, halftime

guests. I would hardly say that
this Super Bowl was overshadowed by these extras, but the

deserves mention as well.

Lloyd leads strong women's distance group
By Marc Jeuland
and Donald Nguyen
Phoenix Staff
The women's distance team
has emerged strong this season,
due largely to the leadership and
hard work of its senior captain,
Karen Lloyd.
Coming from Beaufort, NC,
Lloyd will have participated in 10
seasons of track and cross country at Swarthmore by the end of
this year.
Success hasn't always come
easily to Lloyd. She was largely
ignored by coaches her freshman
year. "[Coach] Ted Dixon was
worried that I couldn't keep up
with team," Lloyd explains. "He
designed special workouts for me
and a few others since we could
not keep up. We were slower, and
as we improved, we had to change
the workouts ourselves, rather
than the coach doing so."
Since that time, Karen has
risen to become one of the top
distance women, but she still
feels she has not fully emerged.
"I have a long way to go to get
want I want out of this. The one
thing I have done that I'm proud
of was to score in the 5000
[meters last] year in the outdoor
conference meet," says Llloyd.
She clearly recalls that race as
her best ever, especially because
four other women were seeded
around her, and she still managed
to finish ahead of themall and in
fifth place overall.
Still, like any runner, the road
to success has not been entirely

smooth. In cross country this
year, Lloyd went from one of the
most feared runners in the conference to a virtual non-factor
after donating blood and later
catching bronchitis. But "personal performance is not the
most important," she says, emphasizing team spirit.
One teammate, Eileen Estes
'O2, points to Lloyd's leadership
as her greatest contribution.
"She's the one you go to when you
are unsure about something;
she's the last word," says Estes.
"She keeps in touch with the
coach and keeps the team in
touch with what's going on."
But it is not a one way street,
says Lloyd. "My fellow runners

give me
attitude; Joko
[Agunloye]'s walks help me." Often times in practice or after
races, "Joko and 1... go for walks,
and she fixes me."
In addition, the role of captain
helps her with working harder
and gives her a more upbeat attitude. "I have to help motivate the
other runners," she explains.
Lloyd's main goals for this year
are to place higher than last year
in the 5000 meters, but also to see
everyone be satisfied with at
least one race they have.
As for seeing Lloyd after
graduation, she plans to race at
alumni meets. "If I can get here,"
she quips, "I'll be holding up the
back of the pack."

The Swarthmore track and
field team headed to Connecticut this past weekend for competition in the Wesleyan Invitational on Friday night. While
the group is not accustomed to
performing in the evening,
there were nonetheless some
very notable results. The
women placed highly in
jumps, distance events and
throws, and finished seventh
out of 14 overall.
Desiree Peterkin 'OO won
the triple jump with an NCAA
provisional mark and finished
second in the long jump. Sarah Jay 'Ol was second in the
800-meters and third in the
1500; Joko Agunloye 'Ol fin-'
ished fifth in the 3000. In addition, Raylene Ross 'OO contributed with a sixth-place finish in the long jump.
On the men's side, Keith
Gilmore 'Ol took fourth in the
400 and Marc Jeuland 'Ol was
third in both the 1500 and the
3000. Rounding out the scoring
for the squad was a sixth-place
finish for the 4x400 relay.

Women's latest victims: Haverford and Gettysburg
By Christina Ciambriello
and Caitlin Ryland
Phoenix Staff
The Swarthmore women's basketball team has been lighting it
up of late. The women are sitting
on top of the league and are looking at a possible berth in the Centennial Conference playoffs for
the first time in the school's history. These lady bailers are a

must-see act as they continue to

dominate their opponents. Their
latest victims, Haverford and
Gettysburg, lost by margins of
66-48 and 55-53, respectively, in
this week's action. Excitement
builds in the women's program as
the Swat version of March madness approaches with full speed.
Despite the heated rivalry between Swarthmore and the
Haverford "Fords," the match-up

proved to be no contest. The Swat
women crushed Haverford in
their first meeting of the season
with a well-rounded team effort.
It was a good win for the Garnet
as they recuperated from a recent massacre at the hands of
Muhlenburg. Leading the attack
against the Fords was Sarah
Tufano 'O3, who had an amazing
overall game which included a
spectacular first half. After 20
minutes, it was Tufano, 16points,
Haverford 25. She finished the
game with a huge 25 points and 9
rebounds. Fine performances
were also added by the "Heathers," with Heather Kile 'O2 adding 16 points and 8 boards and
Heather Marandola 'Ol contributing a solid 9 points and 6 rebounds of her own. It was a great
40 minutes of basketball for the
Garnet. Without much rivalry
from the Fords, Swat looked elsewhere for a real challenge.
While the girls at Haverford
were looking for their game, the
Swarthmore women continued to
take care of business in the Centennial Conference. The next opponent Swarthmore dealt with
was the Bullets of Gettysburg.
While they came out firing, the
"Bullets" only managed to graze

Badminton easily rolls over local rival; women face Albright this evening
Phoenix Staff

The visiting coach at Monday's
home badminton meet against
Bryn Athyn gave the briefest of
pep talks to her players. "Get
pumped," she cheered them on.
"Pump yourselves up."
Fortunately for Swarthmore,
adrenaline was Bryn Athyn's
only strength. Swarthmore
womanhandled the meager
squad from northeast Philadelphia and won in its first matchof
the season.
Monday's meet, which was
postponed for six days because
of last week's surprise snowstorm, was lopsided from the
start. Siobhan Carty 'Ol pummeled Sarah Rose in a two-set
shutout (11-0,11-0) to win the second singles slot, and Karen Lange
'O2 (third singles) handed Sarah
Qardam an embarrassing 11-2,
11-0 drubbing.
Because Bryn Athyn onlydressed six players, Rose was
forced to play a second match in
first singles against Jane Ng 'Ol.
Ng's shot placement and racquet
strength were superior to Rose's,

of their lives.
but a series of mistakes, including five straight bad serves, almost cost Ng the match. It was
only in the final points that Ng's
game returned to form, as she
warded off her opponent, 11-4,
11-8.
Swarthmore's doubles squads
featured a host of new players,
some of whom were playing the
first competitive badminton
match of their lives. In first
doubles, Deirdre Conner 'O3 and
Olga Rostapshova 'O2 took on
Adriane Junge and Rachel King.
The women split the first two
sets, 15-10,10-15, before Conner
and Rostapshova pulled away in
the third, 15-4. The two Garnet
players sported better funda-

mentals in shot selection and
placement; in fact, the opponents
would often serve illegally without either side realizing it. Junge
and King kept the match close
with better court coverage and
some smart shots to their
opponent's corners, but their inability to play solid badminton
showed in the end.
Swarthmore only dropped one
match out of five on Monday, as
the novice team ofNellie Tong 'O2
and Maya Shanbhag 'OO lost in
their first match ever to Wendy
Cole and Jessica Howard, 7-15,115.
Badminton coach Dan Sears
was happy with the win, but he
expressed concern over a lack of
singles players. Xiang Lan Zhuo
'Ol, who would have filled the
second singles spot, is abroad this
semester, forcing Sears to break
up the first doubles pair of Lange
and Carty. This creates a strong
lineup of singles players but
leaves the doubles slots more
vulnerable to defeat.
The team will test its 1-0record
and its new lineup today against
undefeated Albright in an away
meet.

ter on the women's basketball

team, has made her presencefelt
throughout the Centennial Conference. She is a quiet but powerful force on the team and has
helped lead the Garnet to one of
their best seasons in college history. Tufano's contributions to
this team extend far beyond her
sensational balling skills. When
Tufano steps on the court, she
exudes confidence. This freshman has come into the program
with impressive authority and
confidence and, most importantly, has meshed well with the
rest of the talented squad.
Tufano is ail business come
game time, andknows how to get
the job done. More than this, however, is the 6'o" Tufano's ability
to effectively combine this drive
for success with a refreshing attitude on and off the court and
quiet, heartfelt words of encouragement for her teammates.
Head Coach Adrienne Shibles
touched on the great dimension
that Tufano adds to the team. According to Shibles, Tufano brings
"a much-needed presence on the
court, solid inside and out, and always calm, cool, and collected."
Tufano has a selfless demeanor
that reflects her focus on winning. When asked to talk to about
what she saw as her personal role
on the team, Tufano responded
"to be active on the boards, look
for my jumper on the outside to
open things up for Heather Kile
on the inside."
She knows what she needs to
do and goes out and does it on a
consistent basis. This year she
has been Swarthmore's second
leading scorer and rebounder,
averaging 11.6points a gameand
5.7 boards. For her accomplishments, she earned Centennial
Conference Player of the Week
honors for this week.
For someone only one year out
of Cromwell High in Connecticut,
where she was asked to play
multiple positions, Tufano has
very refined skills, especially for
a tall player. This makes her
presence on the court all the
more dynamic.
In addition to her numerous
achievements on the basketball
court during her short career at
Swarthmore, Tufano excels in the
classroom. She was valedictorian
of her high school class and has
a tremendous work ethic.
One area where her focus and
commitmenthavebeen on display
has been at the foul line, where
Tufano is shooting a sparkling 81.2
percent. Such a percentage is
nearly unheard of for a power
player in the collegiate ranks.
All in all, Sarah is a go-to player
whoher teammates look for down
the stretch as they finish off the
season strong. The team will continue to turn to Tufano as the
Swarthmore women build their
program, for which Sarah has so
elegantly laid the groundwork.

Swimmers fight hard despite loss
By Becca Howes-Mischel
Phoenix Staff
The swim team finished their
last two home meets with a win
and a loss, but two amazing
meets. The week started with the
women's meet against Bryn
Mawr. The men's cheer said it
all: "R-E-L-A-X." This meet was
no sweat, with the women easily
winning 129-65.
But relaxation was the last
thing on either the men's or
women's team going into
Saturday's meet against the conference champion team of
Gettysburg college. Gettysburg
has won 46 straight conference
dual meets and every single conference championship since the
conference was founded in 1992.
But this year the Garnet team
had a chance to challenge this
winning streak.
At first glance it looked like
only the women could go headto-head withthe Bullets; the men
lacked one necessary freestyler.
However, men's captain Ted
Sherer 'Ol and Freshman Mike
Dudley 'O3 sat down with coach
Sue Davis to form a lineup in
which our nine men could beat
Gettysburg's squad. Comparing
Swarthmore's and Gettysburg's
top times of the season it was
uncanny in the manner in which
they matched up. This meet
would come down fractions of a
second.
And it did. The swimmers
walked into a Ware pool decorated with signs and bannerspronouncing Swarthmore's team
"Bulletproof and "Faster than a
Speeding Bullet." The stands
were packed with cheering fans
for both teams and the energy
was high as one team tried to
make history and the other defend their title. In the end,
Gettysburg's reach was longer,

but both teams dropped significant time as races were decided
by hundredths of seconds.
Gettysburg's superior depth beat
out Swarthmore's speed but this
was an amazing meet. The
women lost in the last two races
118-87 and the men in the end
pulled off 107-93.
It is impossible to honor one or
two swimmers for this meet because everyone stepped up and
dropped places and time. After
the meet Coach Leshia Schaffer
told the team how honored she
was to work with them saying,
"You guys went out there and
never gave up, I have never been
so proud of a team."
For both the men and women
winning the meet hinged on winning the first relay, the 400-medley, and both did. The women's
team of Becca Howes-Mischel
'Ol, Natalie Briones 'O3, Alice
Bonarou 'O2, and Claire Arbour
'OO continued their undefeated
streak and smashed the pool
record with a 4:05.95, beating
Gettysburg by 5 seconds! The
men's team of Brent Wasser 'OO,
Sherer, DavidWhitehead 'O3, and
John Lillvis 'O3 soon followed
suit, shaking off Gettysburg's

team.

The superior swims did not

swimmers wanted to win, this
was not a meet in which any of
the swimmers could be disappointed. As this was the seniors'
last home meet ever, it was important to go out on this kind of
high note. Afterwards, teammates stressed how much they

John Wayne Bobbitt and Garth Brooks
have something in common: the lack of
any tool whatsoever. Brooks, who will play
baseball this spring with the Mets, hit a
I remarkable .045 last season in preseason
play with the Padres.
According to Phoenix columnist Scott
Kushner 'O2, who is also the lead off hitter
on the baseball team, "A five toolplayer is
a guy who can hit for power and average,
runs well, fields and has a good arm."
After watching one at-bat during his
spring training stint last season, one thing
became evident to me about country

none to speak of. Nevertheless, here is a
scouting report from watching Brooks
play twice last spring while training with
the Padres.

To Brooks' credit, he works hard. He's

Brooks at their spring training site. He'll
play for the Mets this spring and has declined invitations from the Braves and

Sex games: Two ways to score
By Scott Kushner
Phoenix Staff
It's the night before the big game.
You've practiced hard all week, studied
the game film and even contorted yourself into a human pretzel with yoga positions designed to help you envision yourself coming through in the clutch. All you
need now is a good way to unwind, get a
good rest and get you ready for tomorrow.
What doyou do? Do you a) watch Jay Leno
until you fall asleep? b) pretend you're
sick and check into the health center because your hall is too loud to sleep in? or
c) pick up some drunk person from the
Olde Club party, take her back to your
room, dothe horizontalhula-hoop and pass
out with a smile on your face? If you
choose option "c," are you putting yourself at risk for a poor performance the
next day?
Believe it or not, studies have been done
to see whether a pre-game roll in the hay
helps or hinders your athletic performance. In late November of last year, researchers at the University of L'Aquila in
Italy released their findings on whether
sex ads or detracts from a man's athletic
ability. The idea that the hormone testosterone increases a person's aggressiveness leads to the assumption that increased testosterone will produce a more
aggressive (and therefore better) athlete.
Prior to this research, the commonly held
theory was thac sexual activity drained the
body of testosterone. It was believed that
therelease of seminal fluid would cause a
drop in testosterone and therefore a drop

in aggression.

Thus, in the hopes of "storing up" as
much testosterone as possible, manyprofessional athletes would abstain from sex
for days, weeks, and sometimes even
months before an important event. Imagine the frustration of abstaining from sex

for a couple of months only to have a wet
dream the night before the big game.
One athlete who always saved up some
extra tadpoles for a game was Johii Elway.
