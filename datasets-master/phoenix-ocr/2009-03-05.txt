Part of the board member's impetus
for implementing reforms over the past
year and a half has been its goal of shedding a negative reputation. "When I was
a freshman, the WRC had the reputation
of being a white heteronormative
group," Caspar said. Further, the WRC
has been seen as a community of little
action, Kopansky said. The Center has
also previously been seen as an exclusive
place that is only used by Women's
Resource Center Board members and
members of the immediate WRC community, rather than being open to the stu-

dent body as a whole.
But the WRC at Swarthmore continues its efforts to shed that image.
"While the WRC has had a really
problematic history, the new direction
where we are heading is really focused
on listening to women of all backgrounds, not just race, but class, sexual
orientation, ability, nationality, however
you identify or where you come from, to
form new goals and a new identity for
the WRC that is inclusive and productive," Kopansky said.
Open Hours at the Women's Resource
Center are Monday through Thursday,

Access center broadens educational opportunities
BY SARAH POZGAY

slong6@swarthmore.edu

The College Access Center
of Delaware County, which
opened this semester
in
Chester, has just completed its
first month of service to community
members seeking
information about postsecondary educational opportunities. The center is the first initiative of the recently formed
Chester Council of Higher
Education, a non-profit consortium of six area colleges and
including
universities,
Swarthmore.
center
provides
The
Delaware
County students
with services ranging from
tutoring in ACT and SAT

preparation to assistance with
the financial aid application
process to workshops on writing college essays. It also offers
services to adults or students
seeking any type of postsecondary education.

THE PHOENIX

The idea for the center is certainly not new. It has been in

the works for a few years now
but is finally coming to
fruition through the colleges'
collaboration, according to
Cynthia Jetter '74, Director of
Community Partnerships at the
Lang
Center and liaison
between the access center and
the council. "I'm so proud of
[the college presidents'] ability
to actually come together and
form this entity, which they've
now incorporated into a nonprofit, that allows us to work
together and go after funding
and do so many more things
than we could do individually,"

Jetter said.
Jetter, who has been the
driving force behind the center, explained that resources
already in place at the colleges
from previous mentorship programs provide the center with

a good base from which to
build. "I just couldn't imagine
all that information, all that

knowledge and processing and
understanding and training,

to waste," Jetter said.
"This is the place we can put
all that and still provide a
much needed service to the
gone

community."
These resources, combined

with the demonstrated educational needs of the Chester
community
and Delaware
County more largely, helped
convince the council to take
the center as its first project.
"This just seemed like a good,
quick, easy fit," Jetter said.
According to Jetter, support
from the Swarthmore College
community for such a project
has been enthusiastic and longstanding. "Every year we have
freshmen coming in here wanting to start a program like this
based on their experience," she
said. One such student, Sarah
Ting 'lO, is now Student
Volunteer Coordinator for the
center, organizing volunteer
scheduling and outreach beginMarch 5, 2009

with Swarthmore students and eventually extending
to student volunteers from
other institutions.
Ting first became interested
in creating a project like the
access center as a result of her
experiences tutoring elementary
school children in
Chester.
"A lot of students didn't
have a real sense of where
their education was taking
them," Ting said, expressing
the hope that the center will
help to make college a more
realistic goal for such students.
Swarthmore has replied
enthusiastically to calls for
center volunteers, according to
Ting. "I was really surprised
and excited that we had so
many people respond. It just
shows how much people think
this center is really necessary," she said. Ting has heard
from over 20 applicants since
the beginning of the semester.
The necessity of the center
ning

is especially apparent to Jetter,
who has first-hand experience
having grown up in Chester.
"The number of young people
from the city of Chester that go
on to college is lower than in
our surrounding districts
significantly lower," Jetter
said, citing lack of information
and wherewithal as two of the
factors behind this. "A lot of
folks in low income will just
get stuck, and then the next
crisis in their family comes up,
and this [plans for college] has
to get put to the side," she said.
One of the main goals
behind the center is to provide
informational support and
guidance for families like
these. "It's a great opportunity
for people to have access to
resources and information.
That's big when it comes to college accessibility," said Erica
Hawthorne, Program Assistant
for the center.

Money from the endowment will
continue to fund much of the college's
spending next year, but the reduction
of the endowment's value in recent
months has forced the school to
spend a greater percentage of the
fund than usual. In 2009-10, a little
less than 6 percent of the endowment's value will go to the college's
expenses,
according to Welsh's
release.
According to Mark Kuperberg,
Professor of Economics, the percent
of the endowment the college spends
every year is subject to change, but
the school usually tries to spend within a range of percentages, the high
end of which is about 4.75 percent. In
recent years, Swarthmore has spent
at the low end of this range, which is
around 3.5 percent. While this

Mark Kuperberg
Economics Professor

At the Feb. 21
meeting of the
Board,
four
important decisions were made
regarding
the
budget for the
upcoming school
year. First, student charges (the sum
of tuition, room, board and the student activities fee) will increase by
3.76 percent next year, which is, by
percentage, the smallest increase in
10 years. According to Welsh, the college was "trying to be responsive to
the economy and its impact on families." In recent times, student fees
have usually increased by about 4.5
to 5.5 percentage points each year.
Secondly, the Board renewed its
commitment to loan-free financial aid
awards and decided to hold, the suggested summer earnings and termtime work components of financial
aid awards constant.
In a move that has been affected by
economic circumstances but is also
in line with one of the college's long
held policies, a third decision was
made to increase on-campus enrollment next year by 16 students, with
another jump in enrollment expected
in the near future. "Swarthmore's
enrollment has historically grown at
a slow measured pace, primarily to.
enlarge the curriculum offerings,"
Welsh said.
The average on-campus enrollment has increased steadily for several decades, and is now approximately 26 percent larger than it was
in 1970. While the increase in enrollment is consistent with the college's
history, economic conditions provided additional impetus for the decision. According to Welsh, because the
college has excess room in its residence halls, the enrollment growth
"leads to a growth in revenue without
increasing much additional costs."
In another cost-conscious move,
the Board made a fourth decision to
reduce spending on facilities projects
by more than $5 million next year,
totaling about $3.3 million.

conservative, but we were also conventional," he said. "We were falsely

Managers are salary decisions and

departmental budgets. According to

Welsh's release, "Salary freezes for
faculty and staff are under strong
consideration. No employee lay-offs
are anticipated at this time for the
2009-2010 fiscal year." However, when
asked about the possibility of lay-offs
in 2011 and beyond, Welsh said that
"if the economy continues to deteriorate, nothing can be ruled out for the
future."
According
to
Constance
Hungerford, provost, the college's
budget will not show dramatic cuts
for the upcoming school year.
However, it could show much graver
changes for the year after that if the
economic climate does not improve.
According to Welsh, the college does
not want to make any drastic moves
that are not necessary. "We're trying
to take a measured approach in our
response to the economy," Welsh
said.
While this means that the college's
operations shouldn't be drastically
different next year, changes might be
on the way. "I think there will be
changes that will be noticeable [to
students]," Kuperberg said, pointing
to the joint challenges of the recession, which hurts the ability of parents to pay tuition and alums to give
money to the school, and the stock
market crash, which has devalued
the endowment.
"The college has been around
since 1864, and it'll stay around, but I
do think we'll have to change how we
do things," Kuperberg said. "We were
living high on the hog."

Next Lang visiting professor to focus on bilingualism
BY DANTE FUOCO

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

Ana Celia Zentella, Professor Emeritus of Ethnic
Studies at U.C. San Diego, was named next year's Lang
Visiting Professor for Issues of Social Change. A distinguished linguist, Zentella specializes in bilingualism and
is one of the foremost scholars of what she has named
"anthro-political linguistics," an area of linguistics that
studies the issues people are confronted with when making choices about language.
Zentella will be teaching a class in the fall of 2009 that,
she said in an e-mail, will be about language, race and
ethnic identity, "highlight[ing] the issues raised by the
linguistic heritage of the USA, and its increasing linguistic diversity." In the spring she will be teaching a seminar either on how Spanish and English interact, delving
into recent debates about Spanglish, or possibly on "loss
and revitalization in bilingual communities" because of
her recent book about San Diego multilingualism.
Zentella acknowledges that the move won't be easy.
She will have to finish her sociolinguistic ethnography
research at a high school on the border with Mexico, take
a leave from some committees and boards, and communicate long-distance with students who are finishing
M.A. theses and Ph.D. dissertations.
Leaving San Diego won't be easy, either.
"It took a lot to get me to leave the warm beaches and
good Mexican food in my San Diego neighborhood," she
said. "But Swarthmore's history ofcommitment to issues
of social justice is important."
She mentioned how her friend'sfather was accepted to
Swarthmore when he fled Germany during WWII and
also how her friends in the Peacemakers 'always spoke
highly of [Swarthmore's] archives."
"When I was approached about the Lang professorship, my first question concerned the diversity of the student body, and I was happy to learn that Swarthmore has

been very successful attracting African-American students and students of working-class backgrounds—much
more so than UCSD," she said. "It is always a personal joy
to teach students Who remind me of me when I was
young."
In realizing that students here are also interested in
her anthro-political linguistics, Zentella said that she's
"anxious to find students who will help me with several
i
research projects."
Linguistics Professor Donna Jo Napoli said that she
"would love to see a volume of work by Swarthmore students edited by Ana Celia I would urge anyone interested to take advantage of the fact she'll be here."
Napoli was the Swarthmore faculty member who
nominated Zentella for the position.
"Ana Celia is one of the most energetic scholars I
know, with a passionate commitment to the communities she studies," said Napoli. "She recognizes the
moral and ethical responsibilities that studying an
oppressed minority brings
and accepts those responsibilities eagerly. She is herself Puerto Rican, from a
borough of New York City, and she knows the journey
personally."
Although Napoli nominated Zentella, the sociology/anthropology and education departments also
...

endorsed it.
"She asks what the social issues are facing such people because of their language choices/inheritance,"
Napoli said in an e-mail. "Some of these choices involve
education, medical care, access to housing and civil
rights in general. She has pointed out the existence and
dangers of linguistic profiling."
Zentella is also one of the leading voices on bilingual
education in America, arguing strongly against
English-only movements. Her book "Growing Up
Bilingual: Puerto Rican children in New York" won the
Book Prize of the British Association of Applied
Linguistics, and the Book Award of the Association of

Latina and Latino Anthropologists of the American
Anthropology Association.
Napoli's current class, Oral and Written Language,
which is cross-listed with education, has focused on some
of Zentella's ideas while studying bilingual texts for early
readers. While studying Spanglish, Associate Professor
K. David Harrison's first-year-seminar Linguistic
Underpinnings of Racism and Bias read a chapter from
her aforementioned book. In it, Zentella explores why
bilingual children in New York City intricately switch
between Spanish and English. Harrison said in an e-mail
that Zentella has "done probably the most thorough study
of New York Spanglish and has demonstrated that it is a
complex, unique language that also constructs a unique
identity for its speakers."
Zentella's knowledge of Harrison's seminar played a
part in accepting the professorship, she said. "When I see
that linguistics is offering a course on the linguistic
underpinnings of racism, I figure that's the place for me."
Aurin Agramonte 'l2, who is from the Bronx, New
York, said that she was unsure how she felt about her
own use of Spanglish speaking just Spanish to her parents but often English to other people in the community
before reading Zentella in Harrison's seminar.
"I was at a point where I felt bad that I only spoke
Spanglish," she said. "I never really understood how I
used it
I felt like I was betraying my heritage." But
after reading Zentella's analysis of Spanglish's complexity, Agramonte said that she has become "less self-conscious," realizing that Spanglish is both complex and
inclusive. "[Zentella's work] validated the fact that
Spanglish is in a sense a language," said Agramonte.
"We've established a new way of speaking to each other
...We are able to include the whole community."
Agramonte said that she is definitely interested in
meeting with Zentella to further discuss her research.
Agramonte added that she looks forward to possibly
enrolling in one of Zentella's classes.

Haverford dorm falls victim to graffiti, vandalism
BY ALEX ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edu

Over the course of this year, a
Haverford first year residence hall has
seen five acts of serious vandalism,
including four that involved human fecal
matter. On four occasions in the fall
semester, residents of Gummere Hall, one
of three first year dorms at Haverford,
were confronted with fecal matter displayed in public locations. On Jan. 23,
2009, the basement's bathroom Was the
location of a race related tagging.
Though rumors swirled thatDNA testing might be used to identify the origins
of the feces, Haverford is not contemplating any kind offorensic test.
The first incident occurred in midSeptember, when residents discovered
human excrement smeared on the sofa,
coffee table and television in the
Gummerebasement lounge. According to
the Bi-College News, the furniture was
initially left undisturbed, in hopes of forcing the perpetrator to come forward, but
was later removed by Housekeeping
Services for health reasons.
According to an email sent to the
Haverford community by Marianne
Smith, Director of Student Housing, the
items removed from the basement "will
not be replaced until the person or persons come forward to accept responsibility for their actions."
On Nov. 15, feces was discovered
smeared across stalls and mirrors in a
Gummere bathroom. A little more than
three weeks later, on Dec. 9, feces was
again, discovered in a bathroom, though
this time in a tampon box.
Shortly thereafter, on Dec. 15, more
excrement was discovered on the walls of
the bathroom. While there have been no
other incidents involving feces, earlier

THE PHOENIX

this semester two pieces of graffiti were
found in a Gummere bathroom.
According to the Bi-Co News, a race related epithet, along with a tag, was discovered by a housekeeper on Jan. 23. This
cannot be definitively linked with the
other incidents that occurred earlier in
Gummere.
After the second incident, Haverford
Student Council Co-President Will
Harrison 'lO told the Bi-College News that
the administration would consider DNA
testing the feces if another incident
occurred.
According to Tom King, Director of
Haverford Safety and Security, DNA
testing the feces is not being considered
for a number of reasons. According to
King, not only are DNA tests very
expensive, but the process would raise
concerns about students' privacy as
well. "There's no probable cause or
even reasonable suspicion to assume
it's even someone from that building,"
he said. While King recognized that the
perpetrator is likely a resident of
Gummere, he recognized that that was
only a suspicion. "I mean that's probably the case, but that and a buck fifty
will get you a cup of coffee."
According to King, the school's reaction to the incidents has been restricted
by concerns about students' privacy.
"We're limited, and rightly so
we
can't put cameras everywhere, but at

Though DNA testing is not being
considered by the administration or the
police, King was not surprised that it
was being talked about among students.
Calling it the "CSI factor," King mentioned that even juries are being affected by the cultural phenomenon of scientific evidence, expecting prosecutors

Haverford is trying to find "that balance
between finding the person and the campus' reasonable demandfor privacy."
After the fourth incident, a new page
on the Haverford web site was established
to allow students to comment anonymous-

ly, in the hopes that a tip might lead to the

identification of the perpetrator. In an
email announcing the creation of the submissions page, Smith called it "something
we really would prefer not to have to do in
the Haverford community, but which
seems to us to be the only way to move forward and to end these incidents for the
benefit of all concerned."

Chester Center expands after first month's service
Continued from p. 3

"I have no doubt [the center] is going
to be successful just because the need is
there," Jetter said, adding that while
the original plans for the center would
have placed its service area solely within Chester, additional work on the project suggests that the entire Delaware
County has need of a college access center.
Meeting
need,
however,
this
involves more than catering to high
school students looking to attend college, according to the center director
Gwendolyn Atkinson-Miller.
"One of the goals of the center is to
really try to help students who are not
college material, who are not going to
school. So I'm reaching out to all the
technical training schools in Delaware
County, and I'm inviting them to the
center," Atkinson-Miller said, explaining that "if not higher education, we
can help some get training and skills to
get employment."
Jetter added that this also extends to
adults looking to begin or resume their

postsecondary education.
"If you're forty years old, and you
only went to college for one year, and
you're totally lost for how to get back

on track - you
can come to the
center and get
help," she said.
Another

important

for the center is

What it also means is that the center
is currently spending much of its
resources getting the word out about
the services it offers. "Our main goal
right now is to make sure that we do

so that people know we're here," said
Atkinson-Miller.
More generally, Atkinson-Miller said
the center's mission is to have a positive, direct impact its consumers. She

Haverford hosts candidates for Dean of Students
BY ANDREW THOMPSON

After an extensive search
and several intensive, confidential interviews, the Dean Search
Committee has finally developed a list of four finalists for
the position of Haverford's next
Dean of the College.
to
According

Professor Judy Owen, Chair of
the Dean Search Committee, the
Committee interviewed 12 semifinalists on February 17, 20, and
21, each for about two hours.
After the confidential interviews, the four finalists who
would actually visit campus and
meet with administration, faculty, and students were chosen.
Two of these finalists,
Candidate A and Candidate B,
visited Haverford on Tuesday,
February 24 and Wednesday,

Candidates A and B had dinner meetings with student leaders. After-dinner meetings were
held in Ryan Student Center,
and were open to all students to
meet the candidates and ask
questions.

Candidate A described herself as "definitely a fan of small
liberal arts colleges. I like knowing students and I like students

Candidate B said that his
vision for being dean was how

the way the process was going.
"We think the search is being

representatives [Adam Lewis

Maria Yee 'o9] have been doing a

Both Students' Council CoPresidents had a few qualities in
mind that they would like to see
in a new Dean. Harrison Haas
said he wanted someone with
"respect for the institutions that
make Haverford great: student
self-government, the Honor
Code, and recognition that those
are in effect what make

Will Harrison said he wanted
a Dean with "more than a token
willingness to work' with students and addressing concerns.
Someone who's willing to speak
their mind, whether it's to the
students or the administration."
Both candidates had a sense
of humor through the meetings.
When asked what the other
schools on their 'dream list'

Davidson College in North
Carolina.

Activism shapes student life at Swarthmore
BY HANNAH PURKEY

hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu

During
her
time
at
Swarthmore, Miriam Feingold
Real '63 was no stranger to the
county jails. An ardent activist
who was involved in organizing
many of the demonstrations
against segregation in Chester,
Pennsylvania and Cambridge,
Maryland, Real believed that
sometimes sacrifices had to be
made in the name of social justice. "Some of the activities we
were involved in ended up with
us being arrested," Real said. "I
remember spending several
days in jail with my school
books
Swarthmore,
from
attempting to do my homework
and study."
Real is only one of many students in the history of the college who have translated their
concern with social justice into
explicit activism. This dual dedication to academics and social
change has been a mark of
Swarthmore's reputation for
years, but few have questioned
to what extent it is a part of the
College's history. "Swarthmore
for years has had the reputation
of the Kremlin on the Crum [US
Vice President Spiro Agnew's
supposed
description
of
Swarthmore]," said Christopher
Densmore, Curator of the
Friends Historical Library. "To
what extent that is deserved or
to what extent it is reflective of
students as a whole, I don't
know." Yet those who have been
a part of activism on campus
over the years remember the
school as one of the most prominent vehicles for social change
in higher education.
"The thing I have always
loved about Swarthmore, even
when I was angry at it, was that
it always wanted to be a better
place than it was at the
moment," Maurice Eldridge '6l
said. "Every generation has had
its share of people both pushing
the institutionforward and looking at society and trying to push
it forward too."

The Early Years
Activism in the first few
decades of the college focused on
social movements for women's
suffrage as well as on the Quaker
heritage of peace. Although the
college had a long history in the
peace movement, the men's student government, an association
ofmale students on campus providing a form of self-government, sponsored a petition
requesting the integration of a
compulsory military program to
provide military training to all

those who wanted it when the
U.S. became involved in World
War I. The petition was signed
by almost all of the men on campus, and the program was ultimately granted by the Board of
Managers, according to Richard
Walton's "Swarthmore College:
An Informal History."

THE PHOENIX

The college also expressed
resistance to the war, however.
College President Joseph Swain
denounced the conflict in several prominent forums, including
one
in
the
House
of
Representatives in 1914. Other
professors participated in resistance to the war, including
William Hill in his work as a
trustee of the New Peace Union
as well as Benjamin Battin, class
of 1892, who worked as an organizer for the World Alliance of
Churches
for
Promoting
International
Friendship,
according to Walton.
Alice Paul, class of 1905, and
Mabel Vernon, class of 1906,
were key leaders in the national
women's movement both while
at Swarthmore and afterwards,
according to Phoenix archives.
Swarthmore students involved
in the women's liberation movement fought for suffrage in several ways, including participating in picket lines at the White
House with representatives from
several other colleges. In the
'3os, the women's liberation
movement continued with the
abolition of women's fraternities.
The anti-war sentiment was
felt at Swarthmore during World
War II when an astonishing 10
percent of students of the class of
'42 registered as conscientious
objectors, according to Isabel
Logan Lyon '42 in "Swarthmore
Remembered." The unprecedented number of objectors was put
in even starker relief due to the
placement of 300 Navy men on
campus. These military men not
only clashed with the campus's
anti-war leanings, but also indirectly integrated the college, as
three of the 300 Navy men were
black.

Continued from p. 7
As civil rights movements
began to spread across the South,
the

eastern shore town of

Cambridge, Maryland became a
center of activity and one that
was close enough for Swarthmore

students to be involved in.
Coverage in The Phoenix for the
1962-63 school year featured stories almost every week inApril of
students and professors alike
being arrested for sit-ins and
demonstrations
held
in
Cambridge.
These protests, focused outside of Swarthmore, were supported by more academic
activism back on campus.
"Activists, maybe, but academics
we were," Real said. "So we would
have a Marxist discussion group
and occasionally bring in a speaker to discuss some left-wing topic,
but it was always very academic."
This academic as well as social
approach to activism in the '6os
was one reason SPAC remained
independent of any nation-wide
organization. "We did not want to
be beholden to anyone else's agenda," Real said. "There were a
numberof organizations we could
have been a chapter of, but we
chose to go our own path so we
could be very open to taking on
social issues."
Even though many students
focused on combating discrimination outside of Swarthmore, the
student body did not ignore discrimination occurring on the
campus itself. Many of these concerns focused on admission of
black students, specifically those
considered "risk students," or students whose academic qualifications were not as high as those of
other
students
admitted.
"Swarthmore as well as a lot of
other colleges had gotten into the
position where it didn't discourage students ofcolor from coming
but it was not encouraging them
either," Densmore said. "It was
not going out and trying to find
diversity of the student body, and
that really becomes an issue in
the '6os."
The Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Students Society's
fight for the admittance of more
black students came to its crux in
1969 with the occupation of the
Admissions Office and ended in
what many alumni refer to as the
most traumatic week in the history of Swarthmore. In its explanation for the occupation of Parrish
Hall, SASS claimed, "the College
suffers from a white liberal mind
set" which was partly responsible
for the lack of recruitment of
black students, according to a
statement issued by SASS during
the sit-in called "Why We Can't
Wait" available in the College
Archives. A week after members
of SASS began the occupation, the
college's

president,

Courtney

Smith, died of a heart attack at
the age of 52. SASS soon after
ended its occupation amid accusations that the stress of the
demonstration had contributed to
the death of the president.

1970s and beyond
After Smith's death, activism
at the college continued to be
dominated by campaigns against
discriminatory practices, as well
as those against theVietnam War.
"The spring of 1970 was when
things really started going
berserk," Edward Levy '7l said.
"Students went on a sort of strike
with the sympathy of the faculty.
We stopped going to class and
having exams; it was a very
intense time." SASS continued to
fight for more opportunities for
black students, and the anti-war
sentiment grew on campus as
anxiety over the Vietnam War
continued. "There was this feeling that we were in this country
that was destroying the world and
attacking innocent people," Levy
said. "What was going on in people's minds was that you weren't
just tacitly involved but that you
were going to be sent over to murder people. That was what was
most disturbing, and if you got
out of it somehow it was because
of some white skin privilege
which black kids didn't have the
option of."
As the war began to wind
down, students became more
involved in pushing for the
school's divestment of its assets
in South Africa, according to
Densmore. Although petitions
and student council resolutions
had called for divestment as early
as the late '7os and early 'Bos,
pressure for divestment intensified in 1985.
Students spent weeks on information campaigns aimed at students and faculty as well as holding sit-ins of the Admissions
Office and the President's Office.
A few groups of students also
marched into the December meeting of the Board of Managers to
demand complete divestment.
According to Phoenix records,
the meeting was adjourned when
board members refused to continue the meeting unless the students and faculty members left,
which

some refused

to

do.

Divestment was achieved, howev-

er, in 1986.

Students at this time were also
involved in social activist movements closer to campus. "Our
thinking became more refined in
the sense that we began to think
and turn the ideas we had about
justice to ask about what was happening right under our noses,"
Real said. Students got involved
in the Chester Community
Improvement Project, a group
organized by local clergymen to
help improve housing and other
areas of concern in nearby
Chester, and other projects that
worked to improve areas in proximity to the school. Someof these
projects, like the SwarthmoreChester Volunteer Program,
offered stipends to students willing to volunteerfulltime for community groups, according to
Walton.
In the '9os, there was a revival
of conservative student activism,
according to Richard Valelly '75, a
professor of political science at
Swarthmore since 1993. The
administration supplied conservative student groups funds to
bring in speakers like William
Buckley Jr., a conservative
author and commentator who
founded the political magazine
National Review, and Phyllis
Schlafly, a conservative political
activist. "Al [Bloom] thought it
was just great," Valelly said. "It
showed that what we mean by
activism is students from all
kinds of views speaking their
minds." However, this movement
did not last long, and Valelly
described it as more of a blip in
Swarthmore's history.
Activism today
The extent to which activism
today mirrors Swarthmore's rich
past is a matter of opinion. "The
activism now is not the type
where you are standing in front of
troop trains saying don't come
here," Densmore said. "It is the
type of activism that recognizes
the problem, says let's look at the
March 5, 2009

problem and get some informa-

tion about it and put that information out there. I think there is
something really Swarthmorean
about that type ofactivism."
With the national and international successes of programs like
War News Radio and the
Genocide Intervention Network,
Swarthmore activism today utilizes new technology to evolve
with the changing issues of social
justice. "Web organizing is the
big way we see a lot of change in
the way that activism is done
today" said Nick Gaw 'O9, the
executive Director of STAND, the
student-led division of the GI-Net
working to achieve a world without genocide by giving individuals and communities the tools to
fight it.
STAND is using the development of these new technologies to
organize a national campaign to
elicit international change.
According to Gaw, STAND'S
efforts in the first 100 days of
President Obama's administration have relied on electronic
organizing. For example, electronic organizing allowed students across the country to sign
up to call the Secretary of State
every minute on Day 25 to help
put pressure on the administration to appoint a new special
envoy for the Sudan.
"For an organization that is
focused at national policy levels,
it is really important for us to
have a large national constituency which wouldn't be possible if
we were just doing face to face
interactions," said Katherine
Ashmore 'll, a member of the
leadership
Swarthmore
of
STAND. However, face-to-face tactics are not completely forgone in
today's
activism. "Different
moments call for different
responses by activists," Gaw said.
"We've done civil disobedience
last April in front of the White
House, we have broken fax
machines; those are important
tools of the trade. But when dealing with something that is a for-

eign policy issue like this we also
need to work through the government and develop those relationships so we can leverage them to
create change on the ground in
Darfur."
Swarthmore activists have
also expressed the feeling that
large-scale demonstrations are
not as effective today. "I just think
that its been very done in the
past, and that protests and mass
demonstrations can be effective
but they can also just as easily be
non-effective,"
said
Neena
Cherayil 11, a leader in many
activist
at
organizations
Swarthmore including STAND.
"It really has to be a big thing
because they happen so often."
The administration has found
the longevity of Swarthmore's
activist groups particularly
impressive. "The sophistication
students have come to have about
a succession plan so that the club
or whatever they have created
has a life going forward beyond
the four years of the current students is a significant change even
in the last ten years," Eldridge
said. "Also with WNR and
STAND, you see the spreading
across the country and spinning
off into an independent non-profit
which exists with a broader

a really more informed activism
that gets beyond the moment and
looks longer term, which is a significant change."
Eldridge is confident that the
interest students have shown in
making the world a better place
will continue in generations to
come. "If the world continues to
present us with the problems and
issues it has, the college and its
students and faculty will rise to
confront those issues," Eldridge
said. "I really think it is quite
embedded in the character of this
place, that people want to use
their intellectual and artistic talents and ring them to theirfullest
fruition not for their sake alone
but for the sake of the effect they
can have on the world."

'Scorched' transcends politics

Poetry reading runs the gamut at Kitao

that their connection seems
more genuine than anything
outside the theater. Their interactions alone are the stuff of
award winning performances;
still, the rest of the cast manages to live up to these powerful

actresses..

Yet another critical relation-

play
Mouawad's
playing
"Scorched,"
now
through March 29 at the Wilma
Theater in Philadelphia, is
aptly named, though the quality of the play itself is anything
but parched. Viewing it is a
deeply satisfying and rewarding experience, driven by a
fiercely
anti-war message.
Filled with poignant and
painful poetry, it is an arresting
story about learning to cope
with history by shattering the
silence of generations past.
A
Quebecois,
Lebanese
Mouawad weaves his own fascinating personal history into
the play's intricate quilt of a
story, but he avoids any specific
regional or political affiliations.
The war is always "from the
South" or a character lives in
"the North." The characters
may have Middle Eastern
names, but it is impossible to
determine their nationality or
faith.
Blanka Zizka, co-artistic
director of the Wilma Theater,
stages "Scorched" with a lightness of touch and weighty directorial presence that enhances

V THE PHOENIX

Mouawad's efforts to avoid
specificity.
Zizka and set
designer Ola Maslik have created a world liberated from limitations of nations and politics.
Their stage is a venue for the
pursuit and realization of truth
and justice. Each character is
being tested, tried by the jury of
the audience and history, for
their involvement in a world of
lies and secrets. The story
unfolds just as a trial would,
jumping throughout time to
piece together a portrait of an
obscured reality.
But the play is not a simple
quest for justice. The play has
moments of joy and beauty.
Love abounds in the lives of
these troubled souls, from the
forbidden romance of two
young people to the desperate
love of a mother and the fierce
loyality of two friends.
While not the most important relationship in the play,
the friendship of Nawal
(Jacqueline Antaramian, who
plays Nawal [between the ages
of 40 and 45]) and Sawda (Jolly
Abraham) is what ultimately
makes the Wilma's production
so successful. Antaramian and
Abraham have such a powerful
bond when they share the stage

ship forged in the play is that of
Janine (Leila Buck) and Simon
(Ariel Shafir) when their characters discover the truth that
they may as well be twins.
Different as they can be, the two
are inextricably linked by blood
and tragedy and, from the
moment of discovery on, they
share every agonized breath.
The
authenticity
of
Mouawad's story is so profound
that the actors seem to be transformed by more than their individual roles; they are altered by
the shared experience of living

in these characters and are
undoubtedly creating careerdefining performances. The
powerful humanity of each
character and the subtle gradations of each performance make
a painful and troubling story an
emotionally rewarding experi-

ence.
Together
in the brief
moment before life and war
finally manage to separate

them, Nawal and Sawda recite
the poem "El Atlal" meaning
"The Ruins," and it does not
take a translator to know what
they are saying. They know
that they hold no sway over the
future and resign themselves to
what fate has in store, but they
join together to acknowledge

that their love

cannot be

changed by the passage of time.
No amount of pain or cruelty
can undermine the sweet intensity of moments like these, and
their presence in the play

serves as a reminder of the true
motivation for pacifism, love.
Mouawad is a master storyteller, and as presented at the
Wilma, "Scorched" is a gratifying reflection on the human
condition and the many definitions oflove.

Members of Small Craft

,

Warnings, Swarthmore's oldest literary magazine, and

other student poets shared
their works through the spoken word to a small, but
responsive audience on Fri.,
Feb. 27 at the Kitao Art
Gallery.

The confined space of the
Kitao Art Gallery fostered a
sense of connection between
the poets and their audience.
"One of the great things
about reading poetry to an
audience is that there's a
direct connection between
the author and the reader
that's challenging to create
otherwise," said Rebekah
Judson 'l2, one of thereaders.
"In effect, the poetry becomes
a collaboration with both the
author and the reader driving
the work."
Among the wide range of
works performed, Justin
diFeliciantonio 10 read his
English translation of Ruben
Dario's poem "ho Fatal"
(Fatality). Translating poetry
became a hobby of Justin's
while studying abroad in
Buenos Aires last semester.
"I {had to] consider the poet's
aesthetic intentions, as well

as her schematic choices
meter, rhyme, form, for
instance," said diFeliciantonio. "Alongside the translated
poet, however, is the translator's own voice."
Besides the poetry readings, there were several musical interludes interspersed
throughout to provide some
levity and variety to the
event. Ben Starr 'll, Gabriel
Riccio 'll and Ben Rachbach
11 performed their own original compositions to the
crowd. "A lot of times poetry
can be jampacked with information and imagery, and having musical interludes maybe
gave the audience some time
to process the poetry, and listen in a less intense way,"
Starr said. It was refreshing
to hear originally composed
music alongside spoken word
poetry, giving the event
another rich dimension.
Small Craft Warnings is
currently accepting submissions of poetry, prose and art
for the Spring 2009 issue.

In "BitterSuite,"

Youngin Chung Phoenix Staff

Alumna Sita Frederick performs her solo performance

"BitterSuite,"

exploring the diverse dances of the Afro-Dominican diaspora.

BY ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

When the lights came on in
Upper Tarble this past Fri., Feb.
27 and its packed audience was
able to reflect on and discuss the
nebulous but affecting performance it had just seen, one of the
first questions raised was why
artist Sita Frederick '97 had chosen to focus her multimedia thepiece
atrical
and
dance
"BitterSuite" on, of all things,
sugar.

"BitterSuite," one of the
events hosted for Afro-Latin

Week and Black History Month,
is choreographed and performed
by Frederick. In the piece,
Frederick travels through a
seemingly boundless landscape
of different permutations in
Dominican and Haitian dance.
Although "BitterSuite" is a solo
performance,
Frederick
is
nonetheless accompanied by
countless Dominicans and
Haitians dancing in footage that
is projected on a screen behind
her. She travels through a sparse
but heavily symbolic
set
designed by Jose Ortiz, her collaborator and co-founder of their
performance company, "Areytos

Performance Works."
Frederick, who is trained in
modern dance, brings a rigorous
theoretical edge to "BitterSuite"
that allows the otherwise heavily abstracted and distancing perto

engage in a slew of issues in
Dominican/Haitian history and
culture. Evidence of her artistic
vision is her decision to express
her piece's wide scope through
the aperture of a single subject
sugar. The audience immediately notices two pronounced
a tall bunfeatures of the set
dle of sugar cane placed slightly
off-center on the stage that
Frederick must constantly dance
her way around, and the painting of a structure used to weigh
sugarcane (as Ortiz explained to
the audience after the performance) that frames the projection
screen. Sugar literally cannot be

12

avoided in Frederick's meditation on cultural roots and cultural traumas.
For Frederick, sugar is inextricably
to
linked
Dominican/Haitian race relations. On one level, "it's a
response to the [notion] that
talks about white sugar being
this exemplification of purity
and brown sugar ... representing
the opposite," Frederick said
during the Q&A section following the performance. But on a
deeper level, sugar represents
"this amazing history that is one
of the reasons that slavery
became this machine in the
Caribbean," Frederick said. "In
thinking about our African
ancestry and African heritage,
this is one of the major symbols
of why that happened."
Sugar's ideological associations with race, class and
authoritarianism are laid bare
in the character that Frederick
first appears as to her audience.
Donning a white military cap, a
suit and most notably towering
platform shoes, Frederick alternately barks out, "azucar" and
"sugar." Later, the character
says, "We are all Spanish. But
some of us are a little darker
than others."
Frederick drew heavily on

many of the contradictions in

rural style of music and dance,
by turning it into the national
music of the Dominican
Republic. "I'm looking at that

kind of archetype of the dictator

in particular," Frederick said.
"But I think it translates in gen-

we see
Frederick as the dictator character enthusiastically, if clumsily,
dancing merengue. The image
evokes the permeability of
music and dance, whose lure is
powerful that even those in the
upper echelons of power must
succumb to it. But gradually,
Frederick sheds her costume
and instead takes up a makeshift
skirt of red, white and blue
handkerchiefs. Along with her
dress, her dance also transforms
into a different style. Frederick
explained that the second half of
her piece was largely dominated
by the dance tradition of gaga,
known as "rara" to Haitians.
"Gaga is a Dominican Haitian
secular and sacred practice that
began with the Haitian migrant
laborers and in a special sect
within the voodoo tradition,"
Frederick said. She added that
the tradition is both religious
and secular and is also a product
of a reconciliation between
Catholicism and African traditions.

"As you know, these traditions are very much about blending," Frederick said. Sure
enough, many in the audience
noted similarities to other forms
of African and Afro-Caribbean
dance. When asked about a very
Yoruba-reminiscent leg bump
movement
in her dance,
Frederick said, "I studied
African Cuban for many years
and I can't really get it out of me.
I enjoyed the Yoruba tradition
from Cuba and I've danced it for
almost ten years now." She
added, "And there's a connection. It's all from Yoruba. Haiti
has those too."
Luis Rodriguez 'O9, who
organized the event, also noted
connections between Frederick's
performance and the African
modern dance he has been
studying at Swarthmore. "I
noted that her knees were basically bent the whole time she
was dancing and that just
reminded me of the dance that
I've studied here which is Afro

fascinating
As
as
"BitterSuite" may be, it frustrates and challenges its audience with more questions than

answers. "BitterSuite" ends with
a forceful action that leaves
much open to interpretation. But
neither Frederick nor Ortiz was
willing to explain the ending to
the audience. This was in part
because of the highly personal
and subjective nature of the performance. Ortiz said, "There's
something very attractive about
the side of investigation, but all I
can do is present my opinion."
Artistic rigor is only one element of Frederick and Ortiz's
work. "We are really interested
in both the excellence of art
the high art of making work that
is sophisticated and complex,"
Frederick said. "But also [we're
interested in] being in a community and having conversations
with people. It's just not about
the high tower somewhere. It
really has roots and legs and feet
and in the community and in
other people."

I spent that summer working in a
bookstore, shipping back titles from
small Christian publishers and dreaming exactly how thoroughly and succulently I would be roasted in Hell. I was
off the medication again, and the bad
thoughts had started to return although
I denied furiously their existence. I
returned to Swarthmore early that
year, to write and act in the freshmen
orientation play. So I spent time with
friends, and I played videogames constantly to silence the voices, and I practiced a lame New Jersey accent (I was

I can try to avoid it but eventually
I'll have to write about The Girl, capital-Tee and capital-Gee. There are many
things that I would like to say about

reason. But it would be better, I think,
to keep things short.

my seduction technique, as it were,
involved staring down attractive
women without once blinking or averting my gaze and repeating to myself,
again and again, "I am 1970s hairychested love-god Batman." I was floppyhaired, lanky, confused and self-conscious; I grew a scruffy goatee because
it was the only symmetrical, continuous pattern of facial hair I could produce. (Of course, I have changed and
matured a great deal since then. I have
shaved the goatee.) But The Girl attended Bryn Mawr, and Bryn Mawr students are not known for sophisticated
reproductive strategies. Every girl who
attends Bryn Mawr is psychologically
rewired, perceiving the world in duotone Terminator vision, constantly
scanning and running sexy diagnostics.
Imagine that the Terminator was not
hunting for Linda Hamilton, necessarily, but just someone who looked sort of

I took the bus over that Saturday

Sager disassociates from Genderfuck Party
To the Editor:
Since September,

-

-

the Sager
Symposium Planning Committee
has been working to put together a
weekend
of
events
entitled
“Intersections of Queer: Coalition
Building Across Our Communities,”
being held on March 27 and 28.
While the Genderfuck Party may
have been originally nicknamed the
“Sager” Party because of its role as
a culminating event for the symposium, the party and the symposium
have been growing increasingly
apart both in mission and attendance. The Symposium's mission is
to foster queer community building
in a safe and supportive environment, which the committee feels is
not possible given the atmosphere of
Swarthmore's campus on the day of
the Genderfuck Party. Incidents of
abuse and harassment, especially
for women and queer people, are

highest during this event, making
the party an unsafe space to truly
experiment with gender. This year,
we would like to refocus our energies and the attention of the campus

on the activism and coalition build-

ing that are central to the Sager
Symposium. As a result, after considering many possible options, we

are disassociating ourselves from
the party, which is not related to the
broader goals of the events, and
should no longer be known as
"Sager." While the party and symposium are no longer affiliated, we
look forward to the party on April 4,
which we hope will be a night that
continues to foster gender bending
and is safer and more consensual
than it has been in years past.

Respectful criticism of Dining Services, please
To the Editor:
I would like to register my objection to the tone that Mr. Issa took in
his letter last week ("Campus Late
Night Dining Options Unacceptable").

While I found the substance of his
complaint legitimate, I believe it is
extremely disrespectful to demand
action from Dining Services staff and
administrators as if they were at our
total beck and call.
Dining Services has the difficult
job of making sure that there is
enough food at Essie Mae's to satisfy
student demand without creating
waste.

For the most part, Dining Services
does excellent work in meeting our

needs. I am pretty sure that lack of
food on a previous Sunday night was
unpredictable, and not a sign of
incompetence.

If students, including Mr. Issa, feel
that there is a persistent problem
with supplies at Essie Mae's, I suggest that they directly contact the
Dining
Services administrators
through the available Swarthmore
webpage.

I know that these administrators
are very approachable and are open
to hearing our suggestions. They
deserve respect and appreciation
with our comments, not rude criticism in The Phoenix.

Who's leading the GOP?
It was the right-wing throwdown of a lifetime several days ago when Rush Limbaugh
and Michael Steele got into a much-publicized tiff over which Republican powerhouse is the de-facto leader of the Grand Ole

Party.

But as a matter of fact, it's a very interesting question. John McCain, who led the
Republicans to defeat in 2008, isn't much of a

contender, and Sarah Palin, who made some
news after the election when she fired back
at the press for all the wrongs it inflicted
upon her, has essentially faded into the
background. So the stage was set for an epic
fight between Michael Steele, the GOP upand-comer, and Rush Limbaugh, reigning
conservative radio champion, to determine
which man actually leads the Republican

Party.

Michael Steele, 51, the former Lieutenant
Governor of Maryland, was recently elected
to
chair the Republican
National
Committee. He is a fan of bi-partisanship,
the Internet, and
the party's principles to the urban-suburban hip-hop setting," whatever that means. Limbaugh, once
called a "Big Fat Idiot" in the title of a New
York Times bestseller by Minnesota Senator
and comedian Al Franken, is the highly controversial, highly inflammatory conservative talk show host who calls soldiers
against the war "phonies," hopes Obama's
agenda "fails," and enjoys writing songs to
the tune of "Barack the Magic Negro."
But all joking aside, the question of GOP
leadership is more relevant than ever, given
that the fate of the Republican Party
remains so uncertain.
Despite predictions that the new president's popularity would force Republicans
to cooperate, Obama's wish that politicians
ask "not whether government is too big or
too small, but whether it works" has hardly
been fulfilled. The latest iteration of the
bailout bill was passed in the House without
a single Republican supporter, making it
seem that the lesson many Republicans take
from the failure of the Bush years is that
they weren't conservative enough.
Which brings us back to Steele and
Limbaugh. Perhaps the only thing the two
have in common is that both are uncompromisingly conservative. Bob Beckel, a political analyst at Fox News and frequent cable
news sparring partner of Steele's, wrote in
Real Clear Politics, "Under that friendly persona of reasonableness lies the soul of a doctrinaire conservative. From an ardent supply-sider [sic] to a committed pro-life advocate (he came within a year of being
ordained a Catholic priest), Steele is firmly
on the Right." Limbaugh's political views, in

op-art

by

contrast, range from far right
he believes
that human-induced climate change "is just
a bunch of scientists organized around a
political proposition"
to off the charts:
he's been quoted saying that the soldiers
accused of torture in Abu Ghraib were "having a good time
you ever heard of emo...

tionalrelease?"
Steele can thus be forgiven for sparking
the whole controversy when he said,
responding to a comment by a CNN
reporter, "I'm the de facto head of the
Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an
entertainer Yes, it's incendiary. Yes, it's
ugly." Steele ended up having to apologize,
but he made his point. Whether or not Rush
Limbaugh remains the darling of conservatives, he is not the leader of the Republican
Party and his approach, assuming he even
has a real political approach, will take the
Republican Party nowhere. As Limbaugh
said in an article in the New York Times
Magazine last year, "First and foremost I'm
a businessman. My first goal is to attract the
largest possible audience so I can charge
confiscatory ad rates."
But does this necessarily rule out
Limbaugh as the GOP's de-facto leader?
Limbaugh seems to think so. He said, "I'm
not in charge of the Republican Party, and I
don't want to be." And Eric Cantor, a prominent GOP Republican, has repeatedly said
that no Republican in Congress agrees with
Limbaugh that Obama's agenda should fail.
So Limbaugh may well be the spiritual
leader of America's conservatives, but he
certainly isn't the ring leader of the
...

Republican Party.

Steele, the failed Senate candidate and

potential gubernatorial candidate from
Maryland, may be the closest thing the
Republicans have to a leader right now. But
it's unclear what he can do to improve the
Party's chances in the next election. The
best choice
move the Party closer to the
center
doesn't seem to have occurred to
the Republicans who matter.

Even if Steele is as conservative as his
record suggests, there are important steps
that Steele ought to take. The last frenzied
months of the election were spent watching
Sarah Palin rally crowds around the notion
that there is one "Real America."
This, in particular, is why we're so glad
that Steele believes that Republican candidates should try to nab inner-city minority
votes. Just a couple of months after Palin
blessedly departed the political stage, we
seem to have a leader of the RNC who
believes that the inhabitants of cities
deserve Republican consideration, just as
much as rural farmers do.

Opinions
Looking for diversity? Don't look to the Senate
swarthmorephoenix.com

It's not going out on a
limb to predict that Roland
Burris will not be a senator
for much longer. When he
leaves, it is an unfortunate
fact that America will be
back where it was at the
start of 2009: with no
African-Americans represented in the U.S. Senate.
This is, of course, the
way it has been throughout America's history. Of
Jesse Gottschalk
the thousands of Senators
Idea Democracy
in American history, six
have been black. Since
Reconstruction, the only
African-American Senators have been Edward Brooke,
Carol Moseley Braun, Barack Obama and Roland Burris
and these last three have all held the same Illinois
Senate seat.
The problem is just as bleak when you look at governors. Adding together the durations of all the AfricanAmerican governorships in America's 220-year history,
black governors have led states for a grand total of exactly seven years. Before Douglas Wilder's election as
Virginia's chief executive in 1989, the entire history of
African-American governorship consisted of the 35 days
in the 1870s when RB.S. Pinchback was governor of
Louisiana.
This is shameful, but for anybody who has the least
knowledge of American history, it may be sadly unsur-

around that stretches from our schools to our constitution to our parties, so let's start blaming.
Let's start with some statistics. The vast majority of
including 90 percent of the current Senate
senators
have already held elective office. More than a quarter
have already been elected statewide, including the 11 former governors who are currently senators. The disproportionately low representation of African-Americans at
other levels of elective office, then, means that representation will likely decrease as politicians aim for higher
offices.
Education is relevant: 99 out of 100 Senators hold
bachelors degrees or higher. Meanwhile, less than two
percent of the adult population is comprised of AfricanAmericans with these degrees, while nearly 20 percent is
comprised of white college graduates. The gap widens for
older cohorts, so it is more dramatic when we consider
only those eligible for election to the Senate (at age 30).
Wealth is a factor. Dozens of U.S. senators are millionaires, and personal wealth clearly helps people get
elected in competitive races. It should come as no surprise that white millionaires outnumber black millionaires by a large margin a good lowball estimate seems
to be around 20-to-l, and the number may be much higher.
So right from the start, we have a problem: AfricanAmericans are disproportionately unlikely to have some
ofthe background factors which are highly predictive of
membership in the U.S. Senate. I've talked about prior
office, education and wealth, but I'm sure that with more
research similar statistics could be found with other factors things like parental education, family structure,

This is not only a problem for African-Americans. For
example, although there were three Latino Senators at
the start of 2009, there were none in 2000, and in 2011
there will likely be just one remaining. Meanwhile,
diversity of gender, religion, and sexuality are also
strongly lacking , in some cases drastically.
For this column, I'm going to focus specifically on the
lack of African-American senators.
One thing to keep in mind, however, is that many of
the same obstacles face other underrepresented groups,
at other levels of office.
Without a question, racism, both personal and institutional, has been the biggest barrier. It is not, however,
the only factor involved. There's plenty of blame to go

although
But this doesn't solve the puzzle entirely
these statistics should diminish the predicted numbers of
black senators, they certainly don't explain why the
number might be ZERO by the end of 2009. Let's keep

prising.

etc.

looking.
The incomparable Nate Silver ofFiveThirtyEight.com
sees political factors as extremely important. Silver
starts with two important trends: first, all current

African-American congressmen represent districts that
are significantly more African-American than the nation
as a whole; and second, African-Americans tend to be
more consistently Democratic than the rest of the nation.
The result of these trends is that, to win election, most
black representatives must play to a constituency very

different than the one they would have to win over in a
statewide election. Making this pivot is certainly possible, but politically tricky. Since nearly half ofall senators
are former congressmen, anything that makes it harder
for a congressman to get elected to the Senate is important here.
Why African-American congressmen tend to only be
elected in districts that are disproportionately black
brings up its own range of issues
some are the same as
those facing senators (like educational and economic
backgrounds and racism), while others are unique to the
House (gerrymandering).
Another important issue is the structure of American
elections. Unlike many other democracies, the United
States doesn't have a system of proportional representation (PR), where congressional seats are assigned based
on party results in a nationwide election.
Why would a PR system encourage greater representation of African-Americans? In most PR systems, each
party publishes a list of politicians affiliated with their
party; as they win seats, those seats are assigned to people on their list. There tends to be a pressure on parties
in a PR system to diversify their lists in proportion to
overall population: any party whose list is not sufficiently diverse may face criticism and backlash.
This pressure doesn't exist in America's political system. In fact, the biggest pressure on our political parties
goes in the opposite direction. Each party has an incentive to support whichever candidate they think will be
most likely to win in November.
A party can bemoan the lack of black candidates
nationwide while supporting a white candidate locally
without serious repercussions.
I could go on and on listing obstacles. The main point
I am trying to get across is that although racism is almost
certainly the central factor, it is enmeshed with many
institutional and political factors
ones that persist
even in the so-called "Age of Obama."
On the one hand, these factors present a daunting barrier. On the other hand, steps like education or campaign
things we should be considering anyway
reforms
might also cut aside some of these important barriers.
Electing President Obama was a huge step. But in 2011,
the Senate will likely be less diverse than it was in 2008.
We've got a long way to go.

on assault weapons was allowed to expire,
and this Congress should reenact a
stricter, permanent version.
But the cultural rift that divides
Americans over guns is not fully
THE PHOENIX

expressed by the debate over militarygrade semi-automatic rifles, just as any
talk about hunters' rights is more or less
superfluous. The fact is that most people

understand that assault weapons have no
application for personal
defense and, likewise, that rifles are an
integral and necessary component of
many lifestyles. But thanks to the gun
lobby, gun control activists have been misrepresented as trying to take away basic
hunting rights, while even Congressmen
who might support an assault weapons
ban balk for fear of lowering their NRA
approval scores.
The truly serious question that
Americans face today is the issue ofhandguns. As you might guess, opinions on
•handguns will differ greatly from person
to person, but the fact is that in certain
areas, namely rural ones, handguns are
not even reason to pause. They are but
one more tool for self-defense and sport,
useful both to protect your home and to
leisurely (but responsibly) target beer bottles. In other areas, handguns terrorize
citizens, leave passersby dead in crossfire,
and breed fear among innocent
permissible

bystanders.
The simple truth is that handguns
mean different things in different places,

and no one attitude towards guns should
necessarily trump the others on philosophical or practical grounds. Ideally, the
right to a handgun would be a matter of

states' rights (or perhaps cities' rights),
determined by citizens to best suit their
specific needs. Areas interested in the private possession of handguns could allow
such weapons, and areas in which hand-

guns were seen as too risky for society
could prohibit them. Obviously, trafficking would be an issue, but if California
can keep out unwanted oranges, New
York should be able to regulate pistols.
Of course, this picture is unconstitutional (although so was women's suffrage
at one point, so go figure). Handgun ownership has been interpreted as a right safeguarded by the Second Amendment,
which is why those interested in keeping
their neighborhoods safe would do well to
try to work within the system, as many
have. Handguns should be universally
regulated and effective databases should
be compiled to hold dealers responsible to
make sure that weapons do not fall into
the wrong hands. All of these measures
can be enacted without in any way
"infringing" upon the right to bear arms.
And as with many issues, the rancorous debate over gun legislation is as
much a problem of misperception as a disagreement of substance. The mantra
"Guns don't kill people, people kill people"
is pithy but it forgive me
misses the
mark. Gun control activists don't seek to
ravage constitutional rights. They only
respond to grim realities, one of which is
the problem of handguns in urban areas.

March 5, 2009

Many city dwellers are fully aware of
the rights afforded them, but have realized that there are times when an individual right must step aside for a legitimate
collective security interest. Case in point:
Manhattanites give up their right to
sparklers on the Fourth of July
fun as
they are
because no one wants another
GreatFire.
And no, the right to bear sparklers is
not constitutionally guaranteed, but individual rights enthusiasts should understand that the right to handguns is as
much a culturally determined conclusion
as an original intention of the constitution's framers. An effective six-bullet
revolver was decades away when the
Constitution was ratified, and this deadly
weapon was a far cry from the flintlocks
used in gentlemanly dueling. The nineteenth century portrait of the Wild West,
Manifest Destiny and agrarian lifestyle
also helped to create a present day culture
of gun ownership. This culture has
changed markedly in the last eighty years,
however, through trends of urbanization
and suburbanization, and the needs of
these communities were not anticipated
or provided for by the Founders.
The best solutions, then, are those that
recognize the stark differences in attitude
towards guns in this country and allow
for flexibility.

Baseball: Team Cuba running for (a new) home?
The 2009
World
Baseball
Classic is
set to debut
tonight. The
competition

is baseball's
answer to
soccer's
World Cup,

Josh Abel
Called Third

pitting
teams from
16 different

countries
against
each other.

Internationalbaseball competition has
very little in the way of a compelling history. Olympic baseball is flat due to its
lack of major leaguers (it's held in the
middle of the MLB season), and this is just
the second WBC, preceded only by the
2005 version, which was a big hit around
the world.

However, all these competitions share
one very compelling storyline: Team
Cuba.
A lot of the fun of the WBC is seeing
major league stars in a new setting. It's
like an all-star game, except people care
about it. The Cuban team offers something different. These are some of the
game's great players, but they're the ones
you can't see anywhere else.
Cuba's relationship with the rest of the
world is a controversial one, and you're

not reading a sports column for geopolitical insights. What is relevant here is how
it affects the country's great baseball play-

ers.
Cuba keeps its baseball talent under
tight wraps. Movement to and from the
island is closely monitored, and the
Castro regime (Fidel Castro is a big baseball fan himself) is well aware of the allure
of major league baseball (and major
league salaries) for his top players.
As a result, Cuban baseball stars and
their families are watched closely, and
when they leave the country for international play, they are heavily guarded.
Whenever the Cuban national team leaves
the island, there is a very real risk of stars
bolting in the night.
These escape attempts can be just as
dramatic as they sound. Any casual baseball fan has certainly heard of Orlando "El
Duque" Hernandez. He was one of the
horses in the starting rotation that
anchored the New York Yankees' dynasty
of the late 19905, delivering his greatest
performances in the most critical postseason games.
He was also one of the great pitchers in
Cuban history, but was banned from the
national team in 1996 because he was suspected of attempting to defect. Later that
year, he and a few others piled into a shoddy sailboat with minimal supplies and set
out for Florida. Mere hours later, the boat
could no longer float, and they were
stranded on a small desert island in the
middle of the Caribbean Sea. They

remained there for four days, subsisting
on what meager food they could scrounge
together. Upon being rescued by the U.S.
Coast Guard, Hernandez and his fellow
fugitives spent time in a refugee camp in
the Bahamas, and it looked as though
Hernandez would be sent back to Cuba.
However, the U.S. Department of State
eventually allowed him to enter the country. His MLB career began soon after.
Given that history, it isn't so surprising that the spotlight of a New York postseason failed to faze Hernandez.
Every other Cuban defector who plays
in the United States has a similar tale to
tell (though often with less drama).
Kendry Morales, a member of the L.A.
Angels of Anaheim, reached the United
States in his eighth attempt to escape.
Jose Contreras of the White Sox fled the
Cuban national team for the United States
while in Mexico.
And by no means is the drama of the
actual escape the only hardship these
Cuban defectors face. For these men, leaving Cubafor the MLB means leaving their
entire lives behind. It means leaving
behind a family and not knowing when
they will ever see them again. These defectors leave behind everything they have
ever known for a shot at the major
leagues. For many, it is worth it, but the
costs are immense.
So when you watch a WBC game
involving Cuba, there's a lot more going
on than you may realize. For instance, if
you watched the WBC in 2005, you might

have seen Alexei Ramirez playing for
Cuba. On the surface, he was just a
ballplayer. However, below the surface, he
was struggling with the issues that have
haunted so many Cuban players before
him, wrestling with the idea of breaking
through baseball's iron curtain and pursuing a lifetime of wealth and freedom in
the United States, while leaving behind
his entire past. Two years later, he defected. In 2008, he was runner-up for the
American League Rookie of the Year
Award.
This is what makes the Cuban team so
fascinating to watch. They are playing the
game just like the other 15 teams (actually,
they're playing a lot better than most of
the other 15 teams), but there are dynamics at work that go well beyond baseball.
For these players, there is a dichotomy
between playing for Cuba and not. Once
they take that step to leave, they are gone
forever. And to outside observers, the
players on the other side of that curtain
mysteriare mysterious and intriguing
ous because they play in a baseball world
separate from our own, but intriguing
because they live in a world that is our
own, and so we can sympathize with their
struggle and contemplate the difficult
decisions they face.
When you watch Team Cuba play,
you're not only watching baseball drama,
but also getting a glimpse into a very powerful human interest story.

Women's lacrosse downs Moravian in season opener
BY ANDREW

GREENBLATT

agreen3@swarthmore.edu

The women's lacrosse team
surged past Moravian this past
Saturday to open their season
with a win. The Garnet
outscored the Greyhounds 13-5 in
a game played on Haverford's
Swan Field as part of the second
annual Tri-Co Invitational.
Moravian notched the first
goal ten minutes into the game,
but the Garnet responded with
three consecutive goals in less
than two minutes, which proved
to be a recurring theme of the
game; Moravian never scored
back-to-back goals.
After Swarthmore's first scoring flurry, a Moravian goal at the
16-minute mark drew the
Greyhounds within one goal, but
they would never get closer.

Swarthmore's
offense, combined with stingy
defense, began the season on a
positive note and has sparked
excitement among the players.
Vachal wasted no time in an
effort to surpass her team-leading 39 goals from last year with
four goals on Saturday. De Regt
and Emily Evans 'll notched
three goals apiece, giving the
Garnet three players who scored
hat tricks.
"After the first five minutes
we settled down a little bit," said

defender Kelsey Hatzell 'O9, who
added a goal of her own. "I was
impressed at how much teamwork there was, how much confidence we had in everyone on the
field."
Vachal added, "Before the
Moravian game all of us visualized ourselves playing a flawless
game, playing with no mistakes
whatsoever. We're definitely
confident this year."
A lot of that confidence is
coming from the return of assistant coach Kristen English 'OL
English,
a three-time Allat
Conference
defender
Swarthmore and 2001 NCAA
Division 111 National Defender of
the Year, has assumed the head
coaching duties during head
coach Karen Borbee's sabbatical.
English is back after taking last
season offfrom coaching to focus
on her graduate studies.
"She's amazing at conditioning, and by amazing I mean she
comes up with a lot of tortuous
ways to keep us in shape," goalkeeper Ally Grein 'lO said.
Vachal credits English's focus on
conditioning as a key component
to the team, "taking big strides to
back [our confidence] up."
The team's poise and confidence came despite the absence
of two-time All-Centennial selection Melissa Grigsby 'O9.
Grigsby, a defender who also
made this year's All-Centennial
team as a basketball player,
missed the game because her
basketball season was still in
progress. In her absence, however, the Garnet was able to step up

on the defensive side of the field,

allowing only five goals.
"Allison Kelly [ll] did an
amazing job on Saturday, she
was really like my right-hand
girl," said Grein, who was credited with 11 saves in the game.
Grein also noted, "On defense we
wanted to be loud, talk a lot and

communicate with each other."
The Garnet did just that, playing strong defense and disrupting Moravian's offensive flow.
The Greyhounds were never able
to get into a rhythm offensively,
and were held scoreless for long
stretches of 14 and 19 minutes.
"Everyone was shifted a little out
of position, taking .on a slightly
different roles, but we came
together well for the first game,"
Hatzell said.
The Garnet point to making
the playoffs as a major goal for
the season and are taking the
proper steps to make their goal a
reality. "This is somewhat different from other years because we
have a deep team, there's going
to be a lot of contributors,"
Hatzell said. Some of those contributors are the new faces, the
first-years who on Saturday
looked like seasoned veterans.
"[The first-years were] very calm
and asserted themselves very
well on the field. People wouldn't
have picked them out to be first
years," Hatzell added. Grein
echoes Hatzell's sentiments, noting that the class of 2012 has "a lot
of talent."
Marie Mutryn 'l2,pitched in
two goals for the Garnet, highlighting a number of spirited

efforts from the team's firstyears in their college debut.
What's next for the team is
what Grein calls the "tour de

and

side of spring break as a closer

when the freshmen really start to
come out of their shells."
The Garnet's home opener

also experimenting with another sport:

squash.
My memory was jogged because of a
recent flurry of activity in the squash
world. First, Trinity College (CT) won
their unprecedented 11th straight
national championship. That is something that any sports fan anywhere has
to respect. Having won 202 matches in a
row, the Trinity Bantams are in control
of the longest collegiate varsity winning streak in history.

In addition, because of the press on
the Swarthmore web site, I am now
aware that Swarthmore itself is in possession of a squash team.
Finally, while pawing through this
week's Sports Illustrated, I noticed that
the magazine gave squash the secondhighest probability of being the next

squash publicity in the recent weeks
has made me remember my brief affair
with the sport this winter.
For those of you who have never
played squash, I can only describe the
sport as the most explosive thinkingman's (or woman's) sport on the planet.
There seem to be a few ways to play the

game, as

I found out while being losing

to everyone I played against. Initially,

my strategy was to wait for the other
person to hit the ball and then sprint
towards it and smash it off the front

wall as hard as I could.
However, in addition to it being the
most tiring strategy I attempted, I realized that this Donkey Kong approach
was simply no good. By hammering the
ball off the front wall as hard as I could,
I was setting up my opponent for a predictable and often calculated return
shot that usually found me out of position, due to the speed at which the ball
had bounced off the wall towards my
opponent.
At this juncture, I had decided that it
was time for a change in strategy. I figured I would do a little research, and
like anyone with a need for speed of
information I went straight to
Wikipedia. Apparently there was some
sense to playing the game in a more
centrally located position on the court
(as opposed to frantically sprinting

Playing squash with a friend or with
a group of friends (our college has a
doubles court) is a good way to just
hang out and talk while being active at
the same time.
Additionally, I feel like squash is the
type of sport that transcends age. For
example, squash could be an excellent
way to reconnect with your parents or
other adults on a sports plane, because I
often hear people talking about how they
used to play squash back in the day.
With myself as an example, squash is
not a hard sport to pick up and have fun
with. That being said, it is clear that
some commitment is necessary to
become good at squash.

I have had the fortune of playing
against or watching students who
either play on our squash team, or who
played on their high school's squash
team. Let me tell you: those kids can

Givans edged for gold in Centennial photo finish
BY DANNY FRIEL

Kenyetta Givans 'l2 didn't
know if she had won or not.
It was the final of the women's
55-meter hurdles at the Centennial
Conference
Indoor
Track
Championship last Sunday at
Ursinus. Givans had shattered the
college record in her signature
event, slashing 0.05 off her previous best to run a 8.67 in Saturday's
preliminary heats and become the
top seed in the final. She was nearly a tenth of a second ahead of her
nearest competitor, a comfortable
spread despite seeming miniscule
to the casual observer.
Imagine then, being edged by
0.002 for the conference title on
Sunday afternoon at Ursinus' Floy

Lewis Bakes Field House.
"It took about eight or nine

minutes before they announced
[the official results]," Givans said.
Sometimes she can see her competitors in her peripheral vision.
"Usually I can tell [if I'm ahead] if
the person next to me is still in
mid-jump," she said. But this race
was too close to call.

Givans and Haverford junior
Eliza Reiss cleared the finish
together, each clocking times of
8.58. Further analysis of the finish, however, led officials to call
Reiss the winner by just two

"The 800 was kind of tricky. It

"No one really races that volume,"

Givans' performance was one of
a number of top finishes by the
Garnet women. Middle distance
linchpin Cait Mullarkey 'O9 continued her winning ways with a couple of fourth-place performances,
finishing just outside the medals in
800-meter run (2:2195) and the mile
(5:02.59). Mullarkey, the 2007 800meter champion, had a busy weekend, running her two individual
races plus two relays. Swarthmore
Head Coach Pete Carroll knows it
takes a toll on her body. "She probably would have won [the 800] if
she had been fresh," he said,

Mullarkey's legs were tired.
Indeed, her seed time of 2:19.59
would have won her the gold. "It's
bittersweet," Carroll said of
Mullarkey's trio of fourth-place

finishes

(she

anchored the
women's 4xBoo, which was fourth
in 9:54.82), an impressive if frus-

year."

Even behind the standouts, the
Garnet had much to celebrate.

The always-solid

women's disimpressed again.
Aside from Mullarkey's contributions, Bess Ritter 'O9 ran to a sixthplace finish in the 5,000-meter run
in a lifetime best time of 18:08.94,
which vaulted her to fifth place all-

time for the Garnet. Margaret
Lenfest 'l2 emerged from one of
the slower heats by shaving over
eight seconds off her seed time in
the 800 to run 2:28.25, good enough
for seventh place in the conference. Carroll wasn't surprised
with Lenfest's breakthrough race,
noting that a first-year's inexperience on the college circuit can
sometimes work to an athlete's
advantage by allowing her to run
without the pressure of "knowing
names and faces" on the track.
The
foursome of Nyika
Corbett 'lO, Givans, Natalie Stone
'O9 and Mullarkey took the
bronze in the distance medley
(12:3819). The distance medley,
which sees four athletes run distances of 1200, 400, 800 and 1,600
meters, respectively, is the perfect opportunity for the Garnet to
exploit its versatility in the
women's distance events.

Other impressive performances

2.78 meters for fourth-place in the
pole vault, while classmate Nicole

result in the high jump, clearing a
height of L 44 meters.
Dan Ly 'l2 led the Garnet men

On the track, the Swarthmore
men were led by the dynamic duo
of Erik Saka 'O9 and Dan Hodson
'O9, who finished 10th and 11th
respectively in the men's 3,000meter run. Saka's time of 8:56.43
lands him ninth all-time at
Swarthmore, while Hodson's fin-

ish in 8:5719 is 11th all-time.
Carroll noted the absences of
Connor Darby 'O9 and Dan Kurz 'll

4x200-meter relay finals) due to
injury as a significant setback for
the Garnet men.

Swarthmore baseball began

excelled in his first appearance
of the season, earning the win
with six strong innings pitched.
He struck out five while only
allowing one earned run and
issuing no walks.
Mejia also enjoyed plentiful
run support, of which the
Garnet pitchers in the late game
did not have the luxury. There
were opportunities to put runs
on the board, but Swarthmore
hitters left nine men on base.
Head Coach Stan Exeter identified this problem as an area for
improvement. "We need to execute a little better with runners
in scoring position," he said.
"Their team made some big
plays when they needed to and
we couldn't."
The Garnet's lone run came
in the second inning when Matt
Lamb 'l2 grounded out to the
second
baseman.
Michael
Cameron 'l2 had tripled to lead
off the inning and scored to tie
the game at 1-L Over the next
five innings, the Brewers added
three more runs and kept
Swarthmore base runners from
crossing the plate.
Lamb was enthusiastic about
the RBI in his first college atbat, but he recognized the need
to improve both sides of the
team's game. "It was great being
able to get out there so early in
the year," he said, but added,
"we threw a lot of balls and
walked a lot of guys, and we
need to see a lot more pitches
and make their pitchers work

harder to get us out. It's gonna
come."
As catcher in the second
game, Lamb
took partial
responsibility for the seven
walks issued, but he is still
learning the system, like many
talented first-years that saw
action on Saturday. Led by
Waterhouse and Cameron, the
new additions displayed their
potential in both games, scoring
five of the team's seven runs
and accounting for three of the
six runs batted in.
Co-captain Conor Casey 'O9,
who leads the Garnet in games
played, indicated the addition of
the first-years as the greatest
source of improvement from last
season. "The main thing is that
we have a lot more depth in the
infield and the pitching rotation," he said.
Exeter agreed that the
increased depth is pivotal
because it allows flexibility. "We
added 14 more faces so we can
move people around and put
them in the right places to succeed," he said.
