Last year when David Ho
went into a New York newspaper shop to purchase Time's

Man of the Year issue—his
portrait graces the cover—the
shopkeeper duly took his
money and reminded him to
shut the door on his way out.

Forty-five year old Dr. Ho
has managed to keep a surprisingly low profile for
someone of his stature, but it
certainly does not take anything away from his level of
accomplishment. The fact that
the Time editorial board chose
him over Bill Gates, Bill
Clinton and Mother Teresa as
the recipient of the coveted
award is no fluke.
Dr. Ho, who formerly

helped prolong the lives of
countless AIDS patients, and
more importantly, kept alive
the hope of one day finding a
cure for the deadly virus.
Ho was brought to campus
yesterday by the Swarthmore
Asian Organization (SAO)
and the William J. Cooper
Foundation. Last night, he
delivered a talk on the prospects of controlling theAIDS
epidemic to a full house in the
Pearson-Hall Theater.
Unpretentious and possessing a boyish charm, Ho's casual demeanor makes him
extremely approachable. He
sat down to talk with Phoenix editors yesterday afternoon.

display in the lobby of McCabe Library. The exhibit, entitled Inside Tibet 1996, is part of the William J. Cooper Foundation Focus on Tibet, a series of events on Tibetan religion, culture, politics, and human rights issues
that runs throughout September.
This Friday at 8:00 in the PearsonHall Theater, the Monks of the
Drepung Loseling Monastery, who
last year sold-out a theatre at Bryn

the key organizers of the Focus on Tibet, first envisioned the series as a way
to begin increasing the presence of
Asia on campus. Although we may not
always realize it, "Asia is a thriving
part of everyone's culture," she says.
She was also interested in looking at
regions ofAsia not normally dealt with
in Swarthmore's curriculum (proposed
for next year is a series on Southeast
Asia). But primarily, Graybill hopes
that these events will unify two of
Swarthmore's most admirable traditions, scholarship and activism. "We
need to understand that there are intersections between the two, not so that
we at Swarthmore can necessarily try
to resolve everyone's problems, but so
that we can be aware of what's going
on."

Student Council has suffered its second setback since the beginning of the
semester as yet another member has
announced her resignation.
Trang Pham 'OO, Community Resources Center (CRC) coordinator of
SC, made public her decision to resign in an email to council members
last Sunday and The Phoenix.
This is the second resignation in a
row for SC this year, following hot
on the heels of the departure of Cochair and Outreach Chair-designate
Mandara Meyers '99 last week.
While Pham was quick to emphasize that her decision did not derive
from a loss of faith in SC, she conceded, nevertheless, that she was
somewhat disappointed in SC by the
end of last year. "I just didn't agree
with a lot of the decisions which were
made about this year," said Pham. In
her resignation letter, she also hinted
at a decline in enthusiasm on her part.
"...I firmly believe that the
Swarthmore community deserves
much more than a half-hearted attempt at student leadership and I hope
the new coordinator will be able to
serve that role," wrote Pham.
On the other hand, Pham cited a
variety of personal matters that contributed to her decision to resign. She
felt that because of her involvement
in SC, she could not devote enough
time to her interest in community
work. "I haven't been dong a lot of
stuff I love doing," remarked Pham.
"It's like there's a part of me that I
haven't kept in touch with." As part

Peterkin named All-American
By

Dan Fanaras

Like most members of the
class of2000, Desired Peterkin
'OO was far away from the
Swarthmore campus during
the third week of May. Her
classes were over and her exams were complete. After a
long first year as a Swarthmore
student, one final challenge
remained in her path before
summer break could begin
the NCAA Division 111 national track and field championships held at the University
ofWisconsin-LaCrosse.
It was raining and surprisingly cold for the month of
May during the final round of

competition in the triple jump.
A large crowd of unfamiliar
spectators watched as Peterkin
completed the final jumps of
her season.
After a few minutes it was
all over
her Bth place finish earned her All-American
status. She became the only
African-American woman to
be named All-American in the
sport of track and field in the
history of Swarthmore College.
Peterkin's performance in
May was an impressive conclusion to a difficult year as a
track and field athlete. During
the month of October, her athletic career came to a halt af-

horse controversies over political
correctness, members of the college
community still play the "more sensitive and enlightened than thou"
card too often for comfort. While
many of us came to Swarthmorefor
its liberal and progressive stance
toward the world, few of us came
to avoid challenging our intellectual and moral perspectives.
The lack of thoughtful engagement with conservative campus
voices is one symptom of the malaise caused by Swarthmore's cult
of sensitivity. Although we often
hold up the few conservatives on
campus as effigies, to bum as we
please, such attacks rarely include
serious self-reflection on
liberalism's behalf.
Liberalism's historically entrenched power here prevents the
apostles of tolerance from tolerating the inappropriate or ignorant
criticism leavened by right-leaning
students. Tolerance itself is a slippery value, though: flourished
when we agree with certain positions, and hurled against our enemies when we don't.
True tolerance means taking our
ideological opponents seriously,

we are not

We can say that the road to hell is
strewn with Republicans, but we
falter when asked to prove ourselves, or to explain why the road
to political salvation must be paved
with progressives. Is it enough to
say theright-wing is just pure evil?
Clearly not.
The underlying tenets of liberalism are compromised when liberals marginalize conservatives and
moderates on campus. When professors refuse to include both liberal and conservative readings in
their syllabi.we not only lose a valuable chance to confront our own political biases, but we also demonstrate our own intolerant views.
We are here to find ourselves, to
wrestle with our beliefs
not to
recite pious Leftist mantras we
never thoroughly examine. Maybe
it's hip to be Marxist, or maybe introspection demands too much humility from the saintly, but when
toothless satire becomes the only
credible, free-thinking alternative
to progressive orthodoxy, you know
you're in trouble.

It is with such a feeling of hope
and fear that we too begin the new
year. Like our predecessors, we are
new to this world of journalism. Yet,
like them, we share a vision of The
Phoenix becoming a professional
paper, one which is journalistically
sound, working to the best of interests of the College and the students,
while upholding the truthat all costs.
The truth is something we at
Swarthmore often talk about.

year that we have been here we have
discovered a trend of concealment
and coercion ofthe truth among both
the administration and students. A
very disheartening prospect, especially at a college that prides itself
on its sense of community.
To serve the betterinterests of the
community, we must stay in constant contact with it. Over the
course of the semster we hope
speak with various student groups
about their perception of the newspaper, and, hopefully, with you as

individuals. The most effective
means of communicating with us,
however, remains through letters.
We hope you will write, and write
frequently, addressing both the
paper's weaknesses and, hopefully,
more often than not, its strengths,
Through such efforts, we can create
anewspaper more representative ofthe
community, ready to serve its best interests.

Letters
Differing

to the Editor

student's experience is the key to a true exchange of ideas

In his 9/5 column, Damon Taaffe criticises how
Swarthmore has looked for diversity in its student body. The college, says Mr. Taaffe, has
sought racial heterogeneity and found political
uniformity. Ithas gained a student body ofmany
colors, but a student body with one set of
thoughts. We should value diversity, says Taaffe,
because it promises to advance the exchange of
ideas. Instead, our supposed diversity has deadened that very exchange.
Mr. Taaffe is right, if we take "the exchange
of ideas" to mean only political discourse, and
it is clear that this is what he cares about: "it
matters not," he concludes, "what color a person is or what she has lived through; ultimately,
people are a product of how they view the
world." But a consistent view of the world is
just what we as college students lack. And if we

do have one, such a view is likely to be immature, a product of exactly the kind of narrowed
vision that Mr. Taaffe decries. What we have
is our experiences, and it is from our experiences that a true exchange of ideas can arise.
Perhaps Mr. Taaffe has forgotten how uniform
whiteAmerica has become. We shop in the same
stores, watch the same movies, listen to the same
music. This uniformity matters more to how we
think and act and relate than the few hours each
month we spend being liberal or conservative.
Yes, college should help us become informed,
active citizens, and eventually we will have to
choose a political label for ourselves. But to do
so legitimately, we must not merely hone our
'liberal' against another's 'conservative.' We
must first come to know what those labels mean,
by seeing them from a perspective outside than

School should watch for predatory peddlers
September 3, in tarble, in place of the usual tshirt and record sales, i encountered a young
man from AT&T signing students up for "AT&T
Universal [credit] Cards." His table was littered
with promotional goods stuffed animals, sunglasses, hats, water bottles, slinkies. his pitch:
"have you signed up yet? you get free stuff."
The application was decorated at the top with
smiling sporty alternative student types, around
a logo "WHAT U WANT." A few students took
him up on his extended clipboard, asking a few
questions; his answers emphasized the lack of
committment and the free stuff. I heard one student, as he was filling in the credit card application, ask, "what's a finance charge?"
I felt strongly that there needed to be a sober
presence on hand; I made some signs and spoke
some, decrying his chicanery, and encouraging
students to respect choosing a credit card as a
big decision.
Perhaps 18 year old american college students
should be expected to know such things. Perhaps, as some students argued to me, they were
old enough to make these choices. Recently, I
have heard stories from friends, and seen in the
press: credit card companies are targetingpeople
without good money management skills (ie, the
young) to start theminto debt earlier. This man,
this company was on our campus offering
slinkies and stuffed animals to students who
signed up for credit cards.
-

When I asked how he had permission to be here,
he reported that "AT&T has paid the college a lot
of money." If that is the case, then Swarthmore is
taking monies indirectly from AT&T's other indebt college students to permit AT&T to coerce
Swarthmore students into debt.
Swarthmore is condoning this crass solicitation by allowing it to continue, i urge that the
school prohibit credit card companies from urging their usury on the students in such a callous
fashion.

that in which we grew up. The task given to
Swarthmore is not to ensure that liberals are surrounded with non-liberals, but rather to allow
students to become true liberals, genuine conservatives, citizens aware of a larger community and alive to its diversity.
Jacob Hartog 'OO

Taaffe off kilter, cultural mix a harbinger
of diversity
Damon Taaffe's thinking on diversity ("Diversity must be thought out" 9/5/97) misses the
point on several key issues. Not once in his article does he mention the word "culture", which
it would seem, is the target for diversification
here. It just so happens that ethnicity and culture are virtually inextricably bound in race-conscious modern day America, making ethnicity
a workable, though certainly imperfect, standard
for goals of diversification. Taaffe mentions that
Swaithmore has been a bastion ofliberal thinking despite it's historical homogeneity. I would
argue that the liberal thinking of the past would
probably been of a higher quality had it been
formulated with greater input from those who
were the subject of the liberal thinking itself.
Taaffe points out that "cognitive diversity" is
the key; this is obvious. However, we have
learned in the recent past that there is no better
guarantor of true cognitive diversity than that
provided by the members of different cultures
in coalition contributing their different viewpoints to the collective discourse; which is not
to say that it is a perfect guarantor. (I am not an
advocate ofradical relativism.) Taafe writes that
"no two people's lives are ever identical enough
to realize the threat of cognitive homogeneity."
This is simply incorrect. If this were the case,
we wouldn't have to worry about seeking out
cognitive diversity in the first place because it
would be infinitely abundant.
Taaffe is right when he says diversity must be
thought out everything has to be thought out,
after all. His conclusion, though, that cognitive
diversity is somehow undermined by present diversity standards, is not very well thought at all.

Trang Pham, CRC Coordinator resigns; second resignation in as many weeks
To Student Council and the Swarthmore student body,
This letter signifies my official resignation
from Student Council as the CRC coordinator.
Since my election to Council last winter, I have
tried to fulfill my duties to the best of my abilities. However, I no longer feel that I can effec-

tively serve Council or the student body in this
position. I hope that SC will respect my decision, as it has not been easy to leave an organization I love. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that
the Swarthmore community deserve much more
than a half-hearted attempt at student leadership
and I hope that the new coordinator will be able

to serve that role. With the recent election of

Sarah Pheasant as Co-Chair and the continued
leadership ofremaining Council members, I am
confident that SC will still accomplish many
goals this semester.

Unbearable
Heaviness of a
Liberal Arts
by Ben Fritz
Education

Who

knew that the criti
cal thinking we learn
at Swarthmore would
prove so useful, and so
damning? Although I
value my education here immensely, when
thinking about using it in the outside world
I have always considered the ability to understand things I read or to communicate
effectively as paramount. This summer,
though, I began to consider the value of
the thinking skills we learn here in and of
themselves, as I encountered a world of
politics where
the type of
broad-based
thinking we
engage in at
Swarthmore is
rarely found.
I worked at a
well-run, effective liberal
think
tank
which had a real effect on political processes and at which I did substantive work
every poli-sci major's dream, right?
And indeed, I enjoyed my job immensely
and learned a lot from it. What I missed,
however, was a feeling that it all really mattered; that the type of fixing things around
the edges, which is all that organizations
like the one I worked at are usually capable

of achieving, makes a difference in the end.
And for that I mainly have my Swarthmore
education, which kept pushing me to look
at the big picture, to thank.
The big news in Washington this sumr
mer, for the eleven of you who were bored
enough to pay attention, was the balanced
budget/tax cut deal. Every interest group
in Washington was pushing for its own priorities to be included in the final plan, including big tax cuts or money for child
health or, in the case of my organization,
fairer distribution of tax and spending cuts.
In the end therewere victories for both liberals and conservatives. Liberals got money
for child health (spent in an awful way, but
at least it's there), tax cuts for the poor, and
some welfare-to-work money. Conservatives got big tax cuts which primarily benefit the rich and spending increases that do
not last for too long. What was missing in
all this debate over the details of the plan
was any consideration of why we were constrained by certain debate parameters or,
more fundamentally, why the political
game is played in the insane way that it is
played.
The parameters of the debate are set, of
course, by long term cultural trends which
are shaped by entities like the media and
other societal influences. Few political organizations focus on the long term, however. In Washington it is always what's go-

what trends are shaping
politics, that matters. It
will be a cold day in hell
before the McLaughlin
group explores how the belief that social security will
provide people our age with
no benefits came to take such a
firm hold. Serious attention will
not be paid until proposals are
on the table and it is too late to do much
besides change details or temporarily stop
change (a la health care). Nobody this summer was considering why balanced budget
mania was so prevalent or whether it was
wise to cut taxes as the government prepares for the heavy costs of the baby
boomer generation's retirement. The questions are always "how" we are going to
balance the budget or cut taxes or reform
health care and very rarely "why."
Even more fundamental "why" questions
such as "why do bills have to go through
committees and subcommittees where
chairmen rule like a medieval Lord of the
Manor" or "are interest groups funded by
foundations and businesses with agendas
really the best way to act on behalfof 'constituencies' to affect legislation?" need to
be asked. But the questioning of fundamental structures and reasons seems to be
found nowhere outside of academic bastions such as Swarthmore. The questions
need to be asked, but they seem to never
be considered outside ofacademic journals
that are not read by the people to whom
they should matter most.
This is why, in the end, my Swarthmore
education frustrated me so much this summer. I wanted to take pleasure in the effect
I and my organization were having, but I
couldn't help but realize that I was working in a bad debate structure within a very
flawed political system. I simultaneously
wanted to change everything and to just
give up. Given that the latter is so difficult
and will probably not happen in my lifetime, I now see how appealling the Academy is as a place where these issues can be
debated safely. After this summer I am both
disenchanted and excited about politics. I
don't know what my future will be, but I
now know that the insights I gain at
Swarthmore will make a life as a player
working within a predetermined system
very difficult to swallow.

light of this week's campus eel
ebration and educational effort
about Tibet, which I am very
pleased to see, I would like to spot
light a less publicized and less celebrity-lauded country struggling for a different type of autonomy.
Everyone knows about the GulfWar, and
manyknow that while theU.S. suffered less
than 100casualties during the 60 day battle,
over 100,000 Iraqis were killed— many of
them were civilians. This is horrible in itself, but the devastation the U.S. and other
U.N.nations have wrought upon Iraq in the
past 6 years is literally unheard of. The
American media has skirted the effects of
the 1991 U.N. sanctions against Iraq, but
relief organizations have documented the
death of one million Iraqi people
more
than 600,000 of them children
as a direct consequence of economic sanctions.
UNICEF reports that 4,500 children under
age 5 are dying each month from hunger
and disease.
The intention of these sanctions, which
limit the importation of everything from
pencils to prophylactics, is to deprive the
££
Iraqi population to
such an extent that
they revolt and
demand Saddam
Hussein's departure from dictatorship. The embargo
was imposed by
the UN over
Baghdad's refusal
to adhere to Gulf
War cease-fire
resolutions,.and it has been maintained in
the continuing dispute over Iraqi weapons
programs. Yet is it justified to starve millions of people in order to bring pressure
on the Iraqi government? The attempt at
coercive measures on Iraq is spuriously
based on the country's "threat to world
peace," yet the implemented sanctions
clearly violate the UN's own Universal
Declaration on Human Rights and the U.S.
Legal Code. Destroyed by U.S. bombing,
contaminated with depleted uranium, left
without adequate water, sanitation or medical services, and now threatened by the
most severe hyperinflation in the world,
Iraq hardly presents a "threat to world
peace". Since their implementation six
years ago, it is obvious that the sanctions
are not having the UN's desired effect.
Before the GulfWar, Iraq was one of the
most prosperous societies in the Middle
East in terms of cultural, academic and
social equality. Medical students came
from all over theArab world to attend toprate medical schools, and the hospitals provided the best health care in the Middle
East. Their health care was socialized and
all education was free.
Now there are no operating hospitals,

just medical facility shacks, and more than
50% of the schools have closed due to lack
of teachers and scarce funding. Over four
million Iraqi professionals have left the
country because there are no opportunities left for them.
The embargo has inhibited the importation ofspare parts, chemicals and the means
of transportation required to provide water and sanitation services to the civilian
population of
Iraq. Any substance that is
not food or basic medicine is
interdicted.
Even pencils
are prohibited
because
the
graphite might
be used to fashion a home-made weapon.
There is no electricity in most areas, no
functioning waste-water treatment plants
and the food industry is operating at only a
fraction of its pre-blockade level because
severe constraints relating to agricultural
machinery, food seeds and fertilizers have
resulted in a dramatic decline in agricultural out-put. Because the sanitation is so
poor, the spread of infectious diseases is
rampant. The situation gets worse and
worse, and even relief organizations
have to apply for
special licenses to
distribute a minimum of humanitarian aid. The
government decreases its food rations every month.

time situation.

You may be asking yourself, Why haven't
I heard about this? The tragedy is not only
that the media isn't covering it, but that human rights groups are also ignoring the
death and suffering ofmillions of Iraqis under a completely preventable circumstance.
While alternative musicians and movie
stars rally around the glamour of Tibetan
Buddhist aspirations for autonomy, and numerous human rights abuses are villified
by even "humanitarians" like Jesse Helms,
no one has mentioned the Iraqi people in
the last six years!
I attended a teach-in sponsored by the

Economic inequity and social justice contribute to this disproportion.
I believe that along with the privilege of participating in the workings of an elite institution comes a

Doing diversity well:
Sams is new BCC dean
By Andy Murray

As the new Assistant Dean and Director of
Swarthmore's Black Cultural Center, Timothy Sams talks about the importance of support groups with a mixture of energy, complex terminology and pride. Straightforwardly, he will say that he created one of the
best multicultural programs in the country
during his previous stint at Williams College.
He is equally straightforward in saying that
he now wants Swarthmore's BCC to be a
center that sets a national standard. "To be a
top institution we are going to have to do
diversity well, not just do it," says Sams.
It was Sams' energy and experience that
captivated a Swarthmore selection committee of students, faculty and staff last spring
as they pored over resumes and conducted
interviews with over 100 applicants for the
open position of Assistant Dean/Director.
"An Assistant Dean needs to be able to wear
a number of different hats," explains Intercultural Director and Assistant Dean Anna
Maria Cobo, who sat on the selection committee. "Tim had dealt with diverse types of
students at Williams, not justAfrican-American students, and he was very approachable.
When he visited, students seemed to connect
well with him."
Already demonstrating how well he knows
Swarthmore and its penchant for Quaker traditions, Sams says that "future plans for the
BCC will depend upon consensus. [But] one
thing I do know," he goes on to say, "is that
there will always be support for students academically, socially, spiritually and emotionally." Broadly, the new BCC Director says

September 12, 1997

head
Pham

that he has hopes for "a conversation about
supporting not just African-American students, but all students. About how we as a
campus are responsible for the entire campus." According to Sams, the prospect of initiating this conversation from within a center—and not just an office—was an advantage that drew him to the position at
Swarthmore. "I prefer to have a center because I can use it as a conduit to provide a
greater level of support."
The possibilities Sams saw for his work,
however, were not entirely overshadowed by
an interest he had in being close to a city like
Philadelphia. The prospect of being able to
go to a jazz or blues club, a good restaurant
or a spiritually supportive church weighed
heavily in Sams' decision to leave
Williamstown and come to Swarthmore.
Sams, who estimates he was one of only nine
African-American males in the Massachusetts college town, recalls a dearth of social
opportunities as well as repeatedly being
approached by the local media to comment
on issues of race and diversity. Then the Director of Williams' Multicultural Center,
Sams also severed his relationship with two
student newspapers after they printed inaccuracies about him that he felt "were not
unintentional."
But Sams brushes aside these experiences,
saying "the good feeling [he has] for Williams far outweighs what was bad." If the isolation he experienced in Williamstown has
had any impact on him, it only seems to have
been to reaffirm his belief in fully supporting students. "Support for students," Sams
notes, "needs to continue with sensitivity and
the same rigor it has always had."

Swat gets a dose of Tibet, Buddhism
from Tibet, p. I
The Chinese occupation
of Tibet that began centuries ago
came to a head in the 1950s when
the Chinese government put down
an insurrection and forced the Dalai
Lama, Tibet's spiritual and political leader, into exile. Since then,
China has sought to eradicate the
Tibetan identity, both by exiling
Buddhist monks from the country
and by simultaneously resettling
thousands of Chinese colonists on
Tibetan land. It has been estimated
that in the years since the invasion,
over 1 million Tibetans have been

killed, and hundreds of thousands

imprisoned.
What makes Tibet even
more intriguing is the amazing
draw that it has as a celebrity
cause. Richard Gere, a practicing
Buddhist, has long been campaigning to bring the plight of the
Tibetans to the attention of the
world. More recently, the Tibetan
Freedom Concerts organized by
the Beastie Boys in 1996 and
1997, and featuring such diverse
acts as A Tribe Called Quest,
Bjork, and Alanis Morissette, have
reportedly become the largest rock
& roll benefit

The accumulation of fat in obese men can make the breast

The gall of Seagal

By

Patrick Runckle

Since

his debut in 1988, Steven
Seagal has been a force to be reck
oned with in American action movies. Yes, he has conquered the minds and
hearts ofAmerica with his hardened demeanor, take-no-shit attitude, and martial
arts ability. Contrary to popular belief, his
movies are not all the same, and so here,
in honor of the release of Fire Down Below, his 10th motion picture, I've crafted
a guide to the cinematic world of Steven
Seagal.
It all began in 1987 when Seagal, a
famed martial arts instructor to the stars
was given a screen test by one ofhis aikido
students, Michael Ovitz. Ovitz just happens to be one of the most powerful agents
in Hollywood, and this screen test led to
Seagal's casting in the Andrew Davis'
1988 thriller Above The Law. Above The
Law was co-written by Seagal, who has
claimed that it accurately depicts parts of
his life.
I've never been a big fan of any movie
directed by Andrew Davis, and I think

Above The Law particularly exemplifies
why they stink: it's overlong, overburdened with a labyrinthine plot no one
cares about, and the pacing is slack. Still,
Seagal injects lots of life in the movie.
He plays tough Chicago cop Nico Toscani
who, of course, is one of the best ex-soldiers the country has ever seen. He discovers that the CIA is involved in dealing
drugs in America. Various fights, bombings, etc. ensue.
The movie rambles on forever, and
Seagal beats up legions of bad guys, but
the movie never comes together for any
virtuoso sequence. Even though it was a
big hit, Above The Law only merits a **.
In his next movie, 1990's Hard To Kill,
Seagal played Mason Storm, a renegade,
take-care-of-business cop who gets all
shot up at home by some bad guys at the
beginning of the movie, and then spends
seven years in rehab before going to blow
themall away. In short, it's a great movie.
It's classic Seagal territory, punctuated
with lots of great, vicious action, and unforgettable dialogue.
Hard To Kill was directed by Bruce
Malmuth, who also gave us 1981's priceless Nighthawks, which features Stallone
convincingly disguised as a woman on
two separate occasions. It was also a big
hit, and thankfully much more streamlined
and exciting than Above The Law. I give
it a big ****.
Steven was really on a roll in 1990,because with the turning of the leaves came
Marked For Death, another Seagal spectacular. In it, he plays tough DEA agent
John Hatcher, whose partner is killed in
Colombia after an undercover deal goes
sour. He quits the DEA and returns to
Chicago only to find that some serious
drug shit is going down in his old neighborhood, all tied to some nasty Jamaican
drug lords. He teams up with his old football coach (Keith David), and kicks some
drug-dealer ass!
Marked For Death has some amazing

The power to
change the world,
and sell your soul

action sequences in it, particularly a stupendous car chase through downtown Chicago that ends in a department store faceoff. This was Seagal's first collaboration
with cinematographer Ric Waite, who has
a special flair for shooting gritty action
movies. A mighty ****.
Seagal's true masterpiece came in 1991,
however, as Out For Justice took over the
box office. Out For Justice should genuinely be considered one of the best street
action movies ever, as it takes every cliche of the genre to a new, tougher level.
Hard-ass auteur John Flynn (whose Rolling Thunder, Best Seller, and Lock-up are
also high points of the genre) put together
a formidable package: gritty street locations, unbeatable tough-guy dialogue, and
a stunning emotional core. Ric Waite again
brings a special quality to the cinematography.
Seagal plays tough New York cop Gino
Felino, who goes into the city's underworld to take down a hardened criminal,
Richie Madano (William Forsythe).
Trouble is, Gino and Richie grew up in
the same neighborhood. The classic scenes
come right on top ofeach other; this flick
merits a heavenly *****.
1992 brought with it Seagal's biggest hit
to date, Under Siege. He reunited with director Andrew Davis, and, even though it
has its merits, this paltry Die Hard rip-off
doesn't hold a candle to Seagal's earlier
pictures.
Seagal plays Casey Ryback, a cook in
the navy who has a secret Navy SEAL
background. When the ship he's on gets
taken over by some officers turned bad,
Ryback must battle booby traps, bad guys,
and bulkheads to save the day.
Davis lets Seagal get completely upstaged by the bad guys, played with gusto
by Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, and
the static ship setting makes everything
less exciting. The movie also has a slack,

How I learned

The

worst part was having to face
my parents; to look at them and

admit that I was in a cult. The Al
Pacino Cult. They put me in counseling.
What else could they do? I was in an awful state, watching the entire Godfather
Trilogy daily, walking around muttering
"Fuggetaboutit" and "Hoo Hah!" My parents told me they hadn't had a meaningful
conversation with me in months. I tried to
tell them that "Fuggetaboutit" and "Hoo
Hah" pack all the meaning of great, dense
poetry. They didn't buy it. The counseling really helped too. I was so close. So
close. And then I heard that Donnie Brasco
was playing on campus this weekend and
all my bad habits came flooding back. "Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back
in!"
Anyway, I'm taking it upon myself (as a
cleansing ritual) to explain why an Al

Pacino movie is necessarily better than any
other. (This is only a general rule. There
are exceptions. Casablanca was a nice
little flick.) How to explain, for example,
Donnie Brasco? Despite seeming to have
everything going against it, Donnie Brasco
somehow emerges as a painfully beautiful
and sophisticated film. How could this
film, which was expected to be merely another cash in on the ever popular but neverchanging gangster genre, manage to push
all the right buttons?
Pacino's astonishing performance makes
Donnie Brasco. Pacino throws himselfinto
thie hellish life of Lefty, tapping frightening feelings of ineptitude which he sees
himself escaping through the friendship of
one man. Unfortunately, his escape is
through Donnie, who we know must in the
end betray him. One of the surprises of
his performance is that we forget we are
watching Pacino at all. There is nothing of
the huge abrasiveness we've come to expect from him. He carries himselfwith the
quiet depression he achieved so long ago
in Serpico and The Godfather. Pacino is
the only actor left from that generation still
willing to open himself up and stand emotionally naked in front of the camera and

you don't normally make a practice
of going to the movies, this may be a
weekend to do so. You will find two
actors known, first and foremost, for being Actors (as opposed to, say, Charlie
one a mob tale,
Sheen) in two movies
the other a coming-of-age flick —which
give you an idea
of what the movies are supposed
to be all about:
great storytelling
provoking great
emotion.
Friday night's
presentation is Donnie Brasco, based on
the true story of an undercover FBI agent
in the Seventies who infiltrated the mob.
The title is the alias of the undercover agent,
Joe Pistone, played well enough by Johnny
Depp to make you forget 21 Jump Street
once and for all. (But we can never, ever
forget Richard Greico!)The true main character, however, is Lefty, a middle-of-theroad mobster played by the great Al Pacino.

He gives a terrific presentation of Lefty,
alternately desperate and sage, relishing the
chance to be Donnie's sponsor and mentor
while deeply resenting it when Donnie
starts moving up the mob food chain.
Pacino does chew some scenery —he
wouldn't be Pacino if he didn't but the
best moments come at the end, when he
tells his Annette how beautiful she looks
and puts his favorite jewelry in a safe place.
If you've seen enough mobster movies, you
can guess why.
But be warned: Donnie Brasco is not a
typical mob picture. The director, Mike
Newell, takes the late-Seventies setting to
heart. It's not just that all the male characters have huge sideburns and go to discos;
there's a slippery, frightened feeling to the
film, as each character tries to claw his way
to the top and gets knocked down in turn,
a feeling that no matter how much cocaine
or how many guns or parking meters the
men find, it won't be enough. (And this is,
yet again, very much a male picture. Anne
Heche has a few scenes as Donnie's beleaguered wife, but she's obviously out of it.)
It's a grimy time of garbage strikes, rising

inflation, and general misery. The men
aren't even allowed to take comfort in their
friendships: as Lefty explains, the person
assigned to whack you is as likely to be
your best friend as not. If you ever felt a
desire to be a hoodlum, Donnie Brasco is
the movie to talk you out of it.
Donnie Brasco does suffer from a weak
ending, very graphic violence, and the
scenes with Heche add little to the picture,
so we're giving it an 7.
If you're not sick of guys named Sonny
after Donnie Brasco, you'll enjoy the adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's play, A
Bronx Tale. Besides writing the script for
this coming-of-age story, Palminteri gives
a sensitive, intense performance as a local
mob boss.
The story is fairly simple. 9-year-old Yankees fan Calogero (Fred Savage lookalike
Francis Capra) endears himself to his mafia
neighbor, Sonny (Palminteri), and Sonny
takes him in and treats him like a son.
Meanwhile, Calogero's bus driver father
Lorenzo (Robert De Niro), insists that his
son follow the straight and narrow, and

-

��.
Because Under Siege was an
enormous hit, Seagal could have
done anything, but instead of trying to make a great movie, he decided to celebrate himselfby directing and starring in one of the dumbest flicks ever made, On Deadly
Ground. In it, Seagal plays an oil
company employee (with a secret
CIA past, of course) who decides
that the oil company sucks when
they're about to screw over some
Eskimos and mess up the environment. So Seagal teams up with his
new Eskimo pals (and new Eskimo
babe played by Joan Chen) and
kicks a little oil company ass!
The concept is hilarious, but the
execution is dumb, boring, and incompetent. This movie spent forever in post-production because
apparently Seagal didn't quite turn
out to be David Lean behind the
camera, if you know what I mean.
The movie also makes no sense:
Seagal destroys an enormous oil rig
at the end of the movie so that the
oil company won't foul the environment. Don't you think blowing
that sucker up would put some oil
into the neighboring waters? But
it is notable for a ridiculous dream
sequence in which Seagal must
choose between some naked dancing chicks and an old Eskimo
woman who has the Wisdom of the
Ancients, as well as a windy mono-

logue Seagal gives at the end about
saving the environment. A measly

M.

On Deadly Ground flopped, and

Seagal went running to UnderSiege

an

Territory,
underappreciated epic. This time
around, Casey Ryback justhappens
to be with his niece on a train when
mad ex-military scientist Travis
Dane (wild-eyed Eric Bogosian)
hijacks it in order to get some secret code so he can shoot big new
lasers at things from outer space!
That won't do at all, of course, and
Seagal takes out tons of bad guys
before the film's fiery, explosive
climax!
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory is
great. It has the logic of a movie a
junior high schooler would produce, and it features some of the
worst special effects ever in a bigbudget motion picture. Seagal at
this point obviously thought he was
part of the Holy Trinity: He gets
shot and seems unaffected, no one
lays a hand on him for the entire
movie, and when he arrives there's
a big crescendo ofAmericana music. Yes, Under Siege 2 is a real
charmer. It also has a much better
sense of pacing and more action
than its predecessor. I'll give it a
quirky***s1996 saw Seagal in an inexplicable cameo in Stuart Baird's **
Executive Decision. He pops up for
a couple scenes near the beginning
as Col. Austin Travis, head honcho
of the team assigned to kick some
hijackers' asses when they take over
an American airlinerand try to blow

Gangster's Paradise

Calogero is stuck in the middle.
For me, the music really made the
film. Lots and lots of songs attempt
to capture the spirit of the times,
the narrator always mentions which
songs and what musical style was
popular. Music is melded with action with startling results; just like
in Donnie Brasco, horrible beatings
are interwoven with incongruous
pop songs, and produce an appropriately jarring effect.
This is not a subtle movie; the
film's meanings are righ out there
for anyone to see, and there's even
a moral at the end, as befits any
good tale. As the title suggests, it's

from Godfather, page 5
when he does so, we see some
completely different person.
Watch the way he shivers in
this movie, or the way he
slumps in his chair, or the way
he struts like a grade school
shrimp trying to show the
bully that he's tough. He acts
with his whole body, seeming
to move to the heavy rhythms
of the street. Pacino's intuition is on the money, endowing Lefty with just the right
degree of humanity so that we
can fully understand Donnie's
disorientation while still
never letting us forget that he
is a killer. This is not unfa-

miliar territory for Pacino.
Although we are now
twenty years removed from
his most remarkable performances, Pacino still has the
desire and ability to create a
soul for each ofhis characters
and in doing so, often overwhelms a film with the force
ofhis introspection. He forces
very typical films to be noticed, offering something fascinating for audiences to
watch. This is why a Pacino
cult exists. He is capable of
and regularly achieves these
moments of rare power and
eloquence that movies sorely
miss.

scenes of Seagal being nice to a
bunch of hicks, Seagal beating up
with one motion anyone who dares
take him on, and Seagal romancing the only cute chick in town,
played by Marg Helgenberger.
Then, suddenly, out of left field, we
see the Seagal kicking a little oldschool ass. It's a stunning return to
form, but it comes too late to save
this misguided movie, and the audience is left unsatisfied.
One thing I did love about Fire
Down Below, however, was the performance ofStephen Lang '75. He
gets third billing after the title, I
think, and it's exciting seeing him
play the cold-stare villain again like
he did in January's stupendously
terrible Shadow Conspiracy.
Fire Down Below also features a
whole bunch of country songs cocomposed and performed by Seagal
himself. (Can his solo album be far
behind?) Out For Justice and Under Siege 2 also had Seagal songs,
but he really went all out this time,
with about 11 songs to his credit
on the soundtrack. I know that I
would gladly pay money just to see
him sing, but unfortunately he only
plays guitar; he really is multi-talented.
So, I'm giving Fire Down Below
a *** just because it was goodnatured and fun.
I'm out of space and Seagal is out
ofmovies. Check him out next year
in The Patriot, in which he plays a
doctor who has to defend his family from terrorists. And I hear Under Siege 3 is right around the corner too. Yes, Seagal is here to stay.

a fairy tale, complete with monstrous mob enforcers, a man cursed

one guiding principle: poetic justice. The actors are excellent, and
the characters themselves are not
as clear-cut as they first appear: De
Niro's upstanding, devout father is
a closet racist, while Sonny is a tolerant, educated man.
A Bronx Tale is funny at times, sad
at times, and often moving. It has the
feel of a tribute to the neighborhood
where Palminteri grew up, and it
does a good job of bringing us back
to an earlierperiod of doo-wop, jukeboxes, and down-to-earth crime

up Washington, D.C. But Col.
Travis dies before he really gets to
do anything. I heard that lots of
audiences cheered when Seagal bit
the dust. I was in tears.
Also in 1996 was The Glimmer
Man, which was a bad actionmovie rip-off of Seven. Seagal
plays tough LA cop Jack Cole, who
has a new partner (Keenan Ivory
Wayans), and must investigate a
series of ritual killings, which may
be tied to Cole's mysterious CIA
past. I don't think anyone was really in top form on this movie, as
director John Gray seems unable to
make any sequence come alive.
Notable only for a scene in which
Seagal walks into a store in LA's
Chinatown and mumbles some
Chinese at the store owners. -k-k\.
Released just last Friday was Fire
Down Below, the latest Seagal epic,
but, sadly, this one didn't quite
measure up to expectations; it's a
whole lot more smoke than it is
Fire. In it, Seagal plays EPA marshal Jack Taggart, who travels to
rural Kentucky when one of his
EPA pals turns up dead. He poses
as a carpenter who lives at a church
(Jesus Christ?) and helps the poor
by rebuilding their homes while
also investigating reports of fish
kills due to a big mining operation,
run by big baddie Kris
Kristofferson, whose facial reconstructive surgery, I'm happy to report, appears to have gone well.
Fire Down Below meanders along
for about an hour and ten minutes
before picking up any steam at all.

Wrack athelete

brming the way she did at Strath
Javen High School. During her
enior year there Peterkin was
anked third in the state of Penniylvania in the triple jump.
.A native of New York City,
'eterkin spent four years of high
ichool living in the borough of
Swarthmore on a scholarship from
he Strath Haven chapter of the A
tetter Chance (ABC) program. The
jrogram prepared her college, she
jays, because it allowed her the opjortunity to live like a college stujent away from home. Still, she re:alls the transition from high school
;o college stating "change doesn't
some easy."
Fortunately, Peterkin was able to
depend on the support her boyfriend and fellow track runner Am>er Thompson '97. He strengthsned her confidence as the track
season progressed, she recalls. After-regaining theconfidence shehad
in high school, Peterkin's track performances improved significantly.
During the outdoor season she
qualified for nationals in the triple
jump along with teammate
Catherine Laine '9B.
Describing the chance to compete
in athletics at Swarthmore she says
"yOu do it because you enjoy it not
because you have to," Balancing
academics with athletics is a task
for all athletes here and fortunately
the coaches are understanding
about it, she notes.
Majoring in Political Science and
Education Peterkin hopes to be
teaching in the years ahead. Last
year she was on the Executive
Board of the Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Student Society (SASS).
Peterkin is also an accomplished
dancer, having performed professionally at the Harlem Theater of
Dance in New York.
Peterkin— describes
the
Swarthmore track and field team as
a;family. She recalls hearing the
comforting voices of head coach
Ted Dixon, Laine, and Thompson
screaming "she did it..." in unison
after jumping her way to AilAmerican recognition at the meet

Successful season opener for cross country
By

Patricia Barrientos

The Swarthmore men's and
women's cross country team
opened their season at the
Ursinus College Invitational
on Saturday September 6 in
Woods,
Hunsberger
The
women's
Collegeville.
team topped their divisional
rival, Haverford, for the first
time in Coach Ted Dixon's
tenure. The men's team came
in third, behind Haverford and
Ursinus.
The top women runners
were Danielle Wall '9B (2nd),
Joko Asunloye 'Ol (3rd), and
Alissa Parmalee 'Ol (Bth).
The top men were Mark
Neilman 'Ol (13th), Wyn
Strodtbeck '9B (15th), and
Sam Evans'ol (16th).
"The hilly course was short
but the pace was slow.. .1 expected to get under 14 [minutes]" said Karen Lloyd'OO,
who was not far off from that
goal. This extremely hilly

course slowed don many runners who were not accustomed to this unique race. As
for the men, Sam Evans 'Ol
said "The race went pretty
well. We finished mostly in a
tight pack, which is good."
The positive results from the
meet were well received and
perhaps unexpected at this
time in the season. Co-captain Danielle Wall was
pleased and confident. She
said "It's only the beginning
of the season and everyone is
looking strong and ready to

race."
Wall and Lloyd emphasized
that the strength of the team
lies on their midpack runners,
which may make the Garnet
Tide a team to watch. The
future of the men's team is
looking bright with the incoming frosh, which make up
a larger part of the team.
Although the team has lost
veteran runners, some who
even reached Nationals last

year, this year's team appears
to be very strong. "The team
did phenomenal...and the
combination of the new frosh
and veterans is going to surprise a lot of teams." said
Wall.
The depth and strength of
the team continues to develop
with this year's freshman
class. Among the new comers
are Asunloye, Cristina
Cardemil,
Parmalee,
Ambrose Dierenge, Evans,
and Neilman. The impact of
the class of 'Ol was immediate as three frosh women
placed in the top 14 runners
overall as well as two of the
three top Swat women runners. Neilman and Evans impact was promising as they
placed alongside senior captain Wyn Strobeck.
With a successful first meet
under their belt, the Garnet
Tide is ready and the rest of
the conference should be on
the look-out.

The game's
final score

Opening their season with a shutout, the field hockey team got off
to an explosive start this week. On

was 4-0.

Saturday, the Garnet blew Goucher
away, 6-0. Elizabethtown also fell
to Swat, 4-1.
The contest against Goucher was
a mostly one-sided one. Kristen
English 'Ol said of the opposition,
"Goucher was a young team whose
game seemed based more on aggression than skill. The fact that
they only had one sub also went
against them." Julie Finnegan 'OO
scored in the first minutes of the
game, and the Garnet never looked
back from there. Holly Baker '99
and Danielle Duffy '9B each pushed
one past the goalkeeper in the first
half to give the team a comfortable
half-time lead. Lurah Hess '99,
Michelle Walsh '9B, and Krista
Hollis 'Ol, playing in her first collegiate game, all scored in the second half. In addition, Duffy assisted
on four goals, and Baker and
Finnegan picked up an assist each
in the outing.
Maureen Vernon 'Ol said, "I think
With the disappointment of the previous game we accomplished the goals that we

Under new head coach Peter Dicci, the men's soccer team was hoping torebound from last year's disappointing season. Unfortunately, the Garnet dropped
all three contests this past week and saw its overall
record fall to 0-4 on the season.
The Garnet had looked forward to the Drew Tournament this past weekend. In their opening game, the
men's soccer team faced Colby-Sawyer on Saturday
afternoon. Team members were both anxious and
nervous about playing on the artificial turfplaying surface. The energy level was high throughout the first
half as the Garnet took a 1-0 lead on a goal by sophomore Marcus Shin. In a scramble in front of the goal,
Shin was able to find the back of the net for the only
goal of the half.
The second half was a different story. ColbySawyer outplayed the Garnet for the rest of the game,
scoring three goals to the disappointment of the men's
soccer team, and subjecting Swarthmore to the consolation game of the tournament.

The women's soccer team roared
into the Swarthmore Kick Classic last
weekend with a tremendous start to the
season. On Saturday the Garnet Tide
beat Goucher College on Clothier
field with a score of4-2, a higher scoring game for Swarthmore than any in
recent memory.

Two of the captains, Sara Jaquette and
Betsy Rosenbaum, each scored a goal in
the second half, to follow up on Junior
Kirstin Knox's goal in the first half and
first-year Heather Marandola's amazing
diving header.
The captains also commended sophomore Rebbeca Shmidt and first-year Sarah Jay for playing a strong defensive
game. First-year Sari Altschule did a fantastic job as goalie given the absence of
last year's starting goalie who is abroad.
On Sunday, the team lost to Kutztown
3-1, which is a slim margin compared to
the most loss to the Division II school
with a score of 7-0. Captain Rosenbaum
scored the team's goal with an assist from
Kirstin Knox. The Tide also played a
game against Widener, another Division
II team, last Wednesday at 4:00 pm on
Clothier field, in which the team lost 9-

The team has had to cope with some
recent injuries. Captain Claire Baxter
suffered a foot injury in the first game
and may be out for one to two weeks,
and on Sunday, junior mid-fielder Amy
Markey injured her wrist.
Swat will play Pomona-Pitzer at
4:oopm on Friday, and Misericordia at
2:oopm on Saturday, making this quite
a long weekend for the women's soccer
team.

The Tide will be playing its first conference game next Wednesday, the 17th,
against Ursinus, and next weekend, the
women's soccer team will go to the annual Seven Sisters tournament, which
will take place at Vassar this year.
The captains feel very optimistic about
this year. "Our offense is a lot stronger
this year," said Rosenbaum. "The stra-

tegic transition between the backs and
forwards is working really well,"
Jaquette said, "we are really working like
a unit."
The co-captains also felt enthusiastic
about the positive personality ofthe team
members. "The team is getting along
well and the freshmen are psyched" said
Jaquette. "We also have good class representation," said Rosenbaum, "and this
well-roundedness should do well for the
team's unity on and off the field."
Overall, the team looks very good this
year and the captains are excited for the
season. "The team lost a lot of close
games last year; I expect we'll wiivill
of those games this year," said
Rosenbaum, "We should in fact hit at
least .500." "We're playing at a much
higher level this year," said Jaquette,
"This is definitely much better soccer.'
