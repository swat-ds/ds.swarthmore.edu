Obama speaks at Strath Haven HS; Swat originally a possibility
BY lAN YARETT

iyarettl@swarthmore.edu

On Wednesday, April 2, Democratic presidential candi-

date Barack Obama spoke at a rally held in the gymnasium
of Strath Haven High School in nearby Wallingford, Pa. The
event took place on the last day ofObama's six-day bus tour
of Pennsylvania. According to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l, the Obama campaign had considered
Swarthmore College as a possible venue for the event.
Eldridge said that the college was contacted less than a
week before the event occurred. "[The campaign] wanted
space for at least 1500 people very quickly
we couldn't handle it logistically," he said, citing a variety of constraints,
including space, security and parking limitations.
"I've actually been trying to get Senator Obama to come to
Swarthmore for years, but as his popularity grew, it became
harder and harder," Eldridge said.
According to an Oct. 12, 2006 article in The Phoenix, the
college declined to host an event that would have brought former President Bill Clinton to Swarthmore to speak in support of Joe Sestak's bid for Congress, citing short notice and
bad timing for Swarthmore students as a result of mid-term
exams.
However, two years before, in 2004, the college agreed to
host Howard Dean, who was then running for the presidency. "During the Howard Dean event, LPAC was packed,"
Eldridge said. "The college bussed people from the mall
but there was more notice, and fewer security issues. This
time [with the Obama event] there would be much more
Secret Service."

Eldridge also said that politicians are always shopping
around for venues, and that the campaign considers a variety
of venue options to choose what best suits their needs. "It
probably is worth it [to hold an event of this nature] if you
think you can pull it off," Eldridge said. "It isn't our decision
[the campaign is] shopping around."
Ultimately, the Obama campaign chose to hold the
event at Strath Haven High School. Strath Haven seniors, and some juniors, were given the opportunity to
attend the event. "I think it was great to have it at a high
school it's a great political experience for juniors and
seniors," Eldridge said.

Professor of Economics and Vice President of the
Swarthmore-Wallingford School Board Mark Kuperberg said

that he was contacted by politicians in Delaware County who
are close to the Obama campaign about the possibility of
hosting the rally at the high school. "They contacted me the
Sunday night before the Wednesday event," he said. "I then
contacted the superintendent, who contacted the principal of
[Strath Haven High School]. The woman who called me had
said that 12 [potential venues] had turned her down I think
Swarthmore was one of them," Kuperberg said.
According to Kuperberg, an advance team from the
Obama campaign conducted a walk through of the venue to
see if it was appropriate. Later on, the Secret Service did
another walk through to ensure that adequate security could
be maintained, and to determine appropriate locations for
the metal detectors as well as other logistics.
On Tuesday, an Obama team came in to set up, which
included putting up the banners, creating the podium and
establishing a wireless Internet connection for the news
crews. "We gave them the space, and they took over,"
Kuperberg said, explaining that the school had to do no more
than pull out the bleachers, and the campaign handled the
rest. "The Obama people, when they go into a venue, have a
whole team that puts everything together," he said.
"We weren't in any way endorsing Obama," Kuperberg
said. "From my perspective, it was only about free speech
and having students see pretty amazing people."
Several other Swarthmore faculty and students, in addition to Kuperburg, were able to attend the event. Professor of
Political Science Carol Nackenoff was seated on the stage
along with Richard Wicentowski, associate professor of computer science. "Rich and I were asked if we wanted the last
couple of seats on stage. Perhaps they thought I was in the
...

Hillary demographic," Nackenoff said. "It also seemed like
they were trying to get an age and race mix on stage."
As a political scientist, Nackenoff noted Obama's readiness to throw money at virtually every problem and his
delivery of lots of promises to lots of constituents. However,
she said she was impressed with the amount of time Obama
spent discussing policies.
Cristina Herrera 'OB was very excited to attend the event.

Albright speaks

Bryn Mawr in

Former Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright appeared at Bryn Mawr
College Wednesday afternoon in support
of Hillary Clinton's campaign for.the
Democratic presidential nomination.
Ms. Albright, currently a professor at
Georgetown University, began her
remarks by noting, "The world is a

mess."
She identified five major issues facing the next American president: how to
fight terrorism without creating more
anti-Americanism, how to solve problems of nuclear proliferation, how to

restore a good name to democracy
abroad, how to mitigate the negative
aspects of globalization and how to
address the concerns of global warming
and climate change.
Democrat or Republican, Clinton or

Obama, she noted that these issues are
unavoidable and, to her thinking, will
become the primary talking points ofall
the candidates in the 2008 election.
Further, she noted that the next president will need to resolve the burgeoning crises stemming from the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan.
Not only are the domestic problems
of those countries problematic, but she
claims that they have led to consider-

THE PHOENIX

the safety of Iraqis. "He gave a long answer and beat around
the bush, but said that he wants out in 16 months," Herrera
said. "He said that we need to up humanitarian aid, and that
military occupation will not create peace so we must create
political stability."

Nackenoff said that Obama gave a good response to a
question from a high school student who said that socialized
medicine had killed his grandmother and asked about
Obama's plans for healthcare reform. "[Obama explained]
that he was in no way proposing socialized medicine, and
handled this student's and most questions pretty well," he
said. "He spoke like a professor," Nackenoff said. "He sounded like an academic, but a fairly exciting one nonetheless."
According to Herrera, Obama gave nuanced answers to
very complicated problems, but did not shy away from giving
the hard truth at certain times. For example, someone told
Obama that they were laid off and their job was shipped to
Mexico, and asked him what he would do about this problem.

Herrera said that Obama was very honest that some of these
jobs were not coming back, but that we can invest more in
infrastructure, which will open up many jobs that cannot be
moved abroad. "A lot of questions were very 'this is my problem in life and how can you fix it,' but he was clear about
what he can do and what he can't," Herrera said.
"He was so charismatic, humble, very bright and very
confident," Herrera continued. "He said that there are so
many things that we can do, like buying more 'squiggly light
bulbs.' He called them 'squiggly light bulbs' people loved
that. He was very good at making people believe in him."
Herrera also said that she is still a huge supporter of
Obama. "Every candidate has flaws [Obama] is not perfect,
and to an extent he is a politician he knows everyone is
sick of the war, everyone knows some people who have died.
I really do think that he wants to have a government that

serves the people."
Adora Andy, a deputy press secretary for Obama in
Pennsylvania, declined to provide any details regarding the
choice of venue for the Obama event that was held at Strath
Haven last week, but said that the Strath Haven event was
very successful and provided Delaware County residents
with the opportunity to hears Obama's plan. "[Obama]
said it was very fulfilling for him to interact with [the
attendees]," Andy said. "All of Pennsylvania is very important
not just cities but also areas outside of the cities
such as Delaware County."

BRIEF

of Hillary Clinton, points to instability in Pakistan and Iran as key issues

able instability in both Pakistan and
Iran.
Ms. Albright's presentation took a
turn for the personal in discussing both
her criticism of the Bush administration
and her support of Senator Clinton. Her
analysis of the foreign policy failings of
the Bush administration centered on
two ideas: that President Bush's policies
have been both unilateral and unidimensional.
First, she argued that "going it alone"
is not a reasonable solution to the problems of Iraq, Iran and North Korea.
Second, and more concerning, she
argues that the Bush administration
has, in all but a few instances, allowed
Africa and Latin America to fall to the
side.
Citing the emergent crises in Kenya
and Zimbabwe and the resurgence of
totalitarianism in Latin America following the end of the Clinton administration, Secretary Albright claimed that
the Bush administration's fixation on
the problems of the Middle East have led
to the neglect of less media-genic problems elsewhere.
On the subject of Senator Clinton's
candidacy, Albright focused on her experiences with Mrs. Clinton while serving

first as United States ambassador to the
United Nations, and then as Secretary of
State.
Drawing a comparison to Eleanor
Roosevelt, she remarked that Mrs.
Clinton made a habit of "digging deep
and getting very interested in the
issues."
In a statement that resonated with
the primarily female Bryn Mawr audience, Albright applauded Mrs. Clinton's
strong track record on women's issues,
including her remarks in China as first
lady that "women's rights are human
rights, and human rights are women's
rights."
Responding to criticism that Senator
Clinton's experience as first lady was
limited exclusively to women's issues,

she characterized such remarks as
extremely insulting to women, and ignorant of the role of women internationally.

In closing her prepared remarks, she
that she would support
Senator Clinton's candidacy whether or
not she had worked in the Clinton
administration, and that "it would be
revolutionary to have the first woman
president of the United States, but also
to have her be the single most qualified,

New system, blocks for housing WEEK IN PICTURES
BY MATT BLEIMAN

mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

Housing for the 2008-2009 academic
year will be slightly different than in previous years. The changes being made are

the inclusion of the newly constructed

David Kemp Hall, the change in occupancy numbers for the Lodges from five to
four students, the change in one-room
doubles into singles in Strath Haven, the
removal of Mary Lyon basement from the
housing lottery and the expansion of gender-neutral bathrooms. There has also
been a change made to the lottery itself.

David Kemp Hall will be ready to

house students next year. "All of it is at

least on schedule and there are pieces
that are a little ahead of schedule so it is
moving right along," said Coordinator of
Residential Life Liz Derickson 'OL
Furniture is expected to be delivered in
the middle of May to bring the new dorm
to life.

"We wanted peoplewanting a gender neutral
space to live to not have to
have a very good lottery
number to pick into [them.]"
Mark Kharas 'OB
Mary Lyon RA
A key project of the committee was
assigning blocks to David Kemp Hall. "We
looked at what we thought would be the
best blocking arrangements based on
where rooms worked together and where
it was conducive to having a group of
friends together," said housing committee
member Mark Kharas 'OB. The housing
committee assigned a four-person block
of two doubles that is intended for sophomores on the second floor ofDavid Kemp.
The committee also has been working
to greatly expand gender-neutral housing
options on campus. In the past, most of
the gender-neutral spaces have been off
campus. "We wanted people who have a
very strong feeling about wanting a gender neutral space to live to not have to
have a very good lottery number to pick
into those spaces," said Kharas. They

have worked with the administration to
make all of Willets gender-neutral housing but still have gendered bathrooms on
all floors, except for the basement.
David Kemp's first floor will be a gender-neutral hall and have a gender-neutral bathroom. "The physical space
requires it because the first floor halls
aren't connected, so if it was single sex
bathrooms you would have to go outside,"
said housing committee member Karen
Minyety

'OB.

Due to the addition of David Kemp,
Mary Lyon's basement is going to become
overflow housing. This means that the
rooms in Mary Lyon basement will not be
on the table during the lottery but may be

used if extra rooms are needed due to a
difference in students going abroad dur-

fall and spring semesters. Minyety
said, "No one really chooses to live in ML
basement and given that we have a new
dorm we didn't feel it was necessary to
make people live there anymore."
Kharas, who is also the current
ing

Resident Associate for Mary Lyon basement, said, "ML basement is not a very
good or desirable place to live [in] and I

think it is good that it is being eliminated
in favor of David Kemp."
According to Kharas, there is a storage
area in the middle wing of the basement
that creates a separation between the
two residence hallways, which he sees
as another good reason for why the basement will become overflow housing.
The extra rooms created by David
Kemp haVe also allowed the housing
committee to change some of the oneroom doubles in Strath Haven into singles. "We've often had juniors and seniors who have clamored for those to be
singles but we didn't have the space to

cut them down to singles so I think
that's an exciting change,"
said

Derickson. The rooms will also allow the
administration to turn the lounges,
which are currently acting as dorm
rooms in Dana and Hallowell, back into
lounges.

Another change will allow the Lodges
to house four students to a lodge instead
of five. The first floor of a lodge is a
triple and the second floor is a double.
Derickson explained that often, students
felt cramped and have attempted to live
in the basement, which is considered
unsafe to live in.
"Initially we thought we might use
the space differently, but there was a
strong response from students that they
really liked the Lodges and it is a unique
living situation that is not really replicated elsewhere," said Derickson.
The location of the living space, close
to the center of campus, was another
incentive for the decision to keep students living in the Lodges. Derickson
thinks the change to an occupancy of
four is a good solution in order to keep
the Lodges as housing option. "We're
excited about being able to keep them in
the housing pool but hopefully make
them a slightly better living situation,"
she said.
In addition to the changes in housing,
the lottery has also been slightly
revamped. There had been some concerns
over the fairness of the cohort system,
where students may be in the top or bottom of their cohort all three years.
Another concern was that while the
blocking system used each individual's
first cohort, the "value" of a given room
attained in a block could very well be no
better than a room that someone who
received a lower number in the lottery
could have achieved. "There were some
critical thinkers thinking about ways
that we could make the system more fair,"
said Derickson.

Students of Tamagawa University's Taiko Drumming and Dance Group, one of the top
ranking taiko groups in Japan, perform in the Lang Concert Hall this past Sunday.

"Two very clever computer science
experts, Maggie Ladlow 'O9 and George
Dahl 'OB, developed a computer program
that represents some of the basic fundamentals of the cohort system but it goes a
step further in that it tries to give everyone as close as possible an average for all
three years and pushes students who
blocked up only a little," she said.
The program is designed to distribute

lottery numbers so that students who

block off of a very bad lottery number
will not be treated the same way as students who got their first choice block.
This change is effective for the class of
2010. The housing committee worked hard
in the past year to implement these
changes and make housing as good as pos-

sible for the students.
"What we discussed is more on just
how to use the spaces that we had and
how to make the housing and living experience at Swarthmore as best as it can
be," Kharas said.

Panel on Iran challenges popular conceptions of the Islamic Republic
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu
On Monday afternoon, Representative Joe Sestak (DPa.) joined two experts on the Middle East from prominent, Washington-based think tanks to discuss future

relations between Iran and the United States. The
panel's participants cited flawed foreign policies, a consolidation of conservative control across the Middle East
and a lack of strong-handed diplomacy as factors that
have crippled efforts to negotiate an agreement between
the two countries.
The event, one of the highlights of Peace Week, was
sponsored by the College Democrats, the College
Republicans, the Forum for Free Speech and the Peace
and Conflict Studies Dept. The panel's chief organizer,
Aaron Brecher 'lO, said that the panel was aimed at
addressing widespread misunderstanding of contemporary political systems in the Middle East.
According to Brecher, neither Americans nor
Swarthmore students fully grasp what is going on in the
region despite a preponderance of national media attention.

"Diplomacy is not sitting down to
have a cup of tea. Diplomay oftentimes has to hurt the other person,
the other nation."
Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.)
"We have an opportunity to study the early medieval
period in the religion and history departments with
classes on Islam, but the modern Middle East is an area
where the departments lack classes," Brecher said.
Sestak arrived late to the panel due to a Congressional
vote Monday morning. Drawing upon 3 years of service
under the Clinton administration as Director for Defense

Policy on the National Security Council, Sestak offered
an insider's perspective on the U.S. relationship with

Iran. He was critical of the Bush administration's confrontational approach, arguing that the government has
pushed Iran away from the negotiating table. Sestak said
he believes strongly that diplomacy with Iran is critical

NEWS

to resolving tensions that emerged over the country's
onetime pursuit of a nuclear program.
"Diplomacy is not sitting down to have a cup of tea,"
Sestak said, asserting that a successful negotiating strategy can be both respectful and aggressive. "Diplomacy
oftentimes has to hurt the other person, the other nation.
It hurts them through economic sanctions."
Other panelists offered different perspectives on the
U.S.'s relationship with Iran and the effects that the
upcoming elections in both Iran and the U.S. will have on
that relationship.
Dr. Ray Takeyh of the Brookings institution spoke
first, discussing the recent gains by the Middle Eastern
conservative movement and its affect on the internal
political and cultural aspects of Iran that are shaping its
stance toward the US. Using elections in Iran over the
past decade as a guide, he said that surprises are possible but not likely this time around.
"At this particular point it is safe to suggest that the
right wing has consolidated its power and it is a power
that it is unlikely to relinquish easily," Takeyh said.
He went on to discuss the implications of this conservative power in Iran's interactions with the U.S. as well
as whether or not he thought the current Iranian president would be reelected. "[The conservatives] do have a
cultural objection to normalization of relations with the
U.S. The U.S. is not just a strategic threat, not just an
imperial power, but also a cultural challenge. The level
of normalization and intimacy that can take place
between the two countries therefore can erode the pillars
of the Islamic republic."
Dr. Philip Gordon of the Brookings Institution also
spoke, focusing on the ways in which other nations have
approached Iran and concentrating on the contrasting
views of U.S. policy makers and those of the European
Union. He specifically talked about the role of economic
relations and the differences in successes between the US
and the European Union.
These views have converged in the last few years, he
said, before noting that the presidential candidates were
likely to approach problems very differently with Iran if
elected President.

Students attending the panel appreciated the nuanced
views expressed by the panelists, but some had hoped
there had been an opportunity to expand on the different
approaches of the candidates. "It would have been nice to

hear what they thought about the difference between
Obama and Clinton's policies were,"- Student Council
President Peter Gardner 'OB said. "They kind of lumped the

Foreign Relations discuss the contours of modern

democrats together and then compared them to McCain."
On the whole, responses to the panel were very positive. "I thought it was fantastic," Gardner said. "The panel
was well balanced, especially between the elected official
and the policy wonks."
Attendees were also impressed with the candor of the
panelists. "It didn't feel like they weren't saying things
because they were not politically correct," Brandon
Karlow 'OB said.
As an organizer, Brecher was also impressed by the
level and quality of participation by students attending the
lecture.
"I thought that the questions asked by students were
especially sharp," Brecher said. "When panelists speak at
college campuses, they may not always expect the student
body to be as informed as they are here."
Although Brecher experienced some initial funding
issues, the President's Office stepped in to support the
event financially. The only thing Brecher wregretted was
the brevity of this event. "My one regret was that we didn't have more time," Brecher said. "I would have loved to
have continued, to have had more questions and
answers."

BRIEF

Gordon and Takeyh speak on the topic of Iran-U.S. reconciliation, distinguish between political and public Iran
Phoenix reporter Hannah Purkey sat
down for an exclusive interview with Dr.
Philip
H. Gordon of the Brookings
Institute prior to the Iran Panel. Gordon's
policy specialty is in analyzing U.S. strategies for tackling issues ofterrorism as they
relate to interactions between European
and Middle Eastern states. In addition,
Gordon is former director for European
Affairs at the National Security Council
and has recently written "Winning the

Hannah Purkey: If the U.S. were to
find common interests to come together with Iran on, what would those be?
Philip Gordon: The first thing to say
is it depends on what you mean by Iran,
because you have the Iranian leadership
and the Iranian people. With the Iranian
people we may share a lot of interests, like
stability in the region, a stable peaceful
Iraq next door, a stable and peaceful
Afghanistan next door and a prosperous
Iran with which we could trade. In all
those ways, American interests and
Iranian interests are very similar. The
Iranian government has its own particular interests, which include denying the
U.S. influence in the region. That gives

THE PHOENIX

them an interest in maintaining some
instability in Iraq and Afghanistan. In
that sense, the U.S. and Iran interests are
in conflict, or at least the government
interests are in conflict
HP: The American government has
been anti-Iran for such a long time,
have we pushed Iran away?
PG: There is a mutual pushing away
process. For almost 30 years now, both
sides have mutually reinforced the gap
between the two countries and we just
haven't been able to get over that. The
hostage crises and U.S. interventions in
Iran going back to 1951 and then after the
revolution in 1979 has lead to a lot of
Iranian, resentment that makes it hard for
them to reconcile. And the U.S. is rarely
willing to reconcile because Americans
remember hostage taking, Iranian support for Hezbollah and Iranian nuclear
programs. Each time one side has made
some efforts to bridge the gap there are
always those on the other side who render
that impossible.
HP: Is there any hope that we will
bridge that gap?
PG: We are not there yet, but I think
that in another generation maybe. The
next generation of leaders which really
won't have any recollection at all of these

difficult and trying times might have a
better chance of doing that. That's why
among younger people today there is less
of a gap. Even when you see Barack
Obama running for president, he doesn't
have the same historical memory of Iran
that John McCain would have, because he
just wasn't a leader during the most difficult times. So we are definitely not there
yet. Maybe in the next generation it will

That same day, The Phoenix also spoke
with Dr. Ray Takeyh of the Council on
Foreign Relations. According to the
Council's web site, Takeyh's expertise lies in
Iran and in Persian Gulf& U.S. foreign policy. Takeyh is also a contributing editorfor
National Interest" and is in the process of
publishing his book "The Guardians of the
Revolution: Iran and the World,"
Hannah Furkey: A new public opinion poll came out that says that two
out of three Iranians think that the
U.S. and Iran will be able to come
together on common ground. Do you
think that's an accurate depiction of
Iranian public opinion?
Ray Takeyh: That conforms with
other public opinion surveys that have

April 10, 2008

taken place, so I would say that's accurate.

HP: If there is a growing support for
some sort of reconciliation, why hasn't
it happened?
RT: It has to do with the fact that within the leadership of the country, there are
a lot of objections and concerns about the
United States, objections about, strange
enough, about cultural subversion. There
is this idea that the Islamic republic is
this pristine order and that American culture can contaminate it and so forth. So
within the leadership there is a strong
aversion to that sort of interaction
between the two societies.
HP: Do you think that this will keep
them apart indefinitely?
RT: I don'tknow about indefinitely, but
in the short term those political decisions
are going to obstruct the social pressures.
HP: What will have to happen to
change the situation?
RT: It has to be some sort of political
agreement between the two countries;
that's how you trigger a better relationship. At this point they are fairly far
apart on a lot of these things, so in
absence of some sort of diplomatic break
through, I don't see that normalization
taking place.

Engineers Sam Garcia and Travis Rothbloom work on Swarthmore's entry to the annual American Society of Civil Engineers Steel Bridge Competition, held at Lafayette College.

Engineers compete in steel bridge competition
BY ANNA ZALAKOSTAS

azalakol@swarthmore.edu

Entering Swarthmore in the Steel
Bridge Competition, an annual competition amongst college engineering students
to build the best bridge, for the first time, a
team often Swarthmore students including

David Bober 'O9, Travis Rothbloom 'lO,
Karina Navarro 'O9, Tom Kelleher 'O9,
Rachel Cohen 'lO, Kara Peterman 'O9,
Susan Willis 'O9 and Meghan Whalen 'lO
that was led by Chris Caruso 'OB and Sam
Garcia 'OB placed fourth among nine
schools at the American Society of Civil
Engineers conference at Lafayette College

last weekend.

Though Swarthmore students have
attended the ASCE Conference in the past,
it was not until this year that Caruso and
Garcia took the initiative to enter
Swarthmore in the Steel Bridge
Competition, one of the two competitions
held at the weekend event. According to
Caruso, the decision to compete was a combination of interest sparked by seeing the
bridges other schools had built at last
year's regional conference, the awareness

of the necessity to complete a senior thesis
(Caruso and Garcia designed the bridge for
their final E9O project), and the desire to
increase Swarthmore's visibility at a conference that is for the most part dominated
by larger universities. "We wanted to get
Swarthmore, which is a small school compared to the other schools in the competition, more involved. We wanted to get this
competition to be a yearly thing for our
chapter. There has to be a groundbreaking
year where all the kinks get worked out, so
we thought what better than to use a huge
E9O project to get people out there excited,"
Caruso said.

Though Swarthmore finished in fourth
place, the team still came out strong. "For a
debut year, it was good," Caruso said.
"Especially considering there are pages
and pages of rules you have to follow. We
designed a good bridge. Because it was part
of our E9O project, our professor had additional expectations on top of what the competition requires, so our bridge had to satisfy both the competition's criteria and our
advisor's criteria.'*

The teams competing are judged on four
criteria: weight, aesthetic, stiffness and
efficiency. Every part of the bridge is given
a monetary value, and, ultimately, the challenge comes down to being able to build the
best bridge using the least amount of
money. "You don't just have to design a
good bridge, you have to design a good
bridge for the competition," Cohen added.
"You need to be able to put it together
quickly and easily. Because all our connections were bolted, it took a while to get the
bolts in, whereas the other teams who had
more experience had pieces that fit togeth-

"I really had a lot of fun," Cohen said.
"It's incredibly nerdy, but it's great. On the
first day when everyone is assembling
their bridges, you can walk around with
your teammates and examine all the different designs and try to analyze bridges and
why teams designed their bridges the way
they did or try to predict how it's going to
do in the competition. For folks like engi-

neers, that's a fiekd day."
After this year's positive experience at
the ASCE conference, Swarthmore is
planning on entering the Steel Bridge
Competition again next year. The students involved in building the bridge

expect that they can be even more com-

petitive next year and that they will be
able to put in an even better showing: "We
learned so much from doing this. We didn't really know what we were getting
into," Cohen said.
"If we had to build a competitive bridge
again, we'd do it differently," Caruso
added. "You need a bridge that's light, you
need to have a few pieces that go together
quickly, and you need a bridge that's stiff.

While we knew all of that before, what we

really learned is that you have to keep all
of these objectives simultaneously in mind

from

day

one."

er."

The bridge, designed by Caruso and
Garcia in January, was based offof the triangular arrangement of beams, called roof
trusts, found in sloped roof buildings like
ski lofts. According to the rules of the
competition, the actual building of the
bridge requires that only two people stand
in an area that represents the river, who
can't step beyond a certain point.
Similarly, those standing outside of the
river are unable to go past a certain point
into the river, so the speed of construction
largely depends on smooth cooperation
and the assistance of a supervisor, who
-

helps by shouting out instructions to
those involved in different parts of the
assembly process.

Kemp supports symbolic 10:1 matching of donations
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
Never has your money been worth more. Starting this
week, students can donatemoney to the new Fund the Future
10:1 Campaign, an initiative to raise money for the college's
loan-free program. Most notably, Giles Kemp '72 will match
the sum of students' personal donations tenfold. The campaign will last throughout this fiscal year, which ends June
30.
The idea for the initiative grew out of a board meeting in
December. "Kemp approached [Student Council President]
Peter Gardner with an idea he had about wanting to get students involved, by starting a matching grant fund," Student
Council Appointments Chair Nate Erskine 10 said. "I think
the idea is that what he wants and what Student Council
wants is for the whole entire community to get behind this,
regardless of whether they're on financial aid or not."
Student Council members will be tabling in Parrish
Wednesday and Thursday of this and next week. Students,
faculty, staff, parents and alumni will be able to slip cash or
a check into envelopes, seal them and write their name and
class year. The envelopes will be sent to the appropriate
office and account.
Kemp's offer to donate ten times students' contributions
is, as far as Vice President for Development and Alumni
Relations Stephen Bayer knows, unique to Swarthmore. "I
haven't heard of other 10:1 matches," he said. "I heard of 2:1,
3:1, we have a 5:1 anonymous match for the senior class gift
to the Annual Fuhd, but nothing like a 10:1
this is pretty
astounding."
According to Bayer, the college is using a three-tiered
fund raising plan. The first tier focuses on funding the loanfree financial aid plan. The second sets to address the increasing cost of financial aid, which for many outstrips increases

in income. The third tierdeals with financial aid for international students. "The goal eventually [is] going need-blind for
international students, although that probably won't happen
in the next couple of years," Bayer said. "Gil Kemp, being an
amazing, wonderfully philanthropic member of the board,
has chosen to challenge the students with a wonderful matching gift."

At the moment, there is no set target for the campaign.
While Kemp may have set a cap, he has not made it public.
"We're aiming to see how much we can get," Gardner said.
"Several thousand dollars from students would be ideal."
According to Director of Alumni Development Patricia A.
Laws, the Fund the Future campaign dates back to the Board
of Managers' decision to make Swarthmore financial aid

packages loan-free. The loan-free initiative, which the Board
of Managers announced Dec. 12,' 2007, demonstrates
Swarthmore's commitment to leveling the financial playing
field for students and their parents, according to Laws.
Student "Swarthmore" loans will be replaced by grants starting in the fall. According to the Swarthmore Web site, endowing the program requires an extra $4O million. The interest
earned from the $4O million would provide the $l7 million
annually necessary to fund the loan-free plan.
The Fund the Future campaign would contribute to the
above amount, although, according to Gardner, the campaign
is largely a symbolic gesture to show that students care about
the initiative, about financial aid and about accessibility and
diversity of all classes. "That's the spirit of philanthropy we
should be taking," he said.
Laws hopes the Fund the Future campaign will help motivate alumni, parents and friends of the college to also donate.
"Student Council has really shown exceptional leadership in
launching this campaign and student philanthropy will
inspire alumni to act, too," Laws said in an e-mail. The college currently has a goal of raising $2O million by June 30,
2010. So far, $4.5 million, or 22.5%, has been committed.
The college's annual Report of Gifts will publish names of
students who donate money, be it one cent or a hundred dollars. The college will respect those who request anonymity,
although Laws says this year's report may require extra
pages to fit all the students who donate to the campaign.
Swarthmore is currently transitioning between two
major capital campaigns. The last campaign, "The Meaning
of Swarthmore," ended in Dec. 2006 and raised $245 million,
exceeding its goal of $230 million. The current initiative,
Bayer said, "stems from the desire to raise a tremendous
amount of money for financial aid for the next couple of
years," while the college gears up for the next major capital
campaign.

Smokey the Bear (Paul Apollo) tells Jake Baskin (and all
of Parrish) that "only you can prevent college loans."

As with any small private institution, Swarthmore relies
on donations from community members to cover expenses
each year. "We're only spending about 4% of the endowment
every year," Bayer said. "It's not a checking account."
However, the college is by no means relying on student
contributions with this 10:1 campaign. Rather, Bayer highlighted the educational component of the campaign as an
opportunity for students to learn about philanthropy in general, and about how philanthropists can leverage their gifts
by encouraging other, people to donate.
"It's not about how much, it's just about engaging them
in philanthropy in general and recognizing the school is a
place that requires significant donations to run every year,"

said.
Student Council members will be promoting the Fund
the Future campaign over the next few weeks. Their first
event, a discussion by* Jim Bock, took place Tuesday

Derickson announces departure from the college to pursue Ph.D.
for the past three years, returning to her
alma mater after time in the Peace Corps
and working as a public housing intern.
Derickson's departure has been met
with disappointment and questions.
Many wonder why she needs a Ph.D.
when she has served as a competent housing director and, in the words of Cara
Arcuni 'O9, "has performed certain vital
'dean' functions" for the past thee years.
Dean of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal was the one to encourage
Derickson to seek education beyond her

bachelor's degree. "If you're going to
work in higher ed, you need at least a
master's degree," Westphal said.
Westphal went on to say that having
higher degrees gives you credibility
among faculty members. She said that,
although not required for a dean's work,
having a Ph.D. commands more respect
because "you go through the same academic process that [other faculty members] go through."

multiple intelligences, Westphal said that

THE PHOENIX

Derickson was blessed with tremendous
intra-personal intelligence, a skill that
made Derickson a natural as housing
coordinator. To illustrate her point,
Westphal shared an anecdote about
Derickson's time as an RA on a hall full of

seniors, where she encouraged everyone
to attend weekly study breaks.
However, Westphal also stressed
Derickson's background in academia and
called her a "smart cookie." Derickson
hopes her degree in sociology will allow
her to become a professor and possibly a
dean in the future.
Derickson hopes to stay in higher edu-

cation, whether or not she ends up at
Swarthmore again. She likes the fact that
working in higher education gives her a
chance to "get to know a wide variety of
students, faculty, and staff."
She cites her relationships with students and colleagues as what she most
enjoyed about her job.
As an RA and member of the housing
committee, Arcuni remembers Derickson
as an enormous resource to the college.
She said, "Liz brought friendliness, efficiency and understanding of students and
their issues to her job."
Westphal added that Derickson had an
uncanny knowledge of Swarthmore and
an unmatched ability to understand the
student body. She joked that "I would
make her a dean right now, except the outside world says you need a degree first."

announcement
Upon
Derickson's departure, many students
expressed concerns that her replacement
would not be able to fill Derickson's large
shoes.
Arcuni believes that housing will be
very different after Derickson leaves,
worrying that if a replacement is not
found, "it will be a little difficult for Myrt
to manage both her current dean duties
and housing, although her past experience with housing will make it much easier."
Westphal, however, is optimistic. After
only a few days, the opening for the new
Assistant Dean of Residential Life has
already had forty applicants. Her only
concern is timing because it is unclear
whether the new person will be able to
start in time for next fall.
Derickson said in an e-mail that she

April 10, 2008

hopes that her replacement will possess
the same "ability to work independently
and balance a variety of responsibilities,
attention to detail, sense of humor [and]
ability to work with many constituencies"
that she has displayed throughout her
time at Swarthmore.

"[Liz Derickson] brought

friendliness, efficiency
and understanding of
students and their issues
to her job."
Cara Arcuni 'O9
Housing Committee
Member

added that Derickson has

played an absolutely vital role in making
residential life at Swarthmore enjoyable.

She said that Derickson "deals with
issues that usually wouldn't rise either to
the level of.Myrt's involvement or the
involvement of individual psychological
counselors: how to write a roommate
agreement, how to deal with a troublesome roommate and a lot else."
Westphal admits that she is sorry to
see Derickson go, as she has acted as
Derickson's advisor, supervisor and mentor since her freshman year.
However, she said that, in order to fill
the job opening, "we will find someone
good."

The third annual Tri-Co Peace Week kicked off on
Friday, April 4, the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The day included several key events including a performance by a Rwandan
dance troupe, a screening of "The Laramie Project," and
a dedication of the Tri-Co's first peace pole. Two lectures accompanied these events, both highlighting the
importance of major leaders: Martin Luther King Jr.,
Gandhi, and the Kennedys.
The first lecture was held at Swarthmore and was
entitled "Dr. King and his Message 40 Years Later." Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l began the collection with
a moment of silence before reading passages from Dr.
King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail" and from a sermon delivered April 3, 1968.

"It will be interesting to see the
energy [of Peace Week] after
Brandon leaves."
Maurice Eldridge '6l
Vice president
Eldridge urged students to carry Tri-Co Peace Week
well into the future and to "continue the annual, perennial search for justice in this world."
Brandon Lee Wolff 'OB, the coordinator of Tri-Co
Peace Week spoke after Eldridge, highlighting several of
the weekend's events.
He especially stressed the Rwandan dance performance later that night, an event that had been extremely
popular in previous years.
Shilpa Boppana 'll followed Wolff and introduced the
speaker, Reverend Ralph Roy '5O. She emphasized his

ple have made in repudiating the racism of our parents'
generation.
An avid Obama fan, Roy addressed the race-driven
comments recently made by the Democratic hopeful's
religious advisor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, during the
question and answer session. He cited "white prejudice"
and "black anger" as the two biggest hurdles to overcome
to achieve racial unity, an achievement he is confident
that our society can make.
Later that evening, Harris Wofford gave a talk entitled "Gandhi, King and the Kennedys
Now!" and led a
subsequent discussion at Haverford College.
Wofford is possibly most famous for the time he
served as a United States Senator for Pennsylvania from
1991 to 1995. He was also the former president of Bryn
Mawr College.
However, it was his career as a civil rights lawyer, his
experiences as unofficial advisor to Martin Luther King
Jr., and his position as special assistant to President
Kennedy on civil rights that he drew on for his talk.
Wofford began with a discussion on Gandhi and his
role in the anti-violence movements of the last decade.
He characterized Gandhi's teachings as the "crux of our
non-violent protests and demonstrations."
He went on to describe his friendship with Dr. King.

Both Wofford and Roy remember King as an intellectual
man, devoted to his cause, but also devoted to laughter.
Wofford poignantly remembered the conversations he
and Dr. King had shortly before King's assassination
about the future of race relations.
Finally, Wofford recalled his time serving in the
Kennedy administration and the relationship he cultivated with both Robert and John F. Kennedy. He called

such as Columbine. It originated as a two-day event for
the 3,000 students of Council Rock North High School in
Newtown, Pa.
By 2003, the event had expanded into a week-long celebration that encompassed the entire Council Rock

School district.

Peace Week has now expanded to all of Bucks County
and carries the tagline "Preventing Violence in our
Schools and Communities."
Once at Swarthmore, Wolff worked to charter his antiviolence group "Save 'R Us" and organize Peace Week.
He said he was drawn to Swarthmore's "willingness to
start new organizations."
The first Peace Week, which took place in 2005, held
events exclusively at Swarthmore. By 2006, there were
events at Bryn Mawr and Haverford. Although Wolff
was excited to include the other Tri-Co schools, he
noticed very few students attending events at other
schools.
Peace Week 2007 saw the addition of several "Blue
Busses," planned around transporting students to events
of interest at each of the three schools. This year's major
addition is the dedication of peace poles at both
Swarthmore and Haverford.
These nine-foot structures bear the phrase "May
Peace Prevail on Earth" in languages with history of conflict.
Wolff is especially excited about the prospect of leaving the peace poles as "something permanent for the
schools that could be visited forty or fifty years later."
One of the most important planning issues was the
issue of timing.
Interestingly, Tri-Co Peace Week is always held the
first week of April in order to encompass the anniversary of Dr. King's assassination on April 4th and the
anniversary of Rwandan genocide on April 6th. Eldridge
hopes that these dates of international importance
reflect the broad-base of issues addressed during this
week. He said, "It's not only about our immediate
locale."

Eldridge hopes that the tradition will continue well
after Wolffleaves and is optimistic that Wolff responsibly
delegated tasks. "It will be interesting to see the energy
after Brandon leaves," he said.
However, Eldridge believes that the event reflects
important issues that aren't "something you want to con-

fine to a week" and hopes the dialogue will continue well
beyond the week.
Tri-Co Peace Week still has several events left this
week, most notably the State Radio Concert, a benefit
concert for Philadelphia organization "Mothers in
Charge" occurring Thursday at Swarthmore.
Also, Swarthmore's Peace Pole dedication is happening Friday at 5:30 PM and will be preceded by a Peace
Walk from Parrish to the site of the new Peace Pole.
Finally, Peace Week concludes this Saturday night at
Paces, with a sixties-themed Peace Party.

the Kennedys "harbingers of change" and emphasized
their devotion to racial justice.
During the discussion that followed the talk, Wofford
expounded on his work as a Civil Rights Lawyer during
a time of political and racial upheaval.
Like Roy, Wofford supports Senator Obama in his bid
for the Democratic nomination.
He had the opportunity to introduce Obama before

his famous "A More Perfect Union" speech in
Philadelphia, an honor that Wofford called "tremendous."
Both speakers ended their respective events to standing ovations, boding well for this year's Peace Week.
Eldridge found Reverend Roy "enthralling." He said

that he "was quite taken with him, impressed by his
memory and his humility."
Eldridge believes that events such as this are signs of
Peace Week's continued improvement and its potential
as a long-lived Tri-Co tradition. He said that "in the
beginning, it was Brandon," referring to Wolff, Tri-Co's
principle coordinator.
Peace Week actually began when Wolff was still in
high school and entered the "Peace Talks, Violence
Walks" contest in hopes of preventing violence in schools

Yesterday, former Democratic Alaska Senator and current presidential candidate Mike Gravel drew a large crowd
of Swarthmore students, community members and Strath
Haven high school students at an event sponsored by the
College Democrats. Gravel shared his views on defense
spending, America's taxation and education systems, and

as they were before. My ideology hasn't changed one iota.
EC: If you had to pick one issue that this country is
facing today as the most pressing, what would it be?
MG: It would be the issue of governance. We need to
empower the people. The answer is the empowerment of
the people. That's the issue. These others are policy
issues, ending the war, stopping the military industrial
complex, American imperialism, education, taxation.
Those are all policy issues.
But fundamentally, you can't solve any of those issues
until you empower the American people to become lawmakers. I have unreserved faith in the people. I really do.
I just trust them.

EC: Where did the idea of law-making as a form of
empowerment come from?
MG: It actually comes from the sense of civilization
that was handed to us by Solan in 595. Now, we had laws
before that
but Solan lifted the concept of law beyond
...

those frictions.
EC: How would you respond to the freedom of the
Internet and the censorship of media in reference to
your campaign?
MG: I just respond to the freedom of the Internet. It's
the only thing that has sustained me in this campaign. It
was done by young people who understand the Internet
and who have just stepped forward. I have not paid for
any of this. It has been all volunteers. They take my candidacy and they just go do things with it. It's really a miracle.
With respect to the mainstream media, I have no control over them. I have a book coming out, called, King
Makers. It attacks the media. It shows how the media was
the echo-chamber of the White House in bringing about
the war in Iraq. I really pay them back their due. And how
many of them really did bad things to them. And that's all
outlined in the book. It should be out in 6 or 8 weeks It's
probably not very good politically to do that. You don't get
in to a contest with someone who buys ink by the barrel.
But I don't care. I'm just not afraid. I'll just fight and fight
and fight.
EC: What are your hopes for the next four years?
MG: I hope that I can become President and then use
that to persuade Americans to empower themselves*
That's the accomplishment I will have. I'll do a lot of other
things as president. But nothing compared to my empowering you as a lawmaker. I'll be long gone. There's the
cliche, I give a fish I feed you for a day. Give you a fishing
pool, I feed you for your life. I give you a law, I take care
of you right now with one problem. I give you the power
to govern yourself for your life and future generations.

E-mail survey first step in collaborative IT overhaul
■■■■

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MARA REVKIN

mrevkinl@swarthmore.edu

ITS has released preliminary results from a survey that
was recently distributed to evaluate the use of e-mail and
associated tools on campus. The E-mail, Calendaring and
Collaboration Tools Project was initiated by ITS lastfall in an
effort to update and synchronize the diverse array of programs and platforms utilized by the Swarthmore community.
The short survey, distributed to students, faculty and
staff, asked respondents to indicate their level of satisfaction
with different programs and web services and the frequency
with which they use the following tools: Eudora,
Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft
Entourage, Swatmail, Gmail and Mobile devices.
Respondents were also asked to indicate how highly they
value functions such as calendaring, scheduling, sending or
publishing large files, collaboratively editing documents and
maintaining e-mail mailing lists.
Associate Chief Information Technology Officer Eric
Behrens, who is supervising the project, said that the
response rate for the survey is approaching 30 percent. At the
time of publication, over 550 people had responded to the survey, which was emailed to 1,920 faculty, staff and students on
March 26.
Data gleaned from the survey results will eventually help
ITS identify prospective webmail and calendaring programs
that would be a good match for the college's needs. Behrens
emphasized that ITS is nowhere near ready to produce a recommendationbased on the findings thus far. "We're going to
get to the point next semester where we're ready to talk about
specific products, but that's not really a concern in the first

phase of this project," he said.
Behrens said that ITS wants to spend sufficient time evaluating the community's needs and preferences, in order to
identify the program or package of programs that best meets
these criteria. "Right now, we want to make sure that we get
the requirements down and figure out what we need the software to accomplish, before we get hunkered down in to the
details of what the software will cost and how we will introduce it," he said.
The college currently relies on a standard Postfix e-mail
server with SquirrelMail for webmail. SwatMail lacks much
of the functionality that is built into full-featured mail
clients, and the survey results reveal that many users prefer
to reroute their e-mail through alternate programs. "Gmail is
the de facto standard e-mail tool for students," Behrens said.

Results of this survey evaluating the use of e-mail and related tools were provided by Associate Chief Information
Technology Officer Erich Behrens. The response rate for the survey was roughly 30 percent, with over 550
respondents from a pool of 1,920 faculty, staff and students. E-mail clients included in the "other" category include
Microsoft Outlook, Entourage and mobile devices.
One of the challenges illustrated by the survey data is the

reliance of many faculty (36 percent) and most staff (67 percent) on-Eudora as their primary tool for accessing e-mail,
despite the fact that this program is becoming obsolete.
"Eudora is a defunct product," Behrens said. "It's not being
developed anymore and it hasn't been for awhile. We really
need to move people off there," Behrens said, acknowledging
that transferring users is a multidimensional endeavor. By
the end of the month, ITS plans to recommend new mail
client softwarethat will replace Eudora for faculty and staff.
"Migration forward isn't just about teaching people to click a
few buttons on a new piece of software. It's about making
sure that everything moves forward from one environment
to another," he said.
E-mail tools have special significance for professors,
many of whom view e-mail 'as an extension of their memory," Behrens said. "It's a database of their work history, a
record of theirpast collaborations and research projects, and
they use it as a searchable database for their work life."
In the current phase ofthe project, ITS will prioritize "the
short-term need to move faculty and staff out of Eudora into
other software," Behrens said. Beginning next fall, the project will enter its second phase, in which ITS will explore the
possibility of introducing alternative programs in the areas
of webmail, calendaring and document sharing. "We will be
working collaboratively with the community to evaluate and
select long-term solutions, but that process
will probably wait until everyone returns in

Although many campus users are most
concerned about the e-mail aspect of the project, ITS is also looking at ways to enhance the
accessibility and convenience of calendaring
tools to all campus users. Most administrative

is "still figuring out some of the functions of the Google
Calendar, which allows you to share parts of your schedule
publicly or keep certain events private." Meeden said that
the implementation of a public, campus-wide calendaring
system could help users coordinate their busy schedules to
identify a mutually convenient meeting time. "As a person
who has to organize a lot of meetings, it would be nice to be
able to see several calendars at once and find out instantly

whether a particular time would be doable for the group,"
Meeden said, adding that such a system would only be functional if the campus community as a whole agreed to partici-

pate.
"It would only really work if you had everyone on board.
Faculty, like Swarthmore students, are very individualistic,
and convincing everyone to use a common organizational
strategy could be a tough sell," Meeden said.
A synchronized calendaring system, if made available to
students, staffand faculty, could enable users to perform multiple tasks through a single platform. Individuals could use
the system to keep track of their personal daily schedules.
Individuals belonging to groups could instantly view the

availability of other members and make scheduling decisions based on that knowledge. "A calendaring system would
enable the user to track collective events as well as individual events and know whether your individual calendar is
compatible with the group calendar," Behrens said.

Behrens said that many respondents to the survey prioritized the ability to share and send large files over calendaring tools. "Faculty, staff and students were all in agreement
that the ability to exchange and edit large files is very important," Behrens said. Based on the community's clear preference for efficient document sharing tools, ITS has decided to
raise the megabyte allowance for uploaded files and is exploring new and creative file sharing strategies.
Behrens said that one of the most significant findings to
emerge from the survey data is the diversity of user preferences on campus. "We can't characterize our population as
using one set of tools," he said. "What we're seeing out there
is an incredibly diverse environment."
Behrens emphasized that any new program or system will
have to address the many needs and preferences of campus
users. "There's no such thing as a once size fits all solution.
We need a flexible solution that will accommodate these different tool sets."
ITS will hold two open meetings next week to collect feedback from the community and take questions. Students, faculty and staff are invited to attend a lunchtime session at 12

White Women Confronting Racism open up discussion
about women's issues and feminism and

BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu

Recently, White Women Confronting
Racism (WWCR), a group of self-identified

white women who work towards raising
awareness about concepts such as white
privilege and racism, wrote an op-ed to
The Phoenix introducing their group's
objectives to the campus community.
WWCR, which was formed last semester- by Claire Galpern 'lO and Sarah Apt
'lO, is a group that holds weekly discussions during which they talk about
racism, white privilege, and other relevant topics in a constructive and collaborative manner some group members have
found to have been missing in previous
discussions on racism they have attended.
According to Galpern, discussions she
has attended on the topic of racism at the
college were usually disappointing since
white student participants would sometimes direct the discussion towards selfaffirming issues, such as white guilt, perhaps due to a lack of reflection on how
racism affects those under its assailment.

"We were having a lot of conversations
about how when there would be conversations about racism at Swat, in classes or
events, that white people were part of,
because white students mostly hadn't
been thinking about racism and their
white privilege, it often turns into everyone having to teach the white students,
with white students co-opting the discussion to make it all about our own identity

process," she said.
Topics of discussion for the group
range from what role the media may play
in one's conception of white people and
racism to addressing issues of racism

within their own families and groups of
friends.
"We had one [discussion topic] about

racism in our families' histories and
about
how you can start conversations
with your white family members or
friends about racism and white privilege,"
Galpern said.
"We have a couple people in the group
with little sisters and so [we worked on]
how to talk to them," Erika Slaymaker 10,
a WWCR member, said.
Although the group's discussion meetings are only open to those who self-identify as white women, the group originally
started off as an open group last semester
and had ongoing discussions as to
whether the group should remain closed
or open.
According to Slaymaker, there were a
few self-identified people of color that had
attended last semester's open meetings,
but there was a mutual recognition that
the group's purpose was to discuss how
white people can be better allies to people
of color, and that such discussion in a
white-dominated setting may cause others
who don't self-identify as white women to
feel uncomfortable.
...

"[These are] conversations about
racism we've internalized and how to deal
with that. It was not a comfortable space
for them
It just seemed really unfair to
have the meetings be open and then not
have it be a safe space," she said.
Additionally, reasons for why the
group has become a white women's group,
as opposed to a group for all white people,
has included group members' wishes to
discuss topics such as white feminism

think specifically

how white women's feminism [has] been
shaped by racism in a lot of ways and how
to challenge that.
"There's lot of things we could address
about white women's racism that we felt
we could really delve into if it was a
women's group," she said.
Currently, the group hopes to expand
its outreach by holding several events. In
the past, it held a movie screening of the
movie "Mirrors of Privilege: Making
Whiteness Visible" and a fireside chat
with Peace and Conflict Studies
Professor George Lakey.
At the fireside chat event, Lakey
spoke from his own experiences as an
ally to people of color, both fromhis personal experience coming from an inter-

foundation about how to start challenging
racism, or keep challenging racism,"
Galpern said. "There's been a lot of interest in the group, so hopefully this will be
a way to dig deeper into the questions
they've been grappling with..."
WWCR's weekly discussions are held
on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. in Kohlberg 328.
They also hold weekly planning meetings,
during which they prepare weekly discussion topics and discuss any potential

events the group may want to hold. Selfidentified white women who are interested in the group should contact cgalperl or

"We're trying to do this work of challenging our own racism, but it is really
important to us to be as transparent as
possible and to get feedback and concerns
from people on campus. We had an open
forum about a month ago to talk about the
group, and we're hoping to keep doing
that," Galpern said.

the steps of trying to understand his
story," Slaymaker said. "He's really

on their own experiences."
One story that Lakey talked about is
to be included in an upcoming book of
story,
his.
The
"A Reluctant
Awareness", speaks about Lakey's experience as a participant in a Worldwork
human relations workshop in Mumbai,
India in 1998.
During a leadership initiative component of the workshop, Lakey had
made a comment that advocated Satish,
a member of his small group, as a potential leader, during which he said "I
wanted to give a vote of confidence in
Satish. We're in his country, after all,
and he's such a bright and articulate
young man. I wanted him to lead."
It was only after receiving several
comments from other workshop participants that Lakey became aware of how
his comment could have been interpreted and reflected on India's colonized
history during which white colonialists
would arrive to the country and have
the power to delegate who of the natives
would act as leaders.
"I spent the rest of the night confronting this layer of racism within me,
venting my sadness and despair that
I've been conditioned so deeply, and
praying for the strength to learn to be a
better ally," Lakey says in the book.
Lakey also spoke about the position
of authority that one has in giving critique to another individual and the
implications of such an exchange if the
person in the position of authority is a
white person.
"George Lakey was talking about

event, said.
The group is now working on recruiting students to participate in a Whites

The training will be held next Saturday.

BY JOAN KIM

jkim3@swarthmore.edu

How could sex, drugs, booze, jazz
and a crew of vaudeville characters not
create
a wild party in 1920s
Manhattan? Michael John LaChiusa's

musical, "The Wild Party" incorporates all of these elements into one
crazy night while simultaneously
addressing issues not usually portrayed on the musical stage, such as
race and sexuality. It's hard to imagine
another musical more appropriate for

Swarthmore campus, and co-directors
Jackie Vitale 'O9 and Dan Perelstein 'O9
along with producer Laura Wolk 'O9
and choreographer Carmella Ollero 'O9
are bringing the "Party" to the stage

when the mysterious character Black
catches Queenie's eye. Other characters include incestuous brothers, a
character that is "ambisextrous" and a
prize-fighter and a dancer both past
their glory days.
Perelstein and Vitale had
expressed interest in running a
main-stage production and "Wild

choice for both them and the

Perelstein and Vitale have worked
so well together in the past that they

Their connection goes beyond working

about
theater,"

Perelstein said.
"The Wild Party" is unlike many
other musicals. The music has its roots
in jazz that reflects that era extraordinarily well in all its sauciness and lazy

swing.
According to Vitale, the content
that the characters deal with consists
of very serious issues that are sometimes uncomfortable to see on the
musical stage. "I think a lot of people
will come and think," Vitale said.
Many of the situations on stage are
more common on the theater stage
than the musical stage. Bringing in
topics of cultural and societal importance makes this particular musical
need to be taken seriously. "It demands
to be respected like a piece of theater,"
Perelstein said.
Although there will be scenes that
will be difficult to watch, and the show
is not for the faint-hearted, the codirectors state that they have toned
down the show in relation to how the
show is written in the script and was

produced on Broadway.
"Even if they don't love musical theater, we encourage people to come see
it," Vitale said.
The talented cast and crew are likely to leave the audience speechless this
weekend not only because of the risque
nature of the show, but because of their
sheer talent both on stage and behind
the scenes.
"The Wild Party" will be shown on

Exploding with the exuberance of adrenalized 'OBthe catcalls of the legendary Patricia Kelly 'OB,
the cheers of a core group of faithful Rhythm-NMotion fans and the expectant applause of the regular spectators, Saturday's Rhythm N Motion Spring
2008 Dance Concert was not to be missed. The concert was a chance for 15 graduating seniors to have
their last few moments in the spotlight, for an eager
audience to revel in the rhythms and dances of
African Diaspora and for the dance company to
incorporate into their performance students and
organizations whose work resonated with RnM's
mission of bringing to the forefront that which is

often overlooked.
As students crammed into even the most abandoned, seemingly nonfunctional corners of LPAC
and competitive shouts of call-and-return culminated in the customary verbal battle of the classes, the
pre-performance build up was just as spirited backstage as it was in the theater: "There's no feeling like
being in the wings seconds before the show and hearing class numbers, names and of course, Patricia
Kelly screaming
then the all too familiar tune of
Magalehna...Showtime!" RnM member Nicole
Nfonoyim 'OB said.
Showtime came and the sounds of the traditional
"Magalenha" beat on, male dancers cloaked in all

colorful, snuggly wrapped skirts whirled and ricocheted across the stage before the current members
of the R-N-M executive board came out to introduce

large-scale, energetic dance coordinated by John

"If I was going to jump off a roof, I would put on some
pants before I did," said Holly Black as she read from her
upcoming novel, "The White Cat," on Tuesday, April 8 in
the Scheuer Room. Black is a well-known fantasy author
who was on campus to decide and announce the winners of
the William Plumer Potter awards. In addition to reading
from her novel, Black also gave a short speech on the craft
of writing, and earlier in the day participated in a Question
and Answer session with interested students.
Holly Black is the author of "Tithe," "Valiant" and
"Ironside," three modern faerie tales for young adults. She
is perhaps most well-known for being the co-creator of the
popular series "The Spiderwick Chronicles," which has
recently been turned into a feature film.
Black, with red highlights giving her dark hair a personality of its own, stepped up to the mike with a wide
smile that invited the audience to share in the fun. She
began by reading part of the first chapter of her aforementioned newest work, which begins with a boy on a roof in
his boxers. After this intriguing beginning, we learn that
he has no notion as to how he ended up on the roof, only
that it seemed to involve a dream in which a cat literally bit
out his tongue and ran away with it.
"I didn'tknow how I had gotten up and that was a problem, because I was going to have to get down again, ideally
in a way that didn't involve dying," Black read, evoking
both the inherent humor and danger of the situation in a
way that left the audience anxious to hear the next chapter.
This novel, however, is far from finished and immediately
after completing the reading, Black informed the audience
of several aspects of it that she had already decided to
change.

"I didn't know how I had gotten up
and that was a problem, because I
was going to have to get down
again, ideally in a way that didn't
involve dying."
Excerpt from "The White Cat"
"How many of you are writers?" Black asked the audience. This began a series of questions about the frustrations and satisfaction that accompany writing to which
most of the audience responded to by raising their hands.
Black finished with the question, "How many of you, after
reading a paragraph aloud to a room full of people, want to
go and hide under a table?" and hands went up again, some
sheepishly, some proudly and most accompanied by smiles
ofrelief that other writers feel the same way.
After using these questions to establish a connection
with the audience, Black went on to give a short speech
about the purpose and value of writing. "The only audience
we will ever really know are ourselves," Black said, encouraging audience members to write works that they would
want to read and could find joy in reading. Black described
how the joy of reading is "the marrow of the bones in our
stories," something to hold onto even if all else fails.
Black concluded by announcing the winners of the contest. Lauren Rile Smith 'OB won first place, Sarah Peterson
'O9 won second place and Olatokunbo Adegboro 'O9 won
third place.

In contrast, the 45 minute Q&A session that occurred
earlier in the day was a much more informal event.
Attended by a small group, the informal format of this session allowed the discussion to flow from topic to topic, guided by questions but not constrained by the strict Q&A for-

mat.
Black began by discussing the development of her writing and how she began by writing poetry and then decided
to write fiction instead. She described her initial difficulties with plot, and how she had to "argue [her] whole way
through it."
In fact, Black has her own self-described "insane" plot
diagram that she uses for stories. It ties together the plot of
the story with what she calls the "personal plot." "The personal stuff actually creates more tension because you never
really believe the main character is going to die," Black
said. The intersection of the action of the play with the
development of the character action is what makes a story
so interesting for her, Black said.

On Tuesday, April 5, author Holly Black reads an excerpt of her latest unfinished novel, "The White Cat" to students in
the Scheuer Room. She later gave a short speech and announced the winners of the William Plumer Potter awards.
The fantastic has always been an integral part of this
author's life. "My mom absolutely believed in ghosts,"
Black said, adding "I have read fantasy my whole life."
Because the fantastic was such a large part of her childhood, she has never had the sense that fantasy is necessarily separate from reality. "[I remember that I] made some of
my Barbie dolls into vampires to protect myself against
other vampires," Black said with a laugh.
When writing her first novel, Black decided to try something contemporary because she thought it would be "simpler" than writing high fantasy. The contemporary setting
was "something I hadn't seen much of in fantasy" Black
explained. "Six years later, I realized it wasn't that simple,"
Black said with a laugh. The contemporary fantasy that
came out of this six-year process was "Tithe," a book well
worth the wait.

"How many of you, after reading a
paragraph aloud to a room full of
people, Want to go hide under a

table?"
Holly Black
Author
Though Black writes young adult novels, the issues she
addresses are far from childish. She uses the fantasy setting to explore elements of her characters. She examines
the psychological impacts of being a changeling, of growing
up believing yourself to be human and then learning that
you come from another world. She delves into the concept
of addiction through a tantalizing magical drug. All her
characters are strongly rooted in reality, and the fantasy
setting helps them come alive in her stories.
To college students who might be interested in getting
their works published, Black had some advice to give.
"Find a book that you like that's been written in the last
five years and look at the acknowledgements page. If the
author has thanked their agent, then you can query them.
If they didn't thank their agent, then you don't want to
work with them anyways." Before you query an agent,
however, Black cautioned that you "need a book that you're
really happy with."
When asked about the most surprising thing she had
learned about writing, Black replied "I didn't think I could
ever write for a living." Black's success in capturing readers' imaginations with her dark, alluring, Victorian style
fantasy proves quite the contrary.

The Scent of Her Flowers
The following excerpt is taken from the
opening of "The Scent of Her Flowers," the
short story by Lauren Rile Smith 'OB that won
first place in the 2008 William Plumer Potter
fiction competition.
"At midnight I bike to the bakery, and I
work until seven, taking cigarette breaks to
watch the sunrise stripe the buildings

around us orange and purple. Crossing my
arms in the chilly morning air. Fog patterns
the bakery windows. Inside, the air smells
like flour and butter. The scent of baking
bread- clean and greasy at the same timeclings to my clothes and skin, even to the
chain I wear around my neck, long after I
shower.
The dough starts out sticky. I add handfuls of flour at a time, and it gains shape in
my hands. I pound the dough like clay
against the wooden butcher block until,
fleshy, it springs back under my fingers. The
sky grays out, gets brighter; sunrise comes
earlier every morning, now that it's spring. I
nurse my cup of free coffee, mostly milk.
Risen loaves exhale- paf- and deflate under
my fist. I stretch and pull them, get them
ready for their second rise, twining my fingers in the ropy, developed dough.
At twenty to 7:00, it's like a scene change.
The morning retail workers start to trickle
in the door as we lift the cooling loaves onto
the shelves besides the front counter. All of
the retail staff is white. None of us bakers
really talk to them. One girl, standing
behind the counter, arranges muffins on
their wire stand. Gives me a nod. Red hair in
long pigtails, delicate freckles. A tiny river
of silver hoops trickles down her ear. She's
young- I'd say high school, but it's
Wednesday morning. Maybe a dropout.
Maybe another dyke, making overtures. I
return a stiff smile."

of the riots on Oct. 23. I'm not entirely
sure what the specific context was the

days, I high-tailed it to Berlin.
Prior to that, everything I knew about
the city came from "Hedwig and the
Angry Inch" and Dan Savage's vague
allusions to the crazy things he did there

before the fall of the wall. For the record,
I was not disappointed! Berlin is such a
cool city that when 1950s Marlon Brando,
the Rat Pack and Ghengis Khan want to
hang out, Berlin has to check its schedule
and sometimes says no.

Going to riots became a
student hobby surpassing
going to the movies and
rivaling drinking beer.

...

The 23rd of October marked the 50th
year of the Budapest uprising against the
Soviets. For about ten days in 1956,
Budapest was a liberated city ... and then
the Soviets came in with tanks and got
things back under control. Nonetheless,

the imagery from that uprising has
retained its potency and was effective in
this instance in particular.
I hopped the metro to Deak Ferenc ter,
where crowds pulled down a massive
statue of Stalin back in the day. The government had set up a series of exhibits
commemorating the anniversary, including (but not limited to) a Soviet-era tank.
Apparently all you need to start a tank is
pressurized air, so somebody brought
along some hairspray and got it started
up. Crowds also pulled down the letters of
a giant sign (it might have said
Magyarorszag) and dragged them around
by hand and on motorbikes. Police were
containing the crowds with tear gas.
Later in the evening, some friends and
I joined a crowd farther down the road in

I had dinner one night in a place
called White Trash Fast Food. The story I

heard was that in its first life, it was a
Chinese restaurant and while the menu
has changed to something more along the
lines of burgers and beer, the decor has
not. The inside is cavernous and swimming with green, red and gold dragons
and artsy, Oriental curlicues. To spice it
up a little more, there is a fake portrait of
a bulldog with glowing red eyes, a fish
tank and a live swing band. The waiters
sport wifebeaters and mullets. The coup
de grace was one ofBerlin's vampire bars
next door, where some vampires were
having a smoke and waiting to get in.
Berlin also engendered in me a
healthy appreciation for the walking
tour. I used to snobbishly lump it in with
other tourist traps like the bus tour or
(even better) the duck bus tour (they give
you really loud noisemakers! That you
can quack at the natives! Where is the
problem with this setup?), but here I will
admit that I was mistaken. Especially in
a city like Berlin, where 30 million formative events of the twentieth century
unfolded, walking (especially with a
young, energetic tour guide who works
for fun) is hands down the way to go.

refreshingly underexposed treats that

story from the perspective of its deaf protagonist and takes
place on the streets of Philly and "Like a Shooting Star," a

gangster-infatuated "Breathless"-reminiscent 1967 Japanese
film. Unfortunately, the Swarthmore workload did its
darnedest to cause me to miss out on these films, but here

are a few more filmsthat I'm really hoping I can get a chance

"The Sun Also Rises" is a "Lynchian" film by Chinese filmmaker Jiang Wen.

Courtesy of torontolife.com

"Chop Shop" by Ramin Bahrani follows two orphans in

Queens.

Not to be mistaken with the Hemingway novel, "The Sim
Also Rises" is the third film by Chinese filmmaker Jiang
Wen. Both his previous two films unflinchingly tackled
moments in China's recent past from a novel and unsentimental perspective. His first largely autobiographical film,
"In the Heat of the Sim," looked at the Cultural Revolution

in Beijing through the eyes of bratty children of military
officers, living completely carefree, happy lives. His second
film "Devils on the Doorstep" is a black and white satire
that's anything but black and white. It's pretty much "Dr.
Strangelove" for the Sino-Japanese War, indicting both
Chinese and Japanese characters, and was tellingly banned
in China.
As an awesome comedic actor, whose performances I've
seen in both of these films, Jiang also knows how to make
his films dramatically entertaining, something that can't be
said for all Chinese auteurs, all too eager to follow the
solemn foreign art film paradigm. It makes me all the more

excited that "The Sim Also Rises" has been described as reminiscent of David Lynch, following four disjointed, discontinuous vignettes during the Cultural Revolution. So the
film's been criticized as hard to follow? All the better! I know
next to nothing about the plot, but the fact that Jiang Wen
himself and the goddess that is Joan Chen star in it is
enough of a recommendation for me. I'm prepared to say
that audiences didn't know what hit them when they chose
the somnambulant mess that was Ang Lee's "Lust, Caution"
over Jiang's film at last year's Venice Film Festival.
American cinema lost its New Wave aspirations sometime in the '7os, or arguably never had any with its lumbering studio system, but "Chop Shop" seems to make an
admirable bid for the existence of some semblanceofrealism
and class-awareness in a film set in the U.S. The director
Ramin Bahrani's first film was "Man Push Cart," which
looked at the Sisyphus-like stasis of a Pakistani immigrant

resigned to selling food from a cart in Manhattan. Here,
Bahrani tells the story of two orphaned siblings in the dilapidated milieu of Queens who are falling into lives of delinquency. Critics have cited Bahrani's documentary style as
an update of neorealist tradition. "Chop Shop" seems pretty
promising in today's world of liberal guilt pictures.
On the more experimental end of the festival is an animated film that is being featured prominently as a part of the
festival's homage to film noir. It's appropriately titled "Film
Noir" and by the looks of its trailer and its animation style,
it'll probably be a really hokey, underdeveloped story, but
definitely fun and interesting to watch. Creators D. Jud
Jones and Risto Topaloski render their film in traditional
flat animation style that's nonetheless clearly computer generated, admittedly making the film look like a computer
game or Flash animation. Still, the simplicity of the animation allows Jones and Topaloski to play up the dramatic
lighting and camera angles that define film noir. That it's
animated in the first place allows "Film Noir" to execute the
most lurid sex scenes and gun shootouts possible that no live
action film, not even blue-screen-happy "Sin City," could get
away with.

It's these kinds offilms that make me feel like the underthe-radar nature of the Philly Film Fest is a blessing in disguise.

"The Sun Also Rises" is showing on Friday 2:30 p.m. at
The Bridge: Cinema DeLux. "Chop Shop" is showing on
Friday 2:30 p.m. and Saturday 9:30 p.m. at Ritz Five. "Film
Noir" is showing on Saturday 10 p.m. at Ritz East and
Sunday 5 p.m. at The Bridge: Cinema DeLux. More information is at www.phillyfests.com.

Sophomore accepted into National Repertory Orchestra
BY ANAGHA KRISHNAN

akrishnl@swarthmore.edu

To say that Jenna McCreery 10 literally
has music in her blood would not be an exaggeration. The daughter of a violinist mother
and a cellist father, McCreery began practicing the cello at the age of five. If McCreery
chooses musicianship as a career, she will
be the 3rd generation professional on both
sides ofher family.
Despite this illustrious background, her
parents encouraged her to cultivate other
interests, which led to her enrollment at
Swarthmore. "They didn't want me to go to
a music conservatory. They wanted me to
have the full college experience so that I
could discover a love of music by myself,"
McCreery said.
McCreery describes her "Eureka!"
moment as one that occurred during high
school when she was performing at the
Brevard Music Center, under famed conductor Keith Lockhart. The orchestra was playing "Hinds of Rome" to a packed house when
McCreery recounts she felt a "moment of
ecstasy" as she played.
"I thought to myself, 'I don't get this level
of excitement out of anything ever. My
friends playing instruments around me feel
this, the conductor feels this and the people
listening to me are feeling it too.'" McCreery
said, "I began to cry, and just really loved
music in that moment."
However, McCreery admits that she had
not considered going professional until
recently. Her change of mind stems partly
from the encouragement of her instructor,
Umi Kendall and her recent admission into
the prestigious National Repertory
Orchestra.

THE PHOENIX

The NRO is a non-profit organization for
young orchestra students who show promise. Students at conservatories nationwide
look at NRO as a chance to obtain invaluable
orchestral training and exposure to the professional music world. NRO alumni currently perform in various orchestras throughout
the United States and worldwide. In
February, the organization held an audition
tour to select 89 participants altogether. Out
of these individuals, they were looking for
only 12 cellists.
McCreery realized that auditioning
would mean a serious commitment.
"Auditions are like the Olympics. You practice five months for a five minute piece and
you only have one shot at getting it,"
McCreery said.
McCreery began preparing orchestral
excerpts five to six months in advance and
practiced a minimum of 3 hours a day. When
the time came, she traveled to the
ManhattanSchool of Music in order to make
her 9 a.m. audition.
McCreery is not someone that becomes
nervous easily, but she admits that in that
moment, she was more nervous than she'd
ever been. Nevertheless, the audition went
smoothly. «Upon learning of her acceptance,
she was delighted and also humbled. Her
acceptance was even more remarkable
because she is an unusually young candidate. The program mostly accepts graduate
students and young professionals.
She describes her contract with the NRO,
which is based in Breckinridge, Colorado, as
"being a professional musician for the summer." The members will perform two "services" a day in the form of a concert or
rehearsal. The orchestra will hold two concerts a week, an incredibly rigorous stan•

As a fraternity, we are deeply concerned by the issues
brought up in last week's letters to The Phoenix. We
were proud to host part of the Genderfuck party, but
we're furious and ashamed about the violations of the
queer safe space, the basic groundwork without which
the queer friendly environment that the party engenders

becomes unachievable.

We do feel it prudent to mention a brief account of the

and Villanova students showed up at the party, acting
hostilely at our house and making inappropriate
advances at women, and that we removed them from the
house after we were approached about their actions.

This is not to say that the comments overheard at the
Genderfuck party were solely attributable to visiting
students regrettably, we're aware that they could've
come from Swarthmore students and DU brothers, and
we welcome any information that could clarify for us
who was responsible, so that we can act accordingly. In
retrospect, we should have acted more quickly and we
should have prepared more thoroughly.
We had made public the names of several brothers
designated to handle issues of sexual harassment for the
night of the Genderfuck party, but it was understandably difficult to patrol a house full of more than 300 people, and we should have put in place better mechanisms
to ensure the queer safe space was exactly what it was,
intended to be. Delta Upsilon holds the Sager symposium and the Genderfuck party both in high esteem,
hoping to co-host both in years to come, and we want to
continue doing our part to keep our house tolerant and

safe.

Again, we sincerely apologize and look forward to a

Let me

by saying that
we're going to be playing with all of the pieces; nothing is
going straight to the trash. As much as I have derided
large-scale farming and advocated organic and smallscale agriculture, I also need to provide a bit of perspective.

Certified organic farming makes up only 0.6 percent of
the acreage devoted to farming in North America today.
Even if many uncertified organic farms aren't being
counted, we're still talking about a very small slice of the
North American agricultural pie.
Small farms, defined as producing less than $lOO,OOO of
food per year, are a more sizeable minority and are
responsible for about 27 percent of the food grown in

America. But they face the same limitation as organic
farming; both tend to produce only fruits and vegetables.
Have fun trying to find a viable 10-acre soybean farm in
the middle of 1000 acre giants in lowa.
Small and organic farms can make a living when the
food they grow is considered high-value (read: market
prices are higher as a baseline compared to something
like soybean) and when the quality tends to matter. So
when it comes to staple crops, most of which are going
straight to animal feed anyway, the big farmers are just
going to be better than the small players at capturing the
market, even without the federal subsidies that cater

towards them.
While both organic and small-scale farming are seeing
significant growth, and that growth should be highly
encouraged, it isn't reasonable to assume that these methods can completely replace conventional agricultural
April 10, 2008

practices in the foreseeable future. That leaves the question of what to do with the large-scale, industrial agriculture that remains. "Large-scale" and "industrial," by the
way, are two separate adjectives. Industrial implies all
those nasty things I've been writing about: excessive use
of herbicides and pesticides, wasteful use of water, too
much fertilizer. Large-scale doesn't imply anything but
big.
As much as hard-liners turn up their nose at anything
that might dilute the purity of organic farming practices,
there is a lot of good to be had from merging organic and
industrial practices on large-scale farms. Incremental
changes on a big scale can have even greater impacts
than very large changes on a much smaller scale.
An organic sensibility and a holistic view of farming
can lead to a more conscientious and responsible application offertilizer and chemicals, reducing excess and thus
reducing environmental contamination. However, many
specific organic practices aren't feasible on a large scale,
mostly because organic and small-scale farming tends to
be much more labor-intensive than industrial agriculture.
Here is where GMOs come in. The goal is to decrease
overall energy use, land use, and contamination of surrounding ecosystems. GM crops do this, often quite effectively and quite safely. They are still a second-best option
because they are limited by the possible risks associated
with them, but they are a sizable step above the concrete
harms of current industrial agricultural practices.
Organic and local are clearly the best options. Some
would argue against them, because organic farming takes
up more land (which could otherwise be left as wilderness) to produce the same amount of food as an industrial farm. I would argue that that is more than offset by the
dramatic reduction in chemical and fertilizer use that
also accompanies organic farming. That reduction
decreases the amount of land affected downstream of production in comparison to industrial practices that contaminate neighboring ecosystems and watersheds. It also
translates into less land and resource use farther
upstream because less energy is used in making these
chemical inputs.
So still, small-scale and organic food is the way to go.
But when it comes to food, we need a three-pronged fork.
There need to be changes in scale when feasible, the adoption of organic practices as much as possible, and the use
of GM crops when applicable. While we have a clear best
option, it's not one that we can count on to eclipse the oth-

ers.

End Iran's
sanctions
Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran,

the tenor ofrelations between Washington and
Tehran has been tense, to say the least. In light
of efforts by the U.S. State Department, The
Economist and Amnesty International to censure the Iranian government for its litany of

human right abuses, coupled with the recent
revelation that Iran intends to open a new uranium enrichment plan within one year, such
strained relations are no surprise to international observers. With the second round of
Iranian parliamentary elections on April 25,
however, the time has come to acknowledge
that the present U.S. strategy of embargoes and
antagonism has failed. The ineffectiveness of
America's unilateral sanctions on Iran is well
documented and widely acknowledged, except
by members of the American government.
Following the passage of
Sanctions Act of 1996, which

the Iran-Libya
put an end to all
American economic engagement with Iran, the
European Union has come to fill the void left
behind by America, becoming Iran's primary
trading partner. The logic behind Iran's decision to negotiate with members of the E.U.

while simultaneously rejecting cooperation
with the United States is very clear: through

the imposition of harsh sanctions, the United
States has systematically alienated not only the
Iranian government, but also the Iranian people, of whom 93 percent expressed unfavorable
views of the current United States government,
according to one of the few available surveys of
public opinion in Iran, conducted last year by
WorldPublicOpinion.org in partnership with
Search for Common Ground.
The Iranian government's belligerence is
fundamentally rooted in its perceived insecurity within the international system. The
Iranian government is precariously wedged
between the hostile American-occupied Iraq
and the equally hostile Sunni Afghanistan,
with America engaging in a containment, strategy reminiscent of the Cold War-era in order to
alienate Iran from the rest of its Arab neighbors. With billions of dollars in American foreign aid spent on the cooptation of Iran's neighbors, it can't help but feel left out of the party.
Moreover, according to Dr. Ray Takeyh of the

Council of Foreign Affairs who spoke on the

Iran Panel Monday afternoon, the Iranian government fears "cultural subversion" by the
United States and economic encroachment by
its multinational corporations. And with consequences far more serious that the fallout
from a mere diplomatic snub, the Bush admin-

istration's irresponsible habit of villainizing
Iran has angered President Ahmadinejad into
pursuing nuclear weapons in a desperate
attempt to salvage his government's declining
credibility and influence in the international
system.

The solutions to the Iran problem are as
simple as they are difficult for American politicians to accept.
In the coming months,
America must disengage itself from Iran until
after its parliamentary elections. President
ATimadinejad's fundamentalist platform is
based on a strategy of convincing Iranian voters that America is the "great Satan," a claim
that is not difficult to substantiate when
restrictive American sanctions continue to
alienate the large, educated Iranian middle
class hungry for Western goods and culture.
With pre-election American interventionism
cited as one of the primary factors behind the
election of Hamas to the Palestinian government in 2006, it is apparent that this strategy
has failed in the past.
In the long term, America must reexamine its
policy of economic containment. With European

nations not only succeeding in bringing Iran to
the negotiating table but also profiting from
these ties, it is difficult to understand the
American reluctance to set aside decades of ineffective principles and perhaps bring about an
end to the present climate of nuclear uncertainty

pervading Iran's corner of the Middle East.

Students fall prey to relativism
BY AMANDA WINTERS
awinterl@swarthmore.edu

In my Op-Ed poem of last week, I suggested that academically acquired relativism led several students to decline to protest
the Women's Studies Department's sponsorship of Wendy
B

____

Shalit's lecture. As relative tendencies* could

politically paralyze those inclined to them, I
feel compelled to address these issues in prose.
"Relativism" is "the doctrine that knowledge,
truth and morality exist in relation to culture, society or historical context." This generally means that you can apply standards
to your own culture, society and historical period in time, but
not to others.
The relativist rationales presented consisted largely in the
idea that there was no standard by which we could judge Shalit's
work independent of our ideological disagreements with her. I
disagree, for the following reasons. By sponsoring her lecture,
the department claimed that the event was worthy of our attention insofar as it would spark productive dialogue among the
audience. The problem is that Shalit's lecture had little productive potential. In any productive dialogue, all participants must:
1) agree to a set of shared ground rules, and 2) act honestly and
in good faith according to those rules. As Shalit makes claims
that she presents as objectively verifiable, that is, grounded in
"research," she has already opted in to the ground rules of academic discourse. However, her work violates the rules of this

discourse.

My point is that we are fully justified in judging her work by
academic standards, and it's wrong for a department to give its

endorsement to any event, the only possible outcome of which
can be anger, frustration and discomfort. Though I did not attend
in part for this very reason, all accounts so far indicate that this
was indeed what happened. That's unfortunate, since* I know
people on all sides of the issue who really wanted to have "an
open and honest discussion of [modesty and] the campus hookup

letters

to

culture," as the event was advertised. Everyone would have been
better served if the sponsoring offices had taken more than a cursory look and perhaps suggested that the organizers bring someone representing this viewpoint whose case was more compelling. My fear is that the motive behind bringing her to campus wasn't really to have such a discussion, but to bring someone who would expound radical conservative dogma as objective
truth, thereby offending people and generating a controversy
from which the organizer(s) could claim victim status.
Regardless, students were not comfortable asking the department to apply any standards to Shalit's work, and I think overcaution stemming from a misunderstanding of postmodern theory is a big part of the reason why. If we are afraid to use the
skills we have acquired, because we fear either falling short of
Ultimate Truth or not being able to read meaning accurately
enough outside our own cultural semantics, then the entire
endeavor has been in vain. Ironically, people like Wendy Shalit
have no qualms about making claims to objective truth, even
completely unqualified claims not contingent on empirical evidence. If we don'tcritically evaluate these claims, then the media
and the publishing houses, who are not beholden to these standards and have little reason to uphold them, will determine their
legitimacy for us. Shalit has already had far more than her fair
share of air-time for precisely this reason.
Anyone not engaging in flagrant hate speech may speak at
Swarthmore. But we don't do anybody any favors by rolling out
the red carpet ofacademic endorsement before deciding critically whether or not it is merited. It diminishes the credibility of
the institution, gives the speaker unwarranted legitimacy, and is
unfair to busy students who expect speakers to come to the podium with credible evidence for them to evaluate. In the past
departments have been very trusting that students will bring

quality speakers and not demagogues thinly veiled in the pretension of "research." In this case trust has been abused, and I
strongly urge all departments to be more careful about granting
sponsorship in the future.

Animal experiments morally dubious
To the Editor
Thank you for your article on the failure of laboratories to
accurately report the amount of pain and distress suffered by
animals used in experiments ("Delay in annual animal
research report, still in compliance with AWA guidelines,"

April 3). It's a tragedy for the animals that this failure, awful
as it is, is just one of numerous violations of the federal
Animal Welfare Act (AWA) in laboratories across the coun-

try.
A scathing 2005 audit report published by the Office of the
Inspector General reports that laboratories view fines for
AWA violations as a "cost of conducting business," while
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (lACUCs)
oversight committees that are the animals' last line of
defense are failing to carry out their responsibilities. As a
result, sick animals go without veterinary care, animals used
in invasive surgeries do not receive sufficient pain relief, and
extremely sick animals are denied humane euthanasia. An
astounding 29 percent
nearly a third
of oversight committees are failing to ensure that experimenters have looked
for alternatives to painful procedures on animals, as they're
required to do.

Just as bad, lACUCs appear to be little more than rubberstamp committees, approving the cruelest and most meaningless studies. At Swarthmore, the lACUC has approved experiments in recent years in which hundreds of rats have been
electroshocked and then placed in tanks of water where they
must swim to stay alive. The point? To induce extreme stress.
Animals in laboratories endure lives of deprivation, isolation, stress, trauma and depression even before they are used
in any experiment. When billions of taxpayer dollars are tunneled into these experiments, the public has a right to expect
that animals will, at the very least, be given the minimal protections conveyed by the AWA. The failure of" lACUCs to
ensure that this modicum of humane treatment is applied
results in immense suffering for animals used in sometimes
painful, often distressful, and ultimately lethal experiments.

No phoenix at Commencement
To the Editor:
I would like to call attention to a small and likely overlooked paragraph from the article "Spirited mascot contest

ends with 'phoenix debut'" from last week's Phoenix. Toward
the end, the author remarks that the mascot "has already been
booked for
upcoming events including the Mr. Swarthmore
competition, Senior Week and Commencement." What?
Commencement?
When I double-checked this fact with Dominic Lowell, our
Senior Class President, he was surprised, to say the least. I am
of the firm belief that this is an unnecessary and unwelcome
advance. While Commencement is not stodgy or overly selfimportant, it is a solemn and respectful occasion that celebrates the senior class' academic achievements and ushers
them into the next phase of their lives. Part of what makes
Commencement special is the sense it gives of continuity with
past (and future) Swarthmore students: the location in the
amphitheater, rain or shine; Al Bloom's speech; the way in
which the diplomas are awarded Nowhere in that picture is
the Phoenix. While students several years from now may feel
very differently, from my point of view the Phoenix seems little better than a garish, last-minute imposition. Currently he
...

has about as many emotional connections to the Swarthmore
community as Ronald McDonald. While I understand that
every attempt will be made to eventually integrate the mascot
into the larger Swarthmore tradition, the six weeks we have
from now until graduation won't cut it.
Finally, I would like to reiterate that the mascot selection
process has been dubious from the first. Most of you might
remember when students were asked to contribute ideas for a
mascot
somehow however many dozen were submitted got
whittled down to four: a gorilla, a manticore (i.e. an inside
joke), a phoenix (i.e. our newspaper) and a fourth I can't bring
to mind at the moment. The mascot committee seems equally
opaque. Who, exactly, is on it? How did they get selected? The
only student I have ever heard mentioned in conjunction with
the entire mascot process hasbeen Kyle While 'OB. Finally, who
has power over what events the mascot does and does not
attend? In most instances I would concede that the mascot's
presence is relatively benign.
In the case of Commencement, however, I would like to
think that those attending the event would have some sort of
veto power.

and Root to build "detention centers" in the continental
United States.
The detention facilities are to be used in case of "an
emergency influx of immigrants into the U. 5.," or in the
event of general mass emergency. The detention centers
are projected to be similar the ones in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, which Halliburton and KBR also helped build.
These detention centers have not officially planned to, but
potentially could, house "enemy combatants."

Overthrowing repressive

What exactly are "enemy combatants?" Well, a bill
passed in October 2006 added convenient ambiguity to this
term. The bill was rammed through Congress with little to
no debate, hiding under the pretense of being "necessary
to ensure national security." The Military Commission
Act of 2006 empowers our president to declare illegal

aliens as well as U.S. citizens as "unlawful enemy combatants." So anyone who poses a treat to "national security"
is subject to imprisonment in our newly built internment
camps.
Even worse, the bill also strips enemy combatants of
their habeas corpus rights. Suppose the United States goes
to war with Iran? Any future dissidents who the federal
government feels are becoming too powerful can easily be

sented what could have been an eye-opening talk that
gave insight into what it is like for men and women living in the aftermath and re-creation of a sexual revolution. I share the opinion that she did not effectively represent what it means to be "sexually liberated" and how
the very essence of this proclaimed "liberation" at times
can prove equally as binding as sexual repression. I felt
that what could have been a philosophically rich and
thought-provoking presentation was unfortunately simplified to include extreme examples of unhappy women
partaking in the hook-up culture with low self-esteem.
However, the point of this letter is not to criticize the
lecturer, as many have already voiced their opinions.
Instead, I would like to examine what I found to be even

walked into the lecture there were murmurs of excitement and a heightened energy in the room. The atmosphere was largely antagonistic and it seemed that at
least half of the people attending were there to pick a
fight rather than listen respectfully to an alternative perspective. My surprise and frustration grew as I began to
hear groans, snickers, jeeringand several loud outbursts
throughout the lecturer's speech. It was not until a firstyear student finally stood up and asked the audience to
show some respect that the assaults were subdued.
I was shocked that we could behave in such a disrespectful and dehumanizing manner. Even if the lecturer
had made her point more effectively, I doubt that any
message would have been able to permeate the hostile
atmosphere we created for her in that room.
I am proud to be a student at Swarthmore, but I was
embarrassed by the behavior that I witnessed that night.
We are better than that. So, I urge my fellow students to
join me in embracing our Quaker roots by working to
create an atmosphere where ideas, even those we may
vehemently disagree with, can actually be debated and
explored in a respectful atmosphere that affirms the dignity of everyone in the room.

OP-ED

Swarthmore Literary Review. We the
founders are disappointed that the
Charter Committee has decided not to
charter our poetry venture, especially
given the benefits to the student community at Swarthmore.
Paul Apollo, chair of the Charter
Committee, is quoted in the article as
saying that the student publications
market is currently very saturated,
and that a magazine must contribute
something very new. The Swarthmore
Literary Review fills a niche that has
not already been filled on campus: it is
the first to solicit work from outside
the student body. By doing so, it fosters
an exchange between Swarthmore student writers and the greater writing
community, something that current
literary magazines such as Small Craft

Warnings and Ourstory do not accomplish. While we are an open poetry
magazine, we are committed to publishing Swarthmore student writers.
This is the cornerstone of our publica-

tion. We want to expose student poetry
to new audiences. But the importance
of the magazine goes far beyond this.
The greater issue at stake here is
whether publications at Swarthmore
will continue to only focus internally,
or will try to expand and connect with
the outside community. Rachel Aucott
'OB, an editor for Small Craft Warnings,
spoke in the article of how student submissions of poetry [to Smallcraft] have
been diminishing significantly in the

past four years, and that "the creative
writing community here is just not big
or vibrant enough to result in a competitive volume of submissions for all
the magazines on campus." The
Swarthmore Literary Review solves
this issue by publishing talented writers both from the campus and outside
it. It thus both solves the problem of
low submissions on campus, and creates an exchange of ideas between
Swarthmore student writers and the
outside world, furthering connections
between arts communities.
Funding issues are another reason
we believe that we should be chartered
and funded. In terms of budget, the
Phoenix reported that we were asking
for approximately $6OOO/annum; the
correct figure is $3500/annum. This fig-

ure was provided to the Charter
Committee at our initial meeting, and
would only fund campus copies of the
Review; the money would not be used

to provide copies to outside writers.
This is in stark contrast to the $12,000$24,000 that Pun/ctum and The Night
Cafe initially requested. We believe
that The Night Cafe and Punc/tum are
very worthy of being funded; the Night
Cafe is an innovative publication in
the style of the New Yorker, and
Pun/ctum provides a necessary outlet
for the talented photographers on campus. These publications should not,
however, exclude The Swarthmore
Literary Review from being funded.
By publishing student poetry for both

campus and outside readership, we,

too, benefit the student body and
deserve to be funded.

The idea ofSBC benefiting students
should not be just money going directly to the student body through traditional activities and clubs; it should
also fund ventures such as this which
benefit students directly, but make
connections with the outside community. As Walt Whitman once said, "To
have great poets, there must be great
audiences too." The Swarthmore
Literary Review seeks to create these

audiences. It is an endeavor that offers
enormous benefits to the Swarthmore
student community, by expanding its
reach and connecting it to the writing
and arts community at large. We hope
that the Charter Committee will reconsider its decision and allow funding for
The Swarthmore Literary Review.

to 6-4. These wins against
and McDaniel College were tough battles for
the Garnet, both games ending with only a
one-goal margin of victory.
On Wednesday, April 2, the Garnet men
traveled to Towson, Maryland to take on the
Goucher College Gophers. The Garnet men
have fought the Gophers before in many
close games, and this year's proved to be no

different.

The game was a battle through and
through, as Swarthmore fought to maintain
the lead despite Goucher's statistical advantage. The Gophers tallied 36 shots compared
to Swarthmore's 30, picked up more ground
balls and had four extra-man opportunities,

but the Garnet men shut them down on
every front anyway.
With about twelve minutes left in the
game, midfielder Dave DeSimone 'O9 converted off a pass from Ben Young 'O9, scoring
his fifth goal of the season and second goal
of the game (his first ever multi-goal game),
giving the Garnet a two goal lead, 6-4.
The Gophers answered quickly, however,
netting two of their own, tying the game and
sending it into overtime.
The first overtime passed, and neither
team was able to slip anything past the netminders. This is no surprise on
Swarthmore's end, as goalie Frank
Mazzucco 'OB made 14 saves during the game

was later named the Centennial
Conference Defensive Player of the Week.
His solid performance has been much appreand

•

ciated by his teammates and has greatly
contributed to the wins. "Frank has been a

brick wall between the pipes which gives
our team an incredible boost...Having a
solid goaltender in the net allows our team
to focus its attention on other areas of the
game," Kevin Friedenberg 'lO said.
The victory came with less than two minutes left in the second overtime, when

Young finished on a feed from Tyler
Bradshaw 'lO, bringing the score to 7-6, and
bringing home the third consecutive one
goal victory for the Garnet against Goucher.
"We've been in overtime games with
Goucher several times in the past few
years," said Young. "We all went into the
overtime really motivated and with a lot of
heart. That's what helped us to come out on

top."
Friedenberg agreed, saying, "What gave
us the edge against Goucher was simply our

heart."
Swarthmore took the momentum from

this win into their next game, traveling to
Westminster, Maryland, and coming out on
top yet again in another close fight against
the McDaniel College Green Terror. The
Garnet scored first, and held the Green
Terror scoreless throughout the entire first
half in the low scoring battle.
Bradshaw, who led the scoring for the
Garnet with two goals, tallied his first just
three minutes into the game off a pass from
Gavin Musynske 'lO. A defensive war ensued,
and neither team was able to score another
until midfielder Anthony Phalen 10 netted
one with 4:43 left in the second quarter to give
Swarthmore a 2-0 lead going into halftime.
The Green Terror finally got themselves
on the board about halfway into the third
quarter, but Swarthmore answered back, as
Young notched a goal off an assist from
Stelios Wilson 'O9. Before the third quarter
ended, McDaniel scored again, bringing the
score to 3-2 going into the fourth quarter.
Bradshaw scored his second goal with
6:23 remaining to give the Garnet a two goal
lead, but the Green Terror responded, bringing the margin to one goal again. The
Swarthmore defense held strong to seal the
victory, however, and the Garnet men came
home with their first conference win, defeating McDaniel 4-3.
Mazzucco had another amazing performance with 16 saves during the game while
Dan Sartori 'OB also had an impressive day
on defense, causing two turnovers and picking up three ground balls. Max Wilson 'lO
and Jesse Handler 'O9 each picked up three
ground balls of their own as well.
These two wins bring the Garnet to 1-4 in
conference play and 6-4 overall. They hope
to carry the momentum from these two victories into their game on Saturday, when
they travel to take on Hamilton College in a

nonconference game.

Get Down With
Your Bad Self
Hockey will always hold a soft spot in
my heart. Being raised

in the "Hub of
Hockey" and playing the sport for over a
decade has branded a special feeling for
the game that can't be removed from me.
No matter how many different sporting
distractions may arise, such as the predictable Final Four, the meaningless early
baseball season, or the molasses-like
Masters, I try to always find a way to keep
informed about the NHL playoffs. At this
point of the year there is no other sport
that can compete with the excitement of

hockey, not even jai alai.
I used to follow hockey pretty closely.
There was a time when I remembered all
sorts of NHL players: who was fast, who
could snipe, who couldn't play hockey for
his life but could bring the crowd to its
feet by being a goon. Then something terrible happened: the lockout. The lockout
was to hockey what a midterm is to
Micro, an ignominious end. A whole season was lost because people apparently
cared more about "Trick Shot Magic
Pool" than they did about hockey.
I have never really regained my footing in the kingdom of hockey knowledge
that I once had. All of a sudden it seemed
like every U.S. born player on the Bruins
roster that I was familiar with had
departed, and all that was left were kids
younger than I, making more money in
one game than I could make in an entire
year. Though the new rules certainly
changed the tempo of the game and I do
admit that I love watching shootouts, I
felt like a younger and handsomer Rip
Van Winkle.

It wasn't until I was shoveling snow
this winter that I realized that I still did
like hockey, and even though all my old
favorite players are mostly dispersed or

Adam Foote? Those guys are harder to
find than 70 percent of our student body
on a Saturday night. Even though all the
hubbub about March Madness has come
to a climax this week, I urge the gentle
sports fan not to forget about the fastest
sport on two legs. Hockey isn't hard to
love and Canada loves it so much that it
has a cameo on some of their paper
money (though the national sport of
Canada is indeed lacrosse). At this point
in time I am still hard pressed to name
another Canadian export besides hockey
players.

The NHL playoffs are about to start
and believe you me, I would love to give
all the energetic column readers a prediction or some insight as to who I feel might
be coming out on top of the rat race this
year. However, I feel like at this point I am
far too uninformed to make a truly educated guess (twist the knife), so based on
personal preference and prejudice, I
would personally like to see the
Pittsburgh Penguins win the Stanley Cup.
Those of you with your mouths agape
may be asking, "But Kevin, how can you
not pick your hometown, comedy-of-

errors club, the Bruins?" The answer to
that is simple: far too many times I have
watched my hopes for those gallant boys
in gold and black dashed by the Snidely
Whiplash-like Montreal Canadiens.
Though I probably won't be able to
watchmuch of the NHL playoffs this year
because ofSwarthmore's aversion to having TV available, thank God Al Gore
invented the Internet so that I may stay
thoroughly updated and in the fold this
year. I am personally hoping for some
late-game heroics to whet the appetite,
and of course a smattering of playoff
beards to seal the deal. In my opinion, the
playoff beard is an NHL tradition, and
even though many other professional athletes try to copy it, their beards ultimately look like the Oakleys you buy out of a
trash bag in Times Square. So, if you
haven't watched any hockey before in
your life, you should, especially now that
the quest for the Cup is going to start to
heat up. There are currently 16 teams still
left in the hunt, but just like Highlander,
in the end there can be only one.

was not the olowout the 9-0 score might indicate.
Jonathan Lo 'OB and Kevin Shaugnessy 'O9 lost their
eight-game pro set at first doubles 9-7. Lo then lost in
three sets at first singles, 2-6, 6-3, 3-6. JJ England 'O9
and Justin DiFeliciantonio 'lO also lost tight matches
at third and sixth singles, respectively.

Sunday's match was a much tighter affair. After
dropping two of the three doubles matches, the Garnet
came out strong in the singles competition. With Mary
Washington earning victories at first and fifth singles
in two sets and DiFeliciantonio winning at sixth singles after just winning the first set (his opponent
retired when trailing 2-0 in the second set), the match
was set to be determined by second, third and fourth
singles, all of which split the first two sets.
However, according to Centennial Conference rules,
there are not to be any third sets in matches played
indoors. Instead, the matches are to be determined by
super tiebreaks, where the first player to ten points
wins. Shaughnessy won his second match of the day
(he had also won withLo at first doubles), emphatically winning 10-2 at second singles. However, Mark Wee
11 and England each lost 10-7 at third and fourth singles, respectively. These narrow defeats gave
Washington the 6-3 win.

April 10, 2008

"The Washington match turned on just a few points in
the super tiebreaks for the third sets," Coach Jason Box
said. "We had done a good job of fighting back at #2, #3 and
#4 singles to get them to a 3rd set, but when you only play
a super tiebreak to decide a match, anything can happen."
The loss to Washington was the Garnet's first
Conference loss of the season, dropping their record to
3-1. However, the loss did little to dampen the team's
optimism, as Box said, "I think the main thing we can
take away from the Washington match is the excitement of knowing we will most likely get to play them
again in the conference tournament on a neutral court
and this time we will be ready for them."
The men's team is very busy from here on. Starting
Saturday, they will play five matches over the course
of eight days, including four Conference matches.
"We have a tough stretch," Box said. "But I think
the guys will be up for it."

On Saturday, April 5, the Garnet played Carnegie Mellon
College (whose squad is ranked eighth in the nation) and lost
8-1 Wallwork defeated Amy Staloch, ranked #6 regionally for
singles, in straight sets for the Garnet's sole win of the day,
which gave her seven consecutive wins.

On Sunday, the team lost tough battles to #7 ranked Mary
Washington, falling 9-0, which ended Wallwork's winning
streak. She is still ranked #1 in singles competition in the

Centennial Conference.
"The match against Mary Washington was tough, but
everyone kept their energy up, had fun and played their
best, which is all anyone can ask for," Wallwork said. She
said she was proud of the team's work and progress.

Stockbower said that although she missed some of the
season due to an overlap with basketball, she felt "happy
with my performance overall. I didn't play with the level of
consistency I would have liked, but for my first match, I
thought it went pretty well," she said. For the rest of the season, she hopes to work on consistency in strategy as well as
serves and groundstrokes.
Coach Jeremy Loomis was very proud of the team for its
progress, calling them "extremely resilient." The team has
been so successful so far this season in part because of its
ability to bounce back from tough defeats, like when they
beat Skidmore College and Washington College 5-4 last
month after falling 9-0 to Johns Hopkins University. "I think
this team has that ability this year, to come back and make
positive things happen after a bit of a slide. That is indicative of the leadership and overall great team chemistry we
have this year," he said.
Loomis praised Wallwork's "hard work in the off-season
and during the year," saying it has "really shown" on the
court. He hopes that she can be nominated for all-conference
honors and to participate in the NCAA tournament. Overall,
he says, "if we can stay focused and use the lessons from our
past matches to improve, we'll be capable of doing great
things at the end of the year."
The Garnet's next match is today at 4 p.m. at Dickinson
College. Its next home match is Saturday at noon against
Muhlenberg College.

Track teams continue to impress in spring
Three women compete at Princeton Men head down home stretch
BY JAYMES FAIRFAX-COLUMBO
jfairfal@swarthmore.edu

This past weekend, the Garnet outdoor track
and field women rewrote the history books. The
Garnet women split their squad, running at the
Princeton University Sam Howell Invitational
last Friday, and at the Richard Stockton Osprey
Open the following day.

The Garnet contingent at Princeton consistNyika
ed of a small group of three runners
Corbett 10, Bess Ritter 'O9 and Cait Mullarkey
'O9. According to head coach Pete Carroll, the
purpose of the Princeton meet was "to give
some of our really fit, upper level athletes
championship caliber preview." The Garnet
trio certainly got that, as they competed against
both national caliber Division IE competition
and Division I competition.

"It was a very violent race
with too many people in the
pack and I got pushed
a lot. There was a lot of
physicality involved."
Melina Healey 'OB
Mullarkey competed in the 1500 meters,
scorching the track in 4:44.84, good for third
place on the Swarthmore all-time list. After so
much success, how does Mullarkey stay motivated to continue dominating her competition?
Melina Healey 'OB and Corbett shed some light
on the situation. According to Healey, "Caithas
an inborn intensity. She's a competitor."
Corbett went a bit farther, joking, "Why
does she race? Cause she's so damn good at it.
It's hard to stop doing something you're good
at."

Corbett and Ritter also put up strong performances, competing in the 5000 meters and
running 18:20.42 and 19:1L90, respectively.
Corbett's performance landed her at fourth

place all time. In describing Corbett's race,
Mullarkey said, "Nyika's race was beautiful to

THE PHOENIX

watch because she's such a smart runner. She
was patient and ran within herself and just

started to drop people."
Corbett was also pleased with her race, stating, "I think I hit my splits pretty well. I was off
a bit at the beginning but I got into my rhythm
and I had a lot left at the end so I plan on lowering that time."
Saturday was also a good day for the Garnet.
Most of the ladies ran multiple events, which
according to Carroll was a strategy 'designed as
extra work to prepare for the championship
part of the season." The event of choice on the
day was the 1500 meters. Healey led the charge
for the Garnet, posting a PR of 5:10.04. She was
followed in by Cait Russell 11 (5:13.44), Ritter
(5:18.45) and Rebecca Woo 11 (5:2106).
When asked about the race conditions that
led to her PR, Healey proclaimed, "It was a very
violent race with too many people in the pack
and I got pushed a lot. There was a lot of physicality involved. I got to the race 20 minutes
before I ran so I was stressed out but it's probably better because I warmed up closer to the
race."
A number of Garnet women also competed
in the 800 meters. Lauren Deluca 'lO posted a
time of 2:33.46, followed in by Russell and Woo.
Deluca, Russell, Healey and Ritteralso got some
speed work in, as Deluca competed in the open
400 and the four combined to run the 4 by 400
meter relay.
Heather Hightower 'O9 was the lone Garnet
field representative, but she certainly made her
performances count, setting an incredible three
PRs at Stockton. Hightower rocketed the shot
910 meters, flung the discus 20.45 meters and
hurled the javelin 1611 meters.
"I ate my Wheaties that morning,"
Hightower said. "Coach is really focusing on
my movement ability and flexibility. We're
doing drills to work on my foot movement and
leg strength. It was also just getting used to the
new events. The shot's still my favorite
though."
The Garnet will next be in action on
Saturday, when action starts live from the
College of New Jersey at 10:00 a.m.

"The season's flying by. Wow!" Dan
Kurz 11 said, upon realizing that there

are three more track meets for the
Swarthmore men's track before they
are due to compete at the Centennial
Conference Championships. The outdoor track season always seems to go
by in a blur, but this past weekend the
men's track team was working hard to
make their mark.

The good times got kicked off on
Friday night when Ross Weller 'OB
competed in the steeplechase at the
Night
Distance
of
Princeton
University's Sam Howell Invitational.
Running in the midst of Division I
competition, Weller ran an impressive
PR of 9:27.88. This time earned him a
tenth place finish in the race as well as
a fourth place slot on Swat's top ten alltime records in the steeplechase, pretty good for his first race of the season.
Asked if he was happy with the race,
Weller said, "I was surprised to run a
PR so early in the season. Hopefully
it'll be a good enough time to let me
run in the Penn Relays."
Saturday's meet, the Osprey Open
hosted by Richard Stockton, also
offered a splendid showing in the steeplechase.

"The season's flying
by. Wow!"
Dan Kurz 'U
"

Jonathan Snoop 'OB won the race
handily in a time of 10:08. His domination was so impressive that teammate
Alex Breslow 'll overheard a spectator
exclaiming, "Look at that guy move!"
Shoop, not one to let compliments
get to his head said, "I was really nervous going into the race because I

haven't been practicing for the steeple
at all, but after the first lap I got my
head into it."
In the sprints, Kurz posted solid

times in both the 200 m and 400 m dashes. He was joined in the 400 by teammate Seth Green'lO who was using the
400 to get in some speed work in order
to improve upon his 800 time.

"I was surprised to run
a PR so early in the
season. Hopefully it'll
be a good enough time
to let me run in
the Penn Relays."
Ross Weller 'OB
Mickey Katz 'OB and Breslow both
ran a demanding 800,1500 double. With
regards to his performance this past
weekend as well as to track in general,
Breslow had only positive remarks,
saying, "I'm just glad to be out here."
Chris Mayer-Bacon 'll rounded out the
track performances with a sound race
in the 400

m

hurdles.

Nick Willet-Jeffries 'lO represented
the throwing squad in the discus. He
was joined by teammate Tommy
Huang 'lO for the shot put and javelin.
All in all, Willet-Jeffries said that
the throws were run in a rather frustrating manner at the Stockton meet.
"There was a cutoff in all four of the
throwing events, so we all got one
throw that they measured, and if you
didn't make the cutoff, they didn't
measure the rest of your throws. So it
kind of sucked." Still, the men did
what they could and gave a good, hard
effort.
The Swarthmore men's track team
will next be in action this coming
Saturday at The College of New Jersey.

explained

Unfortunately come Friday,
Scott Dalane 'OB.
Swarthmore suffered a hard loss to the Bears (12-7, 5-4
CC) 10-1

"They scored all but one of their runs that day in one
inning, which means that for eight of the nine innings we
silenced their bats," explained Conor Casey 'O9. "We just
need to avoid the big inning on defense in the future."
The team agrees. "Friday's loss was a real heartbreaker for us. We wanted to get that one real bad, but it
just got away from us before we even knew it," added
Dylan Smith 'O9. Andy Allen 'll (1-2) picked up the loss,
pitching to start the game for the Garnet.

Saturday afternoon began as a great day for Swarthmore
baseball as they picked up their first win against the
Franklin and Marshal Diplomats (11-10, 6-2), 3-1
The Diplomats have qualified for three of the last four
NCAA Division 111 tournaments. With the win, the Garnet
ended an eight-game, four-year losing streak to the
Diplomats and also put an end to the Dips' current five game
winning streak.
Freshman pitching standout, Neil Mejia 11 (4-2) pitched
all seven innings, striking out four and allowing only three
hits."lt was a big victory for the program," explained Dalane.
"Winning that first game against F&M was the biggest
game in my Swat career, so far at least! We have been working so hard, but getting varied results. That game showed us
all of our work has paid off, and that we can play with anyone," added Smith.
"The best part of the game was watching the confidence
our team played with for all seven innings," said Dalane.
"The best moment of that game for me was the final out,
seeing the ball fall into Thomas Nakamura's glove," said
Casey.

"So much credit to Mejia, he pitched one heck of a game,"
said Smith.
Saturday was also what has become the annual "Ponytail
Day," during which fans are encouraged to sport ponytails,
and any supporting fans received a baseball signed by
Swarthmore junior Dylan "Ponytail" Smith.
This year, Smith was considering donating his hair to
"Locks of Love," a program which takes hair donations to
construct wigs for disadvantaged children suffering from
long term medical hair loss from any diagnosis. (More information on "Locks of Love" can be found at www.locksoflove.org/index.html).
So, arrangements were made to have a barber come to
Swarthmore's field, and Smith got his hair cut between
games in front of fans and teams. "The hair cut between
games was great. I had so much fun, and it looked like
everyone else did too," explained Smith, "It was definitely
somethingI will never forget."

The afternoon then continued with a second match-up
between the Garnet and the Diplomats. "After the first
game win, I knew that we could compete with them, so I
expected that we would play them hard again," said
Casey.
However, in Saturday's second game, Swarthmore fell 12Bto the Dips after a hard-fought battle. "We were feeling confident, but we knew it was going to be a battle the whole
game," said Smith. Adam Koshkin 'll (0-2) picked up the loss
for Swarthmore on the mound.

"We have been working so hard,
but getting varied results. That
game [win over F&M] showed us all
of our work has paid off, and that
we can play with anyone."

Swarthmore returned to the field Tuesday to face a solid

Muhlenberg team, fresh off their victory over defending con-

ference champions #l5 Johns Hopkins. In a game that
scoreless into the fourth inning, in which
Muhlenberg picked up a 6-0 lead, Swarthmore lost 9-2 to the
Mules (13-13, 4-5 CC). "Even with the disappointing results
from Tuesday's game, I know we can win on Friday. I expect
that we will come out with a lot more fire
even at their

place," explained Casey.
Baseball travels to Muhlenberg Friday for a much anticipated rematch. The game is set to start at 3:30 p.m. On
