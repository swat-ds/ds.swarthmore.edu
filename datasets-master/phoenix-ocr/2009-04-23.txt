CRIME UPDATE M

Campus robbery one of possible spree
According to the Swarthmore Police, the
armed robbery that took place on campus
last Tuesday, April 14 may have been connected to two other nearby robberies that
took place in close proximity.
The incident on campus occurred at 11:55
p.m. on Tuesday when a visiting Villanova
student was accosted on his way to Bond Lot
by two armed males who "produced a gun
and demanded his wallet," according to an
April 15, 2009 Public Safety Bulletin. The
incident was witnessed by a Swarthmore
student, and police were able to sketch a
general description of the actors, but no
more specific evidence has been unearthed
in the robbery investigation.
In this case, the incident may be part of a
larger spree of robberies. Approximately 40
minutes preceding the campus incident,
another robbery took place in a CVS
Pharmacy parking lot in Springfield
Township. According to a Fox 29 News
report, the victim of this robbery was headed for his car when he was hit, threatened
with a gun and then robbed of his wallet.
Police suspect this earlier robbery and
the one on campus may have been connected.
"As close as they were in date and time,
the. fact that there was two males at each
occurrence
I'm sure that there's some
kind of relationship that we'll be able to
track down," said Leutenant Bill Clark of
Springfield Township Police Department in
an interview with Fox 29 News.
The same criminals may also have been
involved in a third robbery, which took
place later in the week at the Springfield
Office Depot, according to Borough Chief of
Police Brian Craig. Witnesses observed only
one perpetrator in this incident, whereas
both the Swarthmore and CVS robberies
clearly involved a pair, but Craig said this
does not necessarily mean that only one person was involved in the third robbery. The
robber may have been communicating by
cell phone with an accomplice during or following the incident, according to Craig.
Police for a time considered the possibility that a car theft which took place
Thursday morning in Nether Providence
could be linked to the other crimes, but they
rejected this consideration upon further
investigation of the incident, according to
the Fox 29 News report. "Right now it does-

April 23, 2009

n't look like it was tied to the robberies,"
Craig said, explaining that there were no
guns involved in the car theft and that the
perpetrators were suspected to be younger
than those involved in the robberies.
No suspects have yet been apprehended
in investigations of the robberies. When
asked about police outlook on the apprehension of the criminals, Craig said "it's too
early to tell" if police are likely to catch anyone. "Right now I think that they're very
optimistic that they're going to get somebody for the Office Depot robbery, [but] I
hate to speculate on this type of thing."
One reason for optimism in investigating
the Office Depot robbery is that hard physical evidence was obtained in the investigation of the crime. And because all three
crimes appear to be connected, apprehension of the criminals involved in any one of
the incidents might mean a clearer picture
of those involved in the other crimes,
according to Craig. In the case of an arrest
for the Office Depot robbery, he said, police
may be able to obtain a confession to the
other robberies if indeed the same criminals
were involved.
While the Springfield Township Police
Department is currently working with more
information regarding the crime spree than
is the Swarthmore Department, the two will
continue to work in collaboration to apprehend the robbers.
According to Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, within the last ten years
there have only been two on-campus incidents to compare with the robbery. In 2000,
several students were robbed at gunpoint
near the Sharpies tunnel, and in 2006 an
unarmed robber snatched a purse from
someone. In neither incident was anyone
seriously injured.
Redgrave commented that though such
crimes are few and far in between at
Swarthmore, "When you look at crime in the
surrounding communities, it's not surprising that once in a while that crime touches
us."
Anyone with more information regarding
the incident on campus or those taking place
should contact

impaired.

"It's fun to hypothesize about what's
going on," he said. "But really the ultimately cool thing[s]
and the reason
why I wanted to pursue both psychology
and the biology in this sense
are the
clinical aspects, the aspects of the
research in the foreseeable future that
to
actually have some relevance
improving the human condition."
Keefe and six other students at the
college may soon be part of this kind of
progressive endeavor. Ami Belmont 'O9,
Connor Darby 'O9, Andres Freire 'lO,
Christopher Mayer-Bacon 'll, Lauren
Walker 'O9, Kate Walton 11, and Keefe
are working in psychology professor
Allen Schneider's lab, studying the
effect of stress on memory in rats. In the
future, this research could play a fundamental role in knowing how to clinically treat people with stress-related memory disorders, such as Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder.
"The therapeutic implications are
clear," Schneider said. He explained
that if what holds true from work on
rats in the laboratory holds true for people with a genetic predisposition for
PTSD then "the obvious next step is to
develop drugs to offset those genetic
effects."
Schneider's lab has discovered that,
for memory in rats, there is a natural
protective mechanism activated during
stress that prevents a memory from
becoming too excessive or too weak,
leading to the creation of an "optimal
memory." When the lab compromised
this mechanism with a drug, the memory became abnormal in its strength.
Schneider believes that there is a
similar sort of mechanism in humans
that, when compromised under stress,
makes memories become abnormally
strong. PTSD is the most notable example because it is characterized by abnormally strong and emotionally evasive
memories after a particularly traumatic
incident.
PTSD is on a national rise, often getting the name "Soldier's Disease"
because of veterans' duress after being
in combat, Belmont said. Belmont, like
Darby, is writing her thesis on how
stress affects memory, drawing from
research that she has been conducting
with Schneider since last summer.
Keefe added that, for people with
PTSD, "the initial memory is so powerful that it becomes an evasive thought...
The memory keeps playing back."And
PTSD isn't just psychologically harming
it physically "can rack hell on your
body," Keefe added.
Darby and Keefe explained some of
the procedures that the lab has done.
The experimenters had an apparatus
that is split into two compartments, one
light and one dark. When the rat ran to
the dark compartment, it got a shock
known as "a learning experience." The
researchers then either did or didn't
inject the rat with the drug naloxone.
The next day, researchers found that the

The lab also found that a rat's memo-

ry of the shock was impaired the

next

day after it had the intense stress condition of swimming for fifteen minutes
and after it had naloxone. Conversely, a
rat's memory was actually enhanced the
next day after it had the mild stress condition of being in a dimly lit space and

after it had naloxone.
Walton, Darby and Keefe said that it's
often clinically infeasible, however, to
treat people hours after their emotional
or, for that matter, know
trauma
which patients will be affected or if they
have a genetic predisposition for the disorder. To deal with this, Schneider's lab
is exploring if a memory's emotional
duress can be dampened not only after it
has been newly acquired, but also when
it's been reactivated.
In this experience, Darby said that
instead of having the drug manipulation
on the first day, the lab has it on the second day after reactivating the memory
somehow. They could do this through
putting the rats in the dark, forcing
them to recall the memory, and then
subsequently have drug manipulation
with different degrees of stress. Darby
said that impaired retention on the
third day led the lab to believe "that you
can impair retention of fear-related
memory with naloxone, and the key to
naloxone's effectiveness is whether"
you have this stress.
When asked if the lab's work was
unique, Walton felt confident
"[for]
an undergraduate school, definitely,"
she said.
She added that the experience is also
unique
for the students. Since
Schneider is looking to publish his
work, Walton described the students'
work with him as an "intimate look into
not only experiments, but also publishing articles."
"It's a really rare opportunity to be
that involved with research," she said.
"Not only am I carrying out the
research, but I'm also in discussions
with Professor Schneider in the implications of the research, interpreting the
results, and coming up with additional
experiments."
Belmont agreed, speaking about how
she sees this research already affecting
her future. Her work with Schneider at
the college has given her a foundation
for graduate school and research positions after college, she said.
"The experience has definitely
impacted my decision to pursue
research jobs after graduation, as well
as to pursue a Ph.D in clinical psychology with an emphasis on neuroscience
later," she added.
And when asked what the students
have added to the research, Schneider
spoke highly of their work with him: "A
freshness, a willingness to look at the
research and literature in new ways,
and often seeing beyond the narrowing
impact of the disciplinary perspectives."

NOTA shakes elections yet leaves no vacancies

swarthmorephoenix.com

On the eve of the Student Council presi-

dential elections, an anonymous, studentgenerated push to encourage students to
vote "None of the Above" on the ballot
emerged as a response to the low number of
Student Council candidates and to a perceived inadequacy in those candidates run-

ning. The push, commonly referred to as the
NOTA campaign despite the absence of an
explicit leadership and agenda, manifested

itself in the form of posters, e-mails, word of
mouth and discussions on the comments
forum of the Daily Gazette website.
The campaign had no leaders and was
not affiliated with any other campus
groups. Danielle Noble 'l2 called the term
"campaign" a misnomer. "Anyone who
agrees with [this] perspective is quote
unquote part of that campaign," she said.

The NOTA movement emerged after the
presidential debate on Wednesday, April 15

between candidates Rachel Bell 10 and
Shaun Kelly 10 left several attendees dissat-

isfied with the quality of debate and the
paucity of candidate running. Six students
ran for five positions in the election. The

presidency was the only contested position.
At a StuCo meeting on Sunday, April 19,
members of StuCo emphasized that in the
case of a "None of the Above" victory, a second set of elections would occur this semester in order to not lose the current makeup
of the student body. This would be in keeping with the constitution.
At midnight on Tuesday, April 21 election results circulated by the current StuCo
informed the student body that all five positions had been filled. Additionally, the numbers indicated that a large portion of the student body had voted either "None of the

Above" or "No Preference," with a smaller
but also significant number of Write-ins.
Rachel Bell 10 won the presidency with 292
votes to Shaun Kelly's 10 205, and NOTA's

276.
"I'm happy to have won," Bell said, "but
it was so close that that makes me a bit
nervous. At the same time, I feel more
inspired to build bridges with the students
who ardently supported the campaign
There are a lot of people involved with
NOTA, so there's a lot of outreach I want to
do," she said.
"Despite the outcome, students shouldn't
...

think it's over and done. Students should
talk about what's really important to them
and how we can represent the student body
in a more efficient way," said President of
Student Council Yongjun Heo 'O9.

Even though a second set of elections
won'tbe held, supporters ofNOTA maintain
that the campaign has already had an
impact in opening up a dialogue regarding
the inadequacies of StuCo as a governing
body out-of-touch with . diverse student
needs.
Daniel Symonds 11 a proponent of the
NOTA movement who circulated an e-mail
elucidating his motivations, still considers
the campaign to have had an impact.
"Already we've shifted the debate," he said.
"In a way, NOTA has already been successful."

Heo agreed. "I think that it's a very beneficial thing for all this to have occurred
even though it was brought about in a negative light. It will force Rachel to address the
issues that were brought up. We've seen
more now than ever before more NOTA
votes for all five positions. This raises the
question of how the next student council
can work with and work for the student
body," he said.
In his e-mail, Symonds explained that
the NOTA campaign was about more than
just this election's particular set of candidates. "We wish to start a campus-wide conversation about the possibility for a new

THE PHOENIX

interpretation of Student Council that is
more in touch with the needs of our diverse
student body."
He explained that part of the movement's
view of the elections grew out of the presidential debate last Wednesday, during
which some perceived that candidates did
not demonstrate adequate engagement with
or knowledge of IC/BCC and activist groups.
In response to NOTA, Heo invited students to the StuCo meeting on Sunday, April
19 to voice their opinions. The turnout
demonstrated the desire of supporters of the
movement to have their voices heard. StuCo
Vice President Nate Erskine 10 opened up
the discussion. "I would love to hear suggestions of how you think Student Council
could reach out and get more people to run,"

he said.
While students suggested concrete
changes, such as offering clearer job
descriptions, they pointed out that restructuring the council itself would invite a

greater number of candidates.
"Is there a way that we can collectively

re-imagine StuCo?" Sable Mensah 11 asked.
"Why would I vote for something or run for
something if it doesn't affect my day-to-day
life? I think StuCo is closer to the administration than to the student body." Mensah
said that she wanted to see a council that is
less neutral and more involved in aligning
itself with the needs of a diverse student

body.

Other students had similar concerns
about the council's and the candidates' relationship with the students they represent.
11, president of
Paul Wiggins

African-American Student
Society, said that he received an e-mail from
a candidate several hours before platforms
were due requesting a lunch meeting to discuss the concerns of the black community.
He and Stephanie Rodriguez 'l2, who told a
similar story with respect to the Latino
community, emphasized that this type of
dialogue should be happening year-round
not solely before elections as a campaigning
strategy. "Why now?" Rodriguez asked.
Sunday's meeting generated several concrete suggestions, such as printing a handout explaining StuCo, blogging in ,
place of posting meeting minutes and
having a StuCo meet-and-greet during
Swarthmore

elected Campus Life Representative, have a
more positive view of the campaign. "That's
the risk of putting yourself out there," Heo
said. "[The campaign] will prevent people
who are simply running just to run."
Student Groups Advisor Ben Francis 'l2,
on the other hand, felt that the NOTA campaign overlooked the individual platforms.
"The problem with this particular campaign is that it has not focused on the specific candidates themselves in the uncontested positions. Instead, it has just focused
on the fact that there is no opposition," he
said.
For those who supported NOTA, the
point of the movement was to go beyond the
specific candidates to address larger issues.
"It's not simply just 'None of the Above' as
an attack on these candidates, but more of a
no confidence vote in our student government," Symonds said.
Symonds cited the financial justice campaign last semester as an instance when
Student Council could have stepped in to
help the student cause. "Student Council is
in such a weak position and we feel that
Student Council's role at Swarthmore
should be one of a much more strong advocate for student concerns," Symonds said.
He believes that the council has the opportunity to affect even more change in the context of the current financial crisis.
Cecilia Marquez 'll does not consider
herself part of a formal campaign, but she
also chose to vote NOTA for all positions for
similar reasons. "For me personally as a
student on this campus, a Student Council
president has to come to the position with
an understanding of the IC and BCC com-

paign, a group of anonymous students operating under the name OOTA posted flyers
around campus encouraging students vote

for "One of the Above." On the fliers, OOTA
leaders described the movement as 'a secret
underground organization for democratic
efficiency whose sole purpose is to combat

NOTA."
The campaigning tactics of OOTA were
also discussed at the Sunday StuCo meeting.
OOTA signs were posted around campus
and on an IC board, which upset many in
the IC community because they felt it was a
personal attack. This parody echoes students' complaints about the anonymity of
NOTA that have appeared in the numerous
Daily Gazette comments and during the
Student Council meeting. "There was a big
blame game," said Bell of the Gazette comments. "That's the problem with [the cam-

x

paign] being anonymous."
The placement of posters also raised
questions about this anonymity. Some students felt that having posters on an IC board
falsely linked the campaign to their groups.
"I feel that I have personally been stigmatized, just that I'm part of that community,"

Lisa Sambat 'lO said.
In an e-mail to students, Heo called the
posters "sn intrusion of IC space." The email continued, "Student Council would
like to make sure that these spaces are free

from disturbance."
NOTA was not the first campaign of its
type. In the fall of 2005, the "None of the
Above" option received more votes than the
Student Council Appointments Chair candidate Ethan Ucker 'O7. This result was'in part
due to a similar campaign.
Following its constitution, Student
Council held a new election the next semester, this time without Ucker.
The "None of the Above" option in the

Like Mensah and Symonds, she cited the
council's neutrality as another reason for
her decision. "Student Council is not will-

ing to take a stance on anything," Marquez
said. "It's become this thing where you
show up and do your term and there's not a
progression towards anything." She wants
to see a council that makes better use of its
access to influential spaces such as the
Board of Managers meetings.

said Bell, who emphasized repeatedly
throughout her campaign her pledge to
reach out to more students and student
groups.
Heo echoed this sentiment and

added that the campaign succeeded in
opening up a forum for student concerns. "There are a number of positives
about the NOTA campaign," he said. "It
raises questions about whether candidates are qualified or not qualified."
Members of the current council and
the candidates had a mixed response to
the campaign. Before the election, Bell
noted that she initially felt personally
attacked. "The posters were so vague,"
she said. "They didn't specify why they
were disappointed."
Now that she more fully understands the campaign, however, her
views have changed. "I realize the concerns, but I don't see why that leads to
this campaign," she said. She felt that
the candidates who were already running could address the concerns raised
by those supporting NOTA without a
second set of elections.
She also worried that the NOTA
campaign would exacerbate the problem of having a low number of candidates. "It makes the risk of putting
yourself out there greater."

Demarcating the jurisdictions of campus security

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ASHIA TROIANO
atroianl@swarthmore.edu

"The [Borough] Police don't do anything here that they can't do in the real
world," Reid Wilkening 'lO, Pittenger Ist
RA, said. "We pretend that Swarthmore

isn't the real world, but we are. The
Police do the same things here that they
would do anywhere else."
And although both the Police and the
college Public Safety are authorized to
respond to a number of overlapping scenarios, the two work together to maintain a division of jurisdiction that makes
sense: generally, Public Safety addresses
problems that affect student and campus
security while the Swarthmore Borough
Police deals with incidents that occur
outside the college, have legal ramifications or that affect the health of students.
"If the case requires prosecution, or
there are any crimes where an apprehension is made, it is done by the police.
If it is a college incident, Public Safety is
more than capable of handling it," Chief
of Swarthmore Borough Police Brian
Craig said.
Following up on the case of gunpoint
robbery that happened on campus last
week, for example, falls under the
province of the Borough Police. "This is
really the police's case to figure out who
did this," Associate Dean for Student
Life Myrt Westphal said.
"There is very little interaction by
our department into Swarthmore
Borough concerns," Owen Redgrave,
Director of Public Safety, said in an email. Even when dealing with situations
concerning students, Public Safety will
call for assistance from the police if necessary. In 2006, Public Safety called the
Swarthmore Police for backup when
dealing with a student causing a disturbance near Phi Psi. The incidentresulted
in an arrest and a number of citations.
The police are in a position to get
involved any time they judge necessary.
"Public Safety officers are not armed, so
if the officer will be in danger handling
the incident by him or herself, we will
respond," Craig said. "If there is a call in
progress, we respond. If it is a minor
incident, the Public Safety officer will
take a report. We take over if there is a
prosecution," Craig said. "And the Public
Safety officer will be called to testify in
the court case."
Craig cited a case in which a suspected criminal did not respond to the Public
Safety officer's orders and instead ran
away. The Public Safety officer called the
police and the suspect was later caught.
The officer will now appear as a witness
in court.
It is routine for the Swarthmore
police to get involved in incidents that
are medical emergencies. In 2007, when
an ambulance was summoned after a student fell from the stairs in Tarble during
the annual Halloween party, the police
up
showed
moments afterward.
According to a Phoenix article, though
the student was issued a citation for
underage drinking, rumors of increased
police surveillance of the college were
untrue.

Furthermore, it is routine for the
Swarthmore police to ask for backup
from police departments in neighboring
counties.

Citations

Between underage drinking, disorderly conduct and other forms of disturbances, Craig estimates that the depart-

6

ment issues between 20 and 30 citations a
year. "That's probably much lower than
the perception," he said. "A lot are on the
border of the college [property]."
Many citations are given for underage
drinking and behavior associated with
intoxication. "[The police's] philosophy

is if students aren't held accountable,
they will not receive alcohol education,"
Westphal said.
The college receives reports on student citations, to which the college
responds appropriately. The student is
entered into the college's judicial system
with a formal warning and is required to
have a meeting with the deans and the
drug and alcohol counselor. "The first
interaction is gentle. After that, it jumps
up in severity. We use it as a moment of
education," Westphal said.
Craig also estimates that the police
respond to a disturbance about once a
month. "It's gone down in past years
because we work with the college to minimize that. We're looking for cooperation, not confrontation," he said.
Patrolling the Borough and college campus

The Swarthmore police patrol the
neighborhood, which includes both residential and campus areas, several times
a day to maintain a regular
presence. "In a 12 hour shift,
we'll cover the entire borough
twice," Craig said. "Officers
might make two passes, or
there may be two officers doing
patrol."
Furthermore, the police do

not increase their

spires every day," Redgrave said in an e-

mail.
Both Public Safety and the police are
able to listen to the other's radio transmissions on their own radios by listening to each other's bands. While each
party can hear the other, they are not
able to communicate using that method.
Many times, the police are notified of
and respond to incidents in this way.
Craig cited public drunkenness as an
example. "We usually turn them over to
Public Safety. [The officers] may hear
[the college's band] and respond to it
anyway."

For a number of years, the college and
the police department have engaged in
monthly meetings that "serve mostly to
reinforce relationships and review current issues," according to Stuart Hain,
Vice President of Facilities and Services.
Members of the college as well as the
Borough Council and Swarthmore
Mayor Eck Gerner attend these meetings.

"The principal purpose of the meetings is to ensure good communication
between the College and the borough,
especially on issues related to safety and
security," Jim Larimore, Dean of
Students, said in an e-mail. "In the past
year,

we've discussed concerns about

so there's no reason to increase

patrol unless there's an intoxicated student or something

like that. But we wouldn't
know about that before it happens."
Craig said that during a normal patrol, the officers look for
suspicious activity. "There's
no set route; that would negate
the idea of [patrolling]," he
said. "We only patrol in vehicles. We don't get out and do
foot patrols."

during certain times of the
year. With regards to major
parties and campus events,
Craig said, "They've been pretty well handled by the college,

traffic and pedestrian safety, town-gown
relations in general, emergency preparedness, issues involving student safety and our mutual efforts to locate a
missing student, among other topics."
Westphal said that the meetings allow
both groups to "talk from both perspectives, about what each of our philosophies are
It has led to a reduction of
tension between the two approaches.
They see that our job is education."
The meetings take place on the Police
Department's grounds. "It is a symbolic
expression of our desire to work together," Westphal said.
"I think the meetings have positively
affected our work together. They have
also served to allow us to work effectively through issues that may have caused
tension in the past," Hain said.
According to Westphal, these meetings made it easier for the College and
the police to work together to find
Matthew Baldwin. "We all knew each
other. It wasn't a matter of who was in
charge," Westphal said.
Craig said that the police, who assist
in RA and SMART training, are always
open to communication with whomever
wishes to do so.
"We make ourselves available to meet
with anyone," Craig said.

Rape and Sexual Assault ASA group aims to halt
Week supports survivors construction of casino
BY ANDREW THOMPSON

BIICONEWS.COM, APRIL 13

About 15 Haverford students stood

out on the Coop patio under a clear

night sky, holding candles, on the
evening of Wednesday, April 8. This
was the start of Haverford's secondannual "Take Back the Night" march
against sexual violence. The march

was the first of many events, as part
of Rape and Sexual Assault
Awareness Week at Haverford
College, sponsored by the Women's
Center.
Over the next 30 minutes, the
group would walk through the night
to Founders Common Room, stopping
in places along the way to read works
of poetry and literary art by candlelight that described the roots and horrors of rape and sexual assault.
"It's a way for survivors of rape
and sexual assault to take back their
voice," said Stephanie Contreras 'll,
who works at the Women's Center.
"You can't take back the experience,
but it's a matter of the community
understanding the horror that these
survivors underwent."
The march's destination was the
Speak Out event, a time for survivors
and members of the community to sit
in silence, and hear and attempt to
understand the stories of survivors.
Other events during the week
included Haverford's version of the
national Clothesline Project, a variety
of t-shirts set out on clotheslines on
Founders Green. The shirts were all
created by members of the Haverford
community, said Contreras.
"It's a very in-your-face visual to
illustrate what goes on, and a
metaphor of 'airing out the dirty laundry,'" she said.
Students' Council Co-President
Harrison Haas 'lO said that he really
appreciated the Clothesline Project.
"Not only did it reach out to students,
professors saw it too. I saw a professor in between classes who asked me
what it was. It's a great educational
project," Haas said.
Another component of the week,
the "Solidarity Board," was in the
Dining Center Lobby from Friday to
Sunday.

Community members could take
ribbons and pin them to the board
and write short messages, symbolizing their pledge to be aware of sexual
assault.
"It's a powerful way of bringing it
to the community, in their own
words," said Contreras.
"[The week] is supposed to be in
your face and confrontational," continued Contreras. "We need to make
people
aware and bring it to
Haverford's consciousness."
"So much goes unreported," said
Students' Council Co-President Will
Harrison 'lO. "Unless there's some
Honor Council Dean's Panel, you just
don't hear about this stuff, so there's
a little bit of disbelief."
"I think as a community, we need
to understand that Haverford isn't
infallible when it comes to these situations. They're part of our society, so

THE PHOENIX

we bring it to this space," Contreras
said.
According to the Haverford College
Safety and Security website, four
cases of sexual violence were reported in 2008, the latest year for data, and
six cases each were reported in 2007
and 2006.
Reporting of sexual violence on
college campuses is mandatory as a
result of The Cleary Act, explained
Vice President for Finance and
Administration and Treasurer G.
Richard Wynn.
"The act was passed a decade ago.
A local family's daughter was raped
and murdered in a dormitory at
Lehigh, and they got a federal law
passed. We must report crime statistics on campus, and rape and sexual
assault fall in that category," said
Wynn. "This is not something you
fool around with, you don't cover up
statistics."
"Anytime an administrator hears
of a sexual assault, that gets reported
confidentially to Safety and Security,"
said Dean of the College Greg
Kannerstein '63.
"A lot of times a student would
come in and say T know that this happened,' and sometimes we would try
to reach out to the survivor," continued Kannerstein. "But you can't force
someone to take measures, but we
would hope they would get involved
in the system one way or another."
Kannerstein said, "The reports can
come from a variety of places.
Sometimes people may call security,
often it's health services. In each
case, people are trained to tell them
the options available, both legally and
medically."
Internally, Kannerstein explained,
Honor Council has two methods of
dealing with cases of sexual assault,

the Dean's Panel or the Joint Studentto
According
Dean's
Panel.
Kannerstein, the first Dean's Panel on
an instance of sexual violence was in
1980.

When

asked

about what

she

thought of the situation of rape and

sexual assault on Haverford's campus, Contreras said, "I wouldn't say
that we're better or worse [than other
schools], I think that Haverford is just
a smaller scale of what happens outside. Whatever the statistics are on
the outside, we're just a microcosm of
that."
As to ways for improving the situation, Contreras emphasized community awareness. "What we can do is
start talking about it more, air it out,
not have it be a taboo subject," she
said. "It should hit close to home, this
is home. If it becomes a taboo subject,
what kind of community are we fostering?"

Harrison Haas also gave the point
that the Women's Center, which sponsored the Awareness Week and provides a place for discussion, isn't
located in an accessible spot.
"[The Center] has so much to offer,
but it's tucked away in the corner of
[the campus center], and it could be
more effective in a more visible spot
on campus," said Harrison Haas.

Upon returning to Haverford, to
help "make sure those things didn't

happen," he joined ASA and started to
collaborate with the Office of
Multicultural Affairs task force.' In
addition,
Takemoto enrolled in
Professor
Steve
McGovern's
Grassroots Politics in Philadelphia
class, for which he started an internAsian
ship
at
Philadelphia's
Americans United, an organization
dedicated to fostering a sense ofAsianAmerican community in Philadelphia.
It was there that he learned about the
movement to stop the development of
the casino, and has since met with
numerous Asian student groups
throughout the region to raise awareness of the issue and gather petition
signatures.
Those who oppose the casino do so
for several primary reasons. For one,
they feel that the casino, which is
almost certain to raise crime rates,
challenge local businesses and facilitate addictions, is not in the best interests of the residents in the slightest.
"There's a moral reason," said
Takemoto. "Casinos break up families,
they are known to increase rates of
domestic violence and divorce."
Kristin Tan 'l2, who attended the
petition-signing event on April 4, feels
that there must be an alternative
means of garnering revenue than this
imposition on residential life. "If they
have already allocated funds for gambling addiction groups, they acknowledge that there will be a problem," she
said. "There's got to be some other
way."
Some look to the history of casinos
in the U.S. for evidence of this pattern:

Additionally,
those against

decry

Philadelphia
authorities for

approving this

installment.
"The people in the community haven't
been given a venue to voice their opposition to the project. This should be an
expected and essential part of any casino consideration, and the fact that it
isn't in this case is telling of the
administration's priorities," financial
crisis or not, said Kaplan.
"I think that if a community isn't
given the opportunity to voice their
opinion about what they want in their
town, then somebody should try to give
them a voice," said Tan. ASA's job, she
adds, is to combat the fact that the community was cut out of this coalition.
LinKai Jiang 'll feels this issue transcends the casino itself: "Asians or
Asian Americans are seen sometimes
as a quiet race," he said. "If you do
something to them, they won't speak
up. People think they won't respond."
He hopes this effort will challenge that
stereotype.
On his part, Jiang has put together a
short film of the event both to generate
dialogue and preserve institutional
memory for ASA. Jiang screened his

Speaking to mental health Facing off on privelege
ing their importance and impact. Dr.
Chansky
identifies creative and
effective solutions to 'right-size' problems, manage negative thoughts, build
optimism and establish emotional

BY MICHAEL GLUK
mglukl@swarthmore.edu

Throughout the school year, the
organization Speak 2 Swatties has been
mounting popularity and awareness.
Co-directed by Megan Jeffreys 'lO and

Melissa Cruz 'lO, the mental health
group seeks both to raise awareness
about mental health concerns on campus and to provide a peer counseling
service to students whose wellness concerns need to be addressed.
In its efforts to bring mental health
into the limelight of public concern,
Speak 2 Swatties solicits opinions on
widespread psychological ailments
throughout the Swarthmore student
body. "We simply listen to what concerns students are expressing with
issues pertaining to mental health,"
Cruz said regarding the process of
unearthing psychological concerns in
an environment where addressing such
issues remains somewhat taboo.
Jeffreys said, "I think a lot of what
we've done this semester is going broad
to narrow in terms of the focus of our
events. At first, we held a lot of discussions about general mental health; now,
we're working on specific issues."
While Speak 2 Swatties addresses many
clinically diagnosable disorders
recently, the organization has held panels and discussions on anorexia and
other eating disorders
what makes
the group unique is its ability to illuminate less obvious and, in turn, more
widespread and equally destructive
trends of unhealthy psychological
activity.
Unsurprisingly, Speak 2 Swatties has
targeted the oppressive atmosphere of
general
negative
thinking
on

Swarthmore's campus. Students have
so embraced a generally pessimistic
perspective that they even leverage
their "in the slumps" mentality for
humor. Perhaps, Speak 2 Swatties suggests, this is not so comical as it is simply unhealthy.
In effort to address this dependency
on despair, Speak 2 Swatties is holding
a "Gratitude Week" to commence this
coming Monday. Jeffreys said, "What
makes it difficult to develop a healthy

attitude in Swarthmore is its culture of
misery. We're trying to target and
change this." The week is preceded by a
workshop this Thursday, run by Tamar
Chansky 'B4, titled "Freeing Ourselves
from Negative Thinking." Negative
thinking, the press release reads,
"supersizes our problems by exaggerat-

resilience." The week itself will consist
of several discussions and activities,
including a movement to leave positive
and inspiring notes for individual students. The group invites everyone, on
the Sunday night preceding the festivities, to participate in a campus chalking to promote what Jeffreys called the
"positive psychology movement."
Additionally, Speak 2 Swatties has
started Swarthmore's first peer-counseling service. Continuing its trend of
addressing all mental wellness concerns as opposed to exclusively diagnosable maladies, the service is available to anyone for any reason. Unlike in
a formal psychiatric practice, peer
counselors are not trained in clinical
psychology and do not dictate a course
of action, but simply listen. Cruz said,
"We're not there to offer advice, and
we're not therapists. We're just there to
offer support and to be non-biased listeners." Jeffreys added, "We're providing an experience that is especially
reflective and focused on you." This
theory is evidenced in the counselor
selection process. Jeffreys said, "We
don't look for specific qualifications;
instead, we do a mock counseling session." Cruz said, "We're looking for
someone who will be there in the
moment, present with you, willing to
make it completely about your time."
Peer counciling offers a service distinct from those provided by a school
administration. Silbia Han 'l2, a potential candidate for a peer counseling
position next fall, said, "When it comes
to peer counseling, you're able to relate
more to what the student is going
through because you're both in the
same atmosphere. It also feels more natural and comfortable to speak to someone your own age because, despite what
school services say about confidentiality, you're always conscious of their ties
to the administration."
Speak 2 Swatties is currently in the
process of selecting new counselors in
the fall. "We're continually focused on
trying to produce an ongoing dialogue,"
Cruz said, urging anybody interested in
participating in Speak 2 Swatties in any
form to contact either herself or Megan
Jeffreys.

editor for The Phoenix, but had no role

response to
two young

men

who

responded
to
my

recent

Facebook
status.
It
read:
"I
all
hate
white, hetLauren Ramanathan
erosexual,
Lil' Reezy's Biweekly Wisdom middle
class men.
■■■■■■■■■■■lH
They are assholes, all of them!" Now the
first young man who is from my hometown commented on the status by rewriting the same statements only directing
them at "brown, homosexual, working
class women." The other individual who
goes to Swarthmore commented asking
me if I was referring to all white men as
assholes. When I deletedboth these comments, the second individual posted
very angrily calling me personally "an
ASSHOLE AND IDIOT," saying that
clearly I was uninterested in starting a
dialogue, that he "worked for Feminist
Majority" and that he had taken a long
time to think about the ways in which he
was privileged. Well, this column is an
attempt to start the dialogue that I was
so rudely accused of evading.
Obviously, I don't really think that all
white men are assholes. However, I do
hate structures of privilege that favor
white, heterosexual, middle to upper
class men. My Facebook status was a
direct response to a situation (many situations, in fact) where I had felt silenced
by others who have privilege. Obviously,
such statements are interpreted and
taken very personally. Still, I believe
that the two individuals who responded
to my Facebook status exemplify some of
the fundamental hypocrisy that exists
within discussions on privilege.
Dealing with the first individual is
fairly easy, as there is an obvious difference between calling out identities that
are privileged in higher education and
other realms of power and denigrating
those who have been historically and
still are oppressed. There is no arbitrary
double standard here. History speaks for
itself. However, there is a common
strain that runs through both individuals' comments, and that is an anger that
stems from feeling attacked that elides
the injustices that drove me to make
such an admittedly unfair statement in
the first place. As I said, I do not honest-

April 23, 2009

ly believe that all white men are ass-

holes. But there are times in which I feel
broken by the ways in which the "real
world" works. It's become evident to me
that higher education still regularly
capitulates to larger structures of
oppression, which is disappointing to
say the least, heartbreaking to say the
most. It might be appropriate to insert
here that my writing said status was
simply an attempt to vent anger at a system. We11... really... that's not true
it
was venting at specific individuals, with
whom I am forced to interact, and who
not only benefit from the system of
oppression in which we live, but embody
privilege in ways that have prevented
me from getting the most out of my educational experience.
Which brings me to the second individual who commented on my status.
His comments are the hardest to analyze. But I can start by saying that his
statement accusing me of "not wanting
to start a dialogue" simply betrays his
privilege. He can afford to be objective,
to start a dialogue, because he is not constantly embroiled in a. battle for survival
that is necessitated by his identities.
Damn right I didn't want to start a dialogue! I was FUCKING FED UP! Did it
ever occur to him that maybe I didn't
want to engage with him right then and
there because 1) I, as a queer woman of
color, have had to engage in so many
'dialogues" just for my own self-preservation, with so many hurtful misunderstandings that I just wanted to vent on
my own Facebook page without repercussion? 2) Facebook is a shitty forum
for communication anyways?
It is extremely interesting to me that
my comments aroused such furor in
these two individuals, who had obviously put no thought into why an individual
who is oppressed would make such a
statement. So often on this campus and
in this world people say and do things
that are totally problematic and oppressive and yet go unchallenged. Where is
the ire for them? Why are they allowed
to feel safe? I readily admit that my
Facebook status conveyed what is perhaps an unfair blanket generalization.
But I stand by it, like it or not. It was the
perfect verbalization of how I was feeling at the time. I was reacting to a very
real and deeply felt oppression that is
neither rational nor eloquent. Which is
why we should perhaps look within ourselves before pointing the finger at those
who do not have privilege.

choice. "I don't pretend that it's
the wilderness. It's a ranch, so
it's completely cultivated. I'm
not trying to put forth a myth of
the beautiful untouched landscape." She chooses her subjects
according to visual appeal and a
personal connection, instead of
according to an artistic agenda.
Unfortunately, Lopez has
faced challenges with her subject choice. A vast majority of
her work for this exhibition has
been created in Pennsylvania,
instead of on location. The fact
that her family sold the ranch
several years ago is no great
help, either. Instead, Lopez
relies on a combination of memories and photos, some of which
were taken by her father for her
mother back when the two were
dating. As a result, "[the work]
becomes this sort of interplay
between my memory, my own
nostalgia and the photographs."
Lopez has done a fine job of
rendering the images in those
terms, and her exhibition presents a cohesive artistic viewpoint. The juxtaposition of her
works alongside Zebi Brown's
promises food for thought.

Jake Mrozewski Phoenix Staff

Sofia Lopez 'O9 will be bringing a small taste of life on a
Texas ranch to Swarthmore this
week, when her senior art exhibition opens on Thursday.
Calling herself a "transplant" to
Swarthmore from Texas, Lopez
has spent much of this past
semester thinking about what

she's missing.
One image will dominate her
exhibit, in various iterations:
that of the family ranch. Unable
to return to the ranch after its
sale during her teen years, the
place has maintained a hold on
Lopez and her family which is
clear in her work. As she
explained it, "It's interesting to
me to think of this place where

my father grew up, and he and
my mother were there as they
were courting and they took me

there subsequently as a child.

We've all had a very intimate
connection to it at different

points in our lives."

What she puts forth, however, is not particularly sentimental. Her landscapes are broad
and unpopulated and her drawing of the town nearest to the
ranch is similarly focused on the
simple lines and creating a
sense of air. When drawing comparisons to her strongest artistic
influence, William Kentridge,
Lopez said, "[My work] is far
more simple and personal. I
don't really bave any grand
political statement to make at
this point; I just really like the
images."

Zebi Brown 'O9 is fea-

turing her senior art exhibition in the List Gallery
this Thursday. Regarding
her exhibition, Brown
said, "My work isn't thematic It's not about the

subject." The content of
Brown's art runs the
gamut from landscapes to
still-life's to self-portraits.
But, for Brown, the manner in which the subject is
drawn is more interesting

than the subject

itself.

"You can draw anything in
the same way. It's not
about what's in it. It's
about how you make the
marks, how you approach
it, how you're looking at it.
It's a lot about looking."
Recently, Brown has

'

been mostly concentrating
on charcoal drawings after
an eight-week summer program inspired her to delve
into the medium more
deeply. Although there are
a few oil paintings and
pencil drawings among the
collection of mostly charcoal works, Brown said
"Even the paintings are
sort of done the way that
drawings are. It's pretty
much a drawing show."
Within drawing, Brown
is interested in a wide
of styles.
"It's
range

always a matter of what
ideas occur to me or what I
think
is
important,"
Brown said. "There was a

Brown added, "It's not

MR. SWARTHMORE 2009
In its third year, the annual Mr. Swarthmore
pagaent hosted by the Ladies Soiree Society (LaSS)
has earned a reputation as anight ofhilarious entertainment for students, adhiinistrative staff and visiting friends and family. This year's contest didn't
disappoint as 14 contestants vied for the audience's
love and for the Mr. Swarthmore sash by boasting
their talents and ability to make fun of themselves.
There was no shortage of laughs, or of anything for
that matter; the event was a butt-numbing three
hours. After a video introducing the contestants as
if in a dating service, the contestants took on the
runway with their own widely-varying interpretations of "'formal wear" and "bathing suit wear,"
most notably Simon Zhu 11 as Mr. SBC who sported
a bikini. Talents ran the gamut from many a karoke
session to the lassoing of a fellow student by Bradi
Covert 'O9 as Mr. Rugby. A common strategy for
many seemed to be: if all else fails* strip. Ultimately,
it was Grant Yoshitsu 'O9 as Mr. Nothing who took
the win, it seems, largely by stealing the heart of
judge Dean Myrt Westphal. The event also raised
money for the Philly organization Women's Way.

David Huerta and and his translator, Mark Schafer, read from the
new anthology "Before Saying Any of the Great Words," at
Swarthmore on Thursday, April 16.
On Thursday, April 16, 2009,
award-winning
poet David
Huerta and translator Mark
Schafer came to Swarthmore
on a book tour to read from
their new book, "Before Saying
Any of the Great Words," an
anthology of Huerta's work
from 1972-2003. The reading
was sponsored by the Spanish

the
Swarthmore
Library. Thanks to Professor
Aurora Camacho De Schmidt,

and translated into English by
Prager. It began on the topic of
the phrase, "norte del nombre,"
or "north of the name," from
book-length
poem
the
"Incurable."

David Huerta: If I remember correctly, this image
belongs to "Incurable," a very
long book that I wrote and published in 1987, and "the north of
the name," the complexity of
this image, is in the preposition of the name. "The name" is
something that pertains to the
north, and the north is one of
the cardinal points. So there is
a double meaning, an ambiguity. So we have in the first part,
that "the name" has a "north,"
or the north is something that
pertains to the name.
Here we also have a colloquial expression. "Tener un
norte" means, as you say in
English, to have a clue. So to
have a clue, of a name, is to
understand its significance.
"To know the north" of a name
means to have a clue
the key
of the name is the north of the
name. But the first thing that
occurred to me is that the
name is in the north; that the
name is a place. What kind of
place is it? It is a place thanks
to which we can orient our...

14

selves. Language is what permits us to have orientation.
Language is a map, or a continent. How do we orient ourselves in reality? What is our
route, our compass? Names
and language. So, language is
what allows us to travel
through reality.
It's complicated, but at the
same time, it's very simple.

How do we understand the

world? By talking about the
world. And poetry is very
interesting in this way. You
know, this is the second time
that this phrase has been
brought to my attention. A student of mine asked me what I
was saying with this. So what
we are doing now is like the
second act of a play that was
started before. The name is a
phenomenon, a part of language
and this is the liberty
that poetry gives me. And. it's
also an instrument for navigation.
MP: Many cultures create
...

myths to guide people, using
thousands of words. Your project poetry
is to use very few
words, to reduce the great stories to something essential.
—

What do you think about this
reduction to the minimum?
DH: What you're saying is
something interesting
that
anthropologists and ethnologists study, the mythical consciousness. Everyone, I think,
needs people, reasons, relations, and most of these stories
are mythic, which give basis to
the life of the society, the tribe,
the group, to the big communities and the small communities. And there are many
myths, of the solitary individual, of deities, of creation. But
there are smaller myths, which
are individual myths: our
dreams. No? The myths, the
great stories, are collective
dreams, and dreams are individual myths. Where the collective myths and individual
dreams communicate with
each other, is where poetry

DH: Slimy thoroughfares.
MP: Yes. (laughs)
DH: (laughs) It's from a disk
called Diamond Dogs, which in
itself is a fascinating title. In
my books there are lots of references to what happens to me,
to what I know, to what is in
books, and to what there is in
the modern life and the ancient

life, because the themes of

poetry are all the imaginable

themes. The theme of poetry
isn't death, or love, but anything, it could be a song by
David Bowie, a Russian poem,
the conversation we're having
now
For me, poetry is a total
discourse, a totalizing discourse. And it's especially
valuable because it sets us
apart from the instrumental
use of language.
MP: Hm, I'm not sure I
understand what you 're saying.
DH: When we sit at the table
and say, "Give me a saltshaker," that's an instrumental use
of language, pragmatic. "How
do I go to the museum?" This is
a pragmatic question, instrumental. We're using language.
We're using it to serve us. But
when you say, "Diamond
Dogs," this is a positioned
scene of a few words that are
never together, and there,
something interesting, something beautiful, something that
helps us to live, can appear
not just something that lets us
pay, or live, but rather, something that puts us on another
plane of language, the imaginative of language.
I'm not a fan of contemporary poetry that reproduces
what people say on the street.
Why reproduce what people
say on the street? What people
say on the street is not poetry,
it's not interesting. It seems
more interesting to me to say
"Diamond dogs" and "North of
the name," than that.
MP: have a question about
one of your poems, "Opens and
Closes." "Abres unfilo de navajajpara que gotee la transparencia." ("You open the razor
blade/to let the transparency
trickle out.") When I read this,
it seemed like an energy was
spilling into the page, like something was opening in that
moment. Is this what you mean

by energy? "You close the somnambulant pail of night/and a
river of shadows overflows."
Where do these metaphors and
images come from?
DH: From everywhere.
These two lines come, in some
form, although the reader doesn't need to know, but I'll share
with you where they come
from. This is a special key,
which I'll share with you.
There is a scene, the first scene
of a great surrealist film called
"Un Chien Andalou" by Luis
Bunuel.
MP: Yes, I've seen it.
DH: In the first scene, a man
with a razor blade appears, and
you see in the sky a cloud that
passes in front of the moon.
Then he opens the razor and
opens the eye of a woman, and
slices open the eye of the
woman.
That's the image. What
comes out of the eye of the
woman is crystalline, a crystalline, transparent substance.
And what you suppose that
these are the visions of the
film. This is, as the musicians
say, a variation on this theme,
this surrealist Bunuelesque
theme. It's a terrible scene, it's
haunting
This is a variation
on that theme, of the open eye.
But this is a poem oflove.
You open, you open me, and
what comes out of me is pure
transparency. You bring me

clarity.
MP: Some people have called
your work postmodern, but
what do you think of this name,

this classification?
DH: I don't think much of it.
What interests me is poetry,
postmodern, modern, premodern, classic, but fundamentally,
poetry and not labels. I don't
distinguish between modern
poems and ancient poems...
The era of the poem doesn't
bother me. Poetry is like a
newspaper.
newspaper
A
records the news of today. A
poem records the news of forever.
MP: So, you are also a journalist.
DH: Yes, I'm also a journalist, but I've suspended my
work as a journalist to become
a professor. I do very little
journalism now but I did it for
almost thirty years. It's a very
honorable and necessary activity, for the health of the community. So you must deal with
the truth very carefully. I
wrote opinions columns, and
not news. I wrote from my
house, commenting on political
acts, contributing so that people better understood what was
going on. I was more of a political commentator than a
...

reporter.

MP: So what do you think
now of Felipe Calderon?
DH: I'm not supportive of
his government. My political
position is very different than
that of Mexico. I'm also very
disillusioned with the Left,
which I supported for many

So I'm feeling very
isolated, and I'm waiting for
the moment to intervene... but
my work right now is in education. It's almost a dogma for
me. I don't think there is any
human or divine power that
can dissuade me from that. I'm
absolutely convinced that education is the solution to many
things.
For me, that is more
important than writing poetry,
to teach classes for writing
poetry and teach students to
take from literature as much as
they can. It's wonderful to read
a complete wonder.
MP: Out of music, poetry
and literature, which is the
years.

...

..,

...

most important to you?

DH: It's music. For me,
music is the maximal art.
Music is for me the maximal
art. Everything else, all the
other arts, are measured by
their proximity to music.
Poetry is a lot like music. I
would have liked to be a musician, but I didn't have the
power or concentration. But I
listen to music, I make a little
music, and it is a form like the
background of my life. It's my
atmosphere, to listen to music,
more than reading poetry. And
everything else is important
and interesting, it's a source of
stimulus, reasons to live, to
reflect; the cinema, the theater,
dance and painting. There is
nothing
mesquino,
cheap,
tight-fisted. Nothing is tightfisted. Everything can give is
something if we are disposed to
it. Music more than anything.
And, animals. I think these are
two activities which make life
worthwhile: listen to music
and live with animals. They
make us ask questions that are
not easy to answer. What is
going on in this world.

MP:
poems

/

haven't read many

of yours about either.

DH: No, I haven't written
about them, not very much.
But I will.
MP: What were you doing
when you were 20 years old?
DH: My life was very different. I had a daughter. I was a
young man, but I was living an
older life. My daughter was a
year old when I was 20 years
old, and she was born when I
was 19. So, it was too bad that I
couldn't live the life of a student. The life of a student is
great.
MP: And the life of a poet?
DH: One thing is true. As a
poet, you don't get rich. This is
the path that I chose. But I
know people, I travel, and the
most important is that I do
what I want. To do what one
wants, and to be rich, is too
much. But I am very content,
and I know Professor Aurora,
and all of you, and with my
translator, with Marc, I said,
How wonderful, that we travel.

Embracing the mammalian side of our sexuality

swarthmorephoenix.com

Upon

reading

The

Phoenix for the first time
this past fall semester, I
realized that a dialogue
great
of
intellectual
importance was blatantly
absent: boobs! Hey, why
not? Not only does public
sex-talk in this high
stress environment provide much-needed laughter at your narrator's
Amber Wantman
expense, but it also creSex and the Bubble
ates an open forum about
sexual experience. Take
l^mm^mmmm^mmmmm
it from the Blood Hound
Gang: we ain't nothin' but mammals!

I

"Hieroglyphics? Let me be Pacific I wanna be
down in your South Seas,/ But I got this
notion that the motion of your ocean means
'Small Craft Advisory' / So if I capsize on
your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship / Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee
with an automatic drip / So show me yours
I'll show you mine / "Tool Time," you'll

the Discovery Channel / (Do it again now)

/

You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
/ So let's do it like they do on the Discovery
Channel / (Getting' horny now)"

So, if we are open about our status as mammals,
then it is my hope that we can become more open sexually. While I'd like to say that my only goal in writing lewd and inappropriate sex columns is to make
you giggle, educate you, or perhaps just get you off, I
do have an ulterior motive; I'd love to see a world
that is comfortable with its sexuality.
Because I do not envision comfort in one's sexuality in terms of nudist colonies or exposed sagging
appendages, I think it's important to say that sexual
comfort has a flexible definition. Personally, I'd like
to see sex become a subject freely discussed at meals
(reducing all the Swat Swiveling), or in the bathroom
for that matter, in class, over homework wherever!
It's my opinion that sex is not sinful, but a natural
animal (and of course human) inclination. Sex is not
dirty, but beautiful. Sex is not painful, but pleasurable. Sex is not inappropriate, but normal. Sex is not
wrong, but so, so, so right.
On soap operas, you will often hear actors playing
the part of "Muscular Doctor" refer to sex as "lovemaking." In my more cynical days I would have told
you not to be fooled by this scheme of corporate
America. (They are trying to sell you Valentine's Day
cards! Love is a scam!) But if you ever have sex when
...

you are in love then you will find out that there's a
reason "hacer el amor" translates into Spanish literally. When you are capable of feverishly staring into
someone's eyes while being totally connected with
that person, surrounding him, and having him surround you, never wanting to let go, and knowing that
the feeling is 110 percent reciprocated, then you will
know that sex can never be wrong, and then you will
be certain that you are comfortable with your own
sexuality.

So, as this is my last column for the semester (and
who knows how long), I'd like to leave you with a few
parting words of wisdom: stay safe; have lots of sex.
And if son, you got no game, by God, masturbate.
Food and orgasm tie for the single largest secretion of
dopamine that the body will naturally release at one
time. When you're having a stressful day, and you're
sick of Sharpies, and you don't have a significant
other, you have a hand, don't you? As far as hookups
even when birth
go, condoms are indispensable
control is in the mix. Need I say more? (I'll leave that
to your friendly sexual health counselors).
And so I release you, fecund little Grasshopper. Go
forth! Live! Prosper! But try not to contract a disease
or procreate just yet!
Appreciate your able body for all that it can do.
You are healthy and wise, so stay that way, because
now you are at once on your own.

Exploring the wide (and varied) world of fashion
One
hundred
and twenty
days from
now I will
be getting
on a plane
for
a

semester

abroad
Ming Cai

in

Copenhagen,

Denmark.
Even with
one final
week
of
classes and finals to get through, I
can't help but constantly think about
the distant future. As petty as it
sounds, packing for four months living in Europe seems almost as stressful as finishing some of my final
papers. I may be exaggerating here,
but the concerns are real
when one
is abroad, should one make an effort to
blend in with the natives, or stick to
one's own sartorial milieu?
The distinctions that dress can
draw between different societies,
countries and peoples are certainly a
counter to those who naysay the
importance of fashion. Nothing is
more visible than such visual signifiers. When browsing through street
fashion blogs like Face Hunter and
The Sartorialist that travel around the
world, it's surprising how easy it is to
predict what cities the pictures come
from.
Perhaps unintentionally, there are
wholly noticeable differences between
those hailing from London, Paris, New
York City and Los Angeles. Perhaps
it's due to something as simple as differences in the weather, but maybe
there is something at the core of every
city that causes such differences. It's a
little disconcerting to think that simThe Swatorialist

THE PHOENIX

ply by moving to a different city, one
can change into an unrecognizable
person due to changes in dress.
I was struck especially by a couple
of posts that The Sarto-rialist made a
while ago about women who had
moved to the Big Apple. Within a year,
their styles had completely changed so
that they looked distinctively like
New Yorkers. When one was interviewed about how her style had
changed so much, her explanation was
that it was a combination of greater

accessibility to more sophisticated
and fashion-forward clothing and
greater exposure to "fashionable" people and various styles. There was also
inspiration drawn from the city itself.
In a way, the self-perpetuating nature
of fashion seems to be one way in
which the city itself is alive, and even
so it is always changing.
In Copenhagen, there is apparently
an unwritten rule that women who
dress like secretaries, and who actually aren't secretaries, are unavailable
and in serious relationships. Even
though there is no handbook for style,
it's interesting how the way we dress
gets coded into everyday societal
meaning. On a utilitarian level, a pair
of pants is a pair of pants. But given
context, pants became an empowering
emblem of the feminist movement, a
visible manifestation of the changes
taking place in society.
This and countless other examples
throughout history
the banning of
armbands during the Vietnam War,
the rising hemlines of dresses during
the roaring '2os, the übiquitous flannel of the grunge era
show that it is
impossible to visualize a society without taking note of fashion. It's impossible to get dressed in the morning, no
matter how some may try, and not
have our choices say something about
who we are. Clothing may not be

year (right).

definitive, but it's one more way to

judge and be judged. So though it's a
little scary to thin , we may need the
fashion industry a whole lot more

than it needs us.
But rather than this being a pessimistic view, I still believe that this
means style, even if influenced by the
society around us, is one of the most
salient forms of expression we have.
As I sit here writing my last column of

April 23, 2009

the year, I can't help but ponder how

my sense of style has changed to
reflect the changes in my life. Whether

they have been ups or downs, I've still
enjoyed writing and blogging about
these stages. So adieu (or should I say
farvel?) for now, and perhaps I will be

back in future times, home from
abroad with some new perspective.

with mental
illness. As it

wish to avoid.
I left McLean Hospital in November of
2007. Because of arbitrary divisions
between academic semesters I soon realized I had earned an unexpected vacation.
I was now twice-removed from reality,
exiled from the ivory womb that had
incubated my madness. Directionless, I
played videogames and baked cookies
with my mother, finished my night classes, took a job at a local record store in
hopes of preserving some scrap of my
indie cred. (My little sister, bless her, told
me that living in a mental asylum was
"pretty indie rock." Let my audience, infinitely hipster-er than myself, be the final
judge. However I acknowledge that several times at McLean I caught myself wondering if the hospital sold t-shirts that I
might purchase and wear faux-ironically,
perhaps underneath a fitted blazer of
some kind.)
Somehow I survived those long insufferable weeks of delicious food and abundant leisure. But I constantly reminded
myself that soon enough I would return to
the academic dungeon that I called home,
and January became like an evil
Christmas to me; I had a small plastic
case I used to sort out my daily phalanx of
pills, and each day I opened it like some
unholy advent calendar, swallowing the
bitter narcotic chocolate and counting the
days until judgment, trial without jury or
sanity clause, was delivered.
My eventual return was uneventful
and uncommented on. I parroted my
grotesque alibi and found it accepted
without question. I did a play and took
several pass-fail courses. My education
continued. Yet my extensive study at a
more selective, arguably more rigorous
institution (F
r's Skull Community
College) had irreversibly transformed my
perspective. Everything seemed smaller
here. The laborious academic discourse I
had once accepted without question had
become pedantic and trivial. My friends
would complain about double-credit laboratory seminar take-home theses, and I
would stare, mute and blinking, uncomprehending of a language I had once spoken fluently.
Part of this is that I was simply no
longer equipped to engage in the ecstatic
ritual flagellation pursued by my fellow
monastics. My symptoms, after all, are
exacerbated by stress. When I am asked
to post to a class discussion board, I wince
and ruminate; an hour spent studying
instead of sleeping is an hour in the company of screaming, tormented ghosts.
Sometimes I struggled with my medication, although it is difficult to articulate
this sensation, because it is a feeling
defined as much by absence as presence.
It is not entirely unlike vertigo, a strangely empty sensation. It is the nauseous
recognition of empty places in one's

16

mind. It is like the acute awareness of the
absence of a headache, just slightly
uncomfortable although not painful, like
chewing a too-large piece of bubblegum
that has lost its color and flavor. Ghost
circles, psychic white noise. The school
has made minor concessions to my condition, I have been granted late homework
passes ad infinitum, but these do not
entirely compensate for the idiosyncrasies of the disorder. I imagine that our
institution's faculty does not regularly
patronize this dodgy periodical but a plea,
if any of you are reading: restraint, compassion. Every time I am pushed beyond
my abilities I fucking suffer a little. And I
am not alone in this.
There have also been odd moments of
discontinuity since I've returned, resonances that others miss, inside jokes that
would confound anyone sane. There have
been times when I have felt an overwhelming urge to speak up, to scream
until hoarse and raw-throated, yet in

Since childhood I have been reassured
that we are all human, that everyone is
the same on the inside. I wonder, where
does that leave people like me, who are
demonstrably not the same on the inside?
We are misunderstood mutants like the XMen, only not the cool popular X-Men;
like Marrow, whose face was disfigured
by bony protrusions, or like Maggot,
whose digestive system was replaced by a
pair of intelligent armored slugs. I am
homo obsessus: "besieged man." My
brain, my mind, my soul
whatever terrestrial or transcendental organ you
choose to assign responsibility for the
functionality of my person

to obtain a replacement. Indeed, much of

I may instead offer some advice, as a graduating senior.
You are brilliant. You have gifts that
may be used to better, not only your own

circumstances, but the standard of
human life on this planet. And you have
been given four years to crystallize your
understanding of these gifts, and to

achieve the wisdom and maturity needed
to use them responsibly. But we waste
these years on petty self-flagellation. We
lionize personal suffering in service of
abstract goals, we willfully endure
unbearable trauma to achieve things that

do not matter, and we use these circumstances to rationalize our failures. We
sequester ourselves at basement desks
and play joyless games while we claim to
work. We hide behind the salad bar to
avoid meeting the eyes of people we have
fucked. We choose to overexert ourselves
and deliberately neglect our actual problems, and we use the same trite excuses,
again and again, to validate our behavior.
"Tired." "Busy." "Awkward."
People talk about this school as existing within a bubble, like it was some
other planet. It baffles me that on a campus filled with chemists and biologists
such rumors persist. Is the atmosphere
not oxygen here? Are these plants so exotic as to not produce chlorophyll?
Welcome, my friends, to planet Earth.
Enjoy the air, the trees. It's almost summer now. Perhaps now would be a good
time to go outside and catch up on some

reading. But it is my unhappy duty to
remind you that it is impossible to save
the world if you cannot bring yourself to
live on it. Each of us needs to stop making
excuses, to lay down those burdens that
we cannot bear, to confront our personal
problems instead of orchestrating new
ones. We must be kind to ourselves. To do
anything else is selfish, socially irresponsible. It is cowardly and childish. The
undiagnosed life is not worth living. It's

periodic published diatribes, composed
by undergraduate fuckwits manic on
Nietzsche and caffeine and sleep-deprivation, that claim that mental illness does
not exist; that all I must do is believe, and
the Power of my Will shall elevate me to
glorious rationality. I am told that medicine is unnecessary because unnecessary
suffering is the medicine, and I am told
that it is my fault that I am tortured
because I simply do not want enough to
be healthy. Tell me, my sane brothers and
sisters: have you ever described yourself
as "depressed" because of a B on an

executive for an explanation of his organization's incompetence.
On a campus cross-sectioned by clashing minority identities, those afflicted by
mental illness are infuriatingly the first
to be silenced. We are alike but alone. We
have no history of oppression or triumph
to draw strength from, no artists or advocates to defend us; no academic department dedicated to cataloguing our
achievements, although our behavior is
carefully and clinically examined, like
that of dogs or rats. We are united, not by
distinction, but by a burden that any of us
would gleefully shed. We chuckle and
cringe and self-deprecate in the presence
of colossal, indefensible ignorance. We
suffer alone, and pointlessly, and in
silence. Our power is not that which
makes us different, but the strength we
muster to overcome these differences and
assimilate, to conform, to live unremarkable lives while beset by exquisite personal torture. Every day, survived under
such conditions, is an endeavor and an
achievement. Every B is a victory.
Forgive my ranting here. Again,
because my experiences defy narrative
convention I hesitate, here, to try to apply
a final moral context to my writing. But if

So this is it, this is the end of the
proverbial session, and I ain't gonna be
taking any more questions. I believe my
attorney will second that notion. It's been
over a year since I returned to
Swarthmore. I wrote and read; I botched
exams. I finally got into the fiction workshop. I completed my thesis while sleeping ten hours a day due to a slightly overgenerous prescription of medication, and
I launched into an irrational tirade
against The USA Network program
"Monk" at a bewildered friend at Pub
Night. I've done silly, embarrassing, reprehensible things, and I will probably do
several more of them between the submission and publication of this column. I
have been allowed to be a college student,
a little, for a bit. I wish that I'd had more
time to enjoy it.
Writing this has been a long, ugly, difficult process, as my past four years have
been long, ugly and difficult years. I've
made mistakes and I've contradicted
myself and I've probably angered people
that it was inadvisable to anger. But I do
not regret writing or publishing this. The
narrative does not stop, things accelerate,
a few weeks and I will be swept away
from this place for the last time and
everything will change again. But for
now, at least, a moment of quiet. It is
done, almost. The rest is ... well, I'm sure
you know the rest.

Scrutinizing the science supporting Swoggles
BY MAKI SOMOSOT

msomosol@swarthmore.edu

This being Swarthmore, there
seems to be a myriad of bizarre
psychological phenomena on our
warranting further
campus
analysis
the behavioral manifestation of "swakwardness" and
the self-defensive physical act of
the "Swat swivel," for example. If
the Urban Dictionary entry for
"Swoggles" (or the fact that there
is an Urban Dictionary entry for
"Swoggles" in the first place) is
indication, "Swoggles"
any
should rank chief among them.
"Swoggles" is elegantly defined
by that aforementioned source as
such: "Similar to beer goggles, it
is the effect of being around the
atrociously

ugly

people

at

Swarthmore College. All of a sudden mediocre to ugly people
begin to look fuckable."
Like the unspoken common
knowledge that no one here can
ever feasibly finish all of their
assigned readings, the oft-accepted perception that everyone here
is probably not as pretty as they
could potentially be is treated
like the student body's dirty
secret, hence the "swoggles" phenomenon. A portmanteau of
"Swattie" and "goggles," "swoggles" refers obliquely to the
wearing of rose-colored glasses
that obscure one's objective
vision about future romantic
prospects here at Swarthmore.
But is there any factual basis
behind this impression that we
Swatties have of ourselves? Are
we really a less attractive bunch
than the population outside the
bubble? And have we really been
lowering our standards?
The theory of habituation
would arguably proffer the closest psychological explanation of
"swoggles." Still, according to
Dorwin Cartwright, Professor of
Social Theory and Social Action,
and Professor of Psychology
Barry Schwartz, habituation theory in fact predicts the opposite.
"Imagine that there is a hierarchy of attractiveness when you
first arrive on campus, so you of
course gravitate towards the people you are most attracted to,"
Schwartz said. "But then you
habituate towards most people
and their level of attractiveness
goes down." By contrast, looking through "swoggles" is commonly thought to cause therelphysical
ative
attractiveness of
classmates
to
increase
with

Swarthmore students' gradual
habituation to one another. This
begs the question as to whether
"swoggles" is truly a legitimate
psychological phenomenon and
why this is ultimately so. After

all, the tacit rumor that the
Swarthmore student population
is notorious for its supposedly
mediocre-to-nonexistent looks
persists for a reason.
"Of course, swoggles are
real," Randall Johnston 'O9 said.
"It's not that we're a particularly
unattractive bunch. We just
don't care to learn or take the
time to take care of ourselves.
And, there are only about 1,500 of
us, which leads to a pretty small
pool of reasonable possibilities."
The "mere exposure effect" in
social psychology probably better explains this paradox of
romantic attraction between
Swatties. "In a small society like
Swarthmore, initial attraction
often happens because of natural
proximity," Professor of Social
Psychology Etsuko HoshinoBrowne said. "Initially, you may
not be attracted to that person,
but once you get to know that
person, familiarity increases this
kind of liking." Hoshino-Browne
also said the relevance of the
"insulated" nature of the
Swarthmore student body could
also play a role in a swoggles
effect: "Students don't get to
interact with people outside of
Swarthmore, so in a way it's a
kind of pool." Likewise, because
of the intense academic rigor
characterizes
the
that
Swarthmore lifestyle, it is significantly less likely that students
will spend precious time maintaining and being preoccupied
over superficial physical appearance. As a result, the standard
norm of physical attractiveness
would naturally go down.
major Karen
Psychology
Guan 'lO states that it would be
"easy" to conduct an empirical
experiment, which would prove
or disprove the swoggles effect.
"Social psychologists have done
a number of studies examining
what features are valued as
attractive in the west, like big
eyes and prominent cheekbones." Guan added. "An experimenter could compare strangers'
ratings of attractiveness for
photos of randomly selected
Swatties versus those of
other
colIf
leges.
&
Swatties
were
found to

be less attractive, then 'swoggles'
might come into play."
In a party atmosphere, especially, attractiveness standards
may decline as a part of 'alcohol
myopia'
when people under
the influence "become nearsighted in terms of environment and
focus on what they want,"
according to Hoshino-Browne.
To test this theory yourself, why
not undergo a thorough visual
reassessment of all your Paces
party regulars, experienced veterans, fresh-faced newbies,
and/or those sometime desperados who stand around awkwardly drinking from red cups? (Or if
you don't party or self-inebriate
often, then why not apply this
mental exercise to the same old
faces that you see everyday in
your classes?) The key is to
observe whether or not these
people suddenly begin to present
themselves more and more as doable, romantic possibilities.
"You could imagine that students come to Swarthmore with
a standard of comparison that
includes the highly attractive
people from their previous environments and also celebrity
types. As they spend time at
Swat, the standard of comparison becomes other Swarthmore
students," Schwartz said. "So
someone who may be ordinary
in comparison to the universe of
other people becomes extraordinary in comparison to the universe of Swarthmore students."
But just how much of the
"swoggles" phenomenon is due to

ture. "I don't think Swatties are
ugly; they're just unkempt and
sometimes a little dirty. But
Swoggles are necessary because
otherwise you won't find anyone
for a relationship here," said a
taken first-year who preferred to

environmental influence, or just
to the plain sink-or-swim mentality that in order to get some, you
have to lose some? It seems possible that "swoggles" is not so
much an effect of habituation as
it is a romantic necessity to survive in the general Swarthmore
pool. "[Wearing] Swoggles are an
integral part of finding happiness in the Swarthmore dating
scene," Chris Wickham 'l2 said,
who had once berated one of his
friends that "[her] standards just
weren't low enough," while she
was "griping" about the lack of
eligible straight boys on campus.
Johnston, speaking from her
perspective as a seasoned senior,
equates the Swarthmore dating
pool to a candy store. "[As a firstyear] back when the candy store
just looked shiny... I couldn't see
all the dirt and grime for all the
different flavors." She added. "As
seniors, we see the grime
we
either: a) Choose to ignore it by
determinedly shoving on our
swoggles; b) Run away screaming; or c) Are still sitting outside
chewing on our licorice. It's kind
of like a choose-your-own-adventure story." Maybe the habituation theory only really starts to
impose itself as a tragic and
depressing reality with time and
the accumulated passage ofinnumerable Paces parties, pseudorelationships and actually legitimate romantic conquests (failed
or otherwise).
Some students are brutally
honest about the function of
"swoggles" in Swarthmore cul-

remain anonymous. "And the
ones whom you will find will
probably be sleeping around."
Here at Swarthmore, the distant
romantic future just sounds like
a bleak survival-of-the-fittest
game, with swoggles as basic
artillery at everyone's disposal.
Then again, it is fair to

assume that habituation doesn't
necessarily bring about apathy
or enslavement to the generic
Paces party routine, but rather
the hard-earned, hard-worn truism that beauty is probably just
skin-deep. "It is very rare that
people stick to physical attractiveness standards, because of
individual characteristics like
personality," Hoshino-Browne
assured. "There is a matching
hypothesis in intimate attraction
literature, which shows that people increasingly get attracted to
people who are similar to themselves, in terms of inteUigence
and ideas." With any luck, lessons that come with age and
maturity will eventually pay off
our romantic debt to swoggles.
But for the interim period, we
will agree to sell our souls and
consign our jaded scraps of
romantic faith to the incoming
freshmen
class.
Fresh.
Untainted. Pretty? That remains
to be seen.

A shy music scene surfaces
in a non-Swarthmorean way
BY BEN MAZER
bmazerl@swarthmore.edu

■■fflfffji

A few weeks back, on a Friday
night, WSRN put on a show in PPR

from Olde Club came as a final recognition of the new musical scene emerging both
nationally and at Swarthmore. This movement
doesn't have any particular name associated with
it, but, in short, the music we heard was 10-fi,
fuzzy, experimental rock n' roll. We heard loops,
pop hooks, inaudible vocals, liberal use of distortion and accidental use of feedback. We heard an
evening of tribute to the cassette tape; one of the
musicians even sold her music on the forgotten
medium, to the accolades of the other performers.
(She upstaged most artists of this genre, who use
the trendier vinyl record to achieve 10-fi authenticity.)

This music is certainly not noise, somehow
seems more than garage rock and refreshingly has
no nihilistic agenda attached. The genre is represented by U.S. Girls (who played in PPR last semester), Buckets of Bile and Drawlings (who played
this time), and their better-known contemporaries
Jay Reatard, Times New Viking, Psychedelic
Horseshit, Wavves and Blank Dogs. There are
many others, and WSRN's staff has been dutifully
collecting them on the playlist.
This collection ofmusic has grown considerably
over only a couple of years. The movement is characterized by a willfully naive pleasure in rock
music. We aren't seeing any particular political or
artistic stand, except that music is fun to play.
There isn't, however, any nostalgia or posing along
the lines of a Ramones or White Stripes, just experimentation. There were no leather jackets and sunglasses, but plenty of worn-out corduroy and old tshirts.
These artists would enjoy playing regardless of
how many people were listening, and they don't
expect much widespread attention. When I asked
him about the show, Pat Kolodgy of Handglops
said, "Playing in PPR basement is fun."
PPR basement is a great space for the new musical scene at Swarthmore. It captures the "dorm
room" aesthetic of the music, but some modifications had to be made. If you were at the show, you
would have noticed a pillow hung behind the
artists. It was for their protection. Pat told me that
"you gotta watch out for that pipe sticking straight
outta the wall. I busted my head on that thing pretty hard."
Friday's PPR show represented this equanimity
well. Swarthmore's Bromancer (Selmaan Chettih
'lO and Louis Jargow 10) and Handglops (Pat
Kolodgy 'O9 and Zach Weinstein '11) performed to a

op-art

by

small group of friends and WSRN DJs, but with
sincerity and talent. Bromancer ran through a
three-song set with precision, smiled and then
joined the audience. Handglops played with their
usual timid ferocity and afterward gave away their
album for free.
Swarthmore's music scene has for a long time
been dominated by bands whose stage antics seek
mainly crowd approval. Many of these bands are
technically accomplished, but ephemeral. We may
not remember our PPR bands much longer, but
their experimental instincts must be given some
credit.
WSRN has been decaying in the same way as
Olde Club. The station is left trashed, the DJs don't
properly learn the equipment or plan a playlist,
and students just don't listen. This isn't failure, it's
just part of an apathy common to Swarthmore,
where projects that require private dedication cannot survive. At Swarthmore, we all want to start
our own organization, not continue someone else's;
we over-think and over-plan and cannot devote too
much time to "meaningless" endeavors. We have a
phobia of "wasted time." That's why we achieve so
much.
But in this environment, it's unsurprising that
musical scenes have trouble thriving. I mean, after
all, thinking you're doing something groundbreaking with delay pedals and a snare drum is
egotistical. And it's certainly not "recognizing
your own privilege."
But it is fun. It's fun to practice in your room for
hours and to put on ad hoc shows for your friends;
it's fun to project the Talking Heads and throw a
dance party (which also happened in PPR recently); it's fun to bullshit about actual bullshit,
instead of politics or philosophy. Those of us in
PPR that weekend heard both creativity and satisfaction from the artists, and it made me happy to
see them happy.
There's certainly some showmanship and affectation in this 10-fi music that we could criticize,
but after listening to and talking with the musicians who played in PPR, I had no desire to. This
musical scene will withstand a Swarthmorean
intellectual assault simply because it's arisen in
such a non-Swarthmorean way: it's not multi-cultural, it's just "rock;" it's not intellectually humble, and it hasn't been thought through.
But this scene has security. It really isn't there
to impress anyone or fulfill some abstract existential desire (hint: this desire is the main force filling
up Olde Club and Paces weekly). Some people in
the basement danced, and some didn't, some stayed
and some left early, and no one cared about what
they "should" have been doing. Basically, the
music we heard in PPR was not neurotic, and I just
thought that was pretty neat.

letters to
the editor

Centering needs of
marginalized groups
To the Editor:
We are writing on behalf of the White Women
Confronting Racism group in response to the comments
written in reaction to the None of the Above campaign
posted on the Daily Gazette. A number of these comthey are dismissive of the
ments are oppressive
inequities and racism that members of Swarthmore's
community experience. In addition, the tone of the postings exposes a general ignorance about the historical
and structural context of oppression and marginalization.
At Swarthmore, there seems to be a fantasy that we
exist as one unified community, but this belief fails to
acknowledge how people with privileged identities often
define our community in ways that marginalize and
silence other students and mask racism. The antagonistic reaction to the elections process disrupts this fantasy
by revealing wider campus antagonism towards IC/BCC
communities. Throughout this election season we have
seen how IC/BCC communities have been tokenized as a
political tool; it is not the role or obligation of marginalized communities to educate the campus at large about
their experiences. There needs to be an ongoing commitment to centering the needs of marginalized communities throughout the entire year, not just during elections.
We recognize that we are white women speaking from
a position of privilege and we speak from our own experiences and understanding of the situation. We are interested in continuing this conversation, and we would like
to help organize an open forum after the elections to discuss the issues that were brought up during this campaign process. We welcome any comments, concerns or
questions regarding the views that we have put forward.

On behalf of White Women Confronting Racism

A response to NOTA
To the Editor:
I believe I speak for quite a few when I say that the
None of the Above campaign is a misappropriation of the
wonderful system of democratic elections that we take
for granted.
Its proponents argue that the lack of good candidates
should encourage a voting for none, delaying, derailing
and potentially backfiring on the good intentions of
encouraging the choice for right leadership.
There is a difference between None of the Above as a
declaration that specific gender/race/ethnic/sexual orientation labels do not adequately express our own identities, and None of the Above as a suggestion that none of
the candidates are worthy of their post. I am a NOTA of
the former, but not of the latter.
Swarthmore is a place known for people doing the
things they find to be right, for standing up for causes
even with the challenges that face them. It is disappointing to know that among us are individuals who have
such cowardice as to stand anonymous and to suggest
that all of the candidates do not understand the responsibilities of their positions, do not understand the community they intend to serve, and therefore, are not qualified to serve the community. Those who adhere by
NOTA envisage change that they feel strongly enough
about but do not wish to be involved with. They criticize
those who take the extra step to put forth their platforms
and refuse to subject themselves to the same. NOTA may
be a joke not to-be taken seriously, but what it stands for
is apathy and criticism without any real, concrete alternative.
If we desire an alternative, my friends, then we
should be the ones who promote that change.

Calling for continuation of StuCo discussion
The Student Council elections did not end as dramatically as they could have. Despite the legion of
votes amassed by the "None of the Above" movement,
every position ended up being filled, and ultimately, a
second set of elections will not be held.
Congratulations are due to all of the candidates.
Still, we hope that the newly elected council will not
dismiss the issues raised by the NOTA campaign.
Even though "None of the Above" failed to achieve a
plurality in any one category, only 16 votes separated
newly elected StuCo President Rachel Bell from the
"None of the Above" option in what was the closest
call of the elections. Rounding up 281 votes for
Campus Life Representative, 300 for Financial Policy
Representative, 245 for Student Groups Advisor, 216
for Educational Policy Representative and 276 for
President, the NOTA campaign has brought up significant questions surrounding the role students expect
StuCo to play on campus. We hope that the newly
elected Council and student body will continue to discuss these issues and work together to address them
immediately.
The first, and perhaps most obvious, problem is
that so few candidates ran for StuCo positions. Only
two students ran for president, and every other posi-

tion remained uncontested.
So, the question stands: why did so few students
enter the election? Students, after all, were bombarded with e-mails and announcements encouraging
them to consider running for office. Everyone knew
when the elections were being held.
No doubt, there were many reasons that few students decided to run. Because StuCo members work
for no pay, less privileged students may not always be
in a financial position to run. Also, students who
identify as members of marginalized groups may not
always feel that StuCo positions are entirely viable for
them.

StuCo as a whole, more accessible to the student body.
These included a proposed "agenda-setting forum" at
the beginning ofeach semester, regular meetings with
student leaders, polling of students, the distribution
of her contact information, and, even more excitingly,
an "Ask the StuCo President Column in The Phoenix
and Daily Gazette." If Bell and StuCo can deliver on
these promises, then students will have a better idea
of the extent of StuCo's influence and will have a better basis for deciding whether or not structural
changes to the Council are necessary, and if they are,
what those changes ought to look like.
In the end, there is nothing wrong with the controversy that surrounded the elections and the questions
that the NOTA campaign raised.
The contentious election may well point to a
greater political divide in the Swarthmore community between those who approve of the StuCo's current
role and those who want a more activist StuCo that
more readily challenges the administration's decisions.
Either way, a real and serious attempt at dialogue
between the incoming and outgoing StuCo and the
student body is necessary so that everyone can better
understand the powers and obligations of the StuCo,
and how the Council can work to better serve the
interests of the Swarthmore student body.
It is very important that a much stronger connection is established between StuCo and the student

The fact that so few students ran is a clear indication that, despite the regular e-mails and invitations
to sit in on Council meetings, there remains a real disconnect between StuCo and the student body it governs.
Another likely reason that so few candidates ran
the reason that this editorial will focus on
is that
some students didn't think that any of the StuCo positions (with the possible exception of the Presidency)
had any real relevancy.
The primary reason for this is that few people are
certain about what powers StuCo actually possesses.
Most of us know the basics. We know that StuCo
dispenses funding for student groups and initiatives,
and that it has some sway with the administration.
What we don't know is whether it has the power to
place students on the Financial Aid Planning
Committee, whether it has the capacity to alter student recruitment strategies to better target lowincome student groups, or whether it is in a position
to dictate how grant money in Chester is spent. These
were three of the informal proposals suggested by
Daniel Symonds, one of the few vocal advocates of
NOTA. Is it in the Student Council's capacity to
achieve these things? What leverage, if any, does
StuCo hold over the administration? These are the
questions that the student body needs answered.
Because we cannot judge the efficacy of past members
of StuCo, we cannot hope to judge the agendas of current members, unless we know what actual power
StuCo has.
This is why we are so enthusiastic about efforts by
the current StuCo, and the StuCo that will succeed
them next semester, to communicate with students
and come up with goals and suggestions for the
future. The latest iteration of incoming president
Rachel Bell's campaign poster and platform included
a number of ways she hoped to make herself, and

body.

This connection can only be established through
greater dialogue: more students should show up at
StuCo meetings and StuCo members should continue
to find new and more effective ways to communicate
with the student body. Once this connection is established, and students have a clearer idea of the capabilities of the StuCo, then, perhaps, we will see a few
more names on the ballot sheet.

The first is that honeymoons do not
last forever. The novelty of the Obama
presidency, the primacy and pomp of
first foreign visits and the sheer exultation of not having Bush in office have
all buoyed approval ratings at artificially high levels. The inevitable complications
minor scandals, foreign
unrest, the limited efficacy of bailouts
will most likely drag Obama's popularity down to
a point where
Republicans will at least feel comfortable enough to carry out significant

offensives.
Second, the present focus on the
economy forces Republicans to traverse
unfriendly terrain. People don't particularly trust them to handle recessions,
and Obama did a good job of linking
Reaganomics-style deregulation to our
current problems. But either way is up
for Republicans: if things don't begin to
improve over the course of the year,
their critiques of Democratic solutions
will gain legitimacy, and if Obama prevails on the economy, they will still get
to shift the discussion to other topics
that are politically more favorable to
them.
If either of these conditions changes,
Republicans will find more of a voice
and a more receptive national audience. Then we will see whether Obama
reacts more strongly to the opposition
or if he in fact plans to govern from a
centrist-liberal position throughout his
first term.

The evidence in the
cases appears identical,
but only one of the two
defendants is guilty.

Throwing aside all
regulaconstitutional
tions, the judge decides
that they must both be
found either guilty or
innocent.
Thus, one of two things
will happen: an innocent
person will go to jail, or a
person will be let off
guilty of committing a
serious crime.
The question is this:
which one concerns you
more?
What if the crime
were more serious
a
violent act, a sexual
offense, a murder?
Of course, almost any
of us will be concerned
with both sides of the
issue
the fairness and
protection of freedom
with the innocent one, the
justice and security of
society with the guilty
one.
Here's another quespeople's

responses to this scenario
correspond with their
political ideology?
(A disclaimer: I am not
a sociologist, psychologist, or research statistician. My only empirical

evidence on this comes
from informal questioning of a very small number of acquaintances,
members of both parties.
This is clearly more of a
thought experiment than
any sort of empirical
study. If anybody knows
of any studies or analyses
that are relevant to this,
I'd be very interested to
hear them; I can be contacted at jgottscl@swarthmore.edu.)

How about foreign policy? Look at the War in
Iraq:
conservatives
argued
that Saddam
Hussein posed a threat
and needed to be defeated,
liberals argued that the

moral and actual costs of
an unnecessary war outweighed the benefits.
True, both sides had different perspectives on
whether or not Saddam
posed a threat, but most
of the public had access to
the same information, so
objectively the threat
should have looked similar to all. Whether people
perceived the threat as

The

was impressive, but not

conclusive. Let's say,
based on the holes in the
evidence and the important questions remaining
to be asked, that there

was a one-in-four chance
that the evidence was
accurate.

It's easy to see that, to
some people, a one-in-four
chance that a threat may
exist in the first place
could be seen as insufficient to justify war when
other options may still
have been available. It's
also easy to imagine that
other people, with the
specter of 9/11 impossible
to forget, would consider
a one-in-four chance of a

take the most immediate

pie bucks by pretending
to register voters and collecting extra paychecks
for work they didn't do.
Zooming out, pundits
and politicians saw the
most sinister of motives

on the part of their oppo-

nents. Writers on the left
accused Republicans of
trying to discredit a legitimate urban voter-registration organization, and
consequently of trying to
large
disenfranchise
(likely
numbers
of
Democratic) voters. John
McCain articulated (to an
extreme) the conservative counterpoint at the
final presidential debate,

and accused ACORN of
"one of the greatest frauds
in voter history," and of
"maybe destroying the
fabric of democracy."
However, if we step
back and look at the issue
through the values framework I've been presenting, we see a bit of a different picture: liberals
more concerned with
ensuring that as many
voters as possible are
enfranchised, even if
some violations of electoral law occur (fairness/freedom); conservatives more concerned
with ensuring that laws
are respected, even if that
leads to lower levels of
voter registration (justice/security).
Although this framework can't be applied to
all issues (I'd be hardpressed, for example, to
tell you how it applies to
economics), it seems clear
to me that on most issues

where there is a clear
"justice/security"

posi-

tion and an equally clear

"fairness/freedom" posi-

tion, the former is more
associated with conservatives, and the latter with
liberals. Take immigration. Take drug policy.
Take gay marriage (with
"justice/security"
seen
from the perspective of
selected religious doctrine). Take practically
any issue where some
degree of guilt or innocence must be established, but cannot be
objectively verified.
And yes, in my very
small study sample, these
hypotheses have been
borne out. Even on the
fairly loaded question,
"two immigrants are
arrested; one is illegal,
one is not; would you
deport both or neither?"
there was a predictable
partisan split among my
respondents.
So here, briefly, are

some of the final questions to be asked.
Q: Does this mean that
more sinister motives
(e.g.

partisan

politics

with ACORN, xenophobia
with immigration) do not
exist?
A: Of course not.
However, it does mean
that we shouldn't assume
they are the case for
everyone who possesses
contrary opinions.
Q: Where do these values come from?
A: This is where you'd
need to ask a psychologist, or a philosopher, or a
religious scholar. I have
guesses, but little more.
Q: Are these values
changeable?
A: Again, I don't know.
But they are flexible
enough for facts and
details to matter. If the
chances of Iraq posing a

threat were 95 percent, or
1 percent, you'd probably
have had very different
crowds of people supporting and opposing the war.
Likewise, the number of

registration
ACORN's
violations (generally only
the people who fund
ACORN, who found themselves paying people who
cheated on their jobs by
registration
falsifying
forms) was much less

than the number of potential voters who were registered
to vote by
ACORN; if the entire public had been presented
with these facts, it's quite
likely
the
firestorm
around ACORN would
have been weaker. That
many of the facts about
the case were not always
discussed, however, is not
an issue of values
this
is likely where we find
the blatant practice of
partisan politics, promoted by the politicians who
publicly passed judgment

on ACORN and overlooked the facts.
Q: Why does this matter? I'm going to disagree
with people anyway.
A:

Understanding

more about why people
disagree with you does
not mean you have to condone them or their value
system.
But as I said in my last
column, anything that
helps us understand the
underlying reasons for
disagreements gives us
more opportunities to
find common ground and
to engage in civil discourse.

After 38 years, a familiar Phillies voice goes silent
When I turned on the
Phillies
telecast last
Monday, I was stunned to
learn that Harry Kalas,
the team's announcer
since 1971 and a Hall of
Fame member since 2002,
had passed away. The day
before, Sunday, I had
jumped for joy as he
announced Matt Stairs'
game-winning bomb in
Denver, as I had countless
Josh Abel
times over the past two
Called Third
decades. And yet on
Monday, he was gone.
The following week
saw a tremendous outpouring of love and sorrow from
Philadelphians. His passing dominated the news and
people flocked to South Philadelphia to lie out their
remembrances at Citizens Bank Park.
I was surprised at how greatly Kalas' passing affected the city, but I shouldn't have been. For tens of thousands of people in the Philadelphia area, he was the
voice of our baseball obsession. An announcer has a
special place in baseball that other sports just don't
allow for. Even the most committed fans are unable to
attend all 150 or so games each season, so they experience the sport through a television or radio.
Even though it is the sport and the team that we
love, Harry Kalas was our link to them, and over 38
years, he became an institution, transcending the
microphone and becoming a meaningful and muchloved part of the Phillies experience himself.

For me, no great play has truly occurred until I
watch and re-watch the replay a handful of times. Even
when I'm at the ballpark for the game, I can't wait to see
the highlight reel upon returning home. When you
watch around 150 games per year on TV, the telecast
becomes an important part of how you understand the
sport.
The familiar angles they use become the natural way
to view the game. Similarly, the call of the announcer
becomes the natural way to hear the game. All of the
great moments that speckle my baseball fandom are
accompanied by the call of an announcer. As a Phillies
fan, this means Harry Kalas.
Mitch Williams' 4:30 a.m. game-winning hit; Scott
Rolen's game-winner in the first game after 9/11; Ryan
Howard's three-homer day; Jimmy Rollins' divisionclinching double play; Brad Lidge's strikeout to win the
World Series. All of these plays belong to great players
of the Phillies' past 20 years, but in a small way, they
belonged to Harry Kalas as well. And he did his best to
make sure that those great moments belonged to each of
us, too.

But baseball is only partly about the great moments.
A Major League season is long and filled with routine.
It's an announcer's most difficult job to remain engaging at these times. Many fail. Harry Kalas did not.
He had a beautiful, gravelly voice, and though it
could erupt when it needed to, it was usually calm and
comforting. One clip was a perfect demonstration of
this. It comes from a day game in 1998, the middle of
some very bad years of baseball for the Phillies. Kalas
is holding a cigar in the booth, sitting next to color commentator Chris Wheeler. There is near-silence in the
stadium these are the dog days of summer.

"Wheels, smoking a cigar is like falling in love. You
are first attracted to its shape. You stay with it for its
flavor. But always remember: never, never, never let
And the 0-1 pitch is inside for a

baU..."
I regret that I am too young recall vintage Kalas, for,
by all accounts, he was at his best when he was paired
with Richie "Whitey" Ashburn, who passed away in
1997.1 also can't gush about what a friendly guy he was
because my relationship with him was exclusively
through the airwaves.
I would feel disingenuous writing about these traits
because I was not privy to them personally, and so talking about them would cheapen what I feel was a true
relationship he and I had
a relationship that was
similar to but distinct from the ones he had with each
other Phillies fan.
He was a great announcer, but that's ultimately not
the point. By just being a central part of the baseball
experience in Philadelphia for so long, he became a
friend. Never was the listening experience as enjoyable
as when his partners were out of the booth, perhaps eating or in the bathroom, and it felt like he was talking

directly to you.

So I'll leave the proper eulogizing to people who have
met him face-to-face. They can properly tell you about

his warmth, his positive attitude, his ability to tell a
story. But even those of us who haven't met him can
claim Harry Kalas as a friend and share in the grief of
the Phillies and Kalas families. After all, every Phillies
fan shared at least one great passion with him, and we
all spent many summers in his company.

BY MADDIE WILLIAMS
mwillil@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore softball team (1219, 2-10 CC) was defeated by Gettysburg
(7-4-1 CC) in two close contests on the
road this Sunday, bringing the team's
record to 2-10 in the Centennial

Conference and 12-19 overall.
Gettysburg scored an early run in
the first inning, but Swarthmore managed to tie it up in the seventh, with
Kathryn Riley 'lO scoring the run.
Unfortunately, this effort wasn't
enough as Gettysburg managed to
sneak in one more run at the bottom of
the seventh. Melissa Emmerson 'll
had two hits in the loss.
The second contest was also a tight,
low-scoring game, but also ended with
a victory for the Bullets, as they were
able to squeak by the Garnet by a score
of 3-2.

The day before, at Franklin and

doubleheader, winning the first game
5-2 and losing the second 6-2. Though
the Diplomats established an, early
two-run lead, Swarthmore stepped up
its game and fought back.
Kira Kern 'll emerged from the first
game with two hits and a run.
Teammates Lauren Walker 'O9,
Scheirer and Riley also secured a hit
each.
Marley Spector 'l2 held her own on
the mound against the Diplomats,
vitally aiding her team to victory in
the first game.

In the

words of Hendrickson:
"Marley Spector has pitched several
incredible games and deserves to be
recognized. She always has such a positive attitude, and I really admire her."
Though the season may be winding
down in terms of days, it is far from
over. Swarthmore has three important
conference double headers just on the
horizon, and is hoping for favorable
outcomes in all of them, even though
they have been eliminated from playoff contention.
"I think that our team is up for the
challenge, and I look forward to finishing the season on a high note," said
Riley of the remainder of the season.
Also fresh on everyone's minds as
the end of the season looms is the
departure of the team's four seniors:
Kristin Caspar, Christine Sendelsky,
Alexandra Zelaski and Walker.
Hendrickson noted that the contributions of the graduating class extended beyond the diamond.
"Our seniors this year have helped
to change our program dramatically,"
she said.
"Their hard work allowed me to
walk into a winning program, and
their outreach to young players has
really made this program special,"
Riley added regarding the role of the
seniors on the development of the
team.

The Swarthmore softball team will
compete
against
Tri-Co
rival
Haverford this Saturday at 1 p.m.
before taking on the McDaniel in a
double header on Sunday at the
Clothier Fields.
Between games, the team's four seniors will be honored for their dedication and hard work for the team.

Swarthmore upsets Haverford on court
The Garnet men's tennis team scored
a key victory on the strength of three
doubles victories against Haverford on
Tuesday. The Garnet defeated the TriCo rivals by a score of 6-3, dealing the
Fords (7-1 CC) their first Centennial loss
of the season.
The #9 regionally-ranked Garnet (9-6,
7-1 CC) will host Franklin & Marshall (43 CC) on Saturday at home.
With a victory against the Diplomats,
and a loss by Haverford against Johns
Hopkins in a dual match on Saturday,
the Garnet will compete as the #2 seed
in the Centennial conference team tournament on May 1 at top-seeded Johns
Hopkins.
The Garnet would open the tournament against the Fords, ranked third
behind Swarthmore after Tuesday's
loss.

Women's lacrosse dismisses Neumann
on Senior Day
Three players scored five goals
apiece to boost the Garnet to a 21-15 victory against visiting Neumann College
on Tuesday night at Clothier Field.
Amy Vachal 11, Marissa Schaffer 'O9
and Emily Evans 'll each garnered five
tallies in the high-scoring match.
Vachal led the Garnet on the season
with 53 goals. Evans was second at 41,
while Marie Mutryn 'l2 had 30 to her
credit.
The season-closing match saw the
return of Garnet goalkeeper Ally Grein
'lO, whose absence in the last three
Centennial Conference matchups as she
recovered from a concussion was a fatal
blow to the Garnet's playoff hopes.
Grein returned to the net in the second half against the Knights, tallying

seven saves.
Stand-in goalie Jean
Dahlquist 'll notched six saves in the
first half to end her cold-turkey stint as
an emergency replacement for Grein.

The Garnet bid adieu to seniors
Annie Carter, Anna De Regt, Melissa

Wallwork upsets Hopkins standout
Garnet tennis standout Rachel
Wallwork 'lO upset Johns Hopkins'
standout first-year Carolyn Warren in
straight sets on Saturday, 6-3, 6-3.
Wallwork's #l3 regional ranking
made her the underdog against the newcomer, who was ranked #4 before falling
to Wallwork.
The Garnet dropped the match
against the #2l Blue Jays by a final
score of 7-2, and returned to the court
immediately after the match to make up
a rain-delayed match against Dickinson.
The double proved to be too much for
the Garnet (4-8, 3-4 CC), as they fell
again by a score of 7-2.
Wallwork, however, continued her
undefeated streak in the conference,
which now stands at 8-0, as she easily
handled Dickinson's Joelle Nitzburg,
6-1, 6-0.

Swarthmore regained momentum on
Monday by crushing McDaniel by a
score of 8-1, but fell at Haverford yesterday 6-3, and will host Franklin &

the regular season.

Bulls center Brad Miller in the first
round of the NBA playoffs, and I thought
about the peculiarity of a tip-off. That
thought spiraled into a sudden awareness about the significance of the beginning of sporting events.
Consider this: sports like football, soccer and baseball, largely rely on one
party starting in possession of the ball
and one team on defense.
However, sports like hockey, basketball and lacrosse, rely on some sort of
face-off to begin the game.
The importance of the face-off is
something that I often feel is underrated
in such sporting events, especially since
higher possession time traditionally
leads to more offensive production.
I feel somewhat shocked, but mostly
embarrassed, by my prior ignorance of
the importance of the opening draw.
First, think about a hockey face-off.
The official drops the puck between the
opposing centers, who, in the blink of an
eye, either win or lose the face-off and
redirect the puck to a teammate. Even
though the face-off is over quickly, the
impact on the flow of the game can be
tremendous.
Having played a good amount ofhockey in my day, I can recall games in which
the pace of the game is largely dictated
by the team that controls a majority of
the face-offs.
Hockey face-offs are particularly
salient when in an offensive zone, and
the difference between winning and losing a face-off can literally be scoring or
allowing a goal.
Additionally, hockey has more faceoffs than either lacrosse or basketball, so
the benefit of having multiple centers
that are talented at the draw can be
huge.

THE PHOENIX

BY JARED NOLAN

jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

Although basketball uses a mano-amano draw to begin the game like hockey, the tip-off is a unique element. For
example, there are literal consequences
to winning or losing the tip-off (like possession after quarters) aside from simply
the ability to score the first basket of the
game. Also, physical size and athletic
ability play a large role in the opening
tip-off of a game. It makes little sense to
have either a lumbering goon or a shorter player with springs take the opening
tip-off since, from what I can discern,
there is a happy medium that is most
effective.
Basketball's tip-off is also separated
from hockey and lacrosse in the way that
the official can severely influence the
outcome by means of a faulty or mistimed toss that may favor one team or the
other.
The final sport I chose to look at is the
one closest to my heart: lacrosse. The
lacrosse face-off is different from both
the hockey and basketball draws in that
the official never has possession of the
ball. Instead, it rests on the ground inches between the sticks of the opposing
face-off men. Also unique is the way that
a savvy face-off man can win the draw to
himself in a fashion not possible in
either hockey or basketball.
The lacrosse face-off man also needs
strong support from his wing players,
who can race in and scoop up the
groundball as well. Controlling the faceoffs in lacrosse has much stronger consequences than either hockey or basketball. A lacrosse team that can control the
face-off traditionally has a higher probability of winning the game, especially
since face-offs in lacrosse are more rare
than in hockey (but more common than
those in basketball).
Somehow, through all the years of
playing sports, I never realized the
unique differences between sports that
utilize a type of face-off system and those
that don't.
Though it pains me to criticize football, I have to admit that I think I like
face-off sports more in the way that two
players are isolated and physically pitted
against each other as representatives for
their teams.
Try this out: the next time you watch
a hockey or lacrosse game, pay particular attention to the face-offs and look for
the ways they impact the flow of the

Must-win jam to decide lacrosse's playoff destiny

The Garnet men's lacrosse team's 16-5 loss to
sixth-ranked Gettysburg on Saturday spoiled
Swarthmore's senior recognition day and dropped
them into a three-way tie for fourth place in the
Centennial Conference.
Since only the top four teams make the conference playoffs, Saturday's loss has sparked a mad
dash to the finish, which could be decided by multiple tiebreakers.
Following pre-game ceremonies in which gradseniors David DeSimone, Jesse Handler,
Henry Heaton, Jacob Metzger, Will Predun, Stelios

uating

Wilson and Ben Young were honored, the Garnet
got off to a fast start on the reigning conference
champs by winning the first face-off and putting in
the first goal.
After some
solid defensive play
over
Gettysburg's first few possessions, things began to
go the way of the Bullets, who scored six straight
goals to end the half. The visitors ultimately sealed
the victory with stark defense and superior play.
"They played to their potential. They're a great
team. I can't put it any other way," Predun said.
He was quick to add, "If we make the playoffs
we'd love to see them again."
That playoff mentality will suit the Garnet well
going into their final game against #8 Haverford
(7-0 in conference) on Saturday.

With a win, the Garnet would put themselves in
a favorable position to make the Centennial conference playoffs, while a loss almost assures that
they will be watching from Swarthmore's leafy
green campus.

Swarthmore is currently tied with McDaniel

and Muhlenberg for the final playoff spot.
To break the tie, the conference first looks at
the head-to-head record of each team involved in

the tie.

The Garnet beat McDaniel but lost to
Muhlenberg in double overtime, and McDaniel
has beaten Muhlenberg. Thus each team has a 1-1

record within the tie.
The next tiebreaker compares each team's
record against the top teams in the conference. On
Saturday, Swarthmore has a chance to separate
itself from the pack.
Neither McDaniel nor Muhlenberg have beaten
Haverford, so with a win, Swarthmore will clinch
the final playoff spot, regardless of what
Muhlenberg and McDaniel do.
As for Saturday's game, Max Wilson 'lO said
that the team is "caught up in the excitement." He
added that, "people are coming in an hour before
practice to go to the weight room or work on one-

on-ones."

Predun cited the team's short term goal as to
make the playoffs with aspirations to win the conference, but when pressed for what's most impor-

tant to this squad, the answer was simple: "the

group. "[We are] much more dedicated than in
past years," he said.
"The locker room has been very intense in comparison.
Everyone feels like they have a stake
in the win. People want it to the point that they're
willing to sacrifice a lot."
This weekend's contest will not only be do-orit could also be the

wearing the Garnet.
Admission to the ECAC postseason tournament
is never guaranteed, and a loss would end their
season, so this year's graduating class has a golden opportunity to avenge their senior day loss.
It would also give Swarthmore its first
Centennial Conference playoff berth in men's
lacrosse.

Come support the Garnet in their fight for the
postseason this Saturday at Haverford at 1 p.m.
