$1 million coffee bar
stolen from Kohlberg
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Needs A Real Job

Faculty and students alike reacted withshock when they
arrived at Kohlberg Wednesday morning only to see the

most prominent feature of the coffee bar missing
the
coffee bar itself. Despite the recent rash of projector thefts
from Kohlberg, the coffee bar, a 900-pound slab ofmarble
�and bronze, was assumed to be theft-proof, said Director
°f Public Safety Owen Redgrave.
Public Safety officers have conducted an extensive
search of the campus but have not yet turned up the missing coffee bar. "We as of yet have no leads," said
Redgrave, adding as an afterthought "We never haveany
leads. Damn it, we never solve anything."
•An unanticipated consequence of the theft has been
the effect of caffeine deprivation on over-worked students. When tourguide JeffLevine 'OO fell asleep during
his tour, one irate parent was overheard to remark "Well,
that's $130,000 this college will never see."
As no witnesses have come forth with any information, Redgrave fears that the campus community has
joined
in a conspiracy to cover up the theft. He bases
'this hypothesis on the difficulty of stealing such a large
item without anyone witnessing the crime. "And what
w°uld anyone want with a such a large slab of marble
anyway?," he queried. "It has no street value."
This latest theft may result in major changes in campus
security, Redgrave added. As all previous attempts at protecting college property have failed, the administration is
considering locking all campus buildings for most or all of
the day.

fire, the rest of the Ville erupted in flames late last

night and burned to the ground, leaving only a pile of
ashes and flame-retardant Swedish Fish candies for
firefighters to comb over this morning.
In spite of the extensive damage, Swarthmore citizens and students appear largely unfazed by the disaster. This morning two business-bound suits were
even seen high-fiving each other at the train station.
Despite earlier rumors that the volunteer
firefighters set the fire themselves, it now appears
that it was sparked by the carelessly discarded cigarette of a sassy skateboarding adolescent, whose underage tobacco purchases constituted Michael's College Pharmacy's only business.
"It's hard to hate him for [causing the fire]," owner
Michael said of Buddy Vilratt, the offending
firestarter. "He was my best customer."
Michael said that he was a little sad to see his life's
work devoured in flames, but that he has "other business" to keep him busy. Sources close to Michael have
intimated that he plans to move his heroin trade to
the circulation desk at Cornell.
"It's good because it's not used much. And you
wouldn't guess it, but man, can some of those science
kids be smackheads," said landlord extraordinaire

associate" of Michael's.
Nor was there concern about the fire among the key
players in Swarthmore's largest industry, hair butchery. Tiffany O'Toole, owner of Swarthmore Hair Studio, commented, "We've been losing money in all those
lawsuits. I was like, another appearance on Judge Judy
and I'm calling it quits."
Indeed, the only people to openly voice disappointment about the fire were administrators in the
Swarthmore Admissions Office, who were concerned
that its coinciding with the visits of prospective students will make it more difficult for the college to draw
a decent yield for the class of 2004.
"It definitely makes it harder for us to make it look
like there's stuff to do there," said Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet. She said that the college is considering constructing a temporary ghost town modeled on the sets of old Western movies for the upcoming prospective student weekend.
"The plans for Langville aren't definite yet, of
course, but when we get around to it, we expect that,
as with the Mullan Center, it will be constructed in a
timely manner," Vice President of Facilities Larry
Schall commented.

Campus alcohol policy to change, but how?
By Brendan Karch
Phoenix Staff
In the wake of increased concern nationwide about underage
drinking and Swarthmore's own
Margaritaville incident last year,
a committee of deans, faculty and
students has spent several
months thoroughly re-examining
the college's alcohol policy. The
committee's recommendations,
which will be finalized in the upcoming weeks, could substantially change the party funding
system and tighten the rules that
ineffectually control the misuse
of college funds to buy alcohol.
The Deans' Advisory Committee (DAC) report, portions of
which were obtained by The
Phoenix, offers four tentative
remedies for the misuse of funds:
having a non-student review
party receipts, limiting locations

where students can buy party

items, creating direct accounts
with businesses, and having a

monitor randomly inspect parties and check receipts against
actual party items. According to
Dean and DAC Chair Bob Gross,
one of these solutions, or a similar one, could be in place for the
fall semester.
Although tangible action is still
a month or more away, there is a
pervasive sense of doubt over the
ability to enact long-term, workable change. While the consensus
is that the student government
should try to change the policy
on its own terms first, there is
also a more hard-line current that
sees the necessity of forceful administrative action and a skepticism that the deans and students
do not have the willpower to correct the system. Most agree that,
if the deep-seeded and common-

"The result will be that
the system will get
tightened up. Exactly
how I don't know."
Dean Bob Gross
place misuse of funds is to be cor-

rected, the deans will have to
walk a tight line between repressive measures and ineffectiveness.

Committee work
The Deans' Advisory Committee, which was formed two years
ago as a conglomeration of an ad
hocalcohol policy committee and
the Academic Support Committee, set out this fall to thoroughly
examine all aspects of the
college's alcohol policy.

According to faculty committee member Frank Moscatelli,

DAC found four major issues
worth discussing, the two most
pervasive being underage drinking and the misuse of Social Affairs Committee (SAC) funds to
buy alcohol. However, DAC's focus quickly turned to the misuse
of funds and forged receipts on
the part of students. DAC faculty
member Tim Burke said that the
faculty, and to a lesser extent the
deans, were taken aback by the
common disregard for policy.
"I was a little astonished at the
kind of crassness of, 'There is
this rule, but... what the hell, let's
find ways to get around it with
faked receipts,'" saidBurke. He
added that, unlike the issue of
underage drinking, the committee felt that they could and should
remedy misuse of funds.
DAC brought in representa-

tives from student governing organizations and from local law
enforcement to assess the current policy. DAC faculty member
Nora Johnson said that the committee was not interested in farreaching investigation but rather
in getting a general concept
based on reports. Former Student Budget Committee (SBC)
Treasurer Josh Bess 'OO was one
of the presenters. He said that
the committee "didn't really
know how the [party funding]
system worked," and that he
spent most of his time discussing different permutations of receipt forgery.
DAC members' realization that
college policy is being so extensively undermined brought out a
host of concerns. According to
Gross, the college did, at one

Sager to bring

CAYLEY PENDERGRASS | Phoenix Staff

To take pressure off of the snack bar, Sharpies Dining Hall will now be open continuously from 7:30 a.m. to 7:15 p.m. on weekdays.

Sharples institutes open-door policy
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
Starting Monday, if the urge to eat strikes you at 3 in the

afternoon, Sharpies will welcome you with open doors. To af-

ford students more flexible dining opportunities, the dining
hall will be open continuously during daytime hours.
The dining hall will begin offering limited items in between
its regular meal times.From 9:30 to 11:00 a.m., students will
have access to a continental breakfast that includes all regular Sharpies cold breakfast items. From 1:30 to 4:30 p.m.,
Sharpies will offer a light lunch consisting of the deli and
salad bars, pre-made grill items, Pino's Pasta, and desserts.
Meals will be debited as breakfast credit from 7:30 to 10:30
a.m., lunch credit from 10:30-3:30 and dinner credit from 3:30
to 7:15 p.m., except on Saturday and Sunday, when the dining
hall will still close at 6:30 p.m.
Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall announced
the new service, which she titled the "open door policy," in a
reserved-students e-mail yesterday afternoon. The idea for
the expanded dining option grew out of a meeting of a consortium of colleges that McDougall attended several weeks ago.
She decided to introduce expanded services at Sharpies after representatives of other colleges mentioned that they had
similar services at their schools.
According to McDougall, the service will be implemented

with relative ease. "It's actually cut work for some people,"
she said, citing the hours now spent taking apart and reassembling the salad bar as a current source of inefficiency
(the salad bar will continue to be replenished in a sanitary
manner). She conceded that ID card checkers will find their
hours slightly increased by the new service but said that she
has received no complaints from workers thus far. The only
potential glitch in the new service is that students must agree
to only use the front door during off hours.
Perhaps if it were not for the simplicity of instating the
"open door policy," the college would not be willing to take a
chance on it again. McDougall said that the service was used
up until about ten years ago but that it was apparently discontinued because of a lack of student interest.
When asked whether she fears the same result this time,
however, McDougall was optimistic. "I don't see it going
away," she said flatly.
Rather, she sees the new service making the college's dining services more efficient and better received. "Part of our
dream is that it would take some of the pressure off of Tarble."
McDougall said that since she sent out the e-mail she has
already received several positive responses from students.
For Kyung Lee 'O2, who said he now eats primarily at Essie
Mae's, the change could compel him to eat at Sharpies. Under the current system, he said, "There are times when I
just can't make it to Sharpies."

A symposium sponsored by the Sager
Committee will bring a slew of national
queer activists to campus this weekend to
speak on transgender issues.
For much of the non-queerSwarthmore
community, the word Sager evokes images of a Saturday night gender-bending
dance, but in fact the dance is only the
wild offspring of the more sober symposium.
This year, organizer Becca Hover '99
hopes the symposium will draw more campus attention. This weekend's conference,
in addition to being larger than those held
in years past, also has the appeal of focusing on a unique theme.
"I think it's one of the first times there's
been an entire weekend devoted to
transgender organizing or the
transgender movement," Hover said. "I
believe very strongly that the 'gender
fence'
the highly enforced, nearly unchallengeable [sic] division between the
two sexes
needs to be torn down."
She is joined in this belief by a panel of
renowned speakers, most of whom serve
as directors of national queer rights organizations. They will be speaking on a
range of transgender issues, including the
history of transgender activism both nationally and locally and the relation of the
movement to other types of activism.
For members of the college community
not knowledgeable about transgender issues, Hover recommended attending Kate
Bornstein's performance of "Y2Kate: Gender Virus 2000." "It will be entertaining
t> ut
and engaging
Kate is hilarious
it's also probably the best introduction to
transgender issues," she said.
In addition to reaching out to members
of the community, Hover hopes to promote
discussion. Every session will include a
question and answer period, and Sunday s
closing session will be principally discussion based. "Most of the speakers will be
on the panel, but the bulk of the time will
be devoted to discussion among panelists,
between panelists and participants and
among the participants," Hover explained-

Ruth discredits sexual myths in talk
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff

Perched on a box in order to be
seen over the podium, Dr. Ruth
Westheimer charmed her audience Tuesday night with bothher
sexual frankness and her short
stature. Standing only 47" high,
and shrinking, she fears, Dr. Ruth
opened her talk on sexual literacy by admitting "I don't know
if this fancy new theater has ever
heard the kind of language we're
going to use tonight."
A famous psychosexual therapist, Dr. Ruth nonetheless described herself as "old-fashioned
and square." The purpose of her
speech, she said, was to debunk
sexual myths and help eradicate
what she termed sexual illiteracy.
Despite the candidness with
which she addresses sexuality,
she emphasized her belief that
"sex should remain a private
matter." She vowed not to ask any
personal questions and assured
those who wanted to ask questions that "You never have to say
T,' you can always say 'a friend
of mine.'"
Such humorous remarks and
anecdotes gave her speech a light
and jesting flavor despite the
gravity of the topic. This method
of education through humor
stems from the Talmud, Dr. Ruth
said, referring to the influence of
her Jewish heritage.
The myths under discussion
broached a wide range of sexual

BRENDAN KARCH | Phoenix Staff

Dr. Ruth Westheimer, author of "Sex for Dummies," spoke Tuesday night
in a visit sponsored by Ruach, Hillel and the Sexual Health Counselors.

topics including masturbation,
unintended pregnancy, homosexuality, orgasm and premature
ejaculation. While neither a
physiologist nor a gynecologist,
she discredited both traditional
and contemporary myths using
common sense and scientific
data collected in the Johnson and
Masters study of 140,000 sexual
intercourse episodes. She also
endeared herself to her audience

by
favorably
comparing
Swarthmore undergraduates to
Harvard graduate students who,
she reported, looked at their
hands when she related the myth
that masturbation causes hair to
sprout in the palms.
Addressing her attention to
more currently prevalent myths,
such as that of the "G-spot," Dr.
Ruth cautioned the audience not
to accept the stories of the media without scientifically validated data. "We should be careful not to create new myths," she
said. Citing as an example the
recent obsession with multiple
orgasms, she warned that such
media focus is "putting pressure
on that sexual encounter that is
not necessary."
In addition to debunking
sexual myths, Dr. Ruth also took
a stand on many controversial
issues, an ideological practice
that she again referenced to her
heritage as a Jew in Germany.
This heritage forced her to leave
Germany, the country of her
birth, as a child in order to escape
Nazi persecution. Educated in
Switzerland, she spent time in
Israel and France before emigrating to the United States,
where she received advanced
degrees in both sociology and
education. One of the lessons she
took from the Nazi regime that
also applies in America is that
"You have to stand up and be
counted for what you believe,"
she said.
One belief to which she adheres very strongly, because of
the one million unintended pregnancies per year in the United
States, is the necessity of legal
abortion. Having lived during the
era when the only alternative for
a pregnant woman without
money was a coat hanger, she
urged "Abortion must remain legal, not as a contraceptive, but
when there is a contraceptive
failure."

As her degrees reflect, Dr.
Ruth sees herself as both a therapist and a teacher. In addition to
working on a personal level in
her private practice, she uses the
media as a "teachable medium."
Her media career began in 1980
with a 15-minuteradio show entitled "Sexually Speaking." From
that modest beginning, she has
grown to world prominence, with
appearances on a number of major television shows and a long
list of books to her name. One of
the most popular books, "Sex for
Dummies," has been translated
into 23 languages, including Arabic, she said with pride.
To fit in with the academic setting, Dr. Ruth included homework assignments during her
speech. Women, she said, were to
do Kegel exercises (contractions
of the vaginal muscles) at every
red light and "then look into the
next car and wink." The assignment for men was a monthly testicular examination, and she
added "Please people, not to
check here [during the talk]."
Although both of these homework assignments stress the
physical aspect of sexuality, she
concluded her talk with an emphasis on the mind. The key to a
healthy sexual relationship, she
explained, is literacy and education. "Sex is not between the
waist and the knees; sex is between the ears," she said. "Anything that has to do with pleasure
is in the brain."
A question and answer session
followed her speech with both
live questions from audience
members and the reading of
questions previously collected at
Sharpies. People with more private concerns followed her into
the lobby where she spoke more
intimately and autographed copies of her books.
Dr. Ruth's visit was sponsored
by Ruach, Hillel and the Sexual
Health Counselors.

Dumic said determining
whether a user's access should be

he would continue to ask users to

Dorms may get public PCs
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
With students continually
asking for 24-hour public computer access in Beardsley, the
computing center is instead
planning to put computers and
laser printers in several
dorms. The plan would attempt
to duplicate the success of introducing publicly available
computers in Mary Lyon, the
dorm farthest from campus.
The computing center is
planning to install public machines and a laser printer in
two or three dorms next year
and potentially in other dorms
in future years. The installations would also contain extra
network jacks so students
with laptop computers could
connect to the network.
Robin Jacobsen, managerof
user services, said because of
high enrollment, the biggest

issue with installing the computers would be finding adequate space in the dorms. She
said existing computing center student employees, such as
dorm consultants, would take

responsibility for mamtaining
the machines.
The plan developed as an al-

ternate solution to requests
for all-night access.
"We've been asked pretty
consistently over thepast two
years for a 24-hour computer
lab," said Director of Computing Services Judy Downing.
Jacobsen said while there
was sufficient interest in
keeping the Beardsley public
area open all night, finding
student employees to staff it
during that time would be impossible. She also said she was
concerned about the safety of
students using computers in
an unlocked building in the
middle of the night.

Alcohol policy may be changed Esteemed Chinese
From ALCOHOL, pg. 4

time, all but officially fund alcohol for student parties. However,

rising litigiousness in the 'Bos
combined with a 1989 act that
tied federal funding to obeying
federal and state law prompted
a change in college policy. Although these sentiments have
been tempered somewhat, said
Gross, there is still the candid realization that the college cannot
fund alcohol for legal and litigious reasons.
"Should there be a party,
Should someone get hurt, and
should there be some investigation, then it would take an investigator. .. not 30 minutes of walking around this campus to find
out that student activity money
was used for liquor at that party,"
said Moscatelli. "The college
would be highly exposed litigiously."
The result of the committee's
re-evaluation will be reported in
"The Report on Dean's Advisory
Committee Review of Alcohol
Policy." Now in draft form, the
findings are being written by Assistant Dean and DAC member
Tedd Goundie, who declined to
comment for this article. Excerpts of the report obtained by
The Phoenix lay out basic suggestions to prevent misuse of SAC
funds: "limiting locations where
students could buy items for parties, opening direct accounts with
these businesses, having a nonstudent review receipts submitted for reimbursement, and inventory the items at randomly
selected parties and check the
inventory against receipts submitted."
While most agree that the
fourth measure is draconian and
unrealistic, several DAC members affirmed the first two suggestions as workable solutions.
Moscatelli saw the limitation of
party sources as feasible, and
Burke saw a contradiction in faculty often being subject to financial scrutiny, but students finding these practices offensive
when applied to them. Moscatelli,
however, was quick to point out
loopholes, particularly the laundering of money through bands.
(Party organizers can inflate the
cost of the band on party applications and then use the extra
money to buy alcohol.)
Bess, on the other hand, went
so far as to call DAC's proposals
"ludicrous." He added that "the
sort of 'Don't ask, Don't Tell'
thing had its function for a while,
and I think works all right."
Moscatelli said some students
suggested that, because the
policy works on the whole, there
is nothing ethically wrong with
accepting fraudulent receipts
and DAC student member Jor-

dan Brackett 'Ol admitted that
the status quo was also an option
brought up. Burke said that, if
Swarthmore were not a dry town,
the issue couldbe easily resolved
by differential paid admission to
parties based on whether a person wants to drink. But in the absence of a non-regulatory solution, the committee, especially
faculty, saw the overwhelming
need for policy change.
While Gross said, "The faculty
tend to see [the issue] in much
starker terms," he also felt a general consensus that free alcohol
is not an entitlement. "I think
there was a feeling [on DAC] that
free alcohol is not one of the entitlements. Students are fond of
quoting theethic that everything
at Swarthmore is free and that
nobody should have to pay for
anything," said Gross. "We just
can't buy that."
...

Enacting change

The committee has essentially
ended discussion on alcohol
policy and the main issues will
soon move out of the committee
room. Although changes are still
several weeks and perhaps several months away, there are already conflicting opinions about
the scope and force with which
the deans will act.
Moscatelli believes that DAC's
final report should more strongly
encourage policy change. In the
current draft, the concluding remark about misuse of SC funds
reads, "[The committee] recommends that members of the
Dean's Office work with SAC and
BC to eradicate this practice."
Moscatelli finds the language too
weak, and suggested instead that
DAC "charge" student organizations to make change. He said
that the expected changes should
have a "due date," much like a
regular academic assignment.
Burke agrees. "I didn't think
we had to be heavily prescriptive," he said, referring to previous committee decisions, "but I
thought we should leave [the
deans] with a charge to do something." Both Burke and Gross
pointed out that the deans would
probably allow the students to
find a solution on their own.
Burke said that the apparatus of
student government would have
the committee's suggestions to
fall back on, but that the responsibility will be theirs.
At least at first. But if students
fail to enact change, then Burke
saw the need for more "proactive" and more "annoying" measures.
Bess said that he thinks students would find a way to placate
the deans without making serious
policy changes. If this is the case,
then "annoying" and "proactive"
policies may be necessary. But

committee members said they do

not want that. "I think that if it
comes to the point where it's the
difference between being really

repressive and punitive and not
doing something," Burke said,
"[the deans will] probably choose
not doing something."
If the belief that students' interests are inimical to DAC's interests holds true, then the deans
may be hard-pressed to find a
policy that is effective and that
students can learn to accept.
Nonetheless, Burke, at least, does
not doubt the deans' ability to
find an effective solution.
If the deans are to find one,
Moscatelli noted, they must also
address a serious contradiction.
"Minimizing litigious [liability]
and minimizing student injury
are not always helped by the
same thing," said Moscatelli.
"Some things that could minimize the college's litigious [liability] might even enhance student
alcohol abuse. Like, for example,
totally dryparties, which... force
students to drink in their room."
One committee member was reminded of just such a policy at
University of Pennsylvania.
Brackett, who as Student Council co-chair would be partly responsible for making changes to
the current policy, sees this contradiction as an impasse that
some committee members are
not willing to see. "Most of the
solutions offered undermine the
exact goals we're trying to
achieve of having safe alcohol
consumption," said Brackett. The
committee feels pressed to comply with the law and with college
morals by ending school funding
for alcohol. But if the college
wants to promote safe drinking
and keep student events free,
then the college seemingly must
fund alcohol. Brackett sees no
way around this alcohol policy
paradox.
On a much subtler note, Gross
intimated thepotential for a lessthan-perfect policy. "The result
will be that the system will get
tightened up," said Gross.
"Exactly how I don't know.
Whether it gets tightened up in a
way that is 100percent foolproof,
I doubt."

author Mo Yan speaks
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff

Renowned author Mo Yan
spoke in McCabe last Friday to
the largest crowd he has drawn
yet on his tour of the United
States. Nearly 80 students, faculty and members of the greater
community resisted the allure of
the warm afternoon sun to watch
Mo present an adeptly woven
arrangement of folktales, personal anecdotes, political jibes
and passages from his novels.
It was a rare opportunity for
all involved. The audience took
part in an intimate dialogue with
a potential future Nobel laureate,
and the speaker gained a warm
reception on his first trip to the
U.S.
Until a year ago, Mo's position
in the People's Liberation Army
had prevented him from coming
to the U.S. without an official delegation. He worked for the Creative Writing Group of the PLA
for 20 years, during which time
he wrote a number of subversive
works. His brave novels, especially "Red Sorghum," caused
him some problems with the authorities, but Mo said that they
never outright chastised him because, "deep in their hearts, they
really liked [my works]."
In the end, however, Mo quit
because he felt uncomfortable
with the institution's reactionism.
"When I quit, the army was so
happy! They said, 'Finally you
decided to leave. That's great.'"
Mo's position as a national treasure now gives him some license
to speak openly about China's
political situation, and he responded to questions about political matters with great candor. He
cited widespread corruption and
an exploding population as the
two biggest problems facing
China today.
As the politically savvy writer
related his views on writing, however, it became clear that his
background and not his current
ideology is the driving force behind his works. He even emphasized his belief that the artistic

should be separate from the political and said that he has tried
to keep political references out
of his novels.
Mo's background certainly
provides enough material as it is.
His novels are filled withreferences to his humble past growing up as a peasant in poor
Shandong province. The folktales
told to him as a child by his
grandfather have since been fodder for many of his works, and
his speech was a seriesof adages
about writing interspersed with
some of that folklore.
"For a creative writer,
books...are not the most crucial
thing. The most crucial things
are inspiration, the imagination,
and life experience," he said.
For Mo, life experience has
been central to the process of
writing. Mo described a childhood steeped by rich experience
but also by suffering. "Hunger
and loneliness are themes I've
repeatedly explored in my novels, and I consider them the
source of my riches," he said.
"You have to taste bitterness.
Then you will be able to write."

Well worth the wait

I

A year and a half after it was scheduled to open, the
new Mullan Tennis Center will be finished this weekend. While the delay was certainly depressing, the new
facility will be well worth the wait.
For one, the inside of the building is beautiful. The
windows let in nice, soft natural light as a result of the
extensive use of glass in the design; the balcony for
spectators leads nicely down to the three courts themselves. The surface on them, Rebound Ace, is the same as
what is used in the Australian Open, according to men's
tennis coach Mike Mullan, for whom the center is named.
But even more notable than the improvement in tennis
facilities is the quantum leap in weight training equipment, because the $150,000 of new fitness machines in
the tennis building simply cannot be compared with the
thrown-together junk in the fieldhouse that resembled a
fitness center the way Al Bloom resembles a weightlifter
What is also amazing is that the college managed to
build such an impressive, Swarthmore-caliber building for
just $3 million.That amount of money just does not go
very far these days when you want to build things, as is
painfully obvious from the $60.5 million price tag of the
DuPont science center project. The facilities crew did an
impressive job keeping costs down while maintaining the
quality of the project. And that was while the tennis center
continued to face what seemed like endless delays,
although none of them were within the college's control.
Also deserving of recognition, of course, is principal
donor Jerome Kohlberg '46, who decided to name the
building after Mullan. Kohlberg, who has helped to
fund other projects including the academic building
that bears his name, should be lauded for, together
with administration, developing a project that fulfills a
real need at the college.
It's not every day that the campus gets a new
building. Go visit the Mullan Tennis Center next week,
and be pleasantly surprised.

Computing changes
With technology increasingly becoming an integral
colleges and
universities across the country, a school's competence
in handling access to technology can become a major
factor in how convenient (or how difficult) life for its
students and faculty is. Already, Wired Magazine ranks
colleges for how "wired" they are, a sign of the
technological revolution currently in progress.
It is therefore with appreciation that we welcome
news of the Computing Center taking action to keep
students connected, installing public computers in the
dorms for 24-hour access and investigating recent
slowdowns in the college's Internet access. These
changes will help keep Swarthmore from falling behind
the leading edge of academic technology.
The public computers in the dorms are perhaps the
best technological improvement to hit Swarthmore in the
past few years. Over the next couple years, the CC will
install two or three computers in each dorm, enabling
students working late to have access to all technology
available during the day. Additionally, the public computing areas will include network jacks for laptops, giving
night owls with sleeping roommates a place to work.
The other, more troublesome issue with which the CC
is currently dealing is Internet access. Swarthmore's
Internet traffic has doubled since November 1999, and
the college has gone from a consumer to a supplier of
information. The demandfor bandwidth is increasing at
a rate far beyond what the college can afford to supply.
It is a credit to the CC and its embrace of the college's
educational philosophy that it has adopted a policy of
not filtering or policing network traffic. Ultimately,
however, the college will run into a wall. No ISP will put
up with overuse for too long, and the demand for
bandwidth will not slow anytime soon. Falling behind
should not be an option for the college technology is
undoubtedly part of the future of academia, and regardless of cost, Swarthmore should be securing that future.

lETTERTOTHE EDITOR

Diallo case widely misunderstood
To the Editor:
Limited space prevents me from explaining the full
extent of Isiuwa Iyahen's misunderstandings and assumptions (shared by many others) regarding the
Diallo verdict, as presented in her emotional diatribe
in The Phoenix ("My verdict on the Diallo shooting,"
pg. 8, Opinions, March 16). At least she admits that
she is "not an expert on the American legal system."
I'll fill that void and explain some of the legal aspects
behind the acquittals, facts that may seem perverse
and were never discussed by the popular media. I
wasn't at the trial, and there was a great deal of conflicting testimony, so I won't try to reach a "verdict"
myself. The jury (which included four African-Americans out of 12) already acquitted the officers.
1. The fact that it was later discovered (even only
five seconds later) that Diallo was unarmed is completely irrelevant with respect to the justifiability
of the shooting. If the officers reasonably believed
at the time that Diallo was reaching for a weapon (a
result of miscommunication and split-second interpretation of Diallo's movements) then it does not
matter, legally, whether or not a weapon is actually
found later.
2. If the shooting was justified, then the fact that 41
shots were fired says nothing in and of itself. Handguns (as opposed to shotguns and rifles) are marginal
at best with respect to quickly stopping a threat, and
as a result, every cop out there is taught to keep firing until the threat no longer exists. Folks, real
shootings aren't like the movies where one bullet instantly and dramatically knocks the guy down for
good. There are cases of felons being shot dozens of
times and not going down. There was a great deal of
ballistic and psychomotor evidence presented, and in
the end, the number of shots was not and is not an
issue in this case.
3. There was no evidence presented by the prosecution that indicated a racial motive. If you read
some of the trial transcripts, you'll see that it wasn't
an issue. The mere fact that the four cops were white
and Diallo was black proves absolutely nothing.
People need to stop reflexively jumping to the "racist" explanation every time an incident like this happens. Also, remember that when justifiability is
claimed, the burden of proof effectively shifts to the

defense. You're admitting to the act, so you have to prove
that you were justified (a high standard), making it that
much harder to get acquitted. Any doubt about your
motives and you're fried.
The fact remains that these cops killed an unarmed
and innocent man. Diallo's estate might win a wrongful
death civil case if they go after the city. Diallo was shot
while standing in a poorly lit alcove, a fact that was used
by the defense to help explain the officers' nebulous fear
of a weapon. The glaring error that these cops made is
probably not a result of evil motives, but of poor training by the city. Four cops, four guns, not one flashlight.
Many law enforcement agencies teach their officers techniques to use their handguns and flashlights together to
positively identify threats before shooting. It's pretty
simple
you don't shoot what you can't see. Similar
shootings have occurred because of this lack of training,
so Diallo's estate should go after the city and find some
peace in the fact that training will be changed to prevent
another unnecessary shooting.

Bad oranges
at the Oscars
If you were out of the room getting a

drink, you may have missed one of Billy

Crystal's jokes this past Sunday night
while watching the Academy Awards.
News was that some statuettes had been
stolen and recovered prior to awards
night. For one of the many jokes of the
evening that played on this fact, Crystal
held up a long, clear bag of oranges with
two Oscars in it. He "reassured" the audience that everything was okay because
they had just found the last two stolen
statuettes. They were hidden in a "bag
of oranges at an off-ramp of the Santa
Monica Freeway." I was not amused.
Most of the Americans watching the
show outside of Los Angeles probably
had no clue what the Southern California cultural reference was about. The
oranges are sold mostly by recent Mexican immigrants who have found a niche
market selling agricultural goods, usually oranges, at busy street intersections
and freeway off-ramps in Los Angeles.
It's not that I object to the use of oranges as the butt of a joke. I'm sure
fruits have had an illustrious history in
comedy. The basic intention of the joke
was to think of a pretty random place
for the stolen statuettes to be hidden; a
previous joke mentioned that some
statuettes were recovered in a dumpster
in an obscure Los Angeles suburb. However, the butt of Crystal's joke also
played on the fact that these oranges are
sold by the invisible, faceless Mexican
immigrants who are on the margins of
the city. Their very strategy of making
a living by peddling oranges at high-traffic public streets is symbolic of their
marginalized position in Los Angeles and
made them prime candidates for tasteless humor.
Sometimes, the most ordinary thing
can say a lot about our society. There are
certain "pure" jokes that hit directly on
the comedic shades of our modern human condition. Often they play on our
inability to control our universally human flaws. Subjects on the difficulties
of male-female communication and our
ability to do stupid things in public are
just two of the regular subjects of the
"pure" joke mill.
This little orange joke, however, is the
second type of joke that is not "purely"
funny but rather invidious because it
plays on the marginalized, often invisible, and thus disempowered members
of society. The f unniness of the joke relies on the obscurity and "strangeness"
of the mostly Mexican immigrant freeway vendors who almost exclusively
sell oranges. The marginality of these
bags of oranges serves as humor for the
mainstream audience because, paradoxically, as obscure as they are, the
audience can believe that stolen goods
could be hidden in such a place away
from general authorities. As innocuous
as this joke may seem, it inadvertently
reflects the marginal social and political reality of Mexican immigrants in
California.
Just some fruit for thought.

Diversity extends beyond skin color
By Jane Ng
For The Phoenix

The discussion of racial issues on campus is more active now than anytime this
year. The Wharton RA issue alone makes
this clear. I think we all should be proud
of Swatties' passion and willingness to
engage in such dialogue. However, after
reflecting on the issue more, I have discovered that there is a whole side of racial diversity that is rarely mentioned on
this campus.
When I first heard of the complaint by
BoHee Yoon 'Ol to Student Council, I was
disturbed by her claims. Being a "student
of color," one might first assume I would
embrace her cause. I have been trying to
figure out what it is that disturbs me, and
this is my (probably pretty controversial)
hypothesis: I am profoundly disturbed by
the underlying assumption in Ms. Yoon's
argument that an RA of color will serve
the needs of a student of color based on
the fact that they are both "colored." This
disturbs me because it more than subtly
implies a "homogeneity" of all "students
of color."
Okay, let's dig into this issue a bit. What
does "student of color" mean? I interpret
it as meaning "non-white student" or "visible minority student." So, in a sense, Ms.
Yoon is suggesting that an RA of color, who
can be black, Asian, Latino, mixed or other,

This whole argument seems not to be based on racial differences;it
is based on skin-color differences. It is based on whether one is
white, or "colored," with the racial differences among the "colored"
and "white" completely ignored.
will better serve the racial concerns of
myself, a student of Chinese heritage who
looks Asian, better than a white RA can.
On what grounds? On the common ground
that we both have a different skin color
than white folks, with the logic that we
both look different than, what, the 45 percent rest of campus. It doesn't matter that
a black RA has a different racial background than I do; just because we are both
visible minorities, I should be able to discuss cultural differences with him or her
better than with a white RA.
This whole argument seems not to be
based on racial differences; it is based on
skin-color differences. It is based on
whether one is white, or "colored," with
the racial differencesamong the "colored"
and "white" completely ignored. I find it
offensive to say that I, as an Asian, will
understand the cultural problems of a
Latino student better than a white student
can.

Heck, if you think about it even the term
Asian is problematic. Asian may mean a
"race" to some people, but for me, Asian

just means you have a yellower,

browner

tone in your skin. Yes, a person of Korean
descent and a person of Indian descent are
both Asians, but they can hardly be called
the same race. Along the same line of
thought, who is to say there is no diversity among "the whites"? Correct meifi
am wrong, but a person of Irish descent
and a person of Italian descent are both
white, right?
The term "diversity" now seems to solely
stand for how diverse we look. It is one

level of diversity, but it is not all. I did not
do research into the differences in cultural
heritage and religion of next year's RAs,
but those are also aspects of racial identity other than physical appearance. Without mentioning either of those factors and
failing to include others like sexual orientation and social-economic background in
a definition of diversity, I believe it is unfair for anyone to accuse the RA assignment in Wharton and Dana as not "wellintegrated" and the RA Selection Committee as not doing a good job in trying to create a diverse RA environment.

tuting a "minority" at Swarthmore thatis
somehow comparable to racial or socioeconomic or other demographic minorities. While they probably do constitute a
political minority among the college population during their four years here, their
conservative politics do not lead them to
experience the kind of lifetime identitybased oppression to which people of color
in this society are accustomed.
Of course, "people of color"and "minority" take their place in a long and continuing history of contests over racial terms.
In his memoir "Colored People," Henry
Louis Gates talks about why in some ways
he is more comfortable with this term
from his childhood than with contemporary racial language. In a similar way,
African American (first hyphenated, then
not) has overtaken Black as the more generally preferred referent. At the same
time, the newer term has not completely
replaced the older one; Swarthmore, for
instance, calls its academic concentration
Black Studies, which perhaps expresses
better the common experiences of Black
people whether or not they are Americans.
In my first year at Swarthmore, someone expressed to me a novel defense of
the word "minority": he felt it was more
inclusive because it captured both "racial
and sexual minorities." On the one hand,
this ideaallows theword to express a more
comprehensive vision of oppression, and
I appreciate the sense that queer people
at Swarthmore are recognized as a component of campus diversity.
At the same time, it's important to remember that being queer isn't the same
as being of color. The two oppressions are
intersecting rather than parallel. Moreover, the oppression of women is not captured by reference to "racial and sexual
minorities"; the aspiration to be comprehensive might actually be a misplaced one,
since it isn't possible to name every oppression. Oppression and marginalizaton
operate along many axes and in many
guises; in identifying and transforming
these social processes, I want to be careful not to conflate minority status with
oppression. In the end, then, I write not to
praise "minority," but to bury it.

One might think that the conference on
aid and Africa last Saturdayand the faculty/
activist panel on globalization and free trade
only three days before were two isolated
events in the lifeof a vibrant academic community. As one of the lucky individuals who
had the opportunity to attend both, I'd like
to dispute this. It wasn't that SPAC and Conscious Consumers, who were organizing the
panel, were in league with Professors Steve
O'Connell and Ray Hopkins, who organized
the conference. I think both events were
trying to discuss certain changes that we
are seeing in the world, certain changes that
we all should pay attention to.
On a really fundamental level, these
changes are changes in the philosophy of
resources. Globalization is trying to universalize free capital flows, and thus im-

flowing throughout the world like one gigantic carnival of dollars and
deutschmarks, yen and pound sterling. It
makes it nearly impossible to talk about
resources in terms ofreal people andraising the standard of lives. Where is development in this picture? Where is Africa?
There were certainly undertones at the
conference about how Africa could
modify itself to make it fit in this new glo-

bal economic order on the terms of the
rich and powerful. There is a sense in
which the soulless language of capital is
infiltrating the fundamentally human basis of economic development.
What happened to worrying about real
things? Real people, real places? In our race
to escape the realities of our mundane existences, are we banking our lives on something that isn't really there, quite literally?
Capital flows or dot-com stocks are not, for
me, synonymous with food, shelter, clothing or a job at a living wage. It also isn't
equated, at least in my mind, with some
other great things that I can't see but hope
are there: love, friendship, compassion.
I'd like for us, as members of the
Swarthmore community and as citizens of
the world, to really examine the worldthat
we're pushing ourselves into. We don't like
to think about tangible resources, so we
think about intangible ones; but those intangible resources, like capital, are so cold
and obtuse in their logic that a demonic
toddler could work it out. Example: "Hi,
demonic toddler, does Mommy or Daddy
give you more cookies? Do you love
Mommy or Daddy more?" The answer, of
course, is simple enough in utilitarian
terms, yet I certainly don't want myfuture
kids to think like that. Isn't that, though,
the world toward which we are heading?

Keeping exotic pets too dangerous
By Melissa Bedsole
The Battalion (Texas A&M Univ.)

(U-WIRE)
Jayton and Cheyenne are
both delightful four-year-olds with two
arms and two legs (sort of). But that is
about where their similarities end. Cheyenne weighs nearly 400 pounds and walks
on both her arms and legs which is normal for a Bengal tiger. Jayton Tidwell
weighs less than 50 pounds and, for a few
hours, recently was missing one of those
arms. Jayton's right limb was missing after he was mauled by Cheyenne.
Horrible? Absolutely. But the real
shocker is how this awful fate befell poor
Jayton. He was not strolling through the
jungle, nor did he cross over the iron bar
barriers at the zoo. Jayton was simply
spending the day at his uncle, Larry
Tidwell's house, where the tiger was kept
as a pet. And when little Jayton reached
in the cage to touch this "pet," the tiger
ripped off his arm just above the elbow.
Thankfully, Jayton Tidwell is recovering in good condition after undergoing
hours of surgery to reattach his arm. But
this is a lesson that no child (or adult, for
that matter) should ever have to learn in
such a way. This is not the first time an
exotic pet has endangered the life of a
human, and this needs to be stopped.
The idea that these animals are suitable
pets may seem ludicrous, but there are
many people fighting for the right to house
them. The National Alternative Pet Association (NAPA) actively works toward its
mission to "promote responsible private
and commercial ownership of exotic animals of all species." This is a fine idea,
but no matter how responsible Larry may
have been, his tiger still attacked Jayton.
The problems with this particular situation are endless. The little boy should
have never been left alone in the vicinity
of the tiger. Jayton is four years old he
should not be left alone with much of anything, and to leave him anywhere near a
400-pound tiger shows complete negligence and irresponsibility on the part of
the uncle. Second, the tiger should have
had a better cage.

Many people support me naicuious iaea
that these "pets" are just as acceptable as
any other, as long as they are in a cage.
Well, someone needs to get to work making better cages than the chain link fence
that separated Jayton and Cheyenne, because obviously it did not separate them
enough. Every aspect of the situation is
ridiculous, but above all that tiger should
not havebeen there in the first place. Zoos
were created to display animals that are
not meant to be pets, so they can be safely
observed. Why aren't dogs and cats and
small goldfish at the zoo? Because they
are the animals meant to be in homes.
There are probably tons of people out
there today with exotic pets roaming
around their houses and yards who have
never had any problems. And Cheyenne
was described as "a really nice and passive animal" by one of Larry's neighbors.
But Cheyenne mauled this little boy and
endangered his life. NAPA claims that
people against their beloved pets "often
blow isolated incidents out of proportion
or treat those with exotic pets like criminals."
One freak accident is quite enough but
according to Robert E. Armstrong, a
former chief of a health department's animal control bureau, these "isolated incidents" are not rare. In an article in the
Houston Chronicle, Armstrong recounted

a tale where a little girl received a large
head wound after being attacked by a lion
at a flea market. Armstrong further described how a young boy was attacked a
few years ago by a lion. These "accidents"
should not be blamed on the inexperience
of these innocent children, either. There
was an animal handlerkilled by a tiger he
was working with at theHouston Zoo. This
he still died.
man had tiger experience
Viewing recent events as "unavoidable
accidents" is simply an act of denial that
will only succeed in allowing such a
tragic incident to occur again in the future. There need to be ramifications for
the confused citizens who somehow believe that these pets are not dangerous
to the people around them. Little boy's
arms are not meant to be pulled off and
put back on. Tigers are not meant to be
kept in small confined cages. Cheyenne
and Jayton were both put in a very unfair situation, and neither one of them
should have been expected to act any dif-

ferently.

Every owner who keeps one of these
exotic pets is at fault for the injustice in
these recent events, and they are exactly
the ones pointing the finger at every other
aspect of the situation. That is just fine
for now. They can point the finger at
whomever they want, at least until their
perfect pet bites it off!

Pair off now
As I can see by the medley of human
shapes basking on Parrish beach in various and scandalous states of undress, naked weather (not my term) seems to now
be firmly ensconced. And as men's
thoughts turn to fancy, and I split another infinitive, I am reminded of the
Quaker matchbox statistic, claiming that
a tenth of students end up together,
which was once astutely challenged by
someone in my seminar, who asked
whether that meant that a tenth of students are couples or whether one-tenth
really was two-tenths because a couple
is necessarily composed of two students,
so if we say one-tenth married another
student, we really mean two-tenths have.
This is the kind of thing you really learn
in seminars.
But what is the causal factor here? As
the same person who coined the term "naked weather" professed, the likelihood of
arriving and departing our kremlin emotionally unchanged seems near to that of
the Oberlin football team competing for
the Division 111 championship next year.
This, in itself, need not be a bad thing. But
if we are so warped by the experience as
to no longer be able to associate with someone outside mundus Swarthmoreensis,
this is a problem.

First you pick your room, and
then you pick your mate.
You notice that they never point to the
wonderful public speakers or commentators that hail from these hallowed halls.
We produce recluses like Michener and
futile campaigners like Dukakis. Intellectuals are who we are. Which, of course,
every young boy dreams of becoming
immediately after his fascination with
growing up to be a fire engine.
Are our dreams and desires so different
from thoseof other college students? They,
too, must complain about cafeteria food,
occasionally study, and engage in inappropriate displays of affection in full view of
fifty or sixty people. To quote another famous American, can't we all just get along?
But maybe we are different; perhaps my
interlocutor was right. In that case, I suggest we simply pair off now. It'll be easier
in the long run. We can do it at the same
time as the upcoming housing lottery. First
you pick your room, and then you pick your
mate. Talk about pressure to get a good
number. If you don't like Myrt Westphal
now, wait until after this lottery. And I
thought one year in Willets was bad.
This would also enormously change
Robin Mamlet's job. You would have to
include measurements in your application. Special interests would take on a
whole new meaning: "I enjoy quiet walks
on the beach, foreign films, and rabbit
pornography." We could wear sandwich
boards around campus so everyone would
have an idea of the kind of person we're
looking for: "LIKES: the occult, eating in
the small room, verbal sparring; DISLIKES: smokers, men who are selfish in
bed, inane columns."
If you'll excuse me, I have a proposal to
write up. Roommates could take on a
whole new meaning.

The completed Mullan Tennis Center represents the realization of a "dream" that
the athletic department has had for the past 12 or 14 years, Williams said. The first
step toward turning this dream into reality occurred in 1997 when the college administration discussed the idea of a new tennis and fitness center with both Mullan
and Kohlberg, according to Vice President for Facilities and Planning Larry Schall.
Kohlberg, who has financed other major Swarthmore projects, said his own love
of tennis and the sport's strong tradition at the college inspired him to support the
Mullan Tennis Center. He finds tennis particularly well-suited to Swarthmore's environment because it is a team sport that does not require many players and also
has an important "cerebral" component.
For Kohlberg, giving Mullan's name to the new facility was a natural choice to
make. "Mullan has been a wonderfulattribute for Swarthmore... not just as a coach,
but as a man and mentor taking in all that should be part of tennis, including sportsmanship, sensitivity and decency," Kohlberg said.
"Mr. Kohlberg names things after people he likes and respects," Mullan explained.
While calling the decision to name the tennis center after himself a "great honor,"
Mullan did not wish to dwell on this aspect of his connection to the new facility. "It's
nice to have a building named after a coach; it justhappens to be me," he said.
Designed and constructed by Kimball Design-Build Group, the Mullan Tennis
Center will open over a year-and-a-half after the original completion date. Problems
keeping the project within a $2.5 million target budget postponed the ground breaking until June 1999, according to the February 3 issue of The Phoenix. The construction proceeded more slowly than planned because of both the difficulty of building
on a former college dump site and the unexpected discovery of an underground
water source. Schall said the latest delay of approximately two weeks resulted from
snow covering the ground for a month, as well as from a late delivery by the fitness
equipment company.
Despite these setbacks, Schall said he is "totally pleased" with the project's outcome.
"I'm glad it's finally done," said Kohlberg, who will be present for a dedication of
the Mullan Tennis Center on April 29. "I hope it will be used and liked by the college."
Williams has little doubt that the college community will take full advantage of
the new facility. "I expect that it will be one of the most popular places on campus, if
not the most popular place on campus," Williams said.
Enthusiastic responses from students provide support for Williams's prediction.
"We've been really, really looking forward to [the Mullan Tennis Center] for a
long time," said John Thomas 'O2, a member of the men's tennis team. Both he and
Jennifer Pao 'Ol, captain of the women's tennis team, said they were "excited" about
having the chance to use the new facility.
But the opening of the Mullan Tennis Center is eagerly anticipated by non-tennis
players as well.
"A number of athletes are very thrilled [about the facility]," said Kristen English
'Ol, a member of the women's field hockey, basketballand lacrosse teams. "It's quite
impressive compared to what we've had in the past."
Summing up the significance of the Mullan Tennis Center, Williams expressed a
similar sentiment. "This is a giant step forward in providing a facility that will meet
the needs of students," he said.
The hours of the Mullan Tennis Center are from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Monday
through Thursday, from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Friday, from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
on Saturday andfrom 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Sunday. Because thefacility does not
have the size or resources necessary to accommodate users outside the college, it
will be open only to Swarthmore faculty, staff and students. To enforce this policy,
Swarthmore IDs will be checked at the door.

College announces new strategy
to better milk rich, guilty alumni
By A. Q. Flemacher
Not A Real Person

The view from the upper reaches of Parrish will be radically changed with the new parking lot

College to pave Parrish Beach
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Needs A Haircut
The college administrationannounced
yesterday that it was finally giving in to
student demands for additional parking
spaces. Board of Managers approval is
expected, albeit narrowly, for a controversial plan that would build a student
parking lot on Parrish Beach.
The plan shifts $60.5 million of the
current capital campaign from a
project to renovate the aging DuPont
science center toward the parking lot.
Student Council co-chair Jordan
Brackett 'Ol, an outspoken advocate of
increased parking, said the council finally managed to convince the administration of student desire for more parking when it tried a new line of argument.
"What we basically told them,"
Brackett said, "was that Swarthmore's
parking facilities were woefully inadequate compared to other colleges."
Vice President for Finance and Planning Paul Aslanian agreed. Although he
was not allowed to share the actual confidential COFHE data with a Phoenix
reporter, he said Swarthmore's parking
facilities were rated far lower than those
of comparable four-year institutions,
and that the administration was worried
that prospective students were not accepting offers of admission because of
the inadequacy of student parking.
"[Dean of Residential Life] Myrt
[Westphal] told me we actually had six
empty beds during the fall semester,"
Aslanian said. "According to COFHE
projections, a parking lot would have
attracted another six freshmen to
Swarthmore and away from Institution
No. 3. We need to build this parking lot
so that we can maximize our dormitory
resources."
VicePresident for Facilities and Services Larry Schall said that once the
decision was made to build a parking
lot, he quickly narrowed the choice of
location to the beach. "No other location on campus offered enough space
to satisfy student demand for parking
spaces," he said.
Because the college had already
hired architect Margaret Helfand and
three other architecture firms to work
on the DuPont project, President Al
Bloom said their contract would instead cover the parking lot.

Helfand, who also helped design

Kohlberg, said that the parking lot
would be paved with asphalt containing similar stone to that used in the construction of Parrish. "We're currently
in negotiations to open up a quarry in
order to get the exact match of stone,"
she said, adding that the quality of the
stone accounts for much of the $60.5
million cost.
Bloom, when asked if any of the $60.5
million would be used for creating additional student space, replied that the
parking lot would be the extent of the
college's effort in that area. But after a
reporter refused him permission to
verify how ethically intelligent his quotes
sounded, Bloom relented and promised
that he wouldask that his personal bathroom be converted to student space.
Phoenix columnist and Angry HalfAsian Mimi Hanaoka 'Ol was seen yelling and screaming last night. Hanaoka
was reportedly not mad over the
college's decision to pave the beach,
which she saw as a way to stave off development of a hotel in the Ville. Rather,
she said as she began her 500-word diatribe for this week's newspaper, her
complaint was with the college's decision to hire the same survey firm that
"f—ed up the paths" last summer.
Hanaoka said she expected students to
return to campus with their cars in the
fall and not be able to park thembecause
the parking lot was discovered at that
last minute to not be Americans with
Disabilities Act-compliant.
Scott Arboretum intern Allison
Necaise was also up in arms over the
decision, promptly sending out five
reserved-students e-mail messages
urging students to bring the trees along
Magill Walk to the arboretum building
for transplantation. Citing the need to
preserve such an important element of
the college's heritage, Necaise offered
prizes to the students whose dorm
rooms contained the most potted trees.
Bloom announced that he anticipated
the expensive parking lot would ultimately be a moneymaker for the college, because the few extra spots available after all the student spaces had
been allocated could be rented to
SEPTA commuters for exorbitant fees.
Bloom proposed that the extra revenue
from the parking couldbe used to renovate DuPont, one brick at a time.

President Alfred H. Bloom today announced that the college is seeking to meet
the ambitious goals of the current capital
campaign by resurrecting the practice of
selling indulgences, last practiced widely
by the Catholic Church in the era before
the Protestant Reformation.
"In recent years, the College has become increasingly adept at raising large
amounts of funds from alumni, who are
often wracked with self-doubtand worries
of eternal damnation," said Bloom. "The
liberal values they learned here have now
come back to haunt them in their great
material success, causing them to contribute huge sums to theCollege in an attempt
to unburden their consciences."
But according to Dan West, Vice President of Development, Alumni and Public
Relations, this was not enough for many
wealthy but conflicted Swarthmore graduates. They remained unsure of theirplace
in the elect despite the material riches
they have achieved in this life and their
massive annual gifts to the College
($517,461 in fiscal year 1999 alone from
the Board of Managers).
"Their principal concern was that they

would still burn in hell," said Bloom. "This
new innovation in planned giving will
meet unsatisfied demand for assurances
that they will not be condemned to a fiery
inferno for all time."
According to West, this innovation has
come just in time for the current capital
campaign, which seeks to fund a new Science Center, dorm and other major projects.
"Students demand all this expensive
crap, but they can't pay for it," said West.
"You try raising $l6O million with cheap
alumni nickel and diming you every step
of the way."
West believes the indulgence campaign
is a breakthrough that will make the campaign wildly successful.
"If Jerome Kohlberg can stay out of hell,
well shit, I can have a blank check we
don't even need to wait until he kicks it.
Who cares that he made all his money
buying up companies and firing everybody, or that he's under federal indictment
for illegal campaign contributions? He
doesn't look like a sinner to me."
Professor Jerry Frost of the Religion
Department countered that this assurance
is by no means a guarantee. "I'll be honest with you these alumni are in trouble."
The Vatican declined to respond to repeated requests for comment.

Alien at Swat demands full-time
extraterrestial dean, Wharton RA
By Dan Korobkin
Phoenix Laugh
Claiming that there is currently no one
in the administration representing her
interests, the Alien at Swat 'O3 has demanded that Swarthmore hire a full-time
extraterrestrial dean. The Alien voiced
her concerns at the open mic session of a
Student Council meeting this Tuesday.
At the meeting, the Alien sparked discussion on what Student Council member
Matt Schwartz 'Ol described as "far and
away the strangest issue" SC has dealt
with this semester. "What are you people
going to demand next, a multicultural
dean?" Schwartz railed, apparently unaware that a multicultural dean position
was being seriously considered.
"As a student from another planet, I have
special needs that I feel are not being addressed," theAlien told Student Council. "An

extraterrestrialdean could change all that."
The Alien was accompanied by BoHee
Yoon 'Ol, a Worth RA whois concerned that
Wharton dormitory, which houses 20 percent of all freshmen, does not have an extraterrestrial RA. "The fact that there are
no Wharton RAs in AB or EF with ET origins is not OK," Yoon said, confusing Student Council with her overuse ofacronyms.
Council member Nick Attanasio 'OO
raised the possibility that there simply are
no alien RAs. Yoon countered by telling
Attanasio to go to hell.
Yoon had already spoke before Student
Council earlier this month, demanding
that Wharton have at least one RA of color.
Ultimately, Student Council drafted a letter to the deans and President Al Bloom
expressing concern over the lack of alien
representation. Asked if she was satisfied
with the steps SC was taking on the issue,
the Alien responded, "Klaatu baradanikto."

Look

at what

the

CAT

Chan Marshall aka Cat
Power will make you cry

dragged
in.
[

by Suzanne Wu

]

Her name is Chan Marshall. Sometimes her name is Cat Power. And
sometimes the two intersect, like at a
recent Rolling Stone immortalized
New York show, when Cat Power left
the stage and starting singing shakily
face-down on the floor while fans tried
to comfort her.
Cat Power's songs have provoked
negative physical response from me.
They give me an uncomfortable lump
in my throat and a churn in my stomach and I run to the bathroom and kneel
in front of the toilet and stick my fingers down my throat to make the feeling go away. And then I come back and
listen to the haunting, delicate drone of
her melancholy music over and over
again anyways. It is not happy music, it is
not endearingly cute, it has been said that
you will never be able to explain Cat Power
to your friends.
I was listening to "Moon Pix," Cat Power's
1998 release with a friend once, and she asked
me, "Where's the poppy riff?" There isn't one,
and when you most expect Cat Power's fragile
voice to raise, it doesn't. Six songs on "Moon Pix"
were borne out of a nightmare. This music cannot
be ignored; I try to study to Cat Power and instead
just find myself staring out the window, my mind
cleared of all discernible thoughts by the subtle hypnosis of her songs and that voice.
I can't get a finger on her. One imagines Chan Marshall as
the girl who is the life of the party, envied by everybody else,
who then goes home by herself, sits down in a corner and cries.
But be forewarned. Cat Power becomes who you want her to
be; her songs are so intensely personal, even when they're
covers, like on her latest album "The Covers Record," that
you can't help but create an identity for Chan that suits your
reaction to her music.
The Anomoanon will open for Cat Power at 10 p.m. this Friday in Olde Club.

A showcase for Falun Gong

Deirdre Flint: quirky, witty
Folk singer entertains with creative imagery
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff

Alum Matt Kutolowski, foreground, and Sid Ganesan practice for a Sunday event exploring
Falun Gong, a system of exercises and teachings said to deeply transform the body and
mind and was outlawed in China last July. Speakers include alumni, students and others who
were persecuted and detained in China for practicing Falun Gong.The event will be held
from 2:30-5 p.m. in Bond.To reserve seats, contact Emily Myers at x5544 before April I.

Clever and quirky, local Philadelphia
folk singer Deirdre Flint makes a
strong first impression with her debut
album, "The Shuffleboard Queens."
Whether it's belly-dancing, being
shortchanged by the "boob fairy," homicidal bridesmaids or more mundane
topics Flint is singing about, she is able
to look at things with a candid and eccentric zest that sets her apart from
your normal folkie. Flint will remind
you of that girl in your high school
class who talked non-stop, saw things
from a crazy perspective and made
you laugh whether you understood
what she was talking about or not.
It's almost difficult to single out a
single song or section to capture Flint's
creative wit within her lyrics. "We Fit
Right," "The Bridesmaid Dress Song,"
"The Boob Fairy" and "Fishlands" are,
in my opinion, the best tracks "The
Shuffleboard Queens" has to offer.
They represent Flint at her best, witty
with lots of flair at just the right pace.
Without a doubt the songwriting is
the best part of this album, and Flint's
delivery brings the lyrics to life. When
she goes away from witty and meandering lyrics, she falls a bit flat.
Fortunately, Flint doesn't do that
very often. Personally, I found her 'Bos
satire of a Bruce Springsteen song
about an eccentric bowl of fish quite
amusing. In the track, "Fishlands"
draws cleverly from Springsteen's
"The River," even imitating the Boss'
voice just enough to be funny. "The
Boob Fairy," a song you would think
would be about breasts and, well, is
nearly entirely about breasts, related
strangely to me. Nearly every song
entertains you, be it with wit, sarcasm,
odd imagery or an entirely offbeat way
of looking at things.
"The Shuffleboard Queens" has its
weaknesses. Like many folk singers,
Flint has a distinctive and pleasant
voice, but it isn't diva forceful. Most
of the time, her lyrics more than cancel that fact out. Sometimes, like in the

tracks "Tinman" and "Marrow of My

Bone," you wish she had just a little
more oomph. Most of the time, the

instrumentals are out of the way, which
allows Flint to strut her own stuff. Occasionally, they detract from Flint, a tad
annoying with an unoriginal feel. Also,
sometimesFlint tries to cram too many
words in at one time.
Nevertheless, the plusses far outweigh the minuses, and it's an album I
would highly recommend to folk music fans. While her voice isn't quite as
refined as popular folkie Dar Williams,
Flint is a similar artist stylistically.
Those who can't get enough of Dar
should definitely give Flint a chance.
Already selling on the top 10 on some
web sites, Flint is a good bet to emerge
as one of the more popular f olksingers,
if that isn't an oxymoron. She's also a
local, playing frequently in clubs in and
around Philadelphia. If you can't catch
her in concert, make sure you at least
check out the CD. "The Shuffleboard
Queens" doubles as both pleasant background music and something to make
you alternately smile and laugh hysterically.

SAO sponsors events to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month
By Gloria Chan and Judy Ha
For The Phoenix
In celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, the Swarthmore
Asian Organization (SAO) is hosting a series of events in the next several weeks
that celebrate Asian culture, history and
community. The tradition, which became
nationally recognized in 1992, is running
concurrent to other Asian Pacific American celebrations at universities and other
organizations around the country.
Until April 15, the fourth floor of
McCabe Library will host the APA Heritage Month display of childhood cultural
artifacts representative of several Asian
cultural heritages, "Memories of an Asian/
Asian American Childhood."
Two of the main events in the upcoming weeks are performances by the Chinese Folk Dance Company and Mohan
Sikka. The CFDC has performed at the
Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., at
well-known cultural festivals across the
nation and at other institutions of higher
learning. The CFDC is based at the New
York Chinese Cultural Center, which also
houses a dance school with professional
teachers from mainland China. South

Asian artist Mohan Sikka is an avantgarde spoken word artist from New York
City. Through his cutting-edge work and
innovative approach, he explores complex
issues of identity on many levels.
Also in April is a percussion and dance
performance, staged by members of the
Swarthmore community, of the Gamelan
Semara Santi. The word Gamelan, derived
from a Javanese term for striking a percussion instrument, refers collectively to
a set of musical instruments and to the
people who play them. The Balinese music combines the tones of such instruments as the gong and the xylophone and
is often played by ear and by touch.
SAO is co-sponsoring a series of educational lectures and discussions to present
some of the current intellectual discourses on the Asian community and to
raise awareness of Asian Pacific American issues in the Swarthmore community.
One of these events is an open SAO talk
on family history. A panel of invited Asian
Pacific andAsian American students, faculty and administrators will give their
personal and ancestral narratives including immigration experiences from the
motherlands and stories of assimilation.
One member on the panel will be talking

about her father's history as a young boy
growing up during French colonization in
Vietnam. Other possible narratives include family histories during China's Cultural Revolution, the independence movement in India, and the American Civil
Rights Movement.
Mark Chiang, an English literature professor and junior faculty member in the
UPenn Asian-American Studies program,
will visit for a lecture sponsored by the
Curricular Change Working Group. Kevin
Kumashiro, theMinority-Scholar-in-Residence in the Education Department, will
lead a faculty dinner lecture called "Queer
Identity in Asian America."
The Genevieve Lee event is a screening of the movie "A Place of Rage" by acclaimed South Asian filmmaker Pratibha
Parmar, who will also give a lecture entitled "The Colour of Britain: Culture,
Identity, and Artistic Practice." Later that
evening, she will conclude the event with
a screening and discussion of "Khush" and
"The Righteous Babes." All events are
sponsored by the Genevieve Lee Memorial Fund and Media Studies.
Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American monk ordained in Sri Lanka for 30 years, will
present a lecture on "The Contemporary

Relevance of Buddhism."
In addition to the series of cultural and
educational events, there will also be various social events. This Saturday at Paces,
many talented student chefs are preparing a meal that includes pork spring rolls,
scallion fried bread, spicy pad Thai, bun
thit nuong (a Vietnamese dish), kheer (Indian rice pudding) and jiggly grass jelly.

On missed connections and 'Optic Nerve'

•

There was this red-headed girl I had a
wicked crush on all summer who worked
at Mel's Diner.
I saw "Run Lola Run" with her, and she
made me so nervous with her spunkiness
that I would just stare at her tousling her
hair, as I fumbled for yet another cigarette
and said unintelligible bland things. She
made me want to scream, "Dammit, I'm
sorry for my awkwardness, just give me
a chance not to be slightly awestruck and
be
intimidated by you and I promise I'llwow
I'll
and
witty
collected
and
and
poised
you. I promise." But I never got that
chance.
The little red-headed girl in my pathetic
Charlie Brown existence is now dating
Adrian Tomine, the artist and writer of
"Optic Nerve." I've been wanting to write
about this comic for some time now, but
I'm torn between the desire to impress
that girl, to dazzle her with my writing
skill, to make her happy, and this sort of
foolish hatred of Adrian. I can't quite pinpoint my intentions for this column. I
mean, its a great comic, don't get me
wrong, but out of jealousy, I almost don't
want you to read it. Pure unrestrained jeal-

ousy. Tomine is young and successful and
he also got the girl, so I hate him.
The whole situation is almost ironic, I
suppose. The reason why "Optic Nerve"
is so wonderful is that it talksabout missed
connections and the feeling that you just
can't relate to anybody. And before he
became a peripheral part of my life I believed that Adrian understood; that there
was someone else out there who had odd
allergies and was unable to speak to people
and was sort of cynically self-doomed to
be single forever.
At least that's the way his characters
were; they were always the sort of folk
who watched other people talk. Abig criticism of Tomine's work is that the dialogue
is stilted. But that was exactly what made
"Optic Nerve" so charming for me and so
endearing. The spastic, stilted language
and the characters' inabilities to articulate emotion are both sadly real. Dan
Clowes, whose work "Optic Nerve" has often been compared to, once commented
that Tomine was not a "writer, he's a col-

Juliet' rendition a disgrace

By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff

Jet Li

,*

He's in theair, feet cycling as he does
a circular double-flip that allows him
to boot each of a dozen contenders in
the face within the span of 10 seconds.
Then he's on his feet again, faced with
the reality of these dozen men and their
gats.
Thus begins the newest rendition ot
a truly classic love story. A modernized
version of "Romeo and Juliet," this
movie, which likens a Chinese crime
family's head-to-head battle with the African-American mafia in Los Angeles
to the dispute between the Capulets and
the Montagues, ends up a disgrace to
the original. It's like Jackie Chan trying to work his way into "William
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet." The
result of a piss-poor plotline, virtually
nonexistent dialogue, and actors who
can't, well, act, "Romeo Must Die"
doesn't quite pan out.
Jet Li's Han, who is, I guess, filling in
for Romeo, escapes from the pits of a
Chinese prison to meet his father in
America, where he learns his younger
brother has been murdered in gang-rehis
lated activity. Determined to avenge
family, Han sets out to destroy the black
clan headed by Isaak O'Day, who he's
convinced is responsible. In the midst
of blowing up buildings and displaying
some seriously impressive karate
moves, Han encounters Trish, the
daughter of the man he loathes (this
film's Juliet, played by the illustrious
Aaliyah) and falls wildly in love.
And that's about all the plot entails.
If not; for the tediously extensive fight
scenes, the movie would never have
filled a full two hours. Throughout
"Romeo Must Die," the common stereotypes of American minority cultures
are emphasized most abominably. It's

the gun-toting, ball-playing, shit-talking
bad ass black guys against the quiet, demure, secretly powerful zen gods... and
it's gross. Not a single character embodies anything outside of the ultra-black or
ultra-Asian culture he represents. This
serious racial clash is, I suppose, what
makes the interaction between Han and
Trish at all similar to that between the
original star-crossed lovers, but the
method of creating the two polarized societies leaves much to be desired. Okay,
so I'm not asking for total political correctness, but, for the love of God, they
could have had some tact.
Even the action, which might have
been the show's saving grace, lagged.
The action scenes, for one, lasted way
too long. The camera spent an inordinate
amount of time zoomed in on Li's rapidly kicking feet, so much so that the
scenes lost their appeal and the audience
found themselves yawning, waiting for
Aaliyah to step in and break up the latest fight. In addition to simply taking too
much time, the scenes were repulsively
corny. My personal favorite pits Li
against a gang of six bulky, Uzi-toting
attackers. He wards them off with a fire
hose. That's right, a fire hose.
At best, "Romeo Must Die" makes for
a good veg-out flick, something worth
renting to watch half-heartedly at 2 in
the morning with a bunch of not-so sober friends or to doze off to late at night
after a long week of classes. At worst,
it's a pathetic, stereotypical attempt to
derive meaning (and link it to the work
of one of the best playwrights ofall time)
from a dialogue comprised of single-sentence lines and a cast comprised of scads
of untalented actors, one wannabe diva,
and one kung fu kid. Still, I can't say I
walked away completely unaffected. I do
know now that I ought never underestimate the power of a high-pressure
stream of H2O.

The story of a group of astronauts and their hurried Mars Recovery mission, this sci-fi/

Garnet Tide schedules Newton Kushner dragged into
Junior Lions for 2000 season alley, beaten silly

By Ted Chan
Pedro Martinez Wannabe

At the urging of Swarthmore's omnipo-

tent alumni, Swarthmore College head

football coach Pete Alvanos reluctantly
added the Newton, Mass., Pop Warner
Junior Lions to his team's 2000 schedule.

The hastily added date was deemed
necessary when it was discovered that
last year's designated cupcake Oberlin
had actually successful recruited a
player, its first in seven years. Oberlin
announced Monday that they had edged
out Notre Dame, Florida State and Texas
A&M for 6'3", 110-pound punter David
Goldmanstein, also known as the "Jewish Ray Guy."
New Oberlin head coach Don Shula indicated that his team would adopt a new
strategy to play to its strengths. "We're
going to scrap this whole offense deal,
move our one good offensive player to
defense and punt on first down. Last
year, 17 Oberlin fumbleliahs and eight
interceptions led to 39 of Swarthmore's
42 points. Eliminate our 'offense' and
we win that game 6-3."
Oberlin's unexpected success in recruiting and potentially lethal new strategy sent the Swarthmore football office
into a tizzy trying to find a new doormat.

After unsuccessful phone calls to Bryn
Mawr and Blaine's Hair and Beauty
School, Alvanos stumbled upon an ad
which indicated that the Newton Junior
Lions were looking for a few tough
teams to add to the schedule. Alvanos
called and immediately the date was
made.
While on the surface the game seems
like a cakewalk, that may not be the case.
Swarthmore has an advantage in speed,
but the Lions feature a dynamic wishbone offense led by 47", 69-pound QB
Andrea "The Steamroller" O'Toole.
"They may be little, but they have lots
of heart," said Alvanos. "TheLions definitely have the potential to pull off a
moral upset."
The alumni, eager to see the football
team revisit the glory days of the 19th
century, seemed pleased by Alvanos' decision. "Wins are wins. The only zeroes
I like to see are the two at the end of my
bottom line," said Neil Austrian '6l.

was found Sunday morning in a dark alley behind Papazian, badly beaten and
suffering from a bruised coccyx and
wounded machismo.
According to Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, Kushner had also apparently suffered repeated blows to the head
from a blunt object "roughly similar in
diameter to a lacrosse stick."
"Those aren't the kind of blows that I
usually get," remarked Kushner, as a large
number of women struggled to muffle
their incredulous laughter. Futher investigation showed that Kushner had also
been paddled by a badminton racket.
The repeated blows with the lacrosse
stick, not discovered until after Kushner
was dragged back to his room and laughed
at thoroughly, discounts the original belief of many that Kushner had merely
"passed out and pissed himself," said
Kushner's roommate, Phoenix Sports Editor and aspiring actress Ted Chan.

hit himself withthe lacrosse stick, but the
severe ass-paddling brings up some suspicion of foul play," said Redgrave.
World-renowned gumshoe and Ville PoliceChief Brian Craig was called in specially
to assist on the case. Craig says he has compiled a list of suspects, but so far has no concrete leads and is hinderedby lack of cooperation from the entire campus.
"I found Carmen Sandiego, I can sure
as hell find out who beat up this little
prick," said Craig confidently.
At last count roughly 95 percent of the
campus was under suspicion, including,
in no particular order, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Kate Nelson-Lee, members of the highly respected Phi Psi Fraternity, groundkeepers, athletic director
Bob "Godfather" Williams and his Ho
Train, the badminton team, the men's basketball team, female sport instructors and
coaches and women.
Kushner meanwhilehas been enjoying his
recuperation, laying in bed and keeping his
arms in shape in anticipation of being well
enough to play in next week'sbaseball game.
Despite the beating, Kushner's disposition unfortunately remained unchanged.
Kushner continues to complain incessantly to anyone who will listen about the
spot of crabgrass in center field that is
the bane of Swarthmore athletics.

Men's tennis defends Women's tennis sweeps Ursinus,
prepares for tough matches ahead
national ranking
By John Leary
For The Phoenix
After wins over Division II
powerhouses Foothill College
and Kutztown University, the
Bandits have dominated the
courts in Division 111 play.
Under conditions windier than
an Oklahoma tornado, the men's
tennis team defeated Washington College on Maryland's Eastern Shore in spite of the absence
of Arun Mohan 'OO. With players
recruited from Germany, Hungary, and Argentina, Washington
College sported a formidable
team of players tuned by years
of junior college match experience.
Although Swarthmore's #1
doubles team of John Leary 'OO
andPeter Schilla 'Ol fell in a tight
match, the Bandit's #2 and #3
doubles teams fought hard to win
the doubles point. At #2 doubles,
Captain Jon Temin 'OO and John
Thomas 'O2, forced to sink to
Washington's level of cursing and
elbowing on changeovers, pulled
out the win in style with immaculate serving and put-away volleys. At #3 doubles, freshman
sensation Jayson Yost and Scott
Grant 'Ol smoked their opponents within 25 minutes.
Having won the doubles point,

the Bandits needed three more
wins to take the match.
Swarthmore's top three singles
players, John Leary, Captain
Temin, and All-American Schilla
all fell in tight matches to players recruited from the depths of
the tennis world.
Leary burned his opponent in
record time. Thomas's opponent
was so upset by the spanking
Thomas administered that he
cracked threerackets during the
match and left the court rather
flustered.
The match was laid on the
shoulders of freshmen Jayson
Yost and Justin Singer, who remained on the court as the Bandits trailed Washington 2-3. Battling from being down 1-5 in the
second set, Yost smoked his opponent with several passing
shots and managed to tie the
score at 6-6 in the second set. Yost
then pulled out the 'heater' and
hit three aces in the tie-breaker
to tie the overall match score at
3-3. Swarthmore won the match
as Justin Singer humiliated his
opponent with third set clinic.
Singer swept the third set.
In their road to nationals, the
Bandits next travel to Massachusetts where they will play highly
rated Williams and Trinity College this weekend.

Ace pitcher leads team to win
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff
Led by a stellar complete game
performance by ace Steve
Farneth 'OO, the Swarthmore
baseball squad dominated
Neumann College 8-4 last Thursday. The rest of their games this
week were cancelled due to inclement weather.
Swarthmore fell behind visiting Neumann 3-0, ceding three
unearned runs early in the first
two innings. After that, Farneth
was nearly untouchable, scattering ten hits and giving up just one
more run to improve his record
to 3-3 for the season.
The offense was led by the
middle infield tandem of SS Rob
Castellucci 'Ol, whodrove in three

runs with a bases clearing double,
and 2B Joe Corso 'O2, whoracked
up a pair ofRBIs. Table-setter Joe
Aleffi 'OO stole two bases.
The team lost to Williams College 19-0 yesterday, bringing its
record to 4-7. Brian Lopez 'OO (3B)
leads the team in hitting with a
.321 average. Aleffi leads the
team in RBIs and is tied withScott
Kushner 'O2 for the team lead in
stolen bases. Kushner has been a
key player, with a .500 on-base
percentage from the leadoff spot.
Farneth has been the anchor for
thepitching staff, pitching nearly
half the team's total innings with
a solid 3.48 ERA.
On Saturday, the team plays a
doubleheader at home against
conference rivals Johns Hopkins
and Muhlenberg.

The Swarthmore women's tennis team extended their conference winning streak with a 9-0
shut out over Ursinus on Saturday. Their record is currently 20 within the Centennial Conference and 2-3 overall.
A slight drizzle did not stop Jen
Pao 'Ol, at #1 singles, who quickly
disposed of her opponent in
straight sets, 6-0, 6-0. At number
two Fran Simonds 'O2 smashed
her way to a 6-0, 6-4 victory.
Laura Swerdlow 'O2 served and
volleyed a quick 6-2, 6-2 win at
#3 singles. At #4 singles, Tanya
Chotibut 'O3 handily defeated her
foe 6-2, 6-1. Jamie Flather 'OO, at
#5 singles, obliterated her adversary 6-0,6-3. At #6 singles, Laura
Brown 'OO won 6-4, 3-6, (7-2).
The doubles teams of Pao/
Swerdlow (8-0), Simonds/
Chotibut (8-2) and Flather/
Katherine Voll 'O3 (8-6) were
equally as successful as the
singles matches. The team appreciated the large turnout of family and friends and hope to see
more people out enjoying the tennis being played.
The team is ready for a great
season, awaiting the warm
weather as well as the opening of
the new Mullan Tennis Center on
April 3. They played away at
Johns Hopkins yesterday, but
results were not available at
presstime. On Saturday they play
at Franklin and Marshall. F&M
has won the Centennial Conference title for the last three years,
but the Garnet ladies hope to reverse this trend. Swarthmore's
next home match is Monday
against Bryn Mawr.

Warmothers battle at tourney
By AlyssaTimin and
PaulWulfsberg
For The Phoenix
Excluding nationals in Boise,
Idahothis May, this weekend was
the most competitive tournament
of the season for the Warmothers.
Held in Wilmington, North Carolina, "Easterns" challenged the
women like no other tourney so
far this year.
They went 2-4, destroying Duke
13-4 and upsetting the top-seeded
Tufts 11-9. They lost 11-9 to the
University of Georgia, 13-6
against UNC-Wilmington, who
won the tournament, 14-9 to San
Diego, and 10-8 to Brown in the
semifinals, finally claiming
fourth place, despite being the
last seed out of the eight teams.
The Duke victory was especially sweet since the North
Carolina team was the one that
defeated the Warmothers at
their earlier tournament in
Georgia. Team captain Jenny
Hoedeman 'Ol commended Sara
Gravelin 'O2 for playing spectacular defense against one of
Tufts' top players, and she called
Sanya Carleyolsen 'O3 "money"

for great all-around play both
Saturday and Sunday.
Hoedeman professed her delight at entering the tournament
underestimated and surprising
their opponents by "really making them work.
"Our rookies rose to the occasion," she continued, "and we're
beginning to get people to notice
us."
Meanwhile, on Saturday, the
Earthworms competed in
"Queen's Cup" at Rutgers. They
went 3-2, finishing fourth out of
10 teams. They beat SUNYBinghamton 13-5, going up an
impressive 7-0 in the first half.
Similarly, the men embarrassed
the U Penn B-team, defeating
them 13-2.
The taller of Princeton's two
teams (termed, appropriately,
Princeton-Tall) won 13-8, and
Swat claimed a 9-7 victory over a
previously undefeated New Jersey club team. In the semifinals,
the 'Worms narrowly lost to
Haverford 13-11, despite an impressive rally from a 5-0 deficit.
As always, the Earthworms
were dominating against zonestyle offenses and defenses, us-

ing the deadly duo of Vincent
Pallaver 'OO and John Anderson
'O3 to penetrate deep inside all
opposing zones.
There were a number of highlights and points of interest from
the Queen's Cup, not least among
them discovering the long-lost
twin of the Swarming Earthworms' Eric Johnson 'O3, playing
on the Princeton-Tall team.
This bizarro EJ was not among
Princeton-Tail's better players,
but his very presence wrought
fear in the hearts of the 'Worms.
Several players named Bailey led
A Clockwork Grange,Princeton's
team, ranked 13th in the nation.
Brandon Silverman 'O2 applauded Swarthmore's performance Saturday, specifically
mentioning the stellar defense of
Galen O'Toole 'O2 and the Mule 'O3
against the hated Haverfordians.
He also praised the skills ofall the
freshmen at the tournament, led
by their arm banded captain and
master Ben-Ben Hamilton 'O3.
This weekend the Earthworms
and Warmothers are taking a
three-hour road trip to Penn State
for "Spring Phling," a light-spirited annual tournament.

First outdoor meet a success
By Marc Jeuland and
Donald Nguyen

IForThe Phoenix

Despite a two-week hiatus
from the wonders of JambaJuice
Smoothies and California splendor, the Swarthmore track and
field teams performed well in a
relaxed atmosphere here this
past Saturday. The visiting
schools were all conference rivals: Franklin and Marshall,
Ursinus, and Bryn Mawr. What
resulted was a strong effort for
Swat, which bodes well for the
remainder of the season. Many
new athletes participated, bolstering the size and spirit of the
team.

The most noteworthy results
on the men's side were in the
sprints and the throws. Keith
Gilmore 'Ol started to show his
form in the 400 meters, and then
followed with terrific performances in the 200 and the 1600
relay. He anchored the winning
team in that event, and took second in the other two (with seasonbest timesof 51.09 and 23.10 seconds). Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 ran his
best 400 of the year, finishing in

third with a time of 52.23, and
Ariss Derhovanessian 'OO followed closely in 52.46.
In the throws, Ed Albers 'O2
finished second in the discus and
the shot (34.80 and 12.20 meters,
respectively). Randy Keim 'O2
took second in the javelin (43.99
meters), and Matt Rapoza was
third in the shot (11.43 meters).
Finally, Steve Dawson 'OO won
the high jump on a single attempt, Marc Jeuland 'Ol won the
1500 (4:05.03), Jeff Doyon 'OO
took second in the 1500 (4:10.04),
and Donald Nguyen 'O3 was second in the 5000 (17:56.0).
On the women's side, Clara
Fuchsman 'Ol started things off
well with a 9.89 meter throw in
the shot, earning second place,
and Desiree Peterkin 'OO won the
triple and long jumps. Imo Akpan
'O2 continued to run blazing
times, with a 12.70 in the 100meter dash and a 27.72 in the 200,
taking first and second. She also
led off the victorious 1600 relay
with a strong leg. Jessica
Rickabaugh 'O2 came in third in
the high jump (4'8"). In the distance events, Joko Agunloye 'Ol
and Sarah Jay 'Ol finished 1-2, in

season's best times of 4:54.00 and
4:56.08. Karen Lloyd 'OO won the
3K in 11:27.80. Christen Lungren
'O2 ran an amazing 800 after a
short recovery from the 1500,
taking third in 2:34.0.
The new members of the team
who performed this past weekend promise to add a new dimension this season. Nguyen has recovered from his back trauma,
which hospitalized him for
months, during which he was
forced to perform strange exercises which earned him jeers
from his friends on the team.
Emily Gray 'O2 has impressed
everyone with a strong work
ethic. Josh Bloom 'OO, equipped
with antidotes against bee stings,
and Joe Makin 'O3, overflowing
with philosophical nonsense,
have returned from the isolation
of too much studying to enjoy the
chirping birds heard on long distance runs. Albers and Keim
bring a sense of humor along
with much talent in heaving
heavy throwing implements.
Next weekend Swat will be in
action at Widener for a quad
meet with Haverford, Ursinus,
and Widener.

Illegit excuses

Tide gives a Leaders of the pack
clinic, 23-0,
to Monarchs
By Mike Lloyd
For The Phoenix
The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team
continued its best start since 1984 with two
more wins last week to bring its record to
5-0. Last Wednesday the Tide beat Villa
Julie College 9-5 and thenblanked King's
College 23-0 on Saturday afternoon.
On Saturday the team put on two clinics. The first clinic was for youth players
r in the area and the second was for the
King's College Men's team. The Garnet
Tide controlled every aspect of the game
to cruise to a 23-0 win.
Sig Rydquist 'OO and CJ Riley 'Ol combined to stop every Monarch shot on goal
for the first shutout of the season in the
Centennial Conference. Both Rydquist
and Riley made four saves.
Thirteen different players made it into
the scoring book with Dingfield, Court,
andAtkins leading the way with seven, six,
and six points respectively. Charles
Fischette 'Ol and Jason Choi 'O2 led the
defense with five groundballs each. Attacker Toby Patterson 'O2 also had an exceptional game with two goals and two
breathtaking assists.
The Garnet Tide traveled to Baltimore
last Wednesday to take on the Villa Julie
Mustangs, after the game was delayed due
to rain last Tuesday. After a goal by the
Mustangs, Mark Dingfield 'Ol opened the
scoring for Swarthmore with back to back
goals in the first quarter. Further goals
by Than Court 'O3 and Blake Atkins 'O2
gave Swarthmore a 4-1 lead going into
halftime and left the Villa Julieteam reeling.
The second half opened up with a break
for the Garnet Tide only seconds after
play resumed. After cleanly winning the
faceoff, Atkins brought the ball down the
field on a fast break and attempted a pass
to a cutting Dingfield. However, the pass
missed its target and went past Dingfield
and into the goal. Villa Julie countered
with a goal at 8:36 of the third to make the
score 5-2. However, the Villa Julie team
was demoralized by a goal from defensive
midfielder general Choi, when Choi
cleared the ball all the way down the field
and fired a shot past the unfortunate
goalie to make the score 6-2. The Mustangs scored one more time in the third,
but never controlled the tempo of the
game thanks to the swarming Swarthmore
defense.
Swarthmore outscored Villa Julie 3-2 in
the fourth with goals by Pat Friel 'O3,
Court and Atkins. The story of the game
was the play of the Garnet defense. Lead
by goalie Rydquist and Captain Tucker
Zengerle 'OO, thedefense allowed only five
goals on 22 shots and killed six out of eight
man down situations against a high powered Mustang offense. Rydquist finished
another fine performance with ten saves.

Farneth pitches
Swat to a win

Inspired by Dr. Ruth's wonderful talk
on Tuesday night, I'm going to give a little
sex talk of my own to the souls who perhaps need it most: NBA players. Names
like Ewing, Bird, Pippen, Kidd, Marbury,
Olajuwon, Payton, Pippen and even the
venerable Isaiah Thomas have fostered
illegitimate children. A Sports Illustrated
article a few years ago named dozens of
athletes, including Shawn Kemp, who at
last check was known to have fathered
nine children to eight mothers.
I'm not saying these guys need to go A.C.
Green style, but they need to be careful.
First off, there's disease. Magic Johnson
should have proved that. Secondly, there's
plenty of seedy women out there more
than willing to raise a NBA player's child
for $30,000 in child support per month.
Maybe if you're making $l5 million a year
right now, that doesn't seem like much, but
wait until Kemp is forty-five, flat broke
and has to pay for seventeen kids to go to
college. And then you have the whole morality thing. I'm no prick right-wing Christian Jerry Falwell saying you shouldn't
slip your fiancee the tongue until after
you've tied the knot, but creating children
you feel no obligation towards caring for
is downright wrong.
And for chrissakes, once you've done
the evil deed, take responsibility for it.
First off is the money. I feel no sympathy
for any one who loses his 23rd gold Lexus
because he has to be pay child support.
But more important is being a father to
your child. Don't make any excuses. Yeah,
the paternity test might have .005 percent
failure. The skank/mother may be ripping
you off. And I know you ain't wannabe no
role model to no one. But unless you're
skinnier than Manute 801, no groupie tore
off your clothes and took advantage of
you. You're responsible for the child, and
he's your blood. Suck it up and spend some
time with the kid. You might find being a
parent and developing a loving relationship better than taking up the next hoochie
shaking her booty at you outside of the
American
Airlines
PNC
Bank
Amazon.com Arena.
Perhaps because it hits close to home,
one of the most irking examples of this is
Celtics great Larry Bird, who has refused
to have any relationship with his daughter. Corrie Bird has a shrine to her father
in her room second only to my collection
of Celtics memorabilia now stowed away
in shame due to the Rick Pitino era. Bird
has denied that she is even his child. One
look at her makes this claim laughable.
Let's face it, Bird and his daughter both
bear a strong resemblance to another bird,
a big, yellow one on Sesame Street. The
least Bird could do for giving her his looks
is suck it up and give the poor kid some
attention. God knows he's made it tough
for any other guys to give it to her.
The Sports Illustrated article a few
years ago was well done, albeit controversial. It showed Khalid Minor, son of then
Celtics guard Greg Minor on the cover,
and discussed that case specifically and
how rampant illegitimacy is in general.
The issue is out there, and the onus is on
the NBA to better prepare players for the
pitfalls that come with money and fame.
I think a suggestion by Dr. Ruth might
prove to be an excellent solution:
Commissioner David Stern: All right,
lottery picks, turn to page 18 of your Hustler textbook and...
