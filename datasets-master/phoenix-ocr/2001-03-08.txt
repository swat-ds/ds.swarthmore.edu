including
Although administrators
Bob Gross, dean of the college; Owen
Redgrave, director of public safety; Tedd
Kohlberg

Goundie, associate dean for student life; and
Karen Henry, assistant dean of the college
and gender education advisor, who were all
on hand to field questions spent much of
the time explaining and defending current
safety policies, the meeting produced a few
practical suggestions for increasing campus
safety.
The difference between feeling safe and
being safe was a point of contention throughout the meeting. Students often brought up
safety measures that wouldmake them "feel
safer" which the administrators thought
would do little to reduce the crime rate on
campus.
"The administration is putting money
and statistics above [students'] sense of
safety,"'said Alisa Greenberg 'OL "I feel safer
at Penn at 1 a.m. than [I do] walking home
from Sharpies after dark."
When asked if the college allots enough
money for campus safety, Gross said the issue is about perception. The connection between spending money and crime prevention is unclear, he said, and "we're not going to scatter money around for the sake of

doing something."

PUBLIC SAFETY
Many students had complaints and questions about public safety. Sujatha Srinivasan
'Ol, who lives in Pittenger, said that she has
used thetunnels frequently late at night. "I
have never seen a public safety officer [by
the tunnels] in my four years here," she said.

Redgrave explained that public safety

officers have staggered shifts. On average,
he said, there are two officers on duty, but
from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. there are four. Two of
the officers are in cars and the other two
are walking.
The Swarthmore police also have a bike
patrol. Because the campus comprises 340
acres, he explained, whether you see a pub-

lic safety officer at one particular place depends on how long you look there.
One student asked if public safety officers have beats. Set routines for patrol officers are "relatively passe," Redgrave said.
Instead, public safety does a statistical
analysis of the problem areas on campus
(such as the tunnels and Sharpies Drive) and
places officers in those locations.
Redgrave added that public safety is

CALL BOXES
To make the campus safer, some students

suggested that call boxes should be installed
around campus that would connect directly
to public safety. "I can't think of a year in
the last 10 years when this hasn't come up,"
Redgrave said. However, he added, the issue
has been "tabled" while considering the
"best way to spend money on campus."
Redgrave said that his colleagues at other
colleges have found that the call boxes,
which, according to an estimate taken about
five years ago, would cost $300,000 to install
plus more to upkeep, are a convenience
when a car won't start or there is a medical
emergency. He said there are "very few"
cases when the boxes would have a "direct
bearing on a crime in progress."

Moreover, Redgrave added, call boxes
invite vandalism and false alarms. He estimated that it would be hard to say how successful the call boxes would be here.
A few students objected that they would
feel safer on a campus with call boxes.

Srinivasan said that if the call boxes had
been suggested every year for ten years,
"doesn't that say Swarthmore students
would feel better with [call boxes]? Can [effectiveness] statisticsreflect 'feeling safer'?"
Goundie said that a few, specific and useful places to put call boxes would be a good
starting point. However, he was "worried
about a false sense of security" the boxes
would provide. The boxes would not have
helped in the assault or last semester's mugging, he said.

LIGHTING
Campus lighting also came up as an area
of concern. Asked why the campus was so
dark, Redgrave replied that public safety has

"three-year plans to prioritize lighting concerns," the most recent of which ended last
year. Groups bring their lighting concerns
to public safety and public safety is "80 percent successful in addressing all the areas
brought up," he said. According to Redgrave,
public safety is working to put together another plan with help from student council,
among other groups.

Several particular parts of campus were
highlighted as lighting trouble spots, including the area around the fraternity houses
and the Women's Resource Center, where,
said Siobhan Carty 'Ol, "two lights have been
down for at least a week" and the area "is
completely dark and isolated."
When asked whether the lights were going to be replaced, Redgrave said he was

No leads on crimes
Following a wave ofcrimes two weekends ago, Swarthmore borough police still have
or in the vandalism of several college- and studentowned vehicles.
"The investigating officer and the detective from the D.A.'s office are spending a lot
of time doing interviews, but I can't tell you we're any closer to solving it than we were
a week ago," Police Chief Bran Craig said, adding that the lack of progress was "frus&o leads in the attempted rape case,

trating."

Craig said the police department is spending the most time investigating the attempted
rape incident. Officers are trying to turn up any lead they can, but there are none so far.
Craig attributed this to the fact that very few people were likely to be near Sharpies, the
scene of the incident, at three in the morning.
With regard to the vandalism of several vehicles, Craig said that the police department had heard rumors but had received nothing substantial.

-IVING WAGE CAMPAIGN: STAFF INVPTVMEWr-

Push for wage changes faces
unresponsiveness among some staff
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
The Living Wage and Democracy Cammade it a priority to reach out to
as many staff members as possible, and over
a hundred employees have chosen to show
support through signing the living wage
petition and attending meetings.
Yet a lack of enthusiasm on the part of
some staff has also challenged the
campaign's efforts, and about 270 non-exempt employees
those who are paid by
the hour have yet to sign the petition.
As Kae Kalwaic, an administrativeassispaign has

tant and one of the main organizers of the
campaign pointed out in a letter to The Phoenix, staff members "are dispersed across
campus, and employees work second jobs
or have children at home, making it difficult to come to our [noontime] meetings."
Many staff who arrive in early morning
hours have no desire to give up their lunch
hour to better inform themselves about the
cause, said Andrea Campbell, an Environmental Services employee who is involved

in the campaign.

"There really are few structures to allow
for voice," Kalwaic said, explaining that
there is no time set aside in a staff member's
day for discussion about issues that relate
"directly to our job."
"Most hourly employees are not part of
decision-making or consensus processes
that could bring significant improvements
to the college," she said.
Since the beginning of the semester, all

staff members have received three individu-

ally addressed invitations to educational
meetings about

the campaign, as well as an

eight-page informational document that explains how to go about signing the petition.
Still, most of them have yet to show interest, although Kalwaic said some staff
wish to sign the petition but have not yet
been able because of daily time constraints.
The lack of concern on the part of some
staffexists despite the fact that the campaign
grew out of staff, not student, efforts. Last
year, said Kalwaic, the ad-hoc Committee on
Long-Range Planning published an informational pamphlet to explain to staff members
how their salaries were determined.
The "Unofficial Guide to Understanding
Your Salary" also pointed out cases where
employees were not being paid what they
should. It also mentioned a lack of representation for hourly employees on the Budget
Committee and Board of Managers. Kalwaic
said the Living Wage Campaign was an "out-

growth" of this ad-hoc committee.
But Kim Alvin, an Environmental Services employee who has chosen not to engage herself in the campaign, said that out
of thirteen coworkers she knows, only one

is involved.
Campbell, whose role in the campaign to
keep Environmental Services employees informed about campaign issues, said a reason for the indifference she has seen is not
decisive opposition to the campaign but the
fact that the staff "don't read" the document
or attend meetings.
"Sometimes you have to walk them like
a newborn baby trying to walk," she said.
Campbell also noted age as a factor in
the unresponsiveness of some staff to the
campaign. Most of the people who are involved in the campaign, she explained, are
of the younger section of college staff.
Campbell referred to "one lady, about 65, getting ready to retire" explaining that "she
4

onrvi

don't care about no living wage."
"I don't want to give up my lunch hour to
go to a meeting," Alvin said simply. "I read
what they sent me, but I still don't know
enough about it."
Alvin also wondered why she began to see
campaign propaganda all over campus before
sheknew very much about it. Although some
staff did involve themselves in the campaign
early on, most did not know about it until it

was publicized.

"Don't get me wrong," she explained.
"I'm not against the living wage. No one is
against anything. I just don't know enough

about it."

Alvin also complained about some of the
methods the Living Wage and Democracy
Campaign has used to push its agenda, including a failure to involve more upper-level
staffmembers.
"Why didn't they tell the supervisors [earlier]?" she wondered. "If you're going to go
through with something like this," she
added, "wouldn't you want to do it with the
support of your supervisor?"
"If this is something for everyone, that's
supposed to benefit everyone, why isn't everyone involved?" Alvin asked.
But Kalwaic said the committee simply
felt they "couldn't put [the proposal] out
there" until they had done research.
"The committee felt that, in order to make
a case for the living wage, we had to investigate what annual income would be needed
for [individuals] to support themselves or
their family," Kalwaic said. "For example,
two years ago, the National Low-Income
Housing Coalition calculated that the hourly
income necessary to afford the average twobedroom apartment was around $12."
"In order to advocate a living wage,"
Kalwaic said, "it was important that we
compile this information so thatthe college
community could make an informed judgment."
Now that the proposal is out, she said, "we
certainly have tried to get as many people
involved as possible." But, she asked, "how
can you engage people who remain silent?"
The campaign has yet to hear the
administration's view on the living wage.
In her letter to The Phoenix two weeks
ago, Kalwaic also addressed the problem of
stafffear. Many hourly workers, she said, are
alarmed about the possible consequences of
proclaiming their views.
"Employees are afraid of retaliation if
they participate in this effort," she wrote.
"Several employees felt that their position
would be at risk if they attended a presenta-

tion with senior staff." Kalwaic described a
meeting during which the presence of several supervisors stifled what was normally
a "lively discussion and active debate."
As a result, the campaign has initiated a
series of staffmeetings with Equal Opportunity Officer Sharmaine LaMar, who has spoken to both supervisors and staff on the
rights of employees to sign petitions and participate in meetings without fear of retaliation.
A letter from LaMar, the Staff Advisory
Committee and Associate Vice President of
Human Resources Melanie Young was published in The Phoenix in response to
Kalwaic's description of staff fear. It stated
that "no staffmember ever needs to fear retaliation at Swarthmore... opinions and concerns are always welcomed."
Campbell agreed that such fears were unwarranted.

A staff member speaks at an informational meeting held at lunch Wednesday, Feb. 21
in Tarble. Organizers of the Living Wage Campaign hope that open weekly meetings will
encourage increased staff participation.
"Swarthmore is not going to hurt them,"
she said. Citing honesty and equality as principles on which the college was founded,
Campbell asked, "why should I fear this college?"
But when asked about her reasons for not
involving herself in the campaign, Alvin described not so much fear of repercussions,
as a concern that a successful push for increased pay would involve unpleasant

tradeoffs for the staff.
Alvin also said some workers who cur-

rently benefit from government assistance,

such as food stamps, could lose that assis-

tance if their wages go up. In this sense, earning a living wage could leave some workers in
financial situations similar to their situations

before the payment raise.
But Andrea Campbell said she views earning a living wage, even while losing government subsidies, as highly preferable to a lower
salary supplemented with federal money, referring to some of the government's application procedures for aid as "degrading."
In spite of the difficulty of firing up zest
for the campaign from some staff members,

Kalwaic said most people who read the living wage proposal and explanation are enthusiastic. Many of them, she said, have contacted herabout signing the petition but simply have not yet been able to because of conflicts with their working hours.
Kalwaic said several groundskeepers began holding meetings in the Physical Plant
building itself in an effort to attract more supporters. Other organizers of the campaign
have since taken the cue to start bringing
meetings to the workers' locations rather
than having the workers come to them.
In addition, campaign advocates are trying to push through an effort to get themselves onto the agenda for a faculty lunch
in the near future in order to sell their
cause to more professors. Kalwaic said that,
ideally, her group would also like to make
a presentation at the all-staff meeting on
March 23.
For the time being, Kalwaic seems confident about encouraging staffinvolvement in
the future. "An education process," she said,
"is not something you can do within a week
or two."

STUDENT
Council discusses campus safety
BY GABRIEL HETLAND

U.N. speakers criticize U.S. drug policies, discuss ongoing guerrilla warfare
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

Safety issues discussed at the fireside chatheld last Thursday were revisited by Student Council at Monday's meeting. Various members reacted to
how the administration and the council were perceived by students. Members felt that the administration came off somewhat poorly in students' eyes,
but felt pretty good about the meeting.
Sara Edelstein 'O3 said that she had heard studentremarks that were dismissive of the council, such as, "They're just going to form another sub-committee." Poulami Roychowdhury 'O3 said that she sensed student frustration
at what is perceived as the administration's excuses.
Chris Morello 'O3 noted that he sensed an atmosphere of frustration among
students at the administration's apparent refusal to commit to security.
In contrast, Jordan Brackett 'Ol said he found the administration to be
surprisingly open and interested in acting upon students' concerns.
Co-chair Anna Woodiwiss 'O2 spoke of students' feelings offrustration with
the administration's seemingly "all-or-nothing" attitude. The administration,
said Woodiwiss, seems to say that the choice is between "spending $20,000 on
security or doing nothing at all." Woodiwiss did think, however, thatAssociate Dean for Student Life Tedd Goundie had come across as receptive to student concerns.
Co-chair Colin Moore 'O2 viewed the meeting as generally positive. He
said that he saw the administration as having made some public relations
mistakes in not seeming to care about students' concerns. Moore did feel that
students and administration both began to see the importance of security.

Bat dung fears delay proposal to open tower
Having received a rash of e-mails inquiring about the possibility of students being allowed to the top of the Clothier bell tower, Student Council discussed the possibility of opening it up. Liane Rice 'O3 raised the issue of safety,
inquiring as to whether there would be a problem with bat and pigeon dung.
Moore said that he thought the stairs had been improved over the summer
by maintenance. Woodiwiss brought up the fact that students are allowed to
use the Sproul observatory telescope one day every month, and thought that
periodically opening the bell tower to students would probably be feasible.
Other members of the council raised the issue of whether there should be
restrictions on nighttime use, with all members agreeing that it would probably be best if use were limited to the day time.
Woodiwiss and Moore agreed to look further into the possibility of allowing students access once a month to the bell tower.
Brackett wants to throw in the towel on coin-op laundry
A proposal to change the way studentsdo laundry was raised by Brackett.
Brackett's proposal would eliminate the coin-operated machines and replace
them with free-use machines.
There were several reasons Brackett gave for the switch. One, the need to
replace worn-out machines, would be alleviated by the new proposal, which
allows new machines to be substituted in more frequently.
Another issue was the annoyance of using quarters. Under Brackett's proposal students would be charged a fee, probably $25 per student. Students
would then be able to use the machines for the rest of the semester. This
would eliminate the need to collect quarters.
Other council members greeted the proposal warmly. Lauren Tobias 'O2
brought up the possibility that free laundry use could encourage greater cleanliness among the student body.
One concern was that students would abuse the new policy by doing
smaller loads more frequently. Brackett dismissed this concern by saying
that most students are prevented from doing laundry more frequently by
the time involved, rather than the cost. Brackett resolved to talk with Larry
Schall, vice president for facilities and services, about the cost of the proposal and its feasibility.

tive group from the American Friends Service
Committee; talked with a small gathering of students about the plight of Afro-Colombians and the
adverse consequences they suffer from United
States foreign and anti-drug policies.
The speakers, stopping at the college on their
way from conferences with black senators in
Washington to meetings at the U.N., said their
purpose was to inform the American public of
Afro-Colombians' dire situation and the little-

known negative effects ofU.S. policy in Colombia.
"We are in the U.S. to try to explain to you what's
going on in Colombia, because we know our government won't do that," Zuniga said.
People of African descent account for approximately 26 percent of the Colombian population,
Rosero explained, or about 10.5 million people. The
Choco region
from which Rosero and Zuniga
come is located on Colombia's Pacific coast and
is home to three million Afro-Colombians.
Here, Afro-Colombians account for nearly 95
percent of the local population. According to
Rosero and Zuniga, the region has become increasingly prone to conflicts between the military and
guerilla armies, as well as to coca plant fumigation. These disturbances have caused many native
Afro-Colombians to flee in search of food and
safety.
"In the last few years, guerilla groups have increased in capacity, quantity of territory and influence at the national level," Rosero said. He attributed this increase in part to greater U.S. aid to
the Colombian military, which has caused an escalation in military-guerrilla conflict.
Over the past three years, L 8 million Colombi-

ans havebeen displaced from their homes, according to Rosero; 60 percent of them are of African
descent. Last year alone, 317,000 Colombians were
displaced due to guerilla warfare and attacks on
farms and crops, 30 percent of whom were of African descent. Furthermore, an additional 15,000 Colombians fled to Ecuador and Venezuela as refugees last year fearing death, should they remain
within Colombia's borders.
Rosero explained further that those displaced
from their homes are offered only three months of
meager humanitarian assistance before they are
forced to fend for themselves. "There is no possibility to rebuild their lives or selves," Rosero said.
According to Rosero, "The armed conflict is one
that every day erodes itself." Not only do the violent conflicts force Afro-Colombians to flee, but

asked.

Henry said that if someone

they also claim the lives of community leaders
and add to discrimination against Afro-Colombians as an ethnic and racial group.
Zuniga offered criticism ofU.S. policy. "I don't
understand how to get peace the U.S. gives Colombia weapons," he said. "We need U.S. aid, but
not for war, for social development. At the root
of the problem is the fact that many Colombians,
mainly those ofAfrican descent, are in very bad
social conditions."
The speakers further criticized the United
States' attempts to eradicate the country's coca
fields, which constitute a major source of U. S.bound cocaine. The most recent focus of these
efforts has been on funding the fumigation of coca
farms throughout Colombia.
Though Rosero acknowledged the United
States' attempt to reduce the importation of illegal drugs, he also decried fumigation's side effects, which include damage to staple food crops
and injury to villagers and farm animals. Furthermore, he labeled the plan essentially futile:
"The law of capitalism says where there is a demand, there will be a supply so there is always
a supply [of coca farms]."
Zuniga proposed an alternative solution to fumigation: stopping the supply of the chemicals
needed to make cocaine from the coca plant. He
said, "You fumigate the coca plant, but the environment and population also vanish. To produce
cocaine, it's necessary to use chemicals available
in the U.S. and elsewhere. We don't understand
why you [the U.S.] need to attack coca plants
when there are so many other branches to attack."

According to Rosero, the economic hardships
caused by fumigation lead to increased violence
and disintegration of communities, as Afro-Colombian youths join paramilitary forces out of
economic desperation. Rosero said that the average family in the Choco region makes $5OO to $6OO
each year, while members of the paramilitary
earn $5OO a month for their services.

Though the speakers painted a bleak picture

of dislocation, discrimination and economic hardship for the Afro-Colombian peoples, they ex-

pressed hope for a new U.S. policy that would allot
funds for the social development of Colombia instead of aiding the Colombian military and coca
farm eradication projects. "It's the responsibility of the U.S. public to put pressure on the government to end such practices," Rosero said.
Zuniga added, "We'd appreciate it if you'd try to
give the message learned here to classmates,
teachers, everybody."
A small group of students gathered to learn
about the Afro-Colombian population Sunday
evening.
The talk was made possible by the combined
efforts of Empty the Shelters, College Democrats,
Swarthmore Progressive Action Committee, and
students Matt Landreman 'O2 and Cathy Meals 'O4.

Little-known resource aids students wrestling to get along
BY HOFAN CHAU

Despite the involvementof thirty-seven trained mediators,
the Swarthmore Mediation Program remains largely unknown to the campus. Unable to boast about its successes
because of its policy to remain confidential, the four-year-old
conflict management program is now finding new ways to
demystify itself.
"Part of the problem is that people can't put a human face
[on] mediation," said mediator Andy Wong 'O2. "We know that
conflicts happen [students] just don'tknow who we are."
In order to begin to spread the word about the program,
Wong and fellow mediator Olivia Gruber 'O3 chattedwith students about the program at the Intercultural Center on Feb.
28. Their presentation was conducted under the framework
of the IC's resource nights, a series of programs designed to
introduce students to campus resources.
Participants raised questionsabout mediation and conflict resolution strategies they could apply in their everyday lives. They also offered suggestions as to how the mediation program might make itself more successful, such
as having role-playing so that people could see for themselves the process of mediation. Meghna Bhagat, the
evening coordinator of the IC, was so interested in the subject that she talked with the mediators afterwards about
the possibility of sponsoring a second workshop to specifically address conflict resolution skills.
Mediation, according to the program, is based on the
premise that people are sometimes so entrenched in conflict
that they may not communicate effectively or see the issues
clearly. Having a neutral third party may help disputants define the issues and get "unstuck." Statistics show that, on average, mediation programs attain a successful resolution in
about 80 percent of their cases.
While many people may turn to their RAs to help solve

problems, Dean ofResidential Life Myrt Westphal passes on some
roommate disputes to mediation because "RAs have vested interest, or, at the very least, perceived invested interest."
"It's hard for them to remain impartial," Westphal said. Not
only does the program provide mediators who do not know the
participants, but there are also always two mediators in a session to check on one another.
As one junior with a roommate dispute found out, having an
objective viewpoint allowed her to realize a solution previously
dismissed. "They sat down and problem-solved with us," she said.
By taking her conflict to mediation, she had a "meaningful discussion" that resulted in a solution satisfactory to both parties.
The program also stresses the voluntary and confidential nature ofthe process, in which any resolution ultimatelyrests with
the disputants. "Nothing that goes on in a mediation can be reported to another body of the college, so nothing anyone says in
mediation can be used against him or her later on," said mediator Ushi Tandon.
"If people can arrive at their own solutions voluntarily, they
can also own those solutions," he said, "which means they can
take responsibility for them and follow through on them."
Westphal, who has been involved with the program from the
beginning, said the process is particularly effective in addressing conflicts in which there are different styles ofcommunication, where quiet personalities are given as much space to speak
and listen as forthright ones. The structure also minimizes possible power differences inherent in faculty-student or staff-supervisor disputes.

It has been illegal to sell alcoholic beverages in the borough of Swarthmore since
1949. On May 15, that could all change.
Over the past two weeks, citizens of the

borough were asked to sign a petition to
put the liquor license ordinance to a public vote.
The proposed referendum would ask if
citizens were in favor of "the granting of
liquor licenses on property owned by an
accredited college or university in the Borough of

Swarthmore" and would cover

serving alcohol in a restaurant in the proposed Swarthmore hotel.
The developer is currently planning to

build the hotel on the athletic fields between the SEPTA stationand PPR, and has
stated that he is not willing to go through
with the project unless the liquor referendum passes.
The petition was required to have at
least 758 signatures, or 25 percent of the
number of voters in the last general election, by Mar. 6. According to petition organizer and borough councilmember Alice
Willetts, "we got over 1,060 at the last
count."

EDITORIAL
Safety measures possible
It's no surprise that Student Council, along with
other groups, has been pushing for better safety
measures around campus, especially in light of the
events of last week. What is a surprise, and further, a
disgrace, is that despite constant dialogue on the
issue, nothing ever seems to get done.
Part of the reason is that some ideas are not quite
feasible at least, not yet. For example, it appears that
the college is unwilling to install call boxes everywhere
on campus. But measures could be taken to make more
phones available, especially in the areas that have been
repeatedly identified as trouble spots, like the area
around Sharpies and the tunnels. Phoenix reporters
found that the closest phone to the Sharpies patio at night
was in the basement of Tarble, next to the bookstore.
Surely it wouldn't be too costly or difficult to leave the
outer lobby of Sharpies open and put a phone in it.
At the fireside chat last Thursday, many participants proposed an all-night shuttle. This service,
though it would require hiring a full-time, nonstudent driver, would be invaluable to everyone,
regardless of where they live. Technically, public
safety officers will pick you up and take you wherever
you want to go at any time of the day or night, but if
every student who walked around campus very late at
night asked them for a ride, they wouldn't have time

to patrol the grounds. An all-night shuttle guarantees
that no one has to walk home at night again or wait 45
minutes to get picked up by public safety, either.
None of these ideas are revolutionary, and none
would pose significant cost or trouble to the college. It
seems unlikely that we will get card access or call boxes
all over campus any time soon, but in the meantime, the
administration should make a few simple changes that
could make a substantial difference.

In end, RIAA can't win

On Monday the recording industry landed the first
major blow in its battle against Napster, when federal
judge Marilyn Patel issued an injunction to stop
Napster users from trading unauthorized files upon
notice from the copyright holders. Yet if the Recording Industry Association of America hopes to slay
Napster and peer-to-peer file sharing, it's going to
need more than just the law on its side the RIAA
will have to stop technological change.
This analysis may seem a little ridiculous
after
all, the RIAA represents a multi-billion dollar industry
and employs legions of highly educated lawyers, and
Napster is just a small company. But these days, a few
kids and their computers are far more effective not
to mention far faster than any number of lawyers.
The fundamental difficulty facing the RIAA is that
while it may be battling Napster, it's warring against
technology, economics and human nature. Digital
formats have made the duplication of media perfect,
easy and free, and computer networks, of which
Napster is one, have made the distribution of media
even easier. It's far cheaper and simpler to send your
friend in California an MP3 of your new favorite song
than it is to send them a burnt CD or a tape.
This is the kind of simple reasoning that has made
Napster incredibly popular, but also nearly impossible to
combat legally. Ever wonder why no one cares if you

make a tape or burn a CD of one of your friend's albums?
Part ofthe reason no one cares is because it's impossible
and ridiculously expensive to track. Now imagine
the expense of hunting down 65 million users, trying to
verify who actually has the rights to the music and then
suing each ofthe millions of users who don't.
This, in a nutshell, is why the RIAA may win the
battle when it has already lost the war. Napster is one
soldier in an army of millions, and even if the RIAA
manages to shut down Napster, the next weapon is
already being developed on some college student's

computer. Peer-to-peer file sharing is simply too
a technology for the RIAA to fight. If the
RIAA really wants to come out on cop, it would do
better to spend its money on exploring new technolopowerful

Article further stigmatizes single motherhood
Dear Editor:

The Phoenix article "Religion, faith shouldn't make laws"
(Feb. 15) argues that access to abortion is necessary until the
issues surrounding single motherhood have been eliminated or
resolved. Likewise, a cartoon in the same issue of the Phoenix
suggested that a woman's "right to choose" is in danger as a result of recent government actions. A woman's "right to choose,"
however, is already inhibited in a different way. The right to an
abortion was guaranteed by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade
(1973); in many areas of the United States, women can seek a
legal abortion at any time during the nine months of pregnancy.
In most cases, abortion is a viable choice and society presents
it as such. But can a woman choose to see a pregnancy to term
and have her child? It may seem like a simple question, but in
America today, it does not have so obvious an answer.
Even in a modern, technologicallyadvanced nation that prides

itselfon its political correctness, tolerance and open-mindedness,

young single mothers continue to be stigmatized. The Phoenix
cartoon illustrates this point—it presents women as "forced" into
the horrific world of single motherhood by an unfeeling government. Perhaps it is society that is unfeeling. There is a world of
difficulties that single pregnant women must face. How many are
refused support from their friends and families, or do not even
feel it is possible to tell their loved ones that they are pregnant?
How many single moms lack the prenatal care that they and their
children deserve or lack the emotional and financial support that
they need to raise these children? Have you ever stopped to notice
how many women students on campus are pregnant?

We live in a nation where women are told that the best
way to handle these difficulties is to avoid them
and that

abortion will help them do just that. Pregnancy is neither a
crime nor a disease, and pregnant women deserve financial

assistance, appropriate medical attention and support from
their family and peers. The "problem" here lies in the belief
that by making abortion accessible, women can avoid the pain
and trauma caused by being a single mother. Where does this
trauma originate? What makes it so hard to be a single
mother? Clearly, there are multiple factors, and a social stigma
and lack of resources for single pregnant women are not least
among them. Instead of providing an avoidance tactic, society should be re-examining its attitudes towards single mothers, not deriding them for their choice to give birth. Presence

not that
of alternatives implies that there are options
women are only correct in choosing the one that is easiest or
least costly for society.
Such deep-rooted problems will not be resolved overnight.
But this does not excuse the perpetuation of an attitude that
makes women unable to choose to have theirchildren. Regardless of the debate about the pros or cons of abortion, single
women deserve more than ostracism and a lack of access to
childcare and medical resources. A collective effort to make
societal institutions more sensitive to social realities, starting
with a change in individual attitudes, will help restore the
welcoming environment that pregnant single mothers deserve.

McCabe: keep heroin
in and pillows out
Through the years, I have often tried to warn the
community concerning certain lapses of etiquette and
a general lack of awareness of the existence of others. I
would like to think myself successful. I would also like
to think myself 6'2", but neither is likely to be true. So,
it is with a certain amount of misgiving that I return to
this earlier theme, popularly known as "What You're
Doing Wrong." This week, our focus is the heretofore
haven of, if not social concern, at least social isolation:
the library.
I would like to exempt certain libraries from consideration here. The first is Cornell, to which I never go
because nothing I need is there, and I am afraid of it. I
imagine that if there are indeed sub-human species that
wander in darkly-lit passages and air ducts somewhere
in the world, their Mecca is Cornell Library. I also take
out of consideration Underhill, the music library, because a) it's too small to seriously think that you could
have some measure of privacy or silence and b) because
it's never open when it says it's open.

McCABE IS NOT A DORMITORY.
THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT YOU
CAN'T SPEND THE DAY THERE,
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SLEEPING THERE.
This leaves us, I'm afraid, with the bizarrely fenestrated mass that is McCabe. I admit to having a soft
spot in my heart for McCabe; I, for one, was sorry to
see the hideous red carpet go from the first floor, although, as if the beast itself were willing to undergo
cosmetic measures but could not change its true nature, the revisionists of good taste have not yet made
their way to the upper levels. I take comfort in the fact
that I, at least, can remember her, in parting, as greatly
unchanged.
It should also be remarked that I am opposed to the
current trend in increased socialization in the first
floor, what with the addition of the coffee bar and generally more pleasant atmosphere. It seems a self-evidently bad idea to sell coffee in a library. If someone
needs a statistics project, calculate the increase in ex-

penditures for replacement books before and after the
installation of the coffee bar. While one may turn a
blind eye, it is bad policy to encourage destructive
behavior and then charge for it. Bad policy or the cigarette settlement.
We have, though accidentally, stumbled onto our
theme, to wit, what the library isn't. Administration to
the contrary, it is not a cafe. If you're going to eat, it
should be limited to non-staining foods like SweetTarts
or heroin. Paper is not the most hardy of substances. I
realize that we are all mature, responsible and (of
course) dexterous people, but mistakes are made by even
the most careful.
Secondly, McCabe is not a dormitory. This is not to
say that you can't spend the day there, but you shouldn't
be sleeping there. You pay good money for a room; sleep
there. If, on the other hand, you live in Willets, where
you can't sleep, go somewhere people aren't studying.
My roommate when I was a sophomore slept in the BCC.
While this may not be a universal option, it should inspire you. On the same note, though many people do
not realize it, you snore
loudly, annoyingly, out of
rhythm. This distracts others. We do not like it when
you snore. Though I generally decry the alarming increase in violent crime on campus, a little non-violent

burglary of sleeping students in the library might wise
some up to the fact that one should be careful in what
situations he puts himself at the mercy of others.
Our motto: do unto others as you would have them
not bludgeon you.

Taliban's cultural warfare a bad choice
With international community offering other options, group should opt not to destroy relics

would be the best option for the Taliban. After all, the artifacts would be out of the view of the relatively primitive

civilizations it rules.
The group would also score some points in the eyes of
the international community, where it is widely deplored
and though of as an irrational, fanatical world terrorist organization. The Afghanistan people over whom they preside
desperately need these relations to improve, as the poor international standing of the Taliban has resulted in abject poverty. It is unlikely that this will

That said, cultural warfare is nothing new. One of the
first and most effective things a new governing body can do
to consolidate power after a hostile takeover is to destroy
remnants of the past. It's been this way since the beginning
of warfare between civilized societies. Even the imperialist
ideologies on which our worldpolitical economy was founded
could be construed as a form of cultural warfare. In this case,
though, the Taliban is being given a choice, one that the
group should consider very carefully. That choice is between
destruction and removal.
International communities are offering to remove these

change without the Taliban gaining at
least some place in the world economy.
It does not look like the Taliban will
turn the artifacts over, unfortunately.
Its modus operandi is one of religious
fanaticism and adherence to the strictest interpretation of Islam, which
means that the group is unlikely to
heed the international calls to preserve
the relics. In so doing, it is passing on
an opportunity to gain credibility and
respect for its religion, nation, group

and community, all of which have rich traditions but need
international support to truly thrive.
Maybe in centuries past, leadership has been in a local
vacuum. But these days, it's under the close examination of

an international interpretive lens. Politically, the destruction of the artifacts by the Taliban would be a poor decision
for the people and views that the group represents
not
because what the Taliban is doing is an unprecedented horror, but because it illustrates the group's irrationality and
lack of regard for, and unwillingness to deal with, the world
community.

Student's name should not have gone in newspaper
Dear Editor:
The problem with being a section
editor is that sometimes you don't get
as much time to pay attention to other
sections as you would like. Usually this
problem is not a problem; rarely do I
read something in the paper that I am
upset about.
However, I completely disagree with

our decision to publish the name of a
student who was arrested last week. His
name was also published by the Delaware County Times and the Daily Gazette.
It was only upon reading the Daily
Gazette that I first noticed that a campus publication had mentioned the
student's name. I was really pissed off,

and immediately wrote an

inappropri-

e-mail to
Gazette editor Jeff Heckelman (sorry,

ately profane and obnoxious

Jeff).

It was Jeff who, in a very professional
manner not befitting the rudeness I displayed, brought it to my attention that,
indeed, my own paper, The Phoenix, had
also published the student's name.
I take full responsibility for being

negligent and not realizing that The
Phoenix was publishing the student's
name. However, my knowledge would
probably have had no effect on the decision, for it seems to me that the current
mission of this paper is "journalism
first, community second."
In fact, I usually find myself in accordance with this mission. No mission,
though, is absolute, and when an issue
is so emotionally sensitive and harmful
to certain individuals, I believe a publication has to suspend its strict adherence to formal laws and instead put on a
human face.

This should not be so hard, since publications are always made up of human

beings; in The Phoenix's case, I can assure you, these are very compassionate
human beings.
Sure, the student may be 21; I'm not
arguing that the action was illegal. However, I believe that community papers,
unlike disinterested, profit-driven publications such as the Delaware County
Times, have a responsibility beyond
journalistic integrity. Furthermore, I
question whether one can have journalistic integrity without having integrity
in the first place.
Even without its publication by cam-

pus publications, the student's name still
would have been carried from the pages

d

of the Delaware County Times to the
mouths that run the Swarthmore rumor mill. However, I hardly think
this student's image on campus
would have been nearly as scarred
as it now is. He will now be seen, even
known, as the student who hit a cop
and got arrested. The rest of his time
here, however long, will most likely
be defined by one fateful night.
Now, I do not know this student,
but I am sure that this one incident
cannot be representative of his character. Indeed no one night can properly represent any one person, particularly when that person is intoxi-

cated.

Unfortunately, the rash decisions
of the campus publications will most
likely put an end to even the possibility of him having even a measure
of anonymity.
The student would have suffered
enough without the publication ofhis
name by campus publications. Now,
hopefully the poor judgment of this
paper can be diluted by a student
body that believes in second chances.

Dear Editor:
On behalf of Earthlust, we would like to bring
Swarthmore's energy consumption to your attention.
Currently, the college uses 12 to 13 million Kilowatthours of electricity per year (one kWh equals 10 hours of
energy from one 100-watt light bulb) on everything from
lights to air conditioning, computers to appliances. We pay
approximately $1 million for this commodity to PECO
Energy, which provides us with an energy cocktail composed of two-thirds nuclear energy and one-third coal en-

We believe that Swarthmore College should exercise

its moral and economic strength by taking a national leadership role in the development of renewable energy. Based
on statistics for the Mid-Atlantic power pool, Swarthmore
College causes the generation of 110,000 tons of carbon dioxide, 735 tons of sulfur dioxide, 317 tons of nitrous oxide
and an unknown quantity of radioactive waste each year.
These pollutants have been directly linked to smog, acid rain,
groundwater pollution (do you

warming. Such environmental
problems are avoidable by buying

However, the price has dropped drastically over the last
20 years and will continue to decline, especially if influential buyers like Swarthmore enter the market.

energy consumption. There exists the potential for Swarthmore
to increase its energy efficiency
and reallocate the savings toward wind.
I
Each of us can aid in this process by reducing our individual
energy usage. A lot of money can be saved though efficiency, but in the end, the college will likely need to pay
more for large-scale conversion to wind energy. This
would entail reallocating funds from elsewhere in the
college's budget and/or endowment.
More information on how to cut energy use will appear around campus in the coming weeks. For specifics on the wind energy campaign, please contact one of

renewable energy.
To this end, we propose that
Swarthmore begin a switch to
wind energy. Wind is the only viable "green" energy source that currently exists in Pennsylvania. It emits no harmful pollutants into the air, ground
or water, nor does it have the negative ecosystem effects
of hydropower. Wind energy is steadily becoming mainstream in the Pennsylvania energy market; optimal production sites are currently being developed in the Poconos
and elsewhere.
Earthlust is currently in contact with Swarthmore's
facilities managers, members of the administration and
outside environmental and wind energy marketing groups.
The college's main barrier to acquiring wind energy is that
wind costs slightly more than coal and nuclear energy.

Last Sunday was not a good day.
Maureen Dowd was on vacation. Senator Byrd said
the n-word on national television. And President Bush
remained popular.
It certainly had been a bizarre couple of weeks. As if
the magnetic polls
er, poles
of the universe had
suddenly done one of those instantaneous reversals or
something. (That did happen to the sun, you know.) Or
like those times in elementary school when you were
bored and suddenly declared that it was "opposite day."
Only now every day is opposite day.
I mean, take a look at the facts. The Democrats are
trying to shoot down George W. Bush's tax cut plan, so
who do they send over to Fox News Sunday? A U.S. senator and former majority leader from West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd, who just happens to be a former member of
the Ku Klux Klan. Instead of strongly condemning the
Bush plan as highly detrimental to working families and
then getting off the TV screen as fast as an 83-year-old
rnan possible can, Byrd felt the need to pontificate on the
state of race relations in this country, muttering the nWord a couple of times, along with "yes, I'm going to use
that word" and some strange advice from his dead mother.
Meanwhile, John Ashcroft (remember him? He's the
right-wing attorney general who writes gospel songs and
loses elections to dead people) urged the Senate Judiciary
Committee to pass legislation on racial profiling, of all
things, as soon as possible. He said that if a bill doesn't
reach the floor within six months, he would begin taking
action himself.
I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble with this new "opposite day" game. Since when do attorneys general formerly
branded as racists urge the passage of civil rights legisla-

tion written by John Conyers, while Democratic senators use racial epithets on Sunday morning talk shows
and urge the country to stop obsessing over racial inequality?
Other opposite day events:
The Miami Herald, which completed its manual recount in Miami-Dade County and found that Gore didn't
have so many dimpled chads after all, decided to report
its findings underthe headline "Gore still loses." Except
that this sort of ignores the overvotes (which went to
Gore), not to mention the butterfly ballot which caused
19,000 Jews to vote for Pat Buchanan
all which mean,
of course, that "Gore still wins."
About 400 extremely wealthy fat cats have publicly
urged Congress not to repeal the estate tax, saying it will
only make the rich richer and the poor poorer. Among
these rich progressives are George Soros, the Rockefeller
family and Bill Gates, Sr. Said President Bush's press
secretary: "The President is aware of this effort launched

by several millionaires and billionaires to keep the estate tax in place. He disagrees."
Well, at least a few things are still going according to
plan. It turns out that Paul O'Neill, the new treasury
secretary, weighs in as the wealthiest member of the
president's cabinet, with his year 2000 personal income
totaling just over $56 million. That way, when the
president's popular plan to raise spending, lower taxes
and pay down the national debt falls through on account
ofmathematical impossibility, Mr. O'Neill, Dick Cheney
and Marc Rich can contribute a little something toward
the shortfall.
Wait a minute. That would only happen on opposite
day.

By now we all know that last weekend was not a good one for
Swarthmore when it comes to campus safety and security. Many
of us, however, are painfully aware that the following week was
not much better, as far as a different kind of security goes. The
second kind might be considered even more essential to the development of an integrated campus community: the sense of
comfort, stability and pride that comes with knowing the administration is being honest with you. As far as this sort of security is concerned, it's been a pretty bad year.
When I was sifting through my college choices, Swarthmore
stood out because of its self-avowed commitment to seeking out
holding what seems right at a
the meaning behind the form
higher priority than what tends to be endorsed by others. What
I'm learning, sadly, is that our school sometimes shows more interest in looking good than in being good. Even more unfortunately, its administrators are not doing a stellar job of keeping up

those all-important appearances.
When a woman's body is violated near Sharpies not long after a mugging at gunpoint a few hundred yards away the school
has a responsibility to admit that it sorely needs to address campus
safety. Getting defensive about expenses at a subsequent safety
meeting and, worse, making intimations about the victim's responsibility in the crime's circumstances doesn't fool anyone.
When a vow is made to incoming football players that
Swarthmore is dedicated to its football program, and then the
same program is eliminated three years later, a mistake has been
made, and the school needs to own up to it. Denying that vow at
later campus meetings only makes the administration look like
a bunch ofliars twice over.
Surely the college understands that its students are not stu-

pid. The school certainly has no qualms about plastering our average SAT scores (oh, that emblem of wisdom) over every possible magazine page. Why, then, do some members of the administration seem to expect concerned students to accept equivocations and generalizations in lieu of explanations
statements
that are, at best, illogical, and, at worst, insulting? TeUing football supporters betrayed by broken promises that those promises
were never really made? That makes no sense. Telling those assembled at a safety meeting following a sexual assault that the
(alleged) overuse of alcohol on campus means the community isn't
taking safety seriously? That's not only irrelevant, it's offensive.
Worst of all is the insinuation, made by some officials at the
athletic and safety meetings, that we will all forget about these
issues within a couple of weeks and therefore might as well calm
down. Well, I can't say how long I will remember the details of
the ARC decision, or the words of the administrators at the camand a growing number of
pus safety meeting last week, but I
others
will certainly not forget the feeling of betrayal that
comes in their wake. For the first time since I left high school, I
feel alienated by the people who run my school. This "us against
them" mentality was one I hoped to leave behind for good, one I
chose my college in order to avoid. Now, as I'm nearing the end

of my Swarthmore years, it's back with a vengeance.
Last semester, I held a position that allowed me to speak with
prospective Swarthmore students. When they asked about important decisions on campus, I told them they were made with pointed
attention to student opinion and needs. Then the football fiasco
happened. When they asked me about safety, I told them it was a
priority for the college. Then last weekend, and the subsequent meeting with the administration, came. I am embarrassed. I feel I've
given people a false impression of the way my school is run. At
least I can console myself with the realization that I did no intentionalwrong. Those students aren't any more misled than I've been.
I'm not the only one who feels fooled, and I'm certainly not the
only one willing to say so to anyone, Swattie or not, who will lend
out of concern for public relations, if
an ear. Sooner or later
nothing else the administration is going to have to wake up and
realize that as far as much ofthe student community is concerned,
their evasive tactics are creating enemies. A rift is opening in the
Swarthmore community, one easy to make and very difficult to fill.
I'm not asking for all my interests and demands to be satisfied.
In the end, all I'm really asking for is honesty. Listen, people, if you
made a mistake and have to break a promise, admit it. If you can't
figure out how to allocate money to a cause (hint: better campus
lighting) for which it is sorely needed, admit the need as well as the
inability to meet it. We know administrators are not gods, and that
miscalculations are, at times, inevitable. However, we also know
when we're being stonewalledand when we're being heard and
if you want us to listen to you, you've got to return the favor.

Visual 'Last Resort' an independent dream
BY DAN MARRIN
Let me start with a warning: this is a review of films at the Ritz, meaning that you
must travel to Philly to see them. For this reason, some of you may already be skeptical of
this review, but I advise taking the trip. You
may think city theaters show only obscure

art films,but in fact, films with incredible talent and acclaim that should hit the multiplex
often wind up showing at the Ritz, primarily
due to fear that audiences won't be immediately hooked. This spring, even star-studded

films like Samuel L. Jackson's "Caveman's
Valentine" and the mystery "Memento," starring Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie
Anne-Moss of "The Matrix," will show only
at the Ritz. They may not ever make it to the
local multiplex, despite having the names and
acclaim that draw crowds.
That said, I intend to review some obscure
films, and more specifically "Last Resort." The
Shooting Gallery film series brags that it attracts moviegoers with "thebest films we have
never heard of," films without major stars or
big budgets. The series won renown last summer when it presented Mike Hodge's casino
thriller "Croupier," which became an independent hit. This spring, films from America,
the United Kingdom, Iran and Japan are each
guaranteed a two-week spot at one theater in
most major U.S. cities through the series.
The Shooting Gallery began with Polish
director Pawel Pawlikowski's "Last Resort,"

THE PHOENIX

which has its last showing tonight at
Philadelphia's Ritz in the Bourse theatre, located at 4th and Walnut. "Last Resort" begins
with a bureaucratic nightmare straight out of
Kafka. Tanya(Dina Korzun), a Russian mother,
arrives at the London airport with her son
(Artiom Strelnikov) to meet her new British
fianceand potential third husband, Marc. Marc
never shows up at the airport, and to remain
in the area and find him, Tanya applies for political asylum. The authorities quickly cart her
and her son off to Stonehaven, a gritty port
town for refugees, where every block is plagued
with security cameras, barbed wire and police
surveillance. Tanya and her son live in a tenement with Indians, Africans and Eastern Europeans, all struggling to find a way out of
Stonehaven and barely able to communicate
with each other. When Tanya finally calls
Marc, she finds that he has changed his mind
about their relationship. Of course, she then
tells immigration she is in no need of asylum
and wishes to fly home. They reply that the
paperwork will take at least three to six
months, during which time she is to remain in
the tenement or face prison time.
In desperation, Tanya looks everywhere

for financial and moral support. Enter Alfie
(Paddy Considine), owner of the local
Stonehaven arcade, a scrappy ex-boxer and
ex-convict abandoned by everyone and in
search of moral redemption. Alfie is immediately drawn to Tanya and becomes good
friends with her son. In one sequence that
draws special attention to the culture
clashes, Alfie tries to teach Tanya about Indian cuisine. While she feels safe with him,
Tanya knows love tends to let her down. Ultimately, it comes down to whether Tanya
will fall for him and remain at Stonehaven,
or escape with her son and return to Russia.
The three leads bring intensity and honesty to their roles, none experienced actors,
but all able to create a genuine rapport. While
Korzun was an occasionally overly weepy
Tanya, she brings undeniably stoic beauty

and strength to the role, and is completely
believable as both a mother and young lover.
"Last Resort" runs just 88 minutes, the
majority of dialogue improvised, and was
shot low-budget on location with a minimal
crew. While the conclusion may leave you
unsatisfied, the visuals are incredible for
this director's first film. The shots vary
from wild close-up hand-held techniques to
extremely wide vistas of Stonehaven, its
beach, abandoned amusement park and tenement. For such a gritty dive, the cinematography is gorgeous, capturing luminous
sunsets and rises. Pawlikowski said he
wanted his film to be primarily a love story,
but one set amidst true and relevant social
conflict. While he examines the refugee
plight with a very cold lens, he insists that

politics were merely a backdrop for the romance between Tanya and Alfie that lies at
the film's core. For me, the love story is the
least believable element of "Last Resort,"
but it nevertheless injects some muchneeded hope into an otherwise nightmar-

ish story of social neglect.
Starting Friday and running until March
23, the series will show "WhenBrendan Met
Trudy." It is an Irish comedy from Roddy
Doyle ("The Commitments") about a neurotic loner who discovers that his new girlfriend is a burglar and becomes her partner
in crime. Soon to come are a suburbancrime
comedy called "Too Much Sleep"; an Iranian
film of feminine coming-of-age, fittingly
named, "The Day I Became A Woman"; a

romantic comedy entitled
"Lowdown"; and a Japanese drama, "Eureka," starring Koji Yakasho of "Shall We
Dance." If you're looking to escape themainstream and see some talent that Hollywood
has yet to discover, be sure to visit the Shooting Gallery (www.sgfilmseries.com).

Freud and cocaine: all you need to make sense of dreams
BY JOEY SPADOLA
Of all the activities in which we human beings engage
during our wearisome lives, it is only while dreaming that
we truly escape the bounds of possibility and transcend
reality to a realm of being that is at once exalted and supremely free; it is only while dreaming that we can create
a world in which strife and discord are not to be found,
and in which Love prevails over Hate; it is only while
dreaming, most importantly, that 17 Victoria's Secret mod-

els can live in your five-story waterfront mansion and frolic
in the surf, wearing garments that make their catalog lingerie look like oversized ponchos.
Whenever the topic of dreams comes up, it is a customary
act of respect to begin by invoking the father of psychology,

Sigmund "Instead-of-inventing-psychiatric-treatment-Ishould-have-gotten-it" Freud. Freud, whose dream analysis
has received much attention, is perhaps the most popular
scholar ever to live, and for good reason: aside from being
stark raving mad, there is much on which to commend him.
He was a cocaine addict, for example. (It is in this tradition
that the star ofPresidentBush has risen in our own day.) His
theory, in broad outline, states that you only need five words
to describe the meaning of a dream completely. These are:
parental genitalia, Oedipus, masturbation and (on occasion)
cocaine. To get a clearer idea of this, let us examine some
dream sequences under the standardFreudian interpretation.
DREAM SEQUENCE NO. 1: You meet the love of your life,
your absolute soul mate, and want desperately to make your
affections known. The problem is, however, that you have a
gigantic pair of ears, such that, if you were tilt your head at
just the right angle, you would cause a partial eclipse of the
sun. One day, burning with desire, biding your time for the
right opportunity, you unexpectedly receive a love letter from
your sweetheart, to your overwhelming delight. Only it turns
out, on closer inspection, not to be a love letter at all but something far crueler. It reads:
Roses are red, violets are blue;
Your ears are like the wings of a B-52.
FREUDIAN INTERPRETATION: It is clear that you have
no small desire for your father's male member.
DREAM SEQUENCE NO. 2: You fmd yourself seated in a
gray vinyl armchair, with a pipe and slippers, reading "War
and Peace" in the original Russian. The climax of the dream
comes when you suddenly realize that you don't know Russian and, moreover, that you find the letters of the Cyrillic
alphabet to be kind of funny-looking.
FREUDIAN INTERPETATION: Your life is consumed by
constant subliminal thoughts ofmasturbation.
DREAM SEQUENCE NO. 3: You're at home, it's late at
night, and you and your mother are well, you're not play...

ing Trivial Pursuit, if you catch my meaning.
FREUDIAN INTERPRETATION: You maladjusted freak! You
better see a psychoanalyst, or at least look into purchasing some
cocaine; that'll straighten you out.
Having paid our tribute to Freud, let us move to other aspects
ofdreams. One thing about dreams is that, if they are sufficiently
intense, they can cause people to utter random phrases of varying comprehensibility. I have personally been reported to talk in
my sleep, a fact that unsettles me a great deal, because I am always fearful that I will blurt out something incriminating which,
if heard by the right person, will result in any number of my
extremities being broken. As you might guess, I currently sleep
within earshot of my roommate. And every night I pray to the
Almighty that I do not speak the following words: "Ken, I borrowed your blue Armani vest on Friday night, then spilled beer
all over it and tried to wash it, but accidentally put it in the dryer
and left it in thereway (WAY) too long. It can now fit on a slightlyabove-average-sized gerbil. And it still has beer stains."
I am firmly convinced that Columbo solves all his mysteries
simply by listening in on the nightly soliloquies of his suspects,
who, while snoozing, are similarly indiscriminate in their speech:
"I'm the one who killed Mrs. Beezlemeyer. I did it with the pair

of scissors on my Swiss army knife and framed her Yorkshire
terrier by pouring ketchup..."
Philosophers absolutely love dreams. They have used them
to prove that nothing is truly real, that life is one big illusion,
that there really was a second gunman behind the Grassy Knoll,
that "tuber" spelled backwards is "rebut," etc. Descartes exemplifies the tendency. We all recall with delight the following passage of his: "The other night I had a dream about this amazingly
gorgeous Frenchwoman, and believe me, I had every reason to
think she was real (you should have seen the modes of being on
her!). And when I woke to find that it was all a dream, I came to
doubt everything perceived through the senses. Therefore, God
exists."
Over a millennium earlier, the philosopher St. Augustine used
dreams to similar effect. As he put it, "If you think God doesn't
exist, you're dreaming." Even in our own day, dreams are a central philosophical theme. The Aerosmithian categorical imperative, for example, reverberates in eloquent tones throughout the
caverns of the modern mind, stating, profoundly, "Dream on."
While dreams are the most interesting aspect of sleeping,
various students of psychology have told me that only a small
part of sleep is actually spent dreaming. (It's a wonder they
were able to figure this out, since Freud never really touches
on it.) The question is, then, what are we doing the rest of the
time? Recent findings indicate that we spend this time rather
idly, mostly just listening to REM songs that are stuck in our
heads.
For this reason, I have always thought it would be a good idea
to give the brain something to do while it is not dreaming. Once,

Audrey Chan Phoenix Staff

I bought one of those tape series designed to teach you a foreign language. The advertisements for these tapes are so convincing that I could not resist purchasing a set. The ads go
something like this:
"By the time Annie graduated from college, she had taken
17years of Spanish. But ifyou asked her to order a burrito in
Barcelona, she still wouldn't have had a clue how. That's when
she decided to order Language on a Tape™. After listening to
Language on a Tape™ while taking a nap one afternoon,
Annie became a proficient speaker, and by the end of one
week, she had published three learned monographs in Spanish on the stylistic elements of Cervantes."
Despite their impressive claims, these tape programs, as
I was to discover, simply do not work. And, really, this
shouldn't come as a great surprise, because if you thinkabout
it, you can't really learn much while you're sleeping. This is
proven by the fact that the students who sleep through their
classes all the time are generally not your academic over-

achievers.

Speaking of academic achievement, I have 800 pages of
"War and Peace" to read for tomorrow. So I think I'll go take
a nap.

New series looks disappointing to former teenage Trekkie

When I went to see "Independence Day,"
there was this really cute girl sitting next to
me. We were hitting it off, talking a bit during the film, commenting about the special
effects and Will Smith's beguiling charms.
But I really knew she was perfect for me
when Brent Spiner makes his cameo appearance, and her face lit up as we simultaneously gasped, "DATA!"
So I wasn't very popular during my teenage years. But at least I had "Star Trek." At
least I had pickup lines from Captain Kirk and
William Riker. At least I had Deanna Troi to

Courtesy Star Trek

for his lack of masculinity.
But as my life has meandered into the bottomless pit of work and weed that is
Swarthmore, my beloved "Star Trek" has
departed. Not that it's been gone. "Deep Space

Nine" and "Voyager" were released to keep
the hardcore Trekkies happy. The problem
is that they justreally, really sucked. I mean,
who the hell would make a show about a
space station? A space station doesn't move!
It doesn't go interesting places! Dumbasses.
And most of the women were ugly, too.
"Voyager" started off with potential. The
problem was the show was too much about
being lost and not enough about firing photon torpedoes at the Borgs, those badass villains from "The Next Generation." In fact, the
sole Borg was on the crew! Argh. Okay, she's
hot. But whatever, she has no personality.
Nothing is more depressing than going to a
party and watching 20 desperate guys try to
hop on the one slightly attractive girl in the
room despite the fact that she has the personality of a Rigelian rock slug. So why would
I want to watch an hour of that every week?
I didn't watch either series, which left me
with a few gimmicky movies, including one
where Picard romances a 309-year-old
woman. No, seriously.

So there's a new "Star Trek" series com-

ing out in 2002. Please God, let it not be as
horrible as the last two. Judging by the announced cast, it ain't lookin' real good.

The announced characters are:
Captain Jackson Archer: Supposed to be like
Captain Kirk. I'm sure they'll make him black

or something just to keep things interesting.
Subcommander T'Pau: A female Vulcan.
Logical, boring. They do have sex though.
Logical sex. Let's pause for a second and debate the nature of that. "It would be logical

for you to put that there right now." It's too
bad Data never got with a Vulcan chick. Now
that would have been something to see. Huh
huh, alt.sex.fetish.startrek. There was always
that issue of compatible genitalia too. Maybe
I can direct "Star Trek 7: Entering the Wormhole." And didn't you ever wonder about what
people did on the Holodeck? What the hell was
I talking about anyhow? Oh, T'Pau.
Doctor Phlox: An alien doctor. Should
bring the term "being probed by an alien"
to a new level.
Lt. Commander Malcolm Reed: A British
guy. Scottie was a Lt. Commander with an
accent, but there's no way this guy will approach Scottie's greatness. The Web site describes him as "spit and polish and by-thebook." No word on whether they'll fire him

out the torpedo tube in the first episode, but
I hope it happens.
There will also be a (token) African-American helmsman, a (token) Japanese communications expert and translator and a Southerner. Damn, they must have put a lot of
thought into that.
At least the setting sounds pretty entertaining, described by TrekToday as the 22nd
century, when space travel was a new endeavor and the universe really was still
filled with strange new worlds, new life and
new civilizations." As they have in everyprevious "Star Trek," though, they will surely
figure out how to time travel (it's really, really easy, actually, just slingshot your ship
around the sun so you can get to Warp 10
and arrive precisely where you want to go)
so that William Shatner and James Doohan
can make guest appearances.
In any case, this new series appears to be
a crossroads for the "Star Trek" lineage. With
each piece-of-crap show or movie they produce, they lose loyal viewers like myself and
fail to garner the attention of younger generations, who will now have to turn to brainrotting things like books and fresh air. Let's
hope the next generation does justice to the
original series, Gene Roddenberry and, well,
"The Next Generation."

BY MATT RUBIN
The last time I saw Weezer was in 1997, in California, and
I wound up in the emergency room. Let me explain. Every
time I go to a concert, I wear earplugs for fear of losing my
hearing. That year was the height of my earplug obsession
and, seemingly, of my stupidity as well. Having forgotten my
earplugs at my dorm, I was distraught. So, in an effort to console myself, I decided to use a wadded ball of ticket stub to
plug my ear. Well, by the end of the concert, the stub had
receded into my eardrum, and it wasn't until hours later that
a surgeon removed it on an emergency room operating table.
I awaited the tickets to this year's show, therefore, with
extreme anticipation. Finally, I would be able to avenge
myself. I was going to show these tickets

letters than "Weezer."
Yahoo! also sponsored a depressingly popular series of booths
inside the show, where fans wasted time taking fake pictures
with a cut-up ofRivers Cuomo, Weezer's lead singer.
The new tickets and booths, however, were not the most glaring differences between this show and the last one I saw. I could
have sworn I was at the Warped Tour. There were lots of skaters and hardcore punks, ill-shaven and ill-showered misfits,
pre-pubescent poseurs and post-pubescent parents. What was
missing were the geeks like me who might, on any given day,
play electric guitar and get a ticket stub stuck in an ear.
This all begs the question: what happened to Weezer? The
crowd that I witnessed at the Electric Factory on March 3 was
not what I was expecting, judging by my previous conception
of the band. But maybe it should have been. After all, they
had been absent from the alt-rock scene, all but extinct, before they played the Warped Tour last summer, then opened
for Blink-182 at the Fillmore earlier this year.

Weezer's not dumb. Now that the only things left of Kurt
Cobain's legacy are poor Chris Cornell imitations like Creed and
poor humans like. Fred Durst, they must know that they need a
new audience, especially since Weezer has itselfbeen on hiatus
for over four years. And have they ever found one. This audience was not doing the nerdy Matt Rubin headbob. Rather, they
were moshing during the set break. Apparently, the testosterone
ran so high in these fans that they couldn't resist pummeling
each other to the pre-recorded sounds of AC/DC, Van Halen; and
my personal favorite, Guns N' Roses (rock on, Axl!).
While the crowd was disappointing, the music was not. Even
after a long break, Weezer boasted the same cute, loveable and

geeky rockers. Old classics like "Undone (The Sweater Song)"
and "Buddy Holly" were as catchy as ever, while the ever-epic

"Only in Dreams" was, as it is on that classic, "The Blue CD,"
orgasmic.

Throughout the concert, Weezer seemed to mock its
newfoundaudience and corporate sponsors. One of theshirts
the band was selling referred to the tour as the "Corporate
Sell-Out Tour." Even better, the Weezer set-lists from shows
earlier on the tour, which you can find at weezer.net, mock
popular music by attaching stupid names to Weezer song titles,
like "Undone, the Who Let the Dogs Out Song."
Their opening song was "New Song," a soft, acoustic tune
that highlights vocal melody clearly not what most fans
were looking for. In fact, all of the new songs ofWeezer's upcoming release, which does not have a release date, seemed
to fly in the face of all the new fans. The songs were slower
and sweeter, providing whatlooked like a disappointing break
for the moshing fans "Island of the Sun," with its constant,
rhythmic refrain of "Hip, Hip," was excellent. "Christmas
Song" was a darker number, and "Hash Pipe" was quite the
opposite, a quirky yet angsty vamp-dominated track.
The show's only disappointment was the new song "Don't
Let Go," a tritely poppy song that left my mouth disgustingly
saccharine. Still, the song was notably shorter in Philly than
it had been in D.C. the night before (I was there too), so I
think the band is getting the point: defiance of the corporate
hegemony, which I noticed throughout, supercedes any desire for Britney-Spears-like popularity.
Halfway through the show, Pat, the bass player, began
having bass problems, and theband stopped playing for about
ten minutes, and, therefore, forewent their pre-encore break.
But I can't really say I was disheartened by this result, as it
occurred during the one Yahoo! Live webcast of the tour, and
it must have been a severe disappointment to have so much
space in the middle without an encore. This problem seemed
so appropriate for the show that one has to wonder if Weezer
may have staged it on purpose.

TO
DO

the plan
for this

week:

exist

BY MORGHAN HOLT, WHO ALWAYS WRITES THE "TO DO" BLURBS BUT ALMOST NEVER GETS CREDIT

How badly do I need this break? In a torrent of papers, activities, classwork and exams, the first halfof
the semester somehow snuck up on me and, come tomorrow night, will be gone. As always, I'm left wondering where the time went. How the hell is it possible that spring break is already upon us?
Not that I'm complaining. For reasons pertaining
to general physical health and mental stability, I'm in
desperate need of a break. I would like to sleep. I miss
my bed and I'm tired of being teased with four measly
hours of half-sleep before the sun rises and my alarm
clock screams in my ear. I'm in dire need of a week
without alarms. Or meetings. And I'm dying to watch
just 15 uninterrupted minutes of trashy TV, not necessarily because I like it, but because I like knowing I
have the time to spare, especially when I realize that

the last six weeks have passed without even allowing
me time to make plans for spring break.
That's right. Due to lack of time to stop and actually consider spring break and its many possibilities,
and due to lack of foresight on my part (I was barely
aware of its approach), I will be spending my spring
break right here at Swat. More specifically, I will be
spending my Spring Break in Willets 224, with no obligations apart from operating the remote, catching
up on global current events and occasionally hauling
myself out of bed just long enough to heat some
Spaghettios. My plans: the barest essentials. I will
sleep. I will eat. I will stimulate my brain as little as
humanly possible.

As I pass crowds gathered outside McCabe, engaged
in excited discussion of their plans for break, I find
myself surprisingly content with my default decision

to spend the week on campus. I'm glad, as ridiculous
as it sounds, thatI'm not repeating last year and boarding a plane for Mardi Gras, nor attending any other
major event. I'm thrilled that I'm not an athlete, that I
won't be joining any of our many fine teams in their
treks to uncharted tropical paradises, or some humid
locale of that general nature. I am so eager for utter
lethargy that I'm actually happy I don't have anywhere
to go. I don't even want to deal with the plane-boarding process, let alone try to socialize with normal, nonSwat people. It just seems like such a hassle. Frankly,
I'd rather bond with Jerry Springer while lying lazy

and unshowered in my bed.
And, while the Movie Committee won't be showing any spectacular flicks this weekend and I won't
have the pleasure of attending any fulfilling Phi Psi
parties, there are plenty of things to do in Philly, should
I get the unlikely urge to leave the confines of my room,
or, rather, the confines of my sheets. I could, for instance, spend all day Saturday exploring the artistic
creations of Alice Neel, whose work is currently exhibited at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Only I'd
be missing some good Saturday morning cartoons, the
ones I've had a hankering for since I watched my last
episode of"The Powerpuff Girls" before returning from
Christmas break. So I guess that's out.
Likewise, a certain Jennifer Blaine will perform

her one-woman stand-up comic routine in Bryn Mawr
on March 15, but, as renowned as she is for her hilarious performances, there'll probably be some pressing
sitcom-viewing to be done that evening from the best
of all venues, my bed. Again, I guess that's out. And,
as Philly is a large city bustling with entertainment
options, there are scads of other things to do and see,
but, honestly, I haven't given them much thought.
Even the SEPTA ride seems an unnecessary stressor.
I'm fully intent on spending this week in the laziest
fashion possible. That is, my roommate
also stuck
here by default and eager to join me in my mindless
will be lucky if I make it out of
programming buffet
my pajamas. But there's no shame in that. In fact, I
highly recommend the same as an alternative healing
method for the cluttered brains and frazzled nerves I've
recently seen my fellow symptomatic Swatties sporting. Regardless of your spring break plans, I urge you
to relish random moments, unmarred by thoughts of
impending paper deadlines or obscene midterm exams
(unless, of course, your professors are cruel enough to
wait until after break to test your retention of the first
half of their lectures in which case, it sucks to be
you). Whether you're boarding a plane for some exciting destination, bumming around our frigid campus or
...

catching rays in sunny California, relax, allow yourself some quality time with the television set and, for
God's sake, sleep. Before you know it, the week will be
gone and our noses will be pressed against the grindstone harder, if that's possible, than ever before.

FUTURE

Angry Quakers begin purge

MARCH 22, 2001, SWARTHMORE, Pa.
As the bell tower chimed at noon last

Sunday, residents of Parrish dorm
watched as a seething batallion ofPendle
Hill Quakers stormed up Magill Walk.
Armed with moral indignation and unloaded .30-caliber rifles, the pacifist militia forced its way into the Admissions
Office and stated its intention to reinstate a Quaker regime at the college.
Pendle Hill spokesperson Charles Ezra
Groom 'OO spoke to the stunned tour
groups: "Lo, we have heard the meek
voices of thy oppressed sportspersons and
thy Phoenix columnists, and have come
to bear witness to their plaintive cries.
Forsooth, tell me, are they not also children of God? What willst thou say,
Friends, except to bow thy heads in
shame, when thine appointed hour
cometh? For salvation and deliverance, we
have come to kick ass in the name of the
Lord. Hallelujah!"
It began only a few months ago. Nonsectarian for nearly a century, a blaze of
Quakerism scorched the campus when
the Board of Managers outraged
Swarthmore's silent majority ofFriends.
The Board's decision to resolve an athletic crisis by a vote led to a fury of controversy, as well as to repetitive invoca-

Dear Students,
As you know, the Board of Managers recently recognized the Quaker Review Committee, and permitted it to make recommendations to strengthen the intra-collegiate Quaker
program and its relationship to the academic
mission of the College.
We are writing to let you know that at its
meeting on campus today the Board endorsed
the following recommendations form the Committee:
1 To grant priority to Quaker talent and interest in enrolling 70 to 85% of each entering
class;
And in order to strengthen the quality of our

intra-collegiate Quaker program,
2. To reduce the number of intra-collegiate
religions from more than one to one, by removing Catholicism, Judaism , Islam and all other
forms of Protestantism, Hinduism, Buddhism
and Paganism from the intra-collegiate program,
and to provide the remaining religion, Quakerism, with enhanced support for recruiting.
The Board deeply regretted the need to act
more rapidly than anticipated, especially in
reaching a conclusion so painful for many in
the College community. They believed, however, that it was urgent to define the future of
the intra-collegiate religious program before
prospective students for next year's entering

We might make

which the college

was founded
the
beloved ideals on
which our daily
lives and routines

are patterned.
"Dude, last week's
Meeting was so enlightening,"
remarked one sophomore. "I really felt
that there was that of God in everyone present, except that vile
Keith." This sentiment was
shared by all present, and with
open arms the student body welcomed the return to the Quaker
tradition.
The Pendle Hill Quakers quickly
established an iron-fisted, univer
salist theocracy that sought to rec
ognize all parties' voices, gather the
facts in a peaceful way, and swiftly,
efficiently crush all dissent. They
established a Quaker Review Committee, which offered free organic
chai to anyone willing to bring forth

evidence of anti-Quaker activity on
campus. Meeting in the former Kohlberg
Coffee Bar, now dubbed the Lucretia Mott
Center for Silent Contemplation, the
group attracted a massive and boisterous
following. Its first order of business was
to determine the exact extent of Quaker
devotion at Swarthmore and the offenses

suffered by the Friends at the hands of an
undiscriminating and heretical administration.
The group released its findings in a reserved-students e-mail, the contents of
which are repeated below:

MARCH 08,

2001

Fervor mounted.
Fevers ran high. The
unloaded weapons
riled to the ceilings of Willets basenent. "This is so great!" exhorted one
sportsperson. "Now we'll finally get
the kind of informed, enlightened, In-

ner Light-based decision-making for
which we came to Swarthmore." A
faction of students, in fact, claimed
to be so filled with the spirit of God
that they successfully petitioned the
QRC to punish students in possession
of alcohol with month-long pillory. A
flurry of enthusiastic support, documented on the Daily Jolt Forum, immediately ensued. Unfortunately, rumors surfaced shortly thereafter that
a group of international students
were holding secret resistance meetings
in Paces. They were escorted to the Meeting
House for "re-education," or, as the Quakers
say, "eldering."
The ardent Quaker converts condemned
the actions of the Paces group in loud and
ringing tones. "They had no business de-

stroying our consensus, the reactionary sons
of bitches!" quoth an anonymous Daily Jolt
Brother. A wave of like feeling spread across
the campus last week as more and more students poured forth from their dormitories to
join the righteous group rallying on Parrish
Beach, chanting "Down with Paces! Burn

THE PHOENIX

Satan's den of iniquity to the ground!"
Alarmed by the reputed attempts of
student Quaker activists to demolish

Paces, the QRC issued a brief manifesto
in which it called for another inquiry to
lay bare the actuality of Swarthmore's
commitment to Quakerism:
"We on the QRC feel it necessary to
lay bare the actuality of Swarthmore's
commitment to Quakerism. At Pendle
Hill we merely march with our unloaded
arms and hold silent worship with spontaneous vocal ministry. We do not burn.
We do not pillage. We do not cheer. We
returned to Swarthmore to liberate our
Brothers professing to be bounded by the
godless and the profane College population. However, we on the QRC find ourselves questioning the methods and motivations of thy fervid outcry. We shall get
to the bottom of this debacle. We ask
Swarthmore one question: who among ye
are children of the Light, and who among
ye are but the devil's handmaidens?"
Desperate to prove their Quaker commitment, students in bonnets fell upon the
Meeting House and spanked the Paces offenders. Although people began to feel
more and more alarmed, the purge of what
the Pendle Hill authorities referred to as
"the perversion of our good faith" spread.
An atmosphere reminiscent of late 17thcentury Salem prevailed as neighbor
turned against neighbor, each seeking to
escape the inquisitors by more and more
avidly declaring their fanatic Quakerism.
"I protested Boxing for Leukemia Relief!"
screamed one student on trial, "but I know
people who attended! It was them!Them!"
Events culminated in a rally and
candlelight vigil

on Parrish Beach, with

deafening spontaneous vocal worship.
"Fight, fight, for the Inner Light! Kill,
Quakers, kill!"
Amidst the clamor, no one seemed to
notice the shadowy figures of several
Haverford students smoking in a sinister
fashion on the periphery of the riot.

Spike: So tell us about your match. You
had a prior agreement with your opponent
to not hit each other in the face, right?
Alice: Yeah, we had agreed a couple of
days beforehand to not punch in the head,
and then right before the match we
specified that we wouldn't hit above the
shoulders. Basically, it was a no-face rule.
Spike: That sounds very peaceful and
civilized.
Alice: Well, my opponent was worried
that aggression would take over in the ring,
after watching the first fights and looking
at the mood of the crowd. We tried to
communicate during our match, and yeah,
we threw a few soft punches at each
other's faces, but we didn't use any real
force, we weren't as vicious as some of
the others.
Spike: And for this, everyone was

screaming abuse at you.

Alice: Yeah, the announcer was yelling,

"We want to see some blood!" Everyone
in the crowd was yelling, "Punch her in the

face, we want head shots!" and all the time
we were trying to mouth to each other, "No
face! No face!"
Spike: And after your match?
Alice: It was really disappointing,
because the judges decided the fight was
so lame that they wouldn't announce a
winner, so we didn't get to do the whole
thing with going into the ring and getting
our hands held up. At least nobody came
up to me afterwards and said "Why didn't
you punch her in the face?!" I was afraid
that would happen, what with the, um...

Jay grabs three school records
Runner off to nationals
after stellar indoor season
BY ANNA

MASILELA

There'll be no relaxing around the fam-

ily hearth or sunning with friends in

Cancun for Sarah Jay 'Ol this spring
break. Instead, the co-captain of the
women's indoor track team will be in
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, running the 1500meter race in the NCAA Division 111 Nationals. This season, Jay became a school
record holder in the mile, the 4xBoo relay,
the distance medley relay, and the 1500.
Her time in the 1500, 4:55:30, was a 10-second (incredible in track time) improvement over the time posted by the winner
at the Centennial Conference Championships last year.
Striving to be an athlete at
Swarthmore can definitely be a struggle,
but it is a challenge that Jay has handled
with finesse. Except for the spring of 1999,
when she studied abroad, she has competed every single season for the past four
years: soccer in the fall, indoor track during the winter and outdoor track in the
spring. In doing so, she has had to forgo
opportunities taken for granted by other
Swarthmore students, such as attending

lectures or doing community service.
"Giving up those things is really hard
because I want to do them and the
[Swarthmore] community wants me to do
them," she says. "Meanwhile, I'm choosing to dedicate my time and energy to activities that some people on this campus
think are not as worthwhile."
The paradox made Jay question her decisions. "I wondered if I was wasting my
time, wondered if I was being selfish since
I was doing things that would only benefit me, wondered if I was just buying into
the American construction of sports." She
analyzed and agonized, in true
Swarthmore fashion, and finally decided

"GIVING UP NON-SPORTS
ACTIVITIES IS REALLY
HARD BECAUSE I WANT
TO DO THEM AND THE
[SWARTHMORE]

COMMUNITY WANTS ME
TO DO THEM.
MEANWHILE, I'M

CHOOSING TO DEDICATE
MY TIME AND ENERGY

TO ACTIVITIES THAT
SOME PEOPLE ON THIS
CAMPUS THINK ARE NOT
AS WORTHWHILE."
that if it made her happy, even if it was
something that she did for herself, it
would pay off for her in the long run.
Nevertheless, Jay looks at her decision
to pursue running with good-natured
wonderment. Recently, her friend, track
guru and fellow co-captain Joko Agunloye

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Sarah Jay has played a varsity sport every season she has been on campus.
'Ol, passed her a book about their sport
that really summarized her feelings. It
said that runners enter into their torture willingly: though they can stop
and leave anytime, they want to keep
on going to see how long it lasts. Nevertheless, it is a torture that Jay can't
live without. Her friends know to avoid
her until she's had her run, because
her mood can be toxic. "I guess that's
what happens when you're addicted to
endorphins," says Jay.
Although her feelings toward sports
are complex, Jay definitely thinks
there are ways that sports pay back
dividends beyond the glory on the
field. "In a way, it really is a privilege
to come to this campus your freshman
year and have friends with whom to
dance at parties or eat at Sharpies." In
addition, it give her a much needed respite from the daily grind of class, a
change of scene that affects her not just
mentally but also physically. "The
work gets done and it gets done well,
since the mind is fresh after a workout. You're always working the yin and
the yang, the body and the mind."
Jay has also found that her teammates are part of a community of
women who are not afraid to go the extra mile. "Many women on this campus aren't proud of their bodies, or negate their bodies, but the girls who
have been my teammates glory in their
flesh. They get a kick out of working

out and they are vital." Jay knows
many of her competitors during the

track season, so the community extends even beyond the boundaries
of the Swarthmore campus. During
her freshman year, her main competitor and, in her words, "arch
nemesis", was Samantha Tubman
from Haverford. It finally came
down to the final of the 800 in outdoor track, when both were going
for fourth place. "I really whipped
her. I am super competitive sometimes and it is very freeing to pin
it down on some worthy girl that
I've decided to walk down that sea-

son."

For Jay, who came to Swat
thinking that running was just
something to do during the soccer
offseason to keep in shape, the experience has been gratifying. "I
never thought when I started running that I would be able to compete on this level, so it's like the culmination of a dream I never knew
I had," she says. In her four years
at Swat, she shaved 28 seconds from
her first college 1500 meter time,
and that half a minute is taking her
to Wisconsin. "I'm making the trip
to Oshkosh with a lot of thankful-

ness that I've gotten this far and
lots of thanks to my teammates and
my coaches who have put me in
this position."

B-ball finishes 23-5
BY EMILY GRAY AND

CAITLIN

RYLAND

Despite dropping their second-round
NCAA Division 111 Championship Tournament game against Elizabethtown College by a 21-point deficit, 79-58, the
Swarthmore women walked out of the
gym with heads held high. Though the
basketball team couldn't quite pull out the
win over such a formidable foe, the players were consoled by a 23-5 season record
(12-3 in the Centennial Conference).
Nerves and quick fouls set the tone for
what was to be a shaky first half for the

women of the Garnet Tide. Swarthmore
committed an uncharacteristic 19 turnovers in just the first period. The
Elizabethtown Blue Jays capitalized on
Garnet jitters in the frontand backcourt,
and by the time the halftime buzzer
sounded they lead by a tally of 35-26.
The hole that Swarthmore had dug itself into in the first half was one that the
team would never claw its way out of, and
the mental game had much to do with it.
"We faced some tough match-ups and the
game just didn't go our way," said Katie
Robinson 'O4. But she "was really proud
of the fact that we never gave up and

played our hearts out the entire 40 min-

utes."
Sarah Tufano 'O3 had a team-high 18
points. Heather Kile 'O2 and Ali Furman
'O3 connected for 16 and 12 points, respectively. Furman, in a performance reminiscent of her Centennial Conference
Championship show, shot 80 percent (4 of
5) from three-point land. Tri-captain
Heather Marandola 'Ol dished out a teamhigh five assists in her final game of her
collegiate career.
While the team will certainly mourn
the loss of lone senior Marandola (but
not before they catch her in action on the
softball field), they are excited about the
prospect of returning a nearly-complete
squad next year. Building on the experience of this year's team, the women are

anticipating a wave of bright-eyed,
bushy-tailed freshmen recruits jumping
at a chance to be a part of this fairytale
story. Preseason chatter about making
a run for a berth in the NCAA tournament materialized into a conference
championship that guaranteed that tournament berth and a more-than-hoped-for
second round appearance in the national
tournament.

OUT OF
LEFT FIELD
The spring sports season is scheduled to be underway.
Unfortunately, snow is covering all of the playing fields
and you're getting reeeeeal sick of the fieldhouse. So what
do you do? Do you sit on your lazy ass and twiddle your
thumbs while you watch the snow fall? Or do you put those
thumbs to good use (while still sitting on your lazy ass)
and play the next best thing to real sports: video games?
With the help of Ken Kim and Ted Chan, I have compiled a
list of some of the best (and worst) sports video games of
all time.
Note: I narrowed my sights to only include older games.
While more recent games have better graphics and more
features, they retain the appeal of the new. The games listed
below have been able to pass the test of timeand truly deserve to be considered classics.
Hoops:

Double Dribble (NES): Remember whenblack and white
slow motion dunk sequences were soooo cool?
Arch Rivals (NES, arcade): Bare-knuckle brawls, fluorescent green mohawks, and a look at the cheerleaders after
every basket. The Y-chromosome of the NBA Jam fetus.
Worst: Lakers Versus Celtics series (Genesis): It took
players almost the entire shot clock just to dribble down
the court at top speed. A glitch in the game would count
Dominique Wilkins' windmill jam, whether he made it or
not, allowing for 4-point plays.
Best: NBA Jam (arcade, SNES): Theyreplaced Shaq with
Nick Anderson, they never even had Jordan and it was
still an instant classic it was so popular that it called for
spin-offs in other sport genres (see Blitz and Open Ice).
Hockey:

Ice Hockey (NES): Would you like skinny, medium, or
fat with your order of zambonis?
NHL Open Ice (arcade): Another NBA Jam rip-off, but
easily the most exciting hockey game I've ever seen. There
was nothing like cross-checking an opponent halfway

across the ice.
Worst: Who really cares? It's hockey. They all pretty
much sucked, except for...
Best: Tie: Blades of Steel (NES): "Blades of Steel ching!"
Forget trying to score goals —just crash into the opponent
until you instigate a fight. How brilliant was it for them to
actually set up a separate boxing-like sequence for on-ice
scuffles?
Baseball:
Little League World Series (NES): You could play as Cali-

School spirit. From left, Scott Grant, Dave Thomas, Ben Keys, Emily Wilkins, Josh Lindsay,
Leslie Fox, Jon Konits, Pat Thrasher, Scott Kushner and Sam Picard.

Video games solve snow woes
fornia, Chinese Taipei, or Australia. The kids actually cried
when they got hit by a pitch and two overly developed cheerleaders congratulated you after a home run. Excuse me, but
why didn't my little league team have two busty blondes cheering us around the bases?
RBI Baseball (NES): The classic baseball game. This was
madeback when Clemens was on the BoSox, Gooden and Straw
weren't crackheads, and Puckett could see.
Worst: Baseball (NES): No creativity in the name, no creativity in the game. This one was actually a chore to play.
Also, one in every 100 throws would move at an impossibly
slow speed. For instance, a throw from the center fielder to
the second baseman would hover in the air for 20 seconds,
allowing the runners to circle the bases.
Best: Baseball Stars (NES): This game was WAY ahead of
its time. The features included: create a player, create a team,
buy free agents, upgrade players, play as Hall of Famers, play
as girls, scale the wall, and save a season. This game singlehandedly caused me to break two keys on my computer from
aggressive "swinging" (damned Nintendo emulators).
Racing: Let me preface this section by saying there are
WAY too many good racing games out there for me to include
them all. But lest you think I have forgotten about your personal favorites, I will quickly list some other racing greats:
SpyHunter, Out Run, RC Pro Am, Roadßlaster, etc.
Super Off Road (SNES, arcade): Nothing was more coveted
that a nitro when you were trying to maneuver past Ivan

"Ironman" Stewart in the silver truck.
Daytona USA (arcade): There's nothing better than lining
up against seven of your friends and then proceeding to ram
each one of them into the wall at the dreaded Turn Two.
Excitebike (NES): Don't tell me you forgot about this game.
The ability to create a course coupled with the fun of cutting
off opposing riders makes this game a classic.
Worst: Hard Drivin' (arcade, Genesis): While some of you
may have fond memories of this game, let me remind you what
it entailed: it cost 50 cents to play (when every other game
only cost 25 cents); it required the ability to work a clutch and
use a stick shift, which, at age 10, most kids were not able to
do; and it had impossible control issues the slightest wheel
turn would send you careening off the track and into the barn.
In fact, the only cool things about this game were the instant
replay and the loop on the stunt course. The loop would almost always send you crashing to your death and make for
one helluva instant replay. Unfortunately, your time continued to expire as you watched the instant replay, making your
total playing time about 12 seconds.
Best: Mario Kart (SNES, N64): Talk about a game that brings
people together. The tracks are unique, the weapons range
from useless to unfair, the computer assistance makes every

finish down to the wire, and the four-player mode is
suhweeeet.
Football:
Tecmo Bowl (NES): Simple: 4 plays to choose from. Offensive play defensive play interception/sack/run for
loss. Offensive play defensive play TD. And as much as
I hate the Raiders, how sweet was the Marcus Allen/Bo
Jackson tandem?
NFL Blitz (arcade): One of the NBA Jam-esque games
in which rules are thrown out the window and the fun factor is turned on recockulous. And I'm almost certain that
I actually heard one of the players exclaim "We're gonna
kick your fucking ass" after making a vicious hit.
Worst: 10 Yard Fight (NES): According to this game, the
fastest players in the NFL run a 10.7 40-yard dash.
Best: Tie-every Madden game ever made (with the exception of Madden64-1998 which is a disgrace to all Maddens) (various platforms): In '93, nobody could tackle you
if you were doing the spin move. In '94, we discovered that
with EA Sports, "It's in the game." In '96, we were treated
with create-a-player, the wishbone option, and the World
League teams. And '99 gave us our first taste at running a
franchise. The Madden series is the standard by which all
football games (and all sports games for that matter) are
measured. It has spawned its own culture of loyal Madden-followers (of which I am a card-carrying member). In
fact, I was planning on doing an entire column dedicated
to Madden until I found out that somebody has already
done it (http://www.videogames.com/features/universal/

hist_madden).
Other Sports:
Duck Hunt (NES): Yuk it up dog...see if you get to eat
any of the ducks I DO hit.
Mike Tyson's Punch Out (NES): Can you say "Greatest
game EVER?" It took years of practice to finally be Super
Macho Man, only to last 27 seconds against Iron Mike.

Thass Ludacwis!

Super Dodge Ball (NES): Almost as fun as knocking a
kid's block off in PE class.
T & C Surf Design (NES): Whoa, dude. This is like totally the greatest game ever. You can ride waves and skateboard, and you can be that gnarly dude, Joe Cool.
Track and Field with Power Pad (NES): Finally, a sports
game that actually does assess athletic skill.
FIFA (Genesis, SNES): Gooooooooaaaaal!!! Electronic
Arts' FIFA series is to soccer as Madden is to football.
Wrestlefest (arcade): Dogpile on top of a weary Mr. Perfect to eliminate him from the Royal Rumble, or team the
Ultimate Warrior with "The Million Dollar Man" Ted
Dißiase to challenge the Legion of Doom for the tag titles.

Where is the virtue

I Fairleigh-Dickinson

in professional
sports?
Former Chief Justice Earl Warren once remarked,
"The sports page records people's accomplishments; the
front page nothing but their failures." He also put Americans of Japanese descent into internment camps. What
do his actions suggest? Well, in short, Warren wasn't
exactly a flawless actor or thinker especially when
making judgments about sports. Indeed, the sports world
is not always a Crystal Palace of perfection. The following are examples of common misconceptions about the
virtues of sports and athletes.
The Honorable Earl Warren: "The sports page records

people's accomplishments..."

UTAH JAZZ CENTER OLDEN
POLYNICE ALL SEVEN FEET
OF HIM ACTUALLY MANAGED
TO IMPERSONATE A POLICE
OFFICER ON TWO SEPARATE
-

-

OCCASIONS.

Associated Press Headline: "Polynice Impersonates
Officer Again"
Conclusion: Okay. Utah Jazz center Olden Polynice
all seven feet of him did manage to impersonate a
police officer on two separate occasions, apparently at■j, tempting to intimidatemotorists whose driving acumen
was well below Polynice's standards. Although one may
consider the impersonation an achievement of sorts, its
only accomplishment was inducing laughter by revealing Olden's own stupidity: not only did he get caught
(probably because he doesn't look like the typical police officer), but he also attempted impersonation after
he was initially arrested. I don't think that's the sort of
accomplishment for which Earl Warren praised sports.
Legendary Coach John Wooden: "Sports do not build
character. They reveal it."
Associated Press Headline: "Blazers' Grant Charged
with Drunken Driving"
Conclusion: Driving drunk did a lot more to reveal
Gary Grant's character than did warming the bench and
throwing an orange ball into a basket while wearing
mesh shorts and a tank top.
Percy Cerutty (Australian track coach): "The mastery of
the true self, and the refusal to permit others to dominateus,
is the ultimate in living and self-expression in athletics."
Associated Press Headline: "Sheffield Rips Dodgers,
Teammates in National Article"
Conclusion: Way to prevent others from dominating
you, Gary. When Cerutty praised such an action, I don't
thinkhe wished to imply that bashing one's teammates is
the best way to master oneself. After all, baseball is a team
sport, so maybe Gary could best prevent others (i.e., other
teams) from dominating him by working with his own
teammates to win games and, perhaps, a World Series.
Cats: "All your base are belong to us."
George Steinbrenner: "Absolutely not. All your base
are belong to me." (Paraphrase)
Conclusion: Once again, a common, idyllic perception of sports is erroneous. Steinbrenner recently confirmed his single-handed domination of the game of

*

baseball when he re-signed Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter,
Jorge Posada, Luis Sojo and PaulO'Neill and added star
free agent Mike Mussina to his roster all in the hopes
of claiming the fourth straight and 27th all-time World
Series championship for the Yankees.

Scott Grant prepares while doubles partner Jayson Yost serves it up against Fairleigh-Dickinson. Grant and Yost won
their match 8-6 to help the Garnet gain the doubles point. Swarthmore beat FDU 6-1

BY MIKE NOREIKA
The men's tennis team hosted the Division I Knights of
Fairleigh-Dickinson this past Saturday. The Knights consistently finish at the top of the Northeastern Conference and
have won the conference title six times in the last decade. After
having the previous weekend off, the Garnet was pristine and
anticipated a tough match with the Fairleigh-Dickinson foes.
With prodigious effort from all the Garnet players, the team
overwhelmed the FDU team 6-L
The Garnet tore into the Knights right from the onset,
sweeping all three doubles matches, thus securing the important first team point. At No. 1 doubles, Pete Schilla 'Ol and
John Thomas 'O2 played through difficultiesearly on, but later
found their game to win 8-6. The second doubles team of Scott
Grant 'Ol and Jayson Yost 'O3, in similar fashion, defeated a
much smaller and overpowered Fairleigh-Dickinson tandem
8-6. Sophomore Justin Singer 'O3 and Frank Visciano 'O4
snubbed a rather ineffectual duo 8-1 in a match that lasted
only 30 minutes. After winning all three doubles contests, the
Garnet went with confidence into the singles matches.
At second singles, Thomas, with a new racket in hand, defeated the Knight's ChristianKoskorelos 6-3,7-6 (7-2). This was
Thomas' second win in as many matches at the No. 2 spot this
season for the Garnet. Singer had a scare in his match at No.
3 singles, dropping the first set to Todd Gordon. Singer bounced
back and wore his opponent down, winning 6-2.6-2 in the next

two sets. Grant stepped it up to win easily over his vanquished FDU foe, 6-2, 6-2.
In his singles match, Yost, in a manner reminiscent of
two weeks ago, won the first set in a tiebreaker and stormed
to a 6-0 second-set triumph. The visibly upset FairleighDickinson opponent, Kivanch Cubokeu, who usually plays
No. 1 singles for the Knights, tried Yost's patience, with a
number of questionable calls and out-of-control shots. But
Yost defeated the vexatious Cubokeu withthe placidity and
mental toughness necessary to overcome such a poor

sportsman.
Visciano, coming off of a very quick doubles win,
crushed the Knights' Paul Wawuyreh 6-0,6-0 in just under
an hour. Visciano, having only played a total of an hour
and a half s worth of matches, said, "The Knights' talent
regressed after the-first couple guys, and with the depth
[the Garnet] has, we were simply too much for them in

singles. Our remarkable depth is an ideal feature for areturn trip to Nationals this season."
With their second win in as many attempts over a Division I school this season, the Garnet heads further into the
season gaining more confidence with each and every outing. The Garnet, now 2-0 for the season, travels into Philadelphia on Wed., March 7 to play the University of Pennsylvania Quakers. Next week, it is off to California where
the Garnet will play four tough California schools, including UC-Berkeley and UC-Davis.
