Prudent investments shield endowment
BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

Although Swarthmore's endowment of approximately
$l4 billion has dropped to just under $l2 billion because of
the recent economic crisis, administrators say Swarthmore
will fare relatively well in the coming months due to its prudent investment policies.
According to an October 21 memo by Vice President for
Finances and Treasurer Suzanne Welsh, the college's financial management policies focus on sustainability through
difficulttimes. These policies, such as investing much of the
endowment in secure Treasury Bonds and maintaining a
low endowment spending rate, have ensured that the college is well-positioned going into this period.
"What I feel comfortable about is that the college is by
nature prudent," Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l said.
"Maybe it's a trait lasting from our Quaker tradition, but I
think we are managing well right now because we've managed well in the past."

Welsh said Swarthmore has weathered similar financial
situations before. "The endowment is now a bit under $l2
billion, which is what it was at the 2005 level. We lost about
$2OO million, but you have to keep it in perspective," she
said. "We experienced this sort of volatility with the
dot.com bust, and we got through that." Since the endowment funds the majority of the college's budget, Welsh said
safety mechanisms are in place to protect the endowment in
times of economic hardship. "Our budget is approximately
$ll2 million this year, and a lot of how we pay that comes
from the endowment, which is the largest source of revenue
in the budget," she said. "We try to determine a level of
endowment spending that we can sustain through the ups
and downs of the economy. I think our other policies have
put us in a good position for this environment."
Welsh said the current budget will not face cuts. "I don't
anticipate a change in this year's budget," she said. "The
budget process for next year is just starting, so we have
some months to assess how things are progressing [with the
economy] before decisions have to be made for next year."
At the faculty meeting this Friday, Welsh plans to discuss
the impact of current financial market conditions on
Swarthmore. "There is a lot to think about, but the bottom
line is that we've had very prudent policies in all different
aspects of spending, and that's positioned us very well. We
can get through this," she said. "At the faculty meeting, I'll
%robably give them a general update and answer questions."

Economics Professor Mark Kuperberg said that although
a recession is guaranteed at this point, he is not expecting to
see drastic, immediatechanges at Swarthmore. "The fallhas
been very dramatic across the country. There will be a recession for sure," he said. "Friday at the faculty meeting I'm not
expecting it to be scary. The scary things they could say
would be that we're facing cuts, but I'm not expecting the
talk to be scary."

"The bottom line is that we've had
very prudent policies in all different
aspects of spending, and that's
positioned us very well. We can get
through this."
Suzanne Welsh
Vice President for Finances and
Treasurer
As for next year's budget, it's still too early to predict how
Swarthmore will reapportion its finances, Welsh said. "It's
hard to know what the budget will look like next year
because the board ultimately decides. We are doing a lot of
modeling of scenarios," she said. "There was a mild and
short-lived recession of 2001-2002 that we got through and
didn't feel too much. We didn't add a lot of new programs
during that time, but we didn't make major cuts during that
time either."
Kuperberg.said the college would probably cut back in
some areas in reaction to the recession. "We might have to
put some of our pie-in-the-sky plans on hold," he said. "The
fact is, stocks have been overvalued since 1996. Even when
they fell after the dot.com scare, they were still overvalued. We're returning to Earth, in essence, and now we need
to live on Earth."
Welsh said that the current economic conditions will
probably affect other parts of Swarthmore, including
Financial Aid and Development. "I think there might be an
increased need for Financial Aid, especially if parents on
Wall Street lost their jobs and now need Financial Aid," she

said. "I think we can expect to see some impact on giving. It's
early yet."

Suneal Bedi 'O9 said college students will be affected in a
number of ways as the financial crisis continues to grow.
"The way the crisis is affecting people our age is mainly with
our ability to get loans. Banks are charging really high interestrates, and as students we don'thave credit, so ifI have to
get loans for Swarthmore or grad school it's really hard," he
said.
"I'm not applying for a job right now, but it's also really
hard to get jobs," Bedi said. "Since it's not a good time to go
into the job market, many students are deciding to go into
graduate school, making it really competitive, or substantially more competitive, to get into different professional
schools."
Eldridge said the college is focusing on containing the
scope of the crisis at the institutional level. "I think our philosophy is that we have our eye on supporting the college in
the present, and we want to provide enough to support the
college in the future," he said. "Our investment managers
have made wise decisions and are continuing to make wise
decisions, but if this goes on forever everyone will be in trouble."
Swarthmore is hardly the only college to be affected by
the financial crisis. Endowments across the country have
taken a hit, leading to projected tuition increases at colleges
across the country. According to an Oct. 3 story in The
Boston Globe, "Financial chaos threatens to besiege universities," public universities will be especially impacted by the
economic downturn, as state governments lower their education subsidies.
This comes at a time when student loans are increasingly difficult to come by, which has led to a rise in requests for
student aid. As a result of this, Congress has passed legislation increasing federal money for student aid.
The financial crisis has also forced numerous schools to
put a halt to proposed construction projects. Carleton
College has halted the construction of its Arts Union building. "Right now, we simply need to have greater clarity
about the world financial situation before committing to a
new timeline; any other response to the last three weeks'
events would be irresponsible," the administration said in
an e-mail circulated to the student body. Other schools, such
as Boston University, have responded to the financial crisis
by freezing both construction and hiring processes.

New Pa. anti-smoking law raises questions about tobacco on campus
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edu

On Sept. 11, 2008, a new anti-smoking
law went into effect in Pennsylvania amid
ongoing
discussions
within
the
Swarthmore community concerning the
presence of smoking on campus. The bill,
called the Clean Indoor Air Act, bans smoking in most indoor public places.
Exemptions to the law include bars where
less than 20 percent of sales are food and
certain areas on casino floors.
According to Assistant Dean of
Residential Life Rachel Head, the law will
not compel the college to revise its current
smoking policies because Swarthmore was
"already in compliance with that law
before it was passed," she said. However,
other colleges and universities in
Pennsylvania, particularly some state
schools, are legally required to tighten
their smoking regulations. After Governor
Edward Rendell signed the law, the chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of
Higher Education decided to ban outdoor
smoking at all 14 of Pennsylvania's stateowned universities.
While the administration has not taken
concrete measures to revise the college's
current smoking policy, the subject has definitely been "on people's minds," according

THE PHOENIX

to Head, who added that the issue is of concern to numerous departments and comparticularly
mittees,
the Housing

Committee. "There are a lot of offices that
would [need to] be involved in any discussion of the issue
it will be discussed by
the Housing Committee at their next meeting," Head said.
According to Head, if the school were to
adjust its rules, one possible change might
be a decrease in the number of smoking
dorm rooms on campus, as members of the
administration have questioned whether
student demand is sufficient to justify the
number of accommodations for smokers.
"There don't seem to be a lot of people on
campus who smoke and those who do tend
to be pretty considerate about it," Head
said, although she noted that some parents
have expressed concern over the presence
of tobacco smoke in student dorms.
Over the summer, according to Head,
the housing office received several calls
from parents whose first year students had
been placed in smoking dorms. These
callers wanted to know if smokers in these
dorms are subject to any restrictions.
Head confirmed that such restrictions are
indeed in place.
Students are not permitted to smoke in
any of the common areas of smoking
dorms, such as hallways and lounges,
...

although they may smoke in their own
rooms so long as they do so with the door
closed and with the consent of their room-

mates.

Worth Health Center Director Beth
Kotarski said in an e-mail message that one
of the goals of health services at
Swarthmore is "reducing disability, disease and time away from school related
activities because of smoking (and secondhand smoking) related illness." According
to Kotarski, Worth's health fair, along with
the Student Health Advisory Council, "providers] smoking cessation information and
we provide referrals year round to students
who wish to kick the habit."
Kotarski said that Pennsylvania's latest
anti-smoking law will be most beneficial to
non-smokers who live and work in proximity to smokers and therefore suffer the
effects of secondhand smoke, known withthe
medical
as
in
community
Environmental Tobacco Smoke.
"I think we have to respect the research
now that secondhand smoke is dangerous
to the innocent bystanders in smokers'
lives. The newer laws like the one in
Pennsylvania are beginning to address
this," she said, noting that the demographic groups most vulnerable to secondhand
smoke are infants, asthmatics and the eld-

erly.

October 23, 2008

Kotarski also expressed concern with
young smokers' overconfidence in the
inevitability of major scientific breakthroughs in cancer treatment and prevention. She proceeded to relate the story of a
student who said that she was not concerned about the adverse health consequences of her smoking habit because she
is confident that by the time she is at-risk
for developing lung cancer, "there will be a
cure."
Recently, the Swarthmore Co-op stopped
selling tobacco products. According to
Gerry Greway, manager of the Co-op, the
move came about in part because of the
"fact that, as a cooperative, part of our mission is to promote healthy living." While
mentioning that the Co-op respected the
right of the customer to make his or her
own choices about smoking, Greway said
that, "as a board, we felt we were not truly
being what we wanted to be in the community by selling cigarettes."
In addition, Greway said that tobacco
products "didn't represent a significant
amount of sales" at the Co-op.

While some Swarthmore students now
have to walk farther to get their cigarettes,
Greway said that the response the store
has gotten has been 'about 95 percent posithough of course there have been
tive
some exceptions."

campus, and has led students to
lobby for increased safety measures
at the intersection where the collision occurred. On Oct. 6, several students, including members of Din's
cross-country team and residential
hall, attended a town borough meeting in Swarthmore. During the meeting, students learned that residents
shared their concern about the dangers posed by the Harvard-Yale intersection. This was not the first time
safety concerns about the intersection had been brought to the council.
During the Oct. 14 meeting of the
Local Traffic Advisory Committee, a
subcommittee of the borough council, Jaymes Fairfax-Columbo 'lO and
Daniel Hodson 'O9, both members of
the cross-country team, proposed
traffic safety measures such as traffic lights and signs. After discussion
with the council and examining statistics, it became clear that traffic
calming would be a more effective
strategy, according to FairfaxColumbo.

Fairfax-Columbo researched local
traffic issues before approaching the
city government.
Ideas such as placing a sign that
says yield for pedestrians' or placing
a traffic light initially seemed like
effective short-term solutions,
Hodson and Fairfax-Columbo said,
but both recognized the need for
effective long-term goals. It was this
emerging realization that led the
Council to conclude the need for the
traffic calming measures. The
Pennsylvania
Department
of

Transportation cites the Institute of
Transportation Engineers in defining 'traffic calming measures' as "the
combination of mainly physical
measures that reduce the negative
effects of motor vehicle use, alter
driver behavior, and improve conditions for non-motorized street

users."
"The idea originated on campus,
in the community, and in the borough hall," Fairfax-Columbo said.
The response showed that both the
College and the community were on
the same page about the intersection.

Hodson will continue to attend meetings and make efforts to keep updated on any progress that occurs. "I
want to support and oversee any initiatives that [are] proposed," says

facilitating dialogue between the
Borough and the college is the first
step in initiating a policy change.
"Our goal is to be in the loop and
work with them [the Swarthmore
community] as much as possible,"
Fairfax-Columbo said.
Difficulties have arisen over
improving the Harvard-Yale intersection because Yale Avenue is a state
road. This necessitates local and
state cooperation on the project and
adds another layer to an already difficult process.
During the Borough meetings, the
council emphasized its strong relationship with the state Department
of Transportation. Still, Hodson
noted, the process will be more
involved because of this hierarchy.
"It is complicated that you cannot go
straight to the Borough and get
things
done,"
he
said.
Representatives from the Borough
were unavailablefor comment.
The Borough Council has commissioned a study where statistics
such as traffic volume and pedestrian count will be recorded. The
study's findings will be used to determine the most effective safety measures that can be utilized.
Kelly Wilcox '97, Assistant Dean
of Student Activities, has taken safety into her own hands. She is hosting
the "Bike Safety Extravaganza" on
the steps of Parrish tomorrow from
12:30-2:00 p.m. The flier for the event
promises free food, free helmets, and

Coming Out Week celebrates queer experience
BY ASHIA TROIANO

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

Students returned from fall break to a flurry of chalkings around campus. "I'm straight, but it could just be a
phase," "I kissed a girl and I liked it" and "If
Michelangelo was straight, the Sistine Chapel would
have been wall papered," are just a few of the phrases
that have been displayed on paths and emblazoned on
stickers across students' chests for the past week. As has
been the case in previous years, Coming Out Week is taking place during the first week after fall break.
Swarthmore students were welcomed back to campus
with a host of events ranging from discussions about the
intersections of being both queer and religious to workshops on being an ally to the queer community.
While queer groups on campus hold weekly meetings
for their members and events throughout the year,
Coming Out Week is a major annual phenomenon that
has become as much a part of the Swarthmore experience as any other tradition.

"I want people who identify as an
ally to think about what that means,
why they do that, and how they're
living out their identity as an ally in
daily life."

According to Erika Slaymaker 'll, a member of the

queer community is already so visible on campus, but
this is intense visibility. It's a chance for us to say we're

more accessible to all members of the Swarthmore community.

"nday:

Students discuss their experiences being queer allies at
Center on Wednesday night.

QSA's Coming Out Week workshop held in the Intercultural

Board to be involved," Maria Kelly 'lO, one of the leading
organizers of Coming Out Week, said.
The widespread perception of the queer community as
a marginal "other" makes the process of coming out a
very difficult one for any young person. When queer students are thrown into the unfamiliar environment of a
college campus and the new social experiences associated with it, the process of clarifying one's sexual identity
is often thrown into high gear. Coming Out Week is
designed to make this process a less challenging one.
"This week is, in part, a celebration of coming out,"
Lorenzo Ramirez 'lO said. According to Lorenzo, "coming
out" is not an isolated event, but a continuous process
that unfolds over time. "People oftentimes have to come
out more than once, so it is a continuous process as we
meet new people and we decide to tell them that we are
queer," Ramirez said.
Cecilia Marquez 'll said that giving a voice to the
underrepresented
no matter who they are or why they
are marginalized
is essential to the functioning of an
open society. "This week is incredibly important because
it is a chance for the queer community to make our voices heard. We get to be loud about our identity and say
I'm allowed to be a dyke, and I'm
this is who we are
allowed to say it and people just have to deal with it,"
Marquez said.
Marquez acknowledged that some students may be
troubled by the vocal and sometimes graphic chalkings.
"To the community I think it causes a lot of discomfort,
but that's important because discomfort makes us think
about our privilege and we can grow from there."
However, Kelly said she was confident that the
response to Coming Out Week will be overwhelmingly
respectful on a campus as liberal as Swarthmore's. "At
the 'Out in the Workplace' event, one alum said to us that
this campus is not as liberal as we think it's way more
liberal," Kelly said. "Our campus is one of the best and
most tolerant for queer people, and Coming Out Week
gives the entire campus an opportunity to look at the
issues, which says something, especially in terms of
administrative support."
Coming Out Week is a particularly significant time
for first-year students whether they are heterosexual,
queer or questioning their sexuality. "The fact that there
is an entire week for coming out shows that Swat is willing to embrace all of who you are, whereas that might
not have been the case in high school," William Lin "12, a
member of the planning committee, said.
Many students perceive Coming Out Week as an
opportunity to be honest with themselves and others
about their sexual orientation. "I actually came out during Coming Out Week [last year] after the student panel,
so it's a pretty strange time for me right now," Marquez
said. "I felt completely overwhelmed by how many simi-

larities I heard from the panelists with my own life. A lot
of what they said really resonated with me and my own
experiences, so it forced me to question and reevaluate
my own sexuality. After that I began attending Qolors
regularly and came out slowly to others. At this point, it
has come full circle because I am pretty much as out as
possible. I have all but signed my chalkings."
Ramirez did not fully appreciate the significance of
Coming Out Week until later in his college experience.
"Freshman year, I was nowhere near as informed about
the queer world as I am now. I feel like my first Coming
Out Week at Swarthmore was not as special as it is for
me now since I have begun to explore my queerness," he
said.
In organizing Coming Out Week's numerous events,
the planning committee has made an effort to draw
guests from beyond the immediate Swarthmore community. Slaymaker highlighted Thursday's
Gender
Workshop as one event that will feature visiting facilitators. "I'm excited about the Gender Workshop on
Thursday. We'll be thinking about and discussing gender
oppression in all its forms with facilitators from outside
of Swarthmore," Slaymaker said.

...

"To the community I think it causes
a lot of discomfort, but that's
important because discomfort
makes us think about our privilege
and we can grow from there."

For Stephan Lefebvre 'll, the Giovanni's Room book
sale is extremely noteworthy. "I think Giovanni's Room
being a part of Coming Out Week is important because it
is the first queer book store in Philadelphia. We're helping support small businesses by bringing them to campus, and we're getting the benefit of access to books we
don't have."
Members of the Planning Committee emphasized that
Coming Out Week is a campus-wide event that should
ideally be beneficial to all members of the community,
regardless of sexual orientationand gender identity. "We
want to push the whole campus to think about sexuality,
queerness and coming out," Slaymaker said.
"Also, it's an important time to think about the word
'ally' I want people who identify as an ally to think about
what that means, why they do that, and how they're living out their identity as an ally in daily life."

AROUND HIGHER

GWU to bolster aid Students unswayed by prof politics
for families in need
BY MICHAEL MORAN
DAILY TEXAN (U. TEXAS)

BY SARAH SCIRE
THE GW HATCHET (GEORGE WASHINGTON U.)
George Washington University plans to
add millions of dollars to financial aid for continuing students and provide extra accommodations for families having trouble paying for GW during the economic crisis, senior administrators said last week.
Ensuring that students can afford to stay at GW should
be the university's top priority, said Robert Chernak, senior vice president for Student and Academic Support
Services. He said bolstering grant money by at least $8 million is not only necessary to maintain the university's
retention rate, but it is also "the right thing to do." This
year, $llB million was allocated for financial aid grants,
and Chernak said the $8 million increase was a conserva-

(U-WIRE)

tive estimate.

"In my opinion, when a student makes a commitment
in good faith to attend GW and they encounter financial
stress, this institution needs to step up and help," Chernak
said. "We're sort of in unplowed territory here because
this is a once-in-a-lifetime crisis. But we have to take care
of our people." Students and families with a drastic change
such as a recent job loss,
in their financial situation
death or serious illness in the family will be considered
for aid on a case-by-case basis, but officials said they worry
the emergency funds will not be enough given the scale of

the economic crisis.
Before the university can add to financial aid, they will
need the approval of the Board of Trustees. The board,
which meets later this week, will be presented with a
revised budget plan to increase financial aid for both continuing and incoming students.
The plan, however, may not get support from the board
and could need revision. "There may be some members of
the board who think [sB million] is too conservative of an
estimate," Chernak said. "Others might think it's too dramatic of a jolt and think we don't need a knee-jerk reaction." Students could be eligible to receive need-based
financial aid even if they did not qualify for need-based
funds when they applied to the university. Those already
receiving aid may also be considered for additional help.
"Don't make presumptions we can't help you," Chernak
said.
Dan Small, the executive director of financial assistance, said his office has already received a slight increase
in the number ofcalls from previous years, but added that
the full effect of the crisis is yet to be seen.
"My feeling is that people are evaluating right now,"
Small said. "They are looking at themselves and asking,
'Where are we? Where will we be in a couple ofmonths?'"
He said members ofhis office willbe available throughout Colonials Weekend to answer questions from parents
who are worried about continuing to finance a GW education.
"Number one goal is help families work together so the
child can stay here and graduate," Small said. "Some
might not need grants, but are still worried. We can talk to
them about all the options: loans, monthly payment plans,
finding good interest rates." Supporting GWs continuing
students is vital for multiple reasons, administrators said.
"Our number one recruitment strategy is treating current students fairly," Chernak said. "It does not make
sense to recruit new students and leave our current and
continuing students out to dry."
Chernak, who oversees the admissions department,
predicted the admissions marketplace will not be favorable to colleges who do not support their students and that
GWs reputation as an expensive school makes the emergency aid money even more necessary.
"We want students to go back to their communities
and be able to say, 'Don't be scared of the price; this is
the kind of school that will stick with you,'" Chernak
said.
Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz
said he anticipates the university will have to allocate
additional funds toward scholarships and grants for
years to come. "No one knows exactly what's going to
happen," Katz said. "But I can already tell there will be
a several-year window where we need to put more
money into financial aid."

The political beliefs of government professors do not sway their students' affiliation to a particular party, according to a new study.
A team of researchers found that three in every four
students surveyed correctly guessed the political affiliation of their government professors, even though the
students said most professors try to hide their political
beliefs from the class. The researchers surveyed 1,603
government students.
According to a story Friday in the "Chronicle of
Higher Education," the study was conducted to test
the argument that liberal professors try to indoctrinate their students. The study will appear in the next
issue of the journal "PS: Political Science and
Politics."
But Bradford Howard, a senior English major, said
that most of his government professors have told the
class their party affiliation, but did not try to force their
beliefs upon the students. He said he is confident he
could guess most of his professors' party affiliations,
and he's had one professor who has made clear his affiliation.
"He's, I guess you would say, not ashamed to say he's
a Republican," Howard said. "But he doesn't force

Republican ideals or values."
Advertising junior Grant Woodby said he is sure he
could guess his first government professor's political
affiliation even though he tried to hide it from the class.
His second government professor was not as secretive,

he said.

Woodby said he has tailored his work to agree with
the beliefs of his professors.
A. Lee Fritschler, co-author of "Closed Minds?
Politics and Ideology in American Universities," said
partisanship and the conversion of others to one's political beliefs is not widespread in classrooms.
Ninety-five percent of. the 1,270 professors surveyed
for the book said they present competing views of government in their class.
University of Texas government professor David
Prindie said he assigns his students a book or an essay
to read
what he calls "counter-Prindle scholarship"
that argues against him.
"I would say that I try to introduce contrary views,
arguments," Prindle said. "So that, for example, I make
an argument about Congress\ but I assign them an essay
to read which argues that I'm wrong."
Retail merchandising senior Crystal Ting said her
business professors were also open with their political
beliefs. "You want to go on their side," Ting said. "You
can probably get a better grade."

Baylor regrets offering cash incentive for SAT
BY ASHLEY CORINNE KILLOUGH
THE LARIAT (BAYLOR U.)
(U-WIRE)
After being denounced
by college admissions circles nationwide for financially enticing enrolled
freshmen to retake the SAT, Baylor
University officials said Thursday
they made a mistake.
"Did we goof? Yeah we goofed," said
Lori Fogleman, director of mediarelations. "In hindsight we really regret
having provided the cash incentive for
retaking the SAT this summer."
Baylor gave $3OO in bookstore credit to incoming freshmen that re-took
the SAT. If the students earned 50 or
more points higher than their original
scores, they received an additional
$l,OOO per year in scholarship money.
Fogleman added that she was
unaware if Baylor originally had plans
to make the program a recurring practice, but said with certainty the university has decided not to do it again.
"We have heard and understand
the criticism of the action we took, and
we won't again provide cash incentives to retest," Fogleman said.
According to reports, the cost of the
program amounted to $862,000 for this
year and was funded by the financial

aid office.
"The total for each year after that
can't be determined now because the
renewal of merit-based scholarships is
contingent upon other future factors,
such as a student's cumulative GPA,"
Fogleman said.
Baylor officials have repeatedly
said the aim was to distribute available merit scholarship aid. When
asked why there was excess money
available and if this was the first year
Baylor had leftover funds, Fogleman
repeated, "there was merit scholarship
aid available."
Admitted students can still retake
the SAT on national testing days
beyond the Feb. 15 admissions deadline next year for a chance to enhance
their academic portfolio. However,
Fogleman said Baylor has not decided
October 23, 2008

whether it will offer the residual SAT
again. Of the 861 students who accepted the offer, 469 retested at a national
testing site, while 392 took the residual
SAT at Baylor. The two tests are both
scored by the College Board, which
oversees SAT testing, but the residual
score is only accepted at Baylor and is
nontransferable to other schools.
Fogleman said that from Baylor's
understanding it's permissible to
include the residual scores when submitting university profile reports to
college ranking organizations.

"Did we goof? Yeah
we really regret having
provided the cash
incentive for retaking
the SAT."
Lori Fogleman
Director of Media
Relations
...

Robert Morse, director of data
research for U.S. News
World
Report, said he was unsure at this
point if the residual scores can be factored into its overall college rankings.
"Since this has never come up before
and not part of the definition of what
can and cannot be counted, it would
need more research," Morse said.
Morse said it depends on whether
or not the College Board deems the
scores equal to the national testing day
scores. If they say no, Morse said, then
the scores might not be considered.
"If they say yes, then the question
is does Baylor have two scores on file
for each student—one original score
and one new score that can't be transferred?" Morse said, adding that this
could complicate the decision.
As a member of the National
&

Association for College Admission
Counseling, Baylor's actions have provoked speculation over possible violation of the group's code of ethics. The
Statement of Principles of Good
Practice, NACAC's code, bans awarding merit-based aid solely based on test
scores.
Scott Anderson, chair of the
NACAC admissions practices committee, said it's too early to decide if
Baylor did anything out of compliance
with the code. The answer, he said,
could only be determined by an investigation by the Texas affiliation of
NACAC. "The goal of an investigation
would be just to stop the practice. If it
stops, we would then find the member
agreeing to be in compliance,"
Anderson said. "We know that
Baylor's not going to go downthis road
again. That is good to know."
Anderson was uncertain whether an
examination of Baylor's actions would
occur, but due to confidentiality, he
said the matter would not be known
publicly. Baylor's financial incentives
have sparked a wave of criticism, reenergizing a debate over the weight
placed on SAT scores.
Others, such as Sugar Land, Texas
freshman Jasmine Nkrumah, disagree. "I don't think it put Baylor in a
morally bad place because they're giving back to the students," Nkrumah
said. "I disagree with the decision not
to do it next year. Two of my cousins
are applying to Baylor and tuition is
already going up. I think they should
keep doing it. It helped me and it
helped a few of my friends."

Piano, Texas freshman Charlie
Gasmire didn't take the test but
believes the issue has been blown out
of proportion. "Baylor wants to make
itself look better all the time. Who
doesn't? I guess they figured if they
could give us an incentive and bring
the stats up for Baylor,at the same
time, they should go for it. With higher
grades, it might make the school better. It wasn't like blackmail or anything."

Meeting our needs: a look at financial aid
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Some students dispute college's calculation of need and question transparency of appeals process
BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

Offering need-based financial aid is a priority at
Swarthmore, where more than 50 percent of students
receive assistance and the average need-based award is
$34,600.

However, several students were unable to return to
Swarthmore this semester because of financial and other
issues, and they and others have expressed concern over
different elements of the financial aid process in recent
weeks.
Dan Goes 'll said he was unable to return to
Swarthmore because the Financial Aid Office sharply
decreased his award from last year.
"The Financial Aid office was very late with my
award, and when I got my package my family and I were
floored to find that it was significantly less than last
year," he said. "The amount of money we earned didn't
go up significantly, but somehow last year's package vanished."
Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot said students
are rarely unable to return to Swarthmore as a result of
financial difficulties. "It's very rare that students can't
come back to Swarthmore because of financial aid,"
Talbot said.

"We fill the gap between the
student's cost of education and the
family's capacity to pay. We deal with
a family's capacity to pay, not what
they wish to pay."
Laura Talbot
Director of Financial Aid
Amy Smolek 'll also received her financial aid packin the summer, but she and her family were able

age late

ure out what I was going to do for the semester. It was too
late to even sign up for community college."
Talbot said that applications that are incomplete or
turned in late may affect the Financial Aid Office's turnaround time for issuing student packages. "If returning
students submit their financial aid applications by the
end of April, they usually hear from us by the end of
June," Talbot said. "Our reading may be delayed when
follow up questions need answering."

Meeting 100 Percent of Student Need?
Some students facing unusual or untraditional circumstances at home have experienced trouble in securing financial aid.
After depleting an $BO,OOO trust fund from her relatives during her first two years at Swarthmore, Greta
Pittenger 'lO determined that she will be unable to return
to the college. "I had enough money in my account for
two years at Swarthmore without financial assistance,
and Financial Aid led me to believe that if I spent my
money during the first two years, they would help me
stay at Swarthmore," Pittenger said. "This year I got
hardly any financial aid. As of right now, I won't be able
to return to Swarthmore. I'm completely broke. My parents didn't plan on having to pay [for college] because I
already had the fund."
Pittenger appealed to the Financial Aid Office for
additional funding this year, but she said they were
unable to increase her award.
"I got very little aid this year, and my personal expected contributionfrom my assets was $20,000, but I have no
assets left. I used them all," Pittenger said. "There are a
lot of individual situations that for one reason or another, parents can't contribute. I think it's unreasonable for
all colleges to expect that parents are going to cover all of
their child's education."
Talbot said that relying on parents and families to
support students is standard practice at colleges and universities throughout the country. "First we assess the
family's capacity to pay and then we fill the gap between
the student's cost of education and the family's capacity
to pay," she said. "We deal with a family's capacity to
pay, not what they wish to pay."
Besides considering the FAFSA and tax return information, Swarthmore has a financial aid supplement form
to better address specific needs and circumstances.
"Swarthmore's assessment of parents' fair share contribution includes our sensitivity to differences in the cost
of living in different areas of the country; to parents'
ages; to their needs for retirement protection; to upcoming college expenses for younger siblings; to elder care
and child care expenses; to extraordinary medical
expenses; to decreases in asset values; and to job losses,"
Talbot said.

to scramble and pay the bill. "I didn't get my financial
aid package until three days before we were supposed to
pay," Smolek said. "After emailing and calling for the
past few months asking the Financial Aid office to send
us our package, when we got it, it was much less than we
had hoped for."
"I wrote a letter since some aspects of our financial
situation had changed, and I was hoping that they would
be able to take that into account, but they were not,"
Smolek said. "They said they could offer me more loans,
so I took them up on that because I didn't want my mom
to shoulder the burden of my increased tuition."

"The second week of July, we received a letter from

down the Mavis Leno foundation scholarship because it
would have done nothing for me," Nguyen said.

According to the Financial Aid Handbook, students
who receive merit-based outside scholarships will have
their aid awards adjusted. "Since your demonstrated
need has been met with our aid, any additional outside
aid must replace a portion of our award to you.
"Outside aid cannot replace parent contribution,
since that figure represents parents' capacity to contribute from their income and assets," according to the
handbook.

"Circumstances change, and it's
tricky Saying the college should
cover every difficulty in each family
is too much. The college is trying to
be a steward of money for
everybody."
Myrt Westphal
Associate Dean for Student Life
...

While many students acknowledge that Swafrthmore
is accommodating of fluctuating financial circumstances, some have expressed frustration that
Swarthmore doesn't take new circumstances into
account in a timely enough manner.
"Special circumstances need to be taken into
account," Abe Bae 'll said. "My grandma is badly ill, so
my father had to unexpectedly go to Korea a few times
this year. The Financial Aid office does know my situation, but they said they can't do anything about that this
year. That doesn't help me right now, though. I mean,
you always hear about our SL2 billion endowment or
whatever it's up to now, but what does that mean for us?
There is a disconnect," Bae said.
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal said
Swarthmore can only make financial aid decisions in
light of the year's tax returns.
"Circumstances change, and it's tricky. Someone can
lose a job and then get another one two weeks later.
That's why we look at the calendar year based on tax
returns," Westphal said.
"There are so many imponderables. Financial aid
needs a longer time horizon. Financial aid can't bounce
up and down every month or every three months because
of circumstances that might change," Westphal said.
"Saying the college should cover every difficulty in each
family is too much.
"The college is trying to be a steward of money for
everybody," she said.
Genise Choy 'O9 said her dealings with Financial Aid
over the past four years at Swarthmore have been overwhelmingly positive.
"I have to say that every time I've interacted with the
Financial Aid Office it's been a positive experience.
They've always been very kind to me," she said.
"They've always given me a very nice package."
Goes, however, said his experience with Financial
Aid this semester seems to contradict the college's advertised policy to fully meet student need. "Supposedly
Swarthmore will meet 100 percent of demonstrated need,
but I feel like that wasn't the case this semester," Goes

said.
Talbot said theFinancial Aid office does meet 100 percent of student need as determined by the college. "Our
reading of financial aid applications is responsive, careful and generous. We know that money is a difficult issue
for families. We offer as much aid as we can possibly justify," she said. "Family decisions are so important in
these things, though."

Changes in financial aid reveal confusion about process

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

From FINANCIAL AID, p. 7
Dean of Students Jim Larimore said
that the fact that some students feel they
are unable to return to Swarthmore
because of financial reasons doesn't necessarily contradict the college's policy to
meet 100 percent of student need.
"It all depends. I've seen situations
where when you look at the expected family contribution, it's easy to see the
method applied," he said.
Larimore said he understood a complex family situation could further complicate matters. "I've also seen some situations where it's complicated, especially
around divorces. It can put the student in
an impossible situation, if a parent won't
pay or feels like they can't pay even
though they are obligated to," Larimore
said. "But it's hard to say that it would be
okay to ignore a parent's ability to pay in
some cases and award aid, because we
might end up encouraging other parents
to appeal to us for money when they can
afford tuition. If you get parents saying
they're no longer willing to pay because
they think someone else might take care
of it, it's a slippery slope."

The Appeals Process
While financial aid decisions are made
separate of the Dean's Office, some students have appealed to the deans when
distressed about their financial aid
awards. "Students often find themselves
with problems that might impact their
ability to stay in school, and they often do
contact the deans for advice. Even though
we're not directly involved in Financial
Aid, we're interested in helping students
navigate the system," Larimore said.
"I don't know if deans should have a
more direct role in the process because
the rules applied are so complicated and
we're not really the ones who should be
eligible to make those decisions,"
Larimore said. "I've found that the folks
in Financial Aid are responsive to advice
and constructive feedback about how they
might better approach a situation,
though."
Westphal said the Dean's Office has lit-

tle control over decisions made in the
Financial Aid Office. "The appeals
process is printed on the letter sent with
the package. If students come to us,
there's not much we can do," she said.
"It's frustrating because students hope

that by appealing to the deans a different
decision might come forth, but there's
usually nothing Financial Aid can do."

"A huge problem is that
families don't know how
these numbers are
generated. There's no

conversation."
Candice Nguyen 'll

Nguyen said she spoke with a variety
of deans and administrators and even met
with President Al Bloom to voice her concerns with financial aid at Swarthmore.
"I've tried to make financial aid a more
open discussion topic," she said. "My situation isn't unique. What's unique about
it is that, for one
I'm one of the students who [has] made the effort to speak
to administrators about this. There's a
real feeling that because you don't know
how these numbers are calculated, you'll
be punished for questioning them. People
have not come back, and when I asked
why they hadn't questioned their decision, they said that they didn'tknow what
would happen next."
The Financial Aid Office has a formal
appeals process in place that is detailed in
the Financial Aid Handbook. According
to this handbook, if the financial information initially provided was incomplete or
incorrect, students are encouraged to
write a letter to the Financial Aid Office
detailing the new or corrected information. The Handbook states that "without
new or corrected information, however,
there will not be any basis for reconsideration."
Despite the official policy, a few students have expressed confusion or frustration when discussing the financial aid

appeals process.
"With the appeals process, you definitely have to take initiative. Without
taking a strong initiative, you won't get
anything," Bae said. "Even when you do
push, you often don't get anything more.
The appeals process needs to be more
transparent."
Pittenger said she repeatedly tried to
get through to the Financial Aid office
over this summer and last summer, with
little success. "I wrote Financial Aid a
long letter explaining my situation. I
tried to phone them many times to get
through to someone, but it didn't seem
like they wanted to deal with me,"
Pittenger said. "I didn't call the office so
much this summer because I was so frustrated last summer. I understand that
there are tons of students to talk to and
tons of packages to compose, but they
claim to have a personal level of interac-

tion with students and I've never been
able to get through."
Talbot said that, due to high traffic
during the summer months, students are
encouraged to write to the Financial Aid
office to voice any concerns.
"Our robust Financial Aid Handbook
and website offer answers to most questions, but we are happy to help families to
navigate those resources," Talbot said.
"Our first aid decision is our best unless
the information provided to us was not
complete or was not correct. If a student
has new or corrected information to provide us, we are happy to reconsider our
decision."

October 23, 2008

However, the Financial Aid office is
staffed to meet student needs over the
summer, Talbot said. "I've sometimes
heard that people have trouble getting
through to our office, but when I ask if
they left a message, they say no," Talbot
said. "We have three people answering
our main phone line. If a caller leaves a
name and a number, our office returns
the call."
Smolek followed the office's recommended appeal process even though she
was unaware such a procedure was in
place. "I am not really sure if there's an
official process to get your package
changed. I just wrote a letter to Laura
Talbot, she responded, and that was that,"
Smolek said.

Like Bae, Nguyen said the Financial
Aid Office should work to become more
transparent. "A huge problem is that families don't know how these numbers are
generated. There's no conversation.
These numbers are literally cranked out
behind closed doors," she said. "If you're
going to give a family a package that they
believe they can't pay, the least you can
do is explain how that number was calculated. It's the idea of transparency and
openness. You can't even begin to refute a
financial aid package unless you know
therationale behind it."
Choy said many complaints with the
Financial Aid Office stem from a misconception
about financial
aid at
Swarthmore, since some students don't
expect their package to change from year
to year.
"I don't think any student expects it to
happen, so when it does it's more of a
shock than perhaps if there had been
guidelines sent out beforehand saying
your aid might decrease in these cases,"

she said. "It seems like students are real-

ly surprised in these cases and are never
expecting this to happen."

"If you get parents... no
longer willing to pay
because they think someone else might take care of
it, it's a slippery slope."
Jim Larimore
Dean of Students
Nguyen's experience speaks to the idea
that some students expect to receive the
same amount of aid from the college each
year.

"We wouldn't be having this conversaif I had received this package earlier,
when I got in, or if I would have known
that this would have happened," she said.
"Swarthmore makes bold statements
about how they value their students
but it's kind of shocking that it's really
taken out from beneath your feet once
you get in. Through this process, it's been
'Candice, I can sleep at night because I
only have this conversation with three or
four kids per year.'"
Talbot said she and other members of
the Financial Aid Office are open to dialogue about financial aid at Swarthmore.
"If there are bad feelings about this
process, let's talk about it," she said. "We
hope families come to us with any concerns."

Dating at Swat is a mating dance

In order to understand Swarthmore romance, I believe,
one must first understand the Swarthmore student. The
college attracts intelligent, highly motivated students
with diverse interests, and in high school these kids get
less ass than a urinal. To them, college represents a
chance to start again. It is autumn, after all, and the
leaves are falling and the bugs are dying of hypothermia,
and so the life-denying perspective of Swarthmore freshmen there is no greater aphrodisiac. Every bashful young

The relationships that develop, I would argue, are not

remember that they're hiring goddamned ninjas. This
place is a festering hive of thwarted romance. I want you
to carefully consider each of your friends who, by virtue
of gender and orientation, might conceivably be attracted
to you. Because they are. Every one of them. Look across
the table at Sharpies and deep into the eyes of your supposedly platonic acquaintance, because I can guarantee
that he or she is currently entertaining explicit fantasies
of you driving a minivan filled with wailing children, of
you sitting together on a porch in your twilight years, tenderly clutching withered hands and then suffering
adorable simultaneous heart attacks.
But for the sake of argument let us assume that things,
somehow, work out. A couple will often debut lurching ritualistically together on a crowded dance floor;
Swarthmore students require not only alcohol but also the
implicit approval of dozens of other intoxicated couples,
each publicly performing their own rendition of the vertical horizontal flamenco, in order to communicate what
was conveyed in middle school by a scrap of paper with
DO YOU LIKE ME CHECK YES OR NO written on it.
Assuming all the appropriate bumps and grinds are initiated, they will then stagger off together, usually losing
momentum between secondary and tertiary bases. From
here the relationship is allowed to bloom like a sensitive,
diseased flower, covered in tiny ants. Every aspect of it
becomes a dynamo of anguish and emotional paralysis.
Which of the countless permutations of 'Hating" listed on
Facebook best describes our unique and special relationship
status? What is the ideal

our community's intelligence, we have lost any sense of
coherent design.
Swarthmore does have a small population of attractive
and friendly 'mainstream' students, and woe, woe unto
these rare, pitiful creatures. Like the Siberian Tiger, they
are coveted for their beauty and are hunted relentlessly
by those ignorant of their violent temperament and convinced that their kidneys possess medicinal properties.
They are condemned to a life of voluntary chastity, scorning endless queues of apologetic suitors. Hopefully, we
can some day establish a sanctuary for these creatures,
perhaps even create a stable breeding population and
introduce legacy students, born in captivity, back into the
wild. But these collegiate unicorns
beautiful, extraordinary, yet puzzlingly resistant to being touched by virgins
are rare.
The rest of us are left to stumble, blind and deaf and
mute, through the dank subterrain of the Swarthmore dating scene. Only a few dare challenge the system. Only the
brave decide that they've had enough of standing in the
corner of the party with a drink, continuously readjusting
their posture so as to suggest 'introspection' and 'cool disinterest' and "maybe sort of like a contemporary Mr.
Darcy' rather than 'serial murderer,' and then step out
onto the dance floor.
And some do not. Some decide that they are actually
quite comfortable in their corner, thank you very much;
some struggle to assemble coherent sentences when faced
with an attractive member of their preferred gender; some
publish satiric, extremely verbose newspaper articles in
some misguided attempt to impress girls. Incidentally?
Research suggests that these tactics do not have a particularly inspiring rate of success. Because people here are

XYZ Affair comes to Olde Club

An affair to remember:The
BY EMILY CRAWFORD
ecrawfol@swarthmore.edu

Quirky pop band The XYZ Affair has experienced a
sudden surge in attention from the press in the last year;
the virtually unknown Brooklynites have suddenly
become the kinds of buzzworthy stars written about in
such auspicious publications as The New York Times and
The New Yorker. Somehow, this New York based band has
skipped the step of cult-like indie blog acclaim, moving
straight to the big leagues of major intellectual media.
They themselves seem to be a bit confused as to how this
happened, though the jump does seem fitting considering
the bands' academic background (the majority of the fourman pop group attended New York University). Their
first and only album, "A Pew More Published Studies,"
retains its title's educational theme throughout; their
complex and euphoric sound prevents their subject matter from ever seeming boring. The XYZ Affair will be
gracing Olde Club this Friday, Oct. 24.1 was able to ask
their frontman and vocalist Alex Feder a few questions
over the phone beforehand.
Emily Crawford: So, I've heard that you guys met
while going to NYU together. Did the band play together
then too?

Alex Feder: Yeah, we started playing quite a while

ago and then it wasn't until after we graduated that we
started getting a lot more serious about it.
EC: So what was your college experience like? Were you
mostly a college band, playing shows at NYU, or did you
also play at places around the city?

AF: Yeah, I mean the thing is because we went to NYU,
like, you're in the middle of it there. The impression
we've gotten playing at other schools is that there are a
couple of big bands that everyone knows about, but
because we were playing in a city where not only were
there a billion other bands of people our age, but also,
like, obviously all huge bands come to New York, so it was
hard to get serious in that way. But on the other hand, had
we gone to a smaller school, I guess we would have had to
start from scratch again as soon as we graduated.
EC: Yeah, that makes sense. So how would you describe
what your band sounds like?
AF: I would describe us as pop music. I mean, we
have a wide range of influence, but I would say
pop.

EC: So do you guys like being calle
pop, or are the connotations of the term
ever frustrating?
AF: Right, I know it has sort of a
negative tone, but that's like half of
what I listen to, and we all have a pretty wide variety of stuff that we like.
And pop doesn't necessarily mean,
like, you know, the Pussycat Dolls
Yeah no, I definitely don't mind being
...

called pop.
EC: Right. Ok, so if you say half of
what influences you is pop, then what
artists have influenced your music?
AF: A lot of the time the things that we
are listening to and trying to emulate cov-

ers all music genres. Like, right now I'm listening to a ton
of Michael Jackson, and lately that style is a lot of what
I've been listening to, but it really varies a lot. We all like
rock in general too, I did more so in high school; Sam
grew up playing a lot of jazz. You know, it's a pretty wide
variety.

EC: You were recently written about in The New Yorker,
which is awesome. Was that a big moment for you guys?
AF: I mean, it's pretty funny; we went completely
unnoticed for like, the past few years; We worked-on a
press release, and we went through like, everything we
could think of, we had a big show, but got no press for it
and so we sort of gave up on the whole press routine, because it was so much work. So
"
>metime last year we just like, stopped
doing it, and all of a sudden people
just started writing about us. We got
in like what, The New York Times
The New Yorker. Now we have a
publicist who sets that stuff up for
us, but there was a good period of
time where we put in like, no effort
at all.
EC: Okay, last question: ifyou
could have lived through any
\
decade, which one would you
choose?

AF: I guess the '6os? That's what
I'm supposed to say, right? I mean I
wouldn't like wanna live during, like
the Civil War
so I guess the '6os.

'Religulous' too presumptuous to initiate productive dialogue
spends time in Israel wondering why
Muslims and Jews can't just get along
when their holy sites in that country are
essentially the same places. (Isn't that precisely why they're fighting?)
The majority of Maher's barbs, however, are saved for ridiculous people within
this country. For example, he talks to an
evangelical Christian preacher who seems
convinced that he has gotten wealthy and
is able to wear fine clothes due to the grace
of God, despite the fact that Jesus had nothing positive to say about the acquisition of

JOEL SWANSON
They're Watching
There can be little doubt that we live in
an extremely, perhaps a frighteningly, religious time. In this country alone, it has
become almost expected that political candidates will toss out platitudes about going
to church and believing in God, almost as a
precondition for being elected to any office.
More Americans go to church than in just
about any nation on earth and in 2004 more
voters cited "moral values" as their justification for their presidential vote than cited
any other factor, including national security, the war in Iraq, or the economy.
Meanwhile, around the globe we see
unprecedented acts of violence by extremists claiming to act in the name offaith. In
the midst of such an age of extremism and
intolerance, it should be a time for skeptics
and doubters to strike back by reclaiming
the rationality and thought at the core of so
many religious traditions. Instead, we get
increasingly popular radical anti-religious
tracts by such authors as Richard
Dawkins, Sam Harris and Christopher
Hitchens, which are designed only to provoke rather than to encourage any constructive dialogue. Now we also have a film

to include in that list. Comedian Bill
Maher's recent documentary "Religulous,"

for all its many virtues, is ultimately too
self-assured and self-righteous to contribute anything positive to a dialogue that
is so necessary right now.
The majority of "Religulous" consists of
Maher traveling around the world, finding
the most insane examples of religious people he possibly can and using them as
examples of what is wrong with religion
today. He travels to the Netherlands to
explore the tension between the country's
libertine culture and its growing Muslim
immigrant population. He goes to the
Vatican in an attempt to interview the
Pope and ends up standing outside and
baiting a priest into admitting the absurdity of many Catholic teachings. And he

wealth. He confronts an absurd, comical
man who believes that it is possible to "convert" homosexual desire into heterosexual
desire through prayer. (Does anyone
remember the Reverend Ted Haggard, conservative preacher extraordinaire, who
was caught soliciting sex from a male prostitute?) We get a tour of the Creation
Museum in Kentucky, where exhibits
depict dinosaurs and humans living together. Later, we get to see the Holy Land
Experience theme park in Orlando, where
people pay good money to go see reenactments of the crucifixion of Jesus and where
one woman states confidently that she will
return on a white horse after the end of
days to save all of the Jews from eternal
damnation. He even manages to locate a
Florida preacher named JoseLuis de Jesus
Miranda who claims to believe that he is
the descendent of Jesus and that God told
him to tell people not to worry about sin
anymore. It's never quite clear whether or
not he actually believes this absurdity or
whether he's just using it as a way of
extorting money from gullible churchgoers, and it's equally unclear which of these
alternatives would be scarier.
The problem with all of this is that people like Jesus Miranda are such easy targets. There are always going to be people
who claim beliefs that most of us would
perceive as crazy, with or without organized religion to motivate them. But Maher
tries to tar all religious people with the
same brush by showing us a few people on
the fringes of each of the three major
Western faiths. It would be as if the entire
American political left were slandered on
the basis of a few people who were involved
in bombings back in the 19605. (And naturally no one would ever do that, right?)
Maherrefuses to engage with any of his
opportunities for genuine conversation
about religion and the problems it creates
in the modern world. Perhaps the movie's
most interesting character is Father
George Coyne, the retired director of the
Vatican Observatory, who speaks about his
attempt to reconcile his Catholic faith with
his realization that Scripture cannot possibly explain most of the revelations of science and acknowledges that the Bible
should not be used to teach science. Coyne

comes across as far more reasonable than
the majority of Maher's interviewees do,
but Maherrefrains from taking the opportunity for a dialogue, preferring instead to
resort to smug wisecracks and easy laughs,
as he does at just about every other potentially
moment
enlightening
in
"Religulous."
But Maher is simply too certain that his
views on religion are the correct ones to
even consider alternative perspectives. In

a way, Maher and the others in the new

school of anti-religionists are just as dogmatic and unbending as the fundamentalists they criticize. At the end of
"Religulous" Maher delivers an almost
comically overdone monologue in which he
argues that the fate of the world depends
upon doubt, upon people questioning their
beliefs and accepting that they might be
wrong. Perhaps Maher would do well to follow his own advice.

Every fall the

(FOA) celebrates
the achievements of

from Swarthmore
and the nearby
town of Rutledge.
The 35 photographs
currently on display

in Borough

taken both
and on
film, showcase the
talent of area residents. The exhibition, on display
ELENA SMITH
through Nov. 2,
alludes to
the
Arts in the Area
diverse interests of
community;
the
while some artists
direct their lenses
toward the local scene, others guide us along internationaltravels.
In a suburban neighborhood as beautiful as Swarthmore, many
photographers found their inspiration in nature. Emily
Richardson captures the tender delicacy of lotus flowers as they
begin to bloom, while viewers fast forward in time as Kay Cyr narrows in on a fully bloomed white lotus. It basks in the sunlight,
absorbing the sun's rays, while a closed, rosy lotus in the background promises to expose its imminent beauty. Georgia Getz
expresses thanks for nature's bounty by aiming her lens at a
mountainous heap of produce in "Heirloom Tomatoes." Using a
high level of contrast, she captures the intense reds, deep burgundies, soft yellows and cool greens of a variety of tomato cultivars.
Other artists root their work firmly within the local neighborhood. Aaron M. Fine points out the prevalence of signs and directions in Swarthmore. In "No on Lafayette," the word "NO" is
painted down Lafayette Avenue, echoing its message through
Fine's repetition of the image. Fine's sense of humor is also evident in "Signs," a collage of signs from our campus and the borough. In a twist of irony, a "Now Hiring" sign hangs from a boarded window in the Ville.
Many of the artists on display document classic Americana in
their photography. Claire Thurman takes on the American diner
as her subject in "Early Bird Special." Cars surround the 'sosinspired restaurant as customers line up for a good meal in Exeter,
PA. Bill Hodges delivers the promise of a delicious meal in
"Beaufort North Carolina," directing his lens inside a bucket of
freshly-caught crab. A maze of bony arms and legs demonstrates
the success of his catch.
Denise Disney and Andrejs Penikis share the beauty of our
country's natural wonders. Standing at a distance, Disney captures the raw power of Niagara Falls. Streams of water plunge into
the Niagara River below, erupting in violent waves. Puffy clouds
in the blue sky and small flowers at the edge of the image soften
the otherwise intense photograph. Penikis traveled far away from
the Great Lakes to Utah. In "Cliffs of Zion," the viewer looks
upward at the bold, jagged cliffs, positioned to reverently admire
the beauty of the rock's formations.
Several photographers of Swarthmore took inspired photographs along their international travels. Anna Bruno journeyed
through Uganda and submitted two photographs to the exhibition.
Her personal, close-up portraits oflocal children are not voyeuristic but demonstrate a sincere interest in the childrens' lives and
culture.
Grace Wright's "Ganesha" is a brilliantly executed photograph
of a shrine to the Hindu deity. Too often, tourist photos are shot
according to a formula straight-on and centered. With an understanding ofform and artistry, Wright departs from procedure and
places Ganesha off-center. She crops the photo to focus on a partial
segment of the shrine, retaining detail to stimulate visual interest
while excluding repetitive details on the symmetrical sculpture.
While the photograph celebrates the beauty of the Shrine and
Indian culture, it is also a striking creation in and of itself.
Next time you're in the Ville, make sure to visit this small but
engaging exhibition. Although no Swarthmore College students
participated in this year's photography exhibition, FOA president
Lora Lavin strongly encourages students to become involved.
Students can apply for a solo exhibit or participate in a group exhibition. Forms and further information are available on the FOA
website at www.swarthmorearts.org.
Through Nov. 2. Inside Borough Hall, 121 Park Avenue,

Oops, Britney did it again!
who became more like a frightened circus animal
than a human being? That Britney who clearly needed help? She seems to be gone and forgotten, banished to tabloid ephemera. Isn't it comforting to

LIANA KATZ
Digital
Britney Spears is back in a big way. Gone is the
shaved head, the denim cutoffs, the public debauchery with starlet pals. A new Britney has arrived and
she is thin, sexy and apparently mentally stable.
Ushering in the current era in the Spears saga is
Britney's recently released hit single "Womanizer,"
which shot all the way from number 96 to number
one on the Billboard charts a couple of weeks ago.
The single was quickly followed up by a slick video
which flaunts Britney's overhauled (naked) body.
The lyrics even poke a bit of fun at her recent flirtation with bizarre behavior as Britney slams her man
for getting with too many other women: "You say
I'm crazy?/I got your crazy!"
And, boy, is everyone happy about this plot twist.

"Womanizer" is Britney's first hit since 1999's
Baby One More Time" and the press and avid fans
are coming out in droves to herald the rebirth of
Britney's career. "Here's to Britney! Topping the
charts from decade to decade and proving that she
really is the international superstar!" exclaims brit"

...

neyspears.com.
Only a few months earlier, the world seemed

hell-bent on Britney-bashing and highlighting the
gory details of her personal collapse. Now these
same naysayers are praising her beauty and
strength. "I want you to know that you are an inspiration to many people and especially to me! I've realized that in life we can face so many obstacles and
perhaps for a time we might get pushed to the
ground by it
but from these obstacles we can
become stronger! You BECAME STRONGER!" said a
supportive online fan.
But, amidst all the flattery, it is important to ask:
what happened to that other Britney? That Britney
...

THE PHOENIX

know that in today's modern entertainment empire
you can totally make over your career? Whether you
have dabbled in crazy like Britney, drugs like Amy
Winehouse, or Kabbalah like Madonna (aka Esther),
you can put on your old spandex and cone bras and
re-enter the music scene with a virtually clean slate.
Wait. What? Since when is the media and the
unblinking public eye this forgiving? Google
Britney Spears and you will get 85,800,000 results,
most of which are Internet tabloid pages. Likewise,
on YouTube there are 362,000 videos tagged with
Britney in them. Some highlights include: Britney
Spears Stoned and Britney Spears Drunk in
Germany. Although it may sound pessimistic,
Britney's positive return to the limelight is probably
just a fluke. Soon she will make some mistake, flash
some body part. The paparazzi, lying in wait, will
pounce and Chris Crocker will make more YouTube
videos. Britney will once again be condemned to
Internet trash. She will never be able to regain the
Baby One More
image she had when she made
"...

Time" in 1999.

It seems convenient to blame the modern media
fish bowl for the fact that Britney will never again
have an unblemished reputation. After all, the
paparazzi and sites like YouTube magnify and make
permanent her flaws. No matter how many new sexy
videos she makes, you will still be able to find those
famous shots of her exiting a limo without underwear.
It has never been easy, however, for disgraced
pop stars to stage a successful comeback. Jerry Lee
Lewis married his thirteen year old cousin in the
late 1950s and his popularity was never quite the
same even though he kept recording. Similarly,
Sinead O'Connor, the alternative darling of the
19905, will be forever remembered as the woman
who ripped a photo of the Pope on live television
despite her subsequent attempts to be taken seriously, first as an ordained Independent Catholic priest
then again as a musical artist.
Ultimately, the fault lies in us, the listeners and
consumers. When we make idols out of human
beings, we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. We let the fact that Britney may not be psychologically intact detract from our appreciation of
her ability to record ridiculously catchy pop music
(have you listened to Blackout? It's catchy, damnit!).
This is not in any way a groundbreaking assertion
but, at times, there may be some value to reflecting
upon the immortal cries of Chris Crocker: "Can't
you just leave Britney alone?"

Validating Obamamania
On an overwhelmingly liberal and
Democratic campus, the endorsement of a
Democratic presidential candidate borders on
the banal. Accordingly, that The Phoenix is
choosing to endorse Barack Obama in this presidential election is, given the demographics of

Swarthmore, hardly surprising.
But dogmatic Obamamania is a disservice not
only to the candidate, but also to the democratic
process. Even among Obama's supporters and
campaign volunteers, too often platitudes
become the stock responses to the fundamental
question: "Why do you support this candidate?"

This editorial seeks to answer that question, not
with chants of hope and halcyon dreams of
change, but with the realities ofBarack Obama's
qualifications. We identify three traits of the
nominee that make his candidacy so compelling:
his tenure as a law professor at the University of
Chicago; his passion for international and
domestic dialogue and engagement; and the
promise of uniting not only a country fractured
internally along party lines, but an international
order torn asunder by a superpower made into a
diplomatic pariah.

Before Barack Obama became Senator Obama

(either in the Illinois Senate, from 1997 to 2004, or
in the United States Senate thereafter), he bore
an honorific familiar to Swarthmore students:
Professor. And as the former president of the
Harvard Law Review and a professor of constitutional law at the prestigious law school of the
University of Chicago, Professor Obama's past as
an academic should not be ignored or understated. When The New York Times published several
of the model responses he provided to his own
constitutional law exams in July, commentators
were struck by how consistently thoughtful,
articulate and insightful they were. Pamela
Karlan, a law professor at Stanford, remarked

that "Senator Obama has a first-rate mind for

legal doctrine and could have been a first-rate
academic had his interests gone in that direction." Akhil Reed Amar, a fellow constitutional
law professor at Yale, professed to being "dazzled
by the analytical intelligence and sophistication"

of Obama's exams and responses.
Despite graduating 894th of 899 in his class at
Annapolis, John McCain has built a successful
career as a politician. Mr. McCain's exploits
demonstrate that being able to confidently cite
Supreme Court cases is, in and of itself, not of

value to a president. Obama's book smarts translate into a pragmatism that has led him not only
to capitalize on his own experience and knowledge, but also surround himself with equally
knowledgeable
advisors. Jason Furman,
Obama's senior economic advisor, is a graduate
of Harvard and a veteran of the World Bank, the
Clinton administration, Columbia, Yale and

NYU. By contrast, even the son of McCain's senior domestic policy advisor, Swarthmore alum

Colin Holtz-Eakin 'O7, has expressed doubts
about the competency of McCain's advisory
team.

Nevertheless, a White House filled with the
best-qualified advisors is purposeless without a
president willing to embrace the issues most relevant to contemporary American society. And
here Obama shows his true promise as a leader.
From the start of his candidacy, Mr. Obama has
approached the challenges he (and America) face
questions of race and religion seem to come to
the forefront
with gusto. In a campaign dogged
by the persistent specter of racism, Obama has
not only responded to these biases head-on, but
also prompted Americans to reconsider their
own, sometimes latent, prejudices. In his
endorsement of Senator Obama's candidacy, former Secretary of State Colin Powell responded to
the misconception that Mr. Obama is a Muslim,
often used as an attack by Republicans, by asking, "What if he is? Is there something wrong
with being a Muslim in this country?" These and
other questions, we can only hope, will remain at
the forefront of an Obama administration's pri-

orities.
Also outside of America's borders, Mr. Obama
has been consistent in adhering to his philosophy of engaging with issues rather than ignoring
them. He has stressed constructive dialogue with
countries such as North Korea, a relief to many
Americans worried by eight years of shunning a
growing nuclear power. The only way to dismantle the Bush years' most frightening legacy, the
hostile Axis of Evil, is to change course and
embrace, rather than alienate, countries critical
of the United States. And while Senator McCain's
campaign has seized on Mr. Obama's willingness
to parley with hostile nations as a sign of weakness and coalescence to enemies of the state, they
confuse diplomacy for debility.
Finally, we believe that the presidency of
Barack Obama is uniquely suited to the duty of
restoring America's reputation as the rational
leader of the international community, rather
than a maverick practitioner of cowboy diplomacy. For years, America has squandered the international goodwill that resulted from its status as
a benevolent hegemon. The United States was
built to be a city on a hill; yet, from shunning the
Kyoto Protocol to making a mockery of the
United Nations, the United States has shied away
from being the example the world expects. We
have not lived up to our promise, as a people and
as a nation. And beginning with the election of
Barack Obama in November, we, at least, hope
that America can start down the road back to its
former power, prestige and place as the shining
beacon of what democracy can accomplish.

JUAN VICTOR FAJARDO
Cam-bur-pjn-ton

This week I have chosen to
write about a topic related to
Freddy Caicedo's visit to
Swarthmore on Monday
a
(10/20).
Caicedo
is
Colombian human rights
organizer that works closely
with Witness for Peace
(www.witnessforpeace.org) as
well as grassroots organizations in rural communities in
his home country. He came to
campus to give a talk on the
(soon to be voted on) USTrade
Colombia
Free
Agreement (FTA). The primary goal ofhis lecture was to
awareness of what this
NAFTA-style trade pact would
mean for farm-communities
m Colombia, and what US citizens can do to prevent the

braise

mb^hm

FTA from being approved by the US Senate.
Although the FTA fact sheet published by The White House in March
claims that the trade agreement will "bring economic gains for both countries," Caicedo disagrees. He argues that NAFTA-style agreements, like the
FTA, have historically deepened the socio-economic problems they aim to
resolve. These agreements consist largely of neo-liberal policies focused on
the privatization ofnatural resources and other economic sectors.
Far from benefiting developing nations, Caicedo argues that these policies ultimately pose a threat to the livelihoods of subsistence farmers, jeopardize the cultural autonomy of indigenous communities and have lasting
negative effects on the environment.
Freddy Caicedo is not the only Latin-American critic of this trade agreement. In fact, the neo-liberal ideal of trade agreements that yield economic
gains for both sides has faced stern opposition from many governments in
the region. Perhaps the most prominent advocate against US trade agreements in Latin America is the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez. In
response to these trade initiatives, Chavez has proposed an innovative alternative for trade in Latin America called The Bolivarian Alternative for the
Americas (ALBA).
ALBA was created on Dec. 14, 2004 in Cuba, and at the time there were
only two member countries: Cuba and Venezuela. Since then, Nicaragua,
Bolivia, Honduras and the island nation of Dominica have joined. Contrary
which ostensibly exploit the economic disparities
to US trade agreements
advocates of
between strong economic powers and developing nations
ALBA claim that they will create more 'egalitarian" trade agreements
between Latin American countries. In order to do this, ALBA is proposing
the creation of a compensatory fund known as the Banco del Sur, or Bank of
the South.
Through this fund, the members of ALBA hope to reduce Latin America's
reliance on funds like the IMF. The Bank of the South, if created, will be a
collective fund comprised offinancial contributions from member countries
that will be used to finance development projects in the region. The goal is
to create a "socially responsible" fund that will challenge US financial influence in Latin America.
Although formal aspects surrounding the creation of the Bank of the
South (lending policies, criteria for accepting members, etc.) remain unsettled, the initiative seems promising on paper. It is appealing in that it strikes
a regionalist chord. The main question that remains unanswered, however,
is whether the rhetoric surrounding ALBA will actually reflect the reality.
The connections between ALBA and Chavez's anti-American project for
Latin America are fairly evident. In that sense, there are strong reasons to
be skeptical about this initiative. Chavez's goal to expand Venezuela's political influence in the region is no secret. A recent publication in a Venezuelan
newspaper claims that ALBA offices in several countries are being used as a
way of 'exporting" the Bolivarian Revolution. According to the article, these
offices are centers for covert political proselytism.
Publications of this sort seem to confirm the hypothesis that ALBA is just
a facade for the advancement of Chavez's overarching project for Latin
American geopolitics. They also help to put Chavez's seductive rhetoric into
the context of his personal agenda. For those of us who have seen the disparity between theory and practice of the Bolivarian Revolution in
Venezuela, it is hard to take anything Chavez says at face value.
What is true is thatLatin America is currently changing and searching
for new horizons. Although past neo-liberal trade agreements and developmentpackets have largely failed in bringing about economic development in
Latin America, does it necessarily follow that rejecting them entirely and
alienating the US from the region is the best solution? Where will projects
like ALBA leave the region after leaders like Chavez are out of office? How
much power are we willing to give to a man with autocratic tendencies9
These are the questions that we need to answer.

ken down by county. Seas of red rural areas with
blue urban islands.
Looking at this issue geographically and sociologically helps to explain where these values come
from. Disagreement over the proper role and size
of government, the central division between liberalism and conservatism, becomes more understandable when viewed (in the admittedly non-scientific analysis below) as a product of place.
With little to gain financially by voting for
Democrats, affluent city dwellers believe in big
government because of the close contact between
rich and poor. Cycles of poverty make sense when
you can see them, and this understanding leads to
a moral imperative to help the needy. Further,
urbanites can feel the presence of government;
centers of power are located in cities and citizens
have tangible evidence of where their tax dollars
go.

Every presidential election that I can remember has been progressively more important, or so
I've been primed to believe. And that's probably
true. But with that growing significance, greater
negative perceptions and fear of the other side

arise. Indeed, when I reflect on what Edward
Said's concept of the "Other" means for today's
voters, it is certainly not the foreign Oriental, the
Communist, or the Islamic extremist. It is the
American Other.
In contemporary politics, the American Other
is not the result of racial strife or anti-immigrant
frenzy (although such problems do create divisions of their own). It is the product of rampant
distrust, misunderstanding and hatred of the
opposite end of the political spectrum. As a New
York liberal coming of age in the Bush years, for
example, I identified myself by cordoning off a
huge piece of America and defining myself against
it. Just as Said wrote that the Occidental West created and required the Oriental Other to reaffirm
and solidify its identity, liberals and conservatives
in the United States thrive on mutual fear and disassociation. It energizes them and lends purpose
to their cause. By believing in the logical superiority of one's beliefs, the political Other is reduced
to an ideological barbarian: irrational, blind to
facts, and acting on ugly, ulterior motives.
This is the crux of our polarization problem
right now. Rather than accepting that political
positions are based on the values we grow up with,
we cling to the assumption that every opinion we
hold follows logically from some philosophical
platform of undeniable truth. On the left, the correlation between liberal values and an individual's education level is often cited to reinforce this
belief. We are civilized; the American Other is
red, white and blue chaos.
This view betrays the mantle of logical legitimacy to which both sides lay claim. Values
the
platform beliefs on which we build our political
are not
positions through logical consistency
universal. They are, like everything else, products
of time, place and necessity. A person's values are
predicted pretty well by the population density of
her community, i.e. urban, suburban or rural.
Just look at a 2004 presidential election map bro-

16

In rural areas, values shift because the living
is different. This summer I worked on a family
farm in Downeast, Maine. These farmers (both of
whom went to college) work long, hard days and
there is no such thing as a weekend or vacation.
Whenever the conversation turned to taxes, they
always remarked that scraping out a living is
hard enough without the government taking a
percentage to give to people who don't work.
Their culture of work includes a rugged individualism that is diametrically opposed to the concept
of government assistance. (And yes, they did
receive two thousand dollars in subsidies in 2006
about the price of one cow.)

We cling to the assumption
that every opinion we hold
follows logically from some
philosophical platform of
undeniable truth.
You don't have to agree with either set of values described here; the problem we face isn't
about disagreement. It's about misunderstanding
and distrust. When we question the motives of
those with whom we disagree, we neglect the likelihood that we're coming from different places.
Liberals and conservatives surely don't have to
agree with each other (and I am not suggesting
political animosity or misunderstanding is anything new), but it is dangerous to assume that
anyone who disagrees with you is irrational, misguided, or deluded. Instead, try to remember
your own biases and the forces that make you
think the way you do. In a community like
Swarthmore, where we are wont to constantly
reaffirm our own political opinions, let's remember that the conception of the American Other is
like any Other: largely a work of our imaginations that tells us more about ourselves than it
does about anybody else.

Coming Out Week:
just the first step
In case you haven't
noticed the chalk-adorned
sidewalks and paths, it's
Coming Out Week at
Swarthmore College. The
week is important to the
community because it is a
time to celebrate queer
identity in a society that
still stigmatizes and denigrates many aspects of
being queer. Coming Out
Week is also a time when
"out" individuals and
allies encourage those
who are still closeted to
come out to the people

who are important in
their lives. Whether it is
Fits of Rage
your first time or your
fiftieth, however.coming
out is a lifelong process
given the nature of our society and the assumptions people make about
our sexual orientations and gender identities. This ongoing process necessitates the formation of a supportive climate to come out in, something
allies can help with.
Coming out can be a time of great personal hardship, an extremely
cathartic experience that can set one at ease, or something in between.
Though the coming out process is different for everyone, it is an experience thatthose of us who are out in the community can relate to; this experience is one of gaining self-worthand overcoming social barriers in order
to disclose sensitive information about ourselves.
'

The coming out process is an experience
of gaining self-worth and overcoming
social barriers.
...

...

There is something truly unique about the coming out experience that
serves as a bond between members of our community and other communities. When an individual comes out, that individual makes a political
statement that goes against the traditional thinking in our society. It compels the people the individualknows to consider theirroles in perpetuating injustices against the individual, thus forging alliances. With every
new out person and each new ally, our community becomes stronger and
more resistant to previous marginalization and violence. The coming out
process, therefore, provides the queer community with a common experience to rally around and enables us to work to end the oppression that
restricts us.
Though the rain may wash away many of the words and images from
the sidewalk this week, the mainstream and radical ideas that were
expressed by the Swarthmore community will soon alter future generations of activists and advocates in the queer movement. The ideas, most
of which were passed down to us by those who came before us, represent
the ongoing struggle against the oppression perpetuated by people in our
society.

The people that came before us, the persecuted, victimized, and dehumanized, tread a path toward greater acceptance for all of us by coming
out as both queer people and allies, and we must not forget their contributions. The efforts of queer people and allies have made the lives of every
marginalized member of society easier, by making the broader majority
recognize the existence of our dissent and pushing for the inclusion of our
minority voices within decision-making frameworks. Without their
efforts, we would not have made nearly as much progress as we have, yet

our work is far from over.
To make an impact in our community, we must continue to come out.
Those in the queer community who have taken a stand and come out to
the people who are important to them have continued down the path of
progress for the queer movement. We must continue to examine our roles
in society and work to end injustices wherever we encounter them. This
will involve assessing the intersections of our identities so that we can
build upon the common ground we find with others. In doing so, we may
solve our communities' urgent problems. Nonetheless, the easiest way in
which we can make an impact is by making sure that our voices are heard
come Election Day. On Nov. 4, 2008, our community has the chance to
come out to the voting booths and send a clear message to our society.
Another opportunity like this one will not come around for four more
years, so let us not squander the chance to lead our nation in a better
direction. Existing in silence will simply not be enough this time.

"Boondocks" reflects diversity of black community

LAUREN RAMANATHAN
The Margo Channing Report
Ironically enough, I was introduced to "The
Boondocks" by a white boy from the suburbs. It's ironic
because no series on TV, let alone an animated series, has
taken as many incendiary cracks at the white bourgeois
establishment as "The Boondocks." For that matter, no TV
show has taken as many cracks at the black pop culture
vanguard. It is this no-holds-barred, equal opportunity critique that makes "The Boondocks" so essential to any
young revolutionary's DVD collection.

combination of Huey, the young Afro-Centric radical
whose plans to save the world somehow always fail, and
Riley, the admittedly delinquent 8-year-old whose charm
and pop culture savvy make up for his numerous character flaws.
There's also Granddad, the boys' guardian, who is trying to find love in the autumn years of life; Uncle Ruckus,
the self-hating black man; and Tom Dubois, who marries a
white woman and has a daughter named Jazmine, much to
the consternation of every black woman on the block.
What sets "The Boondocks" apart from other black
comedy fare is that it accurately represents the diversity
of black existence and how those discourses interact with
the majority culture. In episode 8, "The Real," the racial
politics of reality television are on display. Riley, conniving little charmer that he is, convinces Granddad to pretend he's blind in order to entice "Extreme Makeover:
Home Edition" and "Pimp My Ride" to pay the Freemans a
visit.
The tokenization and othering of "Extreme Makeover:
Home Edition" is laid bare as Tyler Pennington and crew
attempt to install a watermelon patch and a fried chicken
dispenser in the Freemans' home. The Freemans travel
back to Chicago in episode 13, "Wingmen," and Huey discovers that his old friend Cairo has abandoned him for
Dewey, an "authentic," dashiki-wearing, head-wrap-toting,
poetry-spewing Afro-Centric radical.
The rivalry between Huey and Dewey is not a mere
matter of friendship, but one of identity politics. What does
it mean to be a young black man in America? What is
does it have a specific look? A specific

name?
One character that has caused a lot 0f... we 11... ruckus
on the show is Uncle Ruckus, whose epithet-spouting and
white-power-posturing is made even stranger by the fact
that he himself is black. The "Uncle Tom" complex has
never been funnier or more clearly illustrated than
through Ruckus' invectives. Upon becoming the victim of
police brutality, Ruckus actually thanks his attackers for
their "thorough" job.
Aaron McGruder, creator of "The Boondocks" (which
was initially a serialized comic), has never been afraid to
point the finger at his own people. His indictment of
black culture is not, however, a monolithic condemnation of African America as "a bunch of lazy Negroes who
can't do anything for themselves," but rather a general

McGruder's series shows that black

To the Editor:
Earthlust would like to congratulate the Phoenix on last week's
thoughtful cover story on sustainability at Swarthmore. However, we
would like to emphasize that we are advocating for wind power as a
complement to education and energy conservation, not at their
expense. At a time when the college is setting goals for the next
decade there is a particular need to expand the resources devoted to
making the campus sustainable.
Thus we endorse the Sustainability Planning Committee's policy
and curriculum recommendations, but feel that buying 100% wind is
an equally essential measure, particularly because it is simple and
quantifiable. Individual electricity conservation efforts, while critically important, have an inherent limit.
By purchasing 100 percent wind the college could remove this limit
in a single clearly visible stroke, preventing several millions of
pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per year. Announcement of the
purchase will in itself serve an educational purpose, and would be a
strong first step towards a broad and ambitious greening effort.
National rankings should indeed be taken with a grain of salt, but
that does not obviate in any way the need for the college to make a
clear institutional commitment to clean energy. Swarthmore cannot
presume to educate environmental leaders without getting its own
sustainability fundamentals right first.
We of course do not advocate rushing into an energy purchase
without a thorough cost-benefit analysis, one that engages the entire
college community. To promote this process we are hosting a Fireside
Chat on Wednesday, October 29, 9:00 PM, at the Kohlberg Coffee Bar.
We invite all to bring questions or comments.

anything about the actual oppression that still exists.
In episode 9, "Return of the King," Martin Luther
King is resurrected, so to speak, only to watch as the people who he "got all those ass-whoopins for" shake their
asses in music videos, bust caps for no reason and basically act the damn fool all over the place. This episode,
which won a 2006 Peabody Award, also notably provoked
the ire of Al Sharpton (I mean MLK does actually bust
out the "N" word himself, y'all).
...

The series also provoked the wrath of BET, whose
bureaucratic machinations to "destroy the minds of
Black children" have been McGruder's ambition to
expose since the first comic strip. The battle between
McGruder and BET culminated with two episodes from
season 2 being banned, including one in which Huey
vows to go on a hunger strike until BET is disbanded and
the members of the executive board have all committed
Japanese-style ritual suicide.

What sets "The Boondocks" apart
from other black comedy fare is that
it accurately represents the diversity
of black existence.
Controversy aside, "The Boondocks" is essentially a
narrative of navigation: how do minority cultures navigate majoritarian societies? More importantly, what happens when those minorities fuck the system altogether?
These questions remain as tenuous as ever. With a
black man running for president, many feel that the
glass ceiling has been broken, but McGruder's series
shows that black people, and people of color in general,
have a long way to go before that parity is reached.
Season 3 of "The Boondocks" has yet to materialize.
Lucky for us, seasons 1 and 2 are on DVD and the comic
strip has been preserved in numerous treasuries
(Special note to McCabe: if you do not carry these, get
NOW!). So sit back and relax. Even if the revothem
lution isn't televised, at least it's animated.

Drama for Phillies arrives with a wild pitch
Dodgers pitcher Hiroki Kuroda threw a

JOSH ABEL
Called Third
The Phillies made the National League
Championship Series less dramatic than
it could have been, dispatching the
Dodgers in five games. However, some
foolishness made Game 3 exciting.
After Brett Myers threw behind the
Dodgers' star slugger, Manny Ramirez, in
Game 2 (he claims it slipped out of his
hand) and Jamie Moyer hit Dodgers
catcher Russell Martin with a pitch early
in Game 3 (clearly unintentional it was
a breaking ball, in a critical situation),
-

ball up around Phillies centerfielder
Shane Victorino's head. The benches then
emptied, though the sides just exchanged
some heated words.
Conventional baseball wisdom says
Kuroda did the right thing. FOX's broadcaster Tim McCarver, who has trouble
thinking outside the box, had been waiting for this retaliatory chin music since
the Myers pitch in the previous game. In
Game 2, Dodgers pitcher Chad Billingsley
never retaliated against Myers' perceived
sleight, a decision that was trumped up as
some sort of failure of character.
When Kuroda fired at Victorino, all
was right in the world for McCarver and
the many who "think" like him. The idea
is that, if your counterpart throws at one
of your teammates, it is your duty as a
pitcher to retaliate by hitting one of his.
During the drama, McCarver invoked the
name of Don Drysdale, speaking with
great reverence about how the former
Dodger great would have handled a situation like this he was never reluctant to
throw at someone. Drysdale, unlike the
wimp Billingsley, was not afraid of a confrontation and knew how to handle such a
dispute like a man.
But let's be clear: there is nothing
manly or courageous about throwing a
baseball 90 mph at someone's head, particularly when the rules of the game confine that person to a small box 60 feet
-

away. Rather, it is immature and block-

headed.
At no point did McCarver, or anybody
else, stop to consider whether the Phillies
pitchers had actually been targeting the
Dodgers hitters in the aforementioned
incidents (i.e. whether there was actually
anything to retaliate against). In fact,
McCarver seemed to understand that the
Phillies were just playing the game the
right way, trying to pitch effectively on
the inner part of the plate. This is a necessity for a Major League pitcher, something else McCarver would acknowledge.
No matter. McCarver thirsted for the
firing squad and was pleased when
Kuroda delivered.
This is not acceptable in the 21st
Century. We don't lash out at each other
when we disagree or suspect that we have
been wronged. Aggression and rage are
not traits to be admired, but instead mesh
only with a warped and antiquated sense
of masculinity.
Kuroda, or whoever decided that
Victorino should be thrown at, acted irrationally and cowardly, choosing to risk an
injury to Victorino's head or hands in
response to a few unintentional and
unimportant byproducts of the Phillies
pitchers' pitching the right way. Up to
that point in the series, exactly one
Dodger had been hit by a pitch: Russell
Martin took Moyer's slow curveball off
his knee, something he could have avoid-

Ed if he had moved at all. It goes without
saying that this does not warrant a fastball at an opponent's head.
And yet, McCarver mused about how
Kuroda had won the respect of his teammates with that pitch, something
Billingsley had failed to do in Game 2.
Kuroda was out there protecting his teammates, letting the Phillies know that it
wasn't okay to throw at his hitters (even
though they never had). That's how
Drysdale would have done it. That's a
how a man should do it.
As we've seen all too clearly in the 21st
Century, trumping up excuses for aggressive force based on false or manufactured
evidence has a way of backfiring. The
Phillies had not been throwing at the
Dodgers; they were just using the inside
part of the plate.
Even after Kuroda
threw at
Victorino's head, the Phillies continued
throwing inside, and their effective pitching was key in sending the Dodgers packing after just five games.
Oh, and Russell Martin got hit again
later in Game 3. So much for protecting
your hitters.
Ultimately, Kuroda had no cause to
throw at Victorino, and his decision to do
just a fine from
so yielded no results
Major League Baseball. The cost to
Victorino could have been much greater.

Cross country teams trump opposition in Championship
BY JASON HONGIN YUN

cross country, points are the sum of a team's top-five runners' places. The team with the lowest scores wins.)
On the women's side, the three top Swarthmore runners made the 2008 Seven Sisters All-Tournament team.
The team was led by Annyika Corbett 'lO, who finished
the race with a time of 19:3L80 and placed second out of
seventy-five runners. Melissa Frick 'l2, who placed third
individually, finished the race with a time of 19:43.30. Cocaptain Bess Ritter 'O9 finished the race at 20:03.90, for a
seventh place finish to mark a personal best at the Seven
Sisters Championship.
Closely following Ritter, seniors Emma Stanley and
Kathy Feeney completed race at 20:16.90 and 20:27.30,
placing in the eleventh and twelfth spots. Lauren Deluca
'lO, Hannah Rose 'l2, Faith Pampel 'O9, and Ashley
Davies 'lO all crossed the finish line in sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth places.
"The results really demonstrate the team's depth this
year
we had 8 runners in the top 18 finishers and our
spread was really low (35)," said Bess Ritter.
The women's team totaled 35 points, overwhelmingly
out-pacing five other schools at the invitational: Smith
(65), Vassar (73), Wellesley (78), Bryn Mawr (144) and
Mount Holyoke (145).
Coach Peter Carroll, commenting on the terrain of the
race, said that the Seven Sisters Invitational and the
DeSales University Invitational courses were more "challenging" compared to other races that the teams ran in
the past. Unlike the Paul Short Invitational where the
both Garnet men's and women's team competed three
weeks ago, the course at the Seven Sisters Invitational
tends to be hilly. The Swarthmore teams, however,
proved to be faster on the tougher courses. "I think the
Smith course played well into our teams' strengths. [lt
was] more of a strength kind of race than a race like Paul
Short, which is really flat and fast, and I think our team
was able to really use the hills as an advantage," Bess
Ritter said. "Kids ran really smart," Coach Carroll also
said.
Faith Pampel 'O9, co-captain for the women's team,
said that the victory would not have been achieved without the dedication of everyone on the team and the hard
workout that the team had done. "People art giving the
extra time and energy it takes to be a better team,
whether [by] doing core exercises after every run, cross,

Over fall break, the Garnet men's and women's cross
country teams achieved outstanding results. On October
11th, the Swarthmore men competed at the DeSales
University Invitational where they earned a fifth place
out of twenty teams, while the Swarthmore women took
first place at the annual 27th Seven Sisters Cross
Country Championship held at Smith College, winning
their second title since 1989.

At the DeSales University Invitational, the
Swarthmore men's team did exceptionally well, with its
three runners finishing in the top ten. The Garnet were
led by their team captain, Daniel Hodson 'O9. Hodson,
who is said to have had the best race of his collegiate
career, completed the 8k race with a remarkable time of
27:16:96, finishing fifth out of 180 competitors at the
invite. Closely following Hodson were Erik Saka 'O9 and
Patrick Harnett 'll, who placed sixth and eighth respectively, with times of 27:22.07 and 27:28.33. Rounding out
the scoring runners for the Swarthmore team were juniors Jonathan Tompkins and David Riccardi, who placed
66th and 101st.
"DeSales is particularly awesome because of its
downhill start, which promotes a fast first mile," Hodson
said, "and they give shirts out to the top twenty. We had
three guys get shirts, all in the top ten, so that's a big
deal." Hodson also commented on missing runners, saying that the team would have had better results with
them, and also on his teammate David Riccardi. "He forgot his uniform and flats, so that cost him 1-2 minutes.
Figure about 15-20 seconds a mile for spikes instead of
trainers."
Overall, the men's team finished with a total score of
163, earning them fifth place. Swarthmore finished
behind Salisbury University (46), Rowan Univeristy (91),
host DeSales University (108) and Scranton (149). (In

Also important to note is that cross country training
does not start in the fall. It starts at the beginning of the
summer. As far as I can tell, everyone put in the time
each day to log those long, lonely miles in the summer
heat. I'm proud of what everyone has done and is doing,
and hopefully the work will continue to pay off irf'the
greatest way possible."
For both men's and women's teams, last meets serve
as a transition point from the regular season to the
championship part of the season. Coach Carroll said that
the teams were done with the "introduction courses" of
the season, and will focus on preparing for the upcoming
championship races. As the teams head into the championship part of the season, he will drop the volume of
training while increasing the intensity; the teams will
move away from the 20 X 200 to the 8-10 X 200 "balls out"
over the next couple weeks.
Expectations for the championship races are high.

Coach Carroll expects the women's team to be in the topthree and the men's team to be in the top half at the next
race.
The team's exceptional results from the previous
races seem favorable to such prospective. "Expectations
for the upcoming meets? I expect that we'll be tough as
nails," Faith Pampel said.
The Garnet men's and women's teams' next race will
be Centennial Conference Championships on Saturday,

The meet will be held at Gettysburg College, where
the Garnet will race against some of the strongest teams
in their region.

Bowling: for serious athletes who like the fast lane

KEVIN FRIEDENBERG
Get Down With
Your Bad Self
Recently I fell in love with a new hobby,
bowling. For those of you who have never
been bowling, or in my case have only gone
candlepin bowling (apparently a New
England phenomenon), you have to try the
real deal: tenpin bowling. Bowling ranks

above even golf on my preferred sports-related hobbies list; not only is it vastly easier,
but it takes far less time. Depending on the
number of players you have in your lane it
is possible to finish three games in less than
ninety minutes. Additionally, I find that
bowling is far more social than golf, probably due to the fact that it's impossible for me
to be wandering in the woods for a lost ball
at the bowling alley. For that reason alone
the game has limitless potential.
Bowling is not a terribly hard game to
pick up, I found that the learning curve was
pretty shallow. After guttering the first three
balls or so I was finally able to strike one of
the damn pins, and it was exhilarating. For
those of you who are easily frustrated when
struggling at a new hobby, even when guttering consecutive shots I never really felt
my blood boil. The atmosphere of the bowling alley and the game in general was laid
back and fun.
Though I will probably not be bowling
anything near a perfect game in the next
forty years of so, I never really felt the need
to beat whomever I was playing. I usually
found myself just trying to beat the score of
my previous game. Also, what is great about

bowling is how one game is no indication of
how you will bowl in any subsequent games.
For example, in the first game that I ever
bowled I rolled a lowly 51, easily outclassed
by everyone in my group.
However, miraculously in the second
game I bowled a 133, including a turkey
(three strikes in a row), which has proven to
date to be the best I have ever bowled. I was
flabbergasted. This only fueled my desire to
go bowling more often even though in my
most recent trips I have only broken 100 one
other time. The ease with which one can
brush off a previous game and bounce back
is what makes bowling such a fun game.
Having been bowling twice now over
October break I would have to say the most
difficult part of the game is choosing what
ball to bowl. Aside from the obvious aesthetic bonus of rolling a neon pink bowling ball
at high speed down the lane, one is forced to
choose not only the weight of the aforementioned ball but also the size of the finger
holes and the space between the finger holes.
As a greenhorn I was overwhelmed by
the myriad of choices, but with every successive bowling trip, the ball preferences
slowly fall into place. Similar to golf, differ-

ent equipment may be used for different situations. I had initially fallen in love with
lighter bowling balls (around twelve
pounds) since I felt like I could wing the
thing down the lane, increasing the probability of knocking down more pins witheach
throw. However, once I realized that I had
trouble controlling the spin of a lighter ball,
I graduated up to the heavier balls (around
fifteen pounds), which I feel are more accurate on the lane though-much slower than
their lighter counterparts.
Bowling is a serious hobby for some serious athletes. Superstars such as the New
Orleans Hornets' Chris Paul are avid and
capable bowlers (averages around 180-190).
There are numerous charity events every
year that incorporate bowling and are
attended by some of the greatest sports figures, such as notable Pittsburgh Steelers
alumnus Lynn Swann. Bowling is definitely
the kind of thing that I recommend every
sports enthusiast try at least once. It is too
fun not to do. I mean, look at those great
shoes you get to wear, who wouldn't want
that?

Men's soccer returns to top-25 Volleyball falls to Hopkins
BY JARED NOLAN

jnoianl@swarthmore.edu

Last Saturday Swarthmore Men's Soccer
improved to 10-2-1 (5-1 CC) and won its fifth
straight match with an impressive 3-0 away
victory over Centennial Conference opponent Franklin & Marshall. After receiving

votes in the NSCAA/Adidas national rank-

ings poll last week, the Garnet made it back
into the top 25 in the most recent rankings,
rounding out the list at number 25. The
Diplomats fell to 7-5-2 (2-2-2 CC) with the loss
and ended a three-game winning streak.
In recent history this conference
matchup has been tightly contested. Six out
of the last nine meetings have been decided
by a 1-0 score, including all of the last four.
Last season's match even went into overtime

before the Garnet's Ladule Lako Lo Sarah,
now a senior, managed to net a goal. The fact
that Swarthmore dominated this season's
game against Franklin & Marshall is a good
litmus test for the Garnet: it is a very strong
team this year.
The Garnet struck early in the match,
scoring its first goal in the fifth minute.
Swarthmore midfielder Yoi Tibbetts 'O9 sent
a chip over the Diplomats defense to fellow
midfielder Dylan Langley 'lO. Langley, coming from the right, sent a one-touch shot to
the left side of the net, beating Franklin &
Marshall keeper Zach Zamek. The Garnet
finished the half with four shots to the
Diplomat's one. The second half brought
more goal-scoring action. In the 53rd minute
Swarthmore midfielder Micah Rose 'l2
scored his first collegiate goal on a direct
kick from about 25 yards out. The Garnet's
third and final goal came in the 68th minute
when Gage Newman 11 crossed the ball
from the right side of the field. Lako Lo
Sarah 'O9 finished the pass with a sliding
shot.
Swarthmore also scored three goals in
the game against Ursinus the first Saturday
of Fall Break. Forward Evan Nesterak 'O9
led the Garnet with two goals, one in the 39th
minute and one in the 46th minute. The first
came off a corner kick by Jason Thrope 'O9.
Nesterak, unguarded on the far post, fired
the ball into the net. The second goal came 20
seconds into the second half when Nesterak
retrieved his own rebound and sent it into
the back of the net. Fabian Castro'l2 scored

THE PHOENIX

the final Garnet goal in the 86th minute off a
cross by Andreas Lagos 11
Ursinus denied Swarthmore keeper
David D'Annunzio 'l2 the blank sheet in the
89th minute when Bears' midfielder John
But
George headed in a free kick.
D'Annunzio redeemed himself in the game
against Franklin & Marshall, earning the
shutout in that match. He had an easier time
of it, however, as the Diplomats only managed one shot on goal the entire game. "We
held our defensiveshape very well," Lako Lo
Sarah said, explaining the inability of
Franklin & Marshall to generate goal-scoring opportunities. He added that "the best
defense is a good attack." Swarthmore Head
Coach Eric Wagner had a similar take on the
ineffectiveness of the Diplomats. "We were
strong enough defensively and we were in
control of the ball," he said. Wagner also
credited defenders Rory Stackpole 'O9 and
Jeff Kushner 'O9, calling their play "outstanding." "[Franklin & Marshall] couldn't
penetrate into the backfield."
He also noted that Gage Newman, a
defender, had an assist in the game. The fact
that a defender participated in the attack is
a testament to the ball control of the Garnet.
MidfielderErnesto Manzo 'll explained the
Garnet's ability to possess saying, "The team
showed a lot of patience and didn't force any
passes." "When Swarthmore soccer comes
out to play there are few teams who can
match our creativity and playmaking
skills," he said. "We could have scored five
more [goals] if we wanted," Wagner said. He
was mostpleased, however, that every single
healthy player on the team got on the field
during the match. "It shows the depth of our
team and the commitment of all of our players," he said.
Looking forward, the Garnet has three
matches left in the regular season, two of
which are against teams with losing records.
Nonetheless, Wagner insisted that "we have
a pretty important stretch of games coming
up." In the last few weeks Wagner wants to
work on the back line of his team. "We're
still not as strong as I want to be defensively," he said. "We're so excited about attacking that sometimes we get a little lazy or
careless [on defense], and not as patient as
we need to be." Look for the Garnet to shut
down its next opponent, McDaniel, on Oct. 25
at 7 p.m. on Clothier Field.

The Swarthmore Women's Volleyball
Team (5-16, CC 1-5) continued a rocky season this past weekend with a loss to
Centennial Conference rival Johns
Hopkins University in three sets, 25-9, 2516, 25-14. Over fall break, the women
played a solid match against Dickinson
College for their Digging For A Cure
Fundraiser, eventually losing in four sets,
22-25, 25-22, 25-19, 25-22.
Though the Swarthmore women outpaced the Blue Jays in digs, 43 to 40, the
Garnet had trouble producing significant
offense, supplying far fewer kills per
attempt than usual. During the match,
Genny Pezzola 'l2 led the team with 13 digs
on defense while Kearney Bangs 10 added
that same number of sets.
"On offense, we couldn't keep the ball
in the court," Coach Harleigh Chwastyk
said. The Johns Hopkins women also had
a sizable advantage in numbers. While the
Swarthmore team struggled with numbers, Johns Hopkins had a heft of experience and players on their team with five
seniors and six juniors.
Despite the disappointing loss to Johns
Hopkins, this fall break can be seen as fairly positive on the whole. The Dickinson
match marked positive performances for
many members of the team. Jen Wang 'O9
posted 13 kills and a team high of 22 digs
and libero Erin Heaney 'O9 tied the team
high for digs. Two other players, Hillary

Santana 'l2 and Pezzola, contributed dou-

ble-digit dig counts.
All of these digs proved to be immensely important for the team's aptly named
Digging For A Cure Fundraiser. The team

received both standard donations and
matching donations (i.e. a donor could
contribute a dollar a dig) in its National
Breast Cancer Awareness Month initiative. A usual match might end with 60 or
so digs on the part of the Swarthmore
women this time, it was 94.
Along with a clinic the Swarthmore
women held for high school students,
which raised $l5O, the donations for this
year's Digging For A Cure fundraiser may
far exceed expectations (though the actual
figures have not been added up yet). Other

Centennial Conference teams also participated in the fundraiser and after the collection of donations is completed, a final
figure for the total donations should be
available.
Fall break also marked an opportunity
for the team to engage in more relaxing,
team-building activities. "We had a
'Rocky' workout at the Philadelphia Art
Museum where we ran up and down the
stairs and up and down Benjamin
Franklin Boulevard while the coach
would talk at us about how we were the
underdogs, like Rocky," Sarah Lambert 11
said. Lambert also mentioned that the
team went bowling, went on a haunted
hayride, and had a team dinner, courtesy
of the team's first years. Pezzola (a first
year herself) praised the classy dinner,
noting the cheesecake and her own pomegranate salad.
The volleyball season comes to an end
in two weeks, granting only four more
matches this season for the women to
come out on the court and play their
hearts out. For seniors, these will be their
last four matches on the Swarthmore
team. The Garnet is putting together a
Senior Day at the game against Gettysburg
College this Saturday at 1 PM for the outgoing senior women, Wang and Heaney, to
celebrate their tremendous achievements
over their careers and during this season.
The team hopes to break the school attendance record for volleyball games this season and this game should prove to be an

exciting opportunity.
Looking at this season in perspective,
Wang reached the career 1,000-kill milestone in the middle of September and Erin
Heaney shattered the school's career dig
record in early October and has surpassed
1,500 digs. Chwastyk comments that "The
program has taken a huge leap over the
past five years," and certainly, the Garnet
has played solid, competitive volleyball

this season.

Chwastyk added that "You need to falter sometimes," a lesson we could all learn
(and one that was echoed in Rocky). It feels
as if the women are ready to put the past
weeks behind them and fight out these
next two weeks. Pezzola stated the team's
situation best: "We need to play how we
can play all out."

Field hockey regroups after tough losses

Hadley Roach battles with the McDaniel squad on Oct. 4.
BY DANNY FRIEL

dfriell@swarthmore.edu

While most Swarthmore students
enjoyed rest and relaxation over October
break last week, the field hockey team kept
busy with two challenging conference
matchups. The double proved to be a tall
order for the Garnet and they suffered losses
by a score of 4-0 against Dickinson on
Saturday and by a score of 5-3 against
Muhlenberg on Wednesday. The team
dropped to 5-10, standing at 1-6 in Centennial
Conference play.
Despite the two losses, however, members of the team are optimistic about the
remainder of the season. "We came together
as a team and despite our losses, we came
away from the games with some things to
focus on in the next two weeks of the season
to finish strong," co-captain Ashley Gunter
'O9 said.

Last Saturday, Dickinson played a consistent game on their home field to keep the
Garnet at bay. The Red Devils broke into
winning territory by reaching 6-5 for the
win, and improved to 2-2 in Centennial
Conference play. Katie Ashmore 'll tallied

seven saves for Swarthmore in the loss.
Against Muhlenberg, which improved to
5-8 (2-4 CC) with the victory, the Garnet
matched their opponents with three goals
apiece in the second half, but were unable to
overcome a 2-0 deficit after a strong first
period by the Mules.
It was Sophia Ferguson 'll who put
Swarthmore on the board in the 51st minute
off a pass from Natalie Stone 'O9. Ferguson
scored again less than seven minutes later to
bring Swarthmore within two goals of their
opponent, but after Nicki Notarinni 'lO

added another tally for Muhlenberg late in
the second period, the victory became even
more difficult to salvage. However, when
Ashley Gunter 'O9 fired a successful penalty

20

\

shot with less than four minutes left in play,
it was clear the Garnet would not relent.
Ferguson indicated a bit of frustration
that the score of the game did not accurately
reflect the level of play her teammates put
forth on the field. "We have had some beautiful passing plays, particularly in the midfield, but ultimately, we need to work on our
aggressiveness and consistency throughout
the entire game," she said, hinting that the
women are on the brink of putting together
something special. She added that "in the
next two weeks our team will continue to
focus on our one-op-one defense and communication on the field."
Ashmore and Gina Grubb 'lO split playing time in goal against the Mules, notching
three and nine saves, respectively.

Gettysburg at noon. The Bullets stand at 9-5
(4-2 CC) this season, and are expected to provide tough competition for the Garnet. Still,

Swarthmore has taken on a schedule riddled
with nationally ranked opponents this season (Gettysburg is the fourth top-20 team on
the Garnet schedule), and is prepared to
again test their strength against one of the
top teams in the country.

Gaunter said that the team is staying positive despite its recent losses. "It's definitely
easy io get discouraged after the two losses
but we just have to put them behind us,
learn from our mistakes, and get ourselves
together mentally and physically to face
Gettysburg on Saturday. We're just looking
to have fun playing the game we all love,"

Gunter said.

Looking ahead to next year, the team will

have a huge void to fill after several seniors
graduate this year. With only seven field
players returning after this season, the program will look to the class of 2013 to make a
major impact. Gunter recognizes that "there
is definitely a sense of urgency to recruit
new players" and has "no doubt that [first-\
year head] Coach [Lauren] Fuchs will
recruit top-notch athletes for our team."
Ferguson agrees, confident that Fuchs has
the ability "to find the types of players we

need and ensure thatthe program continues
to grow and strengthen in the following
years."
Lara Hasychak 'l2, the only first-year on
this year's roster, has quickly learned the
dynamics of team building and recruiting.
Hasychak admitted, "It is pretty difficult
having only two subs. We are losing a lot of
important players [due to graduation], so we
definitely want to try to recruit well for next
year because we might not even have

enough players."

Meanwhile, the women look to throw
down the gauntlet this Saturday when they
host Centennial Conference rival #l4
