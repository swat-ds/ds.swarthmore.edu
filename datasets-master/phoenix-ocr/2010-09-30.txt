Signs carried by Simon Deng and Abdel Adam during the Sudan Freedom Walk call for actions to protect Southern Sudan.

by

At the tender age of nine, Simon

Deng witnessed the killings of his
friends and family. Last Sunday, during a talk about the Sudan Freedom
Walk held in Kolhberg, Deng recollect-

ed that in the midst of a land robbed of
its freedom, he was robbed of his childhood innocence as he was kidnapped
and sold into slavery by the Northern
Arab Sudanese. He was treated like an
animal and silenced.
Today, Deng, a free man living in
New York state, is a voice for those still
enslaved in Sudan. About a dozen students listened to Deng and Dr. Abdel
Gabar Adam, his partner in the Walk,
talk about their experiences in Sudan
and continued efforts to bring peace
and liberty to the people of Sudan.
Eva McKend 'll, a member of Swat
STAND, a human rights group on campus, organized the talk on Sunday. "I
first met Simon when he came to visit
my high school my sophomore [year],"
McKend said. "Ever since then we've
stayed in contact and he's become a
family friend."
The Sudan Freedom Walk stopped in
Philadelphia for a rally, before participants set on course again, aiming to
arrive in Washington, D.C. on October
7 for a freedom rally. Deng expects
members of the Senate to participate,
and it is his hope that President Obama
will make an appearance as well.
The goal of the Walk is to gain attention for the cause not only from the
American People but also from the
Obama administration. Adam wants
the Obama administration to take
responsibility for the outcome of the
upcoming elections in Sudan. This

election will be held in January 2011
and will determine whether or not
South Sudan breaks away from the
North to form a new country.
According to Adam, the second goal
is to help refugees still in need of aid.
"Three point four million [Sudanese
refugees] are in camps," Adam said.
"We have 3,000 UN troops helping to
ensure their security, but they're not
able to do their job because they can't
shoot to kill; we want the Obama
administration to help the mandate so
that troops can properly protect innocent civilians."
During the first Sudan Freedom
Walk in 2006, Simon led a rally in DC
that lobbied for peace in Darfur. The
Walk resulted in a bill being passed in
the Senate for the US Government to
bring the CPA (Comprehensive Peace
Agreement) to the leaders of North and
South Sudan to be signed in the presence of the US and other European
countries.
As a part of the agreement, the people of South Sudan will choose whether
they want to stay a part of the North or
create a nation of their own.
Though this is only the second
Sudan Freedom Walk, as Deng sees it,
the South Sudanese have been walking
since 1955. "The North did not look at
the South as people," Deng said. "They
looked at them as an abite, which
means slave, simply because they are
black, regardless of religion."
In his talk Deng recounted the horrors he witnessed as a young boy
before he was kidnapped.
"When the North began burning
down villages in the South, the
Southerners ran away to safety they
walked to Kenya, Uganda and the
Congo; some of them live here today

...

and are referred to as the Lost Boys
and Girls," Deng said.
Deng noted in his speech that
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said
that the situation in Sudan is a ticking
time bomb. "The public cannot sit
around and watch the bomb go off
knowing that it is ticking," said Deng.
That is why we are going to
"

Washington".

One of the audience members,
Elliana Bisgaard-Church 'l3 had no
regrets about attending the talk. "We

Swarthmore," Bisgaard-Chuuch said.
"This really refocused me and I know
everything I'm studying will someday
have an impact, it just brings me back
to earth."
Throughout their walk, Deng and
Adam have been periodically stopping
at each city, spreading the word and
getting in touch with elected officials.
"We're talking to people, calling the
White House and leaving messages,"
Adam said. "We want action to stop the
killing in Darfur; we have to go back to

the basics."
After he said this, he recited the
White House phone number, which he
knows by heart, which was received by
a wave of chuckles in the audience. But
it is a true testimony to how dedicated
he and Simon Deng are to this movement. At the talk Deng said that this is
not an isolated event but something
that will affect all of us in the end. He
recited the words of the late Reverend
Dr. MartinLuther King: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."

Senator holds panel on Pa. bioscience industry
BY LAUREN KIM

lkiml@swarthmore.edu

On Thursday, State Senator Edwin
'Ted' Erickson of the 26th District of
which
includes
Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Chester counties,
brought a Senate hearing on the state's
standing in the bioscience industry to
the college.
The bioscience industry encompasses areas such as biotechnology, pharmaceutical progress, devices and diagnostics, contract research and laboratory equipment.
The hearing was held in the
Scheuer Room, courtesy of an invitation by President Rebecca Chopp.
Those present at the meeting were primarily CEOs of bioscience industry
organizations and members of the
Senate panel. No students were pres-

ent.

The format of the hearing was set to
allow CEOs present their testimonies
detailing Pennsylvania's top rankings
in each area of the biosciences and
plans to help maintain these prestigious positions.

Erickson began the hearing by
thanking Chopp for agreeing to host
the hearing at the college, saying that
the group had been looking for a local
college to conduct the event in order to
increase the "sense of community."
Introductory comments also included mention of the fact
that
Swarthmore ranks fifth among certified US colleges in the highest percentage of graduates pursuing medical and
bioscience-related jobs. Even in these
times of economic hardships, the bioscience industry represents a significant part of society. Erickson emphasized the industry's national importance by saying that any disturbances
posed troubles equally for both
Democrats and Republicans.
-

"There is a 7 to 1 financial multiplier between the bioscience industry
and the other aspects of society for
Pennsylvania," Erickson said in an
interview. "We here in Pennsylvania
are rich, academic-based, particularly
in the southeast. We also have a very
strong pharmaceutical industry and it
is important that we nurture that."
As such, the financial gains from
the bioscience industry reach up to as
much as seven times more than the
proceeds made from other professional
work areas.
After
the
introductory

research awards from the National
Institutes ofHealth in 2009.
From 2001 to 2008, the state experienced an overall growth in bioscience
employment alone of 10.9% and an
establishment growth of 10.7%. This is
compared to the figures of LB% growth
in employment and 2.1% in establishment for the total private sector in the
commonwealth.
But Molineaux also addressed a current concern for those in the industry,
which deals with the question of how

an interview. "This way, legislation
can't suddenly change their mind two
years into the project and back out."
Erickson continued to lead the indepth clarification process by inquiring into Molineaux's ideas for commercializing the 10 Year Plan.
"The legislature is getting more
skeptical about putting money into
universities, so how do you plan to
make [the plan] so that it will fit to
each individual legislator's interests,"
said Senator Andrew E. Dinniman of
the 19th District, one of the senators on
the question panel.
Molineaux, in response, referred to
the importance of universities and the
impact they would have on their
respective state. He said that with the
positive change in universities and
technology transfer offices in each, as
well as increased identification and
awareness of technology sitting idle in
the universities, the legislation would
have enough motivation to create
more jobs statewide.
Leaders of other bioscience industry groups such as BioAdvance, the
Center for Technology Transfer and
Midway Pharmaceuticals also shared
positive comments on Pennsylvania's
nationally ranked status in the bioscience industry. They also had their
own concerns regarding the maintenance of such prestige of the state.
'The capital crunch is particularly
untimely," said Barbara Schilberg,
CEO of BioAdvance. "It is critical that
a new and more certain line for capital
is established."
The meeting concluded with a presentation of the Senate panel's feedback
on the testimonies. These leaders will
submit their proposals for further
developing Pennsylvania's bioscience
industry standing to legislation for
approval.

E-mails to student body
Student Council recommended to Braun that The
Phoenix not be allowed to
send weekly e-mails to the
student body.
The decision was reacheddespite a recent campus-wide
poll that revealed only 22.8% of
students believe the Daily
Gazette should be the only
news source with that privilege.

An additional 413% of students said they would like
both the Daily Gazette and the
Phoenix to automatically
subscribe students to their
daily digest.

Braun suggested that
there should be a pilot program which would allow The
Phoenix to e-mail the entire
school for a semester or a
year, and then decide which
course of action should be
taken.
"It's certainly something

discuss the details of updating the boards at their next
meeting.
Dash for Cash
Dennis Fan 'll, the captain
of the men's rugby team,
attended the meeting to ask
StuCo for advice on how to
reinstate the Dash for Cash.
The Dash was a bi-annual tradition of streaking through
Parrish Hall that was prohibited last year after complaints
about other instances of
streaking by the rugby team.

Though the captain admitted that "lots of things went
bad, lots of things went awry,"
he said the Dash for Cash is "a
part of campus tradition, and
a safe form of campus nudity."StuCo suggested the rugby
team gauge students' opinions about the event, but
tabled the discussion until
next week.

Short-term Goals
Student Council voted to
put forth a television repair
initiative, a laptop sharing
program,
and a student
resource for those planning
events on a list of short-term
goals.

StuCo also intends to meet
with Linda McDougall, the
director of dining services, to
discuss possible initiatives
involving food. Some of these
initiatives include using meal
points in the Ville and providing organic food in Sharpies.

Bike Share hits roadblock with shortage of bikes

beginning of the summer,
even after most people had

During the first week of
the program before summer
vacation, the total number of
students who checked out the
bikes rose to eighteen. Just
these past two weeks, however, only seven people have
been able to rent bikes. In
spite of this decrease, students have still been trying to
make use of the program.
"People come to the desk
and they're disappointed that
there are only two to check
out," Masterpasqua said.
"Those two bikes that are
still working still do go out a
lot."
Nick Borkowski 'l3 used
the program for a total of
three times this fall before
deciding to buy his own bike.
"The bikes were not in
great shape," he said. "One of
the bicycles that I was able to
check out doesn't go uphill at

BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT
qgounotl@swarthmore.edu

Earlier in September, the Peaslee
Debate raised the topic of long-distance
relationships to the Swarthmore community, pitting the Peaslee Debate
Team against President Rebecca Chopp
and Dean Liz Braun. Now, three students have founded GORILLA (Group of
Really Intense, Long Love

Affairs), a student organization aimed at students with
significant others off campus.
For as successful as the
Quaker Matchbox may be,
there are still many Swatties
involved in long-distance relationships, prompting the creation of the support group.
According
to
Frank

Mondelli
one
of
GORILLA'S founders, the
group can be best defined as "a group
for people on campus who are in longdistance relationships and want to find
a supportive community for people who

can serve as a forum for valuable relationship advice and be a resource for

Founders Mondelli, Riana Shah 'l4

needed someone to talk to
about their "LDRs." Both Mondelli and
Shah soon realized that many students
in long-distance relationships did not
have a support network to discuss their
relationship situations.
One major difficulty for many people
in long-distance relationships is seeing
each other less often than those in proximal relationships. For Mondelli and
Shah, this point was not as much of an
issue, as both of them were already in

long-distance relationships before they
came to Swarthmore. Still, the distance
separating Mondellifrom his girlfriend
has significantly increased, from an
hour away within New York state to
five hours across state lines. Shah's sit-

uation, on the other hand, remains

practically unchanged because of the
much larger scale of the distance in her

Mondelli and Shah expressed the
opinion that, especially for students
who were very confident in their longdistance relationships, the pervasive
emphasis on the idea of the Quaker
Matchbox might be rather insensitive.
Some students in long-distance relationships at Swarthmore also report
other people commenting on their relationships in very cynical or negative
ways. Common jokes revolve around
the crudely nicknamed "Turkey Dump,"

ety of tips that will appeal to
wm
users from both camps, and
I'll introduce a new enemy that causes the two to forget
their differences and unite in common defense.
Speeding up your PC/Mac
One of the most consistently recurring issues that we
face at the ITS Help Desk is the inevitably slow computer.
Barring the unresponsiveness that results from virus/malware infections (I'll discuss that in its own section), there
are three primary issues for Macs and PCs alike that lead
to a slow computer. The good news is that they are all easily fixable. The first and most telling issue is the amount of
RAM your computer has. RAM is what enables your computer to run multiple programs at once without slowing
down/crashing. Swarthmore's official recommended
amount of RAM is 4 gigabytes, and that will likely increase
in the next few years, as new computers are increasingly
capable of handling higher amounts of RAM. If you are currently running on anything less than IGB, you are probably suffering from massive amounts of time wasted waiting
for programs to open or documents to load, and you may
have an instinctive hatred of anything shaped like an hourglass or a pinwheel (sorry to all the pinup ladies and Booh
Bahs out there). Bottom line: upgrade to 4-BGB of ram and
your life will improve drastically. Use www.crucial.com to
determine which type of RAM is right for your computer,
and then either buy it there or check www.newegg.com for
excellent deals. Installation is fairly straightforward, stepby-step instructions are always available online, and ITS
even has a technician who is certified to install new RAM
on Dells and Macs.
If RAM isn't the culprit, it's possible that you simply
have too many programs running at once. Programs are
like children
sometimes you really want them, sometimes you really don't, but regardless, they will use up a lot

of your resources. Many websites, like insidious storks,
will try to leave small programs bundled at your doorstep
when you download their software. Worse, if you don't take
the proper precautions, many PC manufacturers will
impregnate your computer with their preloaded software
that is very difficult to expunge. To get rid of all these
resource hogging programs, try removing them from the
Add/Remove programs section of your PC, or try going to
Start->Run->msconfig, and go to the "startup" tab and
uncheck the boxes of any of the offending clutter programs
so they will no longer start when you turn on your computer.

Finally, if programs aren't the issue, you may just have
a wildly disorganized hard drive, and so your processor
has to spend its time helping your hard drive find anything
you tell it to look for. In this case, try running the disk
defragmenter for Windows,, or the disk verify/repair for
Macs. These [benevolent] programs rearrange the content
of your drive so that your system can easily locate it, which
translates into fewer minutes spent haplessly watching a
spinning wheel or hourglass.
Enhancing Security
One of the toughest issues we face at ITS is keeping the
Swarthmore network secure against internal and external
threats. Over 50% of the emails received at Swarthmore are
spam, which translates to over 50,000 spam messages every
day, any one of which could potentially contain or redirect
you to a virus that could infect the entire network.
External networks of zombie computers routinely try to
break through Swarthmore's defenses to infect its users.
Zombie computers refer to any machines that, at a hacker's
will, can suddenly wake up and begin obeying the hacker's
bidding. Anyone's computer could become a zombie, and in
the vast majority of cases, people have no prior knowledge
that their computer is infected. Threats also come

in more

physical forms, like theft, faulty hardware or (be prepared
to gasp in indignation) from your own clumsiness! Be
aware that at any given moment, your hard drive can suddenly fail. For some especially unfortunate people, their
computers are shipped to them with an already-failed hard
drive. And if it doesn't fail naturally (most hard drives
aren't expected to last through more than 4 years of extensive use), there's always the chance that you'll drop the
computer, thereby causing you to lose everything. A drop
of oply a few inches is enough to render your hard drive
completely inoperable.
So what you can you do to protect yourself from these
circumstances? My first recommendation is to buy an
external hard drive to back up your existing data. Think to
yourself, "Are all the files on my computer, including all
my photos, music, etc., collectively worth at least $5O to

me?" (keep in mind that you probably spent over $lOO for
your camera and another $5O for your memory cards to
take and store those photos). If so, go directly to
www.newegg.com and purchase either a Seagate or a
Western Digital external hard drive with drive space commensurate to about 2-4 the current space on your hard
drive to allow for future expansion. A good 250G8 external
drive will run about $5O; talk to any person on campus who
has lost all their data and they will calmly reassure you
that they would have preferred to spend upwards of $2OO to
have been spared the stress of catastrophic data loss, a significant difference from the fairly nominal $5O investment
they could have otherwise made.
In addition to your data being destroyed, it can also be
easily stolen. If you routinely save your passwords, consider that if someone gains access to your computer, whether
locally (stealing your computer) or remotely (hacking it),
they would immediately be able to easily access all your
personal information. Hackers also have programs that
can crack through 8-character passwords within hours, so
consider switching to a longer "passphrase" instead of a
traditional password (think "DontH@ckM3Ple@se" rather
than "Passwordl23"). And, most importantly, stop using
Internet Explorer immediately. It is the most insecure
browser in the world today. Hackers of the 21st century are
motivated primarily by money, and there are entire
schools of hackers being trained in other countries to create programs/malware that can infect as broad a portion of
the world population as possible; they then rent out control
of thousands of these infected zombie computers to companies wishing to send out spam or unleash massive attacks
upon other websites. Naturally, these hackers direct the
vast brunt of their attention to whichever platforms have
the largest user base. Worldwide, Internet Explorer has
over 60% of the usage share, compared to Firefox's 24% and
Google Chrome's 7%. This translates into IE facing the vast
majority of the world's cyber attacks. Add this to the fact
that Internet Explorer is consistently outperformed (in
many cases drastically) by both Firefox and Chrome, and I
think you have all the proof you need to make the switch.
I sincerely hope that my tips prove useful in your technological endeavors, if only because I'd prefer to not one
day receive spam from your foolishly infected computer.
As I said in my last article, I've been hacked, I've had my
hard drive crash on me and I've become intimately
acquainted with the truly horrendous feelings (and economic costs) associated with virtually, every technological
catastrophe. But I am lucky enough to live to tell about it,
and I shall indeed continue doing so
so stayed tuned for

guidebook. However, the reaction is
almost always the same
sheer delight
at meeting an American visiting their
country.

When traveling in these countries,

anti-

Americanism. To be sure, some of our
foreign policies are often no more popular abroad than they are at home, but
only the occasional French or Dutch
tourist will hold you personally responsible for the war in Iraq. I can count on my
fingers the number of people who have
given me any trouble for being
American: three from France, one from
the Netherlands, one from Portugal, one
from Scotland, and two from Spain.
However, even most Western Europeans
would rather talk about beer or soccer,
and I had a great time traveling through
several countries with a French tourist.
By contrast, the locals I met in Turkey
went to almost absurd lengths to differentiate between the current wars and
America. In Kosovo, American flags are
more common than Kosovar flags and the
local Muslim population sees America
(and NATO) as their liberators. A couple
of locals in Peje, Kosovo invited me and a
French student I had been traveling with
(even
among
the French,
antiAmericanism isn't common) to spend the
night so that we could see the nearby
soon-to-be-national park. At the border
crossing to enter Georgia, the soldiers

patted me on the back and the locals all
wanted to shake hands with me and even
kiss me for traveling from America to

visit their country.
Almost every local that I have met
during my travels has been thrilled to be
able to show some part of their country to
an American. An Armenian couple on
my minibus to Yerevan, Armenia shouted at the driver to slow down whenever
we approached an important church (as
well as the American embassy) and
worked with other passengers to teJJ me

their country's history in English. The
curators of one museum in Lithuania,
upon discovering that they had run out of
English floor plans, walked through the

entire museum with me.

America's-.efforts to end the Soviet
Union's oppression of Eastern Europe,
Serbia's massacres of Bosnian and
Albanian Muslims and post-Soviet
Russia's bullying of its neighbors mean
that Presidents Reagan, Clinton and
Bush are possibly more popular out here
than in the United States. In places like
Georgia and Ukraine, nonviolent revolutions brought pro-American presidents to
power. For many of the locals I met, the
United States offers a hope and a model

a society with freedom of speech,
prosperity, and security from Russia.
And everywhere, American culture is
quite popular. Every European I meet
seems to tell me about another American
television show that I have never seen.
Occasionally, I have come across a
negative part of being an American that I
had not expected. Some people seem to
view Americans as having super powers
and limitless amounts of cash at all
times. To be sure, American citizenship
carries significant privileges (customs is
always quick at the borders) and
American society contains unbelievable
wealth. However, it can be frustrating to
explain to someone that I cannot have
their Facebook account unblocked or
that I'm simply uninterested in buying
their product.
Still, these things are just annoyances
and pale in comparison to the dire warnings I always read online about how dan-

for

gerous the world is for American
tourists. In my experience traveling in
Eastern Europe and the Middle East,

there's nothing better than being an
American abroad.

Swat Style Snapshot
Names: Harold Blum and Corey Silberstein
Year: 2012
From: Tenafly, NJ and Williamstown, MA

Current Residence: Parrish

What They're Wearing:
"These are my corduroys. They're like my all-purpose
pants, like I wear them pretty much every day during
like fall, winter and spring," Blum said of his J.Crew
cords. His navy sweater, which he's had for five years, is
from Gap. He found his khaki L.L. Bean jacket with a red
plaid lining in a closet at his house.
Silberstein is also wearing corduroys from Eddie
Bauer, but they are actually his dad's pants. His sweater
is from Columbia Sportswear. "We're both wearing
Sperrys [Top-Siders]. We love them, I mean, they go really well with cords," Silberstein said. Blum also added
that they love wearing Sperry Top-Siders because of their
versatility with "the muted tones we wear."
Silberstein and Blum have been friends since freshman year and with their similar styles, it's inevitable
that they could be wearing very similar outfits the same
lay. Their pictured outfits could easily be mirror images,
with their cords, blue sweaters and Sperrys. But they do
switch things up, such as Blum's jacket. Their looks are
very reminiscent of the J.Crew or Banana Republic man,
with dressed-up cords and the preppy, put-together look
with their Sperrys, sweaters and jackets.
How They Describe Their Style:
"Freshman year, we realized that we have

vefy similar sense of style and wore similar clothing," Blum said,
also adding that they have the same 30 x 30 pant size.
Their friend Linnet Davis-Stermitz 'l2 dubbed their
matching styles the "dad" look and at first, both Blum
and Silberstein thought it was a ridiculous generalization. "But then thinking back to the way our dads both
dress, we actually realized that their styles are very
classy and we're inspired by that, although we think that
we add a more youthful touch to that kind of clothing,"
Silberstein said.
"We've tried to pin down the main characteristics of
the dad' style," Blum said. First, they favor a muted
palette for their clothes. "I think that's part of the 'dad'
ethos. You no longer need to attract the mate, so you don't
need flashy colors anymore," Blum said. Silberstein

10

added, though, that that ethos doesn't apply to them entirely, since "of
course [it's] our intention to still
&
look good." Both also wear several
layers every day, such as Blum's outwith a jacket, sweater and cotton
irt. "It just gives us more creativity
with our style," Silberstein said. "We
can have different kinds of things that
we're wearing." He also joked that the
"genesis" of their "dad" layering technique is to be prepared for any weather
and also have an extra layer to give
your kid. Blum and Silberstein both
find that their corduroys and Sperrys
are essential to their everyday outfits.
"Everyone wears jeans all the time and
it's like the corduroys kind of set us

|

■,

Where They Shop:
"I guess, L.L. Bean [and] J.Crew," Blum
said. Silberstein also likes L.L. Bean, but
tends to shop at the Gap. While they do find
inspiration
from their dads, and

Silberstein's favorite cords were his
father's, they don't always shop through
their fathers' clothes. "We're not exactly imitating our dads' style," Silbersteinsaid. "That
could be disastrous."
Fashion Inspirations / Influences:
Silberstein credits his dad with influencing
his style. But both of them did not have much
else that truly inspired their look. "I guess it's
like a youthful take on the dad's style," Blum
said. He also added that he likes Bob Saget's
quintessential dad look as Danny Tanner in
"Full House."
H
Never Leave the House Without:
"I never leave the house without these shoes,"
Silberstein said about his Sperrys. "These are, like, my
go-to shoes." Both of them agree that, for them, Sperry
Top-Siders are essential, as they both love their comfort
and longevity. "I just think they're really classy," he said.

Music and dance combine in traditional prayers

The presence of indigenous Aztec group Cetiliztli
was heard and felt on campus last Saturday. Enlace
brought Cetiliztli to campus to share ancient
Mexican prayers with Swarthmore students as part
ofLatino Heritage Month.
Enlace, the campus's Latino and Hispanic group,
invited the indigenous Aztec group in order to "educate the Swarthmore community about Latino identity, culture and heritage," Enlace Co-President
Luis Penate said. Enlace's objective this year is to
explore Latino identity. Penate said that in relation

Cetiliztli was delayed arriving to campus. But this
delay only enhanced the effect of the prayers as they
were unintentionally performed in twilight.
Cetiliztli translates to "group of the four directions,
east of the continent." Thus, they began the evening
by "honoring the energies in each direction."

Honoring Joan Friedman's memory with tango
BY DINA ZINGARO
dzingarl@swarthmore.edu
With the beginning of the fall
semester, the Latin American Studies
Program is missing an essential member of its team, Professor Joan Esther
Friedman. Friedman passed away this
summer at the age of 67 after suffering
a cerebral aneurysm, rendering a
great loss to family, friends, and the
Swarthmore community.
At 4 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 1, the community will pay tribute to Professor
Friedman with a Tango Concert and
Dance Recital in LPAC. Staff members
collaborated to organize Friday's tribute, which they hope will serve as a
celebration of the delight and flair
with which Friedman lived life. The
Eduardo Tami Quintet from Argentina
will be opening the concert, followed
by others including Jose Padula,
Julian Plaza, and Anibal Troilo who
will perform the Latin American
styles of tango, milonga and vals.
Conductor and flutist Eduardo

THE PHOENIX

Tami said, "Music [can] reach the
heart and the emotions, and in many
occasions awake them, and in my personal case, when I die I would [hope]
that my friends [throw] a big party,
with music, dance, drinks and food.
So, the best that I can offer to another
one is what I want for me."
The selections of performers and
pieces reflect not only Friedman's
travels to Argentina, but also her own
infatuation with both the music and
dance style of Latin America, and
most specifically the tango.
In the 19205, the tango peaked,in
popularity in Buenos Aires, and many
of the tango orchestras featured
Jewish musicians. Professor of
Spanish Luciano Martinez, who
taught
alongside
Friedman in
Advanced Spanish in 2008, remembers
Friedman's own "fascination [with]
Argentina's Jewish tradition," and
believes she was "so drawn to tango
because it embraced her Jewish and
Latin American heritage, but also
because tango had that profound

melancholy, which echoed the sense

of

dislocation

of

the

Jewish

Diaspora."

"Joan had a tremendous love for
anything that had to do with the traditions of her country," Associate
Professor of Spanish Aurora Camacho
de Schmidt said.
Earlier on the day of the concert, at
12:30 p.m. at the Meeting House, the
Swarthmore community will hold a
memorial service and in the Quaker
tradition, attendants are encouraged
to share thoughts about their personal loss of Joan and the special impact
she had on their lives.
In the Spanish department,
Friedman taught at each of the course
levels before becoming a lecturer for
the department. Colleagues and staff
members not only note Friedman's
intellectual contributions to the community, but also mourn the loss ofher
special and irreplaceable presence at
the college. Camacho de Schmidt said,
"Starting the semester without her
was difficult, it was like having a car

September 30, 2010

there
without two wheels at least
was something missing."
Even Friedman's work outside the
classroom encouraged an appreciation for other cultures and traditions,
especially those ofLatin America. She
served as an advisor to the student
group HOLA, which later developed
into Enlace, and she also played an
important role in the College's
Intercultural Center.
Further reflecting an embrace of
her Jewish and Latino background,
Friedman studied the literary production ofLatin American Jewish women
as a noted translator and essayist,
with much of her work gaining international recognition. She also participated in the Latin American Jewish
studies Association (LAJSA).
fJoan just thought that everybody

how to fee a real human being before

Hip-hop artists to unleash fly beats at Olde Club

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ISAAC HAN
ihanl@swarthmore.edu
Hip-hop music is not just what you hear on the radio.
It's not just about money or fame. Sometimes it's about
expressing your identity and your ideas. This fact could
not be more evident in the diverse lineup of hip-hop
bands performing on Friday, Oct. 1 at Olde Club. Though
different styles, all four bands—Onra, BBU, Rapdragons
and Devin KKenny—find a way to express themselves
through their beats and lyrics.
The most notable of these bands, perhaps, is Onra,
whose music has been featured in a variety of commercials, such as Coca-Cola advertisements. Onra is a beat
maker from Paris, France who finds his inspiration in
the music that he experienced growing up or through his
travels.
His most notable album "Chinoiseries" was based on
old Vietnamese and Chinese records he came across
while visiting his grandparents in Vietnam. In the
album, he splices the music from the records with his
own beats, samples and voice recordings to create songs
that are as profound as they are cool.
Onra's popular song, "The Anthem," mixes beats with
Chinese vocals from the records and is modified to sound
like a rap song. This song was featured in a Coca-Cola
commercial for the Beijing Olympics.
Through his splicing of different recordings, Onra
takes what he has heard and experienced throughout his
life and makes them his own. He creates something that
is both familiar and fresh.
His new album, "Long Distance," spins soul and funk
music with futuristic house beats to update the genre,
making it transcendentally modern. The song "High
Hopes ft. Reggie B" takes a 1982 funk song of the same
name by the S.O.S Band and makes it more danceable by
present-day standards without compromising the integrity of the song's funk aspects. The song is as much the
original funk as it is the modern 'house.'
The Chicago-based hip-hop group BBU takes its opportunities in music to promote the voices of those that have
been silenced by the mainstream and forgotten or cast
aside by society. "Our music represents the change we
want to see in government and in culture. It's meant to
inspire, but our lives are also a part of it," BBU said in an
interview.
They not only use their music to raise,awareness of
social urban issues; they also help the community they
represent through social work. BBU, through their
music, seeks to stand up for those who are pushed into
criminal behavior by the pressures of a social hierarchy
that constantly fails to help them when in need and punishes them when they trip up as a result.
The conception of their original name is a representation of their mission. BBU originally stood for Bin Laden
Blowin' Up in response to how US government policies
promoted Bin Laden and essentially created him prior to
the 9/11 attacks. Through this name and their music, they
point out the irony of contradictory policies that continue to create "monsters" who are criminalized for just following the pressures that lead them to become these creatures in the first place. They hope through their music to
incite change in the world through education of what is
really happening in urban communities across the country, if not just in Chicago.
Rapdragons, from Baltimore, is a rap group that seeks
to innovate its genre and update the mainstream. The
group features Greg Ward and Nick Often, who met during their shifts at the Charles Theatre in Baltimore.
Bound by their mutual musical interests, specifically
Jay-Z, they experiment with beats and lyrics to create
something new.
"[Our music] is about creativity on a track and doing
something that hasn't been done yet," Ward said.
Following in the footsteps of great rappers such as Biggie
Smalls, Rapdragons mixes samples with its own beats
and vocals to create music which is also a storytelling
-

experience.

Their new album. "Featuring Baltimore," creates
music that seeks to create visual scenes through lyrics
and beats while mixing in the music of other Baltimore
bands. One of their songs, "Early for Work (samples 'Late
for School' by Ponytail)," plays off of the song it samples
and draws you in with a beat, but also tells you the story
of a guy who hustles through life to succeed.

12

The fourth performer, Devin KKenny, considers himself more of an artist than a traditional musician.
Sporting a studio art background, he finds in music
another medium through which he can express himself.
"I'm interested in creating art that's very visceral in
that it evokes a response," KKenny said.
Through his hip-hop, he hopes to explore the beats and
they way rappers weave rhymes to create responses in
the minds and bodies of those who hear it.
The song "Freestyle" can be considered not only a rap
song but also a poem. Each line has to rhyme and fit the
beat, some more successfully than others, but together
creates an experience of music that examines the conventions of rap.
These four artists, through their own styles, seek to
continue the conversation that is creating rap music.
They mix and experiment to make statements about and
attempt to innovate and update mainstream media and
culture. They not only seek a means for personal expression but also an opportunity to continue to add profundity to hip-hop music.
"These artists are all experimenting in very different
ways, yet all consider themselves part of the hip-hop
genre," Blaine O'Neill, Olde Club's booking director, said
in an e-mail. "I think many of these groups are interesting because they all actively incorporate themes of place,
history, and politics into their work."

Counter-terrorism tactics disregard liberties in Pa.

Heightening counter-terrorism intelligence and preserving First-Amendment rights have unfortunately fallen into a tenuous balance in Pennsylvania.
Two weeks ago it was revealed that a Philadelphiabased counter-terrorism firm paid by the state has been
monitoring and circulating information about activist
groups that did not have a history of violence or pose any
legitimate threat to the public since October. The Institute
on Terrorism Research and Response sent "security bulletins" three times a week to police, public officials and,
even, private companies about various planned protests
that were expected to draw large crowds.
Those targeted include Marcellus Shale drilling opponents, animal-rights supporters, gays, peace activists and,
even, tea party members, among others. Events as tame
and legitimate as a candlelight vigil, a screening of the
film "Gasland," a gay rights parade and anti-war demonstrations by college students were highlighted in the bulletins. And so began the conflation between "security
threat" and justified public gathering.

While Gov. Ed Rendell has said he didn't know about
the arrangement, the state homeland security director
James F. Powers Jr. called his office's hiring '&n error in
judgment." In the two weeks since this debacle, Rendell
has called an end to the $103,000 no-bid contract with the
firm by next month. Earlier this week, a public Senate
hearing started.
Testimony from this hearing, however, reveals that
including Powers
some of Rendell's top appointees
were alerted about the inflammatory and discriminatory
messages earlier, as reported by The Philadelphia

Inquirer and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The whole incident is clearly a disgrace. In a post-9/11
world, "terrorism" has confusingly started to become a
term enmeshed with activism. The state government's
arrangement is a chilling indication that an almost
decade-old hunger for information on terrorism no mathas dangerously
ter how vague or useless it may be
overshadowed First Amendment rights we have cherished for over 200 years. The irony is that this supposedly
necessary means of gathering information is ultimately
meant to uphold freedoms.
What is all the more sobering, given these events, is
that Pennsylvania has spent $2 million on counter-terrorism studies at a Philadelphia-based think tank since 2003,
according to state records and a recent Inquirer article.
Amongst this situation's other problems, the govern-

ment's response has been unfit.
Rendell has contritely expressed embarrassment about
the arrangement, noting that protesting is a "God-given
American right."
But he has not fired or reprimanded anyone, even
amidst testimony on Monday that Powers was alerted
more than once about the wide dissemination of inflammatory and useless information. Powers asserted in testimony Monday that hiring the contractors was to fill an
intelligence gap but admitted that he did not keep the governor's office properly informed.
Powers has drawn a justified amount of suspicion. And
if recently stated testimony is true, he should be fired.
Powers has apologized to activists who may have felt
their rights were being violated. "That was never the

intention," he said in testimony Monday.
But Powers' apology follows, at best, the simplistic philosophy of a child's contrition, for he ignorantly mistakes
intention with reality. Powers and, indeed, Rendell must
recognize that words are not enough to heal these wounds.
"How many people have been told to watch out for me?
That I'm a 'person of interest?'" asked Virginia Cody, an
anti-drilling activist who testified on Monday, as reported
in The Post-Gazette. "How are you going to erase that alert
in people's minds? This is not an 'oops' you can fix so easily."
She is right, especially since the issue has now gone
beyond civil liberties now.
Cody alerted the media about the state's contract after
Powers mistakenly e-mailed her thinking she was a gas
driller. "We want to continue providing this support to the

Marcellus Shale Formation natural gas stakeholders,
while not feeding those groups fomenting dissent against
those same companies," Powers wrote in the August email.
In addition to a concern of losing civil liberties, then,
comes another: a government failing to adequately regulate state-wide drilling that, by many counts, is questionable and seems more serious than a simple "error of judg-

ment."
As students at a school with strong roots in social
activism, we hope that the Senate hearing will illuminate
what exactly went wrong and who is responsible. In turn,
the government must take a stronger stance so the state
can get back on track and, of course, so this kind ofmistake never happens again.

Senate
Majority
Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who is
currently fighting to keep his Senate
seat and his status as majority leader,
has placed the Paycheck Fairness Act
on the Senate agenda before the body
adjourns next Friday.
This may be a smart political move
for Reid, showing that this is politics
as usual for the Democrats. If Reid can
force a vote on the measure, he and his
Democratic colleagues could use the
issue to
opportunistically gain
women's votes across the country.
It is unlikely that Republicans
would vote for the act. The two
Republican moderate senators from
Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan
Collins, have said that they will not
support the measure. This means the
bill has no chance of passing, even if it
is introduced.

Twitter narcissists' not getting the message
BY TIM KNUDSEN

DAILYILLINI.COM,

SEPT. 27, 2010

There's a dangerous disease
going around campus. Although
it's psychological, it's also contagious
and it's not a disease
they're giving away free tests for
at McKinley.
If you have a Twitter and are
overall a self-important person,
there is a 98 percent chance that
you are already exhibiting symp-

toms.
The symptoms may be demonstrated as follows: You're having
a great time at this raging party.
Therefore, everyone not present
needs to know about how much
more fun you're having (obviously). Moreover, maybe it doesn't
show, but you're a person who
exercises a lot. Thus, everyone
could benefit by knowing via
tweet that you lift weights in the
smelly ARC basement. Finally,
you like the cool type of music
that people blog about. Since
everyone could benefit from
knowing how hipster and/or
alternative you are, go ahead and
post a lyric!

THE PHOENIX

In these instances, you don't
feel like you're being pretentious
or an all-around tool. You're just
doing everyone else a favor by
informing them of your superiority.

If this is you, then you are suffering
from
"Twitter
Narcissism."
By this point, people most
likely think you're a big loser
and only still follow you on
Twitter so that they can laugh at
your tweets with their friends.
However, nobody takes Twitter
all that seriously in the first
place (it's no Facebook, by any
means...) so you may still have
time to salvage your dignity.
The first time I went on the
Twitter, I thought it was going to
be a good relationship. I was only
using it experimentally and I
never foresaw it becoming a
problem. My tweets consisted of
innocent things like "LOL
©friendnumberl, I can't believe
©notmyfriend said that at our
Flag Day party!" or "It's sunny
2day, @roommate2 grab some oil
and lets hit up da ARC pool
(wink/smiley
face)."
Furthermore, I genuinely cared

about what the people I was following on Twitter had to say.
This is how Twitter starts out for
people. Then you get a few more
everything
followers
and
changes.

The more followers you get,
the more Twitter will begin to
seem like a world of one to you.
You start to feel important
because people apparently care
about the 160 characters-or-less
things that you have to say. A
tweet shifts from being a source
of friendly communication to an
advertisement of you to the
world.
Twitter's overall makeup is
what feeds this problem. It's simple in the sense that the design is
not
too
multi-dimensional.
Where on Facebook a "friend' ship" is mutual, on Twitter you
can allow someone to follow you
without caring enough to follow
him or her back (happens all the
time). Facebook definitely gives
more of a community feeling
than Twitter does. However, the
creepiness of that community
feeling is the reason many people
turn to Twitter.
A 2009 study

at Rutgers

September 30, 2010

percent of Twitter users are
"informers." Right now you're
probably
thinking
"Really

studying?!" but I assure you that

edge for everyone.
"informers" use the Twitter to do
normal things such as communicate with friends, post links to
news articles and expand their
social networks.
The other 80 percent of
Twitter users are the "me-formers"
aka our Twitter narcissists. This majority rarely communicates with followers. The
topics of their tweets range from
their social lives to their emotions and everyday activities. An
example of a "me-former" would
be Mike "The Situation" from
MTV's "The Jersey Shore." "The

Situation" recently tweeted,
"The Situation is the man in all
situations." This exhibits mastery of narcissistic Twitter
behavior in the form of excessive
hubris and ego. If you are like
many who aspire to be like "The
Situation," start on Twitter by
mixing two parts self-promotion

with one part shirtless default
picture.
Maybe you're an unapologetic

Twitter narcissist who recognizes the problem but is in too
deep to make a change. Or maybe
you're like me, a recovering
Twitter narcissist who will send
an indirectly me-promoting
tweet on the twitter and automatically feel shame. It's when
your friends re-tweet you or compliment you on your Twitter-bilities that you know a relapse is
inevitable.
Either way, you're infected
and are left with two simple
options: One, you can embrace
your vain persona until Twitter
is no longer a cool thing to do
(didn't that already happen?), or
two, you can cure the problem by
going cold turkey and deleting
your account. I recommend the
second option, although I have
not succeeded in this myself.
Until it gets to that point, it's
your world
and although they
may be laughing at you, your
Twitter followers are just living
in it.

Quarterback: Kurt Warner

Runner-Up: Warren Moon

Right off the bat, one of the toughest
calls to make. Moon threw more touchdowns than Warner, passed for more
yards, and went to more Pro Bowls by a
long shot (nine to Warner's four). Moon
also had to combat the stereotype that a
black player wasn't mentally equipped
to play quarterback, and had to hone his
skills in the Canadian Football League
before joining the NFL. Still, Warner's
touchdown-interception ratio and passer
rating are much better
his 93.7 is second among retired players, a number
Moon only eclipsed in one season. Plus,
Warner won two MVPs (to Moon's one),
captained the "Greatest Show on Turf"
St. Louis offense of the early 2000s, and
got the Super Bowl ring Moon was never
able to pick up. Factor in the ridiculous
"he was stocking grocery shelves five
years before he went to the Super Bowl"
part of the story, and Warner gets the
nod.
Running Back: Marion Motley
Runner-Up: Priest Holmes

Sports lUustrated's Paul Zimmerman
called Motley "the best player in the history of football." It's not an easy claim to
back up, since some t>f Motley's best
years came on a Cleveland Browns team
that had yet to join the NFL, but the
career 5.7 yards per carry is otherworldly. Of the four black football players who
broke the sport's color barrier in 1946
(one year before Jackie Robinson),
Motley went on to have the best career
by a landslide, pulling double duty as an
elite linebacker (he never had more than
157 carries in a year, but still incredible).
Thirty years old by the time he entered
the NFL, he was still able to set the stillstanding record for yards-per-carry in a
single game, rushing for 188 yards on 11
carries for a rate of more than 17 yards
per run.
Fullback: Tony Richardson
Runner-Up: None
Joe Perry, who would be voted to the
NFL's 1950s All-Decade team, was technically labeled as a fullback, but played his
entire career in an era where the fullback carried the entire load. Not so with
Richardson, who has paved the way for
four different running backs to enjoy Pro
Bowl seasons
Priest Holmes, Larry
Johnson, Adrian Peterson, and Thomas
Jones. Plus, he's one of the most popular
teammates ofhis era at a position where
the goal is to make someone else look
good all the time and where he will
inevitably train someone to take his job.

three NFL seasons than all but one player in history (Gale Sayers), broke every

the most prolific receiver on my Madden

Raiders, the game would have gone into
overtime on a Steelers touchdown.
Guard: James Langer and Larry Little

Nate Newton was responsible for protecting and blocking for better players in
Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, but I'm
keeping the anchors of the 1972 Dolphins'
line together. Langer saw little playing

time for two years with Miami, won the

starting job in 1972 and didn't miss a

game for eight years. The award for the
best lineman in Division II football is
named for him. Little played two uninspired seasons in San Diego, then was
traded to the Dolphins in 1969 for a player who would be teaching high school
within five years, by which time Little
had already made his fourth Pro Bowl
blocking for the Dolphins' three-headed
running monster of Larry Csonka,
Mercury Morris and Jim Kiick.
Tackles: Lou Groza, Joe Jacoby
Runner-Up: Jason Peters
Peters might someday supplant
Jacoby for a starting spot; their career
lines already look fairly similar, and
Peters is only 28 and figures to make at
least a couple more Pro Bowls (he's made
the last three, and offensive lineman
tend to be common "reputation picks,"
even past their prime, as Alan Faneca
can attest). However, there's almost no
chance he'll overtake Groza, who may
have played the oddest combination of
positions in the history of the game:
kicker and offensive tackle. He played
for the Browns in the 50s and early 60s,
which not only meant that he opened
lanes for the consensus "Greatest
Running Back Ever" Jim Brown, but
also kicked the game-winning field goal
that won the 1950 championship for
Cleveland. Once again: he was a kicker
and an offensive lineman, and great at
both positions. If the "they don't make
them like they used to" cliche ever
applied, it's here. When is the last time

Gates is one of a few players on this

next to their "undrafted" status. He originally left Kent State with the intention
of playing in the NBA, was told he was
too tall to play guard and too short to
play forward, and finally arranged an

After Hopkins loss, Garnet defeats Washington
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY RENEE FLORES

rfloresl@swarthmore.edu
Despite a valiant first-half effort and battling
throughout the entire 90-minute game, the Swarthmore
women's soccer team suffered a disappointing loss to
the seventh-ranked Johns Hopkins Blue Jays in a
Centennial Conference matchup Saturday in
Baltimore. The loss was the first in Centennial play for
the team as the Garnet fell to 2-4-2 (1-1 CC).
Johns Hopkins scored first early in the game, but
the Garnet fought back to tie the score 1-1 in the 37th
minute. Hannah Deming 'l2 scored her second goal of
the season from the left side of the Hopkins box,
launching a shot high into the top corner. Elizabeth
Mills 'll earned her first assist of the season on the
Deming goal.
The Garnet played strong in the first half to match
Johns Hopkins and did not look over-matched against
its third Top-25 opponent in the regular season.
However, theBlue Jays pushed back in the second half,
dominating play and possession, and showing why
they were picked to win the Centennial Conference for

the sixth year in a row.
In the first half, goalkeeper Marie Mutryn 'l2
recorded three saves, followed by another two in the
second half. First-year goalie Kaitlyn Sipiora played
much of the second half and recorded four saves.
"It's frustrating, because I don't feel they're better
than us; we just ran out of steam. [Johns Hopkins] took
advantage of a momentary break in play," McCleary

Philbin 'l4 said. She added that the loss to Johns
Hopkins was no indication to the level of skill the
Garnet possesses. "What's done is done. [The loss]
doesn't change our season; we still have to worry about
other Conference games," she said.
Megan Brock 'l4 agreed. "We played great soccer for
65 minutes, then went down after that." The
Swarthmore women's soccer team knows dwelling on a
loss does no good in preparing for the remainder of the
Centennial Conference slate.
"We need to move on and get ready for Tuesday. If
anything, [the loss] makes us want to work harder,"
Philbin said.
"On another day, it could have been us [winning]
4-1," Brock added.
With a gruelling schedule and practices or games
six days a week, the determination to win rapidly
becomes a struggle against limitations. "Week by week
more people feel tired; we've been having that now. We
just need to work through it," Brock said.
The team returned to action on Tuesday, defeating
Washington College on the road by a score of 2-0. With
the victory, Swarthmore improved to 2-1 in Centennial
play.

The Garnet came out firing against the
Shorewomen, taking the lead just over 14 minutes into
the game. Megan Colombo 'll took a pass from Kirsten
Peterson 'll and beat Washington goalkeeper Tori
Ripple. For Colombo, it was her second goal of the sea-

son.
Peterson's assist was the fourteenth of her career,

tying her with EB Fortier '95 for the most assists in
Swarthmore women's soccer history.

Swarthmore launched nine shots in the first 45 min-

utes, four on goal. Sipiora played in goal for
Swarthmore, making two saves before halftime.
The second half was back and forth, with each team
having several scoring opportunities but failing to convert. In the 82nd minute, Aly Passanante 'l4 scored her
second collegiate goal on a feed from Emily Coleman
'l2 to secure the victory.
Sipiora finished with the shutout, making two second half saves in just her second career start.
Swarthmore dominated much of the play, outshooting Washington 18-6 and taking eight corner kicks to
Washington's none.
Colombo led the Garnet with eight shots in the game
while Amber Famiglietti 'l4 launched three from her
midfield position.
Due to Centennial Conference scheduling patterns,
Swarthmore has now played its first three conference
games on the road to begin the season. The team will
now return home to the friendly confines of Clothier
Field for its next three Conference games, vs.
McDaniel, Bryn Mawr and Muhlenberg.
The Garnet defeated McDaniel and Bryn Mawr on
the road last year and fell to Muhlenberg.
Swarthmore has also beaten McDaniel four straight
times and Bryn Mawr in 14 consecutive matchups, so
the team is in strong position to pick up critical
Centennial victories prior to the showdown with the

Mules.

Hannah's top five reasons for Swatties to watch hockey
5. Live vicariously through hockey:
Some weeks, life just doesn't go your
way. Your seminar professor has assigned
more readings than would be possible to
finish in a month let alone a week, your
group members won't get their act together for an upcoming presentation, and, on
top of everything, your mom is on your
case about not calling enough. But no matter how frustrated you get or how much
they might deserve it, it is just not OK to
check your professor or classmates into a
nearby wall. However, it might make you
feel better to watch someone else do it.
Release your frustration over life by living vicariously through every check, hit
and fight on the ice, all within the confines of a socially acceptable form of anger
management that won't get you kicked
out of school.
Who says counting to ten is the only
solution? Last week's preseason match up
between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the
Columbus Blue Jackets is proof that this
season will have just as much ice-stained
red as in the past. The game had five
fights and 72 penalty minutes, including a
bout between Evgeni Malkin and Rick
Nash. It might not have been the prettiest
fight, but two veteran players going at it
for a preseason scrimmage can only mean
good things for when games actually
count for something.

clilike
Southern California. For me, what makes
its design so great is a much more overlooked attribute: the perfect placement of
opposing teams' benches, too far to actually reach across and hit a guy, but close
enough to feature some serious screaming
matches. And if you think players don't
take advantage of this proximity to fit in
some extra trash talk, just look at video of
Ilya Kovalchuk and Sean Avery at last
week's exhibition game between the New
Jersey Devils and the New York Rangers.
Things got so heated between the two that
Kovalchuk had to explain after the game
that the hand gesture he made at Avery
was innocent and not a throat slash, a suspension-worthy offense. "I just told him to
zip it," Kovalchuk said. "I didn't tell him I
will kill him, so don't suspend me."
Ah yes, grown men in ice skates, inches from one another, exchanging profanities and obscure hand gestures. It must be
hockey season. With regular season
games only a week away, players and fans
alike can hardly wait to start down the
road to the next Stanley Cup. Yet
Swarthmore seems to have escaped this
preseason excitement. Students get hyped
for the start of football and college basketball, but hockey seems to go unnoticed by
most Swatties. Thus, in my never-ending
quest to prove hockey's merits to nonCanadians, here are five reasons why all
Swatties should tune into the NHL this
season.
mates

4. Boost your self-esteem by listening to

hockey interviews:
Just got a D on an orgo exam? The WA
laughed for ten minutes before he was
able to actually edit your paper? It happens. But

if you need a little self-esteem
boost about your intelligence, tune into a
post-game hockey interview. Sure, those
guys just spent 60 minutes doing godly
things on the ice that for most of us are
physically impossible, but their grasp of
noun-adjective agreement is a little more

tenuous.

Even if you forgive the grammatical
missteps, a must considering that for
many in the NHL English was not a first
language, put a hockey player unscripted
in front ofa microphone and you are guar-

anteed a few laughs.
Whether it is injury treatment suggestions (defenseman Borris Morinov's solution to a hurt ankle: "I just tape four
Tylenols to it"), recaps of important
moments in the game (Washington
Capitals' Donald Brashear on his gamewinning goal: "It just bounced there and I
went to the goal. It looked like a big piece
of cheese to me."), or stories from off the
ice (goalie Glenn Healy on travel in the
IHL: "One road trip we were stuck on the
runway for seven hours. The plane kept
driving and driving until we arrived at
the rink, and I realized we were on a
bus."), hockey quotes are bound to make
anything you wrote on that Spanish paper
seem more coherent.

2. Everybody else is doing it:
Although it might not be Sunday Night

Football, hockey has amassed a much
larger following in the US than you might
think. The Minnesota Wild had a streak
going of 409 consecutive sellout games,
every home game since the team became
part of the NHL in 2000. This kind of fan
loyalty has become so expected that the
fact that only 16,000 people came to a preseason scrimmage this year was newsworthy in the New York Times's hockey
blog. If all those Wild fans keep coming
back year after year, there must be something worth watching happening on the
ice.
1 Hockey has more drama than the Jersey
Shore:

3. Hockey players are people too:
As opposed to the over-inflated egos
and prima donnas that are so prevalent
in other professional sports, hockey players are for the most part normal people.
Sure, there are always those players who
are a bit over-the-top and, for example,
try to sign 17-year $lO2 million contracts,
but these are the exceptions and not the
rule.
Perhaps it is because hockey is just not
as popular in the US as football, or maybe
it is because teams are populated with an
unusually high number of Canadians.
Whatever the reason, hockey avoids a lot
of the superstar craziness of other sports
which makes you hesitate to open the
sports page around young children.
Evidence of this down-to-earth attitude
is not hard to find. Last season on one of
the San Jose Sharks' pregame shows, an
interviewer asked players when the last
time they called their mother was, and
they all answered yesterday.
On top of being nice to their mothers,
the ultimate evidence of hockey players'
human side is that not even they can
avoid the recent vampire craze. Patrick
Kane in an interview last month admitted
to having read the latest Twilight book
and enjoyed it. I can't even imagine how
much he heard about that the next day in
the locker room.

September 30, 2010

Forget reality TV; sports are where the
real drama is. A Puck Daddy blogger once
described the NHL as having "more plot
twists than a JJ Abrams story, except
NHL plot lines actually go somewhere."
And most of this drama happens off the
ice. Take this off-season for example. After
the Chicago Blackhawks knocked his
team out of the Conference Finals, Sharks
GM Doug Wilson did not hesitate to take
advantage of the Hawks' salary cap problems and get some much-needed revenge
for his team. Aware of how much the
Hawks wanted to resign Nicklas
Hjalmarsson this season, Wilson signed
Hjalmarsson to a $l4 million offer sheet
that forced the Hawks to match the salary
offer and pushed them further into money
problems. Then Wilson stole their
Stanley-Cup winning goaltender Antti
Niemi after the Hawks were no longer
able to afford him. Payback's a bitch!
Whoever you choose to root for (though
if it's not the Sharks, 1 don't want to hear
about it), hockey can be a great distraction from the day-to-day grind of
Swarthmore.
You never know. Innocently tune in for
a game and five years later you might fmd
yourself writing 500-word odes to how
great hockey is.

Volleyball bounces back with victory at Washington
BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

The 2010 Swarthmore Garnet
women's volleyball team entered
Centennial Conference play last
Wednesday with high expectations.
The team had started the year at
10-3, seen five different players earn
All-Tournament honors, and was eager
to live up to the hype surrounding its
third-place pick in the preseason
Centennial Conference poll.
But the Garnet volleyball team
struggled to open up conference play,
dropping straight sets on the road at
Johns Hopkins. The Blue Jays came
out agressively against Swarthmore,
taking the opening set 25-12. Though
the Garnet would rebound in the second, they fell 25-23. Johns Hopkins put
away the third set 25-19 to claim the
match.
Several players still had solid performances in the loss. Danielle
Sullivan 'l4 shined in the frontcourt,

recording eight kills on offense, while
Genny Pezzola 'l2 had seven. The two
combined for half of the Garnet's 30
kills. Allie Coleman 'l3 contributed 24
assists.
On defense, Lisa Shang 'l2 led the
team with 13 digs. Pezzola and Hillary
Santana 'l2 each contributed eight and
said
Harleigh
Chwastyk
Coach
Santana's performance was one of the
standouts of the day because it showed
she can play multiple positions well.
But the team feels it is much
stronger than it showed against
Hopkins. "As a team, we were really off
of our game that day. We lost control of
the game early," Coleman said.
Shang added, "We know we are a
much better team than how we played
against them."
Chwastyk was quick to put things in
perspective though, pointing out that
the Garnet lost to Hopkins last year
and still qualified for the Centennial
Conference playoffs. She added that the
match was just one loss, with plenty Of
*

time to make up for lost ground.
"We need to step up our game when
we face other teams like Hopkins that
will take a match from you if you let
them," Coleman added, while Shang
said that the team was fired up by
Wednesday's loss.
That fire and ability to step up
showed on Tuesday as Swarthmore
rebounded on the road at Washington
with a straight-set victory over the
Shorewomen. The Garnet came out on
top in two close sets before running
away in the third. Swarthmore took
the first set 2548 , the second 25-20, and
the third 25-8, closing off the match on
a 9-0 run.
The win broke the team's threegame losing streak and was the first
Centennial victory of the year for the
team. Swarthmore has now won six
against
consecutive
matches
Washington, all in straight sets.
Pezzola led the team with nine kills
on offense while Kat Montemurro 'l3
had seven and Coleman had six. Sarah

Lambert 'll, the Garnet's lone senior,
earned 20 assists.
Swarthmore compiled seven aces in
the match with two apiece from Shang,
Sullivan and Coleman. On defense,
Santana was all over the court for the
Garnet, compiling 15 digs to lead the
team. Coleman added ten ofher own as
Swarthmore held Washington College
to just a .02 hitting percentage.
"We really need to work on staying
mentally in the game no matter what
the score is or what the other team is
throwing at us, and we haveto work on
not letting the score dictate our energy
level," Coleman said.

Along each mile, the Garnet aims to
keep improving play. "As a team, we always
have things we can improve on. I still don't
believe we have played our best soccer yet,"
Pontillo said. "Defensively, we aim to
improve our concentration so that we have
no lapses in judgment or focus that could
give away opportunities. We are always
continuing to work on defensive shape and
positioning and to defend as a unit, not as

four defenders."

Swarthmore maintained its momentum
on Wednesday, traveling to Washington
College and defeating the Shoremen by a
score of 1-0. With the victory, the team is
now 9-0 on the season and off to its best
start since the 1966 team finished the year

The Garnet dominated play from start to

finish, outshooting the Shoremen 35-7. But

thanks to the stellar play of Washington's
junior keeper Chris Phipps, who had 13
saves,» Swarthmore struggled to score all
evening.
Phipps now has 34 saves in his last three
games, but in the 35th minute, Mieah Rose
'l2 gathered a Langley pass beyond the top

of the box and drilled a low line drive into
the right side of the net. The goal was
Rose's fourth and the season. The assist
was Langley's 10th of the year.
Langley also took eleven shots for the
Garnet, extending his season shot total to a
conference-leading 57. D'Annunzio made
three saves in the Swarthmore goal.
"With midterms and classes getting
tougher, we always seem to lose steam midseason," Langley said. "However, this year,

the guys have incredible focus. Everybody
has the same goals in mind. And that is to
win the conference championship and

bring home Swarthmore's first National
Championship in soccer. We really believe
we have the tools to win this year and that
is all the focus we need."
The catbird is not afraid of predators

and responds to challenges aggressively. So
far, the Garnet has gone into nine battles
and come away on top all nine times. But
with conference and national championship aspirations, Langley and his teammates know that they want to be in their
highest perch when it counts.
"Although it is a goal we keep in mind
all season, we want to be in the catbird seat
come late October."
