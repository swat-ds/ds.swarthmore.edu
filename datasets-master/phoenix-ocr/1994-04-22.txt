Barr and Wartenburg Conclude Successful Admissions Year
No More Begging and Pleading: Accepted Students Now in Control as They Peruse Their Undergraduate Options
By Erik Huneke
Welcomed by the barbecue in
the Amphitheater and showing of
the movie How I Got Into College
on Sunday evening, a number of
prospective members ofthe class of
1998 have attended classes and
roamed through theAdmissions Office this past week. In getting a good
glimpse oflife at Swarthmore, they
gatherfinal impressions before they
decide whether or not to matriculate.
The class of '9B is projected to
have 340 students, which is a "relatively normal class," according to
Robert Barr, Dean of Admissions.
It is, however, significantly smaller
than the class of '97, in which 413
students decided to accept offers of
admission. In order to yield the desired class size, 200 fewer applicants were granted admission from
a pool of applicants 200 greater than
last year.
This set of circumstances had
two effects. Barr believes that there
were "unexpected and disappointing results" for a number of applicants who, based on past results,
thought they would have a good
chance of being admitted to the
College. From another standpoint,
this pool was the second largest
ever, which comes as a relief to Banafter a few years of slight decline in
the number of total applicants.
The acceptance of this class
marked the culmination of a year in
which Barr asserts that the AdmissionsOffice was "able toreach more

schools, and do more systematic
thinking about the admissions process [than ever before]." This was
facilitated by Barr's cooperation
with Admissions Director Carl
Wartenburg, who will become Dean
of Admissions in the fall. Barr re-

a dimension to the process that was
fun."
Fun is also integral to prospective students' experiences as they
become better acquainted with the
College and with their potential
classmates. According to Barr, "a

values and instincts I respect very
much" were welcomed and "added

lot of students came to the [welcom-

ing] program [questioning] whether
they are going to be academically
competitive at Swarthmore," since

many come aware ofSwarthmore's
rigorous academic reputation.
Through attending classes and
speaking with current students,
many became more comfortable
with the pace and demands of
Swarthmore's academic load.

Photos By Emily Mindel
Other questions frequently
asked by prospective students at
this stage included Swarthmore students' placement record in accep-

tanceto graduate schools, individual
departments' policies with respect
to AP credit, and the specific nature
of someofSwarthmore's varied academic offerings (the first semester CR/NC policy, the Honors Pro-

gram, concentrations, etc.).

Also ofnote, when asked about
the incoming students' academic inclinations, Barr pointed out that a
slightly greater proportion of this
year's prospective students have expressed interest in majoring in some
area of the natural sciences than has
been observed in classes matriculating as little as five years ago.This
finding comes on the heels of recent
discussions questioning whether students at Swarthmore are now focusing more on professional goals than
on liberal arts studies.
As he looks to the prospect of
one semester of leave, Barr plans to
return next spring to work in the
Development Office on fund raising and strengthening long-term relationships with Swarthmore's
alumni. "As much as I love what
I've done," Barr remarked, "I am
now ready for a change in responsibilities."
When asked about the status of
the admissions program as he departs, Barr responded that "we've
got

be able to sustain a reputation that
will keep our pool of students intact." This year's large pool of applicants indicates that Barr leaves a
strong program behind as he prepares for other endeavors.

Blocks Explained in Full
lengthy discussion,
the Housing Committee has decided
to eliminate all block housing assignments for the upcoming 19941995academic year. Werealize this
change will adversely affect a certain number of students and we
apologize for any inconvenience and
strife this may cause any student.
However, we felt that eliminating all
blocks andfollowing thenormalroom
choosing procedure for all students
who wish to live on campus next
year was the fairest and most efficient of all possible solutions. Normal room choosing consists of picking rooms based upon the randomly
generated lottery numbers which
have already been distributed.
In its deliberations, the Housing Committee agreed that the issue
of seniority was paramount in the
room-choosing process. Therefore
we felt compelled to make a change
because the principle of seniority
which underlies this process, was
violated. More specifically, the lottery at Swarthmore College is structured according to class hierarchy
as is reflected in the way the lottery
numbers are generated. Seniors who
traditionally live in the best singles
and two-room doubles were being
displaced either by rising sophomores or rising juniors who obtained
those rooms through block housing.
In addition, the structure of
block housing this year created a
scenario in which second-choice
housing for seniors was given to
juniors and sophomores who made
thoserooms their first choices. Considering the block-housing application only allows three choices, the
goal of room choosing based on
seniority was overridden because
senior requests overlapped. While
there are approximately 400 students who were just ousted from
their rooms because ofour decision,
we feel that giving each individual
an equal chance to choose a room on
the basis of their number is the fairest solution at this point in time.
The Housing Committee also
considered the issues of efficiency
and simplicity in its decisions. In
coming to our decision, we kept in
mind the limited time in which to
communicate informationto the students, as well as the time constraints
for both the student body at large
and the students serving on theHousing Committee. The room-choosing process itself must involve time
to allow students to communicate
with each other and to come to difficult decisions before going to the
actual room draw. Therefore simplicity and efficiency dictated that
the Housing Committee make a decision whose terms are clear and
whose procedures are expedient.
Although we feel comfortable
withthe final decision, we believe it

is important
various options that were considered as well the concerns raised
regarding each possibility. These
ideas demonstrate the spectrum of
opinions that were represented at
the meeting, as well as the scope
with which they were considered.
Eliminate sophomores from
blocks with singles and two-room
doubles:
As noted above, in the current
situation seniors would have been
displacedby sophomores AND juniors. Therefore, aremedy which only
addressed sophomores taking rooms
traditionally occupiedby seniors and
juniors was insufficient. In addition, had the sophomores who picked
thoserooms known that they would
have tovacate them, they would not
have made such choices in the first
place and could have blocked for
other rooms. It would have also
been difficult to dissolve block assignments on an individual and
room-by-room basis. Also, the
Housing Committee is aware that
the room-choosing process is especially stressful for sophomores.
Therefore, it seemed unjust to penalize only sophomores.
•Eliminate allblocks EXCEPT
all-senior blocks:
Becauseof the inability todetermine a fair system for dealing with
blocks involving seniors as well as
members of other classes, this option
was considered inadequate.
•Re-offer all block housing:
This option would involve beginning the entire room choosing
process again and it would be necessary to abide by the preceding
year's blocks and accompanying
regulations. It would be necessary
to generate new numbers for all
students since block-housing preto

as well as the approach of exams,
we believed that the housing process
should end as soon as possible.
The Housing Committee sincerely apologizes for the unforeseen
consequences of increasing the number ofblocks without retaining class
restrictions. This change was made
in response to student requests for
increased block housing, to reduce
stress, and to offer students more
than one opportunity to select a
room. The revocation ofblockhousing is only in effect for this year.
The entire process will be carefully
revised by the Housing Committee
next year.. The Committee decided
not to consult the student body at

Costly April Fool's Mess
On May 31, a group of students decided to play a few April
Fool's pranks. A few days later, the student council co-coordinators received a bill for the pranks totaling $2885.51. This money
was used to pay the wages of those people who were forced to
clean up after certain students. Because staff was not responsible
for the time wasted in cleaning up, SC decided to pay for the time.
However, we decided that students needed to be aware that
their Student Activities Fund money was being used to pay the
overtime wages of workers. This money could have paid for two
or three more club activities. It could have covered the cost of a
good band at the Old Club or even paid for a speaker. Instead, this
money was wasted on cleaning up after a few students.
We are not asking students to stop playing pranks, we are only
asking that they clean up after themselves. Otherwise, we will
waste at least $3OOO again every year. This money could be better
spent on activities that are more fun or more educational for the
entire campus rather than a few people.
So, if you know people who were involved in the April Fool's
Day pranks, ask them to take responsibility for their actions,
perhaps by contributing some money to the Student Activities
Fund, or perhaps by spending some of their own time cleaning up
around campus. Thanks.

Issue of Fairness in Housing
Complicated by "pulling"
To the Editor
We all know that blocking and roomchoosing this year were handled with something less than great finesse. In fact, many
students have complained about the process
in The Phoenix, over Newswatcher, and on
paper posters around campus. There is one
area of the process, however, that no student
has really put up for public discussion. Perhaps that is because so few students even
knew what happened behind the scenes.
This year, RA's were each allowed to
"pull" one person ontjp their hall before room
choosing began. Although I- think allowing
each RA to "pull" a friend onto his/her hall
makes sense, the method used this year had
several problems.
I should mention a couple of the specifics of this policy, so the rest ofmy complaint
makes more sense. 1) This "pull" occurred
after numbers had been generated and distributed; 2) This "pull" could be done into
ANY room on the RA's halft 3) This "pull"
could be done, by the RA, to a member of
ANY class s/he saw fit.
The goal, which makes sense to me, was
to make sure that RA's wouldhave at least one
friend on the hall. The result, however, was that
eighteen of Wharton's best singles were gone
before room-choosing began, fourteen outside
singles in Dana/Hallowell were gone before
room-choosing began, etc. I have three ideas
for how the above goal could have been accomplished more fairly for everyone.
Idea A: IfHousing Committee is going
to continue to allow a "pull," it should be
completed beforenumber generation. What I
saw happen this year was not RA's just
asking friends to move-in, they were asking
friends who just so happened to have the
*

worst numbers. If the idea is to maintain
friendships, I am hard pressed to see how
numbers should play a factor. When an RA

selects a room, he or she could simultaneously select the rooms for theirfriend. Waiting until after the numbers have been released

allows RA's

to

pass over their friends with

good numbers and simply "pull-up" friends

with numbers in the last third of the class.
Idea B: Assuming again that "pullingup" is positive since it helps RAs' lives, why

does the friend "pulled-up" need to get the
second best single on the hall? In my mind, if
this is about friendship, the person being
"pulled-up" ought to get if not the worst
single on the hall, at least a more mediocre
one. As an idea for next year, perhaps Housing Committee could mark-off the top 33%
of the rooms on a given hall, into which no
one could be "pulled."
Idea C: Finally, Housing Committee
should make a listof the singles on campus and
decide which are considered Senior singles,
which are considered Juniorsingles, etc.. Then,
at the very least, no one should be "pulled" up
out of their class into a room they could never
have hoped to get at room-choosing.
This year, an RA in Wharton selected a
rising Junior to be "pulled" onto the hall.
Next year, that Junior will live in a single
which isamong thebest six rooms on campus
(based on the preceding year's room draw,
and a good deal of popular opinion). If that
Junior is going to be "pulled" onto the hall, it
would seem far more equitable to me to place
him in the closest thing to a Junior single
available, not in one of the best senior singles.
I ask you to consider a second example:
Each Dana/Hallowell RA took an outside
single (which seems fair), but each one also
"pulled" a friend into a second outside single.
Since at least some of the RA's are Juniors,
this means the people they pulled (also Juniors) are living in rooms which are traditionally considered Senior housing. In fact, all of
the outside singles in Dana/Hallowell were
gone as of # 198 in theSenior Class, and some
Seniors therefore picked into inside singles.
Can this be fair? Hardly.
In short, Housing Committee already has
a lot to do next year when thinking about how
to re-do the process. I hope they reconsider
how "pulling" is handled, if it will be at all.
And for all of thoseFrosh out there who
thought that people in my class ('95) only
cared about ourselves, here is one example
(and there are many more) of people in the
Class of '95 trying to make sure that things
work OK for you too. I have no stake in the
"pulling" procedure being changed, but I still
think it ought to be.

Writer Corrects $50,000
Estimate For April Fool's
To the Editor

Many people talked to me last week who
had taken my recent opinion piece to heart I
guess it may have been due to the figures I
gave regarding the financial repercussions.
Let me clear things up. To many who read
the Phoenix from two weeks ago, the $50,000
estimate for April Fool's day damages is
apparently a large, yet believable number. I
extrapolated this figure after hearing a
$20,000 estimate but I was quoting no one.
Also, the $20,000 estimate was unofficial
and released only 4 hours into the second day
of April.
In the 20 hours after I wrote my first
piece for the Phoenix, many of the things that
had been done were undone by the same
people. A more recent (and really much
more believable) estimate put the cost for
April Fool's day at just under $3OOO. I'm not
sure if this figure includes a rumored $6OO

spent on extra Fool's Day labor costs for
Physical Plant, Environmental Services, and
Scott Arboretum persons.
Money is not the most important injury in
the April Fools case; the estimates and figures I cited were meant to draw attention to
the issues that were important: 1) the pranks
were unnecessarily dangerous, in some cases.
2) the pranks that may not have caused serious damage certainly risked it. 3) these
pranks were ones thatcaused the most trouble
for hard-working employees of the college
and arboretum. 4) The pranks that fell into
the first three categories were generally not

The Cult of Overachievement
By John Freeman '96
There exists a culture of overachievement
in our country; I've seen traces of it on our
campus in attempts to reschedule classes,
applications to fellowships, and the attitudes
of perspective students who describe themselves as if they were reading the specs of a
new sports car (1500 SAT, 0-100 pgs. in lhr,
etc.)- The arenas where we shall spend a
majority of our waking moments, schools
and the work-force, reinforce the idea that to
be virtuous one most be invested in an impressive portfolio of activities. We learn to
jump from one activity to another across 1820 hourdays as ifsketching aconnect-the-dot
portrait of ourselves; in attempt to meet commitments we are stretched so paper thin that
we become alienatedfrom ourselves. Activities begin to run together like scenery on a
long bus-ride, losing their intrinsic meaning
because we do not have time to reflect on
them. Ifwe dodefine our lives by whatwedo,
than shouldn't we find an equal amount of
time to question these activities?
This triumphing of overachievement
shows a fear of questioning and an obsession
with control. From Bejing to Boise we are
told by billboads to JUST DO IT as if Big
Brother is watching over us, telling us to do
and not to think. At Swarthmore, where so
much timeis spent reading, working labs, etc.
one can feel torn between a Nike Athletics
discipline approach to class-work and an
intrinsic desire to reflect upon the meaning of
events. While our investment in 17 different
activities may give us the feeling of some sort
of control over the world outside ourselves,
in reality we are like laundry blowing in the
wind, tied to the line by our various commitments, blowing about in breezes we never
could have anticipated.

What gets lost in this struggle to
balance our crazy lives is the most important resource on campus: each other. We
criss-cross paths through Parrish or the
condiment bar in Sharpies and lament the
awkwardness of wanting more substantial
contact without the ability to get out of
habitual patterns. We schedule and reschedule meal dates around the rising tide
of papers, labs, and quizzes as if we are
slaves to academic work, sometimes unable to talk about anything but our incredible amounts of work.
It saddens me to see friendships consumed by the evil over-achievement bug
that has infected so many college admissions processes, job position search committees, and even the stone walls of Parrish
Hall. I don't want to race through college
in a hazy Sanka dream—I probably will
forget the meaning of stagflation and what
a pulsar is, but I will never forget the
distinct laugh of a friend, or an evening
spent lounging in the white lawn chairs on
Parrish lawn.
I value the work-ethic that has come
to define a large part of our campus personality; it makes Swarthmore unique and
lends a seriousness and dedication to just
being here. But on campus and beyond,
we need to identify and be aware of the
voices and forces that are telling us to
push on and expand when we have not the
reserves to realize benefit from new commitments. We ought to realize that
people—our friends,relatives, mentors,
and strangers two doors down in the
dorm—make life memorable, exciting, and
real. Ifwe buy into the cult ofover-achievement we ignore this resource and ultimately deprive ourselves oflife's most accessible beauty.

As an outgoing senior(andwith only onemore Phoenix to go), Ifeel that itis appropriate
to speak out one last time to condemn certain negative and hurtful aspects of our institution.

This is my last serious Phoenix article, one last hurrah, in the honor of several of my friends
who have told me to "get bitter again."
There are many things that must change at this institution. I worry that this school has
forgotten to make thekind of commitments to thestudents that are necessary for it to survive the
twenty-first century, when we, the students, are the one's who will be expected to pay the bills as
alumni.
For one, I feel that Swarthmore perpetrates a great injustice against students on

I am outraged, and have been for several years, that this school leaves the future education of
a considerable number of students in doubt. What concerns me even greater than the act is
themessageit sends. This school mustguarantee that thestudents whofight sohardtobehere,
stay here. It is a matter of commitment. These students are committed to being member's of
our community, and they must be treated with self-same respect. Not guaranteeing them a
four-year package is a rude abuse of the school's financial privilege. It reveals a lack of
commitment to thestudents that may hurt this school in the long-run. Who do you expect to
keep this school afloat whenit is you, Swarthmore College, who needs financial aid? And why
should students make a commitment to you in the future, if you are not willing to commit to
them now?
I have come to accept that this school is a business, not solely the haven

Mostelders at this institutionfed thatit is not the responsibility of theschool to guarantee the

basic necessities to keep those minds working. But, if this school becomes a rat trap, that suffocates

The movies in McCabe shouldn't all be intellectual brain-fries. The student center
shouldn't consist of two aging pool tables (Swarthmore once had eight tables in Old Tarble),
a few lousyvideo games, and a television set that is walking thedirtroadbeside the information
super-highway. There should be permanent outdoor athletic facilities for playing basketball
(the one lousy hoop that we presently haveis an abomination) and volleyball. We shouldhave
weekly study-breaks sponsored by different departments. We should have community-wide
barbecues that unite the entire campus. Provide students with full, balanced lives, and you
will have happy students. I argue that it is the school's responsibility to create thesekinds of
outlets, before it can make theargument thatstudents are responsible for their own happiness.

Clinton Needs to Back Human Rights Rhetoric
By Chuck Stevens
In his never-ending quest for a foreign
policy accomplishment, Bill Clinton is now
looking toward China and tackling the human-rights issue. After Secretary of State
Warren Christopher's disastrous trip to
Bejing, during which officials cracked down
on dissidents, Clinton once again has the
opportunity to take away China's most-favored-nation trade status. The administration
will no doubt conclude that the costs of a
hard-line policy outweigh the benefits and
will probably shy away from action. Yet
China presents an opportunity to act on principle and show that western rhetoric on the
issue actually amounts to something; Clinton
should strongly consider what, in the light of
recent history, lifting MFN status might do.
George Bush claimed during the 1992
campaign to have achieved a settlement with
China that would bring about reform and end
human rights abuses. In fact, the accords that
Chinese officials signed merely agreed to
call their work camps "prison labor" and to
eschew any mention of slave labor. To oversee the supposedly stringent surveying of
labor conditions, the U.N. placed a grand
total of one customs official in Bejing, who
will, the worldis confident, make great strides
toward ending human-rights abuses throughout China. In short, theBush administration,
anxious to keep the benefits of a booming
trade with China, both in imports and exports, overlooked that nagging human-rights
thing and claimed that all was swell.

Clinton, withhis lofty campaign rhetoric

of defending human rights throughout the
world and getting tough with Bejing, cannot,
or should not, escape so easily. Before the
campagin, Clinton advocated complete trade
isolationof China should democraticreforms
fail; during the campaign he took a slightly
more lenient stance, proposing only that
Bejing's favorable-trade status be takenaway.
Since his election, Clinton has been under
heavy lobbying from business and agricultural groups and has backed off the issue.
Though the current policy makes some requirements of the Chinese government, e.g.
accounting for the whereabouts of all prisoners, it stops well short of actually enforcing
majorreform, such as theclosing of the prison
camps, and fails to link future renewals of
China's trade status with any particular set of
changes.

Simply put, U.S. policies have influence
in China. Congress began threatening to lift
MFN status in 1990, and since then there has
been some progress in humanrights—at least,
efforts at appeasement. Economic reform
within China has brought little progress —it
certainly didn't prevent Tianenmen Square—and leaves too much room for doubt.
Naysayers point out that Bejing would have
no more incentive for reform should MFN
status be lifted, but this notion misses the
point: Clinton could tie renewal to specific
progress, specific changes in the system, not
just announce one day that the policy had
been changed. If there was a good reason for
China to change its ways...

There would be costs if China's mostfavored-nation status was revoked. Imports
from China would drop dramatically, as
U.S. customs would impose steep tariffs;
judging from Bejing's threats, retaliatory
tariffs might well follow, and exports to
China would drop as well. It might well be
argued, however, that the U.S. and China
are not on equal footinghere, thatthe U.S. is
in a position to dictate its trade terms to
China and not vice versa. If U.N. compatriots get into the act, and consistently deny
China favorable-trade status, reforms may
follow rapidly; China needs to be hit in the
wallet, where it counts, before it will take
seriously the West's strictures about human-rights violations.
Other requirements of Clinton's
policy as it stands include a limit on
China's exports of missile and nuclear
technology, and a lowering of tariffs, to
each of which China has already acquiesced; clearly the Bejing government is
anxious to keep itself in good graces with
the U.S. A hard line from Washington
might force China to change; certainly, it
seems that Clinton has already compromised enough. With a clear opportunity
to force reform on China's part, with a
clear position ofpower—especially with
our trade deficit as steep as it is, China
needs us more than we need it—and with
Clinton criticized as too willing to reform, the time is right to force concessions, and to stand by the lofty principles
set down in his campaign.

Grounds Crew Makes Every Day an Earth Day
By Kate Ehrenfeld
Swarthmore greets Earth Day with a
blaze of color from flowering shrubs and
trees, a blanket of brilliant green, and a songbird chorus. The beauty of the campus in the
springtime increases the poignancy of Earth
Day, for it helps toremind us of the things that
an impoverished environment will lack.
Swarthmore's vivid yellows and oranges
act as a wake-up call to those people that are
jaded, encouraging them to refresh old resolutions to live and work in ways healthy for
theplanet. The Grounds Crew, however, who
have planted and nourished the hundreds of
plant species here with a fraction of the pesticides used by most other institutions, need no
reminders; for them, every day on the job is
Earth Day.
JeffJabco, Director of Grounds, has been
leading the effort to reduce pesticide use at
Swarthmore ever sincehearrived here 4 years
ago. A position in which, as he says, he is
responsible for "everything outside," (from
sidewalks to athletic fields to the woods) this
added project is no small order. Jabco, however, has devoted great energy to it, and has
almost entirely converted our campus into
one cared for with Integrated Pest Management, IPM.
IPM is a method of eliminating agricultural pests with as little pesticide as possible.
This reduction is achieved through several
different strategies. Thefirst is strengthening
plants, making them more resistant to disease

and parasites, through wise location, proper
pruning and fertilization. One of the ways
Jabco has pursued this is with the creation of
an arboriculture crew. This group (the guys
you've seen in trees with climbing rope)
strengthens trees against pests by increasing
the quality of tree care and pruning.

don't seem unacceptable. "I'm a firm believer
that you don't have to control everything
that's out there," says Jabco expressing a
philosophy that, in professional horticulture,
is relatively new.
The successes of Jabco's IPM program
at Swarthmore are numerous. "We are one of

among other horticultural businesses in the
region. It has over 20 cooperators doing research, including botanical gardens, schools,
arbot? and nurseries. Several hundred subscribers benefit from the information collected and published by IPM.
An IPM conference held here every i wo
years has been part of Jabco's program to
influence otherinstitutions to adopt this environmentally healthy w ay ofdealing with pests.
There are some areas of the campus that
have posed a challenge to IPM; the playing
fields, which are prone to fungus, are a site of
constant struggle for S warthmore's pest managers. For the most part, this struggle is fought
by planting four disease-resistant types of
grass, and education students and members
of IBM about proper care for playing fields.
When chemicals must be used, the 1 ist
harmful ones are choosen, and the staff takes
great precautions with them, wearing protective clothing even to handle mild solutions.
Jabco notes that people tend to assume the
worst when they see a chemical being sprayed;
"Every time you see someone in a white suit,"
he says, "it doesn't mean they're spraying
something terrible."
Although Earth Day is a good time for
contemplating what's left to be done to help
the environment, it's also a good time to give
thanks for what's happening. And, as the
brilliant blossoms over thecampus attest, the
college owes much thanks to Jeff Jabco and
the Grounds Crew, for keeping the earth in
mind 365 days a year.

The grounds crew at Swarthmore has planted and
nourished hundreds of plant species with a fraction of
the pesticides used by most other institutions.
Furthermore, Jabco has selected plants
that are well adapted to this region, rather
than foreign ornamentals thatrequire poisons
to defend them against American parasites.
As Jabco explained, "One of the goals of the
arboretum is to grow things that work best in
Southeastern PA. If it's something that gets
every pest and disease that comes down the
Pike, that's probably a species we don't want
to be growing."
IPM carefully monitors the life cycles of
both plants and pests. They also use of predatory insects, parasites, diseases, soaps and
oils in the war on pests. Lady bugs, ground
beetles, stink bugs and spiders are only a few
in a long list of Jabco's nonhuman allies.
Lasdy, IPM is more philosophical than practical; it involves changing notions of beauty,
so that a few spots or teeth marks on leaves

the leaders in the United States at doing IPM
on this scale," he says, explaining that most
IPM has been practiced by farmers on large
plots with small numbers of species; here we
have hundreds of varieties of plants, each
with its own pests.
One ofJabco's most important successes
was the founding of the Southeast Pennsylvania IPM Research Group. This group was
created by Jabco in association with several
other horticulturists to gather information
about controlling pests without chemicals.
"No one gives the money to universities to do
this kind of research, so we decidedto do it on
our own," he explains.
The work done by the research group
includes conducting fieldresearch to evaluate
IPM practices, performing IPM education,
and encouraging thereduced use ofpesticides

Itching, Fig Newtons, Card Games, and Other Pastimes
April 22,1994

By Ethan Borg
Dating is a difficult thing. I 'm sure you' ve
heard many a sob story —and maybe you have
actually sobbed—thoughI myself am not apt
to get so emotional over carbon-testing, or
eating Fig-Newtons. The kind of dating that
involves two fleshy creatures who like to suck
off dead skin cellsand slurp in secreted beverages is another matter. Just describing dating in these terms makes me tear. We are
vertical slabs of flesh that are somehow attracted to other vertical slabs, and this intrinsically creates confusion, never mind that
some of these flesh slabs play cribbage.
Cribbage is a problem with dating. It can
sometimeslead to the need of cribbage. Practice safe sex: it's the law. I am of the opinion
that cribbage is to be avoided until after the
two flesh slabs have decided to buy a condo in
the Ozarks, and learn to make things burp. If
one is set on cribbage, one should stay away
from Gin and Rummy, War and Spit. Of
course, you'll have to Poker.
There is a stage in dating that is above all
most important. It is a scary stage —fraught
with potential traumas. If one passes through
unscathed, the two vertical flesh slabs will be

more comfortable witheach other; if one does
there is the possibility of spontaneous
vertical slab combustion, destroying the inter-sucking mechanism that so successfully
removed dead skin cells. This stage is called:
If it itches, do I scratch it?
not

Now let us discuss crabs. I have never
seen a crab itch. Perhaps their strong exoskeleton is itch-proof. Perhaps their pincers cannot reach. Yet crabs make people itch. Haven't
you ever been on a beach with one walking
over your toes? Itchy. Does one scratch?

reinforces the whole concept of dating. Also,
if you have any musical ability, play showtunes. It works every time. If you have just
experienced a bad accident, showyour stitches,
for the word itches can be heard, and your
slab-partner will subconsciously become comfortable with its pronunciation.
Perhaps you can bring finches into your
conversation, such as in: "Look at those beautiful finches," since the word finches and
itches off-rhyme. Off-rhymes are good—this
goes without saying.

Let us not be too frightened, too meek,
too humiliated to discuss this stage ofunmentionable importance. Let us not act as if it is
not a real stage at all. It is, and you know it.

Will this sucking vertical slab of flesh get
repulsed by an itch that must be scratched? Or
can you go straight towards cribbage?
For those precocious slabs who reach
this stage quickly, more power to you. But
remember, scratching andGin Rummy donot

One must keep in consideration the psychological health of one's slab-mate. If he or
she convulses violently at the wordfinch or its
plural finches, try to avoid using that particular off-rhyme, even though, off-rhymes, by
their very nature are good.
If you feel thatyou have not yet successfully transcended this awesome stage, then
there are several good itching-yet-not-itching
techniques. For one, scientists have proven
decisively that lambada is one of the best
remedies for itching, especially hard to reach
places.
For another, imitating a Michael Jackson
videocanallow oneself the freedom to scratch.
Singing "We Are the World" is also a potent
itching-anti-itching mechanism, for those who
listen will feel compelled to close their eyes
and sway, providing ample time to dispose of
the itches. And, finally, one can always revive
breakdancing.
However, please note: if you are in a
relationship, whether or not you plan on continuing to cribbage, whether or not you Gin,
Rummy, Spit, War, or Poker, you will eventually have to face this ruthless stage. Once

Play Bridge Complaining Can be Good for the Soul,
But Don't Ask for Your Money Back...
By Sam Ehrlichman

By Katie Menzer

West leads the #.Q. While you are
deciding how to pi ay the contract, what do
you think ofthe bidding? South' s 1 S opener
is correct—the hand is not good enough to
open 2NT (which would show 20-21HCP)
or a strong-two (which would show even
more). Norths 3S bid is not forcing; her
spade support is excellent, but her heart
and diamondholdings are terrible.To force
game in spades, North would bid 2NT.
South's jumpto6S isn't very scientific, but
will work more often than not.
What are Souths chances in this contract? If you think that success rides on
finding the heart king with East, look more
closely. Assuming that trumps donot break
4-0, South can play as follows: win the
opening lead in hand, pull trump, cash
another high diamon in hand and lead a
small club todummy's king. Next comes a
diamond from dummy, trumping in hand,
followed by a club to the king. The situation for declarer is now like this:

The nine of hearts is then lead from
dummy and South covers East card as
cheaply as possible. If West wins the trick,
he wilt either have lo present declarer with
a heart trick by leading anotherheart or he
will have 10 lead a minor suh card, allowing declarer to pitch a heart loser from one
handand ruff in the other. If West does not
win this trick, declarer has 12 tricks.
This type of play is called a throw in.
Notice the importance of the 7 of hearts in
dummy. If you switch the7and6ofhearts,
East can beat the contract by covering
dummy's heart, forcing declarer to play
the queenfrom her hand Then, when West
wins thekindof hearts, he can play another
heart, establishing a second trick in the suit
for East, possibly the seven.

I'm sick. I'm very sick. I've been sick
for two weeks straight now. My entire existence is consumed by sleeping, blowing my
nose, and making strange inarticulatenoises
from my throat that even I can't identify. I
have enough phlegm to drown a small rat. I
can no longer sit with myfriends at dinnerfor
fear that one of them might make me laugh,
forcing me to spew half-chewed Italian
cheese-like balls all over the burly guys at the
Phi-Psi table in Sharpies (and let me tell you,
that does wonders for the old social life) and
sending me into an uncontrollablefit of coughing that can only be terminated with respirator or a.38 caliber pistol. I've even developed
a penchant for wearing all black and carrying
a lighted flashlight around like a sword. I am
very sick.
So at this-point you might say, "Well,
Katie, love of my life, meaning of my existence, supremeruler of the universe, I 'm sorry
you are so ill, but complaining will really get
you nowhere. Take some Dimetapp and suck
it up."
At which point I might say something
like "pppphhhhtttt!" (NOTE TO THE
READER: This is the sound made by some-

one with a very congested nose attempting to
stick her tongue out at you and spit in your
general direction).

Or, if you catch me on a particularly
energetic day, I might say nothing and merely
bludgeon you to death with my flashlight.
Or, even more likely, I might even embark upon the discourse of which 1 am about
to embark upon today, which is aptly entitled
"I'm Not Okay. You'reNot Okay. Let's Make
Sure We Both Know It."
I don't know how it happened. 1 don't
know when it happened. 1 certainly was not
consulted. But sometime between the time
when that first little amino acid hankered up
to that second amino acid and formed a protein in the frothy primordial soup and the
cancellation of MacGyver (a day that will
forever be emblazoned in my mind as the
precise moment that marked the demise of
our society), some silly person decided that
complaining was a negative thing. I often like
to think what this so cruelly fated individual
must have been like. If he had nothing to
complain about, he must have been male and
he must have lived in some idyllic Southern
state.. .like Texas (Katie, the feminist Texan,
had to come out sometime guys). He was
probably always safe and warm. He probably

never wanted for food or shelter. He was
probably cherished by his peoples. He probably got accepted to all the colleges to which
he applied, including Williams (Man, I'm so
bitter). Naturally, why should he complain?
But similarly, why should he ruin the
complaining for the rest of us? Some of us
face dangers and endurebitter cold every day.
Some of us are hungry and homeless. Some of
us are simply rejected by society for no reason. Some of us did not get into Williams. Do
we have the right to complain?
Sure we do! There is nothing inherently
negative about complaining. I rather enjoy it
myself. If we Swatties didn't whine, we'd
probably never even bother to speak to each
other, really. I certainly would never have
anything to write about in this column. No
articles on housing, or specs, or 18-day visiting dorm guests. My God, I'd be mute!!!
So the next time one of those utterly
annoying and optimistic people tell you that
you are a little too embroiled in your own
misfortunes, explain to them that complaining is a quite valid means of unconventional
communication that is integral to the development of relationships between individuals
mired in their own self-pity. And if that doesn't
work, just beat them with your flashlight.

With Spring Comes a Small Guide to Love
By Dave Sobel
Birds. It all starts with birds. The way
they dirty your car's windshield and your
front lawn. Well maybe that's good. Fertilizer
and all. But there is always some guy that
winds up having to clean off his jacket, and
cleaning bills are expensive. So is cleaning
out your swimming pool, but that is irrelevant. Cleaning bills. I knew a guy who did
his laundry every week by calling up the local
cleaner. This guy would come every Tuesday
morning to pick up the clothes and every
Wednesday afternoon with them pressed
neatly, folded, hung on little hangers. Even
the socks. Laundromats must collect those
little hangers people throw away when they
buy a new pair of socks.
A woman runs the company that manufactures the hangers that people hang little
socks on. This, in itself, is not a controversial
statement. I mean it only as a statement of
fact, however. One day, she is having lunch.
It is tuna-fish on rye bread, the kind without
the seeds.
Most breads don't contain seeds. There
are some that do, but you can only get them in
bakeries. Bakeries aren't the only places to
get seeded bread, I'm sure there are farms that
have bread with seeds in them. But, I'm not
sure if you would go up to the farmerand ask
him to buy his seeded bread. Is it really worth
it to drive to a farm for some seeded bread?
Now, if you were a bird thenperhaps it would
be OK to fly out there (to the farm, not the

Jimmy Hoffa's wallet is also probably
made of fancy leather. Most brides do not
wear leather at their ceremony except maybe
their shoes. You could tum Jimmy Hoffa's
wallet into a pair of shoes, but I don't think it
would be big enough.
Some might ask, why is the woman that
runs the company and the man with stuff on
his shoulder getting married. Skeptics. Its like

Hi. These are some new releases that
have enthralled me over the last few weeks.
All of them should be available through decent (i.e. non-Sam Goody) music stores or
mail-order.
Flap: Pal CD (Half-Baked Records)

cheesecake, layered with Mr. Lee's intricate
guitar and vocals.
The songs are even better. "Infidel",
which features Liz Phair on vocals, is one of
the most beautiful things I've heard in a long
time: an acoustic, rich mixture of upright
bass, multilayered guitar, and two distinctive
voices. The other songs are great as well,
though in a more rockish sort of way. Randall
Lee's voice is deep, as are his lyrics (though

These are some new releases that
have enthralled me over the last few
weeks or so. All of them should be
available through decent (i.e. nonSam Goody) music stores or mailorder.

and strangely structured stuff. This disc made
me reconsider my definition of the word
"booty-shaking"; a few guys without any
bass and only occasional electric guitars made
me want to get up and dance around the room
(which I did, thank you).
Lest you think they're a funk band (try a
"funky band"), they also throw out witty
zingers like the 8:38, damaged-folk "Floater"
and the Latin-to-stomper-rock beats of
"Theme from F.L.A.P." The vocals are occasionally grating, but a strange sense of humor
(musical and lyrical) and an odd instrumental
approach make this CD a mutant piece of
genius. (Half-Baked, PO Box 347148, Atlanta, GA 30334)

Biigskiill selftitled 10" (Quixotic)
Three songs, over
20 minutes, and beautiful like your grandparents' basement at night. Biigskiill (the ii's
make little happy faces! Isn't that nice!) are a
quartet of Portland conceptualists who have
released several cassettes and "singles" of,
shall we say, unfriendly music, although a lot
of it has had a definite pop appeal to it.
They are writing songs that are much
friendlier, although they average around seven
minutes apiece. "False Alarm" is a languid,
dreamy number that drifts by like clouds over
the ocean. "Next Wave" is even more languid, and it features a good chunk of angst,
some nice fretless bass, and a fair amount of
"rock". "Sunny Day Song" is the most languid, and ithas that woozy feeling of a person
awakened by an unusually bright sunbeam
after having strange dreams. And it's over
eleven minutes long.
While Biigskiill may not be the most
rocking or accessible outfit in the world, their
Sunday-afternoon music is utterly singular,
and actually kinda catchy at times.
To sum it up, if you're interested in
sampling some of the good (thought slightly
obscure) alternative music that is out there, I
would highly recommend these three bands.
They all make me glad I own a record player.

Athlete of the Week
Men's Tennis Swings Closer to National Title
By Jill Wildonger
Last weekend's rain did not
stop the Swarthmore men's tennis
team from fine tuning their strings
against SUNY-Binghamton. Taking the match inside, Swat crushed
the Upstate New York team 6-1.
Battling for the Garnet at doubles
were Brandt Lincoln '95 and V.J.
Toke '96, George Khalaf '96 and
Chris Ciunci '95, and Barry Mook
'96 and Paul Purewal '97 at first,
second and third doubles respectively. They were battling for the
all important doubles point. One
point is awarded for the team who
wins a majority of the doubles
matches, and one point is awarded
for each individual singles match.
While Lincoln and Toke pulled out
a win, Khalaf and Ciunci dropped a
heartbreaking match in the third set
tiebreaker. Mookand Purewal then

took the court and showed their
mettle by nabbing Binghamton in
another close tie breaker. The two
doubles wins put Swarthmoreahead
1-0 as the singles competition began. At first singles, Mook lost a
tough match. However, the Garnet
then took revenge by blasting
Binghamton in therest of the singles
matches to polish off a satisfying 61 victory.
The win over Binghamton
(rankednationally in the top twenty)
gives Swarthmore some momentum towards their goal of a national
championship. Swat is one of the
top 15 Division 111 teams in the
country, having suffered close regional losses to Williams and
Amherst. Victories over Skidmore,
MTT and B inghamton strengthen the
team's chance for a trip to California for Championship play. This
weekend's match against the Uni-

Catcher Queen

versity ofRochester will be crucial.
Swat tennis has qualified for nationals nineteen years in a row. In
1990, they took the national title,
and the plan on taking it again.
The National Championship
goal is realistic; a vigorous Division I schedule has challenged the
team, whichis vastly improved since
the early season losses against Williams and Amherst. The team has
depth as well as talent—Mook is a
strong player and teammate Khalaf
(at second singles) has been nicked
by only two spring losses. Rounding out the singles team are Brandt
Lincoln '96, Chris Ciunci '95, Chris
Pearson '95, and Hunter Galbach
'95.
Saturday's match against the
Yellowjackets will be at 11:00 on
theFaulkner courts near Wharton

to glory.

charge behind the plate for the
Swat Women's Softball Team.
Defending the plate with fervor, she pulls in the pitchers'
blazing fastballs and shoots
them right back out. Mollie,
fierce and incontestablebehind

Wednesday's game against
Dickinson she helped the team
out by playing right field where
she made a crucial catch.
Mollie's contributions are
definitely not limited to the
defense. Any timeshe gets near

hit a clutch RBI single and
eventually came around to
score a crucial run.
Mollie began her training

as a catcher on the team's
spring trip to Florida. Proving
her natural talent and skill she
debutedas Swarthmore's starting plate defender. The members of the team really appreciate her impressive performance, consistency and dedication. They are proud of her
continual development into an
outstanding catcher. "It's all

Now that I am slacking miserably in thefinal weeks of the semester, I finally have time to do all the
fun things I had always hoped to do
at Swarthmore. One of my plans
was to see the Philadelphia Phillies
before I graduate. So on Monday
night, Ryan Morgan and Ipiled into
the battlewagon and headed to
Veteran's Stadium for the Phillies'
gameversus the Los Angeles Dodgers (minus Darryl "Just Can't Say
No" Strawberry).
We got our $5 cheap seats,
picked up our $2.50 Phillies dogs
and headedway up to the nosebleed
section (I must say,the dogs are not
that good—l' dgo for the New York
Style for $3.50 if I had to do it over
again). And who do you imagine
we saw up there in the cheapest
section, why more Swatties of
course! There was a crew of
bumbling Dodgers fans led by Todd
Sasaki and all of Phi Si was there,
too. In fact, it seemed like everyone
in the cheap seats went to Swat, so
we felt right at home. I later heard
that all the poor folks who were
screwed out of block housing Were
given free Phils tickets by theDean's
Office —a choice location.
After a stirring National An-

them, the game got under way. It
was a fast paced affair with action
from start to finish. The Phils got
three runs in the first three innings
as Lenny Dykstra hit two doubles
and scored twice. After a brief in-

terruption in the play—Ethan
Klemperer ran across the field naked screaming "I love the
Krukker!" —the Dodgers stormed
back. Someone on their team hit a
three run blast to put them out in
front by one in the seventh inning.
The Phillies came back and
tied the score in the bottom of the
seventh. Then the game was pretty
quiet for a couple innings—there
were a lot of managerial moves, but
not a lot of action. In the bottom of
the ninth, with the score still tied,
John Kruk led off the inning for the
Phillies with a single. (In a postgame interview he claimed, "I did it
for the little boy who ran across the
field. That took a lot of courage.")
Dave Hollins then hit a ball right
back at the pitcher for a sure double
play, but the pitcher threw the ball
away. So now the Phillies had Kruk
on second, Hollins on first—no
outs—with power-hitting catcher
Darren Daulton at the plate. He
grounded into a double play, but
managed to push the rejuventated
Kruk over to third base. Jim

Eisenreich came to bat with the
chance to either win the game or
send it into extra innings. He hit a
soft grounder up the middle which
the Dodger's second basemen
bobbled before throwing to first.
But wait! A little home-cooking—
the first base umpire called
Eisenreich safe at first and Kruk
safe at the plate. The Phillies had
justbarely won. The crowd erupted!
Ethan ran across the field again—ensued—fans
pandemonium
stormed the field, people were
trampled—it was great!
Ryan and I, who were sitting
down on the field level by this point
of the game, managed to sneak out
with our lives and run back to the car
to beat the inevitable traffic jam.
We got lucky and sailed home in
record time. Still pumping with
adrenaline, I found it impossible to
sit down and do my Engineering
problem set for a while. So what's
the point of this story, you want to
know? "Nothing I guess—just a reminder that Michigan should have
won the NCAA championship and
there are many great spectator sports
in the local area that are easy to get
to (if you have a car), pretty cheap,
and a lot of fun. So don't wait till
you're about to leave Swarthmore
to discover them.
