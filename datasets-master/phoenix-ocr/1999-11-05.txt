Swarthmore students who participated in the March of the Americas last weekend pose at the Union
Theological Seminary in Manhattan after finishing the multi-day walk from New Jersey to New York City.

In a referendum, students will
be asked to choose among three
proposals for using student
space in Sharpies 111. The proposals are printed in this issue
of The Phoenix.
The space, currently a rundown old building that Student
Council allows groups to reserve
for events, will be renovated this
summer. Student Council, responsible for picking a proposal,
will put the question to students
this month.
One proposal, from the Photo
Club and the Student Art Association, would transform the
building to add a darkroom,
workspace and an art gallery.
"There isn't adequate space on
the campus to do the work we've
been trying to do and want to do
more of," said Eve Manz 'Ol,
speaking for the Photo Club at
Student Council's meeting Tuesday night.
A second proposal, from the
Swarthmore College Computing
Society, would add a 24-hour
computer lab to the main floor
of the building, using the basement for storage and the second
floor to house the group's Unix
servers.
"SCCS wants to provide an information resource rather than
just[be] a service provider," system
administrator
Tom
Stepleton 'O2 told Student Council.

The ballot will also contain an
option for maintaining the status
quo, keeping the building as a
student-reservable space.Facilities would make improvements
to the building anyway.
That idea was suggested by
Amy Swift 'OO and other members of the Swarthmore Warders
of Imaginative Literature, who
wanted students to continue to
be able to reserve the building.
Swift withdrew her proposal
Tuesday night after discussion
with members of SCCS. Manz
and Stepleton both said that their
proposals for the space would
allow the main floor to continue
to be reservable by other organizations.
"What's important to us is that
Sharpies 111 remains a studentreservable space," Swift said.
But after Swift withdrew her
proposal, Student Council members could not agree on whether
an option for the status quo
should remain on the ballot. Cochair Matt Schwartz 'Ol argued
that the council should not add a
proposal of its own after establishing a clear deadline for proposal submissions.
Facilities and Space Coordinator Amber Adamson 'Ol, however, said that students should be
allowed to continue to reserve
the space and so the option for
leaving the building in Student
Council's hands but with improvements should also appear

Vice presidents discuss ville plans, student parking

David Thomas 'O2 didn't understand
why a student who volunteers at a YMCA
off campus four days a week did not receive a parking permit. Jane Ng 'Ol was
unsure about where the college was in
plans to revitalize the Ville. These questions and more were the basis for a Fireside Chat Thursday night in Kohlberg
coffee bar with Maurice Eldridge, vice
president of college and community relations, and Larry Schall, vice president
for facilities and services.
The two major issues discussed were
Ville revitalization plans and parking.
According to Eldridge, the president of
the Board of Managers made a presentation a few years ago on the deterioration
of prosperity and development out from
cities, especially the blight of suburban
areas near Philadelphia. The Board of
Managers felt that the town of
Swarthmore was seeing this as most of
the positive development moved away

"[There were] increased conversations
between the town and the campus to prevent it from becoming economically depressed," Eldridge said. "After 14 months
of conversations, this report came out
that has 34 recommendations for what the
town might do."
Some of these recommendations included moving the bookstore out of the
basement of Tarble, improving the traffic flow by the underpass and building an
inn and restaurant close to campus.

College to begin Poland study abroad
By Patty Barrientos
Phoenix Staff

Bagels, juice, fruit to be

Six Swarthmore students
will be heading to Poland this
spring, inaugurating the
college's new semester abroad
program specifically established for Dance, Theater, Engineering and Environmental
Science majors.
"I'm very excited about this
and our students going over
there," said Engineering professor Art McGarity, who has
been actively involved in the
development with the foreign
studies program.
"It is an opportunity for students to go abroad and take
courses in depth which are relevant to their major," said
Allen Kuharski, Director of

at
Swarthmore, and another key

ture.

Both professors have reasons for being optimistic about
the new relationship between
Poland and Swarthmore.
Kuharski sees this as an opportunity for Swarthmore students to experience something
different from the typical
study abroad programs in
Western Europe.
"Most students don't have
any idea of what post-Soviet
Poland is like. The standard of
living is different; it's closer to
that of the Third World,"
McGarity said.
Swarthmore president Al
Bloom feels the program will
provide a unique study abroad
experience. "The country Poland has gone through rapid
changes in the transition to a
market economy. It's an exciting place to be," Bloom said.
"It's particularly educationalto
be part of institutions which
are choosing their priorities
and future of their society and
through that process gaining a
clear view of the pros and cons
of the alternatives that society
has chosen."
In addition, student interest
has been piqued, especially
among the engineering students. "Overall, foreign study
is very big on campus and the
engineering students wanted in
on this," added McGarity.
With the commitment of the
Office of Foreign Study, the
support of the administration,
growing student interest, and
the hard work of McGarity,
Kuharski and Sharon Friedler,
Director of the Dance department, the Poland Semester
Abroad was born.
Poland Semester Abroad is
comprised of two separate yet
parallel programs: the Engineering and Environmental
Science Poland program,
headed by McGarity and based
at the Technical University of
Krakow
(Polyteknika
Krakowska); and the Dance
and Theater program, headed
by Kuharski and based at the
Silesian Dance Theatre (Slaski
Teatr Tanca) in Bytom.
"The Poland location was not
random," added Kuharski. "Art

and will have the opportunity
of attending theater and dance
companies, dancing daily, helping organize the International
Festival of Dance, and taking
language and culture classes at
the Jagiellonian University.
Engineering and Environmental Studies students will
live in dormitories at
Jagiellonian University, which
is named after the prominent
Polish dynasty, and attend
classes there and at the Technical University of Krakow.
This arrangement will enable
the Engineering and Environmental Studies students to take
classes in English yet experience life in a non-Western, nonAnglophone country.
The Poland program is hoping to establish a two-way relationship between the Silesian
Dance Theatre of Bytom and
the Technical University of
Krakow that should last long
into the future. The first fruits
of the merger will be the six
Swarthmore students on the
way to Poland, but also the arrival of Jacek Luminski and
Vlad Wojcik.
Luminski is a dancehistorian
and the artistic director of the
Silesian Dance Theatre of
Bytom, work for which he has
been internationally acclaimed. He will be the Lang
visiting professor for the fall of
2001. Wojcik, of the Technical
University of Krakow, is the
Cornell visiting professor for
the year 2000. He will teach
environmental engineering
and related environmental topics.

The pilot for a new program
instituted by Student Council to
provide food between the hours
of midnight and 2 a.m starts
Tuesday In Parrish Parlours.
Students will be able to buy a
snack consisting of a bagel and
cream cheese, fruit, and juice
for a dollar. The program will
undergo a week long trial period,
when food will be available on
Tuesday and Thursday nights.
Student Council co-chair Jared
Solomon 'Ol organized the midnight food distributionprogram.
He initially proposed the idea to
the councillast semester, but, as
he explained, "Council didn't like
it because they thought people
wouldn't want to walk."
Solomon reintroduced the idea
this semester because it fills
what he perceives as a lack on
campus. Tarble and Kohlberg
Coffee Bar close at 10 p.m.,
Paces at 12 p.m., making it effectively impossible for students to
find food after midnight, especially for those without cars.
And, according to Solomon, the
hours when food is available at
these venues do not correspond
with typical study habits.
"The majority of students here
stay up 'til at least 2, and even
later. They're really hungry,
they're starving," Solomon said.
"So you go to vending machines
and there's all this junk. You get
it, but it's not fulfilling or nutritious."
Solomon hopes that the
Parrish Parlours program will
alleviate the need to rely on
vending machines for food after
midnight.
Student opinion is strongly in
support of the experiment. "We
think it's great," said Juan Mejia
'OO. "Just don't put the cream
cheese on the bagel. Put it on the
side." Students also considered
the price reasonable, but would
hesitate to pay more unless other
options were available. Coffee
and pizza were suggested.
"They should really sell slices
of pizza. I'm dead serious.
They'll clean up," saidEric Leive
'OO.
The opinion of one Willets resident, Roosbelinda Cardenas 'OO,
perhaps confirms Student
Council's earlier fears. While
she approved of the program,
she said that she would be unlikely to walk over to Parrish
from Willets. Other students,
however, saw the location as convenient.
"That's about the time I would
walk over to Parrish and buy
food out of the vending machines
anyway," said Gabe Rosenkoetter 'O2, who lives off campus.
Linda McDougall, head of Dining Services, will order the food
for the program. The funding
will come from Student Council
and the Dean's Office for the initial week. As to whether the program will continue in subsequent weeks, Solomon said,
"We'll just see how it goes."

Committee considering hike in wages for next year
ByAni Silwal
For The Phoenix

The Student Employment Sub-

committee of the College Budget
Committee has met twice this
fall to discuss several issues re-

garding student employment at
Swarthmore, including a wage
hike.
"We have familiarized ourselves with the comparative information of other selective liberal arts colleges and are ready
to make recommendations," said
Paul Aslanian, Vice Presidentfor
Finance and Planning. The subcommittee consists of three stu-

dents and representatives of the
faculty and administration.
"Student wages will almost
certainly be raised next year,"
said Student Council co-chair
Matt Schwartz 'Ol.
"The faculty and administration seem to have come around
to the idea that students here are
underpaid compared to other
suburban college markets," he
said.

Swarthmore expects its students
to contribute through their termtime employment is among the

ment.

"We don't want student employment to be an impediment to
what students are here for," said
Aslanian. The subcommittee is
also considering summer stipends, the breadth of the pay
scale and the recommended
work requirement.
Both Aslanian and Schwartz
expect a decision to be made by
the end of the fall and the hike

Student Council decided in
principle to pick up the tab for
students' booting fees so far this
semester at its meeting Tuesday
night.
Co-chair Jared Solomon 'Ol
said Student Council's parking
committee was mainly responsible for students' parking violations. Because the committee
failed to assign parking permits
until this semester, he said, many
students brought cars to campus
expecting to receive parking
spaces. When they did not, they
were left in the lurch, Solomon
said.
"If we would have done this
early in spring semester," he
said, "people would have
known."
In other business Tuesday
night, Student Council approved
the list of options for the
Sharpies 111 referendum ballot
(Pg. 1).

Student Budget Committee

treasurer Josh Bess 'OO reported

that Linda Thai 'O2 and Erica
Kaufman 'O3 had been hired as
co-editors of the Halcyon for this
year. Each will be paid a salary
of $l5OO, ending the months-long

absence of any staff for the
school's yearbook.
Curriculum Committeerepresentative Mike Spiegel 'O3 noted
that the committee was considering shortening the length of
the spring semester exams to allow students to leave campus
earlier at the end of the year.
Solomon, who noted his opposition even though the plan was
preliminary, said, "Everything's
preliminary and then it gets
voted on."
Solomon also said the council

assistant treasurer Marvin
Barron 'O2 said he would begin
work on a public access Internet
bulletin board that would allow
students to arrange textbook
swaps.
Barron also said that the
council's new Sunday and Tuesday van service to Target and
Genuardi's was wildly popular.
"It's actually more popular than
the Marple shuttle," he said.
Bess said that 25 to 30 people
had been riding it each night
during the trial period.

pus could mean moving the athletic fields across
the creek. Both administrators admitted that
this kind of major construction was still under
review by college officials.
"We're doing research; we're talking to a developer," Eldridge said. "We're far from a decision."
"I think if there was more and more to do in
the Ville, students would feel less pressure to
have a car," said Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3.
With this, the conversation segued to the second order of business, the student parking situation. Students offered their concerns and suggestions to remedy the fact that many students
perceive a serious lack of parking on campus.
Among the major ideas were turning the
Dupont lot or the C-lot into decked lots or converting the area of trees on one side of Mertz
into parking.
Immediate solutions suggested included the
redrawing of lines in the Dupont lot and the investigation of obtaining parking spaces in the
Strath Haven Condominiums, where the college
owns 16 units.
"Is it possible that we are missing the boat;
does the college own [l6] of those spots?" David
Thomas 'O2 said.
Rodney Morris 'Ol, who lived in Strath Haven last year, said that there were extra spaces
in its parking lot.
"I don't see why they would be opposed to renting those spaces," he said.
Other conversation was focused on the larger

solutions to the parking problem.
“When I first came here we had 100 spots
and 20 or 30 students were angry [about not
getting permits],” Schall said. “Now we have
almost 200 and twice the amount of students
are unhappy.”
Josh Kramer ’00 suggested that charging a
fee would decrease the demand for parking,
and also said that the SEPTA rail line did not
run late enough.
“In my years here, I have spent the night in
[a center Philadelphia] station nine times,” he
said.
However, not everyone at the chat was in favor of increasing parking on campus.
“I hesitate to jump on the parking bandwagon. The aesthetic that cars in general have
on the campus and the social impact [are negative],” Branen Salmon ’03 said.
However, there was still major concern centered around the way spots were selected for
this year.
“It seems a shame to tell people interested
in doing community service ‘Start walking,”’
Thomas said.
Eldridge agreed. “I’m not sure the solution
to getting activists to Chester or Marple is
more cars,” he said. “Maybe what we need is
more community transportation.”

As the 2000 presidential race heats up, so does the
activity of student groups devoted to political activism. With thousands of students
many miles from their hometown, the absentee ballot allows students to vote in their
hometown elections.
"Generally you must apply to the electoral committee of your home county," said
Bill Kimberling, deputy director of election administration at the Federal Election
Commission.
Kimberling said the manner in which ballots are counted varies from state to state.
"In some states it is counted on election night as if it's part of the regular count," he
said. "Others don't have that ability and add the total a day or two later."
Campus organizations such as the College Democrats and College Republicans devote much of their efforts toward increasing student participation in elections.
"We push voting in no matter what form," saidLisa Kohnke, the national field director for College Democrats of America.
Kohnke said that the number of students who vote either in their campus towns or
via absentee ballots varies. She also added that much of the Democrats' efforts are
focused at local chapters of the organization. Anjan Choudhury, president of the College Democrats at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., said his organization works to increase voter registration.
"Most people register at their homes," Choudhury said. "We try to promote voter
registration."
Choudhury said they rely on the national College Democrats Web site
(www.collegedems.org) for material related to voter registration.
Brad Murphy, chairman of the College Republicans at GW, said the College Republicans spend much of the year promoting student participation.
"We have sign-up sheets and write down the individual counties of students. We
have a list of every single county's election board with their address and phone number," Murphy said.
Murphy said the College Republicans generally push for voting in a student's home
district, as opposed to voting in the D.C. elections.
With the March 2000 primaries approaching, students who are not registered to
vote have to register by the time they return from winter break.
Murphy said that the College Republicans had conferred extensively with Project
Vote Smart (www.vote-smart.org), a non-partisan Web site that provides information
regarding local election boards and candidates from across the country.

JUSTIN KANE | Phoenix Staff

Student Council is asking for input about Sharpies 111 in a referendum.

SCCS offers to create 24-hour computer lab
The SCCS plan for Sharpies 111 is simple and
practical. We want to make it a 24-hour public
space, where people can study and relax, where
organizations can hold meetings, and where any
student or staff member can use our public computers for tasks ranging from work to e-mail to
web design to games.
Sound a bit boring? Keep reading. Here's why
we're excited about it:
Sharpies 111 is clearly a choice study and meeting area. It's at the bottom of the hill, roughly in
the center of all the dorms. Unlike the coffee bar
or Parrish Parlors, there isn't much distracting
traffic going by all the time. Sharpies and Essie
Mae's are next door in case anyone gets hungry.
And there's no question that the spacious basement
is better than Clothier lockers by far for storing
student groups' stuff.
It is these same attributes that make Sharpies
111 a great place for a computer facility. Students
wanting to check their e-mail after dinner wouldn't
have to hike all the way to Beardsley or their
dorms. If a paper needs to be written, Sharpies 111
provides a cozy environment where food is nearby
and the printer works. But best of all, it won't kick
you out at 2:00 a.m. That's because the SCCS wants
to keep Sharpies 111 open 24 hours a day, just like
the CS lab and computer facilities at most other
colleges around the nation. Using a computer at
3:00AM shouldn't entail annoying your roommate
or having a CS account.
You may wonder why the SCCS wants to run a
public area all of the sudden, or even who we are
in the first place. Right now, we run two UNIX
servers on campus, which hundreds of students
rely on for e-mail and for serving personal web
pages. We run monthly seminars on web design.
With over 800 student accounts, we might be called

the largest student organization on campus. But
this isn't enough. The SCCS wants to grow from
just providing a useful service to being a prime
educational and information resource for the
Swarthmore community. We'd like to offer web
clinics during staff hours on weekdays. We want
to make web pages that Swatties look at first thing
in the morning, just like our Williams counterparts
at http://wso.williams.edu/. We want to give students and staff access to powerful computers with
advanced multimedia capabilities, so that people
can integrate sound, video, and 3D graphics in web
pages, art projects, papers, theses, e-mail, and
whatever else they can think of. We want SCCS
seminars to be significant campus events. We want
to help the student groups who work in Sharpies
111 to use technology and the Internet to advance
their cause or just make a lot of noise.
In short, we want to nourish the kind of creativity that happens when people play with computers the kind of creativity that caused Swat alums
Ted Nelson to create modern hypertext and Justin Hall to author his world-famous web chronicle
(http://www.links.net). But we can't do it without a
centrally-located living space one that's not an
office or a computer lab, but a physical focus for
all students and groups.
There is so much we could do if only we had the
room. If you'd like to share Sharpies 111 with the
SCCS, please vote to make it our new home.
P.S.: We'll pay forall computer-related enhancements (like network jacks, video projectors, security systems, etc.) to Sharpies 111 ourselves!
P.P.S.: If some group or event occasionally requires the entire ground floor ofSharpies 111, we're
happy to move the furniture and computers into
the basement. Our plan is designed with collapsibility in mind.

Currently at Swarthmore, there is inadequate and ill-equipped
space for artistic students both to produce work and display that
work to the student body.
The Student Art Association and the Photo Club propose that
Sharpies 111 be converted to a darkroom, production space, and a
permanent student gallery.
For photographers and Photo Club members, who number over
80, the darkroom facilities on the fifth floor of Parrish are grossly
substandard in layout, equipment, and capacity.
The Student Art Association, which includes 60 members, has no
space of its own and relies on the generosity of the art department
for space. Also, the Pottery Club has met with little success in finding enough space to do their work.
The old student art gallery space was recently converted into the
student publication space. (For more information about the arts at
the college, please see the recent cover story on this subject in
Swarthmore, the alumni magazine.)
The purpose of renovating Sharpies 111 into a new photo/production/gallery space would be to provide proper darkroom facilities,
production space for finishing prints and other artwork, and proper
student gallery space for all art shows and displays.
This renovation would benefit the entire student body, allowing
artists a more suitable area in which to create their work and providing a place for the entire community to see what students have
created.
We believe that having an active, well designed space for our artists would increase the artistic output of students as well as the
quality of that output. It would also allow increased collaboration
between students with different skills and artistic backgrounds.
Sharpies 111 would be jointly administered by the Student Art
Association and the Photo Club.
A board of members of both clubs would maintain and manage
the building.
Any student/group could use the gallery as long as they have
passed through the board, receiving guidelines for its use. During
times when no art show is open, the gallery space would be available to any group or individualfor presentations, meetings, or other
activities requiring the space.
The upstairs darkroom and basement workspace would be maintained by the two organizing clubs, and any student could use the
facilities whenever they wished, provided they have received an
orientation.
We believe the strengths of this proposal are as follows:
1) It would utilize fully the entire building.
2) It would serve a specific, demonstrated need for art space and
facilities open to all students.
3)There are currently multiple meeting spaces open to all campus groups, all of which are under-utilized and none of which can
properly serve the needs of artistic display and production.

Continuing reservable space

will also be on student ballot
Sharpies 111 is currently a student-reservable space. This
space can be reserved for overnight retreats, parties, dinners,
meetings, anything and everything.

It can be reserved through
Student Council. This proposal
calls for the use of this space to
remain the same. Sharpies 111
would simply be renovated to improve the space.

Military budget: Sensible or indefensible?
REPUBLICANS

DEMOCRATS

By Dave Thomas

Phoenix Staff

By Ben Schweigert
Phoenix Staff

Every year, around this budget-crunching time, there is al
ways a push to cut the "wasteful" defense spending, so thai
more room can be freed up in the budget for social spending. H
just seems like such an easy cut. After all, how many stealtl
bombers does one country need?
Cutting defense is a classic example of partisan contention. Republicans want to keep or increase it, Democrats to cut it. While we simply accept this as another
side effect of the
two-party system,
when you think 1
about it, Democrats should be in
favor of keeping defense spending, and Republicans unsure about increasing it.
It never fails. As soon as war
breaks out in another country, many
Americans feel that it is our responsibility to step in and to prevent any human rights
atrocities, while at the same time prevent unnecessary destruction or death.
And though this is just a guess, I would say that the majority
of these people are Democrats, since Republicans tend to be
more isolationist. After all, if they can spend other people's
money freely, why not risk other people's lives? You think it is
a coincidence that the military is considered more Republican
than Democrat?
But acting as the world's protector requires a strong and ready
military. One of the reasons America loses so few troops is that
our weaponry is far superior to that of any other country, an
advantage that is the direct result of military spending.
Also, the Constitution enumerates 19 specific items on which
the government is allowed to spend money, four of them in the
preamble. So, if the government stuck to spending that was in
the Constitution, chances are the tax rate would be only 8 percent to 10 percent.
However, let's ignore how constitutional social spending is.
Simply, a cut in defense spending without an increase in social
spending would allow for tax cuts, which Republicans and everyone else really love. So you would think Republicans would
want to crush defense spending. And yet every year they defend it to the death, because they understand that for America
to fulfill its role as universal protector, it must have a strong
and ready military
So we want to protect the entire world, and we certainly want
to protect ourselves. We cannot cut defense spending. This is
simply not a mistake a sovereign country can afford to make.
If we are going to err, it should be on the side of safety.
Let us not forget that the way we eventually won the Cold
War was to outspend the Soviet Union. What might have happened had there been serious cuts in the budget?

The United States spends a colossal amount of money on the
military. In fact, since suchprograms as Social Security and Medicare are funded out of separate payroll taxes, more than one-half
of the money that we pay in income taxes goes to the Pentagon.
That is three times more than any other nation on the face of
the earth. Perhaps more importantly, that is more than the combined amount thatall neutral or hostile nations spend. Furthermore, our military technology is years ahead of that of any of
our allies, much less our potential adversaries. In the war in
Kosovo, our allies were forced to
rely on us for the precisionguided munitions and the satellite guidance systems that
tade the campaign
against Yugoslavia so
brutally destructive.
Let's examine
what we expect
from the military as
an instrument of policy
It is the crucial role of the
military to defend the soil of the United States from invasion, as
well as to beable to pitch in and help our allies defend theirs, but
not to doit for them.The United States military also must have a
role in international policing and humanitarian intervention, but
again, these are international problems, and the United States
only has a responsibility as part of an international solution.
There must also be enough strength for limited independent
action, but at present the Pentagon's plan calls for America to
be ready to fight three regional wars the size of the Korean
War simultaneously. That is preposterous.
Finally, it is not the role of the United States military to provide security for multinational corporations in other parts of
the world, as it did in the Gulf War. It is the security of the
American people, not that of American capital, that is the responsibility of the military supported by our tax dollars.
Having the most imposing military in the world is not necessary to secure these objectives. No nation can rival the military power of the United States, and if a hostile nation began to
threaten us, we have the industrial power to outproduce any
gains that they could make.
The territory of the United States and our allies is not under
threat, and the force that we have now goes far beyond what
would be needed to fulfill these other objectives. Yet we spend
almost $3OO billion on our military while 40 percent of Americans do not have adequate health coverage, while one in three
children live in poverty in our cities and while the vast majority
ofAmericans cannot afford higher education without incurring
a debt burden that would appall the citizens of our allied nations.
It is time that we gave some of these tax dollars back to the
hard-working Americans who earned them, instead of pouring
them into the pockets of fat-cat defense contractors who donate generously in election cycles.

No computer, no problem? No way
By Marina Boevska
For The Phoenix
Maybe this is pushing it a little too far,
but I definitely feel at a disadvantage
without a computer at Swarthmore, and
I don't think this should be so. At first I
thought it might be just me because I tend
to spend at least an hour every day checking my e-mail and writing to my friends.
But I talked to many people who don't own
computers here on campus, and they said
they, too, feel at a disadvantage.
You definitely need a computer at
Swarthmore. I am sure that most of the
students here (if not all of them) take at
least one class that requires word-processed papers. Many classes expect you
to regularly consult the Internet. For
some classes, the only way you can check
your due dates is to consult the web.
There are many important e-mail messages, coming from school organizations,
whichyou have to check daily, not to mention that e-mail is the means through
which most students keep in touch with
their off-campus friends.
It is true that there are public computers all over campus. I have almost never
had a problem getting access to one when
I needed it, but it seems that the computer
access that we have is not good enough.
I think that the first problem is with the
hours computers are available. I tend to
work on papers late at night, and I'm not
the only student here who does that. Two
weeks ago I was sitting at McCabe, peacefully pondering the beauty of chemical
bonding and how to express it best in my
paper, when I suddenly heard the most
piercing noise, screaming away like a fire
alarm. It turned out to be the sound they
put on every night a half-hour before

SWARTHMORE

I

McCabe closes, but at first I was absolutely
sure I was about to get stuck in a burning
library.

During the week you can have computer access from 8:15 a.m. until 2 a.m.
in Beardsley (and if the consultant wants,
he or she may keep the lab open if there
are three or more students working in it).
On Fridays and weekends, the situation
is even worse. The latest you can work
Fridays and Saturdays is 10 p.m., and on
Sunday the earliest timeyou can get hold
of a public computer is noon.
I realize that whoever made up the
schedules tried to make themreasonable
and had in mind the students’ schedules
and tendencies to sleep late on weekends
and party on Friday and Saturday nights.
I agree that during most weeks nobody
needs a computer on a Friday or Saturday evening or on a Sunday morning. But
I think there are some extreme circumstances when you might need a computer
during these hours.
For example, what if you didn’t do your
highly important English paper during
the week, you know you still need to put a
lot of work into it and you decide to wake
up early on Sunday so that you can work
on it. Surprise no computers available.
This probably means you should actually plan ahead and do all your work in
advance, so you are not dependent on the
working hours of the public areas. But
there are certain cases when you just
can’t plan ahead (you had friends visiting or you had questions on the paper and
couldn’t get hold of your professor), and
in those cases, not having a computer puts
you at a disadvantage.
The second important problem is with

the programs on the computers. I've realized that there are many computers that
lack basic programs like Microsoft Word
and Excel. There are some classes that
require the use of special programs
and these
Kaleidagraph, for example
programs are available only at certain
computers on campus. So often, you
might find yourself running around computers looking for a computer with "the
right program."
The last problem is printing. The biggest printing center is in Beardsley The
three printers there print hundreds of
pages every minute, and it is extremely
hard to find your own tiny paper in the
huge pile. Of course, everybody else from
your class has the same paper due that
same day, so the papers look more or less
alike, and you are stuck looking through
a huge pile of "The Beauty of Chemical
Bonding" for your personal masterpiece.
I don't want to go on just complaining
and complaining. I could, but I would like
to suggest that we have a room where
there are at least ten computers available
24 hours a day, seven days a week. Itcould
be just one room; I don't think the libraries should change their working hours
because of the small part of the student
body who doesn't have computers. In
many schools computers are available
around the clock, and I hope we can have
this opportunity here at Swarthmore.
I am also sure that there is a way to put
all necessary programs on all of the computers in that room, so that you know that
there is at least one place on campus
where you can always find what you need.
As for printing, the only suggestion goes
to the students printing
put your name
on every single sheet you print, so that
you have much less paper to look through.

U.S. military
poses no threat
to Puerto Rico
Puerto Ricans have long come to associate American military presence with
darker eras of their turbulent history.
Nonetheless, their objections to the
United States military's use of live-fire
exercises on the island of Vieques hold
no practical reasoning and, if complied
with, would pose a danger to the national
interest.
Less than 1000 acres of Puerto Rican
land is used by the Navy and Marine
Corps for bombing and artillery drills, as
opposed to the far greater sizes of certain other U.S. military bases. In nearly
60 years of training, mishaps have resulted in just one fatality—responsible,
in fact, for the current debate. Even in
this case, however, the victim in question
was a naval employee killed by a bomb
that despite straying from its intended
target, did fall within the confines of the
base. Such facts domuch to dispel notions
that the military exercises pose threats
to densely populated civilian centers.
A presidential panel conducting an investigation of the issue recently concluded that live-fire exercises on Vieques
are indeednecessary for the proper training of U.S. military forces, as there exists no comparable site on the East Coast.
The panel did show some flexibility by
recommending that live-fire exercises be
cut from 180 to 130 days per year, and
that they cease altogether after five
years.
Many Puerto Rican leaders, however,
still want the shooting stopped permanently and immediately. Such individuals
must realize the futility of their demands
and prove themselves open to compromise if anything is to be accomplished.
Furthermore, the persistent assertions
by some activists that the live-fire exercises have devastated the environment
and ecological stability of Vieques seem
to ring hollow. The Puerto Rican
government's official Web site on Vieques
describes the wonders of its "secluded
beaches, shell grounds, coral reefs, archaeological digs, horseback trails in the
inland hills and mangrove lagoons that
serve as nesting and gathering places for
123 species of birds." It is difficult to
imagine such harmony in the hellish
world of "craters" and "spent uraniumdepleted shells" that some would like to
depict as having existed for the past 60
years.
History teaches us that the Puerto
Rican antipathy to U.S. military intentions
is both understandableand time-honored.
Yet people can find better ways to vent
their frustrations thanby targeting a base
which for all purposes does not appear to
pose a danger to the island. Furthermore,
the government of Puerto Rico would do
well to remember that for all intents and
purposes their island, through the recent
mandate ofits inhabitants, is apart of the
United States. Thus, what affects the
American national interest ultimately
holds implications for the people of
Puerto Rico as well.

Containing communism
Before you read any further, take this simple quiz.
Jack is a student at a Prestigious Liberal Arts College with an endowment
of nearly $1 billion. He speaks three languages and can program in four.
Jack holds a job that demands a great deal of skill. He is depended upon by
faculty, staff and students to provide a valuable service. Without Jack and
others like him, many crucial resources could not be maintained.
How much should Jack be paid?
a. Minimum wage
b. $l.lO more than minimum wage
c. The market rate for his skills
If you answered a or b, congratulations now you're thinking like a Prestigious Liberal Arts College Administrator.
It takes a lot of intelligence to be a Prestigious Liberal Arts College Administrator. After all, how do you, as a Prestigious Liberal Arts College Administrator, explain your answer to Jack?
According to Prestigious Liberal Arts College Administrator Logic, the answer is simple: "We realize that most students are worth more than we can
pay, but we must be fair to all by having standard payrates [sic]."
"Ah-ha!" you say. "Now I understand." In the world of Prestigious Liberal
Arts College Administration, it makes perfect sense to depress the wages of
90 percent of students to keep the other 10 percent from feeling jealous.
No self-respecting Swarthmore student would feel jealous if another studentmakes more than he or she does. Nobody is getting rich off student wages
mostly we're just trying to pay for one of the most expensive educations in
the world.
Take a look at the schools around us. In the 1998-99 Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) survey of 13 top liberal arts colleges,
Swarthmore's maximum hourly wage fell $0.85 short of the median. Haverford
pays $7 per hour for all its campus jobs. Carleton? $7.04 an hour. Amherst? Up
to $7.40 an hour. At Wellesley, lifeguards are paid $9.50 per hour, and don't
even get us started about Harvard let's just say $25 an hour is a sweet deal
for fixing computers.
It's not just that Swarthmore doesn't pay students enough. We simply aren't
allowed to earn very much, either. The cap on financial aid job offers is $1360,
more than $5OO less than the COFHE median and the lowest of the schools
surveyed.
low wages and a low earnings ceiling
Put together, these two qualities
mean one thing: inflexibility. For students with financial aid job offers, it's
pretty much a given that they have to work seven or eight hours a week to
fulfill their work-study obligations.
So how do we make student employment flex again? Simple
step out of
the world of Prestigious Liberal Arts College Administration, raise the wages
and give students the option to earn more or less than the ceiling.
In other words, give Jack the power to decide when and how much to work,
because all work and no play make Jack a dull boy.

A band-aid for the Halcyon
Maybe now this year will have a yearbook.
In September, the fall semester started, and memorable stuff happened.
But with no editors of the yearbook, no one was there to record them for
posterity. It was a realistic fear that there wouldbe no yearbook for the Class
of 2000
a scary proposition since years from now the Halcyon will bring
back more memories than any fundraising phonathon.
The situation looks decidedly better for this year now that Student Budget
Committee has found two students willing to accept the Senior Class officers'
proposal for salaried editor-in-chief positions.
But it is a shame that no one seemed interested in the yearbook until the
salaries were offered. That is not to suggest the editors should not be paid;
payment adds accountability and increases the quality of the final product.
Witness The Phoenix's changes since its editors were first paid last semester.
The lack of interest in working on the yearbook, though, is matched only
and perhaps caused
by most students' lack of interest in reading it. When,
because of its price, the Halcyon is effectively only distributed to seniors,
and for that matter distributed many months after they become young alumni,
it is understandable that few people have an interest in a book that has decreased in quality in recent years.
The new editors doneed to address the incredible expense of producing the
yearbook, but asking for support from the college itself is not a good solution.
That would only increase the isolation from the student body and underclassmen, and make the publication less of something the average Swattie would
want to work on, be proud of, and look forward to at the end of the year.
We hope instead that paying the editors of the Halcyon will stimulate a new
era of innovatively cheaper, high-quality journalism from the campus's second most important publication.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Tolerance includes conservatives, too
To the Editor:
Tolerance is a beautiful thing
on that
everyone can agree. We all feel like people
should be tolerant of minority opinions, no
matter how unpopular they may be. Still with
me so far? Good, because tolerance has to
cut both ways. If you are going to insist that
conservatives should be tolerant of homosexuals (which they should), than you must
also insist that liberals be tolerant of conservative ideals, no matter how unpopular they
may be.
Next Friday and Saturday the College Republicans will be having Republican Coming Out Day. This is not meant to mock SQU
or the national week. It is meant to expose
the attitude that many people at Swarthmore
have of conservatives on campus and the
way conservative ideals are often treated.
Sometimes Republicans at Swat are treated
like an extremely unpopular minority, and
no one wants to hear what they have to say.
For a school that prides itself on being understanding and liberal and tolerant, this is
a travesty.

Swat should up population, improve athletics
By Daniel Jacobs
For The Phoenix
The effects of increasing student population are encouraging on all fronts.
Admittedly, the best publicity for a
school like Swarthmore is its academic
reputation. A close second would be a
noteworthy athletic program, which
would produce new interest in attending
Swarthmore from all corners of the globe.
This would surely lead to an increase
in the number of applicants, so that the
quality of first-years admitted could rise
every year. If we had 2000 students, we
would still retain the advantages we have
today, just with a little more prestige in
our long-dormant athletic program.
This college has already taken strides
to rebuild the futile athletic program.
Now it's time to take the biggest step and
increase our enrollment in order to take
our athletic program to the next level.
We don't need to change the atmosphere
of Swarthmore. Our campus takes pride
in its diversity, and I encourage it to stay
that way. The proportion ofathletes to nonathletes doesn't have to change. Our diversity is what makes our campus the wonderful smorgasbord that it is.
The intense academics for which
Swarthmore is known will not change, nor
will the quality of applicants. Increasing
enrollment can only be good for the school
and can only transform the anemic athletic program at Swarthmore into a nationally recognized one.
There are more athletes in the Class of
2003 than the previous class and more in
the Class of 2002 than in the class before
that. The college is putting a greater stake
in its aching athletic program.
Unfortunately, the grim reality is that
Swarthmore sports have not seen much
of an improvement. With less than 1400

SWARTHMORE
students, Swarthmore can’t compete on
a national level in most sports without
lowering its academic standards and compromising its reputation.
Swarthmore’s uncompromising academic standards make recruiting athletes
more difficult than at other schools. Student-athletes need to fit a certain profile
to even be considered. These standards,
combined with the college’s reputation
for being such a work-heavy school,
quickly weed out most potential recruits.
This makes it very difficult for
Swarthmore to attract many athletes.
Most other schools have much lower
academic standards than Swarthmore,
which gives them a much wider recruiting pool. This shouldn’t bother us, though.
We’ve already altered our admissions
policies to allow for better student-athletes, so why aren’t we seeing the results?
The unfortunate reality is that the persistent recruiting by our coaches just isn’t
enough to elevate the athletic program to
a national level. The school has to maintain diversity; with 1400 students there
aren’t enough slots to sustain a viable
number of good athletes.

Swarthmore relies heavily on athletes
that play multiple varsity sports. Unless our
schoolbecomes much more sports-oriented
and inevitably athlete-dominated (which is
a solution I do not advocate), our athletic
program will continue to be at a huge disadvantage. Most Division 111 schools have
more than 2000 students, allowing them the
option to recruit many more athletes than
Swarthmore while still maintaining a good
athlete to non-athlete student ratio. Our
schoolneeds more athletes if it ever wants
to boast an overall competitive athletic program. There is no way around it.
If Swarthmore increases the student
body to about 2000, we can finally turn
around our athletic program. The ratio of
athletes to non-athletes can remain the
same, and so could the school's admissions
policies. Swarthmore could keep the same
academic standards while maintaining diversity. Coaches would have a better
ability to recruit and retain talent.
This will give each sports team a bigger and better core of athletes, similar to
the core at other Division 111 programs.
With good coaches and a typical
Swarthmore work ethic, this school could
soon be able to take pride in a great sports
program once again.

I love music. All types. A quick glance
through my CaseLogic shows that I dine
on a full and diverse aural feast. My music ranges from Bruce Springsteen's
"Live/1975-85," a Taiwanese-dialect pop
CD, Missy Elliot's "Da Real World" toLuis
Miguel's "Todos Los Romances". Then
there's also Warren G's "Regulate
GFunk Era," MaxiPriest's "Bonafide," The
Bangles' "Greatest Hits," a smattering of
I'll admit it
jazz and classical and
lots of Mariah Carey.
My next shopping spree will include
Mana's "MTV Unplugged," and Zapp &
Roger's "All the Greatest Hits." It's got
such old skool classics as "I Want to Be
Your Man," "More Bounce to the Ounce"
and "Computer Love." Oh, I shiver at the
thought of all this yummy music.
But people sometimes laugh at my CD
collection. They need to step off! I take
my musical tastes very personally. I can
probably trace my musical tastes back to
my two older brothers. Since they are
eight and ten years older than me, I have
been able to mooch off of their teenage
musical purchases since I was six.
My first favorite was "Born in the
U.5.A.," the Springsteen gem of 1984. I
remembering listening to it over and
over again on the Walkman in the halflight of my bedroom, somehow
lyrics and melodies resonating to a six-yearold girl with only a year of living in
America under her belt. "Hey little girl
is your daddy home/Did he go away and
leave youall alone/I got a bad desire/I'm
on fire." Sure. I didn't know what being
"on fire" really meant. But I did like the
rhythm and identified with the lonely
little girl.
Until my sophomore year of high
school, my musical tastes were strongly
shaped by the evolution of my brothers'
music. My older brother, Tony, had A-Ha's
"Hunting High and Low," then this Australian chick Kylie Minogue's tapes, U2
records, the Pet Shop Boys, Mike & the
Mechanics and some obscure German
imports.
All I can recall about my second
brother Tom and his music was all his
hardcore gangster rap and reggae. I'm
talking about all the N.W.A. (Eazy-E, Ice
Cube, MC Ren, and Dr. Dre's old crew)
records, Public Enemy's "Yo! Bum Rush
the Show," some Egyptian Lover bootyshaking music, Bob Marley and Aswad.
During my elementary school years, he
would randomly have outbursts of Maxi
Priest's "Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world"
or some Compton-style "I left my wallet
in El Segundo!" while opening the refrigerator door. How could I not have been
influenced by brothers who were so
moved by these sounds?
My tastes don't just reflect a timeline
of my childhood. Music was one of the
many ways for me to learn about accepting a diversity of cultures as an immigrant who had to feel comfortable with
newness and heterogeneity. And paradoxically, listening to this music was my
connection to American pop culture,
while it was also a very individual love
that gave me a proud sense that I had
unique identity; let's just say that growing up none of my peers knew the artists
I liked.
So next time you see me at an iMac in

For junior Nicole Bouttenot, parking at Swarthmore has always been an
in brinksmanship. Last semester, undeterred by the fact that she v*»s dsjfiie
ing permit, she kept her car in Dupont lot. And sure enough, nothing happen
though she received several tickets, she ignored them without suffering ai
quences.

Part One:
The parking lobby vs.The People
The recent fight for more
parking has been led by a group
of die-hard activists who aggressively extol the merits of
parking. Parking, for the lobbyists, is almost a must. "Every
other college recognizes that
people over the age of 18 need

cars
said Dave Thomas 'O2, one of
the Student Council members
who drafted the parking petition.
In a blunt editorial published
in The Phoenix (Op-ed. 10/22),
Student Council CPC representative Nick Attanasio 'OO lambasted the administration for
neglecting to address increasing parking demands. Accord-

ing to Attanasio, "parking,
while not a necessity, is not really a luxury." More parking
means better student activities
and better student life, he argued.
But at the "street" level, the
rhetoric is a lot calmer. This is
perhaps partly due to the fact
that most students don't have
cars. Outof the 201 students we
surveyed, only 32 (15.9%) kept
cars on campus.

Among those who are not
mobilized on this issue, few are

iams, "and part of it is having a

car. It's a very simple basic element of a normal person's
life." She believes that every
senior should be guaranteed a
parking spot.
Williams also seconded Nick
Attanasio's belief that more
parking would increase the
quality of student activities on
campus. As Treasurer of the
International Club last year,
Williams found that her club
was constantly hinderedby the
lack of access to a car. "We
ended up having to badger the
one or two people in the entire
club who had a car or sign up
for the van a week or two in
advance just so we could go buy
food," Williams remembered.
But most interviewedbelieve
firmly that while increased
space would be a plus, it is not
a must. Parking, they feel,
should be weighed against
other priorities demanding
space as well.
"There are way more important things than parking," said
Elizabeth Newcomb 'OO.
Sara Cole 'O3 agreed. "We
have so little space left on campus to begin with," she said,
"[and] there are much more
important things to use it for

than parking."
Tim Heffernan 'OO cited the
tradeoff between "aesthetic"
considerations and being able
to go off-campus. If parking
was expanded without limits,
he said, "you would have acres
and acres of parking, which
would be ugly as hell and a
waste of space."
However, Heffernan does
believe that the increase in
parking demand is so overwhelming that part of it should
be met.
The bottom line is, for students, parking space should not
be an entitlement, as the parking activists have suggested. "I
don't think it's the College's
duty to provide parking for students," said Newcomb.
"The College should have no
obligation to provide [parking]," opined Tushar Parlikar
'Ol.
In fact, many students see
having a car at all as a bonus,
and are concerned that any
parking expansion would only
benefit the select few who do
have cars.
"Having a car for most
people is a luxury," according
to Newcomb.

Hershey believes that even if
you have a car, going off-campus may not be worth the
trouble. "To take the time to go
somewhere else is not worth
the hassle," she said, "because
the time consumedby travel is
not worth it." Instead, she believes, students view cars "as a

students, both pro-parking and
otherwise, were skeptical of the
college's reasoning behind issuing a limited number of parking spaces. One of the popular
administrative arguments is
that if more studentshave cars,
the mobile culture will detract
from Swarthmore's residential
life. "I would hate to see us as
the kind of campus where
people disappear for the weekend," said Dean of the College
Bob Gross. "The need [for more
spaces] isn't obvious to us as a
necessary adjunct to student
life."

fumed an agitated Cole. "That's
wrong, obviously."
"It shouldbe the choice of the
student to decide whether or
not to be on campus," said
Matula.
But there are those who support the administration's view.
Many sophomores do want to
leave campus, Hershey observed, and allowing more
sophomores to do so would reduce the "cohesiveness among
the lower classes, between
freshman and sophomores,"
she said. "And I think I would
rather have that type of cohesiveness, even though it is not
always pleasurable to stay on

campus."

Another commonly-used argument is that since alcohol is
served on campus, more parking permits would indirectly
encourage more drinking and
driving. Again, students question this line of argument.
Students who drink and drive
will continue to drink and drive,
Parlikar insisted.
At best there is only a tenuous relationship between drinking and driving and the number
of parking spaces issued,
Heffernan believes. "It's not
like you give out ten more parking space and that's why this
guy got into a crash," he said.
Some of the students simply
trust their peers not to engage
in dangerous behavior. "I don't
think Swatties are that stupid,"
remarked Hershey.

PartThree:

Part Four:

Real or artificial demand? Questioning the parking application process

Possible Solutions

There isalso the issue of whether the increase in demand would
continue to rise even if more spaces were built. In a letter to
Student Council, Vice President Schallasserted that the increase
in demand is simply spurred by the increase in parking spaces.
"[A]s the [number of] spots increase[s], so does the demand," the
letter said. "It is a never-ending circle." Attanasio, on the other
hand, believes that the increase in demand is real demand that
never got met in the first place.
Dean Gross speculates that the demand is bloated because the
permit application process is
biased in favor of seniors. And
many of these seniors do not
really need cars, according to
Gross.
"There seems to be an inclination to do it in an easy way,
which is to give spaces to seniors," Gross said. "[But such
a process] ends up leaving underclassmen who have legitimate reasons stuck."
While the College decides
how many student parking
spaces are available eachyear,
a student committee decides
who gets the permits. The committee takes into consideration
both seniority and need. Members of the Parking Committee
could not be reached for comment by press time.
This year, a parking committee had not even been formed
by the time parking applications needed to be evaluated,
and a temporary committee
had to fill the void. Student
Council acknowledges oversight, and has even suggested
compensating students who
were denied permits this semester and whose cars were
booted.
Both students and administrators alike called for parking
decisions to be made earlier, in
the Spring.

An increase in student parking space isn't likely to occur
soon, according to Schall and
Gross. In fact, the already-tight
parking situation is likely to
become even tighter when 50
additional construction workers begin work on the DuPont
renovation, which is scheduled
to begin in the Spring of 2001
and continue for six years.
lb substantially increase student parking, the College would
have to either pave over green
space or construct a parking
garage, the cost of which would
run into the millions. No such
plans are included in the current DuPont renovation campaign, said Schall, nor are they
likely to take shape in the next
few years.
Even if the administration
were to commit to expanding
student parking, the issue
wouldremain of where to construct these new spaces. Proposals that include paving over
athletic fields, the most conspicuous areas of flat space on
campus, predictably bring protests from athletic teams.
Both Gross and Schall, like
some of the interviewed students, expressed concern about
the potential environmental
impact of a parking expansion.
"If we were to pave over large
areas of green, there would be
a huge student uproar," Gross
said. "The majority of students
don't have cars and don't want
to live on a campus overridden
by cars."
In an email to Thomas, the
parking activist, Vice President
Schall expressed concern about
preserving the integrity of the
arboretum. "Cars, while certainly convenient and even a

'The Simpsons'
loses freshness
of prior years
Call it a mercy killing. "The Simpsons"
used to be a brilliant show but now it
needs to be taken off the air before its
mediocrity, its excrutiating ordinaryness,
does any further damage to itself or to
any more of its poor, deluded, dogmatic
viewers. For eight seasons, "The
Simpsons" was the very best show of 90s
and will be remembered that way but the
last two or three years has seen its descent into a kind of wacky and uneven
predictability. I've stopped watching the
new Sunday night episodes altogether—it's too painful and the early evening overrun reruns are still too good—but the
show continues to maintain a stubborn
viewership, full of excuses, people who
conflate the way the show used to be with
the way they wish it still was.
Everybody our age loves "The
Simpsons"—it was our show more so than
it was anybody else's. We went to middle
school when it was cool to wear Bart
Simpson t-shirts a size or two too big. We
learned to drink and smoke when our
mouths were full up with episode summaries, near-miss recountings of
punchlines. We did the Bartman. If"Twin
Peaks," a failure, expanded our notion of
what was possible on television, then "The
Simpsons" went beyond just a primetime
cartoon or a parody of a domestic sitcom
to animate all the potential that was already there in the medium—gave back
to us the America raised on Cosby and
Carson and Reagan and Big Bird, gave it
back to us as a circus, hilarious and
satiricial and psychotically inventive and
sometimes even sort of moving.
What was it about "The Simpsons" that
made it so freaking good? That it was
funny was only the half of it. For starters, there was its expansiveness of place
and populace. While "Friends" seems
crowded with six characters, and
"Seinfeld" was always too busy with four,
"The Simpsons" maintains one-hundred
and seventy-one regular characters, all
of whom are, if not necessarily complex,
then vividly realized. Apu, Mr. Skinner,
Chief Wiggum, Moe, Groudskeeper Wiley,
Krusty the Clown, Ned Flanders, Mr.
Burns and Smithers—the list of wierdos
and kooks, neighbors and nuts, goes on
and on and on and everyone has a favorite, a voice they imitate in place of aparty
trick. These characters are not scenery
but singular personalities and Springfield
is not Anywhere, USA but a somewhere.
Or look at it this way. Your average
sitcom, say, "Dharma and Greg" or "Everybody Loves Raymond," has a sterile
chastity to it of set-up and punchline;
there is nothing to distract from the delivery of the joke, no periphery, no life
beyond the comedians in the medium
length two-shot. In that, most sitcoms are
the surface of the moon. But "The
Simpsons" is insane with details. "The
Simpsons" was the Salman Rushdie of
prime time; everything for them was resource. They deploy to mock an encyclopedia of pop culture scholarship from
Stanley Kubrick to Steve Allen, "Dallas"
to Dickens, vaudeville to Vader. I read an
interview once where Matt Groening, the
show's creator, said that the people who
were writing for him now were the kids
who grew up watching the show. And
that's what wrong with the show these last
few seasons: its sense of history goes
back only so far as itself. Matt Groening
said somewhere else that "The Simpsons"
used to be derivative of other things and
now it's just derivative of itself. "The

Exploring the outer limits of cinema
By Gabriel Hankins
Phoenix Staff
What do idiot German dwarves in a
volcanic wasteland have to do with black
children in rusted-over Watts, California,
or the fallout of suicide in Japan?
Swarthmore's Film Society has screened
films with all of these themes and more
but beyond that has no answers.
However, answering questions is not
the role of either the society or the movies it screens. The Film Society, which
meets on Wednesday nights, is aresource
for alternate realities, from experimental analysis of film images to elegiac compositions of death and the sea, from the
anarchy of poverty to the games of the
insane: interesting but unknown films
that expand our world view in the widest
sense of the word.
"We try to get these unusual movies
from different times and nations
screened here, movies that you wouldn't
be seeing otherwise. These movies aren't
even available on VHS, which is an inferior medium anyway," said Jonathan
Shainin, co-director of the Film Society.
Of the first four screenings this year,
the most intellectually disorienting was
"Auch Zwerge HabenKlein Angef angen"
("Even Dwarves Have To Start Somewhere") by Werner Herzog, a film that
cuts the moorings of standard logic, standard narrative, standard characters and
standard other things, all while riding on
a jagged edge between laughter and
shame. The movie is about an insurrection of German-speakingidiot dwarves inexplicably set in an isolated Canary Island insane asylum. The experience of the
movie is truly as strange as this summary
suggests, with the camera moving equally
between the violently deformed actions
of the dwarves and the beautifully surreal volcanic landscape.
This film seems to function primarily
as a bizarre splicing of postcards from
several distinct universes, all of which
bear only superficial resemblance to our
own universe. It's most interesting as a
blow to logic and order in general. In the
next film, on the other hand, order and
logic are present and continuous, following a plot that is almost painfully simple.
"MaboroshiNo Hikari" ("IllusoryLight
or Mirage") is the first film of acclaimed
director Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose second film "Afterlife" was widely distributed in the United States. The 1995 film
follows the life of a young Japanese
woman whose husband one day walks in
front of a train. She cannot understand
his suicide; in fact, nothing in the film can
point toward this understanding. After
several years she remarries and moves
to a far seashore, taking her young son

Shainin brings this week's Film Society movie, "My Friend Ivan Lapshin," into focus.

with her to move in with her new husband
and his father. She is content, but the
death still weighs on her.
This is a movie as living time, slowly
examining a period that is ordinary in its
impenetrability. The Japanese aesthetic
of stillness and complexity in resting permeates the cinematography, and an equal
minimalism enfolds the dialogue. The end
result is an like watching a vivid though
slow memory on film, a memory with
moments of stunning beauty. All action
is so gradual that the whole is almost a
still-life; all meaning and expression can
be seen entirely in every frame.
The third movie, "Killer of Sheep" by
Charles Burnett, was less interesting than
the others partially because of the more
conventional narrative structure and partially because of the loss of most dialogue
in the soundtrack, which distorted the
higher frequencies of sounds.
The film follows families and particularly children in 1970s Watts, the wasted
fringe of Los Angeles most famous for
the 1965 race riots. The conditions that
produced these riots are apparent here,
as fathers struggle to provide, mothers
struggle to love and children struggle to
be children, all in the grip of crushing
poverty.
A scene near the beginning summarizes
the sheer anarchy of the children's lives,
as boys cheerfully throw rocks at each
other at close range in the baked pit of a
dead industrial lot. When a train passes,
all run alongside throwing rocks until the
last car moves out of range. The feeling
is not of political protest or of willful
malice, but rather of stubborn reaction
against any power andany structure that
remains intact here, in the wasteland of

the industrial age. The slaughter shops
of modern America, while not as alien as
the landscapes of the asylum, were just
as alienating.
The richest of the films thus far was
offered when, as Shainin said, he decided
he was "not being hard-ass enough about
the films."
"Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son" is Ken
Jacobs' 1969 rephotographing of a 1905
short by Billy Bitzer, D.W. Griffith's cinematographer. The original short was
only ten minutes long; the new version is
108. While the narrative is not always coherent, the original film is fairly straightforward. The Jacobs version is a radically
different experimental piece that dissects
the technology and the formal conventions of film, using a film that was itself
of a generation that came before cinematic conventions were firmly set.
It first zooms in on repeated portions
of the screen, enlarging until the images
become the abstract shifting of black exposure on white emptiness, shadows without reference. The mind starts to make
up the form that it knows must exist in
the morass, fabricating faces and demons
that vanish as they appear. The film is
sped up until the image becomes a column of shifting gray lines; it is slowed
down to the stillness and grace of a single
arrangement of bodies. It is focused
through and past intelligibility. It is frozen, zoomed, reversed, panned, sped up
and reshot.
This is a basic and often elegant examination of film technology itself, and an
examination of the full content of a simple
sequence of images; almost incidentally
it plays withperception and significance,
components of thought as well as cinema.

Sociologist Wilson to speak Thursday
By Nick Goodness
For The Phoenix
The celebrated sociologist William Julius Wilson, known for his
analysis of the black underclass,
will be coming to Swarthmore to
speak Thursday, Nov. 11, in the Lang
Performing Arts Center at 8 p.m.
Named by Time magazine as one
of America's 25 Most Influential
People, Wilson is widely regarded
as one of America's leading scholars on race and class. Wilson's lecture, entitled "Rising Equality and
the Case of the Multiracial Political
Coalitions," will discuss issues
raised in his latest work, "The
Bridge over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics."
The book examines the changing
dynamics of a multiracial society
and its correlation to contemporary
economic inequities. The book goes
on to analyze the concentration of
power among the advantaged elite
and an infrastructure that caters to
these powerful interests.
Wilson has authored numerous
books that have changed the way we
view modern society. His book "The
Truly Disadvantaged" was named
by the New York Times Book Review as one of the 16 best books of
1987. Wilson has written other
books, including "The Declining Significance of Race" and "When Work
Disappears: The World of the New

Urban Poor.”
Innovative proposals to help the
conditions of the black urban poor
have been hallmarks of Wilson’s
ideology and have included numerous attempts to reevaluate racial
aspects of modern society. He believes that affirmative action is
worthwhileand has been generally
beneficial to the African-American

community, but that it hasn't been
wholly effective because it also
serves to benefit advantaged African-Americans.
"Inequality lingers even after the
barriers come down," Wilson said in
a 1997 speech at the University of
California-Davis. "Eliminating racial barriers is not enough."
"Wilson discusses theoreticaland
practical concepts that interlock
with many professed ideals of the
majority of the Swarthmore community," said Swarthmore political
science professor James Kurth. "It
shquld really be interesting."
Among other things, Wilson has
sought to address incorrect stereotypes. An example of this would be
his research that found that the
black urban poor did not lack ambition, butrather a mechanism to help
them escape their present situation.
William Julius Wilson is theLewis
P. and Linda L. Geyser University
Professor at Harvard University,
where he teaches in the Department
of Afro-American studies and at the
John F. Kennedy School of Government. Wilson has served as a consultant to the White House on race
relations and has been the recipient
of the prestigious National Medal of
Science.

'House on Haunted Hill' fails to inspire fear

I exited a theater feeling as completely unfulfilled as I did on Friday night. Leaving
Marple after blowing an hour and 55 minutes trying to
keep my eyes on the screen, trying to care whether or
not all the undeveloped, contrived characters of "House
on Haunted Hill" met their gruesome demise, I felt sick
and completely let down.
The worst part is, when I checked the box office
charts, there it sat in the top slot, which says more about
cinema commercialization, skillfully timedrelease and
the various factors determining audience attraction than
it does about the actual quality of the film.
I wanted to see "House on Haunted Hill" not because
I thought its content would be particularly enlightening, or evenrewarding. I was, like so manyother American moviegoers, lured by the conveniently timed release,
wanting to see a scary show. Unfortunately, the movie
didn't provide the fright I expected. I wasn't scared, I
wasn't held in suspense. I was bored and sick to death of

Dear SHC,
I heard that since I'm on the pill, there are methods by which I can delay my period when I know I'm
going to get it at an "inconvenient" time. Is this true?
Is it safe?
Sincerely,

Cycle in Question
Dear Cycle,
If you're on the pill, you can delay your period in
one of two ways:
1. Rather than taking the placebo tablets (these are
the pills that have nothing in them that you take when
you have your period), just continue on to the next
pack of actual birth control pills. In other words, you
will actually not take the placebos and skip your period for a month.
2. Alternatively, you can also go to Worth, get a few
extra pills, and simply delay taking the placebos. Depending on how many extra pills you get, you thereby
delay your period for a couple of days to a week, and
then take the placebos.
According to Worth Health Center directorLinda
Echols, in terms of both risk for you to get pregnant
and just general risk for you, it is okay to use the pill
like this. However, you should NOT try to make your
period come early by taking your placebos early,
particularly if you're having intercourse. If you do
this, there will be a window in which you are at risk
for getting pregnant.
Also, while delaying your period in this fashion is
safe, you only want to do it occasionally. You DO NOT
want to delay your period for durations as long as 34 months. If you do this, you will have break-through
bleeding. Therefore, after doing this once, I recommend resuming a normal cycle so that you get your

gruesome images posing as fear.
The film begins by briefly touching on the lives of the
Prices, an eccentric, wealthy couple whose relationship
is at once sadomasochistic and saccharine, and surprisingly similar to the famous Addams duo. Steven Price,
played by Geoffrey Rush, is a big-shot thrill creator. He
is responsible for a number of worldwide theme parks,
and all of his work deals with excitement, fear and mass
quantities of heart-pumping, head-pounding adrenaline.
When his wife suggests that he throw her a birthday
party in a revamped asylum rumored to be haunted by
ghosts of tortured patients killed in an unexplained fire,
Price is delighted. He eagerly schemes, planning the
festivities and inviting five random people to partake in
the night o' fright. As an incentive for attending the bash,
Price offers one million dollars each to those who make
it through the night. Just a bit of harmless fun, right?
That's whatPrice thinks. He makes a wonderful, though

"Instead" from the outset of your period, the blood
will not be exposed to air until you remove it. A similar re-usable device, called "The Keeper," is also

BETWEEN THE SHEETS

Attorney Harvey Dent joining
to put an end to Gotham City's unforces
touchable crime lord, Carmine "The Ro-

man" Falcone, and his reign of terror in
the city. Their attention, though, is quickly
diverted to Holiday, a serial killer who targets members ofThe Roman's family, murdering his victims on holidays throughout
the calendaryear. "TLH" takes place over
the course of thirteen months, beginning
with Holiday's first kill on Halloween.
The good: Writer Jeph Loeb does an
intense character study of Wayne, Gordon, and Dent. These are three men who
believe in Gotham City, and throughout
"TLH," the reader sees how their dedication to the city drives their professional
and personal lives and dictates the
choices they make.
The "Mother's Day" and "Father's Day"
stories probe the guilt and sorrow Wayne
carries with him daily about his parents'
deaths. I have seen few Batman stories
that delve into his inner turmoil as well
as Loeb does in "TLH."
Loeb's exploration of Harvey Dent, who
ultimately becomes the criminal Two
Face, is fascinating; his history is underplayed in previous Batman stories. Dent's
obsessions are given center stage, which
helps explain why he ultimately adopts
his alter ego and a life of crime.
The bad: Some might say that Tim
Sale's artwork in "TLH" is perfectly ap-

propriate for this noir tale; I would describe his art as raw. I feel like it's unfinished and not always clear. It works
for the story, but it also keeps "TLH"
from being the stellar comic book that it
could be.
Also, the story isn't necessarily original. It's "The Godfather" plus some
Hannibal Lecter plus your typical
Batman fare (lunatics and the Big Bad
Bat), all of which has been done before.
The verdict: Read this story. The original thirteen separate comic books have
been collected into one book, now available in paperback, making it much easier
on the wallet. I bought the hard cover
version over the summer. I read it with
my brother, who usually thinks Batman
books are dumb. He loved it. I think the
mob stuff drew him in. But honestly, if
you like the idea of Batman's character,
as I do, or if you liked the original Batman
movie (before Schumacher screwed
things up), and if you want an ending that
will mess with your mind, then put this
book on your wish list.
Last note: Loeb and Sale have just
started another 13-monthproject, "Dark
Victory," which isn't a sequel to "TLH,"
but more like another chapter (like how
the different Indiana Jones movies work).

The first book just came out, so you could
start reading now and experience the
story one month at a time, which is probably the best way to do it.

twisted, host for the strangers, until the house takes over.
Apparently this house, which is at times remarkably wellkept and modernized yet astoundingly filthy and dilapidated at others, is alive. It has a mind, or a spirit, of its
own, and it's got a bone to pick with its inhabitants.
So, the house decides to run the show and the whole
movie falls to pieces from there. The plot is increasingly implausible as the movie and the house's power
progress. The character sketches lie in shambles, since
the characters are dropping deadall over the place and
those still living are repulsively phony.
All this might have been tolerable had the movie actually been scary. If my blood had run cold in my veins,
if I'd leapt from my seat with surprise, or if I'd only had
the urge to scream I might have been able to brush the
rest aside. But it didn't manage that much.
"House on Haunted Hill" is without any redeeming
value. Perhaps that's a brash statement, but it's true. I
could argue this one against anyone. This movie topped
the charts simply because it was released in the midst
of all the Halloween hype.

reason not to bag their messed-up marriage. Not quite the sap story of"Random
Hearts," this love flick approaches the more realistic, frighteningly common issue of a love
that's lost its spark.

A happily unmarried man plodding along in life, letting things take their course, meets The
One and decides to pop the question but botches it. When an inheritance comes into
play, he's forced to choose between the woman he loves and a hefty reward. Full of
hilarious mishaps and a quirky new take on relationships, this should be a decent comedy.

"The Bone Collector"
R- 118 minutes.
Starring Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, and Queen
Latifah.

7:30, 10:20

Judging strictly by cast, even if this story sucks, at least it'll be acted well. This thriller
details the scheming of a serial killer, his crafty attempts to evade capture, and the sheer
brilliance ofAmerican forensics in action. The intensity and fast pace of this show should
make it worth your while.

"American Beauty"
R. 118 minutes.
Starring Kevin Spacey,Annette Bening andThera Birch.

7:50,10:30

One of this year's most critically acclaimed films,"American Beauty" shines a spotlight on
suburbia through a rich structure, intense drama and high-quality acting. Spacey and
Bening give excellent performances that evoke a high emotional response.

"Double Jeopardy"
R. 106 minutes.
Starring Ashley Judd.Tommy Lee
Greenwood.

7:40, 10:05

Called 'cliched' in its plot,"Double jeopardy" still managed to drag in a quite sizeable
audience to become one of the year's most profitable films."Fugitive" with a feminine
twist, the movie follows Ashley judd's gripping revenge on her conniving husband.

7:20,10:45

One hundred fifty-five minutes is an awful lot of time to dedicate to the story of a top
news reporter trying to coerce an ex-tobacco producer into revealing the tricks of the
trade. I'm interested in the logistics of plot development of it, but I don't know that I'm
intrigued enough to devote that much time to a film that sounds slightly less than riveting.

An blackly hilarious attack on galloping bureaucracy, audaciously mixing slapstick farce

A thriller narrating the pathetic life of a man controlled by secular society who latches on

NBA offseason shakeups make Blazers team to beat
Basketball balance of power shifts to Western
Conference with migration of star players
By Ben Keys and Matt Murphy
For The Phoenix
By trading for Scottie Pippen, Detlef
Schrempf and Steve Smith, the Portland
Trailblazers have put together the most
potent lineup in the NBA this season.
These are not the Blazers you fondly reClyde
member from fourth grade
Drexler, Terry Porter and Kevin
Duckworth are nowhere to be found.
The current Blazers complement their
veteran acquisitions with raw young talent like Bonzi Wells and Jermaine
O'Neal. If Pippen can take a leadership
role, one which he lacked last season in
Houston, and if coach Mike Dunleavy
can use his talentedbench to the fullest,
the Blazers are shoo-ins for the championship.
The balance of power in the NBA has
definitely shifted to the Western Conference. The Blazers, San Antonio Spurs,

THE PICKS

Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers are
all stronger teams than any of the teams
out east. San Antonio looks to defend
theirtitle with more boring half-court offense, which will be even duller with
Sean Elliot out for the season after a kidney transplant.
And is it just us, or have the Utah Jazz
had the same lineup forever? With an average league experience of 13 years for
their starters, this team is not getting any
younger. It is now or never for Karl
Malone and Company place your bets
on ‘never.’
Los Angeles has high expectations for
new coach Phil Jackson. If Jackson can
prove that the triangle offense can be
—

successfully run by someone other than
Michael Jordan, the Lakers will challenge Portland for the Western Conference title.
Which brings us to the lowly Eastern
Conference. After so many dominant
years of the Detroit Pistons and Chicago
Bulls, the East has fallen on hard times
and lost many of their marquee players
to the West.
The Miami Heat is the safe bet to make
the finals. After a disappointing loss in
the first round of the playoffs last season, slimy Pat Riley brings back his identical lineup to make another run. Undoubtedly, Riley will find a way to use
the new league rules (no touching on defense, basically) in his favor.
Other teams battling the Heat for the
top spot will be the Charlotte Hornets,
the New York Knicks and the Indiana
Pacers. The Hornets are the most volatile team of the bunch, with an exciting
backcourt of Eddie Jones and superrookie Baron Davis, but the off-court
problems of Derrick Coleman may
hinder Charlotte's success.
The Knicks will benefit from the new

rules; Latrell Sprewell will be absolutely

unstoppable, and if Patrick Ewing gets
out of the way, New York might make
the finals again.
Conversely, the Pacers, and specifically Mark Jackson, will be hurt by the
new rules. Additionally, Larry Bird has
announced that this is going to be his last
season coaching the Pacers. Do not expect to see inspired basketball from a
team that lost its best rebounder and defender, Antonio Davis.
Around the rest of the league, the new
rules should encourage scoring and
hopefully make for some exciting play.
Point guards Allen Iverson, Stephon
Marbury and Jason Kidd will all benefit
from the new rules and likely earn each
of their respective team's playoff bids.
The freshman seasons for top rookies
Lamar Odom, Corey Maggette and Elton
Brand will not be pleasant ones. Their
teams will be, ahem, rebuilding this year.
as anSuch is the life in the NBA
other new season dawns, we can expect
veteran teams to make title runs while
inexperienced teams jockey for position
in next year's draft.

Cross country team takes third place in conference
Agunloye captures
conference title,

named Centennial
Runner of the Year
By Mike Evans, Josh Bloom,
and Joe Makin
For The Phoenix
Last Saturday, as the Swarthmore harriers tracked across the
glistening, green fields of
Gettysburg, they could not help
but remember that they were
running over hallowed ground.
Perhaps it was the chance to run
on this once-in-a-lifetime course,
over sacred and blood-soaked
fields that inspired the men's and
women's cross country teams to
unforgettable races. Whatever
the cause, be it divine inspiration
or ancestral awakenings, the
teams did not disappoint, but
rather offered up the eternal
sacrifices of hard-work, determination, and pride to the spirits watching them race. The result was the highest ever Swarthmore men's finish in the Centennial Conference, both individually and for the team. The
women's team witnessed several

breakthrough races, including
the first overall Centennial Conference Champion in Swarthmore history.
Joko Agunloye 'Ol continued
to build on her unbelievable season with a first place crown and
a new school record of 18:41.67,
breaking the one she set last year
by 1.5 seconds. By racing the 5K
smart, tough, and with an iron
will, Agunloye overcame a significant deficit to Western
Maryland's Jill Krebs, who lead
early in the race. Swarthmore's
eventual champion remained
calm throughout the race, however, and gradually pulled even
with Krebs. After catching up,
there was no stopping as
Agunloye pushed past the Western Maryland runner with less
than 200 meters to run en route
to her victory. Exciting it was;
incredible it was; and damn sexy
it was. Agunloye's first-place
finish earned her the Centennial
Conference Runner of the Year
award.
Others on the women's team
also had similarly sexy results.

Garnet Tide loses narrowly to Franklin
Garnet Tide to face No. 7 ranked Western
Maryland Saturday for Senior Day
By

Justin Kane

Phoenix Staff

What
was
perhaps
Swarthmore's best chance for
another victory this year slipped
through the team's hands last
Saturday as the GarnetTide fell
to Franklin & Marshall 17-15.
In a battle of Centennial Conference cellar dwellers, F&M's
17-6 first-half lead proved insurmountable for Swarthmore,
even though the GarnetTide defense held F&M to a paltry 38
yards in the second half.
The game opened inauspiciously, with F&M quarterback
Mark Rowand connecting with
Justin Salton for a 64-yard touchdown on the first play from
scrimmage. From that point on,
Swarthmore was forced to play
catch-up. Unfortunately, there
simply wasn't enough time in the
game for the Garnet Tide.
With running back Ken Clark
'O3 struggling to find running
room in the first half, the Garnet Tide took to the air, and quar-

"It's heartbreaking to be
this close and not win,"
Charlie Ellis
terback Scott Murray 'Ol hooked
up with wide receiver Keith
McManimen 'O2 for a 12-yard
touchdown. For the rest of the
half, however, Swarthmore was
unable to muster another significant drive.
The second half was a different story.
"We made some adjustments
at halftimeand just came out and
turned up the intensity," said
Clark.
The increased intensity
yielded a seven-minute opening
drive, capped by a Rob
Castellucci 'Ol field goal. On defense the Garnet Tide held the
Diplomats offense to three consecutive three-and-out series.
As the third quarter wound
down, Swarthmore embarked on
a 16-play, 88-yard drive, which
ended in the fourth quarter with

Murray sneaking into the end
zone from one yard out. It was
to be the last score for Swarth-

more, though. A final drive

ended with one minute left on an
unsuccessful 4th-and-21 conversion attempt.
"It's heartbreaking to be this
close and not win," said tight end
Charlie Ellis 'OO.
The team attributedthe loss to
sloppy execution for most of the
game.
"We made too many mistakes,"
Ellis said. "We still don't have that
winning mental attitude."
Clark agreed.
"We came out flat in the first
half," Clark said, "but when we
picked it up, we didn't quite
know how to win."
The Garnet Tide gets another
chance at victory this Saturday
at Senior Day against Western
Maryland at Clothier Fields at 1
p.m. The Green Terror is ranked
No. 7 in the nation in Div. 11l football and brings an 8-0 record to
the contest, but Swarthmore still
has high hopes for the game.
"Anything can happen," Clark
said. "We're going into the game
with a nothing-to-lose attitude."
Attitude won't be all Swarthmore will need. Western Mary-

It is Thursday night and an eclectic
group of Swarthmore students bearing
large sticks anxiously wait by the Rose
Garden. A van pulls up and the sound of
"Puckers" comes out of the darkness. The
grouprushes toward the vehicle and the
for the car seats. Elbows

fly leftand right, with apologies scattered
here and there.
The van pulls away with 30 Swarthmore
students safely tucked inside, behind a
semi-shut door. Arriving at the ice rink,
the door opens and the Swatties storm the
rink, weapons in hand, ready to claim
their turf. And so begins the weeklyphenomenon known as Motherpuckers.
Motherpuckers, the second largest student-run organization on campus after the
Ballroom and Swing Club, boasts a weekly
attendance of 30 to 40 participants. Some
are the regulars, some only occasional
players, but all come for a lively and entertaining night ofice skating and hockey.
helmets
No equipment is necessary
and sticks are provided by the college.
And experience...well, that is irrelevant.
What is important is a good sense of humor.
Based on previous experience (or lack
thereof), players are divided into the
three basic skill levels: A for advanced,
who are the participants showing off how
it is done, B for beginners or the people
who think they know how it is done, and
C for comedy, as in those who provide the
entertainment of the evening.
Even if playing hockey does not appeal
to you, it is worth the trip just to watch
the C-line in action, although the B-line
has their humorous moments as well. The
C-line collisions and near misses are a
frequent occurrence as they struggle to
learn the basics of skating. The B-liners,
having mastered some skating skills, still
need to learn how to stop before hitting
the boards.
Imagine the wind in your face (once you
can move fast enough to actually feel the
wind). The sounds ofyour skateblade cutting into the ice. The clear sound of the
snap ofyour stick as you execute the perfectpass cleanly. The intense satisfaction
of scoring your first goal. Come to
Motherpuckers to experience it all, including the numb toes and bruised knees.

wins, which is better than they have
managed in the previous three years.
Although theirrecord of 7-12 overall
and 2-8 in Centennial Conference play
is not as good as they had hoped, the
successes of this season are indicative
of a strong future.
Two of the last three games were
especially frustrating for the Garnet.
On Oct. 23, the team hosted Gettysburg
and fell 6-0. It was a tough game for
Swarthmore, but they did not lose
heart.
The last scheduled game of the season was against Haverford. This was
also a difficult match for the Garnet
women. Traditionally, this is the most
physically challenging game of the
year, and the charged attitudes in the
stands increase the amount of pressure on the players. Haverford played
well, but the Swarthmore women performed up to par, keeping the score
2-0 in the first half. The Garnet allowed just one more goal in the second half and scored one themselves,
but the team finished with a hardfought 3-1 loss. In spite of the score,
the Garnet women exhibited tremendous effort and enthusiasm on the
field and throughout the game. The
efforts were highlighted by the performance of seniors Annalise Paaby
'OO, Nia Wright 'OO, Becca Schmidt 'OO,
and Emily Manetta 'OO. Heather
Marandola 'Ol, Karly Ford 'O3, Claire
Hoverman 'O3, and Lizzy Pike 'O3 demonstrated equally strong performances. As always, the group of Sarah Jay 'Ol, Liz Brainard 'O3, E.B.
Fortier 'O3, and Marah Gotcsik 'O2
continued to impress and support the
team with their tireless runs up and
down, often sprinting the entire length
of the field. The loss was a disappointment, but Swarthmore's level of" play
was probably at its best this season.
With a rescheduled game that had
been rained out earlier in the season,
the Garnet women had the opportunity
to end the season on a positive note.
They did just that by beating Bryn
Mawr in the final game of the season
with an exciting 2-1 victory. The goals
were knocked in by Fortier and
Marandola, with Schmitt assisting on
both goals.
Despite the loss of graduating seniorsKate Doty, Wright, Paaby, Lotus

positive outlook for next year. The seniors provided a strong force on the field
this season, but the team is still young,
with a nine-player freshman squad. Additionally, Coach Amy Brunner has put
forth a large effort to generate interest
in Swarthmore among soccer players
from around the country. This season,
the team faced the challenge of many
young faces and a new coach. Next year,
the Garnet women look forward to a
squad with more experience and unity.
There is a positive sentiment among the
players regarding the 2000 season and

victory over

this year's experiences will certainly
serve as a crucial starting point for
improvement. Pike put it best by saying, "Throughout the season, we have
won some, we have lost some. What
we've discovered is that, along the
way, we've become a family. There is
definitely something tangible that we
hope will translate next year." Itis this
sentiment that echoes throughout the
team and will showthe rest of the conference soon enough that Swarthmore
is a team to be watched in the seasons
to come.

Women's rugby team demolishes Lafayette
UPenn next matchupforfemale ruggers
By Rhiana Swartz
For The Phoenix
Those at Dupont field witnessed a beautiful Swarthmore
victory on Saturday. After three full weeks without a game,
the women’s rugby team came back in full force in their contest against Lafayette College.
“We definitely had something to prove,” commented Payal
Shah ’03. Swarthmore did just that: the final score of the Aside game was 34-0. The B-side, a crew composed almost entirely of rookies, played the majority of Lafayette’s A-side and
lost 15-0.
Swarthmore’s success was largely due to the great teamworkofall the players. Defensively, the team worked together
to keep Lafayette frustrated and offensively Swarthmore’s
forwards and backs supported each other. The results of this
was a six-try shut-out.
Co-captain Rhiana Swartz ’00 explained, “When you love
your team, you don’t want to see them crushed, so you run
your butt off and you get there and get the job done.”
The job sure did get doneand every player on the field contributed. Swarthmore’s scoring rampage was started by center Katie Harper ’02 off a beautiful back line passing sequence.
Not to be outdone, forwards Alexa Miller ‘00 and Swartz used
all their might to get the ball into the try-zone and touched
down for another 5 points. Abigail Stewart-Tietelbaum ‘01 was
the next to get a try, again after some back magic. Harper and
Stewart-Tietelbaum attained Zulu Warrior status with their

first tries.
The second half was muchlike the first, with Swarthmore dominating in all aspects of the game. Meredith Hegg 'OO scored her
first try of the day off a big forward push into the end zone. Then
Emily Wilkins 'Ol used her blinding speed to blow past nearly
the entire Lafayette team to achieve a beautiful put-down. The
last try of the day was a masterful breakaway by Hegg. Swartz
kicked two conversions to give Swarthmore an additional four
points.
The presence of high-flying Maya Peterson 'O2 was felt as Swat
completely dominated line-outs. Meanwhile, in scrums, rookie
Taina Guarda 'O2 hooked like a veteran. Defensively, Emily
Sigalow 'O2 and Adrienne Fowler 'O3 kept Lafayette at bay, tackling with aggression.
The B-side game ended in a loss, but this was largely due to
the fact that Swarthmore was forced to play against the tired
but very experienced Lafayette A-side. In fact, Lafayette's captain was responsible forall three tries against Swarthmore. Nonetheless, the B-side showedreal promise in their outing. Michelle
McKeithan 'OO demonstratedher amazing tackling ability, while
Fabienne Tepper 'O2 and Kate Fama 'Ol showed the fans what
natural second rows are capable of doing. Other standouts included flankers Vanessa Agosto 'Ol and Vanessa Knoedler 'Ol.
Esther Kim 'O3 had a great game offensively, as did Vanessa Askot
'O3.
It's your last chance to experience the spectacle that is a Swarthmore women's rugby game. The team will face No. 1 rival
University of Pennsylvania this Saturday at 11 a.m. on Dupont
Field. To get there, head to Chemistry 10 and make a right. Fans
are invited to the post-game BBQ that is not to be missed.
