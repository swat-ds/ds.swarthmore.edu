Classes held; King honored?
By David King
Phoenix Staff

NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN | Phoenix Staff

While much of the country celebrated the 72nd
anniversary of Dr. MartinLuther King, Jr.'s birthday this past Monday, Swarthmore, as it does every year, held classes. Although King's celebrated
birthday is a federal holiday during which government offices and regular postal service shut down,
the college was open for business, as it is on every
major holiday except Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Holding classes on the slain civil rights leader's
birthday was not an active decision by the college,
according to president Al Bloom. Rather, he said,
the decision stems from historic precedent and is
confirmed at periodic intervals by the College Planning Committee.
Bloom also pointed out that the college does not
observe most national holidays, though he could
not provide a specific reason why.
"The college places very special value on Martin Luther King Day, because of the commitment
to an inclusive and human world that that day expresses," said Bloom. He noted that the college
offered other activities outside of class to commemorate the day.
The first such event was a Martin Luther King
Day of Service. Organized by the Unity Center, a
non-profit corporation, the Day of Service saw
Swarthmore students travel to Chester on Monday
morning to join more than 200 other volunteers
from Delaware County in cleaning up the Chester
area of Buckman Village.
In the evening, a commemoration took place in
the Lang Performing Arts Center, followed by a
candlelight vigil.
On Tuesday evening, Burt Siegel, Executive Director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Philadelphia, gave a talk on blackJewish relations in theBlack Cultural Center. Yes-

ings about the holiday.
Poe read his poem "My Big
Brother," a poem about the creative connection between a
younger boy and his role model.
It was inspired by the influence
of "the older male." Poe said he
read that particular poem because he considers King one of
his role models.
The formal presentations were
followed by an open mike session
in which the audience members
were invited to express their
feelings about the holiday. People
spoke about personal experiences they associate withMartin
Luther King's ideals. Afterward,
the master of ceremonies read
Dr. King's eulogy.
The event finished with a

Parrish Parlors, where participants and audience members attended a small reception.

Survey: Swatties overestimate

Effect most noticeable among Class of 2002; declines with age

Folk singer Dar Williams may be performing at Swarthmore this

Dar Williams proposal
selected by committee
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff

The large event committee,
established last semester to
bring well-known entertainers to
campus, has chosen to invite
singer Dar Williams to perform
on campus.
The proposal recommending
Williams, written by Amber
Adamson 'Ol and Matthew
Landreman 'O2, was selected
from all of the submissions because of its feasibility.
As Dean of the College and
committee member Bob Gross
said, "It was the right scale. Dar
Williams is the kind of act
Swarthmore can mount." Other
proposals called for more money
than the committee is willing to
spend and greater production
capabilities than are available in
any venue on campus.
Both Adamson and Landreman
independently contacted Williams' booking agent when they
heard of the opportunity afforded by the large event committee. After discovering this
coincidence, they combined efforts and wrote the proposal together.
Landreman explained that he
chose Williams because "she is
an artist I like." Also important
to his choice was that "she seems
to fit what the committee is look-

ing for." Despite this apparent
match between Williams and the
committee's goals, the news of
the
decision
surprised
Landreman, who had not expected that his and Adamson's
proposal would be chosen.
"I thought it would be fun to
try," he said. He saw this proposal as an opportunity to take
advantage of the resources available at Swarthmore and is
pleased with the result.
Gross, too, is satisfied with the
new committee's initial effort.
The committee was formed last
semester, Gross explained, in reaction to the "sense of desperation and improvisation that went
on last year with the George
Clinton effort."
The college responded by dedicating $lO,OOO-$15,000 purely for
entertainment chosen through
student initiative. The monetary
figure resulted from a desire to
maintain Swarthmore's tradition
of not charging admission to
campus events.
"We don't want to start charging," Gross said, "or spend
$40,000, an assistant professor's
salary, in one night."
The arrangements have yet to
be finalized with the booking
agent, but if all goes as planned,
Williams will perform Feb. 11 in
the Lang Performing Arts Center.

A survey taken last year shows
Swarthmore students have an
inaccurate perception of others'
alcohol use.
The survey, to which 60 percent of the students on campus
in the spring 1999 semester responded, found that students believed others to be drinking more
than themselves. The effect was
most pronounced in the freshman class of 2002. The data for
the sophomore and junior classes
that semester showed the trend
to a lesser degree, while in the
senior class the difference between perception and reality was
only slight.
The survey asked students to
estimate their own yearly consumption of alcohol, as well as
that of an "average" student. Students of all ages overestimated
what their peers were drinking.
In the freshman class, the
mean number of times per year
students reported drinking alcohol was 14.1, while the mean estimate ofhow much others drank
was 32.7 times per year
over
twice as much as their peers
were actually drinking, according to the survey.
The average number of times
sophomores consumed alcohol
was 25.3 each year, according to
the survey, while sophomores
estimated that others drank 32.7
times per year. Juniors reportedly hadalcohol 25.2 times, while
they estimated that others did so
33.4 times. Among seniors, however, perception almost matched
reality as alcohol consumption
reached an average of 30.6 times
per year while seniors believed

“Social norms are based
on perceptions, so it is
important for students to
be aware of the large
number of non-drinkers
and moderate drinkers.”
Bob Gross
others to be drinking about 32.5
times.
Rena Cheskis-Gold, an institutional research professional
hired by the college to analyze
the survey, presented its results
to Swarthmore administrators
and a Phoenix reporter on Dec.
14. She said that the data showed
that students’ accuracy in assessing the amount of alcohol consumption on campus improves as
they age. That effect is due almost exclusively to the fact that
drinking actually increases dramatically between freshman
and senior year, since estimates
of others’ drinking are virtually
the same among all classes.
The survey also reported that
a significant number of students
do not drink at all. Thirty percent
of freshmen said that at the time
of the survey they had not had
alcohol in the last year, while 43
percent said they had none in the
last 30 days. Among sophomores
and juniors, 16 percent of students had not drunk in the last
year, while 35 percent of sophomores and 30 percent of juniors
had not in the last 30 days. Seniors again reported the most
consumption, with only 11 percent not consuming any in the
last year and 22 percent report-

ing no drinking in the last 30
days.
"The Swarthmore data reflect
national findings," said Dean of
the College Bob Gross. "Students, both .drinkers and nondrinkers, overestimate drinking
by others. 'Social norms are based
on perceptions, so it is important
for students to be aware of the
large number of non-drinkers
and moderate drinkers."
Cheskis-Gold said she believed
the data were accurate, because
in her experience with similar
surveys in the past students usually accurately reported their
own alcohol consumption rather
than intentionally underestimating it on the survey form.
The survey also addressed a
host of other areas of campus
life, mainly student satisfaction
in many areas. On a scale of 1 to
4, students rated faculty accessibility a 3.7. Academic experience, class size and general experience all received mean
scores of 3.4. Most other programs rated at or slightly above
a 3.0. A notable exception was financial aid, which received a
score of 2.7, and students rated
their financial aid packages even
lower, at 2.6. Athletic programs
and dining services both received mean scores of 2.6, while
student governance rated a 2.5
and athletic facilities the worst
score of all, at 2.3.
The survey also included data
comparing Swarthmore to other
member schools in the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, such as Amherst, Williams, and Bryn Mawr. COFHE
regulations prohibit reporting on
comparative data in student
newspapers.

Last year's
student survey
posed these two
questions about
alcohol use on
campus.
Students were
asked to
estimate the
number of times
they drank per
year, as well as
the number of
times they
believed the

"average"
student drank
per year.The
results are

presented as
averages by
student year.

Tuition decision not yet made

BRENDAN KARCH | Phoenix Staff

New sound-deadening panels are visible in the rafters of the Sharpies big room, where they have cut the
noise level.The dining hall has also received additional lighting and an as-yet incomplete employee lounge.

Sharples serves better ambience
By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff
Students returning to Sharpies after a long
month of off-campus dining were greeted this
week with several improvements to the venerable dining hall. New lighting illuminates the
previously gloomy interior of Sharpies, while
acoustically absorpbent panels hanging from the
ceiling of the big room significantly lessen noise
there. An unrelated but concurrent change is
the addition of an employee lounge on the top
floor of Sharpies near the elevator.
Both the lighting and the sound panels were
recommendations raised by Jared Solomon on
behalf of Student Council. Students had complained for a long time about the dim lighting in
Sharpies, especially in the winter when dinner
is eaten entirely in the dark. The noise problems inherent in a striking, stone-lined dining
hall had not gone unnoticed, either.
Larry Schall, vice president of facilities, hired
a design group for the lighting. The Lighting
Practice in Philadelphia worked with Schall and
others to outline a plan. They installed the first
additional lights during finals week and added
several more over winter vacation, but accordmg to Schall they are "only part of the plan which
will be implemented over a couple years."
Students have already given Sharpies employes positive feedback about the lighting, which
consists of a combination of bright spotlights
both mounted high and hung low. They provide
a supplement to the dim illumination given by
the old lighting fixtures, which resemble picwagon wheels. Reviews are mixed:
Extra light was necessary but they didn't have
to bring out the operating table bright lights,"
said Mariana Pardes 'OO.
According to Professor Carr Everbach of the
Engineering Department, who specializes in
ac oustics and oversaw the noise reduction
"complaints about the poor acoustics
students had occurred for decades." Still,
from
there was little response to the concerns until
Borough of Swarthmore decided to use the
jher ge
Room (also known as the Big Room) in
harpies for a NewYear's Eve 2000 Celebration.
Last May, concerns about the intelligibility of
speeches given in that location prompted PresiAl Bloom to contact Professor Everbach
j °r a possible solution. With the help ofLily Yang
"!»Everbach made many acoustical measurements, considered the best solution, and began

aresque

dent

calculating the cost. Professor Randall Exon of
the Art Department advised the two on the most
harmonious placement of the sound absorption
panels, and Jim Keller, an architect with the
Vitetta Group in Philadelphia, offered pro bono
advice on panel construction.
Installation of the panels, which arrived in
mid-October, was slowed by aesthetic considerations. Schall worried that they would be ugly
and might block light. He suggested painting
the edges of the panels brown to be less obtrusive. The suggestion implemented, Physical
Plant workers installed them in the middle of
December under the direction of Bill McGuire.
In a series of late-night tests, Everbach fired a
starter's pistol in the Big Room and recorded
the decibel decay on a digital oscilloscope, analyzing graphs to find the reverberation time.
In a letter to President Bloom, Everbach wrote
that "the reverberation time (the time a sound
takes to decay sixty decibels) has been more
than cut in half, from almost four seconds to well
under two." The difference is immediately apparent: "The new panels enable dinner conversation at a much more civilized decibel level,"
raved Benjamin Hanani 'OO, who adds that
"somewhere we spend so much time is deserving of attention." He estimates that many students spend at least 14 hours a week in Sharpies.
The new panels reduce noise by "absorbing
sound waves hitting them so that the waves don't
bounce off but are turned into heat in the panels," says Everbach. The 118 panels (of which
only 96 are up so far) were made by Panel Solutions, Inc. Of Hazleton, Pa., and cost $15,000.
Everbach hopes to someday cover the large
stone wall that stillreflects noise, but until something more beautiful than the stonework is donated, the wall will remain bare.
The employee lounge under construction is a
gift from the class of 1999, whose officers "really wanted to do something nice for the dining
service employees," said Linda McDougall, director of dining services. It still needs to be
painted and carpeted, but it should be ready for
use in the next few weeks. It will have a television, a computer and seating. Employees will
have access to the computer, including e-mail
and Internet use. McDougall hopes that "employees who never had computer access will
learn to use the computer and enjoy it." The
lounge will be open during break times or whenever an employee who is taking classes needs it
to use the computer or study.

On Jan. 5, 2000, an article appeared in The New York Times
stating that Williams College is
not planning to increase its costs
for the academic year 2000-2001.
The article explains that Williams is "the first highly selective
institution to do so in decades."
Williams administrators justify
their decision with low inflation
cycle and with the increase of endowment and contributions from
alumni.
Although in past years Swarthmore has always increased its
costs, therates of increase of tuition have been decreasing. For
example, the increase in student
fees for the academic year 19992000 was 3.1 percent.
The decision about the costs
for next year has not yet been
made, clarified Swarthmore
Treasurer Sue Welsh. The College Budget Committee started
a series of meetings about the
fees on Wednesday, Jan. 19. The

final decision will be taken at the
end of February.
Welsh explained that Swarthmore has "experienced good investment returns in recent
years due to the very favorable
stock market." This, however,
has led to increases in endowment spending. Most of the endowed money hasbeen directed
to maintenance and compensation for faculty and staff. The
biggest portion of endowment
spending has been directed to
improving and enlarging the financial aid program. That is
why tuition is still increased at
Swarthmore. Rather than go toward tuition, endowed money is
directed to support financial
aid. This is essential for Swarthmore to keep up with its "generous financial aid policy of
meeting the need of all admitted students," explained Welsh.

Five new members on council
At the end of the fall semester,
students elected five new members to Student Council and reelected another.
Brandon Silverman 'O2 was reelected to the College Planning
Committee representative position. Will Ortman 'O2 replaced
Amber Adamson 'Ol as facilities
and space coordinator; Jennifer
Pao 'Ol took over the appointments chair position previously
held by Kwabena Adu 'Ol. Neil C.
Cavanaugh 'O3 will replace
Rodney Morris 'Ol as outreach
chair, and Tony Hillery 'Ol will
take the seat of former charter
chair and two-semester co-chair
JaredSolomon 'Ol, who is abroad.
Dave Choe 'Ol was elected to fill
the position of treasurer, which
hadremained vacant during much
of the fall semester due to the resignation of Maureen Vernon 'Ol.
Jordan Brackett 'Ol, the
council's secretary; Louisa
Whitfield-Smith 'O2, Council on
Educational Policy representative; Nick Attanasio 'OO, College
Planning Committee representative; Michael Spiegel 'O3, Curriculum Committee representative; Marvin Barron 'O2, budget
committee representative; and
Matt Schwartz 'Ol, Board ofManagers observer and fall semester
co-chair, will remain on the council until their terms expire at the
end of the spring semester.
The council elected Silverman
and Brackett as co-chairs for the
semester.

Silverman said that the council will discuss a broad agenda
for the semester at a retreat this

“Jared and

Matt did a
great job making Student
Council more legitimate.”
Jordan Brackett
weekend but noted that one issue
on the agenda would be the
amending of the council’s constitution. The members of last
semester’s council discussedpotential changes but could not pass
or even formalize them before
the semester ended. Changes to
the council’s constitution require
a two-thirds vote of the council.
Silverman also said that he felt
the council should help to obtain
a new computer lab for the
Swarthmore College Computer
Society after the defeat last semester of the society’s proposal
for the use of Sharpies III in a
Student Council-sponsored election. Over the summer. Sharpies
III will be converted into improved student-reservable space
as well as a darkroom and art
gallery for the Student Art Association and Photo Club.
Brackett said that as co-chair,
he hopes to make the council
more of a body for organized
change on campus, and praised
the work to that end of last
semester’s co-chairs.
“Jared and Matt did a great job
making Student Council more
legitimate,” Brackett said.
The council will begin its
weekly meetings next week, although it has not yet set a date or
time.— Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman

Online competition prompts bookstore ad campaign
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
The online bookseller Varsitybooks.com
has begun advertising heavily at Swarthmore, sparking the College bookstore,
whichpreviously held a monopoly on sales
of books to students, to retaliate with a
campaign of its own.
The Varsitybooks.com advertising campaign is led by Dan Jacobs 'O3, a student
who was hired as a campus representative for the company late last semester.
Jacobs and the company's other two campus representatives have covered the
pavement and walls around Parrish with
chalkings and signs comparing the prices
of their employer to those of the college
bookstore.
The bookstore has retaliated with its
own comparisons: signs posted around the
store plot its prices against those of
as
well
as
Varsitybooks.com,
Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com, and
eFollett.com. In some cases, both the college bookstore and Varsitybooks.com
claim to offer the lowest prices.
The discrepancy comes from the
bookstore's use of used books in its comparisons. The Varsitybooks.com signs only
compare prices on new books, but the college bookstore signs show "the lowest
price, new or used" that each of the retailers offers. According to director Kathy
Grace, the bookstore offers more used
books than most of its online competitors.
Though online booksellers have been
around for several years, they have not
been well-advertised on campus until this
semester.

Grace said that the emergence of online
competition frustrates her attempts to
keep the bookstore small and communityoriented. "It's hard to combat this huge
advertising campaign by several online
presences here. The ads set us up as 'the
college bookstore people who are trying
to rip you off.'"
Jacobs, however, said that the
bookstore's prices are more expensive not
because its prices are inflated butbecause
its overhead costs are high compared to
those of companies like Varsitybooks.com,
which are relatively inexpensive to run.
Grace and Jacobs agree on one thing:
online booksellers can offer cheaper
prices on textbooks because publishers
charge the highest prices to those who
need the books most: colleges and universities.'
According to Grace, the bookstore discounts textbooks whenever it can. Subsidized by the College, the store does not
aim to turn a profit. Until five years ago,
it was losing money. It now breaks even.
The bookstore's staff hopes that by putting in overtime and providing good customer service, it can continue to do so. It

prices in the

has tradition on its side: even when faced
with the prospect of lower prices, many
students cling to old habits. Lashanna
Lawler 'O2 said she does not plan to buy
books online this semester. Of her bookstore purchases, she said, "I try to get here
early so I can get used books, but I shell
out money for new books if I have to."
Meanwhile, Jacobs said that he has gotten "good response" to the advertising
campaign. He predicts that ordering
books online will grow in popularity on
as
like
campus
companies
Varsitybooks.com tailor their stock orders
to Swarthmore's reading lists.
For now, it is too early to tell if the competition will have an effect on the
bookstore's sales. The online commercial
revolution has come to Swarthmore, however, and it may give the bookstore a run
for its money.

holiday varied. Some students
thought classes shouldhave been
suspended to commemorate the
day. One viewed the way the college treats King's birthday as
"trite and superficial."
A few, however, thought a
regular class day was justified.
They reasoned that they could
celebrate King's birthday outside
of class, that the college community commemorated the day in
other ways or that the school
should not make an exception for
this holiday if it does not close for
others.
One student remarked that
people would probably spend
Monday traveling, rather than
using it as a day of remembrance,
were they given the day off.
Soenda Howell 'Ol, president
of the Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Student Society
(SASS), said the college should
have allowed students to take the
day off. She also sees spending
time in class as a sort of service,
which, she explained, falls under
King's doctrine.
She, too, thought the college
should not make an exception
and celebrate King's birthday if
it overlooks other holidays.
The fact that the King holiday
falls on the first day of the semester would have made it hard for
students to plan activities for the
day, said Howell. As such, she
appreciated the college's having
planned events. (SASS did not
sponsor any activities.)

Like Howell, President Bloom
expressed the belief that students benefit from spending the
day learning in class. He noted,
however, that faculty had the
choice of taking the day off as
one their personal days, an option
they do not have for any other
holiday. (Students were not given
permission to miss classes.)
Haverford was the lone school
in the Tri-College community to
cancel Monday classes in honor
of King's birthday. According to
in
Emily
Shaw, intern
Haverford's Office of Cultural
Affairs, that school's Educational
Planning Committee (EPC) had
initially decided to make classes
optional for students. But at a
faculty meeting on Dec. 16, the
faculty body voted to cancel
classes altogether.
Shaw added that it remains to
be seen whether the decision to
officially observe the day will
stand for future years.
The Haverford faculty's proposal to suspend classes was bolstered by a petition from
Haverford students in support of
the idea, said Christina Zwarg,
Associate Professor of English at
Haverford.
"I honestly do not think that
our resolution wouldhave passed
without that show of support
from the students," she said.
While Haverford students did
not have to attend classes, the
school did hold events to celebrate King's birthday.
Paul Smith, Professor of History and chair of the EPC at
Haverford, said the college had
a collection Monday evening,
which included a "musical and
dramatic performance" and a
question and answer session with
faculty who participated in the
civil rights movement.

Films pertaining to the civil
rights movement were screened,
he said, and Eighth Dimension, a
student volunteer program at
Haverford, organized volunteer
activities in the immediate area
and in Philadelphia.
One Haverford student interviewed on Tuesday supported the
college's suspension of classes to
mark the day. Another, who had
spent Monday traveling to campus, thought the school should be
consistent in observing holidays.
"I think it's in the spirit of
Haverford to have canceled the
classes," remarked Kevin Gregory, a Haverford junior. He believed the other Tri-College
schools should have done the
same.

Bryn Mawr celebrated King's
birthday with several events
Sunday and Monday. Participating in the program were W. Wilson Goode, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department
of Education and former mayor
of Philadelphia, and Nell Irvin
Painter, an historian and author.
The University of Pennsylvania, where Tri-College students
can cross-register for classes,
was also in session Monday.
Tim Sams, Assistant Dean and
Director of the Black Cultural
Center, took a two-sided approach to the issue of whether to
have classes on the King holiday.
He would support canceling
classes, he said, as long as the
college had a "comprehensive
celebration" of the day. Were
classes to take place, he would
advocate spending time in the
classroom talking about peace,
justice, race, gender, and orientation.
The best way to spend class
time, he felt, would be to focus
on the principles King promoted.

After considering charges of
plagiarism, the College Judiciary
Committee has recommended
that a freshman receive no credit
for a fall semester class.
The sanction, however, is nonnotational and will not appear on
the student's permanent record.
The student's professor became suspicious, according to
testimony given before the committee on Jan. 12, due to sophisticated language used in certain
passages in one of the student's
papers.
The professor submitted the
site,
to
a
web
paper
www.plagiarism.org, that compares the paper to a databaseand
searches for similarities.
The computer reported that a
few passages in the student's paper were taken from lecture
notes from a class at another university. A professor at that university had posted the class notes
on the Internet. The passages
from the class notes were not
given attribution in the student's

paper.
During testimony, the student
recognized that the incident constituted plagiarism.
The committeereached a finding of guilt. The committee considered in its decision the fact
that the passages in question
were a small portion of the paper and that the student is a
freshman.
Committee members present
during the hearing were Dean of
the College Bob Gross, history
professor Robert Weinberg, psychology professor Frank Durgin
and Director of Facilities Management Stuart Hain.
The committee followed its
procedure of substituting two
members of the dean's staff—in
this case, assistant dean Joy
Charlton and assistant dean Myrt
Westphal—for the two student
representatives on the committee during breaks in the academic year.

Black-Jewish relations
discussed at BCC

From DISCUSSION, pg. 3
Greater Philadelphia, as well as
a member of the Advisory Committee of the Black Clergy of
Philadelphia and vicinity. He was
introduced to a group of
Swarthmore students, professors
and community members by Assistant Dean and BCC Director
Tim Sams, and Tri-Co Jewish
Advisor Rabbi Marcia PikNathan.
Siegel drew a number of comparisons between the black and
Jewish communities. In reality,
he noted, the black and Jewish
experience in America are very
different, though some Jews argue that they are quite similar.
Blacks arrived earlier than Jews,
in larger numbers, and perhaps
most significantly, as slaves.
Jews arrived later, and formed
communities that drew strength
and comfort from a shared connection to the past. For blacks,
many of these ties to the past
were severed by slavery. Siegel
observed that while Jews certainly experienced anti-Semitism
in this country, such discrimination paled in comparison to the
oppression they left behind in
Europe. Blacks, however, experienced the degrading effects of
segregation here in America. "In
Europe, Jews were always 'the
other,'" Siegel said, "but in
America, blacks [occupied that

position]."

Developing the relationship
between black and Jewish communities, Siegel focused particularly upon the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s. He
described the Jewish religion
and culture as placing a "tremendous emphasis on social justice,"
and demonstratedhow this intersected with the black community.
A Yiddish socialist newspaper,
The Jewish Daily Forward, covered stories of black lynchings
long before the popular press.
Jewish philanthropists constituted the major white contributors to the United Negro College
Fund, and helped establish the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
During the era of civil rights
struggle (and today), a disproportionate number of Jewish students were attending elite colleges, particularly along the east
coast. These students became

"attuned" to the civil rights efforts ofblack college students in
the South, whose work was sponsored by the black clergy.
Siegel himself participated in
the movement, particularly on
Maryland's eastern shore and in
Virginia. He emphasized big differences in the black and Jewish
activist experiences. Jewish organizers experienced antiSemitism in the South, but they
entered the fight with the understanding that they would return
home relatively unscathed. On
the other hand, black activists
and their families risked losing
jobs, homes and lives in the
struggle. Though he noted positive elements of the black/Jewish relationship at this time,
Siegel described white Jewish
activists as arrogant; they entered the fight believing that they
brought expertise from their
more privileged backgrounds.
Siegel characterized the cool response by blacks as a reflection
of growing nationalism, ethnic
identity and racial pride.
Siegel closed by discussing the
current state of the black/Jewish
relationship. He feels that we are
in a "quietperiod" of therelationship, and attributed most flareups to the media attention
granted to incendiary speakers
such as the Rev. Al Sharpton and
Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan. Both communities
have matured and are better able
to handle most disagreements
internally, away from the media
spotlight.
Following the lecture, students
in attendancebecame involved in
a lively question and answer period with Siegel. Sarah Yahm 'Ol
questioned the validity ofconsidering the Jewish community as
a unified force, when many divisions or subcultures exist within
it. Helaine Blumenthal 'O3 said
that she had observed extreme
examples of racism among the
orthodox and conservative Jews
of her community.
After a number of such comments in which Jewish racial attitudes and actions were called
into question, Siegel responded
emphatically. "Statistically," he
asserted, "Jews are significantly
less racist and more progressive
than other white people in
America."

A day of reverence?
When Swarthmore makes news, ‘backwards,’
‘disrespectful’ and ‘inadequate’ are rarely found in the
headline. But when it comes to the college’s policies on
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, these words describe
Swarthmore perfectly.
Swarthmore does not recognize Martin Luther King
Jr. Day, a federal and state holiday across the country.
The reasons why the college does this are not exactly
clear and certainly not good.
There is little doubt that the current situation is far
from ideal. Can proper tribute possibly be given to the
man who has come to embody the American civil rights
movement without the support of the very institutions
through which his dreams are now realized?
At a speech given in 1948 at Morehouse College in
Atlanta, King emphasized the importance of intense
critical thought as a logical way to approach the world.
But as King concluded his speech, he qualified his
argument, remarking, “The complete education gives
one not only power of concentration, but worthy
objectives upon which to concentrate.”
Swarthmore has an obligation to provide its students
with such a “complete education.” Yet on King’s birthday, a compelling community service opportunity was
arranged to honor King, and more Phoenix reporters
were there than Swarthmore students. Clearly the
college has somehow failed to fulfill its obligation.
The fault, of course, does not lie with any one
constituency. Students could have been more receptive, the organizers could have better promoted the
event and the weather could have been more cooperathese factors alone do
tive. But something is missing
not explain whyonly one student attended the event.
Swarthmore students have shown they have the desire
to participate in this type of character-building education
witness the over 150 students who attended Monday
night’s vigil in honor of King. But when it comes to this
worthy objective, the college itselfis standing in the way.
Along with the mandate that students must attend
the first day of class, scheduling classes for Martin
Luther King Jr. Day sends the students a clear mesthere is no room for this type of education
sage
here. This seems to be contradictory with the college’s
other service-related policies. On all other accounts,
the college tends to encourage students to pursue these
opportunities, so why the about-face here?
Maybe it is simply administrative foot-dragging or a
concern about students returning late, but in this case,
reality trumps speculation. The college has every
reason to recognize King’s birthday. To respect King,
to respect faculty and staff, to encourage the intersection of service and intellect any one of these reasons
is more than sufficient to merit a change in policy.
It is time Swarthmore forgets its Quaker austerity
for a moment and embraces a holiday that is truly
agreeable to the college’s ultimate ends.

From inside the bubble, looking out
By Veronica Herrera
For The Phoenix
First semester at Swat, done. I don't think the pass/
fail semester was too hard on anybody, but I think we
were all pretty ready to go home. Excited to see my
friends, and even my family, I headed home, expecting to find things just as I had left them. Only four
months had gone by, how different could my hometown be? Well, a four month seclusion at Swat can do a
whole lot more than give you constant, piercing migraines, and it only took a few minutes at home to realize just how true that really was.
To begin with, my brother. He kept making fun of
my new "Swat" terms, which I, of course, had no idea
weren't household sayings. "So, your new 'profs' are
really interesting, eh?" (snicker, snicker) "So, 'Swat' is
kinda hard, eh, is that what all the "Swatties" think?"
"What the hell is a 'Swattie' anyway?" He kept making
fun of everything I was saying, and even though he
thought he was so damn funny, I really didn't understand what he was talking about. He thought I was
speaking a whole new language. I thought I was making complete sense.
And then there were my friends, talking about how
hard their schools are, and how they really can only go
out and drink Thursday through Sunday, and sometimes on Wednesdays, "you know, to get you through
'til the weekend." No, I didn't know. "Oh, and I don't
know if I'm going to pledge to Alpha Gamma Theta
Beta Kappa Phi Row or Theta Kappa Phi Sigma, where
are you thinking about pledging?" Ah, I thought, ifthey
only knew.
And then there was my friend Lindsay: "Oh, I don't
even need my old gym membership because I work
out for free at UVA's brand new, fully equipped gym.
What have you been doing to stay in shape?" Well, I
wasn't about to bring our gym into it. I didn't think it
necessary to embarrass myself explaining the safety
hazards of our dark little dungeon. And as for staying
in shape, I didn'tfeel the need to mention that my idea
of staying in shape has been hitting up the ice cream
bar only four or five days out of the week.

But my friends were easy to take compared to all those
people that I kind of knew back in high school, but not
really, and who felt like they should ask all kinds of questions that were, of course, none of their business. I ran
into one girl at FootLocker who went on and on about how
great her grades were at the nearby community collegethen she asked about mine.
I replied that I was not sure and that it didn'treally matter because the first semester at Swat was pass/fail. After
the anticipated snicker and "What the hellis a Swat?" she
replied with, "Wow, you are sooooo lucky, they must not
be too concerned about academics at... what didyou say it
was called again?...oh yeah, Swarthmore. Is that like,an
all-girls school?" "No, it's not an all-girls school," I answered, annoyed at hearing that question for the tenth
time. "Are you sure it didn't used to be an all girls school
And then the long-awaited and by now, completely unoriginal, "That's not a community college, is it? I mean, that!
great if it is, it's great that you are at least in school, you
know that's the first step, I mean, after I got my GEU.
1..." It took a great deal of willpower to keep from knocK-,
ing her out. Andbefore I returned to Swat, I had innumerable similar experiences. All those people I never realty
liked and whom I know never really liked me, for some
reason, for some damn reason, thinkthat we all have something in common because we are all in "community college" together.
I think the thing that struck me the hardest, however,
was all the southern accents. I'm from Charlottesville, Virginia, and I don't consider it the South. But I was
ened over break. "Veronica, ya thank ya culd go dawn tn»
rny
and pick us sumin' tuh eet, I ain't got da time," was
thougn
boss's question when I got to work one day. Wow, I
to myself, where have I been living all these years?
way
What I also couldn't get over was the easy, simple
that people at home used to express themselves. They s#
what they meant, and that was that. I didn't need a dico
nary to decipher any big words, and I didn't need tora
tri
my brain to uncover deep, hidden meanings. No
to impress me with their SAT scores, or what school trn
y
gave up to be at...well, yes, community college, but,
get the picture.

Environmentalism is in our interest
By Amanda Schneider
For The Phoenix

When people think of environmental-

ism, they usually think about hugging
trees, saving the whales, and protecting
the rainforest. They do not usually think
about ensuring the well-being of people.
Traditionally, the impetus behind environmentalism has ranged from the metaphysical to the mundane. Some argue that
we should protect the earth because "nature" itselfhas intrinsic value. Others say
we have a responsibility to protect each
species oflife because of the importance
of biodiversity to ecological stability.
While these are valid issues and important motivations for environmentalactivism, they can alienate people that adhere
to different value systems or scientific
views. Not everyone loves the trees and
the dirt, and we know very little abouthow
our actions affect the ecosystems that
sustain us. But most of us have some level
of concern for our fellow human. We have
sympathy for those who lose their jobs or
their families. We just do not realize how
we can play a part in these tragedies
through our lack of environmental concern.
Environmental issues are often framed
in terms of human vs. nature or nature vs.
the economy. Yet when resources are
managed irresponsibly, people suffer.For
example, fishermen in New England are
now facing the consequences of years of
overfishing. One fisherman nearly lost his
life over Christmas while fishing far offshore in bad weather. He couldn't stay in
a safer area closer to shore because such
areas were closed due to overfishing. This
near-tragedy might have been prevented
if fishing regulations had been established
before the fish populations fell to critically

low levels. No one wanted to impose restrictions before there was hard evidence
of an imminent crisis.
Our scientific ignorance and past technological progress are often used as excuses to ignore environmental problems.
As our air gets more polluted, some say,
we will simply develop technology to help
us clean it up. It is unnecessary or unethical to cause human suffering today by
imposing environmental regulation to alleviate possible future problems. Even if
the future turns out to be better than we
think, to postpone dealing with the environmental consequences of our actions is
to ignore or marginalize the suffering of
those already affected by environmental
problems. I think it is important to realize that while the possibility of a global
environmental crisis is real, numerous
local environmental crises already affect
many people.
The first to suffer from environmental
degradation are the underprivileged. This
is already far too apparent in the disproportionate rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases in our inner cities.
Places like Chester have to suffer the consequences of the environmental destruction the rest of us create. Every piece of
trash you have generated in your lifetime
goes into the backyard or air of someone
who does not have the power to keep it
out of his or her community. This is the
best reason that I have for being an environmentalist.
One of the unfortunate consequences of
complex systems is that we are often blind
to the consequences of our actions.
Though I may not see the health problems
caused by the paper cups I throw away,
as an environmentalist, I know such problems exist. According to theEnvironmental Protection Agency, the cancer rate in

Chester is 2.5 times the normal rate. Because I don't personally know any Chester
residents afflicted with cancer, it would
be easy for me to forget or deny their suffering. Our complex social and economic
systems prevent us from seeing the effects of our own actions on others. Complex environmental systems establish a
context in which we may not understand
the extent of the environmental disaster
we bring upon ourselves and others.
Therefore, we postpone action indefinitely, until it is too late, not understanding that for some people, the consequences of irresponsible environmental
practices have already arrived.
To what extent are you a part of environmental problems? The question must
be considered as a serious moral issue
worth consideration on both social and
personal levels. As a nation and as individuals, we are privileged in our ability
to consume. We can and do ignore the
problems we cause for others. I consider
myself an environmental moderate in
many ways—l occasionally indulge in a
paper cup, I drive a car, I understand that
sometimes wilderness must be sacrificed
to development. Nevertheless, I do not
think it is acceptable to ignore the ways
our economic structure fails to reveal or
reflect environmental realities.
As a society, we consume natural resources at an astounding rate regardless
of the environmental problems this behavior causes at home, next door and abroad.
We can take as many paper cups and napkins as we want, we buy gas cheap, and
we ship our trash to poorer neighborhoods
without a second thought. We should ask
how much we care about the lives of others, and decide if our conduct coincides
with the ethical standards we set for ourselves.

Al Gore's pledge during a recent debate to allow gay men and women
to serve openly in the military and to make
the issue a litmus test for appointees to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff has reawakened
an issue that emerged most notably during the 1992 presidential election. The
matter is a head shaker, as in: we find ourselves shaking our heads in disbelief that
there is still reason to debate whether gay
Americans should be allowed to wear the

After a soul-searching, heart-wrenching, but ultimately mind-numbing series

to vote for Al Gore.
There goes the secret ballot.
I suppose one is to be congratulated for
voting at all these days, much less being
informed or, God forbid, passionate about
the democratic process. But I think that
making a relatively rational decision about
who to vote for is probably still a good idea,
or at least a worthwhile goal. Of course, my
college professor cousin tells me that voting isn't rational. Seeing as no one individual
can affect the outcome of the race, why
bother venturing out to the polls at all?Freerider theories aside, though, four years is z

If you're going to vote Republican my
cousin may be right. But in the Democratic

may actually a battle or two to be won.
Al Gore is the better choice not because
it would be a disgrace to have two presidents in a row named Bill (though it would
be a disgrace), and not because the vicepresident is more likeable (he's anything
but). He is the better choice because in the

the morning they filled black garbage bags with
dead leaves, old newspapers, empty potato chip
bags, candy wrappers, and crushed soda cans.
They also picked up larger items, including broken chairs, small tree branches, and tires. By
early afternoon the group had neatly piled the
refuse by the side of the road for collection,
transforming tangled carpets of trash into
green patches of lawn.
The MartinLuther King Day of Service Monday provided an opportunity for college faculty, students, and staff to serve in theBuckman
Village neighborhood ofChester. Swarthmore's
participation in the service day was financed
by a grant from the Swarthmore Foundation,
according to Louisa Whitfield-Smith 'O2, who
helped coordinate the event.
The Buckman Village cleanup was one of
thirty community service projects organized
by the Unity Center, Inc, a non-profit corporation, as part of the MartinLuther King Service
Day in Chester. Approximately 250 volunteers
from Delaware County spent the morning
working at sites throughout the city. This annual service day aims to "build bridges and tear
down walls" through service projects that bring
together residents from both Chester and suburban towns, said Jim Ley, Co-Chair of the
MartinLuther King Day of Service and Director of Unity Center, Inc.
Volunteers from all the sites gathered for a
luncheon at the Eagle's Nest Academy in
Chester, where they were addressed by several
Chester community leaders, including a member of the city council, the mayor, and the Director of the YWCA.
In his keynote address, Dr. Tim Sams, Director of the Swarthmore Black Cultural Center,
urged volunteers to set a higher goal than community service for its own sake by pursuing
justice both in the city of Chester and in the
world at large. "If we don't work for justice,
we have failed Dr. King's legacy," said Sams.
The purpose of Swarthmore's involvement
in the Martin Luther King Day of Service was
to honor King and his commitment to service,
according Louisa Whitfield-Smith 'O2. "We
wanted to get more people to serve..." explained Whitfield-Smith. "We wanted to get the
Swarthmore community to work with Chester
and strengthen our ties [to Chester]"
Gene Foehl, president of Unity Center, Inc,
believed that the service day would encourage
members of the college community to forge a
partnership with Chester residents through
continued volunteer work in the city "People
need to know what their neighbors are like,"
said Foehl.
Pat James, Director of Community Service
Learning Programs at the college, stated that
the Martin Luther King Service Day was also a
chance for Swarthmore to "give back" to
Chester—a city which has provided students
with numerous opportunities to workand learn.
"There's value in picking a small corner of the
world and cleaning it up," added James.
The volunteers at the Swarthmore site
seemed enthusiastic about cleaning up their

corner of the world. Maggie Is

GUEST COLUMN

No intellectuals need apply
By Adam I.Arenson
The Harvard Crimson

CAMBRIDGE, Dec. 9,1999 It's time
we, the student body, write a collective

Local bar
plays the
race card
During the last week of finals a group
of us—two Latinas, two Asian women and
one Latino—wanted a drink to celebrate
our hard day of studying. Since it was past
midnight, two of the local restaurant bars
were closing up and we were left to find a
third option. "Wait! There's that pub with
the green awning next to Staples!" And
off we drove to check it out.
None of us had patronized the establishment before. After someone verified
that it was still serving, we walked in. We
faced a wall of glares from the only customers there. They were all white and
occupied every seat in the bar area. You
would've thought they were looking at
space aliens—or at the very least illegal
aliens.
After getting settled at an adjacent dining table, our Latino brother approached
the large bartender. Our friend flashed his
driver's license but was denied service
because the license was not from Pennsylvania. He made his way back to our
table to relay the news.
In disbelief, we realized that only one
of us had a Pennsylvania license, a Latina
sister who, as an international student,
was ironically the most "alien." So she
walked up to the bar, showed her license
and asked for a beer. She was told that
she could get one, "but you can't drink it
in front of your friends. They have to
leave."
When we found this out, we were so disgusted that we didn't want to put up a
fight. That would've prolonged the uneasy feeling that was already ruining our
evening. Frustrated and tired, we walked
out the door, but not before one of us
could say an expletive in anger. We drove
back to Swat, hurt and without one drink
consumed.
Being the rational, identity-conscious
people that we are, we searched for the
remote chance that the discrimination we
felt was at least currently justifiedby law.
If it was, the law is wrong. A white female
acquaintance told me that even with an
out-of-statelicense the most hassle she has
ever experienced was having to fill out a
form to purchase alcohol.
No doubt. This treatment was racial.
And we could possibly throw in some age
discrimination.The bottom lineis that we
all had the legal right to be served. Even
though we were on the cusp of the new
millennium, the power of rejection was
still in the hands of the white proprietor,
in a manner completely reminiscent of
how laws have historically played out in
the lived experience of racial minorities
in America. With a few simple words, the
bartender evoked a legal authority larger
than his own to justify his personal discriminatory preferences. Without a law
book on hand and facing legal authority
in the moment, we did what minorities
have been conditioned by this country to
do: we acquiesced and became the vic-

letter to our friends at Williams or
Swarthmore, Wesleyan or Amherst. It
doesn't have to be long, just enough to
admit the truth:Liberal-arts colleges, you
win. You possess the nation's most innovative minds, the most intellectual student
body. You are the stomping grounds for
the great thinkers of the next millennium.
We, Harvard, will stop trying to lord over
you, stop saying that we are better or
smarter, because it just isn't true. You can
out-think us any day of the week.
There. Once that is said, we can all go
on with being more honestly what we
are—not intellectuals.
Don't get me wrong: Harvard students
can be, and often are, great. They just
aren't intellectuals. Sure, that first night
the entire dorm gathered in somebody's
common room and shared a bunch of ideas
about what college was supposed to be,
about where they were from and what
they thought was really important,but the
minute placement tests came along, let
alone classes and extracurriculars, everyone was holed up in their room, hard at
work or hard at play, and the great intellectual college conversations you had
dreamed of became the thing of nostalgia
and viewbooks.
It is probably important to define what
I mean by intellectuals. I mean people who
have a tendency to answer questions with
questions and to think not inside or outside the box as much as about the box itself. The intellectual may not get the recruiting job or the place in the U.S. Senate, but he or she may win a MacArthur
Prize or be invited to Sweden for a hefty
award down the line. Many of you may be
recoiling in disgust, but if a good philosophical conversation interests you and
you can't find the right conversation partner, then you know what sort of intellectual I mean is missing from Harvard.
In some ways, it's the entire Harvard
attitude. For example, on other campuses
current events matter. People begin statements "when I was watching the news..."
or "as I just read in the G10be...." Dinner
conversations can be about reports on the
increase in dual AIDS-hepatitis C cases or
the assassination attempt on a member of
the Palestinian National Council, to quote
some of last week's news that has gone
unnoticed and unmentioned. On other
campuses, people leave plays, concerts
and especially speeches charged up, ready

to fight out their beliefs and talk about how

they felt challenged or inspired. Here,
people mumble, "yeah, that was good,"
before they turn back to thoughts on how
much work there is left to do tonight.
Harvard seems populated with people
I would fit into two large groups, which
have some overlap: the leaders and the
hard workers.
The leaders are often Harvard's pride
and those students most easily confused
with intellectuals. They found groups, they
take on massive projects, they organize and
coordinate large student activities from the
Hasty Pudding to Project HEALTH to the
lOP They work long hours, put in incredible amounts ofeffortand make important
changes in the quality of life for Harvard
students and the surrounding communities, but leadership alone does not make an
intellectual. These leaders could enthusiastically talkyou under the table with plans
for new improvements and new programs
but are just as unlikely to know why it
matters what they are doing. They work
with like-minded students but might not be
able to convince a disinterested party why,
on a deepphilosophical level, they are adding anything more to life than an inveterate slacker.
Which brings us to the next category:
the hard workers, probably the most
deeply anti-intellectual group at Harvard.
Some work hard in their classes and can
be found at all hours at computer terminals or in the bio labs, and some work hard
at not working: scheduling the perfect
weekend, planning the cheapest way to hit
Paris and Acapulco during reading period
or beating the next level on the newest
Nintendo game. These people are focused
and do the work that gets the grade—or
at least gets them by—but ask for their
thoughts and their eyes glaze over.
Harvard does have some intellectuals.
Each of these groups attract some, but in
some ways it feels like a fluke. Given the
hostile environment to real thinking, students become "politic."

The politic are those who, despite their
feelings on an issue, "just don't want to
get into it." Maybe they feel the exchange
of ideas will leave them where they are
anyway and just create tension in a rooming group or a friendship. "It's just not
worth it," they think, and so they are willing to step back and keep tfieir ideas to
themselves. They can see Harvard isn't
the place where each existential moment
deserves its own observations, where
"what it all means" might be as important
as the bottom line.
The intellectualhigh school senior probably self-selects away from Harvard and
toward schools like Swarthmore. Imagine
what you would think of a student who
showed up as a pre-frosh and asked when
the last time you were* up late struggling
with Wittgenstein's theories of games or
Weber's predictions for the future ofcivilization—not just writing a response paper after skimming half the book, but really considering the challenges posed by
these thinkers. Imagine if they asked if
the triumphs and catastrophes, big and
small, we face every day, even if we rush
by and pretend not to see them, grabbed
you with a thought and would not let go.
What would you say? If a pre-frosh came
up to you and asked about what the true
nature of good is, the most common student response would be something flippant like "not this conversation" and
change the subject, more often than not
to the chorus of "I have so much work."
Maybe the undifferentiated mass of
"work" we always talk about is the real
problem. Where is the "learning from discussions with others" touted in those
viewbooks? Does anyone ever carry conversation beyond section? When is the last
time you got into a discussion with a roommate over reading for a class you don't
have in common, or even one you do have
in common? Hey, when is the last time you
talked about anything with your roommates? Harvard often seems like an intellectual wasteland.
There are some reliable exceptions,
such as this editorial page, some study
groups at the lOP, the extraordinary tutorial and the really rare Core section that
may live up to its billing as a class about
"approaches to knowledge." Yet they are
few and far between and seem rather the
exceptions that prove the rule.
So, Swarthmore, Williams, maybe even
Yale and the University of Chicago, you
win. The lesson here is clear enough: no
intellectuals need apply.

The Magnetic Fields
With a new album, '69 Love Songs' the band is gaining popularity and coming to Swat
By SuzanneWu
Phoenix Staff
The following was my initial attempt at writing an article
on the almost universally lauded group, The Magnetic Fields,
because although I would love to think that I am the first person who ever wanted to convince you to love this band as
much as I do, in reality it's all been said and done before.
Many a time almost to the point where it is formulaic.
So, here are the directions for your very own Do-It-Yourself The Magnetic Fields article.

PLAYING THEIR HEARTS OUT:The Magnetic Fields performed at Olde Club in 1997.
They will return this Friday at 8 p.m. to promote their new three-disc album,"69 Love
Songs."

1) First you make some funny little observation or tell an
anecdote about The Magnetic Field's Stephen Merritt.
a)Compare Merritt to Prince. Draw distinctions between
their control freak tendencies and their prolific bodies of
work. "Whereas Prince's lyrics mainly concern themselves
with gettin' his freak on, Merritt's are a beyond-clever blend
oflovelorn pop cliche and pre poetic invention" (NYPress Arts
& Listings, May 19-25, 1999).
b)Talk about how "Tainted Love" was playing when Merritt
entered the restuarant where you were having an interview.
Talk about his bad haircut. Assign much more meaning to
both of these things than they deserve. "Stephen Merritt, a
confessed 'Bo's nostalgic, offers a deadpan stare and fidgets
on his cushion. A small, remote man with a recent unfortuante
haircut that makes him look like a 12-year-old who took his
ball and went home" (Spin, Sept. 1994).
c) Analyze his childhood. "As a child, Stephen Merritt loved
Disney. But unlike other young Disney fans who fawned over
Mickey Mouse and dreamed of meeting Donald Duck, Merritt
wanted to be Walt Disney himself" (New York News Blade,
May 21,1999).
2) Then you give a nod to Claudia Gonson and mention how
Merritt and Gonson have been friends since forever.
a) "Wasp's Nest started two years ago when Merritt's manager and drummer, Claudia Gonson, a friend since they were
teen-agers, joked about a Merritt tribute album" (Rolling
Stone, July 1995). Wasp's Nest is credited to the 6ths, another
Merritt endeavor. In the last decade Merritt has written and
performed on at least eight albums with The Magnetic Fields,
the 6ths, Gothic Archies and Future Bible Heroes.

In this production of the novel-turned-musical-turned movie, the romantic story is set against the visually stunning backdrop of

1862 Thailand.

'Anna and the King' elaborate, flawed
By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff
With my brother and me out of the
my parents decided to fill our respective spaces with exchange students
this year. One is from Spain, the other is
from Thailand. Over break, I went to see
"Anna and the King," partly because I
wanted to see it anyway, but also because
I was curious about the Thai student's reaction. Like previous versions of the Anna
Leonowens story, this one, written by Peter Krikes and Steve Meerson, was banned
in Thai theaters. Had the student not left
Thailand for a year in the US, he may
never have seen the movie.
This may not have been so bad for him.
As I watched, awestruck by the elaborate
reproduction of 1862 Bangkok, my Thai
friend snoozed beside me, showing little
or no interest in the pictures on the screen.
As the credits rolled and the theater lit
up, I asked him his opinion of the movie.
He replied that he found it tediously boring, but that he understood the ban in Thailand.
In his explanation of the ban, he detailed
the tremendous reverence the Thai people
have for their king. The student described
how the king is worshipped almost as a
god in Thailand. According to Thai tradition, their king would never have stooped
so low as to have let some petty romance

house,

affect his professional relationship with
his children's foreign tutor. Not only that,
but King Mongkut would never have
mounted an elephant cowboy-style the
way Chow Yun-Fat, his portrayer, did.
The student explained a number of

I was able to watch and
appreciate "Anna and the King"
for its artistic and cinematic
value.
other aspects of the king's behavior that
were unrealistic as well. He said that a
Thai king would not have had 26 wives and
40-odd concubines
the number of his
wives would have been in the single digits and his concubines would certainly not
number more than thirty. What kind of
king did these Americans think he was,
anyway?
Perhaps it's because I'm not Thai, because I've never been to Thailand, or because I'm not terribly familiar with Thai
custom, but I was able to watch and appreciate "Anna and the King" for its artistic and cinematic value. I had been familiar with the Leonowens story. It began as a novel, evolved into a movie, became a successful Broadway musical, was
followed by a movie reproduction of that

musical, and then was just last year re-

done again as an animated feature. I thus
went into the new film version expecting
to be bored by it.
However, this version of the romantic
tale between the English widow hired to
tutor a hoard of royal children and the king
of the former Siam managed to hold my
attention. The film added the intensity,
action and drama that have become signature to most American films, and was
successful in creating a compelling remake of the story. Jodie Foster was excellent as the stubborn, necessarily prissy
Anna, and Yun-Fat's performance was
equally thrilling. For a sixth remake, this
movie holds its own.
Had it not involved their king in such a
scandalous manner, I think Thailand
would have eaten it up as well, since Thai
culture readily embraces American music, American fashion, and most other
American films. Upset about profits lost
on the movie, producers Lawrence Bender
and Ed Elbert have commented that the
Thai people should have taken the story
more lightly, realizing that it was, after
all, a cinema production and not a historical document. To an extent, this might be
true, but it was the responsibility of the
producers to do the research and ensure
that their movie wouldn't cause such an
outrage by insulting a nation's long-standing traditions.

Throw in a little ABBA, a few more references, the fact that Merritt is gay, and
then write about the contradiction between the incredible melancholy of The
Magnetic Field's lyrics and the poppy
sound. End with a cryptic quote.
There you have it.

But then I realized that The Magnetic
Fields' songs have, in their basic structure,
already been donebefore as well. Though
The Magnetic Fields write spunky love
songs, they are intelligent and twisted and
not at all generic, so the least I could do
was extend some effort beyond a mere
piecing together of general information.
I may not turn the genre on its head, but
here's another try:
Here's a random stat that someone
threw at me the other day, which I'm probably exaggerating for the sake of making
a point: 25 percent of college students are

Claudia Gonson and Stephen Merritt (at
center), the core members ofThe Magnetic
Fields, have been friends and collaborators
“since forever.”
clinically depressed three out of their four
years in college. And we all know that depressed people often like to wallow and
indulge their depression and listen to
music that is bitterly, humorously, even
ironically sad. Maybe that’s why The Magnetic Field’s made their initialradio breakthrough on college radio, and why they
have continued to tour colleges even with
their newfound success.

"Stephen's lyrics work well with the
emotional whirlwind of youth," explains
Gonson, who no longer plays the drums,
but has moved on to the piano.
Gonson says The Magnetic Fields' style
has become "quieter and more cabaretlike than in previous years."
"I often can't believe it's been a decade
since I got out of school," she said. "I do
feel older now; I find myself saying, 'My,
you've grown' to younger people, and driving slower in my car. That said, it's really
weird how fast the time goes by."
The Magnetic Field's newest release,
the three-CD, "69 Love Songs," was recently named as one of the top ten albums
of 1999by Spin magazine. And thealbum
wasn't number ten either. It was more like
number three.
"Right now we're getting great press,"
said Gonson. "But, I'm thinking, 'Okay,
time to set up thatrelease in Europe.' But
of course I'm thrilled that '69 Love Songs'
is getting the recognition it has. I think
it's a magnificent album and I'm very
proud of Stephen."
"69 Love Songs" was initially visualized
by Merritt as a 100-song cabaret style re-

vue production. But 100 three minute
songs is over four hours without breaks,
so Merritt then settled on the next best
number—69. Despite its often morbid and
cynical take on love, the album, in a
strange way, still glorifies the emotion and
the pain that comes with heartbreak. To
paraphrase a recent criticism of the great
photographer Cindy Sherman, The Magnetic Fields ratio of triumph to failure on
their new opusis about twenty to one. But,
in this case, one triumph is worth a hundred failures.

much time on their hands and too
little mental satisfaction, unless
they organize something, anything, creative.
We at The Phoenix are not

briefest of brief guides to the
plethora of happenings already
scheduled on campus for this semester. Have fun!

"The making of the show will
be in the spirit of a developmental model," Ryan writes. "We'll be
trying to create a 'Damn Yankees' that is truly our own."
In addition, look for the
Drama-Board sponsored Night of
Scenes and the return of
Shakespeare In the Crum. Both
productions will be soliciting directors and actors for scenes and
short one-acts.
Another event for your calendar should be the Feminist
Majority's presentation of "The
Vagina Monologues" coming
Valentine's Day weekend.

Music
The music department will
sponsor recitals and concerts by
its own students and by outside
guests. The semester kicked off
last Sunday with a concert featuring Marcantonio Barone, piano and Mikhail Tsinman, violin.
Sasha Leinster, soprano, Eva
Allan, violin, and Josh Bess, bass,
will give senior recitals on Feb.
12, March 24, and April 22 respectively.
The department's performing
groups and ensembles will give
their concerts between April 19
and 29; particularly anticipated
is the Chorus' performance of
Bach's "St. John Passion."
Swarthmore's in-house professional ensemble, Orchestra 2001,
will give several concerts over
the course of the semester. Look
especially for their concert on
May 6 with Peter Schickele, a
Swat alum made good. His alterego, P.D.Q. Bach, will make an appearance, and he will conduct his
own Half-Act Opera.

What: "Fax From Sarajevo: A Story of

Survival" by Joe Kubert (Dark Horse

Books).

Background: Ervin Rustemagic, owner
of the company Strip Art Features, is an
international businessman and art agent.
Due to the unrest in Sarajevo in early 1992,
Ervin took his wife, Edina, and two young
children, Edvin and Maja, to Holland
where he kept offices and an apartment.
In March 1992, the troubles in Sarajevo
appeared to be quieting down; Edina,
Edvin and Maja were getting homesick for
the friends and family they had left behind. Despite Ervin's concerns and warnings from the author, Kubert, who is a family friend, Edinaand the children returned
to Sarajevo.
The book begins on March 24, 1992,
when Ervin returned to Sarajevo to join
nis family. That evening, an explosion

A vivid tale of life in war-torn Sarajevo
occured just outside their home, signaling the arrival of Serb forces.
Ervin quickly received word that the
roads were closed, with Serbian soldiers
killing anyone who tried to get out of
Sarajevo. Thus, the nightmare begins for
the Rustemagic family and their friends
and neighbors.
Throughout the 18 months the story
spans, Ervin maintained contact with the
outside worldvia faxes. His letters, which
increasingly lost their optimism witheach
passing day, were sent to his friends
around the world, including to Kubert and
his wife Muriel in Dover, NJ.
By piecing together the faxes that
served as Ervin's lifeline during his captivity in Sarajevo, Kubert communicates
the story of Ervin's survival and struggle
to get his family out of Sarajevo. The story
not only focuses on the horrors of life in
Sarajevo (chapter 7 is entitled "The Rape
Camp") but also tells of the attempts of
Ervin's friends to help get the
Rustemagics out of Sarajevo.
The Review: Joe Kubert is one of the
premiere graphic storytellers of all time.
Nevertheless, I am positive that when he
chose to tell this non-fictional story via
"cartooning," he understood that no matter how good he was, he would never truly
capture on paper what occurred right in
front of Ervin's eyes in full, three-dimensional color.

In a similar vein, I feel that there is little
that I can do in this column that could do
eitherKubert or the Rustemagics justice.
But I have written this more than anything
else as a plea to the college community to
read this work.
Regardless of the inherent limitations
of a graphic novel in two dimensions,
Kubert has created an excellent piece of
work. It is difficult to say from this single

book whether the story simply tells itself
well or if it is due to Kubert's talent that
the pages of this book to turn so effortlessly. Personally, I take this ambiguity as
a sign of a great storyteller.
One detail I shall pick on is that there
are people, such as Ervin's assistant,
Butzo, who appear in earlier chapters but
are not mentioned again later. Part of me
wants to know what happened to him. Part
of me doesn't.
The artwork is done in signature Kubert
style. Images still flash across my eyes of
little Edvin and a found puppy, of dear
Grandpa narrowly missing death by an
artillery shell and of old comic books being used as armor during runs to the hospital in Sarajevo.
Kubert used photographs of war-torn
Sarajevo taken by a friend of Ervin's to
give his work credibility. Combined with
the coloring, performed by Ervin's own
company, Kubert has done a fine job of
bringing the audience as close to Sarajevo
in 1992-93 as anyone probably would want
to be.
Kubert's previous works have involved
depicting war scenes, yet those were action hero comic book stories. The personal
side of this work
imagine waiting by
your fax hour after hour, just to find out
whether your friend and colleague was
still alive
is what sets this apart from
all others. This is simply one story that
everyone should know.

Friday

One of the good things about this film is that it doesn't turn Andy Kaufman into a sweet,
misunderstood guy. There are many moments that are often painful, though the scenes
with his alter-ego Tony Clifton are hilarious. Don't see this movie if you don't know
anything about Kaufman, and even if you do, you may find it too maudlin to be enjoyable.
7:10,9:15

Adapted from E.B.White's childrens' classic, "StuartLittle" uses groundbreaking technology to tell the story of a mouse adopted by the Little family. Somehow, though, the literal
translation into film takes away from the thing that made the book so magical: imagination.

Saturday 7:20,9:25

Jonathan Lipinski.

"Bicentennial Man"
PG. 132 minutes.
Starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.

9:45

RobinWilliams plays a robobutler named Andrew, who arrives in a packing crate one day
outside the home of a family who is destined to share him for four generations. Though it
starts out with some promise of a good science fiction movie, it decends into a kind of
corny usually reserved for those Hallmark movies.

"TheTalented Mr. Ripley"
R. 135 minutes.
Starring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett
and Jude Law.

7:50,10:55

Matt Damon gives an excellent, disturbing performance in one of the year's best thrillers.
The lush, beautiful scenes of Italy in the 1950s contrasts sharply with the dark undertones
and complexity of the plot. Based on Patricia Highsmith's 1955 literary crime novel, this
coolly beautiful film is an engrossing study of a sociopath's progress.

"Any Given Sunday"
R. 165 minutes.
Starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz and

7:10, 10:45

Oliver Stone's newest drama focuses on America's most beloved (and most lucrative)
pastime: football, a sport that is violent, aggressive, engaging, fast-paced and jarring. It fits
right into his niche of style. You'll be wowed by the good acting and cinematography, but
bring aspirin, because this movie is too loud to be so long.

8:00, 10:15

A chronicle of the search and rescue patrol of a deep space medical ship and its sixmember crew that answers an emergency call and finds itself in danger from the young
man it rescues. "Supernova" was released amid rumors of trouble on the set, and this
feeling is present throughout the film, which often seems to be missing chunks of the plot

"Toy Story 2"
G. 85 minutes.
Starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.

7:30

According to critics, this sequel to Pixar's jovial "Toy Story" matches its predecessor in its
wit and wizardry. The movie includes Woody, Buzz, 80-Peep, Mr. Potatohead and the
whole gang for a good time.

"Play ItTo the Bone"
R. 125 minutes.
StarringAntonion Banderas,Woody Harrelson, Lolita
Davidovich and Lucy Liu.

7:40,10:10

StarringAntonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson as welterweight boxers Caesar
Dominguez andVince Boudreau, respectively, who get a final shot at boxing's big time.
They have a few hours to get to Las Vegas, and take a circuituous road trip to get there.
The film should be funny, but fails to land enough punches to get there.

"Girl, Interrupted"

7:20, 10:30

Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie make sparks fly in this film based on the memoirs of
Susanna Kaysen (played by Ryder), who spent time in a mental hospital in 1 967. Though
the plot and themes wander, Jolie and Ryder, and the cast of characters who are their
ward mates poignantly illustrate this intriguing and watchable movie.

8:10

Based on Stephen King's best-seller, this is the story of a death row murderer locked
away in a Southern prison. Of course, he's not the monster he appears to be, and that's
the big complication...that and the fact that the guy has the magical power of healing.
The casting and acting are stellar, making "The Green Mile" a must-see.

7:40, 10:00

A humorous spoof of the television series "Star Trek," "Galaxy Quest" pokes fun at the
show and its... um... devoted fans. Tim Allen's striking resemblance to Willian Shatner
(Trek's Capt. Kirk) is funny enough to carry the film by itself, but unless you are a "Star
Trek" fan and have a sense of humor aboutTrekkies, it's not for you.

127 minutes.

NFL: the next
generation
With an expansion team and three perennial losers as the last four teams in the
NFL, many fans are left wondering who
to root for. I'll try and give you some help
with that.
Before I make a case for each team, let
me make somethingperfectly clear: make
sure you are able to differentiate between
rooting for an exciting team and becoming a fair-weather fan. Nothing sickens me
more than seeing an entire off-season invasion of Super Bowl championship gear
worn by fair-weather fans. During Christmas break, I saw somebody wearing a St.
Louis Rams hat and I almost punched him
in the nose. There is no way on earth that
he owned that hat prior to this season.
In fact, I'm quite certain they didn't
even make Rams hats until this season. If
you're from St. Louis, fine. If you're from
Tennessee, you have the right to call yourself a Titans fan. If you favorite player is
Mike Alstott, you can qualify as a Bucs
fan. But for Christ's sake, don't claim to
be Jaguars fan if Jacksonville puts up another 62 points in the Super Bowl. Root
for them if you like. Cheer when they
score and celebrate when it's officially
over, but the next day you had better be
wearing your old Kordell Stewart jersey.
Here's the team by team breakdown:
Tennessee Titans
Why you should root for them: The
Freak. Jevon Kearse has redefined what
it means to be a defensive end. This guy
is strong, smart and lightning quick and
is an absolute thrill to watch even if he's
getting blocked. Also, according to Titan
head coach Jeff Fisher, "the Titans are a
team of destiny." They seem to have
proved it so far with the "Music City
Miracle" win over the Bills in the Wild
Card gameand their upset victory in Indianapolis. If you believe in all that fate
and destiny mumbo jumbo, the Titans
might be your team.
Why you should root against them: Their
offense is B-O-R-I-N-G. Defensive contests are less exciting than high scoring
shootouts, and Tennessee does everything
but light up the scoreboard. An average
game for Steve McNair is 6 of 11 passing
for 75 yards and a pick plus 30 yards rushing with a TD. Kurt Warner racks up more
yardage on the Rams first drive of the
game.Eddie George, while an impressive
specimen and incredible workhorse, has
coughed the ball up three times already
in the playoffs and has consequently almost cost his team both games. If he continues to choke as the games get bigger,
Tennessee won't have a chance at the
championship.
Jacksonville Jaguars
Why you should root for them:Fred Taylor and Jimmy Smith are two of the most
explosive offensive weapons in the NFL.
Along with a punishing defense led by
Kevin Hardy and Tony Brackens, the Jags
are just plain exciting to watch.
Why you should root against them: To
amend my last statement... they are just
plain exciting to watch, when they are

Swimmers emerge for last month of season
after intense training session in Florida
By Becca Howes-Mischel
Phoenix Staff
While most of the Swarthmore student
body was finishing off their winter breaks
at home or with friends, the swim team
traveled to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for
a ten day training trip. The first impression of those who were mired in sub-Arctic Northern temperatures might have
been "Oh poor babies, why can't they swim
here at school?" The truth, though, is that
the Florida training trip is far from just a
chance to tan.
Each morning at 5 a.m., the swimmers
were awoken so that they could be at the
pool by six to swim for two hours. This
training session was followed by weights
and then another two hour session in the
afternoon. All in all, some swimmers figured out that the swim team spent 36 hours
working out in thenine full days that they
were there.
Traveling to Florida gave swimmersthe
incentive (warm weather) needed to put
in all those hours, but it also had another
important benefit. Fort Lauderdale is full
of Olympic sized 50-meter pools (twice the
length of our pool) for added yardage to
get the swimmers in terrific shape for conferences at the end of February. By the
end, eachand every muscle ached and the
swimmers were counting down the practices until they could leave.
This year, it was not only the practices
that killed the swimmers' bodies. The
dreadful flu that has hit most major cities
also attacked the swim team.
By the end of the trip, ten swimmers (a
third of the team) had missed at least one
practice and people were wondering who
would be next. Even with all the sickness
and peril, coach Davis commented that
"this was the best training trip in a long
time."
The trip was not just achy muscles and
fevered coughs. On this training trip
people like Brent Wasser 'OO, Mari
McCrann 'OO, Alissa Parmalee 'Ol, and
John Lillvis 'O3 had some amazingly fast
practices, utilizing the training time to
vastly improve their potential for the meat
of the season. Swimmers were not only
moving fast in training but also against
elite club team Sunrise Seahawks, whom
Swarthmore beat in an informal competition.

NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN | Phoenix Staff
out about

John Lillvis

takes a breath after a grueling workout.The swimming team worked
thrity-six hours over the course of spring break.

And what about the hours that the team
was not swimming? Well, they slept. But
at least it was in the sun. On one of the
days with only one practice, a group spent
an exciting afternoon on Miami's famous
South Beach. And a training trip would
not be complete without challenge sets.
Challenge sets originated as a light
hearted activity made up by Davis to distract the swimmers from the brutal workouts of the first Swarthmore training trip.
Now each team member is given a challenge set based on what the rest of the
team thinks is an amusing part of their

personality.
The team always ends the training trip
on a humorous note as they see another
side of their teammates. Highlights from
this year included Chris Bussard 'O3 attempting to single-handedly act out all the
characters in a series of movies, Claire
Arbour 'OO explaining Genesis in terms of
the origin of swimmers, McCrann's belly
telling a moral story about the value of

teamwork, Wasser giving stream of con-

sciousness musings about his surroundings and Jason Kerensky 'O3 and David
Whitehead 'O3 staging a WWF-style wrestling match poolside.
In the end, the sun, strenuous practices
and challenge set levity jelled the team
for the final and most important works of
their season. The swim team left the
sunny beaches of Florida to return to
Swat's pool for their daily practices. The
edge gained from their training in Florida
should carry the team through their last
month of the swim season which culminates at the Centennial Conference on
February 18-20.
Upcoming home meets include this
Wednesday (1/19) against Johns Hopkins
at 5:30, this Saturday (1/22) against Drew
at 2 P.M., next Wednesday (1/26) against
Bryn Mawr, and next Saturday (1/29)
against Gettysburg at 2 P.M. The women's
team starts this semester undefeated at
6-0 while the men start at 4-2.

Wrestling team trains in Virgin Islands
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff
The Swarthmore wrestling team took
training in paradise to a new level during their winter break trip to the U.S.
Virgin Islands of St. John's and St. Thomas. While enjoying the pristine setting,
the wrestling squad's training trip combined two-a-day training with culture and
diplomacy.
Each morning, the team trained on a
different beach, including world renowned Magen's Bay and Morningstar
Beach, running and doing drills such as
beach sumo wrestling and water sprints.
Les Fox 'O2 said, "I really enjoyed the
beach sessions. It was exciting to have
the opportunity to train in different locations and see the different beaches."
In the afternoon, the team practiced
with the Virgin Islands national team,
which includes formerAmerican national
champion Shaun Scott, a volunteer guide
for the trip and the island's representative to FILA.

One of the main purposes of the trip was

to collaborate with the Virgin Islands
Wrestling Federation to promote wres-

tling on the islands.
Another one of Swarthmore's guides on
the trip was the president of the federation, Ivan David. Swarthmore head coach
Ron Tripak conducted the combined practices for the national team and the Swat
wrestlers.
In addition to the daily practices, the
team also put on a clinic demonstrating
four different styles of wrestling for a local high school. The clinic was attended
by nearly 350 students and wrestlers who
cheered nearly every move the wrestlers
made.
The team also had the opportunity to
immerse themselves in local culture, enjoying the local cuisine, which included
saltfish and beef pates and conch soup,
and shopping for local goods. In addition,
the team spent their leisure time snorkeling, playing cards on the beach and doing
general team bonding.
"It was really an amazing experience,"

said captain Jesse Bean 'OO, "So many of
the people we met were professionals who
went for vacation and just stayed. After
a week there, I could definitely understand why."
The team returned to Swarthmore for
several more days of training, and then
wrestled in their own invitational tournament.

Dan Jacobs 'O3 made the finals in impressive fashion, taking second place in
his first tournament as a Swarthmore
wrestler. Swarthmore's other placer was
Ted Chan 'O2, whose only two losses were
to a Division I opponent. The team placed
Bth overall out of thirteen teams in the
tournament, which was won by York College.
All in all, the last month has been an
exciting one for the Swarthmore wrestling
team, who returned from St. Thomas
tanned, fit and well-prepared for the Centennial Conference portion of their schedule.
The team has a 3-1 overall record entering league competition.

Garnet morale low after winless winter break
By Ben Park

Phoenix Staff

The Swarthmore men's basket-

ball squad (1-2 in the conference,
2-10 overall) entered winter vacation with a two game losing
streak and proceeded to lose four
more games in a weeks span.
Add in the Garnet's 86-54 loss to

the University of the Sciences in
Philadelphia the first week back
and the result was a demoralizing seven game tailspin.
Interviews with four of the
team's five sophomores, two of
which are in the starting lineup,
present a picture that is quite
bleak. Although one would hope
that spending a couple of weeks
practicing and relaxing together
would increase the sense of team
unity, this winter break turned
into the lowest point of the season for our Garnet Men.
The participants of this interview were guard Isaac Cohen (10
games), center David Gammill
(8.6 ppg, 5.2 rpg), guard Mike
Jeffries (5 games), and forward
Kyle Lewis (8.2 ppg, 5.7 rpg).
Parts of this interview have been
cut for the sake of printing
length.
Q. So Kyle, what did you guys
do over the break?
KL. What did we do? Played a
lot, practiced a lot, slept a lot.
Hung out together. [A chuckle.]
Bonded.
Q. When you say "bonded",
what do you mean?
KL. I don't know, man. We
watched movies, worked, did ev-

erything together. A pause. We

talked, shared our intimate feelings. His last comment is said

with a smirk and ends with a
laugh.
Q. So how are you guys playing right now?
KL. Well, we're on a seven
game losing streak. We should
have won (against Vassar). We
were leading in the last minute
of that game. We've been leading in the last minute in about
five of our games. If games
ended a minute earlier, we'd be
6-6 (instead of 2-10).
Q. Were you guys prepared for
those games? Should you have
won?
KL. We were prepared, and we
should have beaten Waynesburg.
The game against Waynesburg
was the second of the tournament, and the Garnet lost 77-64.
Joe Culley 'OO scored 16 points
and grabbed 9 rebounds.
Moravian was good. I thought we
were prepared, but since we lost,
I guess we weren't. The Garnet
lost to Moravian 71-54. Culley
scored 14 and pulled down a
game high 19 rebounds.
Q. What is at the root of the
seven game losing streak?
DG. Gammill turns around
from his desk on his huge black
swivel chair. Nobody's playing
relaxed.
Gammill's comment explains
the 18.4 turnovers a game the
Garnet has averaged in theirlast
5 games. Swarthmore lost
against Dickinson 54-68 although
they were tied 33-33 at the half,

and Vassar defeated the Garnet
51-47. As Gammill opens up a
package of string cheese and a
bottle ofroot beer, Lewis decides
to say some more about the
team's trip.
KL. We drove up, played at 8
p.m., got back to the hotel and
slept for seven hours, wokeup at
8 AM, had a shoot-around, ate
brunch, and then played a horrible team and lost.
DG. I heard that the last time
Swarthmore went to the
Moravian tournament they were
caught in this huge snowstorm
and were snowed in for 3 days
at their hotel. At another hotel
nearby the Orlando Magic and
Seasame Street Live were also
snowed in, since pretty much
everything, including the
interstates were closed. Apparently there was a picture of Shaq
sitting in the lobby with Big
Bird.
Q. Did you guys do anything
else over the break?
At this point the pizza Jeffries
ordered comes in and we all
move to the common room to
talk. Isaac grabs a slice of pizza
and sits down.
Q. How's the season going,
Isaac?
IC. Player moraleappears to be
at an all time low right now. I had
a good time at Perkins, though.
The brownies there were the best
part.
KL. They had frosting on them.
That's essential.
IC. Oh. Joe had an amazing

Following the game, the team,
accompanied by coaching staff,

hosted by Walter and Zan
Cochran-Bond. One Hollywood
insider, who chooses to remain
anonymous, spotted a famous
face in the crowd and among the
hoop team members after the
game. Richard Lewis, stand-up
comedian and major motion picture actor, congratulated the Garnet team on their amazing defensive effort and offensive showing.
Lewis singled out sophomore
guard Katie Tarr for her ability
to take a charge, quipping that he
called his agent "to get that girl a
contract."
Overall, the women's basketball team had a glamorous cultural experience on their California trip, and gained valuable experience for a potential run at the
conference title. Swarthmore is
currently 3-0 in the Centennial
Conference and 7-6 overall. They
are currently leading the Eastern
Division.

Garnet net airtime in L.A.
By Christina Ciambriello
and Caitlin Ryland
Phoenix Staff
The Swarthmore women's basketball

team took Hollywood by storm over winter break. The lady bailers started the new
millennium with a week-long trip to California. During their tour of southern Cali-

fornia, the women hit the major sites of
Los Angeles, including live tapings of the
"Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and the new
game show "21."
After landing VIP passes and having
their photograph taken with Jay, the
women scored some airtime on Leno's
show.Leno spoke to the women during his
opening monologue and part of the team

was broadcast worldwide. He likened
Swat's pathetic excuse of a mascot (a.k.a.
the Garnet Tide) to New and Improved
Tide and the name of a John Tesh album,
which is still better than "that small all
girls school upstate." Despite Jay's teasing, the women had a great time at the
show.
Unfortunately, "21" turned out to be a
disappointment, and a long one at that.
("21" is NBC's rather feeble attempt to
jump on the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" bandwagon.) The team did have
their picture taken withMaury Povich, the
daytime personality and game show's
Philadelphia-schooled host, which made
the whole five-hour "21" debacle worth
their while.

The women also strutted their stuff in
Melrose and saw the hilarious skits and
improv comedy genius of The
Groundlings, a group that feeds into Saturday Night Live. The list of former
Groundlings boasts several SNL greats,
including the current cast members Cheri
OTeri and Will Ferrell. The women were
treated to refreshingly ripe humor, a
change from the all-too-often drab material of most comics. The team was even
mentioned in the evening's script.
Of course, no trip to California would
be complete without a trip to the beach.

Super Bowl contenders

Off his Rocker
JohnRocker was right. New* York is the
vile cesspool of human civilization. At
least us Beantowners believe so. We bash
the Big Apple in just about every possible
way, but we know there's just some places
you just don't go. Even crass, foulmouthed Philly fans know that. Rocker
crossed the line when he insulted immigrants, gays, blacks and just about every
other minority group in his crusade
against New York.
Really, I could put together an amusing section just by listing Rocker's
quotes. The bigotry and sheer stupidity
is so farfetched and idiotic that it really
is humorous to someone who understands
prejudice and possesses the ability to dismiss things with a laugh. Sports fans
know it's all right to chuckle when someone is moronic enough to say and believe
something like, "Asians and Koreans and
Vietnamese and Indians and Russians
and Spanish people and everything up
there. How the hell did they get into this
country?" We know there will be NAACPs
and righteous reverends to raise hell in
the wake.
Athletes who make controversial comments brighten up my day. If Rocker
could tone it down and do it the way
Charles Barkley did it, it'd be cool. I mean,
it was funny when Barkley said, "This is
one of those games that makes you want
to go home and beat your wife." Or when
he suffered a career-ending injury and
quipped "Just what America needs, another unemployed black man."
Of course, in terms of being quotable,
Barkley had the advantage of being black,
which means there are a lot more things
you can say without being crucified by the
Rainbow Coalition. But if you want to be
controversial and quoted, then you have
to stay within the boundaries. Like with
Barkley, you will have your share of militant critics, but when you push the line
without crossing it, people will enjoy and
respect your personality.
Rocker is paying the price, and will continue to for the duration of sports fans'
memories (about an hour for a Philly
sports fan, 81 years and counting for a
Boston fan). He's being forced to see a
psychologist. He's had to apologize profusely, and of course, no man worth his
jock strap likes apologizing. There's not a
city he can go to now where he won't be
pelted with insults and, the ever-classy
New Yorkers' projectile of choice, batteries. The band Twisted Sister, protesting
John Rocker's comments disparaging
gays and minorities, has asked the Atlanta
Braves to stop using their song I Wanna
Rock to introduce the reliever. No I
Wanna Roc/c?!? That's like Ricky Vaughn
without the horn-rimmed glasses and Wild
Thing. That's like tats without tits. That's
like the Cleavers with no Beaver.
Most people just want this Rocker to
complete his 1999-2000 Hot Stove League
Apology Tour and fade away into obscurity. Personally, I think he can still be
saved. Instead of continuing to brazenly
attack minority stereotypes, he should
shift to the one he can best empathize
with: the tobacco chewing, wife-beater
wearing redneck love child of two first
cousins.
