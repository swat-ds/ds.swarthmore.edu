I COVER STORY

Endowment tops
$1 billion Friday
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
The college's endowment topped $1 billion for the first time last Friday.

According to college treasurer Sue Welsh, the endowment consists of
money given by donors over the years to support new or existing programs at the college. The money is then invested in such a way that it
continues to produce enough money to pay for the intended programs
each year. "It's been great to go over the $1 billion mark," Welsh said.
As of June 1999, the end of the college's fiscal year, Swarthmore's endowment was the tenth largest in the nation in terms of endowment per
student, and thirty-ninth in terms of total endowment.
Both the president of the college and the Board of Managers have a
role in deciding how earnings from the endowment will be used. An investment committee that is part of the Board of Managers handles the

Andy Alderete runs a popular MP3 server from his dorm room computer using a file-sharing program
called Hotline. Hotline enables anyone to download music from individuals' computers, but it and
similar programs have been using a disproportionate amount of the college's bandwidth.

Computing Center imposes
bandwidth limits on Internet use
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
The Computing Center's ongoing efforts to crack
down on misuse of Internet bandwidth access culminated Tuesday in the announcement of plans to
begin limiting such access in the next few weeks.
But the root issue behind the move
the question
of just how much access to information to provide
students is far from being resolved.
Since the capacity ofthe Internet began expanding
at a dizzyingrate last year, allowing for functions such
as quick downloading of MP3s and free long-distance
calling, many universities haveinstituted policies similar to Swarthmore. All rely upon a device called a bandwidth shaper released this summer. The shaper allows
colleges to limit each person's Internet usage to a certain kilobit level. In the case of Swarthmore, this
amount is 128 kilobits per second (Kbps).
"It's twice the speed of the highest speed modem you can buy," said Manager of Networking Systems and Telecommunications Mark Dumic.
"The average student will never use the 128
Kbps," Director of Information Technology and
Services Judy Downing added.
Yet for some perhaps less average students,
the new policy has immense implications. Andy
Alderete 'O2 began running a server of music files
from his dorm room last fall. The server used an
application called Hotline, similar to other music
downloading applications such as Napster and
Scour, that allows people to access his MP3 files
and download them onto their computers using
Swarthmore's bandwidth. At the time, he said, it
didn't occur to him that his efforts could bring
massive repercussions.
As his site grew in popularity, however, the
people in the Computing Center began to take notice. "It got to be so popular that I got an e-mail last
spring saying that I was using over 60 percent of
thebandwidth ofTri-Co," Alderete said. Last spring
Haverford, Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore shared one

T-l line, which provided a total of 10 megabits per
second to the three colleges.
Alderete said at that point he had little control
over the amount of bandwidth that his server used.
"The connection was so good here, that of course
people were going to hop on my computer and start
downloading stuff, and I can't limit the amount of
traffic," he said. His server is now listed on the
Hotline site as one of the most visited sites in the

world.

Meanwhile, he was enjoying the opportunities
that operating the server provided him: instant and
free access to all types of music and discussions
about music with people from around the world.
"It's given me a really incredible musical perspective on things; it's given me the ability for me to
talk to people about musical ideas," he said.
Alderete was warned to reduce his bandwidth
use or risk losing Ethernet access. He kept running
his server throughout the summer. This fall,
Alderete claims that Computing Center employees
began routinely monitoring his bandwidth use and
blocking the ports he used for his server with a
device called a firewall. Now the server is still in
operation, but Alderete said that because of the
firewall the server's downloading speed is significantly slower and he has lost 60 percent of its cli-

ents.

Dumic said that only a very few students on campus use a disproportionate amount of the college
bandwidth. While the computing center has used
methods of preventing misuse such as firewalls for
months, he said that the college decided to move to
the uniform 128 Kbps limit after finding it to be a
much more effective and fair method of preventing

unequal bandwidth distribution.
The advantages to using the bandwidth shaper,
according to Dumic, are that it allows the center
to enforce equal distribution without monitoring

task of investing and managing the endowment itself.
About $33 million of what the invested endowment has earned will be
spent this year, Welsh said. Although a portion must be used for specific
purposes designated by the donors, the majority goes to support the regular program of the college.
Last year, for example, the endowment, then worth $906 million, provided for the equivalent of the salaries of 68 faculty members and the
equivalent of $9,000 in scholarships per aided student, among other things.
The endowment also provides funds that are allotted each year by the
College Budget Committee.
"Everyone always asks if we can just take some of the money from the
endowment and do something with it," said Welsh. "And the answer is,
we are doing something with it."
Welsh said that when making decisions about how the endowment will
be used, there is a constant search for a balance between present and future needs. The college spends enough to provide for the needs of the current college program, but avoids excessive spending that would jeopardize future growth of the endowment.
"We have [the endowment] designed in such a way that it will provide
in perpetuity, so that future generations here will have the same advantages from the endowment that present ones do," Welsh said.
The large endowment is a major reason that the college can afford to
remain small, yet still offer the resources it does, she said. "If we didn't
have an endowment and we wanted to still do everything the way we do it
now, we would have to charge over $50,000 a year with no financial aid."
"It is exciting to say that we have so much money in our endowment,"
said Delonte Gholston, student observer of the Board of Managers. "[But]
the more money we get in the endowment, the higher students' expectations are for how that money will be spent." He termed the results a "grabbag mentality" on the part of students.
"It's misguided to look at the endowment as a pot of gold available for
the student body. It just isn't," said Gholston. "Instead, it is important for
students to remember how much has been done to enhance student life in
the past through existing channels such as Student Council and the Board
of Managers."

THE HISTORY OF THE ENDOWMENT
Since the college began tracking the growth of its endowment in
1950,the market value has risen from $10.7 million to $1 billion,
as of last Friday. The growth has not come without thought,
however, in the past three decades, the college has made a
number of strategic moves, including increased investments in
the stock market and portfolio diversification, that have
dramatically increased the growth of the endowment.

Activists coordinate efforts
BYGERRITHALL
Many of Swarthmore's activist
groups will meet Saturday at 5:00 p.m.
to discuss the nature of the activist
community on campus. This marks
the second in a series of meetings designed to increase communication
among such groups.

Chela Delgado 'O3, who organized
the meetings, hopes to create a stronger network of the activist groups on
campus while allowing the individual
groups to retain their autonomy. The
meeting will concern the structure of
the network along with the level of

commitment from the various campus groups.
"Lots of our issues are connected,

but there has to be lots of different
types of activism," Delgado said.
The meeting will be held in the
Campus Resource Center. Although
it is open to everybody, Delgado said
it would probably not be meaningful
for first-years or outsiders to the
groups. It is expected to be heavy on
process and structure and also evaluative of past activism.
Delgado cited the attendance of 33
Swarthmore students in last year's
protests of the International Monetary Fund as an example of success-

ful past activism. Though critics have
argued that the protestors did not fully
understand the issues, Delgado felt that
they did struggle with them and found
the protest to be a very educational experience.

When the groups met for the first
time last Sunday, they questioned the
state of the activist community at
Swarthmore and began to brainstorm
goals for the coming year.
Representatives from most of
Swarthmore's activist groups were represented at Sunday's meeting. Though
some felt that the College Democrats
should not have attended because they
were chartered through an outside organization, the head of the group was invited. Still, the campus's conservative
and libertarian groups were not.
But, when asked about the meeting
of the primarily liberal groups, President of College Republicans David Thomas 'O3 was supportive.

"I'm not thrilled with their goals, but
I thinkit's great that they're organizing,"
he said.
"In the past, we've gotten criticism
that we're just a bunch of reactionary,
thoughtless, mindless liberals," Delgado
said. She said this is an unfair accusation and hopes that the meetings will
help show that the activists on campus
are a good balance ofthought and action.

Minors finally approved
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
After months of debate and modifications, a proposal to allow course
students to select minors was passed
by the faculty at the end of last semester, but the details of the plan
have yet to be worked out. The class
of 2004 will most likely be the first
group of students to have the opportunity to pick a minor without participating in the honors program.
Under the proposal, a student
would beallowed to have either a second major or up to two minors in
addition to a normal course of study.
The minimum requirement for a minor would be five credits of work.
The proposal would effectively
eliminate interdisciplinary concentrations, however, making them minors instead.
"The maximum amount of work
that students may do in the majorminor area is about 20 credits. Many

will do less than this," Associate Provost and Chair of the Curriculum
Committee Craig Williamson said.
The 20 credits could be acquired
through a double major or a major
plus two minors. "[This will still allow the students] to make unexpected
connections and serendipitous con-

nections," Williamson said.
While members of the Council on
Educational Policy initially hoped
that all of the details of this new
policy would be worked out by the fall
of 2001, the schedule for this is not yet

firm.

"In theory, the minors are coming.
In practice, I don't know when or for
whom," Registrar Martin Warner

said.
The class of 2002 will most likely
be subject to the school's current
guidelines, while the members of the
class of 2003 may or may not be allowed to choose minors outside of the
honors program.

Capital campaign over $70 million
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
The Swarthmore capital campaign will soon be stepped up as the
leadership council for the campaign
meets next Thursday. The campaign,
which has raised $72 million in
pledges since its initiation in July of
1999, will go toward the construction
of the new science center and a new

fesft

dorm and the renovation of Parrish,
McCabe and Tarble.

public relations, the college hopes to
raise $230 million by the campaign's
conclusion in 2006. He expects that
the bulk of this money will be raised
next year after a public announcement inviting outside donations is
made next September.

At that point, West said, "You start
talking very openly and aggressively
and inviting people to participate."
Now the campaign is still in its "quiet
phase," which means that West and
his staffhave been directly soliciting

donationsfrom alumni.
The science center is the first priority for the funding, West said. After the center is completed, construction will begin on the new dorm.
When the dorm is completed it will
serve as the temporary home for administrative offices while Parrish is
renovated. The final allocations of
funding will go toward the renovation McCabe and Tarble.
The renovations in Tarble may
mean the bookstore will be converted
to student space if another space can
befound for the bookstore, West said.

Council's plans for fall include constitutional change
BY JON EHRENFELD
On Monday evening Student
Council convened for its first meeting of the school year. The members
discussed several outstanding issues
as well as many initiatives to be undertaken this semester.
The first topic to be brought up
was the council's constitution. Having resolved earlier in the year to revise and amend the constitution, the
council began planning work on it.
The members had decided that it
neededrevision both to fill gaps that
were not covered and to change regulations regarding council positions.
The two co-chairs of the council
have traditionally been elected by
members of the organization itself;
underthe new constitution, they will
be elected by the student body. In addition, there will be an information
session planned for the whole campus in which students learn about the
new constitution and about Student
Council in general.

"The central focus of this all is that
we want to create a constitution that
is an integral and central part of campus," said co-chair Jordan Brackett
'Ol The council members agreed that
the constitution should be completely
amended before fall break.
Two other topics that were discussed at length involved Student
Council's involvement in politics.
The first proposal was for the council to urge students to vote in the upcoming presidential election and to
help procure absentee ballots. Since
not all the members agreed that they
should involve the council in politi-

cal matters, the matter will be discussed
further before a resolution is reached.
A campus viewing of a political debate and the possibility of staging student debates were proposed. Again, questions of political activity versus civic responsibility came up, necessitating further consideration of the idea.
It was, however, decided that a campus-wide study break, most likely for the
purpose of watching the Olympics,
should be held this semester.
In addition to these topics, two more
items ofnote were brought up before the
meeting moved on to discuss initiatives.
The first was the campus alcohol policy.
The deans have decided that the alcohol
policy should be reviewed, and if need
be, amended. In the near future, the Student Council will present a report to the
deans in which it outlines the current
policy, as well as a proposal for the future policy. The other matter brought up
was the formation of a residence hall
planning group for a new dorm that will
be built within the next four years.
On Sunday, the Student Council met
informally and made a list of roughly 40

initiatives that should be looked at this
semester. They ranged from preparing
a report on overall student wellness at

Swarthmore which would examine
Worth Health Center, psychological services, Sharpies food, dorm washing and
drying machines and other wellness-related services. Other ideas included extending McCabe's hours and providing
food or coffee there, cutting the cost of
books, and improving on-campus storage options. During the meeting on Monday, the council members quickly discussed each initiative and volunteered
to begin work on them.

Summer of Service program offers new internship opportunities
BY IVAN BOOTHE
It seems almost too good to be true: spending a summer
working with a service organization of your choice, and
receiving in return room and board for the summer, as
well as nearly $2,000 in stipend money. This was the offer
presented to students last spring as part of the Summer of
Service pilot program.
When students consider asking for grants for service
projects, most think of the Swarthmore Foundation. There
are important differences between the Foundation and the
Summer of Service, however. "The Foundation made community service possible for students, but it didn'taddress
the summer earnings requirements," said Pat James, di-

rector of community service learning.
In addition to housing, food, and transportation, participants in the Summer of Service program are given a prorated stipend (up to $1,850) based on the length of their internships. The stipend offsets the summer earnings requirement which many students must meet as a part of
their financial aid package.

ganization that advocates for domestic violence victims.
In the future, James hopes that the program will be able to
accommodate all students who want internships. She also expects the list of approved internships will grow beyond the
local area, allowing more students to work on service projects
in their hometowns. Eventually, James said, "Any student,
during one summer at Swarthmore, will beable to do one sum-

mer of service."

"Originally, there were two goals," James explained. "First,
you get the opportunity to do service, and second, you get opportunities to explore a possible career. Many of these organizations
can't afford to pay for internships." Students are thus able to
work in a non-profit or activist organization during the summer
without worrying about paying their college tuition in the fall.
If, after applying to a work site, a student is accepted by
that organization, the student then signs a statement of agreement describing the duties of the summer internship. Participants were also required to submit a report at the end of the

summer detailing their work.

a Summer of Service work site, however, and since Lindsey
had already obtained the organization's approval, she was
transferred to the Summer of Service program. She subsequently worked at the local chapter of the Pennsylvania
Abolitionists, which was busy preparing for the Journey
of Hope campaign, run by a national activist group that
travels to a different state each summer, holding protests
and rallies for the abolition of the death penalty. Although
the organization has a national network, the planning of
their visit is left up to the local chapter.
Lindsey said that since the Pennsylvania Abolitionists
only had one full-time staffperson, she spent the majority
of the summer doing the planning for The Journey of Hope
herself. She organized and attended the trip across Pennsylvania, visiting a different city each day for more than a
week. Participants in the Journey of Hope included families of murder victims who are opposed to the death penalty. The participants lead protests in Philadelphia and in
the state capitol, Harrisburg.

Through the campaign, Lindsey also visited the New
Meadow Run Bruderhof Community, an Amish group that
was hosting The Children's Crusade, a gathering of children from around the world to protest the death penalty.
The Journey culminatedwith a protest outside the SCIGreene Prison, Pennsylvania's largest death-row prison.
Lindsey is still working with the Pennsylvania Abolitionists, and is currently busy planning a protest at the
Philadelphia district attorney's office.
Without the Summer of Service, Lindsey said, "I would
not havebeen able to do this. I needed to make money over
the summer for college, and in fact, I still had a part-time
job at the Friends' Library."
She is very positive about the opportunities now available to students as part of the program. "It's a wonderful
program," she said. "It enables all students to work for nonprofit organizations."
If it had not been for the Summer of Service program,
"I would have had to go home and worked at an internship
there," said Lindsey. "It would have paid me a lot more
money, but it wouldn't have been fulfilling."

hadn't enforced the limit. Now with a different provider, the college's current level of

bandwidth is roughly equal to what it was
using then.

Others express concern that the network

registration program will allow the Computing Center to monitortheir online activities.
"Where's the freedom of doing things that
are personal? Where's the privacy?" Alderete
asked.

According to Dumic, students should not
worry about their privacy being invaded.
"We don't get very fine-toothed into looking
into what someone's doing on the Internet....
Do we have the capability of doing that? Yes
but it's not the way we're oriented. We're
not into being Internet policemen."
In the next few weeks, such concerns may
demand that the Computing Center officials
devote more time to justifying their actions
...

to students.
"I am definitely willing to admit that I am
one of the main reasons why the bandwidth
was limited to everyone, and I don't think
that that was fair necessarily," Alderete said.
"[The Computing Center] should have
formed some sort ofcommittee withstudents
to talk about possible mechanisms for dealing with this sort of issue, especially since
things like MP3s and other applications are

"We ran the policy by the students who
work in the computing center," he added.
Other administrative committees had a
role in the decision to move to bandwidth
shaping, but the initialrecommendation for
the policy was made by the Computing Center.

For Alderete, the recent changes seem
more a result of the urge to follow other
schools' lead than a response to a real need.

He cited the recent suit brought against
Napster for copyright violation (now on appeal) and postulated that many schools have
been quick to block ports or use bandwidth

shapers out of fear that they, too, will find
themselves in court. Out of the 29 colleges
in the Consortium ofLiberal Arts Colleges,
8 now block ports, and 14 use bandwidth
shapers.

For Swarthmore, though, Alderete said
he had hoped that the bandwagon phenomenon wouldn't catch on.
"Doing it because other schools are doing it doesn't make sense. I don't think that's
the nature of what this school was founded
on."

Students meet with dean to discuss dorm storage
Three students met with Dean of
the College Bob Gross on Friday to

discuss the oversight, convenience

and expansion of storage areas on
campus. The meeting was arranged
after several students reported the
theft of their belongings from storage areas over the summer.
According to Gross, the lack of
storage has become a perennial is-

daily Sharpies menus, a marketplace and funny professor quotes

years ago, secure storage in Roberts
was opened in response.
"No good deed goes unpunished,"
said Gross. "Each time you [add secure storage] you raise expectations
and create more of a demand, but
we will keep on moving forward."

A survey of current facilities
with the aim of opening a second

secure storage area and increased
oversight of non-secure areas by
Public Safety were among the solutions discussed, but no commitments were made by the dean.
"I don't feel anything concrete

had almost $lOOO of items stolen

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

When a few students from Amherst College saw Nii Addy 'Ol's
personal Web site a year ago, they were impressed enough to

propose that he build a site for Swarthmore. It would be based on
their own site, The Daily Jolt, and would prove a great resource to
his college community. Although those students made the same
proposition to other Swatties, including some members of the
Swarthmore College Computing Society (SCCS), Addy was the one
who followed through and began to build the home page, thinking
it was "a great idea for a fun site."
Addy enlisted the help of Josh Shakin 'O2 and Jeremy
Schifeling 'O3 and got to work. Swat's version of The Daily Jolt can
now be accessed at http://dailyjolt.com. All campus computers
connected to the Swarthmore network automatically connect to
Swarthmore's version of the site.
The Daily Jolt originated several years ago when two students
at Amherst College created a Web site that would give their fellow
students a central network of useful links, plus an online
community that would allow them to meet one another through
the Internet and exchange comments about life at Amherst.
The site took off, eventually giving rise to dozens of others of
its kind as its founders convinced students from other colleges
that The Daily Jolt would be useful at their schools, too. With the
basic features and appearance of the site already intact, other
students had only to customize The Daily Jolt for their colleges.
Now, through the efforts of its founders, Swarthmore can take
part in the action as its own version of the Web site premieres this
semester. The Daily Jolt offers a nexus of links and forums that
make it easy for Swatties to talk to one another online and find
the information they need without having to look too far.
The resources available through the site cover a broad
spectrum of entertainment, academics, sports and food. The local
weather forecast for the day flashes at the top of the screen, and
a menu of the daily Sharpies fare is not far below. There is also a
two-day broadcast of what's happening on campus, including
sporting events, lectures, performances, activities and films as
well as similar guides to events in the Tri-Co area and
Philadelphia. Humorous and political polls, along with
Swarthmore campus links, can be accessed as well.
Schifeling describes it as a "conglomeration of links" that
allows students to access all kinds of information and services
without having to connect to each Web site individually. He
acknowledges that the college news, weather reports, dining hall
menus, and lists of on- and off-campus events are all available
elsewhere, but emphasizes the fact that nowhere else is all that
information available through a single site.
The "online community" aspect of The Daily Jolt is its most
unique feature. Through a collection of forums, students can post
insightful or comical quotes from their professors or comments
about campus events.
Although Addy and Shakin said that they always need
assistance with maintaining the site, the best way for students to
contribute to The Daily Jolt is to make use of the site's links and
contribute to the online forums. "We've already got a lot of people
submitting quotes and events and links they want posted," Addy
added. "That's how to get involved."

A 'Net speed limit
The long-prepubescent Internet is now starting to
come of age. A long time ago (on the megahertz time
scale), the World Wide Web was invented to allow nongeeks to use the Net. The main problem back then was
convincing the non-geeks that using Mosaic to look at
text-only web pages was an interesting thing to do.
Now, because no one needs to be convinced, the
number of people surfing the Web is growing exponentially. That growth is starting to create more adult
problems, problems much more complex than the
purely technical ones like standardizing HTML or
assigning domain names.
If the Internet had no value to society other than its
technical merits, there would not be a browser war and
an antitrust case, there would not be lawsuits against
Napster and there would not be an Internet speed limit
at Swarthmore College. But because people have come
to depend on access for work and pleasure, regulation
of their activity for the common good is appropriate.
Many decades ago, before lots of people owned cars,
there was no need for speed limits. But when the number
of cars reached a critical level, governments stepped in to
create them. Ifyou were used to being able to speed with
no fear of prosecution, the new restrictions felt like an
intrusion into your own affairs almost like interfering
with a divine right. But while the new restrictions may
have seemed like a nuisance, people forget how many
more nuisances wouldresult without regulation: more
jammed traffic, more fatal accidents and more road rage.
With the introduction of a speed limit for Internet
connections at the college, Information Technology
Services (ITS) has taken a step that may now seem
unjustified and authoritarian. But after frequent network
slowdowns last semester and an seemingly insatiable
demandfor greater bandwidth, the problems would only
have gotten worse without the new regulation.
The speed limit applies only to the Internet and not
to traffic on the college's local area network, but it can
be enforced more rigorously than any kind of automobile traffic law. That fact should prevent mass slowdowns caused by the activities of a very few people.
And while Swarthmore's decision to impose the speed
limit may seem unjust, it is important to note that ITS is
being far less restrictive than those at other schools have
been. As Judy Downing, director of computing and
communications services, explained in an all-student email on Tuesday, Swarthmore could have chosen to block
access to specific sites Napster's, for example that
are associated with high volumes of traffic. Rightly, the
college chose the less authoritarian approach.
And laying aside any moral issues, the decision to
impose a speed limit instead is by its nature more
proactive. Banning Napster will not stop the underlying activity of sharing ofMP3 files but simply shift it
to other competing systems. Imposing the speed limit
also makes high-traffic users aware of their demands
on bandwidth. Without such a restriction, many
people
through complete lack of knowledge
have
no self-incentive to reduce their Internet use.
Still, as Downing's e-mail notes, not all of the increase
in Internet traffic in the past academic year is due to the
bandwidth-hogging file-sharing activities of a few
students. Much of the increase is due simply to gradually
increasing demand in both academic and non-academic
settings
for "traditional" activities like web surfing and
e-mail. Because ofthat, the number the Computing Center
has chosen for the speed limit—l2Bkilobits per second
seems a bit slow at only two or three times better
performance than that available over a modem.
As technology improves and communication
gradually cheapens, the bandwidth requirements of
both academic and recreational Internet use will
inevitably increase. Although creating a system of
speed limits is a good first step, it is shortsighted to
assume the current limit will still be adequate next
year or even later this semester.
Consequently, another essential part of the college's
computing policy should be purchasing more total
bandwidth when that becomes necessary. Sometimes,
the only solution to traffic jams is just to add more
lanes to the superhighway.

The cleansing of Parrish Hall
BY TIM STEWART-WINTER

The sprucing-up of Parrish has gone too far. Yes, the carpeting and furniture in Parlours needed replacing, and yes,

the Rose Garden entry is better now that there is an indoor
waiting area.
But as you may have noticed, a new policy this semester
forbids putting up posters anywhere but on bulletin boards.
It's true that I'm a cranky seniorwho doesn't want things to
change, but I honestly feel that one of the most appealing,
comforting qualities of the college is being reined in.
Sure, it's a gorgeous campus, and there's lots of amazing
education happening in the classrooms, and lots of cool
people to meet in the dorms, but perhaps the thing I find
most distinctive about this place is the display of promotional zeal all over the first floor of Parrish.
Bulletin boards showcased every conceivable student
group, and an unruly array of posters dotted every surface
that was remotely close to eye level. Swatties have posted
signs on doors, door frames, walls, moldings
everywhere
you can imagine, except for glass door panels, which were
always off-limits.

The posters were aesthetically pleasing, but they were
also practical. They notified students about events and activities. They reminded administrators and professors of
what was on students' minds. They indicated that students
and professors collaborated with incredible frequency in
bringing speakers and performers to campus
a unique

feature ofSwarthmore. Sometimes the posters got torn down;
last year, there was even a poster campaign to raise awareness about the fact that a group's signs were being torn down

systematically.
The new policy has several effects. One is that it probably makes cleaning the first floor easier for the Parrish
housekeepers. It's true that no one ever took down their old
signs when their event was over, and in that respect, the
intentions behind the new policy are laudable.
But there was never any effort at an intermediate step. I
would have volunteered to help take down old signs on a
regular basis, or to require signs to be dated, if it meant signs
could still go up every which way.
A second effect is that students now have to try harder to
find out what's going on. Only people who are really committed and plan ahead will get their act together to attend things.
One campus activist recently told me she simply expects that
turnout will be lower this year than in the past. Is it true? I
don't know. But I think it matters; it's worth thinking about.

The third and most important effect is that the policy
changes the way Parrish feels. The first floor of Parrish is
the nerve center of the college; everyone passes through it.
The newly barren Parrish walls make this seem more like a
place where you'd send your kid to make them into a respectable citizen. It doesn't look anymore like a place where
you'd send your kid so they could be curious and be part of
a lively community, and possibly even deconstruct the notions of respectability and citizenship.

The failure of American politics
How one libertarian turned his back
on liberalism, modern government
and the traditional two-party system.
BY BENJAMIN R. GEORGE
I have given up on calling myself a "liberal" only reluctantly. The label had come to me naturally: I grew up being told that the world was divided into "liberals" and "conservatives," represented by the two great political parties.
The conservatives were the ones who wanted to protect
me from sex and violence in the media and infringe on my
right to freely practice my lack of religion. This made them
seem a lot worse than the liberals, the main criticism of
whom was that they wanted to take all of my money and
squander it. Since I was fortunate enough not to have to
worry about money much, I didn't think about this.
Also, since thefirst "conservative" figure I learned about
was President Reagan, whenever I did think about this
squandering, it seemed more like an intrinsic feature of
the system than a problem with the liberals. If anything,
the liberals deserved kudos for at least exercising some
honesty about their practices with other peoples' money.
Even as I grew more and more skeptical of the liberal
position on things like the drug war and the Social Security entitlement, I clung to the term, groping for reasons to
do so with diminishing success didn't its Latin etymology bespeak its ideals? Even if that couldn't be trusted,

didn't it invoke the nobletradition of JohnLocke? Even if
it associated me with some questionable views, wasn't it
at least easy on the tongue? Wasn't this the way to distinguish myself from the abortion-banning, bible-thumping,
execution-ordering, flag-extinguishing alternative?
I began to see less and less of a point in rationalizing this way. The more I actually followed American politics, the more it became clear that the question being debated was not whether to run my life
but how to run my life.
The former issue struck me as much more important than the latter. Maybe you've heard the old
one-liner
"If we can just get the Republicans out
of our bedrooms and the Democrats out of our wallets.
That sounded like a pretty good sug..."

gestion.
As I read more, I discovered that I was

not alone. I'd heard the opening of the Declaration of Independence repeated as a cliche countless times, but at some point I
began to actually think about what it meant
about the idea
that governments are instituted not to implement elaborate plans
for economic and moral order, but for the simple purpose of defending people against forcible infringements of their freedom
and safety.
I noticed that, unfortunately, this idea seemed to have faded
from the political limelight. Eventually, I discovered that people
who thought about these sorts of things the way I did were called
"libertarians," and that some ofthem had founded a smallbut philosophically consistent political party that got state legislators and
mayors elected here and there.
They were willing, indeed eager, to ask not how but whether to
run my life, and they wrote entertaining press releases, too. Somehow I've since gotten into the habit of subscribing to their mailing

lists and occasionally working on their ballot access drives and
contributing to their campaigns.
Maybe I've just been sucked into a fringe movement because
of some psychological weakness or puerile foible on my part. The
most likely culprit would be my low tolerance for hypocrisy.
Social Security may be the largest and fastest growing
single economic redistribution policy in the history of civilization, and this handout targets one of the wealthiest demographics in the country. Needless to say, both major parties have for
years supported the program with a fervor bordering on religious devotion. This is compassion for the poor? This is small
government?
Liberal politicians seem every bit as eager to pass internet
censorship laws and tell me what chemicals I can and can't put
into my body as the conservatives do. Is this their idea of protecting our civil liberties?
The conservatives have frequently led the way in offering
generous subsidies to large corporations. Is this what they call a

free market?
The government isn't doing this because of soft-money campaign contributions or because it's succumbed to a society-wide moral decay it's doing it because modern politics has come to rest on the basic assumption that the
natural order of things is and should be about bullying,
taxation and giving and taking orders under threat of
force.
I've seen the kind of government that this sort of assumption produces. In fact, I live under one it seems to
think that paperwork builds character and employs
thousands of people with guns who seem to think
they're my parents. I could do without that.

A PRO AND
A CON

Being at Swat not
just about studying
The fabled "clean slate" of college is almost as
much of an urban legend as the fabled "helpful
Swarthmore Career Planning and Placement Office."
I reminded myself as I walked up the sparkling, hallowed steps of Willets freshman year that I was going to be someone new and different in college. And
it worked
for about five minutes.
As I've moved through my four years here at
Swat, I've come to realize how futilethe attempt to
become someone or something wholly different
truly is. Oh sure, the microcosm that is Swat naturally intensifies evolution, exploration and extremism in our personalities. But, in a very Taoist sense,
try as we might, we can't change the fundamental
nature of our being through sheer will. In fact, I
think Swarthmore is counting on it.
There is a place here where people know a great
deal about you. No, I won't talk in trite platitudes
about the small size of the school (that's for Emilia
Pastor to lament in her dating column); I'm talking
about the Admissions Office.
Remember how you wrote that embarrassing essay on why you named your stuffed teddy bear
Kandinsky? Or how you wouldn't live if you
couldn't play croquet? Remember how you said in
your interview that you yearned for Lincoln-Douglas (LD) debate and would never, ever be happy
unless you could be king of the debaters at
Swarthmore?
Oh yes, those ridiculous files and statements went
somewhere, and the people that read them over and
over again are still here. Even though you might not
know them, the admissions folksknow you, and they
know quite a good deal of you at that.
Yet, to what I'm sure might be the chagrin of those
people who listened to your aspirations and hopes,
you haven't been to the art museums to see
Kandinsky. You threw away your croquet outfits.
And now, insteadof wanting to be king of the debate
nerds, you roll your eyes when someone goes
...

"LDork" in your political science class.
It is for that reason that you are totally lame in
my eyes. Don't get me wrong; I quit the only thing I
was marginally talented at for a new activity at Swat.
I understand that preferences and affinities change
as we ourselves do.
So it is with sympathy that I must break this to
you: if you were an all-American football player for
four years in high school, there are probably quite a
few people here who are crestfallen that you decided
not to continue it. And if you were active in gay and
lesbian politics in high school, somebody was disappointed that you weren't at the QSA meeting last
week.
Swarthmore would be a boring place if we had all
of these wonderful activists, musicians, athletes and
knitters, only to see them forget who they were in
high school. Especially at a college in such great need

of (male) scholar-athletes, the sting of a quitter hurts

Each of us is here for a greater reason than an

to be. Put the book down and get active. Prove to

Animal rights: More than just tofu

Watching your
words at Swat
About five minutes after finding out that I had
this column, I decided, in a typically over-anxious
freshman way, to write it immediately. But what was
I going to write about?After five indecisive minutes,
I decided to ask some of my friends, among them one

who I'll call "John."
"Write about John getting raped by registration,"
John suggested.
Though eager to ask John abouthis problems with
registration, I was beat to a response by the two selfdescribed liberal girls in the room, whose disgusted
facial expressions said more than even their reactionary words. "You insensitive prick," screamed
one. "Have a little common decency or get out of our
room and don't come back!"
And it was right then that I rediscovered an entirely forgotten supply of my own nervous pre-frosh
fears. I remembered sitting in a room with my friends
and shrugging off their predictions for my coming
year. "You're in for it, Matt," one said. "The minute
you let down your guard, those crazy liberals are

going to lynch you."
"And you can't even use the word 'lynch,' because
it is 'evocative ofracist sentiments,' which makes it,
no matter how lightly you use it, evil."

"And you can't even use the word 'evil'..."
At the time, I shrugged off these harmless jokes
from my friends. I hardly believed that they would
have a much easier time at Yale or Brown. But beneath my stolid reserve lay a genuine fear of this
place, a fear that I had never thought about prior to
the summer: would I be able to be myself in college
without being attacked?
The answer, as demonstratedby the "The Torture
of John," was a definitive no.
No, I would not be able to make generalizations,
no matter how descriptive; no, I would not be able to
voice certain of my political opinions, no matter how
valid; no; I would not be able to make certain jokes,
no matter how harmless.
Many of you reading this right now (and I hope
there are many) are probably happy that I have these
fears. You probably desire an environment which discourages what you deem to be "insensitive" behavior.
My objection, however, is not the desire for such
an environment but rather the immediate, reactionary and minimally considered scorn you harbor, or
at least give the impression that you harbor, toward
those "insensitive pricks." I, in the spirit of tolerance,
can completely understand, sympathize with and
tolerate the reasons you react the way you do to insensitivity. I just wish you would do so in a sensitive, inquiring manner.
The two aforementioned liberal girls, rather than
inquire whether John meant any offense at all, simply assumed that he did. By calling him insensitive,
they assumed that he failed to consider their feelings. However, from my objective perspective, it was
they who failed to appeal to his sensitivities.
John, in fact, meant no offense; he was simply
using a phrase popular where he lives. One would
think that in a place in which social pressures and
influences are considered to the nth degree, a place
thatpreaches tolerance ofall viewpoints, that John's
statement would have been "tolerated." But it wasn't,
even after his defensive and apologetic explanation;
only my verbose defense of him diffused, without
ending, the situation.
So what have I learned from the "Torture of
John"? I already knew, as evidenced by my fears at
home, to expect such a situation at Swarthmore. My
sympathy for John, though, reminded me how much
I needed the support of others, just as John needed
mine. So, with this column, I pledge to examine issues, conflicts, situations and programs here at Swat
through an objective, non-judgmental lens.

Dea DelCampo Phoenix Staff

BY KRISHNA ALAYAN
I am a vegetarian. I am not a vegetarian because I am allergic to meat or because my cholesterol is out ofcontrol.
Instead, as a seventh grader, I had an
epiphany: it wasn't good enough to just
believe it was wrong to use animals for
food, clothing, entertainment or experimentation; I had to actively live what I
believed. For me, that meant my all-time

favorite restaurant, specializing in juicy

steaks from sirloin to T-bone to the ittybitty filet mignon, had to go.
Was this easy? Certainly not. Have I
regretted it for a second? No. Do I laugh
every time people make those clever "the
meat touched the potatoes, are you still
going to eat them" jokes? Not really.
Coming to Swarthmore gave me the
opportunity to more actively make a difference in the lives of animals by cofounding the Animal Rights Coalition
(ARC). As the first animal-rights oriented group on campus, I am over-

whelmed by the enthusiasm and by how
many ideas we all have.
Living a cruelty-free lifestyle is something everyone can and should do. Nobody has to throw out his or her brandnew I-wanna-be-Britney-Spears leather
pants within the next two hours. However, it is not difficult (believe it or not)
to incorporate the practice of shopping
for canvas, fabric or vinyl instead of
leather into your lifestyle, or of buying
beauty products that aren't tested on live
animals.
At Swarthmore, people may have difficulty seeing the value in spending time
on animals when there are so many
people in this world whose rights are
being violated on a daily basis. There are
very serious problems in the worldthat
need our attention, and cruelty to animals is one of them.
Suffering is something we should all
try to alleviate wherever we can; it is
important to help both animals and human beings. While humans, whether

oppressed or not, have a voice to some
degree, animals never have a voice. They
cannot vote, write autobiographies
about the horrors of their experiences

in labs and farms or talk about narrow
escapes from slaughterhouses. If we
don't educateourselves and raise awareness about the suffering animals are facing, who will?
Rather than spouting off statistics
and impressive-sounding numbers, I
would just encourage you all to come to
an ARC meeting. Educate yourselves,
expand your minds, eat Tofutti Cuties

and drink soy milk. Being a vegetarian
or a vegan is not a requirement; however, being curious, open-minded and
compassionate are definitely a plus.
Maybe inhaling plates full ofhamburgers and meatloaf aren't as absolutely necessary as you thought. Maybe. We encourage anyone and everyone to come. Just
think about the choices you make. Buy
animal-friendly products rather than ones

that test on animals. Live compassionately.

(U-WIRE) The state of California is making an offer that no
high school student will refuse.
Under a new law, signed by California Gov. Gray Davis Monday, any high school senior in the state who has a B average and
a yearly family income ofless than $64,000 will be eligible for full
tuition at any California State University or University of California campus. Further, if the student decides to attend a private
school, he or she would receive $9,700 toward the cost of the private institution.
That's not all. Students with a C average coming fromfamilies
making less than $34,000 annually will receive $1,500 in scholarship money. Families making more than $64,000 could also receive assistance, as students who achieve high scores on state
math and science exams couldreceive up to $2,500.
a state with a

population of more than 30 million—is making higher education
an entitlement for students who have the grades but do not have
the money. At an estimated cost of $1 billion a year, the plan is
ambitious; it is also the right thing to do.
Over the past two decades, the cost of a college education has
skyrocketed. In the United States an estimated 5.4 million students must support themselves through student loans.

Acknowledging this funding gap, California is taking a bold
action thatother states and thefederal government should mimic.
Not every state has the $l2 billion surplus that California has,
but the federal government should encourage other states to
develop similar programs and then offer to split the bill. This
proposal wouldmake a substantialdifference in the quest to make
higher education affordable.
Critics haveclaimed that this plan will result in lowered standards at academically selective public universities, but the opposite will likely be the case. If students who would normally have
been deterred by the high costs of college are able to apply, the
level of competition at selective schools will increase. The only
foreseeable problem with this plan is a ballooning enrollment beyond the capacities of the state's colleges and universities.
The plan is also in line with California's unpopular Proposition 187 whichbarred affirmative action based on race. This
law helps complete the shift from a race-based assistance system to an economically based system.
Although there may be students that abuse the system and
waste California's offer of free public education, a majority of
thestudents will take advantage of opportunities that were never
available to them.
Higher education is not a right in this country. But this proposal will make it available to more than just the privileged.

Swarthmore builds partnership in

Poland

Five students headed to Poland last spring for
the first semester of the college's new study
abroad program there. They studied dance,
theatre, engineering and environmental
science and returned to Swarthmore with a
new understanding of a country in transition.
By Sonia Scherr.
For Heather Weyrick 'Ol, it was a

directing class with theatre studies
professor Allen Kuharski that inspired her to participate last semester in a new foreign study program
in Poland.
"[Kuharski] did a pretty good job
of showing me that Poland was the
source of a lot of revolutionary theatre in the last half-century," she
said. "I wanted to see the society that
had given birth to such innovation.
I wanted to see what was happening today, to see if it was still so exciting."
A theatre studies and sociology
major, Weyrick was not disappointed after arriving in Krakow to
study Polish drama. Her impressions of Poland were of "a great,
underappreciated culture."
"There was an undiscovered gold
mine of philosophy and culture that
I never suspected existed," she said.
But Weyrick also gained firsthandknowledge of the way Poland's
communist past has shaped the
country and its people. "There's a
way that communism has changed
who they are," Weyrick said of Pol-

ish citizens. As a result of
communism's legacy, even when it
comes to the apparently ordinary
acts of daily existence
such as
shopping, getting married, or finding housing
"there's a totally different perspective on life than I ever
would have considered in America,"
Weyrick said.
In the end, however, Weyrick's
stay in Poland was more than an
education in dramatic literature or
an exposure to a region still marked
by its communist history. "I think
it leads to a broader understanding
of different ways of thinking,"
Weyrick said. "I think sitting down
at the dinner table and listening to
[my host family's] stories of communism and then telling my stories
about the United States, is somehow
important. It's the first time I made
a connection with someone so different than me."
Weyrick was one of five
Swarthmore students who participated in the inaugural semester of
the college's Poland program. The
program allows students majoring
or doing significant coursework in
theatre, dance, engineering or environmental studies to pursue their
disciplines in Poland for one semes-

ter.

"One goal [of the Poland semester abroad] is to have a foreign study
program linked to a student's major," said Kuharski, who co-directs

the program along with engineering
professor Arthur McGarity.
The program also aims "to provide students with the opportunity
to study in Poland and to take advantage of the connections we've
made with the faculty at the technical university ofKrakow," McGarity
said. "Students get an in-depth exposure to Polish language and culture."
The Poland program consists of
two distinct but related options: one

in dance or theatre and the other in

engineering or environmental studies. This spring, two Swarthmore
students participated in the former
program while three students took
part in the latter.
One unique aspect of the Poland
program is that it does not require
students to master a foreign language before they can study in a
non-English speaking country. With

the exception of required language
and culture classes, one-on-one or
small group classes are taught in
English by professors from Krakow
area universities.
"Engineers in the past

have had

a difficult time participating in foreign study," McGarity said. "Poland
has a different language and culture,
but students still get courses in environmental engineering."
Theatre and dance students faced

a similar quandary, according to
Kuharski. To take courses in their
discipline, they usually had to go to
England or Australia. "I personally
feel that it's most important for students to do foreign study in a country that does not speak English,"
Kuharski said. "A foreign study
should involve the challenge of confronting a foreign language."
The location of the college's newest study abroad program
in a
country that has been undergoing a
decade-long shift from communism
to capitalism
contributes to participants' educational experiences
both within and outside the classroom, according to Kuharski and
McGarity.

"The economic transition and

legacy of environmental problems
left behind from the Soviet era make
Poland a very exciting place to be
and to be studying the environment," McGarity said.
According to Kuharski, the country also offers a rich environment
for the study of theatre and dance.
"Poland is recognized pretty much

everywhere in Europe as one of the
most dynamic and artistic places for
contemporary theatre work," he

said.
Wlodzimierz Wojcik, who helped
teach several courses in the Poland
program and is the Cornell visiting
professor at Swarthmore for this
academic year, sees opportunities
for American and Polish students to
learn from each other through the
program. "Such contacts are much
more important to international
peace and understanding than any
other summits or agreements between government," he said.
While foreign study in general
has seen increased popularity
among Swarthmore students, according to an article in the December 1999 Swarthmore Bulletin, only
a small percentage of those students
are choosing to go to countries like
Poland. Nearly 40 percent of the
class of 2000 studied abroad, a twofold increase over the figure for 10
years ago; in the fall of 1999, out of
68 students studying abroad, only
three were in central or eastern

Europe.

Foreign Study director Steve
Piker said the Poland progam is also
important because, with the exception of the Grenoble program in

France, the college does not have a
tradition of running its own foreign
study programs. "The big significance is that Swarthmore faculty
and administrative resources are

being devoted to the development
and operation of these two foreign
study opportunities for our stu-

dents," Piker said. "With the exception of the Grenoble program, that
has not happened previously."
Although the program is supervised in Poland by people at universities there, Kuharski and McGarity
made short visits at different times.
Jim Harker '99 was also in Poland
to help coordinate the program.
One common link among students of dance, theatre, and engineering/environmental studies is

that they all must take language and
culture classes at the Polonia Institute of Jagiellonian University.
However, students tendto follow
different courses of study relating to
their own discipline. Students

ronment studies take classes taught

and engineering faculty thus converged to make the program a real-

ity. Administrators became in-

volved at that point, and "the support from Al Bloom made things
move rapidly," McGarity said.

Although there are no funds
available to bring Polish students to
Swarthmore, the program has nevertheless helped establish a two-way
exchange of sorts. In addition to

Silesian Dance Festival in June.

The Poland program was born in
July 1999 when McGarity, Kuharski,

Piker, and president Al Bloom went
to Poland to work out details of the
program with officials there.
But sources of inspiration for the
program have been in existence
much longer. McGarity spent the
1989-90 academic year on a Fulbright
scholarship at the technical university of Krakow. Kuharski was a
Fulbright scholar in Poland in the
early 'Bos and has worked for over
20 years with Poland and Polish theater.
In the spring of 1998, McGarity
renewed his contacts in Poland
when he returned to the technical
university of Krakow on another
Fulbright scholarship.
Also in the spring of that year, a
Cooper Foundation grant was approved to bring the Bytom-based
Silesian Dance Theatre to campus.
Dance professor Sharon Friedler
suggested the dance study abroad
program in Ghana could be a model
for a second program in Poland.

The interests of dance/theater

As for the students, they had a
variety of reasons for choosing to
participate in the new program,
ranging from the pragmatic
the
chance to get engineering credit
while doing study abroad
to the
excitement of pioneering a new program.
Because the technical university

of Krakow has a large engineering
program, for instance, students
were able to take environmental

engineering classes that are not offered here.
"I decided to go because it was
completely tailored to my interest in
environmental engineering," engineering major Fran Smith 'Ol said.
Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol, an economics major and environmental
studies concentrator, said he liked
the "spirit of being one the first
people, of paving the way for the
program."

Like several other participants,
social issues facing Poland also made
the country appealing. "It was interesting from the perspective of a society in transitionfrom a centrally

'

After arriving in Poland in January, the students embarked on indi-

vidual courses of study that depended on the program they were in.
All five took language and culture
classes that looked at Polish art, literature, and politics, among other
topics. Engineers Rakoff and Smith
took two engineering classes and an
environmental studies survey featuring a variety of speakers who lectured on policy issues. Dieringer
took the environmental studies
course as well as a tutorial on sustainable development with Wojcik.
Consisting of one to three
Swarthmore students and taught in
English, classes were not representative of the larger lecture classes
that Polish students encounter at
the university.
Although Rakoff said "it would
have been neat to have more of the
typical Polish student experience,"

with Polish professors, studying
Eastern European and Polish dra-

matic literature. Another critical
part of her program involved traveling around Poland to see theatre
performances. Weyrick synthesized
both aspects of her study in e-mails
she sent to Kuharski with critical
responses to the performances and
her class reading.
For Pike, who was studying
dance and living with a family in
Bytom, the Poland experience involved a semester-long internship
with the Silesian Dance Theatre, the
same troupe that came to
Swarthmore in 1999. Traveling with
the company when it went on tour,
she also took dance lessons with
company members, did outreach
work in arts administration, and
had the opportunity to speak with
company director Jacek Luminski.
She also did research on history of
the Silesian Dance Theatre and its

influence on contemporary dance in
Poland. Finally, in June Pike participated in the annual two-and-a-halfweek Silesian Dance Festival, which
attracts dance companies from multiple countries and features daily
dance performances and workshops.
"People's lives were centered
around dancing; they gave so much
of themselves to it," Pike said. "It's

have been difficult to arrange given
that most Swarthmore students arrived with no knowledge of Polish.
In addition, Rakoff said there
was no weekly schedule or regular
assignments, and textbooks were
used infrequently; instead the class
culminated in a final exam that students were supposed to be studying
for throughout the semester.
The engineering and environmental studies students took field
trips to relevant sites in Poland, including a working zinc and lead
mine. They also participated in a 10day trip to the Czech Republic,
where they visited national forests,

the country of Poland, with its recent communist past, was also significant to their study abroad experience.
During the 40 years that Poland
was dominatedby the Soviet Union,
there were continual shortages of
goods and limited access to the outside world. Then, in the late 1980s,
the rise of Gorbachev and
perestroika led the Soviet Union to
loosen its grip on its satellite countries. When free elections were held
in the summer of 1989, the communist government was ousted and the

A group of Swatties gathers in a room. Someone puts
on a CD. It's a normal scene.
But one guy exclaims, "You still use those things?!" ae
like someone has driven up in a Conestoga wagon. Everyone else stares blankly. Their MP3s are 'Bos one-hit-wonders that could never replace "real" music collections.
So the forward march of technology is making ragged
progress everywhere, even at this privileged liberal arts
school, where an offer of admission comes with an
Ethernet connection thrown in. Some Swatties think CDs
have already gone the way of papyrus (like the laser disc
fad of the late '80s); others want to know what an MP3 is.
Well, actually, that was a faculty member.
Still, the shift to MP3s is occurring, even if it is doing
so unevenly. Mark Dumic, Manager of Networking and
Systems for the college, points to a four-month period beginning last November when Internet usage on campus
more than doubled.
"We were able to determine that the biggest component of that growth was due to Napster and programs like
that," Dumic said.
For months now, the Recording Industry Association
of America (RIAA) lawsuit against Napster, the Internetbased MP3 trading program, has been poised to disrupt
the MP3 (r)evolution. But Napster and other file-sharing
programs aren't giving just the recording industry headaches; they've also been responsible for network problems
at Swarthmore.
Complaints about slow connection time abounded after the massive increase in internet volume last semester. And the culprit behind every reported slowdown was
a student hooked on Napster ora similar file-sharing service, with which one user can monopolize half of
Swarthmore's 10-megabit bandwidth, causing Internet traffic jams for the entire college community.

In the past, Dumic said, "each time someone complained
we had to, in a very manual way, figure out who was hogging
bandwidth." The offending students were then asked to curtail their use of file-sharing programs, and were in almost
every case cooperative and apologetic. But now Information
Technology Services (ITS) has a new way to deal with bandwidth hogs.
For the enlightenment of those of you who delete all reserved-student e-mails, Swarthmore has recently implemented
a bandwidth constrainer, a device set to limit the amount of
bandwidth available to any one Swarthmore Internet user to
128 kilobits per second (Kbps).
"We actually feel that's pretty generous," said Dumic. "One
hundred twenty-eight kilobits is twice as fast as the fastest
modem you can buy today. Most other colleges and universities are either outright blocking sites like Napster, or they're
doing what we're doing, which is buying something called a
bandwidth constrainer, but giving Napster a very small
amount of bandwidth."
A temporary measure at Swarthmore has identified several bandwidth-hogging applications, including Napster, and
is constraining these applications by bandwidth. Dumic is
unsure of the effect this is having on Swarthmore users downloading MP3s.
Nii Saka Addo 'O2, who has accumulated over 700 MP3s
over the past five years, is clearer on that issue. "If you are
using Napster, it will take you one hour to download just one
MP3 instead of 10 minutes or less like it was before," saidAddo.
It would appear that ITS has effectively beaten the recording industry to squelching Napster at Swat. Even so, Addo
supports the new policy.
"As I see it, it's a good idea," he explained. "The reason for
setting up this maximum is that people were misusing the
school's resources."
Of course, not every Swattie views the slow-down of
Napster traffic on the Internet highway as a positive change.
Tony Ortega 'Ol, who is rarely spotted without his portable
MP3 player strapped to his hip, has a different take on the

matter.
Ortega suspects that the school's new policy is a reaction to the copyright issues surrounding Napster. "I think
it's ridiculous that they would buy into the hype surrounding Napster," Ortega said. "Maybe it was true two years
ago that 128K was faster than anyone could connect at home,

but I evolve with the technology cable modems!"
Dumic insisted that although the college wouldrather
not see students being sued for illegally obtaining copyrighted material, legal issues are not really at stake here.
"We aren't trying to be [copyright] policemen," he said.
Instead, it seems ITS is satisfied with acting as the college's
Internet traffic controllers.
Students employed by ITS, who are well-informedabout
the bandwidth change, completely support the decision.
Steven Salter 'OO, dorm consultant coordinator, said that
128 Kbps "should be enough for anybody, for any curricular use."
PC Dorm ConsultantBeth Tsai 'OO added, "Students have
to realize that they should be very grateful that this school
is providing us with free and direct access to the Internet.
Students have to respect the fact thatacademic usage comes
first."
Academics first, MP3s second. It's a familiar refrain
around here.
At any rate, most students are not concerned about
whether they have Napster, no Napster or slow Napster.
Mark Dumic assured students that the bandwidth
constrainer will not affect the majority of students, who
never stray above 128 Kbps limit.
For most Swarthmore students, MP3s are an addendum
rather than the substance of their music collections. Some
cited the expense of portable MP3 players as the reason
they stick primarily to CDs. Regardless of whether Napster
sinks, swims or just manages to stay afloat, it looks like
well, at least for a while.
CDs are here to stay at Swat
Some just prefer the sound of ripping cellophane to the
tap-tap of the keyboard.

drink, which delivers just enough caffeine to
Blast! you out of any daze, slump, or sleep-deprived stupor. For you purists, there's also a
faux Blast!, a deßtast'ified version, if you will,
without the caffeine. Without a coupon, the
Blast! costs $2.59 for the regular size and $3.09
for the SuperScooper size, which, for my own
skittish composition, packs enough Blast! to
land me on the moon. I try to stick to the regular unless I'm really pushing the deep end of
the semester.
Getting to Baskin Robbins from Swarthmore
is a cinch if you've got a car: just a couple intersections up 320 toward Marple, and it's on the
right, in the strip mall next to Staples. Without a
car, getting to Baskin Robbins requires a minimum of creativity: just sweet talk the person
driving the van to the movie theater in Marple
to drop you off on the way and to pick you up
again on the way back. "It won't take long," you
promise. "I'll bring you a single scoop of whatever you want." I bet the driver will say, "Okay."
If you're feeling particularly generous, you might
offer the driver a Blast! of his or her very own.
These are the gestures that get rewarded later
by those great gods in the sky, believe you me.
Thus the Mocha Blast! at Baskin Robbins, it
seems, was destined to become a part of my life.
It offers much stability in this tizzy-inducing
whirlwind of life at Swat. I encourage you to
work the Blast! into your routine, as well. The
Blast!, both delicious and functional, makes for
an excellent study break. After all, you've got
to eat and more importantly, you've got to eat
dessert. The Blast! is a pleasure for the palate

'Bring It On' mindless but entertaining
BY MORGHAN HOLT
I have to admit, I was afraid. Very afraid. I approached this one cautiously, nay, begrudgingly, mostly because I didn't really intend to see it.
Due to a timing error, I wound up reluctantly slinking into the theater,
slouching into my seat, and preparing myself for the vapid horror to come.
I certainly didn't plan to spend my Saturday night in a theaterfilled with
cheerleading fans, staring at a screen filled with blonde bimbos contorting
their bodies with seemingly death-defying moves. Still, that's what I did.
And, sadly, it didn't grate on my nerves or make me tear out my hair. Surprisingly, I watchedfor the full one hour and 47 minutes without so much as
a yawn. Mindless as it was, "Bring it On" managed to entertain me.
The movie begins with the lovely, lithe Torrance (Kirsten Dunst) gleefully accepting her new position as captain of the San Diego Toros' High
School cheerleading squad. Apparently, at this particular high school,
receiving such an honor is even more highly regarded than being named
captain of the football team; this anomoly is due mostly to how horrible
the football team is. Toros fans don't come to the games to watch the
field. They come to watch the sideline entertainment.
Reigning national champions, the Toros' cheerleaders spend almost
every waking moment in the gym, perfecting theirroutinefor the upcoming competition. The team has recently accepted a misfit cheerleader, who
made the squad by merit ofher spectacular gymnastic abilities and not by
merit ofher peppiness or undying urge to cheer. Consequently, the other
girls on the team quibble among themselves, in shock over the new recruit's
negative, belligerent behavior. When Torrance threatens to kick her off
the team for walking out during practice, all hell breaks loose.
The rogue cheerleader recognizes their routines, not because she has

spent an enormous amount of time in the cheerleading realm, but because she's seen them performed better and with much more oomph before by the Clover cheerleaders ofOakland High. There's a crisis in cheerleader-world (and a near-throwdown) when the great mystery unravels
and Torrance discovers that the Toros' former captain, appropriately

named Big Red, has plagiarized the Clovers' routines.
The film hits its climax when Torrance needs to be true to herself and
follow her instincts instead offlipping her hair and agreeing with the rest of
squad, who've decided to proceed to the competition and try to blow the Clovers out of the water with their own routine, which, according to the Clovers'
captain (played wonderfully by a thugged-out Gabrielle Union), they "swiped,
put blonde hair on and called their own." At the same time, Torrance learnsof
her boyfriend's long-term fling and is forced to break up with him, altering
her entire existence and throwing her pristine world into total turmoil.
The team gets itself in gear and heads to Nationals with a perfectly
respectable act of their own. Still, their triumph within the dreadful disaster is not in constructing an original routine, but in proving that even
white girls, when called upon, can bring it on.
Which is not to say that they do it nearly as well. The Clovers put the
Toros in their place when they wow the judges and audience with an
amazing display ofback flips, handsprings, and so forth. In the face ofit
all, the Toros walk away with a sense of pride and accomplishment just
knowing that they have earned (and deserved) what they havereceived.
I split my sides laughing during this movie, and not just at the bimbo
comments spewed at astonishingly regular intervals from the mouths of
obtuse girls in short skirts. It was a genuinely funny show. I was mistaken in my initial cynicism. Some mindless humor, spiced up by occasional clever quips, was exactly what I needed to unwind.

high Fidelity

we love jonn uusacK, ana so snouia you.
When John Cusack grabbed our attention as lovable loser Lloyd Dobler in "Say
Anything," the classic late-'Bos teenage date movie, we collectively swooned. And
when he returned to prominence recently in "Grosse Pointe Blank" and "Being
you guessed it
John Malkovich," he played
a pair of quirky nice guys, and
everyone fell for him.
So it's no surprise that Cusack still has audiences sighing in his
latest romantic comedy, "High Fidelity," with his turn as Rob,
the owner of used-record store Championship Vinyl in Chicago. What is surprising (or perhaps not) is the maturity
and humor with which Nick Hornby's cult book has been
translated to film by director Stephen Frears.
Hornby's "Top Five" lists become the narrative structure of the film, with Cusack speaking directly to the
audience. And the music geek culture is portrayed faithfully and hilariously by Jack Black, ofTenacious D fame,
as the mean, overweight elitist, and Todd Louiso as the
archetypal shy music nerd.
But as you might expect from a movie about music,
the best part of "High Fidelity" is the soundtrack, with
selections ranging from Bob Dylan and The Velvet Underground to indierockers Stereolab and crooner Elvis Costello.
■ "High Fidelity" is an ideal date movie, but it fares equally well
as a straight comedy. The humor's sophisticated, the music's entertaining, and Cusack, as usual, will make you swoon. I did, and I'm a guy.

PRINCESS SLUG
FOR A BUTT
I went to the San Diego ComiCon
the largest comicsrelated convention in the world
for the first time this
summer, and, as a result, I am now an infinitely happier
person, though I now recognize the full extent of my
dorkiness and how if I don't temper and hide it behind a
facade of loving shoe shopping and getting wasted, I may
begin to alienate my few remaining friends.
Sample dialogue from Saturday afternoon of the weekend-long ComiCon:
Me [emitting a thoroughly unintentional high-pitched
squeal]: "Oh my god. Look who it is. Let's follow him."
[Five minutes later...]
Melissa, the love of my life: "Urn, tell me again why we're
following this fat, bearded guy around."

Me: "It's Kurt Busiek!"
Melissa: "So?"

And at that very moment, I had somewhat of an epiphany,
you know, one of those boring things that is only really fascinating to the person who experienced it. (Kurt Busiek is the
creator of "Astro City," as well as the writer of "The Avengers," among other things.) But please just humor me. Here's
another story from what was possibly the best weekend of
my life, and even if you can't stand to read all the way through
my little narrative, I won't mind. Like that random guy on
your hall who accosts you and tells you all about his horrible
break-up, I just need to share this with someone.
Saturday, 10 a.m.

He walked into the panel, long hair and too-large t-shirt
on his gaunt frame. And because I am superficial, I made a
mental note sort of a non-mental note that this person

two.
Unfortunately, there's only so many songs one can write
about the various aspects of the dope-smokin' life before it
gets staler than week-old bongwater. Halfway or so through
its 20 tracks, the rap-rock buzz of "High Society" starts to
wear off, and you just want it to be over, so you can get up

off the couch and get on with your life.

Embarrassed in San Diego:
That one geeky weekend in July
would just be someone whom I passed: we would never
dance in the rain or share a milkshake or do any other
sappily romantic things, merely because I can't stand long
hair. And I really can't stand ill-fitting clothes.
So, I smiled and looked back down at my comic book.
"What panel is this?" he asked.
"The Image Panel," I said. "With Brian MichaelBendis
and Erik Larsen and Scott Lobdell."
"Who?" he asked with a smug smile, and I immediately
cringed at the thought that some dorky fanboy was going to
correct my pronunciation of the name of theformer "X-Men"
writer.
"Scott Lobdell," I said, enunciating carefully and stressing the "b."

I"UM,

TELL ME AGAIN WHY
WE'RE FOLLOWING THIS FAT,
BEARDED GUY AROUND?"

"That's me," he said, and then he complimented my dress
while I made inane excuses and giggled uncontrollably at
my own stupidity. Then, he walked to the frontof the room
and started sipping on the water thatI had set out carefully
as part of my volunteer job.
In the spectrum of moments I would like to never live
again, this was slightly above the time I tripped on the
stairs of Kohlberg, but just below last weekend and having that used feminine product lying on my floor when
there were people over and not realizing it until afterwards. Except none of the people present will ever mention my disgusting lack of hygiene, while the embarrassment with Lobdell was drawn out and puked in the toilet

and flushed down the river only to be recondensed every
time I tellthis story, one of the few not involving sex in my
repertoire of anecdotes.
So then, Lobdell starts giving little mock awards to the
wide-eyed fanboys, and I am being gender specific, because
anyone who has ever read an Image comic probably has some
idea of what sort of person would be attracted to a panel
devoted to the label. Remember Gen 13? Remember how
Fairchild, the nerdy, bookish college student who got superpowers and superboobies, lost an article of clothing every
time she got in a fight and ended up in ridiculous contorted
poses? That was Image's initial claim to fame.
In any case, so Lobdell gives "Coolest Hair" award to some
kid with lime green hair, and "Ugly Shirt I Would Never
Wear" to some guy in this polyester orange thing, and then
he says, "And the award for the cutest volunteer ever to that
girl back there." And if there's anything I hate more than
long hair, it's being hit on by guys with long hair, because I
am sincerely flattered and want to be nice but have constrained myselfto immediate unattraction and so have little
idea how to respond.
"What's your name?" Lobdell asked, and I put my head
in my hands involuntarily and replied, "Oh my gosh I'm so
embarrassed."
OK. So maybe that incident wasn't all that horrid. But
maybe it is one of those things that is only understandably
cringe-worthy among a small select group ofpeople. Like getting-an-erection-in-class stories are only really funny when
they come from mild-mannered, geeky looking guys. When
they come from big, built, hulking manly men, it justbecomes
frightening. Now that I think about it, comic book writers
and artists and inkers have all I would ever want from celebrities. They're just as awkward and socially inept as I would
like to deny I am, and that's why we should all love them.

Ultimate frisbee begins season
BY PAUL WULFSBERG
The Ultimate Frisbee fall season
began for the the men's team with
two tournaments last weekend,
while the women's team stayed in
Swarthmore and prepared for
sectionals Saturday, Sept. 16. The
Earthworms, the men's ultimate

team, divided their forces, sending
nine veterans off on the 14-hour
drive to Chicago for a massive national tournament, and a younger,
more inexperienced squad to nearby
Lehigh on Saturday.

Swarthmore's co-ed ultimate
team, the Smart Whores, which consisted of the men's veterans and
Jenny Hoedeman 'Ol, faced off against
mainly club teams in Chicago. They
emerged with a respectable 3-3
record. The Whores' only collegiate
opponent was Carleton College of
Northfield, Minn., which fell before
the long hucks of James Muspratt 'Ol
and some impressive swill throws
from Misha Horowitz 'O3 in a 13-3

blowout. As is common during the fall
season, most of the teams at the tournament were "club" teams, composed of elderly men and women who are hard-core
frisbee fanatics.
As the Smart Whores amused themselves in Chicago, a second group of
young Earthworms left for an important
East Coast competition in Lehigh, Pa.

They shocked regional powerhouse
Susquehanna before finally succumbing
to Rutgers, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton and Haverford in fairly

close games.
The real story of the Lehigh tournament, though, was the first-year players.
Andrew Gregory 'O4, Andrew Rosskam
'O4 and David Paideia 'O4 all turned in
excellent days and had a chance to experience playing all positions on the field,
even against Susquehanna and
Princeton. Gregory's perfectly controlled forehands, Rosskam's outstanding speed and Paideia's tight defense all
contributed significantly to the Earthworms' solid showing at Lehigh. Earthworm upperclassmen Charles Small 'O3,

everyone lost on the van ride both ways.
The Warmothers, who finished last year
ranked ninth in the nation, did not have a

tournament last weekendbut began official
practices on Monday in preparation for the
fall sectionals on Sept. 16 and 17. With nearly
all their junior class abroad this semester,
the Warmothers do not expect an easy route
through sectionals and regionals. Megan

Moerke 'O3, one of a number of new walkons for the Mothers this season, said their
main goal was to have fun.
"I'm psyched for a great season," she
said, "even though we're missing some of
our strongest players this weekend." The
team will be missing senior leaders Jenny
Hoedeman and Lindsay Goldsmith as well
as the juniors.
Both the Warmothers and the Earthworms practice Tuesdays through Thursdays at 4:30 p.m. on Mertz field and warmly
welcome walk-ons.

MEN'S SOCCER

Men lose 1-0 heartbreaker
8Y ANNA MASILELA
A penalty kick eight minutes into overtime determined the outcome of the first Centennial Conference game for the Swarthmore
men's soccer team, which lost a heartbreaking 1-0 decision to Western Maryland College on Saturday afternoon. The team also played
Albright College on Sept. 13, but results were not available at press
time.
Despite the loss, defender Spencer Paine 'O4 foresees better luck
ahead as Swarthmore looks for a chance to prove its mettle. "You
can see the progress," saidPaine. "It's slowly starting to pull together,
so we're going to be getting some results."
The game against the Green Terror of Western Maryland was
highly charged since they were the only conference team that
Swarthmore defeated last season. The first half proved uneventful,
with both teams sending long balls across the length of the field to
attackers who were not there.
It was only after halftime that the Swarthmore offense concentrated more on attempting to take advantage of the scoring opportunities.
However, the heat seemed to take its effect on the team, slowing
downresponse time and allowing Western Maryland to break through

on counterattacks several times. Luckily, goalie Chris Milla 'O3 and
the crossbar both did their jobs, and the score remained 0-0. Many
of Milla's ten saves were sensational. For his efforts, he was named
to the Centennial Conference honorroll for the past week.
In the first feW minutes of overtime, the ball stayed airborne as
both teams battled for possession. Then, Western Maryland sent a
long ball to a forward near the endline and Paine attempted to tackle
the ball away. The referee judged it a foul, and Western Maryland
scored on the penalty kick, ending the game.
Right now, Swarthmore is looking to work new talent into the
team in order to develop a cohesive first unit. "The freshmen are a
great addition to the team," said Milla, "and the old squad is together
again, so it's all good."
More importantly, the team is happy to play together. "The team
atmosphere is so amicable, we're almost like a family," said center
midfielder Frank Sersale di Cerisano 'O2.

without class, and Knight has operated with less
class than a hooker with gonorrhea. In 1988,
Knight won the support of the National
Organization for Women by telling Connie Chung,
"If rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it."
As Conan O'Brien would say,
"liiiinnnnnnnapropriate!!!!"
I'm glad we've seen the last of Knight at
Indiana, though like a bad case of herpes, he'll
probably be back with a vengeance.
Now that I'm done with Knight, on to what I
really wanted to write about: catching up with the
stars of the best episode of the best show ever.
With more overpriced, underachieving ballplayers
than the Dodgers, this show has withstood the test

With a dominating

a loss earlier in
women's soccer team seems
ready to take on its first Centennial Conference opponent.
"We would not be half the team we are if it were not for
the team chemistry," said center midfielderKate McCaffrey
'O4. "That really comes out in our play." The team played
against Ursinus on Wednesday, Sept. 13, but results were
not available at press time.
Swarthmore trampled all over Goucher College, 5-0, on
Saturday afternoon. E.B. Fortier 'O3 snuck in a goal within
the first four minutes of play from her striker position.
Another four minutes later, captain Sarah Jay 'Ol headed
in another goal. Fortier scored the last goal of the first half
on a breakaway, bringing the score to 3-0.
During the second half, midfielder and converted goalkeeper Courtney Caughey 'O4 scored the first goal of her
college career. "It was pretty exciting because it was also
my first goal ever," said Caughey. "I am usually a goalie
victory following

the week, the Swarthmore

and this was only my third game as a field player." Emily
Rhoades 'O4 finished off the game with the first goal of her
college career.
Swarthmore lost, 4-1, to Widener last Thursday despite playing to a stalemate for the first 45 minutes. No goals were scored
in the first half as both teams settled into the game. But Widener scored moments after the start of the second half, and
followed up that goal with another one a few minutes later.
They got off two more goals as the game progressed. Fortier
scored the lone goal for Swarthmore near the end of the second half.
With promising young talent and excellent leadership,
Swarthmore seems poised for a strong season. "We're small
[in numbers]," said captain Heather Marandola 'Ol, "but we
have a lot of really skilled athletes who go out and get the job
done."
"I really think the captains [Sari Altschuler 'Ol, Jay and
Marandola] need to be recognized for the amount of dedication and determination they show," said inside midfielder
Claire Hoverman 'O3.

Tennis makes strong first impression
BY BEN KEYS
The Men's Tennis team began the
long road towards a return to nationals this past weekend at the
Bloomsburg Invitational, kicking off
their fall season. The first tournament of the year, held in bucolic
Bloomsburg, PA featured stiff competitionfrom Division I and nationallyranked Division II teams such as
Villanova and Stony Brook. The invitationalwas the first coaching challenge for Interim Tennis Coach Chris
Pearson, who is leading the men's
team this fall while Mike Mullan is
on sabbatical. After just four days of
practice, with no preseason, the team
knew that the weekendcould turn out
to be a learning experience.
However, considering the short

notice and the talent of their competi-

tors, the Garnet excelled. The competition consisted of four "flights," or sets
of matches in which each team enters
two singles players and a doubles team.
In the challenging A flight, Pete Schilla
'Ol won two of his three singles matches;
John Thomas 'O2 won all three of his
matches; and the doubles team ofSchilla
and Thomas won two of three matches
against the best of what their competition had to offer.
Sophomores Justin Singer and
Jayson Yost found the B flight a bit more
difficult, each winning one match. In the
B-flight doubles, Yost teamed up with
Scott Grant 'Ol to win all three matches.
Grant and Yost's big-serving success
bodes well for the road to nationals.
C-flight singles featured Grant and

freshman sensationFrank Visciano. The

team's future appeared secure as
Visciano pounded two ofhis three opponents, and showcased an excellent allcourt game. Grant embarrassed two of
his singles opponents. In the doubles,
Singer and Visciano won two of three
matches. The excellent showing of the
top three doubles teams bodes well for
the spring season. "In my three years
here this is easily our strongest doubles
lineup," said Thomas.
Four Garnet players entered the D
flight. Freshmen Aaron Rubin, Ben Rae,

and Joey Spadola battled hard against
seasoned opponents, going 3-0, 2-1, and
2-1, respectively. Ben Keys 'Ol also
played D flight. The doubles teams of
Rubin/Keys and Rae/Spadola showed
moments of brilliance. "This weekend
offers us all something to build on," said

of time and can now be declared an official
classic. I mean, it had everything: stars, strategy,
hilarity. It respected the game with tributes to its
past players (Cap Anson, Honus Wagner) and a
tribute to its media from the past (look closely,
you'll see references to The Natural, Pride of the
Yankees.)
Warning: If you're not a Simpsons fanatic and/
or haven't seen this episode, a large majority of
the jokes in the section will make no sense. No
problem though, I guess my girlfriend says that's
the case with most of my columns anyhow.
So what happened to the players?

P Roger Clemens, Boston
Simpsons: Hypnosis convinces him that he is a
chicken.
Fate of Baseball Career: Clemens left the Red
Sox after the 1996 season. Shortly thereafter he
suffered a horrid, painful demise ae he was forced
to watch women's golf. Alright, so he won some
more Cy Youngs, got a World Series ring ae but he
ain't Pedro and never was. No. 45 strikes out
more, is more dominating and speaks better
English.

C Mike Scoscia, Los Angeles
Simpsons: Incapacitated by Chernobyl-like
nuclear accident. Atomic energy was a great idea,
wasn't it?
Fate of Baseball Career: See the path of Jake
Taylor from "Major League" and "Angels in the
Outfield"... Catcher gets bad knees, stops hitting,
becomes manager of the Angels with semihilarious results.
IB Don Mattingly, New York
Simpsons: Mr. Burns throws Mattingly off the
team for refusing to shave his sideburns.
Fate of Baseball Career: Yankee or not, I have
nothing negative to say about Donnie Baseball.
But what justice is there in a world where he didn't
win a World Series in New York but Benedict
Arnolds Clemens and Wade Boggs did?
2B Steve Sax, New York
Simpsons: Found playing the saxophone in a
club, Sax is later arrested by Springfield police on
suspicion and sentenced to six life terms. Oh well,
could have been worse... he could have been
picked up by the PHILADELPHIA police department
at 13th and Locust.
SS Ozzie Smith, St. Louis
Simpsons: Lost for eternity in the strange
Springfield Mystery Spot: "Where logic takes a
holiday and all laws of nature are meaningless."

WRONG

A few teams for a
coach without any
As happens every fall at Swat (or so it seems)
the athletic department has welcomed new faces
to the coaching staffs men's soccer, volleyball
and cross-country, for example. That's not to say
that we don't have dedicated coaches that have
been here since before, say, Kohlberg. But it seems
we have an entrenched, permanent committee
dedicated to finding new coaches every semester.
But with Bobby Knight's "release" from Indiana
University last week (shock of shocks!), the talent
pool might be upped a bit. Though we don't
exactly need a new basketball coach for either of
our teams, I'm sure we might be able to find a
spot for him somewhere in the vast land of
Swarthmore athletics. We could use what he has
to offer in several areas. A look at Knight's
potential Swarthmore coaching career:
Year One: Due to Bobby's rather "unfortunate"
personal conduct in the past, Bobby undergoes
anger management training with the football
team, aiding as equipment manager in charge of
riding the sleds and holding tackling dummies. He
spurs the team to a .500 season before half of
the linesmen opt to "pursue their academic
careers."
In the spring, Bobby is asked to aid the men's
lacrosse team with offensive plays because of the
new shot clock rule. Knight does not get to see
the fruits of his efforts due to his "unfortunate"
personal conduct on the spring training trip. After
an incident in a diner packed with truckers, Knight
is warned by athletic director Bob Williams that he
is not living up to expectations and is placed on a
"three-strikes" probation and is no longer allowed
to eat meals in public places. Though the team
never fully understands the plays, they manage to
finish in the top three in the conference.
Year Two: The athletic department decides to
try Knight in another realm of Swat athletics. With
the booming success of the women's rugby team,
the school creates a temporary position for
Knight: interim head coach. While many of the
"soft" members of the team quickly decide that
they would rather play frisbee, the A-side becomes
the dominant force in collegiate rugby. Knight
breaks a leg in a "freak" accident with a scrum
machine.
Year Three: Dan Sears takes a leave of
absence in the winter, leaving badminton without
a leader. Though reluctant to let Knight back into
a gym, the department has no other choice than
to let him coach the team, though student workers
are warned not to leave any chairs around the
matches. Despite its non-traditional style of play,
the team goes undefeated, mostly because of the
special birdies the captains construct for the team
with Bobby's face on them.
Year Four: Knight is extremely excited about
rebuilding the wrestling team before he learns
that a chokehold is illegal. Then Knight helps the
golf team with pre-season conditioning by
"leading" team runs around the links in a golf cart.
Knight leaves on a two-week fishing trip to
Canada, maintaining that his tickets are nonrefundable, and that he is "just motivating from
the back," and not actually attempting to run the
players over. The paparazzi get a 5-minute film of
these training runs.

Pursued by the Garnet's Alison Gaffney (right), Gettysburg defender Tabitha Gary struggles to get rid of the ball Saturday.

Field hockey beats No. 8-ranked Gettysburg but falls to F&M
BY ANNA MASILELA
Gettysburg's field hockey team was ranked eighth in the nationlast Saturday morning. ThenSwarthmore got a hold of them.
The game, which the Garnet won 4-2, was particularly sweet
because Gettysburg had gotten the best ofSwarthmore for two
years in a row. This year, the Garnet was ready for revenge.
"We all went out there and we were ready to play," said captain Katie Vivalo 'Ol
The Garnet took the field with intensity and executed well.
The strong passing combinations created by the offense allowed Swarthmore to put three goals in the back of the net in
the first half. CaptainKristen English 'Ol scored the first goal
on a penalty stroke. Kim Cariello 'O2 and Erika Williams 'Ol
both followed up with scores in regular play.
English lauded the team's diverse offensive attack.
"It was great that each goal was tallied by a different
player," she said. "It's nice to not have to depend on one person to always get to the goal."
By the middle of the second half, Swarthmore had opened
up a dominating 4-0 margin, after scoring on a penalty corner

stroke. Gettysburg mounted one surge to close the gap by send-

ing in two quick goals.
But the defense did not allow them to close the margin any
further and kept Swarthmore ahead, 4-2. Katie Tarr 'O2 made
twokey defensive stops. Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 played excellently
in goal, especially in the first half when a potent Gettysburg
attack was entirely shut down.
Vivalo was especially proud of the team's cohesiveness. "I
was pumped because this game wasn't about individual play
but was more about pulling it together as a team, and that
made playing a lot easier," she said.
The team is excited about the possibilities for this season.
"We have more depth than we've ever had before," said English. "Having so many different players gives us more possibilities and makes it easier to adapt to competitor's styles."
Swarthmore played its second conference game on Sept. 12
against Franklin and Marshall College
ranked No. 20 nationally
and dropped a 2-1 decision. The Garnet had been
ranked No. 7 in the national poll before that defeat.
For her efforts, senior defenderKristen English was named
to the Centennial Conference Honor Roll for the past week.
