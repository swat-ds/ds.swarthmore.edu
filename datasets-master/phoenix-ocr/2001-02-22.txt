College will seek dean of multicultural affairs
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
After a decade of wavering student opinion and unsuccessful job searches, the college has committed to hiring
an associate dean of multicultural affairs, a position for
which cultural student groups have been lobbying since
last year.
Though a hiring committee, office space and administrative support for the "multicultural dean" have yet to
materialize, Dean of the College Bob Gross said his goal is
to hire somebody for the position in time for fall 200 L
Gross said the deans are looking for "somebody with a
vision of multiculturaleducation [and] an ability to work
with a wide variety of people, to inspire them to a common
sense of purpose and common direction."
Although some students have raised the issue of bringing more cultural diversity to course material here, the
dean of multicultural affairs would not be charged with
academic involvement.
Rather, the dean would deal with student life, overseeing the Tri-College Pre-Orientation Program for Students
of Color, the Multicultural Winter Institute, freshman entry workshops relating to diversity, and "programs we
haven't yet thought of," Gross said.
The quest to fill the position began in 1991, when students lent support to the dean ofthe college to hire an associate dean of multicultural affairs. In 1993, after the Intercultural Center had opened, Joe Mason left his position as

director of the Black Cultural Center to take on a half-time
position as the dean of multicultural affairs, only to leave the
post two years later.
Another search for a half-time multicultural dean began,
but, according to Gross, it failed because "you can't attract a
senior-level administrator for a half-time job."
In what Gross referred to as "round three," the college
sought a candidate who would act as both associate dean of
multicultural affairs and director of the intercultural center.

Students involved in the IC protested against having a
director who would devote only half of his or her time to
their needs. Black students said that assigning someone to
both run the IC and act as the multicultural dean would cause
black interests to be swallowed up in multiculturalism.
The deans soon dropped the multicultural dean component
of the job description, and Anna Maria Cobo was hired as the
IC director and assistant dean in 1996.
After that, Gross said, "students were not seeing the
[multicultural dean] position as a priority." But in the fall of
1998, "students began talking about the 'MC dean again," he
said, and after an vandalism incident at the IC, hundreds of
students rallied for interculturalism. A student group vested
in multicultural concerns included the hiring of a
multicultural dean in its goals.
During the summer of 1999, a search committee for a halftime dean candidate formed and began a very limited search,
focusing on internal candidates. The committee stopped, partly

to involve more students in the process and partly because
it realized the necessity of performing a national search
for a full-time position.
The multicultural dean issue languished until the fall
of 2000. Then ADVICE (Advocating Diversity and a Variety of Ideologies in a College Environment), a nexus of racial, ethnic, gender-based and religious support group representatives, made it a goal to secure the deans' agreement
to search for a multicultural dean.
Sarah Willie and Tim Sams, co-chairs of the Diversity
Task Force, were charged with looking at the multicultural
dean question. Over winterbreak, they recommended that
Dean Gross "go ahead" with the candidate search. They
also recommended that he forego the idea of mixing the
dean position with tasks more suited to a provost
that
is, pushing responsibility for a combinationof student life
and academic affairs. For now, the dean will only focus on
student life.

Although Dean Gross feels "very positive about the fact
thatthere are multiple groups in the Intercultural Center"
and that they have "functioned to promote the agenda of
multiculturalism," he believes the task of promoting
multiculturalism stretches their role and the role of Cobo,
their director.
Gross said the college needed someone whose sole responsibility was to provide "a vision of multicultural education" that allows "all students to take full advantage of
the Swarthmore experience."

Council says Wharton basement space will go to all groups
BY IVAN BOOTHE
The Wharton meeting space will be available for
use to all student groups, Student Council announced

at Monday's meeting.
Previously, some council members had advocated
turning the space over to activist groups. In a referendum vote last semester, a coalition of activist
groups known as MULTI lost to SCCS for use of the
old gameroom in Clothier.
Initially, a few members brought up the idea of
giving the space solely to the activist groups. Jordan
Brackett 'Ol, however, reminded the council that
MULTI had dropped out of the gameroom referendum because they had been promised part of the
space in Wharton. In addition, he said, the council
had intimated to all groups that they would be part
of the space at the beginning of the Wharton renovation effort.

"I don't think we can give it all over to one group,"
said co-chair Colin Moore 'O2.
Brackett said he hopes thatafter the construction
of the new dorm, the lodges would be available to
student groups, particularly the activist coalition.
Co-chair Anna Woodiwiss 'O2, however, reported
that in a conversation with Dean Bob Gross, he had
been "non-committal" on the future of the lodges. She
recommended that the council not assume student
use of the lodges would be certain.
There was some debate over whether the council

or the Student Budget Committee (SBC) should oversee the administration and scheduling for the
Wharton space. Although Brackett and Sonal Bhatia
'O2 felt that a space coordinator would have to be
hired, Moore said that scheduling would not be a
large problem.

Bhatia was also concerned about access to the
space. "We need to keep it from becoming a party
space," she said.

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Newly elected Student Council co-chair Anna Woodiwiss was officially
introduced at Monday's meeting after winning the special election held
last week. Woodiwiss encouraged the council to examine the existing
sexual assualt policy on campus.

Liane Rice 'O3 also mentioned concerns about cigarette smoke from adjoining lounges entering the
room through air ducts. Other members of the council felt that with proper access control, abuse of the
space would not take place.
Moore believed that because "the status of Student Council changes a lot from semester to semester," SBC should handle the administration. Marvin
Barron 'O2-agreed, and said that SBC would be able
to handle the space most efficiently.

The council also discussed late-night food. Peter Holm 'Ol reported that Dining Services is looking into the possibility of using the Clothier counter
used for bag lunches as a late-night snack bar. It
would be open from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., and would
carry items like sandwiches and soft drinks. The

project is dependent on students working as both
coordinators and late-night staffers.
Barron proposed a preliminary examination
of the student group chartering process. He said
that groups can't be chartered until they are organized, but until they get chartering monies, they
usually cannot become organized. He proposed
giving "seed money" to potential groups and giving them a semester or two to organize. Successful groups would then be officially chartered.
In describing his motivation, Barron cited the
high turnover rate in student groups, and the fact
that only 41 out of 110 student groups have official charters. He also proposed consolidating charter rules and recommendations, and developing
common elements that would exist in all charters.
Barron also proposed renewing charters periodically, noting that the WSRN group charter dates
from 1962.The council is reviewing his recommendations.

According to Rice and Poulami Roychowdhury
'O3, Public Safety chief Owen Redgrave is re-examining security and lighting issues on campus.
They reported suggestions such as mirrors and
more lighting in the tunnel under the SEPTA station. Public Safety, they said, was interested in
hearing from students about specific areas of the
campus they felt needed to be better lit. According to Rice, however, Redgrave was "not responsive" to the idea of callboxes or swipe card access
to dorms, calling it "more of a convenience" than
a safety concern. Roychowdhury said that information provided by Redgrave supported an assertion of his that crime had decreased on campus
over past years.

Woodiwiss encouraged the council to begin a
preliminary investigation into the sexual assualt
policy on campus. She said that there is "hardly
a policy" in place to deal with incidents.
Woodiwiss wanted the council to begin the investigation in a committee, eventually opening it to
student representation. Moore directed the idea
to the council's security subcommittee.

BOARD
Board to make
decisions on new
science center

Red Cross attracts blood donors

BY ELIZABETH HANSEN
The board of managers will meet this weekend to
make the final decision whether or not to go ahead
with the construction of the new science center. So
far, the project has been approved in stages, said
Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president for college and
community relations.
The Development Committeeand the Finance and
Trust Committee, both of which are involved in the
science center project, have already met. The Development Committee includes in its purview the
college's development office, public relations, publications, and alumni relations.
The committee's "oversight of development [fund
raising] makes it appropriate for them to affirm that
the effort is going well," Eldridge said, "and that,
therefore, from that point of view, the science center
project should go forward." The Finance and Trust
Committee manages the money for the project.
The Property Committee, whichlooks at the plans
for the center and has met intermittently with the
project's architects, will meet Friday afternoon.
These committees will give reports at the formal
board meeting on Saturday morning. The architects
on the project will also give a presentation to the
board at that time. The board will have an opportunity to ask questions and then will reach a consensus on the project.
The board will also approve the college's budget
for next year and hear reports from the chairman of
the board, the president of the college and other board
committees. This meeting is open to the board of
managers student observers, but the executive session of the board, which follows the formal meeting,
is closed to observers.

AUSTRIAN, NOYES RESIGN FROM BOARD
In the wake of the athletics decision in December, two members of the board have resigned: Neil
Austrian and Jim Noyes. Although the Nominating
Committee is meeting in a closed session on Friday
to discuss nominees, the positions it is trying to fill
were vacant prior to the resignation of Austrian and
Noyes.
"The Nominating Committee can bring forward
new member recommendations at any time in the
year and, if approved by the full board in executive
session, those new members would start their term
at the next scheduled meeting of the board. In this
case, any [members] elected this February could start
in May," Eldridge said.
It is not unusual to have vacant positions on the
board. According to Eldridge, the membership ofthe
board now stands at 31, not including emeritus members. The by-laws of the board permit 39 members.
"Since I've been working [here] I don't think
we've had a full complement... By this time next year,
we might have [one]," he said.

Students propose wilderness pre-orientation
Deans raise concerns about appropriateness, financial implications of proposal
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
A proposal for an outdoor orientation
program is currently under discussion
by the deans' advisory committee.
The proposal, written by three juniors and four freshmen, suggests that a
small group of incoming students of the
class of 2006 have the opportunity to
spend the week before general orienta-

tion in the wilderness.
A letter the students sent to the deans
sent last Sunday also proposes that a pilot program run during October break
of the next academic year.
During the program's first year, 30 applicants would be selected and divided
into groups of 10 based on prior backpacking experience and physical condition. The program would eventually
grow to encompass a third of the class.
Similar pre-orientation wilderness
experiences have been successfully
implemented in many other schools, including Williams, Princeton, Amherst
and the University of Pennsylvania.
According to Morgan Simon 'O4, one
of the program's proponents, the goal of
the trip wouldbe to create a sense of community and help prospective students
learn how to adapt to a completely different atmosphere, thus easing their
transition to college.
The fifteen-page proposal was prepared by Simon, Christine Hancock 'Ol,
Sarah Zlotnik 'Ol, Ari Houser 'Ol, Zac
Steele 'O4, Lillie Dremeaux 'O4, and Joe
Florence 'O4. Steele and Florence presented it to the deans' advisory commit-

The initiative'sbudget calls for more
than $30,000.
According to Dean of ResidentialLife
Myrt Westphal, the cost outlined in the
proposal is three times that of the
present orientation program, which includes all incoming freshmen.
But the student group argues that

"EVERYONE THOUGHT
THAT THIS [WOULD BE]
FUN AND BENEFICIAL,
BUT NOT EVERYONE
WAS SURE THAT IT WAS

THE BEST WAY TO
SPEND OUR MONEY."
this initial cost would cover equipment
and other expenditures that would not
be required in subsequent years. Moreover, this budget includes highest pos-

sible price estimates for items such as
training.
"We think that we can scale our budget back significantly," Steele said.
According to Simon, initial costs

could bereduced to about $20,000 by leasing equipment.
Westphal, who admits thatshe is one
of the least enthusiastic deans regarding this program, has otherreservations

as well. She is concernedwith an appar-

ent lack offaculty and staffinvolvement

with the program.
To address this issue, the student
group sought interested faculty members. They found that biology and environmental studies professors felt very
positively about the program, and
Adrienne Shibles of the physical education was willing to commit herself to
sponsoring the program.
Westphal is also worried about the
program being exclusively available to
freshmen. In her opinion, the program's
experiences would be beneficial to everyone and not attached only to the orientation. In addition, she said, the program might not fitSwarthmore's profile
as well as it would at a college like Williams.
"Outdoor activity, who could be
against it? But it's not central to the mission of the college," Westphal said, citing
community
interest and
volunteerism as activities that embody
the spirit of Swarthmore.
"Everyone thought that this was fun
and beneficial, but not everyone was
sure that it was the best way to spend
our money," she added, referring to
views expressed at the deans' meeting.
Steele seemed surprised by the deans
reaction. "This program would be an aspect of orientation, and we thought the
school would be willing to fund it," he
said.

Should the deans' advisory committee approve the initiative, it would be up
to the board of managers to make money
available for it.

Borough petitions
for liquor license
BY GERRIT HALL
The possibility of serving alcohol in a limited fashion in the borough of
Swarthmore is coming one step closer to reality, as petitions to put the matter to vote are circulating throughout the town.
At issue is whether a hotel on college grounds should be allowed to hold
liquor licenses. If 758 signatures are collected, the issue will be held as a
referendum on May 15.
The petitioning began on Feb. 19 and will continue until Mar. 6. This allows two weeks to collect the required number of signatures. Only voters
registered to vote in the borough of Swarthmore will be allowed to sign the
petition.
Borough council member Alice "Putty" Willetts is taking a leading role in
the petitioning effort. Efforts to collect signatures include circulation of petitions by community volunteers and the placement of petitions in different
stores, including Booksource and Occasionally Yours.
"We would like to get to 900 [signatures] to be safe," said Willetts. She
emphasized that signing the petition does not obligate a person to vote for or
against the statement but merely helps put the issue up to a general vote. "I
think the most important thing to me is that everybody runs the town," she

said.
The petition reads, "Do you favor the granting of liquor licenses to hotels

Melissa Maxman, a resident of the borough of Swarthmore, speaks to students at a rally Monday
evening. Maxman is running as the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania Congressional District
26. She is campaigning against Republican Edwin B. Erickson, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College.
The special election for the congressional seat will be held on March 20.

on property owned by an accredited college or university in the borough of
Swarthmore?"
"It opens only a small door, which was the idea," says Borough Council
Vice President Ann Seidman. She said the borough council worked to "find
the most conservative introduction of liquor into the borough."
Swarthmore has been a dry town since 1949, but efforts to bring a hotel to
the village have caused this policy to come under scrutiny. A borough council committee concluded that a hotelcould not be profitable without a restaurant that served alcohol. The state liquor law was recently modified to allow
such a petition to circulate.
As far as the prospects of success, Willetts said, "I think we'll make it."

Professor organizes educational aid in Chester
BY HOFAN CHAU
Chester-Upland ranks as Pennsylvania's worst school

district. When over half of its students scored in the bottom percentiles in state math and reading tests last May,

it was officially declared "academically distressed."
Political science professor Keith Reeves hopes to help
overcome that designation with a new project in education. With his team at the Center for Social and Policy
Studies (CSPS), he plans to launch an ambitious collaborative project with the Chester community called The
Learning Corridor.
Reeves considers Swarthmore's engagement with
Chester so far to be "piecemeal," but, through the CSPS,
he hopes to build "something more systematic and syn-

chronized."

<

After receiving the "distressed" designation, ChesterUpland was turned over to a state department-appointed
board ofcontrol. The district's schools will be privatized
m September under the board's recommendation.
It is in this context that Reeves hopes to make a difference. Although he still has "fundamental concerns"
about the privatization of schools, he began to see that
Swarthmore could "perhaps play a positive role."
Performing an analysis of what the college has done
and has the potential to do, Reeves has identified four
areas in which the college could focus its efforts: public
school reform, community economic development, civil
engagement and bridging the digital divide.
"We don't have the internal capacity to do everything," Reeves said, "but we can push on areas [that
make the most difference]."
The Learning Corridor hopes to have a facility in the
middle ofthe town of Chester. According to Chris Couples
°f Information Technology Services and the CSPS, it
would provide "a relevant, holistic space for the citizens
ofChester to help redevelop
theircity." The center would
house a variety of resources for the community, ranging
from health care services to cultural and educational enrichment for children and adults.
In contrast to fragmented tutoring projects that depend on collaboration with other agencies, Colin Moore
°2, student council co-chair, sees The Learning Corri-

dor as cohesive and powerful. "It would [be] a totally integrated project. We would have a lot of control about what
went on," he said.
"Mom can come and do one thing, while the kids can
come and do another, all in the same physical space,"
Couples said.
It is Couples who is responsible for the technological
direction of the project. The Learning Corridor would provide support to both teachers and students in the school
district through on-line mentoring and computer literacy

training.
"It's extremely ambitious. I wouldn't hesitate to say it's
over-ambitious," said Moore, "but [Reeves] dreams big
that's why we love him."
Over the past a year and a half, the CSPS has been transformed from a data collection and statistical analysis site to a
place that fits the college's mission of integrating community
service into learning. The team working there has been laying foundations for the project, writing grant proposals, conducting applied policy research, and building contacts with
key stakeholders in Chester. Currently, the organization has
ties to the State of Delaware County Legal Aid Association,
Delaware County Community College, the United Way of
Southern Pennsylvania, the Chester Boys and Girls Club, resident associations and religious leaders.
The project is set to launch in April, when the CSPS will
hear how much of the $4 million it applied for in grants
have gone through.
Nationally, collaborations between colleges and nearby
school districts are becoming more common. Referred to
as K-16 partnerships, these relationships benefit students
...

and educators on both sides.
"For [Swarthmore] faculty who are interested in issues
surrounding community redevelopment, the Learning Corridor could provide a ready-made space to develop new programs for helping people help themselves out of poverty,"
said Couples, citing the Public Policy and Education programs in particular. "For students, it broadens the range
of opportunities for participation in the community of
Chester."
Already, Reeves is envisioning courses for students that
will complement the work at Chester. One of those courses
would combine community service and democracy concepts

with rigorous academics. Students would be exposed to
literatureand then paired with an agency in Chester that
would focus on a specific problem. At the end of the semester, the students would create a set of recommendations for the agency. "[l] want a marriage between theory
and practice," said Reeves. "That's been my life not
...

simply as a straight academic."

"I WANT A MARRIAGE
BETWEEN THEORY
AND PRACTICE."
KEITH REEVES

-

Another possible course would take an interdisciplinary approach to poverty. Reeves plans to teach this
course with a number of other professors, including Russian professor Thomas Bradley and philosophy profes-

sor Hugh Lacey.
Reeves has a personal stake in a Swarthmore-Chester
collaborative, having grown up in Chester himself and
graduated from Swarthmore in 1988. This work brings
back to him two communities he cares about.
Leaving Harvard's Kennedy School of Government
to come here a year and a half ago was "a tough decision" for Reeves. However, he said that Swarthmore's
offer of a job teaching at the college and working with
the CSPS came "at a wonderful time."
"I wanted to connect with undergraduates," Reeves
said. "I missed their idealism and optimism [while teaching at Harvard]. I've learned immensely from undergraduates." Reeves also said it is a wonderful opportunity to get to work with a lot of the professors who taught
him, some of whom he says have been his greatest cheerleaders.
Although he is officially on two-year leave of absence
from Harvard, he may choose to remain at Swarthmore.
"It's a matter of where I can make the most impact," he
said.

UC proposes eliminating SAT
President wants to drop test as admissions requirement
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
The president of the University of
announced a proposal last
Friday to eliminate the SAT I as an
admission requirement.
In his speech to the American
Council on Education, Richard
Atkinson compared the emphasis on
SAT I scores in college admissions as
"the educational equivalent of a
nuclear arms race." The announcement has stirred up debate in higher
education as to the role of test scores
as a piece ofthe college admissions pie.
Under Atkinson's proposed plan,
California

the university system would require
the SAT lis, which test more specific
subjects like writing, history and math.
Outlining the proposal in his
speech, Atkinson cited many concerns
that have been voiced about the SAT I
test in recent years: the booming industry that has formed around preparing

high school students for the test, the
perception that the test perpetuates and
exacerbates racial inequalities, and recent findings that the test does not, as
it claims to, predict academic performance in college. All of these factors
gave Atkinson pause about weight being given to such a test.
"Let me make clear that I continue
to be a strong supporter of standardized tests," Atkinson said. "My concern is with the appropriateness of
the SAT in college admissions."

A grease fire broke out in this Parrish East kitchen Friday afternoon. There were no major injuries.
BY GABRIEL HETLAND

A grease fire broke out in the Parrish Second East kitchen around 2:30 p.m. on Friday.
Cristina Cardemil 'Ol said she was heating oil
in a frying pan when grease came into contact
with the electric stovetop and burst into flames.
Public Safety Sergeant Pat Laurenzi said this
was the first fire he had seen in four years at
Swarthmore. There was no major fire damage,
but Cardemil was later treatedfor a minor second-degree burn.
Cardemil said she tried to move the pan of
oil off the heat as the fire alarm sounded, but
the fire continued to grow. She then left the

kitchen and searched for an extinguisher to put
out the flames, but at first only encountered a
silver, pressurized water (PV) extinguisher.
Cardemil said that she was fortunate to have
received some instruction in fire safety as an
PvA. She knew not to use the water-based PV,
which would have only aggravated the fire.
After returning to the kitchen, Cardemil
found a red, dry chemical (DC) extinguisher,
which is used for grease fires. Cardemil put out
the fire, called Public Safety, and waited for them

to arrive.

Laurenzi said the fire alarm sounded in Ben
West at 2:31 p.m. Three officers were dispatched
to investigate the fire, and the Swarthmore Fire
Department was notified. Laurenzi reported that
the officers arrived at 2:33 p.m. and found the
fire already put out.
According to Cardemil, the officers assessed
the situation and opened some windows as she
explained to them how the fire had started. At
that point, Cardemil was treatedfor her minor
second-degree burn at Worth Health Center.

Laurenzi reported that Public Safety was satisfied with how the fire was handled, as the dispatched officers arrived very quickly after the
alarm was sounded.
At times, Laurenzi said, there are two to three
alarms per week, but most of them are due to smoke
from students cooking or smoking in their rooms.
In general, he said, not many fires occured in college dorms.
Laurenzi said that fire safety is a top priority
for Public Safety. He reported that Corporal Bob
Stephano works for Public Safety in a full-time position, doing monthly checks on fire alarms and
extinguishers throughout campus. Laurenzi recommended that any students who encounter defective
fire alarms report them to Public Safety.
When an alarm goes off, Laurenzi said, Public
Safety knows immediately when and where it has
occurred, using the SIMPLEX system. For normal
alarms, Laurenzi said two officers are dispatched,
one to see if the fire is real and one to reset the fire
panel if the alarm proves unwarranted. If the fire
is an actual emergency, 911 is called immediately,
and the Swarthmore Fire Department responds.
Laurenzi stressed the good fortune Cardemil had
in knowing which extinguisher to use. Cardemil
said she believes more students should be made
aware of the different types of fires and extinguishers, because using the wrong one can lead to disastrous results.
Over the weekend, there was an all-Parrish study
break with Chris Hansen of the Swarthmore Fire
Department, who taught students the basics offire
safety. Cardemil hoped she would see fire safety
training offered more to students in the future.
Other than Cardemil's slight burn, no other students were harmed, and the damage from the fire
was minimal.

Swarthmore student from Rhode Island, reflected that sentiment, but said
it might not ease the high-stakes process of applying to college.
"It would take a lot of pressure off
the SATs," she said, "but it would put
more pressure on grades."
Some faculty and staff at
Swarthmore expressed surprise at the
announcement.

"There have been a number of
small liberal arts colleges who have
done away with the SATs as admissions requirements, like Mt. Holyoke
and Bowdoin," education professor
Eva Travers said. "In California, it's
interesting because it's such a large
system, not just a single institution.
That makes it high profile, high risk
and potentially high payoff."
Acting Dean of Admissions Jim
Bock '9O also said he was surprised. "To
my knowledge, no entire state system

has tackled the issue before," he said.
Travers said colleges have many
ways to evaluate applicants. She said
thatresearch has shown that SATs are
only predictive for the first year ofcollege, and that high school grades are
an even better predictor.
"Since they started the program
which automatically admits students
at the top five percent of their high
school class, more students from
underrepresented minority groups

have been admitted," Travers said.
Since the California legislature enacted Proposition 209 in 1996, eliminating affirmative action in the university system, the system initially ended
up with few students of color, except
Asian Americans, being admitted.
The preparation business that has
evolved around the test is also a concern.
"The test can be taught and strategies can be learned to beat the test as
evidenced by all the test prep courses
out there," Bock said.
Last year, 150,000students paid more
than $lOO million for SAT I coaching to
the Princeton Review, Kaplan and other
businesses whichoften make point-gain
guarantees of 100 points or more, a number that can often make all the difference in admissions profiles.
"Many parents who can afford the
fees enroll theirchildren in SAT preparation courses," Atkinson said in his
speech. "Given the attempts of some
individualsand institutions to gain any
advantage, fair or foul, is it any wonder that leaders of minority communities perceive the SAT to be unfair?"
Atkinsonrecommended thatall campuses "move away fromadmission processes that use narrowly defined quantitative formulas and instead adopt procedures thatlook at applicants in a comprehensive, holistic way."
"Clearly, we look beyond the numbers to build an intellectually and socially engaged and culturally diverse
student body who is passionate about
theirpersonal interests and pursuit of
knowledge," Bock said. "Many of the
larger schools make a percentage of
their decisions using a formula where
numbers are plugged into a computer
and a decision is spit out the other end.
We have no suchformulas or cut-offs."
"If all of our peer colleges moved
in that direction, we might consider
it," Bock said. "[But] I don't see that
happening in the near future."

Use caution in SAT

elimination decisions
When University of California President Richard
Atkinson appeared before the American Council on
Education Sunday and called for colleges and
universities to eliminate the SAT from the college
admissions process, he wasn't spouting empty
rhetoric. His call was backed by a proposal to
eliminate the SAT in the UC system, a move that
shook the academic community from trunk to limb.
By putting his own university on the line,
Atkinson has raised the stakes considerably in the
ongoing debate over the place of standardized tests
in college admissions.
in particular the SAT
The move has created a substantial upwelling of
support for the eliminationof the SAT. But before
blindly jumping on the bandwagon, we should take
a moment to examine the argument Atkinson and
others are offering.
Atkinson worries that the importance of the SAT
has been inflated, despite being only one of the
quantitative measures college admissions offices
use to poke, prod and measure their applicants.
as high school
And this worry seems true
students not so long ago, we know how much rides
on the SATs (or seems to
not that there's a
difference) and how willing students and their
parents are to pay for a 50- to 100-point increase in
SAT scores. In his speech, Atkinson cites the $lOO
million industry SAT preparation has become.
This statistic raises the specter of bias

against

minorities, poor students and students from
academically weak high schools
that has haunted
the SAT for many years. And although numerous
adjustments have been made to the test in attempts
to eliminate that bias, Atkinson suggested that it's
time to recognize that the SAT is fundamentally
flawed and to act accordingly.
Furthermore, there's a real question as to what
the SAT actually measures. Is it aptitude? Achievement? IQ? Nobody quite seems to know, the College
Board included, but there seems to be a consensus,
reflected in countless statistics, that whatever the
SAT measures, numerous studies have shown it has
little to do with how well students perform in
college after the first year.
Not surprisingly, many schools have considered
eliminating or in some cases actually eliminated
the use of the SAT in the admissions process.
During the alumni meeting to discuss the athletics
cut in December, former Dean of Admissions Bob
Barr lamented the fact that he had not eliminated
the test from Swarthmore's admission process
while he had the opportunity. And lest you think
the college's priorities and ideals have changed,
current Acting Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O
nodded his approval throughout Barr's comments.
Yet college and universities across the country
still use the SAT in admissions, and often weight it
heavily. Despite its flaws, the SAT provides a
convenient measuring stick, one that at least gives
the appearance of having eliminated the endless
differences between applicants.
This is the nature of quantitative measures. But
there are better quantitative measures the SAT II
and recalculated high school GPAs come to mind.
Yet if the SAT is abolished, it seems the focus of
colleges' attention and students' labors will merely
change to some other test, which will likely have its
°wn flaws exposed in the harsh and competitive
world of college admissions.
So what is Swarthmore to do? Two words come
to mind: proceed cautiously. Swarthmore is not the
University of California, and with a far smaller
applicant pool, we have the luxury of spending
ftore time on individual applications and discounting SAT scores and GPAs.
Atkinson's proposal is certainly headed in the
right direction
a decreased emphasis on quantitative measures but in many ways, Swarthmore
s already farther down that road.

Staff involved in campaign, but often fear retaliation
Dear Editor:
As a member of the Living Wage and Democracy Committee, I would like to address the issue of staff participation in
this campaign, a concern raised in The Phoenix last week.
Staff have been actively involved in this campaign. Staff
representatives from dining hall, environmental services and
facilities management have been meeting weekly to discuss
ways to inform the community on the living wage. The dining hall staff conducted their own wage survey. Members of
our group have put up flyers and posters and talked with colleagues across the campus.
We have collected over 100 staffand faculty signatures to
the petition supporting the living wage, and we are confident
that we'll continue to receive strong support as others are
given an opportunity to sign.
This effort continues despite roadblocks that the staffface
in advocating for a living wage. Our groups are dispersed
across campus, and employees work second jobs or have children at home, making it difficult to come to meetings outside
of work hours. Yet most employees skip their lunch so they
can come to our noontime meetings.
We are working to overcome our greatest obstacle: fear.
Employees are afraid ofretaliation if they participate in this
effort. Several employees felt that their position would be at
risk if they attended a presentation with senior staff. Some
feel that their supervisors would in some subtle way "get back
at them" if they were seen publicly supporting this campaign.
At a recent staff meeting with Sharmaine LeMar, the equal
opportunity officer, employees were assured of their right to
sign petitions and to hold meetings on their own time. Several supervisors sat in the audience. The result was that instead of our usual lively discussion and active debate among

our group members, the audience fell silent.
All of these efforts toward a living wage come from our
own initiative, and we try to be inclusive and listen to all
points of views. We welcome all community members, faculty, staffand students to our meetings, held Tuesday evenings at 7 p.m. in the Community Resource Center. We are
sponsoring an all-campus get-together Friday evening in
Upper Tarble to bring people together to discuss the issues.
If you have concerns or would like to be part of the process, please join us. Offering objections is fine if you are
willing to help us find a solution.
Concerning the argument that the "endowment is for
the future," consider several points. First, why is 96 percent of the endowment selected as the figure to freeze for
the future? Second, saving for the future assumes we can
do nothing today with our resources that will bring change
for the better in the future.
Giving our employees today a fair wage will influence
the future of our community. Economic justice means
people can afford to save for emergencies, pay for further
education and training for themselves and their children,
improve their communities and schools, afford safe and
reliable transportation and pay for dental and medical care
not covered by benefits.
Until Swarthmore CoUege addresses these issues offair
pay and democratic principles of governance, students will
continue to leave our institution with a partial emptiness
for the community they were hoping to find here.
Swarthmore has a unique opportunity to be a true leader
in economic and social justice. Rather than giving excuses,
let's find a way to come together.

A gift for all
humanity
For those of you not born in the 19705, a Swarthmore
tradition dictates that the graduating class give a gift to
the school—in exchange for the promising education

we have already extracted from it to the collective tune
of $36 million. We are indeed in the school's debt. In
any event, this is what happens, and I would be remiss
in my duty to aid the school by pointing out its meaningless but generally humorous foibles if I did not suggest at least one candidate for the gift.
We had a similar tradition, incidentally, at my high
school. My class, I believe, gave some sort ofsundial that,
for reasons unknown and uncared about, did not actually exist at the time of our graduation. In lieu of the gift
itself, we had a plaque made, which said something like
"Here will lie the gift of the Class of 1997, which, for reasons hard to decipher, left us both a non-existent class
gift and elected a pot head class president." Or words to
that effect, as my male muse would say. So I'm 0-for-l
and looking toward a more respectable average.
If you haven't noticed, some classes have given little
marble plaques that adorn the sides of Parrish, contributing to its architectural support. These plaques either
simply state the class year or oftentimes add a nice Latin
epigram, such as Quid rides? Mutato nomine de tefabula
narratur. That's one option, but it is one which now
suffers from the notable problem of no one knowing
Latin. So that's out.
The other would be to give some form of plant life,
but I think that has been done with too much zeal in the
past. Incidentally, they say Swarthmore is "Tree City,
USA, 1722-2001" or something, but I think it's really "Bad
Gardening City, USA." The trees and plants on campus
look fine, but the ones in town are often very poorly
maintained. There are dead branches in the trees, and
most hedges are out of control and not pruned. If you
can't see the house from the road, something's wrong.
But we digress. So we still need a gift. If we had a
whole lot of money (and we, in a sense do, but we, in the
sense of the class of 2001, do not), I would suggest gutting
Papazian Hall. It's a labyrinth inside, with stairs thatlead
to nowhere and three double doors between the main
hallway and the men's bathroom on the main floor. And
for all those concerned, I'm sure the puzzle table could
be moved to a safe place and restored after renovations.
Still nothing. But much as practitioners of the
Socratic method know where the argument is really
going despite what they say, I knew where this column
was going, and I have a solution. It is inexpensive, helpful and, most importantly, will rectify a wrong recently
and needlessly done. The answer is the restoration of
normal urinals in DuPont, Kohlberg, and wherever else
these foolish "no-flush" urinals have invaded.
I realize this is a somewhat sexist suggestion, it applying but accidentally to the fairer sex. Nevertheless, I
think the women, too, can get behind this, for reasons
of simple hygiene. I don't know what kind of foolish,
not-thought-through environmental reason prohibited
the use of 0.2 gallons of water per flush, but, much like
their low-flow toilet brethren, they fail to perform their
basic function, i.e., removing human waste.
Obviously, the varying nature of the waste found in
toilets versus urinals creates slightly different effects, and
the urinals do not face the same problems as their brethren. However, my friends, and I am sorry for the forthcoming language, but urine has a certain smell to it. I'm
sure the people in the biology department can tell you
what it is. The point of the matter is that these urinals
smell of urine, unlikeurinals that use water, which smell
like high school. Instead, as if a men's bathroom was not
already a smelly-enough place, thesefoolish urinals have
made them stink even more. As a humanitarian gesture
to future classes of students, I believe the Class of 2001
should move to replace all waterless urinals with waterusing versions at the earliest possible opportunity.
I thank you for your time, and may God bless
America.

I Challenge from California:
SATs should be eliminated
was Korean. Her parents owned a bunch of
successful teriyaki restaurants. She improved from somewhere in the 1100s to somewhere in the 1300s. That's a huge
leap in terms of admissions profiles.
If you think those increases don't make a difference, you're
wrong. And you have to think: at whose expense are these
inflated scores coming?
If you don't care about equal opportunity, or racial equality, or socioeconomic diversity, then
fine. The SAT can be your
baby. It's been the baby of our admissions people for a long time. If you
don't think that a goal of the admissions people, whether unstated or
not, is to increase the mean SAT in
an accepted class at this school every year you're ignoring the tacit
motivations involved. It looks good
for them. It looks good to wealthy
alumnus. It looks good to the various college ranking systems, to potential professors, to potential students, to everyone on the outside.
But you know what? Something
else would look good, too. Start a real
committee, not the pathetic sham that was and is the ARC.
Invest money in real research as Atkinson has. Weigh more
than one literary source in the decision making process.
Actually inform the Board of Managers about the issues; don't
just let them use their "gut feelings." Put someone capable
in charge for once.
One of Atkinson's main concerns was monetary. He recognized that it would take more money to make the admissions process more qualitative and less quantitative. If there's
one thing we have, it's money. We may not have class. We
certainly don't have good looks. We don't have much fun.
But we do have money. Lots of it.
Ifthe men in charge care enough, this college should put
it to use and become a real leader, not a reactionary mess of
poor decision making and embarrassing mistakes like it has
shown itself to be recently.
And hey, I never much liked the SAT anyway. You have to
sit for three hours in a crowded sweaty room in some local
junior college lecture hall to take a test that can determine,
regardless of anything you've done in your life up until that
point, where you can go to college. I never needed that kind

Hey there opinions fans. I'm crossing boundaries this
week and making a foray into the world of real, relevant
and pithy editorializing. Let's see what happens.
As you may know if you have kept up on your national
academic news, the president of the University of California, Richard C. Atkinson, recently recommended that the
state ofCalifornia should no longer
require the SAT in their college ad-" 1

It's about time, that's whatI say.

I have a feeling Atkinson has
taken a bold step that will either be
mimicked by the rest ofAmerican
academia, or will cause major reform to standardized college entrance exams. I also think
it is obvious he has taken a much more progressive and
well-informed step than did our own beloved President Al
Bloom when he decided too rashly to cancel our football
program.

The real problems that Atkinson highlighted in his
speech, delivered at the 83rd annual meeting of the American Council on Education in Washington, do more than
trivialize the football issue. They problematize the entire
process of admission into colleges and universities over the
last 20 years.
Issues thathave been ignored such as the statistic provided by Atkinson which stated thatlast year alone an estimated 150,000 kids and their parents paid over $lOO million
for coaching provided by the Princeton Review, Stanley
Kaplan and the like are receiving new attention, and for
good reason.
I don't know who has the kind of money to spend on
thosekinds ofextra classes. It certainly isn't inner-city kids.
It certainly isn't most minority groups.
I have two friends that took the SAT preparation class.
One of them had a score that jumped from 1240 to 1510, and
now she's at NYU. She's from a white, upper-class family.

Physical health key to mental health at Swat
BY TED CHAN

With the reworking of public school
schedules in America to provide more
classroom time, the importance of
physical education has been diminished. Perhaps its product is most evident at Swarthmore, where brilliant
minds often linger in uncouth, unhealthy physiques. By this I do not
mean that Swarthmore students are
unattractive, which so many say. To
the contrary, I think there are plenty
of beautiful people here. The problem
is that Swatties tend to be as inert as
argon, whichproduces negative effects
on health and mental state.
I'm willing to bet dollars to doughnuts, as my coach used to say, that
Swarthmore students are less physically active thankids at other schools.
And I'm willing to bet that at least
some of those are Al Bloom's so-called
"marginalized students." I won't pull
any punches since I know they existed
at my high school, and they went to
schools like Swarthmore and certainly
shared a certain mentality. And I won't
ridicule their plight either. I played

football and wrestled. I knew their oppressors and I won't pretend I don't
know why they associate anything athletic with negative connotations.
That said, I think people are only
hurting themselves. Just like some of
the moronic jocks I knew tuned out history and English, some Swatties were
alienated from their fast-twitch
muscles. From my observations, there

is a significantly large population of
people that goes about its business without breaking a sweat the entire semester. I know many of these people tend to
get sickand depressed more easily. That
makes sense, considering what most
clinical studies on the subject have said.
Personally, I notice the difference too.
Having something that gets me out of
my dark, dirty hole of a room on the
fourth floor of Parrish helps me focus

on my studies and makes me a gener-

ally less grouchy person. Ask anyone in

The Phoenix office how unpleasant I
was this week as I sat out six days of
baseball practice with a sprained elbow.
Why else would I join the team? To
spend more time around Scott Kushner?
Hah!
The solution isn't necessarily to join
a varsity team. It could be to join a club
team. It could be to jog. Or play IM. I
play a lot of IM. Trust me, there are a
lot of teams that could use you. They
lose every game, but still have a grand
old time. Or whack pterodactyls regularly. Or fly a kite like some dude on my
hall does. At least that's outside. I used
to have one of those kites and I got a
pretty good workout running back to
reset it to launch position.
I cringed when I heard that there was
a sexual education class at Swarthmore
where students were receiving PE
credit. A healthy career in the sack and
an active, physical lifestyle are entirely
different things. For a lot of us, it's time
to put away inhibitions towards a salubrious lifestyle and hit the weight room.
Or the baseball diamond.

"White trash"
It's come to my attention that I haven't written anything
very angry and/or bitter as of yet. This is a shame, as I
pride myself on being a very angry and bitter person. I
guess it's time to get a little spiteful. So let's have a little
chat about prejudice.
What?!, you may exclaim. Oh, please. This topic is tired
at Swarthmore. Sure, it's not perfect around here, but we

keep prejudice to a minimum.
To which I would reply, Define "prejudice." The limits I
have heard people unthinkingly place on the term have
often surprised me. It seems to me that, especially at a
self-consciously "liberal" place like Swarthmore, prejudice
is most often found where it is least looked for.
Let's leave aside, for a minute, the major point that the
living wage campaign is at last forcing us to recognize: that
prejudice is as prejudice does, and that fair and respectful
treatment matter more in deed and practice than they do
in word and theory.
Let's just deal, for a minute, with the words. We'll start

Phi Psi brothers not "sketchy' DU isn't going away
Dear Editor:
I would like to set some things straight regarding last
week's article regarding sports and parties. Neglecting the
author's use of "seedy" and "sketchy" to describe my fellow brothers, I would like to point out that the author's
opinions seem to be biased by a lack of informationand a
seemingly unnecessary and unfounded anxiety concerning "the social mantle" at Swarthmore.
It seems apparent that the author has not spent much
time at the house, even though the house is open to the entire campus most nights, even when we are not having a
SAC-funded event, though Phi Psi has held more SAC-funded
parties in the past two years than any other campus group.
It is our goal to make Phi Psi an institution that the entire
campus can rely on for a good time. Also, Phi Psi and Delta
Upsilon interact in a friendly but aggressive competition to
see which house can outdo the other. After the imposition
of the alcohol ban on DU put this rivalry on hold, many brothers from DU couldbe found hanging out in Phi Psi.
Phi Psi is a place where people ofall types, very different and opposed in some ways, can agree on the simple
reality that we are social animals, and we like to have a
place to shout, laugh, and be rowdy without placing ourselves in conflict with the rest of the campus.
David L K. Murphy 02
Alumni Relations Officer, Phi Psi Fraternity

Dear Editor:

I appreciated Anna Masilela's article last week about what
the loss ofDelta Upsilon would mean for Swat's social scene.
However, I feel that a few things need to be made clear.
While there has always been a strong connection between DU and the football team, it was never an explicit
goal of DU to recruit only football players, and now that
football is gone there is not going to be an effort to "concentrate" recruiting on any other sport. That's not what DU is
about. DU is (and always will be) about friends, brotherhood and having a good time. I think the contingent of our
fraternity that doesn't play football can assure you of that.
I strongly disagree withthe implicit assumption that the
death of football is going to bring about the death of DU. 61
fact, I believe exactly the opposite. I am very proud of DU
and its history. Sharpies, McCabe, Austrian, and many other
famous Swarthmore alumni were all DU brothers. It would
be a disgrace to them (and this school) if the current brotherhood allowed DU to die, because a rather storied part of
Swarthmore would die with it. I can assure all of you that
the brotherhood is not going to let that happen.
DU is the one thing I unequivocally love on this campus.
I intend to make sure it stays justas strong as it is now. I can
assure you that the rest of the brotherhood has made the
same commitment. DU will be around long after we are gone.

Professors leave student in senior-year nightmare
Dear Editor:
When the glossy admissions brochure pronounces the
virtues of going to a small liberal arts college, it fails to
warn the applicant of a scary but realistic disaster that is
happening to me. It is the sadfact that every now and then,
a professor can take a leave of absence, deserting the senior student in the time of most need.
The fact that all six professors who specialize in the topics
I am interested in are leaving for one reason or another would
only happen at a small-liberal arts school like Swarthmore.
So for the small minority ofreaders who have not applied to
college yet, a warning: if you decide on Swarthmore, Haverford
or any other small school where there is only one specialist
in your field, your academic plans may fall apart.
After two years of indecision, I decided to study history
and studio art and planned out my next two years. I am
not quite sure what happened to my plans. I was surprised
when Randy Exon, the oil painting professor, Robert
Weinberg, the Russian history professor, and Lillian Li,
the Chinese history professor, all happened to plan a yearlong sabbatical my senior year. Who is going to help me
set up my senior art show, I thought. How will I prepare
for my honors examination in history? Who is going to
help me write my senior thesis on China, I wondered.
With all the professors leaving my fields of concentra-

tion, I optimistically thought that I wouldjust explore other
interesting topics like art history and topics in history other
than China and Russia. I made a chart of senior-year courses
and penciled in some courses taught by professors Connie
Hungerford, T. Kaori Kitao and Maribeth Graybill. When I
was finished, I wasn't that sad that all my advisors were
leaving me. But by some twist of fate, Graybill just announced her resignation, Kitao is retiring and Hungerford
will not be teaching, either.
With my three years of Swarthmore narrowing my focus on certain subjects, I thought my senior year wouldbe a
culmination of my studies. I wanted to take the Russian
Empire seminar, learn more about Japanese prints and continue painting with Exon. Instead, I can either change my
major
and personality to physics, take a leave of absence until my beloved teachers return, or do a lot of independent studying. I hope that Exon will periodically check
his e-mail from Bali, and Li from wherever she is planning
to go. I will need to contact them when the scary honors
examiners come to test me and when I have technical problems framing a painting for my senior art show.
I fell in love with Swarthmore's low student-to-teacher
ratio of 7:L but I never imagined that a small body of professors could put me in a predicament like this.

visit a table oftheir own friends twice during the same meal,
excited at the chance to perform their "country" version of
the song. Sitting at the next table over, I can't help but notice what, other than the grossly overdone "Southern" accents, gets the biggest laugh: the house that the lead singer
claims to have purchased for his "sweetie" has, in this "country" rendition, been relocated to a trailer park.
This has got to be the nine thousandth time I've heard
the word "trailer" (you know, as in "trailer trash") used
for comic relief on this campus.
How about a little thought experiment? Let's call it
"Funny or Not Funny?".
"What the hell are you wearing? You look fresh out of
the trailer park."
Funny.

"What the hell are you wearing? You look as though
you don't have very much money."
Not funny.
Now I would like for you to explain to me the difference. What implications, what images, that make the first
statement "funny" can not be traced to the second? Did
the people in this quartet stop to think about the implicaand, more importantly,
tions of what they were singing
about what those might be to the people within earshot? I
am becoming very impatient with the "it's-all-in-good-fun"
defense. It may be so to the joker and to his or her friends,
but when it's broadcast in public, the joke isn't private any
more and you can't claim it's not offensiveunless you've
spoken to everyone who's listening.
My freshman year, someone had the brilliant idea of
showing the modern-day classic "Jerry Springer: Too Hot
for TV" in Kirby during a movie night. I'm as unhealthily
obsessed with human neuroses as the next "Survivor" fan,
and I went to watch. The presence of this movie on campus
didn't bother me. Then, within ten minutes of my (belated,
as usual) arrival at the packed auditorium, most of the
Swattie audience was energetically encouraging the screen
with one uproarious chant: "White trash! White trash!"
This did bother me. And it has every time I've heard it
thrown about on campus since, which has not been infrequently. Who shouldn't this bother? I'm not an expert in cultural or linguistic history, but I've most often heard the term
"white trash" used in movies set in the antebellum South,
wherein the modifier "white" distinguished the trash of interest from the rest of thetrash hanging around. In other words:
unless otherwise specified, "trash" is, by definition, not white.
The only thing you can always count on "trash" to be is poor.
Is my objection to this term making more sense now?
Look, "South Park" is my favorite show. I'm not saying
we should all tiptoe around issues and purge our vocabularies ofupsetting words. What I am saying is that the socioeconomic jokes I hear at Swarthmore seem less inclined toward
insightful, humoroussocial commentary thanpure, ignorant
insult. That, put simply, is prejudice, and it's sad. Most ofthe
students here were raised in privilege; it's unfortunate that
this fact is made manifest in mockery of people who weren't.
(And by the way: "South Park" is "insightful, humorous
social commentary." I'll beat up anybody who says different.)

Debating our debt to
blacks: an e-mail exchange

Randall Robinson spoke at Swarthmore last Wednesday
about his new book, "The Debt: What America Owes to
Blacks." Matt Rubin and I both attended and then exchanged e-mails. With respect and concern this Black History Month from both sides of the political aisle
we
reprint our correspondence below.

speaker tonight.

Dan
Sunday, 3:06 a.m.
Hey Dan

I have been away all weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference (ha! I was the most liberal one
there), so I couldn't get back to you until now.
Here is what I thought: Good speaker, lots of good
points, particularly about the identity of blacks in light of
the fact that their history pre-1865 is shrouded and the
effect this has on identity.
He also addressed the debt owed to blacks very well.
However, in my opinion, he failed to look adequately at
WHO should pay this debt. He gave 2 main arguments as
to why the American people should:
1) we force nazi corporations to do it even if their current staff had no connection, so we should too AND
2) we all benefit from slavery so much (ex. capital sandstone, brown u., etc)
BUT 1) he never proves why these nazi payments are
moral, he only proves that we, by encouraging them, are
hypocritical and 2) if the acceptance of such benefits is
unavoidable, then I fail to see the obligation to pay the
debt.
For instance, if you leave five dollars on my bed, I am
not obligated to give it back to you. That is essentially the
situation white Americans today are in. Sure they might
get something out of being white and from their lineal characteristics, but they never asked or even accepted this. In
fact, I would argue, it is impossible NOT to accept these
benefits, since we do not choose our race, and while we
may forsake our advantages by giving to charity or some
other means, we cannot rid ourselves of our race.
However, I liked his point that he is merely trying to
start a dialogue. I only fear that this dialogue will lead to a
payment from the U.S. government's coffers (i.e. our pockets) that we are in no way obligated to pay. If we want to,
we can donate to charity. Maybe the dialogue could be
started some other way, since it is valuable.

Hey Matt:

That is pretty funny about the conservative political action conference. Hopefully you had a good time anyway
before returning to the Bubble.
I think Robinson was a really inspirational speaker, very
compelling. But I was kind of disappointed that he didn't
present a better argument for reparations, because I've
heard people make it and I'm sure he could have done it
well. But right, as you said, by getting people to think about
how whites tendto benefit from history, regardless of what
we should do about it, is a good start.
I disagree with your #2. I think that your analogy is not
quite complex enough, because blacks didn't leave $5 on
our beds in the voluntary way that your analogy-suggests.
Here's a different example: You decide to buy some appliances from some guy at a surprisingly low price. But then
it turns out that the appliances were stolen property. Not
your fault, but you benefited and now you have to re-

turn them to their rightful owners. Poor you, it is true. But too

bad, also. I think that is a more proper analogy, but obviously
still doesn't get at all the nuances of the situation.
I don't think it ends there, but I would go so far as to say
that the government (and thus all Americans, as taxpayers)
have a moral obligation to provide reparations for what went
on before the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act of 19645. Though it is true most whites do not choose to benefit
from slavery in any conscious way (that, in fact, is part of the
problem), there is a lot of tort law that does not requireJjie
defendants to have control over a situation in order to find
them liable. But it is true, the guilt-debt distinction is difficult
to deal with.
But I don't think reparations are at all a good solution politically, to be honest. I mean, once the checks are in the mail,
your more conservative buddies will undoubtedly say, "Well,
now we're even. Good-bye outreach programs, good-bye racial preferences, good-bye social safety net." And as a social
liberal, I don't think that would be good for anybody. Note the
consequentialist/deontologist distinction here.:-)
Besides, everyone knows this country will never pay. Even
Randall Robinson must know it. At least that's my guess.
Well, I have to think of something clever for the Phoenix
column this week. It's so sad the election is over. BTW, I found
out what Ellis' insult was. It's not so bad, it just lacks sub-

stance! See you later.

You can't even decide to buy the appliances in the first
place, and even if you try to take them back, they won't let
you. Your only real option now is to just give the store money
for what you bought, which does not really rectify the problem (since the goods were stolen from someone else who,
in this case, has been dead for years), and you should in
no way be obligated by the government to do this, otherwise we would have crazy laws regulating the indirect purchase of contraband. Think about it: do people have an
obligation to research the origin of their goods and to make
amends for them?
NO

Sunday, 9:15 p.m.

Dearest Matt:
The fact that you did not decide to buy the appliances
in the first place does create a problem with the analogy.
But generally it is the case, in civil law anyway and even
when the harm was not committed by choice, that cash
serves as an adequate reparation for harm done. Now
the challenge here, and I think you've pointed this out in
some way or another (i.e. "NO"), is that slave reparations
would have to combine 2 elements:
1 The you-still-have-to-return-things-that-aren't-rightfullyyours-even-if-you-didn't-steal-them clause (the generational
problem). And
2. The you-still-have-to-pay-for-harms-even-if-you-didn'tintend-the-harm clause (the harm principle problem).
I think you can combine them. However, as again indicated by your "NO" line, most Americans aren't going to
go along with that. Do you ever read Slate? (You wouldn't
like it too much.) They post their staff writers' memo exchanges about things like this as they write them.
YES

gradually severed ties with the Religious
Society of Friends in the early 1900s. But the admis
sions office still makes routine visits to Quaker high
schools. The community service sector stands as a model
for other schools. There are countless committees here, and
decision-making tends to takes forever. Students pay an
activities fee, which makes accessible everything from genetics lectures to gin and tonics.
But one student, who was raised Quaker, said she sees
students calling on Quaker principles only when they "want
to get things done." A Quaker professor said she certainly
does not feel she works at a Quaker institution. And, though
Quakers are actively recruited by admissions, they comprise only one to two percent of the student body, according
to Acting Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O.
Protestant advisor Pauline Allen, who is Quaker, hears
questions "every year" about the extent to which the college is Quaker. After nine years at the college, she thinks
she finally has an answer.
"Swarthmore is more Quaker than you might think it
is," she said, "and less Quaker than I might like."

Swarthmore's Quaker History

The college's history is deeply rooted in Quakerism. In
1864, it was established by the religious education sector of
the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.
Allen said Swarthmoor Hall in England
the college's
namesake and the home of Margaret Fell, a Quaker leader
provided a haven for early Quakers who had been persecuted because of their beliefs.

Several other prominent Quakers played a role in the college. Lucretia Mott, a major player in the women's suffrage
movement, was one of the college's founders. JohnWoolman,
namesake of the student residence, made it his mission to
stop Quakers from owning slaves in the 1700s, well before the
Civil War brought such change to all ofAmerica.

QUAKER

BYLILLIE

DREMEAUX

Swarthmore officially became a nonsectarianinstitution
during the early part of the 20th century. Nevertheless, the
student body continued as mostly Friends until the 19205,
and it was not until 1938 that non-Quakers began to serve
on the Board of Managers.
The college continues to be influenced by the ideas and
practices of "unprogrammed" Quakerism. Centered in Britain and on the East Coast of the United States, this minority strain of Quakerism has no hired ministers and practices silent worship with spontaneous vocal ministry. Moreover, as compared with programmed and evangelical Quakerism, this brand of Quakerism tends to have greater involvement in leftist politics and more universalist beliefs.

Equal Access for All Students
Allen pointed to the Student Activities Fee as a prime
example of the college as "more Quaker than you might
think."

One principle behind the SAF, Allen said, is equality.
Another is "right sharing" of resources, and a third is sim-

plicity.

"We feel that it is wrong to make a show of wealth," Allen
said. The SAF makes it possible for all students to attend
concerts, lectures, most parties and other special events free
of charge. Because the fee is a part of tuition, the theory is
that no student pays the SAF who cannot afford it, and, consequently, no one misses cultural or social opportunities
because ofhis or her economic status.
Swarthmore also gives financial support to service
projects, especially in the realm of social service. The strong
presence of activism on campus attests to that, as do institutions such as the Swarthmore Foundation and Lang Op-

portunity Scholarships.
Student and faculty diversity is another example of
Quaker influence, Allen said.
Indeed, a recent article published in The Phoenix made

a case for Swarthmore's having a better record than many
schools with regard to placing professors of color in tenuretrack positions. The same record applies to student diversity: students of color comprise about 40 percent of the class
of 2004.
Moreover, Allen said Swarthmore's plethora of committees, which discuss issues ranging from dining services to
budgeting issues to ethical investing, is part of the college's
Quaker heritage, along with "the long time it takes to talk
about everything."

Quakerism in the Classroom

The Quaker legacy is also reflected in the college's focus
on personal empowerment. "You can be an agent of transformation here," Allen said. "There's a belief that you make
a difference."
She pointed to Swarthmore's ongoing choice to remain
a tiny school with a low faculty-to-student ratio as an example of such commitment. Professors are hired primarily
as instructors, not researchers, and their responsibility is
to empower each student through attentive instruction and
development of personal rapport. It is Allen's impression
that most professors strive for egalitarian interaction with
their pupils.
Spanish professor Christine de Grado, who is Quaker,
said her religious beliefsaffect how she teaches. "Believing
there's that of God in every person changes your relationship with a student," she said, citing attention to every individual as one of her goals. Also, as a member of a meeting, she has grown accustomed to "silence in the classroom,"
which she believes is crucial when teaching a language.
Yet Anna Morgan 'O4, a lifelong Quaker, says she has
"never applied Quakerism to an academic setting before."
She believes students interested in her faith should be offered

a "means to understand" the faith, but the only course
work relating to Friends is religion professor Jerry
Frost's class on Quakerism. For a school whose student
body and publicity materials call on Quakerism so frequently, she said, there is little interest in actual practice of the faith.
Morgan started a Young Friends Society this year,
she said, but it hasn't really taken off. "On a good day,
we have ten [people show up]," she said. The group has
recently begun an effort to promote more interest
through flyers on campus. However, compared to the
demographics of her home in California, Morgan said
Swarthmore has "tons of Quakers."

In the aftermath of the Board of Managers' surprise decision
to cut football and wrestling and demotebadminton from varsity
to club status, many students have summoned Quaker values in
an attempt to understand how the board works and what, exactly, went astray in December.
Following the board's announcement, signs plastered all over
campus showcased an image of the Quaker Oats man. Some students proclaimed the board had violated Quaker tradition. The
football team's petition clearly statedthat the board had violated
the custom of consensus, a practice vital to a "Quaker school,"
although Swarthmore has been non-sectarian for nearly a century.

Quaker student Anna Morgan 'O4 said the "student body exemplifies Quakerism more than the administration does" and
that "they're saying one thing and doing another."
But a conversation with Dulany Ogden Bennett '66
Swarthmore athlete, twelve-year board member, and lifelong
Quaker revealed that the supposed violation of Quaker principle was not as cut and dry as many students were led to be-

The Link to Social Service
According to Allen, Swarthmore's accomplishments in
the areas ofservice and social justice are no smallfeat for

such a tiny school. Allen attended Cornell as an undergraduate and earned her master's degree at Harvard. In
contrast to her experiences there, she said, Swarthmore
makes the assumption that "people who come here will do
some social service. That's not true other places."
Pat James, director of community service, agreed
that "social service is much more embedded in the values of the institution than at other schools."
From attending conferences with other college service directors, she said, she has learned that other institutions actually have service requirements, "erasing
the notion that service is a lifelong commitment."
James has also been questioned about how she recruits people for her community service program at
Swarthmore.
"My answer is, T don't,' she said proudly. "We really do have quite a high number of people involved in
service in comparison with other schools."
James said student-founded tutoring programs, such
as Learning for Life, for staff members, and Positive
Alternatives in Chester, for children, are models for
other colleges aiming to establish similar programs.
She also said many schools do not have undergradu-

ate community service options like Summer of Service,

the Lang Open Competition for social service grants,
and the Swarthmore Foundation, which provides grants
for service.
"It is because we are resource-rich," James said, that
the college has such programs, "but there are a lot of

resource-rich institu-

tions that don't direct
their resources that way.

Swarthmore puts civic

ofits mission."

The Spiritual Dimension
These testaments to Quakerly service are embedded
in the college's formerly religious concern with social
justice. Although the school is now secular, Allen still
describes them as coming "from a spiritual place.
"A lot of people forget that [the Society of Friends is]
a religious body," she said. It is easy to see Quakerism
from a secular or even political point of view, she said,
because so much of its reputation lies in advocacy for
civil rights and justice issues.
But this advocacy is based on the principle that
"there is that of God in every person," Allen said. That
tenet is what brings many Quakers to fight for human
rights, for example, or to oppose the death penalty, or to
work for equal rights for lesbians and gays.
According to Quaker principles, all people can be
ministers, as long as they serve the world through whatever craft, profession or art form they feel called to.
"If you can serve God through journalism," Allen said
as an example, "then you're a minister of journalism."
Because of its wide definition offaith and service and
emphasis on the individual, Allen said that Quakerism
is "not a creed-based religion." Letting your life speak

"I don'tthink it's fair to let students believe they can go

Pauline Allen, a Quaker and the Protestant advisor,
leads a group discussion. Allen hopes that the college
will return to its spiritual roots in Quakerism.
through humane actions, she said, is more important to
Quakers thanbelieving the "right thing" or preaching.
For instance, although George Fox, who foundedthe
first Friends Meeting, was Christian, Quakers can be
members of any other church.
"Your personal relationship with God is what's important," Allen said. "So if God calls you to be a Muslim, you can still be Quaker."
In Allen's opinion, it is unfair to expect students to
adhere to the Quaker commitment to social justice without giving them somewhere to go for spiritual support.
"How can people be expected to go change the world

THE PHOENIX

Allen said, although she
conceded that what one defines as "beyond oneself
could take theform of a family or even a hobby such as
running.
Although she acknowledges that her position at
Swarthmore is to provide

support for students interested in Protestantism,
Allen said she wishes the
college would return to the "divine mandate." When students seek their niches, she said, "part of that development has a spiritual component."
But knowing that Swarthmore does not foresee returning to its religious roots, Allen points out other ways
in which the school could better embody the principles
of non-violence, social justice, and the empowerment of
the individual.
"I don't think there should be a gun club," she said,
referring to the new target-shooting organization on campus. "I don't think there should be exams on Sundays."
Pat James mentioned a workshop about spirituality
and social change that took place about a year ago. Its
intention was to act as a "forumfor those who felt spiritual about service," she said.
But the workshop sparked controversy, with some
accusing its coordinators of imposing religion on activists and others saying it downplayed the role of spirituality in service.
Although Pat James is not Quaker and serves no
spiritual post at the college, she agreed withAllen's view
that finding spiritual support might be a way for some
students to keep from becoming, in her words, "burned
out on service."
"We don't leave a lot of room

in our lives for admit-

ting a need for [spirituality]," James said.

lieve.
Consensus as unanimity, she said, is not a practice of the
board. Instead, the members have traditionally striven to determine a "sense of the meeting." As a clerk for many Quaker organizations, head of American Friends Service Committee, and
member of Friends Counsel on Education, Bennett has had extensive experience with decision-making and sense of the meeting.
During Quaker meetings, she said, Friends "meditate, pray,
and seek God's will" to determine the sense of the meeting. The
practice is religious in nature. A commitment to these principles
exists even when Friends are meeting with non-Quaker individu-

als.
Sense of the meeting has been used in the board's decisions,
Bennett said, because it prevents the formation of "a victorious
majority and a defeated minority" and forces members to reexamine their views and possible alternatives.
As decision-makers for a secular institution, the Swarthmore
Board of Managers has adopted a secular version of this custom.
A tradition only, this practice is not mandated by any kind of
statute.

Nevertheless, it is a tradition of long endurance; the ARC decision was the first time in twelve years during which votes were
cast.
However, Bennett said that every board member agreed to
render a decision that day, debunking an assumption that the
board had kept its decision a secret.
The board realized its views were too different, she said, to
come to a common sense of the meeting. The members of the
board then agreed to vote on the issue to ensure honesty with
incoming and current students about the athletic issues at hand.
If they had thought it responsible to postpone the decision,
Bennett said, they would have done so.
Speaking on behalf of the minority votes, she said that those
who were opposed to dropping football felt the board needed to
make its choice in order to give coaches, players and potential

students an answer.

"Not being required to make every decision by consensus,"
Bennett said, "we made an exception for what we believed were

compelling reasons."
In order to maintain ties to Quakerism, Bennett said, the Board
of Managers has traditionally wanted to have a few Friends as
members. She believes there are currently "four or five" Quakers among the board's 37 members.
But Quaker influence goes beyond numbers to have a real
effect on the decisions it makes.
"We have a long tradition of training people who are going to
make changes in society," Bennett said. She considers theboard's
determination to embody "ethical intelligence" to be a refraining
of the Quaker testimony to "that of God in each person," citing
community service and diversity of students and faculty as ex-

amples of how to make a liberal arts education benefit others.
"A lot of the traditions held by the Society of Friends have
been translated into a modern, secular version of Quaker values," Bennett said.
She mentioned board practices of the mid- to late-1980s and
early 1990s as more representative of such values than the recent
measures the boardfelt it had to take. In those years, divestment
and the honors program were big topics.
"There was no urgency except wanting to do the right thing,
so we weren't under time pressure," Bennett said. "Because it
was an open and active topic, there were lots of ways to discuss it
widely with the community over a long period of time."
Unfortunately, she said, with the ARC case, the board "didn't
get onto it early enough to draw it out over several years."

Americans unfortunately don't pay enough attention to
many nations in the world, some of which have cultures and

customs that, if we only took the time to study, would provide
rich joke material and act as excellent objects of ridicule. For
this reason, I have chosen two far-off lands to edify with my
insightful and thought-provoking commentary. That is, I will
make a slew ofinsensitiveand pig-headed cultural generalizations, which, if taken seriously, will lead directly to war with
several irate foreign powers.
The first nation is Sweden. Disclaimer: I haven't actually
studied the history or culture of Sweden, nor have I ever visited. I have, however, eaten more than my share ofSwedish
fish. My treatment ofSwedish culture will be entirely based on
the foreign-exchange student my uncle housed for a year. And,
although it's possible he was from Norway, we'll consider that
to be good enough.
The particular exchange program through which my uncle
received this Swedish student was: Help Support a Foreign Student Who, Owing to the Politeness ofHis Culture, Will Do All
ofYour HouseholdChoresfor Free, UnlikeThose Spoiled American Bastards, Your Cliildren. In the spirit ofthis title, my uncle
acquainted his student with American culture such that, if
anyone back home ever asks whether he knows how to install
skylights in a four-bedroom American ranch house, he can
proudly respond in the affirmative.
The student's name this should not elicit much surprise
—was Magnus. Every male in Sweden is named Magnus. This
tradition is eloquently stated in the Swedish Declaration of
Independence (author: Magnus Jefferson): "We the people of
Sweden (or Norway can anyone really tell the difference?)
hold thesetruths to be self-evident:that all men shall be named
Magnus..."
Several times I heard Magnus on the phone with his parents. They conversed in what I suspect was Swedish, although
I can't be certain. You must consider that, in many countries
over there, e.g., Denmark, they often do not speak their native
tongue (Denmarkish). Instead, to keep Americans guessing,
they speak some mysterious language whose namesake is a
pastry. Nevertheless, I believe that Swedes are not nearly so

devious as Denmarkians.
At least two-thirds oftheSwedish language, I am convinced,
consists of completely meaningless noises calculated merely
to arouse laughter, akin to Larry, Moe and Curly's famous
"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk." Just picture a few Magnuses sitting at
the local Swedish pub laughing heartily and slapping their
thighs as they exclaim, "har ar nagot misstank!"
Concerning linguistics, one thing I noticed about Magnus,
aside from the ridiculousness of his own language, is that he
spoke English in a very antiquated way. My theory is that the
only English textbook still circulating Sweden is "Sir Edwin
Shirlock's Guide to the Syntax and Style of 18th-century
Learned English Prose." It got so that I actually thought I was
conversing with the reincarnation of King Magnus I. For example, he once spotted a cute girl sitting alone at a restaurant
and approached her, saying: "Madam, I implore your forgiveness for my unbecoming manner of interrupting your solitary
meal, but I am desirous ofknowing how it came that so radiant
a lady should be seated alone."
Amazingly, heleft withher number. I believe, however, that
thishad nothing to dowithhis words, because I tried theabove
line on at least three subsequent occasions and, while I did get
a phone number each time, it invariably turned out to be for
"The Psychiatric Services ofDr. J. Palmer Schulz." The fact is,
women were automatically attracted to Magnus' Swedish visage, such that he could have said, "Hey you, come here" and
they'd have beencharmed. The Swedish, in general, are quite
good-looking; the female population, for instance, consists entirely of gorgeous 26-year-old masseuses. If international disputes are ever settledby large-scale diplomatic beauty pageants,
Sweden will surely secure dominion over the entire inhabitable world.
Still, despite its marked excellence in the vanity department, Sweden has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.
This is because Sweden, being so far north, gets very little sunlight most ofthe year, which prevents the populace from maintaining a natural year-round tan, which, in turn, makes them
excessively grumpy. As a result, the Swedish, though gener-

Audrey Chan Phoenix Staff

ally a convivial bunch, can encounter sharp mood-swings and
suddenly take their lives, even over trivial matters. A typical
scene from the Swedish drama oflife might go something like

this:
Magnus returns home after a hard day at work.
MAGNUS: Hi, honey, what's for dinner? Meatloaf?!
Again?!
The sound of a handgun being fired.
...

Having finished with Sweden on that upbeat note, the next
place of consideration is Alaska. Now, I realize that, technically, Alaska is not a foreign country. But it's so damn detached
and, more importantly, there are so many distasteful ways to
make fun of it, that it warrants attention here.
My roommate is Alaskan and, over the course of the year,
he has spouted endless Alaska trivia, all of which I, an openminded New Yorker, wholly disregarded, instead directing my
energies toward masterminding nicknames for him. Examples:
Igloo Boy and Eskimo Ken.
How the United States actually acquired Alaska has always
been somewhat puzzling. I recall the following question from a
tenth-grade American history exam:
When Secretary ofState William Seward purchased Alaska,
what thehell was he thinking?
(a) "It can't be much worse than New Jersey."
(b) "I've always wanted my name to be remembered in con-

junction with the word 'folly.'"
(c) "Did I take my medication today?"

The Russians still giggle uncontrollably when they consider
how they got us to pay money for that God-forsaken place.
"Americans have the brains of driftwood," they think. "Next
thing you know, they'll want to buy Siberia."
But, since we're stuck with it, it might be well to ask how
Alaskafits into the greater scheme ofthings. Politically, Alaska
tends to be rather conservative. For instance, under existing
state statute, shooting homosexuals for sport is permitted with
a license, except on days of holy obligation, at which time one
shall refrain from harming them, unless one gets in your
way while you're mushing your sled to church."
Unfortunately, I must end my cultural commentary, with
so much yet unsaidabout many wonderfulnations ofthe world.
The toilets of Taiwan, the fins ofFinland and the narcotics of
Nicaragua will all have to wait their turn. For thetime being, if
you have any questions, I'll be at the masseuse.
"

This review has a story attached to it. As some of you
probably know, the movie shuttle is not running. Your
intrepid reviewer, however, on her way to see the new
Weitz brothers' comedy "Down to Earth," could hardly be
dissuaded by as small an obstacle as that. My vancertified friend volunteered to rent a vehicle (and, since
this was on my behalf, charge it to The Phoenix).
So a small group of us wound over to Marple, where I
must, by editorial injunction, see all my movies.
Unfortunately, a lady with long blue nails greeted us at
the front of the line with the news that there were "only
two tickets left." As we debated, those two got swiped.
But since we had the van, we decided to try elsewhere.
A vapid blonde lady with a Bio-Pop in a video store gave
us directions to MacDade and we arrived only 45
minutes after the last showing started. We caught a
tired employee leaving the theater and pleaded our
case, and she waved us in free.
What with previews and ads, we missed less than
half an hour. Since I knew the general plot, I prompted
the others: Lance, a black stand-up comedian (Chris
Rock, also coincidentally, a black stand-up comedian) is
killed. Only, on entering Heaven, he finds that the two
angels managing his case, played by Chazz Palminteri
and Eugene Levy, have taken him too early.
Their solution lies in depositing him back on Earth in
the only available body, the one belonging to WASPy
capitalist Charles Wellington 111. Lance's spirit falls in

JUST IMAGINE RUSH
LIMBAUGH RAPPING. SURELY
YOU'D CLOCK HIM, TOO.
love with Suntee (Regina King, from "Jerry Maguire"), a
socially conscious young black woman. As the audience
perceives Lance in Chris Rock form, he and Suntee
make a classy couple. But she and the rest of the world
see Lance as a balding Republican. Funny sequences
serve as reminders, like Lance's getting carried away
rapping to DMX in public and being beaten up by
enraged black passers-by. Just imagine Rush Limbaugh
rapping. Surely you'd clock him, too.
Eventually, Suntee succumbs to Lance's new
charitable impulses and his persistent stock romanticcomedy antics, and he wins her heart. She explains
away the implausibility by insisting, "There's something
about your eyes." This "something" enables her to look
past his race, age and general unattractiveness to see
his true colors. Flashback to "Save the Last Dance"
this seems to be this season's motif.
The most entertaining sequences are Rock's
monologues. He's a sharp comedian with a great sense
of timing. A subplot has him desperate to get back
onstage at the Apollo even in his new physical condition,
and he arranges practice performances before his
household staff, at which the audience laughs as loudly
as the employees, even though they aren't getting paid.
Still, most of the lines not penned by Rock fall flat and
the audience ultimately groans as often as it laughs.
There doesn't seem to be any real message to this
uneven, mildly uplifting flick, except that the world would
be a better place if compassionate young men took over
the bodies of aging CEOs. That, and, as Rock points out in
a final routine, looks matter unless you're sufficiently
funny and loaded, in which case they don't.
If you can't find a way to get to and into the theater
for free, my advice is, don't bother.

Number-crunching
for screw dates
BY KATEY O'DONNELL

A gut-wrenching panic stirs within me. I am
trying to stay cool, but it's not easy. "Why?" you
ask. Is my thesis due? Uh, no. I haven't even
declared my major yet. And no one in my family is
on his or her death bed.
It's Screw. Now, I know it's lame to get all
worked up about a measly dance, but come on!
First of all, we are talking high stakes. I have less
than two weeks to work with. So I've done some
calculations to help pinpoint my odds and narrow
down the possibilities.
The school boasts approximately 1400 people.
Things look good at this point. I mean, 1400
people that's quite a pool, eh? And, presumably,
all of these people are intelligent and talented,
which should make Swattie setups much more
enticing than in the outside world.
Hah.
First, I have to eliminate over half of those
prospects, as I am only interested in dating men

I MEAN, I JUST NEED ONE
PERSON. AND IT'S JUST ONE
DATE. WE'RE NOT TALKING
MARRIAGE HERE.
in fact, even just "males" will do

and this school

has more women than men. Down to about 700.
Now, of these, how many are themselves
interested in dating men? Honestly, I have no idea,
but I am going to err on maybe a few hundred,
which leaves me with 500, give or take. Still not
bad. I mean, I just need one. And it's just one
date. We're not talking marriage here. Back to the
math.
500 possibilities. Excluding those already
taken. And, given that this is the Quaker
Matchbox, that cuts my number in half. At least.
So 250 it is. From there, I gotta figure that some
are not interested in dating, some are pursuing
other people, some are strictly friend material and
some are only interested in the alternative
implication of "screw."
That leaves me with approximately 3.7 options.
Two of them are already screwed and,
unfortunately, the rest happen to be going abroad.
Mulling all of these digits over in my head, I hear
warning bells. Maybe I can transfer. No, no need
for that. Not yet, at least. I would have to endure
the humiliation of rejection before seriously
entertaining the idea of transferring. And there's
still more than a week to work with except that,
according to my calculations, I am sort of outta
luck. So it's pretty much a hopeless cause. I am
doomed. No screw for me.
Then again, maybe my calculations were a bit
off. I was screwed last year, as were many other
people. And I'm sure a lot of people will be
screwed again this year. So forget the arbitrary
calculations.
Right? Right? For the love of God, tell me that's
right! Otherwise all of this dread and doom will
have been warranted.And then what? Go stag? To
the ONE occasion that every Swattie actually
crawls out of their holes to attend? This is serious.
if I were a guy, I'd just head to Bryn Mawr, but, as
it stands, things are looking grim.
Or maybe I should just chill. After all, it's not
really my problem, right? My darling roommate
gets to deal with these shabby odds. I can just sit

Scenes tackle realism, absurdity
BY DANIEL MARRIN
"It's surprising how few people there are that dare in this
world to say what's in their hearts," says Dr. Jon Buchanan as
he calms his attractive young patient, Ms. Alma, on one long
night in Mississippi. The setting: the small town of Glorious Hills.
The year: 1913. Young Ms. Alma has arrived at Dr. Jon's doorstep, suffering from a fit of hysteria. Dr. Jon, a magna cum laude
Johns Hopkins grad, is about to give his patient a close-up examination, and as he gets closer, a dangerous attraction begins

to develop.
This tight scene, from Tennessee Williams's "Eccentricity of
a Nightingale," is one of two being presented this weekend by
Directing HI studentsKiran Rikhye 'O2 and Jon Stancato 'O2, the
only two students who are taking the class this year. Last semester in Directing n, Rikhye tackled a scene from the farce "The

School for Wives," while Stancato took on the a scene from the
psychological realist play "Kiss of the Spider Woman." This semester, theatre professor Ursula Denzer asked the students to
switch genres. Rikhye is now directing an excerpt ofthe psychological realist play "Eccentricity," and Stancato is taking on a
scene from Samuel Beckett's absurdist farce "Waiting for Godot."
On the bare Frear Theatre set of "Eccentricity," a blue light,
set off to the side, gives a sense oflate night, a sense enhanced by
the pajamas androbes worn by the two characters. There is nothing onstage but a small white couch, and a tableholding a doctor's
stethoscope and a bottle of brandy. Eventually, Dr. Jon will use
both ofthese to cure Ms. Alma's ills. The two actors, Steve Salter
'O2 as Dr. Jon, and Adrienne Mackey 'O4 as Ms. Alma, build the
emotional intensity as Ms. Alma moves from apprehensive to
enraged, with Dr. Jon attempting in vain to soothe her.
Suddenly, the director speaks in the rehearsal, and the two
actors break out of their characters and humbly apologize for
missing their lines. Rikhye asks the actors to explain what is
happening within their characters when the actors decide to
make certain moves. Later, when Mackey explains how she will
express Ms. Alma's feelings for Jon, Rikhye replies assuredly,
"Commit to that."
Rikhye came across the scene after discovering "Summer and
Smoke," a work which was revised in the late 1940s into "An
Eccentricity of Nightingales." This scene is taken from the middle
of that work. Rikhye chose it especially for its collapsing of the
major themes of lust and shame, which come together to form
one vibrant portrayal of a relationship between a man and

woman.
A few minutes later, the "Eccentricity" set is gone, and a shopping cart is thrown on the floor along with pieces of trash and
old newspapers. The lighting is suddenly more harsh than before
while "Eccentricity" was all about the long, hot night,
this scene from "Waiting for Godot" takes place in a never-ending daytime.
Stancato brings out his actors for warm-ups, asks for more
trash. The warm-ups include stretches, a well-enunciatedalphabet, and a strange exercise in which the actors cave in whining
"PRUNE" and then jump and wag their tongues, exclaiming "BA-

NANA!" Clearly, they are training for theater of the absurd.
The scene begins with Estragon (Danielle Keifert 'O4) sleeping soundly inside her shopping cart, then Vladimir (Jesse Taylor 'O3) waking and feeding his partner in near-silence. Eventually, these two protagonists meet the master-slave combo of the
brash Pozzo (Felicia Leicht 'O4) and Lucky (Hunter Wells 'O2), the
latter of whom carries all Pozzo's bags and walks underthe leash
of his boss. The scene deals principally with Pozzo's sadism toward Lucky. Vladmir and Estragon confuse Pozzo for their longawaited acquaintance Godot, then the two attempt to liberate
Lucky from Pozzo's "care," only to encounter an unexpected result. While the action is slapstick, there is certainly a dark side
to this piece.
Stancato chose the scene because it had its own internal logic;
a beginning, middle, and end. He wanted a relieffrom working
with only men, but in reviewing farces, he grew sick of plays
that objectified women, having them "run around in bra and
panties" for a laugh, as he put it. The solution was to choose an
all-male farce in which gender was not essential to the characters. Beckett's piece is about humanity more than about masculinity, so Vladmir and Estragon can work as a male-female duo,
according to Stancato, withoutsexual tension. Thus, it turns out
that Stancato in "Godot" is seeking the exact opposite ofthe heat
Rikhye is seeking between her leads in "Eccentricity."
The two pieces are brief, the whole show under an hour. The
Directing HI scenes will be performed in Frear Theatre on Saturday night at 8 and on Sunday at 2 p.m. Come see two talented
S watties bring to life the work oftwo of the greatest playwrights
of the last century.

Jill Sigman is bringing her improvisational, innovaindependent dance to campus. Offering Swat a
sneak preview of a new work made possible by a
Swarthmore Project Residency from July 2000, she will
perform "Vision Begins," a piece that aesthetically intertwines physical movement with vocal and visual effects. Sigman's work echoes themes of personal vision,
feminist struggle and the legacy of the 1960s for her generation. Past pieces have focused on questions of embodiment, gender and social issues. The point of what
Sigman has dubbed Thinkdance is not to merely look
pretty onstage, but rather to inspire thought and personal interpretation. Sigman will perform Saturday
night at 8 p.m. in the Troy Dance Lab. Arrive early to
avoid large lines and mad mobs and to score a suitable
seat. As a performance follow-up, she will teach a workshop on Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Troy Dance Lab in LPAC.

Psychic tricks with the administration Al and Bob revealed
—

Dear Swarthmore,
Al Bloom, President of Swarthmore College. You know of him, but do you really know him? You know he has an office on the second floor of Parrish
that's bigger thanBob's and way nicer than Tedd's. Sometimes he shoots hoops with the Board of Managers. He doesn't really score too much, but at the
end of every game, he dumps a bottle of Gatorade on Eugene Lang's head. Well, okay, we don't actually know that, but wouldn't it be cool if he did?
We at Spike were curious about Al Bloom. We wanted to get inside his head, poke around in the gray matter, run a cauterizing iron through the
synaptic endings, log the results on a supercomputer, and fiddle with them until we got bored. But that was expensive, and Marvin said we could only
use our budget for "publishing costs." So we sent Ester Bloom (get it? Bloom? Bloom?) out to read his tarot cards, figuring we'd come up with pretty
much the same stuff. Make ofit what you will. Insert your controversy of choice (living wage? alcohol policy? pink, heart-shaped Valentinebagels?), and
assign us a firm, unwavering position advocating the opposite side, because, you know, that's humorous. Don't forget to look at Dean Bob Gross's palm

more thoughtful. Less inclined to violence. It also means mourning and separation, and it could refer to some other matter altogether. [New card the Wheel ofFortune, like the game show]

Ester: Yeah, the king of swords. That's surprising. This
card is generally a man in power, a man with a lot ofauthority. It's also someone who's not afraid to wield that authority.
It's a very strong, authoritative figure. Um, very masculine, that's what the swords represent, and he's the king of
that suit.
Al: [something something] violence.

That's a card of seclusion, so it says that you want is just to

bothered by these external things. It's the hermit. It means
you want time to reflect.
Al: Okay.
Ester: And maybe figure all of this out.

Al: Okay.
Ester: Absolutely. [New card the Nine of Cups] This is

Al: The unpredictable future, huh?

wonderful thing about this card is that it means a lot of it

something.
Al: Well, maybe I would have liked a more direct path,
but... [laughs]
Ester: You have to amble your way through. So, if you
have any questions, I can address those, if you'd like.
Al: Well, I think I need the time to sort of stand back

and think about this process, now that I've learned so much

in the 100 breast with a 58.5 L Along with Whitehead, Dudley received medals in all of his individual events, including the 200 back (third, 1:58.31) and
the 200 IM (second, 1:57.39). On the final night of the championships, the
Garnet men stole a bronze in the 800 free relay with a 7:10.29 (Sherer, Chris
Bussard 'O3, Whitehead and Lillvis). The Swarthmore men placed third in
the conference, with a totalof 503 points and 13 medals (four gold, five silver
and four bronze).
The Garnet women entered the meet with a Centennial Conference record
of 4-3. Because of the blowout by Gettysburg, they were expected to battle for
second place with Washington College. In the first night of finals, the Garnet
women began with a gold in the 400 medley relay with a 4:04.48 (Becca HowesMischel 'Ol, Natalie Briones 'O3, Alice Bonarou 'O2 and Davita Burkhead-Weiner
'O3). In the 50-yard free, the Garnet captured the silver (Briones, 24.93) and
bronze (Leah Davis '04,25.93). Bonarou was one of the two Swarthmore women
who received medals for all individual events: 200 IM (third, 2:14.38), 100 fly
(59.66) and 200 fly (second, 2:12.09). Bonarou's 200 fly time was also a "B" cut
for qualifying for the NCAA Division 111 Nationals.
"I was extra pleased and impressed with the way we swam day one, and
then one swimmer pointed out that we were in first place by seven points,"
said head coach Sue Davis. "Then that swimmer said, 'We should take a
picture of that.' I agreed and told her to take a picture because it probably
won't stay that way. I've seen it before."
On Saturday evening, the Garnet women continued to swim lifetime and
college bests. The 200 medley relay team (Tara Trout 'O4, Briones, Bonarou
and Davis) took home a silver with a time of 1:53.18. Briones was the other
swimmer to receive medals for all individual events, including the 50 free
and 100 breast (first, 1:08.92) and 100 free (second, 54.57). After a remarkable
last lap for the 100 breast, Briones exclaimed, "I'm BACK!"
"At the endof thesecond night, we were ahead by 36 points," saidDavis. "At
11 p.m. that night I told my women that if they were going to have the meet of
their lives then they had better have it on February 18,2001, 'cause we've got a
shot at winning this thing."
The next day, the Swarthmore women's swim team had the meet of their
lives. One of the big events was the 200 back, with Swarthmore placing four
swimmers in the top sixteen: Howes-Mischel (second, 2:12.69), Alissa Parmelee
'Ol (fourth, 2:15.01), Trout (seventh, 2:18.05) and Brandyn White 'O3 (2:20.82).
Captain Howes-Mischel commented, "It was an amazing end to my swimming
career and I am impressed by how the entire team came together to win." The
women ended up with 16 medals (three gold, eight silver and five bronze).
"During the 20-minute break before the last relays, I met with the relay
swimmers and told them that the only way we would lose this meet is if
both relays were to be disqualified," said Davis. "It was excellent swimming
and determination that won the championship. If we took one person's performance out of the score, we would have lost the meet that's how much
of a team effort it was."
The Garnet women won their first Centennial Conference Championship by 40 points (Swarthmore 679, Gettysburg 639, Washington 590).
Gettysburg hadheld the CC crown for seven years and had not lost a conference meet in the past six years.

Men's lacrosse players preparing for the season opener at Mary Washington on Feb. 24
BY MIKE LLOYD
This spring, the Swarthmore men's lacrosse team returns five starters and looks to improve on last
year's 8-6 record. Last year was a breakout year for the Tide, which sported a stingy defense and highscoring offense. The team ended the season by competing for the ECAC Southern Championship. This
year the Tide hopes to turn some heads by making a run at the Centennial Conference playoffs.
The attack unit returns two starters, including two-time captain Mark Dingfield 'Ol, a four-year
starter who has tallied 94 goals and 44 assists in the past three seasons. Than Court 'O3 will be expected to continue the success of his rookie season (25 goals, 18 assists). Rookie Joe DeSimone, 'O4
joins Dingfield and Court as the third starter. DeSimone is a solid athlete who played well in the fall
season. His strong shot will be a welcome addition to the offense.
The midfield returns two starters, captain Blake Atkins 'O2 and John Murphy 'O3. Atkins, one of the
best all-around players in the conference and a two-time All-Centennial pick, looks to provide strong
leadership in scoring (32 goals, 29 assists), face-offs (64 percent) and ground balls (173). Murphy returns
as last year's team leader in scoring (28 goals, 22 assists). Darren Wood 'Ol has also been a steady contributor to the team with experience and strong stick skills. Last year, Wood was honored as an Academic All-Conference selection. Coby Smith 'O2 returns this spring to add some speed and athleticism to
the midfield. Last year Smith saw increasing playing time and scored four goals and six assists. Rookie
John Cleaver 'O4 showed great potential during fall ball and will be fighting for a position on either the
first or second lines. NealHalloran 'O4 looks like he will provide a great option on face-offs.
The defense will be lead by Charles Fischette 'Ol, a three-year starter who has collected 115 career ground
balls. Fischette will be called on this year to lead a young defense that graduated two starters. Joining
Fischette on the starting defense line will be Mike Wham 'O4 and Mike Weiner 'O4. Both showed blazing
speed and solid play during fall ball.
At long stick midfield, the Tidereturns two-year starter Jason Choi 'O2 after a semester in Australia. Choi is a smart team defender with strong stick checks and a real nose for picking \ip ground balls
(163). Rookie Tim Cheng 'O4 will compete for playing time. Cheng had a successful fall season and will
look to continue his good play this spring.
C.J. Riley 'Ol and Steve Isbister 'O4 will fight for the goalie position this spring. Either player may
get the nod for the starting position, depending on his play during the preseason and first few games.
Riley converted from midfield a year ago and is quickly becoming a complete goalkeeper after seeing
some time last year. Isbister was impressive this fall and hopes to continue his early success.
The Tide opens a strong schedule away on Saturday, Feb. 24, against Mary Washington. The Garnet can be first seen at home on March 3, when they host Manhattanville.

The men's tennis team opened its regular season this past Saturday against Division I Temple University.
The Temple Owls annually finish in the top halfof theAtlantic 10 Conference and this year proudly boast the
tenth-ranked player in the eastern region. Through stellar individualperformances in the singles matches,
the team overcame an early Temple onslaught to defeat the Owls 4-3.
The Garnet began the day slowly, only winning one ofthree doublesmatches. The lone doubles triumph
came from JustinSinger 'O3 and Frank Visciano 'O4. Burdened by the necessity to win four singles matches
to win, each Swat player elevated his game, which eventually deteriorated any chance Temple had of winning thematch.
At second singles, John Thomas 'O2 crushed Temple's Gaurav Kumar 6-3,6-2. "[Kumar] played very well,
but I knew that if I played as well as I am capable, I would win," said Thomas. Visciano excelled at fifth
singles, defeating an overwhelmedTemple opponent 6-2,60, in what was the most convincing win ofthe day.
Jayson Yost 'O3 won his match against Tharso Bossolani at the No. 4 singles spot. After splitting the first
two sets 64,4-6, Yost pulled away from his incensed Temple opponent. On Yost'sfirst match point at 5-1 in the
third set, the Temple head coach withdrew Bossolani, citing his unsportsmanlike play. After all ofthe hysteria, Yost won the match by defaultand pulled the Garnet into a tie with the flopping Owls.
The key match came at the No. 6 singles spot, where Scott Grant'Ol played an amazing match, winning 76, (74), 6-1 to clinch a Garnet victory in the first dual match of the season. Surprised by his own player's
ability, Coach Mullan asked jokingly, "When the hell didScott get so good?"
The early-season, come-from-behindvictory for the Garnet was a great indication ofthe team's outlookof
the rest ofthe season. The Garnet, now 1-0 on the season, welcomes Division I Farleigh-Dickinson on March
\
3. Matches begin at 1 p.m. in the Mullan Center.

This week Su "Please no running challenges" Wu took
on Scott "I had the highest batting average on the team
last season" Kushner in a bat-choking, bah-whiffing battle
on which hinged, well, everything. As Scott so articulately, but inaccurately put it: "Hey, I have nothing to
gain from this. Even if I win, I just beat some girl who
hasn't played baseball since she broke her tooth trying
to field some ball in little league when she was nine."

a series where
she tries to beat

"You're wrong, Scott," I said in reply. "The ball wasn't
just some ball. It was a wicked grounder with a lot of
topspin. And you have everything to gain from this, including pride and some sense of manliness."
"No, that's what he has to lose," the photographer in
the backseat squeaked out.

Saturday afternoon
I trek out to the Franklin Institute and head for their
new sports exhibit. They have a virtual home run derby
game, and I get in line for my chance to wave a foam bat
at a computer-generated pitcher and ball. Casey, the guy
I dragged along, goes before me and wiggles his butt
and fondles the bat handle. He hits three home runs.
His strategy seems to work. But I can't bring myself to
make lewd faces, noises and gestures in front of all the
little kids. So I just stick my butt out a little further
than usual when I'm standing at the plate, and Casey
cheers. I manage to hit four home runs on six pitches.
One of the virtual balls even breaks some virtual lights
high above the virtual bleachers. I'm getting cocky.
Sunday, 1:30 p.m.
I pick up Scott and Michael (everyone's favorite
sports photographer) and we head out to TLC Batting
Cages in Boothwyn. I'm worriedthat we're lost, but then
I see a Wal-Mart and am reassured that this is, indeed,
batting-cage country. "Hey, no matter what," Scott says
before we start, "you'll probably still have a better swing

than Ted Chan."

The place looks exactly like a batting cage should.

We change some bills and head over to the 65-mph cage. I'm
ready to just get in there and take my chances, but Scott knows his
shit, and he's willing to share. He babbles about these three steps:
something, something, coil. Legs slightly more than shoulder length
apart. Bat positioned so that if it accidentally dropped, it would
fall vertically on your back:foot. He gets in the cage to show me
how it's done, and he seems overly serious, and, can it be, even
nervous? No butt wiggle for the photographer's benefit, just business. And then he bunts the first one. Too much information for
my brain to process. What is this "bunting" business? But then he
just starts to put them away. It looks so easy. Pitch, swing, crack.
Now ifs my turn, and I'm allfalse swagger as I take the bat Scott has
selected for me and headinto the cage. I see the red light turn on and the
ball come toward me, and I close my eyes and swing. The ball hits the net
behind me. And again, and again. I walk out ofthe cage, utterly dismayed,
expecting Scott to gloat, but he seems almost fatherly. "You have a good
looking swing," he says. I groan. "No seriously. You almost hit it." Almost

the chances are that if a fight goes down, an athlete will be present or involved.
Of course, I hope that those who post on the Daily Jolt are not representative

permeate students from Mary Lyon to Woolman, why can't we just join forces

On Kile's shoulders, Garnet rip F&M

HE SWEET
SPOT

BY MATT RUBIN
In the Centennial Conference women's basketball semifinals here Wednesday night, Swarthmore defeated Franklin
& Marshall 67-55.
Swarthmore won on the strength of its star forward
Heather Kile 'O2 who, with her 29-point, 21-rebound performance, had the crowd chanting "M-V-P." In addition to the
strong team effort put forward by the Garnet women, Kile
received heavy support from center Sarah Tufano 'O3, who
contributed 16 points and seven rebounds.
Another powerful player in this game was the crowd. From
the minute Tufano won the tip-off, the packed gym was loud
and rowdy. After F&M's most impressive player, point guard

Trade for what?
The NFL and MLB are on vacation. The NBA is
dragging its feet through another all-too-long 82-game
season. And the XFL, with its all-star cast of Jeff
Brohm, Jesse Ventura and He Hate Me, is battling
for ratings against made-for-TV movies starring Tori
Spelling and that guy who played Doogie Howser. In
short, it's February, and professional sports are a
cesspool of all-star games, meaningless off-season
maneuverings, and lackluster midseason play. Bored?
Leave it to the usual band of wackos, misfits, and
money grubbers to inject a little pizzazz into the sporting world in the form of trade demands and rumors.

Amy Kreitz, scored four points in the first two minutes, the

crowd taunted her repeatedly, and she went scoreless for the
next 10 minutes.
The enthusiastic crowd also contributed to the highstrung, excited play on the floor. The game remained close

throughout the entire half, as the teams traded fouls in a
frenzy of activity and contact. Less than five minutes into
the game, the Diplomats had committed six fouls; the two
teams combined for 21 fouls in 20 minutes. At the end of the
half, Swarthmore led by five, 28-23.
The second half began equally close and with unabated
taunts from the Swarthmore crowd who, after the first half
statisticshad been distributed, had ample material to scream
about. However, the jeering was not equally effective, as F&M
reserve forward Jamie Drahos, who they teased for her 0for-6 first-half performance from the floor, erupted for 11 second-half points.
F&M rode Drahos and guard Amanda Rader, who both finished with 12 points, to cut the Swarthmore lead to within one

seven minutes into the half. But Swarthmore never lost
the lead and spent the next five minutes gradually pulling ahead.
The Diplomats' last hope came with 2:18 remaining, as
they cut the Swarthmore lead to four, but they were soon to
be furiously denied. Heather Kile, in characteristic fashion,
made a powerful move to the hoop that brought the crowd to
point

wasn't enough for the Swarthmore women's basketball
team to have clinched a Centennial Conference playoff berth
earlier; they were salivating over the opportunity to play host
It

during the tournament. Haverford College was the unfortunate prey of the Garnettes' killer appetite when the Fords fell
78-48 on Saturday. No, Haverford, Swat doesn't suck.
Well, maybe a little. They sucked a little on the previous
Wednesday at Muhlenberg when they let a game slip through
their fingers in the last two minutes of regulation, losing 5346. The Tide was anxiously looking to avenge a losing history
in the Mules' corral. No player on the Swarthmore squad has
ever tasted the nectar of victory on the Mules' home court.
Eager to prove that they were able to score more than last
year's eightpoints in the first half, the team came out strong.
Where did things go wrong? Perhaps the Swat women let
up in the second half, or perhaps the foul calls had something
to do with it. HeatherKile 'O2 did her fair share, chipping in
11 points, hauling down nine rebounds, and sneaking in for
two steals. Sarah Tufano 'O3 tried to lead the team to the promised land with 20 points, seven rebounds, and threebig blocks,
but the squad could not be takenby the hand.
A win versus Haverford College not only mended the
broken hearts after the Valentine's Day loss to Muhlenberg,
but it also secured home-court advantage for the playoffs.
Things started out lethargically as Swarthmore kept
Haverford within a few points in the first half. At halftime,
headcoach Adrienne Shibles unleashed her fury, complaining, "I am sick and tired of you women allowing teams to
play with you. It's out of my hands. The desire to thoroughly
defeat an opponent must come from within."
In the second half, it did. FreshmanKatie Robinson poured
in a career-high 22 points on 11-of-15 shooting, grabbed six
boards and picked up seven steals. Ali Furman 'O3 shot 50
percent both inside and outsidethe three-point arc and put in
12 points. Kile chipped in 15 points ofher own. Swat's big cats
may have toyed with their prey in the first half, but in the
second half they put the Fords away 46-24.
Two Garnet players earned postseason honors. Kile was
named to the first team All-Centennial Conference team for
the third straight year, and Tufano made the second team.

Despite losing season,
men's team retains hope
BY ANNA MASILELA
This season has been no cakewalk for the men's basketball team. Facing older and bigger opponents at every turn,
Swat has struggled, ending the season 3-10 in the Centennial
Conference and 4-20 overall.
Nevertheless, the team is optimistic for future season and
sees this as a transition year, with the significant contributions of the freshmen becoming part of a foundation on which
the team hopes to build to be a strong conference contender.
Sadly, Swatfound no love on the court on Valentine's Day.
The team was crushed on Feb. 14 by Muhlenberg, the East
Division's No. 2 seed in the upcoming Centennial Conference playoffs, 94-52. Jacob Letendre 'O4 dished out four assists, while David Pearce 'O3 was the only Swat player to score
in the double digits during the game to bring in the teamhigh 15 points. The Garnet was held down to shooting 25.3
percent from the field and couldn't stop the Mules after entering the secondhalf 27 points behind.
Letendre ended the season with 93 assists and 40 steals,
putting him in the top five on Swat's single-season lists in
the two categories. He is also fourth in the conference in
assists at 3.88 apg. Chris Loeffler 'O4 has been pulling down
team-high 5.5 rpg. Zack Ellison 'O4 closed the season having
made 42.9 percent of his three-pointers, putting him third in
the conference in this category.
That's not to say the returning players have been slacking. David Pearce 'O3 led the team in scoring with 15.5 ppg
and Kyle Lewis 'O2 has been named to this week's conference HonorRoll for his contributions during the Drew game
on Feb. 12 and the Haverford game on Feb 17.
In the last game of the season against Haverford, Swat
showed what it could do right. The team swept the Fords 5141, breaking a seven-game losing streak. The high scorers
that night were the juniors, with Lewis scoring the gamehigh 14points and David Gammill 'O2 contributing 13 points,
a steal and a block. Letendre brought in 11points and dished
out two assists. Swat forced 14 turnovers during the game
and the Fords exited the first half trailing by four points.
Swat boosted the pressure up a notch in the second halfand
walked away with the victory.

LEAVE IT TO THE USUAL BAND OF
WACKOS, MISFITS, AND
MONEYGRUBBERS TO INJECT A
LITTLE PIZZAZZ INTO THE SPORTING
WORLD IN THE FORM OF TRADE
DEMANDS AND RUMORS.
First, we have the rumors and intrigue surrounding Dikembe Mutombo.Dikembe Mutombo? Indeed, a
few morons around the league, namely GMs of the
Knicks and the Sixers, still crave the 34-year-old
Mutombo, the 9-ppg offensive juggernaut and paradigm
of finesse, speed, and agility. Only the likes of Shawn
"Puffy" Kemp and Vin Bake-er can match Mutombo's
quickness, er, slowness, on the court. The acquisition
of Mutombo thus should spoil the Eastern Conference
Championship hopes ofeithertheKnicks or the Sixers.
Secretly, each team's fans hope the other team solidifies a Mutombo tradebefore the NBA trading deadline.
Sadly, Mutombo is the mostprized prospect among
this year's NBA trade bait class, which includes such

household names as Clifford Robinson, Derrick
Coleman, and Mookie Blaylock. These players are
known more for theiroff-the-court problems than for
their great play: each player boasts at least one DUI
arrest among others and convictions, the most interesting of which is a 1999 allegation that Coleman urinated in the dining room of a Detroit restaurant during peak business hours. Still, many GMs are tossing around Coleman's name in trade talks, whereas
others insist that Coleman be housebroken before
they will consider trading for him.
To the credit of Major League Baseball, its preseason trade talks have completely overshadowed the
NBA's midseason trade talks. Most of the drama has
been a result of Gary Sheffield and Barry Bonds' trade
demands.Sheffield wants either a big money contract
extension with the Dodgers or a trade to one of the
league's elite teams, and Bonds wants a similar deal.
As both players would argue, they simply want the
"fair market value" for their skills. What is "fair"
about the ridiculous salaries that these players demand? Perhaps it is the "fairness" inherent to a league
in which a few elite franchises to dominate smallmarket clubs. Also, what great "value" do these individual players have? In a league in which pitching
and balanced hitting win championships, one great
position player alone possesses little value. What
makes Sheffield's and Bonds' demands even more
amusing is that both players claim to want to play
for a title contender. Sure. Just like Alex Rodriguez
fulfilled his dream to play for a contender when he
left the Mariners, a team that had advanced to the
ALCS, for the Rangers, one of the worst teams in the
AL in 2000.
Fortunately, we have these ridiculous trade rumors and demands to distract us until March and
April, when both professional and college basketball
get into high gear. Without the trade talks to focus
on, we could be come disinterested with, or even cynical of the sports world.

OUT OF
LEFT FIELD

CHAMPIONS!

"Caaaan you feeel the
loooove toniiiiight?"
OK, so I've finally crawled out from the cave I was
living in for the last eight months and began visiting
the Daily Jolt last week. And I must say I am terribly
disheartened by many of the recent posts on the
Swarthmore Forum. So far, I have read pieces that declare athletes to be cheaters, fraternity brothers to be
hired thugs, and all Swatties to be narrow-minded ignoramuses. While I don't necessarily agree with any of
these claims, I am seriously disturbedthat such beliefs
exist within the Swarthmore community. Perhaps even
more upsetting than the fact that these beliefs exist is
with whom these beliefs reside. Since most of the posts
on the Daily Jolt are completely anonymous, there is
no way of knowing how many students are contributing to these messages of anger. It just goes to show how
insecure and spineless many of us are.
Every week, Phoenix columnists like Lane Oatey,
David Ellis, Jackie Aponte and myself stick our necks
out for the sake of airing some controversial issues.
Some people love us, some hate us. But no matter what
your stance is on said subject, respect the fact that we
are passionate enough to voice our opinions publicly
and stand behind what we say.
I want you to disagree with what I have to say, because it means you're thinking about the issues. I want
you to approach me in Sharpies and question my rationale, because it means you're mature enough to engage
in a face-to-face discussion. Unfortunately, it seems like
Swatties would rather play verbal ping-pong while hiding behind untraceable aliases than work out issues like

competent adults. We feel that though our identities are
too valuable to be revealed, our inflammatory attacks
belong on a public forum. We're so afraid of the prospect of receiving criticism yet so quick to dish it out.
With sharp wit and a forked tongue, we spit in the eyes
of our classmates so that they can feel the pain of our
words but are blind to the identities of our enemies.
That's not clever, that's cowardice.
Following last weekends' scuffles at Haverford and
in the Wharton courtyard, a plethora of messages
pointed the finger at athletes as the four horsemen of
Swarthmore's Apocalypse. A glance at the subject matter from the last week of posts shows that there is an
awful lot ofhatred floating around the Swarthmore campus. According to the forum, men hate women,
Swarthmore hates Haverford, non-athletes hate athletes,
DU members hate Phi Psi members, DU members hate
DU members, non-frat students hate frat brothers, exfootball players hate Mark Dingfield and everybody
hates Bob Williams (how many times will that phrase
appear in the Phoenix before somebody finally fires his
ass?).
One of the many reasons reported for athletes being
the bane of Swarthmore's existence is that athletes are
more prone to fights than non-athletes. Let's get a few
things clear. Not all athletes fight. Not all fights involve
athletes. However, if we want to make gross generalizations, I'll embrace it... so follow along:
Something like 60 to 75 percent of the student body
here participates in varsity, club or intramural athletics. Now, consider that most physical fights occur between males, so I'm only going to deal with them (although nothing beats a good cat-fight). There are slightly
more male athletes than female athletes here and there
are fewer male students than female, which means that
approximately 70 to 85 percent of the male studentshere
are athletes of some sort (please excuse me for not having exact figures, but after all, we're just making gross
generalizations, right?).
Finally, and most importantly, very few male nonathletes attend events (i.e. parties, sporting events) that

After having begun training the first week of October, traveling to Aruba for an extensive training trip, and competing in
11 meets, the Garnet Tide would conclude its season at F&M.
The team was outfitted in the revolutionary new Speedo Fast
Skin full-body suits. These suits are meant to emulate the skin
of a shark and dramatically enhance performance. (These
high-tech suits were first seen in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.)
The men were expected to battle for second with F&M.
Despite the small Garnet squad of nine swimmers (F&M had
