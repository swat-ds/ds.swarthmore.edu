It's not easy being both a student and an
athlete at Swarthmore.The demands of
coaches and professors are occasionally
conflicting, and wins are often few and
far between. Despite the difficulties,
many student-athletes manage to
succeed in both fields. Charlie Ellis 'OO

The

newest

designs for the DuPont science

center,

viewed from the front near Martin (top left), from the rear (bottom left) and the air.

Price tag for science center may rise by $10M
By Brendan Karch
Phoenix Staff
As a result of more detailed design
plans, the two most important digits—in the eight-digit estithe first two
mated price tag for the new science
center are remarkably higher than first
expected. The $4O million construction
component of the $6O million project is
now estimated at around $44 or $45 million, and the total cost, according to Vice
President of Facilities Larry Schall, is
"likely to be up to $7O million."
Schall explained that price re-evaluations are an integral part of the planning process. "[The college] gets estimates done at four or five points in the
project," Schall explained. "As you get
more detail, the estimates are more accurate." Schall added that minor cuts
had to be made to keep the price tag
from surpassing the $45 million mark.
The overall look and feel of thebuilding is slowly coming into focus. The five
preliminary designs presented last September were narrowed down to two by
November and then to one by the end
of last semester. The basic design (Design X) preserves the basic aesthetic
—

qualities of all three science buildings
DuPont, Cornell and Martin but still
connects them together.
In contrast to other preliminary proposals, the chosen design avoids drastic expansion in one place (causing a
possible eyesore) and opts for the addition of multiple small structures, essentially filling out the space around
DuPont without destroying its existing
floor plan. The largest new construction includes a multi-story addition on
the east side of DuPont (facing the
rugby field) and a commons area that
will connect the front side closest to
Cornell with the library.
The commons area is the most distinctive change to the building's social
space. According to the Science Building Project Web site, the commons area
will serve as both the literal and the
social center of the new science center.
It will be the convergence point for traffic between classrooms, most of which
are clustered near the commons, and it
will likely include a vending area (similar to the Kohlberg Coffee Bar), and
places for group meetings, individual
work, and Crum-watching from the proposed outdoor terrace.
-

-

The majority of classrooms, including
a 200-seat and an 80-seat lecture hall, will
be on the first floor and toward the front
of the building. A two-story building containing computer classrooms and a biology lab will be plopped in front of Cornell,
making the science library accessible
only from an interior hall. Other smaller
classrooms will be scattered in the back
of the building and in the basement and
upper levels, and lab and faculty/research will space stay largely in therear
and east sides of the building.
A telescope dome is expected to be
added to the third floor of DuPont and
will be placed over the existing math
wing. It will, in its current placement, be
visible from the front of the building.
The overall project actually entails a
relatively small amount of new construction. Most of the existing structure of
DuPont, which Schall said is still in good
condition, will stay untouched. However,
the mechanical structural equipment will
be almost completely gutted. According
to Schall, over 40 percent of the project
cost is actually in new mechanical and
electrical systems.

2002, would appease the faculty
members who have been requesting an additional week of
vacation by allowing graduation
to occur one week earlier.
The proposal would principally
affect honors students by shortening their total examination period from three weeks to two.
The proposal would eliminate the
two comprehensive exam days
that function as a de facto extension of the honors reading period,
shorten the official reading period from five to four days and
shorten the written examination
period from nine to seven days.
Course students, meanwhile,
would find their examination pe-

riod shortened fromnine to eight
days. Both honors and course students would still have time to
participate in "senior week" activities. "This preserves a week
between the end of orals and
commencement, but it cuts a variety of things during finals,"
Curriculum Committee student
representative Ira Lindsay 'Ol
explained.
The committee initially tried to
gauge student opinion with a fireside chat in February, but the
event exactly didn't produce the
cross-spectrum of students that
its members hadbeen hoping for.
Only one student showed up.
Yet the committee is making

one last desperate attempt to
raise awareness about the proposal, which has since been
slightly toned down, before i

Jordan Wales 'Ol and Matt Landreman
'O2 are two of this year's 309 winners of
Goldwater Scholarships, which are
awarded to outstanding sophomores and
juniors in math, engineering or natural
sciences.
Wales and Landreman, two of four students recommended by the college to the
national selection committee, were up
against competition from a total of 1,176
applicants nominated by their colleges
and universities for the scholarships,
named for former Sen. Barry M.
Goldwater.
The selection process emphasizes science research, which both winners have
been participating in.

with a minor in physiological psychology,
is hoping to eventually obtain a degree and

grows."

Landreman, an Honors physics major,
is not enrolled this semester and instead
is doing research work full time withphysics professor Michael Brown.
"I did e-mail the Goldwater organization
to see if I was eligible," Landreman said,
"because I wasn't really a sophomore."
But the fact that he was taking time off

to do research "probably wasn't too bad"
for his application, Landreman said.
Brown's work is on studying magnetic
fields in plasma, which is useful for explaining phenomena like solar flares.
"It's a lot like meteorology," said
Landreman, "because in high school physics, you learn about pressure, which is
basically how water works. A chemist can
rattle off lots of interesting properties of
water. But from none of that information
would you ever guess that there are hurricanes each week in the Atlantic."
Similarly, he said, plasma is described
by fluid equations and Maxwell's equations, which describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism. But like
with meteorology, there is still complexity not immediately apparent.
"You'd never guess from looking at
those equations that there are solar flares
on the sun," Landreman noted. And some
of those missing pieces of understanding

are why, with help from Landreman and
others, Brown is simulating solar flares
in the basement of DuPont.
Landreman, who is studying philosophy
independently this semester, and Wales,
who is concerned about the implications
of eventually creating nearly sentient
machines, are both interested not only in
science itself but in the ethics of science.
"Assuming a super-intelligent... seemingly sentient computer were created,
what would it be?" asked Wales. "A new
life form? Would it be as 'alive' as we are?
Would it have rights? Could we just 'flip
the switch' whenever we wanted to? If we,
as human beings, have a soul, then would
a sentient computer have a spiritual element as well? How can we discriminate
between a living conscious being and a
really good computer program? What
does it mean about the nature of our existence?
"Don't you love it?"

College seeks protection from liability over Internet copyrights
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
The college is working to insulate itself from liability for copyright violations committed over
its Internet connection, according to chemistry professor and
associate
provost
Tom
Stephenson, who is leading the
effort.
The provisions of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act of
1998, said Stephenson, allow any
Internet service provider, such
as the college, to create a legal
"safe harbor" from lawsuits by
copyright owners.
"Prior to 1998, if you're a company and you're providing
Internet access to individual
people and those people are doing bad things," said Stephenson,
"not only are thosepeople liable,
but you can be liable."
The issue of copyright violations occurring over the Internet
has gained prominence in recent
months as the music industry has
begun cracking down on illegal
music distribution through MP3
computer files, much of which

occurs on college campuses
where network bandwidth is
widely available.
Although Stephenson said it
would be unlikely for a copyright
holder to make the effort of actually filing a suit against the college, he said powerful copyright
owners such as themusic industry could choose to make an
example of one academic institution in an effort to stop copyright violations at others. The
new law wouldprovide more protection against such lawsuits.
Under the act, the college is
required to designate an official
contact person with the U.S.
Copyright Office, allowing copyright holders to contact the college to report violations.The college must then ask the student,
faculty or staff member responsible to stop distributing the
copyrighted material; if that person refuses the college could disconnect his or her Internet service. When a copyright holder
contacts the college under the
provisions of the act, the college
also has the option of declaring
that the material falls under the
-

-

category of "fair use," in which
case a copyright violation has not
in fact occurred; if the copyright
holder chose to contest that judgment the college could still be
legally liable.
Stephenson and the copyright
committee, composed of faculty
and staff, will present the issues
to the faculty in May. He said the
policies would probably be in
place by the end of the year.
But despite the policies,
Stephenson said electronic copyright violations were still serious
especially for the network user
who was responsible.
"It is not insignificant legal liability for the individual," he
said.
-

In addition, according to
Stephenson, even the new law
allows copyright holders to go
after a user of the network without giving the college any notice
which would allow the user time
to stop.
In order to maintain its legal
immunity, the new law requires
the college to stop copyright violations it discovers. Stephenson
said he hopes the college will not

be expected to monitor the network for signs of potential violations like large amounts of data
in large file sizes coming to and
from a single computer, which is
typical of MP3-sharing programs
such as Napster.
-

"My hope is that network traffic alone is not grounds for suspecting copyright infringement,"
said Stephenson. "I really don't
want us to get into the business
of monitoring our Internet traffic at that level."

out of their current homes.

Unfortunately, any Swattie
that wants to see the science center plans come to fruition will
have to forgo graduation more
than once. Ground will be broken
in the summer of 2001. The design process, and the seemingly
endless amount of reviews that
go along with it, are slated to end
in October. The drafting of construction documents and the bidding for the project will then eat

construction begins. New construction will precede the renovationof the old building because

mittee met l\iesday to view a
sixth round of updates to the
building plans. The meeting was
part of a regular review process
that is occurring every three
weeks. As more and more comprehensive plans are being released, the architects and the
committee are beginning to consider smaller details such as exterior materials and the shadows
cast at different times of day and
year. In addition to the main committee meeting, a special "Green
Team" is "looking at the environmental impacts of the building,"
according to Schall.

Prefrosh weekend arrives

with over 200 prospective students, a series of concerts, parties, and performances and a

I

dunk tank.
But prospective student weekend is more than a brief burst of
life for an often tired campus.
For the past few years, the Admissions Office has had to tread
delicately around what is now a
source of campus-wide contro-

versy.
The controversy comes from
the traditional division of the
weekend into two separate but
semi-integrated programs, one of
which is only open to students of
color. Some students and administrators are concerned that the
current structure of the weekend
fosters division, whileothers feel
that the division is necessary to
properly address the unique experiences that students of color

face.

Last fall, the Admissions Office considered effectively combining the two weekends; while
some separate activities would
have been available for students
of color, all students would have
arrived and left on the same
dates.
"We wanted to overlap the
weekends totally with separate
events. The [program for students of color] was never in jeopardy of being canceled," Associate Dean of Admissions Tracy
Matthews 'B9 explained.

The proposal elicited a heated
response from students who felt

that the weekend for students of
color should be a crucial facet of
student recruitment, and saw the
proposed change as a move toward completely phasing out the
weekend for students of color.
"Sometimes [the weekends] have
been completely separate, and
they've been moving closer and
closer. The concern was that [students] didn't want it to completely disappear or be joined[to
the other prospective student
weekend]," Director of Admissions JimBock '9O said.
In the end, Admissions decided
to maintain the schedule of the
1999 weekend for this year.
About 80 students of color will
arrive Friday or early Saturday
to take part in activities sponsored by the Intercultural Center groups and by the Admissions Office. An estimated 150
other students (mostly white)
will then arrive Saturday afternoon to take part in the activities
that will be open to all. Both programs will conclude on Monday.
"Students have the choice and
the option of attending both or
either or neither," Bock said.
After Admissions decided last
fall to again offer separate weekends, the controversy died down.
Some concerned students felt
that duplicating last year's weekend was a good temporary solution with the expectation that
the issue would be definitively
decided in the future.
"I'm glad that Admissions isn't
rushing to any conclusions on the
issue," Min Lee 'OO said. "I think
it's important that everyone gets
a say on the issue minorities and
non-minorities I'm glad we're
taking the time to hold dialogue."

At 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, only a handful of students were eating in Sharpies under the new open door policy.

Sharples door open but underused
hall yesterday at 2:30 p.m. Students who arrive between 1:30
and 4:30 p.m. can choose from
among deli and salad bar items,
Pino's Pasta, pre-made grill
items, and desserts.
McDougall said, however, that
she is pleased with the new
policy, and that despite minor
glitches, it is here to stay. A similar plan tried nine or 10 years ago
was discontinued because of lack
of student interest, but
McDougall pointed out that, at
the time, Sharpies was run by a
contract company that was more
interested in profit than in serving students. The dining hall is
now self-operated.
The most serious concern facing Dining Services, in fact, is not
the program's underuse but the
complaints it has brought from
students about the earlier breakfast cutoff time in Essie Mae's.

By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
The doors of Sharpies have
been open continually during
daytime hours for over ten days
now, but not many students have
been entering them at non-standard mealtimes. In some cases,
the dining hall's new "open door
policy," which permits students
to use their meal credit to eat
light meals during hours when
Sharpies was previously closed,
has elicited more complaints
than goodwill.
Director of Dining Services
Linda McDougall estimated that
about 35 students a day take advantage of the new policy.
"I think the problem is that
there aren't a lot of other choices

Breakfast credit now ends at
10:30rather than 11 a.m, and according to Essie Mae's director
Marie Dalton, some late risers
are disgruntled to find that they
are charged for lunch upon waking up.
Dining Services is not extremely concerned about these
complaints, however. "If you
can't eat breakfast by 10:30, you
need to get up a little earlier,"
McDougall said. According to
Dalton, the complaints mostly
stopped after the first few days.
To be sure, some students interviewed were positive about
the new policy. "You can get more
food [at Sharpies], and the only
choice isn't fingers and fries,"
said Jessica Lee 'O3.
And for some, the policy's
underuse is attractive. "I like that
there's not a lot of people here,"
Daniele Holt-Lyman 'O3 said.

faculty. They think that things
drag on too long and.. .thateveryone could get out of here sooner,"
Lindsay explained. According to
Mike Spiegel 'O3, the other student representative to the Cur-

riculum Committee, Swarthmore

students now graduate a week or

two after most other schools.

Yet the committee also recognizes that most other schools do
not offer such a rigorous and examination-intensive honors program. "The committee was [initially] worried that this [pro-

posal] would hurt the honors program," Spiegel said.
On the other hand, Spiegel
pointed out that the examination
burden falling on honors students
is lighter than it used to be. Several years ago the required number of honors preparations was
reduced from eight to four, but the
length of the examination period
has remained the same.
The question that remains is
whether students, to the degree
that they have control over the
matter, will allow that to happen.
Thefinal decision on the proposal
will be made by the faculty, but

both Spiegel and Lindsay would
like to see students become more
involved in the decision-making
process.
"It's not really a protest issue,"
Spiegel said. "It's something that
students need to be aware of and
then talk to the faculty [about]."
An additional change proposed
by the committee is to synchronize Swarthmore's opening dates
and October break with
Haverford and Bryn Mawr. Lindsay predicts that students will
principally be concerned about
shortening the exam period,
though.

Debate nationals to be
held here this weekend
From DEBATE, pg. 3

quarterfinals to the semifinals
and final rounds of debate. Teams
will take turns choosing subjects
for debate, which may range
from matters of philosophy to
foreign policy to pop culture,
though they are limited to topics
that would be familiar to a wellread college student.
This year's theme for Nationals, "Suburban Legends," will be
incorporated into the names of
the teams as well as into certain
aspects of the debating itself.
Swarthmore's representation
in the Nationals' debates will consist of the single team of Rob
Peterson 'O3 and Dan Bennett'Ol.
Although Swarthmore could
have entered as many as three
teams in the competition, they
needed the additional Peaslee
Debate Society members to set
up and clean up, serve meals,
judge debates and host teams
that could not afford to stay at the
Airport Marriot, where the majority of tournament participants
will be housed.
In addition to an intensive debate schedule, the weekend will
feature several social events for
the debaters, including a party
Friday evening at John
Harvard's in Wayne, Pa., and a
banquet and party Saturday
night at the Garden State Race
Tracks in Cherry Hill, N.J. The
APDA will also hold a meeting to
make decisions regarding several constitutionalissues, and the
Princeton Review, corporate
sponsor for the event, will give a
talk about its services on Saturday.
Nationals marks thefruition of
a year's work for the Peaslee
Debate Society and particularly
for tournament directors John
Dolan 'Ol, Mimi Hanoaka 'Ol,
Darius Ornston 'OO and Tenaya
Scheinman 'Ol. Last spring, the
group began its preparations for
the bid to host Nationals by researching potential ways to
handle the logistical aspects of
the event. After submitting a detailed proposal to the APDA early
last fall, Swarthmore won the bid
to host Nationals in mid-September in a referendum that gave
each APDA member school one
vote. Swarthmore,

which last

hostedNationals in 1996, soundly
defeated Mt. Holyoke, its sole
competitor for the bid.
"[This victory] reflects
Swarthmore's increased stature
within the debate circuit," said
Ornston, who is also president of
the Peaslee Debate Society.
"Other schools are willing to
trust us [with hosting Nationals]."
The successful bid will also
result in substantial prestige and
publicity for Swarthmore, according to Scheinman and
Hanoaka.
Since September, the tournament directors have devoted numerous hours to preparations for
Nationals, including fundraising,
planning events, and working
with the college administration.
"It's been pretty crazy,"
Scheinman said. "I haven't done

Swarthmore’s
I
representation in the I
debates will consist I
of the single team I
of Rob Peterson ’O3 I
and Dan Bennett’ol. I
much homework since spring

break.”

Although Nationals will take
place during the college’s weekend for prospective students, the
tournament directors said this
scheduling fluke has not caused
any major problems. Ornston,
who called a certain amount of
conflict “inevitable” given the
magnitude of both events, saidhe
was nevertheless “impressed by
the degree to which the administration was accommodating.”
Swarthmore debaters helping
out at Nationals include Elcin
Akcura ’O3, Marvin Barron ’O2,
Sydney Beveridge ’O3, David
Bing ’O3, Marina Boevska ’O3,
Xiao Chang ’O3, Dolan, Sarah
Drescher ’O3, Zoila Forgione ’O3,
Hanoaka, Gabe Hankins ’O3, Phil
Hoefs ’O2, Colin Moore ’O2,
Ornston, Scheinman, Jeremy'
Schifeling ’O3, Mike Tsan ’OO and
Andy Wong ’O2. Several
Swarthmore alumni will also
serve as judges and work to ensure that the weekend proceeds
smoothly.
Nationals will cap an intensive
debate season for Swarthmore’s
Peaslee Debate Society. The season begins in September and extends until Nationals, with a short
break from mid-December to
mid-January. The Peaslee Debate
Society holds meetings twice
weekly and regularly attends
APDA tournaments.
While highly successful, the
Peaslee Debate Society is also
“laidback,” according to
Scheinman. Individual team
members determine to what extent they wish to participate in
the group’s activities.
“We want people to enjoy debating,” Scheinman said. “They
can go to as many meets as they
want and practice as much as
they want.”
As for the upcoming competitionat Nationals, Scheinman predicted that Swarthmore’s team
will perform “not horribly, but
not fantastically.” Peterson and
Bennett are both good debaters
individually but have had little
experience debating together,
Scheinman said. She predicted
that top contenders for the championship title will include teams
from Princeton, Columbia,
Brandeis, Amherst and Stanford.
But whatever the outcome for
Swarthmore, Ornston is optimistic that Nationals will run
smoothly.
“I’d be surprised if it turned
out badly,” Ornston said. “I think
we’re in really good shape.”
The Swarthmore public is welcome to watch the quarterfinal,
semifinaland final rounds of debate. The finals will take place on
the Lang Performing Arts Center main stage at 2 p.m. Sunday

Unreserved-editorial
The numbers speak for themselves. There were 79
all-student e-mails sent during February. Another 79
were sent in March, which is a substantial increase
considering the college was on spring break one of
those weeks. And the 50 reserved-students sent so far
in April put us on track to have to skim a total of 125 emails by the end of this month.
Although between The Phoenix's deadlineand the
time you read this the number will have undoubtedly
increased by several, there have been 664 reservedstudents e-mails so far this year. Those e-mails add up
to about 1.4 megabytes of characters. Printed out, the
total number of characters in all of the reservedstudents e-mails so far this year would fill one
semester's worth of The Phoenix.
Printing all of them out would, of course, be absurd.
But what faculty and staff need to remember is that just
because e-communication is easier to send, students still
have to read or at least take the time to trash that
amount of e-mail. Is it worth sending an e-mail to
everyone to ask if, as was done yesterday, someone left
cash by the MAC machine? What about to announce a
lecture not of interest to a general audience?
The Computing Center has a set of guidelines for
this. According to Swarthmore's "Electronic Communication Policies" page, "Examples of electronic mail
messages that should not be sent to all-campus groups
are: Lost and found or other 'classified' type listings,"
as well as "queries of a personal or limited general
interest." The Computing Center also lists this rule of
thumb: "If you would not have sent a paper version of
the message to the whole campus
do not send it
electronically."
Unfortunately, all too often people do, which means
that all too often students skim or deletereservedstudents messages indiscriminately, with the possibility
that they might miss important academic information.
We request the following:
That those who send multiple reserved-students emails in the same day (as has happened on six occasions so far this month) plan better and consolidate
them into one message.
That those who send multiple copies of the same
reserved-students message in the mistaken belief that
the server is malfunctioning simply stop.
That the college crack down on use of the reservedstudents alias for announcing lectures or other events;
instead, there should be a compilation of all upcoming
events sent weekly to reserved-students
or not at
all, since that's what the Weekly News is for.
The reserved-students system has a function. But
when students' mailboxes are clogged with e-mails
most people find irrelevant, it is evident the system is
not being used for its intendedpurpose. If faculty and
staff expect students to read and absorb e-mails sent to
the student body, some of them need to think more
carefully about what they send.

Art gallery a success
The cozy main floor of the newly renovated Sharpies
111 played host to a score of students and parents who
flocked Saturday afternoon to the inaugural art
exhibition in the new student gallery. The show, called
"A Student Space, A Student Show" featured the
creative talent of 20 Swarthmore students in several
mediums: painting, photography, sculpture (including
a mobile) and even a sketchbook.
The most awesome force at work at this successful
event wasn't the art (which was all very, very good),
but rather the atmosphere generated both by the
beautiful interior and by the buzz of so many inquisitive and conversant Swatties. It was, for a short time, a
nearly enchanting experience for a school so desperately in need of student space. Based on the success of
this first exhibition, we fully expect the art gallery in
Sharpies 111 to be a quality use of space.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Sager party should challenge gender
To the Editor,
I'm a junior, but I have to say, I'm still pretty baffled
by the Swarthmore phenomenon known as
"Genderfuck" (or "the Sager party" for the non-profane). So men wear skimpy dresses and women... wear
skimpy dresses? Men get to step out of traditional gender roles and women
get to step deeper into them?
Everyone (almost everyone, anyway) dresses in clothes
that fit the "slut" stereotype in some way or another?
What's with that? I just don't quite understand why
the gender-bending doesn't go both ways, and why it's
so limited in scope. For instance, why don't we see
other female stereotypes being played out? Nurses,
housewives, ballet dancers, maids? Or non-heterosexual gender stereotypes, like the lesbian "butch?"
I've discussed these questions with a lot of people
and have been especially confused by the fact that
almost no women go in drag. Here are some reasons
why this might be:
Women always get to wear men's clothes.
This is sort of true but not so convincing. For the most
part, when women wear men's clothes, they are women
wearing men's clothes. They are not pretending to be
men. No, if women really wanted to cross-dress for
Genderfuck, it's easy enough. Bind those breasts and
pull your hair back. Scribble on some facial hairwith an
eyeliner pencil and pick up some men's clothes. (Heck,
the guys get to stuff their chests for the party
why
shouldn't we stuff our pants?) There are a lot of really
interesting masculine stereotypes to be.
Swarthmore women are afraid of looking stupid.
First of all, this doesn't seem fair! The guys are taking a risk, why shouldn't the women? How would you
like to be a guy in a wig and a feather boa (and not
much else) trying to pick up a woman wearing prob...

•

ably the sexiest outfit she owns? And how would you like
to be a queer male at a party that seems almost totally
devoted to the idea of feminine sex appeal?
Secondly, if women are afraid of looking unattractive
in men's clothes
well, I've seen women dressing as
men before, and some of them look so sexy, they take
your breath away. (In defense of the guys, a lot of them
look really sexy in women's clothing too. There's something about taking a risk and playing with notions of gender that's just really appealing.)
It's fun to be nekkid.
This I will concede. It's fun to wear skimpy, practically nonexistent clothes in the presence of lots of other
folks wearing skimpy, practically nonexistent clothes.
And if you can cross-dress and accomplish this, more
power to you. But should nekkidness be the first priority? I'm not so sure.
If a party is called "Genderfuck" (and connected with
the Sager symposium), it seems that it should mess with
traditional notions of gender. The entire theme of Sager
this year was "Trans/forming Gender." To have a party
that doesn't reflect that just seems disrespectful. If
people want to have a party where everyone just gets
uninhibited and wears barely-there clothes, I would suggest a separate event. (At the University of Minnesota,
there are "pimp and ho" parties every semester for exactly this purpose.)
So what am I saying? I guess I'm just confused by how hj
Genderfuck doesn't live up to its name. Ideally, it would
be a party where men and women could explore all the
different aspects of masculine and feminine stereotypes,
straight and queer. It's just one night you'd really think
Swarthmore students could fuck with gender for a few
hours once a year.

Phoenixes are amazing creatures. And The Phoenix has certainly amazed me! I'm abroad in London
right now, and in my endless hours of wasting time
surfing the Internet in the library, I've discovered The
Phoenix's new Web site. It is awesome! The design is
impeccable and makes me want to come back for each
week's new edition. I also can't wait to see the print
version, which looks much sleeker from what I have
seen of the covers. Great work, Phoenix dudes!

Meditations on the small room
Why are all the Ben Chans sitting together in the cafeteria?
By Ben Chan
Phoenix Staff
I have had a difficult time finding my
social bearings at Swarthmore, as my
compass has been exposed to wildly disorienting forces. Reading opinions in The
Phoenix usually makes things worse. The
huffy forces of dogma, which youth do not
attenuate, bombard me from left and
right. Fleeing from these flighty liberals
and indignant conservatives leads me
away from the periphery and toward the
center. Unfortunately, the center is a miserable place, where one will often overhear villagers complaining about food services, student housing and all the other
infinitesimalhurdles in their lives. So with
the center barely habitable, where am I
to retreat? In Sharpies at least, I have the
small room.
I have embraced complete self-segregation and made it my own. Eating at
Sharpies no longer requires me to season
my food with sprinkles of quasi-witty
small talk now I eat withmy loving soul
mate, the audience of one, the undemanding and understanding self. Spending time
with one's self can be a remarkably lowmaintenance affair. Gone are all the pressures of having to explain myself to others. Do you know what a luxury it is to
spend my precious leisure time with only
that person who shares my taste in food,
books and music? Never once has my self
asked me what growing up in Flushing is
like, where my family is from or how
much Cantonese I understand. Nor has he
ever been perplexed by my decision to
study philosophy or my affinity for "Iron
Chef." Of course, my self has wondered
about me at times, but he has never alienated me. I am my very own support group,
fraternity, club and mentor.
I've discovered that searching far and
wide for that compassionate soul who will
empathize with your anxieties and relate
to your aspirations is rather hopeless
worse yet, it's a colossal waste of energy
when that perfect match is right under
(and permanently attached to) your nose.
Gone, then, are the nights of solitary stargazing, wondering if your future companion is lying in some grassy field staring at
the same constellation. A new economy
will enter your life with this realization.
Meeting your faithful companion for

breakfast, lunch, brunch or dinner is fool-

proof, with no scheduling required. Complexity dissolves into simplicity.
There are those who will argue, like
Donne, that "no man is an island." Others might cite Hume's avowal: "I dine, I
play a game, I converse, and am merry
with my friends," which cures the melancholy of philosophical solitude. But
there is no disagreement with me here,
for I, too, can enjoy the refreshing company of a jocular friend or the cathartic
sweat of a basketball game. Light social
interaction is of course necessary to
maintain one's sanity. But I've learned
that going beyond light interaction is
imprudent, even dangerous. Why risk
sharing anything of importance? At best,
someone will kind of get it; at worse, they
will mock you and your entire way of life.
Even worse, they might get it and then
betray you. Thus the aphorisms of Hume

and Donne are effectively countered by
Swift, who notes, "One enemy can do
more hurt than ten friends can do good."
Better, then, to keep one's distance from
all eleven of them.
How might you implement my incomparable method of living? It turns out that
there's really only one rule you need to
follow: only associate with those people
with whom you are the most comfortable.
For me, it's a circle of one; for you, it may
be more. Should the Fates force you to
spend time with people outside of this
circle, it is advisable to keep interactions
within a safe, featureless plane, steering
clear of any deeply held opinions that
might cause the earth to rumble and fissure awkwardly. Gossip, shared hobbies
and alcohol are some effective ways of
leveling the plane. With a little faith and
imagination, one will see that my wonderful way of life is well within our reach.

Report of homophobia unfair to frats

*

i

To the Editor:
In reference to an article entitled "Homophobia reported at Sager Dance,"
(News, April 6, pg. 4) I felt there were
many inappropriate comments and discrepancies, which I found quite disturbing.
No. 1: It was reported in this "news"
article that Julie Russo 'Ol was quoted
as saying: "There were some drunken
frat boys there, and at least one of them
was making homophobic comments."
The Phoenix then went on to state that
"the identity of the offenders and their
affiliation with any particular fraternity
are still unknown." Okay, maybe there
were some drunk guys there making inappropriate comments, but how can Ms.
Russo claim that they were "frat boys"
if their identity was unknown, as The
Phoenix claims? Did they have the symbol for DU tattooed on their head? Did
they have the symbol for Phi Psi on their
t-shirts? I think that if Ms. Russo wants

In one of the innumerable permutations
on the Amy Heckerling theme of life-as
high school that have been spawned in the
post-"Fast Times" era, a character, whose
name, as well as visage, is unimportant,
claims, "E-mail is for geeks and
pedophiles." And while I endeavor not tc
fit too firmly into both those categories at
the same time, I nevertheless sympathize
with derogatory sentiments while at the
same time being an avid user of the disparaged subject. Trying not to cast my lot
among that broodof vipers and the forkedtongued, perhaps a more precise placement of electronic etiquette would be efficacious, if in only a penitential respect.
For it exists in an odd nether region. E
mail is certainly not akin to real mail ol
the paper variety. When writing a letter
there are formulae involved: a salutation
a body, a closing. The trials, which are legion, involved in composing a letter are
wholly foreign to the curt, often near-illiterate jumble of half-composed ideas and
common words misspelled that find shelter in that haven of comma-free thought.
Response time as well seems to be ar
undiscovered country It's not a phone call,
but neither is it junk mail, with the possible
exception of reserved-students e-mails
which, much to my chagrin, even though
they constitute at least a plurality of my
received mail, are launched upon the embarkation of any project in which more
than three students are engaged. Unless
obviously urgent, I would think three days
is sufficient. Not only is it not an unreasonably long amount of time, but, by that
time, most people would forget about having sent the e-mail in the first place, thus
making the reply a welcome surprise.
What we also need is a standard of appropriate material. Part of the larger objection to the reserved-students e-mails is
that e-mail seems more private than a
mass junk mailing, which is about what
reserved-students e-mails are. E-mail is
more personal and should thus be more
personalized. Put up a flier; have a rally.
No one likes junk mail, and, unless it's your
group, no one likes reserved-students emails. Where's the kingdom of ends when
you need it?
The trickier distinction is between email and the telephone. It seems both
more and less personal. The medium allows for, although does not usually receive, a more composed and contemplative effort. It is not a conversation; it is an
instantaneous monologue, for good or evil.
In this sense, it is like a letter a formal
airing of one's concerns. But it is also less
formal than a telephone call; one need not
respond immediately. E-mail is more of
"I would like to mention" than it is "I need
to say." The line is, however, both thinand
dull.
On the other hand, huzzah for non-personal interpersonal communication. We
have objectified everything else; we can
now objectify the mind.

PANN NASEEMULLAH

n&
A protest
for dialogue
These days, you can't cross Parrish or
enter or leave a class without seeing a

poster about Al6, next weekend's political action at the World Bank and IMF
headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al6
promises to be on the scale of the WTO
demonstrations in Seattle, and many
Swatties are planning on driving down to
show support. This is an unequivocally
good thing, in my view.
I've also heard a lot of complaints as to
the exact wording in the posters, which I
can definitely understand. Do we really
want to close down the IMF and World
Bank? Can we reconcile the vagaries of
protest politics with the supposed rigor of
international political economy?
I would say yes, because what Al6
forces us
all of us who deal with the
issue
to do is to take time out and figure out why we are going down, or indeed,
why we are not going down, and what exactly do we want to accomplish through
our actions. What is happening slowly is a
change in the nature of protest, where
through discourse we come to grips with
a stronger idea of ourselves as members
of a political community. Al6 is perfectly
placed for this transition, too: inherently
a complex and nuanced issue, the World
Bank-IMF action does more than try to
end a specific policy or institution like the
School of the Americas. It forces us to
have our own clear, or not-so-clear, idea
about what's going on.
What is really going on is an action to
start a discussion that might save the
Bretton Woods institutions. Many of the
problems in the institutions indeed,
many of the things we are protesting
stem from a lack of openness, a shunning
of open dialogue, even an arrogance toward opinions outside of the intellectual
rigor of the institutions themselves. This
is why the IMF and the World Bank
dominated by the G7 nations and by virtue of non-democratic voting share and by
neo-liberal ideology
can come to countries and demand changes in policy which
are wholly unsuitable to those countries,
all required for multilateral aid.
When the protestors amass in Washington on April 16, the common thread in all
the divergent voices of the different
groups is going to be the lack of dialogue,
the ardent defense of status quo assumptions given only by power imbalances.
This is the prime legitimacy of the protest: it will, by whatever means, initiate
an open discussion questioning some of
the assumptions that have been only secretly questioned before.
What this questioning and this discussion may lead to is a true voluntarism in
how our lives are run. This may sound
kooky, but think about it: if the Bretton
Woods institutions can move in a direction toward true economic development
decided by true discussion, then we have
possibly ended the determinism that
power and politics seem to force. This may
seem to be completely impossible, like
resisting gravity. But we resist gravity
each time we take to the skies. Would this
be that much different?

Should you know what I know?
By Carlyle Price
For The Phoenix
A couple of weeks ago, I was having a
conversation with a freshman acquaintance of mine. We were having an exam
the next period; since we'd had a previous exam for this class, we began to wonderhow this next one would compare. This
led, naturally, to a discussion of the previous exam's structure
you know, wording, format, etc. And that led the way to
an interesting comment that there were
assumptions, cultural and otherwise,
made in the writing of that test.
The conversation turned to the general
Swarthmore population and the assumptions under which we work: what the students here know or should know; and what
it's assumed we can do and know how to do.
I believe the idea expressed was that professors here expect a lot of things from
Swatties that perhaps they shouldn't. (I say
believe because I haven'tbeen able to reach
this person since to get a clearer explanation.) Some of us are public school kids who
got work done on the side while throwing
themselves into extracurricular activities
for personal amusement. It doesn't make us
any less deserving to be here than other
Swatties, or any less capable than them
it just means thatthe challenges and adjustment process is different for us than others. The expectations held of us are unfair
in that they are unjustified.
The professor had been asked about the
exam, which had resulted in a poor performance by someone who I knew had command of the material. The point of contention was that the student had performed

The point of contention was that the student had performed poorly
due to an inability to understand most of the questions and what

poorly due to an inability to understand most
of the questions and what was asked for;
those questions that were not understood
made references to things considered general knowledge that were unknown to the
student. The rebuttal was that the professor hadn't written the test, though he was
sorry. However, when asked what would be
done, the issue was left in the air.
This was a bomb for me. Personally, I
had never thought about things this way
before. I was fortunate enough to be "prepared" in the manner described. I investigated this some more with other friends
of mine through discussion, and they concurred. One said that she and her roomeven
mate were a classic example
through their junior year, this preparation
shines through in little things. For example,
references that her roommate knows, such
as Greek mythology, Romantic poets, vocabulary words, or the Bible, can take up a
lot of her time to investigate, impeding her
work progress. It was a source of personal
conflict for her. She felt she should know
these things; on the other hand, how was
she supposed to know them? Also, she
added, her roommate has a sense of work
ethic and discipline that she feels was
never cultivated in her high school.She was
never taught to work or to study.

That last statement piqued my own inter-

est. I myself feel as if my private high

schools let me slide, under the assumption
that I knew how to do the work and just
never had the time to do so. While I'm closer
to understanding how to do it and what it is,
I struggle daily with self-motivation and
discipline, and many of my friends seem to
have the same issue, be they private schoof
or public school products.
So my question for the reading public
is, what exactly do you think? I'm
stumped. I know I feel as if cultural minorities in the world at large are expected
to have their stuff together, but why this
idea persists I have no true idea; we have
issues and problems like everyone else to
contend with. I have seen it happen to
myself and to others: the pressure to sue-*
ceed, the expectation to deal or even just
to cope and the failure to do so. It's painful, and, as I look around, I can see that
struggle every day.
Is it necessary to go through this here?
Does it have to be this way in general?And
what, as individuals, as a school and as
part of a greater society, can we do to better or correct it?
I ask because I don't think I truly ur*
derstand this, and I think these are impor-

Psych Services patients risk deception
By Nicole Bouttenot
Phoenix Staff
This past Monday I had a terrifying experience. David Ramirez, the Director of
Psych Services, came and spoke to my
counseling class. Great. Wonderful. Firsthand information from the head guy.
Well, he certainly gave me information,
but the things he said made me very upset.

As Mr. Ramirez shared with the class
his experiences as a counselor, I found
out that his psychological orientation is
psychoanalytic. Although this brings pictures of Freud and the infamous couch
to mind, I know enough about counseling
to keep an open mind. Mr. Ramirez didn't
mention any couches, and Freud was actually discredited.
So I asked him if students know that he
is of the psychoanalytic orientation. Now
this is where I am flabbergasted. He says
thatalthough he cannot speak for the student body, he does not think that they
know or that they should know. Mr.
Ramirez told us that if students knew his
orientation, they would be less likely to
seek out Psych Services. He essentially
told us that the students seeking help
from Psych Services do not need to know

Services. Become an informed
consumer of Swarthmore's
mental health services.
what kind of counselor they are seeing.
He also said that he does not tell or teach
his interns to tell students what their
therapeutic journey will be like.
I hope you understand why this upset
me. However, if I have just confused you,
maybe this imaginary situation will help
clear things up. Imagine that you are failing all your classes, you and your boyfriend just broke up, and your family is
thinking about moving to Alaska. You decide to go down to Psych Services. But you
don't even know where Psych Services is
located. Things sound pretty bad, and you
sound very uninformed. So you call the
college operator and after saying "Psychological Services" five times, you are finally connected. A very nice woman answers the phone, and if you are lucky, you
get an appointment. (If you are unlucky,
you could get put on a waiting list. Usually this starts around midterms. How-

ever, this year, the waiting list began well
before the midterm crunch started.) You
find out where Psych Services is located
and you hang up.
Your job is done, right? All you need to
do is show up, right? Wrong. When you go
shopping, you don't justbuy the first thing
you see upon entering the store, be it*
clothes, computers or the general necessities. In fact, I've seen some of you take
as long as ten minutes to decide what
shampoo to buy. So why is it that you think
that the first person they give you at Psych
Services is the right one? Do you think
they pull your file and match you perfectly
with one of their plethora of counselors?
Think again. They find you the person who
fits your schedule. This person may or
may not be compatible for you. So what
you need to do is interview them on the
first visit. Find out how they think people
work. Ask them to explain in plain English
what their orientation is. Ask them how,
the process of counseling works. If you
don't like the person or feel comfortable,
ask to see someone else. If you don't like
Psych Services, ask for the names of local counselors. Ask the local counselor all
the questions you asked the person in
Psych Services.
I have two points here. First,
Swarthmore students need to ask questions when using Psych Services. Become
an informed consumer of Swarthmore's
mental health services. Second, how can
Mr. Ramirez say that students don't need
to be informed of his orientation or the
counseling process they will be involved
in? How can Mr. Ramirez be here at
Swarthmore with such an un-Swarthmore
outlook on life? Why does this man have
so much power? I think that the college
administration is doing the students a
grave disservice by allowing this man to '
have so much power. Maybe it's time to
look at Psych Services a bit more closely
jr
and make some much needed changes. «^V'4

Lily Marsh ’Ol, once a tri-varsity athlete (softball, volleyball and basketball)

but now confined to volleyball due to a fractured kneecap, picked Swarthmore
because it represented the perfect middle ground. As a prospective college
student, she explored many NCAA Division II schools, as well as some Division
I schools for volleyball, but in the end Marsh realized that “[at] all the schools
that had very good athletics and academics, the athletics were too good for me,
and the schools that were really good at athletics, theiracademics weren’t good
enough for me.”
The same applies to Jay. Jay, who hails from Cape Cod, Mass., eschewed
schools in the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) such
as Williams or Amherst, which were closer to home, because she found their
athletics too demanding.
Hillery, who was exploring many Division I-AA programs, spoke of particular aversion to the degree of control coaches had over their players at these
schools. They would institute mandatory study halls and in many cases, arrange
their players’ academic schedules for them. “At Swarthmore and a lot of other
Division 111 schools you’re a student and then you’re an athlete,” he noticed, “as
opposed to those schools where you’re an athlete and then you’re a student.”
Swarthmore may provide student-athletes the rare opportunity to wear both
hats at once, but it often comes at a steep price. “You have academics and you
have athletics, and each one wants everything of you,” explained Amy White
’OO, co-captain of this year’s softball team, “and you want to give each one everything you’ve got, but you can’t.”
Wanting to excel both as a student and an athlete translates into a punishing
schedule. Hillery estimates during football season he devotes about 30-plus hours
to the sport. On the average practice day, he would head down to the fieldhouse
around 3 p.m., watch film and attend meetings until getting suited up for practice, which lasted to around 7 p.m.. A game day, usually Saturdays, would span
approximately ten hours, from the early morning team breakfast to the blow
of the final whistle. On Sundays, the players participate in a light running and
lifting workout which takes up four hours.
“It’s really kind of a non-stop, on-the-go schedule,” said English of her routine.
Ellis found his summer last year cut short because of his commitment to
football. After finals ended, he spent a mere two days at home before headduring which time i
ing out to the East Coast for a twelve-week internship
he maintained a football lifting program and just a week after completing I
the internship he returned to campus for preseason training.

playoffs.
But by and large Swarthmore student-athletes seem to manage just fine. ||
11
Many of them have been practicing the same juggling act since their high
schools days and have it down cold by now. If anything, having a tight
schedule forced them to be more disciplined and efficient.
“If I only have a two-hour window and have two hours of work, I have to
get it done,” Hillery analyzed, “but if have two hours work and an eight- S
hour window, it’s always like, I’ll just do it later.”
|||
Shin sums up his time-management philosophy most succinctly. “You
try to cut away the fat,” he said.
“Procrastination isn’t an option,” quipped English.
In fact, many student-athletes find themselves more productive academically while they are in season. During off-season, Leary, a tennis player, finds
it hard from time to time to get his act together. “It just doesn’t work out that
I have two hours each day,” he said, “it gets wasted somehow.”
To c yert disaster often requires a advance planning, and most disasters can
be av jided with some extra foresight. “You know both your athletic events and
studies ahead of time,” said Hillary, “you know what’s coming up.” “Everyone
procrastinates to a certain point,” he admits, with a slight chuckle, “...instead
of procrastinating until Sunday for something you have due Monday morning,
you procrastinate until Friday and do it then.”
When all fails, where there’s a will, there’s a way. “If it means getting up
earlier, staying up until the crack of dawn that seems to be the solution, and
it seems to work,” said English matter-of-factly.

his teams at Swarthmore.
Teammates serve a source of solace when the going gets rough. “It’s a support system in a lot of ways,” noted Cochran-Bond. As a freshman player, she
recalled, it was nice to “have people looking out for you from the very beginning.”
Athletic competition also provides an alternative form of personal validation
and growth outside of academic assessment. “I think it’s a confidence builder
when you’re able to do something that isn’t going to be shot down for a grade,”
Shin proposed, “you can be satisfied even if you don’t score a goal or you don’t
have an assist.”
Jay echoed his sentiments. “It’s a way of testing myself that’s not going to get
a grade,” she said, referring to her athletic contests, “it’s a way of testing myself that I can do something and I can validate myself or I can be validated by
my teammates.”
COMBINING ATHLETICS & ACADEMICS
But as much as athletics offer, and as much as it means to them, studentathletes came here with a clear mission: to develop their academic potential
fully. None of the athletes interviewed chose Swarthmore because of its athletic program. Rather, more often than not, it was the lure of a quality education and the chance to partake in a competitive athletic experience that sealed
the deal. Swarthmore appealed to them as a place where they could truly be

footthat Heather deserves more,” she continued in a wistful tone, “I want to
win for her, for all the effort she’s putting on the field.”
And despair often leads to needless and damaging self-abuse. After a loss,
Ellis would go back to his room and internalize it. He would think to himself,
“What more could I have done? What did I do wrong? What is it about me, what
is it about it that I do to the team that we’re losing?” “Constantly all four years
I would call myself into question,” he said.
And it’s not as if the student-athletes had anything delightful to come home
to. You would return from an away loss, completely drained, “and buddies on
the wrestling team aren’t winning,” Culley said.
“The thing is,” Jay said, “when you lose and you’re just dejected and depressed,
what do you have to come home to but more work?”
“It’s not like you can just take the night off and watch ‘When Harry met Sally’
and eat chocolate ice cream. You can’t you have to come back and do your
physics problem set or something like that.”
It also doesn’t help coming back to a campus that is ambivalent at best about
the role of athletics and athletes. Culley notes the conspicuous absence of
letterman jackets on campus, which were still popular his freshman year.
While the interviewed athletes didnot feel disrespected by professors acrossthe-board, many felt that their teachers simply do not understand the meaning
of athletics to them. “There’s always this underlying question that’s unspoken:
‘Well, it’s your choice to do this, you’re kind of bringing this onto yourself. If
you’re having trouble, you don’t have to play,’ observed White.

We Don't

From SWARTHMORE ATHLETICS, pg. 13
The competitive energy that student-athletes bring to
the field also carries over to other spheres. "In general
going to practice and working in practice translates into
also working hard after practice in the library," according to Darren Wood 'Ol, a third-year lacrosse player.
Especially when the team is doing well, the jubilant
energy definitely rubs off on other aspects of a player's
life. "If things are going well, and you're having a positive experience on the field with the team, then it can
help you deal with whatever challenges you have to deal
with outside the sport," said White
For some student-athletes, the rigorous routine has become so integral to their lives that they would not know
what to do without it. "It might be more upsetting to my
system in the long-run to not have [the demanding schedule]," English said.
None of the interviewed students have cited any academic difficulties whatsoever. Schmitt does not recall
asking for a single extension throughout her four years
here.
"I always get my work done, I always get my papers
done and I do all my reading," said Jay.
Hillery has only missed class for athletics several times
during his career, and doing so, he realizes imposes a
higher burden on himself. "The main thing is if you miss
a couple of [classes] for sports you can't miss thoseother
ones just for sleeping in."
As successfully as student-athletes can balance both
sides of the equation, other aspects of their lives have to
give. Asked about whether her athletic commitments
ever wreaked havoc on her life, Jay recounted her recent indoor season when she ran an excess of events,
found herself constantly tired and slept whenever she
could. Friday nights were spent working in Cornell. She
worked on Saturdays both before and after her meets.
Jay in particular laments her lack of involvement in
other aspects of campus life, especially community service. Coincidentally, her interview was interrupted when
her friend and hallmate Mattie Weiss 'OO came by to invite her to the upcoming protests of the IMF in Washington D.C. Jay could only give her a tentative answer. After Weiss left, she lamented her indecision. "I want to
support Mattie's activism and I believe in it," she said,
but her heavy schedule often forces her into a dead alley. Even though friends have suggested that athletics
are her way of giving back to the community, Jay "still
feels crummy about not being able to volunteer for Empowered Painters" (a job-creation program run by
Swarthmore students) on Saturday because of track
meets.

LACK OF COMPETITIVENESS
The punishing schedule and the inability to broaden
their scope of activities beyond the two poles of academics and athletics aside, what hurts student-athletes the
most is the psychological toll that chronic lack of competitiveness brings. For reasons that will be explored in
full detail in part two of this series, unfortunately losing
indeed, losing consistently has been a major theme
in the life of the Swarthmore student-athlete. The woes
are not exclusive to the notorious football team, which
only narrowly escaped breaking the NCAA record for
longest losing streak last year. While the women's programs have performed well throughout the years, the
men's programs are suffering from a major slump. In
men's sports, Swarthmore has gone from 27 Centennial
Conference wins in the 1995-96 seasons to a mere 7 wins
so far this season.
For many student-athletes, who often come from highly
competitive high school programs, the transitionis never
easy. Hillery knows this phenomenon well. In his entire
high school career, he lost a total of four football games.
He lost his first four college games in four weeks at
Swarthmore.
Culley, who enjoyed a highly successful freshman season but has since encountered little success with his team,
took stock of his basketball career in a tone of resignation. Because of a lack of players, he would find himself

at 6'4" fighting for rebounds against players who were

67" or 6'B". In a sport where height is of paramount importance, Swarthmore has only one player above 6'4",
whereas Johns Hopkins has 16, he pointed out. Culley
was forced to play three positions over the years, sometimes even starting at center. "It's not an overall healthy
experience," he said with a sigh.
The worst enemy of an athlete is hopelessness, but that
is precisely the cloud that hovers around Swarthmore's
poorer teams. Staying competitive implies a realistic
hope of winning, and that often makes all the difference.
"If you lose a game by four points, you lose, a loss is a
loss," said Hillery, "but it still gives everyone a better
feeling that you're going to go out next weekend and win."
Ellis, who has only one win to his credit during his four
years here, found his youthful idealism quickly depleted
as his football career at Swarthmore progressed. At
first, he felt that by simply playing harder the
team could overcompensate for its lack of players. When the optimism proved unjustified, he
would try to cull some value from the experience. "You have to persevere when you feel
like there's no hope," he said, "I guess you can
say it's character building," his tone betraying more thana trace of skepticism. But eventually reality would sink in, and so would the
consequences.
M
"It's hard," he said, his voice trailing, "it hurt
us in ways that we don't quite understand yet.
We can only begin to realize that yes, it really
did hurt us."
Jay recalled a particularly poignant moment after a one-sided loss. Her teammate Heather
Marandola 'Ol, a tri-varsity athlete (soccer, basketball, softball), was giving it her all during the
game. "I just look at her running up and down and
trying so so hard," she remembered, "and I see
the losing scoreboard..." After the game, she
watched as Marandola took off her cleats, and sat
on the ground pensively, pondering the latest defeat.
Jay promptly walked over to sit next to her, putting
her hand around her, trying to absorb some of the
grief. "We both know we've tried hard and it just
wasn't there," she recalled of the moment. "I always just feel at those times Becca HowesMischel 'Ol, a swimmer, remembers the time she
asked for an extension on a paper so that she
could focus on her Conference meet. Her professor asked her, "Well, is it worth it?" She was
completely indignant, thinking to herself, "Of
course it's worth it. How can you ask me this?"
Ellis frustratingly recalls how a professor
knowingly scheduled a seminar right after football practice. All he had time for was to grab a
sandwich in Sharpies, and he would eat it on his
way to seminar. He arrived exhausted, stillhungry, in no shape for any level of engagement
whatsoever. "I felt completely disenfranchised," he said. "Just scheduling that class was
such a big slap in the face to me as a football
player," Ellis continued, the disappointment
evident in his voice.
B
Sometimes even your closest friends fail to
understand. Cochran-Bond thought back to one
occasion when she was complaining about how
time-consuming her away games were to a friend
The friend replied plainly, "Why don't you just quit?"
Howes-Mischel, who suffers from a chronic shoulder injury that requires that she take an ungodly number of Advil pills before each practice, found her
friends equally unsympathetic towards her persistence
"But it put you through so much pain, why do you do
it?" her friends would wonder.
Schmitt remembers how recently her chemistry colleagues "raised a stink" when she had to reschedule her
senior talk, part of her graduation requirement, because
it conflicted with her final soccer game at Swarthmore.
"I have to go babysitting in the afternoon and we're not
moving it for that," a fellow chemistry major opined.

The heightened sense of community among athletes
student-athletes frequently attend each other's games
and events does alleviate the burden somewhat, but
ultimately it comes down to something more fundamental.
After losing their respective soccer games, Schmitt
and Shin would often commiserate together, "not yelling
at each other, but just yelling about everything to each
other and venting and what not." By the end of these
sessions, they would both have rediscovered theirpurpose. "We would both realize we both love this game,"
said Schmitt, "and we're gonna go back out there and

HEARTS OF DARKNESS
By Catherine Osborne
Phoenix Staff
The room is the kitchen of a three-room house in a town a
long trainride from Johannesburg. One ancient electric light
fixture hangs above the table, oldnewspapers are strewn across
the floor, frogs are croaking in the darkness outside and in this
tiny space Johnnie Smit (Allen Radway) is slowly going mad.
So begins Seth Olshfski 'oo's elegant, passionate presentation of "Hello and Goodbye," a play in two acts by the South
African Athol Fugard. Olshfski's senior honors thesis, the
play encompasses a long night and a vast emotional journey
a jourfor Johnnie and his sister Hester (Corinna Burns)
ney which, like so many things in their lives, elicits intense
pain and leaves them little in return.
Johnnie, in his late twenties, is still living in the siblings'
childhood home when his elder sister unexpectedly returns
after 10 years of absence. Hester, bitter, confused, and down
on her luck, is looking for "her share": ostensibly, half of the
money their father received as compensation after the dynamite accident that crippled him; in reality, a single good
memory ofher childhood, otherwise known as a reason to live.
As the two rummage through the crumbling cardboard boxes
that contain their inheritance, the play peels away their layers like onion skins: each successive revelation only shows
/
us another mask, until neither has anything left to hide.
Radway's defensive, manic Johnnie is often moving. /
Shifty and overly bright when interacting with his sister, I
left alone onstage he becomes pathetic, continuously dig- \
ging for the perfectly expressive word (a search which
mirrors that for some kernel of truth in his disintegrating
identity). But it is Burns, as Hester, who controls the production. In emotional hyperdrive from the moment she enters the stage, she chain-smokes her way through the play
in a part it would have been easy to play as callous or insane. It is to Burns' credit that she takes neither of these
routes for Hester, instead choosing an exhausting trajectory through desperation, greed, grief, anger, and, finally,
weariness mixed with a tiny measure of hope.
The play, lit by Jim Murphy and with costumes by Kiran
Rikhye 'O2, is staged beautifully by Olshfski. In his hands
Fugard's drama becomes a set of shifting sounds and images that linger long after the final blackout and force these
siblings' tragedy upon us: the clink, clink of cutlery on halffull glasses; Hester in her slip, tense and coiled on a kitchen
chair, speaking half to herself; or Johnnie on his knees, carefully gathering up every last one of the tiny fragments of
paper scattered across the floor.

Only joke in 'Rumble' is its nationwide release
By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff
I like to think I have a decent
sense of humor. If something is
funny, I will almost always laugh.
I appreciate good comedy. Robin
Williams busts my gut every
time; George Carlin really gets
me rolling; and, though I hang my
head in shame, even JimCarrey's
mindless routines spawn an occasional smile. Like I said, if it's
funny, I'll laugh. If, however, it's
stupidity posing as humor, if it's
ludicrous to the point of nausea,
I won't. Instead, I'll fume, envisioning myself as a professional
wrestler preparing to body slam
the producer who dared endorse
a work of utter garbage.
In the dark of Marple's AMC
theaterSaturday night, I sat fuming, picturing myself in a gaudy
sequined singlet with producer
Jeffrey Silver in a headlock. The
man should be truly mortified,
having put his name on such a
wretched movie. "Ready to
Rumble," the story of two guys
stuck in prepubescence who believe with all their immature

little hearts in the reality of professional wrestling, is a flop, a
complete and total atrocity.
There might be guys on campus who will argue this one with
me, who will stick up for the comedic value of the film, but, as
Swarthmore is renowned for recruiting the world's best and
brightest, I rather doubt it. The
thing is, I've racked my brain for
just one positive thing to say
about this film, and I've come up
short. Nothing in the script not
the acting, nor the purportedly
laughable antics of the reject
main characters
can redeem
this one. The only real joke in
"Ready to Rumble" is that it was
actually released.
Reading this, you're thinking
I'm too harsh. Perhaps that's the
case. Perhaps I've been too
harsh, allowing my bias against
professional wrestling to taint
my interpretation of the film, to
prevent me from recognizing
the quality screenwriting that
helped create a soon-to-be timeless masterpiece. After all, no
movie to date has so superbly
captured the aesthetic qualities

of World Championship Wrestling, which is what this one is
based on.
David Arquette and Scott Caan
star as two loser guys with testosterone overload and no real direction. They live at home, drain
excrement from Port-A-Pottys
for a living and obsess about the
wonders of professional wrestling, especially as it pertains to
theirfavorite contender, Jimmy
King, played by a most filthy,
unkempt Oliver Piatt. After his
humiliating (and very fake) defeat by Diamond Dallas Page,
JimmyKing is thrown out of the
ring and the professional wrestling scene. Depressed and very
drunk, he hits the road in his
motor home and eventually finds
himself and his career rescued
by the septic men.
As I said earlier, nothing in this
film is terribly funny, nor is anything terribly clever. "Ready to
Rumble" is very low-budget, and,
mostly, very low-effort: it boasts
an outrageously shoddy script
with a few token celebrities
thrown in. (For example, the
woman better known as Marilyn

Photos Courtesy www.readytorumble.com

Manson's long-term love interest
than as an actress with any kind
of talent, Rose McGowan, and
several hulking beasts of ridiculously named pro wrestlers.)
Maybe it wouldn't have been so
bad if it hadn't been done to such
excess. Too many wrestlers
spoiled the show.
All I could think as I watched
this crummy film was that it was
a sell-out, a desperate, but half-

hearted attempt to scrounge up
new material that would appeal
to the adolescent crowd. This
film was way over the top;
"Dumb and Dumber" at its worst
moments put this tale of two devoted wrestling fans to shame. If
nothing else, "Ready to Rumble"
proved Hollywood's indiscretion,
that it will stop at nothing to capitalize on the pocketbooks of
teeny-boppers across America.

Vertigo-go
alumni reunion
tour on the go
By Deirdre Conner
Phoenix Staff
Celebrating 10 years of humor, comedy
improv group Vertigo-go is gearing up for
its biggest, most hilarious event to date.
The Swarthmore group's first reunion
show is set to take place at 9 p.m. Saturday in Lang Concert Hall, featuring current members of the comedy improv
group alongside Vertigo-go alumni.
"It's going to be frickin' cool!" member
Marah Gotcsik 'O2 said.
Gotcsik expects 18Vertigo-go alumni to
converge on the campus Saturday morning, where they will practice with the
group to get back intothe groove of VGG's
traditionally hilarious comedy games. The
idea of working with past VGGers has
members visibly excited, and with good
reason. Many of the alumni visiting this
weekend have gone on to be successful in
the entertainmentbusiness.
"It was so amazing I couldn't believe
I was e-mailing this guy who was on Saturday Night Live, and he was like, 'Yeah,
I'll get off the R3 [train] at 10:30,'" Gotcsik
said.
Visiting VGG alumni include Krister
Johnson '94, who was featured as an extra on NBC's "Saturday Night Live;" Jodie
Sherman '97, who works with ComedySportz in Austin, Texas; Leah Gotcsik '97
(yes, she is Gotcsik's sister, and they are
performing together for the first time),
who is withImprovAsylum in Boston; and
Brent Askari '92, a screenwriter for "Not
Ready for Prime Time."
"Something I discovered [in putting the
show together] was that the alums were
just as excited as we were," Jerry
Melichar 'OO said.
Vertigo-go was founded in 1989by Gail
Lerner '92 and Karen Arndt '92, who are
both coming from Los Angeles to attend
the reunion. Lerner now works for a nonprofit organization translating jokes into
other languages for world peace. VGG
members estimate that 50 percent of their
alumni go on to work in the entertainment

However, though they are performers
in every sense of the word, VGG doesn't

always take theconventional performance

route in its studies. Some members had
no real experience when they auditioned
for the group.
"One cool thing about VGG is that you
don't feel the need to be a theater major,"
said Gotcsik. "Karly [Ford 'o3] hadn't done
theater since her third grade play, but at
auditions she just had this spark."
This year, Vertigo-go has been doing
some expanding. They attended the
Harvard Improv Comedy Festival where
they, with 12 other schools, participate in
workshops and performances. They also
went to the Skidmore National Comedy

Festival.
"Through going to festivals, I've been
getting e-mails asking for us to go to other
colleges. We've developed a goodrelationship with other improv groups," Gotcsik
said.
Plans for the future include doing a comedy sports show against the Bryn Mawr/
Haverford improv group, and possibly
starting a sketch comedy ensemble. They
also want to bring the Harvard group,
Immediate Gratification Players, to campus next year.
As the saying goes, it's not easy being
funny. Vertigo-go practices their antics
five hours a week to amuse theiraudience
with a group dynamic that is different
every year.

"It's been one of the most consistentand
also most changing experiences of my
life," said Melichar.

Workin' it at
the fitness center
Are the people who frolic on Parrish
Beach people I have never seen before or
do they just look different in the sunlight?
This spring, however, a whole new frolicking scene has opened up and consequently complaints about people who walk
around barefoot have decreased. The
Mullan Fitness Center facilitates a new
non-segregated interaction among the
people who say they are there for a cardiovascular workout with the people who
say they wish to concentrate on weight
training.
It is common knowledge that people do
not really go to the new fitness center to
work out. This excuse was more credible
at the old gym where only desperation,
cold weather and serious procrastination
would drag a select number of people into
the smelly chamber-like rooms. "Hey, do
you wanna go work out?" has ceased to be
a pathetic pickup line at Swarthmore.
The first time I went to the Mullan Center, a couple of Swatties were going
through the sign-in book and, unsatisfied,
decided that they would return later when
the list of people on the sheet better met
their needs. "We're not here to work out,
we're here to work it."
Although everyone I spoke to wished to
remain anonymous, most agreed that it's
flirting territory. Most of the talk that goes
on inside the fitness center is the grunting, mating calls of people lifting weights
and new and improved pick-up lines never
before heard on this campus. Sources tell
me that not all the pick-up lines are successful; some of the better ones I have
heard either directly or through the grapevine are:
"Yo, we're wearing similar wife-beaters."
"You're really good at climbing that escalator thing."
"Where's the elliptical cross-trainer?"
"They call me the elliptical crosstrainer."
"There are better things you can ride
than that bike."
"That's a nice set of barbells."
"That's OK, you don't need to wipe your
sweat off the machine, I like it sweaty."
"Didn't Nietzsche have something to say
about the treadmill?"
"You look so much better in spandex."
And this brings us to the expanded
spandex-use phenomena. The new fitness
center has triggered a huge increase in
form-fitting Lycra, "especially among the
people running around the outdoor track,"
claims Andrea Kussack 'Ol. "Well, that's
because they know [we] on the treadmills
are watching them," clarifies Regina Liu
'Ol. Many students agree that there is a
high correlation between the use of the
outdoor track and the opening of the new
fitness center (with strategically located
Stairmasters, treadmills and stationary
bikes that face the outdoor track), which
cannot simply be explained by agreeable
weather. Mathew Trakimas 'O2 confirms,
"There's definitely more people using the
outdoor track this year than last." As the
end of the semester approaches, students

Lottery drama unfolds in fieldhouse frenzy
By David King
Phoenix Staff
As room choosing began for rising juniors on Monday evening, Jae Chung 'O2
and Justin Kramon 'O2 stood amidst a sea
of talkative students in Tarble Pavilion.
Kramon's hands fidgeted and the ball of
his foot swiveled against the shiny,
wooden-paneled floor.
"Lottery numbers 421 [to] 425," announced a voice over the loudspeaker.
"Bluggh!" blurted out Kramon.
Chung was to pick for the two on his
number, 429. They were hoping for a tworoom double in Mertz.
Chung assessed their chances: "Hopefully. I think so. Maybe. I don't know."
When numbers 426 to 430 were called,
Chung checked in with Dan Wood 'OO, who
sat at the check-in table next to a tall, red
curtain that divided the gymnasium in
two. Slipping behind the far end of the
curtain, he met an eerie quiet.
He walked forward, waving to Sam
Picard 'Ol, his current RA, who sat with
other RAs behind a string of tables. After
signing up at the Mertz table, he walked
slowly across the room to Cristina
Cardemil 'Ol, who wrote his and Kramon's
room numbers
337 and 339
on a yellow legal pad.
"How do I get out of here? Do I just go
this way?" he asked of no one in particular, after leaving the check-out table. He
soon disappeared behind a set of bleachers.
By 8 p.m., an hour of room choosing had
passed. The voice over the loudspeaker
boomed, "Lottery numbers 501 through
510, please check in." Stefan Gary 'O2 and
Marvin Barron 'O2 moved excitedly to the
check-in tableand disappeared behind the
curtain.
They approached the table with the "ML
more lovin'!!" sign. Gary received 674;
Barron had 504. They picked a two-room
double.
"I'm very excited that you're not SWIL,"
remarked a future RA who did not want
to be identified.
A short while later, Pukar Malla 'O2
came sprinting across the room to join
Rory Kondrad 'O2, who stood before the
Worth table. Kondrad had just that
evening accepted Malla's offer to pair up.
The two would now share a two-room

"Okay, who wants the bigger room?
Rory, do you want the bigger room?" asked
Bohee Yoon 'Ol from across the table.
"Yeah, I want the bigger room," replied
Kondrad.
"Wait, wait," Malla interjected.
When the deal was done (Kondrad kept
the bigger room), Kondrad high-fived
Picard. "Ow, baby! Uhh!" he exclaimed.
As the night progressed, John Dolan 'Ol,
Rodney Morris 'Ol and Jenny Yun 'Ol had
relatively few takers at the Palmer,
Pittenger and Roberts table. At one point,
as he lounged in his chair, Dolan offered
some wisdom about his role in signing up
hallmates.
"I find lying helps ease the process of
people choosing rooms," he commented.
(He insisted he was joking.)
Morris, who sat next to him, chimed in,
"Every room is a great room."
"Yeah," added Dolan. "Every room is a
great room."

At about 9:20 p.m., a dozen or so students
lingered among scattered backpacks,
jackets and papers. "If there are any rising juniors who have not drawn," Pat
the voice
Murray 'Ol
concluded,
"please approach thecheck-in tableat this
time."
Suma Balu 'O2 did so and walked around
the curtain.
"Roberts?" she asked of an RA.
"Roberts?" came the response. "That's
JohnDolan."
The PPR tablehadbeen folded up. Dolan
was nowhere to be found.
In his place, Yun sat down on a folding
chair and prepared to copy Balu's information.Balu disappeared and quickly returned with the four first-year women
with whom she would share a quint.
At close to 9:30, the curtain slowly rose
to a squeaking sound. As it did, Tiffany

up in the air, clenched her fists, and
screamed excitedly.

Elliot Smith's 'Figure 8' stripped of his earlier severity
gible sentences, he is also surprisingly lit-

ByJaeWon Chung
ForThe Phoenix

erate.

At an Elliott Smith show in Maxwell's, a
cozy, dimly lit restaurant bar in New Jersey, the first thing my friend Sam said
when Smith finally took the stage was,
"Heeeeey, he's not so ugly."
My first instinct was to laugh (I didn't
agree), my second to shield my mouth in
shame. Smith was only a few feet away,
sipping nervously at his beer; I didn't want
to scare him away. Fortunately, it appeared that he did not hear us. As 80 or so
people cheered, Smith began to pick his
guitar, performing a characteristically
meticulous song called "Son of Sam" (no
relation to my friend): the leading track
offhis new album "Figure 8," due out April
18 from Dreamworks.
I say all this only because Elliott Smith
is indeed one of those intriguing artists
whose work becomes exponentially more
fulfilling once you learn a little about him.
Already, you know that, on the surface at
least, he's no Backstreet Boy (not that I
want him to be)
in my opinion he is more
a cross between a dingy Vincent Galloand
a bear. In speech, he is painfully incoherent, his voice carrying an unexpected, prepubescent pitch (the Mike Tyson effect).
In the handful of interviews in which he
has done, he speaks, at best, in taut silences and carefully misshapen clauses.
He shies away from publicity because to
not do so would be, as he would say, "the
opposite of not being unpretentious." For
a man who struggles to speak in intelli-

"Figure 8" is an album which satisfies the
trend Smith has been setting for himself
with his previous works. Since the release
of his first solo album, "Roman Candle"
(from Kill Rock Stars), his musichas gradually moved from a medley of spare yet intricate guitar and vocals to a polyphonic
montage of clean, layered instrumentals,
often associated with major studio recordings. In the album "Either Or," the first song
the 8-track
begins with an audible click
used to record the album switching on. By
contrast, "Figure 8" is frequently punctuated with moments of synthetic grandiosity; a symphony orchestra was even hired
to aid Smith in the production of the album.
First-time listeners will find Smith's
new album to be, at least, a pleasant deviation from the popular norm. Smith, in
a recent interview, reported that while
working on "Figure 8," he tried to best
utilize Dreamworks's production resources by compiling an album as eclectic as possible without neglecting hischief
musical interest, which is (as it always has
been) working with melodies. In fact, his
enchanting melodies are what tie the multifarious album together. Upon my second
listening, I was already feeling that irrepressible urge to sound out the notes of
my favorite tracks. While I was still unfamiliar with the lyrics, I was satisfied just
humming stupidly over the CD.
Listening to "Figure 8," old fans will notice that Smith has retained his quaint, infecting tendency to repeat his key lyrics

until they begin to resonate with inexplicable poignancy. While in his last album,
"XO," almost every such case of lyrical
repetition worked towards exquisite results, I found the technique less successful in "Figure 8." In "Everything Reminds
Me of Her" and "Everything Means Nothing to Me" (whose sappy juxtaposition in
the playlist, I might add, was a solemn disappointment), the chorus of each song recycles its title line and repeats it several
times. In "Everything Reminds Me of Her,"
the overall product is inane melodrama,
perhaps because the soulful twanging of
the guitar line behind it is already so full
of misery. Things work better with irony
in place, as in the case of "Everything
Means Nothing to Me." The nihilistic chorus is carried by an unlikely vocal vessel
which echoes with careful intricacy; even
the elaborate, chiming piano accompaniment furthers the mysterious disjunction
between meaning and sound, whose presence, as Smith repeats the linerelentlessly,
the listener is slowly led to recognize.
As a listener who is more attuned to his
earlier works, best represented by the
aptly-titled, canonic album "Elliott Smith,"
I could not help but feel somewhat alienated by "Figure 8." In "Elliott Smith," his
guitar is subtle and singular, punctuated
with moments of muscular edge. His
voice, while soft and soaring at the core,
is also textured with an amiable rawness,
so that when his voice cracks shamelessly
in the middle of a note, I can feel the immediacy of his performance as if he's in
the room with me. In many of the songs in

are giving the Swarthmore social scene new hope through spandex and
the Mullan Fitness Center. We no longer hear people at the waffle bar
at Sharpies say, "Hey you're in my Stat class, right?" but rather, "You're
the one that uses that machine
that... works your inner and outer
thighs
right?" We all know this person is thinking, "What's the name
of that 'sex-machine?' Interestingly enough, this machine is now located in front of a mirror so that users can observe themselves as they
use it and can easily observe otherpeople in the gym observing them at
the same time.
However, don't be too quick to assume that this is a new and revolutionary social phenomeneon; we are, after all, still sweaty Swatties in a
large room. Psychology major Liz Blair 'OO explains that all the excitement that goes on in the new gym is more properly defined as a
"misattribution of arousal."
This theory, covered in Introduction to Psychology, asserts that a
stimulus (exercising) can produce a "general state ofautonomic arousal"
(high heart rate and sweating). This arousal can be "shaped into a specific emotional experience" by a cognitive interpretation(seeing someone and confusing your sweating and heart-pounding as a reaction to
the attraction you feel to that person). Basically people think they're
horny because they're sweating as they observe so many spandex-wearing beings, when in reality, they're the same people we'll see in Beardsley
a few hours later.

"Figure 8," Smith's essential guitar lines
are present, yet too often become non-entities, blending seamlessly and
unremarkably into the accompanying
instrumentals. Smith's vocals also seem
overdone at times. In parts that are harmonized and modulated to resounding
perfection, his voice ends up relinquishing its identity; what appears instead is
flawless, angelic, but boring, having been
stripped clean of the severity that made
his earlier works so striking.
Regardless of my engagement to the
pre-corporate Smith, "Figure 8" will, in the
end, go down in Billboard history as an
altogether amiable album. Dreamworks
has recently invested its fair share towards popularizing Smith, and it will most
likely pay off. I presume that it will even
win some awards come Grammy time. Already, the "Son of Sam" music video has
gone intorotation on MTV2, and Smithand
his band will appear on Late Night with
Conan O'Brien next Friday. While it may
take some time for the public to crown
Elliott Smith as a pop icon, the release of
this new album will certainly make him
easier to swallow thanbefore (most of the
songs on "Figure 8" are uncharacteristically radio-friendly). Perhaps the days of
listening to Elliott Smith in a small,
crowdedbar will soon be numbered. So if
you ever decide to see a show, I advise you
to: 1) Take a tape recorder. (It will be better than any of his CDs.) 2) Laugh at him
when he comes on stage. (Laugh long and
hard at this rising idol.) 3) Bring me with
you. (Before it's too late).

Ultimate teams hold Garnet men lose two in a row
own at Yale Cup
By Mike Lloyd
Phoenix Staff

By Paul Wulfsberg and
AlyssaTimin
Phoenix Staff
Last weekend, the men's and
women's Ultimate teams participated in theprestigious Yale Cup,
perhaps the regular season's
toughest tournament. Competing
against America's premier
Frisbee squads, the Earthworms
and Warmothers had varying
degrees of success.
While the Worms struggled
against tough opponents and
ended up with a 1-4 record, the
Warmoms went 5-0 before choosing to forfeit their final game in
order to leave the tournament.
Sunday's unexpected snowstorm
left first-year standout Sanya
Carleyolsen hypothermic and
needing to get off the fields.
The women played the cream
of the Ultimate crop, defeating

Yale, Harvard, Haverford,

Amherst High School and a
school whose name they cannot
remember at this time before
reluctantly withdrawing from
the semifinals of the Cup. According to Carleyolsen, the usual
all-around team effort was
greatly aided by the outstanding
play of Patty Park 'O3 and Lizzy
Pike 'O3, who experienced a
"breakthrough."

The Earthworms lost to Tufts
13-5, Rice 13-6, Vassar 9-6 and
George Washington 8-5. However, they upset host Yale 13-8 in
a game on which captain Matt
Murphy 'OO said, "That kind of
win alone can make a weekend
enjoyable. The intensity was
magnificent." Equally magnificent was the Worms' opportunity
to heckle senior Vincent
Pallaver's brother, whoplayed on
the Tufts team.
Ben
Hamilton
'O3
complimented fellow frosh
Misha Horowitz: "Let us not forget Misha's long cut and beautiful snag in the end zone at a very
opportune time in the Yale game,
complete with at least two full
flourishes."
Pallaver praised captain Jeremy Slezak 'O2 for his defensive
layout in the end zone during the
first point of their game against
Rice University, as well as
Patrick Hagan 'O2 for his offensive play versus Yale. Galen
O'Toole 'O2 got credit for an
"enormous point block" (blocking the disc on defense) and an
upwind throw for a score.
Next on the schedule for the
Earthworms
and
the
Warmothers is the local "Layout
Pigout" tournament this weekend at Haverford.

After starting the season on a
six-game winning streak, the
Swarthmore men's lacrosse team
has dropped their last two con-

tests.

On Saturday, March 31, the
men took on the Western Maryland Green Terror and lost 19-10.
Last Saturday, the men traveled
to Kingston, N.Y. to play Bates
College and suffered an offensive drought, losing 12-5.
In their first Centennial Conference contest of the 2000 campaign, the Garnet Tide lost to a
very powerful Western Maryland team, ranked in the top 20
teams in Division 111. The Tide
came out ready for a dogfight
and to show Western Maryland
that last year's courageous performance in an overtime loss was
not a fluke. The gamewas a story
of two halves.
Swarthmore matched the Terror goal for goal in the first half,
with Coby Smith 'O2 scoring the
first goal for the Garnet. Even
though the Swarthmore offense
had trouble handling theball during set plays, the team managed
to score in transitionand while a
man up. The scoreboard showed
each team going into halftime
with four goals.
At the start of the third quarter several quick goals by each
team madethe score 7-7, but then

game, Swarthmore had trouble
with the slick turf and fast play
of the field. The offense had a
hard time possessing the ball for
any extended period of timeand
had an even harder time challenging the Bates goalie.
While Swarthmore was trying
to adjust to the playing conditions,
Bates was slowly building an insurmountable lead against the
Garnet Tide. The Tide managed
only one goal in the first halfwhen
Than Court 'O3 scored a goal off
of an assist from John Murphy
'O3. Going into halftime the Tide
was looking at a 5-1 deficit.
The second half did not turn
out any better for the Garnet as
Bates continued to slowly increase their lead. The floodgates
would have been thrown open on
the Swarthmore goal if it was not
for the play of goalie Sig
Rydquist 'OO. Rydquist made 19
saves, picked up a team-leading
nine ground balls and played a
nearly perfect game clearing the
ball. As it was, Bates only managed 12 goals by the end of the
game.
In the fourth quarter,
Swarthmore was able to crack
the Bates defense for several
goals. Mark Dingfield 'Ol,
Murphy, Pat Friel 'O3 and Court
all scored goals for Swarthmore.
Swarthmore continues its Centennial Conference schedule at
home on Saturday against
Dickinson.

Western Maryland capitalized on
several questionable calls and
Swarthmore turnovers to take
any confidence and momentum
away from the Tide. The Terror
went on a tear and scored nine
goals in the third to take a commanding lead into the fourth
quarter.
In the fourth quarter, the Tide
could not muster enough offense
to mount a comeback and only
scored three goals. The Terror
continued to ride their wave of
momentum from the third quarter and finished the game with 19
goals. In the second half, the inability of the whole Swarthmore
team to minimize mistakes resulted in an experienced Western
Maryland team taking advantage
of every opportunity to ensure
victory.
Commenting on the loss, team
captain Tucker Zengerle 'OO said,
"We are a young team and we
made some mistakes. Every team
takes its lumps from time to time,
and hopefully we can get back on
the right track next week."
Unfortunately, the Tide could
not get back to its winning ways
last Saturday against Bates College. The team traveled to a neutral field in Kingston, N.Y., to
play the school from Maine.
Playing a morning game on a
turf field far from the friendly
confines of Swarthmore College
seemed to take its toll on the Garnet Tide. From the outset of the

87-80 while the men lost 101-78 to their
competitors. Over the years, a rivalry has
developed between the Garnet and
Hopkins, especially since the Blue Jays
have begun to improve. Once upon a time,
competing against Hopkins meant an easy
win for Swarthmore, but the trend has
reversed and Hopkins is now very competitive with the Garnet.
The Swat women came away victorious
by seven points despite losing some cheap
points in the hurdles (since we had no competitors in those events). The men again
suffered from lack of depth as they fell
by about 30 points.
Whatever the overall scores, there were

still plenty of individual winners. Victorious for the women were Sarah Jay '01(800
meters, javelin), Desiree Peterkin 'OO
(triple, long jumps), Imo Akpan 'O2 (100,
200), Joko Agunloye 'Ol (1500, 3000) and
Sarah-Kate Selling 'O3 (pole vault, with a
new school record of 6 feet). Additionally,
the 400 and 1600 relay teams won easily.
On the men's side, Steve Dawson 'OO was
a three-event winner (high, triple, and long
jumps). Ariss DerHovanessian 'OO took the
400, Marc Jeuland 'Ol tookthe 1500 and the
5000, and Jeff Doyon 'OO left his competitors in the dust with a sparkling final lap in
the 3000 steeplechase. Kwaku Ntoso 'O3
won both hurdle events (400,110).
week, the squad will travel to the distant battlefields of Gettysburg for the
Mason Dixon Invitational, which promises
to be a very competitive meet. Nearly all
of the Centennial Conference teams will
be in attendance.

Women's tennis tied for second
With two matches

left in the season,

By Laura Brown
For The Phoenix
The women's tennis team is
tied for second place in the Centennial Conference with a 7-1
record. They have two conference matches left in the season,
which will determine their final
ranking.
The first win was a 5-4 finish
against Johns Hopkins on March
29. This was a match played under
conditions.
tough
Swarthmore was missing two
from their starting line-up, No. 3
Fran Simonds 'O2 and No. 4 Tanya
Chodibut 'O3, which meant that
the rest of the roster had to shift
up positions. The wins garnered
by Katherine Voll 'O3, who moved
up to No. 5 singles, and Laura
Brown 'OO, who played at No. 4
singles, were especially important. This match was highlighted
by ferocious wind and the spectacular serving of Laura "her
grace" Swerdlow 'O2. "Laura's
final ace on her underhand second serve really fired up the rest
of the team," remarked team cocaptain Jen Pao 'Ol.
The Garnet then faced

losing 2-7. Tough matches were
played at every position. Co-captain Brown noted "the special
concentration by Chodibut at No.
4 singles to play an opponent who
was grunting like a wild boar."
The only wins came at No. 1
doubles, where Pao and
Swerdlow edged out a thrilling 97 victory, and at No. 5 singles,
where Flather schooled her opponent in the third set.
Swat next faced Bryn Mawr at
home, slamming their way to an
8-1 victory. "Everyone played
well and won. What more needs
to be said?" commented co-captain Michaela DeSoucey 'OO.
The next three matches,
against Gettysburg, Dickinson
and Muhlenberg, were all won 63 by the Garnet. Against
Gettysburg, Swarthmore battled
the wind more than their opponents. Both Swerdlow and

Simonds battled out their
matches to three sets.
Playing at home against
Dickinson on Saturday, the Garnet were down 1-2 after the
doubles, with the only point coming in the No. 1 spot, where Pao
and Swerdlow shut down their
opponents 8-2. Swat picked it up
in their singles matches though,
with Pao, Swerdlow, Chodibut,
Flather, and Brown all picking up
victories.
On Tuesday, Swat faced
Muhlenberg, a team that has
pulled out some surprising victories this season. Swat went in
expecting a fight but faced more
danger from slipping on therainsoaked courts or catching hypothermia in the 35-degree
weather. Swat won five of the six
singles matches to secure the win
even before playing the doubles
matches.
Two home matches are coming
up soon for the team. They will
face their archrivals, Western
Maryland, on Friday and
Haverford on April 19. These
matches will determine the
team's ranking in the conference.
The team encourages spectators
to come and cheer them on.

Women's lax snaps three-game losing streak

By Amber Adamson
Phoenix Staff

paired

Sultans of Swat?
"So what do you think about our school's
moniker?" I asked my roommate, the esteemedScottKushner 'O2, looking to strike
up a conversation in order to procrastinate
from writing my paper on the titillating
topic of viewpoint invariance and geon
structural descriptions in object recognition.
"What the hell is it anyhow? The Garnet
Tide?" said Scott, "It sounds like our school
is menstruating."
I think about it every week. No, not menstruation, but the lack of a legit mascot.
What if, as sports editor, I juststopped calling us the Garnet Tide and switched to something I liked more? It's not like we're proud
enough of our current moniker to plaster it
on our jerseys and uniforms. The only place
you really see "garnet" is on the HomeShopping Network's white trash jewelry show
and in some of the terrible headlines we
write in the office sometimes. I can't stand
the way Lady Garnet sounds. And I'm never
sure whether to use it as a plural or not. So
maybe if we just picked something and
started using it, perhaps it might stick.
It'd be no big loss. For one thing, we need
to distance ourselves from those annoying
Harvard bastards (the Crimson not quite
as nice a shade ofred, says my discriminating eye), Alabama (The Crimson Tide), and
the swim team at my high school in Weston,
Mass. (The Red Tide). Some sort of "Tide"
may represent every swim team in existence. In any case, for a school that has a
liberal, imaginative and creative aura about
it, the only thing distinct about our moniker
is that it is distinctly unoriginal and bland.
m Does any one know what a "Garnet Tide"
is? Well, it's absolutely nothing, really. And
if you want to say we're just the Garnet, then
well, that's absolutely nothing too. Garnet
Tide probably comes from the term red tide,
which is sort of eco-Earth-something-savethe-rainforest-and-dolphins biological slang
for lotsof red algae in the ocean which grow
so dense it chokes off all of the fish life and
shellfish. That's intimidating or impressive
only if you're on theDown'easter Alexa and
they won't let you sell no stripers.
Teams hate it. None of the club teams go
by it. The men's tennis team goes by the
"Bandits," the women by the "Wet Bandits"
(I'm not going to ask, and I'm fairly sure I
don't want to know). You don't see many, if
any,
Garnet Tide T-shirts in the bookstore.
v
Many other teams take on their own names
periodically. I've always liked Sybarites (a
person devoted to living a life of excessive
luxury, e.g. me) andSalukis (a bad-ass hunting dog, e.g. my ex-girlfriend from back
home). Or what about the Sultans, as suggested by Julie Cohen (then we'd be "The
Sultans of Swat")? And those are just a few
of the "S" possibilities.
Swarthmore is often a place derelict of
any school spirit. While a new moniker isn't
going to solve thatproblem, it can be a small
step in that direction. Perhaps the mere process of selecting a new mascot would increase the feeling of community. Student
creativity and art could be the centerpiece
of the new selection process.
If the administration won't facilitate the
selection of a new moniker, I may go insane
and run the contest myself in Phoenix sports
and just stick to whatever gets picked. God
knows I've turned a shade of Garnet enough
times trying to write different headlines for
the women's athletic teams.

The action this week for women's lacrosse included matches against three of
the top 11-ranked teams, which, unfortunately, all resulted in losses. Nevertheless,
the women put forth noble efforts in defeat, and were rewarded for their efforts
on Tuesday, when they grabbed a win over
Cedar Crest College. The Garnet are now
1-3 in the conference and 6-5 overall.
Katie Tarr 'O2 had a hat trick vs. No. 11
Ursinus in a Centennial Conference game.
With her first of two tallies vs. No. 1 College of New Jersey, Tarr scored the 100th
goal of her career. Goalkeeper Jane
Kendall 'OO turned aside 24 Collegeof New
Jersey shots in that match. She also
stopped 18 shots against Ursinus and
blocked 19 Gettysburg attempts.
Midfielder Julie Finnegan 'OO had a pair
of goals vs. the No. 9 Bullets, boosting her
career-best total to seven. Defender
Kristen English 'Ol scored three goals
with two assists over the course of the
week.
The Lady Garnet were down, but not for
long, as they had little time to dwell on
the losses. They traveled to Allentown on
Tuesday to take on Cedar Crest in a nonconference game. They came back with a
big win to snap their three-game losing
streak. Tarr led the attack with five goals
and one assist. Finnegan had two goals and
three assists. Behind Finnegan and Tarr
were a number of strong efforts, with several players contributing goals and assists.
English was named to the Centennial
Conference Weekly Honor Roll for the
first time this year. English played well

Golf weathers
difficult conditions
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff
One of Swarthmore's more successful

teams is one you don't hear too much about.
The golf team has compiled a 10-5-1 record

this season.
Last week at Edgemont County Club,
Swarthmore played a competitive match
against Widener and Delaware Valley. Matt
Kaufman 'O2 shot a sparkling 76 to lead the
Garnet to a victory by thenarrowest of margins over Widener, a single shot over four
cumulative scores and and a totalof 72 holes
of play. Swarthmore shot a cumulataive 352,
while Widener put up a score of 353. Delaware Valley struggled to find the hole in the
gusting wind conditions, as three of their
scoring golfers shot in the triple digits.
JamesDolan 'O2 and Ben Wiles 'O3 contributed scores of 83 and 84, respectively. The
scores were particularly impressive when
one factors in the fact that the match was
played under conditions of heavy wind and
in a less than ideal temprature for golfing.
"We're looking pretty solid with some
fresh talent rising to the occasion and posting some low numbers on tough courses,"
said Dolan, who has perhaps been
Swarthmore's most consistent golfer this
season. "Last week, the windy conditions
yesterday gave us a home course advantage
we were able to capitalize on. The other
team [Delaware Valley] had only one score
in the double digits."
Kaufman, Wiles and Dolan all will have
excellent chances of placing in the Centennial Conference meet coming up on April
21 and 22 in Berlin, Md. With three strong
contenders, Swarthmore should do quite
well. Until then, the golfers have two more
matches to tune up, the Moravian Invitationaland a match against rival Haverford
with Widener joining the fray once again.

inside the ming of Steve Farneth
By Scott Kushner

Phoenix Staff

Sneaky and cunning, the best pitchers
in baseball aren't always the guys bringing Randy Johnson heat. Steve Farneth is
Swarthmore's ace, using a combination of
a sneaky fastball in the low-to-mid 80s and
tantalizing breaking material to
deconstruct hitters.
The formula for the Garnet baseball
team has been fairly simple this season:
when Farneth pitches, the team has a
chance. Farneth has started all but one of
Swarthmore's wins this season. Despite an
often shaky defense behind him, Farneth
has compiled a 2.87 ERA and a 4-4 record.
So what makes the "Banger," as
Farneth's teammates call him, tick? The
Phoenix sent Scott Kushner to take a more
candid look at this.

I

;

SK: What goes through your head just
before you pitch?
SF: I get really nervous. I feel a lot of
pressure: I feel like we have to win every
game I pitch. I try to relax by thinking
about particular pitches I've thrown that
have stuck with me, pitches that I threw
in important situations exactly how I
wanted to throw them.
I usually spend an hour or so after each
game thinking back over the game and
kind of cataloging those types of pitches
so they're available in situations where
sense-memory is valuable. I really believe
that pitching is 85 percent mental. When
you've trained your body enough to do
something, all you really have to do is
thinkabout doing it, and your body somehow executes. I spent years training myself physically to throw fastballs on the
outside corner of the plate. Now all I have
to do is think about throwing the ball there,
and it just happens
naturally.
SK: Where are you from, Steve?
SF: Wilmington, Del. I was born in Minneapolis and lived there until I was five
or so when my Dad got a job with DuPont.
I also lived briefly in San Francisco, where
I was the only white kid in a Chinatown
pre-school. They only spoke Chinese.

SK: As an athlete, who do you look up
to?
SF: Mike Schmidt. The thing about
Michael Jordan is that he's not human.
He's a God not worth talking about in the
context of other professional athletes. In
fact, he is the Unmentionable One. Rolen,
Glanville, Allen Iverson, Dave Giles '98.1
like Hershiser and Maddux, too. I really
learned a lot studying their approaches to

pitching.

SK: If you could have dinner with any 3

people, who would it be?
SF: Nicole Kidman, Bunny Lebowski,
Alyssa Milano. Beck's "Debra" is playing
softly in the background.
SK: Excluding attractive women, who
would the three be?
SF: David Mamet, Al Pacino, Pauline
Kael. Schmitty is beyond eating with mortals. Maybe he doesn't even have to eat.
SK: So what do you do in your free-time?
SF: Nap. Beirut. Watching movies. Listening to tunes (loud guitars).
SK: What do you consider your great-

est athletic acheivement?

SF: I pitched a no-hitter against
Haverford my freshman year. Our team
just was horrendous that year. It was only
my second win of the season, but since it
came against Haverford on the last day
of the season, it somehow validated everything. I know it was the first no-hitter in
the history of the Centennial Conference,
and as far as I know, there hasn't been one
since.
SK: What's a personal saying or quote
that you live by?
SF: I have the final Calvin and Hobbes
comic strip framed and hanging on my
wall. It snowed the night before and Calvin
and Hobbes are out admiring the way the
snow makes everything familiar disappear. The last line of the strip is "Let's go
exploring." I think that's a pretty good
quote. I buy into the anything-in-moderation approach. It's a good time of life to
explore, go out on a limb.
SK: What's your secret? You've been
unhittable at times over the past few
years.
SF: My pitching philosophy is "Throw
pitches that look like strikes."
SK: What is something you are best
known for?
SF: I don't know. I guess if somebody
was talking about me to somebody who
didn't know me, they'd describe me as a
pitcher for the baseball team. So I guess
that's what I'm best known for, but that
doesn't really get a guy too well known
around Swarthmore. People whoknow me
well know that I take writing pretty seriously. Playwriting and short stories.
I bet people who watch me pitch think
I'm arrogant or a baby. I hope I don't come
off that way all the time, although somebody told me that I have a very distinct,
full-of-myself walk. A professor's walk.
I'm convinced it's a baseball walk though,
carefully executed to make myself look
like a bad-ass when I'm walking out on the
field.
SK: Any pregame rituals or good luck

charms?
SF: I will say, at the risk of annoying
every women's coach in the athletic department, that I'm generally against
pre-game play. Bad for the legs. I almost always listen to Led Zeppelin
before I come down to the
fieldhouse on days that I'm pitching —"Kashmir" or "When the
Levee Breaks." Maybe this is
somehow related to not getting play the night before,
a replacement. Because
everybody knows,
when you're making
out, always put on
Zeppelin 4.
Oh, I always
eat Pino's on
game days.
And I'm still
wearing my
hat
from
freshman
year.
SK: Scooby
Doo or Scrappy
Doo?
SF:
Scooby
Scrappy is the annoying
guy you just want to beat
the
is
Scooby
George
Rosenbaum [Swarthmore's utility
infielder] of Doos. Chill. Tripping out on Scooby snacks.
SK: If you could have
three wishes, what would
they be?
SF: 1. The Mike
Mullan Baseball
Center. It has dugouts. It has a pitching machine. It has
an outfield fence. It
has a tarp over thf
backstop so outfiek
ers can see the ball
It may even have
level ground.
2.1 would like
jflMflHl
to meet my
grandparents
when they were my age. There are a lot
of things about me, and people in general,
that we have no control over. Years before
I was born, I wonder if I could be anticipated in my grandparents. They all lived
really interesting lives and were young
during a really interesting time.
3. I'd like to be able to look back over
my life at seventy and not regret the major decisions I've made.
A close fourth: Jimi Hendrix never died.

Baseball struggles, loses three in tough week

The Swarthmore baseball

dropping three conference

runs. Only two of those were
earned, however, a testament to
the Garnet's poor fielding.
Swarthmore also wasted a 3-for-4 day from catcher Josh Lindsey
'OO, who added two RBI and is
clearly breaking out of his early
season slump.
A cold, rainy Saturday turned
out to be a tough one for the
Swarthmore pitching staff. The
second game was postponed due
to showers and a wet field, but
in the first, Western Maryland's

"The upcoming weeks are going to be tough if we don't hit

Swarthmore hopes to bounce

CAYLEY PENDERGRASS | Phoenix Staff

A determined women's rugby captain Rhiana Swartz drives through Franklin and Marshall defenders Saturday. Both the A-side and B-side won.

62-0: Rugby dominates F&M
By Payal Shah, Shannon McGrael
and Joanne Jacobson
For The Phoenix
With a double shutout against Franklin
Marshall on Saturday, the women's
rugby team showed them that theirbrains
were not the only muscles that they could
flex. A-side massacred Franklin and
Marshall with a score of 62-0. Ten tries
were scored in the game.
The first try scored was a combined
pack effort by Meghan Brennan 'OO, Elizabeth Meehan 'Ol, and Alexa Miller 'OO.
They brought the ball into the try zone
with the forwards' muscles, driving back
the ineffectual mass of F&M girls.
Meredith Hegg 'OO touched the ball down
to score the try. This first try was followed
by an astonishing nine others. Danielle
D'Olivera 'OO was the highest scorer. "Her
hands were solid and she saw all the holes
to score three times," said Abigail
&

Stewart-Teitelbaum 'Ol.
Noelle Gooden 'Ol showed her skills as
fly-half by scoring two amazing runs.
Other tries were scored by StewartTeitelbaum, Miller, Meehan, and Emily
Sigalow 'O2.
"Lots of people will look at that score
and just assume that F&M was a terrible
team," said team captain Rhiana Swartz
'OO. "But they really weren't. We just
played our game consistently. Everyone
of the tries was hard earned."
Emily Wilkins 'Ol played a strong game
as fullback, successfully come through for
the team as the last line of defense. Joanne
Jacobson 'O3 stepped up in her first in-season A-side game. "Defensively, she made
every single tackle," said Hegg. "It's great
to watch her develop as a player, and I
know that she will be a strong leader on
the team in the future."
The forward pack dominated the field,
easily pushing backF&M's players. Taina

Guarda 'O2 devastated the other team by
stealing two thirds of their put-ins in the
scrums.
B-side continued their winning streak
by edging out F&M's second team 7-5.
Combining her speed and strong hands,
Esther Kim 'O3 scored her first try. Her
try was followed by a conversion by Sara
Cole 'O3 that won the game. The overwhelming force of the B-side scrums
caused the referee to rule the scrums uncontested in order to ensure the safety of
the opposing team. Jennifer Kim 'OO had
amazing runs, blasting through F&M's
defense. Daniele Holt-Lyman 'O3 and Julie
George'O2 worked well together as flankers, continually being the first ones there
to get the tackles.
"I've never seen Swarthmore rugby
play as a team like this before," said coach
Alan Matas of both matches. "The team
really is one cohesive unit working toward
one goal."

together and the distinguishing characteristics between schools drift towards the
absurd and unimportant. Because I'm an
obsessive sort of person who enjoys a set
pattern in life, I tend to notice the showers.
After a long, hard game, a shower provides closure. At least that's what I always
hope for. It is very rare that the shower
facilities live up to anyone's standards,let
alone my own. Here are the scouting reports on what to look out for:
THE shower: Usually frightens the
rookie and is very large and intimidating.
It consists of a very large room tiled in
some shade of beige. There is one drain
in the middle and about 50 showerheads
around the exterior—but only one works.
The towel rack is approximately 25 feet
away from the shower area. It is the ultimate in industrial sort of construction and
lends to the industrial approach of large
schools to athletics. Never well lit.
The showerl: Variation on the aforementioned. Also tiled in beige
sometimes
with a white border. About four shower
heads, all of which work. No hot water.
Usually has some sort of waiting area or
foyer where the long line forms. (Note:
usually found after particularly exhausting games played in the driving rain).
The middle school: Called this because it
seems that it was originally built for
middle-schoolers. Showerheads are found
somewhere between waist to chest height.
A training room visit afterwards is necessary to ice the sore neck. Be prepared to
sacrifice washing the hair; residue never
fully rinses out. Best for basketball teams
and/or the non-vertically challenged.
Solitary confinement: Individual shower
stalls with curtains- found in numbers between 25 and 50. Each stall has its own
changing area, complete with matching
curtain. Water pressure is nonexistent
the trickle effect. Temperature tends to
fluctuate, depending on how one's neighbor is dealing with his or her own temperature problems.
Rainforest: Water is between scalding
and boiling
resulting burns range from
second to third degree. Showerheads emit
a scalding mist rather than a spray. Don't
look in the corners
mildew is rampant.
Soup: One drain in center, 4-inch lip prevents overflow. Drain is generally entirely
clogged with hair. The "soup" is dirty gray
to black, mixed with various soap slivers.
Often found in conjunction with "the
middle school."
Partitions: variation of "THE shower."
Large room with seven or eight center
posts with four showerheads each. Off of
each post are four partitions, giving the
impression of privacy.
Something for everyone: Has four to six
individual shower stalls like the "solitary
confinement." Only half of these work, and
are almost completely in the dark. Watch
out for foot fungus. The other part of the
shower area is a combination of "the
shower?" and "Partitions." Tile is always
uneven- be prepared for odd pools of dirty
water. Turning on a shower for yourself may
result in third degree burnsfor a teammate.
Don't ask where the Swat showers fall,
but know that there are reasons why a
number of "teams prefer to avoid the
fieldhouse after practice.
