Housing crunch to send juniors to Strath Haven
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Juniors returning from study abroad this spring may
end up living in doubles and triples in Strath Haven.
Since an unusually small number of students will be
studying abroad or going on leave next semester, on-campus housing will be insufficient to accommodate the 120
students who will be returning and seeking housing in the
upcoming December housing lottery.
As a result, the housing committee agreed to open all
the rooms the college keeps as emergency overflow housing
in Strath Haven, which is a block away from Mary Lyon,
for the December lottery.
"With everything that has been going on in the world,
it's very understandable that fewer people are going
abroad and that Strath Haven has to be opened," housing
committee member Jesse Taylor 'O3 said.
It appears that the events of Sept. 11 and the contin-

ued uncertain international situation have defied the
trend that leads more students to go abroad in the spring
than in the fall. Most years, the college counts on this
pattern to ease housing crunches in the spring, even in
years when housing is tight in the fall, as happened this

year.
The committee, chaired by Assistant Dean of
Residential Life Myrt Westphal, made the decision to open
Strath Haven at its last meeting, on Oct. 27. Bryan Byrnes
'O2 was selected as the Strath Haven RA.
Since most juniors live in single spaces, the housing
committee is trying to find ways to open more singles in
dorms for returning students. The proposal before the
deans would force sophomores living alone in rooms that
are doubles otherwise referred to as orphans to move
in with other sophomores in a similar situation, leaving
rooms vacant for returning upperclassmen.
"Filling up doubles with sophomores makes a lot
more sense than forcing juniors into doubles," Taylor

said.
The last time the college placed students in Strath
Haven was during the 1999-2000 academic year, when a
very large senior class caused a housing crunch for the
other classes. Of the 27 students who lived in Strath
Haven in the spring of 2000, most were sophomores,
four were juniors and, including the RA, two were seniors.
At least 27 students are likely to live in Strath Haven

there her sophomore year. "It
had its good points and its bad points," she said. "I did
appreciate the free parking and the free laundry." But she
disliked the fact that there was no dorm life.
While living in Strath Haven, Friedman said, it was
essential to make an effort to stay connected to campus

life. "No one ever goes to visit you in Strath Haven," she
said. "It's very easy to slip through the cracks and have
almost no social contact all year."
The apartments in Strath Haven cannot access the college computer network. In the past, Taylor said, the coUege
has provided students living in Strath Haven with keys to
ML to so they can use computers there.

College to add professor of Islam to faculty
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
After a 10-year effort from the religion
department to secure a tenure-track post
for teaching Islam, the college has pushed
forward the hiring of the new position in
response to the Sept. 11 attacks.
"It's been an ongoing push for the
department since the Gulf War in 1991,"
said Scott Kugle '9l, a post-doctoral Mellon
fellow who the college hired to teach Islam
two years ago in place of a permanent professor. "It's kind of sad that these efforts
are always punctuated by wars, but that's
the way breakthroughs are made."
The first proposal for a professor of
Islam came about a decade ago, when the
religion department made a proposal to the
provost, said Don Swearer, a religion professor. In response, the provost approached
a national fund, the Henry Luce

Foundation, to

try to gain funding for the
appointment of a long-term visiting professor who the college could later appoint to a
Permanent position.
"It is quite expensive to put new lines
on the tenure track," Provost Connie

Hungerford said.
The
Luce

foundation

denied

Swarthmore's application. "In the meantime, to ensure that there was some teach-

ing of Islam, we had two Mellon fellows,"
religion department chair Jerry Frost said.

Kugle, who is the second Mellon fellow
to teach Islam at Swarthmore, said the
Mellon foundation was "designed for young
scholars
to be at a liberal arts institution
that stresses undergraduate education and
helps broaden the curriculum."
In this way, the

committee, which Steven Hopkins chaired,
hoped for a candidate who would have had
classical training but would also be capable
of teaching modern about religious topics.

1998 and decided funding should come from

Hungerford said, though he or she "isn't

Although the college does not have
"enough components to create a program
out of the courses we have," she said, there
are a number of faculty with specialties in

Islamic civilization that could form the
basis of such a program eventually.
Kugle's role in addressing the need for
an Islam curriculum began when he was a
Swarthmore student in the early 19905.
"There was a conversation then about
how it was a lack in the college in general
and in the religion curriculum in particular," he said. Ten years ago, he explained,
Islamic studies were limited to "a couple of
courses in the religion department," which
visiting professors taught.

Students formed a Middle East Studies
group, and, to further his study of Islam
beyond the Swarthmore sphere, Kugle spent
nine months in Cairo and studied Arabic at
Penn during his undergraduate years.

professor who teaches about Islam. But

Decreasing loans,
increasing grants
BY BETH REDDEN
A recent trend to decrease the amount of loans offered
in financial aid packages in favor of larger scholarship
grants has become increasingly popular among many of
the nation's most competitive schools, Director of
Financial Aid Laura Talbot said. Swarthmore's longstanding policy of keeping the loan components of financial aid packages "as low as possible," she said, has
become widely practiced in recent years, as several of
Swarthmore's peer institutions, including Amherst,
Williams, Stanford and Princeton, have either reduced or

eliminated the loan

portions of their financial aid packages.
At
$14,990,

ble to that of many of
the schools that "share our applicant pool," Talbot said.
Expected loan totals for the members of the class of 2005 at
Williams and Amherst, for example, are $14,000, and
Stanford's expected total is $16,000.
Princeton, however, took the policy of reducing loans
to an unprecedented level last January when it eliminated all of its loans in favor of grants.
Britta Ingebretson 'O5 said she would support a similar
movement by the Swarthmore administration, as replacing loans with grants would prevent students from being
burdened by thousands of dollars in student loans upon
graduation. "Ideally, it would be nice if loans were
replaced by grants," she said. "Swarthmore has such a
large endowment, it might be able to do that without too
much trouble."

Swarthmore music professor John Alston leads the Chester Children's Chorus in Lang Music Building.

'Heavenly hosts

The members of the Chester Children's Chorus training
choir, most of them between the ages of seven and nine,
begin a rendition of "Silent Night," their eyes glued to
Alston, who guides them with his hands and his voice.
It is Saturday morning, and they are rehearsing for the
three Christmas performances they will give in December.

rus.

They are still learning the ropes. "Don't spit the 't;' just
say it," says Alston, chair of the college's music department. At one point during the rehearsal, the children
break out into a spontaneous version of "We Are the
World," while Alston shakes his head and laughs.
On the whole, however, the young singers display composure unusual among elementary school students. After
they finish "Silent Night," they rise from their chairs, bow

in unison and file out of the classroom in Lang Music
Building. Two remain for one-on-one music lessons

Swarthmore students teach them clarinet and trumpet
while others wait for a ride from a program volunteer back

The Chester Children's Chorus began in 1994 with funding from the now-dormant Chester-Swarthmore College
Community Coalition, an initiative to deepen the relationship between the college and Chester, an economically
depressed city three miles from Swarthmore.
That first year, Alston recruited seven boys for a halfday summer program. "They just came and rehearsed for

an hour and then played a little baseball," Alston said of
the original group. Back then, there was no money for
snacks or outings.
The group has since received an anonymous donation
of $50,000 and a grant from the William Penn Foundation
in Philadelphia. The college contributes rehearsal space,
payroll and accounting services, insurance and other
forms of non-monetary support.
The chorus mushroomed as Alston appeared in
Chester elementary schools every two years to recruit
more potential musicians. It grew to involve siblings, and
when some of the boys' sisters began to attend chorus
activities three years ago, the group became co-educational.
The chorus now meets once a week, with the olderkids
rehearsing after the training choir. Afterwards, Alston
drives the children to his house, where they eat lunch and
then spend the afternoon having fun. Some of the older
members of the choir like to lift weights in the gym in
Alston's basement while the younger ones play sports or
goof around.
"This is my longest day all week," Alston said. He
wakes up at 8:30 a.m. to rent the van he uses to transport
the children, and he typically drives them home at 4:30
p.m.

Alston's involvement with the kids does not end here.

Talbot stressed that Swarthmore's endowment is actually much smaller than that of Princeton, which totals $8
billion. Though "manageable debt levels are our goal,"
Talbot said, college budgetary constraints must be considered when formulating loan policies.
About 50 percent of Swarthmore students receive
financial aid. Seventy percent of these students are
receiving loans as part of their packages, Talbot said.
The only packages offered that do not include loans are
those available through the Swarthmore, Lang, Evans,
and national and regional McCabe scholarships. Of these,
only the regional McCabe scholarship, available to students from Delaware County, Pa. and the Delmarva
Peninsula, is based solely on merit, without regard to

need.
For the class of 2002, Talbot said, the first $1,450 of
demonstrated need is covered through a campus job

opportunity. After that, the next $2,625 to $5,500 of demonstrated need, depending on the class year, is met through
loans.
A senior who has received a typical financial aid package over the last four years will have borrowed $15,480 by
the end of his or her four years, for which the monthly
payment will eventually be about $l7O per month. Firstyear students can expect to borrow about $14,990 over four
years, slightly less than the amount the senior class will

have borrowed.
The only students whose loans are funded by the
Swarthmore College Loan Program are those who are
ineligible for federal aid, Talbot said. This includes international students and those who are not registered for the
Selective Service. All other loans are provided through
the federal Stafford or the federal Perkins Loan
Programs.
Pete Mohanty 'O5

said these subsidized loan programs
are beneficial to students because "you get a much better
deal than if you go to a private bank." His only complaint
is that everyone should be able to get such subsidized
loans, regardless of financial aid status. "But that's not
Swarthmore's fault, of course," he added. "It's a federal

program."
Although the school can do little to alter federal financial aid policy, Talbot said that the administration has
always worked to keep the loan portion of debts manageable in order to make life easier for students after graduation. "We don't want a decision about major or career to
be adversely influenced by the student's worry about debt
repayment," she said.

Civil rights leader remembers
Congressman John Lewis shares memories of U.S. civil rights movement
BY JARED LENOW
"As a young child, I tasted the bitter fruits of racism and
segregation," Congressman John Lewis (D-Ga.) said to a
packed audience in Lang Concert Hall Friday. A pivotal figure in the civil rights movement, Lewis recounted incidents
in his childhood when
he was denied a library
card because he was
black and was not considered for admission by
a local college for the
same reason.

"It was a good intro to the history of the movement, but
I was sort of hoping that he would talk more about current
events," Jesse O'Brien 'O3 said. "I liked it, but I thought his
responses to the question-and-answers were more interesting. I would have liked more time for that."
Lewis was one of the most influential civil rights leaders
of his time. He participated in the first organized sit-ins at
segregated lunch counters and in the "freedom rides" of
1961, which tested state compliance with a federal order to
desegregate interstate bus stops and for which he was brutally beaten. Lewis spoke at the March on Washington in
1963 and also served as the Chairman of the Student NonViolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) from 1963 to 1966,
an organization whose members served as the young shock
troops of the movement, organizing grassroots sit-in campaigns and voter registration drives.
Lewis is currently in his eighth consecutive term as congressional representative for Georgia's Fifth Congressional
District, which includes the city of Atlanta, and considers
his foremost political goal to be the

that is really encouraging, and it's a lesson all of us can

Lewis spoke to a crowd of approximately 300 last Friday
in Lang Concert Hall about his experiences as one of the
most prominent leaders of the American civil rights movement. A number of contemporary issues also came up during the question and answer session following the talk,
including the war in Afghanistan, convicted felons' civil liberties and the suspension of federal student aid for drug
offenders. The event was followed by a reception and book
signing for Lewis' 1998 memoir, "Walking with the Wind: A

was "going to die."
Lewis ended his speech as he began it, speaking of how
much the civil rights movement had profoundly changed
American society. He recalled that last year, on the 35th
anniversary of "Bloody Sunday," he walked across the
bridge over the Alabama river where the marchers had
been chased down and beaten, and on the other side of the
bridge saw a number of Alabama state troopers, male and
female, black, white, Asian and Hispanic. The governor
approached him, extended his hand and said, "Welcome

"When I was arrested, I
felt liberated, I felt free.
Never again would I obey
segregated customs,
regulations or laws."
John Lewis

He began his speech lightheartedly, joking about growing up the
son of sharecroppers on a farm outside Troy, Alabama, but he quickly
became serious when he began discussing the movement.
After describing his rejection by
a librarian who told him only
whites could have library cards,
Lewis spoke of returning to the
same library in 1998, when he saw hundreds of men, women
and children of various races standing in line together.
Lewis recounted his first acts of civil disobedience during
sit-ins at segregated downtown Nashville lunch counters in
1960 and his subsequent arrest.
"When I was arrested, I felt liberated, I felt free," he said.
"Never again would I obey segregated customs, regulations

or laws."

Lewis spoke of being beaten by white mobs during the
freedom rides, speaking at the March on Washington, working on the Freedom Summer project, in which students
from across the country traveled to Mississippi to help register black voters, and the infamous "Bloody Sunday," when
Alabama state troopers ran down a peaceful protest march
traveling from Selma to Montgomery with nightsticks, bullwhips and horses. During this march, Lewis was clubbed on
the left side of his head with a nightstick and thought he

considered.
"We've come to that point
where we can no longer use war
and violence as a tool of our foreign policy," he said. He later added, "There must be a bet-

ter way."

He also stated his opposition to laws that take away a
convicted felon's right to vote, expressed his support for
campaign finance reform, and said he disagreed with a
recent change in federal student loan guidelines, which
would not allow students who had any prior drug conviction to receive federal funds.

The steps of Parrish were decorated
with an impressive display of red, white

that, before the attacks on Sept. 11, people

"these freedoms have come at a price" and
is an important venue for honoring those

The rally provided those in attendance

and voice support for

the current American conflict. Organized
in honor of Veterans Day, it featured a
group of scheduled speakers and an open

audience were invited to come to the podium to speak.
Matt Rubin 'O3, president of the College
Republicans and the first speaker at the
event, introduced the rally as a chance for
students, faculty, veterans and members of
the community to speak as Americans and
not within established party lines. Rubin
said he felt that the "atmosphere on campus
has tried to quiet" support for the war
effort and offered the event as an opportunity for people "who do support the country
and do support its current actions to
express that." In addition, Rubin argued for

Cumby briefly described his experience
during the Vietnam War, when he served
in the Army Reserves while opposing the
United States' involvement. Despite an
overwhelming fear that his eldest son, a
senior at Bowdoin College, might be drafted, Cumby supports the current war efforts
and views the campaign against terrorism

as necessary.
"We have to, as a country, as the freedom loving people around the world, do
whatever it takes to defeat these forces of
terror," Cumby said. "To do anything else
would be unthinkable."
Sarah Donovan 'O4 then expressed the
need for the country to "reevaluate what
we want to be as America and who we want
to be as Americans." She admitted she

But the Stars and Stripes hasn't always enjoyed such an implacable status atop the college's main building. The flag has peered over the
Swarthmore campus for just the past six years, following a 20-year plus hiatus after it was removed for unidentified reasons in the '6os, according to
the Friends Historical Library. Before that, the flag had not been displayed
atop Parrish since the Spanish-American War, though it was raised and
lowered every morning at the college field house.
And the battle that ensued when members of the Swarthmore
Conservative Union (a now-defunct group equivalent to today's College
Republicans) planned a referendum on whether the flag should fly over
Parrish demonstrated the student body's diverse views on the country in
which their college is located.
Michael Murphy '95,
Those who originally organized the referendum
Mark Hansen '94 and Keelyn Bradley '95, all of them members of SCU
first petitioned for the flag's raising during the spring of 1994. When protests
emerged from those who called Old Glory a symbol of oppression and
exploitation, they demanded a referendum. Matthew Schenk '95, also a
member of SCU, said it always seemed odd to him that the flag was missing
from the top of Parrish.
"To continue to not have an American flag on campus raised a lot of
questions as to why it wasn't there," said Schenk. "It's a good symbol for
everything America stands for, for belief, for freedom of expression."
He added that the controversy came at a time when the college was calling for a more diverse ideological voice, and conservatism at the college
was finally on the rise.
"While many students didn't agree with our politics, they agreed that
there was a need for more diversity of political opinion," Schenk said. "I
think a lot of people at Swarthmore take for granted that they get all the
benefits that America has, but they don't appreciate them."
President of the college Al Bloom repeatedly made it clear he was in
favor of flying the flag then. "Certainly, at the time, those who were opposing to putting the flag on top of Parrish saw in it a symbol of exploitation of
other nations," he said. "Those in favor saw it as a symbol of democracy, of
a nation that had achieved a relative amount of unity."
The final vote, which took place on Sept. 26,1994, indicated that 376 students
61 percent of voters
were in favor of raising the flag, with 239, or
39 percent, voting against the measure. What's important, Bloom said, is
that the college to this day places no specific symbolism to the flag, merely
displaying it as the students wished. "Each member of the community will
make his or her interpretation of that national symbol," he said.
Some claimed that the United States' mistreatment of countries in South
America
such as Nicaragua and Colombia warranted the college putting those nation's flags atop Parrish as well. Ultimately, Bloom said the
"lively debates" that took place satisfied what he believes is the ultimate
goal of the college: "to be a community of various voices."

And, make no doubt about it,
people, it is a war."
Gruler went on to convey to
the crowd the last words of several of the victims of the attacks
of Sept. 11, who he said "understood more clearly than we"
what was going on. "Their lives
were used as a tool for a bunch
of murderers with an objective,"
Gruler said. He finished by
reminding the crowd that the
rights Americans enjoy were
not just given to them but
instead were fought and won by
America's veterans.
Carlton Davis 'O4, who spoke
next, confirmed his support
behind the government in its
current wars against the economy, domestic and international
terrorism
urged
and
the
Swarthmore community to do
the same. "I think now, more
than ever, it is important for us

to unite behind our troops and
what they are fighting for,"
Davis said. "They are fighting

for our freedom."

The
next speaker, Dan
Kraus, an area firefighter,
offered similar sentiments.
"Today, supporting American
troops is not the Republican
thing to do, it's the American
thing to do," he said. He went on
to express thanks for the sacrifices made by rescue workers
and said that as long as
Americans
continue their

return to normalcy, they tell terrorists that they will not win

over our freedom. He made it

clear, however, that "in that
return to normalcy we must not
forget what happened."
The final scheduled speaker

of the afternoon was Dave
Thomas 'O2, who recalled the
meaning of the veteran exempli-

fied in the actions of his grandfather, spoke of a heartfelt admiration for those who are willing
to "give up everything for that
in which they believe."
"To me there is no greater
love than that of our veterans
who served our country,"
Thomas said. In addition, he
pointed out that without veterans, Americans would not have
a country to protest for or
against, and the irony that,
without war, the very right to
protest,
many
which so

Americans take for granted,
would not exist in America.

Following Thomas, members

of the audience approached the

podium and offered their
thoughts to the group. A majority of the open mike participants
expressed views similar to those
of the speakers, with the exception of two speakers who ques-

tioned the governments' actions
during the current crisis. The
supporters
called
on the
Swarthmore and American
communities to support the government and troops in the
United States' current military
conflict and to recognize and
respect the contributions veterans made in previous wars.
"Peace is not just the absence
of conflict. It also has to be the
presence of justice," Joon Suk
Choi 'O2 said. "And for us to say,
'We're not going to attack you'
just for the sake of not having
conflict doesn't solve anything,
will not prevent future attacks,
and would be an insult on those
who have already been tragically affected by these attacks."
Open
mike participant
Randy Goldstein 'O5 said, "If we
fail to destroy terrorism, terrorists will succeed in their vow to
destroy us." He added that protestors of the war effort in the
United States "encourage terrorist efforts and put the United
States at risk."

Islamic studies hire may shape program
From ISLAM, pg. 3
history courses on Muslim-Christian relations and

the formation of the Islamic Near East are offered

by a tenured professor, Stephen Bensch. A new
tenure-track professor in the French section of the
Modern Languages and Literatures department,
Bernoussi Saltani, specializes in the literature of
Francophone North Africa.
In addition, the college has brought an outside
professor, John Turner, to teach a special history
course on the modern Middle East for one semester
only this spring. And Michael Sells, a religion professor at Haverford, specializes in Islam, as well
(see related story, pg. 8).

"That's pretty amazing, considering that a few

years ago there was nobody except Professor
Bensch," Kugle said. "So the future looks pretty

bright."

"There are people here who could, if they had
the interest, form the nucleus of a program,"
Swearer said.
Special interdisciplinary programs such as
women's studies, black studies and Francophone
studies arise "when faculty are interested in estab-

lishing [them]," Hungerford said. The possible formation of an interdisciplinary program in Islamic
studies, which Kugle said would probably draw
from the religion, history, and sociology and
anthropology departments, would most likely
depend on the interest ofrelevant professors.
"You've got sources here, and how they develop
depends on the personnel," Frost said. "Faculty
members create interdisciplinary [programs]

because there's student interest or because they
have a deep interest in it."
As for teaching Arabic, "the idea of having any
formal program is a ways away," Kugle said,

because "teaching any kind of modern language at
Swarthmore is very difficult." But because of the
new appointment of Professor Saltani, who is
Moroccan and speaks both Arabic and French,
there is the possibility of implementing some kind
of informal Arabic language presence into campus
life, Kugle said. He described the president's decision to quicken the hiring of a tenure-track Islam
professor as "a wonderful decision that's the result
of a long effort on the part of many departments,
but especially the religion department, and many
administrators who realized this was important."

College to launch environmental
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
Does studying the growth and development of street life in a West African nation
fascinate you? How about learning more
about adolescent reproductive health as
seen through the eyes of a developing
African country?
In the new Environmental Studies in
Ghana program announced last Thursday,
juniors will have the opportunity to learn
this and more studying abroad during the
spring semester at the University of Legon
in Ghana.
"The point of this program," said Carr
Everbach, the acting chair of the environmental studies committee and an engineering professor, "is to allow students to spend
January to May of their junior years in
Ghana studying environmental problems
through advanced research projects."
The program is unique, he said, because
it does not focus solely on environmental
issues. Students with interests and back-

ground in subjects like natural sciences,
economics and political science will have
the opportunity to participate in it.
According to Everbach, any student with a
research proposal that fits the guidelines
would be eligible for the program.
Swarthmore plans to offer this program

program in Ghana

beginning in the spring of 2003. It is participating with Macalester, Middlebury and
Pomona, which developed the program in
conjunction with Swarthmore. During the

first year, the environmental sciences committee will select four Swarthmore students to participate. If too many qualified
students apply, it is possible that the committee will conduct a lottery. According to
Everbach, this number will eventually
increase to eight.
"It won't just be taking classes at the
university," Everbach said. "Students will
pick a research project and work one-onone with a mentor. It is an attempt to get
students to understand a developing nation
and get them to do work that might aid in

its development."
During their time in Ghana, students
will be exposed to work that Everbach
called "as rigorous as that at Swarthmore
and equal in intellectual content." While in
Ghana and again upon their return to
Swarthmore, students are expected to present a 35- to 50-page paper detailing their
research project.
Akosua Adomako Ampofo, who is handling this program in Ghana, explained
more about the research projects. "Projects
will be Ghanaian," she said, "but will also
focus on global and regional concerns."

Once the students arrive in Ghana, they
will be required to take an introductory

language course in an indigenous language
suggested by their mentor. Most students
will study Twi, but some may study Ga or
Fante.
Over the first month, they will also
involve themselves in case studies relevant
to their research topics, Ampofo said. By
the end of the first month the focus will
change from classroom learning to field
studies and intense research.

Overall, students and the environmen-

tal studies committee are very pleased
with the project. Nadav Tanners 'O2, who
has a concentration in environmental
studies, participated in a similar project in
Ecuador last year. "A program like this
really helps to show how developing countries deal with economic concerns," he
said. "For example, while we're concerned
with the destruction of the rainforest on an
environmental level, in Ecuador, people
are cutting them down because there is no
land anywhere else. It's very interesting to
see the difference between indigenous cultures and Western and European cultures."
Everbach urges interested students to

Speaker describes revitalizing poor communities
BY CATHY DANH
The problem with progressive politics, Paul
Osterman thinks, is that "people just don't like government." A major reason, he believes, is that "inequality
has grown spectacularly" over the years, causing a
major divide between the classes.
Osterman spoke to an audience of students and professors of economics about the International Areas
Foundation (lAF) for the annual Frank Pearson '34 lecture
last Thursday, Nov. 8.
The lAF is "the best thing going in terms of progressive
politics," said Osterman, who worked for the IFA for six
years after evaluating the organization for another job.
Thoroughly impressed with their work, he has been "committed and attached" to the organization ever since.
Decreasing voter turnout in recent elections is a sign
that politics does not offer universal appeal to the masses,
said Osterman, whose talk was entitled "Justice in LowWage Communities."
He pointed to the correlation between voter turnout
and income distribution as an especially disturbing trend.
"The higher income bracket are those most likely to
vote," Osterman said. "Policies meant for the general public are being voted for by only a small portion of the population." This creates a problem because, the needs of the

rich are different from the needs of the poor.
The "Washington-centric" way of combating voter
apathy is by increasing the information that the public
receives, Osterman said. Through commercials, mail-

ings, and advertising, Washington hopes to encourage
more people to cast their vote. Osterman feels this
approach is misdirected because it "does not mobilize
the people."
teaching people
The answer is to "organize locally
how to do politics," he said. "Approaching the problem at
the local level is key".
Enter the lAF.
The lAF is an "organization of organizations,"
Osterman said. It comes to institution-based establishments, such as churches and schools, that are located in
economically disadvantaged communities and mobilizes
the communities politically and socially.
"Institutions invite the lAF to come to their site for
an initial meeting," Osterman said. "After agreeing to
the terms of the lAF, the institution then chooses to
either join or not join the lAF. If they choose to join, the
...

institution is then affiliated with lAF."
After officially joining, paid organizers from lAF begin
working on empowering the people at the particular institution. lAF "teaches politics, agency, and how to be powerful," he said.

The unique philosophy of the lAF is "power before
program." This is achieved through "relational organizing
building strong relationships and trust before
turning to issues."
This way, "long after the issue of the moment has
faded" the genuine bond between the people will keep
the momentum of the organization going, he said.
Another key component of the lAF is building leaders.
"The central goal is to identify people who are leaders and
to raise them up," said Osterman. "These individuals are
constantly trained, constantly educated, constantly built
up."
Ideally, these individuals will be identifying the
problems within their community and working to find
the answers to the problems through politicization and

socialization.

To build up the people within the community, lAF
offers intense job training and "works with the business
community to coordinate training as well as to obtain
pledges of jobs for those who have completed training,"

Osterman said.

lAF also works on a "living wage" campaign to guarantee that those who are working will have an income that
supports their families.
The chief model Osterman cited was the Valley
Interfaith Church, located in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley. Valley Interfaith has been part of the lAF since
1994.
In the community, 39 percent of the people were living
below poverty, and 40 percent working without health
insurance prior to the lAF's entrance.
Seven years later, the people of the community have
experienced a complete turnaround. "The leaders are cur-

rently working on job training, school reform, voter registration and living wage," Osterman said.
To emphasize the success of the lAF in the Rio
Grande Valley, he read testimonials of individuals who
directly benefited from the assistance of the lAF.
One leader at Valley Interfaith had said, "This organization has opened up our minds." Another Valley

Interfaith member had described the lAF as "transforming people's perceptions of who they are, what they can

do

"

...

The Rio Grande Valley saw a $5,000 to $B,OOO increase
in income after participating in the IFA program, and
the efforts of lAF raised 8,500 people's wages.
Economics professor Stephen Golub described the program as a "grassroots" effort.
"I found that kind of appealing," he said. But Golub was
not "convinced that this will have an overall effect in the
labor market." According to Golub, "you need programs
that are national in scope" to have a truly lasting impact.

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Paul Osterman spoke on "Justice in Low Wage Communities."
Philip Jefferson, also an economics professor, thought
Osterman's presentation was "a very good talk, because it
brought politics and economics together to address equality and empowerment."
Currently, the lAF is replicating its program throughout the Southwest and across the nation. "In order to
nationalize the lAF, we need to identify broader interests
and connect with institutions other than congregations,"

Osterman said.
Osterman earned his bachelor's degree at Oberlin
College and doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He has consulted for numerous organizations,
including the White House Domestic Council, and he was
a member of the Minimum Wage Council in 1980.
Osterman is currently a professor of urban studies and
planning at MIT.

WSRN to restructure board
Facing complaints of a lack of communication, WSRN,

Currently, SBC hires an engineer to maintain the station's

Michael Sells, a Haverford professor of religion, urged his audience members to be aware of the
ways in which they are affected by images the government and media produce.

Distortion of information in media
may give advantage to extremists
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER
How can we understand the Sept. 11 tragedies
and the anti-American sentiment that led to them?
According to Michael Sells, a Haverford religion
professor who spoke here last Thursday, we need
to mind how the portrayal of images, both in the
West and in the Middle East, can lead to mutual

misunderstanding.
"The major weapon of terrorist groups is the
image and the media," he said.
Sells explained how Osama bin Laden and
Taliban leaders influence Muslims to develop asso-

ciations among extremist groups, Islam, and antiAmerican sentiments using

the same techniques advertisers use to associate a
product with sex or wealth.
"They learned that if

their goal. That association
is: Islam equals Osama bin
Laden."
Sells warned that we
'

need to be careful of creat-

ing images that resonate in
the Islamic world in ways that can be manipulated
to the advantage of extremist groups. He advocated
paying attention to the issues in United States foreign policy raised by Osama bin Laden and the
Taliban, despite the fact that these issues are probably not the true motives behind their actions.
"One cannot manipulate something if it's not
there. If something can be manipulated, that's
exactly why it's relevant," he said.

Sells also discussed additional factors behind
the anti-American sentiment that leads people to

follow extremist leaders. He pointed out increasing
amounts of economic and cultural insecurity that
has resulted from globalization. "The sense that
traditional cultures of the world are being invaded
by something subtle and beyond their control is

devastating to communities," he said.
Sells defended his attempts to explain the factors behind terrorism. "People said, 'Don't explain
it. Nothing can justify it,' he said. "But explanations do not have to involve justifications. Without
explanations, there is no way to identify whom the
enemy [is]. If one makes mistakes there, that's
exactly how you cause polarization between the

THE PHOENIX

'Bring your light'

Sells claimed that the American tendency to
avoid explanation was a result of the way we have
been influenced by particular images of Islam. He
emphasized that the Islamic faith should not be seen
as a cause of terrorism or as a foreign, inaccessible
way of thinking. He did, however, point out fundamental differences between secular and religious
experiences, and he recommended that we consider
"what is it about religion that people find deep and
meaningful" to better understand the worldview of
an Islamic person in a more religious society.
Encouraging the audience to be aware of the
ways they are affected by images of world affairs
presented by our government and media, Sells said
he hoped that, as a result of

how WSRN is structured in order to allow for bigger budgeting

toward oil-producing states in the Middle East.
He compared a prospective rise in energy prices
to the deprivations Americans suffered during
World War 11. "This time, no one's asking any
Americans to sacrifice anything," he noted.
Sells's talk was widely attended by members of
the community, although there were few students
present. "I'm delighted they're doing this. More
people have to understand about Islam in general,"
said Shirley Loveless, a resident of Rose Valley. "I
thought the message of images was right on. We've
done a terrible job of countering the bad propaganda of the fundamentalists."

"It brought a perspective that is not often heard
in the west: that Islam isn't just the young man
with a shaking fist, but that it has meaning and
importance for people who believe in it," said John
Turner, a scholar of Islamic history.
"He said some things that needed to be said,"
Hanifa Abdul-Sabur 'O5 said. "What happened was
not about Islam. We need to educate ourselves and
be aware of the way we're influenced by images."

The Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature form a group
designed around contrariness. Participants in SWIL are not members -that's

"The main thing was that they were really friendly."

everyone else they're non-members. In order to become part of the group, one must be
"dismembered." They describe themselves as being "devoted to order and chaos." Meetings
begin with a call to disorder. Based solely on the number of activities they sponsor, they are
one of the most active campus groups, yet at the same time, they are said to be one of the
most reclusive. The most interesting aspect of this organization, in fact, is the dichotomy that
is not in the rulebook: that of its relationship to the campus.

are restless.

Saturday at lunch, SWIL participants
"the
gather in Sharpies for their weekly meeting.
After a ritual pounding of tables to represent anarchy, one of the three co-presidents, Abby Friedman 'O2,
rules with an iron fist in an attempt to keep non-mem-

bers in line.
"You can all have a brownie, but only if you promise not to speak out of turn," she says.
Because many of the non-members or "SWlLies,"
as they're generally called are taking the GREs, the
size of the group is significantly smaller than usual.
In absence are the two other co-presidents who form
the "Queens of Heart": Richard McFarland 'O2, the
Queen of Darkness, and Amy' Marinello 'O2, the Queen
of Gold. Friedman is known as the Queen of Stone.
Unique names are common in SWIL, and Marinello's
spelling of her first name is just one example. In her
case, there was already a SWILie named Amy when she
arrived as a freshman, and so she "primed" her name
so others could differentiate between them. Her name
has since been shortened to simply Prime, and she
joins a long list ofother nicknames in the organization.
Comma, BDan and Arcadia, for instance, are the
names most often used by SWIL non-members Ben
George 'O3, B. Daniel Fairchild 'O3 and Christina
Falcone 'O2, respectively.
Marinello said her choice to become a SWIL participant her first year here was not hard. After seeing the
organization's booth at the activities fair, she attended
the first meeting. "There were all these weird people
having fun," she said.
For Friedman, the decision was more gradual. At
the activities fair, she saw the non-members demonstrating a game of human chess. "A friend said, 'That's
SWIL; they're weird; don't hang out with them,' she
said.
After meeting several SWlLies through a theatre

production, however, Friedman changed her opinion.
She went to a meeting, and "I said, 'SWIL's supposed to

be weird, but these people are nice and fun.'
"I think they were justreally outgoing and interesting people," non-member Samantha Crane 'O4 said.
"

Several SWlLies were personally approached by
other participants as freshmen. "I was sitting alone eating in the small room [of Sharpies] and a girl said,
'Come and join us,' Arcadia Falcone 'O2 said.

"

In eons past
Back in the meeting, the non-members discuss planthat's a root beer keg,
ning for their "Kegger Party"
mind you
which will occur in the spring. The first
kegger was to celebrate SWIL's 21st birthday in 2000,
and non-members hope to make the party an annual

tradition.

SWIL began in the fall of 1978, with Jim Huang 'Bl as
the first president. "I can't remember the specific catalyst for getting the club started," Huang wrote on
SWIL's Web site, www.swil.org, "but somehow the five
[founders], who lived in Pittenger and Palmer, decided
to do it."
The acronym, Huang wrote, was developed first and
words then found to fit it. "I kept pushing for a two 'L'
SWILL," he wrote.
Over the years, SWIL began to take on more and
more activities. Some time in the early 1980s it took
over the Pterodactyl Hunt, which had been started by
the Folk Dance Club. There has been a significant overlap, in fact, between SWIL and folk dance over the
years. "SWIL attracts people who like to have fun, and
so does folk dancing," Friedman said. "And it's gym
credit with your friends." Friedman said, however, the
connection between the two organizations has been

weakening.
The next event SWIL started was the (now-annual)
St. Valentine's Massacre re-enactment in Sharpies. "At
a predetermined time," SWIL alumna Melissa Binde '9B
wrote on her Web site, "SWlLies dress as thugs in
trench coats
stride into the dining hall and say,
'Message from Big Al: Die you gravy-sucking pigs!'
The SWlLies whom they have surrounded then scream
...

"

and fall over.

Publication of the "Bug-Eyed Magazine," a campus
outlet for science fiction and fantasy work, soon followed. In addition to the Kegger Party, SWIL also hosts
"SWlLoween," an alternative Halloween event. Weekly
SWIL movies are also scheduled, including a night for
general science fiction and one focusing on "Mystery
Science Theatre 3000." In past years, SWIL has also
sponsored guest speakers and all-campus study breaks
to play board games.

A social support group
The meeting continues, and Friedman attempts to
put the rabble back on track. "Nominate books, you

stupid illiterate people!" she says. The books she mentions will be for the Cordwainer Bird science fiction
and fantasy library in Cornell. The library was started

SWIL bonds go beyond mere fantasy
From RABBLE, pg. 9
before SWIL began by Carl Fristrom 'BO, according to SWIL
alumna Jennie Jacobson 'B3, but was taken over shortly
after SWIL's conception. Each year, SWIL purchases new
books to add to their collection.
Many SWIL members don't see science fiction and fantasy as the ultimate reason for their organization.
"I think it's very nominally about science fiction and
fantasy," co-president Marinello said. "It's common to a lot
of our backgrounds, but not everyone likes [it]. Our day-today life is definitely not just about that."
"We just hang out; we don't have to get drunk or high ...
and we also happen to like sci-fi and fantasy," Friedman

said.

ness that I guess is associated with science fiction and fantasy, but it's certainly not limited to that."
The genre, Ben George 'O3 said, "is why we get funding,
and it's what our mandate is for our movies. It serves as a
kind of common mythology for [us], but that's certainly not
everything, or even the most important thing, I think."
"It's both an organization and a group of friends," Kyra

HIV anxiety
Few feelings in the world are more frustrating than
waiting. We all know the time spent in anticipation of a
test score, a jury's verdict or even a contested baseball
game is often marked by butterflies in your stomach
and sweaty palms. But waiting can also be agonizing
just ask anyone who has had an HIV test.
The procedure for getting HIV tested at Swarthmore
can cause considerable stress to students already worried enough to have the test taken. The HIV test available at Worth Health Center, because of the need for preand post-test counseling, is only available once a week
at most. There is only one person who can give this
counseling, and she comes into the health center once a
week for student appointments. This causes a major

problem for scheduling tests and receiving results.
According to Linda Echols, director of the health
center, having an HIV counselor who is not affiliated in
any other way with the coUege started when people
became worried about confidentiality and anonymity.
But these concerns can't always outweigh the anxiety
caused by long delays. Many students wouldrather get
the results sooner from a nurse or nurse practitioner
they have had contact with than wait a month or more
to get counseling from a stranger.
Additionally, when students have to wait a week
(and by some reports even longer because of cancellations) or miss class to get an appointment, it may discourage some from getting the test at all.
The process of counseling and giving information
before and after HIV tests are administered is crucial. It
tells the student about risks, prepares them for the possibility of a positive or negative result and gives them
information on how to stay safe during the waiting period and beyond. Although concerns about anonymity

and confidentiality are important, having a Worth
employee trained to do pre- and post-test counseling
would make the process much easier and faster for
already-anxious students. Training to do pre- and posttest HIV counseling takes relatively little time and is
easy to schedule at one of the many colleges and universities in the area.

Swat and SWIL
Dinosaur hunts. Helixes on Parrish staircases. Bad
science fiction movies.

The Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature
is unquestionably a unique part of campus life. The
Swarthmore pressure cooker can be overwhelming
sometimes, and it's encouraging to see a campus group
with the sole purpose of making that day-to-day life easier and more fun. In addition, SWIL provides an important social community.
At the same time, we feel that in some ways, SWIL
may be subtracting some energy from this campus. By
focusing on existing as a close, tightly-knit group, they
cement some friendships but forego others. Potential
participants could be turned away by the idea of others
who spend all of their time with only one circle of
friends.
Most people on campus who are members of one
group are active in another, probably unrelated group,
and in this way, diverse mixtures offriends form. With
SWIL participants, however, this is often not the case.
We are not suggesting that SWIL is not a worthy way to
spend your time, only that there are other, equally good
things that this time could be split between.
The college atmosphere contains a wealth of opportunities for SWIL, academically, socially and creatively.
SWIL participants should take the time to interact with
the rest of the campus not because "normal" college life
is inherently better, but because anything "normal" at
Swarthmore has its own unusual idiosyncrasies.
Right now, some students are suspicious of SWIL
because of its closed atmosphere. We feel that if SWIL
participants attempted to interact with the campus on a
more personal level, this would change. Most students
here accept others in spite of— in some cases, because
of— their quirkiness.
Both Swat and SWIL should learn to recognize that
each has value, and that each can enrich the other.

LETTER

The dignity of life, but for whom?
Dear Editor:

"We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death."
These were the words of President Bush as he addressed
the United Nations General Assembly in New York last
Saturday morning. We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death
a noble sentiment. In times like these,
such a statement of fine ideals demands closer considera-

tion.Who chooses the dignity oflife and, more importantly, for whom?
The implied chooser can be none other than the
American people. But in choosing "the dignity of life,"
have the American people really chosen the course of military action now being pursued in Afghanistan?
According to the poll numbers, apparently we have. We all
know the line: 90 percent of the American people support
the war, so say the figures. But then, don't we all know
also that there are two kinds of lies
damned lies on the
one hand, and statistics on the other? Mark Twain told us
that many years ago.
Judging from the numbers, we have chosen this
course, but then the operative question becomes: under
what assumptions, what pretenses, have we done so? Are
our leaders being honest with us about the human consequences of this war? What about our media? Are we being
honest with ourselves? The United Nations and respected
international aid agencies have warned that 7.5 million

people may not survive this winter in Afghanistan
because our American bombing campaign has prevented
and continues to prevent
food shipments from getting through. That's five times the population of
Philadelphia, almost the population of New York. Are we
willing to accept responsibility for such consequences?
In choosing the dignity of life, it must be asked for
whom we are choosing it. Do we choose it for the world, or
for ourselves alone? If for the world, surely the carpetbombing that will only increase the civilian death toll and
further impede relief efforts is not the way to achieve it. If
only for ourselves, at the expense ofother innocent lives,
how can the life we choose be dignified? "We choose the
dignity of life over a culture of death." So spoke our

President. But do we?

Arctic drilling vital to
U.S. world position
It seems that Republicans are accused of exploiting the war on terrorism every time Daschle disagrees with Bush on an issue. The truth

is that a lot of policy proposals are exploiting the urgency of the
extraordinary times we're living in. The unnecessary new farm subsidies won't exactly propel us to resounding victory against our enemies
and the nefarious concept of low level war-making.
Rather, they're proof positive that democracies are highly inefficient creatures that pass wasteful measures on behalf of rent-seeking
interests. Likewise, our recent fiscal boost seems a tad redundant in
light of the 10 percent monetary growth this year that is already boosting the economy as shown through productivity gains.
On the other side of the coin, there are two vitally important policy
proposals that leftists have unfairly characterized as being exploitative
of our current situation. The first of these is oil drilling at the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), which, as of this submission, was
about to be voted on by the Senate as part of the overall energy package. The existing opposition to ANWR drilling is testament to the kneejerk environmentalism of the upper classes. 60 percent of America's
official wilderness areas are in Alaska.
Beyond this, Alaska is 99 percent owned by the federal government,
and the ANWR constitutes one percent of this area. The land that
would actually be drilled within this region makes up only one percent
of the ANWR. The locals have agreed to the drilling, and the oil exploration would not even occur on land that is generally considered even
the only fitting adjective for the land is remote.
remotely beautiful
But even beyond these arguments, modern technology enables the
preservation of the land to coincide with energy production.

The current crisis should make manifest the importance of increasing the United States' energy independence. The U.S.-Saudi relationship is deteriorating rapidly, for reasons ranging from the Saudis' lack
of cooperation in fighting their domestic terrorist fundraising to the
fact that the Saudi royal family fundamentally does not share the
American value of liberal democracy. The Saudis recently had the
audacity to demand that the United States end the bickering between
Israel and Palestine
never mind that the United States has gone
more than out of its way to bring peace to the two warring parties.
We know what happens when oil prices spin out of control. We've
been down that road before. In the 19705, we had worldwide recession,
the third world debt crisis and Jimmy Carter. Russia's drilling heroics
notwithstanding, it seems prudent to increase our own energy independence by exploring a region that promises to be an oil treasure
trove. We shouldn't kid ourselves like John Kerry did recently on
"Meet the Press," when he said with a straight face that America's
energy needs in the next 20 years could be met through wind and solar
power. This is not serious planning.
Likewise, otherwise smart politicians like Charles Rangel have
accused the Bush administration of exploiting the current war to justify expanded free trade. The Bush administration's crime is seeking
Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in order to de-politicize the particulars of trade agreements.
Two parties who wish to barter with each other should be allowed
to do so without government interference. Beyond this, rudimentary
economic analysis reveals that free trade helps all parties according to
the law of comparative advantage. If there is any lesson we should garner from the Asian miracle, it is that economic development occurs
when nations trade and interact with the outside world, as opposed to
India and Brazil pre-1990, where domestic customers were held captive
to government-protected industries.
But economic development is not the only positive effect of trade.
Throughout the past 50 years, trade has resulted in freer, more pluralistic societies in places like South Korea, Taiwan and Bahrain. The right
way for the United States to gain friends is to integrate new regions into
the world economic system and give them a vested interest in wealth creation, as opposed to the destructive victimhood so pervasive throughout

those regions generally viewed as being anti-American.
Despite the nonsense campus radicals spew, we are in this war until
we win, and our cause is just. The "why war?" debate is moot. What we
should be debating as a pluralistic society is how we can best achieve
victory in this war and in the process create a better and fairer world.
I propose that ANWR drilling and TPA are essential components
toward this noble endeavor.

No room for apathy now
BY CHARLIE BRUBAKER
It is timefor the sensible people on this campus
to stand up and be counted. Why-War.com, SPAC
and other protesters have managed to dominate
the campus debate on the war on terrorism, while

most (except those who came to the Rally for
America) have remained silent and apathetic.
Indeed, the response of the entire campus to the
terrorist attacks has been dominated by an apathy
and
moral cowardice worthy of the French
response to Hitler. For the sake of the college's reputation and for the sake of America, we must act to
reverse this trend, to stand up to the Neville

Chamberlains and "Kandahar Janes" on this campus, and to support the war against al Qaeda and

the Taliban.
The truth is that, although we have been bombing the Taliban for a little more than a month, al

Qaeda has been at war with us for more than eight

years. Since 1993, when al Qaeda first attacked the
World Trade Center, they have murdered our sol-

diers protecting Saudi Arabia, bombed our
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, attacked the
USS Cole and killed 5,000 Americans on Sept. 11
They will continue to commit atrocities against
Americans as long as we stand in the way of their
radical ambition. They do not wish for peace and
freedom as we do. They wish to exterminate or
drive out all Christians and all Jews from the
Middle East and Central Asia and to persecute
their fellow Muslims through religious inquisitions like the Taliban does in Afghanistan.
As long as we defend the world from this horror, we are their enemy and will be the victims of
their terrorist attacks. Our president has drawn
the sensible conclusion that "in the face of today's
new threat, the only way to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it."
The most common criticism of the war against
the Taliban is that America is killing innocent
civilians.

First, we must remember the 5,000 of our own
civilians who died in the attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. Al Qaeda is the
aggressor, and the sins for the innocent deaths in

this war will fall upon their heads.
Second, it should be noted that while we try to

minimize civilian casualties, the Taliban and al
Qaeda try to maximize not only American deaths
but also the deaths of the Afghan people. They park
tanks and store munitions in residential areas hoping that bombs will kill civilians and undermine
American support for the war.
Third, failure to effectively prosecute this war
would almost certainly result in more innocent
victims as al Qaeda continues its assault on
America. More important than the number of victims of the war, however, is the outcome.
To allow terrorist attacks like those of Sept. 11
to go unpunished and to allow al Qaeda to continue its work unopposed would plunge the world into

a dark age of lawless violence and poverty many
times worse than the suffering caused by a U.S.
war in Afghanistan. As is almost always the case,
war is a necessary evil.
To those who are apathetic toward the war, I
say, "wake up." To those who actively oppose the
war, I ask, "would Osama call you an ally?"
Normally, conscientious objectors to American use
of force are respectable though often foolish, but
because the United States was directly attacked,
this war is different.
Those who protest against this war are undermining America's most direct and most effective
means of self-defense. They are working to protect
the al Qaeda network even as it plans to launch
new attacks against the United States. In this
sense, they are the allies of al Qaeda, and are recognized by Osama bin Laden as such.
His only hope of success is that we will be
seduced by their simple-minded vision of peace
and lack the moral courage to stand up and fight
for what is right in this world.
Although few of us will have the honor to fight
al Qaeda directly, we can all contribute to the war
effort by fighting apathy and pacifism at home
and on this campus. To censor protesters' voices
would violate the liberty we seek to defend; however, we can and should drown them out with our
resounding cries in support of America and her
just war.

Terrorists strike
invisibly now
Perhaps the worst thing about the crash of American Airlines
Flight 587 in Queens on Monday, besides of course the loss of life, is
that it signaled to the rest of America what Osama bin Laden has
known along: it doesn't take a terrorist to pull off a terrorist attack.
All it takes is an untimely accident and a country full of very frightened people.
The Airbus crash this week visited cruel irony on Rockaway,
Queens. Home to many police officers and fire fighters, the neighborhood lost about 40 residents in the Sept. 11 attacks. To say they were

not ready for a plane crash in their back yard is something of an

understatement.
The same goes for the Dominican community in New York, which
also lost about 40 members in the World Trade Center. Flight 587 was
bound for Santo Domingo, and many of its passengers lived either in
the Dominican Republic or in the Washington Heights neighborhood
of Manhattan, home to many Dominican immigrants. A couple of
people were said to have narrowly escaped the World Trade Center
attacks two months ago, only to perish when Flight 587 went down.
It now appears unlikely that the crash was another terrorist
attack. Initial reports indicate that an engine fell off the plane soon
after takeoff, causing the pilots to lose control and the aircraft to nosedive into the ground. Many questions must still be answered, but they
will probably be about mechanical issues, not al Queda terrorists.
But a brief survey of news accounts shows us all too clearly that
the Sept. 11 tragedy was not far from people's minds in New York on
Monday. "Into the sleepy rhythms of a holiday morning, human bodies came hurtling from a jet fuselage onto a quiet residential street,"
read an needlessly graphic lead from The New York Times. The
description was reminiscent of that of a clear, sunny morning in
September when bodies dropped from the top floors of the twin tow-

ers.
Another account, in The Washington Post, termed the scene "apocalyptic. Manhole covers belched fire, an airplane wing severed a tree
and jet fuel on a backyard pool caught fire, slowly melting the blue

plastic below. Blouses and shirts snagged in tree branches, and bod-

ies lay charred in the streets." The description evoked images of a
war-torn city in the aftermath of a battle, a comparison often made
just months ago by reporters attempting to describe Ground Zero.
A second article from The Times highlighted the irony of the
crash's timing and location, labeling it "the punch line to some dark,
cosmic joke" and "the deadly car accident that derails the funeral procession."
It was impossible to shake the suspicion that this crash was somehow related to the horrific events of Sept. 1L But without proof, no
one was willing to use the T-word quite yet.
So let me carefully wade into these waters: the plane crash on
Monday was another terrorist attack. It was also, so far as we know,
nothing but a terrible accident.
In fact, it was more an event of terror than an act of terrorism. But
it struck Americans, New Yorkers especially, with fear and sometimes panic rarely witnessed in that city before Sept. 11. It was the
"post" in post-traumatic stress disorder, and it was part of Osama's
plan.

Before Monday, people did not want to fly because they were afraid
of hijackers. Now, they have to worry about the engine falling off, too.
Before Monday, you could stay in bed all day and be relatively safe
as long you didn't open your mail. Now, a jetliner could crash through
your bedroom ceiling at any moment.
The odds of being killed in an aviation accident, whatever the
cause, remain infinitesimally low. Our economy, though sinking fast,
is one of the strongest in the history of the world. And we all ought to
be glad, real glad, we do not live in Afghanistan.
But it sure doesn't seem that way.

that was coming to terms with loss. When I saw
'Ground Zero,' I was overwhelmed by the feeling
of loss myself, even though I had only been to
Manhattan a few times in my life and thus was
not used to the sight of the twin towers. The loss
was made tangible by the smoke and dust that
still emanates from the site and scatters the
afternoon sunlight. The loss of the towers and
the sons and daughters of the city who perished
when they collapsed was real to me, and it was
much more real to those New Yorkers who still
stand at the edges of the destruction, like those
veterans who share their grief at the Vietnam
Veterans Monument in Washington.
Grief is an emotion that calls for a moral commitment, but it is equally important to remember that grief is, unfortunately, nearly universal
in the crisis of Sept. 11 and its aftermath, including the bombings. Just as Nov. 11,1918 was a day
through which the collective grief of an entire

also be true that the
Americans have, just for
a moment, also felt what
it is to be a Palestinian?

The burning smell still
lingered in my clothes
hours later, a reminder of what I saw. In time,
the smell will be washed from my clothes and
fade away from New York City. Grief will become
less real, less tangible and, as it happens more
and more every day, more monopolized by the
United States, giving a moral carte blanche to the
imperatives of justice and revenge that the politicians say will wash away loss and decrease the
fear of another Sept. 1L This compartmentalizes
both the grief and the fear; it makes light of the
pain that others feel as a result of U.S. actions.
The political point here is that
as we all know
from the last two months
there is a very thin
line between grief and anger, and as the United
States ignores others' pain to keep the limelight
on its own, that anger will be felt, as it is even
now throughout the Muslim world.
The deeper point, however, is that in order for
this crisis to truly be resolved, the United States
requires the humility to recognize that it is one
of many countries facing adversity, and that it
needs to work with others in building a peace
that is built not by the projection of power but by
mutual understanding of fear, pain and grief.
This is not an American issue alone, and casting

it as such will alienate and anger much of the

rest of the world.

Thanksgiving is for dysfunction
BY SUZANNE WU
If there's one thing I know about Thanksgiving,
it's that it always sucks. Face it: no matter how much
you love your family, spending a prolonged amount of
time with them, without material compensation for
your time like at Christmas or Hannukah or Chinese
New Year, and trying to be happy because that's how
things are supposed to be, well, that's just way too
much pressure.
I think we also know all too well that pressure
means a lot of emotional drama, which makes for retrospectively hilarious hysteria. But who wants to
think about their own problems? You'll deal with the
crock that is Thanksgiving soon enough, and for now,
laughing at other people's shady lives seems like a
welcome escape from the drudgery of your own.
Which brings us to the Wendy MacLeod play
"House of Yes," directed by Tiffany Lennon 'O2, and
starring Amy Robinson 'O4, Sarah Walsh 'O5, Ben
Camp 'O5, Alex Edleson 'O4 and Mara Gustafson 'O3.
The darkly humorous play features, instead of one
star and a bunch of afterthoughts, a cast of fleshedout characters, each dealing with the Thanksgiving

descent into passive-aggressive turmoil.
"I've always been a fan of family melodramas on
film, and I wanted to see how contemporary, and
slightly overblown, melodrama would come out on
stage. It's a mess, but it's a very compelling mess,"
explained Lennon.

"House of Yes" follows the old-money Pascal family as they "lash out at each other in increasingly disturbing ways," according to Lennon. The Pascals live
next door to the Kennedy compound in McLean, Va.,
and a central plot thread is the incestuous relationship between two twins, named Jackie O. and Marty,
who sleep together and reenact the Kennedy assassination with ultimately fatal results. There's also the
seduction of Marty's fiancee by his brother Anthony,
and that other soap-operatic necessity: snooping by

the mother, Mrs. Pascal.

"The show deals with a lot of situations
Swarthmore students can sympathize with insane
families, stressful holidays, sarcastic relatives
but
it places these issues in a setting that's pretty
removed from daily life, which in some ways makes
the play emotionally accessible. You can identify with
the commonalities, and then laugh at the absurdity
and be shocked by it because these things would
never happen at your house on Thanksgiving. After
this play, everyone should be glad to get back to their
(much saner) families for the holidays," said Lennon.
"House of Yes" will be performed in Olde Club on
Friday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 6 p.m. Seating is limited to about 70, so if you want to get in, make sure to
arrive early.

Five is alive

The easiest humor device in the world comes to Swarthmore

In living color: steps toward a more
representative theatre scene
Last week I had a conversation with Khadijah White 'O4, director of "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the
Rainbow is Enuf," by Ntozake Shange, (scheduled for a February
performance in conjunction with Black History Month), about the
difficulties her production faced finding both performers of color
and campus space for the performance.
Despite the fact that I will be taking five credits next semester,
playing rugby, working as a class officer, holding down an internship and trying to figure out what I will do after graduation, for
some reason (perhaps a momentary lapse into insanity) I found
myself volunteering to take on roles left empty by other actresses
who dropped out of the production because they "didn't have
time." My only explanation for why I just eagerly volunteered to
take on yet another obligation (other than having lost my mind): I
believe in the project, it's a great play and the lives of people of
color are hardly ever represented on the Swarthmore stage.
Considering the multicultural environment that Swarthmore
College aspires to create, it is striking that there are so few productions based on the lives of people of color. Usually non-white actors
and actresses are put into roles intended for white actors, but are
racially ambiguous enough to accommodate others. This is not just
a problem at Swarthmore; it is a problem in the acting world in
general. The white actor is the norm, the actor of color is the aberration.
I remember an experience I had in an acting class my sophomore year when the professor had selected "Crimes of the Heart,"
by Beth Henley, for our semester-long project. The play is set in
rural Mississippi during the 1950s (maybe 19605, I can't remember), and follows the lives of three sisters after the youngest one
has shot her rich, powerful and abusive husband. The setting of
the play is critical to its plot and character development, highlighting problems that arise from considering the historical truths about
the southern United States at and before the Civil Rights
Movement which would then destroy the plot line of the play if
black actors were to replace white actors. For one, the lives of the
three sisters do not reflect the lives of most blacks living in rural

Mississippi.
The play ends with the youngest sister having the charges
against her dropped
an ending that would not occur if a black
woman shot a wealthy white man in the south. In addition, the
other actresses in the class were white, and it is unlikely that a
white family in rural Mississippi would have adopted me, a black
woman. So, when the professor asked that we imagine each other
as a family in the same exact circumstances as the fictional family
in the play, I found myself at a loss for how to displace the obvious
awkwardness of being a non-white actress in a white role. This
experience prompted me to volunteer my help when I heard that
there was going to be a play on campus that reflects the lives of
women of color. I jumped at the chance to make sure that it would

happen.
I believe that artists of color are often in a double bind: they are
confined by society's expectations of them and their race while
they struggle to create something of their own. At the same time,
they are products of their circumstances, and even someone
raised in an entirely white environment is at some point made
aware of his or her difference from others. This desire to break
from the societal conventions set for one's race while still maintaining some allegiance to it challenges all artists of color.
An example is the black musician who does not wish for her or
his music to be classified as rap, hip-hop or R&B, but everything
this musician produces is still compared to these genres. Or worse
yet, the music is found to be completely outside of these genres
and therefore the musician is said to have "forgotten where
he/she comes from." As a black writer, Ntozake Shange manages
to walk a very fine line and produces a piece that talks about being
a woman of color while breaking from traditional forms of expression. The play is a collection of her poetry gathered over the years
expressed by seven characters, seven women who represent different sides of her life.
Hopefully, once people see "For Colored Girls
this February,
it will remind everyone that there should be more productions like
this on campus. With "King Hedley II" (winner of the 2001 Tony
Award; written by August Wilson) and "Aida" (winner of four Tony
awards; starring Heather Headley) at the top of the list of shows
currently on Broadway, our campus theater scene should take a
hint. There are a lot of playwrights of color to choose from. My
hope is that in the future we will see more representation on the

The following is not an attempt on the part of
the author to escape from thinking about the real
world by diving headfirst into the entertainingly
irrelevant. OK, so maybe it is, but it’s not a successful attempt. Think of it as a cataloguing of
one’s daily state of affairs that needs to happen
every now and then. Think of it as a warm tribute
to David Letterman. Think of it as a Swarthmore
version of Harper’s index, or Billboard’s Top 40.
Think of it as my own personal “High Fidelity,”
only without the angst (and by the way, read the
book if you’ve only seen the movie
it’s much
more British and pretty darn cool). Or skip over it
and check out the sports section. But this is how I
spent the time in which I was supposed to be writing a column. So I guess that makes this a column.

V. Five thoughts regarding the animal kingdom:
11 like to think of the Hegemony as some kind of

rodent, kind of like a porcupine only bigger and
less prickly. Then you could overthrow it by
snatching it from the hands of the old white guy
carrying it and running away, kind of like capture-the-flag.

2. Marsupial people, if they existed, would be
utterly horrifying. Pouches are scary.
3. It would be neat if there were animals with
wheels. I guess if we continue our current trend
of paving over everything in sight to build parking lots so people can go to the malls, that might
actually become evolutionarily feasible.
4. People really look a whole lot like monkeys,
when you come right down to it. Like, really a
whole lot.
5. The animal kingdom would be much cooler if it
had an actual king, like with a crown and everything, and a landed aristocracy, and they all wore
Victorian clothing and engaged in scheming

Machiavellian politics.

VI. Five nerdy things it would be fun to name a

L The Theta Criterion
2. The Sicilian Blunder
3. Doctor Manhattan

Five suggested Sharpies specialty selections: Suggestion
no. 5. College student bar
Ramen, EasyMac, Chips, Salsa,
Mountain Dew, and beer.
4. Fourth Dihedral
5. The Ulysses S. Grant Explosion
VII. Five suggested Sharpies specialty selec-

tions:

L Cheese bar
Mmm. Cheese.
2. Sushi bar Probably too expensive, but we can
dream, can't we?
Seabiscuit, haddock, and lemons
3. Nautical bar
to prevent scurvy.
4. Stuff-on-sticks bar
Kind of like "Appetizer
bar", except instead of everything being deep-fried,
everything is on a stick. Including fruits and veg-

etables.

5. College student bar
Ramen, EasyMac, Chips,
Salsa, Mountain Dew, and beer.
VIM. Five possible new Swarthmore sports mascots:
L The Garnet Ape
2. The Hegemony (see above)
3. The Pterodactyl
4. The Swarthy Sailor
5. Noam Chomsky
IX. Five questions:
L Who are you and how did you get into my apart-

ment?
2. On what day of the week did Hamilton first discover the quaternions?
3. What is Interpretation Theory? Please, someone,
tell me.
4. Why the hyphen, Why-War?
5. What is The Meaning of Swarthmore?

X. Five answers, not necessarily to the above
questions:
L Life is nasty, brutish and short. Like Henry

Rollins.
2. The egg, obviously.
3. No matter what you say or do to me, I'm still a
worthwhile person.
4. Nothing's wrong, dear. Why do you ask?
5. You, faithful reader of The Phoenix. You are the
answer.

And so, again, the dead horse has been beaten
firmly into the ground. I was entertained, at least.
But now, it is over, and I'm off to read the Daily
Jolt. Next column will have a point, I promise.

'Monsters': A whole lotta
computer-generated love

Peace collection inspires
renowned installation artist

BY ESTER BLOOM

BY

There are times in
life when you want
intellectual stimulation. After a long day
of filing papers in
your
dad's
best
friend's legal office,

Last week, Buzz Spector's exhibit "Public/
Private Peace" opened in the List Gallery.
Through Dec. 15, when the exhibit closes,
Spector will be creating a piece of installation art
in the gallery, as well as producing an "artist's
book" using images from the Swarthmore
College Peace Collection.
According to its Web site, the Peace Collection
contains "the materials of persons and organizations who have worked for nonviolent social
change, disarmament, and conflict resolution
between peoples and nations." The collection
comprises manuscripts, periodicals and visual
items such as photographs, bumper stickers and
posters.
Spector has visited Swarthmore several times
over the past two years to immerse himself in
the Peace Collection. For this exhibit, Spector
on
"used 90 of the thousands of photographs
peace activists and peace events such as
demonstrations from the 1860s to the present," according to the collection's curator, Wendy
Chmielewski. The book, "Details: Closed to
Open," will also incorporate images of hands in
varying gestures. It is available for free to gallery

for

instance.

Then

there are times when
all you want is to
relax, like midway
through a semester at
Swarthmore. Luckily,
Pixar can always be
counted on to provide

diversion.

Following the pattern established by "Toy Story," "Monsters" focuse
on the life of children and tries to capture life from their perspective
While "Toy Story" took a new spin on objects kids find familiar
"Monsters" looks at the opposite: what keeps kids awake at night
Only the monsters who frighten kids do so for constructive purposes
and the monsters are much more frightened of those they're paid to
scare than the other way around.
James P. Sullivan, known as Sully, (voiced by and resembling John
Goodman in a furry blue suit) is the monster city's number-one scar
er. He's huge and harmless in a Sesame Street way; and he lives with
his sidekick and personal trainer, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal)

visitors throughout the exhibition.
"Peace Collection staff tend to see the photographs as resources illustrating the historical
moment or as examples of photojournalism or
photographic art," Chmielewski said. "Buzz's
exhibit has created a new way for these materi-

als to be viewed."
During his residency, Spector will also be cre-

ating an exhibition catalog documenting the evo-

lution of the installation with a series of essays
and reproductions, as well as scholarly commentary. This book will be available at the end of the
showing.

The Peace Collection was established in 1930
when Jane Addams donated her papers and
books related to peace and social justice to
Swarthmore College. Since then, the collection
has expanded to include other manuscripts as
well as photographic images and audio visual
pieces. Addams was the founder of Hull House
in Chicago, an organization which provided all
types of services to immigrants in the neighborhood: kindergarten and daycare, a library, music
and art lessons and an art gallery.
The List Gallery is open from 1 to 4 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays, Wednesdays 12 to 4
p.m. and Fridays 1 to 5 p.m.

Mike keeps him pepped for his job at the Monsters, Inc. factory, which
is to step through doors into children's bedrooms on Earth and elici
a scream. Children's screams, once stored in batteries, provide the
energy necessary

to keep the monster city going.

The animation is fabulous, down to the
individually trembling hairs on Sully's
coat, and while most of the laughs are
derived from the sight-gags, the dialogue
is generally clever.
Sully, egged on by Mike, who looks like a one-eyed green M&M, is
close to breaking the factory's record. But Randall, a lizard-like creature who can blend in with the background and essentially disappear
(voiced by an evil-sounding Steve Buscemi,) is a close second and will
stop at nothing to attain the record himself. After work one day,
Randall remains at the factory for his own purposes and Sully stumbles upon a door that Randall has left open.
Suddenly a child, which monster conventional wisdom views as
extremely toxic, darts across the threshold. Sully, in his non-threatening mode, only amuses her: she attaches herself to him immediately. He panics, and after failing a few times to force her back into her
bedroom, ends up putting her in a bag and smuggling her back to his
apartment.
While Monster city goes beserk trying to discover and return the
child, Sully, having no family of his own, begins to warm to her. She
giggles a lot, she's energetic and he doesn't experience any ill effects
from being near her. When he accidentally realizes the connection
between Randall and a conspiracy at the plant, he has to choose
whether to risk everything for her sake.
In a lot of ways, the story is pure Disney. The hero is noble, loyal,
good-hearted if not too bright: very much a monster-next-door. Mike
is the wise-cracking, skeptical friend who ultimately, grudingly does
the right thing too. The ruling class turns out to be corrupt. No surprises here.
Still, the animation is fabulous, down to the individually trembling hairs on Sully's coat, and while most of the laughs are derived
from the sight-gags, the dialogue is generally clever. "Monsters Inc."
is the kind of fuzzy, cheerful fun that doesn't make you think but
leaves you the option. Just right for this time of year.

High hopes for men's hoops
Thickened roster increases team's prospects for season
BY

DERRICK WU

With five returning starters and a number of towering freshmen to bolster last season's undersized
roster, the men's basketball team is opening the season with hopes to make the conference playoffs.
The biggest culprit behind last season's disappointing 4-20 season was youth and inexperience.
After a leave of absence in the 1998-1999 season to
serve as head scout for the San Antonio Spurs, head
coach Lee
Wimberly has been rebuilding
Swarthmore's men's basketball program with young
and talented players. Seven of the nine players who
saw double-figure minutes and four of the six leading
scorers are returning from the 2001-2002 campaign.
Although Muhlenberg and Ursinus are the teams
to beat in the East division of the Centennial
Conference, Wimberly is hopeful that his team will
battle for one of the two playoff spots. Forward Chris

Loeffler 'O4 agrees. "We expect no less than a second
place finish in the eastern division of our conference
and a trip to the conference tournament."
During the off-season, the Garnet Tide addressed
its-most pressing need: size. With only one player
over 6'4" last season, the squad was out-blocked 103-43
and out-rebounded 1017-879. The team plans on turning these statistics around with the help of a recruiting class that boasts an average height of 6'5". "We
look to be more inside-out this year, as we have some
players who are good on the block," said forward
Josh Loeffler 'O3.
If the team is to succeed, the Tide needs the tall
rookies to fill in at the critical four and five post positions. Thus far, Matt Gustafson 'O5 and 6'B" center
Evan Gelacek 'O5 have played well during the preseason. Rookie 6'6" forward Bayne Heersink 'O5 and 6'B"
center Blair Haxel 'O5 are also expected to contribute
with rebounds and aggressive play as the season progresses. "I hope that as our young team matures during the season, we will be in a position to contend for
the playoffs as the season gets down to the final two

weeks," said Wimberly.
Although the Garnet Tide may lack a superstar
player, the team does boast a well-rounded attack.
After leading Swat in scoring last year with 15.5
points per game (ppg), guard David Pearce 'O3 is
expected to have another productive season with the
help of sophomore Chris Loeffler (9.8 ppg, 5.5 rpg). Cocaptains Eran Ganot 'O3 (9.2 ppg, 5.4 rpg) and Kyle
Lewis 'O2 (9.4 ppg, 51 rpg) are also big contributors to
the Tide's balanced attack. "One of our biggest advantages is that we have Lewis, Ganot and myself playing
the guard and forward positions against smaller
guards and bigger forwards that have a tough time
guarding us," said Chris Loeffler.
In order to double the number of wins from last
season, Coach Wimberly would also like to improve
the team's physical presence and defensive quickness
on the perimeter. Although the freshmen bring the
height, the team could still use more physicality and
experience in the post positions.
The team has also added a junior varsity team to
give playing time for all 20 players on the roster. "We
practice every day together as one team, but we will
be playing a 7 to 10 game JV schedule this year for the
guys, regardless of their year in school, who are not
getting varsity playing time," said Wimberly.
Already, the Tide is seeing the benefits of a large
team. "Our better depth has resulted in more competition in the rotation than we have had in recent
years," said Wimberly.
With a core of returning players, a batch of towering freshmen, and a large roster, the men's basketball
team is looking like it's headed in the right direction.
"I don't think most people expect" a trip to the
Centennial Conference playoffs, "but I think it is a
possibility," said Wimberly.
This season, the team has something to prove and
the ability to do it. "We want to show that
Swarthmore basketball is a legitimate entity in the
conference," said Josh Loeffler. The road begins on
Nov. 16 in the 8 p.m. opener of the Equinox Classic.

Veteran Garnettes
offer season outlook
From GARNETTES, pg. 20
Lee 'O5 from New York City rounds out the backcourt. Straddling that
oh-so-obscure line between guard and post player, is Ali "Teen" Wolff
'O5, from somewhere near Pittsburgh. The lone freshman center, from
Hopkinton, MA, Lauren "Return to sender" Kett 'O5, stands tall.
These rookies will add a new dynamic to a corps of seasoned veterans. The Garnet Tide expects significant contributions from
returnees including its army of senior captains, Heather Kile 'O2,
Caitlin Ryland 'O2, Emily Gray 'O2 and Katie Tarr 'O2. Furman will
undoubtedly provide a spark from the arc, and sometimes a few feet
beyond. Speaking on behalf of herself and fellow sophomore powerhouse Jerusha Rodgers 'O4, Katie Robinson 'O4 emphatically exclaims,
"I like to play!"
The will of the 2001-2002 Garnet Tide has been tested on two separate occasions by two different teams in recent scrimmages. The
a team they
women first came up against Gwynedd Mercy College
defeated in their first-ever bid to the NCAA tournament last year. To
state the obvious, this team was gunning for the Garnettes, who managed to hold their own quite well in their first real challenge as a
team. They faced rapacious full court pressure nearly the entire game
and were still able to execute their plays and work on their famous
defense.
On Tuesday, Nov. 13, the Tide was at home in their flashy white
uniforms to face another opponent, Neumann College. The improvement upon the first scrimmage was evident as the ladies came out
eager to prove their stuff against a different team. On many levels, the
squad stepped up to the challenge: excellent ball movement, defensive

intensity, and leadership on the court proved to be key ingredients for
a successful evening.
The championship-caliber experience of the returning players coupled with five talented first years will undoubtedly prove a potent combination. The Swarthmore women's basketball team will expect your
eager attendance at their first home games of the season this Saturday
and Sunday, Nov. 17 and 18 in "the House that Shibles Built."

ATHLETIC

Duzenski: not just a statistic

Sports-loving spin doctor involved in promotion, development of Swarthmore's sports
BY TARA TROUT
When Sports Information Director (SID) Mark Duzenski
first came to Swarthmore in 1995, he was thrilled to take a
job that allowed him to enjoy himself as well as help others.
He is in his seventh year here and occupies a time-consuming position that used to be a two-year term alternated
between a male and a female director. He is the first fulltime SID.
A Delaware Valley native, Duzenski played golf and basketball in high school. He graduated from Trenton State
(now The College of New Jersey) in 1988. He had originally
planned to major in accounting, but Duzenski explained
that he "had a class with this crazy professor. He said he
was Fidel Castro's treasurer. I changed my major." After
completing his degree in business management, Duzenski
worked what he calls "boring" office jobs in insurance and
personnel.
While searching for a job that would combine his love of
sports with a possible career, Duzenski landed an internship with the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team. "I figured
ifI'm going to work for another 40 years, I might as well do
something that I enjoy." said Duzenski. The Public
Relations director for the 76ers was a good friend of the SID
at Monmouth University, who was looking for an assistant.
After making the shift to Monmouth in 1994, Duzenski got
the first taste of his future career. At Monmouth, he
worked with the women's soccer, basketball and softball
teams. He worked for one year at Monmouthbefore moving
to his current position at Swarthmore.
Duzenski has a hand in almost everything involving
Swarthmore sports. He is in charge of public relations for
the athletic department. He promotes the teams and players by aiding in the creation of the athletic brochures, as
well as by developing and maintaining the new athletics
Web site that made its debut this past Monday.
Statistics are also at the forefront of the SlD's responsibilities, and Duzenski frequently travels with the teams to
important away matches to keep up-to-date. In previous
years, he traveled with the football team, but now he travels with the men's basketball team. He is also in charge of
releasing news of student-athletes to their hometown and
other local newspapers, and even dabbles in athletic photography when he has time on the field.
One of the most difficult tasks of his position, however,

is the time-consuming work of researching the histories of

the athletic program. Because the SID position changed
hands every two years, the year-to-year team records and
statistics are incomplete. It is Duzenski's job to fill in the
gaps and maintain records of important player, team and

school statistics.

Writing and releasing news and information reports to
both the campus and the Centennial Conference are also
part of his daily schedule. Without Duzenski, most of the
attention Swarthmore athletics receives on the national
level would not occur.
Despite the great amount of time and effort involved
with the position, Duzenski loves working for Swarthmore.
"My friends think I'm crazy taking a job that requires
working nights and weekends and working seven days a
week at times, but I think this is by far and away the best
job I've ever had," said the stalwart Tide promoter. "The
job is fun, the campus is beautiful, the athletic department
staff is supportive and the coaching staff is great to work
with." But what keeps him going are the student-athletes
themselves. "I also enjoy the interaction with the studentathletes. In fact I've maintained friendships with several
students after graduation."
Although he is currently a lone operator, Duzenski
would like to see an assistant in the future. No funding is
currently available to supply him with an assistant so help
is currently provided by student workers. A majority of the

SID office workers are student-athletes; recent graduate
Kristen English 'Ol and Katie Tarr 'O2 have both spent time
delving into the Swat athletic archives.
Duzenski's opinion about the future of Swarthmore
sports is positive with a hint of sadness. "I think the athletic program is heading in the right direction.
Unfortunately it's come at the expense of the football team,

and some of my fondest memories ofSwarthmore athletics
occurred on the football field."
Duzenki wants all of the teams to do well, although
chances are slim that all of the Garnet Tide teams will end
up on top at once. He feels that "if things that have been
that is
discussed over the past few months come to be
new fields, having the track resurfaced, and getting fulltime coaches for all sports, then we will have the tools to
work with to recruit the top student-athletes that will help
improve our programs
It will take some time and in the
end everything hinges on admissions. I hope it will happen,
I'd love to see every team compete for a Centennial
Championship. After all, winning is fun."

Swimming splashes into Centennial Conference
Briones leads women to victory with wins in two events; Men's team loses by a narrow margin
BY

RACHEL BURSTEIN

The women's swim team racked up its second
Centennial Conference victory of the season on Nov. 10,
while the men fell to a 1-1 record after losing a close meet
to Franklin and Marshall. Both the men and women accumulated home wins in their opening conference meets
against Ursinus on Nov. 7.
The women, recording a win which serves as one of the
first steps in defending their Centennial Conference title,
defeated Franklin and Marshall by a score of 125-80. "F&M
was our first tough competition and we were excited to
compete as well as we did. We won conferences last year
but lost to F&M in the dual meet season, so this victory
bodes well for the rest of the season," Amy Auerbach 'O2
said in reflecting on the significance of the win.
The men, who finished the 2001 winter season with a
third place conference finish behind Gettysburg and
Franklin and Marshall, were disappointed with a 109-96
loss that was sealed only in the final race of the meet, but
saw a vast improvement from last season to this year. "We
only lost by a couple points this year. We got blown out last
year, so from that perspective it's not that bad. F&M traditionally is really, really strong, and so if we managed to
stay as close as we did to them, we have a pretty good shot

for the rest of the season," said Eric Shang 'O4.
Recording times that she hopes to replicate throughout

the year, Natalie Briones 'O3 led the Garnet in the victory
over the F&M Diplomats by winning the 200 Individual
Medley, the 200 Breaststroke and participating in the 400
Medley Relay. Strong performances were also given by a
number of first year women, including Katherine Reid 'O5,
Kathryn Stauffer 'O5 and Melanie Johncilla 'O5, and by
upperclassmen Amy Auerbach 'O2 and Tara Trout 'O4 .
On the men's side, David Whitehead 'O3 contributed to
the Tide's surge by winning the 200 Freestyle, 100 Freestyle
and swimming the 400 Medley Relay. Captain Mike Dudley
'O3 and John Lillvis 'O3 also garnered wins in the 200
Breaststroke and 200 Individual Medley respectively.
Swim team members believe these performances bode
well for the remainder of the season. Increased team size,

good returns on recruited swimmers and a careful training regimen are all expected to be key contributors to
improved showings. Though hesitant to make concrete
predictions of his team's chances, interim coach Dan
Dakus said, "A combination of the leadership of the upper-

classmen and a great freshman class make me think that
the women can defend their record and there's no question
that the men are in a position to improve from last year."
Women's co-captain Lisa Ladewski 'O2 cited not only

the meet wins, but also the times recorded by swimmers
as demonstrative of the chances of the Tide to continue the
teams' sucess. "Many people on both the men's and
women's [teams] stepped up to the race and beat F&M,
swimming times that they don't usually swim until much
later in the season," she said.
But while the opening two meets have energized the
men's and women's swim teams, with the season just
begun, many see areas for improvement. "As a team, I
think we can improve on our technical stuff. We've been
doing a lot of stroke work, but that hasn't really had a
chance to carry over from practice into our meets. It seems
like we are in pretty good aerobic shape; if we can finesse
our form we should get a lot faster," said Meredith Leigh
'O4.
"This early in the season, even though we have the
drive, I think our bodies are not quite used to racing
again," Ladewski said. "I think the most important
improvement will come from getting a feel for our races at
these first meets so that we can get all the inefficiencies
ironed out."
Swim team members hope to implement these improvements, as well as to carry the momentum of strong finishes in the Franklin and Marshall meets into their next conference meet at Western Maryland on Nov. 17.

SCOTT KUSHNER
Out of Left Field

Semi sequitur
While most of you are out there "studying," "writing papers" and
"graduating", I just daydream about sports. Here are some snippets of
what goes through my mind instead of "what will I be doing with my
life in seven months?"
First, a few words about the incredible baseball season that was
Lifelong Red Sox fan Matt Damon says he rooted for the Yankees during
the World Series. I guess this means it would be trendy for me to say I
did the same. To say I was able to renounce my hatred for the Yankees.
To say I was overcome with sentimentality and my heart went out to
New York. I didn't, I couldn't and I wasn't. I took great pleasure in seeing the Yanks fail on such a grand scale. I guess I'm just callous. In the
words of John Sterling, "Thaaa Yankees lose. Thaaaaaaa YANkees lose."
Leave it to Bud Selig to try to ride the wave of a wonderful World
Series into an excuse to alienate baseball fans for the second time in
seven years. Hey Bud, if you're gonna cut a team, why not cut your
Brewers? At least the Twins are good every 10 years.
If there is another baseball strike or equivalent breakdown in player-owner relations, we no longer have a Cal Ripkenesque streak to save
baseball. Here's to Sammy Sosa hitting 100 homers.
Of course, if Bonds' record goes down anytime soon they're gonna
need to find a new record to pursue. Maybe Major League Baseball can
shorten the distance between first and second to 80 feet so Ichiro, Roger
Cedeno and Juan Pierre can chase after the single season stolen base
record (138, Hugh Nicol... thanks Ted).
A message to Jason Giambi: Stay in Oakland. Please. Pretty please
with whipped cream and a cherry on top. Damn you Big Mac, first you
leave us and now you try to take us down with you. I still love you big
guy, just leave Giambi alone, would ya?
An excerpt from Rickey Henderson's acceptance speech for the commissioner's award: "I would like to thank baseball fans of America
because American baseball fans are the greatest baseball fans in
....

...

America. Baseball fans, you have made America the greatest America in
all of American baseball. America baseball fans baseball America thank
you fans America baseball greatest. God bless America." Ummm
...

you're welcome?

The NationalFootball League is really the most ridiculous league in
professional sports because it's the only one in which being named a
"favorite" is the death knell for your team.
Is anybody else worried that the winner of the NFC East might actually have a losing record? I can see it now
the Redskins somehow
sneak into the playoffs with a 7-9 record while the pre-season Super
Bowl pick Buccaneers miss out with a 10-6 record. Ugh.
This week, Terrell Davis went under the knife for the umpteenth time
in the last 2 years. It's a shame that TD, once a 2000 yard rusher and
Super Bowl MVP, is now a VIP at the local orthoscopic surgeon's office.
Good call by Mike Shannahan giving him the rock 33 times right after he
came back from his latest injury. If/when I ever coach, I'll be sure to run
my star player into retirement rather than coaxing him along gingerly.
My fantasy football team is falling well short of my expectations. But
I shall not bore you with the details of who I drafted in the eighth round
or who I picked up off of waivers last Thursday cough
Janoff.
Not that this has anything to do with sports, but Mario Lopez, of
"Saved by the Bell"/A.C. Slater fame, is now co-hosting a men's daytime talk show called "The Other Half' with Dick Clark and Danny
Bonaduce. As a teen idol, Lopez used to pin opponents on the wrestling
mat at Bayside High. Last week I saw him exclaim in an all-too-gleeful
voice, "Guess who we're having on the show tomorrow, guys
Richard Simmons!" Slater is gay?!?! Next you're gonna tell me that
Kelly Kapowski is fat, Zack Morris is on NYPD Blue, Screech is still at
Bayside and Jesse Spano is an exotic dancer (tear drops).
Back to sports and the FANterrible National Basketball
Association. (Yawn) the NBA season started a couple weeks ago (yawn).
Wake me for the Lakers' celebration.
I've decided I hate the NBA. I'm not sure what finally sent me over
the edge, but it was probably something having to do with: being a
Warrior fan, being force-fed Vince Carter as a superstar, a gaggle of illegitimate children, Ewing's daily "Planet of the Apes" impression, being
depressed because all the lottery picks are younger than me and a regular season that means squat because everybody makes the playoffs. Oh,
and seeing Dream Team 3 strut around like the Harlem Globetrotters
and then almost lose to Lithuania at the Olympics didn't help either.
At least Jordan is back. But for some reason, watching him miss 30
of 35 shots just isn't as magical as it once was.
And finally, hockey... (cricket chirp
owl h00t... pin
frog croak
drop rolling tumbleweed.)

BY EMILY GRAY AND CAITLIN RYLAND
The tallest women on campus, who just so happen to be the defending national champions (made
'ya look!) or rather, defending Centennial
Conference Champions, are back in action this season and looking to fight like hell to keep the trophy.
The Swarthmore women's basketball team will
kick off the 2001-2002 season with a bang this weekend as they host the annual Swarthmore Tip-Off
Tournament and dazzle crowds with the hottest
new warm-up suits this side of the Blue Route. You
may have noticed some choice additions to the
decor in the gymnasium as of late (perhaps on your
way to men's club volleyball practice), as in the
GIANT 2001 conference championship banner
hanging proudly from the rafters. Although this

banner marks the accomplishments of last year's
record-breaking season, the women o' the Tide are

far from complacent.
While the ranks may have changed and the
team has lost its senior sentinel, Heather
Marandola 'Ol, and their corporal in the post, Sarah
Tufano 'O3, to foreign lands, a score of new recruits
have marched in to spur on the troops. Ali Furman
'O3 claims, "the freshmen are going to add a muchneeded level of depth to our team. They have a good
balance of athleticism, skill and coachability." Who
are these uniformed strangers to Tarble Pavilion?
Let's meet the lineup: at this point, the Garnet Tide
welcomes two freshmen hailing from Maryland,
Tedi "T-Bone" Asher 'O5, and Katie "Ammo"
Morrison 'O5, while Kristen "Shoot da' lights out"
