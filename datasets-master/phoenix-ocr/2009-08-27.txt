Chopp ushered into new presidency with Class of '13
President Rebecca Chopp claims she never thought she'd
be where she is now. Or where she's been.
"I grew up in the 50s, and I grew up in the middle of
Kansas," she said. "I always imagined that I'd have nine
children and I'd be very involved in civic community and
community theater."
Chopp, who is starting her first year as the college's fourteenth president, has had an illustrious career, from
ordained minister to college professor, from dean of Yale
Divinity School to president of Colgate University. She sat
down with Assistant News Editor Dante Fuoco to answer
questions about hopes for the future, lessons from the past,
her personal passion, and what she loves about
Swarthmore.

Dante Fuoco: What excites you about this upcoming year?
As each student at the college has been asked in his or her

application, 'Why Swarthmore?'"
Rebecca Chopp: I think what excites me is getting to
know the students and the faculty and the staff. I'm excited
to welcome the class of2013, but for me, the sophomores, juniors, and seniors are also new. So, I'm really looking forward
to getting to know the students. I'm looking forward to
attending arts events, athletic events, hearing debates. I
look forward to seeing the work that students and faculty
members are doing through the Lang Center.
So, "Why Swarthmore?" I think, for me, as I look at the
landscape of higher education and undergraduate education, Swarthmore really represents the finest of the values of
liberal arts education. Swarthmore cultivates a rich intellectual life for students and for faculty. It's committed to
educating individuals to contribute to the common good,
which I think is extremely important. And I think it has this
very distinct community life that is threaded through with
the values very important for the 21st century.

DF: Since you started on July I are there any new initiatives or ideas going on at the college? Any that youd like to
see?

RC: One of the new ideas that has been going on in the
and I don't quite know when it started, but I
believe it's relatively new
is the focus on wellness for the
college

students. In fact, yesterday I heard someone starting to call
it "Swellness," which is kind of fun [laughs]. And I want
very much to support that. I'd be trying to link that with the
whole notion of sustainable living, which combines the
emphasis on living with the earth in a sustainable fashion,
simple living, which is a value out of the Quaker tradition
that Swarthmore was founded [and] relevant to these financial times, and healthy living, which was also a big focus for
the Quakers. So I think that's a very important initiative for
the school, and I think we can have a lot offun with that and
do a lot of great things.
DF: What principles and values at Swarthmore would you

like to maintain?
RC: The notion of responsibility for individual convic*

tions, individual judgments. The Quaker founders talked
abdut this as "minding the light." And it's an interesting
phrase because it means always being skeptical of one's own
position as well as others'
really going through rigorous
reflection and not just accepting easily one's prejudgments
or prejudices or those of those others'. And that's combined

at Swarthmore, and in our tradition, with the high value of
community and a sense that one learns about oneself only
through engaging others. That, to me, is one of the most
important. A second value is that life is about service to others and building the common good. Our school has this
absolutely phenomenal history of being founded by people
like Elias Hicks and Lucrietta Mott, who were radical suffragists and abolitionists.... They believed in the equality of
others and thus had to create a more just society so everyone could exercise of their rights and have a life of flourishing.
DF: What lessons or experiences would you like to carry
over from your time as president at Colgate?
RC: I think the importance of collaboration with the
whole community. At Colgate we did a very ambitious
strategic plan. And we formed that plan and executed that
plan through a lot of collaboration with the staff and the
community and the students, so I've seen how much better
it is to have that kind of collaboration and that everyone's

that. I think the other thing that I'll probably bring from

one of my favorite things from Colgate
Colgate's personality combined academic seriousness with
a lot of fun and a kind of zest and enthusiasm for living. And
I learned a lot about how to combine those things and take
pleasure in athletics and arts and hanging out.
DF: Both professionally and personally, what are you pas-

sionate about?
RC: Professionally, at this stage in my life, I'm passionate
about helping other people pursue their passions. I think
that's what education is for helping students learn the art
of passion and the science of passion and the skills and
determination and research skills and execution skills and
hard work. I'm passionate about that for students, but also
for faculty and for staff. I am a great lover of the arts, and I'm
very happy to be in a school with such strong arts programs
and in a city with great arts programs and close to New York
and Washington D.C. I've never been in a school with a
dance program, and I love dance, so I'm very excited about
that. And I'm fairly passionate about fitness
I work out
everyday. And then I'm a passionate reader. I just like to
read novels, philosophy, history.
DF: What would make your perfect day?
RC: It'd probably start with a long hike in Crum Woods
and then maybe a breakfast or coffee with faculty and
administrators working on a project, maybeplanning a project of sustainability. I won't say the students for breakfast
because they're probably asleep [laughs]. Then, I'd love to

I can't imagine a day in my life without a lot ofadministrative meetings, so I'd probably have this great day on the
budget and come up with all sorts of win-win solutions. And
then I might run into some Swarthmore alumni the alumni here are fascinating. Maybe I'd go to Bennet Lorber's art
exhibition at the Muse. Bennett Lorber is an epidemiologist

"We just wantto have a steady stream of

A $7 local cheese plate will be the most

a coffee roaster of choice last month.

BURSTING THE SWARTHMORE BUBBLE
Philly's

BY ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

Though you probably won't tire of your new
home for quite a while, it's not called the
"Swarthmore bubble" for nothing. So, when the
urge for a change of pace hits, here are a few offcampus attractions for your consideration.
Of course, the obvious jumping-off point for
an off-campus adventure is nearby Philadelphia.

History Museum to the Franklin Institute
Science Museum. A ways offfrom the parkway
is the less prominent but absolutely fascinating
Mutter Museum of various medical oddities
that gave this writer a newfound appreciation
for his perfectly mundane body. Back in Old
City, the area's art galleries hold free open houses on First Friday, the first Friday of every
month from 5 to 9 p.m.
If your Swat-stuffed schedule only allows for
a thirty-minute trip, the college's surrounding
suburban setting still has its options. Showcase
Comics is the generic comic book store that
every downtown college town is obligated to
have. Sad to say, it's not in the Borough of
Swarthmore but in sister town, Bryn Mawr. The
same goes for the Bryn Mawr Film Institute,
which plays new limited-release films as well as
revisiting random classics and occasionally is a
venue for Philly's film festivals. Take the Tri-Co

Shuttle from outside Bond Hall and visit our
Haverford and Bryn Mawr counterparts while
you're at it. But be warned! The Tri-Co Shuttle
gets a tad complex on the weekends, so plan
wisely.

While the Swarthmore's "Ville" may underwhelm, the Borough can take pride in its community theater scene in the Players Club of
Swarthmore, which is a mere five minutes away
off of Chester Road. This season, the Players Club
is doing productions of Neil Simon's "Rumors,"
Sondheim's "Into the Woods" and "Doubt," among
others. Only a little farther is another well-kept .theater secret, the Hedgerow Theatre in the adjacent
town, Media. For much cheaper than a play in
Philly, these theater groups are a refreshing
reminder there's tons of talent outside the city as
well.
And as you inevitably tire of the Appetizer,
Picnic, and Pasta Bar rotation (you'll be wellacquainted soon), you'll want to venture out to the
surrounding area to find something edible. And so
the quest lies in your hands, intrepid first-year. Go
forth, explore and burst through that bubble.

A FIRST-YEAR'S GUIDE TO EATING AT SWARTHMORE
BY IVANA NG
ingL@swarthmore.edu

Before you even set foot on campus, you had probably already heard about Swarthmore's notoriously bad
food. Inreality, it is not as bad as it is monotonous. The
on-campus options are limited, and they become nonexistent past midnight. The off-campus options leave
something to be desired, but in desperate times, greasy
Chinese take-out will do for most students. Here, we
discuss where you can find food on campus, in the Ville
and on Baltimore Pike at all hours of the day—before 1
a.m.
the mainstay
As Swarthmore's sole dining hall, Sharpies has in
recent years buckled under the pressure of the annually increasing student population. At dinnertime, long
lines extending out of the atrium can form as early as
5:30. Every day there is a specialty "bar" at lunch and
dinner. One of the most popular bars, perhaps because
it is viewed as "safe," is the pasta bar, which is available Wednesday and Sunday nights. Other crowdpleasers include Mandarin chicken salad bar (a
lunchtime exclusive), Vietnamese pho bar and wing
bar. Besides the specialty bar, which changes every
day, a sandwich bar, salad bar, vegetarian bar and the
grill are available. At the grill, Donny can whip you up
a mouthwatering cheesesteak sandwich when nothing
else seems appealing.
Sharpies

Tarble a guilty alternative
Housed in Tarble (where the bookstore is also located), Essie Mae's is the deep-fried alternative to
Sharpies. Greasy chicken fingers, oily curly fries,

.

decent burgers, tasty cheesesteaks and fattening
TastyKakes treats abound. If you're jonesin' for an
omelet, burger or cheesesteak wrap, take note: the grill
is only open during certain hours of the day.
Also located in Tarble is Paces Cafe. It is the only
student-run eatery on campus and is open on certain
nights each semester, depending on employees' availability. Freshly baked goods and desserts, quesadillas
and smoothies are some of the highlights of this laidback spot.

Coffee bars for on-the-go lifesavers
There are two on-campus coffee bars: one in
Kohlberg and another in the Science Center. Grab a cup
of joe and a freshly baked muffin (flavors vary by day)
for breakfast at either bar. The pretzels and hummus at
Kohlberg make for a light yet satisfying lunch, but steer
clear of the iced chai and smoothies. The Science
Center Coffee Bar also offers a popular range of fresh
sushi, chicken fried rice and lo mein, but they sell out
early during the lunchtime rush.
The Ville an assortment of go-tos
Renato's Pizza and Cheng Hing, both located in the
Ville, are a Swattie's first defense against late-night
hunger pangs. Renato's pizza is not particularly good,
but it does the job at a good price. Get the student special a large cheese pie and a large soda for a mere
$8.99. Decent Chinese food, hefty portions and low
prices make Cheng Hing a popular and dependable latenight option for students. Both restaurants deliver to
campus and are open till 11 on weekdays; on weekends,
Renato's is open till 1 a.m. and Cheng Hing, till midnight. For those in the mood for sugary, albeit stale,
treats, Dunkin' Donuts is open till 10 p.m.

August 27, 2009

Outside Swarthmore for mainstream tastes
Beyond the Ville, there are several pizzerias and
Chinese restaurants, along with a few chains. 320
Market, on South Chester Road, is a tad pricey, but
its homemade tortilla chips and pico de gallo are
well worth it. Happy Wok, another Chinese restaurant frequented by Swatties, is located next door.
Open until 10:30 p.m. on weekdays and 11 p.m. on
Fridays and Saturdays, this Asian eatery is not much
for ambiance, so it's best to stick with take-out.
If you're willing to shell out an extra buck or two,
Peace-A-Pizza, located on the Pike, is also highly recommended. They deliver quickly, and their pizza is
much better than Renato's. When pizza and Chinese
food become monotonous, there are a few reliable
chains on the Pike, including Bertucci's (Italian), Pei
Wei (Asian) and Qdoba (Mexican). Make sure to
check out Heng's Thai too. Though it is expensive,
it's a good Thai restaurant, with a sizeable sushi
menu.

Other resources for the frugal and self-sufficient
Seeking variety in your culinary experience here
at Swarthmore costs money, but there are a few
ways to save. For those who are handy in the
kitchen, stock up on groceries at the Co-Op in the
Ville, or Genuardi's on the Pike (the Target shuttle
stops here). There are also plenty of opportunities
for free food on campus
club meetings, lectures
and Parlor Parties attract half their audiences with
promises of pizza and other non-Sharpies foods.
Just keep in mind that when you wear out all
these options (or if you're low on cash), Sharpies
will be waiting for you with open arms.

CAPTURED MOMENT

If I could send just one message
back in time to myself two years ago, it
would be: "It gets better. Seriously."
Because if one thing about freshman year is at all clear to me now, it's

that Orientation was an awful experience. For all their good intentions, the Orientation Committee con-

tinually fails to recognize one simple truth: not a single person in
the universe actually enjoys an entire week of contrived mingling
with a group of arbitrarily selected people who you probably won'
speak to after the first week of classes
and what the fuck is with
the Trust Walk, anyway?

If I could send just one message back in
time to-myself two years ago, it would be:
"It gets better. Seriously."
So, class of 2013, you get to hear the message I was never fortunate enough to receive: It gets better. Seriously.
But apparently not for me. Because in four short weeks, I, too, will be
going through Orientation. Only this time, it'll be me and twenty-four
other American college juniors being oriented with several hundred
British freshmen, .in a bonanza Oxford University calls "Freshers
Week." And if I enjoy it any bit as much as I did my Swarthmore orientation, I suspect my parents will block me on Skype for complaining too
much approximately two days after I leave the country.
My editors at The Phoenix, though, don't have the luxury of
ignoring me, which explains this column's existence. In biweekly
installments, I'll be sending over thrilling tales of English culture
shock and study abroad shenanigans (to the extent to which
shenanigans can be had at Oxford; I'm not convinced they're even a
possibility). And while I'm decidedly skeptical about "Freshers
Week," I'm hoping the whole experience will, at the very least, turn
into an amusing article or two in the newspaper. Here's to hoping.

Mullarkey in running for NCAA Woman of the Year
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DANNY FRIEL

dfriell@swarthmore.edu

Caitlin Mullarkey 'O9 was the poster-girl for
athletics at Swarthmore for much of her
career, which she capped with a senior year
that boasted two All-America awards and a
Rhodes scholarship.
Then she graduated.
But she isn't done yet.
In July, Mullarkey garnered the Centennial
Conference's nomination to the prestigious
NCAA Woman of the Year contest, an annual
program that awards one female student-athlete across all sports and all three divisions
with a coveted title. 132 conferences emerged
from the application process with a nomination.
Two weeks ago, the field was narrowed to 30
10 nominees from each division.
-

As listed on NCAA Web site, "The NCAA
Woman of the Year Award honors senior student-athletes who have distinguished themselves throughout their collegiate careers in
the areas of academic achievement, athletics
excellence, service and leadership."
The list of past recipients is an impressive
one, including Olympians and world-record
holders. 13 of the last 15 winners have come
from Division I institutions.
In September, the field will be narrowed to a
pool of 10 finalists, from which one winner will
be chosen. The 2009 NCAA Woman of the Year
will be announced on October 18 at a reception
hosted by the NCAA in Indianapolis.
In the meantime, Mullarkey will occupy
herself with a minor distraction preparing to
pursue her Master of Science degree in integrated immunology at Oxford University in the
United Kingdom.

Favored men's soccer ranked and ready to rumble

The men's soccer team warms up on Clothier field during a practice session on Wednesday night.

A year ago, the men's soccer team had
never appeared in the final of the
Centennial Conference tournament, let
alone won the title.
By the end of the 2008 season, however,
the Garnet had not only won the
Centennial Conference title but had propelled all the way to the Sweet 16 round of
the NCAA Division 111 tournament and
hosted the first three rounds of the tournament on the campus of Swarthmore
College.

Earlier this month, Swarthmore was
selected in the Centennial Conference
pre-season poll to repeat as champions.
The Garnet received four of ten firstplace votes in the poll, as did Johns
Hopkins, who fell to the Garnet in the 2008
championship final by a score of 1-0.
But by virtue of votes for minor placing, Swarthmore edged out Hopkins as
the pre-season favorites.
"They're kind of grudgingly giving us
the nod," head coach Eric Wagner said of
the poll results.
While the 2009 season has yet terkick
off, the Garnet is eager to make good on
this shaky endorsement.
"Our motivation right now is to prove
it's not a fluke," Wagner said of last year's

surprise victory.

Indeed, it was Hopkins and Franklin &
Marshall who were ranked in the NSCAA
pre-season poll last year.
Few expected Swarthmore to come out
on top of the conference.
"[Winning the conference championship] was. never something we discussed," Wagner admitted. Reaching the
Sweet 16, he said, was equally unexpected.
The
National
Soccer
Coaches
Association of America granted the
Garnet a ranking of 13 in the 2009 pre-season poll. Hopkins is ranked 16th.
This year, the soccer team isn't taking
anything for granted. A dozen first-years,
have been training with the team for the
past two weeks. Wagner describes the
large group as "hard-working, with quite
a bit of talent" and as "committed and

12

experienced," which are ideal attributes
for a program that prides itself on its
unyielding depth.
Though the Garnet lost a talented
including All-American Jeff
bunch
Kushner, star midfielder Ladule Lako Lo
Sarah and leading-scorer Evan Nesterak
'O9 to graduation in May, this year's roster,
which
Wagner will finalize by the end of
the week, will be
chock full of veteran returners.

The start of the 2009 season will likely

also mark the heavily anticipated return
of decorated goalkeeper Zach Weimar 10.
Wagner looks to rely heavily on the
sophomore class, who were a pleasant
surprise last season.
"They hit the
ground running.

is to prove it's not a fluke."

Indeed, combined with a rich

pool of incoming
talent, Wagner
has the necessary
tools to

return his squad to the championship.
"We have confidence, but not arrogance," Wagner said. "If we do it again, it
will be because they put in the extra

work." Swarthmore is slated to face several worthy opponents over the course of
the regular season in order to put such
hard work to the test.
In addition to facing a wealth of formidable conference opponents, including the
Blue Jays and fellow 2008 NCAA qualifier
Dickinson College, the Garnet will host #2

to campus on Saturday, August 29 for an
annual scrimmage with the current
squad.

Swarthmore will open Centennial
