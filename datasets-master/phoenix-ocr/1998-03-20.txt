ment.

Three laptop computers belonging to students
were stolen from carrels in McCabe library on
Monday and Wednesday. In each incident, a student had left his or her laptop unattended for a
period of time and found it missing upon return.
Though the three incidents are similar in nature,
it is unclear at this time whether a single perpetrator is responsible or whether they are in any
way related.
While there are no suspects as of yet, Swarthmore Public Safety is fairly certain that the thief,
or thieves, are not Swarthmore students. They do
have a description of a possible suspect, but is
not at liberty to give it out.
According to Libby Amann, CirculationLibrarian at McCabe, at about 2:30 p.m. on Monday, a
student approached her and reported his laptop
stolen after having left it for 15 minutes. A second student, who had left her carrel at 1 p.m.,

came back at about 6 p.m. to find her laptop missing. The third victim, who had left her computer
during the middle of the day on Wednesday, also
returned to find it missing.
"It's very upsetting," Amann said of the incidents. She emphasized that "it's extremely foolish for students to leave anything as valuable as a
laptop... on a carrel," especially for long periods
of time.
The three students who lost laptops were Doug
Rouse '9B, Ahsiya Posner '9B, and Anne Holinjured.

Public Safety Vows Thorough Investigation

Holland, whose computer was stolen on
Wednesday, might have the greatest chance
of recovering it. Public Safety is investigating reports of a man who tried to leave
the library without checking his bag at approximately 1 p.m. on Wednesday. According to McCabe receptionist Anna
Agenbroad, the man told another receptionist he had "forgotten something" and returned into the library when he was informed that patrons were expected to show
the contents of their bags when exiting. "He
was gone less than five minutes," estimates
Agenbroad, "and when he came back, his
bag was empty." The suspicion is that the
man returned to the stacks and stashed the
stolen computer somewhere before bringing his bag back to be checked.
However, Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave explains that they are not necessarily considering the man an official suspect. "It could have been totally coincidental that he happened to be there at that time,"
notes Redgrave, but adds, "That's not to say
we didn't investigate it."
Holland told The Phoenix that she would
be searching the library withthe help ofPublic Safety Thursday after closing. "They told
me my laptop might still be in the library.
We're going tonight at midnight with Public Safety to check if it's there." According
to Holland, she and Public Safety have already searched some sections of the library
for her Compaq, but there are many different places where the possible suspect could
have hidden it.
Agenbroad describes the possible suspect
as being in his thirties. "We know he wasn't
a student. He was older than a student," she
says. According to Agenbroad, the library

Activist Lectures on Underground Abortion Network
by Emily Shartin
On Wednesday night Swarthmore got a glimpse
into a piece of women's history with a screening
of the film "Jane: An Abortion Service" by Kate
Kirtz and Neil Lundy. Laura Kaplan, author of the
book The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service, presented the
video and spoke about her own experiences as a
member of the collective.
From 1968 to 1973, the 125 members of Jane
performed nearly 12,000 illegal abortions for
women in Chicago. The organization folded soon
after the Supreme Court legalized abortion with
its decision in the case ofRoe v. Wade twenty-five
years ago.
Through personal interviews with former members of Janeand various women who accessed its
services, the 1995 film traces the origins of the
underground organization from its inception as a
student network providing information about
where to get safe abortions to its eventual incarnation as a collective that performed those safe abortions itself.
Members of Jane first worked with a contracted
abortionist from whom they began to learn the
trade. A number of women in the film noted the
disbelief and shock that emerged when they discovered that this abortionist was in fact not an M.D.

Kaplan explained that while a number of women
quit Jane upon learning this, others simply felt that
if he could do this work, they could too. She admitted that today this probably sounds rather outrageous, but claimed that many Jane members
viewed their radical involvement with the organization in a very matter-of-fact fashion.
"You don't agonize about whether or not you can
do it," said Kaplan. "You do as much as you can,
then the next day you do a bit more and a bit more...
Part of this whole movement was about empowering ourselves by saying, 'We don't need experts.'"
Janemembers, who were often just out of college,
helped women induce miscarriage and eventually
began performing "D & C" or dilation and curettage, a standard abortion procedure.
In her talk, Kaplan noted that before various social justice movements began in a lousy position...
They were both silenced and silent" and never
talked about anything remotely personal. With the
advent of the women's liberation movement in the
late 1960s and early 19705, women began talking
politically about their own lives, and one of the
concerns that emerged was access to safe, legal
abortions.
Both Kaplan and women in the film explained
that when abortion was illegal, women seeking to
terminate a pregnancy were often sexually harassed
or propositioned for sex by abortion doctors. They

were often charged exorbitant amounts of money
by doctors who then fled without performing the
abortion. After undergoing botched abortions, many
women did not go to the hospital for fear of exposure or threats from hospital workers. These were
all circumstances that members of Jane sought to
protect women from.
"We saw abortion as a potential place for positive
change in a woman's life," she said, explaining that
Jane tried to impress uponits customers that ifthey
could make the decision to have an illegal abortion, then they could make any difficult decision.
In May of 1972, members of Jane were arrested
by Chicago homicide cops, but only ended up
spending 24 hours in jail. When the Roe v. Wade
decision was handed down in January of 1973, Jane
was performing nearly 300 abortions a week. While
the organization continued to help everyone who
contacted them until a Chicago injunction on abortions was lifted in March of 1973, one woman in
the film conceded that working for Jane often
seemed like "too much responsibility at too early
an age."
But Kaplan is living proof that many Jane members view their work, radical though it may have
been, as some of the most important of their lives.
As one member of Jane noted in the film, "It's a
testament to women's ability to work together and
accomplish something."

Dean Search Nears Completion; Candidates To Visit
by Nate Stulman
Four finalists have been selected for the position of Dean of the College. The committee responsible for the selection process expects the
College to name the new Dean by the end of April.
In a separate search, an offer has been extended
for the position of College Librarian to Peggy
Seiden, currently College Librarian at Skidmore
College.
The four finalists for the Dean position are Mark
Erickson, currently Dean of Students at Lehigh
University; Alma Clayton-Pedersen, presently Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs
at the Peabody College ofVanderbilt; Acting Dean
of Swarthmore College Bob Gross; and John
DeGioia, now the Vice-President and Chief Administrative Officer for Georgetown University.
DeGioia has previously served as Dean of
Georgetown as well.
The candidates will visit campus in the next several weeks to meet with various constituencies including the Dean's Search Committee, which is
chaired by Biology Professor Mark Jacobs, numerous student groups, and members of the Administration. Gross will make his "visit" March
23 and 24; Erickson is scheduled for March 30
and 31; DeGioia, on April 2 and 3; and Clayton-

Pedersen, for April 9 and 10.
The Dean Search Committee plans to consider
the views of members of the college community in
deciding on its April recommendation to the President. Committee member Hugh Weber 'OO stressed
the extent to which students have been involved in
the selection process thus far. "In addition to the
three student representatives, we had a special committee of eight other students who participated in
the interviews of the six semi-finalists and helped
decide on the four finalists. It's really remarkable
that students have so much influence over such an
important decision," says Weber.
"The committee is very happy with the quality
of the finalists, and I think it's fair to say that both
the Dean's Search Committee of nine people and
the student committee of eight, who interviewed
each of the six semi-finalists by conference-call,
feel the selection process so far has been useful
and efficient," says Jacobs, who corroborated that
the input of students from both committees was
vital in narrowing down the pool of semi-finalists.
"The quality of the four finalists is absolutely
excellent," says committee member Josh Alloy '9B.
"There were many candidates who were very impressive; these four impressed us even more. I think
that any one would make a great Dean of the College."

The final and most important state of public participation in the search will begin next week with
the finalists' visits. "I really hope the campus gets
involved with the visits," continues Alloy. "The
committee really wants to take student opinion into
account in our decision; it's important for all parts
of the college to let us know what they think of the
finalists."
In a separate senior personnel search, the college has offered the position of College Librarian
to Peggy Seiden, presently College Librarian at
Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY. "Peggy
returned to the campus earlier this week to evaluate the position and situation more thoroughly and
to meet again with administrators. She hopes to
make a decision by the beginning of next week,"
says Amy Morrison, Acting CollegeLibrarian and
member of the Librarian's Search Committee.
At Skidmore, Seiden planned and managed a
major building renovation and expansion, both of
which are potential solutions to the library's looming space problems. In addition, says Morrison,
"Peggy would bring to the College a depth of experience in information resource organizational
management, an understanding of the academic information environment, and experience in strategic planning and developing collaborations with

The "New" Student Council
In recent weeks, the "New" Student Council, as it has billed itself, has
already succeeded in achieving two of its initial goals, the extension of
library hours and Tarble credit. In both cases, the former status quo was
inequitable and much muttered about, though grudgingly accepted as an
unpleasant and difficultfact of Swarthmore life. By extending library hours
until 2 a.m. and full Tarble credit until 9:30 p.m., the Student Council has
put the desires of large sections of the student body into action. In so
doing it has proven that it is a force in achieving changes to better the life
of its constituents and that it is accountable to them in so doing, the hallmarks of a successful representative body.
Extending McCabe hours to 2 a.m. was a responsible initiative by Student Council that demonstrates to the College community the Council's
commitment and motivation. A quiet environment in which to study is not
a luxury, but rather a necessity, especially at the nation's top college. At
Swarthmore, this necessity was lacking until Student Council made the
effort to effect a much-needed, long overdue change. When McCabe's
doors shut at midnight, students' only option for a sometimes-quiet place
to study on campus was Kohlberg lounge, an often social and noisyspace
without access to important resources. At an institution so committed to
the pursuit ofacademic excellence, the Kohlberg lounge was unacceptable
as the sole study space on campus after midnight. During this time, dorm
rooms are often not conducive to studying as socializing comes to replace
reading and, as a result, the noise level on halls significantly increases. The
practice of closing the library so early is especially unacceptable when one
considers that that other competitive colleges and universities frequently
provide their students with 24 hours of quiet library workspace each day.
Anyone who has ever arrived late from an athletic event or conference
has had to face the unwelcome and sudden shrinkage of their Tarble credit
at 8:00 pm. This drop in credit after the first hour of Tarble dinner had the
further unpleasant effect on concentrating Tarble diners during the single
hour of full credit, leading to half-hour long lines. Besides causing discontent, the lines made it easier for people to pilfer food from the cafeteria
while in line, evincing both disregard and disgust for what they felt were
unsatisfactory policies. Fortunately through more acceptable means, the
Student Council responded to organized campus interest in the form of
SURFS (Swarthmore United to Reform Food Services) and acted upon the
views of the community. Withcredit extended for an extra hour and a half,
the lines have diminished greatly, saving staff members stress and students
time.
In both these instances, the Student Council saw a campus problem that
desperately needed to be addressed and worked steadily until it was resolved. Through this efficient action, the Council demonstrated to the Swarthmore community its ability to get things done and increase Student
Council's role as a proactive, progressive force on campus. It is our hope
that the Council continues the most of its vital position an effective liason
between students and the administration for which it deserves the greatest commendation.

Clarification on Free Ad Policy
weeks, we have received an increasing number of requests for
free advertising. Our policy for handling on-campus advertising submissions is as follows: All free ads will take second priority to articles and
paid ads, and are not guaranteed to print. Whether or not we decide to use
an ad hinges entirely upon the particular layout considerations ofthat week.
Requests will be accepted on a first come, first serve basis. The waiting list
will be a cumulative one i.e. an ad receiving top priority this week which
does not make the paper will continue to receive first priority the following week, unless it is evident that the ad has expired or we receive further
instructions from the party responsible for the submission.
All ads will only run for one week, unless specified otherwise. New ads
will take precedence over ongoing ones after the first week they are run.
Advance requests will automatically receive top billing on the week requested. The ranking order may also be shifted depending on how well
each ad fits into our leftover space.

In the process of editing last week's letter to the editor titled, "Plost CarInappropriate," jointly submitted by Ari Plost '9B et. al., we cut out
the last two sentences by mistake. The entire text should have read:

Phoenix. Rather than representing Ari's argument in a productive academic debate, the
Phoenix editors instead chose to publish a personal and malicious attack on Ari. We also feel
it is inappropriate for a student newspaper to engage in attacks on private/unelected individual students. We request an apology for the Phoenix's personal attack. Such an apology,
because ofthe magnitude of the cartoon, should be placed in the newspaper as well as in an
all campus e-mail.
Ari never advocated censorship. Instead, Ari believed that the letter by Bradley Smith
should not have been printed because it is offensive and insensitive. While one may disagree
with Ari on this point, his argument never fell under the category of censorship.
By depicting Ari's position as censorship, you have not only misrepresented him, but created an atmosphere ofmisunderstanding on campus. We believe that the Phoenix, at its own
expense, should bring to campus a representative of the Anti-Defamation League who can
address the distinction between censorship and ethical journalistic consideration.

The Phoenix is published weekly by the students of Swarthmore College, except

N. Ireland: First Peace, Then Freedom
Throughout both Britain and Ireland,
history is extensively invoked and is vital
to the understanding of the contemporary
"Troubles" Northern Ireland. For example,
every July 12 members of the Protestant
Orange Orders celebrate the victory of the
Protestant William 111 at the Battle of the
Boyne, the final blow to Irish resistance
to British colonialism. For Irish nationalists, the battle represents the defeat of their
aspirations and the beginning of the darkest years of British rule, while for loyalists (those who support British sovereignty
over Northern Ireland) it represents the beginning of their ascendancy. Each year
with the marches, these sentiments are renewed, as loyalists vociferously (sometimes with threats of violence) demand to
the right to march through Catholic areas
celebrating their victory. Last year, the
issue grew especially heated when no decision was reached on whether the Order
could march through the nationalist
Garvaghy Road. The morning of the
march, members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary removed protesting residence
through violent means, wounding several,
so that the march could pass. The British
Secretary for Northern Ireland, Marjorie
"Mo" Mowlam it turned out, had made a
deal with the Order that if no agreement
had been reached by a certain date, the
march would proceed with R.U.C. protection. The story of the march is the story of
the Troubles. Irish nationalists immediately noted that the incident was only the
latest in a series of violent acts perpetrated
by government forces against civilians.
The R.U.C, a largely Protestant organization, is thedescendant of the Royal Irish
Constabulary, which was notorious for the
atrocities it committed against civilians
during the Irish Revolution. After the separation ofIreland into the North and the Republic, the R.U.C. had treated Protestants
preferentially and discriminated against
Catholics, trends that have continued in
sectors of life ranging from voting rights
to education to employment. The bloodying of unarmed protestors brought back
memories of Bloody Sunday, the 1972
massacre of thirteen unarmed Catholic
protestors against discrimination which
along with ensuing acquittal of the soldiers
involved, led to the intensification of the
Troubles, which have claimed 3,235 lives
to date. Loyalists saw opposition to the
march as opposition to their hegemony
over the North which they are, like any
ruling group, loathe to give up. Above all,
the march illustrates the division between
the two groups in the North and the failure of the talks.
Nationalists who cite the history of discrimination the Irish have suffered at the
hands of the British begin their arguments

parties have refused to participate in the
peace process, while the Ulster Unionist
Party has done so but refused to negotiate
with Sinn Fein (the political arm of the
1.R.A.). The violent and historical dislike
of the two sides has kept the current peace
talks (whose establishment and shaky
cease-fire are no mean feat in themselves)
as little more than an ongoing discussion
of procedure.
In a modern European Union in which
even such old foes as France and Germany
are seeking to integrate, the ongoing schism
is an especially appalling one. Much of the
border remains militarized, and the North's
economy continues to decline even while
thoseof the Republic and United Kingdom
boom. Belfast has gone from an industrial
center to being synonymous with the
North's sectarian strife.
As the United Kingdom attempts to remove the last vestiges of its colonialist past
and along with Ireland merge into Europe,
it should examine its first and last colony.
The Labor government of Tony Blair has
taken steps to do so, issuing an apology
(though one that for the most part denies
responsibility) for the Potato Famine of
1845-1847, reasonably viewed by many

where marchers protested both widespread
discrimination against Catholics and imprisonment without charges being

illustrates this continuing history. The
Widgery Commission came to the decision
that there was no evidence ofBritish military wrongdoing despite extensive evidence. In this decision nationalists saw the

such evidence to bolster recruiting, the
I.R.A. developed into its notorious current
incarnation. Loyalist groups responded in

the most recent spate ofkillings, the R.U.C.
claimed to have difficulty in finding who
had committed loyalist acts of terrorism
while easily linking the I.R.A. to two murders. Regardless of the particulars of these
cases, this discrepancy fits into an established pattern cited by both nationalists and

Swatties Return to Norris Square for
Spring Break Service Project
by Alma Ortiz
This spring break, sixteen Swarthmore students and one Bryn
Mawr student lent their time to help out at the Norris Square
community center in North Philadelphia. From Sunday until
Wednesday afternoon, the students stayed at the center and
helped to renovate a house that will eventually become part of
an extension to the center. They also interacted with the community kids, helping them with their homework and taking them
on tours of Chinatown and South Street.
The Spring Break Service Project is a unique experience that
many students participate in a number of times. Prachi Patankar
'OO, a four-time participant and co-coordinator of this spring
break's project describes it as more than a community service
project. To her it is also a cultural experience and an opportunity to bond with the other Swarthmore participants, since they
all stay in the same house and cook for themselves for the duration of the week. When referring to the kids they help she says,
"They just love us, they look for us to come." The community
shows their extreme gratitude by cooking Puerto Rican food for
the students and teaching them about all aspects of Puerto Rican
culture.
Sue Harte, a religious advisor at Swarthmore, has been involved with the program for six years and has seen it evolve.
Harte states that students keep going back and it has turned into
a "reciprocal relationship," where both parties involved gain
the students lend service, while
something from each other
the community teaches them about their culture. According to

Harte, the program did not begin in Philadelphia. The first
few times students went outside to places like Baltimore before deciding that they wanted to go somewhere where they
could form a continuing relationship. The focus of the program was then shifted to the Norris Square community, where
Swarthmore students are now recognized by the children they
work with. Patankar says that although the kids sometimes
don't remember their names, they still remember who they
are and are happy to see them coming back.
Matt Schultz 'OO has gone back four times since his first trip
during winter break in 1996. He says, "I like to see how it
changes. I like to think it's getting better. I get inspired by the
people who are there." The community projects he has participated in include going door-to-door and installing smoke
detectors, painting an office, and helping to rebuild a house.
Last fall break he helped to plant flowers in an empty lot where
drug-dealing often occurred.
"I loved it," says Karman Mak 'OO. "It was just a really great
experience because it was refreshing." One of her fondest
memories about the intercultural experience was an aerobics
class taught with merengue music by Ricardo, a member of
the community.
When referring to the evolution of the program, Harte notes
that at the beginning it was just a service project, but now it
has evolved into a stronger, more established, cooperative service program. She says, "it's a great place...Norris Square is
really a great example of hope in the city... it shows what people
can do together."

several times, but we can't find a

times]" she said, "so we just don't
know how he got in or when he got

The three students are "deeply,
deeply hurt by these thefts," said
Lieutenant George Iredale of Public Safety. Iredale, who spoke with
Posner, remarked that she was especially distraught, because her thesis was on her computer. Posner
claims that Public Safety has told
her that there is a "less than one percent chance that [her computer] will
be retrieved," and that theirassumption is that it has already been sold.
She is particularly disturbed by the
fact that the possible suspect was

to engrave valuable possessions
with identifying information. The
department owns an engraving tool,
similar to a soldering iron, that can

Crummy Advice
THE BEAR (as told to KATIE MENZER)

..Dear Bear,
. My sister and her husband just had a baby girl.
Although I've known this day was coming for
quite some time now, I was in denialand had managed to convince myself that my sister's swollen
mid-section was due, not to a fetus, but, instead,
an excess ofTwinkies and Scooter Pies. Now that
:the little tyke is here, though, I am forced to confront the reality of the situation. After much soul
• searching, I realize my angst over the new arrival
stems from the following three concerns.
' The first is a religious conundrum. Since I am
unwilling to believe that my sister found herself
'fn this sorrowful state of pregnancy through the
conventional means, I must now admit that immaculate conception is indeed a possibility. This
greatly conflicts with my highly skeptical, atheistic tendencies. Must I know rethink my whole
ideology because my sister got knocked-up?
Second, I am reluctant to give up my title as the
youngest child in the family. I have grown accustomed to getting all the money, support, and, attention. I'm afraid everyone will forget me since
I no longer have that sweet, baby-fresh scent.
.
And finally, I'm afraid that for the next 5 years
ofmy life, every conversation I have with my family is going to revolve around the word "poopy."
That's just more than one person should have to

Dear Bear.
I used to live in a swirling vortex of despair and
unrealized dreams. I was depressed, sleep-deprived, and undernourished. I was failing all my
classes and I was addicted to huffing rubber cement. My girlfriend dumped me, my goldfish
Fluffy committed suicide, and I haven' t been able
to check my mail since I forgot my mailbox combination after winter vacation. I really didn't think
there was any point in going on.
And then they extended dinner credit at Tarble
to 9:30 p.m. Suddenly, it was like an enormous
weight was lifted from my very soul. I started
sleeping eight hours each night, getting perfect
scores on all my tests and papers, and attending
RCA (Rubber Cement Anonymous) meetings. Not
only did my girlfriend ask for my hand in marriage, but Cindy Crawford came to campus and
begged me to go to the spring formal with her.
Fluffy was somehow resurrected from his watery
grave in the Philadelphia sewage treatment plant
and managed to swim back through the miles and
miles of water pipes beneath the city and into the
very same Willets toilet where I had flushed him
several weeks ago. And when I pulled him out
and brought him back to my room, he arranged
the pebbles on the floor ofhis tank to spell out the
letters of my mailbox combination.
My life is now perfect, and I owe it all to the
Student Council and their "Food Services Revolution." How can I ever thank them?

Sincerely,
Jacques
Dear Jacques,
I got one word for you: kickbacks.

Balgobin's budget Costa Rica trip included this beautiful view of the Arenal Volcano.

by George Balgobin
Airline prices have soared ridiculously
high in the past ten years, making thebudget traveller's job a much more complex
process than simply being on good terms
with the local travel agent; getting good
airfare is becoming more a matter ofluck
than a planned experience. No one on a
shoestring budget can afford to give much
more than a glance to published fares and
the price quotes of nearby travel agencies. Still, there are several viable, albeit
somewhat risky, methods to getting
around on no dollars.
I will outline the different avenues in
ascending order of cheapness (which corresponds exactly to ascending order of
riskiness).
The New York Times' travel section
(Sundays) has a good number of advertisements for what is referred to in the
industry as consolidators or "bucket
shops" (they are the smallish ads giving
a rundown of various international fares).
What consolidators do is buy blocks of
remaining seats on major airlines for
many different destinations. The airline
sells them to the consolidator at the last
minute so as not to simply lose money
by having open, unsold seats. The consolidator is then able to turn around and
sell the seats at cut rates (although not all
that cut). Sample price differences include a $5OO published fare to London
to a consolidator fare of $329. Now not
all the savings are as significant (indeed
$5OO is way too much to pay for London), but consolidators are very safe because they are confirmed seats and letyou
carry a full luggage load. Why doesn't
everyone buy from consolidators then?
Actually many people do without knowing it. Travel agents go through consolidators quite frequently and sell the customer a consolidator seat after tacking on
a hefty commission fee. The reason
people don't usually go through consolidators directly is that most people don't
know how to contact them. A good book
that lists consolidators is Fly for Less by
Gary Schmidt published by Travel Publishing Inc., for $l5-20.
But consolidators' fares are
still too high for budget travellers in the truest sense of the
word budget. The next step in
airfare hunting is Air-Hitch
and Air-Tech (212-219-7000).
They used to be one company
until Air-Tech splintered off.
These companies are consolidators of sorts but there is an
added element of risk (and
thereby cheapness) to their
methods. They buy spaceavailable berths on airlines,
mostly charters, and sell them
to customers for even better
discounts than regular consolidators. They sell passes to Balgobin
their customers which function on the basis ofregion; for example,
Philadelphia is considered to be in the
Northeast region and Costa Rica is considered to be in the Caribbean region, so
someone wanting to travel from Philly to
Costa Rica gets a pass that says Northeast to Caribbean on it.This is not a ticket.
These companies instruct the customers
that after receiving their passes they are
to wait until four or five days before the
time they want to travel and call the company to find out to which destinations
there are seats. You see, the person may
want to travel to Costa Rica, but their seat

there is not guaranteed. There are between ten and fifteen destinations these
companies offer service to in the Caribbean, so ifthey are no seats to Costa Rica

waste. Unless you're staying in the top

days) when you can travel and you will American chains that are planted firmly

enders, save the extremely lowest venues
which sometimes seem more like overpriced patches of wilderness than buildings. Food is the second costliest expenditure. One thing to remember about food

George Balgobin

is never eat at places where the menu is
entirely in English because chances are
that place is specifically designed to suck
up tourist dollars. Look for shabby local
joints; if the locals eat there you can be
sure that it's gotta be decent and not too
pricy.
Moving around countries which don't
have amazingly developed transportation
systems can be the most frustrating portion of your trip. In Costa Rica there is
only one paved road that runs the span of
the country; the remaining roads are the
result of the Costa Rican method of tossing out bags of concrete onto areas and
spraying the concrete with water without
bothering to mix it. This yields gravel
patches which pass for major thoroughfares. Besides that, the busing systems
(which are all old US school buses) run
on very irregular, yet incredibly punctual
times. Busing is cheap, and in countries
where they offer first and second class
buses, I advise taking the first class buses
on very long journeys (over 8 hours).
They are air conditioned and can serve
as a hotel room in transit to your next location. On shorter trips second class buses
are the way to go. Though not much
cheaper than first class (they're all cheap
to begin with), they offer good opportunities to converse with locals about favorite hangouts or interesting travel ideas.
They stop every time someone waves
them down, but the poor condition of the
roads already ensures you won't be going anywhere fast. Another good option,
unless you're a single woman in certain
countries, is hitchhiking. Most tourists on
the road are Americans or Germans (who
seem to love to talk to Americans) and
are usually to happy to pick up a wayward traveller. In Costa Rica, the locals
were even friendlier than the tourists in
this respect. However, if you're hitching
at night, you'll be lucky to get anyone to
stop. When hitching, it's important to remember to offer something to your driver
when you reach your destination, although I'm not really sure of how much
because we never had to pay.
If you're planning on going to National
Parks or reserves one method that can
save you money, although you didn't hear
it from me, is to get there before the park
opens and just go in. This seems to work
relatively well, but be wary of the country you're in; I've heard it can get quite
out of hand if you get caught when guerilla groups are running the government.
Budget travel is still doable in this world
of overpricing and tourist-targeted markets, but it takes a savvy traveller to do it
right.

The Swarthmore Phoenix

tightly-constructed plots.
Still, Tommy Lee Jones is compulsively
watchable, and gives a great performance
again as Sam Girard. Wesley Snipes has
the year's most thankless role, as he occupies the screen for lots of time but leaves
no impression whatsoever.
In the end, I can't recommend U.S. Marshals, but I thought it was an agreeable
time-passer. I just can't get very excited
about assembly-line thrillers that don't
even have the balls for an R rating.

This led to the 36-hole mini golf marathon.
Hugh was in the lead after 18 holes, but,.
David, Brandon, and Evan were not too farbehind. Evan looked to be the underdog'
champion. Beginning his put-put career
at the tender age of5, he had always wanted.
to go pro, but his dreams were dashed by
his lack of height. However, David is a
money player when it comes to mini golf.
You can't stop him, you can only hope to
contain him. In the end, David won by:6~
strokes. David noted, "They were greatcompetitors out there. Hugh and Evan led.
late, but fortunately for yours truly, they>_
choked. You know, sometimes this game
is just too easy, but its good to get a little;,
scare every once in a while. It brings me
back to reality. I guess those other guy£~
weren't ready for the big leagues yet."
"While the rest of the guys ate marshr i

"Today, Andrew goes to Sarasota to visit'
the crazy foo' dakka child of beauty, Miss

"Days later, the group went to Universal,
Studios, where they could "ride the mov{

Gregory, Hugh Weber, and Alex Lundry a£
they portrayed shoppers stuck on an escalator during an earthquake, and a Jaws rid<?

on.
U.S. Marshals has a strong opening, and
a memorable entrance for Tommy Lee, but
as soon as it started falling into the same
Fugitive mold, I started losing interest.
The film is also way too long; it clocks in
over 2 hours, and there's tons of superfluous dialogue that could come out.
There are a couple memorable moments:
the plane crash sequence, clearly intended
to mirror the train wreck from the first
movie, has some genuine excitement, as
does a foot chase scene later on in the
movie. For a mega-budget action flick,
though, I would expect at least one or two
decent setpieces. Composer Jerry
Goldsmith's propulsive music is a big help
in this department.
The Fugitive director Andrew Davis sat
this installment out, as ExecutiveDecision
director Stuart Baird took over the reigns.
Baird, who for decades was one of
Hollywood's best film editors, has had a
shaky directorial start. Both U.S. Marshals
and Executive Decision had lots of potential as movies, and Baird realized some of
it, but for the most part he settled on formulas and bad dialogue when there should
have been propulsive action scenes and

group's wiles. Andrew concluded, "Sure
they wanted me, but they just weren't my
bag, baby!"
Day 4: Florida/Disney World
"The next day found us at Disney World,
the Happiest Place on Earth. Over the
course of the day, we found that we were
indeed the Happiest People at the Park, and
through our perverted logic, we concluded
that we were the Happiest Guys on the,
Earth. The boys enjoyed old standards such
as Space Mountain and the tea cups, but
also wreaked havoc at other attractions like
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and the Haunted
House where the scariest moment of the
trip occurred when Hugh Weber and Tim
Bragg came dangerously close to kissing
one another."
"Later we rode
Splash Mountain in
Disney sixteen times
and sang for Shanhappens when

i"loved us, as did a random man who ran
the ride. Wereceived
free pictures, got to
ride the log three times without getting out,
and received get-on-Space-Mountain-first
passes. Blam!
"The majority of the group then spent the
night at Pleasure Island, Disney's clubbing
scene. With five different clubs and New
Year's Eve celebrated every night, many
lamented that they had not brought their
fake IDs and therefore could not gorge
themselves on alcohol. Somehow, though,
the group still managed to have a good time
dancing in the seventies disco club with
sketchy dudes who appeared to have never
left that decade behind."
Day 5: Florida/Minigolf and Sarasota
"Today, Tim and Andrew trekked to
Sarasota for a day, and left the remaining

chain, lots ofWaffles. Halfthe songs in the
jute box were WAFFLE HOUSE originals!
Favorites included, "There are 844,739
ways to eat a waffle at WAFFLE HOUSE"
and "That ain't butter (or Quit hockkin'
loogies in the grits!)."
"First stop afterWaffle House, the Stonewall Jackson Memorial to get in touch with
our Southern roots. We sang Happy Birthday to him, since we figured the Star
Spangled Banner would probably be a slap
in the face."
Day 3: Florida/Daytona and Outback
"Shortly after arriving, an overwhelming
majority of the group chose to purchase
sandals for the LOW LOW PRICE OF $ 10
A PAIR!! The average consumer would
generally not expect to find such a superb
price except perhaps in
children's wear.
"After serenading a
65 year old Kmart lady,
we proceeded to a seven
lovely section of the
Magic
beach. As soon as we
hit the sand the sun disappeared and it got
chilly, so Tim and
Brandon (and Evan, momentarily) retreated
into the crummy surf to keep warm. Everybody else continued watching the cars
and other shiny things go back and forth
on the beach."
"While dining at Outback in Orlando, we
had the chance to flirt heavily with members of the opposite sex. Our waitress,
Beth, and another server, Molly, devoted
the brunt of their work to the "Foot" table
upon realization that they had a singing
group on their hands. After a "Happy
Birthday" rendition, the group found themselves providing the waitresses with more
and more aural pleasure throughout the
meal. By the time the group had left, both
Molly and Beth had been hooked by the

from the men who made this most courageous voyage. (Note: Most views expressed do not represent those of the members who presently have girlfriends)
Day 1: Baltimore and DC
"Baltimore, the breeding ground ofDavid
Ramirez 'Ol. The first stop was David's
high school, St. Paul's School. Walking into
the arts center, we encountered the St. Paul
Girls School Eclectics (five very attractive
women!), who, in turn, were looking for
David. (Yes!) We were all pretty content
with this turn of events, but happiest of all
was Alex Lundry. Since our arrival on campus, Alex's hormones had been raging,
looking for a prospective high school girl
to pick up. Songs were exchanged and we
were impressed with both their voices and
the shortness of their skirts. Our future
looks bright, and with that in mind, we start
10 days of "A CappellaLovefest."
"Finding ourselves without an engagement for the night, we promptly departed
for one of our favorite hangouts, The White
House. After raising the standing-roomonly crowd to a frenzy, we began our departure back to GWU. However, we were
stopped for a quick repeat performance
near the back entrance. Pretty nice gig,

House, Alex andAndrew Breitenberg were
ready for a party with the GWU Troubadours. Beer! Beer! Beer! So we jet over to

that no one can tap, and sketchy kids who

Day 2: Duke University and the Journey South
On Saturday night, the Sixteen Feet
found themselves at Duke University,
where they were hosted by the sonorous
and well-groomed group called "Speak of
the Devil." One memberof "Speak," freshman Lee Payne, later told this reporter that
"Duke women are not used to such vibrant
interpretations of a wide range of music
they were falling supine before [Sixteen
Feet]." It was after this well-received show
that the Feet made the crucial decision to
forego Duke lodging and drive overnight
to their next destination: Orlando, Florida.
"Next stop, South of the Border, the
greatest place on earth (next to Disney
World). Lovingly coined 5.0.8., this was

from the lack ofrest, but were soon re-energized by the sight of giant sombreros and

Village Restaurant Surprisingly Tasty
by Seth Budick
and Rob McGreevey
For practically four years, we've walked
by the Village Restaurant, thumbing our
noses at the place and making wry comments. Any restaurant that stopped serving by 7:00 p.m. and had a clientele older
than our parents certainly couldn't cater
to our youthful palates we thought. A bad
experience at the Ingleneuk Tea House
several years ago had made us both wary
of sampling the ville's regional cuisine.
The local flavors are exactly what are
at risk, however, if one believes recent letters to the Swarthmorean responding to
the current plans to redevelop
Swarthmore's business district. In addition, the recent arrivals of Cheng Hing
with its generic Chinese menu and an outlet of the Mom's bake-at-home pizza
chain (see our last review) have caused
seismic shifts in the local culinary landscape. If Swarthmore's small town charm,
as embodied in institutions like the Village Restaurant, is in peril from redevelopment or (gasp) competition for diners,
we thought that we should see what locals are making such a fuss about before
it's too late.
Entering the Village Restaurant provided us with our first surprise of the
evening. The main dining room is not
smalland dark as it might seem from outside, but is actually quite substantial and
is pleasantly lit. The maitre d' greeted us

with uncommon warmth and respect; we
might not expect such a reception with
town-gown relations as they are. Without
pretension to be anything more than a
comfortable place to eat, the Village Restaurant welcomed us easily, just like an
old shoe. Though the youngest people
there by at least 30 years, we felt immediately part of the family.
The menu consisted of standard American fare. Though regulars often pick
chicken or veal, an interesting selection
offish is also part of the selection. Prices
range from $5.95 to $8.95 and all entrees
include choice of two vegetables and soup
or salad. The menu lacked any appetizers
and vegetarian options were non-existent
(except for a cheese omelette). The daily
specials proved to be good choices; our
party of three sampled the fried rainbow
trout, breaded veal cutlets, and from the
regular menu, meatloaf with onions.
Weknew we hadn't strayed too far from
home (even if home is Sharpies) when we
were greeted with a basket ofkaiser rolls,
familiar to anyone who frequents the
sandwich bar. The salad was similar to
what you can assemble for yourself at
Sharpies' s uninspiring salad bar, but was
accompanied by an interesting raspberry
vinaigrette dressing. The tomato soup was
similar to Campbell's
creamy and salty
canned. The veal cutlet, tasty, if slightly
overdone, was topped with a slice of
melted American cheese, a perfect
middle-American touch, and was accompanied by some overcooked linguine. The

meatloaf was ordinary, heavy with just a
hint of bacon and flavored with Dad's fa- !
vorite brown gravy: A side order of fried ■
onions and Mom's mashed potatoes com- ;;
pleted this taste of home. The rainbow !
trout was dry and fried, unfortunately dis- ;
guising its naturally delicate taste and tex- ;;
ture. A side order of steamed vegetables ■
was also overcooked and insipid. For ;;
desert we had apple pie and vanilla ice ::
cream, the perfect conclusion to an ordi- '<>
nary meal. No part ofthe dinner was surf ;
j\
prising, in fact it was all quite familiar
part homemade, part Campbell's soup, •
Bird's eye vegetables and Mrs. Smith's
pie. Dinner, however, is more than the
food alone, it is an experience, and this ;j
experience was extraordinarily comforts ' ]
able as the food and the environment

evoked a feeling reminiscent of home.
We could have ordered almost anything '■
off the Village Restaurant's menu from a i,
chain restaurant like Boston Market, but
we're almost positive that we would rather j
eat here in town. Why? Because although
the Village Restaurant draws from the ;<
same standard American menu, its food ;
has character. It has character because it ',
does not follow the preparation guidelines
passed down from corporate headquarters
and instead bears the unmistakable mark
of being prepared by a very human chef, jj

Baseball Lands Third Win,
Improvement on Last Year Likely
Team's Record Stands at 3-5, Injuries May
Impair Conference Advancement
by Patricia Barrientos
The 1998 season has began for the Swarthmbre baseball team and a new beginning
might be what the team needed. This year's
team has already won its third game, which
took themall season to accomplish in 1997,
and their record stands 3-5. Captain and
catcher Andrew Lund '99 attributes the improvement to the veterans, the rookies, and
a large degree to the great effortof coaches
Frgnk Agovino and Mike Patrone. Lund
is confident and said "things are looking
up and position by position, we are a much
better team." Clayton Cohn 'Ol, who plays
left field added "we are going to definitely
win some games. We're not looking to just
survive and make it through the year. We
want to be competitive."
Unfortunately, the team has been plagued
by injuries to pitchers Dave Giles '9B, Steve
Farneth 'OO, and Joe Culley 'OO and third
baseman Carlo Fitti 'OO. Farneth and Giles
are expect to return before the Garnet faces
the conference teams. In the meantime,
Jay Schembs 'Ol, who also plays first base
and outfield, and Josh Roth '99, a first
baseman as well, will be doing all pitching. Due to the shortage of pitching, the
team will have to be on top of their game
defensively to limit the number of pitches
thrown.
Down the middle, the defense is solid.
The outfield, though lacking in speed, has
good throwing arms anchored by veterans
Brian Lopez 'OO and Joe Aleffi 'OO. Behind home plate, Josh Lindsey 'Ol and
Lund will platoon and alternate being designated hitters. The bench is mostly rookies who have not seen much action to prove
themselves.
Overall the Garnet is stocked with new-

comers withraw talent. "It's a young team
and we are not very deep so we are forced
to step up our game," explained Lund.
Cohn said that to make up for the lack of
speed, pitching, and inexperience, a strong
defense is crucial. Nonetheless, the Garnet is optimistic and they feel that if healthy,
they can compete for the conference title
where Johns Hopkins, Franklin and
Marshall, and Washington are their top
competition.
The potential is there. Last year Steve
Farneth threw a no hitter against Haverford.
Dan Johnston '9B, although he did not play
last year, he brings experience from summer ball and from his first two years on
the team. At shortstop, both outfielder
Clayton and catcher Lindsey agreed that
Rob Castellucci 'Ol is fast, very smooth
with a great pivot on double plays, and has
an excellent range. In Joe Aleffi 'OO, the
Garnet has a solid centerfielder and a fast

leadoff hitter.
The offense is powered by Aleffi,
Johnston and Schembs but the bottom of
the order, Lopez, Lindsey, and Lund have
been driving in runs with timely hits as
well. Although Lund admitted that small
ball £ la National League is not a strategy
for this year's team, he said that patience
must be exercised to get solid hits that will
drive in runs.
In yesterday's contest against Lebanon
Valley, Lindsey drove in two runs and
Johnston blasted a solo home run. Also
Schembs, who pitched, went 3-3 with 2
singles, a double, and a run scored.
Castellucci and Matt Youngner 'Ol both
singled. The Garnet scored 3 runs on 7
hits with 4 left on base as they fell to Lebanon Valley College 13-3.

Though the rest of the United States celebrates Asian Pacific American
Heritage Month in May, here at Swarthmore, the next few weeks will be
host to a series of events relating to Asian Pacific American history and
issues coinciding with the ten-year anniversary of the Swarthmore Asian
Organization. All events are open to the public. Look for upcoming details
to confirm event information.

Catcher Mary Elizabeth Alvarez '9B warms up pitcher Dana Lehman '9B
first conference game against Neumann College

at

yesterday's game. The Softball team won its

Softball Vanquishes Neumann College
by Jean Quinn
The softball team had a busy spring
break, playing four doubleheaders in Fort
Pierce, Florida with very little outdoor experience under their hats. To their credit,
the team, who had yet to work as one unit
with the infield and outfield together, performed well and has high expectations for
the 1998 season.
Swat dropped both games to Bryant College (9-8, 15-7) but played much more
competitively than in last year's contests
with the Division II squad. Against Russell
Sage, the team put forth a strong effort,
losing both but falling just short of victory
in the first game (2-0). The Shorewomen
from Washington College were vacationing in Ft. Pierce as well, and Swat got to
face this important Centennial Conference
rival in a preliminary of this Tuesday's
match. Both games were tight battles, although Washington did edge out the Garnet (9-4 in 9 innings, 8-6).

Head Coach Cheri Goetcheus commented on the first game, "We scored 3
runs in the first inning and then settled
back. Washington tied the game in the 4th
and we went into extra innings. Its a matter of their batters seeing pitcher Dana
Lehman 4 or 5 times in a game, and no
matter how wonderfully she's pitching,
eventually the batter is going to start winning the battles. Washington was able to

string a few hits together in the 9th, and
we had dug ourselves a hole that was too
big to climb out of." Lehman '9B had 2
hits in the outing, and Michelle Walsh '9B
knocked in 2 runs off a single and a triple.
Shortstop Heather Marandola 'Ol had 2
RBIs as well, off a single and a double.
The second game saw a quick offensive attack by the Garnet, who scored 4 runs in the
first inning. The bats went cold soon afterwards, however, and Swat, going hitless in
the last three innings, was unable to respond
to Washington's more gradual onslaught.
Lehman and Jean Quinn '99 each went 2 for
4 in the game, and Mary Beth Alvarez '9B
had 3 singles. Walsh singled and homered,
acquiring 4 RBIs and scoring 2 runs.
The Garnet split with Marywood, notching a 9-1 victory and then falling by the
same margin in the second game. "It was
the first game where we took charge from
the start and never looked back," said
Goetcheus. "However, we switched roles
in the second game and Marywood took
us from the start. We totally lost our mental hunger and focus during the second
game. Our lack of hitting helped develop
confidence in their defense." Alvarez had
the hot bat, going 3 for 4, including a
double, and knocking in a pair of runs.
Seeing much promise in the young squad,
Goetcheus cited a number of team
strengths: "The defense is greatly improved
overall from last year, with more depth at

each position. The pitching staff(Lehman
and Kate Fama '01) is coming along nicely
and gaining confidence." The team's
"never-say-die" attitude will carry the
squad far.
Apparent weaknesses are "not starting
out early with our offense or in the games
where we scored runs early, sitting on that
and resting, and not remaining focused and
intense enough to put the other team away."
Catcher Alvarez said, "I see no reason
why we can't come out with a .500 record.
Once we strengthen our bats and come on
strong with pitching, our consistent defense
will help us."
Indeed they are, as the Garnet handily
overpowered Neumann College shortly
after their return from Florida, 4-1.
Lehman performed exceptionally well
from the mound, especially in the early innings, striking out nine batters and walking none. Left-fielder Deirdre Downey 'Ol
was perfect from the plate with 2 singles, a
double, and RBI, and a stolen base.
Marandola knocked in a run off a triple,
and third baseman Portia Kelly 'Ol also
pushed one across the plate off a single.
Swat (2-7 overall) hosts Drew University
for a Sunday afternoon doubleheader at
lpm. The conference schedule opens when
the Garnet look to reverse the outcome of
the Washington games when the
Shorewomen arrive Tuesday for a 2:3opm
doubleheader.

Tuesday morning the Garnet came out
looking for a win against Averett. Swat
was victorious with a 5-4 win. This match
was characterized by great play; notable
was the #1 doubles team ofKrista Hollis
'Ol and Jen Pao 'Ol who had a spectacular
match and won 8-5. While, they didn't win
the #3 doubles team ofElizabeth Derickson

On Thursday, in the last match of the
week, Swat shut out William Jewell 9-0.
At #2 singles Rani Shankar '9B slammed
her opponent 6-2,6-0. At #5 singles Laura
Brown 'OO secured the team sweep with a
6-4, 6-7, (7-5) win. The week ended wonderfully with a 3-1 team record and undefeated records of Pao and Hollis at #1
doubles, Brown at #5 singles, and Flather
at #6 singles. The team's next matches will
be at home on Tuesday March 26th and
Thursday March 28th versus Washington
College and Western Maryland.
Over Spring Break the Men's Tennis
Team drove to Davidson, North Carolina,
to play against Davidson and Wooster Colleges. On a cold and windy afternoon Swarthmore took on Division I Davidson. Over
the last few years the two schools have
played several times and Davidson has always won easily. Even though the team lost

6-1 this year, the score doesn't reveal how
close the match actually was. In the singles,
sophomores Sascha Sheehan, playing
against a rival from the juniors, won the
only match at #3. The two played each
other several times in Florida junior tournaments and this is Sascha's first win. Junior Nick Slimack and sophomores John
Leary and JohnTemin also played well and
had close matches.
The next day the team played its first
match of the season against Div. 11l
Wooster ofOhio. The doublesteams started
slowly, but all three won to give Swarthmore the doubles point. Then the singles
players took the court and Swat started
quickly with Sascha winning at #3 and
Leary at #4, while Roger Werner '9B and
Slimack struggled at #1 and #2. Greg
Emkey and Temin went on to clinch the
match with wins at #5 and #6.
Upcoming homematches are Hartford on
Wednesday and Emory on Saturday.

On Tuesday, the women's lacrosse solidly defeated College of
Notre Dame 17-3. Last years conference high scorers Holly Baker
'99 and Alicia Googins 'OO each
scored 6 goals and had 2 assists.
Senior Betsy Rosenbaum knocked
in a hat trick, while NataniaKremer
'Ol grabbed another goal for Garnet. Notably, Katie Vivalo 'Ol, a
rookie to the sport, scored her first
goal of an official game.
By the end of the first half, Swarthmore had a scored 15 goals while
goalkeeper JaneKendall 'OO had allowed none into her net. During
the second half, the focus of the
game became technique for the
undermatched Garnet, only scoring
when unavoidable.
The first official contest of the
season allowed many freshman to
exhibit their skills: Kristen English
'Ol displayed her intensity at center and Erica Williams 'Ol on the
offense. The leadership of the upperclassmen was also evident everywhere on the field, from Kendall
to

Baker.

The success of Swarthmore may
be credited to their recent journey
to Panama City where team bonding, on and off the field was crucial due to the cold weather. While
there, the team scrimmaged Colorado College, tying at 12, with a
goal scored by Williams in the last
minute of the game.

disprove the laws of physics and in
the face of such fierce competition,
the rest of the Earthworms brackets teams dropped out.
After a week of practicing, ice
cream runs the team faced
Rensellear and Haverford in Isle of
Palms, SC. With the recent arrival
of a few fresh players from campus, the team unleashed its newest
weapon, Sasha Clayton '9B, on its
opponents. RPI was undauntedand
broke through Swat's weak defense, winning 15-9. The strong
Haverford team did not fare so well,
losing 16-12.
For their next tourney on the 28th,
the Earthworms will compete away
against Haverford College.

The Garnet's next two games would be against
top 20 teams Randolph-Macon and Amherst, respectively. Swarthmore fell behind 12-2 at the
half en route to a 18-4 loss at the hands of the
Yellow Jackets. Toby Patterson 'OO, Mike Lloyd
'Ol and Dingfield scored for the Tide.
Against Amherst, Swat fell behind 7-0 in the
first quarter, but refused to give up. Lloyd scored
two second quarter goals, but still trailed 10-2
at the halftime intermission. The Garnet then
went to a zone, which effectively neutralized
theLord Jeffs, and Rydquist allowed only 3 second half goals, while making 8 saves. Offensively, Steve Shin '9B and Lloyd added third
quarter goals. Dingfield scored two fourth quarter goals to cut the lead to 12-6, but the Garnet
could get no closer, and the Lord Jeffs were victorious 13-6. Remarkably, Swarthmore played
the #l5 ranked team evenly after the first quarter, despite both teams using their starters for
the rest of the game.
Swat's next opponent is Saturday at home
against Wooster. The Tide will look to avenge
a 10-7 defeat from last year. Freshmen Lloyd
and Dingfield lead the team in goals with 12
each, while DeShields leads the team in ground
balls with 32. Johnson has won 60% of his
faceoffs on the year to date.

The spring track and field season
opened with a bang as the majority
of the team traveled to Myrtle
Beach, South Carolina, for a week
of intensive training. The difficult
week culminated in an even tougher
division one level meet at the University of North Carolina 1 in
Wilmington. Despite this fact, the
team continued to perform well and
show tremendous spirit, and returned to Swarthmore on Sunday
morning refreshed and strengthened
The most notable track athletes
missing from the trip were Desiree
Peterkin 'Ol, who competed at the
Division 111 national competition,
and the two other provisional national qualifiers, Steve Dawson 'OO
and Catherine Laine '9B. With
those three as well as a few others
absent, the team was not complete,
but still managed to preview what
the outdoor season will be like.
The team arrived in Myrtle Beach
the night ofSaturday, March 7, and
began training the next morning.
While distance runners explored
the hotel surroundings and the
beach, the sprinters, throwers, and
jumpers practiced at the Coastal
Carolina University facility about
twenty minutes away.
Several members ofthe women's
team had very strong performances
following their Centennial Conference Championship, notably
Danielle Duffy '9B in the 200 meter
dash, and Danielle Wall '9B and
Joko Aguyunle 'Ol in the 3000
meter run. On the men's side, Mason Tootell '99 performed well in
the javelin, and the sprinters and
distance runners continued to run
respectable times. Many athletes
ran their season's best times. All
in all, the meet was a great confidence builder for Swarthmore, and
the performance bodes well for the
outdoor season.
The team will not perform in a
meet again until March 28. The
women hope to take an outdoor
Centennial Conference championship, and the men seek to improve
on their indoor performance.

Jumper Peterkin Lands
Second in Nation
by Dan Fanaras
Desiree Peterkin 'OO finished in second
place in the triple jump at the 1998 Division 111 National Indoor Track and Field
Championships held on Saturday at
Brandeis University in Waltham, MA. Her
jump of 38 feet, 6 inches was 6.5 inches
farther than the third place finisher.
This performance has earned Peterkin
her second All-American title as a Swarthmore Athlete. The first came last May
with an Bth place finish at outdoor nationals.
"I knew it was far because it felt really
good," Peterkin describes her firstreaction
to her successful jump. She is coached in
the triple jump by Athletic Director and
field events coach Bob Williams.

Peterkin also competes in the long jump,
the 100 and 200 meter dash, and is a member of Swarthmore's successful women's
relay team. She is now preparing for outdoor season.
Head track and field coach Ted Dixon,
who left spring break training in Myrtle
Beach, SC early to attend the competition,
suggests that his trip was rewarding. "It
was an exhilarating experience to witness
one of our athletes perform so well at the
National Championship level," he said.
The women's indoortrack and field team
finished the season ranked 13th nationally,
after winning the Centennial Conference
title three weeks ago. The men's team was
27th in the nation as of the last ranking.
Both teams will compete next Saturday in
a five-way meet at Ursinus College.

The Saturday before spring
break, the men's rugby team
took out a season's worth of
frustrations on Bucknell,
throttling their guests 46-7 at
DuPont field. After a disappointing fall season in which
the Evil Buzzards failed to
win a game, the Ruggers had
something to prove. And they
proved that they are a team to
be reckoned with this season,
overwhelming the clearly
overmatched Bucknell club
with excellent execution on
both sides of the ball.
Swarthmore came out fired
up, and Tony Sturm '99
scored the game's first try less
than two minutes into the
match, taking a pass from
Adam Booth 'OO and coasting almost untouched into the
try zone. Not too long after,
Ryan Mader 'OO touched
down another try.
Despite the two early tries,
Bucknell kept their composure for the rest of the first
half, and Swarthmore had an
extremely difficult time getting the ball into the try zone,

squandering numerous scoring
opportunities. The half time
score, therefore, remained 140, Buzzards lead.
Bucknell made some substitutions at the half, and came
out with a burst of energy after
the break. They surprised the
Buzzards with a weak side try
off a scrum, and theconversion
made it 14-7. Soon after, however, Swarthmore regained the
touch with which it began the
game. Moose Sheer '99 scored
a try for the forward pack, taking the ball off a ruck and
plowing in for the points.
After that emotional lift, the
home team's strategy became
relatively clear: Get the ball out
to theback line and watch them
run. Six out of the seven backs
scored tries, though their exploits would not have been possible without solid play by the
forwards, who won the ball on
numerous occasions.
Soon after Sheer's try, the
levee broke. Captain Dan Barrack '9B set up a try by Booth
with a brilliant thirty yard run
and pass that let Booth
Cakewalk in for the score. Soon
after, Dan Green '99 scored

himself, Jerome Bushnell '99

Chris Seamen '99, who
started as emergency hooker,
performed remarkably well,
considering his trial-by-fire

game. Seamen had neyer

rugby and had just two short
weeks to learn the game before
Saturday. Joining Seamen in
his A-side debut was Kelley
Hauser '99 who provided himself as a dependable back, de
spite battling cornerback instincts that lingered from football season.
The women and men's rugby
teams have a doubleheader tomorrow on DuPont field
against the University ofPennsylvania. The women's game
starts at 11:00 a.m., and the
men follow at 1:00 p.m. University of Pennsylvannia has
been the closest thing the men
have for a nemesis, so the
game should be a good one.
