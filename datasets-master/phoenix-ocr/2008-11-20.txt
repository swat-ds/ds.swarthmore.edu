Interview with activist Manuel Calel Morales
The Phoenix's Alexander Rolle recently interviewed
Manuel Calel Morales, an indigenous human rights
activist from Guatemala, after his lecture "Seeking
Justice and Digging Up Bones: Human Rights in
Guatemala" on Monday. The talk was sponsored by the
Latin American Studies department. Mr. Calel Morales
spoke through a translator, Amanda Martin. Ms. Martin
is the director of the Guatemala Human Rights
Commission. For more infomation about their work,
visit www.ghrc-usa.org.
Alexander Rolle: Would you mind telling me about
the lecture you're giving tonight "Seeking Justice and
Digging up Bones?"
Manuel Calel Morales: We're here seeking justice,
and looking for who is responsible for the victims of war
in Guatemala.
AR: / read the synopsis ofyour talk, and it sounds like
you're using forensic science to look at the graves ofpeople
who were killed over the last 30 or so years.
MCM: That is correct. We work with the Guatemala
Forensic Anthropology Foundation to investigate the
mass graves.
AR: And this is to give the families peace and also to
hold those responsible accountable?
MCM: We work with the Guatemala Forensic
Anthropology Foundation because they are the experts.
They study the bones, they excavate the mass graves,
they see what impact the violence left on the bones so
that there will be evidence provided to uncover what
happened to these people.
AR: So this is looking back at what happened in
Guatemala. How would you describe the current state of
affairs there?
MCM: There's a lot of violence in Guatemala today,
this violence is generated by gangs and by poverty.
AR: How's the reaction been, both by the government in
Guatemala and by international bodies, to the violence?
MCM: It's a difficult situation. The Guatemalan government hasn't been able to do anything to stop the outrageous levels of violence. What they've decided to do is
focus on using the national police for public security.
AR: Both for those within Guatemala and for those
here, what is something effective that can be done? What
can students at Swarthmore do?
MCM:
We ask that university students here at
Swarthmore take action to send a message to the
Guatemalan government to let them know that they need
to be obeying the law.
AR: So the Guatemalan government is not just unable
to do things, but they're also breaking the law?
MCM: Because of poverty and because of violence, we
-

are destined to repeat the same cycle in Guatemala. The
only way that we can change this is by putting resources
into educating young people so that they don't repeat the
cycle of violence. The government is looking to government security forces, such as the national police, to provide security for the people. However, the national
police are corrupt entities who are guilty of human
rights violations, and therefore they can't be used to prothey are the ones who are breaking the
vide security
law.
AR: I understand that you 'll be speaking at a protest at
the School of the Americas. Could you tell us a little bit
about the School of theAmericas and why you 'll be protesting there?

"We are destined to repeat the
same cycle in Guatemala. The only
way that we can change this is by
educating young people so that they
don't repeat the cycle of violence."
...

Manuel Calel Morales
Human rights activist
MCM: I'm against the School of the Americas because
that is where the Latin American security forces are
they're trained to torture people, to kidnap
trained
people, and if you look at the specific example of the
Guatemalan internal armed conflict, many of the military officials who were guilty ofhuman rights violations
were graduates of the School of the Americas.
understand that recently the School of the
AR:
Americas has, at least outwardly, been undergoing some
sorts ofreforms. Do you think that progress is being made?
MCM: As long as there is poverty in Guatemala, there
will be no peace, so I see these reforms as a makeover,
and as long as this school exists there will continue to be
training of Guatemalan military, and that will not help
us reach peace.
AR: A number of Swarthmore students will be at that
protest as part of the Students for a Democratic Society. Do
you think that that type of protest is effective, or are there
other things students should be doing?
MCM: It's great that the students are going, that they
want to shut the school down, but the students don't
know the other half of it, which is the reality of the Latin
/

American countries where these graduates have been
operating.

AR: Is there

understanding

something

we could do to gain a better

of that?

MCM: The communities need the presence of international organizations and delegations. They need this
presence in order to achieve peace.
AR: You're working with the Guatemala Human
Rights Commission, is that right? Is this an organization
that Swarthmore students could get involved with?
Amanda Martin: I'm the director of the Guatemala
Human Rights Commission, and we take delegations of
people to Guatemala, and we're taking the next delegation in March of 2009. You can look at our Web site, www.
ghrc-usa.org, and that is how we begin a relationship
with these communities. The international presence
helps bring security to the families that are being threatened due to their work, and we also have brought Don
Manuel to the United States on a speaker tour, culminating in the School of the Americas protest. On the Web site
we have many resources, we have lots of documents and
programs and campaigns, people can respond to urgent
action, which is another way you can participate.
When someone like Don Manuel is threatened for his
work, threatened by the people who massacred his family members in his village, we send out an urgent action,
asking people to sign a letter that we send to the
Guatemalan government, demanding a full investigation
of the crime and for the perpetrators to be held responsible.
AR: How has the response of the Guatemalan government been to your efforts?
AM: It depends on who's President and who's
Attorney General at the time. There is a new President
named Alvaro Caballeros, and we've had not a fantastic
response, but we haven't had a negative response. We're
forming a relationship with him.
AR: Who chooses the President? How does he come to
power?

MCM: This last election we had was transparent... it
was a fair election.
AR: Many in Guatemala are reacting against the
human rights violations. Are there factions within the
society that are not bothered by these violations, [factions]
that support them?

MCM: There are groups that are working to support
human rights in Guatemala but there are also groups
that are working against human rights.
AR: Are these the same people that are threatening you?
MCM: Yes, these are the same people who are responsible for the deaths and assassinations of people in our
communities.

NEWS IN BRIEF
New biweekly discussion group centered on women in and writing fiction to begin meeting next Monday In WRC
Starting on Nov. 24, the Women's
Resource Center will begin hosting a
biweekly discussion group designed to
explore the contributions of female writers to the genre of fictional literature
through a feminist lens. The discussion
group, one of many events scheduled
during the WRC's Open Hours, will convene every other Monday from 10 p.m. to

midnight.

Candice Nguyen 'll, the discussion
facilitator, said that she was inspired to
organize the series after noting the
absence of a community forum that
would explore fictional literature from a
feminist perspective. After an unsuccessful attempt to register for a Virginia
Woolf class at Bryn Mawr last year,
Nguyen decided to read Woolf s work on
her own while interning at the Feminist
Majority Foundation over the summer.
When she encountered Woolfs "A
Room of One's Own," Nguyen found that

THE PHOENIX

the work complemented her activities at
FMF and realized that the WRC would
provide the perfect venue for further
exploration of the subject.
"The timing of working for this prowomen coalition and reading Woolf
[inspired me] to use the WRC as a medium and a launching point to discuss
other cornerstones about women writers or as a way to [discuss] how women
have been portrayed in different texts,"
Nguyen said.
Nguyen said that she will incorporate
feedback from participants in the first
discussion when thinking about how to
structure discussions for the remainder
of the semester. The group will focus on
more than just a literary critique of
women's writing. "It does not necessarily have to be academic. I see [the discussion group] as becoming a very malleable forum to discuss feminism and
women's empowerment," Nguyen said.

During her first gathering, she plans
to stage a reenactment of Woolf s "A

Room of One's Own," an extended essay
that Woolf originally presented as a
series oflectures. "One interesting thing
is to do a reenactment because it wasmeant to be vocal," Nguyen said. While
acknowledging that the discussion's
late-night time is not optimal, Nguyen
said she is confident that the series will
draw enough participants to sustain a
lively discussion.
In addition, Nguyen hopes the discussion will provide a space to discuss the
history of women writers and their evolution stories that are often underemphasized in academic settings. Although
Nguyen
commended the English
Literature Department for offering a
wide range of courses, she said that
there remains room for improvement in
the diversity of the selection.
Erika Slaymaker 11, who plans to

November 20, 2008

participate in the discussion group,
offered a similar assessment of the
department's course offerings. "I think
that the English Department does a good
job representing a lot of specialties,"
Slaymaker said, "[But] we can always do
more to improve."
English Literature Professor Peter
Schmidt saidthat the English Literature
Department is making a concerted effort
to design classes that incorporate a
range of authors and views. According
to Schmidt, over 50 percent of the students enrolled in English classes are
female, and the department incorporates
feminist theory in a number of classes.
Further, professors take the gender bal-

ance of the authors into account when
constructing syllabi. "We definitely
Female
think a lot about the authors
writers are very central to our classes,"
Schmidt said.

Admissions Office to initiate
new telementoring program

THIS WEEK IN PICTURES

BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Beginning
spring,
this
Swarthmore will offer college counseling services to low-income and
first generation applicants in the
form of student telementors. This new
program, launched by the admissions
office, will pair up trained telementors with second-semester high school
juniors. The mentor will guide his or
her assigned students through the
entire college process, from producing a timeline for creating and submitting admissions material to talking about the distinction between
public and private institutions.

is developing a clear sense of what the
program is all about. "It's about giving students accurate information

from kind of the other side of the
process," he said. Telementors will be
able to serve as a source of such information both because of the experience they've already had with the
process and because they will go
training
through
a
session.
"Essentially, what we want to do with
our telementors is really train them
to understand the college application
process," Peterson said. Through
training, they will learn how to help
high school students navigate application deadlines, understand the differences between types of schools and
schedule visit dates.
Calvin Ho 'll, a multicultural
recruitment intern in the admissions
office, was excited when he first
heard about the new program.
"Personally I feel that expanding educational opportunities for underprivileged students is important," Ho said.
Peterson was quick to establish
that the program is not about recruiting students to attend Swarthmore.
"The goal of this program is not actuto
to
ally
recruit
students
Swarthmore but to provide auxiliary,
additional, supplemental college
advising help to students who typically come from communities that may
be underserved," Peterson said.
Implicit in this goal is the idea that
college counselors provide services
that can't be provided by The Fiske
Guide, the College Board Web site or
college visits alone.
Peterson said that college counselors often help with tasks that seem
minor, such as packaging application

November 20, 2008

materials and suggesting highly
selective but lesser-known institutions tasks that can be difficult for
students to grapple with independently.

Cecilia Marquez 'll, a multicultural recruitment intern in the admissions office, said that she found her
college counselor to be instrumental
when she was applying. "[The importance of college counselors] is one of
those things that goes unrecognized,"
Marquez said. According to Peterson,
many students at Swarthmore also
expressed deep satisfaction with high
school guidance counseling.
But in addition to providing purely factual information, Peterson
hopes that the telementors will be
able to provide emotional support.
"We want students to be that voice of
empathy to let them know that you
can actually get through this. I know
your parents may not understand it. I
know these schools are very far from
home. But you can actually do it,"
Peterson said.
In particular, the telementor program is trying to encourage Swatties
who didn't have guidance counselors
or who are first-generation college
students to share their experiences
with and mentor underprivileged
high school students. "I'm working on
trying to recruit students of color and
low-income students [for telementoring]. Since the outreach has begun
we've received an influx of applications. We've seen a wide range of people across class years. That's really
exciting," Marquez said.
Peterson is working on the other
end of things. Along with the other
deans, he is trying to identify high
schools that would benefit from the
program. He described one charter
school in Oakland, California that is
graduating its first class next year.
The current juniors at the school
have no senior class to look up to for
advice about the process. Peterson
has invited these students to apply to
have a telementor. Only those students at high schools that the admissions office has invited can apply.

"Personally I feel that
expanding educational
opportunities for
underprivileged
students is important."
Calvin Ho 'll
Peterson foresees that once the

application process is over, they will
launch a small program in the spring
with five to ten telementors, each
with at most four mentees. "We're definitely not trying to get in over our
head [sic] in terms of the amount of
resources that we have to do it with,"

Peterson said. As for the future, he
said, "We're really in uncharted territory."

mentor application can be found

Debate over financial aid policy intensifies
BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

A string of events over the past few weeks has brought
the discussion of financial aid and access to higher education to the forefront at Swarthmore.
In late October, a collective of students referred to as
Swarthmore Financial Justice issued a petition outlining
some areas in which Swarthmore's financial aid policies
were perceived as lacking. In response to the petition,
Director ofFinancial Aid Laura Talbot sent a Nov. 5 email
to all students that sought to clarify some financial aid
policies and practices at Swarthmore.
The petition and the subsequent response issued by
the administration were followed by a rally for accessible
education on Nov. 14 organized by the Swarthmore chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. Although the
rally seemed to coincide with the discussion raised by
Swarthmore Financial Justice, SDS member Andrew
Petzinger 'O9 said the rally was previously planned as
part of a national day of action.
"This past summer, SDS passed its first ever national
campaign for students to fight for accessible education,"
Petzinger said. "The rally was organized by SDS, and we
had speakers from SDS, Swarthmore Financial Justice,
and Class Awareness Month
all the groups interested
in doing things to make education more accessible here. I
thought the rally was very successful. We turned out a
whole bunch of people for 4:30 p.m. on a Friday that was
kind of drizzly. It showed that there's energy around
here."
Petzinger said the goal of the demonstration was to
rally students on behalf of education access issues. "Our
goals were to build energy for students because that's
where the impetus for change is going to come from," he
said. "The SDS chapter here is mainly interested in transparency issues [concerning financial aid]. We're most
interested in transparency issues as a first step in what
seems like would have to be a long-term campaign to
change educational policy."
Three days after the rally, members of Swarthmore
Financial Justice put up orange posters in Parrish with
testimonials and comments on the theme of financial aid.
The public flyers included alleged quotations from members of the Financial Aid Office ranging from "This is
where fathers come to cry" to "Education is a right,
Swarthmore is a privilege."

"Financial Aid is at the center
of our ethical institution. There
is no issue that is more central

to our core values."
Al Bloom
College President
Administrators said the poster campaign came as a
surprise. "I was surprised when I came in and saw the
orange papers in the office yesterday," Associate Dean for
Student Life Myrt Westphal said. "Fairly early in the
morning, folks from facilities came to me because the postering rules had been broken. We consulted with members of the group who said they would take the posters
down Monday night, so we felt we would allow that to
continue," she said.
Westphal said the deans are working on clarifying and
publicizing the postering rules. "If things are taken down,
it's not because of the message, it's because of how they
were put up," she said. "The postering was actually a
pretty big deal in terms of not trying to shut off conversation, but also realizing that we have a set of rules for
how people are supposed to poster."
Dan Symonds 11 said the poster campaign in Parrish
rightly added an emotional dimension to a financial
issue, but he emphasized that students have to move
toward working with the administration in order to affect
change. "There's nothing more encouraging than the fact
that such a vital issue has become a hot topic on campus.
The recent Parrish postering is a really important part of
the process," Symonds said. "My greatest concern is that
we have to get beyond sensational tactics that are targeted at individuals and move towards opening a dialogue

THE PHOENIX

Youngin Chung for The Phoenix

Students pause on Monday morning to view the flyers posted by Swarthmore Financial Justice.
and forming a coalition with the administration and
board members who are making the important decisions."
"I'm worried that Swarthmore Financial Justice is
perceived as the only student voice," Symonds said. "As
many posters as there were up there voicing concern,
there are just as many stories about people who have
nothing but praise for the Financial Aid Office."
Monday's poster campaign boosted student and faculty turnout to a Financial Aid Q&A session hosted by
Class Awareness Month on Tuesday, although CAM
organizer Rosario Paz 'lO said organizers planned the
event before the issue really erupted on campus. With a
strong showing from the administration that included
President Al Bloom, Talbot and Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Jim Bock, around 30 students came to
Kohlberg to discuss issues surrounding financial aid.
"I think it's interesting how all these things lined up
with such great timing," Paz said. "Once we knew about
the postering in Parrish Hall, we were hoping a lot of
those concerns would be discussed during the Q&A session in a respectful manner."
Paz said high student and faculty turnout at the Q&A
session was encouraging. "We were surprised to see so
many administrators [at the Q&A session]. For me that's
the best thing that came out of this, not necessarily the
answers themselves, but the fact that these administrators were willing to spend two hours out of their day just
to listen to student concerns," Paz said. "I know they
know a lot more about the reasons why financial aid policy can't be changed so easily, but it's nice to hear Al
Bloom say that, despite the difficulties, we still want to
keep the conversation going."
During the Q&A session, students posed questions to
Talbot, who discussed student concerns with some help
from Bock and Bloom. "I'm ready to talk about anything
you want to," Talbot said at the beginning of the session.
"The orange signs yesterday were very emotional and
showed a lot of frustration. If there is any of that in the
room now, we can talk about that."
Six or seven students questioned Talbot on issues
varying from transparency in the financial aid process to
more personal questions about individual aid decisions.
Talbot answered student questions and also directed students to outside sources and readings, whileBloom piped
in at one point to assure students that financial aid was a
priority at Swarthmore. "Financial Aid is at the center of

November 20, 2008

our ethical institution. There is no issue that is more central to our core values," Bloom said.
Symonds, who also acts as a student advisor to Dean
Bock, inquired about the steady percentage of students
who have historically received financial aid at
Swarthmore during the Q&A session. "The 'magic' 50 percent ratio of students who are ineligible for financial aid
each year is pretty telling," Symonds said. "I think that
number has a lot do with how we recruit. It's logical that
some students have to pay full tuition in order to sustain
existing financial aid policy. But why Swarthmore can
never seem to breach that 50 percent ceiling of financially needy students with a need-blind admissions policy
it's more than puzzling. If the student body ever begin to
mirror the country's economic landscape, the proportion
of students with need would be much closer to 90 percent."

"We're most interested in
transparency issues as a first
step in what seems like would
have to be a long-term campaign
to change educational policy."
Andrew Petzinger 'O9
SDS member
Amidst all the discussion surrounding financial aid,
Symonds said student debt should be a focus of any campaign concerning equal access in education. "I think the
elephant in the room is student debt. There are two types
of students that graduate from Swarthmore: those who
graduate without debt, and students who graduate with
debt that is sometimes crippling," he said. "That's the
real issue. JimBock always says that education is a right
and Swarthmore is a privilege, but the privilege of
Swarthmore is not the privilege of inheriting colossal
debt. It's taking on debt that's manageable."
The conversation on Financial Aid will continue next
Tuesday, Nov. 25, with a forum featuring President Bloom
and Dean Bock in Science Center 101 at 7:30 p.m.

This weekend, the organization
Students for a Democratic Society
has scheduled a trip to Georgia to
participate in an annual protest
against the Western Hemisphere
Institute for Security Cooperation,
formerly named and still largely
known as the School of the
Americas.
In preparation, participating students attended a workshop in nonviolent response to conflicts headed
by Bryan Kelly, a representative of
Training for Change. The goal of
the workshop was to establish a
framework for determining what
constitutes a violent act and then to
provide strategies for avoiding or
deescalating violent situations if
they occur.
One activity involved having
participants stand on different sides
of the room according to whether
they agree with a given statement or
not. In this case, they were asked to
give their opinion on whether the
acts of eating meat, self-immolation,
property destruction and yelling at
a police officer constitute violence.
Katie Schaffer 'l2 said, "[Bryan
Kelly] wanted to leave room for subtleties of opinion," so participants
also broke into small groups to discuss how they conceived of the
meaning of the term non-violence
and of various issues in the violence
versus non-violence dichotomy.
Following that, the group enacted
various, potentially violent situations from the perspective of both
the protesters and their respondents. These situations ranged from
a confrontation with a resident who
did not want a protester standing on
his lawn to confronting a police officer who misinterpreted a non-violent act as violent, a scenario
Schaffer described as "useful, but
less realistic for us to encounter."

This training and discussion will
be put into practice this weekend at
Fort Benning, Georgia, home of
School of the Americas. The school
is a government-run training
ground for Latin American soldiers
and policemen that has gained notoriety for training soldiers who
served such oppressive leaders as
Panama's Manuel Noriega and
Bolivia's Hugo Banzer. Originally
founded in 1946, the organization
sought to protect American investments in Central America. Now,
according to Professor Aurora
Camacho de Schmidt, it serves as
"an expedient means for the U.S. to
exercise control over the South
American continent. It was cast

under the anti-Communist Cold War

mentality, and still plays to a myth
of hemispheric security."
However, according to Camacho
de Schmidt, the organization does
protect
not
actually
South
American countries' populations; it
oppresses them. "Unlike in the U.S.,
in Latin America, the enemy has
always come from the inside. These

[students] are being trained in the
art of counter insurgency and
oppression," Camacho de Schmidt

said.

"[The school is] an
expedient means for
the U.S. to exercise
control over the South
American continent."
Professor Aurora
Camacho de Schmidt
The protestors seek the abolition
of this institution. Schaffer said, "I
take very black-and-white moral
stance on the issue. There is nothing beneficial about a place whose
goal is to give America a level of
control over South America. It's
completely immoral.".
Historically, this protest has
made an impact. Several years ago,
an amendment seeking the abolition
of the School of the Americas was
proposed in Congress. It was shot
down by nearly a two-thirds majority. Recently, after years of protest
that exerted pressure on politicians
to pass the bill, the proposal was
defeated by a mere six votes.
In 2001 the school changed its
name from the School of the
Americas
to
the
Western
Hemisphere Institute for Security
and Cooperation, a move, according
to Professor Benjamin Berger, that
"was probably influenced by the
negative publicity and increasing
scrutiny that the protest movement
focused on the SOA. It was really

just a cosmetic change," but clearly
indicates a response to pressure for

change.

Attendance at this particular
is paramount because, as
Schaffer said, "it could be the year
that the bill passes," both due to the
close margin of the previous vote
and to the election ofBarack Obama
and
Democratic
Congress.
a
Hopefully, Camacho de Schmidt
said, this inundation of new politicians will usher in new era for relations between Latin America and
the United States, one "built on
respect for human rights, a commitment to peace, and an abandonment
of old modes of thinking that have
proven horribly destructive."
The movement has the added
effect of raising awareness of Latin
American issues. This movement,
Camacho de Schmidt said, "has a
way of establishing solidarity
between the young people of the
United States and struggles of Latin
America, especially insofar as it
helps recover the memory [of such

'Conversations' reaches out to mentor and aid Asian students
learning process. Our goal is to interact collaboratively."

BY JONATHAN EMONT

jemontl@swarthmore.edu
Signaling its desire for more expansive community outreach, the Swarthmore Asian Organization has teamed up
with Han and Deshi for the first segment of "High School
Conversations." Scheduled for this Saturday, the organizers
of "High School Conversations" are bringing local Asian
high school students to Swarthmore to educate them about
the college application process, to begin a mentoring program and to discuss identity issues regarding the students'
ethnicities.
The students participating in the program attend Bodine
High School for International Affairs, a magnet school in
the Philadelphia area where many of them are active in the
school's Asian Club. As primarily second-generation immigrants from working class backgrounds, most of the students are oblivious to the complexities of the college application process.
Gina Hart 'Ol, leader of the high school Asian Club and
"High School Conversations" project coordinator, said,
"What prevents my students from applying to schools like
Swarthmore is not their lack of ability but their lack of
knowledge about how to apply to schools like Swarthmore.
Their perception of college is mainly shaped by television."
In preparation for Saturday's event, Professor of History
Sonia Lee visited Bodine with a contingent of SAO members. Of the students she met, Professor Lee said, "They
were a group of very self-motivated students, but when I
spoke to them about college, they had no clue."
The day's focus is not only on college, however.
Organizers hope to establish a mentoring program pairing
self-identified Asian Swarthmore students with their local
high school counterparts. Arthur Chyan 'lO, SAO president,
said Swarthmore students have a lot to teach their assigned
students
and vice-versa. "We're expecting a reciprocal

Most of the Swarthmore students come from a middle
and upper-middle class background, and are therefore likely to be wealthier than the students with whom they're
paired. "We're hoping this will make for interesting discussions about Asian identity," Chyan said. Sonia Lee said discussions with Asian students had led her to conclude,
"Among Asian studentsthere is no coherent understanding
about who they are." She hoped discussions between students of different income levels would "help make things
clearer."
The students will arrive at Swarthmore on Saturday
morning. After taking a campus tour and eating at Sharpies,
they will attend a presentation by Rafael Zapata, director of
the Intercultural Center, on scholarship opportunities for
low-incomestudents. Then, Andrea Pien 'OB, a worker in the
Admissions Office, will give a talk on both the application
process in general and applying to Swarthmore in particular. "Underserved communities have misconceptions about
college admissions," Pien said. "We'll do everything we can
to make the process seem clearer." After Pien's half-hour
long presentation, the visiting high school students will
present for an hour about the conditions that affect their
communities and about negotiating their Asian identities
in a school that has very few Asians and, according to Gina
Hart, not a single Asian teacher.
Their presentation will be followed by an equally long
presentation by Swarthmore students about their experiences at Swarthmore and about the community involvement they hope to work at with the high school students.
The presentation by Swarthmore students will take the
form of a panel discussion and the local high school students will be invited to ask questions of the Swarthmore
students.
The students at Bodine High School were admitted based
on an entrance exam, and the school is among the most

thatthe younger students would benefit from the mentoring
program. "We're really hoping for this to be sustainable.
We're hoping to maintainthe program, to continue working
with these students."
The effort to work with high school students is indicative ofSAO's greater efforts to expand outreach into the surrounding communities. Chyan said, "The project on a whole
is an effort to do more community outreach as an organization." The group plans to work with the Asian community
in Philadelphia to prevent the building of a Foxwoods
Casino near Chinatown, citing studies that have shown
Asian-Americans to be more prone to gambling addictions
than Americans at large.
Another project in the early stages of development would

have SAO members working with adoptees ofAsian descent
to negotiate their Asian identities. Chyan cautions, however, that before any members of SAO pursue the plan further,
they will get some type of training at the Intercultural
Center.
John Dinh 'l2, a member of SAO and a proponent of the
outreach attempts, said that he believes reaching out to
local high school students is especially important. "In Asian
culture, it can sometimes be difficult for people to speak
with their parents about certain things... All my parents
ever said to me about college was, 'Make sure you go to college all right?' I'm hopeful that after speaking with us, these
students will have a better understanding of how the
process works."

visit Swarthmore will go on to attend college. Even though
some of the high school students are in ninth grade, and
may not have even begun to think about college, Chyan said
that this would be a good opportunity to teach the young
students about the college application process. "It will provide a nice introduction," Chyan said. He had special hopes

College prepares Middle States reaccreditatlon
This year, Swarthmore is up for
review by the Middle States
Commission on Higher Education, an
organization that accredits colleges
and universities across America.
Chaired by Ellen Magenheim,
Professor of Economics, the Middle
States Steering Committee, which is
composed of fifteen faculty members,
will perform and documenta self-evaldemonstrating
uation
that
Swarthmore meets Middle States'
standards ofexcellence.
Middle States has lain out fourteen
points that the College must address to
be awarded reaccreditation, some of
which include institutional resources,
integrity, and student admissions and
retentions.
These points are
addressed first by a self-study the committee completes and then an outside
committee, composed of faculty from
other colleges, which reviews the college as well.
Magenheim stressed the importance of having a complete self study,
which will be released to the College
community for feedback once written.
"Really what we want is for people to
look at the report and say, 'Does this
fully and accurately convey who we
are, whatthe college is?' When the visiting team comes, their approach will
be informed by what the self study
says so we really want it to be an accuour strengths and also
rate picture
the challenges we face."
Swarthmore's 2020 campaign, an
effort to improve the college based in
the needs of each division of the college, is an integral part of the process.
Planning
The
2020
Steering
Committee, along with the Middle
States Steering Committee and eight

other planning groups, are all working
together to review the College. "The
2020 Planning process is really an
independent process, something we at
Swarthmore wanted to do. It would
have happened independent of Middle
States. We integrated the two because
it seemed more valuable that way,"
Magenheim said.
Swarthmore was last reaccredited
in 1999. "We are confident we merit
reaccreditation. The process gives us
an opportunity to take a snapshot of
who we are and realize what we have
accomplished,"
said
Constance
Hungerford, Provost and member of
the Middle States Committee.
"I am sure we will be reaccredited,
and that is what would be expected
The process will give the review team
(an independent group of academics) a
substantial first-hand view of what we
do and who we are. That is important
because people chosen for work on
these teams are in a position to appreciate what we do that is unique and
remarkable and the impression they
take away will effect the external,
impression of the College in academic
circles," Rachel Merz, Professor of
Biology and a member of the Middle
States Steering Committe, said inanemail.
While the self-study will be available to the entire college and to all
involved in the process, it is unclear
whether it will be available for those
outside the College community. "The
self study will be available to anyone
in the college community. We haven't
talked abouthow it might be used [outside the college}," said Mspwiheim.

Proposition 8 awakens activism in youth
BY BEN THALER
THE DAILY BRUIN (UCLA)
The passage of Proposition 8 has energized
(U-WIRE)
a large contingent of college students to become political
activists, according to university and student sources at
UCLA.
Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to
define marriage as between a man and a woman, was
passed by voters on Election Day in California. A day after
its passage, thousands of people began to rally and march
in protest.
The protests have continued in different parts of the
city up through this past weekend.
Fourth-year political science student Dave Valk was
present at the first rally and has attended several others
since then. He said a large number of the protesters were
previously politically apathetic people in their 20s.
"For a long time young people, including myself, have
been complacent and satisfied with the way things were
going. But Proposition B's passage struck a chord because
it is denying citizens equal opportunity and equal access,"
Valk said. Valk added that the initial rallies were sponsored by established lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations, but since then the protests have been
directed by independent people of various ages.
Danny Torres Lopez, the director of the Queer Alliance,
said he has also seen a substantial rise in young people
under the age of 30 who have taken an active role protesting Proposition 8.
"If you look at the trends, young people are overwhelmingly against Proposition 8. Young people are also
coming out at an earlier age than ever.Uo I have seen a lot
of youth at the protests, even high schoolers," Torres Lopez
said.

Torres Lopez added that many straight students have
come out to support their friends at the protests.
Emily Rokosch, the assistant director of the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender center, said she has seen
students show a new level of passion regarding
Proposition 8. "It's great that college students are getting
passionate and standing up for issues they believe in. At
the center we've observed a large number of student leaders who have really stood up and took an active leadership
role," Rokosch said. Rokosch attributed the increased
youth activism to the growing clout that many young people have today. "Young people feel their voices are heard,
that they will be listened to, and I'm not sure it was that
way in the past," she said.

"If you look at the trends, young
people are overwhelmingly against
Proposition 8."
Torres Lopez
Despite the apparent increase in youth activism, their
passion did not translate to action at the voting booth, said
Naomi Goldberg, a public policy fellow at the Williams
Institute at the UCLA School ofLaw.
"Though voters from the age of 18 to 24 voted more than
2-1 against Proposition 8, they did not proportionately represent their population in the final tally," Goldberg said.
Goldberg added that she has noticed a considerable
amount of youth activism regarding Proposition 8, but
said that it is possible many of them did not end up voting.

"Just like we saw with Obama, many youth were excited and passionate but did not end up going to the polls,"
Goldberg said.
Not all of the young people fired up about Proposition 8
are its opponents. A significant number have joined
Facebook groups by the thousands supporting the proposition. David Schmidt, a 24-year-old man from Fresno, Calif.,
created a Web site called iSupportMarriage.com and has
enlisted more than 10,000 members in his Facebook group,
which he said are primarily college students.
Schmidt said he was concerned about what he says is
the combative nature of many anti-Proposition 8 protesters.
"The people of California have affirmed their wishes to
define marriage as between one man and one woman. My
focus now is on safety and education, as many Proposition
8 supporters have received threats," Schmidt said.
Schmidt said he was not surprised that many youth
were taking to the streets against Proposition 8.
"[Gay community members] express themselves in bold
ways," he said. "We see that in their street celebrations
so it is not surprising to see them continuing to express
themselves."
Valk said he believes a defining moment of the protests
came during the first rally at a Mormon temple.
"It was just a bunch of us, mostly young, spontaneously coming together. Some of the older crowd warned us to
go back but we kept on going and dispersing in different
directions," Valk said. Valk added that the number of
youth who have been politically involved creates a new
opportunity for coalition-building in the LGBT communi...

ty.

"This is not a one-time thing. This is our golden opportunity to bring the young leadership together, from all different backgrounds, to work for a common cause," he said.

to apply for a job after graduating," she
said.
Wolfram suggested that students looking
for internships complete informational
interviews, which include asking industry
professionals their advice for students seeking internships.
Kendall Rooney, senior, completed an
internship with Ruder Finn, a public rela-

tions agency, last summer. At the end of the

internship, her supervisor told her she
could return to the company after graduation. She said she was relieved, considering
the state of the economy.
"I was in shock and very grateful to have
an offer like that from such an amazing
company," she said.
Rooney said her internship was vital in
helping her develop professionally and personally. She said the secret to her internship success- was actively seeking out
responsibility. She said when she would
complete her assigned work, she would ask
everyone in the office if there was anything
she could do to help them.
"Of course I got stressed because I didn't
want to fail," she said. "But to me it was a
good stress because they were giving me
more responsibilities, so I felt privileged to
have that stress."
Laura Swick, senior, is doing a
practicum at the Hope House For Battered
Women in Independence, Mo., to fulfill her
social welfare graduation requirements.
Swick said it was helpful to be able to apply
everything she learned in class at her
internship. "It's not like I'm learning a concept I'll never use," she said. "It's something I use now, and I can see how eventually I will use it for my real job as well."

When Tina Fey appeared
on Saturday Night Live in a red power suit,
winking and mavericking, viewers immediately knew: There's Sarah Palin. And
according to NYU researchers, the resemblance has more to it than glasses and an

said. "We're not trying to interpret those
results; that's normally done by psychologists. We're justreporting back. We leave it

Surprisingly, however, researchers also

updo.

NYU's
Courant
Institute
of
Mathematical Sciences found that Fey not
only looks and sounds like Palin, she moves
like her, too.
An analysis of Fey's performance was
studied by the GreenDot Project, which
examines human motion. Scientists hope to
eventually use this biometric technology to
tell not only who someone is, but also their
emotional state and cultural background.
The video studied was from the SNL
episode in October that featured appearances from both Fey and Palin.
The study measured the "Palin-ness" of
facial and body movement by recognizing
patterns of unique motion in a given scene.
In the corner of the screen, a pink bar measured how similar Fey's motions were to
Palm's.
When Palin came on-screen later in the
video, viewers could see the level of the
pink bar stayed relatively even. At some
points, Fey was more Palin-esque than the
former vice-presidential candidate herself.
Research also tried to compare the
motions of Barack Obama and John
McCain to other foreign leaders. The dots
showed that Obama is surprisingly similar
to French President Nicolas Sarko2y
"He has a totally different body language
than German Angela Merkel, but similar to

"McCain has

has more free flow, which is why he's closer
to Obama, who's much looser than McCain.
We also thought that since [Hillary] Clinton
and Obama were fighting each other so
much during the primaries, they must be
totally different, but in the big scale ofinternational politics, they're not."
Currently, there is a 20 percent error
rate on the findings of the GreenDot program. The Courant Institute is waiting on
confirmation of funding that will allow
themto continue research for the next three
years, just in time for the 2012 primaries to
start.

party and moderately-attractive nerd girls nodded
approvingly. I played it for my mother in the car and she
said it gave her a headache and would I please turn it off.
This was staggering. I was listening to a record that
annoyed my parents. A whole new world of discordant,
marginally alternative music unfolded before me.
As the souls of the irredeemable damned are upon the

FLETCHER WORTMANN
We Are Far Too Young and Clever
From seventh grade on, I attended the improbablynamed Beaver Country Day School. It should not surprise regular readers of this column that Teen Fletcher
did not straddle triumphant the apex of the adolescent
social pyramid. There were many, many reasons why I
did not fit in. Prominent among these was the fact that
my mostly white, mostly affluent classmates listened
exclusively to hip-hop, and I did not. Their music implied
a deep concern with busting caps in unfortunate places
and with issues of bitches, and also of hos; they regularly encouraged me to throw my hands in the air, so as to
signify that I was a true player. Sadly, I myself was
unable to enjoy such simple pleasures of cultural imperialism. I listened to The Beatles, The Stones and The
Who. I listened to Led Zeppelin because, although I was
disquieted by the numerous Satanism references, I was
comprehensively re-quieted by the numerous Hobbit references. I listened to Simon and Garfunkel and I
clenched my fists and wept with tortured introspective
empathy. This was my rebellion. I wanted to confront,
not the "man," but the 11th grader in the saggy trousers
and the $6OO sneakers. And so I felt a little fiery twinge of
vindication every time I blasted Joni Mitchell's "Chelsea
Morning" through my Discman.
As a fan of decades-old, culturally irrelevant music,
my favorite magazine was "Rolling Stone." In one issue,
lodged between an interview with a popular Canadian
artist with an extremely tenuous grasp of irony and an
interview with a popular Canadian artist apparently
unable to spell "skater boy" correctly (Quebec's public
schools clearly require significant restructuring), was a
review that caught my eye. "Rolling Stone," you see,
employs a rigid three to three-and-one-half star grading
scale. What I'd found was a review that, in violation of
the fundamental principles of mediocre music journalism, rated an album four stars. This record was profound, they claimed, prophetic and messianic; if Jesus
had made rock music and srimehowrock-star Jesus in no
way resembled Bono as one would expect him to, then
this is probably what he would play. The album was

day of judgment cast from purgatory into Hades itself, so
I graduated and came to my beloved Swarthmore. Things
were different here. People listened to the same music I
did, only more so. Here, if you tuned your radio accurately to three decimal places and stood on top of a tall
building and listened between six-twenty and sixtwenty-five, you might hear through
the. static a Yo La Tengo song,
played three times in a row. And

here the other students listened
to bands that weren't even
played on the radio, bands
that they'd read about on
blogs. Blogs! I didn't know
that people could have blogs,

attended concerts here, real

the names were never stupid enough, the music never
obtuse and dissonant enough. Somewhere, there exists a
band playing neo-psychedelic harmonic electronic
garage-revival post-rock for an audience of zero. The
proverbial white-striped whale, the event horizon of
indie rock. I wasted precious years of my life hunting it;
had I not turned away in time I would certainly have
been destroyed.
Pop culture is moving on now. The indie aesthetic has
reached saturation point. I'm not sure exactly when this
occurred; perhaps when, during a marathon Disney
Channel-viewing session, I observed a trio of floppyhaired jangly-guitarists discussing the importance of
abstinence, especially while one is dating a blood,
relative of Billy Ray Cyrus (really, isn't this
common sense?). The mainstream is consuming the
margins, pop is eating
itself, that guy with the
expensive sneakers is
now wearing Converse

Soon everyone will be
sick of indie. I admit that

I can hear the sniggering of the cool kids, the ones
who were Breaking Social Scenes and Neutralizing Hotel

very tight electrical pants. You see, every song that I'd
heard before The Strokes had some kind of recognizable
human experience at its core. Every song was about love,
or about heartbreak, or about a disappointingly superficial debate vis-a-vis the cinematic merits of "Breakfast at

Boards brings a touch ofhome to Olde Club i:fiEH!o ISSUES

BY APOLLINE BERTY
abertyl@swarthmore.edu
"I have food poisoning, but don't pay attention to
that," Andrew Hoepfner, the front man of Brooklynbased Creaky Boards said, showing a small but intimate Olde Club audience the bucket he brought with
him on stage at a performance last Friday, Nov. 14.
Playing songs off of their latest album, "Brooklyn Is
Love," the four-member indie pop group combined
early 50s and 60s pop, Beach Boys-esque harmonies,
jaunty keyboards and wistful, dreamy lyrics to bring
Swarthmore a fun, earnest and lightheartedly youthful
performance full of soaring melodies, foot-stomping
rhythms and hometown nostalgia. And though he
brought the bucket on stage, Hoepfner never ended up
using it. "I think I'm feeling better," he admitted after
playing the first song. "Music is a healing force."
Though Creaky Boards is a, four-piece, it is
Hoepfner who remains at its center. Adopting the
moniker when he moved to New York City
Jfe in 2004, Hoepfner has made Creaky
m
Boards his creative project, writing
music about the city that seems to be a

his own band outside of Creaky Boards. "Andrew's not
only responsible for writing the songs and playing a lot
of the parts on the album, but he also recorded them in
his room," Costello added.
Although Hoepfner and drummer Michael David
Campbell have known each other since childhood, the
rest of the members of the band met through the songwriter scene in the East Village. Beginning as a folkpunk duo with Hoepfner and trumpeter Jason
Benjamin in the winter of 2004, Creaky Boards released
its first album, "Where's the Sunshine?" in 2005, and
though the structure of the band remains fluid as
Hoepfner's friends migrate eastward from Michigan
and join, they consistently create music that is idiosyncratic, buoyantly poppy and surprisingly fresh.
Although Hoepfner's chronic hand pain almost forced
the group to disband toward the end of 2005, Hoepfner's
übiquitous desire to use the springboard of creativity
that New York life offers to create caused Creaky
Boards to re-emerge one year later.
Inching their way into the spotlight over the summer, Creaky Boards garnered some attention over a
video Hoepfner posted on YouTube in which he insisted that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin copied the
melody of the band's (ironically titled) song "The
Songs I Didn't Write" for their iTunes hit, "Viva La
Vida."
"Here's the thing on this whole thing, it was a PR
stunt and it worked. We had no idea that it would work
that much, but a lot of people saw it and that's great,"
lead guitarist Darwin Deez said. The band then joked
that they're now rolling in money with fancy cars, but
Andrew still sees the video as just a fun project he did
over the weekend, not expecting that thousands of people would end up watching it.

Friday night. Despite the somewhat subdued
audience, Ponytail proved that lyrics involving
those pesky things traditionally known as

words are for squares.
Playing songs from "Ice Cream Spiritual"
and earlier recordings, the band revealed a penchant for classic guitar riffs and a contained
wall of sound aesthetic. In contrast, the nonverbal howls of frontwoman Molly Siegel (who acts
like the love child of Karen O and Iggy Pop) and
guitarist Dustin Wong were both avant-garde
and invigorating.
Siegel's stage antics added some fire to
Ponytail's set and encouraged the audience to
actively engage with the performance. Grinning
and grimacing, Siegel hopped from foot to foot
while egging her spectators on with cries of Ya!
Ya?" Ultimately, it was Ponytail's layering of
more traditional guitar and drum sound with an
atypical approach to vocals that made enduring
another cold night in Olde Club worth it.
The Phoenix was able to catch up with Siegel
and drummer Jeremy Hyman before their set.
Here's what they had to say about everything

'Wondrous' life of Junot Diaz 365 plays in one day

BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu
Last Friday, Nov. 14, DominicanAmerican writer Junot Diaz, author of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Brief
and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,"
indulged fiction lovers on campus with a
reading from his award-winning book,
offering insights into his own writing
process and advice for aspiring authors
(along with the occasional admission of
more personal details like, oh, say, what
his fantasy super power might be) in the
question and answer period that followed.
After Associate Dean and Director of
the Intercultural Center Rafael Zapata
introduced Diaz as a longtime friend, the
Dominican-American writer read an
excerpt from "The Brief and Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao," his most acclaimed
work.
"Oscar Wao" tells the story of a nerdy,
overweight Dominican-American boy
growing up in New Jersey. Oscar has passion a for science fiction, fantasy and
women and is perpetually preoccupied
with the curse of the fukii, which he
believes has plagued his family for generations and that dates back to the colonization and slavery of the Caribbean. An
admitted bibliophile, Diaz explained that
the novel was in part a way for him to
show his admiration for books by incorporating references to classic literature into,
the text. The very title of the novel is,'
according to Diaz, an allusion to both
Oscar Wilde and Ernest Hemingway's
short story "The Short Happy Life of
Francis Macomber."
The passage of "Oscar Wao" that Diaz
chose to narrate related the story of
(Oscar's sister's) Lola's discovery of her
mother's breast cancer. Poignant and emotionally powerful, the scene that Diaz
chose to share with the audience underscored the terrifying difficulty of trying to
come to terms with the knowledge of a
parent's sickness and explored the multilayered complexities of mother-daughter

relationships.
After his reading, Diaz fielded a number of questions that ranged from his literary inspirations to his fantasy super
power.

"This was a moment for you all to really shine and you saw it," Diaz said of the
audience's questions. "The questions that
people were asking were fucking deep.
People came here to make me work, and I
really appreciated that. You don't come to
these things because you don't want to be
helpful. You come because you want to be
in conversation with young people."
"These things are less about celebrating
the artist and more about celebrating the
community," he added, expressing his admi-

14

ration of Swarthmore's student body.
Diaz also took the time to give budding
novelists advice about escaping the autobiographical element in their writing.
"You've got to disfigure the autobiographical element in the story in a productive
way," he said. "This means that even
though I'm talking about my life, I have to
imagine every scene that was my life
anew," he continued, illustrating this
point by referencing his first work, a collection of short stories entitled "Drown."
When writing one of those short stories,
Diaz added a physical disfigurement to the
protagonist in the earlier drafts of the
text. Though he later removed any mention of this disfigurement in the final edits
of the work, adding it into the story during the writing process allowed him to
gain the distance he needed from his char-

acter.
Arlyss Gease 'lO, who was introduced
to Diaz's work last spring in Professor
Gregory Frost's Fiction Workshop, found
Diaz's reading from "Oscar Wao" helpful
in understanding how the author commu-

nicates his ideas within the structure of
the narrative: "I really enjoyed hearing
him read the passage because it makes the
connection a little bit clearer between
what he's thinking when he writes and
what we get from it," Gease said.
After the event, Diaz stood by the table
where his books were being sold as a huge
line formed in front of him. Diaz stayed
and signed every single copy presented to
him, taking the time to talk with each person in line. Later that same day, Diaz gave
another talk to the Latino community of
Philadelphia at the cultural arts organization Taller Puertorriqueno.
According to Zapata, the IC has been
working since last February to bring Diaz
to campus with the help of the Cooper
Foundation. "All the performances that we
bring, we try to mix it up to reflect the
diversity of our constituents," Zapata said,
stressing the multiplicity of the IC community.

The Intercultural Center ultimately
chose Diaz to speak at Swarthmore,
Zapata said, not only because he is an
acclaimed writer, but also because his literature raises fundamental questions
regarding the relationships between families and the role that immigration plays in
those relationships.
"I thought it went extremely well,"
Zapata said of the event. "I was very
happy with the turnout, it looked like
LPAC cinema was the perfrect venue and
that just about all the seats were taken,
with some people sitting on the floor," he
added. "Together, we were able to put
together something that the whole college
community could participate in and
enjoy."

In November of 2002, Pulitzer Prize and MacArthur-winning playwright SuzanLori Parks undertook the ambitious project of writing one brief play every day for
365 consecutive days. According to a New York Times article published on Nov. 10,
2006, "Subject matter for the plays, most only a few pages long, ranges from deities
to soldiers to what Ms. Parks saw out of her plane window." In honor of Parks theatrical feat, Swarthmore's Drama Board will perform 23 excerpts from the playwright's "365 Days/365 Plays" project this weekend.
Over the past week, Drama Board has been working tirelessly to pull together a
production out of the disparate excerpts."36s Days/365 Plays" director Sam
Goodman 10 was drawn to Parks' work because it captures the mundane snapshots
of everyday life and transforms them into art. "These plays are snapshots. They provide a record of the author's life, feelings and emotions, of things that were on her
mind and that we can identify with very easily," Goodman said. In conceptualizing
the production, Goodman wanted to capture Parks' thematic emphasis on change
and development. "That's what I wanted to show by having actors go from one play
to another, from one character to another. It's as if these characters pass through the
plays at some moment in their lives," Goodman said.
A small cast and dedicated support team worked assiduously to bring Goodman's
vision to fruition. Assistant director Allison Flamm 'O9, who has worked closely
with the nine actors and 14 other members of the production team, expressed her
admiration of the commitment and talent of everyone involved. "We have a very
exciting team of production people and a very talented cast. Everyone is dedicated
and people are serious about creating art," Flamm said.
Nell Bang-Jensen 'll, who stars in 11 of the plays, said that it is rewarding to participate in a broader celebration of Parks' phenomenal project. "It's great to be part
of the bigger movement. They're performing her plays on campuses all over the
country," Bang-Jensen said. As a theater minor with previous acting experience,
Bang-Jensen wanted to get involved in the project because she saw it as a unique
and challenging opportunity. "You rarely get to play these many different roles and
to improvise that much. The freedom is simply wonderful, but the entire process
required a lot of trust," Bang-Jensen said.
Simone Fried 'lO, fellow cast member, found that her extensive dance background
helped her connect with the challenging character she plays. Her previous acting
experience motivated her to get involved, but she considers her work with dance her
greatest theatrical asset. "I think the reason I was chosen was that I was tuned with
my physicality and able to move in unusual ways and Ali and Sam [director and
assistant director] were interested in movement in this performance."
Josh Cockroft 'l2 joined the team out of sheer enthusiasm for the project and a
strong passion for theater. With an impressive background in acting, playwriting
and directing, he jumped right into the production. "It really has been a great experience, I've enjoyed working with people who are as committed as I am. They have
a deeper understanding of the material than I've ever encountered before," Cockroft
said.
The Lang Performing Arts Center and Theater Department provided support
throughout the process, which impressed the cast and crew. "It was a great thing to
do, since this wasn't a department, but a Drama Board production," Goodman said.
Audience involvement is a unique feature of the performance and the location was
chosen to support this participatory dynamic. "Emma Ferguson, our set designer,
has done a great job arranging the locations for various plays. The audience has the
possibility to walk around and see different plays at almost the same time,"
Goodman said, adding that he got his inspiration from outdoor theater projects,
such as "Shakespeare in the Park".
. With the premiere rapidly approaching, the production team is confident that a
supportive audience will help them work through last-minute anxieties. "I hope [the
audience is] as excited as we are. It will be a unique and dynamic performance."
Even if the fast-moving sequence of diverse excerpts is at times difficult
to follow,
Goodman said he hopes the audience will appreciate the thematic elements that
bind the separate scenes into a cohesive body of work. "The audience will enjoy
individual plays, but I hope that consciously or unconsciously, they will appreciate
the greater work, be drawn into the piece as a whole and see the characters' subtle

development."
"365 Days/365 Plays" will be performed in Upper Tarble from 8 p.m. to 9:3opm on

Columnist lays down the law with terrible movies
swarthmorephoenix.com

CjP

Every so often,
you come across a
news story so
absurd that it just

begs to be written
about. Last week, I

found

one.

Christopher

Nolan, director of
the
Batman
movies "Batman
Begins" (2005) and
"The
Dark

JOEL SWANSON
They're Watching

Knight" (2008), is
being sued by the
city of Batman,
Turkey.

Yes, you read
that correctly.
Apparently,

the city of Batman
(which is, of course, located on the Batman River and is the

capital ofBatman Province), is having some difficulties.The
city first grew as

a result of the construction of an oil refin-

ery during the 19505. Now that industry has left, however,
unemployment is high and Batman is facing a wave of crime

and an unprecedented number of suicides. What has Mayor
Huseyin Kalkan decided to do about these problems? If
you're thinking, "invest in social services and mental health
clinics," you're wrong. No, Mayor Kalkan has decided to
invigorate Batman's economy by suing Christopher Nolan
for stealing the name of his city. Never mind the fact that
Batman has existed as a character since 1939 and that it isn't
actually copyright infringement to just steal the name of a
place anyhow. According to Mayor Kalkan, "There is only
one Batman in the world" That Batman, of course, is
Batman, Turkey.
I tried long and hard to think of a way that this lawsuit is
actually brilliant, but I couldn't come up with one.
Nevertheless, it did get me thinking: What if other places
attempted to sue filmmakers? What other lawsuits would we
see? Naturally,being the intrepid moviecolumnist that I am,

I had to investigate the possibilities. Here are the ideas I
came up with:

Pearl Harbor National Historic Landmark v. Michael Bay
Michael Bay not only stole the name of a historic landmark for his 2001 flop "Pearl Harbor," but he had the audacity to turn it into a terrible movie as well. The memories of
those who died on that day that will live in infamy do not
deserve to be associated with this film. Clearly we have an
emotional damages suit on our hands here.
City of Seattle v. Meg Ryan
No city really deserves to be known primarily for
a bad romantic comedy. Seattle certainly does not
deserve to be associated with bad, overly cute
movies that start with the words "Sleepless In." If
anyone has ever watched this movie, and has
thought that a lovely American city was a place
where cute, adolescent romantic fantasies really
occur, then Seattle may have a libel suit waiting to
be filed. Not only did they steal the name of a great
city, but the climax of the movie doesn't even take
place there. It would probably be preferable for
Seattle to be known for Bill Gates, Starbucks and
Kurt Cobain than for this movie.
Wales and Northern Ireland v. Mel Gibson
Because why should only Scotland get a movie
about its brave independence fighters struggling
against the hegemonic power that was imperial
England? What about the other British commonwealths?
Sure, you could say that there wouldn'tbe actual historical
events to base those other two movies on, but when has that
ever stopped Mel Gibson before? (Think of "Apocalypto.")

Wales and Northern Ireland seem to have an equal protection case here.

Rambo Department v. Sylvester Stallone
Yes, Rambo Department is a small subsection of Yatenga
Province in the West African nation of Burkina Faso. It even
has a lower GDP per capita than the city of Batman does, so
surely it has at least as much need to sue the creator of a

major film franchise for copyright infringement. Sure,
Sylvester Stallone may have been paying homage to the
grasslands and villages of the region, but that's probably
ascribing a level of cultural sensitivity that the creator of
bad action movies like this one is unlikely to possess.
City of New York v. Michael Bay
Okay, so one can never mock Michael Bay too much. In
his classic clunker "Armageddon", he even depicts New York
getting hit by a meteor. I'm not sure what law that breaks,
but it has to be against some law of some sort. Or, if nothing else, we ought to just sue Michael Bay for making
such terrible movies. There should be some way ofrevoking his filmmaking license, or at
least sentencing him to
attend compulsory class-

es on the films of the
New Wave.

I can't help but wonder, however, what would happen to
filmmakers around the world if that began to happen. Would
they no longer be able to make movies that reference real
locations in any way? Maybe we would be forced to bring
back movies about fictional planets and there would be a
renaissance of science fiction filmmaking. Or maybe we
would just see a hell of a lot of movies set in New Yrok Or
Washington, CD. That might not be so bad though. At least
it would give us something interesting to focus on the next
time Michael Bay makes a movie.

Bust out the tape player: lo-fi music thrives in a hi-tech world

LIANA KATZ

Digital
"I'm tired of using technology," sings
Justin Timberlake in "AYO Technology,"
his recent bizarre collaboration with 50
Cent. He isn't the only one. While JT is
singing about the sexy girl he met in the
club and how he craves old-fashioned
physicality, alternative musicians also
have a longstanding tradition of eschewing technological advancements. In
response to over-produced and sugarencrusted mainstream pop tracks, artists
often opt for outdated recording instruments and low fidelity fuzz.
"Lo-fi," as the plaid-clad kids of the
1990s and today call it, is a musical genre
that has its roots in the candid coughs and
awkward laughs of Bob Dylan's early

bootlegs. One of such tracks is accurately
named "Suze (The Cough Song)" and features a sweet guitar melody interrupted

THE PHOENIX

by Dylan's raucous hacking. Lo-fi truly
came into its own in the late 1980s and
early 1990s as bands began recording with
inexpensive equipment; first out of necessity and later out of a desire to cultivate a
particular disaffected sound. Many say
that American bands such as R.E.M and
Pavement pioneered and perfected the art
of 10-fi. There was also- a significant contingent of New Zealand bands like
Cakekitchen and The Chills, however,

industry recording studios and technology,
their sound tends to be more stripped down
and less commercially plastic.
At the beginning of the semester I
closed my first column with a mix tape
track listing. For the sake of symmetry, I
will leave you now with another list detailing some of the quintessential 10-fi bands
and singers. I hope you will be inspired to
make your own (very 10-fi) mix. All you
need is a tape player and a blank tape
which I hear are becoming collector items
these days! But, that is a topic for another
column...

bathroom while all of the musicians were
drunk off of cheap booze. On the surface,
"Come a Little Dog" sounds like your
average ditty about killing kittens and
puppies. If you dig a little deeper behind
the gratuitous animal yips, the lyrics
reveal some interesting albeit muddled
musings about love and loss. Lo-fi music
is not only concerned with producing an
organic aesthetic, but also with providing
an outlet for alternative artists to explore
situational emotions and ideas.
These days, 10-fi is not as powerful of a
musical ideology as it was in the latter
years of the 20th century. For most bands,
10-fi is an economically viable way to start
a recording career while also garnering
street cred in alternative and indie
scenes. Still, any music that counterbalances T-Pain's mechanized vocals and the
calculated moans of bands like The
Killers remains incredibly refreshing. On
a more positive note, 10-fi has been somewhat subsumed into burgeoning D.I.Y.
music culture. As artists are taking the

Hailing from California, Pavement's
early music was recorded at the private
studio of Gary Young, the slightly deranged
drummer who later joined the band. It was
purportedly due to Young's inability to
keep a beat that Pavement became known

for its messy and childlike sound. Even as
the band flirted with commercial success
in the early 19905, their records remained
unwieldy and exuberant.
Key record: "Crooked Rain, Crooked

The Kills
This minimalistic duo spent its early

years recording spoken-word pieces using
a four-track and tape machine. When The
Kills branched out into music, they record-

ed their first album using only a guitar,
drum machine, and 8-track. The album
cover featured homemade artwork and
photo booth pictures. In 2008, the band
recorded its third album digitally and
swore never to do so again.

Elliott Smith
Born Steven Paul Smith, Elliott is
largely known for his gloomy lyrics and
untimely death. His albums consistently
featured stripped-down guitar melodies
and honest vocals that spoke to his unsettling angst. Elliott was ultimately sabotaged by his own depression and substance abuse, causing his musical career
to collapse in the early 2000s.
Key record: "Either/Or" (1995)

Royal Trux
Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema
formed Royal Trux in the late 1980s and
focused on producing brash experimental
tracks that essentially amounted to atonal
rumblings. Later the band moved towards

a sparser sound, recording using an 8track. As Royal Trux ventured into the
world of tonality, they still were able to
preserve their straightforward yet challenging style.
Key record: "Untitled" (1992)

Chamilllonalre
Okay, he may now be a bonafide hiphop superstar but Chamillionaire cut his
teeth making self-produced mix tapes.' By
promoting and circulating these tapes in
the late 19905, Chamillionaire made vital
connections in the music industry that
would later catapult him to commercial
success.

BlackBerry in the White House: the politics of e-mail
An election news addicted America is
beginning to go into withdrawal. Now that
the hoopla leading up to Nov. 4 has subsided, Americans are starting to seek out
alternate ways to satisfy their cravings for a
constant drip of political communiques,
analysis and gossip.

Enter the human-interest stories about
Barack Obama. Making the rounds this
weekend was a piece in The New York
Times on the future of President-Elect
Obama and his campaign sidekick, the
Blackßerry. Mr. Obama, writes the author,
will likely be surrendering his mobile
phone and e-mail privileges when he
assumes office in January. The reasoning
behind depriving the President of his
Crackßerry, as the workaholic-enabling
devices are known, falls into two broad categories: security and privacy. Let's look at
each of these in turn.
Security has the greatest common sense
appeal but, paradoxically, is the least compelling of the arguments against the presidential use of e-mail. The Times quotes
Diana Owen of Georgetown University who
comments that even a supposedly infallible
security system protecting Mr. Obama's
electronic correspondence can be compromised. But a president's e-mail is no different from any of the other messages being
sent in the West Wing, all of which are
strongly protected; by Ms. Owen's logic, no
one in the White House ought to be sending
e-mail, which is clearly an absurd proposition. And while high-profile security
breaches in recent years, such as the publicizing of Sarah Palin's personal e-mail
account this year, have brought this issue to
the public's attention: breaking the security
systems of the federal government is hardly
a trivial matter. Put another way, there's a
big difference between guessing Sarah
Palin's password and breaking into a computer secured by the NSA. A hypothetical
doomsday scenario in which Mr. Obama's
personal correspondence is leaked is hardly
cause to rule out e-mail altogether.
The privacy issues faced by a president
in regards to his correspondence are vastly
different from those faced by individual citizens. The Presidential Records Act, passed

in 1978, makes any records created by the
President or Vice-President public property.
Accordingly, private individuals, lobby
groups or interested parties can demand,
under the Freedom of Information Act,
access to any of these records five years
after a President has left office.
There are several important qualifications in the act. First, presidents may
invoke up to six restrictions ontaccess to
their records, delaying public access for an
additional twelve years after they leave
office and once the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act come into
effect. President Bush, whose administration is already under fire for "misplacing"
over five million e-mail messages, has
invoked all six. Second, presidents may
purge, while in office, records which have
no administrative, historical, informational
or evidentiary value. Performed in coordination with and imder the strict supervision of the Archivist of the United States,
this filters out much of the banal, personal
communication that presidents would not
want exposed.
The complex nature of the Presidential
Records Act has led presidents in office
after the advent of e-mail to shun it, with
President Bush offering a farewell e-mail
address to his friends and family to the tune
of, "Since I do not want my private conversations looked at by those out to embarrass,
the only course of action is not to correspond in cyberspace."
But Mr. Obama is in a vastly different
position than President Bush, whose former
e-mail address, G94B@aol.com, harkens
back to simpler times when the internet and
technology were less pervasive parts of
daily life and the political process. From the
massively successful use of the Internet in
his campaign to his vows to be the first president with a Chief Technology Officer in the
White House, Mr. Obama has made himself
the first true president of the electronic age.
A retreat from his refreshing tech savvy
because of procedural concerns would be
disappointing for the legions of Americans
awaiting a government that is finally up to
speed on the technology evolving around it.
It is not the place of The Phoenix to tell

the President-Elect whether he should be e-

partisan National Archives and Records
Administration to establish such guide-

mailing; the decision should be his to make.
However, should he choose to become the
first e-mailing president, Mr. Obama should
seize the opportunity to set a clearly articulated precedent for future leaders to follow.
First of all, the rather ambiguous qualifications for when personal records can be
purged should be clarified. Clearly historians and scholars should not be denied the
opportunity to get an inside look into the
life of a president, but certain things are
indubitably irrelevant. Especially given
these records would only be coming to light
at the earliest five years after a president
has left office, the impact of such correspondence is questionable. If Mr. Obama emails the first lady about what they will eat
for dinner, such correspondence is no
more public domain than the e-mail

Swarthmore students send each other.
But where should the line be drawn? If
Mr. Obama were to, hypothetically, correspond by e-mail with his wife about his
daughters misbehaving in school, would
such knowledge be relevant to the public?
It's hard to say. But, however challenging,
it is the job of the Archivist and the non-

lines.
Second, Mr. Obama should seize upon
this issue as an opportunity to overhaul
the way the massive executive bureaucracy approaches documentation once and for
all. The loss, under President Bush, of several million e-mail messages is appalling,
but undoubtedly previous administrations
have also mishandled, misplaced, omitted,
deleted or otherwise failed to account for
some of their records.
If the Obama administration is committed to reversing the reputation of
Washington as a den of insider politics
and corruption, it should take the first
step internally, and use technology as a
tool to increase its accountability and
transparency. Digital content is both easier and cheaper to archive and organize
than print media. As such, Mr. Obama
and his advisors should commit to going
paperless to the greatest extent possible.

E-mail should be seen as an opportunity,

rather than a liability, and a president
eager to use it ought to be encouraged,

rather than spurned.

acceptance at Swarthmore College, I have made a point
of following campus news online in order to maintain a
sense of connection with the college. Over
time, I've begun to take the school's evident spirit of justice, awareness and
activism (in the words of President Al
Bloom, its "ethical intelligence") for granted. I was therefore alarmed and caught off guard when I learned of the
college's decision to hire a sharpshooter to manage the
Crum Woods deer population.
Killing over 20 deer per square mile of forest seemed
far out of line with my own sense of morality, but I did
recognize the "profound" threat that the deer posed to
the balance of the Crum Woods ecosystem, and I knew
that it needed to be addressed. Moreover, I knew how
important the woods were both to the college and to the
inhabitants of the surrounding communities. So I decided to investigate, in an effort to understand the full scope
of this issue and why the College had ruled out the nonlethal alternatives. I read the entire report issued by
Natural Resource Consultants Incorporated (NRC), I
read all of the announcements, articles and FAQ posted
on the Swarthmore College website and printed in the
student publications, I watched the video of the 2007 community meeting and I conducted ample research of my

own.

My concern was that the deer
were not getting the moral
consideration they deserved
and that their interests apparently
conflicted with our own.

My concern was that the deer were not getting the
moral consideration they deserved, for no better reason
than that they were animals and that their interests
apparently conflicted with our own. To avoid this mindset myself, I tried to consider the management options
from the point of view of the deer. Relatively speaking, a
bullet to the brain is just about the most "humane" way
to kill a man, but the profound impact that the death of
an individual can have upon the lives of his family and

THE PHOENIX

friends prevents any death sentence from ever being genuinely humane.
Analogously, the murder of the adult, female deer that
the sharpshooters would have to target in order to have
any effect won't just leave the rest of the herd ignorantly
content: it will result in the abandonment of the 40% of
the population that are still fawns, the 40% that counted
on spending the first 1-2 years of their lives with their
mothers but suddenly found themselves alone and uncared for.
In order for the college to reject the non-lethal alternatives to sharpshooting, these options would need to
have drawbacks at least equivalent to the sum total of
this great loss of sentient life and the suffering that it
would leave in its wake.
Yet my research only confirmed my suspicions, yielding contraception as a viable, conscionable alternative
with minimal drawbacks.
According to the NRC report, "The small home range
size and strong site fidelity of urban female deer suggest
localized management using immunocontraception is
theoretically possible in suburban communities, and
immunocontraceptive vaccines offer significant promise
for wildlife management (Turner and Kirkpatrick 1991,
Kilpatrick et al 1997, Warren et al 1997 and Kirkpatrick et
al. 2001)."
The most serious problems cited are that GonaCon,
one of the leading immunocontraceptives, is currently
only available on an experimental basis and that population reduction by attrition is slow. But, both in his official report and in his lecture at the 2007 community
meeting, Bryon Schlisser of NRC, Inc. repeatedly stated
that GonaCon had a strong chance of being approved for
commercial use in the very near future, and he praised it
as a tool that would prove highly useful in the management of wildlife populations.
More notably, the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) has documented in writing their belief
that GonaCon will be available in as few as six months

from now.
If the college has already taken over five years to act
upon the deer situation,-surely another six-month delay
cannot constitute a justification for mass killing.
More to the point, the Crum Woods, as a whole, are
not yet in a critical condition. Multiple times in his 2007
lecture, Schlisser commented that Swarthmore College
had decided to take up deer management at a much earlier stage than most of his other clients do. Confident in
the fundamental health of the forest, he went on to say, "I
think you'll find recovery here may be very quick." The
November 20,2008

2003 National Lands Trust (NLT) report confirms that,
"The deer population in the Crum Woods is not at levels
seen in other parts of the region, but... deer are-impact
ing the long-term health of the forest." Perhaps sharp
shooting would deserve serious consideration if the
Crum Woods ecosystem was more imminently threatened, but we're just not at that point.
Contraception could admittedly take up to a decade to
produce results, but, if fencing and various mitigation
and restoration techniques are needed to aid specific floral species in the interim, then so be it. The fact remains
that snapshooting is unnecessary, unwarranted and
unscrupulous, and I do not see how an institution as forward-thinking and upstanding as Swarthmore College
could endorse it.

I did recognize the "profound"
threat that the deer posed to the
balance of the Crum Woods
ecosystem, and I knew that it
needed to be addressed.
In the end, there is some chance that contraception
and other non-lethal ancillary measures will collectively
fail.
There is some chance that lethal means will prove the
only solution to the deer problem. But the NRC report
acknowledges that there is also some chance that sharpshooting will fail (especially if the college decides to substitute cheap, newly trained hunters for the professional
sharpshooting contractors who charge hundreds of dollars per deer killed). The reality is that no one knows for
sure which techniques will work and which ones will
not.

But we do know that contraception will allow the deer
to live out their full lives in peace, while sharpshooting
will cut dozens of lives short and leave many others in
the lurch. It is our moral obligation to make an honest
effort to employ immunocontraceptive vaccines in the
Crum Woods before we resign ourselves to this ghastly
cull.
I truly appreciate the time that you have taken to read
and consider this important letter. It's not too late to
rethink and reverse this unethical decision, but the clock
is ticking.

sion against the queer community; these new laws
are serious obstacles that stand in the way of equality for queer people in all communities. As a result
of these electoral disappointments, the passage of
Prop. 8 in particular, many have attempted to
explain away the course of events, saying that they
arose from conflict between the queer community
and the black community. Thus, to improve our
position in society, we must also examine our commitments to improved relations between members
of our own community.
Whether these efforts have been originating primarily from racist members of the queer community who can't imagine a queer community that
includes more than one ethnicity or from homophobic African Americans who would like to disown the queer members of its community, the fact
is that the two communities are not mutually exclusive. To act as if there is no overlap is to deny the
encompassing nature of our queer community. We

These are dark days for the queer movement,
though loaded with much historical importance.
We still find ourselves governed by a lame duck
administration that is antagonistic to most marginalized communities, especially the LGBT community. Yet, two months from now, a new administration will be entering the White House and
changing the course of the nation forever; for the
first time in eight years, the queer community has
something to look forward to in the Executive
Branch, one that will be friendly to LGBT people.
Even so, we must demand more than friendly treatment by the incoming administration, which will
necessitate two things.
First, to improve our position in society, we
must examine the incoming administration's commitments to our community. We must not let the
new administration forget the breadth and depth of
the promises it has made to the queer community
while campaigning across the nation. That all of
those involved in the Obama campaign, including
queer individuals, were able to secure an Obama
victory is extraordinary.
Nevertheless, on the
same Election Day that so much progress was made
with one giant step forward, LGBT people were
forced to accept several major leaps backward. The
definition of marriage as exclusively straight was
perpetuated by the passage of Propositions 8, 102
and 2 in California, Arizona and Florida, respectively.

More importantly, a new and more terrifying
course has been set by the passage of Act 1 in
Arkansas, barring the fostering or adoption of children by unmarried couples. While the act makes it
impossible for any single parent in an unmarried
relationship to foster or adopt a child, the proposition was written to explicitly target people in samesex relationships.
The message approved by Arkansas is loud and
clear, that most Arkansans think LGBT people are
unfit to raise children and that single parents
should not raise children on their own or in any
unmarried setting. My heart goes out to all of the
children in the Arkansas social service system,
children who simply want a loving and caring person to raise them. This principled message has had
the intended consequence of decreasing the likelihoodof your finding a home, but I encourage you to
raise your voices and take a stand against this foolish and discriminatory law.
The electorate of Connecticut was the only electorate this election that refused to give in to the
homophobia in our society, choosing instead to
maintain the definition of marriage as more than
just between a man and a woman. The result in
Connecticut, along with the continued same-sex
marriage in Massachusetts, gives those of us in the
queer community hope for a day when marriage
can be accessible to all consenting adults. What is
made even clearer from this election is that we still
have so much left to do before we can achieve
equality in our society.
These propositions are representative of the
continued entrenchment of institutional oppres-

20

ferent backgrounds of privilege and come in all
shapes and sizes. No amount of denial will make
this otherwise. That is what is so unique about the
queer community. All of us have gender identities
and sexual orientations spanning a spectrum that
many members of our society choose not to recognize, so we can all relate to being outside of perceived norms.
Both the black community and the queer community have been historically marginalized; and
any attempt on the part of one of these groups to
marginalize the other would be foolish and shortsighted. Those within and outside our communities who want to divide us are motivated by the
oppressions that they themselves have internalized. No amount of scapegoating by members of the
queer community will ajter the passage of these
propositions, nor will it help us to achieve our
goals.
The media was blatantly irresponsible with its
misuse of statistics about Proposition 8, but we
must rise above their attempts to divide and obfuscate us. The losses resulted from deep-seated prejudice against the thought of two male-identified or
female-identifiedindividuals marrying one another
or caring for a child. They did not result, as the statistically irresponsible media has claimed, from the
propositions' achieving majority support in one
demographic, but rather from achieving majority
support in most demographics.
But let us not be deterred by these electoral failures. If we hope to make any progress in this
nation, we must face our differences head on and
celebrate them. Progress has continued to be made
simply by focusing on these issues, learning more
about the context in which they fit into our nation's
history and realizing the scope of their effects on
our broadly-spanning queer community. We must
unite with all of our backgrounds and address
issues of social justice; it will involve uniting to
fight poverty, homelessness, police brutality, the
criminal justice system, the prison system, sexism,
heterosexism, ableism, ageism,\ and homophobia
in all of its forms, along with ensuring better access
to education and healthcare for all of us. Because
of the interconnectedness of our community, these
issues affect all of us: gay, straight, or otherwise.
On Saturday, Nov. 15, many of us gathered in
Philadelphia to mobilize against segments of our
society that were effective in lobbying to deny us
our equal access to the American experience. We
were gathered in Philadelphia to call for equality,
and the fight for marriage is only the first step. If
we want to live in a society in which we can all be
free to claim and exercise our civil rights, we must
reach out to other communities, especially other
marginalized communities that have been downtrodden and overlooked. This is the only way that
we will be able to form effective coalitions that will
be able to make our society more livable for all
members of the community, and not merely those
who are already the most privileged.

Tajomaru,
played by Kurosawa
regular
Toshiro

Mifune), the samurai's wife (Masako,
played with versatil-

ity by Machiko Kyo), the dead samurai (Takehiro, portrayed by
Masayuki Mori) and a woodcutter (played by Takashi Shimura).
Amidst a prophetic deluge of rain, the woodcutter and a priest
recall the trial for a third party, creating a flashback within a
flashback as the narrative structure. At the trial, each witness
presents a contradictory but plausible tale of what happened.
Even the dead samurai, with the help of a medium, gives his
dubious account.
But Rashomon's innovation lies in its ability to question
theaudience's notion of truth. The trial is set up so that the interlocutor is never seen. Witnesses speak directly to the audience,
pleading for sympathy and validation. The scene of the crime is
visited and then revisited, and each time the players make different moves. Each image of the crime we see on screen is mediated by the perception of whichever character is presently bearing witness.
Setting is of utmost importance, as the crime scene is prominently featured. Cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa sets his camera deep into the forest leaves. In one beginning scene, the camera gives a worm's eye view of the sun through the forest canopy,
an image of some distant and elusive heaven. Miyagawa's camera floats through the forest with different camera angles presented in rapid succession, as if the apparatus itself were a disembodied spirit. Shimura's woodcutter recollects his first
encounter upon the crime scene.
He walks through the forest dutifully, axe in hand, unaware of

the horrors that wait. The camera views him from a treetop, a
ditch, behind a bush, up close, far away. Miyagawa's voyeuristic,
spontaneous camera is omnipotent; it almost mimics a predator
viewing its prey, or rather, a deity observing a peon. The woodcutter slowly comes across remnants of the crime. A hat and veil,
an amulet and finally, the body of the slain samurai, hands frozen
with rigor mortis in the shape of claws. We never see the dead
body's face, but only those hands, pointed toward the sky as if
begging for mercy.
As with most Kurosawa features, the acting is solid all
around. Still, Machiko Kyo stands out considerably as the samurai's ill-fated wife, Masako. After Tajomaru ties up Takehiro, he
grabs Masako and runs through the forest with her to show her
his achievement, the camera frantically tracking to keep up. As
soon as Tajomaru and Masako arrive at the scene and Masako
lays her eyes on her emasculated husband, her face goes blank
with knowing dread. She does not histrionically convulse with
forced anguish and fear. Hers is a shock and despair that brims
beneath the surface and betrays her frailty.
Then, in a flurry of exasperation and anger, she takes hold of
her dagger and attempts to kill Tajomaru in order to extricate
herself from her fate. Finally, collapsed in a pool of tears and
sweat, she is forced to yield to her attacker, with one last worm's
eye view of the sun as it reflects on her dagger, one last view of
heaven before plunging into that age-old purgatory of shame and
depravity.

Rashomon's full assault on the sanctity of memory and justice
is indeed unrelenting and unapologetic. The film never offers any
answers to the dilemmas presented. And much like the woodcutter and priest, we are left just as disgusted and confounded by the
certainties of the story as by the uncertainties. Right and wrong
are simply non-issues even where such heinous acts are concerned. Kurosawa's question looms much larger: where do such
contradictory ideas arise, and how can they possibly coexist?
In these divisive times, such questions are more important
than ever.

Obama's victory as if it had
been their own perhaps it was. One could argue that in
today's globalized world, the American electorate did a
service to world citizens by electing Obama.
As it stands, the call for change goes beyond US borders. It is change on a global scalethat we should aim for.
Having a young, black, intelligent, and progressive
leader in the White House is a sign that the world is moving in a positive direction. "Change has come to
America," he said in his victory speech. What he meant
was that the possibility for change has come to the world
and to America, if not the obligation.
What is it about this man that makes him the source
of hope and inspiration for young people around the
world? There are many ways to answer this question. I
would say, however, that Barack Obama embodies the
revolutionary spirit inherent in young generations.

The electoral euphoria that dominated the press
around the world is far from being over in Venezuela.
The stage is set for our regional elections. The Ministry
of Education has decided to suspend classes starting'on
Wednesday so that on Sunday, November 23, the nation's
schools can serve as voting centers for this important
electoral contest. Officially at stake are no less than 22
governorships and 328 mayoral positions. More importantly, these upcoming elections will determine the political panorama of a nation struggling with its revolution.
Chavez has spent the bulk of this past month campaigning for his party's candidates. He has traveled the
country to make public appearances with the candidates
for governors and mayors he openly supports. Along the
way, and in his singular style, Chavez has threatened to
incarcerate candidates of the opposition and to mobilize
troops and tanks if the Revolution loses its stronghold in
several states. Needless to say, a tense political climate
reigns in Venezuela.
Political analysts have compared Chavez's attitude
toward these elections with the way he acted last

December. Almost a year ago, he presented a series of
changes to the national constitution that was vetoed by
the Venezuelan electorate. At the time, his strategy was
to equate the constitutional changes with the Revolution.
Voting against them meant betraying the whole of the
revolutionary project. For the upcoming elections, he
seems to have embraced a similar strategy. Broadly
speaking, the merit of most of President Chavez's candidates lies solely in their alliance with him.
A similar trend holds true for the candidates of the
opposition. Their political platforms are almost entirely
based on the fact that they are the anti-Chavez alternative. Some of the candidates that are up for election are
the same corrupt politicians that ruled the country
before 1998. They stand strong only in opposition to
Chavez, if at all. Wide-spread political amnesia and dissatisfaction with the Revolution might be just what it
takes to put them back in power. Such is the tragic story
of radical politics in Latin America.
Whatever happens this Sunday will, without a doubt,
determine the immediate future of the Bolivarian
Revolution. The Chavez administration must recover

from a transnational corruption scandal concerning
Cristina Fernandez's presidential campaign in
Argentina, and an almost $9O decrease in the price of
Venezuelan oil in only six months.
The goal is not for the opposition to gain political
ground, per se. That is, the opposition is by no means an
ideal political alternative. What we need at this point is
political diversity and dialogue. We need "to reach across
the aisle," as some would say, to mend the ideological gap
that Chavez has both created and fed upon. The dream is
to walk together as a nation and to have projects in common as a people. We are far from that dream in
Venezuela. Only if the Revolution loses these elections in
several states can we even hope to begin our walk
towards this goal.

Opposition to gay marriage more than homophobia
some homophobic Americans who oppose
gay marriage because they do not like gay
people, that is not one of the principle
arguments offered in the public debate.
Gay marriage opponents fall into two
categories: traditionalists who adhere to
various scriptures (and dictionaries) that
define marriage normatively as the union
between a man and a woman; and those
who actively oppose gay marriage
because of the ill-effects they believe it
would have on the institution of marriage

WILL GLOVINSKY
The Commotion
Stirring
beneath
the tide of
Democratic gains on November 4 and

whispers that we are entering a new era
of progressivism was one conspicuous
undertow: the constitutional prohibitions
of gay marriage in California, Arizona
and Florida.
On a liberal campus with a very active
gay and lesbian community, opposition to
gay marriage can be a little difficult to
come to terms with. After all, if you
believe that all humans have equal rights,
then how can you oppose gay marriage?
But before we write off the electoral
majorities of California, Florida and
Arizona as bigoted, it is worth examining
the anatomy of the arguments against gay
marriage.

The first thing to understand is that
people oppose gay marriage for different
reasons. And while there certainly are
THE PHOENIX

and society as a whole.
For traditionalists, a mixture of social
inertia and literal religious reading
stands behind opposition to gay marriage.
Some Old and New Testament passages
are interpreted to be condemnations of
sodomy, and by extension, homosexuality.
Other passages define marriage as
between a man and a woman. By that religious reckoning, gay marriage would
encourage and legitimize behavior considered to be sinful, and contradict God's
word on marriage.
The other faction against gay marriage
grounds its opposition in the assumption
that the institution of marriage is under
attack, and therefore believes that traditional marriage should be preserved and
bolstered rather than widened and
reformed. These social opponents draw a
rather tenuous connection between the
advent of gay marriage and unfavorable
trends in divorce rates, out-of-wedlock
births and marriage rates. The theory
goes that if gays and lesbians begin marrying, social norms that result in productive, healthy families will crumble, and
all sorts of social woes will befall
America.
While the veracity of this theory is

it is hard to
quite easily challenged
imagine that heterosexuals will divorce
in droves, abstain from marriage or raise
depraved children because homosexuals
are tying the knot the view is not exactly homophobic. However misguided the
theory may be, it is grounded in social
concerns of sexual norms, not a desire to
refuse rights to a particular group of people.
Nonetheless, the theory is troubling.
To say that gays and lesbians are unfit to
raise children (a common sentiment that
manifested itself politically in Arkansas
this election) is simply wrong and insulting to the many happy American families
with gay parents. And yet it is possible to
construct a hypothetical supporter of this
theory who is earnestly worried about the
supposed social

effects of gay

marriage.

A mixture of social inertia
and literal religious
reading stands behind
opposition to gay
marriage.
The view brings to mind the term postracism, which has been used to describe
contemporary race relations. Post-racism
suggests that overt racism has been largely eradicated while institutional and subconscious racism continues to cause
racial strife. Similarly, while this hypothetical opponent of gay marriage may
like gay people, he or she still harbors

November 20, 2008

anti-gay sentiments like the assumption
that homosexual morality is somehow different or inappropriate.
As with the social opposition to gay
marriage, it is possible to construe religious opposition in terms that are not
homophobic at root. A Christian might,
for example, reject the interpretation that
God condemns homosexuality but accept
the interpretation that marriage is the

union of a man and woman.
Intolerant beliefs founded on religious
teachings present a particular challenge
to proponents of tolerance. Can you condemn someone for a belief that he or she
finds in scripture?
It depends, but the good news for gay
marriage supporters is that even beliefs
grounded in the Bible come and go with
the times. The story of Ham's son, whose
face was "burnt" and whom Noah condemned to slavery, was long cited as a
Biblical endorsement of American slavery and white supremacy, but you won't

hear many pastors talking about that
today.
People of faith deserve respect for the
values they derive from their religions,
but those values should not trample on
the rights ofothers.
The bottom line is that opposition to
gay marriage does not require homophobic beliefs, but certainly can feed off them
when they are present. There is an inher-

ent tension between this conclusion and
the unequivocal terms used to defend the
equal right to marriage, but it is essential
to realize that the equality argument,
while convincing, cannot dictate the
parameters of the debate.

Baseball analysts' old-fashioned ways bring bad press

JOSH ABEL
Called Third
This past week was awards week for

Major League Baseball, when the Baseball
Writers' Association of America votes on
who the best managers, pitchers, rookies
and all-around players were for the past
season. The fun thing about these awards
is that they provide a lot of room for
debate. Ultimately, it comes down to how
you define value and how you choose to
evaluate performance, so a lot of these
awards are open to interpretation. It's
almost impossible to fill out an objectively
wrong ballot.

Almost.
This year, the Cubs' Geovany Soto won
the NL Rookie Of the Year. This was a fair-

ly obvious choice. More notably, the Reds'
Edinson Volquez finished fourth in the
BBWAA's votes for the award, garnering
three second-place votes.
Volquez had a tremendous season,
delivering dominant, consistent performances on the mound he made it to June
9 before giving up more than two earned
runs in a start. His sterling season, accompanied by the expected emergence of fellow youngster Jonny Cueto, should make
the Reds confident that they will soon have
a dominant one-two punch at the top of
their rotation. However...
Edinson Volquez was not a rookie in
2008. The rules say that a pitcher cannot be
a rookie if he has thrown more than 50
innings in his career prior to the current
season, and Volquez pitched 80 from 2005-7.
80 is more than 50. Volquez was not eligible.
Three out of 32 voters said that the second-best rookie in the National League
was a player who was not even a rookie.
This is an embarrassment. If 10% of the
votes are so poorly thought out that they
could be cast for ineligible players, what
do the awards even mean? Why bother voting if the voters have no credibility?
As I thought of the three now-shamed
sportswriters filling out their ballots, not
bothering to do the research to see
whether Edinson Volquez was in fact a
rookie, I thought of another man who
became somewhat famous in another
recent election. Political junkies out there
may have come across Nate Silver during
campaign season.
The creator of

FiveThirtyEight.com, Silver used incredibly detailed, statistically-based simulations to project the winner of the presidential election. His final projection, made
soon after precincts started reporting, was
shockingly accurate. He missed only
Indiana, predicted the popular vote within
tenths of a percentage point and was on the
money on almost all of the Senate seats as
well. (Also, he said Missouri was too close
to call, and it still hasn't been called).
Before Silver turned his attention to
politics this summer, he was a baseball
writer, but not in the sense that those
three mistaken voters are baseball writers.
Silver wrote for Baseball Prospectus,

which writes about baseball from an
almost strictly statistical point of view.
While there, Silver developed a system
similar in ways to the one he would soon
use to be the first pundit to definitively
to projdeclare Barack Obama's victory
ect the future performances of baseball
players.
When no one else saw the 2008 Rays
coming, Nate Silver did. When he predicted the White Sox to win 70 games in 2007,
he was widely mocked, as his projection
seemed to badly underestimate a team that
many predicted to contend. The 2007 Sox
won 72 games. And there are myriad individual performances that Silver forecast,
such as the emergence of multiple-Cy
Young Award winner Johan Santana in
2004 and the breakout of 2008 NL ROY
Geovany Soto. But Nate Silver was not in
the BBWAA. He could onlyrarely get press
credentials to get near the game, he was

never allowed to vote on the year-end
awards and, most frustratingly, he and his
craft were regularly mocked in the mainstream. Statistical analysis is derided
because "people play baseball, not computers," and so Nate Silver was held on the
margin of the sports media.
While you could open up any newspaper in March and find playoff predictions
based on groundless conjecture and flimsy
reasoning, you needed a subscription to an
obscure online source to see what Nate
Silver was predicting. (And, as any good
member of the BBWAA would remind you,
only a nerd who lives in his mom's basement needs a computer to help him understand baseball.)
Those three errant votes for Edinson
Volquez, contrasted with the Nostradamus
act Silver pulled during the 2008 campaign,
highlight the incompetence of the BBWAA.
If you give votes to people who won't even
do the research to determine eligible candidates, and you refuse votes to Nate
Silver and people who analyze the game
through statistics, why should anyone give
a damn what you think?
Much of the BBWAA has long stood
adamantly against statistics, marginalizing that type of analysis because anyone
with a computer can do it
it doesn't
require a press pass, so it erodes their
expertise. But these past couple weeks
have proven without a doubt that the
BBWAA needs serious change
in viewpoint and in membership.

game and faced Swarthmore on Sunday. In that match,
the Garnet hung on to a 1-0 lead to advance to Sectionals,
which will also take place on Clothier Field. This is the
first time the team has advanced past the second round of
the national tournament since 1974, and it means that the
Garnet is one of 16 teams left in the nation.
Pouring rain marked the start of the first-round game,
but the deluge did nothing to douse the fired-up spirit of
the Garnet. In the first half, Swarthmore outshot the
Scarlet Raptors 13-0, but at halftime the score remained
tied at nil-nil. It was only a matter of time before the
Garnet capitalized, however, and not long into the second
half a well-placed free kick by Captain Rory Stackpole 'O9
found its way into the box. Forward Ladule Lako Lo
Sarah 'O9 got a head on the ball, but the Rutgers-Camden
keeper managed to block that attempt. Teammate David
Sterngold 'l2 found the rebound, however, and fired a
shot into the back of the net, putting the Garnet up 1-0 in
the 54th minute.
Now in control of the game, Swarthmore midfielders
either made runs along the sidelines to feed the ball into
the center, or the defensive backs, pushed up to midfield,
fed balls over the top to attackers. Forward Morgan
Langley 11 corralled one of these passes in the 67th
minute, found his way by the Scarlet Raptors defense and
unleashed a low shot to the left side of the net. The
Rutgers-Camden keeper dove, but the ball made it under
his outstretched arms and put the Garnet up 2-0.
While containing the Scarlet Raptors' attack, the
Garnetalso enjoyed many more scoring opportunities. A
third goal was called back due to offsides later in the half.
Midfielder Fabian Castro 'l2 set up the play by streaking
down the right sideline, the neon green swooshes on his

22

cleats blurring together. He sent the ball to the opposite
side of the field, where a shot was taken and then tipped
in by Morgan Langley right in front of the goal, but he
turned out to be offsides.
Castro said his first season at Swarthmore "has been a
learning experience
it's a different style of play than
club [soccer]." Despite the differences in play, he has
adjusted well, getting into the thick of scoring opportunities in both games. When starting midfielder Micah Rose
'l2 had to leave Sunday's second-round match against
Dickinson due to injury, Castro was one of the substitutions into the midfield. Shortly after entering the game,
Castro was called upon to take a free kick on the left side
of the field, deep in Red Devil territory. He sent the ball
into the box where Captain Dylan Langley 'lO headed the
ball into the left side of the net. That goal, netted in the
30th minute, would prove to be the difference in the game.
Swarthmore Head Coach Eric Wagner used the example of Rose's injury to illustrate the depth of his team.
"Depth is probably our biggest strength. For instance,
Micah Rose got injured about 20 minutes in, but bring a
kid like [Roberto] Contreras off the bench and he fits magnificently. And Stu Leon steps up and plays 90 minutes."
The depth is especially crucial in tournaments set up like
this one, where teams must play two games in one weekend to advance. The Garnet effectively utilized this
strength in the second half of the game against
Dickinson. Whenever the Red Devils began to gain
momentum and generate some opportunities, the Garnet

substituted in fresh players to win the ball back and pro-

tect the lead.
Wagner also observed another strength that the
Garnet had to implement to fend off the Red Devils. The
match was marked by multiple hard fouls and Wagner
noted, "Dickinson could only beat us by disrupting us.
One of our strengths is to stay focused in spite of that."
had to resort to this style because they did
not have the skill or the quickness to match Swarthmore,
something Lako Lo Sarah says is new this season. "We
can out-muscle any team out there, but this year is different because now we can outplay any team out there."
Dickinson came close to tying the score with four minutes left in the match. The Red Devils had a free kick in
Garnet territory and loaded the box with multiple attack-

ers. Swarthmore keeper David D'Annunzio 'l2 was
forced to come out of the net and punch the ball away.
The ball rebounded to a Dickinson player who took a
shot, but D'Annunzio was able to get his body in the way
and deflect the ball to yet another Dickinson attacker who
harmlessly shanked it high over the net. This sequence
revved up the crowd and the Strath Haven High School
contingent fell into one of its more popular chants, "We
got D'Annunzio!"
The save also served to secure D'Annunzio's ninth
blank sheet of the season, tying the Garnet's record for
most shutouts in a single season. Lako Lo Sarah praised
the play of his keeper, saying, "he's always solid on crosses and coming out and he's fearless."
Lako Lo Sarah also praised the crowd. "It makes all
the difference in the world," he said. Wagner expressed
similar appreciation. "The crowds have just been phenomenal. Our players just feed off it," he said. Even
though it was a Sunday evening, Swatties came out to
support the magical run of the soccer team. The crowd
included cheerleaders with pompoms in silver and black
dance costumes, shirtless fans with painted chests, the
Phoenix mascot, a cowbell and students from Strath
Haven High School.
Any Swat fans that missed this past weekend's games
will have another chance, because Swarthmore will host
three sectional matches this coming weekend. The first
match on Saturday is between the #1 team in the country,
Trinity University (Texas) (19-0-1), and Ohio Wesleyan (184-1), ranked ninth. After that game, the Garnet will face
Amherst College (13-3-3) at approximately 7:30 PM. The
winners will play in the sectional final at 6:00 PM on
Sunday. The winner of that match will be in the Final
Four and travel to Greensboro, North Carolina for the
34th annual NCAA Division 111 Championship.
Even though the Garnet has been dominating of late

the team's unbeaten streak is at 13 matches
do not
expect the team to be complacent. Lako Lo Sarah pointed
out that "the team has eight seniors and every game
could be our last one." Asked whether he has been doing
anything to motivate his team, Wagner responded, "At
this point you don't really have to. It's a once in a lifetime experience." The experience? Four wins away from
a National Championship.

He's pushing 50

today and is making a strong MVP bid. Your team's defense

Uncle Greg has a penchant for throwing cheap shots and
has already sidelined your brother's fiancee with a knee

snagging several game-changing passes (though Aunt

needs a big play, so you forgo the game-legislated "7Mississippi" count in favor of your one blitz per set of

and takes the snap. The scream of "BLITZ!" rushes from

get a wobbling off-balance throw over your head.
Fortunately, alleviating your suspicion, Aunt Judy has

Does this scene sound familiar? Maybe, maybe not. As
Thanksgiving rolls around the corner, the opportunity for
family-oriented sporting activities is at the year's peak.
Playing sports with your family is a great way not only to get
some exercise and work up a strong appetite for a gargantuan meal, but also to spend time with your family. Since many
of us here at Swarthmore do not go home or see our families
very often, the Thanksgiving weekend gives us a nice chance
to spend time with those we love.
Sports are an integral part of the Thanksgiving experience. If your family is not large enough to field two-teamed
sports, there are many other ways to enjoy both the company of your family and sports. For example, a game of wiffleball requires only two or three players, and physical activity
is limited to pitching, hitting, and possibly fielding the ball.
Also, if competition isn't your style, just grab a family member and a ball and head outside and throw (or kick) around.
I can guarantee you that there are plenty of things to talk
about on Thanksgiving. Too cold or too lazy to watch the
local high school football games? Watch sports on TV
instead. College and professional football usually have several games playing on Thanksgiving, so have everyone get
together and munch on snacks around a game. Sports and
Thanksgiving go together so perfectly that any sports fan out
there is sure to see the connection. Perhaps the best part is
that sports on Thanksgiving allow you to do what is most
important: spend time with your family. If for no other reason, get involved in family sports on Thanksgiving just to be
active. Fortunately, sporting events (both in person and on
TV) afford everyone the opportunity to gather around and
just be a family. Chances are that, if you are reading this column, you are interested in sports anyway, so why not go
online and check out if any of your favorite teams have
games on Thanksgiving? As a last resort, you could always
sit everyone around a TV in their post-meal paralysis and
pop in a family-friendly sports movie like "Rudy" or
"Miracle" (I wouldn't recommend "Any Given Sunday" or
"The Last Boy Scout"). So next week, when you are preparing to gorge yourself on meat and potatoes, don't forget to
give thanks to the things that make the day special: family
and sports.

would go on to lose 130-65 and the men
(1-2, CC 1-1) by a close 108-97, the meet
as a whole foretold a promising season for both teams.
"They won by fractions of a second," Guy Seaton 'O9 said. Seaton

The men's 100-yard freestyle was such

of Swarthmore's captain Douglas
Gilchrist-Scott 'O9, winning by just 14
hundredths of a second.
It is tiresome to think about all the
hypothetical situations that could
have led the men to victory. Danny
Friel 'lO comments that in the face of
close losses, "We look back at the
meet, and the races we did win." For
the men, Stephen Shymon 'O9 dominated the rest of the field by taking
the 500-yard and 1000-yard freestyle
races for Swarthmore. Furthermore,
the Garnet were able to take first, second and third at the 50-yard freestyle
and ended the meet by taking first
and second in the 400-yard freestyle
relay.

Fortunately, the Garnet can look
forward to more rounds against the

Championships. In the mean time, the
teams have been practicing hard.
A typical practice involves warming up as a team and splitting into
training groups for sprinters, middledistance swimmers, and distance
swimmers. The team practices every
day and takes a rest (a shorter practice) only before big meets. Friel comments on the rigor of practice, "It's
hard to race when you're so tired,"
adding that the main goal is the conference meet, and no rest now means
better results when the stakes are
higher.

Chelsea Brett 11 also comments
that practice isn't day-to-day tedium,
that "Having really good friends-[at
practice] makes practices a lot more
enjoyable." Brett also acknowledges
how the team has increased their dryland training and the results look
promising in the long run.
It may stillbe difficult for the average person to imagine how or why a
Swarthmore student would dedicate,
by Seaton's measurement, three
hours a day to swimming and swimming-related activities. For these athletes, swimming is a hefty time (and
energy) commitment while improvement is often slow-paced and 'tioesn't

get any easier," Friel said.
Brett said, "Getting better, improving my times, and competition" are

continued
all motivations for
involvement with swimming. Seaton
echoes that swimming is "the same as
a concert pianist
any other activity
learning another piece or a novelist
writing another chapter." Meets only
capture a small part of the exciting
aspects of swimming
the sustained
individual improvement and dedication.
Friel added, "College swimming is
very team-oriented
you feel like
you're part of a group effort," and that
helping others achieve a common
goal is partially what makes swimming so satisfying. Swimmers that
you talk to will often highlight the
importance of being on a team.
Despite the fact that only one swimmer is in a lane at a time, the team
proves to be cohesive and full of camaraderie. Friel mentions that the team
will often even study together (as was
the case when he was interviewed).
Next weekend, the team will travel
to New York City on a trip that will be
light on sight-seeing and heavy on
competition. The prospect of facing a

Cross country ends season on a high note
BY JASON HONGIN YUN

hyunl@swarthmore.edu

Last Saturday, marking the end of cross country season, the Swarthmore cross country teams competed in
the NCAA Division 111 Mid-East Regional Meet hosted by
Waynesburg University. The women's team finished 7th
out of forty-four teams, while the men's team closed their
season placing 19th out of forty-three teams.
The meet took place on a racecourse near a small airport in Waynesburg, Pa., where a plane actually took off
from the runway a few feet away from the race course.
Watching the plane taking off, team captain for the men's
team Daniel Hudson 'O9 said, "As the plane prepared for
its takeoff run, I was filled with excitement; the ability to
fly surely represents a great accomplishment of the.
human race, and I understood this most trite takeoff as
part of something bigger, more spectacular. Similarly, a
race is not just another run."
The Garnet men were led by team captain Erik Saka
'O9, competing in his fourth meet (earning All-Region
honors in 2006). Saka finished the 8k course with a time
of 26:53, placing forty-eighth. Cd-captain Dan Hodson 'O9
finished next for the Garnet in 27:34. Patrick Harnett 'll,
Jonnie Tompkins 'lO, Connor Darby 'O9, Alex Frye 'll,
and David Riccadi 'lO also contributed strong finishes for

the men.
"Even after six months of training, there is no guarantee that the favorite will prove to be the best on race
day. Success comes not from simply running the course,
but rather it is an emergent property of the integration of
body, mind, and spirit at their peak," Hodson said.
"Watching someone race is not like watching someone
run, just as watching a plane take off is not the same as
watching a propeller spin."
On the women's side, now three-time All-Region selection Nyika Corbett 'lO finished the race in 23:37, placing
thirty-third overall earning All-Region honors for the
third straight year. Melissa Frick 'l2 and two-time AllRegion selection Emma Stanley 'O9 closely followed

10 and Rebecca Woo 'll rounded up scoring for the
women. On the whole, Swarthmore Men's team finished
19thand the women's team finished in 7th place. Despite
some great individual performances, the team was disappointed with their results from the championship races.
Hudson, whose collegiate cross country career had
came to an end after the meet, said that what constitutes
a successful team is not stellarresults but the experience
one gets from the sports itself and teammates. "Riding 6
hours on the bus to Waynesbufgh on Friday and 6 hours
back on Saturday, I looked up and down the bus, and I
saw some of my best friends."
"Our final flight at Waynesburg was not just the end
of my season, but the end of my cross country running at
Swarthmore, and indeed the end of my cross country
career on the whole. As far as success goes, the experiences I have had and the friends I have made will have
been a positive influence over my last four years and
hopefully over the years to come. For me, the season and
the experience has been a success. Racing is more than
running, and cross country is more than running," he
added
Team captain Kathy Feeney 'O9 also expressed deep
affection for the team and the sport. "It still hasn't actually hit me that Saturday was my last collegiate Cross
Country race. I have been racing on school teams since I
was in 7th grade, and while running is a lifelong sport,
the Cross Country season has been an irreplaceable part
of every year since that time," she said.
"I want to say how proud I am to have been part of
such a fantastic team. In terms ofboth personal performance and overall team cohesiveness, this has been the
best season I've had during my four years we have put
in countless miles and hours pushing each other to be as
strong and tough as we can be. More importantly, we've
put in even more hours supporting each other as family
would do. I am honored to have been a captain for a team
of women as dedicatedand caring as the ones on my team
here at Swat," Feeney said.
We're an odd bunch but we wouldn't want it any other
way," she added.

Women's soccer captures second consecutive ECAC title

Megan Colombo celebrates as her championship winning penalty kick rolls into the net.
BY DANNY FRIEL

dfriell@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet women's soccer team ended the season on
a high note last Sunday by winning the ECAC South
Region Championship for the second year in a row.
Swarthmore finishes the season with a record of 10-4-6.
As the sixth seed in the eight-team tournament, the
women didn't have an easy path to victory and were
required to travel long distances to play their opponents.
Despite these obstacles, the Swarthmore team showed
resilience and determination to emerge from the tournament undefeated and defended their crown from 2007.
Forward Kelsey Cline 'll called the tournament victory "a great way to finish off the season. It was nice to be
able to give that to our seniors."
The Garnet opened the tournament last Wednesday
against third seed Delaware Valley College. Goalkeeper
Lauren Walker 'O9 tallied nine saves in 90 minutes of regulation play and two ten-minute overtime periods, as the
score stood at 0-0. Even after the customary five-round
penalty kick shootout, the teams remained tied at three
apiece. Swarthmore emerged victorious, however, in a
round of sudden-death penalty kicks to finish ahead,
with a score of 4-3, and advanced to the semifinals to play
second-seeded Westminster College.
For game two, last Saturday, the Garnet traveled to
Frostburg, Maryland to take on the Titans. The women
used a 1-0 lead at halftime to springboard to a 3-0 win
against Westminster, who ended their season at 15-5-2.
Swarthmore advanced to the finals of the tournament
with the win, and would face host and top-seed Frostburg
State University in the finals last Sunday.
