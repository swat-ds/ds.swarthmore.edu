A former Swarthmore professor and only contestant of Jeopardy to beat supercomputer "Watson," Congressman Rush Holt spoke on
campus Monday night about the importance of education for the future of our nation.
BY PATRICK AMMERMAN

pammerml@swarthmore.edu

On

Monday, Democrat House
Representative and former Swarthmore
professor Rush Holt returned to speak
at the college. Prior to attaining office in
1999, Representative Holt was a professor of physics at Swarthmore for eight
years. Recently, he has received considerable attention after defeating IBM's
artificial intelligence supercomputer
"Watson" in a round on the quiz show
Jeopardy.
Rep. Holt was brought to campus by
a collaboration between Jim Moskowitz
'BB of the Swarthmore Alumni Council
and the Swarthmore Democrats.
According to Moskowitz, he was able to
connect with Congressman Holt's staff
because he knew that Holt had come to
Swarthmore twice before as a
Congressman
and
in 2001 and 2005
had heard that Holt enjoyed the experi-

ence.
Events like this have given Holt a
chance to reconnect with old colleagues,
so both Holt and the Swarthmore community have benefited from his returns.
According to one of Holt's staff members who spoke to Markowitz, "Rush
had been working all day, but he was
really looking forward to have a couple
ofhours to do things that had nothing to
do with Congress."
Rep. Holt began his talk by humorously acknowledging his newfound
fame as the congressman who beat the
Watson computer.
"I've worked for years on civil liber-

ties and environmental protection, science education and restraint of the military, and a number of other things. And
what will I be recognized for but 20 minutes playing a game against a computer," Holt said.
Still, he said he thought that IBM's
creation was sending the right message
to Americans. "[lt's a] really clever
approach to highlighting the importance of research
I think we can use
this
to talk about how we can, as a
nation, in the President's words, outinnovate, out-educate, out-build the rest
of the world," he said.
One of the overarching themes of
Holt's talk was the importance of education, especially education in the sciences, for the future of our country. "We
really do need science for all students.
Every year. All sciences," he explained.
He advocated not separating the sciences from other areas of education, in
order to avoid distinguishing between
the "scientists" and the "not-scientists"
in society, arguing that all citizens needed to know something about all sciences
to make intelligent political decisions
on issues such as reliance on nuclear
energy.
Holt also commented on the absence
of more scientists like himself among
America's lawmakers.
"We need more people thinking like
scientists," Holt asserted.
"[He] definitely illustrated the lack of
scientists in Congress and how that is
hindering progress," Peter Gross 'l3,
President
of
the
Swarthmore
Democrats, said.

March 31, 2011

...

...

Rep. Holt went on to discuss his
stance on some of today's important

issues such as the federal reduction of
Pell Grant spending and America's
intervention in Libya.
He then opened the room to questions from the audience, comprised of
Swarthmore students, alumni and community members, who bombarded him
with questions on topics such as the
War Powers Act, healthcare and partisanship in government.
Holt also attended an informal reception afterwards for students only. "It
was all very friendly, very warm,"
Gross said.
"He was very responsive to students'
individual questions," Paul Shortell 'l3,
the secretary for the Swarthmore
Democrats, said. "One of the things I
thought was interesting
was the
amount of respect he had for Congress
and his peers."
Holt was moved on several occasions
during his talk to defend some of his fellow representatives, whom he described
as "intelligent, dedicated and generally
altruistic."
Rep. Holt may face a challenge in
upcoming Congressional elections, as
the number of representatives in New
Jersey will be reduced by one due to the
results of the last Census. A committee
of six republicans and six democrats
will be in charge of deciding how to best

NCAA to revise graduation requirements
BY RYAN SHAUGNESSY
pittnews.com, Mar. 27, 2011

the semester-to-semester eligibility and
retention of athletes, rather than just

Less than half of the players in the
NCAA Tournament are required to
graduate, a percentage that education
officials want to change.
U.S. Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan hosted a teleconference earlier
this month to announce reforms to
NCAA eligibility standards for playoff
basketball teams. The conference was in
response to a report that showed large
disparities between the success rates of
black and white basketball players in
the 2011 NCAA Tournament.
Beginning next year, teams will need
to have at least a 50 percent graduation
rate to qualify for the tournament,
which is a 10 percent increase from last
year's 40 percent.
The NCAA will switch to the preferred metrics of the Academic Progress
Rate for tracking graduation metrics
instead of the Graduation Success Rate
metric.
The APR uses real-time data from
four-year periods to keep track of graduating players. This would ban teams
with an APR score below 925
the
equivalent to a 50 percent graduation
rate
from playing in the postseason
.The NCAA calculates the APR based on

Another revision would restructure
the tournament revenue distribution
formula, which currently rewards winning games, but does not reward academic benchmarks.
"Over the past five years, $179 million
almost half of the money awarded for appearances in the tournament
went to teams who were not on track to
graduate at least half their players,"
Duncan said. "There are tens of millions going to programs where their
players are not on track to graduate at
least half their members that doesn't
make sense to me."
The annual report analyzed academic information for the 67 men's basketball teams competing in the NCAA
Tournament. It was issued by the
Institute for Diversity and Ethics in
Sports at the University of Central
Florida.
Pitt would meet the new requirements by a margin of 15 percent or less.
The Pitt men's basketball team
scored a total of 962 out of 1000 for its
academic progress rate, graduating 60
percent ofblack student-athletes and 50
percent of white student-athletes in the
past year. Pitt tied for No. 32 in progress

graduation rates.

...

rates score for tournament teams.
Overall, Pitt graduates 64 percent ofbasketball student athletes.
"Graduating our student athletes has
always been, and remains, the top priority for the University of Pittsburgh's
Athletic Department regardless of sport,
gender or any other classification," E.J.
Borghetti, a Pitt Athletic Department
spokesman, said in a statement.
The 2011 report said that the
Panthers tied for 29th place out of 67
teams for overall in a different measure,
the graduation success rate, which
measures the six-year graduation rate,
with 81 percent graduating over six
years.
which refers to
In the 2010 report
the Graduation Success Rate for the
freshman classes of 2000-01 to 2003-04
the Pitt's men's basketball team graduated an average of 67 percent of black
players and 100 percent of whites over
that six-year period.
The 2009 report has Pitt graduating
70 percent of black and 100 percent of
white basketball players, which is higher than this year's rates of 60 percent of
black and 50 percent of white basketball

players.
Pitt men's basketball team's numbers differ from the overall NCAA average, which shows different rates of sue-

cess between white and black players.
Richard Lapchick, director of the
Institute for Diversity and Ethics in
Sport, said during the teleconference
that 91 percent of white student-athletes
from these tournament teams graduate,
whereas only 59 percent of black student-athletes graduate within six years.
And though these reforms were
mostly directed toward universities,
Ben Jealous, president and CEO of the
NAACP, offered a different view in the
teleconference, blaming the coaches for
players' failures.
"The only thing failing schools have
in common is lack of leadership from
coaches

would I be if I
didn't provide you with a guide to pulling the
perfect all-nighter?
Most Swatties
have
suffered
through the occasional all-nighter during their tenure here. I may have
unique authority in this matter, as I
have pulled an average of one allnighter per week for the past three
years. Some do it out of painful necessity, but I have come to view allnighters as spiritual retreats during
which I can engage in extreme and
uninterrupted academic intensity. So
without further ado, allow me to walk
you through the planning, implementation, and recovery stages that constitute the delicate art of the all-nighter.
First and foremost, you must think
strategically about when to stay up all
night. If you can get your work done
during the day, or during the week
before, then by all means do so. There
is really no reason to put your body
through an all-nighter unless you
absolutely have to. I have found that
all-nighters are most useful before
major tests, especially when you
haven't had time to study beforehand.
Four extra hours of studying could easily make the difference between a C
and an A.
Correspondingly, four fewer hours
of sleep one night might have little to
no effect upon your overall performance, especially if you were already
well-rested the day before. When it
comes to writing papers, I find that
effective all-nighters can enable you to
enter a Zen-like state of concentration
where you can maintain unparalleled
continuity of thought, free from outside interruption.
After you determine that an allnighter is imminent, you should immediately begin your battle plan. Before
you even think of touching your work,
you must stock up and set up. Gather
some fruit (apples, bananas, berries)
along with dense, high-protein snacks
like peanut butter. Oatmeal and energy-rich nuts are also worthwhile companions. You will likely crave sodium
at some point as well, so be prepared to
indulge in ramen noodles if necessary.
If your work consists of dense readings, I highly recommend investing in
what I call "movement foods" like
puffed rice or unsalted popcorn. These
snacks are very light and eating them
will keep you in constant motion without distracting you from the readings.
It is highly likely that you will require
some amount of caffeine as well during

eyes and make you think you're more
tired than you really are. If you are typing on your computer, use keyboard
shortcuts to save your work after every

Utilize breaks wisely. If you find
yourself losing focus or feeling
fatigued, you should first try a quick
massage of your ears/head/neck and
face contortions to loosen yourself up,
or vigorously chew some strong mint
gum. If that fails to restore you, get up
and take a brisk 5-minute walk or
throw a mini dance-party to your

You should only take a nap in the

I'll conclude with an important disclaimer. All-nighters are never the
optimal answer. My goal through this
article is not to encourage you to pull

that in the worst-case scenario, you
come out on top. Make sure you avoid
all-nighters prior to any planned physically engaging activities, especially
driving.
According to research by Dr.

While sleep deprivation is certainly
cheaper than alcohol, I nevertheless
encourage you to be aware of your

Multimedia production explores unanswerable questions
&

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY HENRY KIETZMAN
hkietzml@swarthmore.edu
Esteemed Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote

his final play, "Farfetched Fables," in 1950, when he was 93
years old. The work is composed of six fables, all consisting of Shaw's controversial and somewhat scattered
thoughts on the future, covering overpopulation, atomic
warfare, terrorism, eugenics and genetic engineering,
among other topics. This past weekend, Swarthmore's

Production Ensemble drew from Shaw's work as a foundation to build a dystopian multimedia performance that
connected these post-World War II ideas to the concerns .of
today.

Students involved with the play were enrolled in
Production Ensemble I, a course offered by the theater
department that is a general requirement for all theater
majors and minors. To prepare for the performance, the
class participated in a number ofexercises to improve the
group's cohesiveness, as well as to familiarize the students
with the 1950s mindset. "We would make up various 'sosstyle advertisements [to get into the times]," actor Elliot
Weiser 'l3 said.
These improvisation workshops and icebreaker games
occured throughout the beginning of the semester; the
serious rehearsals began after spring break. The cast also
included Lori Barkin 'l2, Jessica Cannizzaro 'l2, Ryane
Disken-Cahill 'l2, Michael Edminston 'l2, Michelle Fennell
'l2, Katie Goldman 'l4, Jamila Hageman 'l3, Jeanette
Leopold (Haverford) 'l3, Sebastian Bravo Montenegro 'l3,
Erica Meryl Sands 'l3, Sam Swift Shuker-Haines 'l4, and

Marina Tucktuck 'l3.
The faculty director of the play, Lars Jan 'OO, cited 1960s
television shows such as "Twilight Zone" and "Lost in
Space," as well as film noir, as influences for his direction.
"You'd get a sense of a secret agency or government hidden

behind the curtain that would be pulling strings. That's
what the text felt like to me, like there was some sort of
coded language... I was always trying to figure out, 'what's
the moral of the fable?'" Jan said.
Drawing from these sources of inspiration, Jan chose to
frame Shaw's fables within the idea of a focus group
a
form of qualitative research in which a group of people are
asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs and atticontemplating the fables as censored 1950s TV
tudes
episodes. Cannizzaro and Weiser portrayed the focus
group leaders who interacted with the audience, acting as
focus group participants, throughout the show. "[The text]
needed some sort of frame because it was so deteriorated
and inconsistent with itself. It wasn't very thorough in its
examination of a lot of provocative ideas," Jan said. Jan's
idea for the focus group was incorporated in order to keep
the audience involved through questions about themes
presented in the piece.
As the play continued, the focus group leaders became
actual characters in the play, with one encompassing the
role of.the Teacher in the sixth Fable and the other transforming into Raphael, Shaw's vision of a disembodied
thought. Jan worked to emphasize the importance of this
transformation to Cannizzaro and Weiser. "I felt that the
focus groups were a good means to showcase the ideas
We as focus leaders start off in a pretty normal way, asking
the audience questions and getting answers. Gradually as
the play goes on and the work progresses, we start being
taken over by the ideas [of unanswerable questions and
disembodied thoughts]," Cannizzaro said.
The performance uniquely fused film and theater as the
show featured multiple layers. The focus group leaders
stood in front of LPAC cinema's large screen to introduce
each fable, the other actors performed the fable on the
stage behind the screen
still visible to the audience
and multiple cameras projected the acting onto the screen
to create a black and white teleplay effect. "[The media]
put the show in context, to make it feel like a censored teleplay from the 19505. It helps transport the audience into
that sort of setting," Weiser said.
Some of the questions that the play addresses, Jan
explained, include where thoughts come from and whether
or not they can exist without bodies. "The idea of dissociation of the mind from the body, I thought, demanded a formal treatment. The audience experiences the acting and
the body both in space, at a tremendous distance, and then
gains intimacy and really see these images that flicker on
the screen," Jan said. The performance toyed with audience's emotions, especially in transition to the second half
of the play, when Cannizzaro's heavy weeping follows a
darkly comic scene featuring clowns, played by Barkin
and Shuker-Haines, sarcastically and disturbingly preaching to four little children, played by Disken-Cahill,
Tucktuck, Hageman and Goldman.
This switch in emotions posed a challenge for
Cannizzaro. "It was hard to not listen to [the audience's

reaction to the clowns] and focus [instead] on using a lot of
my own memories to get to the emotional space that I've
been in at some time in my life. It was a lot of digging into
the past and trying to remember those intense emotional
feelings," she said. However, she explained that being in
such close proximity to the audience allowed her to feed
off their discomfort..
For Jan, the production was about asking questions
that cannot lead to a satisfactory answer. "You realize that
a teacher or your parent or nobody is going to be able to
answer certain questions for you, and that you may never
be able to answer certain questions for yourself," Jan said.
As an alum, Jan believes that Swarthmore was the perfect
place to explore such questions about the student and
teacher. "As you get to the point where students are at
Swarthmore, you are at a place where you aren't really
answering questions in the same definitive way You start
to realize that there is a multiplicity ofanswers," Jan said.
"I wanted the audience to contemplate the moment when
the ship really just sails on being able to get an answer
how scary it is and how much of a precipice it feels like. Is
that what maturity is?" Jan said.
For audience members, "Farfetched Fables" proved
provocative and visually arresting. Yuwen Wang 'l4
attended Friday's showing and found it to be "really artistically done." "Although sometimes a little unclear, the
focus groups were effective in provoking thought about
the prominent issues," she said. The show's multimedia

blew her away. "The visual effects allowed the audience to
deeply observe the actors' facial expressions. It allowed for
two components working with and against each other: film
and theater," Wang said.
Weiser believes that audience members were shocked
and entertained by the performance. "I hope [the audience] got a little bit of a thrill trip out of it. It's designed to
blow some minds," Weiser said.

Activist preacher addresses current "Earth-crisis"
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DINA ZINGARO
dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

Though he sports the trademark
Elvis-pompadour and the clerical collar
and suit of televangelist Billy Graham,
Reverend Billy is far from a right-wing
conservative religious leader. Instead,
Reverend Billy, created by performance
artist Bill Talen, is a parody of the latenight televangelist through which

Talen promotes anti-consumerist and
environmentalist messages.
On Saturday, April 2, Reverend Billy
and the Life After Shopping Gospel
Choir will visit campus to deliver "The
Church of Earthalujah," a show that
stresses cracking down on banks that
finance CO-2 emissions through mountaintop removal, hydro-fracking, super
malls and shipping sweatshop products
long distances with fossil fuel-burning
engines.

Based in New York City, The Church
ofLife After Shopping is an activist performance group led by Revered Billy
and draws from the form of revival
meetings to urge consumers to abandon
the products of large corporations.
Also, the group preaches a broader message about economic justice, environmental protection, and anti-militarism.
The content of this Saturday's show,
"The Church of Earthalujah!," addresses the environmental emergency troubling our planet.
According to Talen, our culture has
been trained to perceive nature and the
wilderness as outside of itself and thus,
our society often takes the position of
the entitled American or what he
describes as the "chosen people syndrome." Corporations strongly encourage this perception that the Earth is not
a living thing. "[Corporations] have the
free use of whatever they can extract
from the Earth as they privatize the air,
the water, everything. They try to make
everything part of the market," Talen
said.
Talen feels that humans have not
only forgotten that the Earth is a living
thing, but also that it is an intelligent
living thing that thinks and speaks.
Therefore, global disasters such as
fires, droughts, earthquakes and
typhoons are not natural disasters, but
instead, are cries of help from the
Earth.
Talen explained that the media presents such disasters in a tabloid style
with a hero, victim and villain, which
is then complemented by a dramatic
photo, a story of people arriving with
aid and a great deal of sentimentality.
However, Talen explains that such a
narrative demotes the wilderness since
the Earth remains "in the background
and is not a character." "All the media
brings us news of these natural disasters and they are described as standalone tragedies and they act like they
are accidents and that nature is vaguely responsible for it," he said.
Bill Talen invented his character
Reverend Billy in 1996 as an appropriation of a preacher, an Elvis impersonator and the televangelist Billy
Graham.He began in Times Square as a
lone performer, preaching about corporate power and its harmful effects on
strong local communities. After living
in Hell's Kitchen near Broadway and
then in Greenwich Village, Talen witnessed the ruin of these communities as
large corporations moved into neighborhoods and pushed out what he

THE PHOENIX

describes as "vulnerable, smaller, longtime shops." Talen identified the overwhelming force responsible as consumerism.
The keystone of Talen's theory on
consumerism is that communities actually grant big corporations power
through shopping. Thus, Talen decided
to preach as a means to dissuade people
from buying items from large-scale
companies such as Disney in Times
Square and Starbucks in the Village,
that were destroying communities.
Over time, Talen explained that he "got
an education" out on the streets as spectators would leave behind their contact
information on his pulpit to later speak
with him over the phone about widespread issues such as sweatshops and
union busting.
During his "sermons," the audience,
who often began clapping and scatting
(a vocal improvisation with random
syllables) in unison with his messages,
inspired Talen to incorporate a gospel
choir into his shtick. Now, The Church
ofLife After Shopping is a radical performance community with a 50-performer choir based in New York City.
The group's profile is anything but uniform, featuring members of all ages
who come from a diverse array of economic, ethnic, religious and cultural
backgrounds.
The project has expanded from the
original one-man performance and has
produced two professional CDs of origi-

nal songs, a series of documentaries
and also maintains a presence on the
Internet through the posts of anti-consumerist fans on their website
www.revbilly.com. Often partnering
with large NGOs and advocacy groups,
the Church negotiates and lobbies for
policy changes and focuses on three
interdependent initiatives: advocating
for sustainable consumption, establishing strong local economies, and defending the First Amendment and public
space.

Similar to his approach to these
political and social issues, Talen had to
learn about the art of preaching, which
he describes as "the craft of shouting"
and similar to "any traditional
American vocal form like the blues,
auctioneering or hip hop." Though he
admitted he is still "a student to preaching," Talen first learned by attending
churches and experiencing the powerful homilies of preachers.
He explained that since a large number of these preachers and televangelists are right-wing conservatives who
use "homophobia and warmongering in
their speech," Talen learned "to love
the instrument, but turn off the content." Thus, he adopted these preachers' style and gestures in order to
become a believable preacher, but
Talen held fast to his more progressive
content. "And so, the concept is rightwing threads and left-wing mouths as I
appropriated this iconic character,"
Talen said.
Talen believes that consumerism
plays a large role in further advancing
this Earth-crisis by persuading the
community that the Earth is willing to
negotiate with us, while he insists it
will certainly not as we continue to
deplete its resources. Talen's view of
consumerism is as a system
often a
dishonest one
that wants to survive,
a "parasite." Therefore, consumerism
will do whatever it deems necessary to
distract the public and to continue

a "reclaiming" where people "speak up
for themselves, take the communities
back and assert control over their own
local affairs and define these corporate
bearings that are
intruding
into
[the] communities
and into natural

However, Will Lawrence 'l3, the
organizer of Saturday's event, believes
that Reverend Billy does possess a particular spirituality. "There is something very spiritual in watching him
perform and seeing how deeply he and
the choir feel it," Lawrence said.
On Sept. 27 2010, Lawrence met Talen
when he accompanied former Lang
Visiting Professor of Issues for Social
Change George Lakey, along with
Anjali Cadambi 'l3, Alexa Ross 'l3,
Blaine O'Neill 'll
and Kanayo
Onyekwuluje 'l3, to the PNC Bank in
Washington, D.C. Swarthmore students, Reverend Billy and other activist
groups joined forces as part of
Appalachia Rising, a mass movement to
persuade Congress to stop issuing permits for companies to completely
remove mountaintops in search of coal.
"[Reverend Billy's] creative energy
challenges me to bring a theatrical
presence
and
determination to
moments of challenging power and
authority," Cadambi said.
Lawrence describes the Reverend's
approach to direct action as pushing
the boundaries of what is considered
private and public
"what is owned by
corporations and what is trusted to the
citizens." Through blurring this line,
Lawrence explained that Talen inspires

campus, Lawrence
feels that Reverend
Billy complements the student group's
agenda, which focuses on direct action
and environmental activism as a social
issue.
Though, as he describes it, this
"Earth-crisis" can be frightening, Talen
feels optimistic about the future with
people taking control of their communities such as through the rise of organic
farming. "People are starting to roll up
their sleeves and starting their own
shops
small
and
businesses.
Corporations are becoming increasingly isolated and desperate. So, while this
crisis is scary, it is also an exciting time
to be alive."
"Through performances and theatri
cal interventions, Reverend Billy tells
unapologetic truths about the daily
mechanics of consumer capitalism anc
climate injustice," Cadambi said. "To
all students interested in theater for
social change, his heartbeat-raising
'Earthalujah' show is not to be missed.'
The performance will be at 7 p.m. in
LPAC and is open to the public. The
event is presented by Swarthmore

the SBC Fun Fund, Forum for Free

ies, sociology and anthropology, music

of it. You've probably
lost track of what I'm
talking about, because
that is the way things are when Mercury is in retrograde.

Some of you of course have had no idea what I'm
talking about from the beginning and so, I will outline the basic facts. L Sometimes Mercury up in the
sky appears to us on Earth to be going backwards.
2. According to the field of astrology, this makes
communication on Earth more difficult and everything much more confusing than it is normally,
which is quite confusing. 3. It also makes perception, mental processing and most of what is within
the realm of education difficult. I think it has some
other detrimental effects, but unfortunately the
webpage I'm using to confirm my knowledge of
what happens when Mercury goes into retrograde is
being obscured by ads for California psychics.
At this point, I assume many of you are turning
to one another and saying "Ah yes, now we very
much understand what she is talking about."

Others of you are tossing your newspapers to the
side so that they land in your companions' orange
juice, and going off in search of something normal,
muttering vaguely about how you still don't know
what I'm talking about, you never will know what
I'm talking about and, in fact, you're certain that I

indeed be the case! But believe me, Mercury is
going into retrograde and it's going to be bad!"
I'm afraid that Mercury going into retrograde is
going to be especially disastrous for Swarthmore.
This is the sort of event which hits those who are in
the habit of existing in the world of the intellectual
with particular force. ("Ah," you say to yourself.
"Oh dear.") The other factor

Swarthmore students are already inclined to have
trouble with communication. We do try very
earnestly. In any given trip to Sharpies, for
instance, one will encounter at least eight people
who will ask The Appropriate Question. The
Appropriate Question, which you are all quite
familiar with, varies according to what part of the
semester we are in. We are.just coming off of the
"How was your spring break?" period and slowly
approaching the dawn of "Do you have many
exams?" This makes the fact that Mercury is about
to go into retrograde even worse. These in-between
times are unusually difficult and generally result in
mildly incoherent but nonetheless, well-intentioned sentiments such as "How are the exams
springing?" The answerer will make an equally
well-intentioned effort at communication. "Well,"
she might say, "Western Art, Astronomy,
Existentialism, and German. And you?" With
Mercury in retrograde our intentions will be noble

.

With Mercury in retrograde, disaster appears imminent
as ever, yet the results will be beyond redemption.
"Um ..." the questioner will inquire gesturing
vaguely at his acquaintance's nose "how was the,
bleugloofle?"
uh,
"Deutch!"
she'll reply.
"Astronomie, Ich bin ein banane untereinandersein
pirat." (Translation: German, Astronomy, I am a
banana being-among-one-another pirate)
Yes, it's true, when Mercury is in retrograde, two
thirds of the English-speaking population will at
some point wake up speaking German. I would like
to emphasize that everyone is at risk of this, even
those of us whose only knowledge of German comes
from a children's book about pirates and Heidegger.
In case you should encounter such a situation, it
would be wise to familiarize yourself with this
phrase: "Merkur ist rucklaufig!" Over the next
month it will be completely legitimate for you to
conclude any social interaction with the shouting of
these words in the company of no prior or further
explanation. That's the nice thing about Mercury
going into retrograde actually. It justifies such awkward tendencies as these, which many of us at
Swarthmore practice regardless of what the planets
happen to be doing. Never mind.
The important question now, is what the blooming hell do we do about all this?! We don't speak
German! We don't even remember how to say,
"Raise the sails, matey!" We did, but we forgot! Oh
no! There are two answers. First, we should panic.
And then, when the dust has landed and we've
found our shoes, we should give up. Mercury is in
retrograde, we're all a great mess and there's nothing we can do about it. Ah well, segelboot tomate

Student exhibit explores complexities of 3-D form
BY STEVEN HAZEL

shazell@swarthmore.edu

Photography and other visual art
forms are sometimes categorized as
forms that can be examined and understood from one angle, placed in a frame,
picked up and carried away. However, a
group of Swarthmore artists have blurred
the line between art as a two-dimensional
picture and a three-dimensional sculpture. A new exhibit at the Kitao Gallery,
titled "Introducing: The Tomorrow
People," will open today and will display
three-dimensionalartwork and videos by
Alex Hollender 'll, Nick Brown 'l3, Kate
McNamara 'l2 and Bruno Levy, who is an
established artist from New York.
As an art history major who originally studied business at NYU prior to
Swarthmore, Hollender discovered his
passion for art at an early age when he
attended a Waldorf school. The institution, which focuses on fostering creativity, allowed Hollender to enroll in a many
more art classes than a traditional elementary school. This translated to his
time at NYU, where he created a clothing
company called Create Build Destroy
with two friends. Once at Swarthmore,
Hollender began to explore different
forms of artistic expression. "I came to
Swarthmore and started studying art history and my first inclination was to paint,
but I didn't have time to learn so I started
making differentkinds of photo collages,"
Hollender said.
While Hollender was pursuing his art
history major and interning at the List
Gallery last year, List Gallery director
Andrea Packard encouraged Hollender to

create his own exhibition. "I started just

doing things," Hollender said. "That's
what I recommend [for other art students]
you just need to find some little
tool, some gateway that works buying
a camera or some paint, whatever works
for you."
Brown, a photographer and one of

Hollender's creative partners, became
interested in photography at a summer
camp where he had access to a darkroom.
The experience inspired him to take up
photography as a hobby. Once at
Swarthmore, Brown enrolled in a photography class with visiting professor of studio arts Jessica Harper, who strongly
influenced his development as an artist.
"I first learned the basic building blocks
of the photograph: lighting, shape, form,
framing, as well as the creative possibilities involved in the developing and printing process. And then [l] began to develop
my own style," Brown said.
The inspiration for "Introducing: The
Tomorrow People" emerged when
Hollender visited New York and met
Levy, an artist whose 3-D videos motivated Hollender to consider the contrast
between the two-dimensionality of photos
and the three-dimensionality of sculpture. An experienced photographer who
received his B.F.A. from the NYU Tisch
School of the Arts in 2001, Levy has photographed in locations from Nepal to
French Polynesia. He has also worked for
a variety of clients such as Sprite, Pepsi
and Wired, and his work has been displayed at exhibitions at the Guggenheim,
the MCA in Chicago and the Bronx
Musuem, among many others. Levy's
videos will be screened as a feature of the

exhibitionand the artist may speak at the
opening Thursday. Hollender's own work
is inspired by Levy's artistic considerations. "I was building on [Levy's] notion
of two- versus three-dimensional space,"
Hollender said. "The art object is inherently this two-dimensional thing that you
can hold and buy and sell. I wanted to
break out of that paradigm and make
something life size."
Along with Levy, other well-known
artists also influenced the exhibition. For
example, the Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso is famous for his
involvement in the Cubist movement. In
his work, Picasso experimented with the
visual limits imposed by working in twodimensional space through drawings and
paper collages. "[Picasso] complicated the
idea of a two-dimensional surface by
tricking your eyes and getting you to
question what exactly you are looking
at," Hollender said.
Another influence for the exhibition is
artist David Hockney, a contemporary
British painter, printmaker and photographer. An important figure in the pop
art movement of the 20th century, he has
often been compared to Andy Warhol.
"[Hockney] is brilliant in his use of photographs and approximating reality and
then messing with it. [All three
Swarthmore artists] love his art, so that
was a common ground for us to come
together on," Hollender said.
In creating the actual exhibition, the
student artists spent hours cutting out
cardboard shapes and printing hundreds
of pictures for use in the exhibition. The
objects created, all made of cardboard,
will be familiar images to students since

they represent objects commonly found

in a dorm room. Also, there will be an
'inspiration wall' that displays collages
and photographs the artists find appealing and interesting. Brown believes the
artists have generated a sense of camaraderie. "Alex, Kate and I have been
working closely on the exhibition every
step of the way; we have been mutual
inspirations to each other," he said.
The exhibition will be quite different
from more traditional collections found
on campus or in the Philadelphia
Museum of Art, for instance. By mixing
collage and three-dimensional cardboard
creations, the artists hope that their work
will broaden viewers' perception of what
constitutes art. "It is always exciting
when a new exhibition opens up at Kitao
or List [Gallery]," James Pao 'l3 said.
"Especially work that challenges my conceptions of art as oil paintings and twodimensional photographs that I usually
see in museums and presents something
different."
In order to create texture on the cardboard pieces, the artists pasted images of
the desired texture to the object. For
example, for a cardboard couch, the
artists pasted pictures of various materials commonly used for sofas. With this
technique, when each object is viewed
from a distance, it looks completely real.
However, when an observer approaches,
they discover that the image is actually a
collage of multiple, individual photos. "It
was almost a joke on photography, on the
fact that you can only get one angle from
a picture," Hollender said. "The photos
are like pixels or paint
we're painting
the objects with theirreal textures."

state in the aftermath of the devastating
earthquake. These two observations of
the Japanese people demonstrated what I
believe to be the consequence of Japanese
education: that is, the ability to follow
orders but the inability to create order.
In fact, when I asked my Hungarian
friends about the typical Hungarian college education, I discovered a style of education in Hungary similar to the
Japanese style. Both Hungarian and
Japanese education emphasize exams.
College admission is based solely on the
applicants' score on exams. Also, later in
college, the credits are given based mostly on exam scores. I will describe later in

Japan.

Another friend, attending a different
Hungarian university, explained to me

that there is a semi-official student organization that keeps and distributes class
notes and past exams for students who
choose not to attend lectures.
This kind of system both in Hungary

and Japan promotes a particular educational philosophy: to produce students
who excel in a specific discipline. I can
only infer from my program
since it is
a program designed for American college
students
the work is generally not
easy; the level of difficulty of some of the
classes I've taken is comparable to those
of Swarthmore's Honors Program.
What is drastically different from
Swarthmore College, however, is that
there is no "learning environment." The
colleges offer lectures, but not a holistic
learning experience. As a matter of fact,
the idea of residential college is
alien to both Tokyo and Budapest where
students live with their family or rent an
apartment. One of my Hungarian friends
told me that even when there are dorms,
academic departments have separate
dorms for their own majors.
In this light, I started to think that
what makes Swarthmore so extraordinary is the learning environment. There

March 31, 2011

is no way to test that a student learned
something outside of class because of the
"learning environment," but the college 1
tries to bring in as many factors as possible that might make "something" happen.
The college admits students with the
hopes that the class year is balanced and
diverse.
As students, we live in dorms where
we talk with people from different class
years and majors on a daily basis. A
greater emphasis is placed on homework,
keeping students on campus and promoting student interaction. And I believe it is
through these interactions that students
understand and integrate their knowledge into real life and become creative,
not just follow instructions.
For example, I unexpectedly started a
cold war with my (ex-) roommate last
semester, but through my conversation
with and observation on my ex-roommate's responses I learned something
invaluable about people.
This experience really helped me
understand and write a final paper on a
French post-structuralist. How could this
have happened if I only ever needed to
commute from home to school, taking
exams when I needed? I don't think that
the Hungarian and Japanese education
systems don't teach, but I do think there
is an important human and social element missing'^ithin their system.

thiscolumn what I think is lost due to this
emphasis on exams, but I must stress that
my intention is not to claim that these
exams cannot adequately assess a student's academic ability or that this style
is all about memorization.
Three years ago, as an ordinary high
school senior in Tokyo taking entrance
exam prep classes, I did a lot of past university entrance exam problems, and I
believe that some of fhem were very good
problems. For example, I remember an
exam problem for Tokyo University that
asked applicants to explain the culture of
14th-16th century Japan by referring to
specific cultural performances and the
situation of the local peasants.
These problems do force students to
analyze information and write clearly. I
have heard that Hungarian universities
require oral exams in addition to written
exams, which I believe adds another
dimension to assessing students. Thus, I
do not believe that exams are necessarily
bad.

education styles, nobody cares how you

Obama's new support Moving forward together

on the hotel project

swarthmorephoenix.com

We are headed toward an energy crisis in the United
States. I am no conspiracy theorist nor am I a left-wing
environmentalist suggesting the world will end in 50 years
due to our use of fossil fuels. All hyperbole aside, I am a
realist. With the current instability in the Middle East, the
price of oil will keep rising, far above the current $lOO per
barrel it hovers around.
In America, we need to decrease our dependence offoreign oil. Relying on energy from countries such as Libya,
Iran and Saudi Arabia is not in our national interest, nor
is it sustainable. The United States needs to develop its
own sources of energy. And, yes to all environmentalists,

native energy: hydrogen, nuclear, wind, etc. Our methods
M
for obtaining energy are not, however, going to change
overnight. These alternatives need to be made economically viable. In the meantime,
drilling for oil in America is the best alternative.
President Obama even appeared to show some willingness to support offshore
drilling upon taking office. Obama announced in March of last year that he would
allow for exploration off parts of the Atlantic coastline, parts of the eastern Gulf of
Mexico and in Alaska on the north coast. This was understood at the time as a policy
looking to reduce the cost ofenergy and part of a long-term fix for our energy problem.
In December, the administration changed its tune. According to an opinion piece
published by the editorial board of the Washington Post, Obama's reversal was meant
"to keep the waters off the East and West coasts and the eastern Gulf ofMexico off-limits to exploration indefinitely." This politically expedient position came following the
disastrous Gulf oil spill that plagued the administration throughout the summer.
The hypocrisy of Obama's flip-flop came to light last week when he gave a speech
in Brazil. Obama gave his support to the new offshore drilling planned off the coast of
Brazil, even going as far to assure that country that the United States would like to get
some of its oil from Brazil. Obama told the gathering in Brasilia that "when you're
ready to start selling, we want to be one of your best customers."
On Wednesday, in a speech at Georgetown University, President Obama clarified
his position on offshore drilling and offered his long-term plan for decreasing
America's dependence on foreign oil. This speech included support for offshore
drilling exploration, a reversal of Obama's previous position. While this flip-flop will
anger environmentalists, the move will likely help Obama with independent voters
worried about gas prices.

Republicans should seize this
opportunity to craft a clear plan for tackling the energy issue, taking advantage of
Obama's reelection worries. If Republicans choose not to take up the energy issue,
Obama will be forced to implement his new approach by executive order, giving himself a great campaign talking point.
Republicans in Congress must articulate that drilling offshore now and decreasing
America's dependence on foreign oil will provide a transition period as alternative
energy is developed and made more market-viable. While Obama did change his position in order to support more offshore oil exploration, he focused a lot on "environmentally safe" drilling. This makes sense in light of the BP oil spill, but it sounds as
though receiving permits will be a bureaucratic nightmare. A concise and coherent
system needs to be developed to ensure these permits are granted, and this should be
set up by the Congress.
We need a more nuanced approach to easing our dependence on foreign oil and protecting the environment. President Obama's remarks on Wednesday signal that he is
willing to allow this to happen. The president understands that we are not going to end
our demand for foreign oil or oil in general overnight. And, I give Obama credit for
recognizing this. It is a nice change away from the cap-and-trade mantra the administration tried to get passed in Congress.
President Obama has opened the door to developing a consensus approach to dealing with America's looming energy crisis. One of the main criticisms I have of Obama
a criticism shared by some political scientists
is that Obama does not have the
chutzpah to stand up and articulate a clear policy direction that he believes in. He is
willing to alter his policy positions for either the purpose of getting legislation passed
or political gain. Obama has shown that he is willing to change his position on offshore oil exploration, so this is the chance for Republicans to develop their own ener„^

Once alternative energy becomes more cost-efficient than using fossil fuels, alternative energy will prevail. We are not at that point yet, and I applaud the President for
recognizing this. It is a welcome change.

As the college’s hotel project has materialized over the course of the past few
years, SLAP has been engaging with the administration and campus community in order to ensure concrete protections for hotel employees, in large part
because the hotel industry’s record of poor labor standards is in direct conflict
with the college’s own standards and values. While an affirmation of the college’s principles of fair employment and compensation is encouraging, we feel
that the college should specify how they will move these principles from paper to practice. President Chopp’s recent op-ed
states that hotel employees “will be provided wages consistent

with the college’s compensation policies.”
However, does that mean that hotel employees will be fully
covered by Swarthmore’s existing Living Wage Policy? If the college is truly
serious about ensuring not only fair compensation, but also crucial components of the Living Wage Policy such as the childcare subsidy benefit and full
HMO health coverage for lowest-paid staff and their families, then the administration should clarify in writing that this commitment applies to all employees of this hotel project and specify how they will uphold it.
As the college continues to seriously consider hiring an outside hotel operating company to be the employer (in the absence of a hotel management
school, the college lacks the resources), how will the college ensure that this
employer will adhere to college’s “Statement of Principles?”
In this same statement, SLAP’s efforts to ensure such accountability were
misrepresented. In actuality,

of their choosing, whether
that means forming an independent, site-specific collective bargaining unit, or,
of course, not to form a union at all.
This right is protected under the type of neutrality agreement for which we
have advocated. SLAP has proposed that such an agreement be signed between
the employer and UNITE HERE, as UNITE HERE is currently the main union
organizing hotel workers nationwide; however, under the agreement we have
proposed, workers would ultimately choose whether and with which union to

tant protection.

We have also advocated for the college to allow for workers to have the
option of a “majority sign-up” process (sometimes referred to as card check) in
addition to the legally codified NLRB process of forming a union. At a fundamental level, endorsing unequivocal support for elections overseen by the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) sidesteps the fact that a “neutral election” is hardly the realized norm in workplaces across America. To ignore the
power that employers regularly exercise to influence an election would be a
reckless assumption.
In the period between when workers call for an election and when the election actually takes place, employers can and regularly do use all sorts of illicit
and illegal tactics to influence the outcome of the vote: firing vocal leaders,
intimidating workers, holding captive-audience meetings during work hours to
present the evils of unionization, and, in some cases, buying off employee support.

A 2005 study from the University of Illinois at Chicago reports that during
union organizing drives, 30 percent of employers fire workers who want to
exercise their right to form a union, 49 percent of employers threaten to close a
work site when workers try to form a union and 82 percent of employers hire
high-priced union-busting consultants to fight organizing campaigns.
This culture of organizing is often the lived experience of workers in the
hotel industry and is hardly the democratic process that the administration
endorses. The rhetoric of President Chopp’s recent op-ed, eerily reminiscent of
anti-union language one may find in books on hotel management, implies a
vested interest in maintaining the hotel industry status quo
an environment
in which employers have free reign to forcefully prevent workers from organizing freely and having a voice in the workplace.
While we value the college’s public statements on their website and recent
editorials stating their support for the principles of “fair labor standards” and
“the right of employees to unionize,” it remains to be seen what positive, concrete steps the college will take to translate these words into practice. We have
reached a consensus on these values and hope to move forward together toward
committed action.

Mar. 24 editorial overlooks the agency of the Libyan people
To the Editor:
I refer to the editorial last week entitled
"Intervention in Libya needs multilateral support."
Although the editorial is, on the surface, about multilateralism regarding the no-fly zone in Libya, I
think it lacks a complete understanding of the situ-

cartoon

by

ation. A closer reading of the editorial leads me to
three responses.
First, the editorial does not show an understanding of the urgency of the situation. The editorial
asks if "voting for the resolution without military
support" would've been more prudent.

emma

waitzman

The answer is, I think, an unequivocal "no."
The strictures of "multilateralism" meant that
the Libyan resistance was in real danger of being
destroyed by Qaddafi, who was making large territorial gains into rebel territory with superior military and weaponry.
Second, the editorial confuses multilateralism
and joint "great power" action. How much more
multilateralism do you need, when you have virtually universal consent from the UN, Arab League
backing, and a plea for interventionfrom the Libyan
people? The editorial is foolish to think that Russia,
China, Brazil or India would send jets to Libya
this is clearly not going to happen.
Clearly, the BRIC countries abstained not to scuttle an intervention (they could've just voted no).
BRIC will not be involved militarily but at the same
time will not stand in the way of the international
community.
If joint "great power" action is not possible, does
the argument support continued talk while Qaddafi
sets his guns on his people? The question to ask is
not whether BRIC military support should be a precursor to intervention, but given universal consensus on the necessity of intervention, how best to
defend the Libyan people.
Third, and most importantly, the editorial is written from
a very
ironically, given its title
myopic perspective. This is not about America, its
"two other messy wars in the Middle East," budget
cuts, BRIC or China's state-owned media. This is not
about you. This is about the Libyan people.
The editorial completely ignores the will and
agency of the people of Libya specifically and the
Arab world at large. Nowhere does the editorial take
into account the safety and security of the Libyan
people
who have shown courage and action in
their groundswell of emotion against a crazy, vindictive dictator.
The "Allies" are not leading this insurrection;
they are merely assisting the Libyan resistance,
against the background of unprecedented political
developments in the Arab world. For these reasons,
I think the editorial's arguments should fall.

Troubling evolution in journalism seen in new paid online model
BY MALCOLM-WILEY T. FLOYD
thecrimson.com, Mar. 29, 2011
Earlier this month, I was one of
thousands of NYTimes.com readers
who visited the site's homepage to
learn that the publication would soon
be introducing a pay model for its
online content.
As a devoted reader and fan of The
Times, I must conclude that the step
toward a pay model was regrettably
inevitable, and indicative of not only a
large change in the role The Times will
play in the world, but also the continuing evolution of journalism in the digital age.
In the business section, The Times
reports that the paid online subscription was "in the works for years,"
which speaks to its inevitability. The
recession of the past few years hit
many industries hard, but few were hit
as hard as online advertising.
Even as the world slowly recovers
from the downturn, the now-former
system does not seem to be economically sustainable, so it is hard to blame
The Times for wanting to make a profit-minded change. With the failure of

THE PHOENIX

the Seattle Post-Intelligencer fresh in
executives' memories, the cost of doing
nothing is clearly too large.
However, it would be a mistake for
us to accept this change as unavoidable without at examining the social
cost.

The Times' online pay model is the
beginning of a divide in journalism.
On one end, there will be the high-quality, in-depth, comprehensive journalism that The Times has provided for
years, and on the other end will be a
lower-quality alternative.
As readers realize that they must
pay for high-quality content, fewer will
be willing to do so. As a result, there
will be more consumers in the market
for low-quality journalism, and so the
two varieties will diverge further.
But it is clear that the New York
Times Company did its best to mitigate
this divide. It avoided the traditional
pay wall model employed by other publications such as the Wall Street
Journal.
Furthermore, the flexibility of The
Times model allows it to control the
limit of free articles, so that in an
emergency that limit might be lifted.

Lastly, they embrace social media by
allowing access to all content through
social networking sites such as

Facebook and Twitter.
These aspects of the model demonstrate The Times' understanding of the
potential risks of the pay model, and
should be commended.
Despite these efforts, there will still
be a limit on journalistic content, and
the consequences of this limit and the
resulting segmentation in journalism
are potentially very serious.
The average reader will likely be
less informed. Perhaps worse, the poorer reader will likely be less informed.
While there might be few differences
between the news content on sites like
NYTimes.com and other free alternatives, it is clear that these differences
will grow as the divide between high
and low quality journalism widens.
This divide in journalism threatens to
create worsen the information gap
between the rich and the poor.
On this level, it is socially inefficient to think of the New York Times
Company, or any other company that
engages in journalism as "just a business." Whether this move will make

March 31, 2011

business sense remains to be seen (the
company's earlier venture with paid
online content, TimesSelect, was
quickly discontinued after an internal
study deemed it unprofitable).
However, The Times as a national
leader in journalism has a mandate to
benefit the public, as a well functioning democracy demands a open press.
Therefore, it might be helpful to
think of journalism as a type of public
good, roughly akin to national defense.
It is ineffective when one tries to
exclude people from it, and its value
isn't diminished when more people
consume it.
Considering journalism a public
good suggests that it might not best be
provided by a profit-seeking entity like
a company. For instance, the BBC, a
world leader in journalism is run by
the British government. Wikipedia,
one of the most influential online information providers, operates as a nonprofit.
Neither of these are suitable solutions now for The Times, but the evolution of online journalism suggests
that these may be the socially optimal
solutions of the future.

Sports columnist to pen book on PSU's Paterno
BY MIKE DUSASK
collegian.psu.edu, Mar. 30,

2011

Joe Posnanski, a senior writer at
Sports Illustrated, announced on his
blog last Tuesday that he has signed
on to write a book on the life and
impact of Penn State football coach
Joe Paterno.
But it's not just another foot note in
his long sports journalism career.
Posnanski called this book his "dream
project."

"Joe's career is so vast and fasciambitious," Posnanski
said. "It feels to me as something larger than a sports story. It's a great
American story."
The former Kansas City Star columnist says that he has been thinking
about doing a book on Paterno for a
couple of years, dating back to when
he wrote a feature titled "Top of the
World, Pa" on Paterno for Sports
Illustrated in 2009.
"A new book is very exciting, both
for the students and the alumni,
nating and

16

because when people think of Penn
State, they think about Joe Paterno
before anything else," Artie Hinaman
(junior-telecommunications) said.
Posnanski will write the book for
Simon and Schuster Publishing, and
he plans to take about 18 months to
write the book. To do so, he'll be
changing his area code to State
College, moving to the area to indulge
himself in the culture.
He plans to continue to write and
blog for SI while working on the book.
Sure, this isn't the first time someone has written a book about Penn
State's legendary head coach, but
Posnanski says this one will be differ-

ent.

"I've read a lot of the books about
Joe and several of them are really
good," Posnanski said. "I think there's
a larger story here, something more
ambitious, about the man I consider
the most influential person in the history of college football."
Paterno is the winningest coach in
the history of Division I football. His

wins are the most in Bowl
Subdivision, formerly D-l, history, and
401

he'll be roaming the Beaver Stadium
sideline for an unprecedented 46th
season in the fall.
But Paterno's impact on the university stretches farther than the 100
yards of playing field at Beaver
Stadium, something Posnanski plans
to focus on in the book.
"As a coach, as a philanthropist, as
a symbol, as an educator and as an
icon he's the most influential person
to be at Penn State since the university was built," Posnanski said.
The coach and his wife, Sue
Paterno, have contributed over $4 million toward departments and colleges
at the university over the years, such
as the Penn State All-Sports Museum
at Beaver Stadium. They also helped
raise money for the expansion of
Pattee Library in 1997, the expansion
was named in their honor, Paterno
Library.

Paterno has always been lauded for
getting the most of his players aca-

demically, wanting to give them an
education in addition to a football
career. Penn State football posted an
85 percent graduation rate last year,
second only in the Big Ten to
Northwestern, and far exceeding the
67 percent FBS average.
"He is the most influential man in
the history of college football, not only
because he won games, and not only
because of his efforts to graduate players, and not only because of his
attempt to raise young men,"
Posnanski said. "But all of it, combined into one sprawling, ambitious,
challenging and grand career."
Though he has no exact timetable,
Posnanski said he expects the book to
be done late next year and targets a
release date around Father's Day in
2013.

"He's college football's Lombardi,
his ambition is larger,"
Posnanski said. "Lombardi wanted to
get his team as close to perfection as
possible. Joe has wanted that and
more."

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION H

Storied former Lion retires from competition
BY DAN NORTON
collegian.psu.edu, Mar. 30, 2011

Gymnastics was all he thought
about his entire life.
For 23 years, former Penn State
men's gymnast and assistant coach
Kevin Tan has been at it on the mats.
As early as this season, the 2008
Olympian dressed, warmed up and
practiced as a gymnast every day
before the student-athletes arrived.
The casual onlooker never would have
guessed he was a coach.
But one day, Tan came to the White
Building wearing a polo shirt and
khakis instead of a uniform.
Tan formally announced his retirement Wednesday morning through the
Penn State athletic department. The
29-year-old decided several months ago
that his body couldn't take the strain
of gymnastics anymore. He was training to qualify for a spot on the U.S.
Olympic roster for London 2012.
He didn't make his decision public
until yesterday in case he changed his
mind.
"Look at Brett Favre and Michael
Jordan," Tan said regarding the delay
of the announcement. "People have
come back from retirement and still
have done very well. But this seems to
be the right decision."
Tan has passed the peak age of a typical male gymnast, which he said hovers around the early 20s. He would be
30 years old by the time he competed in
the 2012 Olympic Games.
Furthermore, Tan has suffered from
a plethora of injuries since competing
for the United States at the 2008
Olympics in Beijing. Shoulder surgery
in late-2008 kept him out of the gym for
over a year and other ailments have
impeded his training regimen since

his return.
"My body was starting to hurt quite
a bit," Tan said. "At that point, I saw
my opportunities outside gymnastics
more so than inside as an assistant
coach, as a soon-to-be husband, and as
the next chapter of my life in general."
Retiring wasn't an easy decision for
Tan to make. Gymnastics became a
large part of Tan's life while competing
at the collegiate level. He was back at
Penn State as a full-time assistant
coach a year after graduating in 2004,
and even then he wasn't done competing on the international level.
As reality began to set in, Tan realized that at his current level he wouldn't make the Olympic team. He confided some of his frustration with head
coach Randy Jepson.
"A couple times came up when he
was struggling and I knew it was really hard for him," Jepson said. "I didn't
make it easy on him, it had to be his
decision."
Jepson is not Tan's superior anymore. As Tan transitioned from a student-athlete to an international competitor to an assistant coach at Penn
State, his relationship with Jepson
evolved.
Tan found it confusing at times
identifying Jepson's role in his life.
They were colleagues as fellow coaches, but when Tan trained, Jepson was
although Jepson said it's
the "boss"
never really seemed like that.
But the role confusion did not have
a negative effect on Tan, considering
all the success he's had under Jepson's
tutelage.

"It was a little bit nerve-wracking
when I first came out here in 2005 to be
that coach, because Randy was so
many roles at that point," Tan said. "I
was afraid how we were going to keep

all separate.
"He's been above and beyond anything I've ever hoped for. I think that's
what made it so much easier to stay
here and train rather than go somewhere else. I had a coach here who was
dedicated to me and knew exactly who
I was, and we trusted each other."
When Jepson first recruited Tan out
of California in 1999, Tan had no idea
the roller coaster ride that was in store
for him during the following decade.
All he knew was that he had some
scholarship money to give, and Tan
looked very promising.
Tan's mom passed away during the
recruiting process, which made it difficult for him to focus on his college
decision.
"It was very difficult in the sense
that I was drawn to family so much
after that," he said. "Being that life is
unexpected that way and you never
know what's going to happen."
Tan ended up choosing Penn State
because of the family aspect Jepson
brought to his team. That sense of
unity brought out some of Tan's best
gymnastics. He won one team national
championship with the Nittany Lions
and two individual still rings titles,
etching his name into Penn State's history books.
It was during his time at the collegiate level that he realized just how
much he loved the sport. He had
planned to graduate with his major in
finance and enter the job market, but
that no longer satisfied him. Tan
recalled making what would become
the second-hardest decision of his gymnastics career
not retiring in 2004.
He wasn't done yet. He wanted to be
an Olympian.
"The Olympics have always been a

dream," Tan said. "But it's one thing to
to do it.
"If I didn't give it that shot now,
there would always be something in
the back of my mind, and I wasn't
ready to let go of that."
Tan ultimately achieved his dream
not only when he made the Olympic
team, but also when he was named the
team's captain. He led the underdog
Americans in Beijing to a bronze
medal when most didn't expect them to
make the finals.
"They put that medal around my
neck and I looked straight up and I
gave that big sigh of relief," he said
with a huge smile on his face.
Tan has that medal at home, but has
his countless other medals and awards
sitting in his office in the White
Building. In his prime, he always lived
in the present, but now that he's a
coach, he can look fondly at those
awards and reminisce.
His memories are of successes he
once never thought possible. He realizes his career is painted a clear coat of
gold, silver and bronze. He is content.
But at the same time, he is sad. He
accepts that his career is over, and his
time in the limelight has ended.
However, Tan would never start a
new chapter of his life without gymnastics in some capacity. He can now
focus on coaching, and imparting'his
wisdom to a younger generation of
gymnasts.
He loves every minute of it.
"I love being able to share the experiences which I hold so dear to me with
these guys to make them the athlete
that I believe they can be," Tan said.
"And to have them go through the
process and realize that himself. It's
almost giving back to a program that
has given me so much."

Women's lacrosse
defeats Bryn Mawr
and McDaniel, men
gain comeback victory
over Muhlenberg
BY DANIEL DUNCAN
dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's lacrosse

team got its first Centennial Conference
win on Saturday against Bryn Mawr.

The Garnet blew past the Owls with a
score of 19-5. The Garnet improved to 5-2,
and 1-1 in Centennial play.
The Garnet never trailed in the game,
with Samantha Panepinto 'l3 striking
first just 20 seconds into the game.

Although Bryn Mawr briefly threatened,
tying the game two minutes into the first
period, the outcome was never in doubt.
Swarthmore went on an 11-0 run to take
a commanding lead and invoke the clockkilling mercy rule five minutes into the
game.

Bryn Mawr's Natalie Chrismer tried
to keep things interesting, accounting
singlehandedly for all of the Owls points
with four goals and an assist to Kathleen
Magner's goal in the first period. The
Owls went on a 2-0 run late in the first
half, but the Garnet responded with
seven consecutive goals. Another Bryn
Mawr run to close the game was too little, much too late.
The Garnet saw four different players
record hat tricks: Emily Evans 'll (five
goals), Corinne Sommi 'l4 (four),
Annalise Penikis 'l3 (three) and Marie
Mutryn 'l2 (three). Two goals from
Nicole Vanchieri 'l3 and one apiece from
Panepinto and Emma Sipperly 'l4 rounded out the scoring.
Penikis doubled up on hat tricks,

adding four assists to her three goals.
Mutryn and Sommi added two more.

Swarthmore dominated almost every
facet of the game, picking up three times
as many ground balls as the Owls, and
outshooting them by an almost 4:1 mar-

gin. The Garnet also caused 11 turnovers
to the Owls' five.
Panepinto felt that thoroughly outplaying the Owls was a team goal. "We
really wanted to emphasize playing

Women's lacrosse at Penn: a true family affair
BY JENNIFER SCUTERI
dailypennsylvanian.com, Mar. 29, 2011

Sure, lacrosse is a team sport. But
for the Penn women's lacrosse team,
it's a family affair.
In the Franklin Field stands, it's
impossible to miss the enthusiastic
group of mothers and fathers demonstrating their unwavering support for
their daughters on the turf.
And make no mistake about it, this
dedicated group enjoys every second
