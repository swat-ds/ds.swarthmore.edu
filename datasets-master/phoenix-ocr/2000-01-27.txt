A recent fire at Seton Hall has many asking if

Swarthmore

flames
By

Rachel Labush I Phoenix Staff

Last week's fire at Seton Hall University popped the Swarthmore
bubble and set off alarm bells in the minds of students and administrators. The fire has stimulated reflection about Swarthmore's own
level of fire preparedness and has brought to light some of the discrepancies between policy and practice at the college.

Public Safety's list of contraband items includes hot
plates, toasters, candles, incense and halogen
lamps. Although forbidden, these items are endemic
to college dorms and are available in the bookstore.

Preventable

tragedy

Boland Hall, the building decimated by the fire, used to be home
to 600 carousing 18-year-olds. Fraternity pledges and troublemakers triggered smoke detectors regularly by blowing cigarette smoke
into the sensors or by tapping lit cigarettes under them.
Most students ignored the sound of an alarm at 4:30 a.m., and those
who heeded it wasted precious time dressing for the cold weather

License plate thefts continue to plague campus
Eighteen thefts reported in last month; Public Safety

Phoenix Staff

A rash of license plate thefts
that began in March and exploded last weekend has pitted
public Safety against the perpetrators in a vicious drag race.
Public Safety won the last
round: its staff recently uncovered a pile of stolen plates from
311 undisclosed site on
campus

They are stepping up their in-

vestigative efforts and hope to
Put an end to the thievery soon.
Director Owen Redgrave said,
We do have some leads."
aince March, 43 plates from
twenty states have been stoJnerfrom
various sites around
pPus, with 18 of them occurP8 just in the last month. Origi-

nally, Public Safety investigators
assumed that the perpetrator
was trying to collect plates from
all fifty states; now, however,
they count several states for
which multiple plates have been
stolen.
The theft of the plates from a
Student Council van used to
transport students to Genuardi's
also indicates that the plates selected are sought out for more
than reasons of origin.
David Zipper 'OO would like to
see the case closed soon. His
plates were stolen on Thursday
or Friday, and they have not yet
been recovered. He was parked
in the C-lot across from the
fieldhouse at the time.
"Quite frankly," Zipper said, "I
drive my car into North Philadelphia every few days, and it's at
Swarthmore where my license

plate gets stolen. That's really
rather aggravating."
He will have to wait several
months before his request for
new plates can be processed.
For Dave Knouf 'O2, the prospect of that wait was enough to
make him get out his epoxy glue.
He was with Tom Stepleton 'O2 in
September whenStepleton found
out his plates were stolen.
Knouf said he sympathized
with his friend's loss, but "what
was really on my mind was getting back to my own car. I
thought Indiana license plates
were rare around the campus, so
I figured I should do what I
could."

outside. By the time anyone smelled smoke, the situation was desperate. Students jumped out of windows,
crawled through smoke, and climbed down ladders to
safety. Three students died, and many more were hospitalized for burns and smoke inhalation.
Boland Hall had no sprinkler system, raising allegations
of university negligence. None of the dormitories at
Swarthmore has sprinklers, either. Like those in Boland
Hall, students in Willets routinely ignore early morning
fire alarms, such as the one at 4:00 a.m. this past Monday
morning, which drew only 15 or so grumpy evacuees.
According to Larry Schall, vice president of facilities
and services, the fire at Seton Hall "has, of course,
prompted us to look again closely at what we do here
and what else we might do to make sure Swarthmore
remains a safe place." Dana and Hallowell, the only
dorms without central smoke detectors in each room, are
scheduled to get them this summer. Sprinklers are included in the renovation plan for Parrish and in the plans
for a new dormitory. As of now, the only buildings at
Swarthmore that have sprinklers are Trotter, Kohlberg
and Pearson.
Schall said that reducing the number of false alarms
is a priority, "so that students don't get the attitude that
they do not have to respond to alarms."
He added that current safety measures include fire
drills in residence halls each semester and monthly inspections of fire extinguishers. However, RA Sean
Brennan 'OO attests that Mary Lyons has not had a single
fire drill this year.

A Line

of

Defense

The spring 2000 directory contains an emergency response guide which outlines proper procedure in the case
of a fire. RAs, who are trained in fire safety, were all
given a similar guide in the fall, but most students currently have no idea how to respond to a real fire, or even
how to use a fire extinguisher.
One group of students, however, is extremely well-prepared for fire: the volunteer firefighters. Thirty-seven
Swarthmore students provide invaluable services to the
community through their participation in theborough's fire
company. Lengthy courses prepare the studentfirefighters
for preventing and fighting fire as a team, something the
students say is an incredibly rewarding experience.
Will Ortman 'O2 and Dan Krausz 'O2, two members of

Jmn
the few Wharton fire alarms last semester were mechanical or purposely set off, and that residents were responsive to them. John Dolan 'Ol, Dana 3rd RA, says that when
smoke or steam from the kitchen sets off the fire alarm,
people generally evacuate, particularly freshmen. Willets
is an unfortunate exception to this good behavior: false
alarms are frequent there, and many students ignore them.
Outside of dormitories, the science buildings pose the
greatest threatto fire safety. According to chemistry professor Robert Paley, the chemistry labs "have lots of stuff
which is hazardous." Hazardous materials can react with
even small amounts of water to start a fire.
A newly revised laboratory emergency response guide
will be distributed on campus this week. It outlines in
detail the proper responses to every lab emergency, including fires. Occupational andEnvironmental Safety Of-

Swarthmore's Response
The college responded to the Seton Hall fire with two
all-campus e-mails. The first, sent by Dean of the College Bob Gross, stated that the fire "gives us reason to
pause and consider our own fire safety habits." Later
that afternoon, Public Safety sent an e-mail saying that
the fire "is a vivid reminder of the importance of fire
prevention practices."
The public safety e-mail discussed the "cry wolf syndrome caused by false alarms and urged students to take
responsibility for reducing the number of such alarms.
But beyond the suggestions and admonitions in the e-mail,
students have seen very few tangible changes or updates.
The fire and the college's response to it highlight some
of the longstanding contradictions in fire safety at
Swarthmore. Public Safety's list of contraband items includes "cooking appliances (including coffee makers),
hot plates, toaster ovens, space heaters, candles, incense,
halogen lamps, and any device producing an open flame."
Although forbidden, these items are endemic to college
dormitories, and many of them are available in the
Swarthmore bookstore. For many students, their usefulness outweighs their danger.
Poor lighting in rooms encourages many students to
use halogen lamps, and even trained volunteer
firefighters burn candles and use coffee makers. Almost
no one takes the rules seriously.
Nowhere does the threat of fire seem more real than
in Parrish. Tales of the "special Parrish five-alarm fire"
and a burning time of five minutes are widespread, possibly because Parrish has burned to the ground before,
on Sept. 25, 1881. Triggered by a physics lab explosion,
the fire proved unstoppable. No one was hurt, and
Swarthmore survived, but the sight of a burning Parrish
was firmly imprinted in the institutional memory of the
college, where it still inspires fear.
Over 100 years later, in Septemberl9B3, the Tarble Social Center suffered irreparable damage in a fire. The
building, then the center of student life on campus, probably burned as a result of arson, according to Ellen
Chijoke of the Friends Historical Library.
In response to the Tarble fire, students concerned about
insufficient fire precaution on campus staged a sit-in in
Parrish until College President David W. Fraser promised
a centralized firealarm system. The incident thus hastened
the implementation of the system, which greatly increased
the school's chances of preventing a disaster. Nonetheless,
two series of arson incidents one from 1981 to 1983 and
another a few years ago causedboth destructionand worry.

hazards ofcloth or paper touching halogen lamps. Krausz
would like to see sprinkler systems in all "high-life areas," including dormitories and buildings with offices.
They say that, on average, a dorm fire would double in
size each minute that it continued to burn. The minutes
that Swatties often spend doubting a fire alarm are indeed precious, and as Seton Hall has shown, potentially
disastrous.
However, several RAs on campus responded to concerns
by affirming that response to fire alarms is not as abysmal
as many students may think. Parrish has had complete
evacuation during eachofits three alarms this year, thanks
in part to students' own fears of Parrish's flammability. In
Mertz, which had four or five alarms last semester, cooking or candles are usually the culprit. "If it is not a birthday cake, I'll goaround trying to get people out," says Leigh

HR director
search nears
conclusion
By Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
Quakerly consensus-building has prolonged decision-making in the search for
anew human resources director, but now,
after ten months, the end is finally in sight.
The selection committee will hold a meeting today to present the second of its final
two candidates to the staff.
The situation began to frustrate staff in
March, when the vacancy arose, and the
problem was compounded by the departure of the person in charge of benefits
soon after. The employees left in the Human Resources Department have since
been flooded with work. Staffboth inside
and outside of the department hope that
the selection committee will make a final
decision sometime in February and thus
begin to make the department's work
more manageable.
But problems in the Human Resources
Department date back well before last
jspring, and it may be wishful thinking to
believe that they will come to an end with
the selection of a new director. The department has seen three or four different directors in the past ten years not a good
turnover rate for a college that prides itself on employee retention.
Judy Downing, director of the computing center and a member of the selection
committee, said that the college has
rouble retaining bright, capable people
in human resources because the business
sector attracts the best candidates.
Amherst faces similar difficulties in reaining people in human resources.
Downing added, however, that she believes thatthis time the situation may have
changed. This marks the first time that
the college has used an outside search
firm to find candidates, and the two finalists have been chosen from among a pool
)f the firm's recruits. Julie
Miran, an employee of CornellLibrary and staffrepresentative to the selection committee, said,
'The consultant has been excellent. She
'rings a tremendous depth of experience

Keller: Campaign finance needs reform
Common Cause's chief lobbyist speaks during collection last Friday
By Ted Chan
Phoenix Staff
Attorney Matt Keller, the senior lobbyist for the citizens' rights group Common Cause joinied the Swarthmore College community on Friday for the first
collection of the year. Keller gave an energetic talk about campaign finance reform to a small audience that included
President Al Bloom, several faculty
members and about thirty students.
In the lecture, which was sponsored
by Bloom's office, Keller claimed that
campaign finance reform is an absolute
necessity. In particular, he cited the need
to eliminate the soft money loophole
which Democrats and Republicans use
to receive donations from private citizens and corporations. In return, these
donors receive some sort of influence
on politicians. Common Cause, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization which advocates open and accountable government, is one of the leaders
in the crusade to eliminate the soft
money loophole and reform the manner
in which elections are financed.

"It's because they want
something.What that is, is
access to policymakers."
Matt Keller
Keller proved himself to be a charismatic speaker, illustrating his points
well with anecdotes and statistics. "The
system in Washington has been broken
down to the point where there virtually
are no campaign finance laws. A staggering amount of money is given to the
people who are supposed to represent
the interests of the people," saidKeller.
Campaign finance reform packages
are currently bogged down in Congress
because of a filibuster led by Senator
Mitch McConnell (R-Kan.). According to
Keller, the current McCain-Feingold Bill
requires seven more votes in order to
pass, but that those seven votes might
as well be a million because of the unwillingness of politicians to budge on the
issue.
Nearly $750 million is expected to be
donated to the coffers of the two major
parties in the United States in the year
2000.
According to Keller the reasons for
the donations are simple: "It's because
they want something. What that is, is access to policymakers." One example he
provided was of an oil mogul whose
$600,000 donation may allow him access
to oil pipelines that could net him $2 billion in the future.
In his conclusion, Keller told the audience that campaign finance is necessary to represent the majority.
He said thatanyone who feels strongly
about an issue can find a way for that
issue to benefit from the more equal representation that campaign finance reform would help to provide. He then
fielded twenty minutes of questions.
All in all, Keller provided an insightful and lively hour of discussion for the
small crowd.
"I thought he was very charismatic
and illustrated the issues well with examples," said Catherine Vanderwaart
'O3. "He really got me thinking about the
importance of campaign finance reform."

CAYLEY PENDERGRASS | Phoenix Staff

NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN | Phoenix Staff

Common Cause chief lobbyist Matt Keller said that the current campaign finance system
needs reform but that filibusters in the Senate keep the McCain-Feingold bill from passing
each time it is considered in Congress. Keller spoke at a collection sponsored by the
College Democrats and the President's Office in LPAC Cinema last Friday.

College Bulletin pursues
report on alcohol policy

The Daily Princetonian (Princeton U.)

Reporter interviews
drunken students at
Saturday's Paces party
By Drew Adams
Phoenix Staff
If you were at the International Club
party at Paces on Saturday night, you
might've noticed an older man taking pictures of the festivities and chatting up the
partygoers. Just a guy capturing Kodak
moments for the internationals and reliving memories of parties past? Not quite,
as it turns out: he was a freelance photographer covering the effectiveness of
Swarthmore's alcohol policy for an upcoming issue of the Swarthmore College
Bulletin, the college's alumni magazine.
Jeff Lott, the magazine's editor, said that
because of the rise in alcohol-related incidents at colleges across the nation, including Swarthmore's Margaritaville fiasco last spring and alcohol poisoning
deaths at colleges like MIT and
Vanderbilt, he sees a need to inform
alumni of the current state of college alcohol policy.
The article is not intended as an expose
of alcohol abuse, however. The Bulletin is
published under the guidance of the college administration and is therefore unlikely to cast a negative light on official
college policies. As Lott admitted, "we're
not telling administration anything they
don't already know."
Despite this, several students around
campus voiced some concern about the
photographer/reporter. As Jessica

Sonnenschein 'OO said, "If he had gone to
Parrish Parlours to talk to students, he
would've gotten plenty of quotes. A party
seems like a weird place to chat about the
alcohol policy."
Other students found it odd that he
didn't make any attempt to write down or
record students' comments, but nonetheless asked students ifthey could be quoted
in the upcoming story. In general, though,
Sonnenschein said, "the whole thing just
seemed really weird."

In
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J.
the first test of last year's Nude Olympics ban, the Princeton University campus was conspicuously silent at midnight Friday morning, with no indication of any large-scale attempt to resurrect the now-defunct event.
Equipped with cameras and blankets, Public Safety fanned out across
campus Thursday night and prepared
to apprehend and identify nude runners.
Nevertheless, Public Safety shift
supervisor Lloyd Best said Thursday
night he believed the university's
threat to suspend participants for one
year would deter students from running.
"I hope the kids don't jeopardize
theireducation just to run naked," Best
said.
As four inches of snow blanketed
Princeton Thursday afternoon, most
sophomores agreed that the appeal of
running naked was overshadowed by
the university's policy.
"I'm not going to run," David Volk
said. "I think the consequences are just
too severe. I guess the administration
has won, but I think they're being incredibly harsh and unreasonable about
it. We proposed all kinds ofalternatives
to the event."
Matt Frazier agreed.
"It's kind of a shame that it died as
hard as it did," he said. "People are too
afraid, in all honesty. There's no sense

of trying to break the law tonight because it just isn't worth it."
After last year's Nude Olympics, several students were transported to
Princeton Medical Center and treated
for severe intoxication, provoking the
university to ban the event.
The Nude Olympics' demise, which
has attracted widespread media attention, is continuing to generate national
interest. Anticipating the possibility of
students defying the ban, reporters
from the Associated Press arrived on
campus Thursday night only to find an
empty Holder Courtyard.
Administrators vowed Thursday that
the ban would be enforced.
"I couldn't be more emphatic," Assistant Dean of Student Life Marianne
Waterbury said. "We are absolutely
going to enforce a ban on the Nude
Olympics."
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Students Thomas Dunne agreed.
"It is my understanding that the university decided last year that they were
willing to suspend a large group of students," he said.
Sophomore class officers have recently scrambled unsuccessfully to
plan an alternative event. Thursday
morning, class president Ben Shopsin
sent out a class-wide e-mail apologizing for not scheduling a replacement
activity. He said he had suggested numerous activities, including a bonfire,
a tropical party, a bathing suit party,
an underwear party, an outdoor dance
party, a food fight and a snowball fight.
The administration rejected them.

edges, and epoxying them to the car." Knouf now believes that the
plate is secure, but he worries that his welding job will make it difficult to remove the plate if he ever needs to.
Swarthmore car owners never used to resort to gluing down their
plates. This is the first time that license plates have been targeted
for theft on campus. Redgrave said that in years past, he has seen
similar flurries of vehicle vandalismbut that past targets have been
restricted to hood ornaments and hubcaps.
Rumors abound about the identity and even number of the perpetrators. Both Zipper and Knouf believe that they reside on campus.
Some students speculate that license plates are on the list for a scavenger hunt sponsored by a dorm or fraternity. Redgrave said that
Public Safety has not ruled this out as a possibility.
Meanwhile, as Zipper seethes and Public Safety scrambles for
evidence, some students continue to see the thefts as all in good fun
One student, who asked not to be identified, said, "If I didn't lite
cars and wouldn'tfeel bad if someone stole my license plate, I woulc*

Need a number? Speak clearly
S2SK voice recognition computer program

now redirects calls

By Brendan Karch

Phoenix Staff
Dialing "0" just isn't what it
used to be.

Students and faculty in need of
assistance are now receiving the
"computerized touch," thanks to
a new $25,000 automated directory assistance program recently
installed by the Computing Center.

The new system uses speech
recognition software to automatically connect callers to the desired party in about 15 seconds.
Actual phone numbers are never
given, and the software is designed to confirm or question
less-than-perfectly matched queries.
The pre-packaged system,
which includes the high-end
hardware and software necessary to operate the program, was
purchased a month ago from
Phillips Voice Recognition Systems and paid for through President Al Bloom's discretionary
funds.
Already in use at other colleges
across the country, the system
was bought with the urging and

It "allows [the operator]
to focus on what the
college sees as a much

of [his or her] job."
Mark Dumic
support of Public Safety, the
Computing Center and the administration. Larry Schall, vice
president for facilities and services, initiated the purchase.
According to Mark Dumic,
manager of networking and systems, there had been concern
that students were flooding the
college operator with directory
assistance calls. The operator
also handles emergency dispatches, and the new system "allows [the operator] to focus on
what the college sees as a much
more critical part of [his or her]
job," explained Dumic. The operator can stillbe reached by saying "operator" to the new automated system, but in an emergency it is still quickest to call
directly at extension 8333.

Once the hardware and software arrived, ComputingCenter
staff needed to input the student
and faculty directories, but labor
was minimalbecause of well-updated phone number databases.
The system was tested for about
a week using Computing Center
names before it debuted to the
college. Dumic estimated 90 percent to 95 percent accuracy during the tests.
The software is programmed
to recognize common nicknames
and shortenings, such as "Jeff
for "Jeffrey," "Liz" for "Elizabeth" or "Bill" for "William."
Most recognition errors will
probably occur with foreign
names, which the system cannot
decipher as easily.
Students are encouraged to
test their names and contact Don
Osborne, the telecomadministrator, if it is mispronounced.
The Computing Center can
modify pronunciations to ensure
a better match. In addition, students who routinely go by their
middle name can have it added
to the database. Frivolous nicknames, however, will not be allowed.

NEWS BRIEFS

Pinball machines make $1500
The new pinball machines in Tarble brought in at least $l5OO last
semester, a figure that surprised Student Budget Committee Treasurer Laura Farra 'Ol.
Farra had never expected the games to be so profitable, she said,
adding that the $l5OO figure is "a low end estimate."
In a somewhat controversial purchase, SBC spent $6OOO on the
pinball machines last semester, acquiring three new ones and renovating the machine that had sat unused in the corner of Sharpies for
an indefinite period of time. The renovated machine has not yet
been returned and the fourth game in Tarble (Mars Attacks), actually belongs to the company that supplied the other three machines.
The profits from Mars Attacks go straight back to that company,
while SBC collects the money from the other three machines. That
money will initially go towards repaying the cost of the machines.
At an average rate of around $lOO a week, "we can get the turnaround in a few years," Farra said.

A campus whiteout
The deepest snowfall in years blanketed an unsuspecting Swarthmore College Tuesday. Although superficially the day was cold and wet, psychologically the
snow was a warm, cuddly reward for previous days of
dry, bitter wind with no opportunity for winter fun. Such
is the paradoxical nature of snow, as either a terrific
nuisance or an excuse, even a obligation, to take life less
seriously for the moment. The snow itself is neither
good nor bad, but how we humans perceive it as a
makes all the difference.
chore or as a pleasure
Those of us who chose the latter option and took
advantage of the snow to throw snowballs, play football
or build sculptures and forts owe thanks to the more
serious outlook of the college employees who shoveled,
scraped and plowed the paths clear to keep the campus
open for everyone else. The staff in dining services also
deserve special mention for managing to serve everyone despite a staff shortage. The food quality did suffer,
but at least we were warned in advance; that cannot be
said for the forecasters of the weather itself.
It was unfortunate that the all-out support effort was
not accompanied by speedy distribution of information.
The deans notified residential assistants by voicemail
early in the morning that classes were being held at
professors' discretion, but that left in the cold those
students who had their first scheduled class before
many RAs woke up to pass the official information
along. While the circumstances were difficult for
administrators still at home at that hour of the morning,
an all-campus e-mail explaining the situation would
have reached some students the voicemail did not.
Worse, because many classes were in session and it
was an almost normal day for students and faculty, the
abnormal inconvenience posed by those services that
the bookstore, mailroomand snack
were shut down
cheapened
bar in the evening, among other things
the heroic efforts of the staff in the essential departments who managed to keep the campus running.
That's a shame, because without their work it would
have been much more difficult for the college to
operate and not universally cancel classes.
Of course, complaining is just one way of dealing
with the fact of life that is the occasional Pennsylvania
snowfall. The other is celebrating the break from the
doldrums of a dry, dark winter. It speaks well of
Swarthmore's staff that there's little more to grumble
about than the unfulfilled hope of a complete day off
and, in the form of unexpected sledding or skiing or
snowball fighting, plenty of joy in the balance.

Improving fire safety
The fire at a Seton Hall dormitory last week not only
received national attention but also prompted an
official response from the college. Dean of the College
Bob Gross sent out a campus-wide e-mail reminding
in a grave, precautionary and somehwat
students
of the dangers of fire. The same day,
vague tone
Public Safety warned of the "cry wolf effect of false
alarms in another all-campus e-mail.
The college's response to the Seton Hall fire was
improperly directed. We understand the college's
desire to recognize the tragedy and caution students
but fire safety at Swarthmore is something more
complex and more contradictory than either of the emails let on.
In order to truly affect fire safety, the college has to
reconcile the contradictions that prohibit halogen
lamps and incense yet allow these items to be sold in
the bookstore, overcome the complacency about false
alarms (from students and staff) and correct the lapses
that allow dorms to go without fire drills. Infrastructure improvements are only the first step in this
process.
The boy who cried wolf, after all, was the only one at
fault for his own false alarms. At Swarthmore, fire
safety is truly a college-wide issue.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Don't jump to conclusions on race
To the Editor:
There have been many times before I read the opinions
article "Local bar plays the race card" by Jenny Yang
(Opinions, Jan. 20, pg. 12) that certain thoughts on racism
have crossed my mind. I never really said much about it
partly out of fear for being accused of undermining the
racial problem in a country I did not grow up in (I am an
international student), and partly because the topic does
not come up often among my friends. I am not going to
list in detail why as a reader I was not convinced thatthe
"treatment" Miss Yang and her friends received in the
was racial"; my point in writing is to
bar "no doubt
express my concern that such an absolute conclusion was
made with the evidence provided.
I, being Chinese, have lived and traveled in many
places on the globe, yet there was only one incident
when I could surely say I was discriminated against
because of my racial background. It may be because I
have been lucky, or maybe it is because I never actively
expected it or looked for it. I am not saying that since I

Hiring obligations
burden Gore
To the Editor:
As a young American with a budding career in politics, I must take issue withDan Korobkin's endorsement
of presidential candidate Al Gore (Opinions, Jan. 20, pg.
9).

Korobkin claims that Mr. Gore's "practical idealism"
trumps the "unrealistic and even naive" proposals set
forth by Bill Bradley to revamp Medicare and eliminate poverty. I am not one to dally in such wonkish niceties, and so will concede these points.
Yet Korobkin seems to have forgotten that Mr. Gore's
term as Vice President brings with it four years of patrons, friends, and interns, all of whom would vie for
staff positions within a hypothetical Gore administration. Having only been a Senator and occasional author,
Mr. Bradley has fewer obligations, and is more likely
to need the services of persons like myself should he
take office. My one vote may not win the primary, but
Mr. Bradley will be even more attracted to those potential employees who supportedhim at this early stage.
I hope that Korobkin's sentiments do not reflect those
of the Phoenix Editorial Board, or my fellow students.
Matt Schwartz 'Ol

seldom encounter racial discrimination that it must be
a self-indulging illusion of the victims. My gosh no. Nor
am I endorsing the behavior of the bartender and the
patrons who stared at Miss Yang and company like
"space aliens."
I am just warning that the accusation of playing a
race card should be used with caution in a situation such
as the one described in the article because the discriminative assumption that "they are white, thus this must
be racial" lurks near, and the danger of "reverse-racism" (from visible minorities against the white majority) rings close.
Let's say, if the bartender was black, would the same
situation be considered racial? A curious question foi
Miss Yang, who called her Latino friend "our Latim

The "beloved community" is the challenge,
the ultimate challenge, that Dr. King set

Conceptions of true community are rare

common good through virtue and love. It
sees people forming a cohesive community that operates under different rules
than those of rational self-interest. It
serves as a guardian for the benevolence
and sense of common purpose that we all
feel to some extent, but hide for fear of
being weak.
It would be this negotiation of our desires through common virtue that would
lead to a true peace and a true justice. This
is the essence of King's vision, to be
achieved through non-violence, compassion, and wisdom.

Look, if you will, at Senator Jesse
Helms's unrestrained arrogance and,
quite frankly, bad behavior when he addressed the U.N. Security Council. He

spoke with the clear intention of bringing
forth "the voice of the American people"
by announcing that America will withdraw from the United Nations if drastic
steps are not taken to orient the organization towards U.S. interests.
Most people on earth recognize the need
to have and to protect the United Nations,
the still nascent and very imperfect community of nations and peoples working
together toward the higher purpose of
peace and justice on the international
scene. Senator Helms is actively trying to
destroy this, because he believes that the
self-interested, aggressive and manipulative individualism of "Helmsian" foreign
policy vastly outweighs any advantages
that cooperation or guidance by agreed
principles can yield.
Every other nation, represented by its
ambassador, seems to vehemently dis-

agree.

I know that Helms, through his stringent opposition to civil rights legislation
in the 19605, knows no community and no
virtue. He only knows the cold calculus
of power and force. He claims to speak
for the American people. With the hope
that Dr. King's ideas have had some impact, I wonder if he really does.

Efficient and optimal: an ode to Xerox
By Nate M. Stulman
For The Phoenix

Professors at Swarthmore and elsewhere are increasingly incorporating the
Internet into their teaching. Professors
now routinely establish Web pages for their
courses and consider them extensions of
the classroom. While a course Web page
can be enormously beneficial for students
and professors alike, some of the most common ways thatprofessors use the Web are
remarkably inefficient, yield very little
utility and probably ought to be abandoned.
Consider a course in, say, economics
(that supposed bastion of efficiency)
with
50 students and a normal number of handouts totaling several hundred pages. Assume that students in the class, like most
Swarthmore students, read most handouts
most of the time.
The net-sawy professor establishes a Web
page for the course that contains all of his
handouts, probably thinking thathe will save
Paper, money and effort. On the first day of
class he announces the Web page and tells
the students that it will fully replace handouts

skeptical.
Perhaps, instead, the nickname problem
is a symptom of a larger existential quandary. As Swarthmore students, we do not
wish to be anything; being itself is difficult enough—to predicate it, disastrous.
So I think we should leave this one well
enough alone and move on to getting an
official something else, and that which I
propose is a movie.
We already have a semi-official movie,
"The Graduate," and I think this was a
good call back whenever it happened (especially regarding the whole existential
angst thing). However, in the Jubilee Year,
we should renew ourselves spiritually, and
I would like to propose a new movie, and
we could make this one really official.
I would like to propose the P. T. Anderson film, "Magnolia."
Reasons: First off, nothing happens.
Now, I'm not saying that you can't make a
movie with the point that nothing makes
sense or nothing happens; this movie does
that one quite well. It's as if the idea of
having a theme is too conceptually limiting an idea for a film of such caliber. To
paraphrase the theme from "The Good,
The Bad, and The Ugly," we don't need no
stinking theme.
Now we're going to make a little jump,
so try to keep up. What's even better is
that every critic, with the exception of Mr.
Cranky, loves this movie, and better yet,
loves it for no reason. Read a review; what
you'll find is several paragraphs describing the action before the critic fell asleep
and a couple more talking about the superb acting. The reason? You're literally
not allowed to hate this movie. And though
it's taken me quite a while to get there,
this is why it should be the official movie
of Swarthmore, because it's our fault.
You can't hate this movie because somehow it happened that we erased the distance between the intellectual elite and the
boorish louts.
The idea that high art may be devoid of
meaning has become a redundancy. To be
high art is to be devoid of meaning, and to
be intelligent is to recognize this not as an
error, but as a natural consequence of
modern life. Meaning implies humor. To
try to say something is to be inevitably

and thus certainly, of error. To be correct

FORTHE DEMOCRATS

Give out vouchers Centralize funding

By Ben Schweigert
Phoenix Staff
People across the political spectrum recognize that America's
public schools are failing to provide adequate education. Rampant
illiteracy, high dropout rates, and low test scores are just three
examples of the failure of our school system. The problems with
the American education system will not be solved by tinkering
around the edges, but by a dramatic reworking of the way that
we treat our school system
in the United States.
We have entrusted our
ideals of meritocracy and
equal opportunity to the
public schools. Here, we believe that everyone should
have an equal chance to acquire the skills that they
need to succeed and that
those who work the hardest
can succeed the most. To
ensure the equal provision
of these skills, we have created the public schools. The
rampant inequalities and
failures of our public
schools reveal that this ideal
is far from the reality.
The most severe problem
is funding. Public school
funding comes from local
property taxes that ensure
wealthier areas better-financed schools, despite the
fact that poor areas have, on
average, higher tax rates.

for days, eventually acknowledged that
the city could have contributed to the
problem and helped broker a dealto compensate the residents.
Then, just weeks before Rendell was
to leave office, the city was stunned last
December when a jury ordered the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority to pay $5l million to a boy
whose foot was ripped off at age 4 by a
poorly maintained subway escalator. The
jury found that SEPTA knew the escalator was dangerous at the timeof the 1996
accident but did nothing. Both sides
agreed to settle for $7.4 million earlier
this month, two days after John Street
was inaugurated to replace Rendell.
Yet Rendell, a gifted politician like the
president with whom he reportedly once
played basketball in the office of the
mayor's chief of staff, has managed to
emerge from the crises strong as ever.
Now Democratic National Chairman at
the invitation of that president, Rendell
has ended his eight years in the mayor's
office with stunning approval ratings and
the strong likelihood of a 2002 run for
governor of Pennsylvania. Just as supporters of his gubernatorial bid dismiss
his 1986primary loss to Bob Casey, residents of Philadelphia seem to forget
Rendell's failures as mayor and remember his successes
the successes that
are revitalizing Center City and the historic Independence Mall, the successes
that have turned around the city's image
and scheduled the opposing party's national convention for the Democratic
stronghold, the successes that saw incoming Democratic National Chairman
Edward G. Rendell preside as mayor
over Philadelphia's Year 2000 celebrations with a favorability rating of 87 per-

Rendell addresses Swat audience
DNC Chairman discusses Mumia,
From RENDELL, pg. I I
cent.

Rendell's popularity again
crossed party lines Monday
when the College Republicans
took the unusual step of cosponsoring his visit along with the
College Democrats and the
President's Office. Fresh from
the heat of election-year
fundraising for the Democratic
National Committee and on his
way to teach an afternoon class
at the University of Pennsylvania, Rendell had no time to prepare a speech but instead took 40
minutes of questions
"I'm at
Swarthmore," he noted, "and according to U.S. News and World
Report, I'll get intelligent questions"
on topics ranging from
the city of Philadelphia and the
operation of the DNC to the
Mumia Abu-Jamal case and the
possibility of a run for governor
of Pennsylvania.
In response to a question about
how easy it is for suburban residents to "not connect" with the
city of Philadelphia, Rendell said
he believed that the city and its
suburbs were intimately linked.
"If the city is not doing well," he
said, "its problems will slowly
seep out from the center, and it'll
seep out first to the inner ring
suburbs.... Then it seeps out from
the inner ring suburbs to the
middle ring suburbs, and to keep
avoiding things like crime, people
with means tend to keep moving."
But when the city is doing well,
he said, as he believes Philadelphia is now, the arts and culture,
festivals, sporting events and
restaurants available in the inner
city are very important to the
"quality of life of a suburban
township like Swarthmore."
Culture in Philadelphia flourished under Rendell, who among

gubernatorial hopes

other things helped to create the
Avenue of the Arts on Broad
Street. But the former mayor
unfair, he said
took a beating
from the press for failing to
do as much to improve neighborhoods or the city's schools as he
did for the downtown.
"Don't accept for a moment
that we haven't done anything for
neighborhoods," said Rendell,
who proceeded to list his
administration's accomplishments in improving the quality
of life.

"The historical precedent
goes out the window
when it's white against
black."
Rendell blamed Pennsylvania's
system of financing education
with property taxes for the inequity between inner-city schools
and suburban ones. Philadelphia,
he said, spends $5OOO annually
per student whileLower Merion,
a wealthy township just across
the city line in Montgomery
County, spends $ll,OOO. "Getting
more money for education," he
said, "is tied up in the broader
question of tax reform."
Improving public education
and obtaining additional funding
for it was one of the areas on
whichRendell said newly elected
mayor John Street needed to focus, in addition to maintaining
fiscal stability
"as long as that
is the case everything else is possible"
and continuing to prevent crime and redevelop the
city. Rendell said Street should
stand up to criticism from the
press and citizen's groups and
aggressively offer businesses
incentives to move into the city.
"For all the work we've done cut-

ting the wage and business tax,"
Rendell said, "the imbalancebetween setting up a business in
Philadelphia and setting up a
business in Delaware or Montgomery County or Cherry Hill is
still significant."
But Street is likely to be concerned about the city's business
taxes anyway, since Sam Katz,
his Republican opponent in last
November's mayoral election,
made them a big issue with a proposal for drastic cuts. Rendell
said that race was "an enormous
factor" in why the election results were so close. Street, who
is black, won over Katz, who is
white, by less than 6000 votes
even though Democrats usually
sweep elections in a city in which
they outnumber Republicans
four to one. "The historical precedent goes out the window when
it's white against black," said
Rendell.
Race, activists say, played a
part in the conviction of death
row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal,
who was sentenced to die after
being found guilty in the death
of a police officer. Rendell, a
former district attorney, said he
was so sure Abu-Jamal was
guilty that he questions antideath-penalty activists' use of
the case as an example of a potentially wrongful conviction. Of
the approximately 80 inmates on
Pennsylvania deathrow, Rendell
said, "I would say about 75 of
them have a weaker case
[against them] than Mumia."
"Go find somebody else,"
Rendell said, "or makeit a philosophical argument. Say, "We
don't want a new trialfor Mumia,
but here's a brilliant guy who obviously has potential as a human
being. Don't execute him.' That's
a fair argument."

Innovative 'Imagining Antarctica'
makes local landscapes exotic
By Catherine Osborne
For The Phoenix
Most artistic projects do not take their impetus
from the rejection of a grant proposal. Yet that was
precisely the genesis of Philadelphia photographer
Sandy Sorlien's series "Imagining Antarctica," which
is at once haunting and ironic.
Sorlien, denied the chance to visit Antarctica herself, turned a curse into a blessing and turned her
camera on local landscapes. Fortunate coincidences
abounded: the winter she chose, 1996,featured snowstorms with up to thirty inches at a time and froze
the Delaware River. Her brother Chris, a scientist,
was sent to Antarctica himself. His shipboard e-mails
describing his experiences hang side-by-side with her
gelatin silver prints.
Walking into the List Gallery's exhibition of
Sorlien's work is like entering another world. Bright
lights flood the white walls, hung with frameless,
white-matted photographs featuring stark black-andwhite images. The toy camera Sorlien chose tends to
blur and distort the edges of the prints, making the
sharply focused ice-world at the centers hypnotic and
inescapable. Some images look like nothing so much
as lunar landscapes: the moon-mountains of "Landscape, Rhode Island" and the spore-creatures of
"Blowing Snow, New Jersey," in particular. Others
are paradoxically liquid. In "Snow, New York," the
solid snow ripples and eddies around a black rock at
the center of the frame. A few, stared at for too long,
are actually frightening, as withthe fragmented floes
coursing down a furious dark river in "Ice, Philadelphia." And some, such as the gorgeously sardonic
self-portrait "Polar Explorer, New Jersey" or the exuberant "Penguins, Philadelphia," display a wicked
sense of humor.
Sorlien draws the viewer into her fantasy, allowing us to thrill to the Antarctic crater of her backyard birdbath and squint at the sun on theblack seas
of New Jersey. She calls herself "wishful and voyeuristic;" reading the e-mails from Chris and seeing
our own landscape through Sorlien's lens satisfies our
tendencies in those directions. "Imagining Antarctica" feeds the viewer's inner artist, escaping from
the gray industrialism of the mid-Atlantic to a NeverNever Land of unfettered imagination and limitless
beauty.

Somewhere about two-thirds through "Any Given Sunday," I looked at my watch.
This is one of the worst things that can happen at a
movie you should never be wondering when it's going
to end. That said, I still enjoyed Oliver Stone's latest, a
visually stunning look at America's favorite pastime: the
contact sport that is football. The subject matter is fitting of Stone's style, and the cinematography is dazzling,
almost to the point of overkill. Throw in an excellent
(and enormous) cast, and you've still got a good movie,
but it could have been, should have been, better.
"Any Given Sunday" focuses on the fictional Miami
Sharks, a team whose heyday is long gone, whose coach
is lost in the old glory days, whose players are consumed
with the quest for fame and fortune, whose quarterback
is past his prime, whose owner is money-hungry enough
to move the franchise across the country.
There are no new themes here, but the familiar ones
are poignantly illuminated by superior acting. Al Pacino
gives a standout performance as head coach Tony
D'Amato. He is this coach, wise and ignorant at the same
time. The scenes between Pacino and Jamie Foxx (as
third-string quarterback Willie Beamen) crackle (especially the one where Pacino tries to "connect" withFoxx
by talking about music).
The rest of the casting was equally good: Cameron Diaz
as the knockout owner heiress, Dennis Quaid as aging
quarterback "Cap" Rooney, James Woods and Matthew
Modine as doctors with different attitudes towards lifethreatening conditions.
The simple truth is that there were too many of those
loud, this-is-a-violent-contact-sport scenes, and not
enough character development. Who should see this
movie? Football fans. If you can't watch a game, you
definitely won't be able to sit through theentire 170 minutes of "Any Given Sunday."

Do you want to kill people with a spork? I do.
a spork in my back pocket, or better yet,
in a holster.
I guess the simplest explanation of this
fabulously drawn, black-and-white comic
is that Johnny kills people. Sometimes he
tortures them a bit, down in the cavernous gapings underneath his house, and
uses their blood to paint his walls.
But more important than the gratuitous
violence of JTHM is the humor and bitterness with which Jhonen Vasquez, who
by most accounts strongly resembles his
title character, presents the thought process behind the killings. Johnny may
maim people pretty indiscriminately, but
at the same time he pokes fun of himself
and those who would admire him.
Johnny, who also goes by Nny (pronounced 'knee'), is one tormented wreck
of a guy. He had, at one point, a total of
four voices battling for his psyche. He
has also messed up a relationship with the
only person who has ever made him happy
by trying to kill her.
"Nailbunny?" he says to one of the
voices, which seemingly emanates from
a bunny head nailed to the wall, "I'm not

happy."
My favorite part of the comic, which is
segmented and includes noL omy ;he main

Johnny tale, but also spin-off stories, is
about Anne Gwish, who spends hours applying her black eye make-up and practicing her detached look. She's at a diner
with a friend in one panel, and a bunch of
rednecks are laughing at her. "Hey
Matilda, Halloween is next month," they
say.
"Why am I so tormented?"Anne Gwish
asks. Then in another panel she's among
her black clad friends at her favorite club.
"Oh my God," she sniffs. "I can't believe
he's wearing jeans."
But JTHM is not a lesson about sensitivity and tolerance, as one website dedicated to Vasquez surmised: "Like, some-

times the things you say can really hurt
others' feelings."
No, JTHM is about the hypocrisy of
wanting to be accepted and yet not being
accepting. It's about pretending to be a
hardcore, aloofbadass whenreally, inside,
you are just as vulnerable and just as
starved for attention as everybody else.
I'm sorry. I hate to be preachy and look
for deeper meanings in the book when all
that needs to be said is that this comic is
funny. It made me laugh out loud, which
is another thing I am doing far too little of
nowadays, but it also made me feel that
little pang in my chest that someone once
conned me into thinking was thefirst sign
of a heart attack. If only Jhonen would
come out with more issues. Sigh. Unfortunately, he's moved on to a new comic
called "I Feel Sick."
The first seven issues of "Johnny the
Homicidal Maniac" are available in
graphic novel format. JTHM is published
by Slave Labor Graphics, which the love
o' my life, Mel, and I cut class to visit one
rainy day long ago. It was boring, corporate, with nice polished hardwood floors,
but we wrote our names on the stairwell
because we're rugged like that. Ah, youth.
Teehee.

In June 1966,Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a strong contender for the middleweight

Adapted from E.B.White's childrens' classic, "Stuart Little" uses groundbreaking technology to tell the story of a mouse adopted by the Little family. Somehow, though, the literal
translation into film takes away from the thing that made the book so magical: imagination.

Matt Damon gives an excellent, disturbing performance in one of the year's best thrillers.
The lush, beautiful scenes of Italy in the 1950s contrast sharply with the dark undertones

Oliver Stone's newest drama focuses on America's most beloved (and most lucrative)
pastime: football, a sport that is violent, aggressive, engaging,fast-paced and jarring. It fits
right into his niche of style. You'll be wowed by the good acting and cinematography, but
bring aspirin, because this movie is too loud to be so long.

A chronicle of the search and rescue patrol of a deep space medical ship and its sixmember crew that answers an emergency call and finds itself in danger from the young
man it rescues. "Supernova" was released amid rumors of trouble on the set, and this
feeling is present throughout the film, which often seems to be missing chunks of the plot.

Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson star as welterweight boxers Caesar Dominguez

funny, but fails to land enough punches to get there.

Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie make sparks fly in this film based on the memoirs of
Susanna Kaysen (played by Ryder), who spent time in a mental hospital in 1967. Though
the plot and themes wander, Jolie and Ryder, and the cast of characters who are their
ward mates poignantly illustrate this intriguing and watchable movie.

8:20

Based on Stephen King's best-seller, this is the story of a death row murderer locked
away in a Southern prison. Of course, he's not the monster he appears to be, and that's
the big complication...that and the fact that the guy has the magical power of healing.
The casting and acting are stellar, making "The Green Mile" a must-see.

A humorous spoof of the television series "Star Trek," "Galaxy Quest" pokes fun at the
show and its... urn... devoted fans. Tim Allen's striking resemblance to Willian Shatner

I'm Betting on Over
The Super Bowl is set and we don't even
have to wait an extra week for the game.
In four short days, a new champion will
be crowned. It should be an exciting game
between two worthy competitors...blah
blah blah.
It's one thing to merely watch the game,
but the game takes on a whole new meaning when your entire future depends on
whether your team covers the spread. For
instance, I have yet to forget/live down my
lost bet to my best friend in high school
when Denver upset Green Bay two years
ago. Although I will always be known as
the guy who attended class stark naked
(save the blue and orange face-paint), I am
still in favor of betting on the Super Bowl.
To aid in the competitive nature of this
Sunday's game, I have come up with an
over/under game. Whether you make and
a humiliating bet or just throw some
money down, compete with your friends
as you watch the Super Bowl to see who is
the best at guessing inane statistics. Simply choose either "over" (if you believe
the value will be more than the one given)
or "under" (do I have to explain what 'under' means?) for each of the following categories:
1. Times Steve McNair throws to a WR

Men's basketball falls just short

(2.5)

2. Times Steve McNair throws to a RB/
FB/TE (30.5)
3. TDs thrown by Kurt Warner in the
first quarter (7.5)
4. Total yards gained by MarshallFaulk
(437.5)

5. Times the color commentators refer
to the Titans as a "Team of Destiny" (13.5)
6. Times Jerry Glanville says something
that proves he is the biggest imbecile ever

to be a football analyst (100.5)

7. Times JevonKearse is referred to as
"The Freak" (12.5)
8. Ratio of sacks by The Freak to points
scored by the Titans (2.5)
9. Interviews with Warner in which you
can't concentrate on what he is saying
because you are too distracted by the fact
that he is one of only two human beings
with a flat-top haircut (5.5)
10. Times they show the only other person on earth with a flat-top, Warner's wife,
in the stands (16.5)
11. Times you confuse Warner's mother
(who looks to be about 60) with Warner's
wife (who also looks to be about 60) (16.5)
12. Times the announcers remind you
that both Steve McNair and Eddie George
are bigger than any of the Rams' linebackers (20.5)
13. Times the announcers come up with
idiotic statistics such as, "Teams from the
Midwestwith yellow in their uniform have
a 12-2 record in Super Bowls when their
quarterback has sported a flat-top, but are
an abysmal 1-6 when their quarterback
has the same haircut as his
wife...something's got to give here." (4.5)
14. Rating, from 1-10,of the excitement/
entertainment value of the Super Bowl
(2.5)

15. Rating, from 1-10,of the excitement/
entertainment value of the WWF's Halftime Heat (9.5)
Tiebreaker 1: How many painfully
"clever" signs will you see in the stands
such as last week's favorite, "Kurt
WARNER, please MERGE us A OL touchdown"?
Tiebreaker 2: How many minutes into
the game will it become obvious that the
Titans are in wav over their head?

In a closely-contested game, the Garnet
men's basketball squad fell to a taller, bigger, and more respected team, the Ursinus
Bears (4-1, 11-4), losing 67-63. In what
could have been their most impressive
showing all season, the Swarthmore men's
team (1-4 conference, 2-13 overall) took
the Centennial Conference leaders to the
final seconds before losing.
The Garnet found themselves down 65
to 57 with only 2:04 left on the clock. Soon
afterward, guard Gregg Holtmeier 'OO
nailed a three-pointer to bring the crowd
of about 100 to a frenzy and Swarthmore
to within five points. Ursinus scored again
with a minute left, extending their lead to
seven points. Senior forward and top
rebounder Joseph Culley (8.4 rebounds
per game) answered the call with a quick
basket accompanied by a foul to make the
score 67 62 with 20 seconds remaining.
Culley's sixth free throw of the night made
it a four-point ball game. Tarble Pavilion
exploded as Ursinus guard Luther Owens
stepped out of bounds two seconds after
receiving the inbounds pass and the Garnet gained possession with 18 seconds left.

the Bears grabbed the game's final rebound to run out the last twelve seconds
of the clock.

has not met its opponents with smooth
sailing. Since arriving on campus, the
team has played five contests and has
dropped three. The women faced off
against The Apprentice School and
Farleigh-Dickinson-Madison in non-conference action and against conference
foes Dickinson, Ursinus and Muhlenberg.
The women successfully handled
Dickinson College in their first game back
in league competition. The Tide stormed
into the Red Devil's lair prepared to
handle the heat; the team shot a scorching 74 percent from the floor in the first
half and 57 percent for the game.
In a well-rounded team effort, the hottest hand belonged to Sarah Tufano 'O3,
who went a sizzling eight of nine from the
floor and led the team in scoring with 21
points. She also managed to pull down four
boards and block three shots.
Heather Kile 'O2 pitched in with a modest 18points while tearing down eight rebounds. Outstanding contributions were
also made by Pam Lavallee 'O3, who
chipped in 10points and five boards, and
Heather Marandola 'Ol, who threw in eight
points and four rebounds.
After schooling Dickinson College, the
women met with a lesson of their own
when they faced The Apprentice School.
This squad ofbailers brought their streetstyle game to Tarble Pavilion and gave the
Swat team a training session.
While the Tide did lead for most of the
game, they were not able to stay ahead in
the final minutes. The women eventually
fell to the relentless full-court hounding
and tough-girl style of the Lady Builders.
Swat lost the game by two points in overtime. Foul trouble played a part in the loss,
with three of the team's top three scorers
fouling out of the game.
Kile led the team in scoring and rebounding with 32 points and 16rebounds.
Kile also dished out three assists and had
four blocks. Tufano added 10 points and
six rebounds, and Katie Tarr 'O2 chipped
in 11 points and four rebounds.
The Garnet fell to Farleigh-DickinsonMadison 77-67 the following Monday. Despite another valiant effort by Kile, who

rebounds, the Tide was plagued by poor
shooting and unforced turnovers. Collectively, the squad was 0-15 from downtown
and gave up 19 turnovers. Marandola
added 11 points to the effort and Tufano
nine.
The team posted its second win in a
double-overtime'thriller against Ursinus.
It was the first time the Lady Tide have
beaten Ursinus on their home court. The
exhausting attack was led by Kile, who put
in an amazing 35 points and pulled down
an incredible 20 rebounds.
Not only did she post these unbelievable
numbers, but she also contributed key
baskets in the final seconds of both the
regulation period and the first overtime,
keeping the Garnet alive. In addition to
Kile's stellar attack, a total team effort,
including great support from the bench,
left the Ursinus women dumbfoundedand
teary-eyed. Tufano contributed 12 points
and eight rebounds, and Lavallee and
Kristen English 'Ol added 13 points and
nine points, respectively.
The game was a great win for the
women, and kept them on top of the Centennial Conference East with a 4-0 division record. But the women faced rocky
roads after the win and did not fare well
against Allentown last Saturday.
The Garnet Tide fell and fell hard to
Muhlenberg College 61-34. In the process,
the women lost Centennial Conference
bragging rights. The Mules set the tone
with aggressive play from the start and
the Garnet offense was unable to adjust.
An embarrassed squad of players
jogged to the locker room at halftimeafter only having managed to connect on
one first half basket and several foul
shots. Halftime amendments to the starting lineup could not turn the tide of the
game.
Kile's January assault on Swat opponents has not gone unnoticed by Centennial Conference coaches and administration. Kile was named Centennial Conference Player of the Week for the week of
Jan. 17thand Conference Co-Playerof the
Week for the week of Jan. 24th. Although
honored by these mid-season conference
accolades, Kile is not satisfied. She has her
eye on second semester Garnet success,
which is measured solely in the win column.
"Until we get that job done, none of this
really matters," Kile remarked.

If several frog ads in last year's game
weren't enough to show Bud can afford
many of the zillion dollar ads, enough to
have a solid Bud Bowl, then the mere fact
that Penn State is still standing should attest to Bud's financial solvency. So let's be
honest and assess some marketing facts
of which Budweiser should be aware.
First, Budweiser is a vile tasting beverage that most closely resembles gasoline.
It is mostly consumed by young, lower
income males, who are also known as college students. This is a competitive market for Budweiser, as they face significant
challenges from Beast, Beast Lite and
Robitussin pirated from Worth.
Who likes the damned frogs more than
Bud Bowl? Well, my mom does. The
chances of seeing her crack open a fresh
Bud are about the same as Cecil Fielder
winning an Olympic gold medal in figure
skating. The frogs might have had enough
merit to impress middle-aged women rating Super Bowl commercials for newspapers like USA Today, which frankly is
made by baboons with lots of colorful
graphics for baboons, but it did not sell

beer.
I really would much rather have seen
some women degraded than the chirping
animals. Maybe a dramatized portrayal of
a supermodel or porn star finding me sexy
because I drink sweet, sweet Beechwoodaged Budweiser. Or perhaps that great hit
where Eagles two way legend Chuck
Bednarik hits Frank Gifford and knocks
him out for the next two seasons. Bud
should have come up with something that
appeals to the guy sitting on his couch with
his boys and his hand in his pants pounding the cheapest beer he can find. In any
case, anything but the damn toads.
That said, we need Bud Bowl back
where it belongs: in the $2 million slots.
As advertising, as long as Bud Bowl has
good writers, it can never be antiquated.
After all it is football, a game of infinite
scenarios and personalities. Each play is
a story within a story. Most importantly,
Bud Bowl embodied the truest sense of
ardent gridiron observers: Bud Bowl understood that football is about your bros,
some cold brews and a lot of hard-hitting
action.

Swat indoor track starts
off season on right foot
By Marc Jeuland
For The Phoenix
Unlike other teams thatreturned from
winter break early for training, the indoor
track and field teams settled for a small,
fairly relaxed home meet to begin the new
semester. The scene of the competition on
Saturday was the Swarthmore field house;
appropriately, student supporters turned
out in good numbers to cheer on their fellow peers and friends at the Swarthmore
Invitational. However, the reduced pressure of a small field did not prevent many
Swat runners, jumpers, and throwers
from performing brilliantly.
There were the traditional stars, whose
names have become known across campus for their numerous accomplishments
Keith Gilmore 'Ol, Joko Agunloye 'Ol,
Desiree Peterkin 'OO, Sarah Jay 'Ol, Imo
Akpan 'O2, Jeff Doyon 'OO, Raylene Ross
'OO, Marc Jeuland'Ol and Karen Lloyd 'OO.
As expected, all of these individuals
placed among the top two in theirrespective events. However, the real successes
of the weekend came from freshmen participating in college races for the first or
second time. These freshmen will undoubtedly continue to improve and make
an invaluable contributionto the team for
years to come.
Kwaku Ntoso's run in the 400 meters
-

earned him a second place finish behind
one of the top long sprinters in the conference, Yuri Adegunwa from Ursinus.
Ntoso ran with a fluid stride that impressed spectators and teammates.
Petar Lazarevic 'O3 finished in third in
the same race. Matt Steele 'O3 andAbram
Lipman 'O3 powered their bodies to second and third place finishes in the 55
meter dash. Sophia Accord 'O3 showed her
potential in the jumps, tying for third in a
competitive long jump group and taking
second in the high jump. Katie Cloonan
'O3 turned in a fifth place finish in the grueling 800 meter run, and Sanjay Richards
'O3 ran a solid time to finish ninth in the
same men's race.
The continued development of the veteran and freshmen talent will be vital to
the success of the team this season. Every performance counts, because the team
is significantly smaller than it has been
in past years.
In this group, though, talent is not lacking and hard work is contagious. Some
classes may have been canceled on Tuesday, but the track captains still held practice in the afternoon. With luck, the small
successes achieved thus far will turn into
greater ones.
This weekend the team will travel to
Wesleyan in Connecticut to compete Friday night,

Bears to 25.9 percent shooting in the
half and 32.4 percent for the game.
Ursinus' two leading scorers, freshman
star Dan Luciano and all-conference
forward Richard Barrett, were held to
a combined 8 of 26 shooting. A great
defensive effort by the Tide caused
Barrett, who averages 16.8points per
game, to miss ten shots. Swarthmore
also kept Barrett (9.2 rpg) off of the
boards, holding him to five rebounds.
For Swarthmore, Culley finished with
18 points, 16rebounds and five assists,
while sophomore forward Kyle Lewis
finished with 16 points and seven
boards.
The Tide opened the game weakly,
falling behind 22-6 after eight minutes had elapsed. Then they rallied
with a 10-2 run, due in great part to
freshman guard David Pearce's five
points. With the game at 24-16, Ursinus
began to build a steady lead and entered half time up 11 points. The Garnet opened the second halfby chipping
away at the Bears' lead until closing to

hustle made the score 56 to 50 with

be just enough to hold off the Garnet

Tide.
After losing to the other leaders of
the Eastern Division of the Centennial
Conference, theMuhlenburg Mules (4~
1, 10-5), the Garnet dropped to 2-13
overall, 1-4 in the conference.
Muhlenburg came out hot, making over
70 percent of their shots from the field,
and took a commanding43-24 lead. The
eventual 85-58 loss was Swarthmore's
tenth in a row. Holtmeier led the Tide

with 13points.
The Swarthmore Garnet Tide hope
to end their skid with a win over their
archrivals, the Haverford Fords (1-4,
2-7) in a game played last night at
Haverford. The results were not available at presstime. Following the
Haverford game, the Garnet will play
at home against Gettysburg (2-3, 9-7)
on Jan. 29 at 7:30 p.m. The Garnet will
also travel to thePalestra on theUPenn
campus for a rematch with Ursinus on
Feb. 12. The GarnetTide will close out
the regular season against Haverford
at Swarthmore on Feb. 19.

Swim team dives headfirst into league competition
By Becca Howes-Mischel

Phoenix Staff

The swim team faced off against two
teams last week, with both the
men and the women prevailing against
Drew but losing to Johns Hopkins.
With tired musclesand sore bodiesfrom
the team's training trip, the period after
winter break is one of the most challenging portions of the season. Despite their
weariness, the swimmers have maintained their intensity and performed well.
The men's team has dwindled to nine
members, but each athlete has been putting it all on the line and really stepping
up against their opponents. While they fell
137-61 against Hopkins last Wednesday,
there were several standout individual
performances. Unfortunately, the women
ended their undefeated streak when they
fell 121-83 to Hopkins. Although this was
their first defeat, the female swimmers
went into the meet not expecting to better Hopkins' superior depth. However, the
Swat women swam so well that at the first
break, the Hopkins team had a frightened
meeting to discuss their meet strategy.
As Swarthmore's coach Lee Bowers
commented, "We're in the perfect place,
we have nothing to lose, all we can do is
swim fast against them." But despite a
concerted effort on Swat's part, Hopkins
prevailed.
On Saturday against Drew, the swim
team faced a different ending. This time
the men won 115-81 and the women's team
won 143-56. On both sides of the pool,
Swarthmore swimmers picked up a win
in every individual event.
"[Drew is] not a bad team, they're good,
but you made them look terrible," commented coach Sue Davis after the meet.
After the losses against Hopkins, it was
great forboth teams to swimfast and win.
The women's record now stands at 7-1 and
the men are 5-3.
Although not always the swimmers to
touchthe wall first, many swimmers have
had amazing swims in the last week. With
conferences lurking three and a half
weeks away, it is great to finally have the

difficult

team's race strategy all come together.
On the men's side, David Whitehead 'O3
has come from behind in a seriesof closely
decided races to pull off some incredible
wins. Against Hopkins in both the 100meter freestyle and the 200 freestyle, he
got to the wall first by a mere few hundredths of a second for two wins. He has
consistently dominated the freestyle
events for Swarthmore. Senior Brent
Wasser has also proven his dominance in
the 200 backstroke, dropping precious
seconds from his time as he nears the conclusion of his college career. He touched
second against Hopkins but first against
Drew. Freshmen Mike Dudley is another
male swimmer to prove his importance in
the pool. In both the backstroke and
breaststroke events he has consistently
given Swat a desperately needed edge.
On the women's side, it is the distance
swimmers who stand out every meet for
their perseverance and physical toughness. Mari McCrann 'OO and Emily Marks
'O3 have swum the dreaded double-header
of the 1000 and 500 freestyle in almost
every meet. Against Hopkins they both
had their best times of the season in the
100 by a couple seconds.LauraFox 'O3 has
also distinguished herself in the last two
meets in the 200 breaststroke for her ability to pull off a tough finish, improving
her places as well as time. In the last two
meets, Fox has reached down and come
up with career bests in races decided in
the last ten yards of the pool. Finally, the
Swarthmore 400 medley relay team of
Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol, Natalie Briones
'O3, Alice Bonarou 'O2, and Claire Arbour
'OO or Davita Burkhead-Weiner 'O3 has
consistently left every other team in the
dust. They are currently undefeatedand
hold the top time in the conference.
The team has four more dual meets left
in the season, the next two of which are
home meets at the Ware pool on Jan. 26 at
5:30 p.m. and Jan. 29 at 2 p.m. On Jan. 29,
the team faces Gettysburg, which currently holds thebest record in the conference. That should be an interesting meet;
the Garnet Tide having the potential to
pull off a big upset.

Next semester,

abroad, the Swarthmore wrestling team

was crushed in their first Centennial Conference quadrangular meet on Saturday.
Swarthmore lost 39-18 to Muhlenberg, 549 to Johns Hopkins and 54-6 to Gettysburg.
Dan Jacobs 'O3 and Ted Chan 'O2 were
the only members of the team to win bouts
on the day. Jacobs pinned Gettysburg's
Chris Clemente in 2:30 and Muhlenberg's
Jed Wulfekotte in 2:40. His record is currently 8-2 with five pins. Chan knocked
off highly-regarded Jose Gonzalez from
John Hopkins by an 11-5 score, improving his record to 7-3 with four pins.
Other than that, the rest of
Swarthmore's points were scored by forfeits. It was a disappointing day for the
Garnet, whose record fell to 3-4 overall
and 0-3 in the Centennial Conference.
"We knew that we were at a serious dis-

advantage because of the forfeits against
those teams, but we didn't even give ourselves a chance," said Les Fox 'O2.
The wrestling squad has been decimated by the loss of 197 Keith
McManimen 'O2, HVY Justin Pagliei 'O2
and 157 Mike Evans 'O2, who are abroad
this semester. In addition, 141 Will Williams 'O2 and 157 Ben Gaines 'Ol have left
the team for personal reasons, leaving two
many holes for Swarthmore to fill.
"We have to set our goals towards the
conference championships," head coach
Ron Tirpak told the team at practice one
day. "If those of us who are in the room
every day push one another hard enough,
you can push one another to a conference
title."
Swarthmore will be hoping for better
individual performances when they
square off against Western Maryland,
Ursinus and Washington & Lee in a second Centennial Conference quadrangular
meet on Saturday.

Coming off the first snowstorm of the season just five days earlier and a subsequent
dusting of snow Sunday, the Swarthmore campus endured another, harsher snowfall
Tuesday, prompting Vice President for Facilities and Services Larry Schall to officially close the school for non-essential employees.
Tuesday's storm, the worst the Philadelphia area has seen since a blizzard three
years ago covered the region with three feet of snow, seemed to take the college community by surprise.
At around 7 a.m. Tuesday, residentialadvisors received a broadcast voice mail message from Associate Dean of the College for Student Life Tedd Goundie, informing
them that the college was officially closed for the day, but that the decision to cancel
classes rested with professors.
Not all R.A.'s passed on the message to their hallmates, however.
Ellie Jamison, Public Safety communications supervisor, manned the phone in Ben
West Tuesday morning. At shortly after 9 a.m., she juggled emergency calls and a
barrage of snow-related inquiries, telling the latter callers that the only official word
she had was that chemistry professor Robert Pasternack had cancelled his classes.
Meanwhile, in the Registrar's Office, a cardboard sign suspended from the ceiling
notified visitors that classes were in session for the day. It instructed students to go to
their classroom to see if class would be held.
"It would be really convenient if there were something like a web site," said Registrar Martin Warner, who greeted students in his office at 9:30 a.m. "But that's probably
not right around the corner."
Throughout the day, students, bundled up inparkas, scarves, and hoods, braved freezing rain and gusts of wind that at times swirled snow fiercely in the air.
Some, though, seemed to have a better time thanothers.
At 9:50 a.m., Jonah Eaton 'O2 donned skis in front of Willets in preparation to go
cross-country skiing. He slept through his 8:30 class, he said, and had yet to decide
whether he would attend his other two later in the day.
In the afternoon, roommates Keith Bentrup 'Ol and Mike Duffy 'Ol worked to complete a circular snowfort on theFaulker tennis courts that they had started last Thursday On the courts since since 10 a.m., with a break for lunch, they used recycling bins
from their hall to pack "bricks" of snow, which they cut using hanger wire.
Last Thursday, the fort was two to two and a half feet high, they said; by 2 p.m.
Tuesday, it was nearly six feet.
The storm, which struck a large portion of the Northeast, blanketed the Philadelphia area with 10 to 15 inches of snow, the NationalWeather Service reported Tuesday.
As some staff members scrambled to clear pathways across campus Tuesday
with shovels, electric snowblowers, and tractors
others tried to perform their normal duties as best they could.
Sharpies Dining Hall opened for breakfast, lunch and dinner. According to Linda
McDougall, director of dining services, a number ofSharpies employees did not come
in. She said dining services managers helped as they could, other employees stayed
later and three students at nearby Strath Haven and Ridley High Schools, who usually
work in the dining hall after school and on weekends, came in.
Essie Mae's snack bar, which only had half of its staff of six, offered limited food
service for breakfast and lunch, but closed for dinner. The Kohlberg coffee bar remained closed all day, as did the bookstore.
The snow halted both Tri-College and campus shuttle serviceall day Tuesday. SEPTA
service also suffered delays, and at least one R3 train was canceled.
