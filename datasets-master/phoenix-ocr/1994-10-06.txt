New Organization Presents Alternate Voice in Free Speech Debate
Two Students Found Campus Chapter of the Nationwide First Amendment Coalition
By Lisa Hibler
A campus chapter of the First Amendment
Coalition (FAC) is being founded by Vijay
Toke '96 and Geoffrey Cline '96. According to
a brochure, this national organization is an
"association of professors, studentsand alumni
dedicated to upholding and preserving the First
Amendment."
The formation of this organization stems
from a growing concern over academic policies
and practices which infringe upon First Amendment rights. These include censorship of student publications, politically correct student
speech codes, and an allegedly politicized cur-

riculum.

The organization was founded by a group of
students, alumni and faculty at the University
of Florida in Gainesville. They hoped to build
a national network of collegiate societies committed to preserving First Amendmentrights in
the Academy. Last December, when the organization was still new, Toke and Cline met
Dave Gentry, a student member of thecoalition
who informed them of the organization's objectives and encouraged them to begin a chapter at Swarthmore.
At the time, both were involved with the

Young America's Foundation, a groupbased in
Herndon, Virginia which sponsors collegiate
conservatism. They were also invited to participate in a "First Amendment and Western
Tradition" conference at Harvard in April in
which people of all ideologies on the political
spectrum would "rally behind theFirst Amendment." Specifically, they sought to speak out
against thedemandfor politically correct speech
and conduct codes, mandatory sensitivity training, one-sided curricula and so-on, all of which
were seen as violations of First Amendment
rights. This opposition was formalized in the
Cambridge Declaration, which was signed by
the conference's participating members.
As a result of this conference, the Coalition
received recognition and increased support.
Membership has grown and a larger conference
will be held at Columbia University later this
month on October 28 and 29. The title of the
conference is "Censorship on Campus" and the
sponsors include the Young America's Foundation, Madison Center and the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute.
Guest speakers at the conference include
author Jim Sleeper, bestselling author David
Horowitz, President of the Individual Rights
Foundation John Howard, author Nat Hentoff,

and R. Emmett Tyrrell, editor of the American
Spectator. The Columbia conference is designed to "bring together hundreds ofstudents,
scholars and activists involved in the movement for intellectual freedom." The movement
protests intolerancewithin academia of "ideas,
speech and views which do not conform to
current political orthodoxies."
As far as the activites of theFAC on campus
are concerned, Toke and Cline would like the
organization to be "bipartisan; in fact, apolitical in that the issues we will address are not

conservative or liberal, but American." They
would like to sponsor debates and co-sponsor
events involving diverse and possibly dissenting speakers.
Toke andCline welcome suggestions of what
can be done on campus "to make people more
active as well as more aware of their First
Amendment rights," and invite anyone interested in attending the conferences and working
to get speakers on campus to contact them.
Meeting times for the group will be posted in
the near future.

Socialist Political

This year marks the third anniversary ofThe
Civil Liberties Society (CLS) at Swarthmore.
Created to promote respect for privacy, due
process, equal treatment, and theFirst Amendment, CLS has sponsored three campaigns and
two social action undertakings so far this se-

The Socialist Political Action Collective
(SPAC) is an umbrella group of the political
Left at Swarthmore. It actively opposes structural inequalities and social injustices at the
local, regional, national, and international levels. SPAC members meet in a bi-weekly, democratic forum to coordinate theactions of several
sub-groups.
In general, SPAC organizes forms of collective action that empower communities, rather
than offering only temporary assistance. SPAC

A march in Philadelphia last Saturday concluded the group's one-week campaign against
capital punishment (see article on page 3).
With last week's opinion piece by Abby
Swingen '97, on Pennsylvania's rape laws,
CLS began a month of activities in support of
women's rights. The group ran a letter-writing
tableto express opposition to the state's current
definitionof rape, which requires evidence of
physical resistance on the part of the victim.
After October break, the campaign will continue with a focus on young women's rights and
domestic abuse. The chief of Swarthmore Police and the district attorney for Delaware
County will be here on October 19, in order to
discuss the reporting and prosecuting of incidents of rape.
A CLS committee is currently reviewing
civil liberties issues on campus. These areas
may include technological privacy, the judicial
system, and aspects of the new alcohol policy.
The club has also addressed more immediate
issues. When Matt Schenk '95 arranged a referendum on the flying of the American flag,
CLS offered an alternative. In asking if the

encourage deep consideration of the meaning
of the two symbols, and the values of this
country. CLS also marked National Banned
Books Week by bringing noted civil libertarian
Burton Caine to speak in the College Bookstore
on Wednesday.
In the months ahead, the club hopes to address issues of students' rights, immigration
rights, and gay and lesbian rights. All students
interested in CLS are invited to contact Kevin

events as they are announced to the college

College Republicans
By Laura Smid

The College Republicans organization, created last Spring semester, provides an informa-

tion network and coordinates efforts related to
elections. It is currently active in preparing for
the election which is one month away. It has a
membership of approximately 25 students.
Justin Herring '97, leader ofCollege Republicans, points out that the College Republicans
are not synonymous with the S warthmore Conservative Union. In fact. Herring and other
Republican students created the College Republicans because they felt that while the Conservative Union's views are similarto those of
the Republican party, it was not inherently
Republican in nature. In addition, it was not
designed to be involved in campaigning. On a

campus with ample opportunities for liberal
activism, the College Republicans plan to provide conservative students with a chance to
become more involved in politics.
The Republican organization was formed
primarily through word of mouth. Herring re-

marks that at S warthmore College "there aren't
that many Republicans and everyone pretty
much knows who they are."
The College Republicans have no rigid hierarchy and a small budget, which is used mostly
for transportation and receptions. Members

foster dependency and attempt to mask the
chronic failures of the capitalist political
economy. It also seeks to organize campuswide political activities and provide educational resources for the Swarthmore campus on
Leftist issues outside of the Democratic and
Republican mainstream.
Because SPAC is a Collective, it lacks a

By Kevin

Keenan
On Saturday, October f 22
Swarthmore students attended the
"Stand Against the Death Penally"
march from the Holocaust Memorial to the Liberty Bell in PhiUy..
The event marked the culmination of theCivil Liberties Society' s
anti-death penalty campaign, which
included two movies, two speakers, a debate, and a letter-writing
table in Parrish Parlors, "I think we
opened some minds," says JenLee
'9B who coordinated the trip to the
march, "plus, we provided factual
background for people already inclined against capital punishment."
The students were noticable
among the 200 to 300 people at the
march. "We placed about 250 posters atDeath in frontofCity Hall,"
says Amita Sudhir '9B. "We also
came up with our own chants, and
someone handed Kevin [Keenan
'9s} and Jen(Lee] a bullhorn "They
had a banner saying "Students for
Abolition" and chanted, "Racist,

During the march, the protesters
dropped off hundreds of"Declarations of Life" at the District
Attorney's office. These signed
statements called for an abolition
of the death penalty, even in the
event of a crime committed against
the person signing, or his or her

Mortgaging the Quaker Heritage

A strange meeting of frumpy idealism and campaign mentality occurred
Monday night in the Performing Arts Center; Michael Dukakis straddled the
ivory tower and the corporate world and somehowmade them connect. Or did
he? He spoke of egalitarian social programs in Swattie rhetoric the
knowledge of someone who had been in the poltical
jungle. While students could discuss and debate with
him one on one, the corporate gorilla reared its ugly
head in the pomp and circumstance surrounding the
return of"collection."
Swarthmore seems to be having a mid-life crisis;
theadministration wistfullly hearkens back to the days
of vigorous Quakerism, yet, at the same time, it must
embrace the corporate mentality in order to secure
fiscal solidarity. As Swarthmore nears the turn of a
new millennium, it has to ensure need blind admissions, competitive salaries, and student support systems to stay competitive. But in attempting to attract this funding—by
insisting thatthePAC be labeledwith an L for Eugene Lang's ego, by stuffing
fortune cookies with pitches for the phoneathon, by flying President Bloom
to Japan, by pillaging north campus for glittery new building (including
cappuccino maker), we must ask whether Swarthmore has prostituted its
"unique" Quaker lineage to the corporate world for a little security.
As students, we all like to think that our campus is impervious to the
wheeling and dealing of big institutional politics. Yet with tilekick-off of a
new phoneathon campaign, grumbling over US. Newsrankings, and hiring of
a new public relations director—students are getting a peek behind the wizard
of Swat's curtain to see what sort of fiscal gymnastics make our Utopia

possible. Can there be too much fund-raising and public relation work? Wha
happens when we try too hard to "pitch" thephantoms of our quaker founder
to the public arena?
For one, we end up with empty rituals. Does itmake sense to call campus
lectures "collection" when thepeople gathered are not, as
Quakers, sharing in a largerspirit. I donot speak ill ofmy
schoolmates; however, I do not want to delude myse]
with theidea thatby gathering in a large room to listen to
someone speak about egalitarian social programs that
am automatically going to feel closer to members of the
community. Collection implies a deep spiritual connec
tion shared in a public dialogue; on Monday there were
no pregnant silences, and with exception of an inspire
resident of the borough of Swarthmore rushing up to the
stage, the question period was not unique from any othe
department speaker engagement.
We also do an injustice to theQuaker religion by glossing our own meaninj
of rituals such as collection for tour guide talks or endowment drives. Is i
really honest to dredge up Quaker terminology for the purpose of making us
feel special and close, for attracting bright students, funding, or for that matter
public attention?
I believe that the Swarthmore community is unique in its commitment to
academic excellence and respect of the individual; but I feel uneasy when the
likes ofEdward Parrish are invoked for events andpurposes that seem to have
only a surface-level connection to Quakerism.

Why are so many people disillusioned by American politics? Why
do we have difficulty finding inspiring leaders to disrupt the apathy and
restore our faith in democracy? Careful observation of our politicians indicates that much of this problem is
deeply embedded in our our political

We are so serious. And we will
stay that way. Because that's the

way we like it.
And so I'm very relieved that any
traditions thatmight disrupt our diligence, studiousness, and assiduity
have been discontinued. Not that I
might know of any such traditions.
And if I did, I wouldn't tell you
about them. Because that, undoubtedly, wouldbe excruciatingly frivolous, and a waste of my time and
yours.
And we wouldn't want to waste
time.
But it's too late, I've piqued your
interest. And ifI don't willingly tell
you, you'll pester and bother me
until I can't eat or sleep or kill the
fruit flies hovering around my refrigerator either. So OK. Let's get it

Two Views of the Dukakis Visit
Ease Up, Duke: You're Off the Campaign Trail

life expectancies which would be
low for a Third World country, do
not present a differentkind of strain
on a health care system than anything that is faced by Hawaii.
Nor is Dukakis the only example
of a politician who can never stop
campaigning. I had the opportunity
to observe Mario Cuomo in a similarly non-political environment over
the summer, and I saw allof the same
political tactics at work, apparently
embedded within his personality.
The problem with these qualities,
which are very useful during a campaign and when specifically trying to
maintain popularity, is that they are

detrimental in many other situations.
When these people win their elections and finally arrive in situations
where leadership and decisive action are required, they appearunable
to perform. Thus we see an endless
progression of Senators and Representatives, mayors, governors, and
presidents, all of whom seem unable
to take decisive action, to have a
principle and a goal and to fight for
them. Instead they watch the polls
and avoid the tough questions, apparently forgetting the higher purposes which initially brought them
into public service.

A Happy Reunion of
College and Alum
Both Parties Benefitted From the Visit

by Paul Krause

Monday celebrated a reunion between two old friends.

Swarthmore, hungry for connection to its tradition-rich past—witness attempts to revive both the
Hamburg show and theregular Collection—welcomed back its (arguably) most famous alum.
And Michael Dukakis' 55, about
whom the Philadelphia Inquirer
wrote during the 1992 election
"Dukakis Who?", arrived on campusfor three well-attended lectures
with admiring students. Mr.
Dukakis talked easily toresponsive
students throughout the day on topics ranging from the international
economy to his Swarthmore physics classes.
In retrospect, "A Day with
Michael Dukakis"—it seemed more
like "Michael Dukakis Day"—reenergized a man and a community
by uniting them together.
Dukakis appeared a man happy to
return to a place that recognized,
even honored him. Unlike Florida
supermarkets, where he is mistaken
for Paul Tsongas—a man who didn't
even make it to the Democratic convention—Dukakis is lionized here
at Swarthmore. He welcomed that,
delighted in our recognition and admiration.
On the other hand, Swarthmore
students like to be reminded of the
success of our alumni. We like to
hear about graduates with the initiative, the ambition, and the desire
that lead to success. We need that

reassurance: the night after Dukakis
spoke, the main talk on campus was
titled"WhereHave all the Good Jobs
Gone?"
And despite how the national media dismisses Dukakis as a man
whose time has come and gone, it
was refreshing and enlightening to
see a man who was comfortable in
his new academic life as he was with
his political one. In his evening talk
about health care, he talked
knowledgably about all the places
where he has recently taught and
educated himself on health care.
He defended the Hawaiian singlepayer system, which he claims to
have actively supported beforeCongress, as a model of simplicity and
could be applicable nationally. Just
because the plan was Hawiian did
not mean it could not work elsewhere. Hawaii provided health care
by directly addressing issues that
health providers in all states have
been grappling with. Moreover,
Hawaii's high cost of living should
have made implementing the universal coverage more difficult, not
less so.
Dukakis' continued involvement
and insight to relevant national issues is a motivator to students, especially those who went to the following night's economics lecture. And
if Dukakis is a littleirritated by being
mistaken for a less successful New
England politican, then the warm
welcomehere at Swarthmore should
have been satisfying.
A good note on which to enter

Say No to Speech Codes

Let the Circus Begin
By Lindsay Koval

In this entire country, there are
if any, people who have not
heard about the OJ. Simpson case.
The Simpson saga has consumed all
major forums of media—television,
radio, newspaper. New categories of
small talk have emerged thanks to
O.J. and his fellow courtroom cast
members. For example, "So, tell me,
do you thinkthe Juice is guilty?" has
become a common icebreaker and
pick up line. All sorts of Simpsonisms, as well as reports about the
impending trial,
have invaded our
commonparlance
andshow no signs
of disappearing.
The entire situationhas become a
breeding ground
for all kinds of

L.A. citizens praying for once that

in a case where the pretrial hearings
gathered crowds worthy ol
Woodstock (the first one and the second one, combined), scores of thousands of people would be champing
at the bit to get into Judge Lance Ito's
court room and see the drama firs

The O.J. Simpson trial is the Judgment Day paradigm of our time.The

controversies,

ranging from the
question of a fair
trial, to the admissibility of DNA
evidence, to the
prevalence of
spousal abuse. So
let us focus here
on the first controversy: can O.J.
Simpson get a fair trial?
Amidst all the debate over the potential for bias in the Simpson trial,
jury selection experts and members
of the legal profession have been
stressing the principle that an ideal
jury member is not necessarily the
one who has heard nothing of the
case, but rather the one who has not
yet formed opinions about it Such
logic abides by the Constitution but
perhaps ignores the basic human desire to hear the latest gossip—wouldn'tyou lie about your opinions

instant that you are not a conscientious person who fears charges of
perjury and contempt of court. Even
for an ethical citizen, such lying
shouldnot seem unethical, but rather
seem the route to a real chance at

tantamount to the

perhaps this is
gross hyperbole)
their decision, either way, will bring
about monumentalconsequences.So
it is potentially false to assume that
people would volunteer to be Atlases
of sorts, and hold O.J. Simpson's
world in their hands. At the same
time, consider the financial opportunities that being a juror holds: once
released, the juror will certainly be
offered huge sums by "Hard Copy,'
tabloids, and the like, to tell what i
was really like in heated moments ol
decision... The possibilities are limitless!
For the sake of brevity, I will enc
my speculation and rhetorical runaround here. Just consider one mere
point, throughout the countless hours
of the Simpson saga that are about to
be incurred: is there such a thing as a
fair trial, or are we more interested in
the fairest trial possible in a sea ol
injustices, tabloid wars, and all-out

making a difference in the criminal
justice system. I ask you, do you not

with the world beyond as well. It follows that the university must do everything possible to ensure within it
the fullest degree of intellectual freedom.The history ofintellectual growth
and discovery clearly demonstrates
the need for unfettered freedom, the
right to think the unthinkable, discuss
the unmentionable, and challenge the
unchallengable. To curtail free expression strikes twice at intellectual freedom, for whoever deprives another of
the right to state unpopular views necessarily also deprives others of the

We value freedom of expression precisely because it provides a forum for
the new, the provocative, the disturbing, and the unorthodox. Free speech
is a barrier to the tyranny of authoritarian or even majority opinion as to the
rightness or wrongness of particular
doctrines or thoughts....
If freedom of expression is to serve

in a university for civility and mutual
respect to be supersededby the need to
guarantee free expression. The values
superseded are nevertheless important, and every member of the university community should consider them

in exercising the fundamental right to
free expression....
The conclusions we draw against
speech code, then, are these: even when
some members of the university community fail to meet their social and
ethical responsibilities, the paramount
obligation of the university is to protect their right to free expression. This
obligation can and shouldbe enforced
by appropriate formal sanctions.If the
university's overriding commitment to
free expression is to be sustained, secondary social and ethicalresponsibilities must be left to the informal processes of suasion, example, and argument.

You are what you eat:
Sharples'

Alternative Swarthmore cuis ne

Story
By Julia Kernochan
Swatties, under the duress of a strict meal

plan, spend months of accumulated time in
Sharpies, both waiting for and consuming food
(about 9.5 hours a week and 304 hours a year).

Have you ever thought about the implications of
that? They are fascinating. If "you are what you
eat," as the saying goes, those implications
might even be worrisome. No one expects institutional food to be gourmet. But some interesting questions can be raised: what exactly am I
eating? How many times have I eaten this
before? Will I live to eat it again?
So I went in search of the answers to these
and other great mysteries of life. I found the
answers I was looking for in Susan Bell, the
manager of Sharpies. Here in this article I pass
on the wisdom I have learned to help you solve
your own culinary identity crisis, plus thrilling
Sharpies trivia to amaze your friends with.
Swatties terrified of waste will be glad to
know that the dining hall is quite conscientious
about reusing food. Those terrified of reused
food will be glad to know that it only happens
once. Leftover meats are incorporated into a
dish which uses the same spices, for example,
the taco bar meat will be converted to meat pies.
Vegetables go into soup, all of which is homemade. Unfortunately, firench fries and other
starches must be thrown away.
Anything which is uneaten at the end of the
week is given to a Chester homeless shelter
called City Team, where the food presumably
undergoes further metamorphoses. Sadly
desserts are thrown away unless it's close to
Friday, so do your part for the earth and eat up!

every day, and 50 dozen on weekend mornings.
When those are devoured (as often happens),
latecomers are stuck with the Sara Lee frozen
variety. So all you connoisseurs should make
sure to get there early to get the real thing.
Those charming and innovative vegetable
statues which grace countertops are a source of
raging controversy. While some think them a

waste of food, others support the use of produce
in art. Despite moral difficulties, they do offer

endless possibilities for playtime while in line.

Freud and Jung, then initiate a discussion.
For concerned individuals, Susan the manager of Sharpies, would welcome your suggestions
for ice cream flavors. However, the selection is
somewhat limited, and it’s already been estab-

lished that peppermint is not an option.
Sharpies, though constantly maligned, is an
establishment making the best of a difficult situation. In trying to please some students, they
inevitably disappoint others. Suggestions are
gladly received, but should be made respectfully. After all you’re stuck eating there for the

for sure, that I
can not eat another salad. So day after day, I resign myself to cereal and bread—fast, safe, and as stimulating as a textbook at 3:00 AM.
It was not long before it occurred to me that I was in serious need of some creative dining strategies.
My first clue was the fact that every time I sat down with my friends whatever was on their trays
seemed infinitely more appetizing than my own platter of eats. Was there another room in Sharpies
that I wasn't not aware of?
Turns out that these connoisseurs are simply more resourceful and adventurous than I. They have
learned to use Sharpies as their laboratory: to treat the salad bar, microwave, waffle iron, and wok like
the hi-tech instruments of invention that they are. They have learned that somewhere in between cereal and the mad scientist approach (for example frito-chili-pie) there are ways to make food at Sharpies
look better, taste better, and more fun to eat.
So for all of you fellow cafeteria wanderers and cereal people. The Phoenix will print each week
a Tasty Sharpies Recepie provided by one of you. Use them for inspiration, as the art of creation at
Sharpies has yet to be fully explored. In short, experiment boldly, avoid the lentil loaf, and you never

Washington Heights area.
As a result of her experiences in
New York City Freedberg became
interested in reforming the education system. She discussed with
other participants in the Venture
program how the education systems
could be changed, based on the firsthand experience they had had with
poor teachers.
However, concern for educational

reform was not unique to the students in the Venture program.
During Freedberg's semester with
the program, N.Y. govenor Mario
Cuomo visited the school. While
there he delivered a speech about
commitment to education. He
praised IS2IB for being a school for
the twenty-first century, a statement
with which not everyone agreed.
Said Freedberg, "It had the veneer
of a progressive school, but it really
was traditional. However, one thing
that I learned is that traditional does
not always equal bad and progressive does not always equal good."
Freedberg then spent the summer
of 1994 working with a youth organization in New York City. This
time she was dealing with children
ages fourteen to fifteen. They
showed more skepticism towards
her and questioned what she, a white
middle-class woman, was doing in

the inner city.

explained it,

and took the four and five spots in the meet.
Graham Lucks '9B busted out of the freshman doldrums, finishing third for the team,
seventh place in the meet. Steve Laubach
'96 and Gene Vann '95 sealed the victory
with the eight and ten spots. The team and
coaches were very pleased with the outcome

Football
The Garnet Tide posted their first win of the
season on Saturday, defeating Ursinus 24-15 at

Clothier Field. The star of thegame was senior
running back Dave Reeser who carried the ball
20 times for 124 yards and was named Centennial Conference Offensive Player of the Week.
The grinding Swat running game was complemented by a deep Swat passing attack that led
to a long touchdownreception for S am Paschel
'96.
Ursinus recovered a fumble on the opening
play of the game but the Garnetdefense held the
Bears to a field goal, setting the tone for the
entire game. Mark Fink '95 led the team with
eleven tackles and Eric Williams '95 blocked a
punt for a safety that gave the Garnet a 21-9
lead in the second half. Swat then marched
down the field and kicked a field goal to make
it 24-9 late in the fourth quarter.

The Women's Ultimate Frisbee team competed in their first tournamentof the season this
past weekend. They accompanied the men's
team to Penn State and also faced fierce competition. The team played three games on
Saturday, with a winning record of 2-1. They
were especially pleased with the defeat of
Princeton 13-4, which avenged past losses.
Swat entered Sunday after placing 2nd in
Saturday's pool where they faced two of the top
ranked teams and suffered tough losses. The
entire squad played extremely well especially
the new members of the team. Kate Walker '97
led the team with outstanding play, while Professor Lisa Meedengave Swat a definiteboost

Swarthmore's mighty field hockey team
has completed another tough week of play
with an untarnished record; they now have
13 wins and 0 losses. This week was not an
easy one for the team; they did not finish
with their previously habitual wipe-outs.
The team traveled to Washington College on Thursday and ended regular play
with 1-1 tie. This was the closest thing to
a loss that S warthmore has experienced yet
this season but, demonstrating great poise,
skill, and determination, the team played
hard in overtime and came away with the
victory. Melissa Bonder '95 scored the
winning goal in overtime on a penalty

a

stroke.

On Saturday, one of season's last archrivals came to visit— Johns Hopkins University. Last year, the team played one of
its worst games at Johns Hopkins on astroturf. While they were training on the same
surface in England, they decided that they
would reverse their humiliating defeat this
season. This conference gamealmost ended
in another tie, but with a few seconds left
on the clock, Julie Noyes '95 scored. The
final score of 1-0 is not reflective of the
actual tide of the game, however.
Swarthmore had 30 shots on goal and it
was only due to poor refereeing, a good
Hopkins goalie, and bad luck that only one
shot went in.
So, with only seven games left in the
season, Swarthmore is steadily increasing
its chances of a Divisional win. The team
is also anxious to have a few more highscoring games in order to eclipse the football team in total points once again (they
are currently behind by a few)!

Women's Rugby
Swarthmore's women ruggers played an
intense game against Bucknell University
on Saturday and, after 80 minutes ofrugby,
they walked off the field victorious. The
teams were evenly matched, although
Swarthmore had heardrumors thatßucknell
would be tougher than they were. As a
result, the team was extremelypsyched for
the game and every player gave her alluntil
the last minute of the game.
The final score was 5-0 after Back CaptainKatie Laird '96 scored an awesome try
that leftBucknell bewildered. Swarthmore
didn't let up for an instant and, although
Bucknell threatened to score a few times,
they remained strong defensively. It seemed
in the first few minutes of the game that
Bucknell would overwhelm Swat with their
speed, but the team rallied and played up to
and beyond Bucknell's level. In particular
Swarthmore's scrum crushed Bucknell's
(if you don'tknow what a scrum is, don't
gasp or be shocked, just ask a rugger!). It
was also exciting to see thatSwat played an
even stronger second half than first. Swat
women ruggers have been doing some serious fitness training.
Always remember, if you need some
entertainment and excitement on a Saturday afternoon, come watch rugby!

Last Saturday the Cross-Country team

traveled to Cedar Crest College where they
faced a formidable field offive other teams
including Albright, Allentown, Cedar Crest,

Swarthmore emerged unscathed once again
despite faulty alarm clocks, forgotten uniforms, and a tenacious showing by Allentown. These hurdles were overcome by
Alison Shirmer '97, wholed the squad with
a third place finish and impressive time of
20:18. She was followed closely by Amy
Klosterman '97, Danielle Wall '9B,
Shoshanna Pearlman '9B, and Daniella
Learner '96. The strong finishes of Ingrid
Spies '96, Kate Dempsey '95, Debra Junilla
'97 and Stacy Nakell '96 prompted coach

Swat Volleyball Looks to Ace
Opposition at Seven Sisters'
!@%s#' positions," she said. Other

By David Lischer

Coming into the season, Coach
Larry Perry had one simple goal:
"I wanted us to play well all the
time." That's as fair an expectation as any new coach can have
and, for the most part, the women's
volleyball team has lived up to it.
They hope to springboard off a
strong performance against first
place Gettysburg into competition
for the tide of the Seven Sisters*
Tournament, which they host this
weekend.
Coach Perry' s philosophy is that
ball control is the key to every
point no matter who the opponent
is. The key to Swarthmore's ball
control is setter Jordan Hay '9B,
who was named Centennial Conference Co-Playerof theWeek after being named to the Honor Roll
last week. In a 15-5,10-15,15-9,
15-6 loss to Kutztown Saturday,
Hay had 38 set assists, 9 digs, 4
aces, 2 kills, 2 blocking assists,
and a solo block. She added 16
more set assists, a dig, and an ace
in 15-9, 15-9, 15-13 win over
Dickinson.
The nature of the setting position is such that Hay has had to
take on a certain amount of leadership. "[I play] a funny position...
it's one of those nasty 'l'm a

than an adjustment to the stricter
college rules for legal sets, Hay has
only had to learn the preferences of
her teammates. "It was difficult, at
first, getting her worked into it [because] she didn't know everyone's
styles, [or] where they liked to hit,"
said co-captain Mary Beiler '95.
Coach Perry has been concentrating heavily on serving and set plays
for the last couple of weeks in practice, as well as on transition from
defense to offense, where the team
has exhibited an occasional lapse in
concentration thus far.
The practice has paid off.
S warthmore is ranked second in the
Centennial Conference in aces averaging 3.18 a game. YvonneLui '95
and Nancy Rosenbaum '96 are second and third in the individual ace
rankings averaging .80 and .79 aces
per match, respectively. In addition, with an overall hitting percentage of .464 and an in-Conference
hitting percentage of .378,
Rosenbaum leads all Centennial
Conference hitters.
One player who has really surprised Coach Perry is Diana Bieber
'96. "I told Diana in the second
week of practice, 'I want you to hit
and pass not toset any more. I think
you have some of thebest technique
on the team.' She looked at me like

I'm from another planet," said
Coach Perry. Bieberhasnoneedto
be modest. She racked up 5 kills
and an ace against Dickinson and
then added 11 more kills and 2 digs
against Kutztown. She has also
been one of the few players able to
steady the Swarthmore team when
it falters.
Unlikemany Division HI teams,
Swarthmore uses a number of set
plays. Before each serve. Coach
Perry indicates which zone of the
court theplayer should serve it to in
an effort to isolate the opponent's
weakest passers or cause the most
damage possible. "We are trying
to concentrate more on running a
tandem, running set plays to confuse the block and the opposition,"
said Coach Perry.
To perform well at the Seven
Sisters' Tournament this weekend
and later at the Cabrini Tournament, Coach Perry feels the team
must "convert [its] talentinto good
playing... we may not be the most
physically dominating team in the
league, we should atleastbe smarter
than everyone else," he said.
However, one of Coach Perry's
goals is in danger of not being
fulfilled, "He wants us all to be
able to do 5 pull-ups," said Hay.

Women's Soccer Gains Victories
By Jill Wildonger
After a woeful season start, the
Swarthmore women's soccer team
tacked two consecutive wins to
theirrecord, now 2-7. On September 24, after a well played game
against the GreenTerrors ofWestern Maryland, Swarthmore wildly
celebrated a 1-0 victory on home
turf. The winning goal came in the
second half off the fast feet of
Betsy Rosenbaum '9B, who snuck
a sly ball over the grass munching
goalie into thefar comer of the net.
Goalkeeper Mary Catherine
Arbour '95 sacrificed body for ball,
earning herself

two. The seniors, not to be embarrassed by such a strong underclassman scoring streak, attacked in the
second half with two goals, starting
when leftfullback Heather Maloney
'95 barrelled through themid-fieldto
blast a hard shot over the goalie's

to fellow diamond players Meredith
Linn '97, Lauren Jacobi '97,
Rosenbaum and Laura Starita '96.
Fullbacks Sara Guroff *96 andBeth
Wiles '9B were ball hungry human
walls, keeping the frustrated Cabrini
strikers away from the net throughout the day.
Despite the pre-game trouncing
of a decapitated paper-mache Red
Devil, the Swarthmore Women lost
a hard played 1-0 home match to
Dickinson College Saturday.
O'Neill and Fraser left dizzy Devils
behind them, as they took theball up
field. Energetic Maloney and Baxter
cut down Dickinson offensive at-

game" ball.
Last Tuesday's game against local Cabrini College ended with a
romping 4-0 victory. The scoring
frenzy started withLiz Galatin '9B
sweeping a sweet shot from the
outside comer over the goalie's
helpless body. In the last five
seconds of first half play, feisty
frosh Sarah Jaquette bounded
through a mid-field crowd and used
her head to nod in goal number

field to fuel the offensive fire. Guroff
wiped the Devils' leading scorer off
the field; strong defense earned her
the honor of adding her signature to
the "player of the game" ball at the
end of the match.

Men's Soccer Slides
Out of NCAA Bid
With Tough Losses
By Dan Malkoun
Traveling to Carlisle, Pennsylvania with the temptations of an NCAA
tournamentbid beckoning at the doorstep, the men's soccer team lost a
close game to the Red Devils of
Dickinson this past weekendby a score
of 2-1. Returning home on Wednesday, the Garnet Tide dropped another
heartbreaker to nationally ranked
Muhlenberg by a dismal score of 5-1.
After falling behind Dickinson 2-0
in the first half, theTide came back in
the second half with a goal from Ben
Cook '95, which cut the deficit in
half. Though they applied constant
pressure to the Dickinson defense
throughout theremainder of thegame,
Swarthmore's men could not gel another goal, and they fell 2-1 to their
league rivals.
Although their chances ofpost-season play had been greatly diminished
by the loss at Dickinson, the men's
team was as determined as ever to
beat Muhlenberg this Wednesday in
yet another important league game.
Dave Lane '97 reflected the upbeat
mood of the team in Tuesday's prac-

about the chances of an NCAA bid
for his club, saying "We're not concerned about anything like that[the
tournament]. All we're thinking
about is a win on Wednesday."
Placed in what Kyle Barnett '97
called "a must win situation," the
men's team faced a Division 111
powerhouse in Muhlenberg. After
falling behind the Mules 2-0 in the
firsthalf. Amber Thompson '97sent
home an incredible bicycle kick to
pull Swarthmore within a goal at
the half. The game went directly
downhillafter that, and Muhlenberg
scored three more unanswered goals
to put Swat away for good. Although the 5-1 score was disheartening, four of Muhlenberg's goals
came on penalties aro-and the box
that were executed to perfection,
rather than defensive lapses on the

part of the Swat backfield.
Despite those two defeats, the
Garnet soccer team is taking the

of the season one game at a
time, refusing to give up their intensity and focusing on the job at
hand
winning the rest of their

games this season.

Swarthmore Bandits and Pearson '95 Steal Rolex
By Vijay Toke
This past weekend the Swarthmore Men's
Tennis Team participated in the Eastern Division Rolex Tournamentheld here on our beautiful campus. Coach Mike Mullan entered a
total of ten singles players in the single-elimination tournament; the finalists will head to
Edmond, Oklahoma for the National Rolex
Tournament.
Swarthmore was hopeful going into the tournament. Freshmen Edwin Ernst believed the
team was, "ready to do well at the tournament."
With four of the fifteen seeded players in the
sixty-four man singles draw Barry Mook '96
number two, Chris Pearson '95 number six,
Chris Ciunci '95 number ten, and Brandt Lincoln '95 number fourteen as well as thetalent
of young freshmen and experienced veterans
Swarthmore indeed had enough firepower to
do some damage. The tournament, for Division 111 schools, included players from
Haverford, Cabrini, Trenton State, Marywood,
Rutgers, Franklin & Marshall, Alleghany,
Scranton, and W & J.
The first day of the tournament was exciting,
with most Swarthmore players coming out on
top of their first round matches. The second
day was even more exciting with notable

matches by Paul Wachter '97, outlasting a
strong player fromFranklin & Marshall. Hunter
Gehlbach '95 also had a long, grueling match
on Saturday morning thatlaunched him into the
quarterfinals against Barry Mook '96. Said
Gehlbach of his weekend, "I was pleased. It
was an exhausting tournament and had some
good results." Gehlbach will be a force on the
men's team in the spring.
Other players of note in the tournament were
Freshmen Ed Ernst and Roger Werner. Werner
ground through the tournament only to have the
unfortunate circumstance of playing a teammate, Mook, on Saturday morning. Mook and
Werner had a long, tough three-set match in
which Mook pulled off an impressive third set
performance. Mook fought hard all tournament long toreach the semifinalsbefore losing
to Haverford's number two player in a difficult
match Sunday morning. Mookbelieved he had
a chance to win the match, but a nagging arm
injury prevented him from playing his best
tennis. "Though the tournament was an overall

Lincoln's smooth, seamless, powerful volleys
coupled with Mook's textbook ground strokes
vaulted the team to the semifinals before they
were defeated in a challenging match on Sunday.
The player of the weekend, in fact theplayer
of the week, was Chris "Wheels" Pearson, who
entered the tournament as the sixth seed.
Pearson had been stroking the ball particularly
well in practice as the Rolex approached. In
casual conversation, Mook said, "I'mnot going
to win the tournament Wheels is." Pearson

success for Swarthmore, I believe that it shows

Pearson's toughest match, was a moderately
close 7-5, 6-2. When asked about his tourna-

our doubles needs some improvement before
the spring season," stated Mook, the Bandits
number one player. Indeed, Swarthmore's
doubles teams had little success in the Rolex
with thenotable exception ofLincoln and Mook.

rugby player. Laird plays outside center, a position
in the back row. This week, Laird scored
Swarthmore's only try against Bucknell. The victory brought the ruggers to 2-0 in conference play,
making them only one game away from the playoffs.
Laird is also the Women's Rugby Back Captain.
She not only helps to lead the team, but she is also
responsible for running this club sport practice.
Laird is constantly pushing herselfand her teammates to learn as much as they can about the game
of rugby, and she does this with great spirit.
"Kate is intense—intensely focused and constantly trying to improve," said a teammate of
Laird, "she is very supportive of her teammates."
"She's really fast," added another.

strokes were more consistent and harderthan in
the past. His serve, always a weapon, was
stronger than ever. Wheels was even covering
the court better. In short, he was playing the
best tennis of his career. Pearson seemed to
breeze through the tournament all the way to
the final. He astounded the player who upset
the tournament's number one seed, 6-2, 6-1.
On Monday morning he faced the player who
had ousted Mook in the semifinals. The finals,

Athletes of the Week

ChriS PearSOn, a senior on the Mens
Tennis Team, won the Eastern Division 111 Rolex
Tournament held at Swarthmore this past weekend. Pearson was the sixth seed in the tournament.

Pearson, who has been playing well all season long
had a tremendous tournament, not dropping a set in
six wins leading the tournament title. In fact, his
closest match, in the final, was not all that close.
Pearson's play was head and shoulders above
every other player in the field.
"Wheels" as he is known by the tennis team and
most of the Swarthmore population, is known for
his big serve and strong

volleying as well as a
crushing forehand. He looks forward to a good
performance in the national Rolex in Edmond,
Oklahoma and in the Spring season.
