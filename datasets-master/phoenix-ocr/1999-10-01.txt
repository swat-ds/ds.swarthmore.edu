None of the members ofStudent Budget Committee like
what they hear.
Some of them are unhappy
with the state of audio equipment for student-funded
events. Others are astonished
at a proposal for upgrading the
electronics
to the tune of

Marvin Barron 'O2, assistant
treasurer for the committee,
has proposed buying almost
$15,775 of new sound equipment to replace old, damaged
and stolen elements of the system used for live events.
Barron's proposal also suggests $5,900 for replacement
equipment for the disk jockey
systems and $7,400 in new

equipment to replace what has
been on a de facto extended
loan to the college from employee Nick Kourtides.
The proposal is before the
budget committee now. If SBC
approves the request, Student
Council will have to confirm
that decision.

urday morning, Javier Hidalgo
'O2 was arrested by the Swarthmore Police on charges of simple
assault, aggravated assault,
reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct.
According to Chief of Police
Brian Craig, the police arrived
at the Strath Haven Condominiums in response to a call of a
medical emergency. The victim
was Hidalgo's roommate, Yani
Kisoki 'O2, whose injury was described in the police report as a
severe laceration to the head. A
Swarthmore ambulance transported Kisoki to the CrozierChester Medical Center and the
police took Hidalgo into custody.
Police said that after initial processing in the Swarthmore Police Station, Hidalgo was transferred to the Media Station
wherehe was housed for the rest
of the night. The arraignment
ooccurred later that morning
when Hidalgo's parents arrived
to bail him out of jail.
Chief Craig said that Hidalgo
now awaits criminal prosecution, the date of the trial not yet
determined. If convicted of the
most serious charge, aggravated
assault, a felony of the first de-

gree, Hidalgo could face up to
ten years in prison. Other out-

comes would entail less severe
sentences; a conviction for disorderly conduct, merely a summary violation, incurs no prison
time.When asked about the possible involvement of substances
in the incident, Chief Craig replied that they had no bearing on
the charges.
Hidalgo also must undergo a
hearing by the College Judiciary
Committee this coming Saturday. As Associate Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie explained, any case involving violence/assault goes before the
CJC, a board composed of two
members of the faculty, one
member of the staff, and two students. Dean Bob Gross will convene the hearing. If the CJC
finds Hidalgo guilty of violating
college policy, it has at its disposal the full range of sanctions,
from warnings to permanent

expulsion.
After the conclusion of the
hearing, Goundie will release a
statement detailing the charge,
the outcome of the hearing) and
any sanctions taken.
Although Public Safety was
also present at the incident. Director Owen Redgrave declined
to comment, citing as his reason
the upcoming adjudication.

Kelly Hines 'OO said. "Anyone
could jump out at you."
The track area and the paths
from Danawell to Wharton, from
the field house to the main campus, and behind Willets were
some specific places identified
as badly lit.
Redgrave explained that the
college's lighting policy is based
on a system of three-year plans.
"We really started to address
this about 10years ago, and three
years ago we implemented a
three-year plan," Redgrave said.
"That plan included a group of
RAs, WRC members, and other
students going around campus to
identify places that were dark.
100 percent of those places have
been addressed."

Three resolutions and
alcohol policy on
agenda at Haverford

Tuition rising at Bryn Mawr
Financial aid, technology, publishing costs contribute to increase
By Sandhya Sundaresan
Bi-Co News Staff
There have recently been rumors circulating that tuition at
Bryn Mawr College is once again
on the rise, and at a rate higher
than that of most other colleges
and universities. The issue was
brought up at one of the Student
Government Association meetings this year, where Jerry
Berenson, Treasurer of the college, was questioned about this
trend.
The tuition fees along with
costs for room and board at Bryn
Mawr are $31,400 for the 19992000 school year. While this does
not make Bryn Mawr the most
expensive college in the COFI
(all colleges of comparable size
and caliber) group, it does place
it a little above the median tuition of this group. However, the
actual costs of tuition, room and
board are not the only reason for
concern. The rate at which they
have been increasing in the past
few years has also been called
into question. The rise in tuition
from the last year to this has
been 3.6%. This is higher (by
1.5%) than the rate of inflation
from the past year to the present,
which is only 2.1%. This means
that the costs have actually been
increasing at a rate not supported or warranted solely by
the natural rise in costs from
year to year. Moreover, this is
not a trend that has been noticed
only this past year, but for some
time now.
Berenson mentioned that the
rise in the number of students
receiving financial aid from the
college and in the average
amount offinancial aid students
receive, has been a major reason
for the tuition increase. Financial aid expenditures as a percentage of the tuition income

have increased from 32% to
36%. Furthermore, the undergraduate financial aid has gone
up 123% from the 1990-99 fiscal
year. Financial aid has also been
increasing at a rate higher than
inflation.
Very few students, only 5-10%,
are denied admission into Bryn
Mawr solely for financial rea-

which is only 2.1%.
sons. The Admissions and Financial Aid Offices work separately.
The Admissions Office ranks all
students, independent of their
financial needs, and then hands
over the rankings to the Financial Aid Office which then tries
to provide aid for as many students requiring it as possible
starting with those ranked the
highest. The 5-10% are the students who placed low in the
rankings, and who cannot receive financial aid because the
college has run out of funds by
the time it reaches them.
Another reason for the tuition
increase is technology. All the
Bryn Mawr dorms have been
networked an expensive undertaking. The college is also currently working on installing
more advance computer facilities that will allow online access
to grades and online-registration, a program in which the college has invested around $3.4
million.
The salaries and benefits for
-

administrative and academic
faculty has also been a large
source of expenditure and constitutes almost half of the total
expenses.
Other reasons include the
costs of publishing (of the books
and journals in the libraries)
which have been going up
steadily, by at least 7% every
five years, in the past few years.
The costs of building maintenance is also very high.
Bryn Mawr has a lot of old
buildings that require a great
deal of maintenance and care.
Recent construction and renovation projects, such as the Rhys
Carpenter and Rhoads projects
(the latter is a $l4 million
project) have also contributed to
the overall increase in expenses.
To date the way to deal with
the rising level of financial support needed to run the college
has been primarily through tuition increases.
In a search for more leveling
measures that could ease the
pressure on student's Berenson
said that the fund raising program, which has been around for
almost a hundred years now and
is extremely successful. He also
said that the college is working
on increased fund raising as a
viable alternative to raises in
tuition.
Berenson recognizes the rise
in tuition as a problem. While it
is hard to tell if students admitted to Bryn Mawr and who
choose not to come here do so
solely because tuition costs are
high, it cannot be known how
many students are discouraged
from applying in the first place
because it is so expensive. In
their attempts to cuts down on
spending, the college is hoping
that a little saving here and there
will go a long way toward doing
the trick.

Three resolutions and the Alcohol Policy will be presented to the
student body at Haverford's Fall Plenary on October 3.
A resolution proposing a policy allowing for "student choice" for
animal use may run into some controversy. Authors are calling on
the Biology and Psychology department to allow students the option of not participating in vivisection and not punish them academically if that choice is made.
Currently the Biology Department's policy is to not require the
dissection of or experimentation on any vertebrate animal. However, students are required to participate in experiments involving
invertebrates such as genetics experiments on fruit flies.
Biology Professor Phil Meneely says that he will not support the
resolution. "I personally would not support it and I would recommend that the Biology department not support because it does restrict the students from doing certain kinds of research," said professor Meneely. "For professors it restricts certain avenues of research."
A resolution that will result in the restructuring ofSpeakers Committee has also been submitted. The proposal comes in response to
recent criticism of the lack of "big name" speakers and an inability
to find students willing to serve on the committee. Because the committee has not existed this semester with only one student actually
running for a position, Students' Council took over the task of budgeting for Speakers at the college. The resolution calls for a split in
the $20,000 allocated for Speakers Committee. If passed Students'
Council will receive $lO,OOO each semester to bring speakers to the
campus and the other $lO,OOO will go to Speakers Committee.
A non-binding resolution to change the election cycle was the last
of the three proposals. Authors of the resolution, including Students'
Council Co-Presidents Judson Redmond 'Ol and Jesse Ehrenfeld 'OO,
criticize the current election process as "inherently problematic."
The Students' Association Constitution, which dictates the current
election cycle, cannot be changed until Spring Plenary when the
entire document will be up open to changes.
"This is not something that is really going to affect things now,"
said Ehrenfeld. "It is more of a resolution to let people know what is
going on so there is not a big surprise in the fall."
As it stands the current process requires that elections be held
mid-year. Because of this Juniors who study abroad second semester are unable to run for an office for their senior year. When the
Executive Council does come to office they have very little time to
prepare for the all important Spring Plenary in which both the
Student's Association Constitution and Honor Code are ratified for
the next year.
If passed, the resolution will be a statement of the student body's
support for a move to debate the current cycle at Spring Plenary.
The alcohol policy, which must be re-ratified every other year, is
also on the agenda.

Board of Managers considers fundraising drive
By Ruth Shoemaker
For The Phoenix
on the past
of Managers
Meetings, President of the College Al Bloom praised the Board
for representing the "exciting intellectual powers in creativeand
ethical visions that this school
generates." Additionally, he
cited the "invigorating" discussions in which members engaged during Friday and
Saturday's meetings.
The gathering began on Friday
morning with meetings of each
of the Board's individual committees. Friday morning marked
the first meeting of a new committee comprised of Board
members, faculty, staff, and students that aims to build on
Swarthmore's mission of educationfor social responsibility. According to Bloom, the meeting
consisted of general discussion

Reflecting

weekend's Board

of how to approach the topic in
specific ways and how to facilitate programs and practices that
would increase the effectiveness
of the College's tradition of promoting socially responsible education. Chairing this new committee is Neil Grabois, past
President of Colgate University
and current Vice President of
Strategic Planning and Program
Coordination at the Carnegie
Corporation of New York.
At the top of the Board's
agenda over the course of the
weekend were the College's varied building projects. The Instructions and Libraries Committee, chaired by Dulany Ogden
Bennett, present head of Oregon
Episcopal School, addressed
ways of maximizing interdisciplinary interaction among faculty and students through renovations to DuPont and Martin.
Under the proposed plan,
DuPont would be expanded to

connect to Martin and theresult-

ing "Science Center" would gain
an additional 40,000 square feet
than is presently available for
student and faculty use in
DuPont.
After lunch with students on
Friday afternoon, Board members reconvened for a Student
Life meeting consisting of reports from Student Council CoChair Matt Schwartz and from
Director of Psychological ServicesDavid Ramirez. Discussion
of the issues addressed by
Schwartz and Ramirez was followed by a two-hour architectural presentation on possible
designs for the new "Science
Center." Although no definitive
decisions were reached, Managers focused on two proposals
that are being returned to the
architectural firms that submitted themfor further reworking.
After dinner on Friday night,
Managers met with eight Swar-

thmore faculty members at
Bloom's home. Faculty discussed theirresearch and teaching interests in what Bloom
called, "a truly remarkable session which sustained the Board
members' awe at our remarkable faculty." Bloom praised the
Board as "visionary and
unqualifyably committed to
Swarthmore. They have tremendous respect for Swarthmore
students and faculty."
Saturday morning events began with reports by Chairman of
the Board Larry Shane and
Bloom. Bloom reported on specific areas of College life and
addressed the fundraising drive
which the Board is presently
undertaking. The College seeks
to raise $220 million to support
planned building projects and
discussion on Saturday focused
on strategies to raise that sum.
After approval of the year's financial statements, each of the

individual committees reported
on the business it had addressed.
The final event of the weekend, a presentation explaining to
Managers the recommendations
the town has made to the College,
occurred on Saturday afternoon.
This was the first time theBoard
had formally heard official
plans. "They had many questions," explained Bloom, "but
they also feel committed as we
all do to work to sustain a very
positive relationship with the
borough through undertaking
initiatives which will be in our
mutual interest. As a community we need to discuss the recommendationsthoroughly and to
thinkhardabout how we can best
meet our common interest." Before making any decisions regarding the town's proposal, the
Board is waiting to hear discussion that takes place among administration, faculty, staff, and
students.

Westphal's SCUBA

Council begins
shuttle service
to Genuardi's

classes take a dive

Student Council's newest student life program begins after
October break, when it debuts a
free shuttle service to
Genuardi's on Baltimore Pike.
The shuttle will run from 8 to
10 p.m. Tuesday nights, leaving
from the Rose Garden continuously for the trip to the supermarket. After theprogram's trial
period is over, council will decide
whether or not to keep it or expand it to other nights of the
week.
"Students are hungry on this
campus and we want to give
them food," Student Council cochair JaredSolomon 'Ol quipped
after this week's meeting, where
council approved the pilot of the
shuttle program.
During the meeting, Solomon
shocked other council members
with a passionate condemnation
of what he said was a lack of action.
"The majority of the people
sitting here have done one-tenth
of what they said on their platform," Solomon said. "There
needs to be action and action is
completely lacking."
Fellow co-chair Matt Schwartz
'Ol joined in Solomon's expression of frustration, urging members to reconsider their commitment to the organization.
"There's nothing wrong with resigning," Schwartz said, "if you
feel you don't have anything to
do with SC anymore."
After the co-chairs' admonishment, the council heard from
Jordan Brackett 'Ol, who described the assignment of student parking spaces as "irrational, random and haphazard." He
was the second student speaker
in as many weeks to denounce
the system.
Finally, Schwartz noted that
Vice President for Facilities and
Services Larry Schall had asked
the council to suggest a plan for
the renovation of some student
spaces. "Larry Schall has given
us a standing offer to do whatever we want withWharton C/D
basement and Sharpies III,"
Schwartz said. The council is interested in receiving proposals
tor a new use for the currentlydecrepit Sharpies 111 space.

After years as part of the
Physical Education curriculum,
all three scuba classes —basic,
advanced, and rescue—have
been cancelled.
Professor of Economics Larry

interest and insurance disputes
between College administration
and Hidden Cove Scuba, the dive
shop that ran the classes, as major causes of the program's de-

Because of the risks inherent
in the activity,colleges have long
required all scuba instructors to
carry accident insurance, usually a policy worth one million
dollars. In addition, scuba equipment suppliers are required to
carry a similar policy to protect
against equipment-related accidents.
While there is no widely recognized standard for the size of
this policy, Professor Westphal
said he had been told the accepted average is only one million dollars; the college requires
a three million dollar policy.

Unfortunately, despite
active advertising and
recruiting —what
Westphal called "busting
[his] butt to get the word
out about scuba"
enrollment in the scuba
classes varied wildly from
year to year,
—

While Professor Westphal described the decision to cancel the
scuba program as "questionable," the dive shop had clear fiscal incentive for doing so. Each
year the dive shop's activities on
campus grossed no more than
six thousand dollars.
With the burden of the added
insurance amounting to two
thousand dollars annually, the
operation found it necessary to
sever its ties to the College.
These monetary problems
could have been overcome by
increased student support. Unfortunately, despite active advertising and recruiting—what
Westphal called "busting [his]
butt to get the word out about
scuba"—enrollment in the scuba
classes varied wildly from year
to year, ranging from as many as
forty to as few as eighteen students.
Westphal cited several factors
that kept enrollment low. For
many students, the cost of the
class was prohibitive. The lack
of an active scuba club also hindered involvement; although a
scuba club was formed, student
government never approved it
for funding because it was
viewed as too exclusive.
When Westphal and others
tried independently to arrange
scuba trips over break periods,
they yet again ran into a lack of
interest. According to Westphal,
cost was again an issue. "Few
people want to spend a thousand
dollars to go on a scuba trip," he
explained.
Finally, the scuba program's
core participants graduated with
the classes of 1998 and 1999,
leaving the program without a
dedicated group of divers.
In the end, a complex set of
problems led to the program's
failure: as Westphal put it,
"There's really no one to
blame...except maybe everyone."

Safety concerns lead to allocation of money for lighting
FromWßC.pg. I

According to Redgrave, a new
three-year plan has been made
up.
The college has allotted
$25,000 a year for lighting, which
includes expenses for new lights
and maintenance, but is separate
from the new construction being
done on campus.
"It [525,000 a year] may seem
like a lot, but the state has
changed requirements recently,
which means that manyfixtures
have to be changed," Redgrave
said.
Lighting has recently been
improved at Ben West House,
the field house, DuPont, Willets,
Hicks, and the walk from
Sharpies to Parrish.
Redgrave stressed that feedback from students was essential to keeping the lighting situation adequate.
"I welcome people to get in
touch with me if they have any
concerns or suggestions," he
said.
Another issue broached at the
meeting was that of public safety
escorts. Many of the students
present expressed concern that
students don'tknow what safety
options were available to them.
The idea of a reserved-students
email detailing these options was
suggested.
Students can call for a public
safety officer to escort them to
any building on campus or to
admit them to a building at any
time of day or night.
"Don't feel bad about calling
public safety for an escort,"
Laurenzi said. "That is what we
are here for!"
Four or five safety officers are
on duty each night. Some are
walking patrollers, and some are
driving around in the shuttles.
According to Laurenzi, the spotchecked officers have two functions: to escort people; and to
patrol the grounds looking for
suspicious things when they are
not escorting. Public Safety can
be called from any campus
phone, including phones outside
the dorms.
Meeting attendees also wondered about the safety of students working late in academic
buildings. There is no set sched-

ule detailing when a public
safety officer is in a building, but
according to Laurenzi, building
checks occur two or more times
per night.
"If you need an admit to a
building, call public safety. Just
let us know when you leave,"
Laurenzi said.
Laurenzi and Redgrave
stressed that students must do
theirpart in keeping the campus
safe.
"We have a problem with
doors being propped," Laurenzi
said. "Putting a rock or a piece
of paper in the door to keep it
open that's no good. You just
-

don't know who's going to walk
in."
Laurenzi cited an incident
about three weeks ago in which
marketing representatives entered dorms and distributed
materials during a football
game. They were able to enter
through propped doors.
"They shouldn't have been
there," he said.
Students explained that doors
were often propped to allow students access to dorms other than
their own. Card access was
brought up as a solution to this
problem, including the suggestion that a card access system

would more easily provide students with access to dorms and
other academic building without
having to call for an admit. Like
those used at other colleges, the
proposed card would be all-purpose, usable as a key, an ID card,
a dining card, etc.
Redgrave was positive about
the proposed card system. "[The
idea] is under consideration,"
Redgrave said. "I think we are
heading towards a card system,
but I'm not sure when."
Another topic discussed was
expanding the Party Associate
system. Recent improvements to
the PA system include better

access for PAs to phones to call
Public Safety as soon as a need
is identified.
An extension of the PAs is under discussion that would include another subset of workers at parties to escort students
to their dorms if the students
don'tfeel comfortable walking
alone.
WRC members and public
safety stressed that students
should not hesitate to contact
public safety for any reason.
"If you see something that
doesn't look right, or someone
suspicious," Laurenzi said, "call
us."

"The formation of this course was really due to the initiative
of students," said Charles James, English Department chair. "The
course is kind of ad hoc at this point, but we wouldlike to think it
is something that will be continued on into the future."
The strongest student advocates of a journalism class have, in
the past, been members of the Phoenix staff. This is "good logic,"
said James, but also raises questions about the prospects of getting credit for working for the Phoenix, "at which point, things
just get complicated." This concern and others about how the
class would fit into the construct of the Department and major
contributed to the delay in adding the course to the curriculum.
The main obstacle to implementing the class was not the course
content, however; the concept of a workshop is not new to the
English Department. Rather, according to James, there was difficulty in finding a professor within the department who "felt
they had the expertise" and specialized in journalism.
Ben Yagoda, who is teaching the Journalism workshop, said
James contacted him last year for some potential instructors for
the course, but none worked out. This year Yagoda, who is an
Associate Professor of English at the University of Delaware,
was himself available and interested.
"Journalism is a valuable way to approach writing. It is about
being simple and clear and not just focused on length and eloquence," said Yagoda. "What is valuable, too, is just the journalistic way of approaching thought, language, and even the world."
Yagoda pointed out the lack of such courses at other "elite"
schools, which "tend not to have much comparatively."
"A journalism workshop is a luxury," said Yagoda. "But it is a
nice luxury to have."
Kost-Grant agrees with this sentiment.She is not definitively
planning on journalism as a career, but she aspires to be a National Public Radio correspondent and acknowledges, "I don't
know if that's even feasible, but it's good to have the background,
and I really like the class."

Budget Committee considering S3OK sound proposal
trom SOUND, pg. I
production intern in the Lang

performing Arts Center, has
Ibeen jerry-rigging sound setups
since the summer, when a set of
speakers was stolen. Sometimes
that takes a while, like at last
Olde Club show, when
he said he spent 16 hours of his
own time rigging before the

event.

And, like at that show, often
the current system just isn't up
to the job.
"The headliner was really talented and knew what he
wanted," Kourtides said yesterday. "It was a real struggle for
me to give it to him."
Barron said the only reason
there has been sound at all so far
this semester is that Kourtides
has devoted so much time to it.

"It's being held together by his
jerry-rigging and his personal
equipment," Barron said.
And although there used to be
enough sound equipment for
three separate systems, now
there is only enough for one com-

Kourtides, who works as
a production intern in the

plete set.

Barron said that prevents the
Social Affairs Committee from
throwing more than one event
requiring live sound on a given
weekend, since Kourtides has to
personally configure each setup.
The major reason the system
is in such disrepair at this point,
according to Kourtides, is theft.
"Most of our monitor system was
stolen over the summer," he said.
Since all the monitor speakers
need to be identical for the performers' benefit, that leaves the
system (and the artists) worse
off. "If they don't hear [each

other] perfectly, they don't perform well," said Kourtides.
Barron said his proposal is
designed to address the theft issue. It would provide forpermanently mounted speakers in Olde
Club and Upper Tarble, an expensive proposition but one that
would in the long run reduce student labor costs and wear-andtear from transporting equipment across campus.
Kourtides, who said he used to
spend his own money to make
emergency repairs to the student system, said he is planning
to leave Swarthmore in a year.
By then, he said, there needs to
be a new system, preprogrammed and customized by him, so
that students can continue to use
it on a "plug and play" basis.
"That's a place where we need
to be when I leave," he said, "and

so we need to start."
Kourtides also recommended
that SBC approve a regular
yearly amount for maintenance
someof the sound system
thing he said takes time and
money but extends the lifetime
of the equipment dramatically.
"It's like maintaining a van,"
said Kourtides, who noted that
the sound system needs the
equivalent of an oil change and
tune-up on a regular basis.
Barron, who calculated in the
proposal that the expense would
run to $22.36 per student, or
about 10 percent of the $226 activities fee, saidhe thought it was
an overdue and worthwhile expense. Further, he said, it did not
concentrate its benefits into one
part of the camus community.
"This benefits just about everybody," Barron said.

STUDENT COUNCIL PLATFORMS
CollPgg Planning Committee
Brandon Silverman 'O2
fnllegp Planning Committee
As the Student Council representative

to the College Planning Committee, I
would focus on improving the amount of

studentrecreational space we have available and improving the quality of the living space here at Swat, which includes
making sure the student population parallels the amount of living space Swat has
available, as well as ensuring that the
dorms we are using are in the best possible condition.
Recreational space: Swat suffers from
a severe lack of student space. While most
other colleges have at least one student
area designated specifically for student
use, we have to make do with the Parrish
Parlours, Kohlberg Coffee Bar, or Upper
Tarblc.none of which were designed as
a place for students to hang out in their
free time. Along the lines of the Student
Council's intention to procure some pinball machines, it's appropriate that Swat
tries to find some area, new or old, that
students can use 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week, when they are specifically trying
not to do work.
Living space: As a member of the housing waiting list last year, I am personally
cognizant of the inequality between student population and student living space
available. I'm excited about Swat growing, just as long as it doesn't mean that
the number of students living in Strath
Haven grows as well.
The position of representative to the
College Planning Committeeis a valuable
one, and I'm ready to present the concerns of the student body to committee
in order to ensure the highest possible
quality of living for Swat students.
Sophia Acord 'O3
Collpge Planning Committee
would love a chance to serve on the College Planning Committee.As a freshman,
I embrace the chance to become more
involved in my community and represent
my class in affairs concerning the campus. I've served on student council for the
past three years in my high school and
feel that I could make a valuable contribution to the Swarthmore student body.
I'm not afraid to speak my mind and
thrive in an environment where originality and outspokeness are welcome. Concerning issues, I'd like to see more done
to promote campus unity and encourage
Swatties to travel beyond the campus.
Trips to D.C., New York, and other cultural events off campus should be emphasized and organized. For a fresh outlook
and young blood, vote for me!

I'm running for college planning com-

Matthew Davis 'Ol

I am interested in the position available
on the College Planning Committee. I feel
that I might represent a new voice, one
with greater attention to environmental
consequences and long-term impact.
Joining this excellent committee would
allow me to give back to the college community, especially at a time when serious
decisions must be made. There is a real
need for committed analysis of the deeper
aspects of these planned construction
projects, which I feel excited and ready
to engage in.
I hope you will consider these things
when voting:
•I am strongly committed to addressing important long-term and environmental consequences.
•I have been active in environmental
and social issues during my three years
here through Students Promoting Environmental Equity in Chester (SPEEC) and
Campus Coalition Concerning Chester

frosh, 4 sophomores, and 9 seniors); SC
van coordinator (Fall 1999: I acquired a
new van for student use and established
the guidelines for the new movie van).
My platform: Rebirth of student government; refinement of Student Council
(SC) and its role; revitalization of studentSC relations.
My ideology: Student representation requires accountability and adeptness; students must have a voice in the evolution
of the College; improvement in student
life can only occur with SC-student unity;
My agenda: Rebuild SC's commitment
to the student & the student's confidence

and performance
My promise: The extent of our contribution to and participation in the College's
future depends strongly upon a collective
effort on the part of SC and the students.
I believe that with inspired SC leadership
and enthusiastic support from the students, we can ensure that Swarthmore remains a liberal arts college belonging to
the students. My priorities include reforming the structure of SC in order to
create a more representative and comprehensible system; ensuring that student
views are heard in future construction &
development plans; and constantly improving the quality of student life, such
as initiating a committed and detailed
campaign for a student center. I will be

Secretary

Robert Melick 'O3
Cnllpge Planning Committee

Jordan

Hi, my name is Robert Melick. And I
am interested in representing the Class of
2003, as well as the entire Swarthmore
Community in Student Council in the activities committee. I am a sociable person,
and I know roughly 90% of the freshman
class, and talk to everyone about issues
which concern them. I am an initiator, but
more importantly, I am a great listener.
Activities are an integral part of life at
Swarthmore, and if elected to this committee, I will give everyone an opportunity to
have their ideasheard. I thoroughly enjoy
meeting and talking to people. For those
ofyou who do not know me, and have any
concerns regarding my candidacy, or life
in general, feel free to contact me at any
time at x 3445. Thank you for your time!

The description I found on the web for
the Student Council Secretary is as follows: "The Secretary shall be responsible
for recording all Council minutes at all
Council meetings, making themavailable
for all Council members, and posting
them on the Council bulletin board. Responsible for all other documentation as
well. Perks include new pad and pencil."
By description alone, the position of Secretary seems rather simple and mundane.
However, if elected, I will change this characterization. I could go on and on in this
platform about my goals for this school:
more student space; higher student wages;
famous and exciting speakers; enough
publicity so that when people back home
in Michigan hear I'm going to Swarthmore,

Brackett 'Ol
Secretary

they don't ask me, "Why did you choose
an all-girls school in Massachusetts?"
However, because these goals seem to be
relatively universal among students, the
question is not "Does Jordan believe in
them?" but rather, "What can Jordan do
as Student Council Secretary to help mold
these visions into reality?"
I do not envision myself as being
merely "the minutes taker," but rather,
the person on Council whose job it is to
vigorously promote communication
within the SC andbetween the SC and the
student body. It seems this school has
reached a consensus that the Student
Council's main problem is its perceived
apathy/inactivity, which has been underscored by the massive turnover rate in
recent years. This is not only embarrassing for the SC, but it handicaps themfrom
effectively advocating for change, as they
have lost legitimacy throughout campus.
These problems will change this year.
Maybe this is just my perception, but I
feel a new vibe on campus this semester,
a new feeling of purpose. From the great
kickoff we got from the Garnet Tide in
their trouncing of Oberlin, to the high
hopes espoused by the Council in last
week's Phoenix, this campus is alive with
a new energy.
As Student Council Secretary, I will
work tirelessly to capitalize on this energy. I will work as hard as I can to promote unity throughout the Council so that
once again, we will be a powerful force
on campus that sets its goals high and
achieves gains for the student body.
I cannot promise that if elected we will
suddenly have new student space and.be
the next concert stop after theFirst Union
Center and Madison Square Garden. But
what I can promise is that everyday I feel
excited and energized to be a part of this
campus. What I can promise is that I will
use this enthusiasm to work tirelessly to
make the Student Council the representative body that the students deserve. I
will work to be much more than the "guy
who takes minutes."
I am not running for this position as a
power trip, or even to gain experience for
a future political career. I am not even running for thereward of a free legal pad and
a Bic. I am running because I only have
two years left at this wonderful school and
deeply and sincerely want to give back as
much as I can. And my "added perks" will
come from the inner satisfaction that at
the end of this year, we can all step back
and say, "Wow, what a transformation.
This was a great year for the SC."

Complacency leads to
compromised safety
It was last Saturday night that you were walking back alone from PPR at,
say, 3 a.m. As you rounded the deserted track, it suddenly dawned on you
that lighting was pretty scarce, and that the empty bleachers were barely
visible in the thick shadow. Maybe your steps quickened until you reached
the lights of the main campus, but oh, well. Nothing is going to happen to
you anyway, right? After all, this is a safe campus.
On a small suburban campus like this one, it is too easy for students to be
complacent about their safety. Whereas at urban colleges most people are
cautious to a fault about keeping doors locked, walking in pairs, and staying
in well-lit areas, here most people don't think twice about leaving dorms
unlocked or crossing campus alone in the dark. Yet, Swarthmore has had its
share of questionable activity over the years, most recently when a suspicious person was found inside McCabe Library.
It's not that people here are dumb, or irresponsible, or don't care about
their safety. It's just that it is often not very time-efficient to wait for
public safety to come pick you up, or to wait for an admit to a locked
building. To busy and self-confident students, these things can just seem
like a waste of time. However, the system is not as slow as it seems, and it
is more than worth it to be safe. ■
Another problem is a lack of familiarity with the options at hand. Who is
going to call for an escort if they don't know one is available in the first
place? Commendably, public safety has promised to send out a reservedstudents e-mail, which should help remedy this.
But public safety can't take care of the problem by itself. This is, after all,
a campus of 1375 young people looking to become self-sufficient adults.
Public safety should be there to assist us but not to babysit us. So we as
students need to be more cautious and responsible without compromising
the weekend partying and weeknight academic endeavors we treasure so
much.
The fact of the matter remains that Swarthmore is a safe campus. But no
one should believe that we are safe from everything here. Why risk it? Call
public safety for an escort (they're available at any time of day or night).
Report suspicious people or things. If there's an area on campus you don't
feel safe walking through, let public safety know. Call for admits to locked
buildings instead of propping doors. And push for the card access system.
There is no reason to be scared. But there is also no excuse to be caught
unaware.

We need sleep
We haven't slept in over 24 hours.
Our eyes ache from staring at our computer screens. Our bodies are stiff
from the hard wooden chairs we have occupied for those hours. And our
minds—well, let's just say we wish we went to UPenn right about now.
In short, we're damn tired, and we want to sleep.
You might say that we brought it upon ourselves, what with this newspaper-a-week thing and all. To that, we say you're absolutely right. Now don't
ever remind us of it again.
However, this doesn't apply to everybody else. We're sure that when you
entered Swarthmore, you didn't expect the all-nighter to become part of
your weekly routine. Of course, you probably didn't expect to be rooming
with a socially inept recluse or a drunken slob, either, but that's for another
editorial.
Regardless, the point here is pretty simple: you aren't getting enough
sleep. We've seen you nodding off in Bio 1 or Micro or that class with the
chairs that are a little too comfortable, and take it from us, it ain't pretty.
Now we aren't your mother, and we aren't going to tell you to turn in at a
decent hour, although you do need to call us more often. We know you spend
a few too many hours playing pinball and getting sloshed on cheap liquor,
and that's all right—you're in college, after all.
But we do have one small request. Stop your whining (or bragging, as it
may be). You, too, bring it upon yourself, and if you want more sleep, there
is probably some way you can get it. And let's face it—you aren't going to
get any sympathy from us. Who isn't busy here?
Swarthmore is simply the kind of school where you have to make choices
between your activities, your academics, your social life and sleep. Something has to give, and sleep is often the first to go.
The point here is clear. You're all grown up now, and it's your choice
whether to sleep or not. But if you choose in the negative, don't come crying
to us—we slept less than you did last night.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Coercion doesn't score with me
To the Editor:
You probably didn't notice the words in the
Guide to Student Life, because they are buried deep in the Dining Service schedule. But
better than even "Everyone should eat at
Sharpies," they express the administration's
unrealistic inclination to unite the campus
behind the building we call Sharpies Dining
Hall.
The weekly dining schedule, printed in the
Guide, on pages 10 and 11, clearly shows that,
under themealprogram, Sharpies Dining hall
is the only possible place to eat on campus
for every single Saturday lunch.
As I read it, someone in administration
I'm not sure who-decided that holding lunch
every Saturday in Sharpies would bring students to the Dining Hall for this particular
meal. They might have scored with that strategy. I have often noted that I have nothing
against Sharpies or my classmates who like
to go and eat there. But I do not believe this
emphasis on the Dining Hall has the support
of the entire campus, and making attendance
at Le Sharpie essentially mandatory by offering us our food there and only there goes
too far.
Because there are students-including mewho enjoy this weekly lunch, I wholeheartedly support the idea. But the fact is there
are others who do not want to go, and closing
all other options as coercion will not score
points with them or change their attitudes
about eating here.
But more importantly, making anything
tantamount to mandatory is simply unacceptable at Swarthmore. There's no rules fore-

ing you to attend your classes every day or
sleep in your bed every night, and no one can
force you to Worth when you're sick. The last
mandatory Swarthmore activity you probably attended was the Safer Sex Workshop.
Here, students support activities that they enjoy but respect the right of others not to be
interested. I don't believe administrators
would demand the student body's presence
in Parrish every Tuesday at 4:23 p.m., and no
one has ever talked about similar mandatory
weekly dining events for the highly successful Kohlberg Coffee or Essie Mae's Snack
Bars. What makes Sharpies, and only
Sharpies, deserve special treatment? Saturday Sharpies lunchis traditional, but so is free
choice.
If administrators are in favor of using more
of our nearly $4OOO in annual board costs to
make us lunch on Saturday, I am all for it.
But lunch should be had everywhere, snack
bar as well as the Dining Hall, Tuesdays as
well as Saturdays, and all other days, doggone
it! Lunches should be optional but well-promoted. Last week's visit by James Q. Wilson
had tremendous advance publicity, but for
years Collection has not been mandatory.
I suggest that Saturday lunch be held at
every on-campus dining location. If I wasn't
forced into it, you might find me at Sharpies
Dining Hall. But I resent this attempt at coercion, especially since no one was polite
enough to ask, or even to inform the student
body yet. I encourage you to join me for a
brown-bag at 11 a.m. every Saturday -in Essie
Mae's.
Evan Gregory 'Ol

Student life problems begin with students
To the Editor:
I was duly impressed by Nick Attanasio's
editorial last week (Op-Ed, p. 7) that described the problems with student life here
at Swat. However, I think he touched on only
part of the problem. He discusses our
"warped version of school spirit" without any
mention of what I believe is the cause of this
unfortunate problem: our warped student
body.
Every student here is smart, sure, but so
what? Too many Swatties think that just because they're smart, that makes them special. My being smart doesn't make me any
more special than the fact that I am 5'10" or
that I have blond hair arid blue eyes. Similarly, just because we're ranked number one
by the U.S. News and World Report's survey
of colleges, that doesn't make us any better
than the State University of New York at Albany, which has the second largest poured
concrete structure in the world, or University of California at Santa Cruz, whose mas-

cot is the banana slug. Personally, I would

gladly tradethe #1 ranking for either of these
distinctions.
The problem with student life at Swarthmore is only a symptom of the problem with
much of the student body. I'm not talking
about everybody, of course, but you know who
you are. You're the people who are proud of
the fact that you stayed in McCabe until it
closed. You quote Hegel at every opportunity.
You sit in the front row of every class and
say everything that comes into your head
because you just assume that it's worth saying because, after all, you thought of it and
you go to Swarthmore College, the number
one college in the country.
So just relax a little; don't take everything
so seriously; try to be more like Gilligan. Just
imagine how much more fun Swat would be
if everyone were just a little more like
Gilligan.
Gregjablonski 'O2

Smokers should consider others
To the Editor:
I enjoyed reading Simon Kaufman's insightful column last week on the image and
effects of smoking ("Disposable Lives," Sept.
24). I commend him for attacking such a sensitive topic with fairness and boldness.
I have two responses, however. First, while
Kaufman expresses disappointment in the
FDA's methods of combating smoking's alluring images, I think he should be grateful
that it has at least made an effort. Having
just spent six and a half months in Europe,
where übiquitous images of smokers lingering among minuscule "No Smoking" signs

seemed, to this American, almost comical, I'm

impressed Philadelphia even has anti-smoking billboards.
Second, Kaufman writes that "[sjmokers
hurt themselves, not to mention hurting those
who care about them...." He misses another
victim, though: the non-smoker in their vicinity. Those who are forced to pass by someone smoking (say, to enter a building) are
coerced, if just for a short time, into deteriorating their own health by way of secondhand smoke. I wonder how many smokers
think—or care—about that.

McCain jumps
in as Quayle
drops out
On the same day that formerVice President Dan Quayle officially dropped out
of the presidential race this week, U.S.
Senator John McCain officially kicked off
his campaign.
Talk about hope for the future.
Most people in the know think that both
events are pretty irrelevant to the larger
campaign, in which Texas Governor
George W. Bush is running so far ahead
of his opponents (including Al Gore) that
his nomination is all but certain. While it
may be a given that Quayle was wasting
his time all along, many experts believe
that even McCain is conducting an exercise in futility by making his campaign
official.
But there's something to be said for
John McCain, regardless of his standing
in the public opinion polls. In fact, he is
so unique in a roster of ordinary candidates that he may yet pose a formidable
challenge to the George W. Bush camp.

Idle Talk: Chatting on Merlin a waste of time
By Tim Stewart-Winter
For The Phoenix
Lately, I've been refusing messages.
It's nothing personal, I swear, although
from some of the reactions I've gotten
you'd think I'd become a recluse. As in,
Sharpies conversations that begin, "I
tried to talk you this afternoon when you
were in McCabe, but you were refusing
messages."
If you're a frequent user of Merlin, the
UNIX computer operated by the Swarthmore College Computer Society, then
you're probably familiar with this strange
usage of the verb "talk." It refers to a
program that lets you initiate an online
chat with another user who's logged in.
Here, "talk" seems to take a direct object:
I tried to talk you, I was talking her earlier today, etc. When you're "talking"
someone, in other words, you're having a
real-time online conversation: your words
appear in the top half of the screen (including your typos and sometimes network junk), and the other person's responses appear in the bottom half of the

screen.
Before you "talk" someone, of course,
you have to "stalk" them. You see, before
you initiate an online chat with someone,
you have to check to see whether they're
logged in. And while you're at it, you can
find out where they've been logging in
from their dorm, the library, a classroom building, or off campus. Maybe your
friend has been logging in from another
dorm an awful lot recently whose room
could he be spending so much time in?
Or, you might wonder why she's staying
up so late, or logging in so early in the
morning. And so on.
Anyway, what I did recently was
change my Pine email setting so that
when I'm checking my email, I can't receive invitations to chat. It's the cyber
equivalent of unplugging your phone.
Only, imagine that people can see whether
you're sitting by the phone at any given
time.
Why would I turn off such a wonderful
program that has such power to bring
people together? Examples abound of the
invisible role that "talk" sessions play in
Swatties' social lives. After all, I did man-

Maybe it's just me, but try bringing this
issue down to the basics and it seems very
simple, doesn't it? If the government was
so concerned about smoking, why not
regulate it, you ask?
What? Don't they already do that?
After all, was it not the government that
for years has required tobacco companies
to display the Surgeon General's Warning on their products? How can it even
justify launching a suit now when it was
for so many years aware of the medical
dangers associated with smoking?
Aware? Hell! There have been times
when the government and the tobacco
industry have been de facto partners.

age to talk a Swattie friend last January

when I was in a New Delhi cybercafe and
she was in Michigan. We talked again
when she was in Morocco, and again when
she was in Australia. I recently heard
someone tell a story by reading out loud
parts of a transcript of a talk session.
An informal poll of some friends
yielded other interesting talk stories. I've
heard about Swatties using talk to come
out of the closet; in pursuit of romance;
and to tell two other Swatties, who had
met up at a cybercafe in CostaRica, about
a new romantic relationship. "We're
jumping up and down here in the
cybercafe," said one of the faraway "talkers," compensating for the Internet's limitations in the realm of emotional expression. I heard about another Swattie who
used talk in order to gossip with his roommate about someone else who was in the
room at the time. Don't such moments
prove the ability of technology to change
our lives for the better?
I don't think so. Talk is usually procrastination. I've decided that when I'm reading email, I'm reading email, and if someone is going to interrupt me, they're going to have to do it in person. If it's im-

portant enough, they will.
In addition, talk conversations are actually really strange. You feel constantly
under pressure to type something, even
when you don't have anything to say. You
feel the need to make up for the fact that
you can't hear the other person's inflections or tone of voice. You pay attention
to how fast the other person's typing and
whether there's a jam on the network or
a slow connection delaying their words.
And it's easy to get used to these oddities
and incorporate them into your expectations. You learn to write "um" when
you're trying to think of what to say. You
begin to feel like you're having a real conversation.
But it's not the same, I've concluded.
It's strange, disembodied and unsatisfying, and it has the potential to push our
lives in unwelcome directions. I'm no
Luddite, as my email correspondents
know, but I drawthe line at "talk." Though
it has the advantage that it's usually free,
this step into the cyberworld is a step
away from real-life, face-to-face interaction. If you're not in the same state, I'll
be glad to "talk" with you. Otherwise, let's
just plain talk.

Time to address Swat depression problem

Coffee and ibuprofin can be a lethal combination! Ibuprofin may combat the headache that results from drinking the coffee that is needed to stay awake. Nevertheless, the daily overdose ofcaffeine and
drugs may totally damage the nervous
system. At 3 a.m., there is a collective
scream, cry or muttering of utter frustration: "Where have all the hours gone?"
Contrary to the beliefheld by some professors, many Swatties do spend their
time wisely. Occasionally, we may act like
superhuman beings who can stretch the
24 hours of a day even further to make
time for the meetings, the parties, the
sports practices and the jobs.
Oh yes, the jobs,the jobs!—another reason that Swatties are depressed. Some of
us are poor and need to work to pay our
tuition, buy our books, earn enough to do
our laundry from time to time, and maybe
buy a milkshake at Paces. We would love
to work five hours a week if we could earn
enough to meet our financial needs. However, S3O a week is a ludicrous amount
for the type of work a lot of us do. Consequently, we have to double up on jobs and
hours in order to survive. Well, here

on our studies. We are constantly worried
that we are not earning enough to survive
and worried that we don't have enough
time to study. The situation seems so
hopeless sometimes because we are not
earning enough to compensate us for the
possible fall in grades due to inadequate
study time.
In the back of my mind, I can hear an
ongoing chant: "Try time management
workshops... get a SAM... go see psychological services... talk to your professor..."
It is very good advice, but given that
many of us can barely make the time to
sleep or eat properly, setting aside even
more time to go to time management
workshops or to meet with a SAM is a
luxury we cannot afford. There is a certainreluctance to visit psychological services, possibly because the staff may be
too far removed from a Swattie's life to
fully understand and alleviatethe burden
of depression. In many ways, depression
at Swarthmore just begets more depression because the orginal depression affects studies, eating and sleeping habits
and eventually grades slide, pants hug
and you slump even further.
Unfortunately, there is no time available to address depression at Swarthmore. If the workload were reduced and
wage rates were increased, then maybe
the Swarthmore community could find
the time to help its depressed members.

Warning: Farmers at risk
By Ben Schweigert

Agri-markets should be free athletes feel
By Dave Thomas
For The Phoenix

For The Phoenix

My father grew up on a small farm in Wisconsin. My uncle
took over the farm from my grandfather just like my grandfather took it over from his father. My great-grandfather was a

homesteader in North Dakota.

Farming has never been easy and it has never paid well, but
those people who through the years have produced that which
is most essential—food—have created thriving communities and
strong rural culture which are now being swept away along
with the farmers themselves.
The agricultural economy of the U. S. is now in the hands of a
tiny group of multinational corporations who are driving the
family farm and the communities which they support into obsolescence. According to the National Farmers Organization,
the four largest beef packers now control an 83 percent market share, with hog slaughterers at 57
percent, grain port facilities at 59 percent and soybean crushing at 80 percent.

The thresholdfor anti-trust action by
the Justice Department historically has
been 60 percent, but Congress has denied the department the funding necessary to bring action. Virtually no small
businessperson could survive against
these odds, but in a business as subject
to non-market factors as farming
(drought, floods, freezing), the present
situation is prohibitive.
As if the elimination of rural communities weren't enough on its own to merit
action, this concentration of agricultural power is a danger to the food supply. Current farm policy, as set by Congress, relies on a free-market approach
which drives all farmers who are not
immediately necessary for the food supply out of business. But that production
capacity which may be unnecessary in
a year of bumper crops may be essential in a year of drought. Current reserves of corn, wheat, and soybeans are
only enough to last the nation 100 days
if crisis strikes.
But action can still be taken to save
rural America. Immediateaction should
be taken in favor of SenatorWellstone's
(D-Minn.) initiative to temporarily halt
all agri-business mergers over $5O million until anti-trust funding can be restored to the Justice Department and
anti-trust laws strengthened. Furthermore, the government should purchase
enough key commoditiesto create a reasonably-sized grain reserve in case of
tough times. Lastly, the government should assist farmers in
absorbing the shortfalls of bad years to put them on a level
playing field with the large conglomerates. Rural communities
are essential to America and the American way of life and they
must be saved.

Well,

time to dust off the old soapbox to discuss an issue most

of you couldn't care less about. That's right, today's topic is
farming!
Farming, I know, has an immediate and far-reaching effect
upon your everyday life. Yet life would suck pretty bad if one
day you woke up and Sharpies had no food to serve you (think
long-term) because the school could no longer afford to pay
inflated food prices. Or, more likely, you wanted to run down to
the store to buy an apple, or some other produce, only to realize
that apples were now $5 apiece.
While this sounds ridiculous to most of you, this kind of jump
could be possible if my opposite gets his way and the government does away with theFreedom to Farm Act.
Passed in 1996, the Freedom to Farm Act gradually phased
out agricultural supports on both income and price for farmers. Oh, the
poor farmer, you say. How will he
survive? Perhaps a better question
is, What is the government doing
spending your tax money to ensure
that your food costs more? Seems
ironic that the government takes taxpayers' money, then uses it to ensure
that their remaining money buys
them less food. All the FFA did was
remove these price supports, forcing
farmers to compete in the regular
market just like everyone else. Consequently, the price of food dropped
substantially, almost across the
board.
So now, everybody cries and weeps
for the independent family farmer,
whose income has dropped, and far
be it from me to wish ill upon someone who works hard for a living. But
for only farmers to receive enough
government aid that they alone do not
have to compete in the free market
like everyone else does not seem too
sad to me.
Second, look at who has been
helped. Swarthmore's favorite oppressed minority, the poor. That is
right, with the price of food down
sharply, families living at or below
the poverty line now find that their
minimum wage or welfare check
buys almost twice as much food as it
did before. No longer is starvation
their number one worry. Other things
may still be wrong with their situation, but at least they are less likely
to go to bed hungry.
So, it becomes a trade-off: farmers doing a little worse; everyone, especially the bottom of the economic ladder, doing better. Seems like a no-brainer to me. Couple that with a healthy
dose of de-regulation and less government interference in the
private sector, and the answer to me is obvious.

LETTERSTOTHE EDITOR

Radio station plays to the interests of campus
To the Editor:
The WSRN Board of Directors feels
obligated to respond to a number ofinaccurate concerns about our operation
raised in last week's Phoenix by four fellow students ("No one tuning in to

WSRN," Sept. 24).

As we see it, their complaints were

threefold: first, the station programs

music which is beyond the pale of human

listenability—students, they claim,
"refuse to listen." Second, in spite of this,
Budget Committee persists in funding
WSRN. Third, they were not given a talk
show at our station; instead, we scheduled, and continue to schedule, what they
see as "many unappealing shows." These
claims belie a fundamental lack of understanding of WSRN's operations and its

relationship to the student body. We will
address eachof these claims individually.
WSRN's programming is spread across

a wide spectrum of genres and styles,
something apparent from merely looking

at our schedule. Either they think all of

this music is somehow inherently
unlistenable—not only rock, but jazz,
blues, hip-hop, folk, classical and world
music as well—or they've never really
bothered to listen.
They claim students have no interest
in WSRN, but point out at the same time
that 120 people have radio shows this semester. The contradiction here is obvious.
Even if no one listened to WSRN—which
is hardly the case—we wouldremain one
of the largest activities on campus. Our
current level of funding allows the station to operate functionally and provide
radio experience to those interested. A
cut in this funding would seriously undermine WSRN's ability to do so.
It is hard not to wonder whether our
critics' problems with WSRN in general
stem from their third complaint. They
seem to be suggesting that while our subjective taste is highly flawed, their
equally subjective taste carries some

kind of assumed validity. Their complaints about how shows are apportioned—that we might have too few comedic political talk shows, for example—might be better taken up with our Programming Director than with The Phoenix and Budget Committee.

Hurricane also
struck the Lodges
To the Editor:
I just wanted to let you know that your
article on the hurricane was missing some
information. I thought it was interesting

unwelcome
Contrary to popular belief, the football
players and minority students at Swarthmore may have common public relations
problems.
Below I quote student opinions on the
football program as reported in this
semester's first Daily Gazette (Sept. 13).
To make my point, I place words representing racial/ethnic minorities in brackets behind original references to football:
"Football [A minority community] has
been made into an ambassador for athletics in general [Swarthmore College] to
people not involved. I just hope they (admissions) doesn't [sic] admit people just
because they're good at football [minorities], but I also hope they don't admit
people just because they scored a 1600
on their SATs."
"It confirmed a rumor I'd heard that
they took a lot of football players [minorities] out of the reject pile and admitted
them."
"I understand that football [diversity]
is an expensive program, but I feel like
the $20,000 for new jerseys[minority support groups] went to those 40 or 50 people
[340 minority students], and there are
important clubs that never see close to
that amount."
I am deeply disturbed by the parallels
between the public complaints about the
football program and the sometimes-public but often-whispered remarks made
about my class, the class of 2000, during
our freshman year. The class of 2000 was
targeted in particular because we were
the largest entering minority population
in the history of the College.
References to both groups in the quotes
imply an underlying concern that the students admitted were somehow admitted
without considering their whole person,
and their ability to make positive contributions to the College.
Even though the class of 2000 is about
to graduate, we are still considering the
acceptance of our peers into Swarthmore
College under unfair stereotypes. Apparently, large numbers of football jocks and
colored folk upset the Swarthmore
psyche.

Rather than make unproductive remarks like those quoted in The Daily Gazette, we should answer thereal question:
In the context of the history of the College and higher education, what kind of
student community do we want?
My hope is that we have a strong athletic program, in general, because the
athleticism and teamworkthat sports provide enriches the community and uplifts
the lives of the athletes.
I also hope that we can understand
Swarthmore College's part in higher
education's history as a racist institution
that furthered racial and socio-economic
stratification.
Given this, I want this community to
sustain a national project of increasing
access for racial/ethnic minorities and
economically disadvantaged students into
our elite colleges, and providing the most
supportive conditions possible. The College must include the space for intellectualand socialinteraction between people
of different backgrounds, as well as space
for minority and economically disadvantaged students to feel the comfort of being around students with more familiar
identities.
Regardless of what happens to athletics, the history of the College in the Civil
Rights movement and in educating
against all "isms" should make the business of increasing access and support for
racial/ethnic minorities and lower-socioeconomic students at Swarthmore nearly
untouchable.

started gliding down a completely-deserted Yale Avenue, an almost eerie
sense of calm prevailed within the car.
The chatter was idle, but fluid, purely
streams of consciousness. Morris did
most of the talking, jumping from topic
to topic randomly. After pondering a
thought briefly, he started waxing
philosophical.
"Tom Jones," he said, with a tone of
absolute contentment, "is not about the
food." "Tom Jones," he pronounced, "is
a way of life."
Their destination: Tom Jones, land of
the Swarthmore insomniacs. Your generic cholesterol-conscious American
diner, but the 7-Eleven version. Rain
or shine, 365 days a year, twenty-four
hours a day. For the night-owl Swattie,
Tom Jones is a true mecca.
By the time Wu and Morris arrived,
the parking lot was already close to full.
And sure enough, as they stepped into
the dimly-lit interior, the Swarthmore
presence could very much be felt.
There in one corner was Arun Mohan
'OO (a TJ regular), Shreena Gandhi 'Ol
and company. Several tables down
Nick Kourtides and aspiring playright
Chy Spain 'OO were discussing "how
messed up the world is" in between
smokes and sips of coffee.
It was Wu's and Morris' second excursion this week. They consider themselves true TJ veterans. And no one
begs to differ. Asked about his TJ
record, Kourtides replied, "I used to
pull a Morris every day," referring to
Morris' habit of staying at the diner until the wee hours of the morning.
But whether you have been to Tom
Jones or not, the Tom Jones lifestyle is
equally applicable to many a
Swarthmore student.
A Phoenix In-Depth investigation reveals thatwhile chronic sleep deprivation is not prevalent, short spurts of
sleep deprivation are common, and as
at many other colleges across the nation, erratic sleep patterns predominate. A non-scientific poll and over
twenty individual interviews yielded a
more nuanced picture than the popular perception that Swarthmore students simply do not get enough sleep.
Swatties do sleep (surprise!), but
most follow irregular sleep patterns.
For every Swattie who lives and dies
by the Tom Jones creed, there is a
Swattie who would qualify as a model
sleeper. And for every Swattie that is
sleep deprived, there is one that is getting plenty of sleep.
Short-term sleep deprivation, however, does seem to be a norm at
Swarthmore. The battle against periodic sleep deprivation, as student interviews reveal, is alive and well. And
as the battle intensifies, as students become more and more desperate, sleeplessness at Swarthmore oftenbecomes
a prolific source of comic relief.
The reasons behind short-term deprivation, interviews with students, faculty and College deans revealed, are
numerous and multi-faceted. Again,
"too much work" is too simple a generalization to capture the picture. Nor
does the cozy ambience of a Tom Jones
appeal to all students.
Ultimate flexibility
The bottom line is, Tom Jones customer or not, one of the defining characteristics of Swarthmore sleeping
patterns is extreme irregularity.
JeffWu 'Ol, the TJ regular, for example, has class on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and Monday and
Wednesday afternoons. He routinely
stays up until 3:30 or 4:00 in the morning. On Mondays and Wednesdays,
since he doesn't have class in the morning, he can sleep in. But on Tuesdays
and Thursdays he must force himself
out of bed at 9:45, resulting in only
three or four hours of sleep.
Morris is no better, alternating between a few hours of sleep and more
extended periods. Except that Morris

is even more extreme. When he is up,
he is usually up until 7:00 in the morning. After an hour or two of sleep, he is
up again and ready to go.
David Zipper 'OO isn't going to "pull
a Morris" any time soon, but he is not
far behind. Zipper, co-founder of Empowered Painters (EP), a job-creation
program in North Philadelphia, finds
his sleep patterns random as well. Because of the inherent nature ofhis company, Zipper works irregular shifts. In
many cases, he does not know when he
has to leave Swarthmore for work until after midnight the previous day. So
on his day off Zipper might get his average of seven hours at night, and the
next day he might find himself waking
up at 5:30 in the morning after a torturous evening seminar. "When you
wake up before the groundspeople," he
says, obviously displeased by his erratic schedule, "you tend to feel that
there's something
at
wrong
Swarthmore."
But the God of Irregular Sleep is
undoubtedlyKourtides, who used to go
through a half-year cycle of getting
several hours of sleep a day, and then
spend the next half-year recovering.
Morpheus' pets
On the opposite side of the fence,
however, lay just as many students who
flat-out reject the Tom Jones philoso-

phy.

Student-athletes tend to stick to a
more regular schedule. Ambrose
Dieringer 'Ol, a cross-country and
track runner, gets eight hours a night
consistently. "Running tires me out,"
he explained, "and
sleeping helps me

recover."
Dieringer's team-

mate, Marc Jeuland
'Ol, echoes his sentiadding,
ments,
"sleep is awesome."
"My problem may
be too much sleep,"
declares
Lance
'OO.
Langdon
Langdon, thanks
partly to a threecredit load, is getting eight hours a
night as well.
Jerry Melichar 'OO
goes to bed by 1:30
am the latest every
weekday. Melichar, a
light sleeper, as a
freshman,
was
forced to conform to
Morris-like hours
because his roommate kept a much
later schedule. Now,
with the luxury of a
single, the days look
a lot brighter.
Sleep deprived?
The aggregate of
individual experiences and the poll
that
suggests
chronic, long-term
sleep deprivation is
not a widespread
problem.
Out of the 144 students surveyed in
the poll, only 64
(44%) got fewer
hours per day than
they felt
they
needed to function.
Of the twenty-plus
students
interviewed for this article, only three specifically categorized
themselves as sleepdeprived.

Indeed,

even

streaky sleepers like
Morris and Wu, between their normal
sleeping periods
during the week and
catching up on the
weekend, average
out to around 7 to 8
hours per day.
But by any medical standard all

Swatties are intensely sleep deprived.
Experts recommend that adults sleep
for eight hours a day, a near-impossibility at Swarthmore. Sleeping is also
immensely personalized behavior
some students only need three hours
per night; others may need ten. From
a strictly scientific point of view, the
poll probably understates the level of
sleep deprivation on campus.
But ultimately the results also indicated that Swarthmore students are not
a totally unique bunch. Students surveyed slept an averageof 6.3 hoursper
weekday, only slightly less than the
1999 national average of 6 hours and
58 minutes recorded by the 1999 Omnibus Sleep in America Poll, administered by the American Sleep Foundation.And Swatties are not super-human
either
the average hours of sleep
needed to function by the students surveyed was a reasonable 7.3 hours, again
only slightly less than the recommended time.
College officials confirm this finding. "It's not an issue that has produced
tangible consequences," said Associate
Dean of the College for Student Life
Tedd Goundie. Serious sleeping deprivation, along the lines of sleeping disorders, are not common at
Swarthmore, according to Linda
Echols, Director of the Worth Health
Center.
Surviving deprivation
But for Swatties from Kourtides to
the well-rested Langdon, staying up
late, or pulling one of those infamous
Swarthmore all-nighters
to write thatcrucial paper
or study for a big exam, is
a near-universal experience.
Surviving those seemingly never-ending nights,
needless to say, can become an extremely frustrating experience.
Recalling an occasion
when he drifted in and out
of sleep while trying to finish an assignment, Wu's
distaste was apparent.
"Waking up [in that situation] is the worst feeling,"
he said. "You're not motivated but you have to
wake up]... so you end up
walking around with your
eyes half closed."
Burning the midnight
oil was never up Zipper's
alley. "At 2 A.M. I just
don't get the Plato," says
Zipper. "I could be reading
the Philadelphia Inquirer
magazine and I wouldn't
be able to tell the difference."
And combating sleepdeprivation has never
)een a piece of cake. Besides the standard caffeine-ingestion methods,
Swatties experiment with
a range of strategies, from
smoking incessantly to
doing push-ups.
Perhaps the most inventive idea comes from Mike
Klunder 'Ol. In addition to
the standard operating
procedures, Klunder likes
to play tricks with his own
mind. "I try reminding
myself of how fucking
dead I'll be if I don't get
my work done," he said.
'ln other words, stress
ceeps me awake."
But the marginal utility
of innovation is diminishing, and in the end, the routine techniques seem to
work best. "Push-ups, and
aking breaks, help to
ceep you awake and efficient," reflected Tim
3effernan 'OO, "but the
fact is at a certain point
you have to feed yourself
chemicals."
As an antitode against
sleep deprivation in general, naps also tend to
work well for many

Swarthmore students. "The af-

Everyone, however, hits the point
when nothing seems to work and your
brain decides to take a hiatus. A major
one.
"When you're up all night, there's a
time when everything seems funny,"
muses Langdon. "People say the stupidest things and you laugh for ten minutes."
Cathy Muller 'OO has had it worse.
On one of hermany sleepless freshman
nights, Mullerrecalls, she stepped into
her shower and turned on the water,
only to realize several seconds later
that she had forgotten to take off her
clothes.
Katie Surrence 'O2 remembers the
time she fell asleep in lab and started
dreaming about Baskin-Robbins icecream. After she woke up, while her
lab partner was reading out loud two
data points, she recalls thinking, "35,
39? Those aren't ice cream flavors."
Guilt without sleep
Tuesday, September 28, 8:30 a.m.
While the 8:30 bell is still ringing from
the belltower, several students straggle
into Dupont 139 for Physics 6. As Prof.
JohnBoscio begins to explain the Doppler Effect and the Twin Paradox, the
majority of students in the class of 25
participate in the discussion and take
notes, but some stifle yawns and stare
at the chalkboard with glazed eyes.
"Yup, that would be me today," responds Laurel Eckhouse 'O3, one of the
dozers, when asked if she is sleep-deprived.
While sleeplessness can be a tremendous source of agony for students, they
are not the only ones affected. The
quality of a classroom experience, for
both the teacher and the students, is
directly related to the level of focus
students provide. And when sleep is in
short supply, the teaching and learning processes are both compromised.
Sociology/Anthropology Professor
Bruce Grant tends to notice sleepiness
in his earlier classes. And while he
"doesn't take it personally," he doesn't
like it to happen more than once. "It's
demoralizing for the other students,"
he said, "it brings down the energy, the
tempo [of the class], dragging everyone down."
English Professor Tom Blackburn
has similar complaints. Many students
eat breakfast in his 8.30 or 9.30 classes.
By the third or fourth week of the semester, he observes attendance declines as students begin to pull allnighters. Those students who come to
class despite inadequate sleep tend to
"zone out." Sleep deprivation has also
affected Blackburn's seminars, since
many of his students who have stayed
up all night finishing papers are less
able to participate in seminars.
On Tuesday, Psychology Professor
Jeannine Pinto could barely hold her
ground in her 1:15 developmental psy-

chology class.
Since there was a
paper due that day, most
dents, Pinto reported, wei

Experts say sleep deprivation poses numerous health risks

Deterioration

of immune system,

By Min Lee
Phoenix Staff
The tremendous emotional trauma

aside, sleep deprivation has tangible

health consequences, health professionals say.
According to Dr. Rima Himelstein, a
pediatrician at Crozer Chester Medical Center who also works at the College, lack of sleep affects our immune
system and mood.
"Your immune system might not be
able to fight off symptoms you normally could," she says. Lack of sleep
also makes us feel more "irritable and
depressed." Our attention span also
starts to diminish, suggests Dr.

heightened irritability, and depression cited as side effects

Himelstein.
The number of visits to the Worth
Health Center, do in fact increase during times of intense sleep deprivation
and stress, such as midterm and finals
weeks, according to Health Center Director Linda Echols. In fact, Echols
points out, the college timed Fall Break
so as to allow suffering students a
chance to catch a breather when they
need it the most.
And frequently standard measures
used to alleviate sleepiness, such as
drinking coffee, end up aggravating
the symptoms. "After you caffeinate,
you get more jittery and irritiable,"
said Dr. Himelstein. "It's a viscous
cycle."

A study completed two years ago by
two Bradley University psychology
professors revealed that College students who are not sleep-deprived
those who get eight hours of sleep or
more
are happier, less hostile, less
fatigued than students who are. The
former group also performed better
than the latter on a standardized cognitive test.
While sleep deprivation does not
pose any serious medical risks, the
symptoms that sleepiness produce can
in turn give rise to other dangerous
secondary side-effects. A recent
Stanford study concluded that sleep
deprivation results in a state similar to
drunkenness.

Besides simply getting a good night's
sleep, experts have found that so-called
"power naps" can effectively reduce
the impact of sleep deprivation.
The key, according to Barbara Duffy,
a sleep technician at the Crozer Sleep
Disorders Center at Taylor Hospital, is
to sleep no more than twenty minutes.
If you exceed 20 minutes, Duffy says,
"your body will think that you're going to sleep again." Students should feel
free to take even more than one power
nap a day, Duffy suggests.
But if all fails, as Duffy puts it, students just "have to put that beer bottle
down and go to bed."
In Swarthmore-speak, it's "put that
book down."

Elkins dance to premiere Saturday
By Gabriel Hankins
For The Phoenix

«™uß6
Dawson's Creek
an addictive
teen drama
I said I wasn't going to, but then I did. I
watched the "Dawson's Creek" third season premiere on Wednesday. I tended to
talk to the screen the whole way through
because there was something I couldn't
handle about just sitting there and taking
it. I am a great and avid viewer of shitty
television—l watch —but there is something about "Dawson's" that keeps me
coming back week after week, weirdly
ambivalent, feeling all dirty with delight
and disgust. Every Thursday I say, "I'm
off the sauce," and every Wednesday I
came crawling back on my hands and
knees, the remote in my mouth like a bit.
"Dawson's Creek" in its first season was
a glossy mix of sincerity and sensationalism. With its long winded expositions of
Speilbergian coming-of-age angst and an
irresistible teacher-sleeps-with-Pacey
subplot, it gave us equal helpings of controversy and near-complexity. This little
ditty about four kids from Capeside was
more than just "90210" with a thesaurus
and without the moral conscience.
"Dawson's" took as its patron saint John
Hughes, the pop psychologist of mixedup teenage insides, rather than Aaron
Spelling, the geister of zeit. Sure, it was
just another product of the millennial
moment of the Teen Demographic, a craze
I love that gave us things I hate:
Shakespeare splendidly selling out to high
school romances, boy bands from Orlando
who were genetically engineered like
Serpentor from the skin particles and
hairstyles of all the boy bands that had
come before them, Ryan Phillipe. But
"Dawson's Creek" had a sappy self-consciousness thatseemed at once deeply felt
and innocently ironic. The actors were J.
Crew beautiful, vaguely resembled the
ages they were playing, and spoke many
syllables, not always well but earnestly.
It was trying, and hard. Totally over the
top, it left you aghast but into it, to paraphrase a friend.
The second season was damnnear catastrophic withthe introduction of plot. Plot
has killed many a show whose bread and
butter is bullshitting about heartbreak.
Eventually one of two things happen, or
both: incest sets in like atrophy and the
characters start to play an ugly game of
musical embrace, or we get stuck with the
grafting on of contrived story arcs. Last
season saw death, divorce, mental illness,
promiscuity, drug dealing dads, arson,
police stings, coming out, sadistic teachers, gratuitous Madchen Amick, and
umpteen Joey-Dawson breakups. Critics
and fans alike bemoaned how it was becoming like "Melrose Place" but that was
way off. "Melrose" had a real catfight glee
to it but "Dawson's" never saw the humor
in its stupid-convoluted plotting and became at once unbearably self-serious and
self-parodying.
I'm happy to report that after a year of
too-much plot Wednesday's season premiere was mostly just about sex. A plot
line that involved turning Dawson's house
into a strip club to pay for his dad's bustedup boat managed to rip off "Field of
Dreams" and "Risky Business" all in one
fell swoop. Eve, Dawson's mysterious new
love interest, had a body temperature that
runs a few degrees high just like Marilyn
Monroe in "The Seven Year's Itch" and
likes to perform oral sex on speed boats.
There was a superfluous mention of "the
vida loca." Katie Holmes took her shirt
off twice. Like everybody in the their junior year of high school, the show's got

niques laying the lines,
Swarthmore College and the
Fringe Festival paying the dues
and sheer physicality greasing the
rails, the Doug Elkins Dance Company
is taking the train into town— the
"Train to Philly," that is.
This Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Lang
Performing Arts Center there will be
a premiere of"Train to Philly," the first
dance ever commissioned by
Philadelphia's Fringe Festival for the
arts and supported by Swarthmore
College through the Cooper Foundation series.
The Doug Elkins Dance Company
is a well-recognized troupe specializing in what they call "the creation of possibilities rather than
jm
the forming of actualities." In
this new work commissioned
jjM
jointly by Swarthmore College and the Philadelphia mmK^ m
Fringe Festival, the possibilities that are being
revolve
created
around the music of Philadelphia.
With the poise of classical and modern repertory training, the troupe will
be disassembling the classic Philly
sounds of soul, funk and jazz, as well
as playing withthe sounds ofclassical
music and Sinead O'Connor in the
other two dances on the program,
"Narcoleptic Lovers" and "In Winter,
Stand".
The project was initiated by Nick
Stuccio, producer of the Fringe Festival.
"I wanted to make a name for the
festival," he said. "[I wanted] to make
it unique."
Stuccio desired a next-wave choreographer to make a piece that would
be innovative and at the same time
reflect the setting of the festival and
appeal to its audience.
"I chose Elkins because his work is
provocative and at the same time very
accessible," Stuccio said.
Susan Smythe, managing director of
the Lang Performing Arts Center, coordinated with the festival to arrange
the appearance and the funding by the
Cooper Foundation.
"I wanted to make connections between the Fringe and Swat, to be help-

ful and also to create something that
would fit in here," she said. "[Elkins'
work] is very enjoyable, and definitely not
just for dance people."
Doug Elkins got his start in the field
as a break-dancer, touring with the
groups Magnificent Force and New York
Dance Express before graduating from
the State University of New York. He
worked with Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane and
other experimental companies before
starting his own nonprofit dance company eleven years ago. Elkins has been
awarded grants and support from the National Endowment for the Arts and many
other public and private organizations,
as well as being awarded a "Bessie" (the
New York Dance and Performance
Award) for "walking the walk as well as
talking the talk, not to mention utterly
tanking what's left of post-modern pretension, all the while fashioning singular provocative poetics of dancing."
Elkins and the company now alternate
between teaching master classes at universities, and doing international tours
and new projects. He also collaborates
with theater groups such as the Guthrie,
ballet companies such as the Pennsylvania Ballet, and with film for public television.

The company has a reputation for
mixing many popular dance styles,
while at same time forming a coherent whole in each piece. The Village
Voice describes the style during one
of the company's stays in New York:
"Juicy and daredevil choreographic
gambits. In among the slashing legs,
the tumbles in and out of upended
break-dance maneuvers, the tight-cool
manners, Elkins slips moments of lyricism and tenderness."
The company also works playfully,
as seen with a glance at the titles of
past works: "Bite the Wax Tadpole" (a
de-constructed hula danced to the
music of the Royal Tahitian Ballet),
"The Patrooka Variations" (flamenco
and break dance parody of the macho
world), "Where Was Yvonne Rainer
When I Had Saturday Night Fever?"
(a tribute to disco days and teenage
angst), and "Bipolarbear NOS" (a play
on a psychiatric diagnosis).
However, the company's highest
praise came from Susan Smythe: "My
kids loved it they actually stayed interested the whole way through."
When you've got both kids and critics on your side, you know something
must be going right.

First Friday gallery openings an exciting,
inexpensive weekend alternative
By Hillary Dresser
For the Phoenix
Friday night for a Swattie can be frustrating. We want to celebrate the close of another week, but after a few Fridays at
Swat, the options begin to feel repetitive and drab. Elbowing
our peers viciously to get to the bar at Paces loses its raucous,
free-for-all appeal. Hopping the bus to Springfield's cinema does
not seem so exotic anymore. Hanging out amid the stinking
carpets and fluorescent lights of the typical dorm, despite potentially good company, eventually starts to feel downright

depressing.
Well, chin up: this Friday there is an altogether differentoption. This Friday, invite your friends to accompany you into
Old City Philadelphia, where the art galleries will remain open
into the night for the neighborhood's monthly "First Friday." If
you dare to hop the main line into Market East station tonight,
you will be rewarded with a refreshing alternative to the usual
Friday night routine.
First Friday gets started around 6 or 6:30 p.m. The tram is
usually the best way to get into Old City, but if you intend to
drive, the best time to find parking is as early as possible. Once
you're in the city, all of the galleries are located within the ten

district. There are the standard commercial galleries, like
The Clay Studio and Nexus, both on Second Street, which
tend to hold exhibit openings on First Friday and cater to an
older, more sophisticated, art-buying crowd. There you can
stroll through the exhibits, partake of wine and cheese, and
engage in highbrowed conversation with gallery managers
and established artists.
Other galleries cater to younger people particularly. Such
galleries, like Lockjaw on Third Street, will also hold exhibit
openings, but they tend to throw more down-to-earth parties
that attract a younger crowd. Dave Duszak, a Lockjaw employee, explained a bit about the gallery's guiding principle:
"We're geared toward younger minds, rather than younger
people." He went on to explain thatthe gallery's name, "Lockjaw," is a jab at the stereotypical, conservative galleries for
which Old City has a reputation. "We're making fun of the
stiff people...who comment on art through locked jaws" he
explained. Lockjaw usually has a couple of bands playing
throughout the night as well.
Another more accessible gallery is the Painted Bride Art
Center on Vine Street. The gallery always features exhibits
by fringe artists. However, the Bride is most wellknown for
hosting a spoken word open mic every First Friday, called
"Word Wide First Friday." The event begins at 10pm and admission is $5. This Friday, the featured reader will be Rich
Medina, an esteemed local poet.

For fall break, step into child's world
Rawling's imaginative literature a quick, glorious read for Swatties

'I Dream ofYou'
a beautiful,
seamless story

Harry's best friends Ron and Hermione,
Harry's enemies, the Hogwarts professors and many more—a cast of dozens.
All this cannot overshadow one all-important fact, though: the books are just so
damn well-written that they are a joy to
read.
I suppose I still haven't answered the
question, "Why should Swarthmore studentsread books that are essentially written for elementary schoolers?" They are
a fast read. Each can be read in a single
sitting—three or four hours would do it.
They are enjoyable as they are—you don't
have to be an education major analyzing
patterns in childhood reading preferences or anything. You don't have to be a
SWIL-ie, either, if you're willing to get into
the spirit. I think it's just a more fulfilling thing to do over break than staring at
infomercials for hours on end.
I'dlike to read the "Harry Potter" books
out loud to my kids one day. If I want to
be Dad and not just their father, I'm going to have to know how he, she or they
feel. This is why, in the final analysis, I'm
getting hooked at 19 on books meant for
those a decade younger. I want to know
why they smile, and the only way I can
dothat is to keep on knowing why I smile.

Barry's trademark humor blesses fiction effort
By Jeff Druchniak
Michigan Daily (U. Michigan)
(U-WIRE)
There will be some interest, rest assured, in Dave Barry's new
novel "Big Trouble." Barry has already
assured that he will be staying off food
stamps for the foreseeable future, thanks
to his nationally syndicated, Pulitzer
Prize-winning humor column for the Miami Herald. Barry's long list ofbooks also
includes a fistful of best-sellers. But in
this case, interest does not insure purchase of Barry's debut as a novelist.
The fact is, no matter how much one
may be amused by reading Barry, he
doesn't necessarily come across in print
as someone mentally balanced enough to
sustain a few hours of civility in your living room some evening, let alone the disciplined creative effort required to oxygenate a fully formed, full-fledged fictional landscape.
But judging from "Big Trouble," it
turns out Barry sometimes takes his
medication after all.
For a first-time effort, "Big Trouble" is
crafted and conceived well enough to satisfy any architect, if that architect was
well enough armored not to mind the literary roller derby that is the mind of

Barry.
Barry's fans need not have fear. Just

because the baby-boomer poster boy for

the lifelong mid-life crisis has focused on
ps task enough to keep his plot interest-

By Dann Naseemullah
For The Phoenix
One of the things I most hate about being in college is the fact that most of us,
certainly including myself, take ourselves way too seriously. We are unambiguously not children any more, and that,
in my humble opinion, is dangerous to the
part of us that shouldremain from childhood, hopefully for the rest of our lives.
Steps actually have to be taken to protect
our memory of not just our childhood but
what it is in essence to be a child.
That does not mean needing to behave
in a childlike fashion mixed in with the
strange sexual connotations that only college students other than myself understand. It does mean that we, in the words
of the great Native American prayer,
"walk around in their moccasins" for a
while, then make it a lifetime habit.
Would you believe that all that was a
prelude to a book recommendation? I
have made this little dabble into the Living section from my comfortable column
in Opinions to urge any and all of you
reading this to read the "Harry Potter"
books by Joan K. Rowling over fallbreak.
The three books Rowling has published
so far are, in order, "Harry Potter and the
Philosopher's Stone," "Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets" and "Harry Potter and the Prisoner from Azkaban." Four
books are to follow over the next few
years. I read all three in several glorious
hours in the spare bedroom of my
grandmother's flat in Hampstead, north
London during August. Thesebooks managed to transport me back to a world
where I was still eleven, and I was able to
savor the books as an eleven-year-old
would. Yes, they are that good.
The basic premise of the series, on the
covers and jacket flaps of the books, is
that Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old boy,
is a Wizard studying at Hogwarts, the best
school of wizardry in the world, located
in (where else?) England. Harry must,
through his years at Hogwarts, come to
grips with a powerful and scary heritage,
become strong enough to follow his convictions, deal with friends and enemies
and battle evil once in a while. It is a basic rite-of-passage series ofbooks of a kid
in a fantastical world.
There is a lot more to that, however.
Rowling has a gift at creating an intricate
and complex world and equally intricate
and complex characters: Harry himself,

JANE LIU

BOOK REVIEW
life on our home planet.
It helps that Barry sets his madcap tale
in a setting he has intimate familiarity
with, his home of Miami, Florida.
The novel's skeletal framework is that
of a caper-story crime novel reminiscent
of Elmore "Dutch" Leonard or fellow
Miami native Carl Hiaasen. But whereas
those authors spike their gritty crime
landscape with humor, Barry has spiked
his hallucinations with crime.
And though reading Barry can seem
like madness, don't fool yourself into
thinking that there isn't a method in it.
From the opening pages, which are centered around a homeless man named
Puggy and the ludicrous (yet logical, considering society's schizophrenic disposition towards its homeless) concerns that
occupy his day, Barry never gets nutty
without enclosing satiricalbite inside the
shell.
Some recurring themes will be familiar to Barry's readers: Dogs are dumber
than rocks; absolutely everyone in Miami,
including kindergartners, is probably
armed; all music recorded after 1977 is
offensive sacrilege.
Some new angles of the Barry
worldview emerge from the depiction of
protagonist Elliot Arnold, a divorced dad
who has quit his job writing for the Miami Herald in hilarious fashion.
Based on the acidity with which the
Herald is described, Elliot's course of
action is one that Barry no doubt has fantasized duplicating.
Elliot finds himself a journalistic pariah

and struggles to stay solvent running an
independent ad agency consisting of himself.
Most of Elliot's clients either have little
intention of paying for Elliot's services
or berate him for incorporating insufficient cleavage in their copy.
Suffice to say that Elliot and his teenage son get mixed up with the world's
most satanic building contractors, mob
hitmen and the indescribable Puggy, easily Barry's most memorable character.
Barry's inexperience with the novel
form is not completely concealed. He falls
back once or twice too often on his fieldtested bag of tricks.
More disappointingly, he wastes ink and
kills trees with a lamely predictable romantic subplot that is as beneath Barry's
standards as JuliaRoberts was above Lyle
Lovett's.
Barry does show a previously unearthed knack for bantering dialogue, but
he has a long way to go to reach the lofty
territory of Dutch Leonard.
Every so often, he sinks into gimmicks
worthy of a quickly-cancelled sitcom; for
example: four people standing in a room
utter the same banality except for the last,
who yells at the dog for sticking its nose
in her crotch.
Barry would be a promising young novelist if he were young. As it is, it seems
likely that his golden goose over in the
nonfiction shelves will keep him from
devoting himself to realizing the potential as a comic novelist he shows in "Big
Trouble."
This book will deliver a fun couple of
hours, and sometimes it's wise to quit
while you're ahead.

"Nobody's interested in what two girls
from Houston do!"
Nothing, as far as I'm concerned, could
be further from the truth if the two girls
happen to be Francine Peters and Katina
Choovanski, a.k.a. Katchoo. Two weeks
ago, I promised something spandex-free;
you don't really get any "freer" than SIP.
There are no Barbie- or Ken -proportioned, spandex-clad women and men
here. No sir-ee. This is realism, but in
black and white. I Dream of You continues the story started in the three-issue
premiere volume of SIP, The Collected
(Complete) SIP. The ongoing series revolves aroundFrancine and Katchoo, who
have been best friends since high school.
Now, in their mid-twenties, Francine
works at an unspecified job, Katchoo is a
talentedbut undiscovered artist, and their
mutual friend David is just too good to be
true. Pretty much, they're just trying to
live their lives one day at a time, relying
heavily on each other to get through all
the good, the bad, and the ugly.
I Dream of You begins with Katchoo
returning home to Houston after two
months. Francine and David await her
arrival eagerly, since she had left without telling anyone where the heck she was
going. That issue is resolved early into
the story, but not before more mysteries
introduce themselves —like, who is Mrs.
Darcy Parker? And why has she hired
someone to followKatchoo's every move?
Well, even as we're trying to figure all of
that out, the story moves along an emotional roller-coaster, hilarious at times,
and reaching-for-the-kleenex at others.
In one segment, Katchoo must deal with
the fact that a friend from the past is dying fromAIDS. In another, Francine must
endure a visit from her mother, her
mother's yip-yip dog, and her tipsy Uncle
"Where's the Bar?" Maury. And between
those two scenes, David finds time to tell
Katchoo that he's falling in love with her.
Her response? She slaps him. Hard. And
then she kisses him. Upon questioning
from Francine, Katchoo responds:
"Look, I kiss my cat too! That doesn't
mean I want to marry him!"
"And that's another thing, you're always saying 'my cat this', 'my cat that'.
Katchoo, we don't have a cat!"
"We don't?"
"Giggle! No!"
"Oh damn. I could've swore we had a
cat."
Moore is able to weave together all of
these segments into a beautiful, seamless
story. Worthy ofnotice is that before delving into comics, Moore was a musician,
and thus, his work is infused with lyrics,
which he uses as inspiration, dialogue,
and artwork. He also uses original poetry
and prose in between panels of artwork;
basically, he's willing to try unconventional methods in order to get his meaning across.
What impresses me the most about
Moore's work is theresponse it gets from
women. I love SIP, but I'm also one of
those eccentric women who likes X-Men,
Batman, and other "costumed freaks." So,
maybe SIP just falls in line with my other
eccentricities. But no. Over and over
again, I hear of women who, once quite
skeptical of reading a comic book, fell in
love with SIP, all the while wondering, "if
Terry Moore is a guy, how the heck does
he know so much about women—their
friendships, depressions, and relationships?" I think the key to answering this
question lies in the inscription at the start

Hi

'Blue Streak' convinces jaded comedy-hater
By Morghan Holt
For The Phoenix

MOVIE REVIEW
II

I'm not much for comedies. I generally find them tasteless, tedious, and, frankly, not all that funny. Nor am I a
big Martin Lawrence fan. Ordinarily, he bores me to
death with his wannabe-ness —playing next to Eddie
Murphy in "Life," for example.
I make a point of not watching comedy films because,
basically, they are a waste of my time. Their aim is to
provoke laughter, but in my experience, it rarely works.
"Ace Ventura," "Austin Powers," and the slew of nameless characters whose movies topped the box office fell
short with me. I found them more painfully ridiculous
than comically entertaining. Martin Lawrence's role as
Miles Logan in "Blue Streak," however, had me rolling.
Chuckles, giggles, guffaws, and sidesplitting laughs
poured incessantly from me almost as soon as
Lawrence's face filled the screen.
The plot, while at times lacking and a bit farfetched,
was original and workable.Lawrence's Logan, a skilled
jewelry thief, successfully made his way past the stereotypical lard-assed, donut-gobbling bank guards and
snagged a rock worth sl7 million. Unfortunately, he
hadn't anticipated the greed of his partners in crime.
As bank robbers tend to be, they're unashamedly dishonest guys, whose idiocy and avarice score Lawrence
a couple of years in jail. Before his arrest, however,
Martin manages to stash his diamond in what he believes
to be a safe spot.
Finally freed, Miles Logan heads out, psyched to re-

trievehis sl7 million. To his alarm, his safe hiding place
had transformed into a police station during his twoyear imprisonment. Determined to regain the stolen
rock, Lawrence disguises himself as a pizza delivery boy
and scopes out the inside of the station, paying special
attention to the heating ducts, where the diamond was
originally hidden. Finally, he devises a plan to infiltrate
the building and leave with the diamond in hand. This

master plan involves kingpin crook Miles Logan becoming an LAPD detective. But not just any detective —the

head detective.
In the process of reclaiming his prized jewel, Logan is
sidetracked by his lamebrained partner, a slew of officers who are so impressed with his resume that they
refuse to leave him alone (thereby denying him the time
needed to climb into the heating system, snag the diamond, andbe out), and surprise encounters with former
cronies.
Throughout the movie, Lawrence's hilarious antics and

movie

convincing impersonations provide gut-busting amusement. This uproarious performance as a true "bad cop"
not only earned Lawrence his first major film an upper
slot at the box office, it also proved that he's not all
washed up. "Blue Streak" is an outrageous comedy that
accommodates the major gripe of most anti-comedy
moviegoers: it maintains a decent plot for all of its 90minute running time. Though by no means thoughtprovoking, the show is stillworth seeing. If nothing else,
it provides Swatties, jadedby tough classes and stressed
about their activities, a little mindless amusement and
a good, hard laugh.

Lambskin condoms not safe
Dear Dr. Feelgood,
I read the article "Burning rubber: road-testing condoms for a
safer America" in the Sept. 10 issue of The Phoenix. Before I leap
into bed with a lambskin condom on I wanted to check with you
first. Is Brad Keller, who judged lambskins to be an 8.2 on the Dikter
scale, truly the sexpert he claims to be?
Sincerely,
Rubber Burner, but Healthy
Dear Rubber Burner,
I'm glad that you asked this question. My thumb points down.
Way down. Brad Keller gave advice that is anything but safe.
Despite the light humor of the article, our "road-tester" is making a dangerous mistake. Lambskin condoms, or "Naturalambs" as
the product is called, do not provide complete protection. This natural membrane condom has microscopic pores that do allow the HIV
virus to penetrate in the fluids that seep through.
But there is hope for those who long for the raw. One thing that
Keller forgot is the female condom. This condom goes inside the
body to line the vagina or anus. For vaginal use, a ring fits into the
cervix and holds the condom in place. The female condom is made
of polyurethane, an excellent alternative for those with a latex allergy. Also, there is no need for another condom. In fact, "doubling
up" can cause friction that increases chance of condom breakage.
The feeling is quite natural, like the natural folds of the body. It
enables a pleasurable experience for both partners.
Safe sex is not only about birth control. That is only part of the
story. The issue of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) should
demand your attention if you are sexually active. This is especially
true in the case of our energetic tester, who has tried products with
different partners. Remember, what you choose to do is up to you,
but please choose to do it safely.
The Sexpert you can trust,
Dr. Feelgood

MichaelBiello emphasized, "Art
doesn't need to be cold and separate."
According to Helen Ziga of
Zone One, a cooperative gallery
on Second Street, the fall is a
particularly festive time for
First Friday. "We're getting
more and more crowds; the
streets are jam-packed. Fall is
especially rowdy and...fun," she
said. Recently, First Friday has
been a forum for impromptu
street performances and parades.

Biello described the appeal of
First Friday, which has been happening for as long as he can remember: "When you're spending
time in a creative space, anything is possible...especially [if
you're] open to something magical happening."
This Friday, when you're itching to reward yourself for your

out and catch up with friends,
absorb as much or as little culture as you want, and meet a few

I mean.
PS. All this brings up a big pet
peeve of mine about teen shows.
Tune in to any teen soap or
sitcom any night of the week
and you'll see this familiar
scene: two kids are kissing, possibly for the first time, and one
of them says, "Stop, I'm not
ready to have sex yet." Such is
the mindset of these shows, that
there's nothing between making
out and going all the way, be-

tween the first kiss and the big
V, as they say in the parlance of
the times.
I mean, what kind of television
show summarily dismisses the
huge monster importance of second and third base? Most high
schoolers have freaking time
shares on second and third base,
they spend so long stuck there.
Whatever happened to realism,
people?
What I want to see is a very
special episode that spends an
hour belaboring Dawson's first
time getting up girl's shirt. That
would be something to see.

Football faces uphill battle Saturday against Ursinus
Blowout bss to Gettysburg a 'wake-up call
By Justin Kane
Phoenix Staff
Don't look now, but another
losing streak is looming large
over the Swarthmore Garnet
Tide.
With last Saturday's 55-8 loss
to Gettysburg College, the Garnet Tide fumbledaway an opportunity to break what is now a 25game Centennial Conference losing streak.
Unfortunately for Swarthmore, breaking the streak at 26
at Ursinus College Saturday will
not be as easy as defeating
Oberlin.
Ursinus sports a high-flying
passing game that managed to
put a scare into nationallyranked No. 8 Western Maryland,
coming within eight points in the
third quarter before falling 3615. The attack is led by quarterback Frank Vecchio, who completed 20 of 36 passes last Saturday for 197 yards, and wide receiver Kory Stauffer, who
caught seven passes for 75
yards.
Yet according to Swarthmore
running back Ken Clark 'O3, who
ran for 64 yards and scored the
touchdown
only
against
Gettysburg, the Garnet Tide
won't be intimidated.
"Last week was a wake-up call
for us," Clark said. "Ursinus will
be tough, but we had a very good
week of practice and we're getting ourselvesback on a winning

9

streak."
Unlike last week, when head
coach Pete Alvanos implemented changes in the defensive
schemes to compensate for injuries, the Garnet Tide has spent
this week regaining its focus.
"Coach Alvanos told us that it's
up to us to make the changes,"
Clark said. "We spent extra time
this week to put everyone on the
same page and really focused on
making some basic improvements."
Clark and quarterback Scott
Murray 'Ol are looking to jumpstart a struggling offense that
will be further handicapped by
the loss of tight end Charlie Ellis
'OO, who suffered a broken hand
against Gettysburg. The Garnet
Tide was held to a paltry 136
yards of total offense against the
Bullets.
"We're a pretty young team,
how to
and we're still
execute week in and week out,"
said Clark.
The defense also faces a stiff
challenge this week after being
scorched by Gettysburg fullback Paul Smith for 264 rushing
yards and four touchdowns.
Linebackers Joe Corso 'O2 and
Axel Nef f 'O2 will have to repeat
their 13- and 10-tackle performances to shut down an Ursinus
team that posted 15 points
against a Western Maryland defense that shut out Gettysburg.
The game starts at 1 p.m. at
Ursinus College.

regulation time, sending the
game into overtime. However,
Ursinus scored a last-minute
goal to prevail towards the end
of the extra period, running
Swarthmore's record to 2-8.
Jacob Hodes scored the team's
only goal on a diving header in
the first half, putting the Garnet
on top until Ursinus buried the
equalizer minutes later.

Garnet runners victorious over Leb
Valley, Allentown, Muhlenberg, alumni
By

Josh Bloom, Michael Evans and

Joseph Makin
For The Phoenix

At last weekend's Swarthmore Home-

coming Race, over forty male and female

alumni ran as no alumni had run before.

But the current Swat runners generated
an impressive racing enterprise which
gave the team an undefeated dual meet
season for the first time in a century.
With the crowd roaring at the women's
start, the Swat femme-fatales launched
themselves across the often-treacherous
home course with intrepid speed. They
cut their way through Crumhenge and
down the fan-lined paths around Sharpies,
always making sure that the Lebanon Valley, Allentown, and Muhlenberg runners
stayed well behind them. Throwing herself across the finish-line first was Joko
Agunloye 'Ol in a time of 19:00. Karen
Lloyd 'OO light-sped through the course
in 19:42, executing a fourth-place finish.
Alissa Parmelee 'Ol and Alicia Googins
'OO searched for and destroyed the competition-like birds of prey, capturing Bth
and 9th place in 20:26 and 20:27 respectively. Pounding the Earth like a deluge
out of Genesis, Christen Lungren 'O2 entered the shoot with a 20:58 while Jessica
George 'OO passed through with a 22:16.
Rounding out the top seven Swatties,
Loring Pfeiffer 'O2 shot across the finish
on a rush of impulse power that gave her
a 22:18.
What inspired Pfeiffer—and the rest of
the team —was a pheromone-emanating
icon, the Nevin Head (based on the beatific countenance of Nevin Katz '99).
Long ago, when it underwent the "seven
sacraments of Katz," this larger-than life
poster acquired speed-endowing powers.
And, indeed, Pfeiffer and other-women
wafted in the pheromones and breathed
out essence of "Katzastrophic" momen-

a 27:50. Inspired by the multitudinous inter-galactic emanations, Josh Bloom 'OO
and Sam Evans 'Ol closed out the Swat
top seven in 28:01 and 28:31. Obviously
Swarthmore cross-country set a course
for victory and achieved it.
After the race, coach Luci Rosalia
asked the team to disassemble the Nevin
head. But veteran Evans spat back,
"Damn it, Luci, I'm a runner, not an engineer." The joke was to be on Rosalia; at
the present moment, the Nevinhead emanates pheromones in her own office. The
cross-country saga continues this Satur-

day at Frostburg.

tum.

But the men's team also inhaled. Marc
Jeuland 'Ol was so engrossed in his
runner's high that he engaged the
hyperdrive and warped to a first place
finish in 26:26. Harnessing the all-pervasive Nevin-chi, CaptainLiam O'Neill 'OO
transcended slow mortals with a 26:46.
Marc Niermann 'Ol ran a logical and methodical race of 27:24, finishing 7th. Joe
Makin 'O3, in his first year in the centennial conference, torpedoed foes and captured a 27:45. Captain Jeff Doyon 'OO
broke out a six-pack of whoop-ass on anyone who tried to cling to him, cruising to

Men's Ultimate team emerges from weekend as fourth-place college team in tri-state area
By Matt Murphy
For The Phoenix
This past weekend, the Swarthmore Men'sUltimate

team traveled to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa.,
to compete in the Sectional portion of the National
ultimate tournament. With games against college
teams Penn and Carnegie Mellon and 4 other postcollege (club) teams, the SwarmingEarthworms, initially seeded sixteenth, went 3-3 and moved up to fin-

ish ninth in the section.
The Earthworms packed into a van early Saturday
morning to take on all the ultimate teams that Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware had to offer. Invitations for the sectional round of the Nationalultimate tournament were sent to every team in the tristate area. Twenty men's teams responded to fight
Swarthmore, seeded acfor a spot at Regionals.
cording to last year's record, entered Sectionals
ranked 16th out of those twenty, and fourth in their
bracket of five teams.
Knowing they had a tough road ahead, the men
started off the day playing rival Penn. After a hardfought game,the Penn Void pulled out a 9-6 win, start-

Brandon Silverman lays out to make a grab during practice

ing Swarthmore at 0-1 for the day. The Earthworms
evened up theirrecord by blanking Carnegie Mellon 130, before proceeding to knock off their first club team
opponent of the weekend, Harrisburg, 13-5. Swarthmore

finished 2-2 and in third place in their bracket after
getting beaten 15-4 by the second-best team in the
region, Dogs of War.
That third-of-five finish in their bracket (only top
three could come back for Sunday) allowed the men
to come back and compete the next day for one of the
elusive spots at Regionals, to be held on October 910. After a difficult 11-7 loss to Burning Sensation, a
club team who made a considerable number of questionable calls (ultimate is self-refereed), the Earthworms finished up the weekend 3-3 by beating the
club team, Men of Thrash, 13-8 and securing ninth
place.
Despite missing Regionals by two places (only the
top seven moved on), the men are content with the
weekend's performance. The Regionals experience
was viewed by Evan Gregory 'Ol as being "real positive." Having entered the weekend in 16thplace and
finished ninth, the largest jump of any team in the
Sectionals.
This weekend's results place the men as the fourthbest college team in the tri-state area, a position they
look forward to defending and improving upon this
upcoming season.

Women's rubgy goes 2-0 against Shippensburg, Lehigh Valley
By Rhiana Schwartz
For The Phoenix
The women's rugby team is having an impressive start
to their season. The team, which lost several key seniors last year, now stands at 3-0. The win on Septem-

ber 18th was earned against an important divisional foe,
Shippensburg University. It was a hard-fought battle on
Mertz Field that day, but the Swarthmore Warmothers
mustered up all their might to end the game victorious
with the final score of 12-10. With the win, the
Warmothers are on their way to qualifying for the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union (EPRU) Championship
this October, a goal which has eluded them in the past
two years.
According to Nancy Craig 'Ol, the Shippensburg game
was "the hardest ever." After scoring first with a
Meredith Hegg 'OO put-down early in the second half,
Shippensburg built a lead. Until that point, the Swat defense had appeared almost impenetrable. Danielle
D'Olivera 'OO and Cathy Vaughan 'Ol were an incredible

tackling duo, keeping Ship frustrated. Emily Wilkins 'Ol
also made clutch plays at fullback to keep Swat in the
lead.
However, Shippensburg broke twice through the
Warmothers' line of defense to up the ante, taking a 510 advantage. Although it was late in the game, Swarthmore would not let up. After more scrums that the
Warmothers would like to remember, Alexa Miller 'OO
found a hole and battled to get the ball into the endzone.
Hegg took it from there, making the score 10-10. Cocaptain Rhiana Swartz 'OO hit the conversion through
uprights which had been constructed ofPVC piping only
hours before. A few minutes later, the whistle blew and
Swarthmore celebrated the victory.
The B-side game was also a well-fought match. Ship
scored early to make the score 0-5, but that was all Swat
would allow. The Warmother rookies picked up their
defense and tackled like pros. Josie Hastings 'O2 and
Joan Javier 'O3 were strong and stable players in the
back line, passing and defending with aggression.
Among the forwards, Taina Guarda 'O2 excelled at

hooker and Jessica Salvatore 'O2 provided stability in
the game.
A week later, Swat was at it again. Back at Dupont
Field, Swarthmore's A-side battled with Lehigh Valley
(a women's club team), while B-side played Drexel University. The A-side game was not pretty, but when the
dust settled, the final score was 3-0 and Swat was victorious again. The Warmothers played without four of
their starters while the rest played out of position.
Rookie forwards Siobhan Carty 'Ol and Sara Cole 'O3
played their first A-side game notably well while Craig
was substitute scrumhalf, directing the field with confidence. The only points of the game came from Swartz,
who hit a penalty kick from just inside the 22-meter
line.
B-side, playing Drexel's A-side, lost 0-15. Emiliana
Bean 'O2 and Jessica Lee 'O3 are backs to watch in the
future. Forwards Kate Fama 'Ol. and Fabien Tepper 'O2
took down player after player to the delight of the fans.
Swarthmore will try to continue its streak against divisional rival UDel this Saturday in Delaware.

Volleyball topples Villa Julie but falls to Widener
By Fran Smith

For The Phoenix

Last Saturday the women's volleyball team travelled to meet up
with Villa Julie, a team they had
never competed against before.
The women were excited after
their streak-breaking win over
Washington earlier in the week
and hungry for another win.
Despite this momentum, the
Garnet came out completely flat
in the first game, giving Villa
Julie every opportunity and
rarely attacking the ball. Although the team rallied back several times, they eventually
dropped the game 14-16.
In game two the women picked
up the pace and, although their
full momentum was not there,
they managed to take the game
15-11. By games three and four,
the Garnet were playing at full
intensity. They won the third
game 15-13 and crushed Villa
Julie with a 15-2 win in the fourth
game. Bryn Rosenfeld 'O3
knocked down 17 kills and
Bonnie French 'Ol led the team
with 42 assists. Pam Lavallee 'O3
was enthusiastic about the
match. "We started out slowly
but eventually picked up the
pace. We are a determined team.
Our confidence in our teammates is a big factor when we
succeed," she commented. "Individually, Bonnie French did a
wonderful job setting. On the
hitting end, Bryn Rosenfeld
could not be stopped."
Elated after their second win
in a row, the Lady Garnets geared
up to take on Widener, a team that
the women have been unable to
topple the last two seasons. Gloria
Chan 'O2 expressed her desirefor
the win: "I wanted it so bad that I
could taste it, we all did."
