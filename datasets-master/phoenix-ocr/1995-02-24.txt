Faculty, Students Discuss Passion
By Amy Albert

Last Friday afternoon, students and
professors aired their concerns at an
open forum on the upcoming chorus
performance of Bach's 5/. John's
Passion, which some feel is antiSemitic, during this semester's Parents' Weekend.
The discussion, which was moderated by Associate Dean Bob Gross,
began with a statement from Music
Department Chair Sharon Friedler.
Friedler outlined the steps that the
Music Department plans on taking
with regard to the controversy. She
said that"the members of the Depart-

issue. Alston spoke first, concentrating on the historical importance and
spiritual value of the piece; he also
asserted that the Jews are not specifically singled out for blame in Christ's
crucifixion in the piece, but that the
Passion is supposed to considdfr ail
who hearit and all who live as guilty
in the murder of Christ.
Vanessa Silberman, a former member of the chorus who quit due to the
selection of the St. John's Passion,
spoke, representing a small group of
students both in the chorus and in the
general community who have been
working to increase the community's
awareness of the anti-Jewish nature
of the Passion.
She
spoke
Alston and about the perchoice

that she was
forced to make
due to the performance of a
piece used by Hitler to "educate" the
Germanpeople during WorldWar II;
she stressed that she was forced to

ment are aware,

as musicians and as

educators, of the issues surrounding

the piece. The department is making
every effort and welcomes the opportunity to bring a fully informed
discussion of the musical and contextual aspects of the work to the

community as a whole."

Friedler added that there would be
a full study of the piece by the Chorus, Chorus Director John Alston,

Professor of Musicology Michael
Marissen, and Professor of Religion
Mark Wallace.
She also announced that a previously planned symposium by students in Professor Marissen's Bach
seminar would be held concerning
the piece. Finally, Friedler said there
would not be a visual display or protests during the actual performance
as was stated in a previous opinion
article in The Phoenix, but that
Marissen would deliver remarks at
the point in the piece which, during
Bach's era, wouldhave been devoted
to a sermon.
After Friedler's introduction, a
panel of five speakers representing a
broad range of views spoke on the

chorus and her personal convictions.
Silberman was followed by
Marissen, a Bach scholar who said,
"I don't feel I can accept or promote
the view that this work contributes to

the well-documented and horrific
ongoing story of anti-Semitism."
Marissen agreed with Alston that
in Bach's version of the St. John's
Passion, everyone is held responsible for Christ's crucifixions. He
added that, although there are no explicitly anti-Jewish statements in the

piece, there is most definitely a general condemnation of all who were
present at the crucifixion, and that al
of the participants in the story of the
death of Christ were Jews.
Marissen was followed by Naomi
Michlin, another member of the student group. She is not a member ol
the chorus but is a concerned Jewish
student. Michlin said that some students were "hurt, scared, and offended" by the choice of this piece,
but that the erouo was not attemrjtrne

Students: Sophomore
Papers Stress-Free
By Tara Zahra

The prevailing sentiment of students writing their sophomorepapers
this week seems to be that it's the
least stressfulpaper that they'll have
to write at Swarthmore.
Despite having to decide what
classes they will take during the next
two years, students have found the
process to be relatively trauma-free.
'The whole thing is overblown," said
prospective History major David
McGrail '97. "I plan on doing itThursday night at 1 a.m."
Monica Patterson, a sophomore
who hopes to double-major in Sociology & Anthropology and English
Literature with a concentration in
Black Studies said, "It was nervewracking at first, but after talking to
some professors I'm not nearly as
worried about it."
The decision that most students
expressed the greatest concern over
is the choicebetween the Honors and
Course programs. For many of those
planning to go Honors, the new system is more appealing than the old
one. "You have grades so everything
isn'tresting on the exams," explained
OmarMencin '97. Others agreed with
Mencin's opinion that the addition of

grades has added incentive to take
advantage of the Honors program. "I
want grades, although I don't know
to what extent it will help or hurt me
when applying for grad school," said
McGrail.
Students are also pleased with the
flexibility of the new program. Joe
Khan *97 decided to go Honors with
a double major in Political Science
and English Literature. Additionally,
he plans to study abroad, which would
he said have been "more complicated
under the old system."
Some students have found deciding on specific courses frustrating.
Doug McCrath '97 suggested that
tentative department schedules ought
to be given out earlier in the school
year since "there are some courses
for my major [economics] thatI would
have taken this semester if I knew
that they wouldn't be offered again."
Furthermore, the fact that offerings are listed without times adds
uncertainty to theprocess. "You could
have all your classes planned out and
they could then all be offered at 9:30
a.m.," said prospective Biology majorElin Lisska '97. Even so, Lisska
was relatively relaxed about her paper. "It's been pretty anti-climactic,"
she said.

to sabotage theperformance and simply wished to use the piece as avehicle

for discussions on anti-Semitism and
on the Passion.
The panel was closed by Wallace,
who underscored the complexity of
the issue. He pointed out that even if

the St. John's Passion itself is

not

inherently anti-Semitic, the antiSemitism of Passion plays, and the
general anti-Semitism of the time in
which it was created, affect the meaning of the piece. He also suggested
that the Gospel of John had been used
to spur anti-Semitism and that should

be a consideration.
The forum was covered by Channel 6 and The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Despite all the press, there appears to
be little general unrest about the issue, possibly due to the timely and
effective presentation of the forum
and the dedication of both parties in
dealing with the issue in a rational
and productive fashion.
Gross said, "I believe that Swarthmore has offered an illustration of
how such a controversy can provide a
vehicle for education and mutual understanding. The 200 students, faculty and staff, and guests who attended heard good scholarship, solid
reasoning, and deep conviction from
the five speakers and many in the

audience.... While it was not an official Collection, I believe it set a standard for enlightenment, sincerity, and
civility that future Collections would
do well to reach."

Web Overload Crashes Raptor
By Eugene Sonn

Swarthmore learned first-hand this
fragile the Internetis when
Raptor, the UNIX computer maintained by the Swarthmore College
ComputingSociety, crashed on Tuesday because too many people were
accessing the machine.
The flurry of connections with
Raptor was spurred by the publication in La Reforma, a national newspaper in Mexico, of the World Wide
Web computer address of Justin
Paulson '96, who keeps an archive of
information about the peasant rebellion in Chiapas, Mexico. In the past
week, 33,807 users have connected
to Raptor from Mexico alone.
Paulson maintains a World Wide
Web home page on his Raptor account, as do 36 other Swarthmore
students. A home pageis a method of
information storage which is able to
include text, graphics, and even sound
recordings, all in one medium. Various programs allow users to "surf
the WWW by moving between pages
by clicking on highlighted text which
links two locations.
Paulson keeps an archive and information center about the Zapatista
National Revolutionary Army
(EZLN) on his home page, as well as
an electronic version of the national
Mexican newspaperLa Jornada. In
the past week, 7,933 people have accessed the issues of La Jornada and
3,096 have linked to the EZLN page,
he said.
Paulson said that no one fromLa
Reforma asked him for permission to
print his home page's address. "If
they had asked me I probably wouldn't
have told them to print it," he said. He
knew that his home page already had
a large number of visitors each day
and that Raptor's capacities are limweek how

ited.

Geoffrey Noer '95, President of
SCCS, said Raptor ran out of memory
because itruns an additionalprogram

for each person using the computer.
So when thousandsof"hits" (as computer experts call requests for access) came in for Paulson's home
page, Raptor tried to run too many
copies of- the program at once and
crashed. Noer said Raptor went down
once last Friday and twice on Tuesday. The computer restarted itself
the first two times, but on Tuesday a
Raptor administrator had to re-boot
it manually.
Noer said that Raptor has been
running at or near capacity for several months. The home page of Justin Hall '97 had already heavily burdened Raptor with his extremely
popular page "Links From the Underground." "I get about 27,000 hits
a day," said Hall, "but I only have
three or four links on my page here
and therest of my pages are at Wired
[magazine]." Hall worked at Wired
for a semester; the magazine has
allowed him to keep pages on their
computers to alleviate the pressure
on Raptor.
On Wednesday night, Noer said
that he and the other members of
SCCS had not yet decided how they
wouldprevent Raptor from continuing to crash. He discussed some potentially draconian solutions such as
barring WWW links from off-campus and some less drastic ones such
as limiting the number of users at
any one time.
"Different solutions have different life spans," said Noer, pointing
out that some options may work for
a while, but with Raptor use growing quickly temporary solutions may
not buy enough

time for the group to
find permanent solutions. Noer said
there are about 600 users on Raptor.
Eighteen groups keep mailing lists
on Raptor and 13 student organizations have WWW pages.
On Thursday, Paulson put a temporary message where his web page
usually appears, explaining that he
had to take it down until he and

members of SCCS could solve the
overload problem.
Hall solved the overload problem
with his pages by moving most of
them to other computers. This may
work for Paulson too. "I may be able
to put some of it...on my brother's

he said.
If Raptor continues to serve as the
WWW server for students, the current machine will not be enough, said
Noer. "We're adding as many as three
or four new home pages a week," he
said. He explained that an already
overworked computer and growing
student interest might spell crash in
the futureâ€”even if Paulson's page
were not an issue.
Getting a new server could be
costly. Noer suggested that two DEC
Alpha computersâ€”which would cost
about $B,OOO apieceâ€”would not only
avoid any future crashes, but give
Swarthmore enough web space to
make a meaningful contribution to
the virtual community.
The SCCS obtained Raptor two
years ago when the College computing center decided to get rid of Hemlock, the UNIX computer any student
could get an account on.

SPAC Splinters Under Ideological Differences
By Nayef Homsi

ment, Murphy stressed the importance of not

For my first article, ThePhoenix asked me to
find out why the Socialist Political Action
Collective (SPAC) has stopped meeting as a
whole. Because this is my first semester at
Swarthmore, I didn't have the faintest idea
whatproblems I might encounter in gathering
information for the article.
With naivet6,l started asking students about
SPAC. The answers I received ranged from
"It's an umbrella organization" to "Oh, they're
socialists." My problems had only begun, however. When I called up some of the
organization's members, they met my questions with such phlegmatic responses as "I'm
worried about academics at this point." Others
simply apologized for their incapacity to yield
any information.
I started to become genuinely interested in

this "SPAC enigma." Finally, I talked to Ted
Melillo '97 and MichaelMurphy '95, two SPAC
members who insisted on e-mailing statements
to me rather than being interviewed by phone.
With regard to the information in his state-

distorting quotes from members, "because that
has happened so often in the past, which, of
course, only made things worse." Melillo told
me to "feel free to mention my name, but please
donot quote me on any of whatI have included.
It was put together by several of us, and I would
prefer to leave these statements as group material." This request demonstrates the
organization's selfless attitude, which may be
at theroot ofits failure. As a Collective, SPAC
admits to its "lack [of] hierarchical structure."
SPAC is an "umbrella group of the Left on
the Swarthmore campus," according to the
organization's mission statement. The statement further indicates that "as a Collective, we
focus on opposing structural inequalities and
social injustices in our local, regional, national,
and international communities."
The statement also explains that SPAC members meet as a "democratic forum" to plan the
radical activities of a series of "independent
sub-groups," and that SPAC's purpose is to

"empower communities instead of bandaging
their social problems with temporary assis-

tance." Additionally, the organization does not
want to promote a system of "community service that foster[s] dependency and attempts]
to mask the chronic failures of the capitalist
political economy."
Murphy said that "taking Marx and Paulo
Friere as two prominent jumping off points, we
sought to think through ways of working with
the 'oppressed' and 'exploited' in ways thatdid
not just further dependence." Calling this goal
"most difficult,"Murphyexplained that SPAC's
community services were not designed as a
"bourgeois college-kid therapy at the expense
of the unorganized." The group seeks, he said,
"to engage in campus-wide political organizing," and provide the College community with
information on Leftist issues independent "of
the Democratic and

Republican mainstream."
SPAC and has
worked on the group since its inception. Nevertheless, in attempting to explain what SPAC
stands for, he said he could "only speak for
[him]self and maybe a few others."
His e-mail provided the main reasons why
SPAC stopped meeting. SPAC was originally
created in answer to the "rising tide ofreactionary conservative thought that had swept the
country and made its way to Swarthmore," he
said. However, SPAC's anti-conservative stand
damaged its internal harmony. "Those already
associated with right-wing ideology," said
Murphy, "are very much not interested in intellectual dialogue (their supposed reason for being at Swarthmore), as their speaker-series
proved. The energy spent on confronting them
proved overly distracting and spent a great deal
ofSPAC's energy. It turned into party politics
of the worst kind."
SPAC's dissolution is also related to community service. "In the name of 'Action' and
'not feeling bad about ourselves,' SPAC endorsed the notion of just going out and helping
peopleâ€”this was perhaps the worst betrayal of
the Marxist legacy we had supposedly laid
claim to," said Murphy. "Theory and criticism
got dismissed as luxuries and distracting (this
was the worst of vulgar materialism). SPAC
failed to acknowledge our own privileged position and that we can only approach the struggle
from that standpoint. Additionally, during all
of this, a rift had been emerging as to the value
of this theorist or Marxist philosopher or that
one. Things took on a disturbing personal tone.
Things fell apart."
It was seemingly the very foundations of
SPAC that caused it to crumble. As Murphy
pointed out, "every member of SPAC was intelligent and committed, it is just that we were
too impulsive at times." SPAC has fragmented
into sub-groups that present information tables
in Parrish, write the newsletter Spare Change,
and sponsor a chapter of the nationally-run
group Empty the Shelters. SPAC members also
organize activities including a film series, guest
lectures, and participation in outside organizations like the Delaware County Pledge of Resistance. Also, Murphy has organized a Marxist Reading Group which attempts to explore
the basis of Marxist theory and its contemporary relevance.

Phi Psi Hosts Forum to
Debunk Prat Myths
The people I met introduced themselves as
Martinez, O'Reilly, Roche, Patel, Dulaney,

Delgado. I was not attending a meeting on
ethnic diversity, though; I was eating hors
d'oeuvres and listening to Miles Davis at the
Phi Psi Open House. This is not your typical
fraternity.
The purpose of Wednesday's Open House
was "to get in touch with the alumni and the
community and to show the College what
we're about," said David Martinez '96, a Phi
Psi brother.

Phi Psi is "in a difficult position now,"
according to Vice-President Andrew Place
'96. The fraternity might lose its house because of a $17,000 debt to the College. Many
of their alumni, including Warren Jacobs '46,
who attended the Open House, are giving them
strong support.
The house, built by Phi Psi in 1921, provides a place where what Martinez referred to
as a "social club"â€”as opposed to a typical
fraternityâ€”meets weekly and holds all-campus parties.
Phi Psi is hoping to attract new members.
President Jude O'Reilly '95 emphasized that

founding member of the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front (FMLN), will speak
about his community's work in grassroots
development and democracy in El Salvador.
His talk will focus on "the Center-Left
[Coalition] *s vision for social change and justice in [EI Salvador] and their plans for developing the 15mayoralities won by FMLN candidates last March in the party's first national
election," according to a statement by the
Latin American Studies Group, one of the
organizations sponsoring Canjura's talk.
Gypsyamber Berg-Cross '96, head of the
group, called the Center-Left a "moderate
leftist" group in the spectrum of Latin American politics.
"They believe in helping local people and
supporting [their] rights," she said. "I think
these are very important issues for everyone to

Opinions
Educated, but
not Employed
From the "What is this education, after
all?" file:
On the front page of the February 20 New
York Times, there is word that the toils of our
college careers may be for naught An article
entitled "Employers Wary ofSchool System:
Survey FindsBroad Distrust of Younger Job
Aspirants" announces indications that as far
as the job market is concerned, the ideals of
our studies may be passe.
Yes, itmakes me feel slightly queasy too.
A recent study conducted by the National
Center on the Educational Quality of the
Work Force at the University of Pennsylvania, says the article, found that "in selecting
workers, employers tended to disregard
grades and school evaluations and rely more
on the job applicant's attitude, behavior, and
job experience." Employers, it goes on to
say, are highly skeptical about young, new
workers, and are "divorcing themselves from
the schools." In this country, there is a great
divide between education and vocation.
Swarthmore does not focus on technical
skills and job experience. Instead, as written
in its "Statement of Objectivesand Pur-

-1 poses"

(1994-5

Swarthmore
Catalog, page
8), "Thepurpose
ofSwarthmore is
a make its students more valuable human beings and more
useful members of society....Swarthmore
seeks to help its students realize their fullest
intellectual and personal potential combined
with a deep sense of ethical and social concern." This indicates that Swarthmore approaches education as a character-building
endeavor rather than vocational training.
It seems that in our education, we cannot
fulfill both employers' and Swarthmore's
basic aims. The question is: which is more
important, being employable, or being a responsible, fully-developed citizen? The answer, it seems, is thatboth are essential. They
are in fact two sides of the same coin.To live
in this society, we need an intellectual grounding by which to understand our world, but we
also need jobs. We would derive the most
benefit from our S warthmore education, then,

if we learned in both these manners.
In this aim, it seems that the Swarthmore
curriculum would best serve its students by
adding classes with more real-world applications, and cutting some classes that focus on
purely contemplative, abstract topics. This
suggestion may look like a marketplace sellout. But it is possible to make the Swarthmore education more applicable to the rest of
our lives without sacrificing theliberal arts
ideal of well-roundedness.

Swarthmore's non-vocationai focus upholds an essential standard of character formation. However, in light of many employers' disregard for educations like ours, it
seems that something must change. The ideal
of absolute intellectual development must be
modified to provide for the vocational demands under which all students will eventu-

ally live.

Constitution Debate Continues
Some students are upset over recent Student Council meetings:

Student Council Needs to Change Its Policies
To the Editor:
We are very disappointed by last week's
editorial by Margaret Cohen and Mike Pan
concerning our challenge to Student Council
that it become more relevant, accountable and
accessible. We
are appalled
that our attempt to ex-

press our grievances
was
chalked up as

an attack. The
comments leveled against us
when we tried
to explain our views and the tone of the subsequent editorial were hostile, inappropriate and
unprofessional. If our mere presence made them
uncomfortable, then our grounds for complaint
are well founded.
Cohen and Pan described the method we
used to make our point and their feelings towards it, however they did not address our
concerns. Cohen andPan told their side of what
transpired that Sunday evening. Now itis time
to let the Swarthmore community know what is
really going on; we can no longer expect our
student leaders to keep us accurately informed.
Several weeks ago, we learned that Student
Council has been working without a constitution governing its decision making processes.
We were disturbed by the fact that the community is unaware that SC has been operating
under these circumstances for years. We wanted
toknow what was happening within our student
government, especially since there were no
recent minutes posted on their bulletin board
before Sunday's incident. When we attempted
silently to observe the meeting, we were asked
to leave based on Council precedent. We refused. Rather than conduct the business of the
evening or deal with the issue at hand, the two
co-coordinators, over the protests of other members, adjourned the meeting.
In the editorial, our actions were described as
a show of"blatant disrespect for this tradition"
and well, we agree. Whatkind of business can
they conduct based on traditions without written rules?
After the meeting was adjourned, several SC
members stayed behind to hear our grievances
and discuss issues we felt were not being ad-

from the student body. But what can we comment on besides its inactivity? Ask the average
Swattie to name one significant thing SC has

done this academic yearâ€”we doubt that they
would be able to do it.
An example of their ineptitude occurred last
Thursday when SC held an open forum with
Steve Piker to discuss the new foreign studies
billing policy after it had taken effect. Where
were Student Council members during the deliberations? Why weren't they advocating for
the students' views and keeping us informed?
These are the issues that SC needs to address.
If Student Council
feels that the interruption of their meeting
was unfounded and
based on a complete
lack of information,
then the problem is
worse
than
we
thought. In the future,
we hope it doesn't
take two students sit-

they still plan to
ratify it within SC as
opposed to a vote by

body.
The second issue
jj^^^^^^^^^^m
discussed was the closed Sunday meeting
policy. They made meager attempts torationalize the tradition, but we still await a sound
explanation of the real motives. Pan and Cohen
failed to mention their idea that Council meetings need to be closed to facilitate free and open
discussion among council members. However,
this policy prevents students from knowing
how individual members are voting and what
their views on pertinent issues are. Plainly put,
as long as students are not privy to the information discussed in closed SC meetings, they can

SC has nothing to

deals with issues case by case. They do not
realize that rules are necessary to ensure fair
decisions.
While Student Council has said its "express
purpose is the expeditious ratification of a set

meeting. Before the incident on Sunday, the
Constitution Committee was composed of only

larger problemâ€”Student Council is not doing
its job. They claims to be acting in the interest
of students on this campus, yet how can members claim to represent those with whom they
have no contact and no discussion? Members

It is unclear whether the student body as a

well as an in depth discussion of one key issue.

A few more copies of the council minutes could
be printed out and put in strategic places like
Parrish Parlors and Tarble Lounge. A copy of
the minutes could also be sent to the Phoenix

One Student's Deconstruction of Common Sense
Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Conservatives
By Neal Potischman
This past weekend I was pleased to
have enough free time on my hands
to read the latest edition of Common
Sense. After a healthy dose of their
ideas, I have a new outlook on life.
From Vijay Toke's article I learned
that a flat tax (charge everyone one
rate) is a great idea, except that it
hurts the middle class. His proposed

solution is for legislation to make it
for the middle class.
His solution sounds like a graduated income tax scale which charges
those with more money higher rates
(the current system), but I digress.
Suffice it to say, the flat tax works
well, except for how it affects the
majority of Americans.
From Thomas Makin's article I
learned that parochial schools are not

not quite so flat

pernicious. He informed me that they
try to educate, they often succeed,
and that we should therefore all have
school vouchers. It took about 2,200
words to prove the first two ideas, but
I was never sure how Common Sense
reached the third. Maybe I was too
engrossed in the results of the unbiased "survey" they conducted toread
the article closely.
From the editorial board

The passage through Parrish

hub, the multi-dimensionalportal to
the campus. The journey through
Parrish ought to be a gratifying one:
there is so much to read, so much at
which to pause and ponder.
Perhaps a system a la San Quentin

and a guard immediately pulls you

By the dumb's early light: Gump and Gumper
Dumb is in. Anti-intellectualism is
American as apple pie, and people from Joe
McCarthy to Jesse Helms haye risen to power
by exploiting the average American's fear that
somebody, somewhere, thinks he's smarter
than they are. But these things go in cycles,
and it's obvious that, what with the renewed
assault on PBS and the NEA, dumbism is on
the rise. "We don't need all that 'culture'
crap," our new leaders tell us, "and besides,
everybody can get that stuff on cable any-

way."

It's hardly a coincidence that at such a
Forrest Gump became one
of the highest grossing movies of
all time and garnered a whopping
13 Oscar nominations, including a
second Best Actor nomination for
Tom Hanks (who, should he win,
would be the first to win consecutive Best Actors since 1938).
Gump is a hymn to self-interested ]
stupidity, a sprawling mock-epic \
which fails to unearth anything
remotely worth saying.
For those who were mercifully spared the flurry of promotion surrounding Gump's
release, the story goes something like this: Forrest, a
good Southern boy who
loves his Mama (Sally
Field), is born with an I.Q. of
50 and the ability to run real fast, particularly
when he's about to get into trouble. Forrest
also loves Jenny (Robin Wright), who is,
sadly, unable to return Forrest's love, perhaps
moment,

.

commanding officer, he turns broody and
morose after his legs are blown off, thus providing Forrest Gump with an excuse for some
overhyped "special effects." Sinise has his
legs digitally removed to portray his character
as a double amputee. Articles that fawned over
the advanced technology used to produce this
effect ignored just how distracting this was;
the supposed drama of Sinise's situation gives
way to "How'd they do that?" This reduction
of a physical disability to a fancy special effect
strikes me as supremely tasteless. The film's
other noted effectâ€”the insertion of Forrest
into decades old footage of Johnson,
nedy, and Lennonâ€”is less offensive
:ause it is more innocuous. Still, it's
rd to imagine why three such notable
Â»ures had to be exhumed for the sake of
bathroom jokes (Forrest shows L.BJ.
f: his "butt-tock" wound and tells
J.F.K. he has to pee).
frgfr This cavalier attitude is not surj3R; prising coming from director
Sjr Robert Zemeckis, best known for
the Back to the Futures and Who
Framed Roger Rabbit? Back to
the Future was a fantastic bagof-tricks movie; audiences
went to see neat effects, and the
cheap recreation of the
1950'sâ€”leather jackets, a
Studebaker, Chuck Berry on
the soundtrackâ€”was part of
the joke. But such an attitude ill suits the more
pretentious Gump, as entire historical epochs
are reduced to obvious musical references and
details taken out of context. This tokenistic
attitude to historical recreation reaches its
morbid zenith near the film's end, when a
character contracts a "mysterious new virus."
The year is 1982. The reduction of AIDS to a
topical detail is one of the more idiotic gestures in a film full of them.

because she was sexually abused by her father
(Incidentally, this is as close as Jenny gets to

"depth"; her character is a conglomeration of
sexist cliches). Forrest pursues her for thirty
years or so, having along the way what is normally referred to as a "series of adventures".
These include: running a successful shrimp
business, inventing a famous bumper sticker,
and meeting several U.S. presidents (although,
unfortunately, no Reaganâ€”it would have been
nice to see Forrest meet someone he could

really talk to).
Although he meets many people, Forrest
makes few friendsâ€”only with two of his fellow soldiers in Vietnam does Forrest connect.
One, Bubba, shares both Forrest's I.Q. and his
outlook on life. (Forrest's low I.Q. never
inconveniences him in any way; it just gives
him a special kind of "insight" supposedly
inaccessible to most people's more populated
brains.) Together, the two friends dream of
running a shrimp boat, but their plans are cut

short when Bubba succumbs to the double
curse of being a) the hero's best friend, and b)
the only black character in an otherwise vanilla movie.
Destined for greater things is the other soldier, played by Gary Sinise. A stock hardass

Applying to serve in The Peace Corps is
"not analogous to the college admissions
process," said Tom Francis, director of Career
Planning and Placement, and a former Peace
Corps Volunteer (Agriculture in Benin).
Placement in The Peace Corps is made by
matching applicants to categories of requests
for people with specific qualifications and
skills; there are neither standard qualifications,
nor a set level of competitiveness for acceptance.
Once applicants have been

"nominated" for

specific positions, interviews are performed,
references are contacted, and medical forms
are unsealed. This process takes from 5 to 7
weeks and, if all goes well, applicants are
accepted and their applications are put into the
pool of people awaiting invitations to specific
countries.
While competition among applicants with
liberal arts degrees is far more competitive
than among those with technical degrees, "if
people are willing to make themselves more
competitive, they probably will get placed,"
said Sanderson. Any applicant can increase
his/her chances of being placed by majoring in
areas which are in higher demand, by tutoring
or teaching at least 10 hours a month for at
least 3 months, by gaining experience in areas
such as gardening, construction, plumbing,
CPR, nutrition, and sewing, and by studying a
foreign language (especially French or
Spanish) at the college level.

If you are interested in working for The
Peace Corps, applications can be found in the

Raimi Shoots Straight With
The Quick and the Dead
By David Rich
Do you like Sam Raimi's work? He's the
guy who brought us the Evil Dead series and
Darkman. His latest film is a twisted romp
through the spaghetti western genre called The
Quick and the Dead. It stars Gene Hackman,
Leonardo DiCapprio, and Sharon Stone (but
don't hold Stone against the movie).
Every year the town of Redemption holds a
quick draw contest for anyone who wishes to
try his luck. The contest is put on by the local
despot, John Herod (Hackman), as a way to
assert his domination over the cowardly town.
This year, Lady, played by Sharon Stone,
enters in order to try and kill Herod, who killed
her father a dozenyears ago as it turns out. The
contest is filled with a motley crew: The Kid
(DiCapprio), the flamboyant son of Herod;
Ace, the braggart; Spotted Horse, a native
American who claims that he cannot be killed
by a bullet; Sgt. Cantrell, a hired gun out to kill
Herod; and Cort (Russell Crowe), an outlaw
turned preacher who's being tormented by
Herod for turning his back on him and his bandit ways.
That's the whole story, believe it or not. The
characters are part of what makes this film so
much fun; and it really is. The other part of the
film that is so great is Raimi's style. If you've
ever seen his other films, you know what to
expect from this one. He stays true to form
with all the closeup shots, sometimes with the

subject off to the side and lots of stuff going on
behind her or him, shots that are framed by
doorways or other squared outlines, and really
creative camera angles.
I can't tell you where this camera goes without spoiling some of the best scenes, but if
you're going to miss it and want to know, just
ask me I'm dying to tell people about them.
Raimihas the ability to make any film fun; it's
kind of funny to think about what Highlander
111 might have been like with him at the
helm....
The cast is really great: DiCapprio is larger
than life, Hackman goes way over the top as
the bad guy, Russell Crowe is a major badass,
and even Sharon Stone isn't bad, though, her
role doesn't require a lot of acting depth. This
is one of the few movies I've seen her in that
she doesn't do a sex scene, although there is
one totally, totally, completely gratuitous shot
of her breast.
The movie takes a satirical look a the classic Western genre, specifically the spaghetti
western. Stone's character is basically a
blonder, tighter-leather-wearing, biggerbreasted version of Blondie, Clint Eastwood's
character in The Good, The Bad, and The
Ugly. The Quick and the Dead is worth seeing if you're looking for nothing but a fun
time, though it drags a little in the middle of
the contest. It gets a (4), "this pig is amazing"

The headliners Kicking Giant are from Olympia, WA, and will wow you with their supposedly
very exciting live show, taut, stripped-down guitar/drum sound, and well-written songs. The second band, the Strapping Fieldhands, will amaze and beguile with their wacky stage antics and
drunken reevaluations of music as we know it in Western society. Finally, we will have Blue,
who "rock," I hear. Good stuff for live-music lovers who like to entertain their minds as well as
their booty!

Pete Balvanz '9B
Pete is coming off one of the wrestling
team's biggest wins this season. Last weekend
in the 142 pound weight class finals of the
Centennial Conference Championships,
Balvanz defeated last year's conference champion Kirk Holtfrom Ursinus College by a score
of 9-5. Balvanz, who is currently 16-4 on the
season has been a consistent performer for the
Garnet. He placed second in both the Swarthmore Elite Meet and the SwarthmoreTakedown
Tournament earlier in the year, and hopes to
fair equally well in the upcoming Division 111
Regional Qualifiers at Ursinus this weekend.
Balvanz says the transition from high school
to college wrestling has not been a particularly
easy one for him. B alvanz recorded three ofhis
four total losses in his first four matches, starting out the season at a disappointing 1-3. He
admits thathe was discouraged with his performance initially, but comments, "As the season
progressed, I've gotten a lot more confident."
He also notes that college wrestlers are "a lot
stronger and it was a big step for me mentally."
Balvanz attributes much ofhis recent success
to the teams outstanding coaching staff, remarking that "Coach Tirpak has been a great
help to me. He would do anything for his
wrestlers, and his attitude has helped me to
make the transition." Balvanz credits the support of his teammates, saying, "There are a lot
of guys who would go out on a limb for you,
and knowing that helps a lot."

Skye has come a long way since her debut in

joined the swim team then because "all of her

she has gone from pizza parties to national
competition.
Skye placed second in her strongest event,

asthma, tendonitis in both shoulders, and cartilage irritation in both knees. She had to learn
to swim through her pain, and by Conferences

Quicker Quakers
Swim to Success at
Centennial Finals
Women Finish Second, Men Place
Fourth to End Successful Season
By Matt Cohen
Another swim season has ended.
This is a joyous time for many Quicker
Quakers, as they reflect on a season
of personal records, hard work, and
team spirit. It is also a time for the
underclassmen to consider the hard
work that will go into making next
year even more exhilarating. As a
senior, it is a time to reflect on four
years of making physical and emotional commitments to a sport where
the only true measure of performance
is time. We now learn to cope with

and enjoying the time between

4 and 6 p.m. as our own again.

The meet started quietly Friday
morning as the rest of the world dealt
with a normal, albeit warm, day. Ware
Pool was mobbed with newly shaved
swimmers from eight schools. There
was a sense of wonder everywhere as
swimmers warmed up and felt their
bodies, rested and shaved, cruising
through the water with astounding
velocity. The water was cold (colder
water is denser and, therefore, faster)
and the air filled with unprecedented
pre-meet tension for the Centennial
Conference Championships.
Almost every Swat swimmer had
personal best times, and countless
conference, pool, and college records

fell. However, as usual, there a number of swims each day that stood out
as truly staggering.
On Friday night, the most incredible races came in the 400 medley.
The women came in second, beating
out Washington for a college record
and a medal. The men also took second, surprising the winners
Gettysburg with how close they
stayed. The time was astounding, with
the college record falling by nearly 6
seconds. Each swimmer in the relay
(Tricia Duncan'9s, Andy "Shaft"
Robbins'9B, Skye Fulkerson and
Kendrew Witt '96, Justin Herring' 97,
MariaKaufman'96, Alice Unger '9B,
and Carl Sanders '9B) swam extraordinarily fast, and sent a shrill message to all the Quicker Quakers that
the taper had worked.
Standouts from the second day
were in the 100 breast, where conference champions and national qualifiers FulkersonandWitt defended their
titles. Fulkerson swam quickly
enough to make the "A" National cut,
which translates to "she's fast as
â€”." Witt
won his event easily, with
his tremendouskick motoring him to
a 59:68. In the 100fly, Herring swam
an inspirational 52:78 to win over the
freshman

from
Gettysburg. In the 100back, Robbins
took third with a college record 54mid."Get that boy on weights! "could
be heard from every coach as they

200 free, Sanders took second, with a

personal best on 1:46-mid, while
Unger broke the two minute barrier
for a personal best with a 1:59:98.
Both swimmers were instrumental in
Swat's second place finishes in the
800 free relay later that night. Unger
dove in sth as the anchor leg, and ate
up the field to finally catch the second place team with five yards left.

Quicker Quakers as a swimming power.

The "fab four" freshmen guys (Sanders, Friedberg, Robbins and Devlin)
took second place and nearly broke
the college record.
In the 200 medley therewas a great
deal of drama as the Gettysburg team
false started, opening an opportunity
for the Swat men to take first. However, it was not to be. Despite crushing the college record by three seconds, they were touched out by an
inspired Washigton college relay. In
the women's race, Swat's team of
Duncan, Fulkerson, Sarah Werneck
and Unger broke the college record,
the conference record and the will of
the Gettysburg women to take first.
The iast day has traditionally been

the day for Swarthmore to dominate.
200's of stroke are what we train for
all year long, and with so much yardage put in this year, it was no surprise
that once again Swat ruled on Sunday. In the morning, trials of the 100
free saw Sanders top-seeded going
into finals. At night he swam a fantastic race to get a personal best and
a second place medal. Alice Unger
broke her own college record with a
speed demons time of 55:86. Karsten

"Vasa-man"Scherer-Nadal'9s swam
a lifetime best of 51:93 despite a
visibly excruciating ankle injury. It
was said of this classy senior that
there are few people as mentally tough
and as committed.
In the 200 back, Hamilton, Dickson
and Robbins all swam lifetime bests.
Robbins broke the college record by
four seconds coming in third, while
Hamilton tied to the hundreth theold
record held by Jason Greenwood'94.
It was particularly frustrating for Greg
because two years ago he had tied
Greenwood's old record to the
hundreth.In the women'srace Molly
Marino set a college record, swimming to a second-seed time. In the
mile, the most grueling event in swimming bar none, Friedberg swam a
personal best 17:12 to take 4th. The
200 breast saw Witt once again make
the national cut with an astonishing
2:10. He left the field behind, asserting his domination of the conference

breaststroke events.
In the 200 fly, Swarthmore entered 6 people, all of whom made top
16. Devlin tooksthwith a quick time
of 2:05 while the resident butterflier

extraordinare, Justin Herring once
again beat the Gettysburg top seed
with an incredible time of 1:55:94.
The time was good enough to qualify
Justin for two more weeks of swimming, waiting to see if heis invited to
nationals. What is most incredible
about theswim is that he went 2:00 in
the morning and looked sluggish. His
resolve to win that event, and his
unbridled joy at seeing what he had
done was an inspiration to every

swimmer in the pool. The women
looked tired for their last relay, but it
did not matter since they had amassed
enough points to ensure second place.
The men, coming closer to Gettysburg
than ever before, took third, and with
the talent and youth on the team, look
to finally provide the G'Burg Bullets
a challenge in the coming years. In
the final analysis, the swim team of

1994-95 was a determined, talented,
committed, and fun-loving group of
33. Everyone had the drive to accomplish, and sticking by our goals even
when it was hard to do made the end
of the season the phenomenal experience that it was; a truly exhilirating
aquatic experience.

Swat Wrestlers Take Fourth at Centennial Champs
By Matt Halpern

This past weekend, in what was
theculminationof an exciting season
of conferencerivalry, Swarthmore's
wrestling team competed in the Centennial Conference Championship at
Gettysburg College. This two day
event featured wrestlers from all of
the CentennialConferencemembers,
including Gettysburg College,
Haverford College, Johns Hopkins
University, Muhlenberg College,
Swarthmore College, Ursinus College, and Western Maryland University. The tournament, held annually,
determinestheconference champion,
and in order to compete for the championship, teams must have wrestled
all other participating conference
schools at some point in their season.
Weigh-ins for the championship
began at 5:30 pm Friday and were
followedup by the quarterfinal tournament drawings. Quarterfinal
matches began at 10:00 am on Saturday and were concluded at 12:00 pm,
at which time semifinal matches got
underway. The winners of the semifinal rounds advanced to the championship rounds, while the runners up
competed in consolation matches to
determine the third place finisher in
each weight class.

In an intense third place battle at
126 pounds, Chaz Teplin '96 finished up his stellar tournament performance by pinning Johns Hopkins'
Ray Kim in 1:39. At 150 pounds,

Alec Stall '9B lost a very close match,
by a score of 8-2, to Troy Dell from
Gettysburg College. GarnetCaptain
Mike Madden '95 was also edged out
in the consolation tournament at 177
pounds, losing 3-1 in an overtime
battle that went right down to the
wire against Muhlenberg College's

"The competition
was really good,
since so many
people had wrestled
before, and there
were a lot of grudge

matches."
-Pete Balvanz'9B
Ben Johnson.
The semifinalbouts were followed
by the championship matches, which
began at 4:00 pm and decided which
wrestlers wouldbe named to the prestigious All-Conference wrestling
team. At 167 pounds, co-captain
Eric Williams '95 lost to Todd
Rosenzweig of Johns Hopkins by a
score of 7-5. In this rematch of the

Ursinus College tri-meet two weeks
ago, thesetalented wrestlers squared
off in what unquestionably proved to
be some of the tournament's finest
wrestling. With 11 seconds left, and

the score tied at 5 points, Williams
tried to prevent thematch from going
into overtime, but his aggressiveness
caused him to make a mental error.
Rosenzweig capitalized on the mistake, capturing the conference championship.
At the 142 pound weight class,
Pete Balvanz '9B captured the
Garnet's lone championship title,
defeating Ursinus's Kirk Holt, the
former conference champion, by a
score of 9-5. Balvanz said of his
match, "I was in trouble a lot of the
time." The lead switched back and
forth between the two determined
wrestlers until Balvanz landed a
cradle move that put him ahead. He
managed tomaintain this lead through
the remainder of the match and
emerge victorious to claim the conference title.
"It was an especially exciting meet
They had an announcer who hyped
up all of the matches. Then, before
the finals, they has us all line up and
run outto the mats to music and it got
you really pumped up. It was also
really well run, with plenty ofbreaks
in between matches," said Balvanz.
"The competition was really good,
since so many people had wrestled
before, and there were a lot of grudge
matches."
Overall, the Garnet finished in
fourth place with 42 points, a respectable increase from last year's
sixth place ranking. Muhlenberg finished in first place with an impres-

sive 83.5 points and Gettysburg's
Jake Dell, who captured the conference championship at 158 pounds,
was voted the tournaments most outstanding wrestler.
This weekend the team will travel
to Ursinus College to compete in the

NCAA Division 111 Regional Qualifiers. The tournament will feature
almost twenty teams, and the winner
at each weight class will qualify to
compete in the national wrestling
tournament at Augustana College in
Augustana, Illinois.
