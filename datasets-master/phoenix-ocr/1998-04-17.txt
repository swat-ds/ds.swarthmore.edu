looking for someone to
watch their children while they are at work
or otherwise busy. These sitting jobs often
start as early as 6:00 a.m.
Presently, the issue of who cares for children when both parents work is receiving
national attention. The government is beginning to recognize companies and employers who assist their employees in getting access to quality care by offering them
tax credits. Being a tax-exempt institution,
Swarthmore cannot qualify for the same
benefits. For several years, however, the
Women's Concern Committee has been
campaigning for a campus child care facility, where quality care would be accessible to all members of the Swarthmore
community.
The Women's Concerns Committee
(WCC) was formed in 1981, and has dealt
with such issues as sexual misconduct, personal safety, and maternity leave. Each year
the committee chooses a specific area to
focus its time and effort on, and at the suggestion of President Al Bloom, this year's
WCC decided to reevaluate campus child
care options. According to committee
member Julia Welbon, "At present we are
trying to determine the best possible way
to use a fixed sum of money that was set
aside for this very purpose a number of
years ago, to best meet the child care needs
of this community."
The question of providing adequate child
care for College employees was first
brought to the floor in 1988 when theBoard
of Managers set aside of fund of approximately $300,000 designated as start-up
money for a child care center on campus.
At that time, the College began working

with Trinity Cooperative Day Nursery in
Swarthmore, who, it was hoped, would be
responsible for managing the center built
on campus.
However, according to Margaret T. Thompson, a consultant hired by the College
to participate in the planning process, "The
project ended when it was realized that,
although there might have been enough in
the fund to build a center, there were no
additional funds designated for a financial
aid policy which would have allowed access to the center by all employees of the
College. Tuition would have been costly
because one goal was to have high quality
child care and that is expensive. It became
an issue of fairness and equal opportunity."
There were members of the community
opposed to building a center on campus
because they did not feel that child care
was part of the mission of the College, and
thought that the allotted resources should
go to salaries and other benefits instead.
In 1993, the issue of child care surfaced
again without much resolution.
Marie Dalton, an employee at Tarble,
does not believe that child care at Swarthmore is a feasible option: "It wouldn't work
because people just can't afford it." The
WCC recognizes that financial aid is still
its major stumbling blockand members see
no point in pursuing a center if it could not
be. made accessible to all members of the
community. Thus, the committee has continued to discuss the subject of how the
College could offer a financial aid program
that would make care available to all employees. At the suggestion of Vice President for Finance and Planning Paul
Aslanian, the College decided to convert
the money that was set aside in 1988 from
a static account to an income-bearing account. By acting as a quasi-endowment, the
account could produce an income ofaround
$lO,OOO a year without touching the capital. It is anticipated that this money will
enable the College to develop a program

Campus Staff Child Care
Initiative Gains Momentum

Recycling Changes
Prompt Concerns
Among Students
Reports of recyclable materials being
dumped into trash bins on campus have
raised concerns that shifting the responsibility for recycling from students to staff
may have compromised the effectiveness
of the campus recycling program.
Prior to 1995,the recycling program was
coordinated and carried out entirely by students. In 1995 and 1996, however, the
College shifted responsibility for the program from student to staff management,
citing several student vehicular accidents
in driving recycled materials around campus and general inefficiency as reasons for
the change.
Previously, students were responsible for
collecting and sorting recycling bins in
dorms and other buildings, driving recycling trucks from building to building, and
organizing the material at a central processing area near DuPont. Kate Schneider
'9B served as Student Recycling Coordinator until her position was eliminated in
the reorganization.
Schneider feels the shift to staff control
has diminished the quality and meaning
of the program. "Our basic complaint is
that the current recycling program is not
being completed with the care that students
had. Now when there are recyclables in the
wrong bin, the staff just dump them into
the trash. Of course, they are well within
their rights, but students would take the
time and make the effort to sort all the
bins," she says.
There have been several reports of the
contents of recycling bins being dumped
into trash containers. One student told the
Phoenix that, "I was working in Hicks
around 6:30 a.m. when the house keepers
first come to clean-up. I was working at a
computer and watched the guy as he transferred the contents of the paper recycling
bin to the trash bin. He then took the trash
bin out of the room (I assume to be emptied). I do not know if this is an isolated
incident, but I feel the employees need to
know why recycling is important and need
to be reminded by a supervisor that it is
their job to recycle."
Schneider feels thatwhile "students care
about recycling, environmental service
workers recycle as part of their job." When
the program was run by students, there was
"massive involvement," according to
Schneider. "We had to turn students away
from jobs. We had more than enough students volunteering to help."
There have been efforts to revitalize the
student recycling program, but such campaigns have proven unsuccessful.
Schneider believes the administration has
been "unresponsive" and "does not care
enough about environmental consciousness on the part of the College. The shift
to staff control showed a great deal of disrespect for students," says Schneider.
Jeff Jabco, of Facilities Management,
now coordinatesthe recycling program. He
did not return phone calls from The Phoenix seeking comment on the recycling program.

"Rising from
the ashes..."

diversity should be mandatory: "Not until we get white
students as angry and upset about these tensions [as
students of minority groups are] will there be change.
It has to be done by all of us."
Clayton-Pedersen also passed around an article describing a "multimedia package" she produced while
in her present tenure as Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs at the Peabody College of
Vanderbilt University. The purpose of the package is
to "foster racial and ethnic diversity" and includes interactive CD-ROM material to help college students,
especially incoming freshmen, learn about issues of
diversity. Students don't always know what to do when
they see another student scrawling hate speech,
Clayton-Pedersen told her audience, and learning tools
like a multimedia packages could help them learn about
this and other situations. Students need "similar goals,
resources and capacity to pull it all together," she said.
Although she offered responses that kept discussion
lively, Clayton-Pedersen also seemed to independently
corroborate much of the College's current policy on
student conduct. When asked whether she would respond with adjudication and punishment for students
found responsible for hate speech incidents, ClaytonPedersen said she was not a strong believer in punishment, per se. While noting that creating an unsafe campus environment required punishment and/or expulsion,
she said the College's first approach should be one of
"education" for the offender. Swarthmore currently
responds to any first-time hate-speech offense with
education for the offender.

The Search Process

President Has Final Say
by Andy Murray

After months ofwork by search committee members and two weeks of open student meetings with
final-round candidates, the College's Dean Search
Committee (DSC) is preparing to make its final recommendation for a new Dean to President Al
Bloom. While the DSC is meant to voice the opinions of a cross-section of college students, faculty,
and staff, the final decision will rest ultimately with
Bloom.
According to Jacobs, reports in last week's Phoenix that Bloom would simply rubber stamp the decision arrived at by the DSC were incorrect "The
committee exists to advise Al," says Professor of
Biology Mark Jacobs, who is chairing the DSC
"Our conclusion is a recommendation to him."
According to DSC member Amy Albert '9B, however, Bloom has told the DSC that he wants the
decision to be made primarily by the committee.
From this point on, Bloom will sit in on the DSC

deliberations.
Some have questioned whether three student representatives to the DSC none of whom is a student ofcolor—can accurately represent the entire
student body. Both Albertand Jacobs attributed the

A Letter to "The Specs"
We direct this week's editorial to you, the accepted students who are
considering whether to join us in the fall as fellow Swatties or to grace
another fine institution with your presence. As a small college, we feel
that Swarthmore has a great deal to offer in terms of opportunities. Its
small size provide students with more opportunities for interaction with
professors and each other. In addition, for those who participated in extracurricular activities in high school should you decide to come here, you
will immediately be presented with opportunities to accept significant responsibility. One Editor-in-Chief of this paper is a sophomore, several
freshmen are listed staff members. Freshmen serve on student council
and all but one member of the committee that welcomes you now and will
do so in the fall is currently afreshman. Several freshmen edit magazines.
For the most part, similar levels of opportunity exist on athletic teams on
both the varsity and club levels. Indeed, few members of the nationally
ranked women's Ultimate team played in high school. While many of
these opportunitiesare not unique to Swarthmore, but rather small schools
in general, Swarthmore's generous endowment allows for a higher quality
and degree of activity. You should be aware of some things that are the
other side ofthis medal, sports are participatory rather than spectator events
here, lower in key than at most high schools. In addition, since so few
students fill so few activities, the quality ofparticipation may be of a lower
than of a school where areas such as journalism are more professionalized.
Academically, Swarthmore's small size and rigor are simultaneously its
greatest assets and drawbacks. While our college's size allows for a great
degree of academic interaction, we are also limited in the number of courses
we offer. While we are virtually unique among liberal arts colleges in
having an engineering program as well as one in computer science, large
universities have departments analogous to some of our courses. In addition, the rigor of Swarthmore's courses, which teach students to think in
each particular discipline, like economist, physicists, historians, or biologists, may be both a threatening and exciting prospect. If you want a high
degree of intellectual interaction among students and faculty Swarthmore
is an excellent choice, exemplifying the benefits of a small liberal arts
college. On the other hand, if you prefer large lecture classes, excellent
athletics, or a highly directed program of study in a discipline other than
engineering, Swarthmore may not best serve your needs.
There is of course, much more to any college than the straitjacketed
institutional perspective. Every college campus takes on a unique life of
its own that transcends its existence as simply an educational mechanism.
As difficult and unfair as it is to characterize Swarthmore with a few allencompassing phrases, we as a community do embody a certain culture.
Swarthmore is a serious-minded place. When we party, we party hard,
but when we work, boy do we work. And we don't work just like any
other college student does
we profess an almost theological attachment to it. "Guilt without sex," as a popular T-shirt slogan described the
Swarthmore attitude towards study most succinctly. The key phrase is total immersion. Ten-hour working streaks in the library or at the computing center are not unheard of. All-nighters have become an integral part of
our routines. Idleness is a taboo. Students literally feel an uneasy conscience when they find themselves outside of the confines of McCabe and
Cornell libraries. The good of virtue of diligence finds its most cogent
expression here amongst our student body. You'll leave this place thinking to yourself, "Wow, I never knew I could work this much."
Just like we are serious about our work, we take about everything else
seriously as well. At Swarthmore it's cool to be intellectual. As much as
we try to disengage ourselves from academic discourse during our offtime,
somehow the philosopher in us always unconsciously emerges to the surface at a late Saturday night party. Every single tree on campus is meticulously labelled by the arboretum staff for the amateur botanist. Partly due
to the smallness of the school itself, relationships and friendships are intense because we constantly try to examine them just like we take apart a
chemical reaction in orgo. There are days spent absorbed in deep introspection, thinking about the purpose of human existence and the meaning
of life.
This is Swarthmore as we know it. And we sincerely hope that you grow
to love it over the course of your stay here. But the bottom line is, as much
as we hope that every accepted student would decide to come here, we
feel that it is most important for you to choose the college that is right for
you. As is often said here, we urge you to explore your options and the
situation. In your time here, feel free to question Swatties about our college, they will certainly be flattered by your interest and glad to help you
in making your decision.

To Arms,

Presidential

Look at Swarthmore College; open it up
and look inside. There, you see springtime,
you see life bursting; you see fortunate and
fulfilled youth, full of hope. Now look
outside of Swarthmore College. Outside
you see poverty, injustice, death, hordes of
people for whom hope is no longer an option. There is a certain degree of wrvngness in the world that is often, tragically,
overlooked by those of higher fortune. I
know that I must often chide myself for
forgetting that life is not the same for us
all.
Whatever illusions I might have had, the
thoughts that made me forget the outside,
began to crumble when I first saw on the
news that two young boys, aged thirteen
and eleven, shot and killed four classmates
and a teacher in a small town Arkansas
school. (Confession: I was not watching
the news when I heard this; it was during a
"Fox News Brief while I was watching
The Simpsons.) "How awful," I thought; I
then went about the business of pursuing
other endeavors. Weeks later, putting off
reading Sartre in our hall's lounge, I found
an old issue of Newsweek with a picture of
the two alleged murderers on the cover. Remembering how shocked I was when I first
heard of the tragedy, I opened the magazine and I started to read.
Five people died in Jonesboro, one of
them carrying an unborn child, and the
other four no older than twelve. Why? The
answer: there is an old picture of one of
the boys, no more than three or four years
old, smiling joyously while dressed in camouflage and holding a rifle in his hands, a
real, lethal, shoots-deadly-bullets rifle. On
a turn of the page, one is greeted with another photograph of the same child, this
time six years old, looking coolly down the
length of a handgun, learning how to shoot
it. The boy was sixyears old, and he looked
like he was part of an elite government
training program to form the ultimate killing machine. To me, this is not a recipe
for success. The fact remains that when

This past Monday, President Clinton announced a permanent ban on the import of
almost every foreign-made semiautomatic
rifle
rifles which had been declared legal by the ATF just a couple years earlier.
In enacting this moratorium, Clinton expressed his desire to "do whatever it takes
to save the lives of our people" and close a
"loophole" that allowed manufacturers to
"circumvent" the 1994 Assault Weapons
Ban. Well, Mr. Clinton, you've got a lot to
learn.
First of all, when the ban on cosmeticallychallenged firearms took effect in 1994
(foreign and domestic), the firearms industry immediately changed their products to
COMPLY with this drivel. The bill prohibits certain features, such as flash suppressors and bayonet lugs, none of which
change the function of the gun. Congratulations, Bill...you've now made the AR-15
look prettier. Maybe you should require
pink bows and painted flowers for all guns
in your next bill.
'•
But, you may ask, isn't there an overriding public safety concern motivating laws
like this? Well, actually, military caliber
rifles (some of which aren't "assault" rifles)
account for only eight tenths of one percent of all homicides in the U.S. (FBI Uniform Crime Reports, 1991) with all rifles
accounting for 3.7%. Smaller studies in
Maryland, Florida, Massachusetts, California, and New Jersey have come up with
similarresults. As for police officers feloniously killed, 3% were murdered with
"assault" rifles, with 12% being killed by
their own weapon (J. of California Law
Enforcement).
' What led up to the decision to ban the

A Hidden Agenda.
import of these guns? Well, of course we
all know that foreign made guns are so
much more deadly and menacing than
those made in the good old U.S.A. Clinton
and his liberal brain trust ordered the ATF
to review these firearms with reference to
a law passed in 1968 that (among other
filings) requires imported guns to be "suitable or readily adaptable for sporting purposes." The ATF's decision was not made
public, and Clinton signed the order shortly
thereafter.
The 1968 law was crafted by Sen. Thomas Dodd (D-CT), a man who had been a
prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials following the fall ofNazi Germany, While investigating for the trials, he took a particular
interest in the Nazi Weapons Law of 1938,
a measure thatrequired civilian-owned firearms to be "sporting" guns to eliminate the
possibility of armed resistance to a tyrannical state. He even requested a copy and
translation four months before presenting
the 1968 law. Dodd also proposed a national gun registry (because everyone
knows that criminals register their guns),
similar to the system used in Germany to
disarm the Jewish and Gypsy populations
prior to their near extermination.The law's
resemblance to that of the Nazi law was so
profound that Rep. John Dingell (D-MI)
testified at the hearings that he feared a
similarresult could take place here if such
a- law were passed. Well, it's the law, and
Clinton is taking full advantage of it.
'•.
If one looks back at every major genocide in this century, there is at least one
common factor that facilitated each: The
disarming of the subjected people. When
the Turks slaughtered thousands ofArmenians in 1917, they first disarmed them.
Joseph Stalin's bloody reign was also preceded by strict gun control and widespread
confiscation. More recently, Clinton just
returned from Uganda, another country
with a complete ban on civilian gun ownership. You'll notice that he didn't mention
the gun ban while down there. That's probably because of the thousands of dead(and
unarmed) Ugandans, killed by Idi Amin's
government, that strongly suggest that gun
control may not be such a great idea after
aJJ. Ferdinand Marcos, Fidel Castro, the
Bulgarian communists, and many others
have all ordered complete confiscation of
firearms. There's just something a little
fishy about a President that doesn't trust
his own people to have firearms suitable

fbr self-defense.
; There is only one reason that the framers
of the Constitution had in mind when they
wrote the Second Amendment, and it
wasn't to preserve duck hunting or maintain the National Guard. By securing an
abundance of military power in the general populace, the framers knew that unjust laws could never be enforced by an
armed and tyrannical government. The late
Vice PresidentHubert Humphrey put it best
when he said that "the right of citizens to
bear arms is just one more guarantee
against arbitrary government, one more
safeguard against the tyranny which now
appears remote in America, but which historically has proved to be always possible."
Clinton's import ban is certainly not a step
toward tyranny, but it has helped destroy
one more method of preventing it.

N. Ireland: A New Hope?
The history of Anglo-Irish relations is
so long that each development recalls older
ones, for the most part failures. With
memory of these failures comes a recollection of painful disagreement. This principle even holds for agreements, such as
last week's truly historic compromise. The
agreement will be voted upon in referenda
in both the Republic of Ireland and the
North. It is the first to have been reached
between representatives of people of the
North, rather than the British and Irish governments. While a few hard-liners boycotted the talks, the agreement accurately
reflects a compromise between the vast
majority of the Catholics and Protestants
of the North, and represents a significant
turning point in Anglo-Irish relations.
Sadly, this may not be enough, given both
history and currents too deep for the negotiations to cover.
As George Mitchell, the former Senator
who chaired the talks hoped, both sides
can claim a victory of sorts. Unionists can
be secure in the knowledge that until they
are outnumbered, the North will remain a
British province. In addition, the Republic has agreed to rescind its largely symbolic constitutional claim to the North.
This represents a very sore point to Unionists who argue it represents a conspiracy
to remove them from power. Republicans
draw strength from a new North-South
Council that will deal with affairs such as
agriculture and tourism. In what should be
viewed as a positive change for both sides,
the North will now be ruled by its own Parliament akin to Wales and Scotland's new
devolved assemblies, rather than directly
from London. This forces the two sides to
live together, although given history, Republicans will be wary of gerrymandering
and other such practices Unionists have
used in their favor. Above all, the agreement firmly establishes the principle that
the North will be ruled by the state by
which a majority of its citizens wishes to
be ruled. While Irish Republicans will feel
colonized (with reason) until Ireland is
united underrule from Dublin, this agreement sets forth the principle that the North
is part of Britain because of its Unionist
population rather than explicit British desire to hold onto its first and last colony.
In addition, the agreement makes official
the Irish policy of granting citizenship to
Northern Republicans (such as Mary
McAleese, the President of the Republic
of Ireland), while recognizing the right of

the people of the North to be officially considered Irish and/or British nationals.
While both referenda should ratify the
agreement, this does not ensure its success.
Hard-line Unionists long for the days of
the discriminatory Ulster plantation and the
subsequent periods of triumphalist colonial rule. Hardline Republicans cite the
same times as evidence for their moral imperative to regain the landtaken from them,
which cannot be achieved by anything
short of a united Ireland. Many Unionists
dislikethe increasing ascendancy ofCatho-

unbridgable gap.
lie Republicans, who have begun to overcome discrimination to establish themselves as an economic and political force.
Unionists fear what the Irish in the North
and Republic see as inevitable, a united
Ireland, even if it represents the will of a
majority. This is understandable for any
group losing it hegemony, but the denial
of the form of democratic government favored by the majority is never justified.
Still, right-wing Protestant radicals such
as the Rev. Lan Paisley have already begun
to rail against the agreement. For Republicans, the agreement represents their goal
of a united Ireland being put on the long
finger, to use an Irish expression. Just as
"die-hards" found the 1922 Treaty, which
established a divided Ireland, unacceptable, despite its support in a referendum,
some Republican extremists may wish to
continue their fight for a united Ireland.
That conflict led to the Irish Civil War,
whose legacy divides the Republic to this
day.
It is impossible to know whether these
factors will ultimately ruin the agreement,
but they could challenge it. Certainly, one
can easily argue that as many have justice
and history deserve more. Although they
have now'been established for centuries,
the Unionists are the descendants of British colonists who evicted the native Irish
from their lands, enslaved them, and later
forced many of them to starve. This led to
the Irish Diaspora of which the Potato
Famine is only the most famous event.
After 1922, Unionists attempted to continue their hegemony through policies bor-

dering on apartheid and thereby consolidate their power in the North. This history,
which caused the present Troubles, unfortunately cannot be solved. Northern Ireland
as a unit had no basis in history until the
Government of Ireland Act created it to
consolidate the largest area in which the
British government could maintain an
Unionist majority. While the present agreement provides hope, it does not remove this
dark legacy, which sadly, is only acknowledged on sectarian grounds.
The best that can be done is the virtually
impossible task of the two sides making at
least some degree of reconciliation. It is
virtually impossible to explain the power
of both David Trimble and Gerry Adams
standing together behind the agreement.
Powerful, thought it is, the agreement is but
a first step. Eight centuries of struggle will
only end when both sides can live together
without mutual distrust, as Catholics and
Protestants do in the Republic of Ireland.
As long as physical "peace walls" divide
Catholic and Protestant communities,
schools typically remain segregated, and
the UlsterUnionist Party refuses to do business with Sinn Fein, no long term compromise can be reached. Since Catholics have
been rapidly thanProtestants, barring an unforeseen even, the North will eventually
contain a Republican majority. Both the
British and Irish peoples, throughout the
two islands, and indeed the world deserves
better than to let extremists ruin a workable agreement. The Irish pride themselves
on being the one of the first indigenous
peoples to throw off the colonial thrall, pioneering methods that would be used worldwide. If this agreement stands perhaps it
can set an example and provide hope for
the sectarian conflicts that have come with
the post-colonial era, as well as the arbitrary division of various peoples.

empathy, n. a theoretical emotional phenomenon whereby a person steps into another person's
shoes. Human beings find this concept too inconvenient to put into
practice.

children are given guns they will shoot
them.
On the day of the shooting, the two boys,
after stealing an uncle's truck, drove to a
relative's farm where they stole handfuls
of pistols and two rifles, with which they
are reported to have shot over twenty
people with a deadly, sniper-like accuracy.
I am dismayed that children who should
be playing at Monopoly are playing at
"kill". I am more dismayed that the rifles
they are supposedly to have used are built
and equipped in such a way thatpractically
anyone who has even touched a gun would
be able to produce similar accuracy.
What is wrong with thispicture? We have
two young boys, one with a sordid and difficult childhood, the other raised like he's
John Conner from The Terminator, who
now sit in prison and literally ask to sit on
their grandmothers' laps when they visit.
We have unprotected and unguarded rifles
sitting in someone's home that in some
perverse zeal to kill are equipped to allow
even the grossest of bunglers to shoot with
perfect accuracy from hundreds of feet
away. (Fact: Sixteen percent of all guns
are kept in the house unprotected and
loaded.) We have five people senselessly
dead, irredeemably lost to the world. We
have a town that will not be the same for a
long time to come.
We have these things. They belong to
us, to Jonesboro, to those children and
those children's parents. There is no questioning that. The only question that remains is, "why?" After all this horror, I
can only come to one conclusion: The
worldis broken. How else can one describe
what has happened? I'm not sure that it
ever was not broken. But this is the important part: it can be fixed. I have hope
that the world is not lost to us. We must
recognize that, like so many other atrocities from the past, the tragedy in Jonesboro
is a call to arms that shouts in as loud a
voice as any commander; the only difference is that instead of shouting "Kill!
Kill!", the voice is calling, "Help!", and
help we must, lest we face this brand of
tragedy that has marked Jonesboro.
How can we allow such things to continue? How can we raise children who
believe that such an act is any kind of answer or any kind of thing that humans can
or should do? The problem with having
such children is that those who are not arrested for shooting their friends often grow
up to be adults who think that anger, hatred, and aggression are part of the default
human condition. What do we do about
this? I wish that I knew. I only know that
the fact that I can even write about such
things is an infringement on all things good.
And so, to arms! To arms, Swarthmore!
To arms, and help us all finally fix this tired
world.

Huang Talks About Career, AsianAmerican Identity at LPAC Lecture
Hwang says that he does not write for a

specific audience but for himself. It is after he has written the work that he discovers how wide an audience it appeals to. "I
don't know what is going to be successful
and what is not so I just have to write what

I am interested in," he says. Hwang is concerned that he is writing for the
"Orientalia" however, because only a minority of people can afford to attend plays
in general. Along these lines, his future
projects include two movies, which will
be accessible to a wideraudience. The first
is a film about a woman named Texas
Guinan, a famous nightclub host in New
York during prohibition, which will be directed by Martin Scorsese and star Bette
Midler. He is also working on another
movie for Robin Williams.
For his next theater production, Hwang
is writing a musical based on the Rogers
and Hammerstein movie Flower Drum
Song, where he will use all of the original
songs, but write a completely new script.

Search Process
from Dean Search, page I
lack of minority student presence on the
DSC to a dearth of applications at the beginning of the dean search process. "What
was disappointing was that there were only
ten or so applicants in total," says Jacobs.
Both he and Albert say that one first-year
student of color applied to be on the committee, but was turned down when it was
decided only sophomores, juniors, and seniors would be chosen. "They [first-years]
only would have been on campus a few

weeks," explains Jacobs.
In order to increase input from the whole
student body, the DSC moved to set up an
additional Student Search Committee
(SSC) that would conduct phone interviews
with semi-finalists on their own and then
collaborate with the DSC. "We also solicited student nominations," saysAlbert. She
notes that former Intercultural Center Director Fernando Chang-Muy was nominated by students, but decided not to apply.
Since the finalists began visiting campus,
student participation has picked up. "It's
considerably more students than were involved in previous searches," says Albert
about the numbers of students attending
meetings with the finalists. "While 50 to
70 people isn't fabulous," she says, "I think
its quite good given the nature of Swat."
The DSC is now soliciting feedback in
the form of lettersfrom those who attended
the meetings with the candidates. Jacobs
has praised the quality of letters coming
from all divisions of the college community, calling them "long, reasoned and thorough." He said the DSC had received about
70 letters as of Wednesday, but admits that
the letters do not show any consensus.
"Each of the four [finalists] have been the
first choice of several different people."
It is still unclear how much room the DSC
will give Bloom to maneuver in making a
decisionthat still abides by the committee's
recommendation. The DSC has not yet
decided whether it will recommend one
finalist or two, says Albert.
Most involved in the dean search process,
however, seem to feel that student input in
the process already has surpassed the level
reached in previous dean searches. Associate Dean Tedd Goundie is the only current search committee member who also
sat on the search committee that interviewed former Dean of the College Ngina
Lythcott. According to Goundie, the recent
search has made more room for student
opinion. "We certainly didn't have a student interview group in the last search," he
says, referring to the SSC.
Jacobs sees the change as an important
one. "This is the highest officer students
have in the College. If anyone should have
extra say, I think they should."

He became interested in remaking Flower
Drum Song because of the complex feelings many Asian-Americans have about
the film. "There are many things that are
offensive about it and yet privately, people
enjoy it. I think that there are some really
great points to the movie. The fact that
Rogers and Hammerstein in 1958 had the
integrity to put together an all-Asian cast,
and the leading roles are bothAsians who
fall in love with each other was really radical at the time," he says.
Hwang wants to be remembered in the
Asian-American community for fostering
more openness and more diversity within
the community itself. He hopes to play a
role in breaking that down the myth that
the Asian community is homogenous, by
helping people realize the diverse communities within "AsianAmerica."
"Now there is so much diversity, so
many kind of Asian-Americans in this
country, so much intermarriage, I think
that the whole parameters of what constitutes Asian-America need to be reconsidered," he says.

On April 22, Earth Day 1998, the CollegePlanning Committee(CPC) will meet,
in part, to discuss a letter written to them
by three environmental studies concentrators. The letter, say the students, "represents an effort to shed light on both concerns and creative solutions regarding the
role of our institution, Swarthmore College, as a steward ofits impacts on the environment."
The three seniors
Tirian Mink, Carl
Mas, and Jon Makler
are all currently
enrolled in the Environmental Studies
Capstone Seminar, which completes their
concentrations in environmental studies. A
practical attachment requirement for the
course brought the three students together
and resulted in their writing of the CPC
letter.
In early January, Mink, Makler, and Mas
decided to examine the reactive and proactive ways the college community has
dealt with environmental issues that have
arisen at Swarthmore. In doing so, they
have met with Professor Carr Everbach for
advice and course materials from his 1993
class "Swarthmore and the Biosphere;"
Vice President Maurice Eldridge who
guided them to write the letter to the CPC;
Vice President Larry Schall to discuss the
ways in which facilities impact the environment and potential improvements; Tom
Cochrane in the Physical Plant to discuss
some specific courses of action related to
energy and water conservation; as well as
faculty on the Environmental Studies Concentration Committee to discuss some faculty and curricular ideas.
Through these meetings the seniors have
encountered many different opinions concerning environmental awareness at the
College. Each segment of the community
has felt that certain avenues prescribed in
the letter could lead to the right kind of

change, but consensus as to which avenue should be taken
has
been
not
reached.
The concerns as
describes
Mink
them have been supported by many different members of
the college community. As Mink puts it,

echoed College policy by expressing a strong objection to

calling anonymous hatespeech "cowardly." Talking
specifically about hate speech

were willing to be out at Swarthmore, their critics should be
similarly willing to stand behind their convictions.
At times, Clayton-Pedersen
also offered opinions that suggested there may be significant

changes in student life if she is
made Dean of the College.
Clayton-Pedersen, for example,
disclosedher feeling that support
groups should open their meetings to all interested parties. Currently, not all support groups at
Swarthmore are required to be
open. Clayton-Pedersen noted
that while her view may be unpopular with some students, paid
staff facilitators of support
groups in particular have a responsibility to teach all students.
However, she also admitted that
under certain circumstances, support groups may require "privacy" and could thus be allowed
to hold closed meetings.

), .
The committee is also hoping to raise
funds among the alumnae. "Many of thefh'
would be interested in seeing that good,
quality child care is available," believes"
Welbon. "They themselves are contending
with how to meet the demands of career
and family in a balanced way. They would
like to see Swarthmore as part of the solu
tion."
The committee continues to work with
the Trinity Cooperative Day Nursery as it
decides how to best meet child care needs
and demonstrate the demand for greater
resources. In the long run says Welbon,
"We expect the center to strengthen' and
very much enhance the College commu;
nity. It could be a place where students
could work, train, and be exposed to good,
quality care." Students on campus agree.
According to Annie Kittler 'Ol, "Good
child care seems hard to come by. You're
always reading or hearing about some awful incident of neglect or abuse that occurs
■"
at certain facilities."
While there has not been considerable
dialogue on the topic, the community has
shown support whenever it has come
derdiscussion. Faculty and staffrealize just
how fragile child care arrangements can
be on a day-to-day basis: if any one thing,
goes awry with a child care plan, the whole
day can fall apart. Kate Corbett would be
thrilled to see the College open a facility:
"I could go back to working days and even
get to see my son at lunch, spending some
quality time with him."
Thompson, who continues to work with
the College as a longtime child care specialist and consultant, presently assists the '
community by helping low-income employees with child care needs to apply for
government-subsidized child care. Once
they are eligible, they are directed to a program fit to meet their needs. She also as-*
sists those employees who do not qualify
for subsidized care. In addition, the College offers a phone service called
Carebridge that provides employees with
a list of resources that help them identify
child care providers appropriate to their
needs. The WCC has drafted a policy describing this employee benefit, but recent
changes in government subsidies have
forced them to modify their original plan's.
The committee is having a group of College lawyers look at the policy to make sure
that they are on a productive track. Atpresent, the policy is under consideration 1
as part of the College's long-range planning initiative, and is in the hands of the
Benefits Committee and Barbara Carrollv

sponsibility to promote environmental
awareness and to make genuine efforts to
decrease its impact. Swarthmore College
has no institutional environmental policy
or written standard of environmental ethics. Also, the avenues through which a
group or individual must go in order to
advocate such policies or standards are
cumbersome, and often those recommendations fall on deaf ears." The actions described in the letter explore several different institutional changes that Swarthmore
could adopt. From the creation of a committee to deal with environmental issues
to a campus environmental coordinator, the
seniors have attempted to create many different models for change.
Not all responses to the Capstoners' pro-

they should not limit the amount of time
given to other important issues. We feel it
would therefore be appropriate to create an
ad hoc community to address the specifics
issues in our letter."
Mas, Mink, and Makler all feel that they
have only started a conversation that will
continue into the next academic year. For
this reason, they have involved younger
members of the community in an effort to
create a sustained call for change. As
Makler explains, "We do not pretend that
our efforts have been exhaustive; we feel
passionately about the goals that are described in the letter and have attempted to
make a considered contribution. We expect
that the CPC will beable to take this information and with continued input from the
community, lead this institution to a state
of greater environmental responsibility."

posals have been favorable. According to
Everbach, some faculty members have reacted to these suggestions with the objection that the College is already top-heavy
with a large bureaucracy that is growing
each year. With this in mind, some do not
know if further growth in the administration is the appropriate step for Swarthmore
to take.
One of the first steps that Mas feels the
institution should take involves the creation
of an ad hoc committee to discussion the
goals and actions described in the letter.
"We feel that the CPC has many important
and time consuming issues on their plate
as they address the long range planning
process. It seems that the issues, we raise
should be part of this discussion, however,

Earth Week '9B
Crummy Advice
The Bear (as told to Katie Menzer)
'Dear Bear,
Since pre-frosh weekend is now upon us, I've
b6'en thinking of my own ignorantly blissful
days of college applications and acceptances.
I was so wide-eyed and well-reste'd. An allnighter back then meant I had to work from
dinner time until midnight without a nap and
wijh only an hour-long break to watch 90270
and .eat the white chocolate chunk macadamia
nut cookies my mom had baked me for a snack.
J.feel for those poor, plump, contented, clean,
little pre-frosh who still have relatively healthy
senses of self-worth. This weekend, as they
happily skip throughthe hallways of our college and mack on each other when they think
\Vearen't watching or mocking them, they will
have absolutely no idea what awaits them.
Do you, bear, have any suggestions for helpirig the specs to realize their sleepless fate before it is too late for them, as it now is for me.

Thanks,
AThilanthropist
Dear Phil,
First of all, the carnivorous, advice-giving
bear who lives in the Crum would like to extend a warm greeting to all the specs who are
now visiting the Swarthmore campus. The bear
hopes that you get a chance while you are visiting to explore the majestic landscape that is
our arboretum. Don't forget, all you artless,
tender children, to take a lengthy stroll through
the blackened depths of the Crum. There are
many beautiful sites to behold in the Crum,
especially at night when you are utterly alone
arid truly snookered.
The Bear believes that your concern for the
pre-frosh is as touching as it is warranted,
though I have to wonder why you care. Since
in the grand tradition of Swarthmore students,
Swatties don't do anything unless they are getting pay or credit, I've got to question whose
back pocket you've been warming. Perhaps the
Biology department has finally given up its
previous wily methods of discouraging students who want to major in the department
thiough subtle innuendo and grade deflation
and has decided that the only way to decrease
the'department's draw on students is to decrease the drawing pool.
Biiit whatever your inspiration, we must admit that while the college does all sorts of
things to help ease the transition from the students' happy, happy high school days to the
miserable, life-sucking years they experience
ia.college, they don't have many programs to
discourage kids from accepting their admittance to Swarthmore in the first place. If the
kiddies knew what they were getting themselves into, you can bet your bippy that they'd
give-Williams a second look, even if it is only
ranked number two.
-The solution seems obvious to me. Where in
the application process do young upstarts
their first taste ofSwarthmore's humanity?The
admissions interview, of course. It is at the interview that the specs can get an initial premonition of what the following four years will be
like.. The interview is, therefore, the natural
place that specs should truly experience Swat
life and determine for themselves if they are
up to the challenge.
Swarthmore should start training a crack
te.am of militant interviewers who will be dispatched to the four corners of the globe to discourse with all perspective students. All interviews must be held in small, cramped, foulsmelling, darkened rooms infested with one or
two aggressive and hyperactive roaches. The
iriterviewers can only ask the specs questions
that they know the specs can't answer, like what
was the precise population of Paraguay in 1976
or how many licks does it take to get to the
center of a Tootsie Roll Pop if the licker's
tongue was partially mutilated in a horrible
industrial farming accident. The interviewer
must ask the specs these esoteric questions for,
at, least, 76 hours without stopping for sleep or
sustenance. Once the inquiry portion of the
interview is completed, the specs will be directed toward a room filled with refrigerated
compartments thatcontain only bottles of kiwi
and penguin-butt flavored water and told to
assemble a nutritious meal. The interview will
conclude with several hours of unprovoked
criticism and debasement by both the interviewer and several of the interviewee's peers.
;Of course, this whole process will depend
on the sincere dedication of the interviewers.
The specs will beg for leniency, but the interviewer must hold his or her ground. That's why,
I believe, Swatalums wouldperfect candidates
fpr the position. Who is more impervious to
the suffering of others than an embittered,
raegalomaniacal Swat student with a taste for
revenge? Plus, Swat alums could probably use
the extra income to help pay back their student loans.

Ivona Redraws Boundaries of Sumptousness
by Anne Fricke
and Deborah Stein
The Frear Ensemble Theatre has been
transformed. Go see Ivona, Princess of
Burgundia and you'll see what I mean.
The chaotic and colorful set designed by
AmberFrank '99 is the beginning of the
transformation; you walk through the
doors, ducking around furniture and
rubble suspended in space, finding your
way to your seat at you tread over a floor
that looks as if the New York Times exploded in kindergarten colors. The wild
costumes and lighting design by Kara
Herzog '9B only add to the strangely
beautiful, harsh tone of the atmosphere.
Things are...off. The set consumes you
as you sit in your seat, no longer an innocent audience member, safe to hide in
the dark.
Ivona, an absurd and dark allegory by
Polish playwright Witold Gombrowicz,
brings you terrifyingly close to this offkilter world. The court parades slowly
around the stage to the tune of a dissonant fanfare (sound design by Greg
Ingber '99, adds a nice eerie undertone
to the performance); the queen waves
and coos, the gentlemen of the court leer

seductively behind her back at the audience. You suddenly realize you're not in
Swarthmore anymore. What a relief.
These are not the Windsors. This royal
family is grotesque, decadent, and decayed. They are excessively disgusting,
both inside and out
and yet consider
themselves beautiful and elegant. They
are concerned only with exterior appear-

Royalty at its most
grotesque.
ances, upholding certain rules of propriwhile living in a junk heap.
ety

The transformation established by the
set is carried through with the performances of the stellar cast. Acrobatic,
dynamic and polished, the actors work

the chaotic set, floundering in the turmoil
of their kingdom. In Ivona, royalty has
less to do with material wealth and more
to do with the luxury of what you can do
to others.
As assembled by director Erin Watson
'9B and stage manager Kim Gallup '9B,
the actors push the limits of what is ac-

ceptable, behaving as cruel, sexy, devious,
and violent as they possibly can. The cruelty of the court, carried off with finesse
with such talent as Andrea Johnson '9B,
Kevin Kish, '9B, Tim Merkel '99, Jim
Harker '99 is at first amusing in its colorful pettiness; only later do we discover the
dark depths of which they are capable. Kish
and CatLaine '9B, ooze with slime and sex
in certain moments, and Michael Williams
'9B carries off royal outrage with delightful charm. Doug Berger '9B heightens the
estrangement of this kingdom in his quirky
performance as an unwanted servant.
As the play progresses, the disturbance
caused by the virtually silent yet intense
Ivona (Jessica Smith '99) throws the court
of balance. The disturbing part is that the
court's turmoil is its own fault: "Am I not
rich enough to take on this misery?" Prince
Philip asks. Suddenly, identities are
skewed (literally
Watson employs the
bold and risky technique ofrole switching).
The frightening truth becomes apparent:
without the social conventions to hold them
safely in their places, the court becomes
abusive, deceptive, and lecherous.
There are moments in the play, such as a
riveting monologue delivered by Louie,
when one doesn't know whether to laugh
or cringe as these characters expose them-

selves for what they truly are. The effect
is powerful, unsettling, and certainly refreshing to see on the Swarthmore stage.
Ivona will be perfomed in the Frear Ensemble Theatre on Friday at 8, Saturday
at 6:30 and 10 p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m.
Seating is limited; call xB2oofor reservations.

Henstridge get
naked? The answer is, sadly, not until the
very end. Fortunately, though, Species II
is sufficiently entertaining to keep even the
most hard-to-please junior high schooler
occupied for at least an hour and a half.
Species, you'll recall, is the not-so-classic 1995 Aliens/Predator/Debbie Does
Dallas hybrid starring Henstridge as Sil, a
hideous alien creature disguised as a bigbreasted chick who goes around hooking
up with guys and then ripping their guts
out. Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Forest Whitaker, and Alfred Molina are on the
team who must stop Sil before it's too late.
The movie (directed by Roger Donaldson)
is gloriously lurid high camp, precisely
because it takes itself so seriously.
Species II opens with a manned mission
to Mars, during which hero Patrick Ross
(Justin Lazard) and two other astronauts
are mysteriously infected with something.
Having seen the first film, I had a sneaking suspicion that this same something
would make them run around, get laid, and
rip people's guts out. I was right.
Michael Madsen, scientist Marg
Helgenberger, and Henstridge are the only
cast holdovers, from Species. Here,
Henstridge is a lab recreation of the first
Sil who is being used as a guinea pig to
test ways that humankind might combat the
aliens if they ever make another appearance. Perennial Hard-ass favorite George
Dzundza makes an appearance as a general assigned to stop the alien invasion, and
James Cromwell pops up as a tough-talking senator.
Sadly, Species II lacks the would-be epic
preposterousness of the first film. Peter
Medak, best known for small, great British movies like Let Him Have It and The
Krays, tries his best to infuse at least some
sort of life into this turkey. The result is
oddly tongue-in-cheek; most of the time I
was laughing because it was obvious the
filmmakers found the material as funny as
I did.
Some of the special effects are incompetent, some are really gory, others are barely
visible. The alien sex sequence at the end
of the movie is particularly murky, and
filled with the bizarre underwater alien
shots from the first movie.
Still, Species II is more than able to
briefly fill everyone's adolescent desire for
sex and blood. On that basis, I highly
recommend it. If you can't appreciate that,
why go to the movies?

This week, instead of suggesting restaurants where you
can escape from Sharpies' food, we offer tips on how to
improve your Sharpies experience. These suggestions are
both our own and have been shared with us by other innovative Sharpies diners.
For a country goodness take on breakfast, try bringing
a cheap hand-held orange squeezer and making your own
juice from Sharpies' plentiful supply of oranges. This
makes a refreshing addition to Sharpies' already stellar
juice inventory. For a more filling alternative, instead of
settling for the egg beater processed egg product, ask the
person behind the grill for a real egg omelette, or have
scrambled or fried eggs instead. Also try making cinnamon toast; just put butter, cinnamon and sugar from the
ever-useful condiment bar on a piece of bread of your
choice. Don't be afraid to send your meal through the
toaster twice; one trip through only heats bread, it doesn't
toast it.
At lunch and dinner, sandwiches make a great alterna-

tive, and the possibilities for both bread and fillings are
endless. Choose from white or wheat pita, the various bagel types, or the impressive selection of sliced bread by the
toasters for starters, then move onto fillings. Try apples,
swiss or cheddar cheese and honey, or spinach, sliced hardboiled egg, feta and honey mustard, all especially tasty on
bagels. Another nice sandwich is microwaved spinach, to-

mato and feta in a toasted pita. To make a quesedilla, mi-

crowave cheddar or jack cheese with salsa on pita bread.
Don't be afraid to experiment with ingredients; set aside
one evening and devote it entirely to playing around with
combinations until you find a couple tasty enough to make
again. Sure, you'll hit on a couple really disgusting sandwiches, but you justmight create a little piece of heaven as

well. Try different sauces too, like honey mustard or a
simple mix of oreganoand olive oil, on veggie sandwiches
with fillings like cheese, tomatoes, spinach and sprouts.
For carnivores, try microwaving some roast beef with dftofc 2
dar. And on taco bar nights, take some cheddar to the grill
and try a "Santa Fe burger" with cheddar and guacamole.
There's all kinds of variables to adjust for creating creative sandwiches, everything from bread and filling to
sauce to method of cooking. Just grilling your dinnej in
stead of microwaving it might make all the differenc2;B&-?>
tween same-old, same-old and magically delicious. •';
In addition to these sandwiches, you might try one of
the following sides: to enjoy fresher broccoli or spinach,
microwave those limp vegetables from the salad bar in a
bowl one-third filled with water for 2 minutes. Decant the
water and spice broccoli with red pepper flakes or melt
some cheddar cheese over it. When baked potatoes are
offered, go all out; everything on the salad or condiment
bars are fair game. Who knows, thousand island dressing
may be just what your sesame seed and bacon bits potato
really needed. Feel free to do interesting things with rice
as well, and experiment with different sauces for those
yummy french fries.
For drinks, mix and match. There's a reason all the dispensers are so close together, just slide your glass between
juices and go for the fruit salad effect. While we don't;
recommend mixing any of the citrus selections with your!
skim milk, some sodas are surprisingly good combined
with one or more of the juices; flavor sprite with a touch
of Fanta grape drink to make grape soda! Don't overlook
the seltzer, either (flip the leverunder the sprite dispenser).
Seltzer with any juice (even your fresh squeezed 0.j.!)
makes for a refreshing break from the standard. After your
meal (or during, we're not your momma), add some ice
cream to your hot chocolate for a creamier beverage or
mix ice cream into a glass of milk for a milkshake. Students have also reported great success with the cappucinir
machines and ice cream, although not so much with the •
orange frozen yogurt. If you're still having trouble getting !
the ice cream out of the containers, just nonchalantly ihch '.
the ice cream cartons over nearer the grill. And obviously,
making good use of the marshmallows usually provided
by the side of the cappucino machine will increase your
beverage enjoyment many times over. It's mainly a matter of being open to change; just be aware ofall the choices
and all the ways they could conceivably be fit together.
If you tire of putting together these meals on your own,
know that Linda McDougal really is receptive to recipe
suggestions. Seth sent in a recipe for black bean stew and
a week later we found it in the veggie bar (the stew, not
the recipe). Finally, e-mail us (sbudickl, rmcgreel) with
any more Sharpies innovations and we'll publish them next
time.Thanks to Eric Falke, Elena Rosenbaum and Fatimah
Johnson for their suggestions.

AdviceCorner
Dear Pardus,
I have been under some emotional stress recently and I
am beginning to have some academic problems. I know
I'm having these problems because I'm not doing my work
to the best of my abilities, partly because I do too much
dorm socializing and partly because I spend too much time
with my boyfriend. I live in a quad in Mertz and my boyfriend lives on the same hall two rooms away. I think that
because we (the quad) often have food available, we get
lots of visitors; especially at night. We talk with them sometimes till very late.
This is the pijpblem: I have my computer in my room, so
I don't see the point in going out to use a public Mac and
stay in to do all my work; but my roommates seem to be
doing fine with their work, even though they always partake in our long night discussions and date as well. I tried
to put my foot down a few weeks ago by pasting a sign
after 12 p.m. which said "Go away. Busy." Even though it
did cut down some of the visitors, the boyfriends of my.
quad members had no real regard for it. Surprisingly, any
boyfriend has been avoiding me for the last few days. When
I confronted him about it he said he was busy. Do you
think he is peeved at me? I am beginning to think he onjyvisited me because of the food. What should I do?
; •;
Anonymous

My Dear Lady,
Much as I do not support the attitude of your Romeo, I
thinkyou are having a little communication problem with
this guy. First of all, you shouldhave made your academic
situation known to him; but granted that you wanted to'
keep your pride, you should have at least told him about
this action before actually executing it. Who knows: he
could have come up with some wonderful suggestions.
His attitude change though, I must admit, is rather unjustified (pardon me guys) because you did explain your reason for wanting your peace.
Here is my suggestion: talk things out with your quad
members and tell them your preference of studying in the
room, for the obvious convenience of the computer, and
set down a few guidelines and/or rules. You might be surprised to find that you're not the only one needing study
time. Then ask your friends to invite their boyfriends to
dinner one evening, and ask one of them who is friendly
with your boyfriend to bring him along without his knowing that you will be there. When he does show up at the
meal make sure you sit close to him, and use all your feminine guile to introduce the topic of study time into the
general discussion (of course your friends must be in the
know). I'm sure in the company of others he would let his
defense down enough for you to be able to get to him, and
with the aid of your friends you would have him back.
Then let him know of your academic situation. Trust: that
is whatrelationships are built on. I'm sorry for being philosophical, but this is one subject I get emotional about.
All the best,
Pardus

Track
Squashes
Hopkins
Women Trash Blue Jays
77-46, Men win 69-66
By Ambrose Dieringer
Last Saturday the men's and women's
track teams both claimed victory over
Johns Hopkins in their final home meet of
the season. The men eked out a hard fought
69-66 over the surprisingly strong Hopkins
squad. The Blue Jays were crushed by a
tsunami of Garnet Tide when the Swat
women came crashing down on them 7746.
The men were led in scoring by Steve
Jaspal Singh
"Air" Dawson 'OO, who celebrated his 20th
birthday by winning the high jump, triple
jump, and long jump. Captain Mason
Tootell '99 charged his way to victory like

The Swarthmore baseball team continues to
drop games in an inconsistent manner when
the defense and pitching break down in the final innings or the offense never awakens. They
dropped two over the weekend to Dickinson
College 15-3 and 4-1. In a Monday make-up
game versus Franklin and Marshall, they fell
17-10. The game against Muhlenberg was a
close game put the late inning collapse of the
pitching led to a 13-10 loss.
In the first game of the doubleheader against
the Dickinson Red Devils, the Garnet was hurt
by the running game of the opposing team.
Also, Josh Roth '99 was not on top ofhis game
nor was he helped by the narrow strike zone of
the umpire. The Red Devils lead off almost
every inning with a walk, stole second, advanced on an error or a hard hit, and came
around to score.
Later in the game, the defense came together
especially at the hot corner where Carlo Fitti
'OO nicely handled groundouts. Catcher Josh
Lindsey 'Ol also improved his blocking. However, the Garnet could not string hits together
and were unable to hit the ball out of the infield. In the meantime, Dickinson built a lofty
lead capped off by a 2-run homer.
The second game was all about pitching.
Steve Farneth 'OO pitched for the Garnet as he
allowed 4 runs over 7 innings. In the first four
innings, he kept his pitches down and foiled
the opposing batters as he fanned 5, striking
out the side in the 4th inning. In the sth,
Farneth ran into trouble but got out of the inning allowing only one run. He was helped by
a great defensive play by Roth playing first
base and catcher Lindsey. Roth caught the ball
in foul territory and made a strong throw to
Lindsey to cut down the runner attempting to
score on the play. Lindsey made the tag and
held on as the runner pushed into him to com-

2 count. Later, Brian Lopez 'OO drove in another run with a sac fly. Down by three runs,
Roth relieved Farneth in the 7th inning.
Quickly, Muhlenberg scored a run but it was

Softball Strikes Out with One
Win and Three Losses
By

Jean Quinn

The softball team handily defeated Franklin and

Marshall in

;

their opener last Saturday by a score of
11-4,.but lost the second which started a three game
losing skid for the Garnet, 6-18 overall, 2-10 in the
Centennial Conference.
Several players stepped up their offense in the
Garnet's 14 hit route of the Diplomats. Heather
Marandola 'Ol was 3 for 4 with a run scored, and
lean Quinn '99 was two for four, with a 3 RBI double
in the first inning, and a run scored.
In the second game, the Tide fell 3-6. Michelle
Walsh '9B was perfect from the plate, with 4 hits
including a triple and a double. Mary Beth Alvarez
'9B was 3 for 4, and Quinn was 2 for 3 with a double.
Dana Lehman '9B, who recorded her sixth victory
with the win, commented, "In the first game, we
were .aggressive and forced F&M to make mistakes.
We lost some of that intensity in the second game
and jt hurt us."
Coach Cheri Goetcheus added, "We went out solid
and took charge from the start of the first game and
handled them rather easily. I think we relaxed a bit
too much between games and took the second game
for granted."
Although the Bears have won the conference title
for the past three years, Ursinus' team was much
*eaker than in recent contests and Swat missed their
opportunity to jump on them, losing 1-2 in nine innings, and 3-5 in the nightcap. Lehman gave up only

5 hits in nine innings. Alvarez knocked Hess in to
take the early lead, but Ursinus tied it up after a ball
was caught and carried over the dead ball line which
led to the advancement of all runners on base. Although Walsh tripled to start off the bottom of the
ninth, the Garnet were unable to push her across in
their last effort.
In the second game, the bats were not there for the
Garnet. Downey and Quinn were each 1 for 3 with
an RBI. "Both games were good softball," said
Goetcheus. "It pretty much came down to executing the basics and bringing in runners in scoring position. We left several runners on second base and
third base in both games that could have won the
games for u5.... Lurah Hess laid down some great
bunts for the hit. Kate Fama 'Ol had a strong outing
in the second game, and Lehman did a nice job in
relief for that one."
The team has a heavy schedule in their remaining
weeks of the season with several games left to play.
Lehman commented, "We played well against
Ursinus but we didn't play up to our potential.... We
have lost too many 1 and 2 run games, we need to
put it all together in this final stretch. There is no
reason for us not to win 7 or 8 of the last 10."
The Garnet are home Saturday at noon for a
doubleheader against Lehman College, and will
make up a rained-out match against Cabrini Sunday
at 1 p.m. Seniors Alvarez, Lehman, and Walsh will
play their final home games Tuesday vs. Albright
at 4 p.m. and Thursday vs. Widener at 4 p.m.

Bryn Mawr Crushes
Women Ruggers in
Upset Match, 15-5
By Amber Halsey, Danielle
Thomas and Rhiana Swartz
This weekend, the Swarthmore
Women's Rugby team played
against Bryn Mawr's Horned Toads
and lost badly. They attribute this
loss to an unfortunate combination
of arrogance and lack of mental
focus. The score of the first game
was 15-5. The B-side outshone the
A-side squad, losing to Bryn
Mawr's A-side by a score of 10-5.
Even the spectators noted later that
"it was a hard game to watch" so
you can only
imagine how
hard it was to
play!
The only redeemable moment of the first game was the try
scored by back captain Courtney
Clark '9B who managed to dive into
the try zone off a pass from Meghan
Brennan 'OO. Despite the fact that
an asthma-afflicted Toad "took a
minute" at every scrum to suck
some life from her miracle inhaler,
the forwards were surprisingly
winded from chasing the Bryn
Mawr kicks. The Swat front row,
consisting of Rhiana Swartz 'OO,
Amber Halsey '9B and Cori
Garrett-Goodyear '99 battled a diverse and tough Bryn Mawr front
row for possession ofthe ball; while
often Swat was successful in winning the scrums, the ball somehow
managed to get tied up in the transition from scrum half to fly half.

been her last collegiate rugby game,

First Conference Win Kicks Off
Rollercoaster Week for Men's Lax
Garnet Stickmen Take Down Dickinson 12-4,
Rocked by Washington 29-1
By Patrick Donaghy
The men's lacrosse team had an
up and down week, recording their
biggest win of the season followed
by its biggest loss. After pummeling Dickinson 12-4, Swat lost to
national power Washington 29-1,
bringing its record to 3-9 on the

season.
After spotting Dickinson two
early goals, the Tide came roaring
back. Mark Dingfield 'Ol started
off the scoring after beating his man
from behind. One minute later,
classmate Mike Lloyd scored the
first of his four goals on the afternoon to tie the game at 2. Toby
Patterson 'OO continued the run by
picking up a loose ball in front and
finding the back of the net to take
the lead, and Swarthmore dominated the rest of the way. Goalies
Sig Rydquist 'OO, Pat Murray 'Ol
and Vasya Destinov 'Ol combined
to record 10 saves.
"The win was a total team effort.
Our guys played the way I knew
they could. Everyone contributed,
and it shows just how far the team
has come," said coach Pat Gress,
celebrating the Garnet's first conference win of the season.

Matt Halpern '9B and C.J. Riley
'Ol scored their first goals of the
season in the second half. Adam
Dickinson 'OO, Steve Shin '9B and
Marcus Shin 'OO also netted goals
for theTide. Tucker Zengerle' 00
spearheaded a defense that shut out
Dickinson in the second half. Alex
DeShields '9B, in addition to his
excellent defense, earned a spot on
the conferencehonor roll for dominating faceoffs and groundballs.
Following the Saturday victory,
Swat took on a Washington team
looking to impress pollsters for a
shot at the NCAA playoffs. The
Shoremen showed why they
reached the national finals the past
two years by taking an 18-0 halftime lead, then coasting the rest of
the way. Swat's lone goal came
from Steve Shin, who was assisted
by Lloyd.
The Tide travel to Gettysburg tomorrow to play the Bullets, who
defeated Washington last week,
before playing Widener next
Wednesday. Mark Dingfield (247-31) and Mike Llyod (18-10-28)
continue to rank in the top ten in
conference scoring. Goalie Sig
Rydquist 'OO ranks third in the conference in save percentage (58%).

The men's rugby team dropped a match to the
Second City Men's Club on Saturday, evening
theirrecord at 2-2 on the season. Swarthmore's
youth and vigor were no match for Second City's
knowledge and experience, as the final score of
32-12 reflected.
After blowing out Bucknell in their season
opener, the next week the Evil Buzzards fell to
the University of Pennsylvania 27-22 in a devastating loss when Penn scored a try with less
than five minutes left to come from behind and
edge Swarthmore in an absurdly wet, muddy,
and cold game.
Swarthmore rebounded the next week, squeaking by Widener 15-14 on a try by Mike Sheer
'99 late in the game. After a game last weekend
got canceled due to league ineptitude, LaSalle
canceled last weekend because of Easter and
Swarthmore was forced to find an emergency
match. Second City was kind enough to volunteer their B-side and host Swarthmore in Bryn
Mawr. Second City, with an average age ofabout
30, collectively had dozens of years more experience than Swarthmore.
Despite this, the Buzzards came out strong,
exploiting their speed in the back line. After a
phenomenal back line early in the game, Tony
Sturm '99 broke through the defense and pitched

The B-side squad played remarkably well in comparison; during
this game, Alan Matas, the
Women's Rugby coach, remarked
"the B-side team shows great promise for the future of the team next
year." Emily Wilkins 'Ol had the
play of the game after scoring on a
beautiful breakaway, running at
least 25 yards to the tryzone. Kara

Vaughan and Noelle Goodin 'OO
started at two new positions, inside
and outside center, and showed
promise at these posts. Erica

This week, the Halsey-SwartzThomas "dirt-face" award goes to
Charity Miller, because she bit it for
no good reason. This weekend,
Swat plans to play in their second
and final tournament at West
Chester. It is important to note that
Swarthmore is the defending champion from this tournament last year;
the team expects to avenge their
previous loss against Bryn Mawr by
strutting their stuff yet again.

"It was a hard
game to watch."
