environment could
increase risk for partner abuse

|Y DEIRDRE CONNER
It always seems to start small: a "litle" fight, five fingerprint bruises barely
wticeable under a long-sleeved shirt.
3ut intimate partner violence and the
jattern of coercive behaviors that surcan quickly escalate, jeopound it
irdizing the safety of one or both parties
n a relationship.
Most research indicates that an estinated one in five relationships are trouiled by abuse. A Centers for Disease
Control summary reported that the
iverage prevalence rate for nonsexual
lating violence is 22 percent among
nale and female high school students
ind 32 percent among college students.
\nd, according to Assistant Dean and
JenderEducation Adviser Karen Henry,
it exists at Swarthmore as it exists
verywhere." Concerns about a wide
ange of intimate partner abuse come to
lenry either because a student is conerned about another student, or, more
arely, because a student calls with a
iroblem. She estimates that she deals
nth about one case of non-sexual intinate partner abuse per year, but she
eels certain that the problem is undereported as sexual misconduct. And
ome factors here may even increase the
isk.
"It's a very serious issue, and the acalemic intensity of Swat can cause real
iroblems," Andy Wong 'O2 said. Wong
'an a domestic violence awareness cam)aign last spring.
Linda Echols, director of Worth
lealth Center, pointed out that college is
ingtime when most people are still leanihow to make and maintain intimate
elationships. Women in their high
chool years to their mid-20s are nearly
tiree times as vulnerable to an attack by
husband, boyfriend or former partner
s those in other age groups, a Justice
Apartment study showed.

Director of Psychological Services
David Ramirez agreed that students are
often inexperienced in how to deal with
relationship issues. "What they could be
doing to help a situation escalate, how to
learn to read a situation, how to walk
away from a situation is often something
people don't know how to do," he said.
In fact, Ramirez said, an experience
of violence or abuse "can often be terrifying for both parties."
Statistically speaking, the majority of
domestic violence is committed by men
against women. But "often it's both partners fighting," said Echols, and the
prevalence of abuse extends to same-sex
relationships as well.
How well reported intimate partner
abuse is at Swarthmore is difficult to
gauge. The small size of the student body
means that abuse may be more obvious
to others, especially hallmates.
"Usually, if there's an assault, the
person or someone who's with the person will call, or a hallmate if there's
screaming in the dorm," Pat Laurenzi, a
public safety officer, said. He said public

has responded to "about three or
four" incidents of intimate partner violence over the past few years.
But this lack of privacy may also lead
victims to avoid reporting the abuse and
seeking help. "It's not something that
people can be candid about," Wong said.
"Our school is so small. That kind of
news would easily spread." Often, Wong
said, the shame people in abusive relationships feel comes from how far the
situation has escalated. "What happens
is that violence becomes part of the relationship, it becomes normalized At first
it's just a shove or grab of the arm, but,
by the time it gets really bad, it becomes
shameful."
Henry also feels that the small
community often presents concerns for
safety

of seven open positions on Student Council,
including the two co-presidential seats, all but
one are uncontested. In the past, "none of the
above" has sometimes received more votes in
the case of an unopposed election, causing
Student Council as a whole to appoint a person of its choosing to the position. In most
such situations, however, it is candidates who
are victorious.

Lauren Tobias 'O2, who was elected co-president at the end of last semester, resigned from
her position. Because of this, two co-presidents must be elected, one to fill the remainder ofTobias's term and one to serve until the
end of the fall semester in 2002.
Tobias said she had resigned for personal

reasons.
"When I ran for the position," she said, "I
did it because I thought that it was important
to have one co-president be someone who had

After mechanical failure, college unplugged for several hours
■YBENJAMIN

KABAK

A mechanical problem at a Philadelphia Electric
substation resulted in a campus power outage
iat lasted for approximately a hour and a half yesterday

fternoon.

"The power outage was caused by substation mechanial problems in Media," PECO spokesman Gary Brown
aid. "The surrounding Media-Springfield areas were
fected by this outage,"
Around 80 minutes after the lights went out, power
-turned to the area. "All the customers in the area had

At the time of the outage, campus officials were unsure
'the specific details.
"We heard that the areas affected by this outage were a

could be restored. Ham explained that the campus operates on a three-phase power system.
When partial power was restored, only one phase was
receiving power. According to Hain, had the school elected
to allow this power to flow, only around 50 watts out of 110
would be available to systems requiring power. This would
have forced systems such as computers to overcompensate
for the lack of energy, overloading themselves.
Ten minutes later, a broadcast phone message
described the situation to students, explaining that PECO
hoped to have the power turned back on last night. The

message also contained information from Registrar
Martin Warner. Since the deadline for pre-enrollment was
4 p.m.. shortly after the outage, Warner announced that
pre-enrollment would extend until noon today.
In the end, power returned to the campus before it

became completely dark. However, facilities had begun
preparing for a night without power. "The dining hall,
along with the computer center and telephone network, is
completely 100 percent backed up," Hain said.
"We're also lucky it's so warm outside, because, with
the power off, we are unable to send steam through the
heating system. However, we had to think about the issue
of emergency lighting in the bathrooms."

Overall, students were only slightly inconvenienced by

the power outage. For many, the biggest concern was completing pre-enrollment before the deadline. Due to the
extension, that is no longer a problem.
A few had to deal with the down side of computer use.
Sarah Goldberg 'O5 was in the middle of writing an eightpage history paper when the power blew. She ended up losing two of the five pages she had already written. "When the
power went out, I wondered if I would be able to finish the

paper," she said.
"I tried to remember what were the last things I had written so I wouldn't lose too much."
Some students, who gathered for the duration in
Sharpies, the only building with full power, were not thrilled
when the lights went back on across campus. "I was hoping
that the power would stay out longer into the night," said
one student, who, for obvious reasons, wished to remain
anonymous.
"Then my professor wouldn't have been able to collect
this 10-page history paper that is due tomorrow."

Photographer, conservationist discusses migratory birds
study and photograph: "I have the best job in the world,"

BY BETH REDDEN
Photographer and author Scott Weidensaul has never
ceased to be amazed by "the astonishing things that birds
do." Having spent much of his career traversing the
Western Hemisphere, photographing and researching
migratory birds in preparation for his recent book,
"Living on the Wind: Across the Hemisphere With
Migratory Birds," Weidensaul has had ample opportunity
to observe the various mechanisms through which migratory birds complete their annual journeys. Yet what
Weidensaul said he found most surprising during the
course of his travels was the degree to which people were
connected to these birds: "People from all over," he said,
are "united under the idea that a world without migratory
birds is too dull to think about."
Such fascination with the world of migratory birds
drew Weidensaul to lecture throughout the country and
ultimately brought him to Swarthmore on Wednesday,
Nov. 14. Speaking to a crowd of about 140 students, faculty
and community members, Weidensaul sought to share his
knowledge and passion for the various migratory bird
species inhabiting the Western Hemisphere through an
explanation of various birds and their migratory patterns,

and the conservation issues crucial for the survival of
these birds.
Weidensaul's slide show presentation was filled with
large color photographs accompanied by a running narration of facts and anecdotes relating to each picture presented. Beginning with a description of the Arctic Churn,
which Weidensaul said travels 22,000 to 25,000 miles every
year and spends more time in daylight than any other bird,
Weidensaul continued to highlight a sampling of the many
migratory birds he has observed and photographed
throughout his career. He spoke of the Northern hawk owl,
a bird whose migratory patterns are so irregular that birders came from as far away as Arizona when one was sighted in the Poconos last year. Redknots, Weidensaul said,
travel the equivalent of "here to the moon and back again"
during the course of their lifetimes, while "hummingbirds
have surprising little fear of humans."
Throughout his explanation of the diverse patterns
associated with each bird species, Weidensaul consistently
interjected with a statement that captures the passion he
has for the birds he has devoted his time and efforts to

he said.
After discussing the migratory habits of specific bird
species, Weidensaul went on to focus on conservation
issues. He began by cautioning that the destruction of
migratory bird habitats cannot only be blamed on the environmental policies of developing countries. It is also, he
said, directly related to the destruction of forest in the
United States. Weidensaul explained that the continuing
destruction of large U.S. forests exposes migratory birds to
predators like raccoons and housecats that ordinarily
avoid thickly forested areas.

"People from all over are united
under the idea that a world without migratory birds is too dull to
think about."
Scott Weidensaul
Emily Mollenkopf Phoenix Staff

Aside from habitat destruction, Weidensaul explained
that global warming will be "the single greatest challenge
these birds will face in the next 10 years." The possibility for
global climate change could, he explained, disturb delicate
migration patterns, leaving these birds in serious danger.
Biology professor Timothy Williams, whose department
cosponsored the lecture along with the Society of Sigma Xi,
said he was extremely impressed with Weidensaul's lecture. "I was very pleased," Williams said. "It was standing
room only. I don't think we could have gotten more people
to come."
Williams credits much of the success of the lecture to
Jen Johnson 'O5, who audited his animal behavior class
this semester. Williams explained that Johnson has
worked with Weidensaul in the past and that her initiative
was a large part of the reason Weidensaul visited
Swarthmore.
Johnson said that for the past three years she has
worked with Weidensaul on a project to band Northern
saw-whet owls. She said she became interested in this
project after attending a presentation on the subject and

"jumped right into it." When she learned that Williams's
animal behavior class would be completing a unit on bird
migration, Johnson suggested the idea of bringing
Weidensaul in for a lecture.
She is reluctant to take too much of the credit for
Weidensaul's visit, however, explaining that biology professors Tim and Janet Williams 'are sort of giants in the
[ornithology] field." As a result of the Williams's well
known expertise in ornithology, Johnson said she thought
Weidensaul "was very honored to come." Regardless of his
reasons for visiting the college, both Johnson and
Williams agreed that Weidensaul's lecture was successful.
Weidensaul ended his presentation with a call for
future action. As migratory birds continue to face habitat
destruction and a future clouded by the possibility of global climate change, Weidensaul explained that people must
accept the responsibility to protect these birds. "Now it's
up to us," he said. "It's up to us to reach across the borders
and boundaries that these birds aren't even aware of."

As federal depository, McCabe selects government documents for public access
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER
Federal depository libraries, of
which McCabe is one, attracted
national media attention last
month when the government
requested that a U.S. Geological
Survey CD-ROM be destroyed.
However,
college
librarians
report that suspicions of political
motivations behind this request
may not be correct.
"Generally, the reason they're

asking us to remove a document
is because it's not correct or wasn't meant to be distributed in the
first place," Social Sciences

Librarian Megan Adams said.
As a selective federal depository library, McCabe receives and
houses documents that certain
government agencies publish and
the Government Printing Office
distributes. "We don't pay, but we
have to play by their rules,"
explained

These rules include providing
open access to the general public,
housing documents for at least
five years and only discarding
them according to the approval of
the state librarian.
McCabe chooses to receive
"about 35-37 percent of what's
available, including print and
electronic resources," Magagnosc
said. It did not receive the CD in
question.

She said McCabe tries to
"select the material that best
serves the curriculum, the classes
offered, faculty research and the
needs of the surrounding community," she said.
This time, the CD-ROM recall
"wasn't an issue for us," she said.
Although requests to remove
documents are "not uncommon,"
this

upset

some librarians. "In this case,
there was no explanation for why
we were to destroy it," Magagnosc
said. "The timing was such as to
catch peoples' attention."
"Some librarians archive
things that the government says
to get rid of," librarian Megan
Adams said. "I won't use the word
'vigilante librarian,' because
that's not exactly it."
"Lots of people are holding on
to this particular CD, seeing if the
government will retract the
destroy notice."
The CD contained "a survey of
government data on reservoirs
and dams," according to The Los

Angeles Times.
An increasing number of the
documents McCabe would receive
in print form are now available
only on the Internet, taking control of access out of librarians'
hands. Web content is frequently
changed, and government Web
sites were overhauled after the
change from the Clinton to the
Bush administration. The move

THE PHOENIX

toward electronic documents,
mandated by Congress for financial savings, is "something librarians are upset about," according
to Adams.
"With electronic documents,
[availability] can be much more

political."

Librarians are proud of
McCabe's status as a depository
library. It was designated as such
in 1923.
"To be able to know what the
government is doing is fundamental to democracy," Adams said.
"We can hold governments
accountable by looking at what
they publish."
However, the decision of what
documents are released lies solely
with the government. "There is a
real tension between free information and security," Magagnosc

said.
"There's an awful lot of stuff
that shows up that surprises me
has
that

released," Adams said. "I'm really
glad that I'm not the person who
has to draw that line."
Considering the extent of government publication, the removal
rate seems reasonable.
"In the twelve or thirteen
years I've worked here, we've
received tens of thousands of documents, and I've had to destroy
four," Magagnosc said.
The most notorious removal,

SBC asks WSRN for accountability
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
The people who control the turntables and those in charge
of the purse strings are not seeing eye to eye. The Student
Budget Committee manages money allotted to student groups.
The executive board of WSRN, Swarthmore's radio station,
knows that. But the two decision-making bodies are not in

agreement on budgetary matters.

SBC has complained numerous times to WSRN's leaderabout a lack of communication concerning budgetary
matters between SBC and the radio station's board. Over the
past few weeks, SBC has requested that WSRN reorganize the
way it reports its monetary needs.
To maintain the station's equipment, SBC employs an engineer, Anteneh Tesfaye 'O3, who is supposed to establish a
maintenance schedule in order to ensure that the station
receives adequate funding to maintain existing equipment
and to purchase new materials. "We have someone hired just
to make sure everything coordinates out well," Student
Budget Treasurer Marvin Barron 'O2 said. "However, this
position is clearly not working out." Tesfaye was not available
ship

The WSRN transmitter broadcasts to the college and the
rest of the world. Communication between the station and
the Student Budget Committee, however, has been strained.

comment at press time.
According to Barron, the engineer has not been reporting
to SBC. Due to this frustrating lack of communication, Barron
and the SBC are looking into ways to improve communicafor

tions between WSRN and SBC.
"The current structure is not supporting institutional
money going toward a solid foundation. I'm just not getting
this information," he said. "We want to make sure capital is
well taken care of. The committee will have to feel more comfortable with how WSRN is structured in order to allow for
bigger budgeting in the future."
Mike Spiegel 'O3, director of the folk music department for
the station, understood SBC's point of view. According to
Spiegel, at different points in the year, different members of
the WSRN board report to the budget committee. "It's frustrating for the budget committee to communicate with five
individuals at different times then with one person at a set
time every certain number of weeks," he said.
Now WSRN faces the task of devising a proposal that would
provide a better solution to the current situation. "The SBC
asked us to come up with a proposal that would match their
desires. During the first stage, we need to establish the board's
opinion," Jack Borrebach 'O2, the station's general manager,
said. "Then we'll figure out what, if anything, will change."
The station's unofficial slogan is "Fiercely independent
college radio." According to its mission statement, this means
that WSRN and the board of directors try to program music on
the air that is not readily available on mainstream radio stations. Both the WSRN management and the SBC believe that
the most important aspect to maintain is the station's individuality. However, both groups realize this will take a lot of
careful negotiating.
"We have to answer the question of how to improve relations with WSRN without impinging on the fierce individuality of their programming," Barron said. "We believe that WSRN
has this unique position, and in order to maintain it, they are
best suited to develop a new method of communication."
"This is more about streamlining communication,"
Borrebach said. "This is not about the music. It won't in any
way affect what WSRN is providing to the student body."
Not all board members completely agree with the
motives behind SBC's requests. "I don't think they have
very strong complaints," Jason Skonieczny 'O2, the station's
jazz director, said. "I think a greater awareness of the SBC
on the board's part is the majority of what is required to
improve the situation."
One proposal by the SBC has already raised this issue.
According to Spiegel, SBC wants a closer relationship with
the manager of the station. "They've suggested that if the current board of directors agrees, the manager of WSRN could be
hired as an employee of the SBC," he said. "The board did not
feel comfortable with this idea. On the whole, we expressed
our concern that the station's dynamic would change if the
manager were an SBC employee."
In the end, though, Spiegel and the rest of the board realize
that this was just one possible suggestion. The directors stress
that they are still in deliberations about how to proceed. Over
the next few weeks, WSRN and its board of directors will be
debating numerous proposals.
"The SBC doesn't care how 'SRN runs itself as long as the
equipment is workable and students are having fun," Spiegel
said. "They are concerned about money leaking out of the system, and they have told us their frustration. No one is upset
with anybody, but the important thing is that we develop
stronger ties to the budget committee."

College fundraising

Capital campaign
still raising money
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Despite what the college saw as a necessary
cancellation of the campaign launch event in late
September and an ensuing $lOO,OOO financial setback, Swarthmore's capital campaign will conin
tinue
with the same fundraising goals
the form of a series of regional events, staff said.
"We are not going to restage [the campaign
launch] event on campus, but we have gone
ahead publicly with the campaign," Director of
News and Information Tom Krattenmaker said,
referring to the fundraising affair that would
have brought 300 to 350 guests to Swarthmore for
a gala dinner, promotional video and multimedia
alumni presentation around the theme "The
Meaning of Swarthmore."
So far, alumni reaction has shown support for
the college's decision to cancel the kickoff event.
In addition, Krattenmaker said, "the Board of
Managers was completely behind the decision,
although they regretted the squandered efforts."
Donations have not declined since the Sept. 11
attacks, despite the lagging economy and the war
in Afghanistan. The college has raised $102.5 million "as of this moment," said Dan West, college
vice president for alumni, development and public relations. Since Swarthmore had intended to
raise $lOO million by now, "we're pretty much on
schedule," he said. "We're continuing to get
pledges every day."
In canceling the kickoff event, which would
have required the completion of the temporary
structure whose base had already been erected
on Parrish beach, the college lost $lOO,OOO. The
total cost of the event, including labor, equipment and the contract to build the structure, was
$140,000, Krattenmaker said, but the college
could recoup $40,000 of it after the decision to

cancel.

The initial reaction of college fundraising
staff after the Sept. 11 attacks was to stress that
the event had been "postponed, but not canceled," as Director of Development John
Malcolm told The Phoenix on Sept. 13. The college has since decided, however, that "because of
what happened and because the country is at
war, it was not time for a celebrating event,"

according to Krattenmaker.
Malcolm said the fundraising staff "hopes
that what we gained in terms of a respect for
decision-making at the college and an awareness
of the gravity of world events balanced" the cost
of canceling the event.
The regional events that the college intends to
work as a springboard for raising the targeted
amount of money began about three weeks ago
with a "largely informational" gathering at the
home of a Swarthmore graduate in Washington,
D.C., where attendants viewed the promotional
video "The Meaning of Swarthmore," listened to

Panel stresses complexity of Afghan problems and peoples
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
Through a series of historical
facts, personal opinions and
vignettes, participants in last
"Afghanistan:
week's panel,
Faith, Tribe and Conflict at Asia's
Crossroads," emphasized the
complexity of Afghanistan's current situation.
Each of the four panelists
focused on a different aspect of
the country's situation, but all
warned against the dangers of
attempting to correct it with an
oversimplified solution.
Wendy Batson, who has
worked on development, reconstruction and refugee projects in
Afghanistan, and who is currently director of humanitarian
affairs at the Vietnam Veterans of
America, discussed the politics
and historical underpinnings that
have led to the current situation,
which she described as "an
absolutely stunning example of a
complex emergency."
According to Batson and a fact
sheet provided by the Swarthmore
Progressive Action Coalition,
Afghanistan has a heritage that
dates back more than 5,000 years.
The country was first consolidated as a state when Ahmad Shah
Abduil established control over
the Pashtun majority ethnic
group in 1747. After unsuccessful
British and Russian attempts to
subdue the Pashtuns in the early
part of the twentieth century,
those countries arbitrarily split
the
present-day
land into
Afghanistan and Pakistan. This
split has been a constant source of
conflict in the region.
Power continually changed
hands, and no group could garner
enough power to establish a
strong government. By 1978, an
Afghan communist party had

assumed control. Power struggles
and Cold War politics undertaken
by the United States and Russia
further complicated the situation.
The American government provided weapons and funds to the
Islamic fundamentalist movement in an attempt to oust the
communist leaders from power.
The Soviets countered with an
invasion of the country, and the
United States responded by
increasing monetary and military assistance.
Faced with extensive losses,
the Soviets withdrew ten years
later. Their retreat was followed
by an escalation of already existing civil conflict, and leadership
passed through a series of warlords. The Taliban gained control
in 1994 and proceeded to attempt to
unite the country under an ultraorthodox version of Sunni Islam.

"You can't build a
nation overnight."
Robert Breen
The next speaker, Sarah
Warren, who lived in both
Pakistan and Afghanistan and
who currently serves as a program development officer for the
Vietnam Veterans of America,
explained that the Taliban enjoys
varied popularity across the
country because it has been largely successful in its ability to bring
at least some semblance of stability to the war-torn country.
Like the Afghan population,
Warren said, "the Taliban is not a
homogenous group of people" but
"a variety of people." She went on
to describe interactions with two
Taliban officials: one who stormed

out of a presentation because of
her presence in the room and
another who sang her a love song

on a long car ride to Kabul.
"The Taliban were not all good
and not all bad," Warren said.
Robert Breen, who is currently
serving on a special assignment
to the United Nations Interagency
Working Group on Afghanistan,
discussed the current United
Nations strategy in dealing with
the country, a strategy that he
said has recently been complicated by the largely unexpected fall
of the Taliban from power.
According to Breen, the primary problem is that "there has
never been a state or nation in
Afghanistan," and thus, though
United Nations policy will also

involve extended humanitarian

aid, the long-term mission will be
one of nation-building. He pointed
out,
that
however,
"in
Afghanistan, this is no easy task."
The place to start, Breen said,
will be with humanitarian activity, which he said is beginning to
resume since United Nations officials were pulled out of the country on Nov. 12. "Clearly, this is the
place to begin." Breen said. "You
can't build a nation overnight."
Once programs have formed to
feed, clothe and educate the
Afghan people, the focus will turn
to creating a governmental infrastructure in the country, which
will need to include not only the
establishment of an accepted
authority with good domestic and
international relations but also
the creation of a financial system,
which the country currently lacks.
Breen stressed, however, that
in order to be successful in its
attempts to create a stable government in Afghanistan, the international community needs to be
careful that it advises and pro-

vides support while letting the
Afghan people solve their problems on their own. It is also important that foreign powers do not
leave the country to itself once an

immediate solution has

been

reached. Failure to complete the
peace and resolve underlying conflicts may result in similar, if not
worse, future problems , he said.

The final panelist, Robert
Eaton, who is president of the
Survey Action Center and has
dealt extensively with issues of
development in the Afghan countryside, stressed that, in order to
understand Afghanistan, the
international community must
look beyond the capital city.
"Kabul is not the important
thing for the peace and prosperity
of the country," Eaton said. "For
the Afghani [sic] people, it is the

countryside."
Eaton said that people in the
countryside, which is home to an
overwhelming majority of the
population, are largely tradition-

al and tribal and would be unwilling to accept Western values or
icons, such as McDonalds or
Coca-Cola.

Thus, though it may be tempting to "correct," Eaton stressed
that a lasting solution would not
result from this approach. "We
can't look at Afghanistan in our
own light and want them to look
like us," Eaton said. Instead, in
forging a solution, Eaton said the
international community should
respect
Afghan culture and
Like Breen, Eaton
beliefs.
stressed that "we should be there
to encourage, but we're not going
to be able to dictate."

Former college president dies at 96
John W. Nason, former president of Swarthmore
and Carleton Colleges, died on Nov. 17 at Crosslands,
a Quaker life care community in Kennett Square, Pa.
He was 96 years Did.
A vibrant leader in education and an advocate for
reason and idealism up to his death, Nason is perhaps best known for his work on behalf of JapaneseAmerican students during World War 11. He served
for three years as Chairman of the National
Japanese American Student Relocation Council,
which extracted more than 4,000 interned students
from the War Relocation Authority's camps and
found places for them in 600 colleges and universities away from the West Coast, including
Swarthmore.
"John was an extraordinary individual who, as
president of the college, profoundly shaped its mission and its quality," President Al Bloom said. "He
has been a constant source of inspiration, wisdom
and personal support and a powerful advocate for
academic rigor, inclusion and humanity."
After teaching philosophy at Swarthmore during
the 19305, Nason was appointed president in 1940 at
the age of 35. In addition to guiding Swarthmore during the difficult years of World War II and the rapid
expansion of higher education in the late 1940s and
early 50s, he served on the committee that managed
the program for conscientious objectors to the war.

Nason said he considered his work on behalf of

Japanese-American students his most important

and

satisfying.

THE PHOENIX

After 13 years as president of Swarthmore,
Nason resigned to become President of the Foreign
Policy Association, which worked under his leadership to resist McCarthyism. Under Nason's leadership, World Affairs Councils were established in
large cities and the "Great Decisions" discussions
programs, which now involve several hundred
thousand participants each year, were initiated. He

later returned to Carleton, his alma mater, and

served as its fifth president for eight years beginning in 1962.
Nason was born in St. Paul, Minn, in 1905. He
attended Phillips Exeter Academy and graduated
summa cum laude from Carleton. After a year at
Yale, he transferred to Harvard, where he received a
master's degree. As a Rhodes Scholar from
Minnesota, he spent three years at Oxford's Oriel
College. He received honorary doctorate degrees

from the University of Pennsylvania, Swarthmore,
Carleton, the College of Wooster, St. Olaf, Hamilton,
Muhlenberg, Hahnemann Medical College and
Johns Hopkins. Swarthmore awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws in 1953, with a citation that
recognized him as "one who preserved the best traditions of our College during a world war, and who
has brought to it new unity, strength and recognition."
After retiring in 1970 to his home in the
Adirondacks, Nason became actively concerned
with the environment and conservation. He became
a trustee of the Adriondack Nature Conservancy in

1977 and subsequently helped to found and direct the New York State
Conservancy.
Two memorial services will take place in honor of Nason. The first
will be held on Saturday, Dec. 8 at 2:30 p.m. in the Friends Meeting
House and the second on Sunday, Dec. 9 at 2 p.m. at Crosslands. All are

'Orphan' sophomores and returning
juniors look for housing solutions
BY MATTHEW FITTING
Ben Masten 'O4 understands why it has to be
this way. But that doesn't mean he has to like it.
Masten, like many other sophomores and juniors with roommates leaving campus next semester, usually labeled "orphans," will, instead of living alone, be placed with another, different roommate in the spring.
A housing crunch caused mainly by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 is the reason. Assistant Dean
of Residential Life Myrt Westphal said 15 sophomores would be overseas this spring in contrast
with the usual 30, and a similar fall-off occurred in
the junior class.
The reason, she said, was an "unsettled world-

view," according to the foreign study office.
"I don't expect any empty beds next term,"
Westphal said, including beds in the rooms of
would-be orphans. "I'm expecting all those rooms
to fill."
The crunch has left Masten, who lives in
Roberts, and many others in flux: not knowing
who they'll be living with next semester; not
even knowing, in the case of several juniors
returning from study abroad, where they'll be
living.
"Nobody's very happy with this situation," said
Masten, who added he'd prefer to keep his present
room as a single. But "I think tfaat... because of the
paucity of the rooms, a lot of people are going to
wind up with people they would not ideally live
with anyway.
"I have not been super-thrilled about what's
going to happen," he added. But he also sympathized with Westphal. "There's not very much she
can do," he said. "She's between a rock and a hard
place."

Catherine Clark 'O4 turned out to be an example
of what Westphal considers ideal: a would-be
orphan who volunteered to move from her present
room in Willets into a Wharton quad with three
friends who, like Clark, have a roommate going
abroad next semester.
Sam Dingman 'O4, who lives in Wharton and
has a roommate who will be studying in
Australia next semester, got lucky also. He will
be able to remain in his room in the spring, sharing it with a sophomore who is on leave this
semester.
He emphasized that Swatties should appreciate
their always-available housing. "This place is all
about going abroad, and it's great that they offer
housing all four years," he said. "It's great to know
that you at least have a home when you come

back."
Clark said she feels for people in less ideal situations, especially juniors coming back from abroad

who will be forced into Strath Haven, where there
are no singles. But, she added, "There's nothing the

college can do about it."
The situation, Westphal said, could be even

worse.

If not for certain students (seniors graduating at
the end of this semester, students voluntarily taking leave and others who will be asked to leave),
the college would still be short about 30 beds, even
after using Strath Haven.
Westphal described the people who fall into one
of those categories as "crucial," calling the phenomena "melt," a pattern the housing office always
counts on when rooms become limited.
Fortunately, said Westphal, next semester's difficulties seem "like a one-time thing," and a similar crunch isn't likely to occur for some time, if

ever.

Villanova professor Saleem Kidwai discusses turmoil in Kashmir.

Former Kashmir resident
describes freedom movement
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
Kashmir, a disputed territory in southern Asia, has long been an
area of great interest. Few remember a peaceful, safe Kashmir, as Dr.
Saleem Kidwai does. "It used to be a very peaceful place
more peaceful than other parts of India," Kidwai said while addressing a small
...

audience in the Scheuer Room last Tuesday.
Kidwai, now a visiting Fulbright scholar at Villanova University,
lived in Kashmir for thirty years and taught political science at the
University of Kashmir. He is a faculty member of the Jawaharal
Nehru University in Delhi, India. In his talk, entitled "Kashmir,
Pakistan and Afghanistan," Kidwai recounted events that he
believed contributed to the present political turmoil and terrorism in

those three regions.
While not a native Kashmiri, Kidwai monitored the sentiments and
actions of his students and other Kashmiris. "I found life very peacethis continued for quite some
ful, but people were not quite happy

time," Kidwai said, after explaining the growing tensions in Kashmir
m the late twentieth century. He explained that corruption, unemployment and the breakdown of the government led to this unhappiness.
This discontent led the population to become increasingly militant.
The freedom movement began in 1959, financed by Pakistan. "There
was a euphoria in the valley. Everyone believed that independence was
around the corner," Kidwai said. The sentiment was so strong that 200
pro-independence militant groups formed and competed with each
other; many of them identified themselves as pro-Pakistan. Childrei
religious schools that Pakistan organized were taught to "fight
Islam and defend Kashmir."
Many felt that the political war had turned into a religious war.
Kidwai refuted this belief.
"Islam does not preach violence," he said. Throughout this
ordeal. Kidwai has felt that Islam has been presented in a negal

light.

Closing these training Camps and religious schools is the first step
to solving tnis problem, he said, and the United States snould force
Pakistan to take these actions. He believes that, given the present

this.

Uninspiring
elections
Another round of Student Council elections are coming to Swarthmore, but the
hottest issue in this election is whether "none
of the above" will beat any of the more, well,
mortal candidates. With only eight people
running for the seven open positions, it is
easy for students to feel, once again, disillusioned with the ever-changing body that is
Student Council.

Last year, there was low voter turnout, and
it seems this year's elections will be no different, given the dearth of competition.
Indeed, one might wonder why The
Phoenix even bothered to write a news article
about an election whose results were hardly
in doubt. We felt it was time to go beyond
printing platforms and results and shed light
on this semester's candidates and their platforms.
Ryan Budish 'O4, campus life representative, told The Phoenix that "the real thing
that Student Council has to do is to win back
the trust of the students." Budish's goal is

"I don't feel that people on
council right now feel
strongly about anything."
Liane Rice 'O3
noble. Unfortunately, a virtually uncontested
election makes a mockery of a body that
should be making the connection between students and the institution of the college.
But the fault for the lack of candidates
does not fall entirely on the shoulders of the
council. The relationship between the council
and the student body is two-sided, and it is
the student body's responsibility to pay attention to elections if they want a student government that advocates for their vision of

Swarthmore.
Indeed, there are times when it appears

that the candidates do not pay much attention
to their own platforms.
Sometimes SC members run out of ideas
before their terms expire. Student Council,
Liane Rice, appointments chair and co-presidential candidate, said, "I don't feel that people on council right now feel strongly about
anything."
Unless current SC members demonstrate
to the students
including potential candidates that being on SC has value, student
interest in the organization will only
decrease.

Candidates for the council should have
ideas about what they want to do once elected, and they should research these ideas to
see whether they are feasible.
In some cases, students run successful
campaigns on platforms that guarantee the
impossible.

The student body must not allow these

sorts of campaigns.
It is the responsibility of the student body
to take an interest in Student Council elec-

tions and ensure that the candidates have reasoned, practical platforms. It is the responsibility of the council to take up issues of
enough concern to the student body that the
next time around, they might feel compelled
to run.
The student body should pay more attention to the Student Council, ensuring more
qualified candidates with better ideas for
their positions.

LETTERS

Strath Haven was home sweet hell
Dear Editor:
I lived in Strath Haven for one semester
my sophomore year, so I have good authority to comment on last week's article
"Housing crunch to send juniors to Strath
Haven." My roommate and I referred to
where we lived as "Strath Hell," or sarcas-

tically, "the Haven."
We only survived the Haven by entertaining each other and keeping our senses of humor. But the rest was miserable.
Getting online requires a dial-up connection and unplugging your single phone
line. It is completely isolated in every
way. When trying to make my early Latin
class, the shuttle would mockingly drive
by without stopping; most days the shuttle didn't pass by at all. Unwilling to risk
the cold, long walk, my roommate and I
would often stay in the Haven for two or
three days at a time. No meals, no classes,
no contact with the outside world, no
sense of time, no desire to do anything. It
was very draining. I had one visitor all
year, although I think she really just got
lost on her way to the mall.
Cable television does not exist at the
Haven.
Much like Dry Land in
"Waterworld," it is just a myth. Free
laundry just means that you don't need
quarters; though I'd gladly trade the $2O I
saved if I could have those four months of
my life back. The doubles are not big. We

had no kitchen. I never got a key to ML
for breakfast or computer usage. Free
parking is worthless if you have no car,
and I had to lock my bike a mile away in
the basement.
The college defines its housing philosophy as “based on the belief that residence hall living enhances education by

contributing to an individual’s academic, social and personal growth/’ Exiling
students to Strath Haven completely
ignores that. Yes, at a big state school a
15-minute walk would be nothing, but
that is a false comparison. Much of
Swarthmore social life depends on hanging out on the hall, walking to the
library and studying at Kohlberg. The

Haven ruins that. I had my worst semester, socially and academically, while living in Strath Haven. I don't blame my
shortcomings on where I lived, but living in the Haven did not make things
better. I joke now, but I am pretty sure
that it made things a lot worse.
The college should be ashamed of
itself for making students live in Strath
Haven. To whoever is truly in charge,
sending students to Strath Haven should
be unacceptable. Maybe the classes
shouldn't be so large to avoid a housing
crunch. Maybe we should finally build
that new dorm. Just please, don't make
any more students live in Strath Haven.

Money and drug laws
Law's implications on financial aid warrant close scrutiny
BY MATT RUBIN
In the last three weeks, The Phoenix has
examined three financial aid issues that are
central to students' lives.
However, despite this information, students
have done nothing to press the administration
about the controversial policies it has recently
admitted or about the vague, unsatisfactory
answers it has provided, particularly in regards
to whether or not the college will compensate
students for loans they lose due to drug-related
offenses.
On Nov. 1, The Phoenix reported on the college's stance regarding the Higher Education
Act of 1998, which has only recently begun to
be rigorously enforced by the Bush administration.
The act, in one of its many provisions,
denies federal grants, work-study money and
student loans to students who have been convicted of drug-related offenses.

For an initial drug possession offense, students lose eligibility for these privileges for one
year following conviction, while a second
offense results in two years of ineligibility. A
third offense bars aid indefinitely, and punishments for those who traffic drugs are even
steeper.

According to Students for Sensible Drug
Policy (ssdp.org), strict enforcement of the act
will result in a loss of aid for approximately
34,000 students nationwide. Despite this number, the Nov. 1 Phoenix article on financial aid

Talbot, director of financial aid
for Swarthmore, saying that "the school has not
yet faced a problem regarding the issue." The
article summarized Talbot's statement; "In
other words, the financial aid office has not
encountered any applicants whom they believe
have had drug convictions."
I wonder, however, how the school would
know if it did have
such
an applicant,
since the Swarthmore
quoted Laura

and

Common

Applications ask only

whether a student has
been convicted of a
crime.
questions,
These
though they ask for an
explanation,

do

not

though from Talbot's vague comments, it is
hard to tell.
Because this situation, according to Talbot
has not yet arisen, Swarthmore, to paraphrase
Talbot, "has not developed a concrete policy on

the issue."
Talbot "would not guarantee" that students
who lost federal funds due to drug convictions
would have their loans replaced; instead, she
danced around the issue, citing how unlikely
the school was to receive such an application
and dismissing the amount of money lost as
"very small."
Why Talbot believes that it is her job to dismiss the "small" amount of money that students
can lose as irrelevant is beyond me; to those
who get the aid, I'm sure it doesn't seem that
irrelevant.
With 34,000 students losing aid this year, it
hardly takes a leap of faith to say that one stu
dent with a drug conviction might apply dur
ing the next three years of the Bush
Administration, especially considering that in
1999, according to drugwarfacts.org, more than
half of high school graduates had tried illegal
drugs and found marijuana "fairly easy" or
"very easy" to obtain.
Even if one of these students applied
though, the college, for reasons stated, migh
never know, just as it will never know how
many students have been deterred from apply
ing for fear of not getting the aid and thus wasting money on an application which, for them
may itself be a financial burden.
The people who certainly will not know
however, are the students, who, despite false
promises made by President Bloom in the
wake of the football controversy, have
received no increased input in the admissions

process.
This issue of applicants with drug convictions is only one of a host of admissions issues
that, as I said when I

began this piece, are
directly affecting stu-

More than half of high
school graduates had tried

___

necessitate a detailed
description of a student's precise crime. And, with this law now
being enforced for the first year, students who
before could have gotten away with not answering the questions on the FAFSA about drug convictions will now be forced to do so.
Thus, prior to this year, students could have
had convictions but simply ignored them and
mostly likely they would not have been punished.
Furthermore, Talbot ignores the students who, on
account of their conviction, will be discouraged
from applying to a school that will not adequately
compensate them for the loans they lose.
Swarthmore is seemingly such a school,

dents' lives.
Comparably
important are the
school's policy on

admisneed-blind
sions for international students and the
school's
decision
whether to release the
names of international students to the FBI as it searches out the
roots of terrorism. On both of these matters, the
school, in characteristic fashion, is highly
unclear.
Students have a right to challenge this
shroud and demand more definitive, concrete
answers to pertinent problems; whatever you
believe the school's stance on an issue is, you
certainly have a right to know what it is.
Otherwise, when these policies do become
applicable to a visible situation, students will
once again be confused, surprised, and, depending on your perspective, cheated.

LETTER

College should review facilities
Dear Editor:
While I found your article about reviewing
accessibility ("Council and deans plan to size
up disabilities services," Nov. 8) is encouraging, I am concerned about the manner in which
it is being approached.
I have some experience with these issues
(having served as a chairman for Access
Wilmington; a committee that addresses these
issues for the city government in Wilmington).
I assure you that a group of people without
training in this rather complicated area will

not be able to do an adequate evaluation.
Having been back to campus numerous
times over the years I can assure you there are
innumerable problems that continue to be present, in the form of both physical barriers and
features demeaning to those with disabilities.
I strongly encourage Swarthmore to seek
the services of someone with training and experience in this field. Who knows, they also may
very well provide the college with ideas on how
to correct the problems in a money saving way!

fresh batch will arrive.
A group called Adbusters has jump-started the merriment, getting the
anti-consumerism bandwagon rolling before our credit cards are even out of
our wallets. They designated the day after Thanksgiving, usually the busiest
shopping day of the year, to be International Buy Nothing Day, an event
which "challenges consumer culture by asking us to switch offfrom shopping
for a day."

Approach it from the right perspective, and
time spent with a shiny new PlayStation 2 can
be a refreshing break from the storm and
struggle of everyday life.
Personally, I think that materialism is getting a bad rap. It might not be
the most noble or high-minded pursuit that mankind has ever come up with, *
but it has much to recommend it. As we enter what "The Simpsons" once
referred to as "The Christmas-Hannu-kwanza Spend-phase," I think it's high

timefor a defense of materialism.
What I like most about consumer culture is that it's really quite democratic, in that it's continually trying to figure out and meet the needs of the
people. If there's a product that I want, no matter how strange or impractical
it may be, odds are that it's available for purchase somewhere. The market
doesn't worry about the virtue of my actions or whether or not my desires are
healthy
it just supplies me with the things that I ask for, usually at a reasonable price. I consider this to be a considerable improvement over previous modes of civilization, under which a great many men and women dediof their felcated themselves to the moral betterment i.e., subjugation
lows.
People are always complaining about how big companies manipulate consumers like puppets, but I think that they've got the power relationship
backward. Firms wouldn't spend millions and millions of dollars on market
research every year if the customers were just a bunch of hapless dupes.
Although we might not always like the choices that the masses make, I think
it would be very hard to prove that corporations force men and women to like
things against their will. The bottom line is that if a company can't succeed
in convincing me that they've got a worthwhile product, they've got no way
to force me or anyone else into buying it. Until the day that Best Buy acquires
a mercenary army, orbital mind-control lasers, or both, corporate America
must bend to my whims. I like that.
Another under-appreciated aspect of materialism is its effect as a unifying
cultural force. There was a great example of this in the Nov. 12 New York
Times. The day that Kabul fell, one denizen of that much-beleagured city dug
up a television and VCR that he had hidden in his backyard and watched
"Titanic." Thanks to Hollywood and the magic of consumer electronics, the
cultural values of people all over the world are beginning to converge. Maybe
it's true that big-budget movies and cheap television sets aren't the ideal
basis for the brotherhood of nations, but after thousands of years of intense
ethnic and religious strife, I say anything that breaks down cultural barriers
is a step in the right direction.
Speaking of Afghanistan, we need to think about what the leading alternatives are before we condemn materialism. Community, family, religious
faith and tradition are fine concepts, but let's be honest with ourselves: they
all tend to backfire disastrously. An old-fashioned holiday without any
whirring, expensive, material distractions sounds great until you realize how
many arguments, annoyances and out-and-out fistfights would inevitably
ensue. A civilization built entirely around the values I mentioned above?
Well, we've seen how well those tend to work out.
The genius of materialism is that it gives us an escape route from the frequently aggravating world of human interaction. Inanimate objects might
not be able to shower us with love, but they are also incapable of getting
angry or holding grudges. If you approach it from the right perspective, time
spent with a shiny new Play Station 2 can be a refreshing break from the
storm and struggle of everyday life. You probably don't want to spend your

whole life in the company of soulless machines, but it's certainly nice to have

the option available when you need it.
So to all of those grousers who yearn for improbable Hallmark
Christmases, bah humbug! And the same goes to all the anti-capitalists who
think that prosperity must equal moral decay! Bah humbug to the lot of you.
While you wear yourselves ragged in the war against pleasure, I'll be basking in the warmth of my beloved material goods.

Pot crackdown
England's only pot cafe, the Dutch Experience, is modeled after similar establishments that have been
Amsterdam's main claim to fame, making it a veritable
mecca for weed enthusiasts worldwide. With one important
exception: the British rendition isn't legal. In fact, even
medicinal marijuana use is illegal in England. Despite this
fact, the cops have been pretty lax about the whole thing,
rationalizing their low-key, permissive response with comments on the lack of disruption caused by the cafe's
patrons.
Last week, however, the police barged in without warning, issuing citations to the customers and cuffing the man
in power. The catalyst for their sudden change of attitude:

criticism.

The British police did not shut down the pub. The establishment's originator opened it with the intent to cater only
to the faction of society that was dependent upon marijuana for the alleviation ofmedical afflictions, because the use
of marijuana itself was somehow causing a problem.
If anything, the pub was stimulating the economy

through a pseudo-legitimate market and making a whole lot
of miserable people a little less pessimistic about their daily
lives.
When questioned, the police even conceded that they'd
actually experienced many fewer difficulties related to high
Dutch Experience patrons than they generaUy experienced
with the intoxicated frequenters of regular, legal pubs. This
only makes sense: people are ordinarily less likely to
become belligerently out of control when they're high than
when they're drunk. During the months of police inaction,
the cafe established a regular clientele and became a wellknown, comfortable retreat for the physically and psychologically ailing as well as a safe site for experimental
endeavors.
The British authorities only yanked the rug out from
under the Dutch Experience's feet, because their command
was questioned, because they were called to their lawful

task.

Never mind that it doesn't make intuitive sense. Never
mind that the cafe's existence or its business had yet to
cause a problem. It's illicit drug use. And it's illegal. And
any tolerance exhibited by the British police would have
been a poor reflection on England as a nation. We don't
endorse that sort of scandalous behavior; get in there and
shut that disaster down. And the British police did as they
were told. And, in so doing, they inadvertently raised the

important, long-debated question over the possible legalization of marijuana, and the ensuing consequences thereof.
This debate, really, is pointless. It's entirely void of substance, utterly single-sided and, therefore, dreadfully uninteresting. Marijuana should most definitely be legalized for

both medicinal and recreational use.
Smoking weed does a lot less damage than engaging in
activities that are currently legal. For instance, drinking
heavily trashes your liver and smoking tobacco leads
directly to shriveled, cancer-infested lungs. At least when
pot is done to excess the result is really only a much more
passive, if less coherent and less agile in the short-term
memory department, version of the untainted individual.
The world, in my humble opinion, could use a few more
just to keep things at a comfortable equilibriburnouts
...

um.

Marijuana isn't exactly addictive, certainly not in the
way many other legal substances are: how about a 12-step
program for my caffeine addiction, so I could make it
through the day without plunging into twitching,
migrained withdrawals if I fail to meet my six cups of coffee quota? I don't see anyone storming into Starbucks and

handing out tickets to all those addicts calmly nursing their
habits over muffins and biscotti. The only difference at the
Dutch Experience is that a bong, not a mug, is the tableware
of choice and the addicts aren't even really addicts.
As evidenced by our own nation's annual rainbow-gatherers, marijuana use can be a truly beautiful, unifying
thing. Given the current global circumstances and the
widespread turmoil, bloodshed and blatant hatred, nations
everywhere should be leaping at the chance to integrate a
little bliss-inducing dope, not frantically stomping out any
indication of approval just to save a little national face.

Arctic drilling not necessary
Dear Editor:

Perhaps Republicans are unfairly accused of exploiting the war on terrorism. But declaring that Arctic
drilling is vital to the world position of the United States
(as David Ellis 'O2 did in his Nov. 8 column) is a position
based on a slanted half-knowledge of facts about the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. As far as anyone who

Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries takes
advantage of us. More oil would be saved if every
American inflated his or her car tires than even the most
optimistic estimates say we might extract from the
Refuge. According to the U.S. Geologic Survey, the mean
estimate of oil that could be recovered from the refuge
would amount to less than a six-month supply for the
United States. It would take at least 10
years of exploration, construction and
drilling to get it into the market.
To say that this land is remote is
public true. The refuge is the last contiguous
area in North America home to the full
spectrum of arctic life.
It is one of the most important
onshore polar bear denning areas on
the continent, and is home to musk
oxen, grizzly bears, dall sheep, a myriad
of migratory birds, wolves, red and arctic foxes, wolverines, voles, lemmings and squirrels.
Each year, 129,000 porcupine caribou migrate 400 miles to
breed in the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain, serving as the
focus of native Gwichi'in culture.
I agree that the United States must become more
energy independent. But it is not only our own nation's
natural resources that are limited. Shortages and eventually the end of a natural oil supply are inevitable. We
must invest in alternative energy sources so that they
are cheap and efficient by the time we are in desperate
need of energy, if not because it is more humanitarian
and ecologically sound to do so.

owned by the federal government
implies that the United States government is the feudal overlord of our nation which owns
public lands as a individual might have owned a castle in
the Middle Ages. As an American I understand public
land to mean land that is a national commons, collectively owned by the people. It is protected by national legislation for the benefit of environmental integrity and is a
symbol and haven for Americans. Essentially, each
American owns 16 square feet of the refuge. This is the
reason the government sponsors a public comment period when making decisions about our public land, and is
required to tabulate them and take them into consideration. It is a common misconception that opening the
refuge will alleviate potential scrounging when the

'Humble' left-wingers offer no answers
Dear Editor:
Dann Naseemullah 'O2 ("U.S.
must grieve for others") has asked
America to learn humility in the

wake of the World Trade Center
attack. Happily, the left-wing has
chimed in with exemplary displays
of humility since Sept. 11, to help us
follow in this righteous path.
Naseemullah, for his part, has
used his last four articles to call twice
for an end to arrogance, once for a
return to values and once for both an
end to arrogance and avoiding the
bombing of innocent civilians. Ever
humble, Naseemullah never suggests
a concrete response to the most terrible terrorist attack in world history.
To do so, no doubt, wouldbe arrogant.
Meanwhile, Sam Blair 'O2 ("The
dignity of life, but for whom?") is
practically saintly in his willingness
to question the wisdom of America's

actions and motives, but in a letter in
which every paragraph ends with a
question, he unfortunately seems to

offer America no options beyond a
saint's martyrdom.
Finally, we have Celia Paris 'O5
("War fuels one-sided patriotism"),

demanding "a search for alternatives." Letting her pride escape for a
moment when she explains that,
"Vocal public dissent," represented,
of course, by the peace movement,
"is a patriotic act." She then humbly
maintains her certainty that "War is
not the answer" while stating neither the question nor the correct
answer. Better, no doubt, to let students make their own moral and

political inquiries than to be so
patronizing as to actually suggest an
alternative.
outside
of
Happily, people
Swarthmore have equal opportunity

to learn from the mentors of humility. Katha Pollitt, a prominent writer
for "The Nation," admitted during a
debate on NPR more than a month
after the World Trade Center attack
that, "I don't have any answers, I
don't have any answers, and I am
honest about that." Then, speaking
to her opponent in the debate, she
taught him a lesson in humility:
"You know, your answer may not be

the right answer."

Were I not reading the left-wing
press, I would not realize that to criticize without normative purpose is
humble. I might arrogantly think
that to propose alternatives and solutions is a valid response to a crisis.
Thankfully, the humble writers on
the left, who know better than 90 percent of this country, are there to
explain to us our mistake.

Dear Editor:
Thank you for the (Nov. 15) article "Rabble rousers," by
Ivan Boothe. As a former co-president of the Swarthmore
Warders of Imaginative Literature, I found it most interesting to see how SWIL is currently
perceived on campus.
I take some issue, however, with
the well-meaning editorial "Swat and

SWIL, which is, after all, simply a
group of students. I can only speak
from my experience, which at ten

Semester

I've enjoyed working with Student Council over the
past year as the Appointments Chair and I'd like to
stay on Council for one more semester as a CoPresident.
Running and improving Appointments took up
most of my SC time, but I was also very involved in big
and small SC issues, from starting the safety whistle
program to doing that new Lost & Found board by the
mailroom.
Currently, SC has started work on getting a Septa
discount or finding some other way to make traveling
to Philly cheaper - I would like to continue that work
next semester. I can't promise to make long-term goals
like greater transparency in financial aid and admissions policies happen in a semester.
However, having led several campus groups and
chaired committees, I can help SC members to create
the structure they need to address these long-term
goals. Having a plan in mind will help SC to stay energized through the end of each semester. I know how to
get things done because I have SC experience, I know
our committees very well, and I also know our clubs.
Besides working on SC, I have past experience as the
president of the Feminist Majority, an editor of Small

and many other activities.

Student Life Representative

The President's role is to advance students' interests by running Council, introducing policies, and serving as a representative of student concerns to the administration and the Ville.
As a member of Student Budget Committee, the Dean's
Advisory Council, and Orientation Committee, I understand
the administration. As the only student who is also an elected
official in the Borough, I have a unique relationship with leaders and citizens of the community. I also have many ideas to
revitalize council by addressing immediate and tangible issues:
Student pressure on the administration: Students ignore
many issues that are highly relevant to their lives. Restrictive
financial aid policy towards students with drug-related convictions and privacy violations of international students, for
example, need addressing.
Better speakers. Swarthmore is a world-renowned institution and deserves speakers of the same caliber. In addition to
approving proposals, Forum for Free Speech should also solicit
well-known speakers, and, having recently helped orchestrate
Rep. John Lewis' (D-GA) visit, I can help.
Professor feedback. At Amherst, students evaluate professors using a standardized form. We could use similar forms
either to inform faculty of their performance or to compile a
book for students that discusses each professor's strengths and
weaknesses

I am very much looking forward to the upcoming year here at Swarthmore and hope that many

like to see an expansion of both Tarble's and
Sharpies' eating hours. I know from experience
that making Sharpies' dinner hours during a
sports season can be difficult to manage if not
impossible and the sports season is one of those
times when you are burning the most calories and
most want a buffet.
I also want to work on a number of larger and
smaller projects, ranging from increased campus
security to the little additions we can make to
add to a cleaner, healthier environment. I don't
know how many times I have come back to my
dorm only to find the doors propped open—an
unsafe situation with our campus' propensity to
have off-campus visitors. Having campus keys
that open all dorms is a must—without it our
rooms are in constant jeopardy even without our
knowledge.
Even simple additions to the campus such as
hand dryers are important issues to address;
every little thing we do to contribute to the environment adds up with time.

CHIRAG CHOTALIA 'O4
Appointments Chair

My name is Chirag Chotalia and I'm running for Appointments Chair. The
Appointments Chair is responsible for publicizing student council committee openings,
and forming a group ofcouncil members to read applications, interview candidates and
make final decisions. It's undoubtedly a difficult task. This appointment season, approximately 16 applicants applied for 4 spots on a particular committee.
How will this decision be made? If elected, I propose the following— a clarification of
appointments procedures and policy and the work of each committee. A clarified process
of appointments will increase the accessibililty of the system, will create further interest during application season. Additionally, I propose that student council compile
information about every committee that will be made available in public places during
the appointment season—lets be serious, do we really know what a committee does based

on its name alone.
So when you make the difficult decision during this election week, remember Indian

process by which they were made. My goal, above all, is
to remain receptive to student viewpoints.

MARIELENA YELEZ 'O4

Campus Relations Representative
Until recently I had no idea who student council was or what they did. This is a serious problem that I hope to improve as Campus Relations Representative. As such I
would mediate the exchange of ideas between the general student body and student
council. I hope to make the student council more accessible to all students here at
Swat. We need to know what kinds of changes are being made that will affect us all
socially and academically.
Events of the past year have uncovered a need for the average student, one who may
be concerned about what's going on but is not necessarily involved in a committee, to
be made aware of how Student Council and the school administration work. What
issues are they grappling with? What decisions are they making? This is the kind of
information that I have never heard and want to make known to the campus at large.
As suggested by my elections to the leadership board of The Iglesia Evangelica
Bautista Youth Society, I am highly organized and well versed in creating compromise.
Since I don't have any specific agenda which I want to present to student council, I will
be able to respond to concerns that you, the student body, need addressed.

You don't exist in a void, and neither does

a student still drunk from Thursday night revelries has fallen off a bike onto
one
the railroad tracks skirting Swarthmore College's campus, bringing both Springfield
police and public safety officers to the SEPTA bridge overlooking the tracks. The officers'
cars squeeze the already-narrow one-lane bridge further, making it impassable to a tractor-trailer.
The late trailer, due in earlier this morning from Feeser's, Inc., a food distribution
company based out of Harrisburg, Pa., contains enough dry and frozen foods to stock
Sharpies' shelves and freezers for the weekend. Fresh fruit and vegetables from
Gallagher's Produce of New Jersey have already been delivered to the dining hall this
morning, and a smaller Wawa Dairy truck slipped around the traffic barrels and police
cruisers on the bridge a few minutes ago.
Once deliveries from Philadelphia's Esposito's Meats and W.C. Ryan Co. bring fresh
meat and poultry later this morning, Sharpies will be stocked for its next eight meals
lunch on Friday, Nov. 16, through breakfast on Monday, Nov. 19. Back in the kitchen, the
first shift of cooks is already preparing Friday's lunch and dinner. But for the time being,
Hopson and her counterpart Scott Tutton, Sharpies' back-of-house manager, are stuggling to get the day off to a smooth start.
The late delivery from Feeser's is only one of their worries today. The industrialstrength dishwasher that keeps the dining hall awash in clean plates, trays and silverware broke down last night during dinner and still hasn't been fixed. One of the three
cooks on the morning shift is out for the day. And, perhaps worst of all, one of the two
pot washers quit today.
Tutton is coping

tough enough," Tutton says, "but all four is especially difficult."
As it turns out, of course, Sharpies will handle the day in stride. The delivery will
arrive, the dishwasher will run, the cooks and the pot washer will cover. And most everyone will be none the wiser. For, as Hopson points out, few students or faculty know what
goes into the food here.

more culinary skill is required to balance the flavors of the dish.

world like overburdened ants returning from successful foraging. The
the serving area and the
ribbons descend underground into the nest
kitchen. There they are fed, and around 1:15 p.m., the ribbons snake
back out.
Inside the anthill, the kitchen and its denizens never stop moving.
The whole affair is organized according to an internal logic which is
never seen by the ribbons but is always understood by the kitchen.
Janet Kassab and Jamar Jones are the keepers of the logic. Kassab
is the gregarious director of purchasing, Jones the wisecracking
receiver. Together they ensure that there’s enough food to prepare the
day’s menu and that it’s all easily accessible to the cooks.
When the delivery from Feeser’s finally arrives around 9 a.m.,
Jones jumps into action. Two pallets stacked high with boxes of frozen
chicken wings, french fries and other food must be moved into the
freezer. It’s a deceptively complex task. With eight meals to be prepared
during the days ahead, the boxes must be arranged so that cooks can
get to them easily when they need them. It’s part of the thoroughly
thought-out organization that structures the kitchen. The food follows
storage in the back, prep in the middle, and service
a progression
out front
and Jones makes sure the first step doesn’t go awry.
Jones dons a navy blue sweatshirt embroidered with his nickname,
“Da Rock,” and a pair of heavy gloves to venture into the freezer. It’s
cold below 0°F, or -18°C. He leaves the door open to let the freezer
warm up a little before he starts moving the boxes. “It’s so cold, you’d
freeze solid before you got two steps in,” he says. As he waits, he scans
the weekend menu, then begins stacking and rearranging. The freezer’s small, and there’s not a place for everything, but when he finishes,
everything is in its place.

THE VIRTUES OF BEING SMALL

Because

Sharpies is self-operated rather than run by an outside
contractor such as Morrison’s, the company that operated
Sharpies before the college decided to go “self-op” 10 years ago,
Kassab has the freedom and flexibility to purchase however she sees

fit. And for her, that means small.
“Sharpies is very small, and we work with small people,” Kassab
says in an earlier interview. “We’re better served being important to a
small company. Contractors are bound by profit and married to certain
suppliers. We have a far greater ability to serve good food.”
Kassab keeps the orders relatively small the dining hall doesn’t
have that much room to store food and maintains only a $20,000 inventory
and the relationships with suppliers are personal. With the
exception of Feeser’s, which supplies dry and frozen foods and with
whom Kassab deals through a seven-school consortium, including
Bryn Mawr and Haverford, Sharpies’ suppliers deliver five days a
week. A few are even willing to deliver on weekends, if necessary.

THE PHOENIX

Being self-operated, Kassab isn’t locked in to particular purchasing
patterns. “I pay attention to the bottom line,” she says. “But we’re not
compelled to keep food costs low. I’m grateful that we’re not pressured
to buy soybean anything.”
The small approach also allows the dining hall to be far more experimental than most institutional kitchens, says Sharpies head catering
chef Lisa Scolaro. “The ingredients here are very seasonal,” Scolaro
says. “We have suppliers telling us what’s available every day. We even
have orchard-delivered fruit.” Scolaro, a vegan, cites the dining hall’s
increased use of seitan, purchased from National Whole Foods from
Neshaminy, Pa., in vegetarian dishes as a case in which flexibility in
purchasing has resulted in better food and more options for students.
Scolaro has worked at both larger institutions like University of
Delaware, where a contractor runs the food service system, and at
gourmet restaurants like Philadelphia’s jPasion!, where she was sous
chef. She has also opened five restaurants. The quality of the ingredients that go into the meals at Sharpies stacks up favorably with those
places, she says, especially given that institutional food service is a
“whole different animal” than restaurant food service. “It’s a pain to
bring stuff in every day,” Scolaro says. “But the ingredients are fresh

and natural and more nutritious.”
For Kassab, personality matters as well. “We’ve had times when
some three-piecer will come in, slick talking, and he doesn’t have our
best interests in mind.” She contrasts that withBob Newman of Goff’s
Seafood in Chester. “He has a common-sense approach to food, and I
can usually trust his judgment,” she says. And her trust has paid dividends, she says
“fish here has become hugely more popular.”
Of course, being small has its downsides. Without the institutional
resources to spend much time researching suppliers, Kassab says she
takes her suppliers’ words when they guarantee the safety of the food.
“I’m pretty naive in my trust that when Wawa says [bovine growth hormone] is not in the milk, it’s not in the milk,” she says.
And this trust extends to documentation, as well. Though the Food
and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture require
suppliers to provide Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point documentation to ensure the food was produced under safe conditions, Sharpies
doesn’t keep information on its suppliers on file. But Kassab says that
if asked, suppliers will not only provide the information but address
any concerns she has.
According to Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall, those
concerns have been few. Sharpies itself complies with the HACCP regulations governing its activities, which include, among other things,
rules about the proper refrigeration and preparation of food. And
though organic fruits and vegetables have been considered for the dining hall in years past, the cost of organic produce is prohibitively high.
Similarly, concerns over genetic modification have not materialized,

is always crowded for lunch and the lines long, the kitchen staff says it is rarely overwhelmed. "We're far more prepared than
restaurants," says chef Lee Bauer. "We're not trying to turn tables over, just shorten the lines. It's a much more relaxed
atmosphere."

though McDougall says suppliers are willing to discuss those concerns
if they do come up. Scolaro, too, admits that the specter of genetic engineering and pesticides is "scary" but can't justify the increased cost
and decreased quality of other produce.
Though the food safety system is far from perfect, Kassab is positive
that it works. With small, local suppliers, daily deliveries, and close
relationships, Kassab feels safe with her trust in the suppliers. "I'm
confident in the quality of the food. The suppliers are very high-quality
many restaurants don't purchase from suppliers this reputable,"
she says.

HAIL TO THE CHEFS

Chef

John Giannantonio is offended when he hears students com-

plain about the quality of the food at Sharpies. He's been cooking
seriously since he was a sophomore in high school and was
trained at the Culinary Institute of America, widely regarded as the
finest culinary school in America. Before he came to Sharpies eight
years ago, he worked in upscale restaurants in Center City
Philadelphia. And understandably, he is proud of his work and takes
offense when it's impugned.
"Practically everything here is fresh," he says as he stirs Friday's dinner of sweet and sour chicken in a giant skillet. "Other colleges just take
stuff out of the box and put it out. This is the next step down from a restaurant
it's almost fine dining. Few other colleges offer fresh salmon."
Indeed, there's no way Sharpies could be a restaurant. At lunch on
Nov. 16, 825 students stream through the doors of the dining hall, and
the vast majority arrive during a tiny 15-minuterush around 12:30 p.m.
The sheer quantity of food required to feed so many students is overwhelming, and it can't be prepared in traditional ways.
For Lee Bauer, who splits his time between Sharpies and an area
restaurant, the challenge is in tastefully scaling up small recipes to
serve 300 people rather than five. "Teaspoons become cups, and recipes
call for 40 pounds of chicken, but it all has to be adjusted to taste," he
says. "The technique and timing are a lot different."
Like many of the chefs working here, Bauer came to Sharpies for
the easier hours and increased benefits. He admits that there's "a lot
more taste at a restaurant" but says the chefs are always out to
improve the quality of the food. "We really don't pinch a penny or cut
any corners. We use the same quality of ingredients as are used at most
restaurants," he says. "We do prep work the night before, but we never
cook the night before." Cooking in batches, even during the meals
themselves, ensures that the food at the serving stations has never
been sitting in warmers for very long.

WHY YOU STILL COMPLAIN ABOUT SHARPLES

As

the pace in the kitchen slows and the din in the dining room dies
down. Giannantonio and Bauer take a moment to consider why
Sharpies is the object of so much derision. For Giannantonio, it's
a matter of appreciation
the students, he thinks, don't know how
good they have it. "I wish more people went to another college to eat,"
he says.
Bauer sees how the food could get old after a while. Most of the
employees eat while they are here, he explained, and after a few months
eating here, he found himself getting somewhat bored with the options.
Even McDougall, a staunch defender of the quality of the dining hall
fare, concedes that she understands some of the complaints. "We don't
get that many complaints, but I can imagine it can get monotonous eating here every day in the same building with the same walls," she says.
That's why she tries to decorate and hold special occasion meals as
often as possible.
All agree, however, that students would benefit from a greater
understanding of how Sharpies works. Hopson and others suggest that
students spend some time in the kitchen observing or even getting
involved in its workings. With that in mind, she says, the Sharpies staff
has been trying to make itself more accessible.
Unfortunately, says McDougall, the Dining Services Committee,
which used to regularly meet with Sharpies staff, has lapsed into obsolescence this year. When the committee opened itself to applications at
the beginning of this year, McDougall received none. Now, she says, the
primary mode of communication between students and staff is e-maill
about 10 student suggestions are submitted to food@swarthmore.edu
every month, McDougall estimates.
When 2 p.m. comes and the kitchen is deserted for break, the staff
scatters across the now enormous dining hall. A few eat in the small
room and discuss plans for the weekend. Others drift up to the lounge
to check e-mail and, in Giannantonio's case, the progress of fantasy
basketball teams. Jones and Bauer leave Sharpies altogether and head
to the mall for some early Christmas shopping.
The main dining room is quiet. Strains of The Four Tops' "Reach
Out, I'll Be There" and other gentle oldies waft from the speakers in the
serving area. The dim lighting reveals a few stragglers engaged in conversation but little else. In the kitchen, rice hisses in the steam cooker
and tomatoes lie half-sliced on cutting boards. The difficulties of the
morning overcome, Sharpies rests, and braces itself for dinner.

"Practically everything here is fresh.

In Memoriam: a solemn dirge for a deceased canine
BY JOEY SPADOLA

I shall always be the first to reprimand the writer who
indulges himself too deeply in inward-looking themes in
order to hide the (always plain) fact that he has nothing to
say about the world outside his own (obviously empty)
cerebrum. Self-reflexivity, personal reflection, introspective effusiveness they are nothing but bad apples in the
orchard of modern-day scribbling. Indeed, it is a kind of
sin to place such sentimental refuse before the public eye.
We may be assured that Rousseau's soul labors now in
purgatory, and will remain there, by way of poetic justice,
until his writings go out of print. Even St. Augustine, as I
must believe, had trouble passing the pearly gates owing
to his ill-conceived "Confessions."
But these observations notwithstanding, there is such a
weight of grief presently upon my soul that I must, even on
pain of eternal damnation, unburden myself to the reader
with a tale of strictly personal scope and of strictly sentimental value
though I hope it may also answer a purpose in the public and intellectual spheres, if only as a
reminder of the frailty and precariousness of the human
condition.
I arrived home for Thanksgiving in a state of relative
happiness and relaxation. But while rediscovering my
childhood haunts, I was struck suddenly by a vague sense
of disaster, of something positively amiss. I began to
revolve in my mind a thousand possibilities, a thousand
anxious thoughts, in search of the source of this strange
feeling. In the course of these ruminations, I recall thinking that my foreboding sensation was quite similar to that
which is thought to be felt, just before the incidence of
some horror, by those animals, renowned for their sixth
sense, to whom we generally attach the name...
"My dog!" I then ejaculated, all my soul burning within
me because of the unspeakable, the terrible, the ghastly
notion which just at that moment suggested itself to my

mind.
It was then that my mother solemnly confirmed what

she had not dared to mention on the phone: that my childhood friend, mi querido perrito, had, for medical reasons
absolutely beyond her control, been put, in the
euphemistic language of the veterinary trade, to sleep. Put
to that eternal species of sleep
in heaven, because, as
everyone knows, that is where all dogs go.
O crudelis mater! as Virgil expressed himself in like
circumstances (I believe his mother killed his pet lizard).
Cruel mother indeed! There had even gone between us
my mother and I
a very explicit agreement on the matter of the life and death of the aging animal for whom, now,
I can only grieve. I even demanded that she, my mother,
affix her signature, in the presence of a witness, to a document stipulating: That she would never, under any circumstances whatever, consent to the premature killing
or should I say, slaughtering
of the innocent creature,
not even if she, the dog, should require medical treatment
whose funding might oblige the family to get a second
mortgage, not even if she herselfshould express a desire to
die by, for instance, drawing her paw across her throat in
an unmistakably suggestive way.
But everyone who has studied the history oflaw knows
that such agreements are so much wasted ink. The forbidden deed was carried out in spite of all her promises. And
I could do no more than resign myself to the dutiful
mourning in which I have since labored.
Beside the ordinary rites of woe
"the Customary
suites of solemne Blacke, the windy suspiration of forc'd
breath, the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye"
I read a great deal
of poetry touching upon the passing of loved ones, on
many occasions adapting lines so as to render the sentiment more personal:
"And neither the angels in heaven above nor the
demons down under the sea / Can ever dissever my soul
from the soul of my dearest doggy Cally."
But how little do words assuage the ailing soul!
Although the funeral dirge has never since ceased echoing in the caverns of my mind, I did manage once, in a
passing moment of relative mental tranquility, to reflect

Audrey Chan Phoenix Staff

upon a certain very metaphysical question: namely, what
accounts for that strange bond existing between man and
dog?
It is a bond, I think, very peculiar to this country. In
Turkey, they're beaten. In China, they're eaten. In Russia,
they're yoked to a sled. In Ireland, they're just left for dead.
But here they famously serve as best friend for at least half
of the population, and now, after the women's movement,
the statistic is probably nearer 100 percent.
And if they are regarded with special esteem and affection by American college students, it is not extraordinary.
They sleep more than 14 hours of the day, and during what
remains of it, they lie around, maintaining all the while an
air of superiority, of majesty almost. What is more, they
engage in promiscuous sex, with neither guilt nor grief,
and without ever even being obliged, by virtue of certain
well known positioning peculiarities, to contemplate the
face of their partner.
I shall ever sorely miss my old pal. Perhaps, in the
wake of so much mourning, I shall someday resume an
ordinary life. I can only wish that this life will be, in token
of my former love, similar to the life of the deceased.

RASHELLE ISIP

You too can be famous! Well, you can at least get a taste of fame in the form of a homey
celebrity museum, a museum that has shoes worn by the stars, and a brand new performing arts center. And for those who are just looking for some factoids about celebrity
stars, read 0n...

As long as I'm singin'
The Mario Lanza Museum is the place to go to find out about the life of this famous
singer. Mario Lanza (Alfred Arnold Cocozza) was born in 1921 just a few blocks away from
this museum. After taking singing lessons for many years, Lanza was discovered in 1942
by conductor Serge Koussevitsky at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Lanza sang
both arias and popular music. The museum houses photos and Lanza memorabilia such
as gold records, costumes from his movies and paintings. Don't forget to stop by the shop
for some Lanza-oriented gifts.
These shoes are made for walkin'
Shoes. You wear them every day and probably don't think twice about them most of the
time. They help get you to where you're going day in and day out; why not give them a little treat by letting them visit their relatives from years past? The Shoe Museum at the
Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine Center for the History of Foot Care and
Footwear has about 250 pairs of shoes on display. And we're not just talking about your
basic sneaker. There are ballerina shoes, Egyptian burial sandals, children's shoes,
Eskimo boots, as well as shoes donated by celebrities such as tennis star Billie Jean King,
Sally Struthers, Presidents and First Ladies. Just think, if you ever become a celebrity, you
now know of a place to donate your wild and wacky collection of shoes.

Did you know that Philadelphia is opening a brand-new performing arts center next
month? The Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts opens its doors on Dec. 16 at 11 a.m.
with ribbon-cutting ceremonies followed by free live performances throughout the afternoon. The two gems of the center are Verizon Hall, which has a seating capacity of 2,500
people (and is the future home of the Philadelphia Orchestra), and Perelman Theater, a

650-seat space. If you're short on cash, don't think you can't be a part of the celebration.
After Dec. 16, enjoy free activities and performances in this modernistic center. Various
public areas such as Commonwealth Plaza and the Comcast Circle lounges, a garden, bar
and restaurant allow anyone to visit the center.

The celebrities

Sure, you may know that Bill Cosby and Will Smith are Philly-born. But did you know
that comedians W.C. Fields and Larry Fine ("Larry" of the Three Stooges) were born
here? In his movie "Vanity Fair" (1925), Fields suggests an epitaph for himself: "Here lies

TEMPEST: SENIOR COMPANY STORMS OUT
BY CARLA GREENBERG
"The Tempest" has been interpreted
in many different ways over the 400
years since it was written. This year, the
Theater Department's Senior Company
will be performing their own adaptation
of Shakespeare's classic.
Directed by Jon Stancato 'O2 and
Kiran Rikhye 'O2, the company will bring
to life the lush, magical island on which
the play takes place. A group of nobles
and servants are shipwrecked through
the orchestration of Prospero (played by
Katherine Walley 'O2), ousted Duke of
Milan, and his servant Ariel (played by
Keetje Kuipers 'O2). Antonio, Prospero's
brother and usurper of his dukedom,
and Alonso, King of Naples and
Antonio's fellow conspirator, are among
those shipwrecked, according to
Prospero's plan to set things right once
and for all. Complicating matters is

Alonso's handsome son Ferdinand
(Steve Salter 'O2, left) ripe and ready to
seduce Prospero's daughter Miranda
(played by Sarah Yardney 'O2, above and
left). Miranda hasn't seen humans other
than her father since she was four, and
seeing the shipwrecked nobles causes
her to speak her famous line: "0 brave
new world / That has such people in't!"
Senior Company includes actors
Hillary Dresser 'O2, Kuipers, Elisa
Matula 'O2, Salter, Walley and Yardney,
who play all of the 14 characters. The
set was designed by Walley, the costumes by Rikhye, Dresser and Lashanna
Lawler 'O2, and the lights by Salter and
Stancato. The play will be performed
Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 7 and 10
p.m and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. in the
Lang Performing Art Center's Frear
Ensemble Theatre.

Solex
"Low Kick and Hard Bop"
Solex is, like, that girl who doodled all the time, that
you never knew quite what to make of. Her wholesome
would-be sex appeal was kind of at odds with her clothing,
which was ratty and second-hand enough to qualify as
thrift-store chic, but always a little too colorful. You wanted to write her off with epithets like "spunky" and
"cutesy," but weren't sure whether she would reject them
with an indignant glare or maybe just smile lopsidedly.
She's gotten a lot more self-assured, and it's clear that the
coolness side of the equation is winning out, though still
with that hefty slice of dorkiness which, let's face it, was
what cool was all about anyway.
Actually, Solex is the nom du disque of Elisabeth
Esselink, whose approach to sample-based music is, if
nothing else, unique. For her third long-player, the satisfactorily titled "Low Kick and Hard Bop" (it sounds right,
don't bother about what it might mean), she has apparently abandoned her working method from the last record of
bootlegging her own copyright-free samples from live performances, and returned to salvaging bits from
"unsellable" CDs at her Amsterdam record boutique, along
with found sounds and folderol. We're talking about tiny
snippets
a few xylophone notes here, a fragment of a
horn riff there
culled wittily, but wielded musically.
Whereas someone like Beck might use a sample for its
humor value, but fall back on live instrumentation, Solex
sculpts Beck-like music beds with nothing more than a
live drummer and an array of carefully placed samples.

The New Deal
s/t
A few weeks ago, I went to a concert by the best hip-hop band in the world, the Roots.
However, what really got me excited that night was a trio of unlikely looking fellows in
button-down shirts who were on the stage when I walked into the venue. Like the Roots,
this group's modus operandi is to take a genre of music often decried for an excessive
reliance on machinery and to inject it with an incredible level of energy through the
exclusive use of live instruments. Even more than the jazz-inflected funk verite of the
Root's hip-hop, though, the New Deal's music is something truly unique, perhaps paradoxical: live techno. Using only a drum set. a bass guitar and a couple of keyboards, rhe
New Deal create what they describe as 'progressive oreakbeat house." it's odd rhat a

"Elisabeth!" repeatedly, as though to
renounce the first two albums' excessive reliance on the
Solex moniker as a source for wordplay. Then we get a percolating drum stutter, jumpstarted by a bluesy harmonica
blast, which repeats and is soon followed with a slinky guitar slide, before the drums burst into a funky loping
groove. The drums here strut and shuffle, but later on
they're just as likely to swing or bossa nova, and the musical accompaniment might be equally varied.
Complementary, but somehow also in opposition, to
Solex's modernist-retro sound collages are her loopy lyrics.
Take the full text of the tune "Ease Up You
Fundamentalist!": "They were all using the mirrors to
study their mouth movements for themselves / They were
all learning that the curve is the thing when making up
lips." These are absurd nonsense stories delivered with an
earnestness and quizzicality that we usually associate with
children or foreigners. Esselink does fall into the latter category (and her pride in her Dutchness is evident in titles
like "Amsterdam is not L.A." and "You Say Potato, I Say

Jewel "This Way"
In the past year, The Phoenix has attempted to shift its
musical focus to examining and exposing lesser known or
underground hands that would otherwise receive little
mention in the press. But every once in a while, we indulge a little in the
mainstream. Our frolic in pop this semester concerns billboard-bopper
Jewel and her newest album, "This Way"
Jewel's first two projects to become commercially successful, "Pieces of
You" and "Spirit," which included 90s classics like "Hands" and "Who Will
Save Your Soul," in their overpowering sentimentality had even the snobbiest of cynics secretly tapping their feet. But even after three years of laying
fallow, big corporate investment and media hype, "This Way," which was one
of the most anticipated pop albums this fall, doesn't seem to cut it.
Don't be fooled: though Atlantic Recording Corp. hasn't reached the corporate baseness of the execs behind Britney Spears, "This Way" is indisputably a capital-driven endeavor. Jewel hadn't put out a real album in three
years, so Warner Music called on "collaborators" Rick Nowels (the man
behind Madonna and Dido) and Itaal Shur (the man behind Santana's
"Smooth") to "co-author" a few tracks on the new album. The record's opener and projected hit, "Standing Still," was one such "co-authored" song. It
begins with an acoustic guitar supported by light strings and bells. Jewel's
voice enters, and the music builds with a few wishy-washy chords. The listener expects a payoff in the form of a catchy, cathartic chorus, but it never
comes. Instead, Kilcher and Nowels deliver a tedious repetition of a single
chord and its inversions, accompanied by an increase in volume. Her vocal
style is wishy-washy too, undecided between pop and country. Furthermore,
if you listen closely enough, you can detect that it's artificially modified by
a computerized tuner to keep her on pitch (a common trademark of record
-

executive Ron Shapiro).
Regrettably, just when you thought the album's compositional strength
had no where to go but up. it gets worse. The following tracks. "Jesus Loves
You" and "Everybody Needs Someone Sometime," are dull enough to put
disc player to sleep. Things get relatively more exciting when Nowels
and Shur offer their assistance again with "Serve The Ego" and title track
''This Way." but nothing that exceeds mediocrity. Anyway, it's nretty obvijust following the formula

The "bonus"' live tracks attached at the end are the highlight of the

Superchunk
"Here's to Shutting Up"
Superchunk are one of those terribly important
early-nineties indie bands that I never quite got
around to. No less an authority than Amazon.com
has ranked them fourth on their list of Indie
Essentials. The 'chunk, as those in the know call
them, have been around for a while, probably long
enough to know better. But boy am I
glad I heard their eighth and most
recent effort. Usually it's a bad sign
when artists begin putting their best cut
at the start of their albums. But when
that song is as unassumingly catchy as
"Late Century Dream," I can be forgiving. And to be fair, it probably isn't really the best song at all, considered objectively I mean
it's just the first one
that stands out. That tune reincarnates
the ineffable "Don't Worry Baby"
rhythm in the context of indie rock's
trademark eight-beat, with a cheery call-andresponse boy/girl chorus and a supercillious organ
counter-melody. It just makes you feel good. The
rest of the album ranges from string-laden mellow
ones to surprisingly raucous r'n'r, none of it straying far from the familiar indie paradigm that
Superchunk no doubt helped to invent. At the same
time, though, it's hard to imagine a record like this
coming out in, say, 1993. The whole affair just seems
a little too mature. Not that it's square.

Candidates for council share ideas
From COUNCIL, pg. 3
“It’s my second semester senior year,
and I’m busy with other things,” she said. In
addition, “I told [the council] there was this
possibility, and they thought it would still
be better thanhaving a co-president with no
experience.” Anna Woodiwiss ’02, who was
elected in a special election after former copresident Brandon Silverman ’02 resigned,
had already served
for nearly a semester when Tobias
was elected.
“This is an issue
that has come up
before,”
Tobias
said, “because the
new constitution
states that the copresidents are to be
elected by the cam- Liane Rice
1WV
pus and the old constitution required [co-chairs] to be appointed from within Student Council.
“Some discussion has been made about
whether we want to keep the system or go to
the other one,” she said.
Regarding the lower turnout for candidates, outgoing co-president Woodiwiss
thinks it is partly because of Student
Council’s image. “I think council was more
visible on campus last spring,” she said.
This semester, bad timing and less visibility
seemed to combine to produce a low turnout
of candidates. “Probably that we had the
declaring period over Thanksgiving break
didn’t really help much,” Woodiwiss said.
“I was a little disappointed with the
turnout,” said Ryan Budish ’04, campus life
representative until the end of the spring
term. “I think that Student Council should
try to get more people in the running.”
However, he added, “I’m really happy
,,

with the candidates who declared

...

I’m not

concerned with the caliber of the candidates, but of course I wish there were
more.”
Budish said the council needed to do
more to show the student body that participation in council is worthwhile. “The real
thing that Student Council has to do is to
win back the trust of the students,” he said.
“The Student Council has done quite a bit
this semester, but I don’t know if students
necessarily recognize that. It has to become
a more proactive council for students.”

Next semester, Woodiwiss hopes the
council will recruit prior to the declaration
period. “Hopefully, the new presidents will
find a way to revitalize Student Council and
make it a little more visible on campus,” she
said, ‘hnd do more early recruiting.”
“I think there aren’t visible motivating
issues for students to run, but, if they’re
exposed to issues, they’ll be encouraged to
run,” co-presidential candidate Matt Rubin
’03 said. “There’s no reason not to have a
publicity campaign before elections.”
For Rubin and most other students running for Student Council, the possibility of
running a campaign against an opponent is
limited. “I’ve thought about running a
smear campaign against ‘none of the

above,’ Rubin joked.
”

Co-president candidates are Rubin and
Liane Rice ’03. Since they are running for

Their largest hope for Student Council is
that it will become a more active group,
which would require encouraging more students to run for seats.

by former council member Andy Wong 'O2
on how to run a campaign. She said she
would like to see "a larger [workshop] for
the student body, showing people that council's open and that you don't have to be a

"I think there's a climate on campus

think it's important for council to take an
active role in questioning administrative
policy." The two most pressing concerns, he
felt, were college financial aid for students

In his current position as a campus life

which he proposed in his platform at the
beginning of next semester.
"Originally, I had wanted an ice skating

The New York event will include a multimedia presentation by "three young alumni," including live presentations as well as sound and video elements. This was supposed to be a key element of the capital campaign's kickoff
event, and "it's heartening that the heart of that will still
take place," Krattenmaker said.
"With respect to the goals [of the fundraising cam-

paign], no change in that," West said. The college intends
to raise $230 million by the end of 2006. This, West said,
comprises $lOO million each for construction and for new

academic and student programs as well as the $3O million
in "unrestricted money," or donations that are not earmarked for specific projects, that the college raises each
year.
"We look solid," Malcolm said. "Our numbers in annual giving are going up."
West said he thought the higher amount of charitable
donations to relevant organizations following the Sept. 11

attacks could only help the state of Swarthmore's financial

campaign.
"People tend to become more generous and expand
their giving to other causes and continue to support the
things they always supported," he explained, adding that

he said. "If they were to allow points, it would take money out of the
system, and they're already losing money." Using spreadsheets, he
said, "we're working on a scheme where the coffee bar can retain its
autonomy
but give the profits from it back to Dining Services."
Chotalia has also been pursuing the publication of the median
grades at Swarthmore. "People say things like they're here for the
love of learning or whatever, but they have to remember there's still
a real world out there
and jobs and graduate school," he said.
"Publishing median course grades," he wrote in his September platform, "would allow schools and employers to see us in the appropriate context."
Next semester, a new student will take over Chirag's current seat
on council, campus life representative. Ed Stehlik 'O5 hopes to be
that person. His primary concern is campus safety. Stehlik proposes
using keys that would open all dorms on campus, ending the dangerous practice of "finding a chair shoved into the doorway. "If everyone
had keys to all the dorms, there would be no door-propping."
Stehlik is also interested in extending the hours of Sharpies and
Essie Mae's snack bar. "Coming out of lacrosse [practice], it was next
to impossible to make it to Sharpies," he said, and he knows this is a
similar concern among athletes. "Even a half hour would make a
huge difference," he said. Stehlik believes he is qualified for the position because of his willingness to listen and his dedication. "Once you
I don't really give up easily," he said.

The final position on Student Council open this semester is student events adviser, a post Marielena Velez 'O4 wants to fill. She
hopes to become a liaison between the student body and Student
Council. "While I've been here," she said, "I never heard what
Student Council was doing." Velez hopes to increase communication
between the two bodies.
As for techniques to keep the student body more informed, she
said she would keep using reserved-students e-mails. "I know not
everyone reads it," she said, "but it's the best way to get something
out to everyone." An idea she culled from looking at previous candidates' platforms, she said, was the posting ofminutes and the summary of how members voted on particular issues. "That way, you
can say, 'I don't like how this person's voting; I'm not going to vote

privacy. "No one wants to tell the deans anything, because [they]
have to see this person every day," said Henry. She said she dealt
with one case where a female student who was being abused by her
boyfriend "got a lot of flak for coming to talk to me."
But, she says, friends should still try to get involved if they think
someone with whom they are close is being abused. "As a friend, you
have a responsibility to approach them about the problem," she said.
All agreed that, when approaching someone you suspect is being
abused, sensitivity is crucial.
"If you know it's happening with a friend, I'd recommend you talk
to your friend about your concerns and try to get a better understanding of what they're experiencing," Ramirez said. "Respecting
another person's right to label their own experience is important,
and what's right for one person might not be right for another."
He emphasized that many students whom the staff in
Psychological Services sees are suffering from abuse from another
perspective: as a witness. "When a student is a child of parents who
were or are abusive, sometimes that can feel worse," he said. "When
you're being abused yourself, there's some sense of agency, but witnessing abuse is hard. That's why it's hard for friends to witness. No
one likes to feel powerless, especially Swat students."

ISPORTSI
MARK JANOFF
The Sweet Spot

The p-word
Does anyone else get the feeling that watching a
National Football League game is like watching one long,
painful three-hour coin toss? There is so much parity in
the NFL that any team can win any game on any given
Sunday. Take last Thursday's game between Green Bay
(7-3) and Detroit (0-10). Blowout? Nope. 29-27 nail-biter?
Yep. As a result of the parity, only three NFC teams
(Dallas, Detroit and Carolina) and three AFC teams
(Jacksonville, Kansas City and Buffalo) are out of the
playoff hunt more than halfway through the season. In
my opinion, there are only three truly good teams in the
league (St. Louis, Oakland and Pittsburgh). The rest of
the teams could just suit up the same players in different
uniforms for all I know.
You challenge: but Mark, you idiot, parity makes the
NFL so fun to watch. You wouldn't want to follow your
favorite team if it was out of the playoff picture in
November, would you? True. That's why the NFL and
owners love parity: huge television contracts . A certain
degree of parity is needed to maintain fan interest, but
the NFL took the concept to absurdity.
One problem with parity is that it creates predictable
postseasons. Even though most teams in the league have
a fighting chance at the last three or four playoff spots in
each conference, only a couple of teams have any championship hopes. So even though I may root for my team to
make the playoffs, I know that it has virtually no shot at
the Super Bowl.
Parity also eliminates the natural cycle of building a
team
a slow rise to the top, several years as an elite
team, and a slow deterioration of talent. Parity eliminates the excitement associated with the stages of the
cycle, like Green Bay dethroning Dallas in the NFC or
Pittsburgh's and Chicago's dynastic reigns.
With the degree of parity in today's NFL, a team can
be in the playoffs one year and stink the next, or vice
versa. The only team that resembles a dynasty is St.
one
Louis, but they had no slow, exciting rise to the top
year they were awful, and the next year they won the
whole thing.
Why is there so much parity? The major controllable
contributor to parity is talent dispersion. Its two main

causes are free agency, which is encouraged by the NFL's
strict salary cap, and expansion, which is caused by idiotic owner approval. Loosening the cap a little (we certainly don't want baseball's problems) and halting expansion could solve the NFL's parity problems.

Briones leads women swimmers to 149-55 win, men
fall to defending Middle Atlantic Conference champions
BY RACHEL

BURSTEIN

"Mixed" was how Krista Gigone
'O4 described the results of the Tide's
Nov. 20 encounter with local non-conference rival Widener College. "We
beat their women by more than they

beat our men," she said, looking on
the bright side. With the women capturing 10 out of 11 events to generate a
final score of 149-55, and the men losing by a score of 108-82, Gigone's
assessment seems apt. The contest
improved the women's record to 4-0
overall and 3-0 in the conference, and

dropped the men to 2-2 overall and 2-1

in the Centennial Conference.
Contributing to the women's dominating performance was Natalie
Briones 'O3, who won the 50 freestyle,
100 freestyle and 100 breaststroke.
Tara Trout 'O4 and Melanie Johncilla
'O5 also aided the cause with their
double wins in the 200 freestyle and
100 butterfly and 200 individual medley and 100 backstroke respectively.
On the men's side, despite the

mark in the loss column, many swimmers emphasized the positive.
"Widener's male talent is undeniable, but our team raced them to the
end," said women's co-captain Lisa
Ladewski 'O2. "The men's medley
relay was especially exciting. Swat
brought the race back from being several seconds behind to being just barely touched out at the finish. The splits
from the guys in that relay were some
of the fastest on our team yet."
David Whitehead 'O3, John Lillvis
'O3 and men's captain Mike Dudley 'O3
each recorded single event wins
against the otherwise dominating

Pioneers in the 100 freestyle, 200 IM
and 100 breaststroke respectively.
For the defending conference
champion Garnet women, who expected to do well against Widener, the
meet provided an opportunity to try
out new techniques and races.
According to the team, these improve-

ments were implemented to varying
levels of success during the meet.

"Everyone was a little run down
and it seemed like starts and turns
were off, but that should get better as

the season progresses," said Amy
Auerbach 'O2. Johncilla also cited
areas that the team could strengthen,
saying, "There could always be
improvement in technique, strength

and overall fitness level."
Meredith Leigh 'O4 agreed, explaining the energy drain that typically
occurs for swimmers at this point in
the season.
"The overall opinion after the
Widener meet was that we looked and
felt tired," she said. "Weekday meets
are more of a problem because of staying up to do homework the night
before. Hopefully everyone rested a
lot over Thanksgiving and will be
Kutztown
recharged
for
the

Invitational."
The

Kutztown

Invitational

is

scheduled for Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 and is
regarded as an opportunity to develop
skills in a competitive arena outside
the conference arena.
"In past years, people haven't been
able to swim the 1650 free or the 400
IM until the conference [championship], which is not the place to be
experimenting with new events," said
Leigh. "Kutztown will give everyone,

especially the freshmen, the chance to
try out some different events and to

see what works for them, as well as
giving them the opportunity to get
conference qualifying times."
In addition to allowing an opportunity for personal practice and
improvement, the Kutztown event
will enable the men's and women's
teams to demonstrate their competitive spirit to teams with whom they
ordinarily don't have contact. As
Auerbach explains, "There are a lot of

division two teams there, so we
should have good competition."
Briones further indicated the
importance of a quality performance, saying, "We're anxious to
make a strong showing, and to measure ourselves against teams we don't
ordinarily see during our regular
season."
In addition, several swinthiers
emphasized the fluidity permitted by
the invitational format. "Invitationals
are fun because you can choose events
based on what you would like to swim
and you aren't limited by the number
of teammates already in the event,"
said Ladewski.
But the Tide hopes to remain
focused not only on performing well,
but on improving technique at the
Kutztown Invitational. "We have
devoted much of our practice time to
our starts and turns, in an effort to
beat our opponents with technique,
not just with pure power," said Seth
Jacobson 'O4.
Despite the mixed finish at
Widener, swimmers hope to utilize
their carefully practiced technique
throughout the season.

Lewis, Gustaf son pace men's hoops

the best start to the season since the the '96-'97 season, the team embarked on a tough three-game road
trip, dropping all three matches to opponents
Gwynedd-Mercy, Rensselaer Polytechnic and Union.
"The difference between our performance in the
Equinox and the past three games is partly being on
the road. But it is mostly that we have not shot the
ball as a team very well," said Wimberly.
One of the few bright spots has been the play of
first-year forward Gustafson. "Matt Gustafson has
been our best player so far this season, and we can
only hope for the same contribution from him
throughout the season," said Chris Loeffler. In the
66-56 loss at Gwynedd-Mercy on Nov. 20, Gustafson
scored 22 points on 8-15 shooting. "I took a lot of open
shots. We set pretty good picks, so it was easy to get
open," said Gustafson. The rookie is currently
eighth in scoring in the conference, and was named
to the weekly honor roll.
The Tide, however, only managed to shoot a paltry 30.3 percent (20-66) from the floor. After a decent
opening half against the Gwynedd-Mercy Griffins,
the team's offense sputtered in the second half, connecting on only 1-11 shots from beyond the arc. The
Griffins were able to take control of the game,
outscoring the Garnet by nine points in the second
half after a slight 34-33 advantage in the first half.
"We couldn't put an entire game together." said
Gustafson. "We came out slow in the beginning of
the second half."
On a more positive note, the Tide's defense was
able to hold the 3-1 Gwynedd-Mercy Griffins to only
66 points. In the previous two games, the Griffins
unleashed a combined 176 points against their opponents. "Overall, our defense has been much better
than last season, and has kept us in games when our
offense has staggered," said Chris Loeffler.
On Nov. 24, a stalled second-half offense once
again contributed to the team's loss, this time at

Rensselaer Polytechnic. Although Gustafson poured
in a game-high 16 points, and Chris Loeffler added 12
points and six rebounds, the team's offense hit a
roadblock in the second half. After knocking in 13
field goals in the first half, the offense was only able
to add five more in the second half.
The team was also out-rebounded for the first
time this season, 41-30. "It is very frustrating for a
defense to make a team miss a shot and then have to
continue defending because the offense gets a
rebound," said Chris Loeffler.
On Nov. 25, the team closed out its New York state
road trip with a loss to the Union Dutchmen.
Dutchman Aaron Galletta, who knocked in 41 points
to lead Union over Haverford the previous night,
matched
Gustafson with 23 points against
Swarthmore. Gustafson shot 10-14 from the field and
grabbed 8 rebounds to lead the Tide to a 73-60 loss.
Pearce was the only other Swarthmore player to
score in double digits, with 10 points.
"Our team is still making inexperienced mistakes, despite the fact that everyone has had experience on the court," said Chris Loeffler. "If we can
just play smarter basketball and make free throws
when we need them, I think we will be able to

improve dramatically."
Although Wimberly is confident that his team
has improved from last year, its success "will
depend upon how much we continue to improve,
how we can play on the road and how we can deal
with our youth." Unlike the two games at the
Equinox Classic, in future games Wimberly will be
relying more on his younger, inexperienced players.
This Thursday, only one upperclassman will start in
the conference opener against Western Maryland;
the other four starters will be freshmen and sophomores. "Our team looks forward to playing at home
with a big crowd to help the intensity on the court,"

said Chris Loeffler.

Tip-off against Western Maryland is 7:00 pm on
Nov. 29.

Garnettes meet elite in St. Louis to go 1-1
From WOMEN'S HOOPS, pg. 24
Not used to the running game that the Green Team threw
at them, the Garnet went down fighting in a 74-59 loss.
Despite significant contributions from Kile (23 points, 9
boards) and Ali Furman 'O3 (20 points) turnovers and
tired legs sealed the second-place fate of the home team.
Looking to take out post-tournament-loss aggressions
on a team that they hate, the Garnet Tide was looking to
get even with Western Maryland College for past grievances. The Tide won, but they managed to keep it interesting right down to the last possession, with a close
score of 60-58. Using the defense that made them famous
last season, the Garnettes managed to fluster the Green
Terror's offensive guns while making their way to a solid
home team lead. The team was aided and abetted by a tagteam performance of Kile and Robinson, who combined
for 46 of 60 points, the duo also combined for 27 rebounds.
The Garnet Tide out-rebounded the Green Terror by 10
boards in the contest likely the difference in the outcome of the game. Chalk up a 60-58 win to the Garnet for
a 1-0 Centennial Conference start.
Nursing full bellies after a short Thanksgiving hiatus,

the Garnet ladies boarded a plane on Friday afternoon to
St. Louis (where Kevin Perry 'O4, Felicia Carter 'O3 and
assistant coach extraordinare, Doug Rouse all live).
Thanks to a healthy athletic endowment, the women
were housed in a lovely downtown hotel adjacent to the
famous arch where they were forced to endure a banquet
with the other tournament teams only to affirm the obvious
Swat has the best-dressed coaches in the nation!
Diner breakfasts, expensive Italian dinners and a rare
chance to watch cable, all added to the Midwestern
Holiday Bonanza.
Lacking confidence in the face of the national hype
surrounding the reputation of their first opponent,
Wisconsin Stout University, the Tide came out not quite
quick enough, and unsure of themselves against these
girls from the west. Their warp-speed quickness combined with brawn on the boards proved a bit overwhelming for the Tide and established an 11 point half time lead

for the Blue Devils. In a breakout performance by Ali
Wolff 'O5, this rookie stepped up to the challenge and
cashed in with 14 points. Shockingly, the other two
Tideswomen to post big numbers in the contest were Kile
(12 points) and Robinson (26 points). Late in the second
half the Garnet tied up the score, but the tenacity of the
opposition squashed their surge. The Blue Devils took the
contest 74-64.
Longing to come away from the tournament with a victory, the Tide knew that they would have to turn it on in
the consolation game against Washington and Lee. Thanks
to a total team effort, the Tide managed to come away with
the win in a 64-49 defeat of the Generals. Keys to Swat's
strategy were shutting down their menacing post players
and controlling the tempo of the game while forcing
turnovers. Furman worked the arc on the floor by shooting her way to 11 points. Kile added another accolade to
her trophy shelf as she plucked down a record-breaking
rebound making her the all time leader in that category
at Swarthmore
in the course of the game, while adding
19 points. Deserving her All-Tournament Team nod,
Robinson delivered yet another show-stopping performance with 20 points. The Tide forced 23 turnovers and only
committed 12 themselves in the victory.
In a final game of the flurry of activity before a muchdeserved rest, the Garnet Tide drove to their sister school
to face a different Bryn Mawr team from years past. Gone
are the days when the ladies of Bryn Mawr can't afford
an illness on the team because they only have six players.
There will be no more games where they are held to single digit scoring. This ain't yo' momma's Bryn Mawr
team. Oddly enough, the Garnettes only went into the
locker room with a six point lead. Increased effort on the
boards and increased desire to take care of the ball were
the rallying cry of a displeased coaching staff during the
half time break. Swat came out shooting their way to a
more appropriate lead as the entire team focused in a
concerted effort. Furman led the Tide with 14 points, and
was 50 percent from three-point land. Robinson chipped
in with 12 points, while Kile (12 points, 10 rebounds) and
Emily Gray 'O2 (10 points, 11 rebounds), each had double-

Veterans take Tide to best start since
'96-'97 season despite 0-3 road trip
BY DERRICK WU
With 300 spectators in attendance at the
Lamb-Miller Field House for the first
round of the 10th Annual Equinox Classic,
forward co-captain Kyle Lewis 'O2 set the
tone for the Garnet Tide in the 2001-2002
season opener in a 77-60 victory over Tufts
University on Saturday, Nov. 16.
The senior forward from New York City
made 6 of 7 shots from the floor, including
a perfect 3-3 from behind the three-point
line to score a career-high 21 points in the

win.
"Kyle had a terrific Equinox Classic,
shooting the ball very well, as well as really defending," said head coach Lee
Wimberly.
Lewis' spectacular play overshadowed
the excellent performances of forward Matt
Gustafson 'O5 and point guard Jacob
Letendre 'O4. Gustafson opened his
Swarthmore career on an excellent note,
netting 15 points in just under 20 minutes

of play.
"Matt Gustafson has put up terrific
numbers in our first games," said
Wimberly.

Point guard Jacob Letendre 'O4 also had
an outstanding all-around game, with 14
points, five steals and four assists. Chris

grabbed seven rebounds apiece to give

"We are certainly better than we were
last year, but how much will depend upon
how much we continue to improve," said

Wimberly.
In the second round of the Equinox
Classic, Lewis once again dominated the
game, this time in a second round victory
over the Washington and Lee Generals at
Haverford College. Lewis scored a gamehigh 16 points to lead the Garnet Tide to a
70-63 victory.
Guard Joey Armstead 'O3 also contributed a career-high 15 points and guard
David Pearce 'O3, last season's leading scorer, chipped in with 11 points. "Our entire
team played well at the Equinox Classic,"
said Gustafson. "We spread the ball out
really well."
In the other second round game of the
Equinox Classic, Tufts University bounced
back from Saturday's loss to Swarthmore
to handily defeat Haverford 75-53, making
Swarthmore the only undefeated team in

Garnettes have mixed results against
elite teams, Kile sets rebounding record
BY EMILY GRAY AND CAITLIN RYLAND
The women's basketball team has been
experiencing a virtual whirlwind of activity lately. They have gone from hosting a
tournament to battling a perennial conference foe to suiting up in the arena of the
four-time Divison 111 national champions
Washington University (in St. Louis), to
turning around to face a new and improved
Bryn Mawr squad.
In the past two weeks, the Garnet Tide
has faced competition much more menacing than in the past, and has risen to the
occasion.

The Garnettes kicked off their season
with a sound defeat of Juniata College, 71-

58. In a concerted effort to stop continued
resurgence by the scrappy Juniata squad,
many women on the Tide stepped up.
Buoyed by the 29 and 25 points of quad-

captain Heather Kile 'O2 and Katie
Robinson 'O4, respectively, and a wellrounded effort on the boards, the Garnet
earned their first 'W of the season, one
possession at a time.
Peeved that Coach Shibles had not invited weak competition that would make
them look good in front of the home crowd,
the team was in for it when they had to face
Plymouth State College in the championship round of the tournament. Not used
