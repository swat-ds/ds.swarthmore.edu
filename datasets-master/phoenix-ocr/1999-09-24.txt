Debate wins bid
to host nationals
By David Ellis

For The Phoenix

Last weekend Swarthmore's
Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society
won its bid to host the National
Parliamentary Debate Championships this spring.
Swarthmore won its bid to host
Nationals in decisive fashion
over Mount Holyoke at Columbia University last Saturday. The
victory reflects Swarthmore's
growing recognition on the national debate circuit.
Nationals, which will be held
April 14-16, 2000, is an ambitious undertaking, involving

over 200 debaters and judges
from almost 50 prominent colleges and universities. Swarthmore is a memberof the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA), which draws
primarily from theEastern seaboard, but includes a handful of
Pacific and Midwestern schools.
Nationals is the culminating
event of the rigorous, year-long
APDA tournament schedule.
Teams must qualify for attendance by reaching finals at tournaments over the course of the

Pinball machines coming soon
ByAni Silwal
For The Phoenix
Student Council and Student
Budget Committee finalized a
plan to buy three pinball machines that will be installed in
Tarble Lounge Tuesday.
Student Council co-chair Matt
Schwartz 'Ol, who has taken the
responsibility of purchasing the
machines, expects the machines
to be operational by Oct. 7. The
machines are an attempt by the
council to revitalize the social
scene on campus.
Why these pinball machines,
when the college already has
video games and pool tables in
the game room?
Schwartz said the game room
has not been able to attract many
students mainly because it is located out of the way of students.

NATHAN ASHBY-KUSHMAN | Phoenix Staff

Matt Schwartz's proposal to put
pinball machines inTarble Lounge
includes refurbishing the Speakeasy
machine currently housed in
Sharpies Dining Hall.

Since the pinball machines are
going to be installed in a place
where a lot of students pass by
every day, he hopes that they will
be more popular among students.
"It will be a game that will
bring together diverse students," Schwartz said.
He plans to organize a campus-wide tournament this semester to introduce and to promote the use of these machines.
In the first year of operation, he
also plans to organize campuswide, Student Council-sponsored
pinball tournaments and parties
with refreshments, music and
trophies.
Other campus organizations
can also throw pinball parties at
$l5 an hour. At other times, students will have to pay 25 cents
per game.
The money will first go to the
Student Activity Fund, which is
supplying the money to buy the
machines. After the first $6OOO
have been raised, the revenue
will go to Student Council.
The three machines will cost
$6OOO altogether and will include
a late 19905, an early 1990s and
a vintage pinball machine, in
addition to the refurbished
Speakeasy game currently in
Sharpies.
Many students have expressed concerns over the cost
of the project and rumors that
the expense will raise the Student Activity Fee.
However, Student Budget
Committee treasurer Josh Bess
'OO said that if the fees are
raised, it won't be because of the
pinball machines. If the machines aren't as popular as
hoped, they can be easily resold
for 80 to 95 percent of their original value.

Planning committee has five possible science center designs
By Vincent Ip
For The Phoenix
The Science Center Planning Committee has released
preliminary drawings of a
new science complex, sure to
become a welcome addition to
the aging science buildings of
the North Campus.
The project will primarily
consist of major renovations
to DuPont Science Building. A
new 60,000-square-foot build-

ing (the size of Kohlberg Hall)
is also planned, to alleviate the
classroom shortages in DuPont.
The complex will be built with a
focus on linking DuPont, Martin,
and Cornell Science Library to
foster greater interaction between science departments, students, and faculty.
Although the Science Project is
still in its early planning stages,
a comprehensive timeline has already been established, predicting a groundbreaking date as

early as June 2001.
The Committee has considered five different conceptual
diagrams so far. Many of the
buildings appear box-like, as
they are only general "hypotheses" of the way the new
structures may be placed. According to Biology professor
Rachel Merz, co-chair of the
Science Project Committee,

Body found in Michigan State
U. residence hall basement
By JeremyW. Steele
The State News (Michigan State)
(U-WIRE) EAST LANSING,

Mich.
The body of a former
Michigan State University student was discovered at 2 p.m.
Wednesday in the basement of
South Wonders Hall. A hall employee found the body while investigating the source of a
strong odor.
Police tentatively identified
the body Wednesday evening but
are not releasing the name until
family has been notified, said
MSU police Capt. Tony
Kleibecker.
"He is not a student now,"
Kleibecker said. "But has been
in the past."
The body of a male in his early
20s was found in a kitchen area,
once used as a snack bar,
Kleibecker said. The kitchen,
reportedly inaccessible to students, is adjacent to a study
room, he said. Police are labeling the death as suspicious, but
detectives have not found signs
of foul play.
"The body has been there for
some time," Kleibecker said
soon after the body was discovered. "And at this point it's difficult to determine race and sex
even."
An autopsy will be performed
this morning to determine the
cause of death, Kleibecker said.
The area of the basement
where the body was discovered
will be closed off until investigators are finished, he said. The

South Wonders Hall basement
also houses storage rooms, laundry facilities and a fitness room.
About 600 students live in each
of Wonders' two wings.
Residents had complained of
a strange odor in the south lobby
and near a stairwell leading to
the basement and cafeteria for
several days.
Child development senior
Emily Schwab, who worked as a
Wonders security guard during
the summer, said the kitchen
where the body was found is normally kept locked.
"I was in that little kitchen
area many times," Schwab said,
adding she hasn't been in the
room since mid-August.
The kitchen does not have any
outside windows, and there is
only a small opening between the
kitchen and adjacent study
room, she said.
"It's like a little drive-up window," she said. "You couldn't get
through it."
No-preference freshman Julia
Woerle said she noticed a bad
odor Wednesday while at her
class in Wonders.
"I never would have thought
it was a body," she said. "It was
just a really bad smell."
Woerle said she hadn't noticed
the odor Tuesday when she had
class in Wonders, but said some
of her friends had.
"No one knew what it was," she
said.
Several classes held in Wonders were canceled or moved
Wednesday afternoon.

MSU President M. Peter
McPherson said Wednesday
evening he did not know how the
body got into Wonders, but students should not feel in danger
because of this death.
"I don't think what we have
here is anything to suspect there
is any danger involved," he said.
Journalism freshman Becky
Smialek, who lives on the third
floor of South Wonders, said she
noticed a strange odor for the
last several days.
"It's really, really freaky,"
Smialek said. "I was down there
(in the basement) writing a paper at 11 last night."
Smialek, who also said the
kitchen is kept locked, did not
know if she wanted to sleep in
Wonders on Wednesday night.
"We're not even sure if we're
spending the night here,"
Smialek said. "It's just slightly
uncomfortable knowing that
happened here and we've not
lived here a month."
Smialek's friend, no-preference freshman Kari Stander,
said she first noticed a strange
odor on Monday.
"From now on whenever I go
to the basement I'm never going alone," said Stander, who
lives on the fifth floor of South
Wonders.
Kleibecker said people should
be patient untilpolice determine
what happened.
"People have to do what they
need to do to feel safe,"
Kleibecker said. "There's no reason to panic at this point."

Harvard Medical School professor
announces anti-cancer substance
By Sasha A. Haines-Stiles
Harvard Crimson (Harvard U.)
(U-WIRE) BOSTON
Researchers at Boston Children's
Hospital have discovered a naturally occurring protein fragment
which has been shown to inhibit
tumor growth in mice, the third
isolated at the hospital's labs.
The Medical School's Andrus
Professor of Pediatric Surgery
M. Judah Folkman announced
last Friday that tests at his lab
at the Children's Hospital had
confirmed the effectiveness in
mice of the protein fragment,
called antiangiogenic antithrombin (aaAT), in suppressing the
formation of blood vessels that
feed tumor growth.
This discovery comes less
than two years after Folkman
published his lab's detection of
the second of two protein fragments thought to suppress tumor
growth. The three fragments
have only been tested in animals,
and it will be impossible to judge
the potential of these substances
in fighting human cancers until
extensive clinical trials are held,
at least.
In a 1997 article in the journal
Cell, researchers in Folkman's
lab, including Folkman and
angiostatin discoverer Michael
S. O'Reilly, wrote that their findings and experimental data "suggest a theme of fragments of
proteins as angiogenesis [blood
vessel growth] inhibitors."
As explained in an article in
the Sept. 17 issue of the journal
Science, the human body contains numerous proteins which
limit blood vessel growth under
normal conditions such as menstruation and wound healing.
Now researchers speculate
that these proteins may also in-

hibit cancer growth.
The aaAT fragment was first
discovered in human lung cancer cells by O'Reilly, a clinical
fellow at the"Children's Hospital.
The protein's sequence was
first analyzed at the Harvard
Microchemistry Facility. William S. Lane, director of the facility, said that although his lab's
high-tech equipment aided the
discovery, it is the Folkman lab
that should be congratulated.
"We determined the peptide
sequence," Lane said. "But kudos to Folkman and O'Reilly for
isolating the protein," he
stressed.
Two other scientists in
Folkman's lab, Oliver Kisker and
Steven Pirie-Shepherd, later
confirmed O'Reilly's finding
when they saw the same protein
being produced by human pancreatic cancer cells.
By implanting human tumors
into mice and comparing tumor
growth, scientists can try to
identify which types of human
tumors could possibly be used in
future to inhibit cancers, according to the Science article.
Folkman's lab has previously
reported successful experiments using the anti-angiogenic
endostatin
proteins
and
angiostatin on tumors in mice. In
those experiments, the substances were shown to cause tumors in mice to regress to microscopic size.
Theseresults have been duplicated by scientists at the National Cancer Institute, according to its recent press release.
Researchers at Bristol Myers
Squibb and other biotechnology
companies, however, say they
are unable to reproduce the results, stirring some controversy
over the validity of Folkman's

methodology.
Mallinckrodt Professor of
M.
Chemistry
George
Whitesides '6O suggested that
disparity between labs' results
may stem from the different
ways they are trying to relate the
vascular system's growth to tumor growth.
"Folkman has his approaches
to this problem; other research
groups and companies have
other approaches," he said. "But
the point is that the concept of
inhibition of angiogenesis is a
fundamentally very important
one, both because it seems to me
very likely that it will work, at
least in some cases, andbecause
it has stimulated new ways of
thinking about the very difficult
problem of treating cancer."
Whitesides explained that
Folkman's research uses a methodology of attacking "normal"
tissues that support a cancer,
such as vascular tissue, rather
than targeting the cancer itself.
"Folkman's work has produced a shift in the way that the
biomedical community is thinking about treatment of cancer,"
he said.
Traditional cancer therapies—including surgery, radiation and
chemotherapy—overlook the
fact that cancer, a derangement
of the genome, has a strong tendency to mutate and become insensitive to certain treatment
agents.
Whitesides added that those
traditional treatments may not
help in those cases where the
cancer spreads beyond the
treated, or treatable, areas. Traditional cancer therapies are
also notoriously hard on the patient as both malignant and normal tissues are susceptible to
toxic agents.

Study asserts influence
of college rankings
ByYoni Levine
Cornell Daily Sun (Cornell U.)
(U-WIRE) ITHACA, N.Y.
U.S. News & World Report College
rankings do significantly affect the number and quality of applications for the next year's freshman class, according to a Cornell
University professor.
"Although people used to discount [the rankings], enough students
and parents focus on them that when rankings go up, good things
happen for the school and vice versa," said ILR Prof. Robert G.
Ehrenberg, coauthor of a new report titled, "The Impact of U.S.
News & World Report College Rankings on Admissions Outcomes
and Pricing Policies at Selective Private Institutions."
He said that although 80 percent of college applicants go to their
local universities and colleges, "it's in the top 50, where colleges
are ranked [ordinally] where people are neurotic about it. It's that
population of high achievement kids to whom this data matters significantly," Ehrenberg continued.
The study was the first of its kind to provide "empirical analysis
of the impact of these rankings on applications, admissions, and
enrollment decisions, as well as on institutions' pricing policies,"
according to its abstract.
Ehrenberg's study linked a single drop in ranking for a school in
the top 25 with an increase in the institution's admit rate of .399.
The number of accepted students matriculating declines and the
average endowment per student increases to counteract the lower
yield and retain more of students admitted. "An increase in rank of
10 places leads to a reduction in aid adjusted tuition of approximately 4 percent," the report stated.
The largest reductions in average SAT scores are felt at the top
of the rankings, so that an improved rank will lead to a modest increase in the quality of the institution's incoming freshman class.
Ehrenberg judged that the findings, based on evaluations 17 of
the 25 top ranked national universities and liberal arts colleges over
11 years, could conclusively gauge the effect of the rankings.
He said, "The rankings change from year to year mostly because
[U.S. News and World Report] alters the formula they use. Colleges
sometimes purposely change the.statistical numbers that factor into
the formula without actually changing the quality of the school."
For example, Bryn Mawr plummeted from fifth position in 1989
to 23rd in 1990. Based on evidence of dramatic yearly fluctuations,
the study assumes that changes in rankings "not necessarily equal
a change in the 'true' academic quality of the institution," according to the report.
The relationship between the applicant pool and the USNWR college rankings was derived before effects from Cornell's jump from
14th place in 1997 to 6th place in 1998 were known. According to
Ehrenberg, when the study's formula was applied, it predicted with
a fair degree of accuracy the 1999 freshmen class composition and
...

acceptance rates.
The report was issued by the Cornell Higher Education Research
Institute, an independent organization supported by the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation and other donors.

Class of 2000
graduation date
to remain same

Council gives new van green light

Schedule changes possible
for future graduations
By

Jessica Sonnenschein

For The Phoenix

The campaign posters of one of the

groups running for senior class officers

promise to preserve the campus tradition
of senior week both for this year and
years to come.
Despite the danger implied by this commitment, however, senior week, at least
for the class of 2000, is in no need of saving.

When asked about the proposed

change in graduation date for this year's

seniors, Associate Provost and Curriculum Committee Chair Craig Williamson
answered that no change would occur
this spring.
"This year's calendar is already set and
is listed in the catalogue," Williamsontold
The Phoenix.
Commencement for the class of 2000,
scheduled for May 29, continues the tradition of Monday commencements. This
late date guarantees senior week for this
year's graduating class.
The questions about the college calendar remain unresolved, however, for all
other classes. The schedule for 2000-2001
is still listed as tentative, pending recommendations of the Curriculum Committee and a vote by the faculty.
If changes to the schedule are not
passed until late in this academic year,
they probably will not be implemented
until the fall of 2001, Williamson said.
Unless the faculty comes to a decision
soon, the traditionof senior week will also
continue for the class of 2001.
Also unresolved, even for the class of
2000, is the wording of the date on the diplomas. The debate involves the religious
implications of the present word choice
"In the year of our Lord."
In a survey last year, the Curriculum
Committee presented a number of options
to assess campus preference. According
to Provost Jennie Keith, the proposed
changes will be addressed in a faculty
meeting early this semester and the results will be presented to the campus.

On a recommendation by Josh Bess
'OO, Student Budget Committee treasurer, Budget Committee voted to
spend $23,130 for a new-model year
2000 Dodge 15-passenger van. That
decision was confirmed Tuesday night
by Student Council.
The new van replaces Van 16A,

which was assigned to the morning Mary

and failing parts. The problems have worried Bess for months.
"It's an issue of safety with 16A," Bess
told the council before they voted earlier
this week. "The brakes are going; the
steering's going."
"If Student Council wants to continue
the activitiesand movie shuttle to Marple,
we have to replace 16A," he said.
The money for the new van comes from
Student Budget Committee's capital re-

placement account.
Student Council is also considering
creating a shuttle to Genuardi's and
possibly Target on Baltimore Pike
several nights each week. Bess said
the new van was critical if council
wanted to begin that shuttle service
as well.
In other business Tuesday night, Student Council heard from Amy White

parking permits at the beginning of
this semester.

Hurricane Floyd
strikes, Swat suffers
By Marina Boevska
For The Phoenix
It was impossible not to notice the incredible amount
of water that bombarded Swarthmore College last
Thursday, September 16. Swarthmore was greatly affected by Hurricane Floyd, one of the biggest hurricanes
this year. It caused vast amounts of damage around the
country, including the forty-nine deaths.
There were numerous floods around the campus,
mainly in residence halls. Vice Presidentfor Facility Services Larry Schall explained that there were problems
in Wharton, Mary Lyon, Hallowell, Dana, Mertz, Pittenger/
Palmer, and Willets. Of twenty-five workers pumping
water out of the dorms, about half were busy until eight
o'clock in the evening, and eight stayed until ten o'clock.
There were minor drainage problems in Hallowell,
Dana, and Wharton. Some water came through the windows in Dana and Wharton and one of the janitor closets in Hallowell got a little wet.
The basement ofPitt, which is used as a storage place,
was flooded, but only a few boxes got wet. The situation
was a little more serious in Palmer's basement. It had
almost eight inches of water, ruining some students' storage boxes. However, the people from Facilities Services
came really fast and pumped out the water.
The dorms that were most damaged by the rain were
Mary Lyon, Mertz, and Willets.
"The walls of Mary Lyon aren't sealed and they are not
water-proof," said Eugene Turk 'Ol, the basement R.A.
He explained that sometimes when it rains, water
comes through the walls of the basement, but the situation last Thursday was much more serious than usual.
i he boiler room between the two sections of the basement became flooded and there was a leak in a student's
room. Facilities Services came on the next day and dried
the rooms with big fans.
Room 154 on the first floor of Mertz North was seriously flooded. A gutter pipe was clogged and leaked into

A downed tree near Olde Club was among the damage caused by Floyd, which included a number of flooded basement rooms.
the room. Half of the room was really wet and Kate
Conover 'O2 had to move her furniture out and spend
the night in another room.
The situation was the worst in Willets. Not only did
Mephistos get flooded, but so did the men's bathroom
and two rooms on the basement floor. The rooms were
evacuated and the furniture was moved into the hall,
the lounge, and the kitchen. Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol
said that she "started screaming" when she came into
her room that afternoon and found out that "water was

covering half of the floor." At first, she moved out only
her electrical appliances because she was thinking that
the leaking would stop, but then all the furniture was
moved out. Pat Murray 'Ol, the R.A. in Willets basement,
called Facility Services and they came right away to
pump out the water from the two rooms and the men's
bathroom. According to Howes-Mischel, Facilities was
"wonderful! They stayed so late and worked until all
the water was out." There are no further damages from
the flooding.

as a capstone to the APDA year,
have traditionally been a monumental undertaking.
"Teams have always been
housed in hotels and lavished
with banquets and other luxuries," said Peaslee Debate Society president Darius Ornston
'OO. "When you throw in the logistical requirements of coordinating over 40 simultaneous debate rounds over the course of
three days, it's not only a matter of being rather expensive,
but extremely complex as well."
Swarthmore has designated
four tournament directors,
Ornston, John Dolan 'Ol, Mimi
Hanaoka 'Ol and Tenaya
Scheinman 'Ol, to organize and
run the three-day event. They
have been preparing for the
event since last spring in anticipation of the bidding process at

Columbia.

While Brandeis and Amherst
were also expected to present
bids to host Nationals, both
schools dropped out, leaving circuit lightweight Mount Holyoke
as

Swarthmore's

only competi-

tion.
"The school administration
has been absolutely vital to host-

Nationals," said Ornston.
We definitely could not have
done this without their generous

ing

support."

Despite this support, the
school administration had expressed concerns about a conflict between Nationals and Pro-

spective Student Weekend,
scheduled for the same weekend in April.
"Given that many of the
tournament's activities occur at
an off-campus hotel, the two
events shouldn't conflict with
each other," Ornston said. "But
to the extent that they coincide,
the debate tournament is both
excellent publicity for the
school as a whole and also a
source of wholesome family entertainment."
Capturing the bid is part of a
larger string of successes for
Swarthmore after a two-year
dry spell. Damon Taaffe '99 and
Dolan finished as the seventhplace team in the nation last
year, although they only attended tournaments during the
fall.
More significantly, however,
Swarthmore acquired a reputation for its powerful reservoir
of young talent last year, as
many of its novices took home
awards. Furthermore, Swarthmore has been similarly successful in recruiting young talent this year.
"The novices this year have
the capacity to be better than
Damon and I within a couple
years," said Dolan.
Ornston agreed with Dolan's
assessment of the future.
"Given its unusual strength,
youth, and depth, the Peaslee
Debate Society anticipates
maintaining a significant presence on the national debate circuit well into the future,"
Ornston said.

minimizes demolition and brings additions to Cornell to
provide further space for Biology and shared functions;
and design E goes for several smaller buildings instead
of one large building, creating several courtyards that
enhance the North Campus entry.
Designs A and B have already been ruled out because
of design and cost. The four-story structure in Design A
fails to bring the sciences together, and would create a
"giant" behind DuPont. Design B meets the requirements
of the science complex, but it is $8 million over the already-generous $60.5 million budget for the project.

The Designs
Design A (top left): Known as the "Pavilion in theWoods."
A new four-story building is built in the DuPont parking lot.
Design B (middle left): Known as the "Classical" scheme.
DuPont is demolished, and a new two-story building is built
in its place.
Design C (bottom left): Known as the "Corner" scheme.
The Physics and Astronomy section of DuPont is demolished, and a new three-story building is built on that site
and in front of Cornell.
Design D (bottom middle): Known as die "Pavilion on the
Quad." A new four-story building is built in front of DuPont.
Design E (bottom left): Known as the "Three Courtyards"
scheme. A handful of smaller buildings are built connected
to DuPont.

Some unanswered questions
It only took the 14-memberSwarthmore Borough task force a little more
than a year to realize that the Ville is a hole.
With few exceptions, Swarthmore's business district is unenticing, ugly
and shoddily built. Many businesses' goods
but more importantly, hours
put to rest any hope of revenue from diurnally-challenged Swatties. After
a multi-year losing streak, the Ville had only one win so far this year, when
someone finally opened an ice cream parlor with late hours.
So after years of talk and complaints, the borough is understandably
feeling the pressure to act, to actually do something. It's similar to the
newfound energy the college science departments have to work on renovating DuPont after all, both the Ville and the science building have rats.
DuPont has so many problems that the only logical way to fix it is through
at least partial demolition. But that is not the plan for the Ville. The task
force decided that the only possible place for the new hotel and parking
garage is on undeveloped land near the business district in other words,
on college property.
We do not take issue with the borough's dedication to revitalization; in
fact, we feel the goals of improving the business district's appeal and
appearance are long overdue. The emphasis on construction of the hotel,
bookstore and restaurant is understandable/But people outside the college
community are pushing the process too quickly.
The Swarthmorean editorialized last week that development on the
college's Clothier Field site is "the linchpin of the entire plan." A hotel could
benefit both the borough and the college, but if the task force expects a
rubber stamp from the school, they have thought wrong.
First of all, the college takes years to make important decisions. Science
students and faculty had been complaining for years about the school's
outdated facilities, but it was not until last semester that the Board of
Managers seriously considered revamping DuPont. Although the board will
be receiving the task force's report this weekend, expecting an instant
decision, much less a favorable one, is out of the question.
Second, although the task force's report was not officially presented until
last week, its contents were discussed widely in the Borough of Swarthmore
this summer. So although the more permanent borough residents have had
weeks to think about the report's recommendations, Swarthmore students
have not. It doesn't help that this issue's center spread will be most students' first contact with the proposals. The task force has not been very
forthcoming about giving the report to the college —we had to steal ours.
So students need more time to digest the proposals. The college administration, including task force member Vice President for College and
Community Relations Maurice Eldridge, apparently hasn't had enough time
either, because no has yet completely answered some important questions:
Who would own the hotel? The task force report says simply, "It is
recommended that the Borough and the College pursue development of a
high-quality, small-scale inn (approximately 65 rooms) with a restaurant in
this area." The report does not specify whether the college would or should
own an interest in the operation, and it is unclear whether there would be
enough visitors to the college to fill the hotel year-round.
What would happen to student parking, which is already too tight? The
plan would put a new parking garage where the C Parking Ix)t is now,
saying only, "Some existing College-related surface parking in this area
could be relocated elsewhere within the campus." Even though Eldridge
told The Phoenix that new parking would be found, that idealistic attitude
does not square well with the views of Vice President for Facilities and
Services Larry Schall, who told Student Council this week that building a
new parking lot for students was not even being considered as part of the
upcoming capital campaign, which means a new lot is at le?.st 20 years
away, far longer from now than when the hotel is expected to be completed.
What about the athletic fields? There are few other on-campus sites
where new fields could be located. Even if an new space presented itself, it
wouldn't afford the convenience of proximity to the fieldhouse. And how
much would it cost to make new fields?
And our final question: one student quoted in The Phoenix this week noted
that the new hotel would increase the proximity of Ville residential areas to,
among other things, Olde Club. Why did it take this long for someone to
realize this? With the Swarthmore Police already on campus this semester
to investigate two noise complaints, why are the college and borough even
considering building additional residential space close to one of the
college's major nightlife locations?
We think that until someone answers these questions, the college
shouldn't give the green light to development on its property. In the meantime, the task force's own planning consultant told Borough Council that
each of the recommendations can be implemented independently. While we
in the college community take time to consider the task force's ideas about
development on our property, we hope residents of Swarthmore Borough
who are so enthusiastic about the "linchpin" begin implementing the
report's other recommendations.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

No one tuning in to WSRN
To the Editor:
We feel obligated to present our concerns
about WSRN. In principle, we believe in its
mission of providing alternative programming. However, because of the way the station is managed, it is literally broadcasting
to no one far too often. Basically, the shows
that the WSRN board schedules are so alternative that people generally refuse to listen.
The board doesn't seem to care, but it should,
and so should Budget Committee—last year
it gave WSRN just under $20,000, and this
year about $8,600.
Personally, we fail to see the point of having a radio station with no audience. We'd
guess thatthe station might peak at about 2030 listeners, most of whom are DJs and board
members, and at any given time it is probably a couple of board members at most. It
certainly is fun to have a show (around 120
students this semester) or be on the board
(16), but with no one listening, the mission of
WSRN —and the purpose of having a radio
station—is lost.
To illustrate this, considerhow many more
people could be reached at far less cost by
having DJs run the boom boxes at Sharpies
and Tarble. Instead, the board spends around
$7O of student moneyper DJ/board member
(closer to $2OO last year) and a substantial
amount of time running a station with a great
deal of expensive equipment but only a handful of actual listeners.

We have personal experience with theseissues. First, during the past three years here,
we've literally almost never seen anyone listen to WSRN. But more importantly, as talk
show hosts and DJs, we have seen our shows,
and others with a hope of building an audience, get stifled by the many unappealing
shows the board continues to schedule (while
turning down many potentially appealing
show applicants because they aren't "alternative" enough). This semester, our request
for a talk show was denied, even though we
have more talk experience than anyone on
campus and the potential to draw a good number of listeners. The board has yet to explain
this to us, but we feel it just reinforces our

points.
While we support the continued existence
of WSRN as a Swarthmore institution—it is
an amazing potential resource—we hope the
board thinks about how to strike a better balance between being alternative and drawing
listeners. There is a sizable middle ground
between top 40 hits and whatthe station plays
that couldbe explored. However, in the likely
absence of change in this direction, Budget
Committee should perhaps reconsider why
it funds the station so generously.

Gun control article lists wrong solutions
To the Editor:
I am writing to dispel the many popular
myths and half-truths presented by Ben
Schweigert ("Legislation and Liability," Opinions, Sept. 17). Schweigert is correct when
he states that we have a serious gun violence
problem in this country, and that we have
poor enforcement of laws. For example, Janet
Reno and Bill Clinton love to brag about the
hundreds of thousands of "felons" that have
been stopped by the Brady law, and yet only
a handful have been prosecuted (it is a federal felony for a convict to even attempt to
buy a gun). However, his proposals would
simply push us further into a society of
armed criminals and helpless citizens.
Schweigert states that "there is no federal
agency whose job it is to regulate guns." Yet,
in the very next paragraph, he mentions the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the
very agency that is charged with enforcing
federal gun laws and regulating the manufacture and import of firearms. Schweigert
also asserts that we regulate teddy bears
more than guns. Well, I am confident that
(due to BATF oversight) any gun I buy in this
country today from a federally licensed

Med school rec letters
not GPA-based
To the Editor:
I am writing to correct an inaccuracy in
your recent article about grading at Swarthmore. The Swarthmore Health Sciences Advisory Committee does not take GPA into
account in deciding whether to write letters
of recommendation for Swarthmore students
and alums applying to medical school. There
is no question that GPAs play a very important role in medical school admissions, but it
is NOT true that "medical advisor recommendations are not given to students with lower
GPAs," as your article states (Sept. 17,p. 16).
Our medical school admission statistics reflect a Swarthmore applicantpool with a wide
range of GPAs.

dealer will be safe and reliable, just like your
teddy bear. And if you think that there is "no
gun licensing in the United States," think
again. Every legitimate dealer, and every
gun owner in this country, is fingerprinted,
photographed and background checked. Gun
owners, as a subset of the population, are
far more law abiding than any other group.
Finally, Schweigert points out that (according to a rabidly anti-gun PAC) children
in the U.S. are 12 times as likely to be killed
by a gun than in the rest of the "industrialized world." Which countries are these? Did
you know that every adult in Switzerland
must serve in the militia, and keep a fully
automatic assault rifle and handgun at
home? Did you know that in parts of Israel,
adults often carry an Uzi or handgun just to
go to the market, and this has resulted in a
tremendous drop in terrorist shootings?
How many kids get shot in Switzerland every year? Wake up, America. The streets
won't be any safer if you sue Smith and
Wesson. But maybe if one teacher at Columbine had been armed, 13 more kids might
be alive today.

Students in dire need of space, events
Swarthmore students bored, and with good reason
By Nick Attanasio
For The Phoenix

It isn't much of a secret that Swarthmore has the reputation of being a rigorous, academic, and pretty serious place.
We pride ourselves on it, administrators,
faculty and students alike. We wear shirts
that read "Anywhere else it would have
been an A" and engage in some pretty
thinly-veiled snobbery.
If we're losing to Haverford in a basketball game, it doesn't take us long to
unleash the dreaded "safety school" cheer
on our opponents. When Haverford and
Bryn Mawr students come here to take
the MCATs, the proctor greets them:
"Welcome to Number One." It's our own
warped version of school spirit, a compensation for the one downside to this
college, the one we just don't like to talk
about that much.
Swarthmore just ain't any fun.
I'm a senior, so I'm a little bit bitter, and
I'm a course English major, so I'm a little
bit hostile, but after thinking about what
Swarthmore's single biggest problem is
for more than three years, I've come up
with an answer I'm pretty confident with:
student life.
Even allowing for personal biases, the
problem is glaringly obvious. Aside from
amazing classes taught by first-rate professors, Swarthmore offers students little
else. The administration enthusiastically
"supports" a wide range of extracurriculars (though not financially) and
routinely adds student life to its list of
issues for discussion, but really makes no
concerted effort to improve the student
experience at Swarthmore. This blind
spot became even more glaring when I
took a trip to Haverford last week as part
of my position on Student Council.
It was a different world. Their campus
center is four stories high. It's a friggin'
skyscraper. It houses a bookstore easily
twice as big as ours, with a much larger
selection of magazines, food, lamps, storage crates, fans, and books not required
by any specific class.
There's a gameroom in there, too. It's
carpeted. It holds two sofas, four easy
chairs, three pool tables, six excellent
video games (including Ms. PacMan, a
personal favorite), a ping pong table, a
pinball machine, a foosball table, and a
CD-Player Jukebox. In addition, the campus center holds four meeting rooms, an
out-of-the-way lounge, an art gallery, and

SWARTHMORE
offices for student groups from Hillel to
the women's center to Student Council.
What about dining, you say? Well, the
campus center sports a snack bar called
the Coop that's twice as big and three
times as nice as Essie Mae's. It's open until
midnight. I've eaten there; it's good. Next
door is Skeeter's, a student-run pizza
place that's open until one a.m. for takeout. Lunt, a student dormitory, also
houses a ten-table student-run cafe that
stays open from nine to one.
The campus center is furnished as
nicely as Kohlberg and has soft, appealing lighting. The building was completed
in 1993 and was recently renovated.
Of course, the campus center isn't the
whole story. Student Activities Coordinator Zach First told me some of the speakers and performers that Haverford has
hosted in the past four years: Joe Clark,
Oliver North, James Carville, Joycelyn
Elders, Harry Wu (a well-known Chinese
dissident), and Bobcat Goldthwait. They
Might Be Giants and the Violent Femmes
have performed there, as has Second City,
the Canadian equivalent of Saturday
Night Live.
Of course, Haverford isn't perfect. Because the campus center is organized
vertically, it doesn't really promote student interaction as much as it could. And
yes, students do have to buy tickets for
some performers and speakers (though
never in excess of $10). But for a school
with three hundred fewer students and a
lower student activities fee (not to mention the stigma of being a "safety school"),
they're kicking Swarthmore's butt in the
student life department.
I'm not sure why Swarthmore is missing the boat on this; I certainly don't think
it's intentional. We just don't seem to pay

much attention to it. In the Planning SubGroup reports and in the recently completed self-study (which few students
have ever glanced at), student life concerns are addressed, but not extensively.
Student space is the report's lowest priority in terms of facilities. It is just not
perceived as a problem.
Well, I think it is a problem—in fact,
Swarthmore's biggest problem. There
have been many times when I've felt like
I go to a school full of unhappy people.
There have been even more times when
I've overheard students complaining
about having "nothing to do" on the weekends. And I have personally felt the frustration of not having adequate space for
student groups.
What the administration has offered us
in the self-study and in the recommendations of the FacilitiesPSG is a refurbished
Tarble and the first floor ofParrish. This
is unacceptable. Parrish would still contain the mailroom, the dean's offices,
CP&P and the Registrar. Students would
get the current admissions space, and
admissions would move up to the Campus Resource Center. Of course, the CRC
was until recently student space, so in
effect the administration is merely giving us back space we had previously occupied. The genuine "new" space generated by this plan is negligible. What we
need is a student union. What we need
right now is a commitment from the administration that they will build one.
In terms of speakers, we need to make
a commitment to more "big name speakers" with broader appeal. Personally, I'd
rather see William Shatner than a hardcore academic. The school is full of academics; we need a little balance. And if it
means I'll have to shell out eight bucks
for a band whose name I actually recognize, I'll gladly do it.

BEN CHAN THE NEW DEVIL'S DICTIONARY

s le,

pleted its annual migration back to campus over three weeks ago. I was expecting, upon my return to campus, to find a
lush, blooming, pastoral paradise. I anticipated returning to a campus where students, refreshed and relaxed from their
three-month hiatus from Swarthmore,
would sit out on Parrish beach on their
lawn chairs, a campus where students
could go for an invigorating work out at
the Mullan Tennis Center, a campus that
was more like a bucolic haven than a pressure cooker academic powerhouse.
I returned, instead, to a campus where
construction projects, massively behind
schedule, grotesquely disfigured the
campus. Swarthmore was breathtakingly
ugly when I arrived here Aug. 31, and as
I write this, three weeks later, it looks no
better. I had imagined that it would be
common courtesy for the administration
to at least send a brief email explaining
the situation and providing anticipated
completion dates for the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) related construction and the Mullan Tennis Center construction. Since that has not been the case,
I'd like to ask those responsible for the
facilities, services, and facilities management of this school a few questions I feel
have not been sufficiently addressed.
My first question is how, for the love
of God, could the surveyor make the same
elementary mistake of miscalculating the
necessary elevations of the paths twice?
And furthermore, if the college was unfortunate enough to hire an incompetent
surveyor, why didthe college not have the
good sense to fire that surveyor after the
second set of drastic miscalculations, if
not the first set? As I understood from
Larry Schall, VicePresident for Facilities
and Services, the college has had considerable prior experience with the general
contractor hired by the college for the
ADA-related construction. This general
contractor in turn sub-contracted various
aspects of the construction out to various
firms, and the surveyor happened to be
unfathomably incompetent.
Is it the case that both the surveyor and
general contractor are quite simply terrible at their jobs and the project has been
continued for nearly a month beyond
schedule? Are these firms gaining financially as a result of the extension of the
construction work? Will the college be
financially responsible for the fees incurred by the setback which have pushed
the project behind schedule? I would love
to know if there have been incidents of
blatant incompetence in the past when
Swarthmore worked with this same general contractor, and if so, why they continue to work with them.
The 18-month delay of the construction
of the Mullan Tennis Center is equally
bizarre. According to Stuart Hain, Director of Facilities Management, "unforeseen difficulties with the subsurface conditions" at the construction site delayed
the work, along with initial planning issues. All the jargon aside, Hain statedthat
they found tree stumps, large chunks of
concrete, and ash burned from tree limbs
buried at the site. While I am still wondering how ash can impede construction
and bring bulldozers to a standstill, I am
more troubled by what I heard mentioned
in passing by a colleague of Hain that
asbestos was found at the site. My curiosity has been whetted by these fragments of information, some of which
seem ludicrous and some quite serious,
and I challenge the college to address
these few concerns that I have aired.

Disposable
lives
Smoking not worth it
While driving through Philly last week-

end, I noticed a new series of billboards

designed to convince youth not to smoke.
They depicted various distorted-looking

children smoking, with captions such as
"Butt head" or "Butt munch," conveying
the obvious message that smoking isn't
cool because if you smoke people will call
you names.
Part of me is impressed that the Food
and Drug Administration is not wasting
money with the same old harmful-effectsof-smoking rhetoric. It has already successfully informedAmerica's youth about
those effects; enough time and money has
been spent on printing witty new warnings on cigarette cartons. Cigarette smokers are not dumb, blind, or deaf, and if
they have not learnedwhat cigarettes do
to their bodies by watching television,
they can reflect on their decreased lung
capacity and figure the rest out on their
own. The reason that people begin to
smoke, and continue smoking, is
smoking's image.
The FDA is on the right track, then, in
attacking smokers' image in their latest
ad campaign. Unfortunately, it is headed
in the wrong direction. I am not going to
pretend to understand what image smokers have, or think they have. In any case,
image varies by geographical location
and age group. However, the ideathat the
FDA can alter the myriad images of
smoking in society is preposterous, especially considering that many of those images are rooted in rebellion.
The FDA would be better off trying to
convince people that their lives are worth
more than the immediate pleasure smoking brings. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for them, and chose for one
reason or another to ignore the harmful
health effects in favor of the benefits.
Admittedly, it is impossible to live without hurting one's self. As my grandmother
used to say, "Everything good in life is
either morally wrong or fattening." I
would be the last one to say that life
should be composed of nothing but
healthy food and exercise because at
some point life would be no longer worth
living.
At a certain point, however, people
cross the line between enjoying life and
killing themselves. I cannot say I know
where the line is, but I do know that cigarettes are on the unhealthy side because
they foster an attitude of low self-worth.
Unless you can convince yourself that the
claims of the FDA are overstated, the
FDA makes cigarettes unhealthy simply
through its massive use of negative advertising. Even ifcigarettes weren't naturally badfor people, their decision to use
cigarettes, and the disposable attitude
towards their bodies that decision entails,
would make cigarettes mental toxins.
Lives are worth more than brief periods of enjoyment. Every life has a real,
spiritual meaning. If that meaning is denied, people's lives become worthless,
which is something quite far beyond my
comprehension, let alone the scope of this
article. By smoking, people are partially
disavowing the value of their lives, one
lungful at a time. Smokers hurt themselves, not to mention hurting those who
care about themand do not like knowing
that someone cares little enough about
life to be eating away at it constantly.
Yes, live a little. Go out and have fun,
lose control, do things that may be mistakes. But do so to enrich yourself, not
bring yourself down.

Ville plans compromise student life, space
By Amy White
For The Phoenix
Like most Swatties, I've done my share
of bitching and moaning about the lack
of life in the Ville. There are too few merchants, and those that are there are too
specialized or overpriced to make it worth
visiting.
So it's ironic that I'm more concerned
than enthusiastic now that the Town Center Task Force has unveiled a proposal for
revitalizing the business district.
Many aspects of the multifaceted plan
seem promising—improved roads and
building facades, an expanded Co-op, etc.
But a major part of the plan potentially
threatens key components of student life
at Swarthmore College.
What concerns me in particular is the
plan to construct a hotel, restaurant, and
College bookstore building complex. Although the Task Force has stressed that
each element of the comprehensive revitalization plan is designed to be implemented independently of any other part,
the editor of The Swarthmorean has referred to the hotel complex as "the linchpin of the entire plan."
Many students have heard at least the
basic facts—that it involves building a 65room hotel, relocating the College bookstore, and a two-tier parking garage in the
business district. Most, however, are not
aware of many details of the plan or their
implications for the campus.
The construction would take place just
west of the train station, on College property. The engineers' drawings of what this
building complex would look like present
an entirely altered picture of the campus
south of the SEPTA track.
Three major aspects of this location are
of direct concern to students. First, parts
of Clothier Fields which include the softball field and parts of the football practice field would be lost. While I have every confidence in the College to ensure
that the loss of space would be compen-

Many aspects of the multifaceted
plan seem promising—improved
roads and building facades, an
expanded Co-op, etc. But a
major part of the plan
potentially threatens key
components of student life at
Swarthmore College.
sated for in some way, it seems clear that
no good alternative location exists for
these fields that is both convenient and
preserves the spaces other sports teams
currently occupy.
The second major loss would be most
or all of the C parking lot for students. A
student parking shortage already exists
on this campus, as evidenced by the approximately 45 students turned down for
on-campus parking permits last week. C
lot currently provides the majority of student spaces. The Task Force report acknowledges the loss of this space, suggesting that it "could be relocated elsewhere within the campus." However, this
seems to face the same problem as the
field space—where? If it were that easy
to simply "relocate" parking space for
students, shouldn't the College have already done so to address the parking
space shortage?

A third factor is aesthetic in nature. As
is clear in the consultants' drawings, the
hotel/restaurant complex would significantly change the landscape at the
College's south entrance. Instead of a
clear view from Chester Road across
ClothierFields and up Magill Walk to Parrish, visitors to the campus would first
face a large structure blocking that view.
In addition, little has been said about
the operation of the hotel. It appears to
be presumed that the College will own and
operate it at least in part, since it is going

on what is now College-owned property.
However, students need more detailed
information about this. To what degree
will the College have ownership and/or
financial responsibility for the inn? How
will the owners deal with the excessive
demand for rooms during times like
graduation and freshman orientation?
Perhaps most importantly, what are the
implications of a "high quality" inn in
terms of cost to patrons? It would be
shameful to see the existence of convenient but high-priced lodging further the
class divide at Swarthmore (and yes,
there is a class divide at Swarthmore) by
allowing only those parents and relatives
who could afford it to stay on campus.
Whatever one's perspective on whether
these changes are good or bad, it is undeniable that the plans as proposed would
significantly affect student life on this
campus. Further, students have not yet
had fully informed input on the planning
process. Since town supporters of the
proposal are pushing for quick action on
approving the plan and beginning the process of implementation, it appears to be
up to the College administration to determine whether and how soon the plan is
put into motion.
I fully support the time and effort the
Task Force has put into revitalizing the
Ville, and I predict that most students will
too. But the College must solicit student
input and use that information to influence the implementation of plans that so
directly affect student life.
My hope is that those centrally involved
in the planning—namely, the College administration, the Task Force, and the Borough Council—will seek extensive input
from students and adapt the plans responsively to our point of view. In exchange, I
hope students now will do all they can to
become informed about the proposal and
its implications for student life, and become involved in the process as it unfolds,
offering opinions and information in constructive ways.

Public's view of journalism dismisses its ideals
By Cliff Hicks
Daily Nebraskan (U. Nebraska)
Nearly daily anymore, as a testament to the
(U-WIRE)
dedication people have to rooting out evil in the world, I am
posed a single, solitary question: "You're joining the media?"
The term media has come to replace journalism much like
ambulance-chaser replaced lawyer and quack replaced doctor.
It's a term lightly sprinkled with abuse and hinting at vile connotations.
After all, people tell me, the media killed Princess Diana, the
media is responsible for the Lewinsky debacle, the mediashoved
the O.J. trial down the throats of unwilling victims.
Hell, you'd think it was the media who crucified Christ, if the
public had its way. Only if we had exclusive coverage, though.
As a strapping young lad, I found myself wandering into the
field of journalism for many reasons, but the single moment
that had me convinced traces back to one little movie.
It was about "Woodstein" and this little story they were working on. "Woodstein" was Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein
(played by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman), and the little
story they were working on brought down President Nixon.
The movie was "All the President's Men." You should watch
it sometime if you think journalists don't do anything worthwhile.
But the public has confused the media with journalism.
Journalists are concerned with bringing the facts to the
people, a deeper search for the truth. The media merely want
your attention so they can get paid.
And the number of people getting into journalism declines
every year.
UNL, which has a very highly ranked journalism school, has
seen enrollment in that school go down.
"I think, apparently, there is less interest in the profession,"
Daryl Frazell, associate professor and chairman of the newseditorial department told me. "As you notice, we don't have as
much faculty."
Frazell's often struck me as a little intimidating, but after
our discussion I think I've come to understand it's just a really
good poker face.
The face of journalism, on the other hand, reveals a great
dealabout the changes of the past 10 years.
And the college has changed with it, not entirely for the better: A smaller enrollment means fewer teachers and fewer
classes offered.
But journalism is going through a paradigm shift, and the
college does have to reflect that, re-evaluating the news-editorial department.
Magazines may be the print medium of the future. Or the
Web could replace paper publications, eventually.
The school must prepare students to compete in the field of
tomorrow. But it also has an obligation to produce responsible
professionals.

GUEST COLUMNIST
Still, no school can do it all, and not even schools can be held
accountable for a regrettable decline of journalistic values.
Shoddy journalism is the public's fault. In many cases, the
public has stopped discriminating between good journalism and
bad journalism.
This lack of support for good journalism means that any ol'
schmuck can walk in and start work in the media. This means
the field isn't drawing the dedicated people it once did.
"The thing that I'm finding that isn't as strong as it once was
is the kind of zeal for this profession that once existed, based
on the idea that journalists are out finding out as much as they
can about the truth and publicizing it for the good of the soci-

Hell, you'd think it was the media who crucified

exclusive coverage, though.
ety," Frazell told me.
"More frequently today, journalists appear to be seen by the

public as intrusive, arrogant and rather useless preying on
society," Frazell said, "and that's highly disturbing to me. But
that image is part of the problem with recruiting students."
Over the past 10 years, I've heard the media described as too
liberal, conservative, intrusive, timid, useless, outdated, unfocused, bull-headed, stubborn and foolish.
When the Lewinsky affair broke, the public saw the media as
"giving it too much attention," such as one person told me. I
retorted, "How should the press ignore the possible impeachment of the president? Just because we don't cover it won't
make it go away."
People want to kill the messengers for the news they don't
want to hear. The distrust of the media springs from people's
distrust of politicians, the court system and the world in general. Society is cynical, and they're blaming the wrong folk.
The truth hurts, babe, and there's no way around it. Good
medicine stings the hardest, and this is a double-barrel blast of
realism whiskey down your throat.
It's going to take efforts on the part of both the journalism
school, the students and the public to get the focus of journalism back to where it needs to be, no matter what the forum.
You need to join the fight.
Stick the needle in your vein. Tell people the truth. Write free

Wilson's 'Moral Intuitions' encourage
conceit, stifling societal solutions
f

PANN NASEEMULLAH

V

*®f|fee

Prof. James Q. Wilson's reputation cer-

tainly preceded his actual arrival on campus last Friday, as he came to address the
first Cooper Foundation lecture on contemporary liberalism. His lecture was en-

titled "Moral Intuitions."

I was going there expecting the "foremost social scientist of" our time" to deliver an address worthy of Max Weber or
Foucault. Instead, I was severely disappointed: I was listening to a talk that introduced fundamentally scary notions of
human nature, especially by extension
and application, without any intellectual
basis whatsoever.
For thosewho missed the Collection last
Friday, Wilson's main argument was that
morality can be evaluated across individuals and cultures, that morality
springs from certain moral "intuitions"
that come from genes and family, and that
certain cultures have superior moral intuitions than others through group evolutionary selectivity. I feel that the idea
of "moral intuitions" can be used to affect a holier-than-thou attitude to all of
the myriad problems we have in human

Wilson's argument is especially ominous for those who do not
share the comforts and freedoms of the "centrist" WASP middleclass America. As a crusty old liberal on campus, I tend to be
suspicious of philosophies that create social self-congratulation in
any way, shape or form.
society, without rolling up shirt-sleeves
and truly working towards solving these
problems. And I think that is fatal, both
in theory and in practice.
While I'm not a social philosopher or a
political theorist, Wilson's ideas scare me.
They imply that morality follows a linear
path, so that every set of moral codes has
a superior and an inferior. I do agree that
a culture that condones infanticide is necessarily less moral than one which provides free primary education. However,
I don't think a communitarian society, like
one envisaged by Islam, is any less moral
than a Western individualistic society.
Canada, which provides universal health
care and highly restricts guns, is certainly
not more immoral than America, according to my left-of-center view of what's
more important. I'm willing to bet that
Wilson would disagree.
This linear view of morality (justice)
was used by Plato in a masterful critique
of human society, but Plato's world was
fairly homogeneous—nearly every Greek
had read Homer and believed in the same
conception of deity. Wilson is not functioning in Plato's world, but in ours.
Wilson's argument is especially ominous for those who do not share the comforts and freedoms of the "centrist"

WASP middle-class America. It was easy
for Wilson to say, for example, that a
higher moral plane would enable us (I can
only assume the U.S.) to intervene in
other countries. Wilson talked about just
wars as being fought for a higher moral
principle. War is often self-justified, but
is war ever just?
Inaction is also an implication of"moral
intuition."Wilson differentiatedbetween
poverty in an unfair system as being immoral but poverty in a "fair" system being moral. But is there ever a fair system? Wilson might say that poverty in
North Philadelphia is moral because these
people have the same opportunities as
anyone else. Uh-huh. The most blatant
example of this complacency is Wilson's
discussion of the Voting Rights Act of
1964. He claimed that since the passage
of the Act, no one complains about racism because the country took a moral
stand and now life is all good. But is that
struggle over and done with?
As a crusty old liberal on campus, I tend
to be suspicious of philosophies that create social self-congratulation in any way,
shape or form. Wilson's talk smacked of
this from beginning to end. Morality does
indeed need to be discussed, but not in
the way the good Professor goes about it.

Students should unite to fight Swat gossip
By Daniel

SWARTHMORE

For The Phoenix

It seems inevitable, inescapable and, to be sure, unrelenting.
It invades our ears at every imaginable junction: Sharpies,
Willets, the IC, even the women's bathrooms (not that I've been
in them). We try not to listen, we try not to let it become a par
of us, but inevitably it sucks us in, like the vortex it is. It's to
juicy, too sweet to keep to ourselves. "If I just told one othe
person," we say—a close friend perhaps—that wouldn'tbe per

motives for this behavioral
pattern, one needs to delve
deep into the abyss of the
human mind (Schneider
would be proud).
While meditatively patting my head and rubbing
my stomach, I begin to formulate an idea: maybe it's
simple talk show withdrawal. Swarthmore students are so inundated with
their work that they can't fit
in time for their Ricki,
Maury, or Montel. Without
that "gossip release," students find the need to exhibit
their innate urges on cam•

pus.

Innate urges—that leads
us to another plausible possibility, and this one doesn't
seem nearly as far-fetched: Swat gossip is a direct response to
"Swat Nature." Due to the extreme intelligence that we Swarthmore students exhibit, we have a primal urge to prove that
our level of social interaction is still on par with that of high
school students. A-ha... this must be the problem!
Now that we have identified a problem, it is time to generate
our solution, or, as I'm inclined to call it, our battle plan. First
need a slogan, a battle cry to rally around. We need something
that represents the cause for which we fight. It's got to have
gumption and some guile too. It's got to scream, NO MORE GOSSIP.
I took a class on advertising once, and the professor emphasized key words, words that make people listen. What word
would make people want to jump at the chance to join our battle

Of course, I've got it! And it also happens to be the one of the
most dynamic words in the English language—Shhh!
(Warning: If you didn't see Austin Powers this next paragraph
won't make sense.)
I knew that one day Dr. Evil would take over the world, or at

least Swarthmore. Now, Austin Powers is going to have to save
Swarthmore from his grasp because his words will help solve
our little gossip problem. After 5 minutes of diligent Swarthmore web surfing, it came to me with a flash, a stroke of Swarthmore genius! (Or, as it happened, stumbling upon the right
page of Dr Evil quotes).
Here is our battle cry as we go to war against gossip:
Shh

If one person, just one person does it and walks away, they
(those that gossip) may think he's really sick and they'll ignore him for the rest of the semester. And if two people do it
in harmony, they'll think they both hit their heads a bit too
hard while diving into the pool for the Swarthmore swimming
test, and they'll ignore the both of them. However, if three
people do it (can you imagine three people singing our battle
cry and walking away?) they may think it's an organization,
and then they'll start to wonder. And if there are 50 Swatties a
day, singing our battle cry and walking away from any potential Swarthmore gossip, they may think it's a movement. And
friends, that's what it is: The Swarthmore College Anti-Gossip Movement.
And all you have to do to join is repeat our battle cry with
feeling the next time you hear gossip coming your way.

MC Shan (that was Snow's DJ, fool) seem
to have the same problem, namely, to
quote the man himself, "5-0 been running

agree wholeheartedly. According to reliable sources, nearly every major party
on campus during this young semester
has been molested, in some way, by the
boys in blue. I have not witnessed this myself of course; my cloistered existence
proves irreconcilable with the party

But I digress. The point is as follows:
the Swarthmore police are becoming
quite diligent in their duty to enforce the
liquor laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. Yet I find it hard to believe
that, in such a well-mannered borough as
Swarthmore, the regular denizens of our
hamlet are themselves responsible for
this desire for increased vigilance. Thus,
I propose that it springs from boredom,
which is not unreasonable. I would imagine that law enforcement personnel are
hard-pressed to find other ways to engage
theirtalents. Thus, in the interests of selfabusers, party-goers, and libertarians like
myself, I respectfully submit the following proposals as to other egregious things
the Swarthmore police would do well to
control, instead of hassle the lovely scholars of my future alma mater.
First, arrest whoever designed the
turn-around under the SEPTA bridge and
then kill whoever decided, having occasion to reconstruct the entire edifice, to
leave it exactly as it was. I am not an engineer. It actually took me a couple tries
to spell the word. I am a patron of the
more genteel arts. Nevertheless, there
just has to be another way to construct
that overpass so that it doesn't take seven
minutes to describe to someone how to
get to the Field House. "OK, go under the
bridge (stop singing the Chili Peppers),
make a left, but I mean a serious left, almost going back the way you came. No..
. Don't turn around. You'll see, you can
make a left and go the way you came but
not be on the same road. No . . No, I
stayed in last night. I'm feeling fine .
OK, then make two lefts and a right..."
This is insane. Move 320 over and build a
ramp up to the south entrance. I will grant
the engineering B.S. to whoever does this,
regardless of class standing. Yes, I have
that kind of power.
Second, arrest the members of the

MAPPING
on

Borough wants to develolop college property
Task farce report recommends building hotel, parking
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff

NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN | Phoenix Staff

The result of months of discussion in the Borough of
Swarthmore, a sweeping new
report recommends significant changes for the business district and college that
include building a 65-room
hotel and relocating the college bookstore into the Ville.
The 22-page report, presented to the Swarthmore
Borough Council last Monday night, posits new development on college property
near the SEPTA train station
as integral to the revitalization of the town's commercial economy.
The report, which is nonbinding, represents the recommendations of a 14-member task force working since
last year. It follows an initial
report, presented in January,
that identified the community goals of improving the
borough's tax base while preserving its small-town flavor.
Now, the new report awaits
further discussion at the Borough Council's October
meeting. "This is what we
believe the community as a
wants,"
whole
James
Hartling of the Urban Partners consulting firm told
Borough Council on Sept. 13,
"and so let us begin action."
Some of the recommendations
like repaving sidewalks
are for the borough
itself, while others require

cooperation from business
owners and the school. But
whether Swarthmore College will agree to the report's

recommendations, or even

all of its goals, is unknown.
The biggest changes recommended in the report are
new development on college
land currently part of the
softballand football practice
fields. The report suggests
building a hotel and parking
garage in that area, in addition to a new building that
could house a restaurant and
the college bookstore.
The task force thought that
the development on college
property was necessary because, as the report notes,
"the reconfiguration and
more efficient use of space
available within the current
business district will provide
only limited opportunity for
growth and revitalization of
the Swarthmore Town Center."
So the task force looked to
"limited" development on
the college property contiguous to the Ville as the only
solution to the lack of space
elsewhere for the proposed
hotel. What the task .force's
report leaves unclear is
whether the college would
sell the land and what financial stake the college would
have in the proposed hotel.

Community and College Relations, the college could

The task force believed the
changes would have minimal
negative effects for the community. "The positioning and
character of this proposed
development is intended to
minimize the intrusiveness
of new development on the
community's open space and
scenic vistas," their report
stated.

Hartling said that each of
the recommendations in the
report
including the development of college property
can be implemented independently of the others and
so the borough should begin
implementing what changes
it can while the college continues to consider the plans.
"Development west of
Chester Road is not necessary for any of the other
changes," Hartling said.
But at least one Swarthmore resident in the audience that night disagreed.
"Yes, it is," she whispered.

OTHER VILLE CHANGES

1. Improving Ville appearance
Repaving streets and repairing sidewalks and pedestrian walkways,
adding a traffic light at Rutgers Avenue and Chester Road, adding a
new cross street connecting with Dartmouth Avenue at the Co-op,
improving the train station, creating more open space at Borough
Hall.
2. Promoting business and development
Reconstructing and expanding the Co-op and possibly including a
coffee house or bakery, expanding the hardware store and restaurants, recruiting new retail businesses, reestablishing a merchants'
association.

3. Protecting residential areas
Leaving zoning unchanged, installing more stop signs, expanding the
residential parking permit program.
4. Encouraging intergenerational activity
Building an assisted living facility for the elderly, improving communication between teenagers and police.

An informal survey revealed widespread
skepticism about aspects of the Ville redevelopment proposal that affect the college.
The proposal, titled the "Swarthmore Town
Center Revitalization Strategy," released last
Monday by the Borough Council, was written after consulting a wide range of Ville residents, including faculty, staff and students
at the college.
But students interviewed expressed concerns about various areas of the project, and
while the general sentiment did not constitute outright disapproval, it appears that a
rubber stamp is definitely out of the question.
Since these suggested improvements will
take place on college property, the Borough
Council needs the college's full cooperation
to actually implement them. The college is
about to begin an extended process of gauging campus opinion on the proposed changes.
The proposal will be tabled at the Board of
Managers meeting this weekend and at the
first College Planning Committee (CPC) next
week; it will be presented to students and faculty separately as well.
But the college is already under pressure
to comply with the plan. The Swarthmorean,
after interviewing Maurice Eldridge, Vice
President for Community and College Relations, who candidly admitted that alternative proposals could arise during the consultation process, fired back with a forceful editorial urging the college to adhere to the proposal.
Most student concerns revolved around the
issue of athletic space. The proposed plan
entails paving over the existing softball and
football practice fields. Several students
pointed out that with the existing shortage
of athletic fields, the current plan would simply aggravate the situation. Replacements
would have to be secured before the project
is approved, they suggested.
"I would like to see themput up their money
[on it]," said Tim Heffernan 'OO. Jen Jarson
'O3 echoed his sentiments. "They would have
to promise to compensate [the loss] with
something equal or better," she said.
Others took issue with the potential aes-

thetic damage that the proposed Inn/restaurant and two-tiered parking lot would cause.

Susan Christensen, a freshman from Lexington, Kentucky, where drab concrete buildings of the University of Kentucky dominate
the skyline, worried about preserving the
small-town atmosphere of Swarthmore. The
new cluster of buildings, she said, would signify a move "towards structures that are
more functional in less aesthetically pleasing ways." Amy White 'OO, in an editorial
published in this issue of The Phoenix, describes how the new structures would obstruct a passerby's view of the main campus.
Mild concerns were voiced about moving
the bookstore to a more remote locationrelative to the main campus, but it did not pose
a big problem for most students.
Most interestingly, the proposal, which has
as one of its goals to better integrate the
College community into the Swarthmore
community-at-large, seems to have failed
miserably in that regard.
Students were extremely defensive about
the potential integration, accusing the Borough of being "presumptuous," for assuming automatic cooperation, tossing around
words like "infringment," and "takeover."
Nate Schaffran 'OO was utterly appalled
by the project. Swarthmore, he said, is the
most "unfriendly college town" he knows of.
"The first time they do anything active," he
complained, "they take away student space,
and turn it into space that students wouldn't
use."
Mary Jean Chun 'OO, in light of recent
"drinking busts" initiated by the Swarthmore police on campus, was worried about
the possiblity the new development would
bring the campus within the police's jurisdiction. If the town is let in, she said, "they
[the police] would definitely maintain some
sort of presence there." Chun was also concerned about the proximity of the proposed
Inn to Olde Club and other party venues.
"Our parties are already not that rowdy," she
said, "but they already complain about our
parties."
Others simply had trouble conceiving of
an integrated college and Ville. "What is
there to integrate with?" wondered Josh
Lindsey 'Ol, "a few houses, a few stores?"

suggested hotel, parking garage and bookstore, on college property on what is now the *C' parking lot and
athletic field.

'Law and Order' a

lean, addictive
television classic
"Law and Order" (NBC, Wednesdays,
10 p.m.) is a show I like a lot. The A&E
channel showsit in reruns, oh, about eight
hundred times a day and when I'm home
on vacation and getting dressed has
ceased to be a big priority, I watch it
pretty often.
For those of you who haven't seen it,
or think it's just a show your parents
watch, every episode every week is a
forty-four minute tour of the New York
judicial system; the first twenty-two minutes focus on the cops investigating the
week's crime, the last half turns to the
district attorneys who prosecute it.
Hence, law and order, although I can
never figure out which is which.
The show has not a scrap of fat on it
and is driven entirely by the demands of
its plot mechanisms. Characters exist for
us only in the line of duty—their personal
lives are relegated to the mere periphery,
revealed only in conversational scraps,
never in whole scenes. In fact, into its
ninth season, the show has survived the
departure of nine cast members, really
almost without notice. "Law and Order"
has the perfection of a well-run relay
race. It is eminently watchable in its
economy, exceptional entirely for its fidelity to formula.
What I like best about the show is that
despite its tabloid timeliness it represents
nothing of the best of nineties television.
Whereas the eighties in primetime saw
the wedding of soap opera methods to
dramatic realism, a la Steven Bochoco,
the best of TV in the nineties —"Twin
Peaks," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "The
Adventures of Peteand Pete," "Seinfeld,"
"The Simpsons," to name a few
has
been distinguished by what Esquire's
media critic Tom Carson calls a "rich vein
of dark fantasy." These shows in theirfinest moments give us America the weird,
the funhouse of the normal.
Even "Homicide"—my vote for the best
police drama since, I don't know, the invention of the television—had an occult
sense of its own subject matter. It introduced to us a squad of Baltimore murder
cops who spoke the hyper-conscious
mouthfuls of stage actors, who were
haunted by the cases they couldn't solve,
who tried to speak for the dead who could
not speak for themselves.
These shows at their worst got all baroque on us; over the top from the get-go,
they had no sense of a balance that needed
to be maintained and the envelope after
all that pushing started to look a little
ragged.
But "Law and Order" is a work horse,
especially when it comes to providing narrative satisfaction. It is a spare to the
point of being skeletal. It is a perfect
thing, whose boldness can be located in
its blueprint and its predictability. It will
not die.
Which is why a spin-off was all but inevitable.
On Monday night, at 9 p.m., "Law and
Order: Special Victims Unit" premiered
and begged the question: can sex crimes
entertain us for an entire hour? In the first
ten minutes of the show, there was a cabbie with his wiener cut off, necrophilia
and a courtroom flasher. The first ten
minutes.
Folks, that's television.
This "Law and Order" incarnation is
still pretty plot-centered but focuses instead almost exclusively on the detectives
of NYPD's sex crimes unit. The cast
boasts Jayne Mansfield's youngest daughter, two alums from HBO's gritty prison

By Hillary Dresser
For The Phoenix
The past ten days in OldCity Philadelphia have been marked
by apparent madness. Throughout the neighborhood, people
have been wandering the streets from building to building,
chattering amongst themselves and darting their eyes manically to the nearest street corner as if they're expecting to
see a ghost.
Why the irrational behavior? Perhaps the last time these
people went to the bathroom, they heard voices and saw colored lights. Perhaps the last street corner they passed was
swarming with street mimes. Perhaps the last time they were
out strolling up Third Street, they were overtaken by four
ghouls driving a car painted with menacing millenium propaganda. There is a phenomenon going on in Old City, and it
is stirring up a madness that's infectious.
The event responsible for this phenomenon is the third annual Philadelphia Fringe Festival, an ongoing celebration of
non-mainstream art and theater. Old City is approaching the
end of an almost two-week long binge of local, national, and
international productions taking place in venues throughout
the neighborhood. In fact, this weekend will be your last
chance to hop the main line to Market East and see the spectacle for yourself.
The Fringe Festival inPhilly owes its birth to a core of three
local organizers, Nick Stuccio, Swatalum Conrad Bender, and
Deborah Block. Philadelphia is one of the most recent additions to a circuit of cities throughout the world that host annual Fringe Festivals.
Stuccio caught the madness when he was at the Fringe Festival in Edinborough, Scotland a few years ago. He was producing a show at the Edinborough Fringe for a Philly performer and was awe-inspired by how massive the festival was
there: "Through the entire month of August, there [were] 1500
shows a day in 150 performance venues." Stuccio brought
the idea back home, solicited the enthusiasm of his friends
Bender and Block, and had the first Fringe Festival in Philly
up and running by September of 1997.
Edinborough was the first city ever to host a Fringe Festival, and the idea has spread all over the world. In the United
States, Fringe Festivals have been organized in New York,
San Francisco, and, most recently, Philadelphia. But "fringe"
is just an adjective, a term coined to mean "alternative," "on
the edge," or "out of the mainstream." No one person or corporation owns the idea, no one person or corporation owns
the rights to the word, and no one claims to be its inventor.
The "Fringe Festival" is simply a structure, which first appeared in Edinborough, that has been adopted by ambitious
folks in various cities, like Stuccio, to organize their own festivals.
Stuccio named two main goals of the Philadelphia Fringe
Festival, "To get young folks...to come out from behind [their]
computers, see live theater, and have a good time...and to give

opportunites to artists who are trying new work and breaking boundaries with more provocative ideas." The program
is packed with experimental theater; most of it costs $lO or
less per show, and much of it is free.
Stuccio, Bender, Block, their staff of about 15 additional
people, and a slew of volunteers have built venues, equipped
already existing venues with improved technology, and
worked with established theaters and galleries in Old City to
bring the Fringe to Philadelphia. The result is an 11-day program of over 100 shows in venues all within walking distance
of each other.
There are three types of acts in the Philadelphia Fringe
Festival program. First, there are artists who submittedtheir
shows to the Philly Fringe ajudication panels. The panels
selected a diverse program of tight, well thought-out shows
and assigned them to venues. "This year," Stuccio said, "the
Fringe got 300 applicants and picked 100 shows." The Philly
Fringe solicits applicants year-round from all over the world
via alternative publications and weeklies, like The City Paper and The Village Voice. The panels are made up of volunteer judges who are involved in the local art scene and reputed for expertise in their fields.
The second group of artists are more widely established
acts whom the Philly Fringe solicits to perform at the festival. Among the curated acts this year have been internationally renowned artisits Danny Hoch, the Doug Elkins Dance
Company, and Koosil-ja Hwang's Dance KUMIKOMOTO.
The last group of artists fall under the "8.Y.0.V." category,
which means "Bring Your Own Venue." These are artists
who approach the Fringe with their own acts in a space that
they've already arranged. The Fringe will thenadvertise and
help sell tickets for their shows.

Though interesting, 'House of Steps' not compelling
By Samira Mehta
For The Phoenix
"House of Steps," Amy Blackmarr's
second book of autobiographical essays,
traces her search for solitude. In the book,
Blackmarr moves from an old family cottage in rural Georgia to a dilapidated
house of steps near the main branch of
the University of Kansas.
Over the course of her first year there,
she mistakes wasp stings for poisonous
spider bites, takes in stray dogs, and
battles the kids who go out at night to
trash mailboxes. She muses about her
three ex-husbands, past holidays that
were spent with friends, and the process
of corrupting her proper southern
mother. Her essays do not form a coherent plot line; instead, they read like a series of essays or journal entries written
along a vaguely chronological thematic
line.
Blackmarr's first book, "Going to
Ground," whichI have not read, was critically acclaimed. For Example, a Washington Post book review said, "Engaging,
musing, and meditative....[This book]
gives us the warmthof Amy Blackmarr's
friends, and the remarkable gift of watching her come to know herself." Perhaps
"Going to Ground" is a considerably better book; however, it certainly exists in
the same form as "House of Steps." They
are both very much like watching an aging hippie play Thoreau. She is charming,
she is flaky, and she is, in many ways,
articulate.
I don't think I would like this woman,

BOOK REVIEW

who seems never to have grown up, even
though I appreciate some of what she has
to say. She seems to be avoiding the world
and I am not sure that there is a message
to her experience. Perhaps there could be,
but she certainly does rot draw it out. For

instance, she calls the book "House of
Steps: Finding the Path Home," but then,
apart from the initial description of a
house in which the rooms are on assorted
different levels, she does not work with
the potential metaphor. Although the
house is the setting for many of her essays, it does not carry a theme and, therefore, does not make sense as the bookis
title.
Blackmarr does have interesting insights and well-written passages. I really
liked her chapter, "Things I Like About
Living Alone," which begins:
"I'm sitting at the chapel window in the
late afternoon on the Sunday after
Valentine's Day, still wearing the blue
long Johns and flannel pajama top I slept
in. I did trade in my red slippers for my
Nikes a few hours ago because I had to
check on the dog food outside, but my
hairis a mess and the cereal bowl is still
in the sink from breakfast and there is a
pot of chili cooling on the stove from supper, which I ate with a raw onion an hour
ago (80)."
She lists the joys of living alone, with
very little description or explanation, because, of course, the point of living alone
is that you donit have to explain yourself
to anyone. However, moments like the living alone chapter do not make up for the
generalmediocrity of the rest of the book.
I don't know whether to tell you to read
this or not. It was a fast and painless read,
and it had its moments. But then again,
they were few and far between. Either
wait for it in papeback, or borrow it from
the library-

Last week, I did something really cool.
I'm not talking take-a-trip-New-York cool. Or beat-therush-to-Pasta-Bar cool. Better.
I got to ride in a golf cart.
You see, two Wednesdays ago, I headed over to the
Arboretum offices to talk to Claire Sawyers, director of
the Scott Arboretum, for an article I was writing on the
plant sale.
As I reached the building, I saw Claire begin to pull
away in her golf cart. I stopped her, re-introduced mself,
and asked if I could clarify some things for the article.
She was on her way up to the rugby field, so she told me
to hop in.

There's no van running between Sharpies and Parrish.
There's no subway system, like in New York or DC. Sure,
I may have a bike, but other people have cars, with motors, that they don't have to peddle. As such, I think I'm
entitled to a small, easy-to-operate shuttle vehicle. (Unfortunately, the Ville kids' skateboards only go downhill.)

Second, the way I see it, Swarthmore could totally afford to give me a golf cart. As students, we're each supposed to pay a studentactivities fee, right? Well, I rarely
take advantage of SAC activities. I'm not a party person, and I'm not a member ofany clubs (although Drama

Board thought so for a while). Okay, fine, I'm president
of the Amateur Radio Club, but none of our members do
anything, anyway.
You see, I went on the web and did a little research.
According to the site <www.genesisny.net/Used.htm>,
"[AJverage electric carts purchased in volume quantity,
that are 3 to 5 years old cost between 1,800 to 3,500 USD."
Well, I'm sure my student activities fee over the course
of five semesters has added up to at least that. And this
being the case, I'm sure if I wanted a cart, Budget Committee Treasurer Josh Bess would allot my funds accordingly. He seems like a nice guy.
Then again, I don't know. It might be a little embarrassing being the only student with a golf cart you
know, rubbing noses with Facilities people and all. Others might get jealous. Also, who knows when they'll finish all the paths down Parrish lawn. I'd hate to take a
wrong turn off a detour one night and wind up face to
face with a gang of Ville Kids ready to rumble after a
pit stop at Sugarplums.
So, maybe walking and biking aren't so bad. It can be
good exercise, after all. And if I ever really needed a
golf cart, I suppose I could call up Claire Sawyers.
She's a mean golf cart driver, you know.

CMJ-topping band to play 'Indo-pop' at Olde Club
By Mara Hvistendah
For The Phoenix

Macha,

an innovative band
nailing from Athens, Georgia,
and currently on top of the College Music Journal
charts, will
come to Swarthmore to play a
show at Olde Club this Friday at
10 p.m.
The group's style could be described as Indo-pop. Their
songs frequently combine

sounds as diverse as a zither,
Indonesian gongs, and a vibraphone.
The Indonesian influence on
the album stems from a shared
interest of songwriter Joshua
McKay and instrumentalist Kai
Riedl. The two have made several trips to Southeast Asia and
have returned each time with
new instruments and ideas to incorporate into their music.
"They play bizarre instru-

ments, but they don't really have
a bizarre sound," said Olde Club
Director Andy Smith 'Ol.
The songs on Macha's selftitledrelease are largely instrumental. The vocals, when they
appear, are sung in an ethereal
drawl. For kids looking to dance,
Saturday's show may disappoint. Macha's music is too hazy
and atmospheric for excessive
motion.
But what Macha lacks in

catchiness, it more than makes

up for in creativity. Or at the
very least, it is a new approach
to something familiar—pop music dressedup with fabulous new
elements. It is hard to explain
what exactly makes a zither so
appealing, but... well, go and see
for yourself.
Army of the Red Museum, a
local band from Philadelphia,
will open with their "Sgt.

Pepper's" Beatles-style pop.

'Fringe' a haven for new artists
From FRINGE, pg. 12
The result is an overall program of quality work. Each day,
for eleven days, there are acts
going on from as early as noon
to 10 p.m. There is a schedule of
events and a map of Old City on
the Philly Fringe website,
www.pafringe.com; there are
also hard copies of the program
available at the Fringe box office
at 113-131 N. 2nd Street in the
National Showroom, which is in
the heart of Old City.
Among the established theaters and galleries in Philadelphia that have been participating in the Fringe Festival are The
Arden Theatre Company, The
Mum Puppettheater, and The
Painted Bride Art Center. All are
great places to check out Fringe
shows and to find out what will
be happening in the Philly art
and theater scene during the rest

of the year. Phil Specter, the publicist at The Painted Bride Art
Center, emphasized that the
Bride, in particular, "presents
Fringe arts all year round we
present emerging artists as a
part of our principal philosophy."
He whole-heartedly praised the
festival: "Long live the Fringe.
People are really feeling it."
The official Fringe program,
though an excellent starting
point, does not adequately capture everything that's going on
in honor of the festival. In conjunction with the Fringe, the already vibrant neighborhood of
Old City, withits great bars, restaurants, and cafes, is packed
with people reveling in the energy of the festival. There are
street performers, wandering
shows, and installment artwork
around every corner, none of
which may have actually a slot
in the program.

Specter articulated his take on
the spirit of the Fringe, "You

something...the Fringe is all
about seeing art take place everywhere you are. It's about
stretching the boundaries of

As Nick Stuccio insisted, the
Fringe is especially trying to
encompass young people. This

Garnet Tide looks for Homecoming victory
Loss at Johns Hopkins leaves players "excited to be back home"
Joe Aleffi 'OO is out for a
little revenge Saturday at
Homecoming against
Gettysburg College.
Last year Swarthmore
mounted a furious secondhalf comeback against the
Bullets, coming from 21
points down to trim the
deficit to eight points with
three minutes left.
The momentum was on
Swarthmore's side. Time,
however, was not.
Gettysburg held out just
long enough last year,
snuffing out Swarthmore's
bid to break its losing
streak, and emerged with
a 28-20 win.

This year Aleffi promises retribution.
"We made a huge comeback last year, and we felt
like we should have taken
that game," said Aleffi, the
Garnet Tide's starting running back. "There is a little
revenge factor —we want
the win this year."
Fresh off a 37-3 thrashing at the hands of Johns
Hopkins last weekend, the
Garnet Tide hope to gain a
measure of revenge and
redemption Saturday
against the Bullets at
Clothier Field at 1:30 p.m.
"We were in the game
last year," football coach
Pete Alvanos said. "We
played them close right to
the very end."

This year the roles may
be reversed, said Alvanos.
"Gettysburg has lost
some tough games this
year against strong opponents," Alvanos said. "We
have more depth and numbers this year, so it should
be an even matchup."
enters
Gettysburg
Saturday's contest smarting from a 44-0 shutout
against Western Maryland
that ran theBullets' record
to 0-3 overall, 0-1 in the
Centennial Conference.
The prospect of avenging last season's loss adds
to the considerable stakes
already on the table for the
Garnet Tide. This weekend
is both Homecoming and
Board of Managers week-

end, and Alvanos expects
another large crowd for
the game.
"A lot of alums will be
coming back for Homecoming, and the Board of
Managers being here puts
extra pressure on the team
to perform," Alvanos
added. "But the kids just
want to go out and play
well."
Swarthmore is aiming to
exploit a Gettysburg defense that is currently giving up 474 yards per game,
and Alvanos said it will not
take any gimmicks to do
that.
"We're going to keep it
simple offensively and
just concentrate on the
basics," Alvanos said.

Defensively, the Garnet
Tide must find a way to
cope with Bullets running
back Paul Smith (105.3
yards per game) as well as
injuries to linebackers
Tucker Zengerle 'OO and
Nick Loiacono 'O3 and defensive end Josh Donovan
'O3. All three were injured
in the loss to Johns
Hopkins.
Aleffi said the coaches
have implemented a new
scheme that has the squad
excited.
"Coach Alvanos installed an excellent game
plan for this week," Aleffi
said. "Our practices were
crisp all week despite the
weather, and we're just
very confident."

meet the

coaches

By Fran Smith
For The Phoenix

Since their first win on
Wednesday, the women's volleyball team is looking stronger
thanever, and the new coaching
staff is part of the reason for
their success.
Head coach Deana Maguire
hails from an intense volleyball
background. She competed at
Elizabethtown College for four
years, where she was the starting setter, captain and MVP for
three consecutive years and AllMid-Atlantic Conference her
senior year.
She has coached three different junior teams, run various
camps and clinics and held the
position of assistant coach at
Eastern College during the '96'97 season.
Although this is her first experience as a head coach at the
collegiate level, she has brought
a volleyball expert into the position of assistant coach—her father. Robert Maguire has been
involved with volleyball for 34
years, both coaching and refereeing at the high school level.
The team has responded to the
dynamism of the Maguire
coaching staff.
"Deana and Mr. Maguire are
great," co-captain Jenny Yang
'OO said. "They are really attentive and caring people who are
really constructive with their
comments."
Returning to help the team out
with additional coaching support
is R.J. Berger 'O2. A vital presence on the men's volleyball
team, Berger is just as essential
to the women's program. Like
the rest of the coaching staff,
Berger comes from an extremely intense volleyball background, both as a player and a
coach. At Swarthmore he
achieved the status of co-captain
and starter for the men's team
and manager/assistant coach for
the women's team his freshmen
year.

Armed with a new coaching
staff, the team's potential is at a
higher level.

Victory at last for volleyball
3-0 win over Washington College ends teams 25-game losing streak

By Fran Smith
For The Phoenix
Last Wednesday the Garnet's 25-game losing streak
came to an abrupt halt as the squad tore into Washington College.
The women came out hungry for a win and full of energy. With the help of an enthusiastic crowd, Swarthmore
defeated the Shorewomen 3-0.
"I felt like we were on the same page from the start,"
co-captain Lily Marsh 'Ol said. "We all came ready to
play as a team. Everyone worked extremely hard for
the win and put in 110%."
Yet the road to the first win in a couple of years was
arduous and disheartening. The Garnet's volleyball season started out with eight straight losses.
With the final team—consisting of seven returning
players and three new ones—determined just three days
before the Haverford Tournament, the squad was still
adjusting to each other, not to mention a new coaching
team.

The Garnet were unable to capture a single game
against opponents Philadelphia University, Goldey
Beacom and St. Mary's of Maryland.
On day two, however, the Garnet looked like a different unit. The women faced arch-rival Haverford, and
although they were unable to clinch the match, they did
win their first two games before falling 3-2.
"[The] Haverford tournament was an incredible learning experience for everyone, and by the end, I felt like
we were a completely different team than when we arrived on Saturday," Christine Hancock 'O2 said.
Swat dropped their home opener 3-1 to Wilmington
College. Despite the win, Swarthmore managed to give
Wilmington a tight match.
Following the intensity that was found for the
Wilmington game, the team took a nose dive when they
traveled to Franklin & Marshall last Wednesday. The
women lost 3-0 and barely put up a fight.
"The right energy wasn't in the air," co-captain Jenny
Yang said. "It was a new away traveling experience, a
short warm-up and a team that immediately outpaced
us with their quick offense in the first game. We couldn't
shake off that anxiety for the rest of the match."
Last Saturday the women hosted their first tri-match
of the season, where they faced Bryn Mawr and
Gettysburg. Hoping for their first win, the women
opened with no spirit against Bryn Mawr and fell 3-0.
Shaking off their disappointment the team set a goal
for the Gettysburg match: "Play with intensity the whole
time." Although the team dropped tha*t match 3-0, the
intensity level was high and they succeeded many times
in taking Gettysburg out of their game.
Despite the grim beginning, the players are very optimistic and excited about the team, especially with the

If the team heeds Chan's advice and plays like they
did on Wednesday, many wins are sure to come.

Garnet Tide overcomes Randolph Macon, Haverford
Swarthmore scores early and
By Lindsay VanSciver
For The Phoenix
There may have been seven
sisters involved in last
weekend's field hockey tournament at Vassar College in New
York, but Swarthmore hockey
made it obvious that there was
only one sister worth beating.
The Garnet Tide played an intense three-game series that
ended in an upset with only 23
seconds to play in the championship game on Sunday afternoon.
It is no mystery that the
Swarthmore hockey team carries with it a legacy of championship teams from the Seven Sisters Tournament each season. In
the last five years of tournament
play, the Garnet Tide has won
four championship titles, and
maintained the runner-up position the fifth year.
Swat hockey is the team to
beat—everyone knows it, but not
many teams can do it.
Swarthmore proved its determination to succeed once again
on Saturday morning's tournament opening victory against
Randolph Macon Women's College. This 6-0 win was a result of
iron-wall defense and an explosive, kamikaze offense that

often to build momentum,

could not stay out of the goal. Besides outshooting Randolph Macon 22-0, the Garnet Tide posted
a 22-1 corner advantage, illustrating their intense desire to
score. Scoring in the first half
were Katie Vivalo 'Ol, off an assist from Kristen English '01;
Ingrid Kaszas 'O3; and English,
who pounded two more in the
goal, one resulting from a penalty stroke.
"Scoring early and often is a
great way to set the momentum
for an incredible game. We definitely came prepared to play,
and it showed," English said.
The Garnet Tide finished
strong with three more goals in
the second half. Scoring for
Swarthmore were Becca Stites
'OO, unassisted; Vivalo with an
assist from Krista Hollis '01; and
Erica Williams 'O2, unassisted.
Swarthmore's next victim was
Haverford. Neck-and-neck the
entire game, it was not until Amy
Dibenedetto 'O2 scored with nine
seconds left in the second half
that the Garnet Tide was able to
seal the 2-1 victory that would
take them to the finals. Also scoring for Swarthmore was Alison
Gaffney 'O2, with an assist from
Hollis.
The defense, led by goalie

but squad's winnings ebb in finals against Wellesley

Jane Kendall 'OO, also posted an
iron-clad effort. Kendall had 11
saves for the game, including a
penalty stroke in the first half.
"This game was one of intense
highs and lows. Amy's goal was
unbelievable; this just goes to
show that when we are under
pressure, we can still come out
on top," Kendall said.
It was not until the next
morining that the Garnet Tide
prepared to take on Wellesley
College in the championship
tournament game. Seeking revenge for last year's second
place finish, it was obvious that
Wellesley was not willing to back
down. Wellesley had the advantage in the circle with 13 corner
opportunities compared to
Swarthmore's 10, and outshot the
Garnet Tide 9-5. Kaszas scored
Swarthmore's lone goal with 18
minutes left in the game, but
Wellesley claimed its thrown
with 23 seconds left in the game
with a goal from a corner possession. Kendall had nine saves,
including a penalty stroke in the
first half.
"I know the team was
dissappointed to lose to
Wellesley in the finals but we
played well all weekend and the
game could have gone either

way," said head coach Karen
Borbee. "The most important
point to take home from Vassar
is our potential as a team. It's a
long season and one early loss
won't hurt us if we keep working hard to improve each game."
Though Swarthmore finished
second in this weekend's tournament play, two players finished
first, making the All-Tournament Team. Kendall and Julie
Finnegan 'OO were selected by

the coaches of the tournament as
two of the finest players of the

weekend.
"It's important to realize that
this team has already left their
legacy at Swarthmore," said
Borbee. "From the seniors to the
first-years, these individuals are
quality student-athletes with so
many talents. There are already
winners no matter what happens—but I know how much they
want to win!"

Another Swarthmore team's losing streak comes to an end

Earthworms break 15-game losing streak with 13-6 win over Haverford
By Matt Murphy
For The Phoenix
The Wait is over; Swarthmore's
Men's Ultimate team made up for
15 games worth of frustration
this past weekend by beating rival Haverford 13-6 in a 6-team
tournament. Revenge and redemption was sweet for the men
after having beenknocked out of
Nationals contention by
Haverford last spring. Said
Brandon Silverman,
sophomore
ah our hard work finally paid
oir.' The streak stopped now, but
certainly not the season, as every
Ultimate team in Pennsylvania,
New Jerseyand Delaware comes
Jo Play this weekend to Lehigh

University.

If you stop by Mertz Field
around 4:30 in the afternoon,
you a probably see
many athletes happily throwing a disc

around. The game is Ultimate,
commonly known as Ultimate
Frisbee, and the players sharing
the field are the male Earthworms
and the female
Warmothers (both anagrams of
"Swarthmore"). And while the
women begin the season looking
to defend their Regional title, the
men are starting this year from
a slightly different position.
Despite having a large number
of experienced seniors last year,
the Earthworms underachieved,
finishing up the spring season at
6-28 and 126th in the nation. They
had a number of excellent players and they had fun during practices, but they had trouble translating that fun and skills into
wins. Every weekend, the team
attended a tournament yet only
once did they returned with a
winning record. By the end of the
season the Earthworms had put

together a 15-game losing streak.
That 15-game period of futil-

ity included Sectionals, the first
step of the National Ultimate
tournament (Sectionals, then
Regionals, followed by Nationals), where they lost a 15-14
nailbiter to Haverford (the win
which
helped
catapult
Haverford into Regionals). In
the following game, the Earthworms proceeded to play down
to the level of a University of
Pittsburgh team made up of 12
students who had played together once all year. One player
did not even have cleats therefore he played barefoot. The
Earthworms
lost their final game of the season, hung their heads, and vowed
that things would get better next
year.

"Next year" began for the
men's team this past Saturday

when they traveled to a tournament at Lehigh University in

Bethlehem, Pa., where they pro-

ceeded to exact revenge on
Haverford and break their losing streak with a dominating 136 victory. They played excellent
team defense, with layouts galore, as well as putting together
a structured offense that systematically
broke
down
Haverford's defense, moving the
disc up the field. They put the
game away from the start and
never let Ford fight their way
back into it.
The streak is over, but the season is far from finished. The
Earthworms come into this season with a swagger as yet unseen
in the last two years of
Swarthmore frisbee. This year's
team is not satisfied with a
simple win over rival Haverford.
They have larger plans for the

upcoming year, entering the season with the mentality that they
will be competitive in every
game, and a belief that they will
win. Ultimate, like any other
sport, is as much a mental game
as it is physical. If a player believes that he will beat his opponent to the disc and get an amazing defensive play, it can propel
him the extra foot past the opponent who is not sure.
This young team is primed and
ready to take on the country one
team at a time. Local rivals
Princeton and Penn will be good
tests for the Earthworms to see
just how far they can go.
Raising the bar for the season,
veteran Vince Pallaver 'OO said,
"this year we will be a team to
be reckoned with." This weekend they will get their chance to
prove it, as the team travels back
to Lehigh for Sectionals.
