Deer cull on hold pending green light from Game Commission
Originally scheduled for winter break, the cull may be postponed as Swarthmore awaits state approval
BY JONATHAN EMONT
jemontl@swarthmore.edu
The deer cull originally scheduled for winter break is
likely to be postponed, as the administration waits for
approval from the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The
administration applied for a permit to hire sharpshooters in mid-November but has not yet heard whether their
permit request will be granted. According to Barry
Bessler, Chief of Staff of the Fairmount Park
Commission, permits from the PGC typically take 30-60
days to process. Jeff Jabco, Co-Chair of the Crum Woods
Stewardship Committee, said, "We thought we'd be farther along at this point. We got approval from the township and borough, but it [the cull] may not happen this
year. We just don't know yet."
It is unclear whether the deer cull will proceed at a
later date. The administration has determined that hiring sharpshooters is the most effective way to lower the
deer population and the PGC has approved similar measures in the Philadelphia Fairmount Park System.
However, Bessler said, "They let us do it because we're
the largest municipality in the commonwealth
No
other municipality in the state has gotten permission to
conduct a cull with sharpshooters." As Chief of Staff of
the Fairmount Park Commission, Bessler has worked
with the PGC, although he has no affiliation with the
...

iting the ability of the forest to regenerate naturally and
is altering the structure and composition of the forest."
Because the deer primarily consume indigenous plant
species, there is concern that without intervention nonnative plant species will come to dominate the Woods.
Bessler said that he was unfamiliar with the specific
situation of the Crum Woods, but said that, to his understanding, the PGC was designed to "provide opportunities for hunters" and is reluctant to allow the use of
sharpshooters. A report issued by the PGC in 2006 concurred, stating: "The Game Commission is directed by
law to use hunting as a method of management for white-

tailed deer."

"We thought we'd be farther along
at this point. We got approval from
the township and borough, but it
[the cull] may not happen this year."

organization.

This information casts doubt on whether the deer
cull, seen by many students as inevitable, will be conducted by sharpshooters as the administration has
planned. Jabco said that he was waiting on the PGC
response. "It's hard to say whether it will be approved.
We really have no experience with this," he said. Asked
whatthe CWSC plans to do if it does not receive a permit,
Jabco said, "We don't have a contingency plan. The one
other option is to do nothing and that's what we've been

doing."
Doing nothing, according to the CWSC, is not a feasible long-term solution. The CWSC commissioned a report
by the Natural Lands Trust and Continental
Conservation that concluded that deer overpopulation
was a severe threat to the health of the Woods.
In a letter e-mailed to The Phoenix, Jabco and Colin
Purrington, professor of biology and Co-Chair of the
CWSC, wrote, "Excessive deer browsing is severely lim-

The CWSC, however, is opposed to using recreational
hunters to regulate the Crum deer population. The CWSC
argued on the Swarthmore Web site that recreational
hunting would be ineffective in the Crum and that "the
majority of the woods falls within safety zones and would
not be huntable without waivers by dozens of adjacent
residences."
In the PGC's report, entitled "A Plan to Reduce DeerHuman Conflicts in Developed Areas," the issue of
approving sharpshooting is addressed. The report says
that in developed areas, "Some non-traditional management approaches may be needed to address the deer
problem
Examples of non-traditional management
techniques include controlled hunting and sharpshooting." For such a technique to be authorized, the community is required to write a deer management plan and
submit it to the PGC. Such a plan was submitted by the
...

CWSC to the PGC in November. According to Jabco,
"The info in the report was an estimate of the deer population and the area it [the proposed cull] will take place
in."
Options for lowering the deer population that don't
involve snapshooting and recreational hunting have
been explored by the CWSC. Once it was determined that
lowering
the deer population was necessary,
Swarthmore College hired Bryon P. Shissler, President of
Natural Resource Consultants, to determine methods of
dealing with the deer problem.
Among the population control strategies that the college eventually rejected were trapping and transferring
deer to other locations, reintroducing predators into the
Woods, utilizing contraceptive techniques and adopting
mitigation techniques which include, among other
things, using fencing and repellent. In his report, however, Shissler concluded that hiring sharpshooters was the
only realistic solution. He wrote, "Sharpshooting in suburban landscapes has been shown to be an effective localized tool for reducing deer populations" and noted that
neither the Food and Drug Administration or the
Environmental Protection Administration has approved
contraceptive techniques.
According to Bessler, the sharp shooting technique
when utilized responsibly is a very effective technique
for eliminating excess deer in environments like the
Crum Woods. When employed in the Fairmount Park
System, which was similarly overpopulated by deer, the
sharpshooting method "was very successful," Bessler 1
-

said.

Although they share a similar ecological problem,
Bessler stressed one significant difference between the
two cases: The Fairmount Park System spans over 4000
acres, whereas the Crum Woods is only 220 acres. "I hesitate to compare the situation in your park to ours,"
Bessler said, noting that the park's vast acreage had to be
taken into account in deciding among a number of potential population control methods. According to Bessler, it
would have been impossible to close down the park to
accommodate recreational hunting, given its size.
Sharpshooters operate in a much smaller area than
recreational hunters, as they use bait to lure deer to
their hideouts. Sharpshooters are also more experienced.
"The whole idea with going with the sharpshooters,"
Jabco said, "is that these people have done it before."

Students travel to School of the Americas protest in Ga.
BY CLARISSA SKINNER

cskinnl@swarthmore.edu

From Nov. 21 through Nov. 24, 20
Swarthmore and Haverford students
attended the annual protest of the School
of the Americas at Ft. Benning in

Columbus, Ga., the site of the SOA. The
trip was organized by Students for a
Democratic Society, but was open to all
students.
According to the SOA Watch Web site
(www.soaw.org), "The School of the
Americas
is a combat training school
for Latin American soldiers." The site
states that the school has trained over
60,000 Latin American soldiers, and says,
"These graduates have consistently used
their skills to wage war against their own
people." The Web site further says,
"Hundreds of documented human rights
violations are connected to soldiers
trained at the Fort Benning-based school."
The first protest of the SOA was organized in 1989 after SOA graduates murdered
six priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter in El Salvador, according to SOA
Watch. Swarthmore students have attended the SOA protest for approximately nine
years. In total, an estimated 20,000 people
...

THE PHOENIX

attended the protest this year.
SDS member Dermot Delude-Dix 'O9
explained the relevance of the SOA problem to the lives of Americans from both
continents. He said, "The issue of the
School of the Americas is a transnational
problem. All the different countries of this
continent are implicated in it
The
protest allows for solidarity with the people affected and puts pressure on our own
government to stop funding it."
This solidarity was expressed by
Majandra Rodriguez 'l2 of Peru. She said,
"Personally, what I really appreciated was
being able to meet activists from the U.S
who dedicate their lives to working with
issues in South America, and to know that
there are Americans who have the same
criticisms as people back homehad about
the U.S government's foreign policies. It's
good to hear that from people who actually have the power to influence the U.S gov...

ernment."
During the protest, the main event is
the funeral procession for those killed by
SOA graduates. Maurice Weeks 'O9, another SDS member, said, "Everyone lines up,
and there's a ceremonial funeral procession with everyone holding white crosses.
At the end, the crosses are laid on the

fence of Ft. Benning."
SDS member Daniel Symonds 11 said,
"During the funeral procession, everyone
chants the names of those who died. For
those two hours, the only thing that is said
are the names of the victims."
Weeks explained the emotional effect of
the protest. He said, "The funeral procession is very emotional and not like any
protest I've been to before. It's somber and
slow-moving."
People across the Americas mourned
with the protesters. According to the SOA

Watch Web site, "There were simultaneous, peaceful protests in Ecuador, Peru, El
Salvador, Paraguay, Colombia, Bolivia,
Chile and Fort Huadhuca, Arizona."
The funeral is one of many events. SDS
member Lauren
Ramanathan
'll
described a puppet show that was put on
during the protest. "There was a giant
puppet that symbolized hegemony and
empire, and there were smaller puppets
that symbolically defeated it. It was a sign
of resistance, but also fun and conclusive.
It was a good contrast to the funeral procession," she said. Ramanathan explained
that the small puppets represented such
small groups as women's enfranchisement
or workers and workers' rights.

December 4, 2008

The protest grounds were just outside
the gate of Ft. Benning, where the school
is located. The setting of the protest
included a stage where various speakers,
including victims and their families,
shared their experiences. Ten minutes
away from the site was a convention center, where two days of programs and workshops were held.
Going to these conventions allowed
groups that are not necessarily related to
the School of the Americas to gather.
Symonds, who attended a Veterans for
Peace workshop, said the protest provides
a space for groups to talk not only about
the SOA, but also about any other issues of
common interest. The result of this was a
summit of many groups. Symonds said in
an e-mail about the workshop that he
attended, "It was more of a meeting of the
(mostly Vietnam) Veterans for Peace
organization, which many members of the
Iraq Veterans Against The War group
attended."
SDS members expressed the hope that
they will not need to attend the protest
next year; instead, they hope that the
school will close down. If not, SDS members anticipate participating in the protest
until the SOA no longer exists.

Senior Mullarkey wins a Rhodes

THIS WEEK IN PICTURES

BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

Caitlin Muilarkey 'O9 was among 32
students from around the country recently named as a Rhodes Scholar. Muilarkey
is the sixth Swattie to receive the honor
since 2000 and only the fifth woman to win
the scholarship in Swarthmore's history.
The Rhodes Scholarship, endowed by
British philanthropist and colonialist
Cecil Rhodes, completely funds a two- or
three-year course of study at the
University of Oxford in England.
According to the Nov. 22 press release
announcing this year's winners, the
scholarship is "the oldest and best known
award for international study, and
arguably the most famous academic

award available to American college graduates."

This year, Swarthmore nominated
four students, three of whom were chosen
as finalists in this district. "We took up
one-fourth of all interview slots in this
district," said Melissa Mandos, the
Fellowships and Prizes Coordinator.
"That speaks volumes to how wonderful
our candidates were this year."
Mullarkey said the initial shock of
winning still hasn't registered. "It's
weird, during the application process
you're so self-absorbed, so I really didn't
take the time to consider how much bigger than me the whole scholarship is,"
Mullarkey said. "The whole experience, it
hasn't really sunk in. I don't think this
will really sink in until I'm actually 3,000
feet in the air on my way to Oxford."
Mullarkey, an honors biology major
with a minor in chemistry, plans on pursuing a master's of science by research in
pathology next year and eventually wants
to work on developing vaccines. "The university system is different at Oxford, but I
want to work in microbiology with an
emphasis on viruses," she said.
Besides presenting herself as a strong
candidate academically, Mullarkey's athletic achievements fit the original archetype of a well-rounded Rhodes Scholar.
Mullarkey is a captain of the women's
soccer team and also holds varsity letters
in basketball and indoor and outdoor
track.
"The Rhodes requires not only aca-

demic excellence, but also a personal
vigor that is most easily interpreted as
athletic excellence," said Biology
Professor

Amy

Vollmer,

one

of

Mullarkey's advisors throughout the
application process. "The emphasis is on
the whole person."
Vollmer first encouraged Mullarkey to
apply for the scholarship last spring after
interacting with her in lab and witnessing
some of her athletic accomplishments.
"During advising last April, I told her that
I really thought she should apply for the
Rhodes and she said, 'really?'," Vollmer
said. "She's really smart and very articulate, yet she has the ability to communicate at all levels. On the athletic field she's
not just skilled, she's also a leader. She
engenders a natural respect from her
peers."
After working on her application this
past summer in the midst of conducting
research for her biology thesis, Mullarkey
said she assembled her final application
and progressed through the two rounds of

elimination this fall.
"You have to submit your application
to Swarthmore and be endorsed by the
school. They say thatweeds out abouthalf
of the applicants, since about 1,500 students submit an application but only

December 4, 2008

about 700 and change go on," Mullarkey
said. "I wasn't confident I'd make it out of
the school's internal process because
Swatties are tremendously impressive,
and I know a lot of people here who would
be a good fit for the Rhodes Scholarship."
After securing Swarthmore's endorsement, select candidates are chosen to
interview at the regional level. The
regional interview for District 4, which
includes Delaware and Pennsylvania, featured a cocktail party at Haverford
College followed by interviews the next
day.

"The cocktail party was just an informal way to meet the judges and contestants," Mullarkey said. "Then you pick
interview spots, and after your interview
they bring all the finalists together and
you just have to wait there while the
judges deliberate."
Mullarkey said that past Swatties who
were chosen as Rhodes Scholars helped
her prepare for the interview process.
"Rebecca Brubaker 'O6 was helpful and
she gave spot-on descriptions of the panelists, which put me at ease," Mullarkey
said. "Tafadzwa Muguwe 'O5 was helpful
because he told me to focus on myself and
my goals rather than preparing for tricky
current event or science questions that
would trip me up."
After all interviews were conducted,
Mullarkey said deliberations went on for
nearly three hours as the finalists waited
in anticipation.
"Everyone's heart was jumping," she
said. "The chair gave this long speech and
everyone was chomping at the bit, then
she just listed the winners. Since it was in
alphabetical order by district, my name
was read first and I was just in shock. I
was just standing there, and one of the
judges was like, 'You can smile now'."
Instead of calling her parents,
Mullarkey drove home to Delaware to
deliver the news in person. "I tried to look
really disappointed and shake my head
and pretend I didn't get it," she said. "My
mom knows me too well though, and she
knew I wouldn't have driven all the way
home to say I didn't get it. She flipped out
and started calling everyone in
and Delaware
and the
Wilmington
East Coast."
Since the announcement nearly two
weeks ago, Mullarkey said many members of the press have contacted her about
her award. "I think I did like five interviews in three days, one with Associated
Press, one with the Inquirer, and a few
with local papers and the Catholic paper
from my home town," she said. "They told
me to expect that. It's nice, but at the same
time when I went home for Thanksgiving
break I was exhausted."
Mandos said many members of the
campus community have expressed
excitement over Mullarkey's recent
award. "It's exciting. There was great
buzz about it on campus the next day," she
said. "It feels really good to have one of
our students acknowledged in this way
because the competition is really high
withthe Rhodes. Lots of large institutions
do traditionally well, so when smaller
schools like ours can compete at the same
level it feels really good."
Vollmer said that while Mullarkey had
many supporters, she ultimately worked
hard to earn the scholarship herself. "I
feel like she's the person running the
marathon and I'm one of the people on the
sidelines handing the runner a cup of
water. That's all I did. That's what we do,"
she said. "We don't create Rhodes
Scholars here. They make themselves."

More than 50 students, faculty and staff turned out for
the Swarthmore Womyn of Color Collective's first luncheon at Bond Hall on Friday, Nov. 2L The luncheon was
themed around women ofcolor who serve as role models.
The guests picked such women as Michelle Obama, Maya
Angelou, Kimiko Hahn, Gloria Anzaldua, Yuri
Kochiyama and the mothers of SWOCC members, whose
photos served as table centerpieces. Across the walls
were pictures of other famous women of color, and playing on a laptop at the front of the room was a slideshow
of the members of SWOCC with women of color in their
families.
The luncheon kicked off with self-introductions and a
small presentation by the executive board of SWOCC
about the organization's presence on campus. The presentation included the reading of a poem written by a
SWOCC member and an explanation of why the group
spells "womyn" with a "y"
"[The luncheon's] purpose was to get womyn of color
students and faculty to become familiar with each other
and to provide a comfortable setting to build networks,"
Stephanie Rodriguez 'l2 said.
In addition, Sable Mensah 'll noted the opportunity it
gave those attending to foster their relationships with
women of different class years. "Planning this luncheon
with these other womyn proved to be a great way to scaffold the freshwomyn's learning of what it takes to plan
successful events at Swat. I also think it was a great way
to get to know the incoming class. The planning style of
this luncheon really speaks to the purpose of this group
to support womyn of color within the camon campus
pus community in ways that help them flourish and succeed on campus and beyond," she said.
The luncheon also gave faculty on campus an opportunity to express their views about being women of color,
both on campus and in the world.
"As a scholar of social inequality and identity, I'm
always thinking about the multiple statuses that we
have, some dominant group, some subaltern all dependent on the context. Being self-reflective about my own
statuses, therefore, is not a big leap. Although women of
color are the majority of the world's population, most
struggle to have their voices heard, their productivity
acknowledged, their physical selves cared for, and their
desires taken seriously," Professor Sarah Willie,
Associate Professor of Sociology, said.
"As a woman of color with many privileges and as a
scholar, I feel a particular onus to investigate and reveal
these inequities and to work for more genuine democratic inclusion at every level of social organization from
the intimate couple to the college campus, and from
nation-state to the multinational corporation," she said.

Students and faculty women of color build bridges at the Swarthmore Womyn of Color Collective's first luncheon.
The group has been well received by the College and has
gotten much encouragement from faculty, both for the
luncheon and the development of the group. "We got fantastic institutional support from Dean Henry and the
Gender Education Office. She was incredibly helpful
throughout the planning of this luncheon and throughout [our] formation," Cecilia Marquez 'll said.
SWOCC formed this year with the initiative of providing a space conducive to communication and education for women ofcolor on campus. It holds weekly meetings in which the group talks about everything from
prejudice and bias to sex and relationships to hair and
beauty.

While all of the women come to the group with different experiences and backgrounds, the common link
between them is that they have a goal of empowering
women of color. "Being a woman of color means that I
have a very unique and amazing perspective on the

(

world. SWOCC lets me explore this perspective in a critical way with other WOC," Sylvia Boateng 'll said.
For Rodriguez, being a woman of color "means defying many obstacles and barriers developed because of my
gender and race. Most importantly, it is relearning and
reinventing social structures to help others see my perception of the world," she said.
Next semester, SWOCC is sponsoring the Grassroots
Organizing Weekend, a conference and training program
in January for college students active on their campuses.
"It is not women of color specific, but is incredibly relevant to [us]," Marquez said. "Women of color really act as
the backbone of a lot of this campus. We help organize
much of the groups and activities It is important that
we are given the leadership training and skills to run the
groups and projects we are involved in."
Earlier this year, SWOCC sponsored the Reproductive
Justice Panel, which more than 80 people attended.

Nutrition addressed in Chester YWRC workshops
BY KEVIN BENTLEY

kbentlel@swarthmore.edu

The Young Women Resource Center of
Chester YWCA has hosted a nutrition
workshop entitled "Tasty Tuesdays" since
the beginning of June. The workshop is
"part of series of programs offered by the
center addressing issues including financial literacy, resume-building skills, and
computer fluency.
Kylah Field 'O9 established the Young
Women's Resource Center, the first of its
kind in Chester, in the Chester YWCA on a
Lang Opportunity Scholarship and further
funded by a Swat Foundation grant. The
YWRC opened in May 2007.
Chester's YWCA puts to use the expertise of Joan McMenamin, a nutritionist at
in
Pennsylvania
State University
Springfield, to teach residents inexpensive
ways to bring healthy meals to the table.
The workshop falls under the umbrella of
the Expanded Food and Nutrition
Education Program, a state-funded initiative started by the Department of
Agriculture. The purpose of the EFNEP is
to improve the overall nutritional well-

THE PHOENIX

being of low-income areas through education. Thanks to the efforts ofField and Tara

Jones, the Executive Director of the
Chester YWCA, these workshops have
brought to the forefront the issue of nutrition in Chester and similar areas.
When Field, Jones and other members of
the Chester community came together to
talk about workshop ideas, they felt that
nutrition was something that needed to be
addressed. "Having this program is so
important because there are so many issues
in Chester alone," Jones said. During the
sessions, there is an emphasis on providing
inexpensive yet healthy meals that could
possibly be used for large groups of people.
"In this type of economy, we are learning
how to cook and eat healthy on a budget,"
Field said. "To buy everything costs $lO or
under and feeds many people." Also, the
workshop makes an effort to bring out the
nutritional possibilities in common, yet
unhealthy, dishes. For example, in past
workshop, attendees have made tuna burgers, used cottage cheese in lasagna, and
made corn flake baked chicken nuggets.
"You find that stuff that you never thought
aboutbefore are really good in the most odd

places, like salsa" says Field.
Nutritional information presented at the
"Tasty Tuesdays" workshops has been beneficial for the Chester community, but it
calls into the question the importance of
nutrition in urban areas, where the debate
is growing on both sides. One common concern is that, in urban areas Where there is a
dearth of adequate grocery stores, nutritional needs are not met. Opponents of the
movement tend to dismiss such statements
as generalizations.

Mark
Wallace
of
Professor
Swarthmore's Religion department, who
was heavily involved in the formation of
the Chester Co-Op, believes that the
absence of a grocery store is a fundamental
public health issue in Chester. "The nutritional crisis is endemic to urban areas,"
Wallace said. He believes that due to the
vast consumption of processed foods sold
by corner stores, communities like Chester
have higher incidences of malnutrition,
diabetes and obesity. "These corner bodegas, which are horrors, have no food,"
Wallace said. "People buy food [there] when
they want to feel full." Wallace believes that
places such as Chester sufferfrom what he

calls 'affluenza" which occurs in first-world
countries where people have the income to
purchase food, but no secure means of
acquiring it. "Without food security for
healthy choices comes obesity and Type 2
diabetes," he said.
While many agree with Professor
Wallace's viewpoint about the nutritional
issues in Chester, some who have attended
the workshops argue that the nutritional
crisis is not something unique to urban
areas like Chester, nor restricted to communities without access to proper grocery
stores. Rather, they believe that poor nutrition is becoming a facet of American culture. "I don't think that the public health
crisis in America can be pinpointed to one
single factor like access to a grocery store,"
Aubrielle Houston 'O9, who has attended
the nutrition workshops, said. Houston
feels that the lack of access should not be
viewed exclusively as a public health issue,
but also as a social issue. "If you look at
most public health issues such as lack of
access to fresh, quality food or lack of
access to healthcare, the people most affected by these issues are people from lower
socioeconomic classes," Houston said.

Administration addresses financial aid at open forum
Swarthmore Financial Justice campaign sees response to student concerns from Al Bloom, Jim Bock, and others
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edu

On Tuesday, Nov. 25, President Al Bloom, Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid Jim Bock and other members of the administration hosted a forum on Financial
Aid. Approximately 30 students attended the event,
which took place a few weeks after the student group
Swarthmore Financial Justice launched a well-publicized
campaign critiquing the administration's current aid
policies.

President Bloom started the event by giving a brief
history of financial aid in the American higher education
system, emphasizing that its slow but steady progress has
gradually made education more accessible to larger parts
of society, while admitting that there is still work to be
done. Bloom cited Swarthmore's ability to implement a
need-blind admissions process and its recent abolition of
the loan component of financial aid as major milestones.
Just prior to this introduction, Bloom reminded the 20
students present in the lecture hall to take advantage of
the coffee and doughnuts available at the back of the
room in the hope that, by alerting all attendees to the
presence of these refreshments, they would be shared
equitably. According to Bloom, this same emphasis on an

equitable division of resources is a prominent feature of
Swarthmore's aid policy which allocates approximately
$2O million in financial aid each year.
Calling the situation of students who cannot return to
Swarthmore because of difficulties with their financial
aid "heartwrenching," Bloom emphasized the college's
dedication to fairness in the aid process. Explaining that
the need of all families is calculated according to the
same principles, he said that it would not be an equitable
distribution of resources to give some families more aid
than the College's criteria called for because those families felt that they were unable to pay their calculated
parental contribution. Bloom was referring to the handful of students who are unable to return to Swarthmore
each year because of financial difficulties, several of
whom have openly shared their stories over the course of
Swarthmore Financial Justice's campaign.
According to Asher Sered 'll, a member of
Swarthmore Financial Justice, the group's objective is to
convince the administration to revise four key components of its financial aid policy. The first of these changes
would increase the length of time that families have to
consider their aid packages, making sure that all families
have their decisions sent to them by early summer; the
second would increase the transparency of the process,
making sure that fam. ilies
know exactly
how all of their information is factored in
to their decisions; the
third would give the

At this point, Laura Talbot, Director of Financial Aid,
emphasized that anyone who has concerns with his or
her financial aid situation can talk with an aid officer,
either in person, over the phone or by e-mail.
Contradicting the claims of Swarthmore Financial
Justice, Bloom said that scholarship money is split
between the students who earned the scholarships and
the College, though he did not give specifics on how or in
what circumstances that money is shared.
Addressing the issue of transparency, Bloom said that
the formula that many colleges, including Swarthmore,
use to calculate financial aid is available for inspection.
Sered pointed out, however, that while the general formula is available, Swarthmore advertises that they take
many other factors into consideration, and the College
does not explain exactly how these other factors are
included in a financial aid decision.
Regarding the panel itself, Candice Nguyen 'll, a member of Swarthmore Financial Justice who did not speak
on behalfof the organization, said there was "a real interest in increasing dialogue between the school and the student body." She viewed the panel discussion as a positive
step, saying that she would "love to see the administration host more panels" because "the more students get a
chance to speak out, the more the campus learns" about
the financial aid process and the concerns of students.

In his remarks, Bloom addressed these concerns.

Regarding the time that families have to consider their
aid packages, Bloom said that all families receive their

later in the summer and said an effort would be made to
ensure it does not happen again.
With regards to the appeals process, Bloom reiterated
that the formula used to calculate financial aid awards is
qualitative, so an appealed decision rarely comes back

Controversial activist promotes vegetarianism, peace
BY DYLON CHOW

dchowl@swarthmore.edu

Can vegetarianism reduce the likelihood
of war? Since 1980, Food Not Bombs has been
arguing that it can. One of the organization's
co-founders, Keith McHenry, gave a lecture
on Tuesday, Nov. 25, focusing on the history
of Food Not Bombs and its major goals: supporting vegetarianism and redirecting military expenses to providing food. Food Not
Bombs was founded upon the beliefthat conditions of scarcity impede cooperation
among different groups competing for a
share offinite resources. Promoting the consumption of vegetarian food, which is less
resource-intensive than meat products, is
one way to address the problem of scarcity.
Food Not Bombs maintains the philosophy
that an abundance of food simultaneously
nourishes anti-war activists and reduces the
overall likelihood of conflict among groups
with insufficient resources.
Unlike charities that give food to specific
groups, such as low-income families or the
homeless, Food Not Bombs aims to provide
food to anyone who stops by one of the organization's distribution booths. Emphasizing
the need for coalition-building among differ-

McHenry and seven friends founded Food
Not Bombs in Cambridge, Mass. Since its
early days, the organization has been guided
by the simple philosophy that nobody

should be without food. Food Not Bombs
quickly gained momentum on the East
Coast and its organizers began to spread
their message to other regions of the country.

Eight years after founding Food Not
Bombs, McHenry moved to San Francisco to
launch a Food Not Bombs chapter there. His
organizing efforts prompted an unexpectedly harsh response from the city's government. Several volunteers were arrested for
distributing food on the grounds that they
had not obtained appropriate permits.
According to McHenry, the city's police
force selectively targeted the Food Not
Bombs volunteers because of the organization's vocal opposition to the federal government's military spending. Since then,
McHenry has been arrested over a hundred
times and was sentenced to twenty-five
years to life under the California "Three
Strikes" law.
The charges were dropped, however,
after international protests generated
intense public scrutiny of the high profile

is its non-hierarchical structure. "I think it's
key that we not be oriented around a personality," McHenry said. Social activists
around the world are free to start their own
groups without requesting consent from
McHenry or any of the original founders.
The organization's website offers an elaborate manual for activists interested in
launching their own chapters.
With the changing political climate and
the impending inauguration of presidentelect Barack Obama, McHenry and other
Food Not Bombs activists anticipate hard
times for progressive movements in the
coming years but also an opportunity to see
their policy recommendations implemented
by the country's political leaders.
According to McHenry, Food Not Bombs
is competing with countless other interest
groups to make its cause a budgetary priority for the incoming administration. "Now,
Obama couldmake a few less cruise missiles

but [all the money] could go toward education, literacy and health care," McHenry

said.

Particularly now, McHenry sees a need

for more popular participation

in social and

political activism. "It's so rewarding. At this
time in history it's so important in a changing society, with increased hunger and with
increased military, that many people get
involved," he said.
Some students are considering launching
a Food Not Bombs chapter at Swarthmore.
Claudia Seixas 'lO, who helped to organize
the event, said that she shares the organization's values. "I think it would be a good idea
to start a Food Not Bombs group at

Swarthmore," she said.
Kaitlin Smith 10 said she is interested in
working with a local Food Not Bombs
branch in west Philadelphia. "Food Not
Bombs demonstrates that the food scarcity
myth is misleading, and that this food
scarcity problem is about the distribution of
food and wealth. It's ultimately about profit
[of corporations]," she said.

STAND urges abstention from luxuries in anti-genocide campaign
BY MICHAEL GLUK
mglukl@swarthmore.edu
This week, SwatSTAND, the
Swarthmore chapter of STAND, A
Student Anti-Genocide Coalition,
has
been encouraging the
Swarthmore community to participate in a nation-wide STAND
fast to raise money for and awareness about genocide. "We are asking that for a period of time, be it
for one day or for the entire week,
students give up one luxury item
and donate the money they would
have spent toward that item,"
Neena Cherayil 'll, an officer of
SwatSTAND, said. Also, in an initiative unique to Swarthmore,
SwatSTAND is collaborating with
the local co-op in a further effort
to raise funds. For the next three
weeks, students have the option
of donating their ten percent coop student discount to the cause.
STAND is the student-led division of the Genocide Intervention
THE PHOENIX

Network, an anti-genocide organization that originated at

Swarthmore College.
All proceeds raised during
this national period of fund-raising will go directly toward civilian protection efforts in Burma
and Darfur, where peaceful civilians and refugees are under
attack from armed forces.
Money allocated for Darfur
civilian protection will help fund
armed escorts for women in
refugee camps, who run the risk
of rape, kidnap and murder by
hostile forces when they venture
beyond the camps' secured
perimeters to collect firewood
and water. In Burma, villages and
communities ofmonks peacefully
protesting the current military
regime come under frequent
attack from government forces.
The raised funds will be used to
buy protective equipment for the
monks. "[lt's] essentially a warning system of radios and anten-

So
much of the

other students have been making

this week. According to Walters,
she has chosen to "substitute

culminate in a $10.50 donation by
the week's conclusion.
Not only does the weeklong

At the end of STANDFast,
Swat STAND will give a dinnertime presentation in Sharpies. By
then, the new SwatSTAND tshirts will have arrived, Cherayil
said in an e-mail, and the group
will be selling them for $lO each.
All proceeds will go to GI Net's
civilian protection program.
According to Cherayil, each
such fundraiser, event and meeting helps promote awareness of
current conflicts and of the
STAND organization. "We used to
be called Swat Sudan, and our
focus was mainly on Darfur.
...

Through this event and its dual
focus on Darfur and Burma,
STAND hopes to put our name
out there and rebrand ourselves.
"We want to become a broader
anti-genocide coalition with a
global focus instead of a narrow
one. As a chapter, we're trying to
reestablish ourselves," she said.

This year, Swarthmore has
become one of the most active
organizational hubs for the
national campaign.
Nicholas Gaw 'O9 is the student leader of the national organization. Gaw and other students
on campus are working intensively to promote STAND'S
efforts at Swarthmore and across
the country. Cherayil emphasized
the need for student participation
on a campus known for its vigorous advocacy campaigns. "I hope
help
everyone
can
that
Swarthmore live up to its reputation as an activist school,"
Cherayil said.

Economic downswing hits college newspapers
BY MELISSA LOEWINGER

THE DAILY PRINCETON lAN (PRINCETON U.)

(U-WIRE)
Students at UC Berkeley hope nothing too
important happens on Tuesdays. In light of the economic
downturn, The Daily Californian has nixed its Wednesday
print edition for the time being.
"It was an emergency measure so we have enough money
to function throughout the year," Daily Californian editorin-chief and president Bryan Thomas said. "We got hit hard
this year. We had to take some drastic measures."
Newspapers throughout the country are seeing declines
in their print advertising revenue by an average of 16 percent in the second quarter of this year, according to the
Newspaper Association ofAmerica. College newspapers are
not immune from the industry-wide phenomenon.
The Columbia Spectator has seen a decline in advertising
revenue of roughly 10 percent so far this year, advertising
manager Dan Smullyan said. Daily Pennsylvanian business
manager Alexander Raksin noted that the biggest decline in
revenue has come this semester, "with the bottom dropping
out of the economy." As the economy hurts companies that
target college students as consumers, national advertisers
looking to cut costs have started withholding their business,
said Stacia Campbell, general manager of Students
Publishing Co., which oversees The Daily Northwestern.
Financial, consulting and other firms that traditionally
recruit on college campuses have dried up as a source of revenue as they cut or even eliminate recruiting. Consequently,
advertising revenue for college papers continues to decline.
"Last year, a large portion of our ads came from recruiting firms," Daily Princetonian business manager Yao Wang
'O9 said. "We're not getting as much from the big banks and
consulting companies. We're hit very hard by that."
Companies commit to hosting an information session for
interested students roughly a year in advance but make
advertising decisions only a few months prior to the session,
Wang explained. As a result, even firms thatdo come to col-

lege campuses don't necessarily buy advertisements in the way." Other papers are not as fortunate. The Daily

NEWS IN BRIEF
Good Food Project pioneers use of composting bins for Kohlberg
This week, the Good Food Project is introducing compost bins to the Kohlberg coffee bar.
The coffee cups provided by Dining Services
are all compostable, but until this project, the
cups have been disposed of as regular trash.
The effort is designed to justify the Dining
Services' investment in compostable cups, and
Good Food Project Compost Co-Coordinator,
Jesse Marshall 11 said, "We're hoping to develop a certain level of consciousness about com-

posting and sustainability in general."
Students will be asked to toss their empty
cups into the compost bins. Cup lids and
straws are not compostable and will be disposed of normally. According to Marshall, The
GoodFood Project hopes to expand the effort to

the Science Center and Essie Mae's, which uses
compostable plates. Compostable cups and
plates are not biodegradable, and last just as
long in landfills as their non-compostable counterparts. "Right now," Marshall said, having
compostable cups is "giving people a false
sense of virtue."
Compost heaps benefit the environment in a
number of ways. They lessen the amount of
waste poured into landfills and provide nutrient-rich soil that can be used for agriculture.
The GoodFood Project's composting efforts are
also relatively cost-effective, as the College will
be using a compost heap that is maintained by
the Arboretum, which provides an industrial
compost heap, with the regulated temperature
and humidity that will allow the cups to

degrade.
According to students working on the Good
Food Project, one of the overarching goals of
the organization is to further student involvement in campus sustainability efforts. Last

year, the Good Food Project attempted to introduce composting to the Sharpies Dining Hall,
but students didn't separate their discarded

food properly, and the attempt was abandoned.
This year, the Good Food Project is hoping to
introduce composting on a smaller scale, and
organi2ers hope that students will become
more active in the efforts. Jim Marzluff 'O9
said, "Currently, we have about eight paid compost workers." The Project is working to
employ many more on some of their other projects.

These other projects are varied, and extend
from working with Dining Services to introduce more locally grown food into the menu to
putting worm bins in resident halls. This last
effort would provide small, local compost
heaps for biodegradable foods, but, Marshall
said, "It probably isn't viable." The Project is
also working on maintaining its garden,
recently relocated to the corner of Cedar and
Elm Streets.
The soil produced by student compost will
be used to plant crops in the communal gardens. Marshall said, "In that way, it's a cycle.
That's kind of the beauty of it... I think it's a
smart thing to be doing." Students have been
assigned a golf cart by the administration to
carry the waste to the compost heap and they
will likely use it to transport the soil as well.
Jeffrey Jabco, Director of Grounds and
Coordinator of Horticulture for the Scott
Arboretum, said, "The program has evolved.
It's changed how it has functioned. The gardens look fabulous this year. I think the Good
Food Project did a really nice job."

'Nights of Scenes' showcases theater students' distinct visions
BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu

A winding night offast cars, the fiery underworld and
slippery psychology promises to rescue students from the
doldrums of reading week as this semester's "Nights of
Scenes," the culminating project for students enrolled in
Directing I, will present selections from Sarah Ruhl's
"Eurydice," Ara Watson's "Final Placement" and David
Rodriguez's "I'm Not Stupid," as well as Matt Pelfrey's
"Drive Angry." According to Assistant Professor
Dan
Elizabeth Stevens, the three students in her class
Hodson 'O9, Noah Lang 'lO and Christopher Compton 'O9
approached this project with very different styles.
"They are three really different guys and all along
they've exhibited very different tastes," Stevens said.
Hodson, the playwright of the group, wove together
two different texts, "Final Placement" and "I'm Not
Stupid," both dealing with social workers worrying about
child-abuse cases, into what Stevens describes as a very
naturalistic piece. He focuses on the relationship between
the doctor and the parents of the children and how complex and stressful that relationship can be. "It's a pretty
psychological play about the field of psychology, but also
about those characters in particular," Stevens said.
Lang, a Film and Media Studies major, draws on his
film background for this theater production while keeping in mind the differences between the forms. "My
...

knowledge of mise en scene such as lighting, set design,
etc., has made the transition a lot smoother, but I'm still
learning to not rely on techniques of character development and physical action that work in film but are too
subtle for the stage," Lang explained. He will present a 13
or 14-minuteplay, "Drive Angry," telling the story of two
young men at odds with the system around them, who
drive through L.A. traffic.
"I chose Pelfrey's play because I think he develops a
strong sense of distinctly separated worlds; the world
within the car, where they have some degree of control,
and the outside world which they hold in great contempt," Lang said.
The piece takes place entirely in a car and Lang struggled with displaying this onstage. "My primary intention
has been to create a conflicted relationship between the
two protagonists who are in a lot of ways together out of
circumstance or even some kind of misguided necessity.
Otherwise I have tried to develop a strange push and pull
for power between these characters," he added.
The play was written in 1999, though as far as Lang is
concerned, it could have been tomorrow Lang sees the
representation of disillusioned young people in Pelfrey's
play as universal and timeless. "These characters are
well-spoken, interesting and grossly misguided in a lot of
ways but that's not entirely their fault. They've both been
failed by what they expected from life and are taking tangible action. They definitely drive angry but they drive

with a purpose, regardless of how off base it may seem,"
Lang said.
Compton chose a longer segment, taking selections
from "Eurydice," a play that re-explores the myth of
Orpheus from the point of view of his wife. Compton
focuses on Act 11, when Eurydice is dead until Orpheus
knocks on the gates of hell, choosing essentially to represent her time in the underworld.
Compton describes the piece as very sad and lyrical as
well as patient. "It's a very patient play and needs to take
its time. So there are a lot of characters on stage just living and being in this place," Compton said. His piece lasts
about 45 minutes, whereas Hodson's, like Lang's, is about
15 minutes long. "I think the play itself, what we're working from is really beautiful and very poetic and touching
and I hope that me and my actors have helped to enhance
that and make it something that you could go to and be
entertained and walk away feeling something," Compton
said.
The class is working in tandem with the Light and
Design class for their joint final projects, focusing on
lighting and directing their actors. "They're really working on getting strong, interesting performances out of
actors and working with light in a way that really effectively showcases their pieces," Stevens said.

Bishop Allen's warm power pop charms Olde Club

dschmitl@swarthmore.edu
The stone-lined insides of Olde Club

sparked alive two weeks ago with the
vibrantly catchy sounds of Bishop Allen, the
Brooklyn-based indie pop band whose music
is infectious, youthful and intimately warm.
Citing The Beatles, The Kinks and The
Zombies as major influences, Bishop Allen
values the beauty of well-crafted pop songs

The success of the show came as no surprise to those in charge of its coordination.
"Bishop Allen delivered the goods, as expected," Olde Club Booking Director Charlie

long-time fans and newcomers to dance
along with him. "Dancing to Bishop Allen, I
was having the time of my life," Molly Siegel
'l2 said. "I had only heard one song by
Bishop Allen before, but I instantly loved
them in concert." During the encore, Kate
Dollenmayer emerged from behindher xylophone and took to the microphone, charming all with the darling and whimsical song
"Butterfly Nets."
A band that thrives on the camaraderie
between its two core, founding members,
Bishop Allen take their name from the street
on which Rice and leading guitarist
Christian Rudder used to live. "We lived

9

together there with a lot ofother guys, and it
was really fun," Rice said. "We actually
named the band after we moved out, in
honor of that place." As undergrads, Rudder
and Rice attended Harvard together, where
the dynamic duo spun records as disc jockeys at the university's radio station.
"Christian and I were friends for a long
time. We both worked at the radio station
and had a radio show together," Rice said,
explaining the band's beginnings. "And we
were actually in a band together called The
Pissed Officers, which was like a really fast
punk rock band
we played 17 songs in

seven minutes."

Branching away from their punk roots
and joining up with a rotating cast of collaborators, Rice and Rudder started off recording on four-tracks using an adopted shabbylooking piano that they rescued from a sidewalk. "There was something about it where
it was kind of beat up, and it was a little bit
croaky, and just like it had lived through
a lot. It was just sitting there and it was like,
begging to be played," Rice said. After wheeling it back to their practice space, Rice and
Rudder set course to learn the ins and outs
of the instrument that would soon drive the
band's melodies. "Corazan was the first song
we wrote on the piano," Rice explained.
Flash forward several years, Bishop
Allen stillhas the piano but has grown so big
that directors approach them for permission
to use their music in films, as did Peter
Sollet for his recent blockbuster "Nick and
Norah's Infinite Playlist." The band wasn't
expecting the grandeur of a real Hollywood
film, assuming it would be more like Sollet's
less known indie flick "Meeting Victor
Vargas." "It turned out to be, you know, like,
a Michael Cera comedy with a bigger budget
and a broader field than we ever expected,"
Rice said. "The actual process of filming it
was great, and I think it just helps more people know who our band is."
Hopping that their newfound fame will
introduce even more music-lovers to the
charming piano power pop melodies of
Bishop Allen, the band is set to release their
third full-length album, tentatively titled
"Grrr..." this Februrary, so keep your eyes
peeled, your ears opened and your toes
poised to dance to the keys and strings of
Bishop Allen's shabby and intimate piano
rock.

VINEGAR TOM POISED TO BEWITCH ITS AUDIENCE

Hena Choi Phoenix Staff

Jackie Avitabile and Colin Aarons appear in "Vinegar Tom," the Senior company's feminist rock and roll extravaganza hitting the Frear this weekend.

BY TIFFANY LIAO

tliaol@swarthmore.edu

The premiere of "Vinegar Tom," the Senior Company
2009 production, is sure to elicit a host ofreactions from its
audience. The one reaction that is sure not to be present?
Boredom. After all, the play is what director Jackie Vitale
'O9 calls "a. feminist rock and roll extravaganza" set in 17th
century England during a spate of witch trials.
"Vinegar Tom" captures several weeks in a village that
is swept by a national craze of witch-hunting. The play
specifically centers on how several of the women in the
village are affected by the possibility and the fear of being
accused of witchcraft.
The Senior Company chose to perform Caryl
Churchill's 1976 play because ofits focus on issues of gender politics, feminism and class prejudice. "We found lots
of things about the play like body image and medicalizing
women's bodies which still felt really relevant today,"
actor Jackie Avitabile 'O9 said. "We were really interested
in talking about feminism first of all because nobody talks
about it," Director Jackie Vitale 'O9 added, "It's a taboo
subject, like, 'Oh, we don't need it. That was the 70s.'"
In an unusual stylistic twist, the drama of the play is
interwoven with musical interludes in which modern-day
rock star versions of the characters sing to the audience
about the scenes in the play. The songs are meant to allow
the audience an opportunity to step out of the play and
digest the issues presented in the previous scenes. Musical
Director and Vocal Coach Dan Perelstein 'O9 decided to
write the music as "arena rock," because "the lyrics that
are given as part of the script are really in your face. We
wanted to match that, instead of trying to fight against it."
Far from confusing matters, actor Jessie Bear 'O9
believes that the music enhances the drama of the play.
"It's a beautiful marriage of music and story and theater,
and everything is just so present—live music, man!" Bear
said, "The music encourages us as actors and hopefully
will encourage the audience to be more energetic about
watching the story and to care more about these characters and to think more about the play and what the play is
trying to say."

Although set in 17th century England, the play is
informed by and comments on three time periods: the 17th
century, the 70s during which Churchill penned the play
and modern-day 2008. Keeping a balance between the multiple eras proved to be a unique task for the Senior
Company. "There are a lot of layers, but there is so much
thematic overlap in all these time periods. The key to
unlocking the play is unlocking that overlap," Bear said.
"The 17th century stuff could be a metaphor for today, and
then the stuff in modern dress when we're doing the songs
can be a metaphor for the 70s and so on."
While the Senior Company agreed that the material in
the play is inherently relevant over 30 years later, adjustments were made to the play to make it more pertinent to
a modern day audience. "The feminist movement in the
70s was incredibly different than it is now, Vitale said,
"We approached it from a more modern angle and we
brought in our own concerns. We focused on issues of the
female body and we downplayed some of the socialist feminist issues that were more relevant in the 705."
As it prepared to stage "Vinegar Tom," the Company

found great inspiration in the ideas of influential German
playwright Bertolt Brecht. "The idea is that theater is not
a place of escape, but a place of change, of social action,
where you come to learn and you come to be in dialogue
with the performance," Vitale said. This informed many
of the Senior Company's decisions concerning the production, whether reagrding the acting, the staging or the
music. One of the most noticeable incorporations of
Brecht is the arrangement of the audience around the
stage and the choice to leave the backstage completely visible to the audience. "We put the audience up high looking
down and examining these characters as little peons acting out their story," Set Designer Kini Comer 'O9 said. "Yet
with the open backstage, audience coming in will be
pushed through backstage. It's very presentational in the
sense that we are doing a show."
"There's no magic. Everything is laid out for you,
we're not trying to trick anyone with theater," Musical
Director and Vocal Coach Dan Perelstein added. "Here
you can see the lights, the props table, the instruments,
the band, the wires."

December 4, 2008

The intention is that the audience will constantly be
cognizant of the fact that they are watching a theater production and will therefore be prompted to process the
show and its message.

"We want [the audience] to keep a distance and to continue thinking, instead of only feeling," Perelstein
explained, "You see a couple scenes and you pause as the
rock band reflects on it and gives you time to digest it,
instead of just getting caught up in it."
Vitale also drew from Brecht when it came time to
develop movements for the characters. This was a challenge because Churchill does not include stage direction
in her plays. Vitale and the Company decided to create
dynamic physical movements that embody a character or
a situation. One notable scene reveals Alice's conflicting
emotions of desire and fear when she is approached to
learn the herb trade; a single tense movement she simultaneously lunges forward and recoils.
"There are several moments in the play where the
movements become otherworldly, and it's very presentational, very metaphorical," Vitale said, "That's become a
big part of the show, creating these moments that say
something just through the images."
Just like the set, the music and the acting, the movement of the play is designed around conveying the messages that Churchill puts forth in "Vinegar Tom." "We're
really intimately involved in the story, but also in the message and the themes and the questions that the play presents," Vitale said, "We all hope the audience feels the same
way and they're asking the same sort of questions and
thinking, 'this whole situation is a part of me even though
I go to Swarthmore and I'm living in 2008.'"
Bear expressed an even more basic desire for audience
reactions. "I just want them to talk to talk when they
leave about the play and to have that conversation last
longer than when they get to the door ofLPAC but to have
that conversation maybe last to the next night or the next
week."
"Vinegar Tom" will be performed in the Frear
Ensemble Theater in the Lang Performing Arts Center
(LPAC), with performances on Friday and Saturday, Dec.
5 and 6 at 8 p.m., and on Sunday, Dec. 7 at 2 p.m.

Mixing elements of hip-hop, tango and classical dance, this semester's Rhythm N Motion concert
opened, as always, with the sounds of the traditional "Magalenha" and featured a colorfully flashy
number that included bold dance moves, tight silver leggings and a DJ-accompanied freestyle.
Despite the overlap with the NCAA men's soccer championship, crowds still flocked to this timehonored tradition.

Consuming conspicuously

MING CAI

The Swatorialist
I have a problem.
Maybe it's the stress of finals rapidly
approaching, or the pile of work crammed
between Thanksgiving break and finals, or the
thought that Puppy Club Bar still doesn't make
sense, or the sinking feeling that it's now winter
and the cold weather isn't going to let up until
April of next year, or
Or maybe it's none of the above.
Over Thanksgiving break, I came to the conclusion (though I've reached it many times
before) that I am guilty of conspicuous consumption. Not only that, but I am a packrat, which
means that when looking through my closets and
storage bins, all of those "I-have-to-have-it" purchases are still there. It's embarrassing to think
that I fell prey to all of those awful trends like
Juicy Couture tracksuits and Hard Tail fold-over
yoga pants. Six or seven years later, I fear that
I'm still doing the same thing. Only now I have
my own (not very disposable) income and an
eßay account, which means that whenever I have
a hankering for, say, ridiculous red velvet holiday dresses with lace trim, I go on crazed searches that usually don't end well. Or they end with
my ordering three or four variations of the same
thing. Either way, it seems like excess that cant
...

be contained.
This past summer I read a short article in
Time Magazine about something called the 100
Thing Challenge. It started out as a personal goal
of blogger David Bruno to pare down his person-

12

al possessions to just 100 things. This was when I
had just moved back home from Swat and was
more or less fed up with the amount of stuff that
I had to schlep. I hadn't really unpacked yet; all
of my stuff just kind of sat in large scattered piles
around my room. I didn't want to touch or move
any of it, and rather than making me feel satisfied, all of my stuff just made me feel really
unsettled. Then I started to think that maybe this
100 Thing Challenge was what I really needed to
finally make me stop buying stuff that I don't
need, mainly clothes. At the same time, I read
Tim Gunn's "A Guide to Quality, Taste, and
Style," expecting it to be entertaining and a fun
summer read. It was nothing short of that (I
mean, what can you expect from a man with lines
like "it looks like a pterodactyl out of a gay
Jurassic Park") but it also confirmed my suspicions that any progress with the 100 Thing
Challenge would have to start with my overflowing closet
evidence of impulse-buying spun out
of control.
So I went on a crazy one-month purge of
everything that needed to go. I got rid of all
clothes that didn't fit but that I still kept for no
reason, clothes that I never wore and would
never wear in the future, clothes that I had completely forgotten about (which really showed how
much I didn't need them) and clothes that I didn't
really need and could sell on eßay for a profit.
One hundred Paypal transactions or so later, I
had made a decent profit, but had somehow broken even by purchasing one too many random
toy instruments. That's the danger of spending
too much time on eßay; unless you're disciplined, you end up spending as much money as
you make.
Then this semester started and the combination of stress, procrastination and convenience
all led to online retail therapy. So I'm back to
square one, with about as much stuff as I had
before the purging of my closet. Maybe reading
more than ten fashion blogs daily is not really
conducive to trying to downsize. If Susie Bubble
of Style Bubble fame has more than 278 skirts,
why can't I have that many dresses? Maybe I just
can't do the whole minimalism thing. Maybe I
just don't really want to.
I don'tknow. Maybe I've just been reading too
much Hipster Runoff lately and have fallen into a
life rut of trying to find meaning but being
unable to. I may be back next semester, I may not
be, but for now let's say adieu.

Pencils Down,

the most-viewed stories box
that popped up to the right
of the article. At the particular time that I read this
Pass the Remote
story, three of the top five
most-viewed stories on
Newsweek's website were
about eating disorders.
People have been talking for years about the serious problem of
eating disorders among young women (and, increasingly, some men),
and blame has been targeted to every imaginable source. One of the
sources that is often brought up in the media is television, a medium
that has featured so-called "sexy" women who often resemble the victims of a severe famine (yes, Ally Mcßeal, I'm talking about you).
Female actresses are under incredible pressure to be thin, as any regular reader of supermarket tabloids can tell you, and this pressure
often leads to unhealthy eating habits and eating disorders among
starlets.
Obviously, blaming television for every occurrence of an eating
disorder is foolish and doesn't address the real problem, which is a
serious mental illness. It can be argued, however, that the unrealistic
body images presented by popular television series add fuel to the
fire, pushing girls who were already obsessing about their physicality into dangerous territory; moreover, it can certainly be argued that
the old adage that "the camera adds ten pounds" can, when repeated
ad nauseam, cause a young actress to obsess unhealthily about her
——

weight.
A recent example of this phenomenon is the rail-thin stars of the
CW's "90210." The female characters on that show all look like they're
one skipped meal away from collapsing on set, and it's been estimated that none of them weigh more than 110 pounds. The network, however, denies that any of the girls has a problem and instead chooses
that "90210" is consisto focus on what it perceives as a positive
tently the highest-rated show in its time slot among girls aged 12 to
and
34. When a show whose stars appear so severely underweight
who are supposed to represent the attractive and popular faction at
their high school is so popular among the group that is at the highest risk for eating disorders, something is seriously wrong.
"90210," however, isn't the only CW show acting as a proponent of
pin-thin figures. One of the network's most consistently popular
shows, "America's Next Top Model," is populated almost entirely by
aspiring fashion models; in other words, women who want to succeed
in an industry where protruding ribs and thighs that are the same
width as calves are desirable looks. The show is hosted by former
model and current TV personality Tyra Banks, a woman who appears
to have serious trouble deciding what her stance on weight is. After
unflattering pictures of Tyra were published in a tabloid she famously appeared on her show in a bathing suit and told the paparazzi to
"kiss my fat ass!" Then she turned around and included a size 10
model on "ANTM." This girl was supposed to represent plus-sized
women; however, the current average size of an American woman
hovers somewhere around a size 12, meaning that the size 10 Whitney
Thompson is, in fact, smaller than the average American woman.
The CW certainly isn't the only network to blame for this phenomenon; plenty of other networks feature stick-thin actresses in
popular series, as anyone who has ever seen Ellen Pompeo's collarbones protruding above her red-carpet dresses can attest. The problem with the CW's thin actresses is that the network is a haven for
teenage girls, a highly at-risk group for eating disorders. When the
curviest actresses on your network are Leighton Meester and Blake
Lively (neither of whom is particularly skeletal, but neither of whom
can really be counted as curvy), someone's standards are seriously
skewed, leaving me to hope fervently that those standards aren't
passed on to the network's target audience.

FLETCHER WORTMANN
We Are Far Too Young and Clever
It's funny, but there have been times when I've felt like
Swat would last forever. Even now I'm having difficulty
accepting that the end is really here. But however I try to
deny it the fact remains. In a few days classes will end and
the dorms will empty. Hundreds of students will spread out
like migrating geese, flying south and never returning,
never again to attend Swarthmore as first-semester seniors, never again to walk these grounds until mid-to-late
January or so. Yes, the Fall 2008 semester is almost over.
I admit that over the years I've had a lot of fun at
Swarthmore's expense. But now I'd like to pause and,
using my incredible English major brain, reflect in insipid
detail upon the profound emotional journey we've all taken
together over the past three-to-four months. I can see it all
still, perfectly, as if through a shot of cheap horrible vodka,
or actually slightly less perfectly than that, like through a
large pane of glass printed with thousands of tiny dots to

back at Swarthmore through a glass spotted, and by printed spots or those of sparrow brain it matters to me not.
I remember when I first arrived here, in late August,
about three months ago. I was so much younger then.
About three months younger. And I was so naive! I spent
meal points like they were post-WWI German currency and
drank Odwalla smoothies like water. I printed lengthy
seminar documents on single-sided paper, just because I
could. I was reckless and stupid, and I didn't understand
that the good times had to end. But the weather got cold
and the squirrels got fat and sassy, and they stopped playing Numa Numa at Paces and started playing the Numa
Numa remix featuring Rihanna. I remember the hirsute
horrors of Mustache November, a campus of reckless
young men committing wanton crimes against fashion and
against God. I remember attending the Halloween party in
Sharpies and noticing a lucha libre wrestler and a Disney
princess emerge together disheveled from the conference
room near the cereal bar, ensuring that I will feel sort of
unclean every time I eat Kashi Heart to Heart for the rest
of my life.
But the point is that I am indebted to you, Swarthmore,
for the unforgettable memories and for the inerasable psychological scars. I look back from the bleak endless days of
the Bush presidency to the glorious ascendant millennium
of the Obama presidency-elect, and I am amazed at the
scope of my personal growth. I was once a foolish, ambitious 21-year-old child; now I am a jaded, embittered 21year-old man. I've changed so much since August, and I
cannot imagine where I'd be now without Swarthmore,
although ifI had to, I'd imagine I'd probably have beaten
"Metroid Prime 3" by now and maybe taken some classes
at Tufts.
And as I look back, I can't help but wonder what lies
ahead. It's like that guy from that movie says, the one with
the prominent nose who totally bangs the hot mom: I'm a
little worried about my immediate future for the next six
weeks or so. The record store back home said they'd like
me back for the holiday rush, but realistically, how long

can I expect that to last? Two weeks? Three? I can't work
retail forever. I'd like to continue my education at some
point, but I'm not even ready to think about that yet. And
I want to do something meaningful with my winter break
before I die, maybe write a novel, or cure a disease. I'm
already 21 years old and I'm only getting older. I am a butterfly, emerged from its chrysalis and ready to take flight,
but a butterfly born with angel wings, and a butterfly that
cannot fly, because angel wings are very large and very
heavy and the butterfly lacks sufficient upper-body
strength to lift them because he hasn't had time to go to the
gym in like three weeks.

I remember when I first arrived here,
in late August, about three months
ago I spent meal points like they
were post-WWI German currency and
drank Odwalla smoothies like water.

There are many things that I would like to say to you,
but I don't know how. All I can offer are a few parting
words of counsel. Take them as you will. Enjoy each fall
semester as if it were your last. Follow your instincts, your
heart, your dreams, until these things become inconvenient and then abandon them without hesitation. Laugh!
Love! Dance suggestively and drink excessively, because
very soon it will no longer be socially acceptable for you to
do these things! Live, goddamnit! And remember, when the
lights go dim and the floor goes sticky, and the last pingpong ball bobs in a glass of ashy beer, if nothing else,
remember this: Every new beginning comes from some
other beginning's end.

Risky business: avoiding competitive dieting amongst friends

TAMAR LERER
Everybody Eats
Friends are extremely important. There
are, of course, the obvious perks: the "Top
Chef watching marathons and alcohol-tinted Catchphrase playing. And then there are
the more significant roles friends can serve
as supporters, listeners, advisors, comj iots and commiserators. But, as it is often,
friendship and its relation to body image
issues, weight loss and healthy living can be
complex and can get messy. Friends can be a
great way to motivate yourself to lose
weight, but they can also become people in
competition with you or who enable your
less-than-healthy tendencies. Alternatively,
we ourselves can be those harmful friends
without fully realizing it and certainly without intending to.
There are two dangers that can arise
when friendships and body image issues

THE PHOENIX

mix: that the two friends begin competing
with each other, or that the two friends start
enabling each other to behave in ways that
are less than healthy. The competition can
be subtle or overt. Overtly comparative
statements like "Oh my god I can't believe
how little you eat" both engender competition and encourage a person to keep priding
herself on eating small and perhaps ever
smaller quantities
More insidious is the unspoken competition. You start going out with your
friends and measure how much you
should eat based on how much they eat. If
you eat more than them, you feel bad, and
if you eat less you feel somehow successful. The same goes for exercise. As one
friend increases her time in the gym from
20 minutes to 50 to an hour and a half, the
other friend might start to feel like she
has to keep up. I've been there, and I can
tell you that there is a fine line between
the type of keeping up that is a productive
motivator and the kind that is unhealthy.
While I'm extremely thankful for my
friend who just yesterday made me use
muscles I didn't know I had on machines
that were previously extremely intimidating, I don't stay for her full two-hour
workouts. When you find that you are
pushing yourself in ways that make you
unhappy or angry, that are physically
painful for you, or that are interfering in
other ways in your life, something is
wrong.
Equally as bad, or perhaps worse, is
the subtle undercutting that friends can
start to engage in. Instead of amping up
your own exercise routine or eating
healthier, it is sometimes easier to discourage someone else from doing more
than you. When comparing your own reg-

imen to a friend's makes you feel like
yours comes up short, you may try to
bring theirs to a level you feel more comfortable with. This, of course, can happen
in reverse, with a friend undercutting
you.
This sort of behavior isn't isolated to
body image issues. It's the misery poker

mentality that permeates Swarthmore
everything you have to do, I've got it
worse. Many of us engage in this sort of
behavior, and if you don't know how
ridiculous it can get, take a look at it in
print: "No, you're not fat, look at my
[body part I'm insecure about]". "You're
crazy, my [other part] is so much fatter
than yours!" It starts an arms race that is
hard to stop and builds in counterproduc-

tive ways.
What can you do about this sort of negative behavior? In either case, recognizing it is the first step. If you are being
overtly competitive or undercutting a
friend, you need to stop. If this recognition cannot easily lead to cessation, try to
remove yourself from certain situations
when this problem is bound to come up
such as exercising or eating one-on-one.
Similarly, if your friend is impacting you
negatively, first talk to them. If they won't
recognize their behavior pattern or can't
stop it, remove yourself from those sort of
situations. You can be great friends with a
person without being their workout
buddy or solo brunch partner. Putting an
end to situations that are counterproductive will not only help each of you, but it
will ultimately help your friendship.
Of course, when trying to lose weight
or live more healthily, it is extremely
helpful to be able to tell your friends what
you are doing and that it is important to

December 4, 2008

you. Most friends will at the very least
respect you
so no more awkward "But
why don't you want to split this pizza
with me?" in public. Some friends will
encourage and support you by choosing
outings and activities that allow you to
eat foods you feel comfortable with. And
some friends might even join you, having

similar desires themselves and looking
for a person to help strengthen their
resolve and make the process seem less
solitary and painful.

The same goes for exercise, which is,
as you know, my Achilles' heel. Revealing
that you are trying to work out more can
lead to a friend agreeing to work with
say by moving your
your schedule
weekly dinner date to Tarble from
or
Sharpies so you can go to the gym
they can join you. I've had a few great
exercise buddies who were on the same
page as me in terms of goals and strategies. They've helped me drag my butt to
the gym when I wouldn't otherwise go
because I have a commitment to them. Or
they can help you engage in a two-person
activity, such as tennis, that you both find
enjoyable. A friend can be a great motivator and encouragement in adding physical activity to your life.
What if you don't feel ready to tell your
friends about your insecurities yet, or if
they don't seem to understand? Come to

JONATHAN EMONT

Political Prisoner
I saw "Milk" on Friday and enjoyed it.
The film told the tale of Harvey Milk, a gay
man who was elected to the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors in the 19705. In the
movie, and in real life, Milk's election as
supervisor made him the highest-ranking
openly gay elected official in the country.
Today gays are hardly übiquitous on the
national stage, but they are there.
According to the Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund, 22 percent of Americans are represented by "an openly LGBT elected official."
This is progress. As the movie "Milk"
demonstrated, electing queer officials does
a lot to legitimize the group in the eyes of
voters. Queer individuals have a ways to
go before they are fairly represented in
local and national government, but one
feels that history is on their side. Younger
people have little problem voting for queer
candidates, and even among Americans at
large, 55% of the population says it would
cast its ballot for a queer person. Imagine
what that number would have been just 10
years ago.
This isn't to dismiss equal LGBT rights
as inevitable. The passage of Proposition 8

proved that there is a large and committed
opposition to queer rights, even among leftleaning voters. But the queer rights movement is making progress
it shouldn't be
long before either New Jersey or New York
legalizes same-sex marriage. Other movements, however, are not.
The one I am particularly concerned
about isn't even a movement at all. Like
queer people, we are well represented on

the Swarthmore campus, and like queer

people, we have only one Congressman representing us in Congress. We non-theists (a

classification which includes atheists,
agnostics, freethinkers, and the like) are
perhaps the most loathed group in
America. The same Pew poll that found 55%
of Americans willing to vote for a queer for
president found only 45 percent of
Americans willing to vote for an atheist.
According to Penny Edgell, sociology
professor and author of a study on

American minorities, "Atheists, who
account for about 3 percent of the U.S. population, offer a glaring exception to the
rule of increasing social tolerance over the
last 30 years." Gallup polls show that the
percentages of Americans willing to vote
for Blacks, Catholics, and women, have
increased since the 19605, but the percentage willing to vote for atheists has
remained constant or even declined.
None of this, of course, is to say that
atheists have it harder than other minority
groups. One's atheism is something that
can pretty easily be kept quiet, and atheists
are disproportionably wealthy and educat-

ed. But atheists, and non-religious people
more generally, are the fastest growing
American "religious group." People who
identify as non-religious make up more
than 14 percent of the American population. Yet there is only one atheist in
Congress (Pete Stark, Democrat from
California) and the Secular Coalition of
America could find only 4 government officials who didn't believe in God. (Two, I
believe, were town council members.)
That being said, I don't feel that my nonbelief is a burden. At Swarthmore College,
it obviously isn't. And unlike for, say, a
Baptist, my (lack of) belief is purely incidental to the rest of my life. I don't think in
terms of non-belief, and I don't attend ceremonies where people declare the Tightness
of non-belief. I simply don't believe.
So, if non-believers don't define themselves by their lack of belief, why does it
matter whether they are represented in
government? From a democratic standpoint, it matters that there are congressmen who don't believe for the same reason
that it matters that there are congressmen
who are women.
For a society to be truly democratic,
every demographic should be represented
in something approaching its proportion to
the general population. Or at least, you
shouldn't have a country where 14 percent
of a country doesn't have a religion and 534
of the 535 members of Congress do. And in
a nation that pays little heed to that
ancient injunction, that there should be a
separation of Church and State, having
members of Congress who don't belong to a
Church might do a lot of good.

There is something wrong
when the first President
Bush
felt free to declare
that he didn't believe
atheists should be citizens.
...

Discrimination against atheists and
non-believers is hardly institutionalized,
but it is apparent. There is something
wrong when the first President Bush, while
in office, felt free to declare that he didn't
believe atheists should be citizens. There
is something wrong when my high school
assistant principal told me that he he'd be
fired if he allowed me to start a club for
non-believers to counter the proliferation
of religious organizations at the high
school.
In one of the opening scenes of "Milk,"
Harvey Milk is arguing with another queer
individual over how best to pursue their
shared agenda. His interlocutor thinks
that Milk should stay on the down-low, that
queers should rely on straight allies in
high places and avoid running themselves.
He is afraid that Milk's running might provoke a conservative backlash.
But Milk ran regardless, and in his year
in office he became one the most powerful
spokesmen the queer rights movement has
ever had.
Non-believers have Pete Starks. But
until there are more than 4 non-religious
elected officials in America, I don't know
how many assistant principals will allow
their students to start clubs for non-believers, or how many assistant principals will
never become principals because they permitted them.

PHILIP ISSA

Philadelphia
I visited my grandparents in Aleppo,
Syria last summer. The city is located
in the north about thirty miles from the
Turkish border and is one of the
world's oldest. I've travelled there regularly since I was five, and it hasn't
changed much. My grandparents still
live in the same apartment that my dad
grew up in, and power outages are still
a daily occurrence. There is a citadel, a
souk and many hammams, and they're
all still standing, still busy.
My innumerable cousins are growing up, getting married, and having
kids, so I guess that's different, but
their stories are the same.

Arranged

marriage, get a degree (in something
useful, please!), now you're a husband.
Get a job to support your kids and then
go for more. I hear they used to give
fathers a gold medal when they had

twelve kids.
Your wife works because she's got
to. Bouthaina is a maid for my grandma, but her family hopes no one finds
out. Her help is invaluable
she's the
only one keeping my grandma on her
two feet while taking care of Grandpa
but that doesn't mean that
Bouthaina's husband is not ashamed.
He was skeptical about her working
until my grandma showed him what's
up.

She refused to let Bouthaina work
for her until her husband came and met
my grandma and she told him she
wouldn't take any bull. Either she
works here with your understanding
and approval, or she doesn't work here
at all, she told him. I guess they really
needed the money (no, I know they do.
Everyone there does.). He hasn't said a
word about it since, but he's probably
still a bit ashamed. That's ok, though.
It's the culture.
Not all of my cousins are guys, of
course. Some are women, and some of
the women in my family are very successful. They own businesses, they've
been elected to the legislature, they've
become designers and they trade across
the border with Beirut. I don't know
why some women in my family are
more independent than others. They
must have married open-minded husbands, either by luck or by choice. If
they didn't like the man, they didn't
marry him.
Of course, they're going to marry
somebody, but they only get one chance
to get it right; divorce doesn't come easily. I've heard some people say that
marriage isn't a word, it's a sentence.

she's thirty. I think most people have
written her off by now, which is a
shame, because I think she's brilliant
and incredibly brave. She's part of the
Red Crescent, and the work they do
involves teaching young men and
women about contraceptives and STDs.
(Not younger than university age, of
course.) She is by far the most politically outspoken family member among my
generation, but she adamantly refuses
to have an arranged marriage. She's
had some boyfriends, but her parents
technically don't know this and they
certainly don't approve. No way is she
leaving home without a respectable
husband. She's thirty, but who knows
when she's going to move out. It's the
culture.
In the 19405, my grandpa moved to
Paris to study medicine. He met his
first wife there, and from the way he

described her, she sounded vibrant. She
was a native Parisian. He discovered
Paris's neighborhoods, cafes and bars
through her, and he made the city his
own. They split after a few years, and
he left.

My grandparents still live
in the same apartment
that my dad grew up in,
and power outages are
still a daily occurrence.
He came back to Aleppo where he
met my grandma, because at the time,

that's where the money was. As a doctor, my grandma would say excitedly,
you could make, excellent money,
marry well and live richly, which they
did. They were socialites, they were
rich and they went dancing night after
night after night. My grandparents
were excellent dancers and they won a
few prizes in swing and salsa. When I
was over there, my grandma and I went
to some fancy country club where I
imagine they used to have their parties
that ran till dawn. I was hoping that my
grandma would show me some of her
moves, but she laughed and said, "Who
would I dance with?"
Back in the day, she said, she and
Grandpa would go outto dinner and not
eat a bite. Every time she'd sit down,
someone would come up and ask her to
dance. Everyone knew how well they
could swing; they were famous! They'd
dance with everybody, and they didn't
even have time to say a word to each
other. Now? No one would dare ask
someone else's wife to dance. Grandpa's
sick at home, and she has no one to
dance with. She said, this isn't even
dancing! Do you see anyone dancing
swing? It's all Islamic dancing now.
Nobody touches anybody; nobody
moves near. It's the culture; it's becoming stricter and stricter.
So what if it's culture? Does that
make it acceptable? Does that make it
right?

World AIDS Day: a call to arms

JAMES MAO
Over International Borders
This past Monday, Dec. 1, saw the
passing of the 20th anniversary of
World AIDS day, an event possibly
overshadowed by the reluctant
return to campuses all over the
country by disgruntled college students preparing for the home stretch

before winter break. Nevertheless,
the sad fact is that the toll of AIDS's
on the globe has been as consistent
and predictable as the arrival of
Thanksgiving weekend, year in and
year out. According to estimates by
the United Nations, there are now
33.2 million people living with ADDS.
Last year, 2.5 million people became
newly infected with the as yet virtually incurable disease.
Clearly, this is an epidemic of cataclysmic proportions. And yet I
always get the feeling that not
enough is being done about it
either not enough people care, or not
enough people who care have the
capability to affect outcomes. One
great hurdle to overcome in the
search for a cure is that of ignorance, and, by extension, prejudice.
There are certain misconceptions

that the unaware and the uneducated like to spread, and it begins with
us, the future leaders of a rapidly
crumbling world, to combat misinformation and mistakes.
So I am compelled to dedicate my
final column of the semester to
imploring all to invoke the spirit of
giving from which we have freshly
to invoke the ethos of
emerged
generosity found in a seasonal song
about gifts of a different kind, "Do
They Know It's Christmas," with its
refrain of "feed the world," except
this time it's about conquering a disease. Though 95 percent of those living with HIV/AIDS currently reside
in developing countries, this does
not mean that the HIV threat is not a
real one for us. Even if the news
tends to highlight the plight of the
poorest Africans and Chinese, this
does not mean that the most affluent
among us are immune. HTV/AIDS,
despite the misconceptions surrounding it, does not discriminate. It
will kill anyone in its unfortunate
path if the right steps are not taken
to counter it.
The greatest and seemingly most
invincible of humans have fallen
victim to HTV/AIDS. Prominent
cases from the 1980s are the thousand-watt smile of Magic Johnson
and the thousand-degree presence of
Freddie Mercury. As the decades

THE PHOENIX

have passed, instances of the rich
succumbing
and famous
to
HIV/AIDS have lessened, which
only serves to reinforce the need to
support those with less. Magic
Johnson, of course, is still alive and
the enterprising owner of several
movie theaters and restaurants, as
well as being a part-owner of the
multi-billion dollar Los Angeles
Lakers. His continued existence is
nothing short of a miracle, since he
was diagnosed with HTV nearly two
decades ago. Yet such is the unfairness of the world that not everyone
can afford the treatment that Magic
Johnson can. Moreover, improving
education and raising awareness
can only do so much for the third of
a billion already living with AIDS
according to the UN, half of those
who contract HTV die ofAIDS-related complications before the age of
25.

Fortunately, a recent International
Herald Tribune article highlighted a
study by an English medical journal
that gave hope to those suffering
from AIDS. According to this journal, The Lancet, if those who tested
positive for AIDS immediately
drugs
received
antiretroviral
instead of following current policy
and waiting for their immune systems to be weakened, the disease
would likely be eliminated by 2025.
Obviously there are still specifics to
be worked out in the study, but it is
an encouraging step in the right
direction.
However, such a step is still burdened by the misconceptions that
weigh downthe issue ofAIDS. There
is still much fear in the human psyche that disallows us from visiting a
clinic and testing for AIDS.
Ignorance, as they say, is bliss. Not
only is there the possibility of a
frightful confrontation with testing
positive, there is also the stigma
attached to being an AIDS victim to
consider. One need only take a cursory glance at Youtube comments on
any given Freddie Mercury-related
video to witness the blatant, igno-

rant homophobia spouted by the
worst of humans on a public forum.
And yet they ignore the fact that
AIDS doesn't give a damn if you're
rich or poor, black or white, gay or
straight. Nobody is safe. And that is
why more action is needed.
As we at Swarthmore march
towards our final exams, then, there
is obviously a lot of non-AIDS relat-

ed information and worries circulating in our heads. But at the same
time, there is no excuse for not helping the cause. It is incredibly easy.
You do not need to write 900-word
essays that maybe seven people will
read. Any of these organizations will
be happy to accept your invaluable
charity: avert.org, worldaidscampaign.org, worldaidsday.org, and
unicef.org. You can also make a difference just by educating others. We
can fight a terrible force by learning
from it: if it wants to take us down as
we transmit it one human to another, we will retaliate by raising
awareness, one person at a time.
And hopefully, by 2025, England's
top medical minds will have been
vindicated as AIDS is eradicated
once and for all.

Men's soccer applauds campus support
To the Editor:
The men's soccer team would like to thank all
those students, faculty, and staff that helped make
our past season so memorable. From decorations
in the dining hall, to shirtless fans in 30 degree
weather, all the support was absolutely amazing.
Because of your support throughout the season, we
were able to host the Centennial Conference playoffs. And in the final against Johns Hopkins you
did not disappoint. With nearly 800 fans, you
helped us win the first ever Centennial Conference
Championship for Men's soccer. Not to mention,
Swarthmore now holds the record for attendance
at the conference finals.
The next weekend we had the opportunity to
host the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament, another Swarthmore milestone. Despite a
torrential downpour, the stands were full as we
overcame Rutgers-Camden on Saturday. Versus
Dickinson on Sunday, a great crowd helped us
reach the Sweet-16. Home field advantage was
essential, and YOU made it happen. Again we were
hosts, this time of the Sweet-16. Once more, your
enthusiasm was incredible. There was a massive
tailgate and 300 garnet t-shirts printed for our
clash with Amherst. It was below freezing that
night, but thatdidn't stop nearly 800 fans from supporting Swarthmore athletics. We wish we could
have earned a different result for you that night,
but finishing the season at home with you was special. Particularly for the seniors, coming off the
field to our family, our friends, our fans, was a
moment we will never forget. For that we thank
you.

There are some specific people to whom we
would like to extend our gratitude. First, to the

members of the athletic department who worked
tirelessly behind the scenes to make sure everything went smoothly. Adam Hertz, Christyn
Chambers, Marian Fehy, and Sharon Green in the
front office. Ray Scott and Larry Yannelli in the
equipment room. The sports medicine staff,
Allison Hudak,- Marie Mancini, Jessica Quinn,
Steph Bingham, and interns for keeping us
healthy. Adam and Gwen for keeping us physically spry and mentally focused. And the Sports
Information Office, including Kyle Leach, Lucy
Foerster, and their staff for getting the word out
December 4, 2008

and tackling all things media related. We would
like to recognize the constant support ofProfessor
Everson and his work as the team's academic advisor. We wouldalso like to thank Dean Elverson for
providing advice and encouragement to the members of the team.
The Phoenix and Daily Gazette also covered the
season exceptionally. Your reporting helped build
interest in the season and it was wonderful to have
stories to share with family and friends who could
not experience the games first hand. SAAC (composed of a significant number of the softball team)
worked tirelessly to make sure that our visiting
opponents knew whose house they were entering.
From balloons, to posters, to cheering at the game,
we would like to thank SAAC for all their work to
make it a special season. Dining Services provided
the fuel that kept us going for the whole season. In
addition, they showed undeniable support
throughout the year, culminating in signs and balloons throughout the dining hall. Thank you,
Dining Services.
The Swarthmore Ville community has supported the men's soccer program in many forms
throughout the season and they never fail to bring
a large contingent to the game. From the youth soccer teams, to an exceptionally passionate group of
Strath Haven High School students, all of your support was greatly appreciated. The encouragement
from the Alumni was critical, We began our season
with a trip to South America in August and finished in late November at Clothier Field. They
were with us the whole way, some often under the
tree on the far corner of the field, always lending
theirvoices to the cause. We are grateful for all you
have done.
Lastly, we would like to thank again all the students, faculty, and staff. The appreciation we have
for the constant encouragement at the game, in the
classroom, and around campus is immeasurable.
You helped make our season a success. We were
proud to represent you on the soccer field and cannot wait until next season. We'll see you there.

Defending the cull: the rationale for sharpshooting in the Crum
BY JEFF JABCO AND COLIN PURRINGTON
jjabcol@swarthmore.edu and cpurrinl@swarthmore.edu
We write in response to Ethan Bogdan's editorial about
the deer cull planned for the Crum Woods. There are several
points raised within his piece that require either clarification or correction.
First, a bit of background on how this
decision was reached. Swarthmore College
has been studying the long-term effects of an
overabundance of deer since 2001 when it commissioned
Natural Lands Trust and Continental Conservation to prepare a Conservation and Stewardship Plan to secure the longterm viability of the woods and identify any potential risks or
hazards. That report, published in 2003, concluded that the
effect of overpopulation of deer in the woods was "profound."
Further research done by Natural Resource Consultants Inc.
(NRC Inc.) and an aerial infrared deer count supported the
conclusion that managing the deer population was a priority
for maintaining a healthy ecosystem in Crum Woods.
At present, excessive deer browsing is severely limiting
the ability of theforest to regenerate naturally and is altering
the structure and composition of the forest. For example,
deer are consuming nearly all of the native oak saplings. As
old oak trees age and die, there are fewer and fewer younger
trees left to grow and fill in the canopy, and as a result the
available habitat for other animals is diminishing. Nonnative plant species that are not part of the natural deer diet
are replacing the native species in the woods.
The Crum Woods Stewardship Committee (CWSC) set out
to understand how best to reduce the deer population to a
sustainable size in a safe, science-based and socially responsible manner. The committee members gave careful consideration to many options, including taking no action, mitigation techniques, predator restoration, trap and transfer, contraception, trap and euthanize, recreational hunting, sharp
shooting and/or a combination of these tactics. The CWSC
hosted several public forums throughout its deliberative
process in order to keep the community informed of its findings and to listen to community feedback.
It was only after careful study of the woods, consideration
of a wide range of deer population management options and
engagement with the community on this issue that the CWSC
came to its recommendation to proceed with a cull.
hnmunocontraception, as Ethan proposed, is a tool that
we will reconsider once it is approved by the EPA, is commercially available and has been tested in open environments, like the Crum Woods. At present, GonaCon is not
commercially available and we do not have a clear and
dependable timeline of when it will become available.
Promises that practical nonlethal solutions are on the horizon have been forthcoming since the mid-19705, and statements that GonaCon will be commercially available in the
near future began early in 2006. We are now approaching 2009
and simply cannot wait any longer.
Even if GonaCon were available right now, there is a lack
of experimental data supporting GonaCon's efficacy in an
environment such as the Crum Woods. Many of the current
testing grounds are islands or enclosed areas, not represen-

tative of free-ranging deer populations such as those inhabiting the Crum Woods. It is also worth noting that a typical
deer life span in the wild is 18 years, and thus contraceptive
methods would at best only result in a very slow decline in
the population, perhaps requiring a decade to have a noticeable impact. While the Crum Woods may be in better health
than other areas with overabundant deer populations, that
does not mean that the Crum Woods is "not yet in a critical
condition" as Ethan's editorial suggested. The longer the forest is impacted by overabundant deer, the more significant
the negative consequences and uncertainty regarding potential for recovery will be. At present we are unable to secure
land management grants for the Crum Woods because of the
threats imposed by an overabundant deer population. We are
also unable to replant native plant species in the quantities
necessary because of the number of deer.
Regarding the arguments against the use of a sharpshooter, it is first important to note that the College intends to contract an expert for this purpose. We must also clarify that
adult female deer will not be the only target. The sharpshooter will target all the deer within a group in order to prevent learned behavior by any particular segment of the deer
population. Fawns will be six months old or older when the
cull is planned to take place and they will no longer be
dependent on the doe. These animals will be indistinguishable from adults for most people and will be old enough to
breed. There is little objective science to support the conclusion thatfawns experience emotional or physical suffering as
a result of being separated from the doe at this age. In fact,

the

they are driven off by the doe in the spring as the dame prepares to give birth to new offspring.
In environments with intense competition for food, a sud-

den drop in population (as would occur after a cull) will
sometimes result in a phenomenon known as "reproductive
rebound." Science has shown that reproductive rebound
wherein fawns breed at younger ages and there is an
increased occurrence of multiple births
is unlikely to
occur in the Crum Woods setting. The number offawns born
into a herd each year is influenced by a number of factors,
the most important being nutrition. Deer in the Crum Woods
are well nourished, due to the ready availability of ornamental plantings, fertilizer, lime, mown lawns and bird feeders in
the surrounding area. Furthermore, the management program outlined for the College calls for on-going population
monitoring and control, which for the foreseeable future will
include the annual removal of deer to maintain a healthy

population.
The College remains open to considering alternative
methods for balancing deer impacts with the interests of the
other plants and animals that make up the forest as new
options become available. At present we have determined
that a cull conducted by an expert sharpshooter is the only
option that meets our goals to reduce the deer population to

a sustainable size in a humane, forest-science-based and
socially responsible manner, in our open boundary woodland
setting.

Woods Stewardship Committee.

Lerer's column oversimplifies the issues of eating disorders
To the Editor:
While I found Tamar Lerer's column

entertaining and well-written, I simultaneously found myself bothered by the premise

on which it is based: that disordered think-

ing and eating center around a desire to be
thin. Experience has taught me that on the
contrary, eating disorder behaviors are
mere symptoms of a larger problem. Often
they are accompanied by depression and
other maladaptive coping mechanisms; they

are the manifestation of how one deals with
life's stresses or trauma, and cannot be
reduced down to a desire to look good in a
bikini. It's not that I believe Lerer seeks to
minimize eating disorders, for she writes
with the compassion of someone who has
tasted this mania.
Unfortunately, however, her column perpetuates the misconception that girls with
eating disorder behaviors (constant body18

checking, weighing oneself more than once a
wek, negative self-talk, self-image and so
forth) are only seeking a better-looking body.
I do not deny that poor body image is an
important component of almost any eating
disorder, but it is not the only component.
Lerer's column ignores the mental/emotional component that fuels the eating disorder

and feeds the obsessive behaviors.
Telling someone with an eating disorder
to stop obsessing over the quantitative measures of her appearance (numbers on a scale)
and to instead worry about the qualitative
measures (how her jeans fit her) does not
deal with the problem at all.
In fact, this advice merely suggests that
girls keep obsessing, just in different ways.
It's as if Lerer is saying, "Keep the behavior,
just tone it down to a more acceptable form."
But to suggest this to someone plagued by
ceaseless, nagging obsessive-compulsive

thoughts (these thoughts are the only mechanism that can drive someone to weigh
themselves more than twice a day), is as
helpful as telling an alcoholic to only drink
in social settings.
My point is that eating disorders are not
so simple. Just as binge-drinking is a symptom of a larger problem for an alcoholic, eating disorder behaviors are maladaptive coping mechanisms aimed at silencing other
stressors.
The act of engaging in an eating disorder
behavior, whether it be restricting, bingeing, purging, or a combination of the three,
is a way to distract or numb oneself from
feelings or thoughts that seem indomitable
by any other means. For some, envisioning
how their jeans used to fit and comparing
the (possibly distorted) memory to the present may only feed the fire. What is someone
to do when she looks in the mirror and does-

December 4, 2008

n't like how any of her clothing looks,
regardless of the size? At this point, the
question is not, "What clothing will make
me look better?" but, "What do I really
want?" Ifwe delve beyond that first craving
or impulse, the ultimate desire is not to be
thin and attractive, but the perceived outcome that will arise from being thin and

attractive: attention from our crushes,
instantaneous world-wide approval (especially from those who never loved us) and of
course, fulfillment.
When Lerer declared that she had found
"two better and more tangible measures of
you as a person," I Was dismayed to find that
the alternatives she offered were merely
qualitative substitutions for quantitative
behaviors, that for many (those with overexercise patterns or body-image dysmorphia) would fuel the same obsessive cycle.

Athletes and sticks: a compelling mix

found the end of that game to be two of
the most entertaining minutes I have
seen in sports. Although an extreme
example of hockey fighting, this game
exhibits the important role fighting

HANNAH PURKEY
Purkey Perspective
March 5, 2004 should be remembered as a historic day in sports. It
should be remembered not because of
the conference on the historic struggle
for women's equality in sports or
because of the launch of a new British
Columbia program for children's
sports by the BC Hall of Fame,
although both of these events deserve
recognition. No, it should instead be
remembered simply for the last two
minutes of a regular season NHL
matchup between the Ottawa Senators
and the Philadelphia Flyers.
This regular matchup was anything
but ordinary, as it took a wild swing in
the third period when the Flyers'
Donald Brashear and the Senators'
Rob Ray dropped their gloves with 1:45
left in the game. This fight quickly
turned into a brawl, however, when all
the other players on the ice started
fighting as well, including a rare fight
between the goaltenders. These players were ejected from the game, but
once the puck was dropped to start the
game again, another fight broke out
with all the players on the ice except
the goalies. More players were ejected
and the game began again.

Fighting is a part of
hockey, but it is not a
big enough part that it
should deter people
from watching.
Typical of Philadelphia, fans in the
Wachovia Center started booing when
a fight didn't immediately begin at the
next face-off. They didn't have to wait
long, however. After less than 30 seconds of play another fight broke out.
More players were ejected and the
game began again before yet another
fight started and even more players
were ejected. After five consecutive
brawls, 1:13 remained to play in the
game and there were only three players left on the Flyers' bench and two on
the Senators'. The Associated Press
reported that it took officials over 90
minutes after the game had ended to
sort out the penalties. When they were
all counted, the game had broken the
NHL record for the most penalty minutes for a single game with a totalof 419
minutes for both teams.
I do not consider myself a violent
person. I don'tparticularly like watching fighting, whether it is occurring in

THE PHOENIX

plays in hockey.
Recently, however, I have discovered that my pleasure in watching this
and other fights is by no means shared
by everyone. While trying to convince
a friend to watch a game with me
(something I keep trying to do but no
one seems to take me up on), she
informed me that she refused to watch
any hockey games because the first
time she attended a game, a fight broke
out on the ice and she cannot support a

sport where violence like that is condoned. After the initial shock wore off

that someone would actually make the
conscious choice to never watch what I
consider the most entertaining sport
played in the US, I discovered that she
was not the only person I knew that
avoided watching hockey specifically
because of the fighting aspect of the
sport.

Fighting is a part of hockey, but itis
not a big enough part that it should
deter people from watching the game
at all. Fighting is considered a major
penalty, resulting in a player having to
sit out for five minutes of the game.
Although officials let fights continue
once they have started, they often separate players before they start fighting
and always stop the fights when they
escalate to a point that could be dangerous to either player.
Fights function similarly to tactical
fouls in other sports. In soccer, for
example, a tactical foul can be used
when it is better to take a penalty than
to give up a breakaway on goal. In
hockey, it is the same thing.
A fight can be used to change the
momentum of a game to a team's
advantage, or to defend a teammate on
the receiving end of an opponent's
unfair play. Although fighting may
seem like a more aggressive action
than fouls in other sports, in fact there
is a higher chance of getting injured by
being checked into the boards or by
getting hit by a puck when blocking
shots. The fact that players have to
fight while keeping themselves bal-

anced on their skates and while wearing many layers of padding makes
fighting in a hockey match much less
dangerous than fighting in a boxing
match. Not to mention that whereas
boxing is all about fighting, in hockey
fighting is just a small piece of the
sport.
Contrary to what

the 2004 SenatorsFlyers game might suggest, teams can
go for several games without ever participating in a fight. In last year's playoffs, the San Jose Sharks in their series
against both Vancouver and Dallas
never once had a fight, and playoff
hockey is supposedly the most aggressive and competitive of the season.
Hockey is too great of a sport to be
written off solely on one component of
the game.
I urge anyone who might have dismissed hockey in the past as too vio-

lent to be a quality sport to take a second look. I think you'll be surprised to
find that along with its somewhat
aggressive aspects, hockey is truly an
entertaining sport of skill and finesse.

Swim teams face worthy foe
BY DENNIS FAN

dfan2@swarthmore.edu

The men's (2-3, CC 2-1) and
women's (3-2, CC 2-1) swim
teams improved their overall
conference records the week
before Thanksgiving Break
with confident victories over
Ursinus College, but also
dropped a meet to a challenging New York University swim
team. Coaches had promised
that the NYU competition

would be difficult, and it

proved to be so. The nationallyranked top-20 teams swept both
men's and women's competitions with 126-78 and 135-63 victories respectively. The meet
was not without bright spots,
as Chelsea Brett 11 tookfirst in
the 100-yard freestyle in a sea-

son-best time and the Garnet

teams with several other outstanding times.
Sarah Bedolfe 11 comment-

ed that, "NYU is a step above
most schools in the Centennial
probably the
Conference
toughest competitions we see
all year." For the resilient
Swarthmore swimmers, the
...

demanding

competition

in

New York proved to be an
incentive to swim faster and
bounce back.
Three days later, the swim
teams faced Ursinus and both
the men's and women's teams
defeated them decisively, 162-87
and
138-119 respectively.
Though the meet was close at
times for the women, a topthree sweep in the 200-yard IM,
the second to last event, sealed
the victory for Swarthmore.
Ultimately, Ursinus served as a

vital proving ground for the
strength of both swim teams.
Among the events that Garnet
swimmers swept first and second were the women's 200-yard
freestyle, 200-yard butterfly
50-yard
the men's
freestyle, 100-yard freestyle,
and 200-yard freestyle relay. A
new pool record for the 200yard freestyle relay was also
set by freshmen August
Dinwiddie, Lance Liu and Tim
Brevart, and senior captain
Doug Gilchrist-Scott, who also
swept both backstroke events.
Brett attributed the victory
to the team's practices and
said, "Everyone really stepped
it up." Even when not taking
first place finishes, swimmers
were able to compete nose-to-

and

nose with Ursinus' best and
score points.
Despite strong finishes,
there are still many aspects of
competition for the Garnet to
improve on. Brett commented
that "Little things in races,"
such as out-touching opponents at the wall, wouldmake a
big impact on the final score of
races. Sam Bullard-Sisken 'l2
added thatthe team wouldtake
time in practice on starts and
turns, which can have a
tremendous impact on the
overall race. Swimmers score
points by their place at the finish of a race, not by their time.
A third-place finish, even if
within one-hundredth of a second of a second-place finish,
still counts as a third-place finish (a phenomenon well-documented by Michael Phelps in
the Olympics this past summer). Though formal practices
will halt soon, as the final

exam period looms ahead,
swimmers are expected to stay
in the water.
Furthermore, the swim
teams will have an opportunity
to improve over Winter Break
on their training trip to Aruba.
The trip will not be as relaxing
as it may sound. Brett
described the daily training
routine, "We wake at 5 a.m. for
three hours of swimming" and
the swimmers engage in dryland practice along with more
swimming later in the day. The
trip promises to be a great way
for the team to train and bond
at the same time.
In the nearer future, the
Garnet will have an opportunity to avenge their close losses
to Franklin & Marshall College
by competing at the Franklin &
Marshall Invitational this
weekend. F&M has defeated
Swarthmore in the conference
championships the past few
years as well as earlier this
year.

Bedolfe stated the invitational was "practice for conference [championships]." Teams
from all over the conference
attend, and many teams taper
to prepare for the meet.
Tapering is a process where
swimmers gradually swim
less, staying in the water but
resting and storing up energy

Swarthmore will decide to
forgo tapering and continue

dividends later.

Women's basketball prevails in win
BY ALYSSA BOWIE

abowiel@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's basketball team
opened Centennial Conference play this past
Tuesday with a 71-69 win over McDaniel. Ranked
6th in the Centennial Conference, McDaniel
proved to be a tough opponent for the Garnet,
especially in second-half action. Swarthmore's
eventual win came thanks to a three-pointer
scored by forward Melissa Grigsby 'O9 in the
final seconds of the game.

"The play of the game," according to guard
Nicole Rizzo 'l2, "was definitely Melissa's ending shot, because it was so clutch." With the final
seconds of the game on the clock, Swarthmore
needed at least two points to win the game, after
coming back from a deficit of 6 points racked up
by McDaniel in the final minutes. With
Grigsby's three-pointer, the Garnet were able to
secure a win, the first of their season and the
first for them in the Centennial Conference.
Grigsby contributed 16 points to the Garnet's
offense, one of three players to score in double
digits. Along with Grigsby's point total and an
additional six assists, other notable offensive
performances were those ofPam Costello 'lO and
Kathryn Stockbower 11 While Costello managed to put up her first double-doubleof the season, with 14 points and 10 rebounds, a testament
to the Garnet's strong defense throughout the
course of the game, Stockbower posted numbers
consistent with her previous performances,
scoring 16 points and grabbing 24 rebounds.

Stockbower's performance not only lends itself
to a personal streak (this is her 14th straight double-double) but is also an achievement within
the school's history and the conference itself.
She has now broken Swarthmore's rebounding
record (previously 23, posted by Nancy
Rosebaum '92) and is additionally tied with five
other women for the Conference record.
The win over McDaniel marks a newfound
endurance within the squad. According to
Summer Miller-Walfish, a sophomore center, the
Garnet "came out strong, despite the fact that
they [McDaniel] made a run in the second half."
Prior to this game, the Garnet dropped three
games, two at home during the annual Swat TipOff tournament, and one on the road versus
Westminster.
The problem, team members said, has often
been a lack of consistency in performance
throughout the game. The Garnet, in the past,
have tended to either come out strong and lose
steam, or lack composure until the second half of
the game. By besting McDaniel, the team proves
it has the skill, composure and consistent effort
necessary both to win games and to be a contender within the Centennial Conference.
Swarthmore's Centennial Conference play
continues today, when they host #2l
Muhlenberg in Tarble Pavillion at 7:00p.m. "The
conference is much closer this season than in
the past two years and we are right there with
the rest of the teams," notes Costello. "We now
have a lot of momentum going into our
Muhlenberg game."

Men's basketball surges forward to capture first win of season
BY DANNY FRIEL

dfriell@swarthmore.edu
The Garnet men's basketball team posted its
first win of the season over Thanksgiving break,
edging out Arcadia University at home by a score
of 65-63.

After jumping ahead to a 37-27 lead at halftime,
Swarthmore held off a surging Arcadia squad in
the second half to seal the victory. The Garnet was
down 55-59 with less than five minutes to play, but
defeated the Knights, who fell to 2-3 with the loss.
The Garnet offense was spearheaded by the
strength of co-captain Matt Allen 10's twentypoint contribution, as well as double-digit efforts
from co-captain Raul Ordonez 'O9 and Sam Lacy
'IL
Ordonez also led the team with eleven
rebounds, and Lacy had four shots blocked to his
credit.
Swarthmore improves to 1-2 with the win, but
has yet to face a Centennial Conference opponent.
After posting a conference record of 2-16 last
season, the team is prepared to make the necessary improvements to become a force to be reckoned with. Ordonez looks to a large freshman
class to help make this transition.
"In many ways, it feels like a brand-new team,"
Ordonez says of this year's revamped roster. "At
this moment we have a 12-man team of which half
are freshmen who really need to contribute," he
added.
Indeed, there are six first-years on the squad
this year. Among them is Michael Giannangeli 'l2,
who also recognizes the need for the newcomers
to assimilate quickly. "We are still trying to get
used to the college level and playing together for
the first time. Playing a few non-conference games
is good to work that stuff out, especially when we
get a win out of one of the games," he said.
Giannangeli has also benefited from the advice
of Swarthmore alumnus and former player Matt
Kurman 'OB, who warned Giannangeli that
although his first year may be "tumultuous [due
to the relative inexperience of the team]," hard

work and perseverance ensure that "good things
will happen."
Giannangeli cites reaching the
postseason as an objective goal for the team this
year. "We want to improve every game and put
ourselves in a position to contend for the playoffs
at the end of the season," he said of early-season
preparations.

Danny Walker 'lO cites motivation from within
the team as an important factor in playing well
and winning games.
"The intensity level on the court and on the
bench is high, and it's tough," Walker said, noting
that the team will "compete everyday" at practice
in preparation for the vigor of intercollegiate
gameplay. Walker also noted that the newcomers
"work harder than ever. They're making big leaps
in terms of jumping from high school straight to
the collegiate level."
Meanwhile, as the lone senior on the roster,
Ordonez looks to mobilize his teammates, old and
new.
"Even our returners are going to need to step
up and play a more primary role than they needed to in the past," Ordonez said, adding that youth
combined with small numbers will require a concentrated effort in order to be successful.
Building team chemistry is a key factor in
maintaining success in the sport of basketball.
With such a large number of fresh faces this year,
the early season is a crucial integration period.
Early-season outcomes often set the tone for the
rest of the season, so it is a vital intention for the
players to start off on the right track and then
take advantage of opportunities for improvement.
"We've stuck together through these tough first
games, all of us are getting a better feel out for our
personal roles, and we're all focused on playing
solid team basketball," Walker said.
The Garnet will test their abilities within the
Centennial Conference by hosting rivals
McDaniel College and Johns Hopkins University
this week. Saturday's 3:00 pm game against
Hopkins will be a part of a double-header, as the
Swarthmore women's team will host the Blue
Jays prior to the men's match at 1:00 pm.

Historic run of men's soccer ends with a loose ball
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
Saturday, November 22 marked the end of the
Swarthmore Men's Soccer 2008 campaign. The defeat transpired on the Garnet's home turf, Clothier Field, during the
NCAA Division in Sectional Semifinals. It came at the
hands or, rather, feet of the Amherst College Lord Jeffs
(14-3-3). Amherst scored right before halftime and held off
the Garnet's rejuvenated second half attack to advance in
the Men's Soccer Championships.
The loss ended
Swarthmore's first national tournament appearance since
1991 and closed the books on an historic season.
The Garnet (17-3-2) entered the match on a 13-game undefeated streak, having never trailed in any of those games.
The team was also riding the exhilaration of winning the
first Centennial Conference Championship in school history. On the other side, Amherst also won its first conference
title this season, downing Middlebury to capture the
NESCAC Men's Soccer Championship title.
Early in the match, Amherst dominated the game with
physical play. The Lord Jeffs controlled the ball for the
majority of the first halfand outshot the Garnet six to two.
There were multiple reasons the Amherst players were able
to maintain possession in the Garnet's half. Swarthmore
Head Coach Eric Wagner acknowledged Amherst's early
dominationand as one explanation he offered, "In the first
half we were caught on our back foot and we were not anticipating as much as we have been."
"Their intent was to disrupt our style of play," Wagner
added.
Amherst's game plan of disruption was recognizable
from the last row of the stands. Whenever a Swarthmore
player maintained control of the ball, an Amherst player

closed in quickly and did not allow space for plays to develop. Defender and Captain JeffKushner 'O9 recognized this
pattern and commended Amherst for it. "The better teams,
that's what they do. Putting pressure on the ball and making it real difficult is a sign of a good team," Kushner said.
In the first half, the Swarthmore attackers had no margin for

second half and outshot the Lord Jeffs four to threein that
period. Swarthmore also held the advantage4ncorner kicks,
three to two. The best opportunity of the hEQTcame in the
58th minute off of a free kick by Swarthmore midfielder
Roberto Contreras IV 'l2. The kick deflected off the crowd in
front of the net and struck the far post. The ensuing corner

Kushner said. The Garnet entered halftime down 1-0, trailing for the first time in 13 games. The crowd waited anxiously to see how Swarthmore would respond.
Once the ref s whistle pierced the frigid air and the second half began, the transformation became apparent. "We
completely dominated the second half. In the second half we
were as good and as tough and as focused as we've ever
been," Wagner said. "All we did was overmatch them physically." He added that the change came about "subtly." "We
stepped it up a little higher then a little higher and little by
little we justramped up the pressure. That's one of the reasons we've been so consistent over the season," he said.
The incremental increases in pressure manifested themselves in the shot log. The Garnet turned it around in the

Swarthmore came on a free kick deep in Amherst's half.
With the crowd on its feet, cheering wildly, Swarthmore
threw everything it had at Amherst. Even D'Annunzio
sprinted from his goal to join the mob in front of the net.
One final time, however, the Garnet was unable to capitalize.
Despite the demoralizing loss, the Swarthmore players
were not despondent. Wagner was confident that the team
would be satisfied with its effort. "This was a bit of a magical season and at some point it had to end," he said. "We
gave it everything we had. We threw everything but the
kitchen sink at them. No, I think we did throw the kitchen
sink at them." Kushner was also optimistic. "I couldn't
have thought of a better senior year," he said. "It's a shame
we came up short tonight, but there were a lot of question
marks coming into the season in all classes and I think we
answered them all."
Kushner's fellow captain Dylan
Langley 10 was also able to look past the defeat. With a nod
to Kushner, he said, "It's not losing the game that hurts the
most, it's losing these guys." Swarthmore will lose eight seniors from the squad, but look for the team to continue its success next year with a strong core of returning players.

error, and they were simply not sharp enough to create scoring opportunities, managing only two shot attempts.
With the ball spending the majority of the half on the
Garnet's side of the field, it was inevitable that it would eventually find its way into the net. With less than one minute
left in the first half and the game still scoreless, it looked as
if the Garnet had escaped the inevitable, but the Lord Jeffs
had one last opportunity after Swarthmore goalkeeper
David D'Annunzio 'l2 punched-the ball out ofbounds deep in
Garnet territory.
On the resulting throw-in, Amherst was able to successfully finish with 20 seconds remaining on the clock. "One of
their players snuck in behind us. It was a loose ball in the
box that wasn't taken care of, and he got a toe on it,"

kick was also unsuccessful.
With the game well into the second half and the Garnet
still trailing, Wagner substituted in a forward, David
Sterngold 'l2, for a defender, Gage Newman 'll, and played
with only three defensive backs in an attempt to generate
more offense. He said that the team had used this formation
in South America during the preseason. The last chance for
