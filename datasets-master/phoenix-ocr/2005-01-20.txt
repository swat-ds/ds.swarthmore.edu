SEPTA fare hikes, service
cuts near implementation
County that she would need a friend to
bring her to work if she could not ride pub

BY KEVIN CARR

kcarrl@swarthmore.edu

Gov. Ed Rendell issued a last-minute
stay on Dec. 20 to postpone a plan for service cuts and fare hikes for the Southeastern

Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
that was scheduled to take effect in January
2005. The plan will still be implemented if
movement towards increased SEPTA funding does not take place by Feb. 27.
SEPTA'S proposal calls for a reduction
by 20 percent in all services on regional
rail lines, buses, subways and trolleys,
coupled with a 25 percent increase in fares
phased in over the next few months.

the Rl airport line. Many

fare for rides on buses
and subways would ultimately rise from $2.00 to
$3.00.

Professor Thomas Whitman, chair of

work in the morning. "[Service] cuts woulc

a one-way ticket from Swarthmore to
Philadelphia stations would cost $6.00,
making SEPTA the most expensive public
transit system in the country.
If put in place, the SEPTA service cuts
and steep fares would greatly affect
Swarthmore College and the surrounding
borough. Students rely on the regional rail
lines to get to Philadelphia for classes, lab
work and internships as well as for weekend entertainment. "The college and the
borough [of Swarthmore] are extremely
reliant on SEPTA," Vice President Larry

The motivation for SEPTA'S plan lies
mainly in a severe budget shortfall; SEPTA
will incur an estimated $63 million in deb
this fiscal year, according to The
Philadelphia Inquirer. The main source o
the problem is a depletion of federal fund
ing that has become increasingly problem
atic for Pennsylvania's public transporta
tion systems since the 'Bos. "SEPTA once
received 18.8 percent of its operating costs
from the federal government," but now
"this number is at 3.4 percent," according
to Harrisburg Budget Analyst Christian

They Might Be Giants
to be large-scale event
Idiosyncratic rock band They Might Be Giants will come to campus Saturday,
Feb. 19 as this year's large-scale event, according to David Rowan, an assistant
at High Road Touring, the band's booking agency. The performance was confirmed by the chair of the Large Scale Events committee, Veronica Lim 'O7.
Though the show, which will take place at the Lang Performing Arts Center,
has been listed on area Web sites including Delaware Online.com, the show will
be a "school show only," Rowan said. This means that tickets will only be available to Swarthmore students.
According to member of the LSE committee Hunter Bandy 'O7, the band
Common Rotation will open for They Might Be Giants.
A method for reserving tickets will be decided at the next LSE committee
meeting this weekend.

John Podesta, former chief of

"We're provisionally helping

According to political science

protect Sudanese victims of genocide, he said.
Though the funds GIF raise
will be unlikely to have a major

tangible effect on the day-to-day
operations of the AU peacekeeping mission, Hopkins argued that
the precedent set by GIF for citizen action on such big international issues could be significant.
"It sets a precedent by which people that are outraged have a vehicle for taking action," he said.
He pointed to the recent outpouring of aid for victims of the
tsunami in Southeast Asia by private citizens as a similar precedent. "The vast outpouring [of

aid] by the public shamed governments to raise their pledges," he

said.

Pell Grant cuts to be covered by college
BY BEN OLDFIELD

boldfiel@swarthmore. edu

A change in eligibility for Pell Grants, announced in
December by the Department of Education, could affect the
amount of aid Swarthmore students receive from those
grants.

The recalibrated formula, which determines Pell Grant

eligibility, will be based on more recent state and local tax
data of middle- and low-income families, according to

CNN.

Since state and local taxes were higher 15 years ago
when the program was last updated, the new formula
makes it seem that families have more available income to
pay college expenses now than they did. However, this
effect is disputed as costs of higher education have risen

while tax rates have dropped.

Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot said she is confident that the recent federal reductions will not affect the
college's commitment to meeting the financial needs of students.
"Changes like this happen all the time, and the federal
Pell Grant program has been cut many times throughout
the years," she said. "But we haven't let federal student aid
policy affect our own policies."
Federal Pell Grant funding is expected to total about
$450,000 this year, according to Talbot. "This is not
insignificant, but it is a small portion of all grants and
scholarships our students receive. Pell Grants make up
about 2.5 percent of that total," she said.
The college has promised all 170 students receiving Pell
Grants that their needs will be met despite any reduction
in federal aid.
The college has adopted this policy during similar
extramural aid cuts in the past.
The college's supplementary aid to fill the Pell Grant
gap will come from a reserve designed to compensate for
changes in external grants. "We have a separate financial
aid reserve that lets us stay in financial aid equilibrium,"

or university, where all financial aid is federally funded,"

admissions decision, but is concerned that the college is
following a national trend by making itself less and less
accessible to poor prospective students.
Reductions in Pell Grants, he fears, might accelerate
this trend.
"As well-intentioned as the college is, poor students
aren't matriculating here in numbers as great as they used
to be," he said.
Last spring, Rodriguez presented a set of data that
examined the distribution of financial aid at Swarthmore
across different family incomes of students to the Board of

Managers.

Talbot said. "Every year, money is a concern for us. But we
have a process in place to fill any gaps students encounter
in their aid."
Talbot encourages concerned students to write to
Washington, describing their financial situation to their
senators. Swarthmore College's lobbying position is not
strong because Pell Grants only cover a small part of the
tuition cost.
"It is more difficult for a private

"It is more difficult for a private
college like Swarthmore to lobby for
aid as opposed to a state college or
university, where all financial aid is
federally funded."
Laura Talbot
director of financial aid
"Swarthmore needs to lobby cautiously," Talbot said.
"The most effective way is if students are very specific to
their own situations in describing their concerns to their
senators."
Talbot is also comforted by President Bush's claim that
he would ask Congress to raise Pell Grant funding $lOO million annually until 2010, which was announced last Friday.
The increased funds will be realized by administering the
Pell Grant program more effectively, according to The New
York Times.
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, recognizes Swarthmore's commitment to a "need-blind" admissions policy that does not
look at an applicant's financial situation in making an

According to his presentation, while the number of
students receiving aid has remained relatively constant

since 1999 (approximately 50 percent of the student population), consistently more aid has been going to students
of families with incomes over $BO,OOO, while aid going to
those of families making less than $40,000 has dimin-

ished.

According to Rodriguez's data, in 1999 there were 230
students of families earning more than $BO,OOO receiving
aid; this number consistently increased until 2003, when
there were 375 such students.
On the other hand, students receiving aid in 1999 who
came from families earning less than $40,000 totaled 201;
that number has dropped to 173 in 2003.
"Now it's becoming an issue of whether poor people
will apply to the college or not," said Rodriguez. "I know
that Swarthmore has a serious investment in meeting the
needs of the students, and we need to appreciate that. But
this is a national problem, and the college should be leading the research efforts to deal with it."
Talbot argued that the number of students receiving aid
in each income group is not an indication of howmuch aid
is going to that group.
"The number of students aided in a particular income
group is not according to an intuitional quota but rather
can be determined only after the admitted students have
made their enrollment decisions," she said in an e-mail.

Philly second fattest city
BY ANDREW WHITNEY
DAILY PENNSYLVANIAN (U.

PENNSYLVANIA)

(U-Wire) Philadelphia
Philadelphia has a habit for
coming agonizingly close to
championships without winning
them, but there is one title that
the metropolis was glad not to
win: America's Fattest City.

February's issue
of Men's
Fitness magazine evaluated the
fifty most populous U.S. cities,
assigning them grades in differ-

ent obesity-related categories.
The result: Philadelphia is only
second-fattest, trailing Houston.
Philadelphia's citizens have
dieted and then regained the
weight over the past few years.
After being named America's
fattest city in 2000 in the inaugural survey, Philadelphia has
shown steady improvement
that is, until this year.
To what do we attribute this
collective corpulence? The lessthan-scientific study has some
answers. The city received fail-

ing grades in several categories:

fitness centers/sporting goods
stores, television watching, air
quality and parks/open spaces.

The study offers some
astounding statistics. Fiftyseven percent of Philadelphians
are overweight by a large
enough margin to cause health
problems. The city has three
times the national average of
doughnut shops per capita.

Students who rent parking spots
in the Ville may find their wallets a
little thinner this semester since
the monthly fee for a space in the
Myers Avenue lot jumped from $2O
to $5O this January.
Borough
Manager
Jane
Billings said the Borough Council
felt the previous price was low for
a personal parking space. "We did
some comparison with other
towns, particularly college towns,
and [sso] seemed to be a lot closer
to what other people paid," she
said. "It's a matter of supply and
demand," she added.
Borough Council member Tom
Huestis echoed this reasoning.
"The general thought was that the
lots were full and more people were
asking for spaces than were available," he said. "We thought that
this was the best way to address the
demand that was there."

Although 95 percent of the
Myers Avenue monthly spots

are

rented by students, Billings
stressed that the Council's intention was not to discourage students from parking there. "We
worked out a solution to try to
accommodate students [by providing the monthly spots], and we
really appreciate their cooperation," she said. "Students are good
about paying the fee and not parking their cars all over the streets
of the ville."
Huestis noted, however, that

THE PHOENIX

January 20, 2005

over the next several years it may
become necessary to convert a few
of the monthly spots assigned to
students into spaces for commuters using the train, as the old
Co-op will be torn down and
changes to the streetscape will
affect parking. He suggested that
one possible motivation for the
price increase may be easing this

transition by diminishing the
demand for monthly spaces.

"We thought that this
was the best way to
address the demand
that was there."
Tom Huestis
Borough Council
member
The price hike appears to have
driven up the number of applications for on-campus parking permits. "We've had lots of requests
this semester
more than usual,"
Terri Narkin,
administrative
assistant for Public Safety, said. "I
would guess that's because of the
price increase, but there's no way
to know for sure."
Narkin said about 115 on-campus spots are available for students each semester, and there is
no capacity to increase that number at this time.
Ben Camp 'O5, who parks in the

Myers Avenue lot, said the

new

cost is unreasonably high. "If
you're going to park here for the
whole year, that's 10 months,

which is $5OO. That's ridiculous,"
he said.
Janice Yeo 'O7, who also rents a
spot, agreed that the price hike
was

unreasonable

and

she

expressed displeasure about about
the timing of the change. "I
thought it was incredible that we
got notified right before break,"
she said. "The timing didn't allow
us to get organized at all."
Students who paid in advance
into 2005
before the increase
will not be charged the extra $3O for
each prepaid month, according to
Billings.
She said the Council tried to
give students adequate notice by
sending out an e-mail in December
and noting the change in several
issues of the local newspaper.

Yeo
said
she
wishes
Swarthmore could offer more oncampus parking, but that the college does not have the responsibility to alleviate the situation. "The
students who have cars should
take responsibility for writing to
the borough and finding out why
they did this," she said.
Camp believes that the increase
could have negative effects on the
borough. "Basically, it means that

they're going to have people parking illegally all over the streets of
Swarthmore," he said. "If people
have cars, they're not just going to
get rid of them."

Swat students work to aid tsunami victims

Alum gives media assistance to relief agencies; on-campus groups to hold fundraising party
BY ERIC MILES GLOVER
egloverl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore alum Rebecca Ennen 'O4, was in Sri Lanka
when the tsunam that hit most ofSoutheast Asia struck on
December 26.

"Many places I knew well were reduced to rubble,"
Ennan, who is currently studying in Sri Lanka on a
Fulbright Scholarship, said in an e-mail.
In the wake of the devastating tsunami in Southeast
Asia, Ennen began work on two different media-related
projects to help victims of the tsunami and to draw attention to their plight.
"I have now done Web site content editing for two
organizations
Sarvodaya, a
Gandhian community
development movement with offices and initiatives all
over the island and Volunteer Sri Lanka, a new organization that is helping [to] organize the huge inflow of volunteers," she said.
In addition, Ennen is assisting in a documentary film
project that hopes "to portray the strength, hope and
resilience of tsunami survivors, in the first stage of
rebuilding, to secure ongoing support and attention from
the international community," she said.
The tsunami did not pose a threat to her safety because
she was not in its path of destruction. "I was home in the
central mountains of the island," she said. "I was

Swarthmore College students and recent graduates
have begun a variety of relief projects to aid victims of the
tsunami in Southeast Asia that killed hundreds of thousands of people and left many more injured or homeless on
Dec. 28.
Jacob Wallace 'O5, who lives in Jakarta, Indonesia,
brought 100 Balinese sarongs to Swarthmore this semester

in an effort to contribute to the relief effort.

"There have been moments when I
felt extremely homesick after the
tsunami and wanted to leave [Sri
Lanka]. I can't though. This country,
in some part, is my country too."
Rebecca Ennen 'O4
"I've already sold twenty sarongs," he said. "I'm looking to sell all of them to raise one thousand dollars to
donate to one of two causes."
He is considering giving money to the International
Red Cross and a World Bank-sponsored program revitalizing the Acehnese economy. In making his decision
between the two causes, Wallace plans to obtain input from
the people to whom he sells the sarongs.
"I think it's really nice to give people a piece of

Indonesian culture [in a Balinese sarong], allow them an
avenue by which they can donate to the cause and, at the
same time, give them an affordable price," he said.

Wallace has also considered hosting a poker tournament that would be used as a fundraiser for Aceh.
In addition, the International Club, Swarthmore Asian
Organization and Deshi are sponsoring a party this
Saturday in Paces with entrance fees going toward an asyet-undetermined small relief organization. "We want it to
be something that is specific to a certain region or group of
people," International club co-president Shlesha Thapaliya
'O7 said. "We're hoping to make it something worthwhile."
These groups are also planning to sponsor a faculty
potluck dinner at which proceeds made from each plate of
food served will also benefit the relief effort, according to
Thapaliya.
Donation boxes will also be placed in the Ville, Essie
Mae's, Sharpies Dining Hall, the Science Center and
Kohlberg coffee bars and the bookstore.
The three student organizations want to donate the
money collected to a small relief organization, Thapaliya
said. As a result, these organizations want to impact both
the lives of tsunami survivors and the effectiveness of a
small relief organization that is not equipped with the
same resources as the United Nations or the American Red
Cross.
"The region is devastated and is going to need support
for a long time," said Thapaliya. "For a year or two, the
entire world will have to support the region in some way

or another."

Ennen is unsure of what the future holds once her

Fulbright Scholarship is finished. However, she is certain
she will spend time helping relief efforts in Sri Lanka.

"There have been moments when I felt extremely homesick after the tsunami and wanted to leave [Sri Lanka]. I
can't though," she said. "This country, in some part, is my
country too."

College awarded Kresge grant to fund Parrish renovations
volunteers to raise the remaining $5.6 million for the renovations by December 2005,
according to director of corporate, foundation and government relations Lisa Smith.
The Kresge Grant is a "challenge grant"
because the college must raise $4.6 million
in outright gifts and pledges by December
2005 in order to receive the $1 million in
funding, according to Smith.
Smith said she hopes the grant will
inspire action from more alumni and
broaden the donor base beyond traditional
big contributors like Eugene Lang '3B and

Challenge as an opportunity, not
only to inject urgency and excitement into
our larger comprehensive campaign, but to
help us win deeper support among current
donors and to broaden our base through a
truly compelling appeal to new donors,"
Smith said. "I think the Kresge Challenge
will act as a wake-up call for those alumni
out there who are not yet aware of the compelling needs of the college in general and
this project in particular."
Associate Director of Capital Giving
Sue Clarey was confident that the challenge will appeal to younger donors. Since
the announcement of the grant, a Parrish
Preservation Project Committee has been
formed of alumni to help meet the
fundraising demands of the challenge.
According to Clarey, there are now
more than 40 committee members from a
variety of graduating classes and geographic regions who have volunteered as

Parrish

solicitors. "We came up with a list of about
50 alumni who we thought might be interested, and almost none of them have said
no," she said. "It's been an outstanding
response." Already, she said, $500,000 has
been raised by this committee.
Clarey attributes alumni's enthusiasm
for donating to the memories these alumni
have of Parrish as the physical and figurative focal point of the college. "That the
building is being conserved and will continue to house both residential space and
administrative offices to ensure daily
interaction among students, faculty and
staff is important to all alumni," she said.
"Some alumni have even contacted me
asking if they could have the door to their
old mailboxes once the mailrooms are gutted out
that's the kind of connections
people have with Parrish," she said.
In addition to relocating the mailboxes
to a central gathering place where the
Office of Admissions was previously located, the Parrish renovations will add mod-

em safety systems, elevators and a central
staircase leading to offices on the second
floor. Sproul's renovations include the creation of a new Alumni House for the college as well as other alumni services, such
as the Offices of Alumni Relations,
Publications, and News and Information
and the Office of Gifts and Alumni Records.
Previously the building housed the computer science department, which is now
located in the Science Center.

"I think the Kresge
Challenge will act as a
wake-up call for those
alumni out there who are
not yet aware of the
compelling needs of the
college in general and this
project in particular."

The college is also raising endowment
funds as part of the Parrish challenge in
order to adequately meet the increased
annual maintenance costs associated with
the newly renovated Parrish and Sproul
buildings as well as the New Dorm.
The Kresge Foundation, which has contributed to the college in the past, is an
independent, private foundation that seeks
to strengthen the capacity of charitable
organizations through its grants.

Political gridlock, funding shortage threaten SEPTA

delayed Fumo's bill by calling for

In a special meeting on Dec. 30,
Rendell sanctioned $l3 million in

temporary state funding to provide for an additional month of
negotiations to take place without
raising fares and cutting services,
according to the SEPTA Web site.
However, state subsidies have
failed to fill the budgetary gap
made by the lack of federal funding.
SaveTransit.org is

an organi-

zation dedicated to educating the
public on the financial shortcomings of SEPTA and organizing
supporters to call for increased
funding to help the ailing company. According to the SaveTransit
website, there have been no statelevel appropriation increases at
all in Pennsylvania for mass transit, as general operating subsidies
have only enjoyed a 1 percent

increase per year on average for
more than a decade.
Most regional transit systems
outside of Pennsylvania rely on a
much more stable source of capital
to run their businesses, as a set
amount of dedicated state funds
are usually guaranteed to trans-

portation authorities.

This allows them to be significantly less dependent on profits

from

fares.

Dedicated

funds

account for 60 percent of Los
Angeles' public transportation
budget, nearly 40 percent of
Boston's and more than 30 percent
of
New
York
City's.
Pennsylvania's systems are more
lacking in this department:
SEPTA's budget includes 13.75 percent in dedicated funds, while
Port
Pittsburgh's
Authority
Transit system receives only a percentage more.

SEPTA media representative
Jim Whittaker described the situation of operating on a year-toyear budget as "unwelcome."
"Eight of the past 10 years, we
were not given what we asked for.
What we are asking for is dedicated funding source," he said.
The state legislature in
Harrisburg has been brainstorming ideas to prevent the proposed
SEPTA cuts. State Sens. Vincent

Fumo and Stewart Greenleaf
issued a proposal on Jan. 12 suggesting that the state government
"hike the state portion of the realty transfer tax by a half-percent
from 1 percent to L 5 percent of the
sale price of real estate." This
plan, according to Fumo's Web
site, "would generate approximately $2OO million in additional

revenue annually," more than
enough to relieve SEPTA's debts.

Whittaker

welcomed

this

along with many other plans proposed in Harrisburg this week,
referring to it as "one of several
proposals that would absolutely
significantly help the situation."

Whittaker and SEPTA are seeking a solution that would allow
SEPTA to predict its operating

budget in advance, rather than
being at the whim of the state

budget committee every year.

Republicans in the state senate, fearing tax increases, have

THE

PHOENIX

audits and re-audits of the proposal. In an attempt to quell the
objections, Fumo proposed that
the necessary increases in real
estate transfer taxes would be
mainly concentrated in SEPTA's
and PAT's respective operating
regions. "More people will pay
this
tax
in
southeastern
Pennsylvania
and Allegheny
County than anywhere else, and

that's where most of the masstransit money will go," Fumo told

The Philadelphia Inquirer.
It appears the bill will still not
be without dissenters. "Neither
side [of the state legislature],
Democrat or Republican, wishes
to be responsible for any hike in
taxes," says Peter Javsicas, the
executive
of
director
Pennsylvania for Transportation
Solutions, a group that lobbies
lawmakers to dedicate additional

funds to public transportation.
"For any solution to be reached,

they have to realize that $62 million cannot be raised without
some increase," Javsicas said.
It is not yet clear whether
Fumo's bill will pass. Rendell has
held back on calling a special legislative session, though discussion of the proposals will begin
before the Feb. 27 deadline.
According to Christian Soura, a
state senate budget analyst, the
topic will be discussed on Jan. 27.
Soura is "hopeful" that SEPTA
will receive funding to prevent
the cuts, while also commenting,
"I don'tknow how likely that is."
According to Javsicas, one of
the obstacles impeding this
progress is "counterproductive,"
long-standing state legislation
outlawing the use of gasoline
taxes to fund public transportation. Javsicas argues that the prohibition is "counterintuitive in
nature" because the additional
use of mass transit would curb

gasoline consumption and reduce
two of the state legispollution

lature's main concerns.
The SEPTA situation is not

According
new.
to
PhillyTransit.com, in the past 15
years, Pennsylvania has seen two
pieces of legislation aimed at bailing SEPTA out of its sickly state
of affairs. The 1991 Pennsylvania
Act 26 created an agency that was
to fund public transportation by
collecting taxes on a hodgepodge
of consumer goods, including
tires, periodicals and realty. The
law resulted in further financial
shortcomings when a major
source of the agency's capital,
Pennsylvania's electrical industry, was deregulated, leaving
SEPTA with operating debts for
much of the early 19905.
SEPTA's only recourse in dealing with these debts was to raise
fares and cut services on a regular basis throughout the '9os.

SEPTA has fast become the fifth
most fare-reliant public trans-

portation agency in the country,
with 4L9 percent of its operating

costs coming from fares, according to PhillyTransit.com.

Housing tight for returning students
BY AARON WASSERMAN
awasserl@swarthmore.edu

Though there is less on-campus housing available this semester than there was
in the fall, Swarthmore is not currently
experiencing a "housing crunch" as it has
in recent years, according to Dean of
Student Life Myrt Westphal.
After having some trouble finding
appropriate spots for returning students,
Westphal issued the final housing assignments last Saturday but there are still a
few rooms available on campus.

"It did come down to the last minute
getting people housed," Westphal said. "I
knew there were enough beds, but not necessarily the ones people wanted." Some
students continued to seek room changes
after making selections in the December
lottery and others on the wait-list were
reluctant to accept available options.
Of the 83 students who studied abroad
last semester, 74 have returned, but only
67 students left this semester, producing a
net rise in the number of students which
contributed to the tighter accommodations.
"We were in better shape for the fall

a reverse
lottery than the spring one
from the tradition," Westphal said, noting
that Swarthmore students usually prefer
to spend a spring semester abroad.
All juniors returning from studyabroad programs found housing, but some
decided to form pairs and occupy one-

room doubles rather than inhabit singles
in Mary Lyon basement. "It wasn't my

first choice. I could've been in a single in
ML, but I wanted to be near my friends,
especially after coming back from
abroad," Laura Holzman 'O6 said of her
one-room double in Pittenger.
Housing changes this semester include
the appointment of Jen Stevenson 'O6 to be
the new Residential Assistant for Willets
First South. She replaced George Petel 'O5
who resigned from the position for personal reasons. Westphal contacted
Stevenson, one of last semester's alternate
RAs, in November regarding the opening.
After expressing interest, Stevenson was
chosen by the Housing Committee.

Training was not a logistical problem
for Stevenson because she was already
planning on returning to campus early for
women's basketball. She had three informational meetings with Westphal and met
with two other Willets RAs Emily Conlon
'O6 and Debra Farrelly 'O6 to discuss dormspecific issues, which served as a condensed version of RA orientation week.
"I'm sure it was a strange change for
everyone, but I think the hall is very
friendly. Most blocked together, so they're
all eager to socialize,"Stevenson said.

Despite recent housing successes, this
semester is most likely Westphal's last for
organizing students' housing needs, as she
and a selection committee are searching
for a new Housing Coordinator.
Although Westphal will leave her long-

held position, she will continue working
in the Dean's Office as the dean of student
life. Since former associate dean for student life Tedd Goundie left for Bates
College last summer, Westphal has fulfilled both positions' duties.
The search committee, composed of
four students and four faculty members,

has begun screening potential candidates'
resumes and conducting phone interviews, but Westphal would not reveal any
candidates' names.
Once the field narrows and the committee invites prospective coordinators to

participate in the selection process.

Every break, a friend of mine back

her latest boy toy. After a day of shopping
in downtown Tokyo, another mutual
female friend and I were to meet dream boy
#1024989 at a restaurant with her after he
got off from work. So I sat at the table,
patiently listening to my friend gush about
her newest trophy—how she was going to
visit him in France (where he lives), and
what he said to her the other day that was
"sooooo cute!" Still, I was willing to give
the poor guy a chance. After all, my friend
had a knack for picking nice sweet boys.
But when her dream boy finally showed
up, the evening quickly declined into the
two alternately bickering and telling each
other how much they loved each other

while a girlfriend shifts uncomfortably in

the lame excuse that I was too drunk from
the sangria (which was at least half true).
When I complained to my dad about the
incident, my despairingly unromantic

are prone to do and said, "You should

Philly rap scene: Head for the underground
BY ALEXIS PERNAS
apernasl@swarthmore.edu
I never used to be someone who would be associated
with liking rap music. I was solely a rock lover; one who
fit into the new wave punk scene- an "emo kid". Even
though I'm still a daily listener, I decided that it was time
to broaden the spectrum.
Over this summer my friend Lindsay exposed me to a
totally new genre of music: underground rap. I took a liking to it right away. When I went to Warped Tour, an annual punk fest held in different cities throughout the country
in August, I was surprised to see one of the artists live
whom I heard on Lindsay's CD player. His name is

Atmosphere, and he's one of the more nationally known
underground rappers. There was not a big crowd by the
stage where he was performing, but that didn't stop him
from giving my favorite performance of the afternoon.
To find out more about the underground rap scene in
Philly, I interviewed El Smooth, a producer /performer
who is studying music at Drexel University. A native of
Philadelphia, he has always been interested in rap music
and recently started making his own beats not only for
himself but also for other up-and-coming underground
artists. Our conversation was held in his car, listening to
underground artists as we drove around the South Street
area. El Smooth, (as he's been known since grammar
school, when he "always knew the right thing to say,")

THE

began his musical career in piano, taking lessons in
Philadelphia for thirteen years. Because of his strong
musical background, El Smooth prefers underground
artists with musical talents. It's necessary, he says, to "feel

...

20% of the [female] concertgoers." Currently, there are no
women on Def Jucks Records, the most prominent underground label. There is currently only one female emcee in
Philadelphia: Jean Grae.
I was surprised, however, at El Smooth's response
when I asked him if the audience was generally a specific type of crowd. He said, "You know, that's the beauty of

There has been a lot of racial cohesion in
hip-hop in the last two or three years. It's pretty much
everybody's game now. The cool thing about the underground scene is that you'll see emo, you'll see metal kids,
you'll see hip hop to the bone kids, all kinds of people,
jazz heads going to hip hop shows, everybody. It's a really beautiful thing." He said that many kids who had the
same musical interests as I did were now pouring into
the scene because they are getting tired of groupies
plaguing new wave punk and want to listen to something

drummers who have been drummin' for 10 years and can't
hold a steady beat. And then I know people who pick up
drum sticks and just do it. That rhythmic aspect is just natural."

Underground hip-hop, he admited, is more male-dominated than mainstream music. "Females are certainly outnumbered at hip hop shows.," El Smooth said. "Certainly.
And that's not the case in mainstream. Like the Jay-Z, R
Kelly tour. But MF Doom? You and your friend will be like

new.
I found out that El Smooth's prediction was quite accurate when I went to a show featuring Brother Ali and MF
Doom. The audience was mostly composed of white, middle-class teenagers. There were African American fans
present, but they stayed more towards the back of the
venue. As El Smooth had predicted, there were both old
and young fans there, but I was one of only eight females I
counted in the audience.
What does all of this mean? Get out to a show in
Philadelphia and support the underground scene.

Ask yourself: What would Jesus wear?
there are "baby"s in a Britney Spears song,
and the numbers continue to grow. There's
no need to name names; we all know a
Swarthmore Jesus.
What we can't explain, however, is the
personal appeal of this aesthetic. Open
your eyes, look at the Jesus sitting across
from you, and ask yourself, "What's up
with that?" The road to fashion salvation is
a long one, and it involves looking both
within and without.
Am I exaggerating? Perhaps, you wonder, the long-haired look I'm pigeonholing
is simply a throwback to the hippy sixties. No, my friend, this is a legitimate
phenomenon. It passes the test of all noteworthy fashion trends: imitation by the
rich and famous. Perhaps it was Madonna
who bias-famously pioneered the move-

Conservative yet outrageous, this manner
of dress has the power to make you righteously stand out from the crowd.
It's the Jesus look.
Let me clarify. Long-haired, sandal-clad,

inaccurately) Anglo Jesus clones are popping up everywhere, and for once
Swarthmore College appears to be ahead of
the curve on this fashion trend. There are

attire didn't end in the eighties. It can be
seen today in Paris Hilton's self-designed
diamond-crusted crosses and the late
0.D.8.'s decision to temporarily change

his name to the not-so-fitting Lil' Baby
Jesus. There is something hypocritical,
something

irijierentry

shocking

(and

therefore fashionable) about invoking
Jesus for vain purposes. Hip-ocrisey
rules, and diamond-studded Jesus is in.
Hollywood isn't the only spot where the
Messiah is on fiyah, and many choose to
use the Jesus aesthetic not for ostentatious
purposes, but to express a friendly, humorous outlook. Like the "Buddy Christ" in
Matt Damon's movie "Dogma", your modern Jesus lets the good times flow like the
locks of his uncombed brown hair.
Urban Outfitters eloquently sums up

this sensibility with its ever-popular

"Jesus is my homeboy" t-shirt. Not your
brand of Christly couture? Try the harder
to find, slightly more irreverent "My other
Jesus is a Camaro" tee to take part in the
fad without committing to the look.
You can crucify a fashion trend but
you cannot kill it: styles tend to survive
and mutate. Will this be the case with the
Jesus phenomenon? Instead of the tres

Ariana Afghani restaurant: Slow but delicious
BY SUSANNAH GUND

sgundl@swarthmore.edu

Afghanistan doesn't get off easy in the American news,

but the Old City Afghan restaurant Ariana does the motherland proud with affordable, flavorful dishes in a relaxing
atmosphere. Plan for a full evening out— the service gives
you time to prepare a passport application for your next
trip to the 'Stans.
The restaurant is named after the eastern provinces
of the ancient Persian empire, collectively referred to as
Ariana. Co-owner Kadir Sultani's family-run eatery is
small but inviting, with photographs and traditional
Afghani clothing on the walls. For the best experience in
the space, make a reservation in advance for the elevated window table which comfortably seats four to six. Yes,
it's a bit strange to be glanced at by every passerby who

looks at the menu, but it is relaxing to take off your shoes
and lean back into the cushions and the carpet around
the low table.
Entrees at Ariana run between $9.25 for the vegetarian
dishes and $14.25 for a kebab sampler. Most lie in the $ll
range, and with bread and salad included, they make a
great meal for not too much money. The appetizers, however, should not be missed. Try the aashak ($2.75), which
are not your typical scallion pancakes. Mint and a yogurt
and meat sauce add exciting flavor and get eaten quickly.
The bulanee (spiced turnovers) ($2.75) come with potato
and onion (bulanee kachalou) or scallion and herbs (bulanee gandana), and both versions are delicious. The indecisive can try a $8.50 appetizer sampler with a selection of

three

appetizers

and salad.

The entrees require some basic knowledge to get
through. Chalow signifies white basmati rice, while
palow means the rice will be brown, most likely because
of flavoring with cinnamon and other spices. With that
simple vocabulary, look for kadu (pumpkin), on the
menu. The chalow kadu ($9.25), pumpkin in a yogurt
sauce, is delicious, a bit sweet, and certainly a taste sensation that you won't find elsewhere. For vegans and any-

one else who likes good spinach, the chalow sabzi ($9.25)
is also quite tasty. It's cooked with lemon, garlic and
spices in a way that retains the spinach taste more
strongly than in other dishes. Carnivores will be satisfied
by the meat, fish and chicken options. Lamb lovers will
enjoy the delicate marinate in the lamb kebab ($13.25),
which is great on the vegetables that come with it. The
chicken kofta ($12.95) also has a marinade, which is spicy
without being hot. Whatever you decide upon, be prepared for thin plates of rice and small dishes of food—ideal for sharing and eating as slowly as they are served.
It is definitely possible to eat everything put before you
without feeling stuffed, and those of you not so easily
sated might even be bit hungry afterward. However, you

won't be disappointed by the desserts.
The firnee pudding ($2.50), baklava ($2.50), sheeryak ice

January 20, 2005

cream ($3.75) and jellabee pastry ($3.50) are all sweet and
delicious (and yes, I sampled them all). The baklava is different from other versions that I have tried, perhaps due to
the sprinkling of pistachio that flavors the firnee and
sheeryak as well. Ice cream lovers might be surprised by
the low levels of sweetness in the sheeryak, the taste of
which is original to the palate. The jellabee is your basic
fried dough, but sweetened with sugar and rosewater for a
more delicate experience than you'll find at the county fair
or the stand down the block.
If the soft Afghani music has kept you from losing
patience with the slow service, close the evening with
Afghan chai ($1) or, for the over-21 set, finish off the
BYOB wine. You may not be thrilled into coming back
every weekend, but for a night out in Philly Ariana is
certainly a transporting experience. And yes, for the
cheap, there is a lunch menu with great deals ranging
from $5.95 to $6.95.

MUSIC REVIEWS

Bloom and Ozark Sheiks
put art over mass appeal
BY JOE KILLE
jkillel@swarthmore.edu

In the brief note accompanying his new album, "Before Sleep
Comes," singer and guitarist Luka Bloom wishes the listener sweet
dreams. It's not often that you're given an album that's being touted
by its record company (and, even more shockingly, its artist) as an
album of "non-performances" whose purpose is to "bring you closer to
sleep."
But that's exactly what this album delivers. When I read the press
release for Before Sleep Comes I imagined that Mr. Bloom had unwittingly created a compilation of dull and unimportant songs, and that
his record company was doing all it could to salvage the wreck by
marketing it as a "chill-out" album. On the contrary, the circumstances of the album speak to its intentional tranquility. While suffering from aggravated tendonitis in his right hand, Mr. Bloom was
forced to modify his picking style and play music on

a nylon-stringed classical
guitar instead of his usual
harsher-sounding
steelstring. It was from these
conditions that his new
approach to playing arose

and the concept for "Before
Sleep Comes" was born. All
the songs were recorded
late at night, when, as Mr.
Bloom puts it, "I was tired
myself."
The music presented is
beautiful and, yes, tranquil.
Sleep
"Before
Comes"
achieves exactly what Mr.
Bloom intended. You don't

s much listen to the songs as feel them, losing the lyrics in the rise
and fall of his voice. Bloom originals like "Nora, Be Still Now" and
"Camomile" are seamlessly intertwined with traditionalIrish ballads,
like "She Moved Through the Fair" and "The Water is Wide."
Another album that blends arrangements of traditional music with
similar originals is Ozark Sheiks, the debut by the Arkansas duo
Uncle Cuckleburr's Champion Possum Carvers. Where Luka Bloom
whispered to his guitar, these guys sing, gurgle, pop, scream, and
yodel to an assortment of banjos, guitars, mandolins, jugs, kazoos
(lovingly referred to as "throat fiddles"), and more as they plow
through twenty old-time originals and lesser-known traditionals.
My first reaction after
hearing the opening track
"Run, Nellie, Run" was
the incredible desire to
see these guys play live.
Pictures of the two person
band reveal sometimes-

complex arrangements of
jugs and kazoos in harmonica holders to add a

little

inappropriate-

sounding percussion here

and there.
I can't speak to the
authenticities of their
performances.
What
UCCPS set out to do is
record a style of music
prevalent in America
before recording equipment was readily available. Their spirit takes them back to that time,
and shines through especially on tracks like "Sycamore Tree," "Ozark
Sheiks" (an original), and "No Low Down Hanging Around/Bay Rum

Blues."
It's heartening to think that there are musicians in the world more
concerned with the integrity of their music than with instantaneous
marketability or derivative appeal. Both UCCPS and Luka Bloom set
out to achieve very specific goals with their albums, and these goals
seem more important to the performers than to the listener. Mr.
Bloom sought to record a period in his life when he was forced to quiet
down and go slowly; he finds a place before sleep worth preserving.
UCCPS look to preservation, but theirs is a timeand place that no one
(not even them) can be sure they've heard before. In both cases, it's a
lovely and sometimes exhilarating journey to take with them.

ALEX GINSBERG
Sleeping Around Campus
It's 2 a.m. on a particularly buzzing Thursday
night just before finals. The stress is building up
for most of the student body, but not for me: it's
great to be a first-semester freshman. For some reason, this is the night everyone has chosen to "let
loose," and I'm not one to get in the way. No, with
lots of partying opportunities, a fresh Beirut list,
and not a bit of sleep in my eyes, it's a great night
to be pass/fail.
It is always hard for me to deny myself the
excitement of a late night. Back at home in Jtown, New Jersey, where a 10 o'clock curfew is
considered generous, the wee hours of the morning are the stomping grounds of boredom. Call
them old-fashioned disciplinarians, but my parents have never been keen on "late night frater-

nizing."
I grew up deprived of all-nighters and 3 a.m. pizzas. What better time is there to make up for all
that than my first semester in college? And, in the
spirit of the "Dead Poet's Society," carpe noctem is
the motto.
Many a night was swept away with ping pong
balls, much-too-loudmusic, and obviously, chastity.
During this particular week, the fruit of my
late-night labors was a net loss of exactly four
classes due to (hang)oversleep, two in a certain
9:30 course which was giving me trouble. With a
final exam looming, I decided that it would be best
not to miss three classes in a row. Contemplating,
I realized that my ideal waking time is much later
than 9:30, and that crawling into bed at 4:45 a.m.
January 20, 2005

And this is what I did. Err, attempted to do. Rain
had begun to fall, and my jacket was nowhere to be
found. When I arrived at my early-morning Mecca,
the first three doors I tried were locked. Undeterred,
I made it inside at last. On a piece of paper, I wrote
"Please wake me up for my 9:30 class." I stretched
out on a cushy chair and fell asleep.
The woman who woke me up was very nice
about it, as I remember. "Excuse me, I need to clean
there. Excuse me, I need to clean there. Excuse me,
I need to clean there," went the alarm. Half-unconscious, the motivation which two hours earlier had
driven my ingenious quest was now gone. Some
lucky person probably found my autographed note
the next morning.
I'm sure there are many who can relate to my
misfortune, who know that it's really hard to get
out from under the warm, comfy covers. It's for
you, late-sleepers of Swarthmore, that I embark on

your morning class.
Each week, I will pitch tent (or blanket) some-

where on campus. Then I will report back to the
public, rating each place based on several factors:
comfort level; quality of sleep; and whether I make
it to class the next morning. Lang, Kohlberg, the

it must to rest peacefully yet be ensured a prompt

JBJOO!LRE¥IEW

Chaim Potok's 'Asher Lev' highlights
the tensions between art and religion
BY RAHUL D'SILVA
rdsilval@swarthmore.edu

As cliched as it might sound, "My Name is Asher Lev"
is, in the most basic sense, a story of a boy's struggle to
find his identity. Born into a community of Hasidic Jews,
Asher is the son of Aryeh Lev, a man who has devoted his
life to saving Jews in Europe and Russia and spreading the
message of God. Fiercely religious and deeply bound to the
spiritual leader of their Ladover sect, the Rebbe, Aryeh
Lev is a man who expects his son to study Torah, and perhaps someday to dedicate his own life to the Rebbe's service. Asher Lev, however, is born with a gift. It is not for
learning the Torah, not even for mathematics or writing,
but for painting. His
father

talent

rejects this
outright,

calling it a tool of
the sitra achra, the

Devil.

As Asher grows,

so does the divide
between him and his
family, and his entire
community. Potok
masterfully portrays
the varying degrees
ofconflict within this
struggle.
Asher's
mother, who realizes
his obvious gift,
struggles to reconcile
his
interests in
Reuben's nudes and
paintings of the crucifixion with her

12

A major theme of the book is Asher's conflict between
his calling and his responsibility to his Jewish community.
Taken on as a student by Jacob Kahn, a world-renowned
painter and sculptor, Asher Lev is thrown headfirst into
the, 'goyische' world of art. Painting is its own religion,
with its own guidelines and strictures. With its Christian
and pagan subject matter and traditions, Asher's painting
is seen as worthless to his community and to Jews at large.
When Jacob Kahn first asks him towards whom he has a
responsibility, Asher replies that he is responsible to Jews,
quoting from the Talmud that "All Jews are responsible,
one for the other." Kahn shouts at him, "As an artist you
are responsible to no one and to nothing, except to yourself
and to the truth as you see it. An artist is responsible to his
art."
Along the way, Potok poses many questions. Is a life
devoted to one's gift and less fastidious in rituals and services any less devoted to God? Are Asher's portrayals of suffering in the world a useless activity in the eyes of God and
a lack of responsibility towards his community? "One man
is not better than another because he is a doctor while the
other is a shoemaker," says the Rebbe. "One man is not better than another because he is a lawyer while the other is a
painter. A life is measured by how it is lived for the sake of
heaven."
Through this entire narrative, Potok gives the reader an
astonishing view into Asher's soul, calm and yet raging passionately at times. Asher's growth is portrayed flawlessly to
the reader, and it is his development as a painter, as he rises
in the world of art and expresses his gift, that portrays his
growing maturity. We do not see him as a Jew or a non-Jew,
but for what he is a human being.
When the reader finishes the last few pages, Asher Lev
has not just become a great artist. He has also developed a
beautiful soul, able to see and paint pain, and sorrow, and
love, and suffering. No longer a boy, he has now become a
man.

Digest indigestion
After years of complaining about the almost comically inefficient and inconvenient reserved-students e-mail
system, we're glad to see the school trying to improve it.
Unfortunately, the reserved-students e-mail digests we're
seeing are only the very first, most rudimentary step to
doing so.
The root of the problem has always been giving large
numbers of people the absolute power to flood student
mailboxes at will, without any sort of standardization
that might make it easier for students to sift out the messages that apply to them personally
The first step of collating all reserved-students emails into a single message helps a little, yes. However,
the messages still aren't being organized or edited for
content. At the very least e-mails should be stripped of
HTML tags so the large numberof people using text-only
clients, including ITS's own Swatmail Web interface, can
read them more easily.
Our ideal would be if the reserved-students e-mails
followed the rules of the Swarthmore Weekly News, or
were even folded into the Weekly News. We'd like to see
someone take responsibility for editing the announcements, organizing them by relevance to various groups,
and outright rejecting the frivolous ones.
In fact, our absolute ideal would be to have all of this
information posted on a Web site, so that interested students, being, presumably, educated adults, could take it
upon themselves to check for important updates at their
own discretion. The capability to mass e-mail the student
body should exist, but should be restricted to true emergencies
and the standard for a true emergency should
be made absolutely clear, since even after the introduction of the digests we've still seen a couple of unnecessary, separate mass e-mails floating around.
However, if the administration feels that they simply
can't trust us to read something important that's not emailed to us, the least they can do is spend a little more
energy making the system easier to use. As it stands, one
long
disorganized
junk
only
e-mail
is
marginally preferable to several short disorganized junk
e-mails.

Unfair fees
We understand that the borough of Swarthmore has
been incurring higher expenses lately and looking for
ways to raise money, but unfairly taking advantage of
college students with cars isn't the way to do it.
By any standard, a municipality that jacks up parking fees 150 percent all at once, with little or no warning,
is acting unethically. This is doubly true when the population most affected, college students with cars, had no
voice in the decision-making process.
There's little element of choice in this. With the hike
coming so quickly, students had little opportunity to
move their cars anywhere over break. Any student who
depends on a private car for any reason, be it business or
pleasure, regardless of other possible financial hardships, must now somehow cough up fifty dollars a month
for a parking space.
With the SEPTA service cuts looming, this becomes a
much more significant problem, reaching the point
where almost any student who has to travel at all will be
forced to shell out these fees. We've all talked about the
too-often unfriendly relationships between town and
gown, but in this case it's definitely the borough authorities instigating the tension. The college arguably does a
great deal for the Ville, providing large amounts ofbusiness, investing in efforts like the Co-op, and opening its
space and providing labor for local programs, and right
now we're failing to see an equivalent commitment from
the other side. This cavalier attitude toward college stuassuming that because we go to an expensive
dents
school and own cars we must be good for any fee they ask
does nothing to make us feel like we're members of the
•

same community.
At the very least, they couldhave taken more effort to
involve us in the decision, or phased in these hikes more
slowly to allow us to adjust. A sudden hike like this
makes it seem like we're being milked for easy cash. We
thought our fellow Swarthmoreans were above that.

one was busy getting it on while you were still playing with your
junior biochem set. Maybe that one person was you
doubtful.
Regardless of your own sexual habits, it's pretty obvious that
teenagers have sex, yet the Bush administration persists in
pushing programs that ignore this reality. Since 2001 the Bush
administration has more than doubled federal funding in support of abstinence-only education. These programs now serve as
required sex-ed curricula for 35 percent of public school districts, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute
despite the
fact that research has found some of the most popular abstinence-only curricula to be factually inaccurate, ineffective in
...

delaying the onset of sexual activity and explicitly unsuccessful
in preventing teen pregnancy and the transmission of STIs

among the many teens out there who do have sex.
The latest report on abstinence-only education was released
at the request of California Rep. Henry Waxman, who noted that
none of the abstinence-only curricula supported by federal funds
are subject to fact checks or approval by the government. The
report reviews thirteen of the most popular curricula and
reveals that over 80 percent contain major factual errors
at
least one shamefully refers to the male reproductive cell as
"Speedy the Sperm." These types of errors have been widely
publicized by groups supporting comprehensive sex education

despite the Bush administration's continued ignorance of the
problem. Perhaps an even more surprising finding of Waxman's
report is the inclusion of gender stereotypes within the curriculum's supposedly "factual" material that has nothing to do with
promoting healthy sexual behavior. Young women, for example,
are told by one curriculum that their top five basic needs
include "affection," "conversation," "honesty and openness," and
"family commitment." The list of relationship needs for men
includes such purely masculine necessities as "sexual fulfillment" and "physical attractiveness." Another abstinence-only

curriculum offers its own take on the differentiated "basic
needs" of the sexes, which include "financial support" as a top
priority for women and "domestic support" as a primary concern for the men.
One of our favorite examples of sex-irrelevant info provided
by the curricula involves the story of a princess who slowly
drives away her knight with her bleak and incessant nagging
offering her own litany of ideas for how a dragon should be slain.
The knight, having successfully slaughtered a number of threatening dragons, nevertheless feels "ashamed" for submitting to
her commands. In the end, he leaves the princess for a simple village maiden. The moral: "Occasional suggestions and assistance
may be alright, but too much of it will lessen a man's confidence
or even turn him away from his princess."
So what's the big deal with gender-based issues like this being
taught in our schools? For one, these curricula encourage young
men to follow the "norms" laid out for them in their textbooks
to view women as primarily emotional creatures who value
traits like "honesty and openness" at some deeper level than
men do. They also promote the idea that men should place physical attractiveness at a priority when developing relationships
with women and expect them to provide the "domestic support"
that men so desperately need. Young women, in turn, are taught
that "financial support" will come out of their relationships with
men, placing unfair expectations on their future partners as
their own aspirations of financial independence are obscured.
Millions in federal funding are being wasted on abstinence-only
education which is inaccurate and factually misleading
we
just didn'trealize how irrelevant and transparently sexist it was
as well.

man.

When a man asks
himself this question

sincerely, not rhetorically, he is asking him-

TARU TAYLOR

Gadfly

self whether he's man
or boy, soldier or mass
man of quiet desperation. He answers "yes"
if the former, "no" if the
latter. "Yes" if his prime

directive is duty, "no" if it's pursuit of happiness. "Yes"
if he values honor and shame, "no" if he values utility
and guilt. "Yes" if he's ethical, "no" if pathetic. The modern query which echoes Cain and likewise divides
humanity is the "Prisoner's Dilemma."
Formulated in the 1950s by a game theorist named
A.W. Tucker, the Prisoner's Dilemma asks you to imagine that you and your partner have been accused of a
crime. You and your partner cannot communicate with
each other while a policeman interrogates you separately. He gives each of you two options: Remain silent or

utation in society, still more for virtue, his character
before the god of his ethical tribunal. He fears shame
more than he fears death. The samurai institutionalized
seppuku, the ritual suicide by disembowelment otherwise known as "hara-kiri," as the touchstone of
Japanese shame culture because seppuku demonstrates
the primacy of death over dishonor. Bushido, the true
name of Japanese shame culture, lives on in the samurai who now masquerade as businessmen.
The man ofguilt culture complicates his decision. All
kinds of "cost-benefit analyses" enter into his "judgment
and decision making." He wonders what his partner will
do. But the man of shame culture is clear, for his decision is based on his sense of duty regardless of what his
partner will or will not do. His individualism is based on
an objective code of ethics and dialogue with his god.
The so-called individualism of the man of guilt culture is
based on personal feelings and seemingly nonstop interior monologue. What he calls "individualism" is narcissism. To him shame culture in the modern world is
like Don Quixote tilting at windmills. He ridicules
honor; thus he believes not in shame. He exclusively
values utility and his own sense of guilt.
Like bushido and the Spartan culture of ancient
Greece, the Maroon culture of America is a shame

culture. Maroons are men of honor. Their heroes are

paragons of virtue. Shame culture is based on loyalty
and brotherhood. Cain was not Abel's keeper, for physical blood is not enough. It takes metaphysical blood,

snitch. He tells each of you that if you both remain
silent, you both get three years in prison. If you both
snitch, you both get six years. If you remain silent but
your partner snitches, you get twenty years while your
partner walks away scot-free. Vice versa if you snitch
but your partner remains silent. Keeping in mind that
Socrates and Jesus were criminals, the morality or
immorality of the crime is irrelevant. What do you do?
Whether you are your brother's keeper or not
depends on whether you are of"shame culture" or "guilt
culture." Ruth Benedict's "The Chrysanthemum and the
Sword" originates the distinction by describing Japan
as a prototype of shame culture as opposed to Western

guilt culture. When one applies her idea to the

"esprit de corps," to bond men as brothers and brother's
keepers.
Every Negro the world over is either Marcus Garvey
or W.E.B. Dußois. That means that he is either his
brother's keeper or he is not. The Negro who is his
brother's keeper is Black. He who is not is colored or
African-American. Thus, he embodies Dußoisian "double-consciousness," i.e. .Orwellian doublethink. He
embodies Dußoisian "two-ness," i.e. cultural schizophrenia. Life for the Talented Tenth is a hopelessly confused Prisoner's Dilemma. For the Garveyite, life is
brotherhood and sacrifice. His silence is akin to
omerta, the Mafia code of silence. For him there is no
Prisoner's Dilemma. To Abel, Cain was brother by
blood, rival in spirit. So, to the Garveyite, is the

Prisoner's Dilemma, it is easy to see that the man of
shame culture always chooses silence. Silence is honorable. Snitching is shameful. He lives for honor, his rep-

Swatties deserve a better name
Dear Editor:
I'm class of '9O.
My class helped start the date-rape program, the
Chester projects, divestiture from South Africa
In
short, we've kind of been a pain in the neck.
I'm e-mailing, sad to say, with another pain-in-theneck request: Banish the term "Swattie."
It's base. It's ugly. It makes us sound like a lot of
things we're not. Would you call someone who went to
Harvard the "H-meister"? No. Would you call someone
...

who went to Ball State a "Bailer"? Yes. Exactly my point.
I won't belabor this matter. Unless, of course, the
term persists. Then I'll take my good-natured petulance
to the streets, following in the footsteps of so many of my
classmates. In the immortal words of the 1988 divestment committee, "Don't make us do it."

President Bloom's administration has done a thou-

sand good things for this college. Please, for our dignity,
do this one more.

Saffran exemplified Swarthmore ideals
Dear Editor:

was saddened by the loss of Professor
Bernard Saffran, and everything you heard about him
was true. One thing that separated Bernie from most of
indeed, from most people
the faculty
was the
astoundingly genuine good wishes that he had for
everyone. This manifested itself not only when he chatted with students, but when he went beyond casual
conversation. He got to know his students so well that
years after graduation he would still remember to ask
about their siblings. He stayed a mentor at a time when
most students lose touch with Swarthmore. He became
a friend.
This caring goodwill was ever present with Saffran.
Just a month ago, one of us came back to campus to
Everyone

meet with Bernie. When the topic of the New Dorm

came up, Saffran said that the dorm should be named
after an old professor of the College, somebody who had
been here for a long time and truly embodied what
makes Swarthmore great. It would be fitting, after he
thoughtfully and selflessly suggested this honor for
January 20, 2005

somebody else, to give it to Bernie. The current students surely miss him already, and decades of alumni,
faculty, and the administration remember him fondly
and would like to memorialize him in some way.
If his surviving family approves, we are asking the
college to name the New Dorm after Professor Saffran.
This was also suggested last month in a letter to the
editor ("Honor Saffran with dorm name," Dec. 3, pg.
14); we want to really make this happen.
Bernie is unsurpassed in how well he represents the

Swarthmore ideal of academic excellence made personal and individual. We request that the Student
Council, President Bloom, the principal donor and anyone else involved in the naming process to not only put

his name in the running but, ultimately, to pick it. It
would be a lasting tribute to a man who selflessly gave
so much to the Swarthmore community.

Once upon an election
Once upon a time, there was
a kingdom floating on a sea of
uncertainty. Some of the people
were red and some were blue
and most of them were scared
and dissatisfied with their
access to health care, education,
tomatoes and free time. All of
them were in need of a good
fairytale.
Fiction has always been a
vital tool of political persuasion.

A case for private intervention
BY ANDREW SNIDERMAN

asniderl@swarthmore.edu

The Genocide Intervention Fund should not have to
exist. Failure has spawned this initiative.
Four months ago, Colin Powell and the State
Department concluded that "genocide has occurred and
may still be occurring in Darfur," the western region of
Sudan. Strongly worded U.N. resolutions, vacuous
threats of economic sanctions and increased humanitarian aid efforts followed, but have done little or nothing to
stop the violence.
has claimed
The conflict now in its 23rd month
the lives of 300,000 and displaced over two million. A former Director of African Affairs at the National Security
Council calls Darfur "Rwanda in slow motion."
To its great credit, the African Union broke with the
international community's prevailing pattern of paralyzing equivocation. Last summer, the AU established itself
as the principal mediator between Darfur's warring parties and announced in September its plan to send a 3,600member peacekeeping mission. In November, the U.N.
Security Council endorsed the expanded AU mission and

mandate.
On Jan.

1L Jan Pronk, the U.N. Special
Representative for the Sudan, told the Security Council
that the enhanced African Union Mission in Darfur
(AMIS II) "has done more than any other outside agent
to improve the security situation on the ground."
Unfortunately, effusive praise from world leaders has
not translated into adequate assistance.
To date, only a third of the personnel of AMIS II have
arrived in Darfur. A recent U.N. secretary-general's
report listed "shortages of communications equipment,
ground transport, fixed-wing aircraft, aviation fuel and
medical capability" as major impediments to the success

of the AU mission.
This inexcusable neglect of the only credible mechanism willing and able to improve security in Darfur has
and will continue to condemn

needlessly cost lives

Darfuris to death.
It is this policy failure that gave birth to the GIF. This
tax-exempt organization whose supporters include the
ranking congressman on the Subcommittee on Africa, a
Nobel Peace Prize nominee, a retired U.S. army general,
and two former Senior Directors ofAfrican Affairs at the
National Security Council will collect private funds to
help finance the UN-supported AU peacekeeping mission and pressure governments to pursue a comprehensive action plan to end the genocide.

16

Why is the GIF focusing its efforts on supporting a
peacekeeping mission rather than donating to existing
aid organizations? Simply put, humanitarian assistance
is a necessary but insufficient response to genocide.
Indeed, without an enlarged peacekeeping presence
to secure the delivery of aid convoys, the humanitarian
efforts in Darfur may collapse. In December, the United
Nations Food Program and Save the Children suspended
their relief operations due to security concerns.
According to Jan Egeland, U.N. Undersecretary for
Humanitarian Affairs, the suspension of aid will result
in monthly mortality rates of some 100,000 people, up
from a current estimate of 35,000.
The GIF is currently in talks with the AU to determine precisely how and where its funds will be spent. To
be sure, private citizens cannot provide the requisite
financing to field an entire peacekeeping mission. That
is why the GIF hopes to leverage its financial contributions into a powerful lobbying tool to pressure governments to pursue a comprehensive action plan to end the
genocide in Darfur. The GIF seeks to strengthen and catalyze government and U.N. action, not replace it.
The GIF will signal to national governments and

international

organizations that there is a passionate
and committed constituency that insists on immediate
action in the face of genocide.
It is our hope that an innovative initiative like the
GIF will goad the world into action. Swarthmore College,
with its legacy of social justice, seems a fitting place to

launch this project.
Still, whether we care to admit it or not, Swarthmore
is filled with ineffectual flashbulbs of moral outrage, the
type of people Arthur Koestler famously called
"Screamers" during World War 11.
Koestler lamented that the frustrated minority who
protested Nazi atrocities
the Screamers could never
manage to capture an enduring commitment from their
audiences. "You can convince them for an hour,"

Koestler said, but then "their mental half-defense begins
to work and in a week the shrug of incredulity has
returned."
I am an optimist, but let usassume the worst. Perhaps
Koestler is right. Perhaps opponents to genocide must
resign themselves to Screamer status.
But the Screamers in Koestler's day never had the
Internet. An hour is not a long time
but it is long
enough to visit GenocidelnterventionFund.org, donate
to the GIF and send a letter to a government representa-

tive.

The clock is ticking.

Exhibit A: Saddam Hussein. That's right, our current dictator-of-choice is also an avid writer of romance novels. In
"Zabibah and the King," which followed on the heels of the first
Gulf War, the heroine (who represents Iraq) falls in love with
her king (yep, Saddam), only to be abducted and raped by an
evil man who has claimed her in marriage (guess who). The latest to hit the shelves, "Be Gone, Demons!", details the adventures of Salim, an ancient nobleman, in his quest to defeat his
enemy tribes
otherwise known as Jews and Americans.
Saddam's got the form down pat; "Zabibah" even begins with
"Once upon a time."
Critics agree that Saddam's no Shakespeare. According to
Jojo Moyes of the Romance Novelists' Association, "His writing
was the literary equivalent of those lurid fantasy murals he had
painted all over his palaces." And despite Saddam's despotic
grasp on consumers, "Zabibah" was no bestseller
not even in
Iraq. Still, the fact remains that Saddam can weave a fairytale,
whereas many of our would-be leaders do not even try.
George W. Bush, too, tells a jolly good story.
Hark! he cries. Out of the dust of 9-11 we shall rise well-clad,
well-financed, God-blessed and smiling, with squeaky-new WalMart sneakers and a chicken in every pot (or, at least, in every
styrofoam KFC container)! We will spread the good word of
democracy across the vast earth! Good will triumph, evil will
fall and no one will go home without a goody bag. If you're free
of vicious mental background dialogue
listening only to the
story
it's hard not to say amen.
Others on the right buy into storytelling, full force. In his
soul-and-ear-wrenching ballad, "Let the Eagle Soar," John
Ashcroft conjures up a bruised and weathered nation that is
nevertheless "too young to die," a nation that is "healing" but
has "still got a lot of climbing left to do." The song's got God, a
triumphant quest and flying, all within a mere 11 lines.
The left needs a story. I am not arguing for fabrication and
deception. Telling a story does not have to mean blind nationalism or Saddam-style female objectification. It does not have to
mean lying.
Lots of leftist folks have been turning to public prose lately,
hoping to popularize their political messages. There are the
puppeteers, the radical cheerleaders, that anti-Bush Eminem
video that turned haters into groupies. But something's missing. Frustrated liberals argue that it's not fair
Bush gets to
tell a story because his specialty is linear oversimplification,
while Kerry can't tell one because his ideas are complex and
can't snuggle into a linear narrative.
But how can we believe this when art, film and literature
have been questioning linearity for years? Fiction does not
mandate simplification
it can break it down. Many of the best
stories are rich with ambiguity. Who decided that, as far as politics is concerned, linear narratives are the only way to go? One
,

basic difference between Bush supporters and Kerry supporters
was that the latter wouldn't stand for oversimplified messages.
Here lies the challenge. It's going to be hard to write a fairytale that doesn't end with happily ever after. But it's worth the
effort: In creating tales that blend fantasy and realism, strive
toward goals but acknowledge obstacles, leave cynicism behind
but avoid single-minded propaganda, we may not only awaken
more Americans to liberal ideas, we may also straighten out a
lot of our own beliefs.
Besides, considering the competition, the challenge is hard
to resist. We can so write a better romance novel than Saddam
Hussein. Maybe even one that people will buy.

Surprisingly enough, during its

nessed the largest amount of rainfall the island has had in years.
According to swimmer Andy "the

Swat snow fun
BY TORI MARTELLO
vmartell@swarthmore.edu
Winter on the East Coast has been regularly
described to me as freezing cold with some white,
flaky stuff that tries to make all the dead plants
look pretty. So forgive me if, over break, I had no
intention of looking forward to a "spring" semester consisting of the coldest months of the year,
January and February. Instead, I was relaxing in
the warm weather of California, putting the idea
of snow as far from my mind as possible.
However, after talking with various members
of the Swarthmore community, I now write as a
more informed student who has been slightly
persuaded that there may be a few activities that
actually become more enjoyable because of the
but I'm still skeptical.
snow
First of all, there are no outdoor winter sports
here at Swarthmore, so the coaches seem to share
my idea that snow is not something to be trifled
with. Even the outdoor sports athletes go inside
to the weight room to stay in shape, opting not to
break a sweat by just putting on the necessary
layers of cold-friendly clothing. Only the track
team's distance runners are strong enough to
brave the weather
and do so covered in so
many layers that they are barely recognizable
under pounds offleece and Spandex.
That leaves it to the everyday athletes yes I
mean you and me
to go outside and create a
winter sports season. One activity simply continues from the fall season straight into winter:
snow football. Now, some may think football is
too violent and, without padding, is a definite
way to injure oneself. I can happily proclaim
these doubters incorrect. In those first few days
of snowfall, when the scene looks magical from
your window, the weather gods are giving us

nature's padding
the soft, fresh feeling of new
snow provides the perfect landing material.
You may tackle without fear, for both you and
the poor opponent you drive to the ground will
land in a fluff of white powder! Friends have
informed me that it is not rare for random people
to throw down their books and join in snow football just to unleash their inner tackle monster.
The soft snow also allows for your inner NFL star
to come out as you can feel free to attempt a
"Terrell Owens" diving catch or try to leap over
a pile of blockers like your favorite running
back.
Of course, for the less contact-oriented, there
are the classic snowball fights. Now, you may
avoid slamming someone else's body, but keeping
the snow off you will require skill. Be on the
lookout for huge forts to spring up on Parrish
Beach and watch your back, for the unsuspecting student hoping to hurry to class is the perfect
target for a beautifully crafted snowball. Fellow
students' reactions after getting beaned in the
head are worth the cold time spent hiding in your
fort.
"Snowball fights, how juvenile!" you might
exclaim, but remember that we have a limited
time as college students to enjoy these winter
activities before we have to go to work in suits
which are decidedly not snowball attire. So I suggest you put aside your "grown-up" attitudes and
relish in this easy entertainment.
Enjoy these chances while they last, take the
time to release your hidden artist, and try
building a new type of snowman. Be spontaneous and start an impromptu wrestling match
with your friends in a snow pile. Heck, I'll even
advocate joining some young Swarthmoreans
in sledding down the Clothier Tower hill. No
matter what, go outside and give snow a
chance. Otherwise, the cold weather will wear
and no one wants to be the Scrooge
on you
among their friends.
So take it from a full-blood Californian: I'll be
cursing this winter and frowning as the temperature drops just like the rest of you, but I will
also take the time to at least attempt most of
these activities. Who knows, I may enjoy the
powder enough to become one of those maniacs
who thinks snow is "cool."

When a team breaks its
own record twice within
three weeks, it's a good sign
that things are going in the
right direction. The Garnet
women's track team, under
the guidance of coach Pete
Carroll, can now boast the
two fastest female mile runners in college history; and
the good news is, they're not
done setting records.

later, when the team traveled
to the NYU invitational at
the New York Armory on
January 14, Sarah Hobbs 'O6
took the record back, and
defeated many Division I athletes in the process with her
second place finish in 5:16.73.
Earlier
this
season,
Hobbs, who made headlines
throughout the fall with her

remarkable success as a
first-time cross country runner, set the school record in

the 3000 meters at the
Villanova
Pyrah
Jack
Invitational,
hosted by
Haverford. Her time of 10:17
crushed the previous record
of 10:39.39 held by Joko
Agunloye 'Ol, and Ritter
barely missed matching the
record herself with a time of
10:39.7.

Swarthmore had numerous other notable performances in New York, includ-

Vernon Chaplin 'O7, Tyler
Lyson 'O6, Eric Sweigard 'OB
and Ross Weller 'OB. The
young team finished in a
time of 10:52.79, with two
other Garnet relay teams
right behind in seventh

Lyson also led a crew of
Swarthmore sprinters to finish 43rd in the 200 in 24.03
seconds. Mike Siciliano 'OB
and Jon Shoop 'OB participated in the mile, coming in
38th and 46th respectively,
with times of 4:48.81 and
4:54.64. Jones Nauseef 'O6

Garnet readies for playoff run
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

Win or go home.
Although the playoffs have not quite arrived, the
women's basketball team has already embraced this
postseason attitude. With ten of the team's twelve
games against conference opponents remaining, the
next month will determine whetherthe Garnet is one of
five teams that make the conference tournament, or
whether it will suffer a fate similar to last season's and
fall just short of that goal.
Over break, Swarthmore faced conference opponents in all five of its games and emerged 3-2, coming
up with big wins and enduring tough losses over the
ten-day stretch. The Garnet opened the month of
January with a 74-51 victory over perennial Centennial
Conference cellar-dweller Washington. Radiance
Walters 'O6 led the Garnet against the Shorewomen in
points (14) and rebounds (13), adding to her team-high
totals in both categories. Laura Popovics 'OB came off
the bench to contribute 12 points and a team-high 4
steals. Despite leading only 32-29 at the half,
Swarthmore turned it up in the second half and used

"Over our break we played our
best and our worst."
Laura Popovics 'OB
consistent shooting (42.9 percent from the field) to hand
Washington yet another home beating.

"I think it was one of our best halves of basketball
all season," Debra Parrelly 'O6 said of the Tide's secondhalf explosion. "We came back from break really
strong. We were really excited to be back."
The Garnet dropped two important games early in
the break that threatened the momentum the team had
built going into its post-vacation schedule.
Swarthmore nearly pulled off an upset of 7-1
Dickinson, owners of third place spot in the conference. The Garnet came back from a 30-25 deficit midway through to fall just two points short of the Red
Devils in a 54-52 loss. Allison Wolff 'O5 led the team
with 13 points, but the squad struggled and shot just
33.3 percent from the floor.
The Garnet also fell in a disappointing contest at
Franklin and Marshall 57-45, despite strong contributions from Jessica Fuhr 'O7 (10 points) and Karen Berk
'OB (9 rebounds).

"That was a game that was definitely a big test for
us," Farrelly said. "We faltered against them."
Swarthmore bounced back for two wins in a row, the
first a dominating 64-32 win against Bryn Mawr. At
home against the Owls, Berk stepped up for the Garnet
with 14 points, and Cara Tigue 'O6 led the team with 9
rebounds, career highs for both women. Farrelly led
the squad with 5 assists in the game.
The squad closed out its vacation play with a win
against a tough Gettysburg team that will be a factor in
determining the Garnet's playoff hopes. Leading by
two points at halftime, the Garnet extended its lead in
the second half to defeat the Bullets 63-5 L Kristen Lee
'O5 (13 points), Wolff (11), Berk (11) and Walters (10) all
finished in double figures, and Walters led the squad
with 15 rebounds.
"It was a huge game for us," Farrelly said. "It was a
chance for us to prove ourselves on top of the two losses we'd had in the previous week." She was especially
excited about the team's ability to adjust to
Gettysburg's physical play and praised the work of
Walters and Berk. "We were very composed throughout the game," Farrelly said.
Wolff was recognized as a member of the Centennial
Conference Honor Roll for the weeks of January 4 and
11, and Garnet players are getting their names among
the conference leaders with their impressive numbers.
Walters is second in the conference with 110 rebounds
per game, and Wolff is tops in the conference with a free
throw average of 80.0%. As a team, Swarthmore is leading the conference in total defense, allowing only 49.2
points per game, and is second in opponent's field goal
percentage with 33.0%.
Garnet players acknowledge that while the team
has been excelling defensively, much work remains to
be done on the offensive side of the court. As a team,
Swarthmore is seventh in the conference in field goal
percentage (35.9%) and eighth in total offense, averaging 58.0 points per game.
With an even 4-4 record in Centennial Conference
play, Swarthmore is tied for sixth place out of eleven
teams. Down the stretch, competition for the last playoff spots will come from Franklin and Marshall (4-4),
Muhlenberg (4-3), and Gettysburg (5-3). A stretch of
games played between February 8-19 will be crucial to
the Garnet's playoff aspirations, as the team will play
three out of its five games against these opponents.
"Over our break we played our best and our worst,"
Popovics said, "But hopefully we'll take what we
learned from our disappointments and continue to
improve our record in the conference and make our
second half of the season more successful than the

first."

Most people think that ice hockey is a gruesome, violent sport that results in bloody noses and riots. With a
name like Motherpuckers, Swarthmore's ice hockey team
presents an imposing image, but this hockey organization
is different. Their mission: Have fun.
Motherpuckers is a well-established intramural club.
Rather than a team, "[Motherpuckers is] more like an
organization," Stephen St. Vincent 'O7 said. "We are a pretty friendly organization. Our goal is to have fun."
Coordinators St. Vincent, John Boonstra 'O7 and
Jonathan Ference 'O7 all share an addictive passion for
hockey though Ference and St. Vincent did initially join
Motherpuckers at Boonstra's behest. Currently, their
Sunday and Thursday routines now center on this celebrated activity. Little more than a year ago, however,
Ference and St. Vincent were completely lacking in hockey and skating experience. "At first we were skeptical, but
it turned out to be fun," St. Vincent said. "We thought it
was going to be horrible, [but afterwards] we both got
skates." They were hooked.
From October through March, about 20 to 40 would-be
skaters meet twice a week at the Rose Garden; from there,
the hockey lovers make their way to Springfield Ice Rink
via van. Once there, they divide into teams of four or five

THE PHOENIX

It happens every year. We Swatties furiously scribble
and scratch through our finals, miraculously pulling off
grades we never thought we could have gotten and then
bolt, running home as soon as possible to lick our wounds
and remember what sanity
feels like. Then, after nursing ourselves back to
health, we find ourselves
secretly longing for the torture to come back, so that
we can fill these days that

now feel so empty with
more self-imposed torment.
And so we come crawling
back from our respective
winter hideouts, finding
the city and the campus

frozen solid and the winter
sports teams carrying middling or bad results, as we
MATTHEW DRAPER
assume all of our sports
teams do. On this midJanuary day, we find the
campus much as we left it
and we assume that what is
happening when we return has been happening all winter.
What is odd, though, is that it never happens that way.
Unbeknownst to any of us, the Swarthmore campus undergoes an amazing transformation in the winter. When we
leave, the sun comes out almost daily, birds that we didn't
even know existed begin to sing and the few who remain
walk around upright with smiles on their faces. Just after
New Year's Day, the winter sports teams return, still nursing their finals wounds and suddenly finding themselves
immersed in a paradise. The weather, while occasionally
rainy, never drops below 50 degrees and wherever anyone
steps, flowers grow up out of the ground.
The results for the sports teams are even more amazing.
Unburdened by expectations of failure, they play their
sports as they never have before, running, swimming,
shooting and defending as though they had been born to do
such things. While they end up voluntarily losing most of
their games because they realize that winning and losing
is not important, life has never seemed so grand as when
the campus is only occupied by sports teams. Take this
winter, for instance. Instead of the biting cold, the freezing
wind, and the snow fall, the basketball and track teams
returned to a lovely campus and won or voluntarily lost all
of their games. For the mens' basketball team, Matt
Gustafson averaged about 70 points a game, but they still
voluntarily lost most games 78-76, except for those where
they let someone come off the bench to hit a heroic game
winning three-pointer. In track, Sarah Hobbs shattered the
"world record while wearing a Swarthmore uniform" for
the indoor 3,000 and Swarthmore won many of its races
because their opponents couldn't help but stop and smell
the roses that grew up in the tracks of our racers.
And then we came back. Once the first serious academic
student set foot on campus, all the flowers died, the birds disappeared and the temperature dropped 30 degrees. Sadly, the
winter sports teams began hanging their heads, trudging
around campus and going about the grueling task of playing
with heavy expectations to lose. And now it's snowing and
will probably not stop until the whole campus is swallowed
in white. You can check the facts, they're all there...
Or maybe not. Maybe I just made it up, but I guess that
was the point of this whole exercise. Yes, that's right, the
point is that you (and I) don'tknow what happens on this
campus over winter break, particularly regarding sports.
I'll wager that not one of you could prove, withoutfirst talking to a winter sport person, that I am wrong.
After all, how would we know? How do we even get to
know these teams that play so many of their games when
we aren't even on campus? In terms of trying to create a
school spirit or a fan base it seems a little odd. I know there
are complicated cultural reasons for the scheduling, but in
harkening back to those great days when we were all
cheering for the soccer team, I wonder how we can ever get
into our basketball teams or track teams in the same way
if we can't even follow their season. These teams, for the
most part, play in a world that we are not familiar with,
even after January 17. Maybe it would be worth it for a few
of us (myself included) to put down our books and get out
and support our friends and peers. After all, flowers
sprang from the ground where they once walked.

Motherpuckers: no gore, but fun in store

for a few friendly games. "We are not competitive at all,"
St. Vincent said. "Only the A-line gets competitive." The
majority of participants enjoy the non-competitive
atmosphere. The teams are divided into lines. The A-line
has advanced players, although St. Vincent and Ference
managed to make A-line after only a year of playing. Bline is for beginners, C-line provides comedic entertainment, and D-line is made up of semi-mobile hockey disasters.
As a result of its relaxed attitude, Motherpuckers does
not regularly play other leagues or college organizations,
although the prohibitively expensive price of full equipment is also a factor. SBC funding keeps the fun alive,
though the high cost of ice time continually stretches the
budget. Financial constraints limit full equipment to
goalies, although all players get helmets, skates, pucks and
sticks.
Ference and St. Vincent share a strong passion for
Motherpuckers. St. Vincent, recognizing his unusually
strong commitment, simply said, "It has to be experienced
it's just fun." The

It's all about the Benjamins, baby. With that in mind, I'm hereby proclaiming the Utah Utes my 2004 NCAA Football National

paying their teachers a
respectable salary and a couple fewer Gaylord Hotels
Music City Bowls? But I
don't want to get caught up
in the same old argument

about NCAA's value system,
or how we should have a
playoff like every pro and
college sport does.
Let's stick to the facts. It's
not like I can't make a case for Utah. Sure, they're not the only
viable number one candidate with a strong Auburn team also finishing 13-0, but Utah did the best they could playing in the
Mountain West Conference. Yeah, New Mexico was the only conference rival who actually received a bowl invite, but the Utes leveled theLobos 28-7. One week later, they destroyed North Carolina
by 30, again sealing the game by halftime. They also dominated a
strong Texas A&M team 41-21 in their season opener, the very
same team that Texas and Oklahoma had significantly more trouble dispatching in later weeks. Don't forget the slaughter that was
the Fiesta Bowl (they sacked the Pittsburgh quarterback something like 48 times in the first quarter alone). In fact, no team
came within 13 points of Urban Meyer's Utes all season.

More Cowbell

I'm hereby proclaiming the Utah Utes
my 2004 NCAA Football National
Champions!
If the on-field performance argument doesn't work, how about
the team colors? The crimson and white looked great on my dad's

new HDTV. They also boast a catchy nickname and some fancy
red jerseys. No sale? Well, I'll have you know that the University
of Utah is one of the finest research institutions in the region,
with professors who are among the best in the nation at not making time for their students. They even claimed to have discovered
cold fusion there. Aren't great academics and high athletic fashion budgets some of the qualities that the NCAA does its best to
promote? Either way, these qualifications are no more arbitrary
than what we currently use to determine the national champion.
There's no point in all those guys putting their time and effort
into training year round if the champion isn't even decided on the
field. I love March Madness so much because any decent team has
a chance to come together and go on a Cinderella run.
At the start of the playoffs, college hoops has 65 teams with one
common dream. College football has two teams with something to
play for and 52 more who would rather spend their holidays with
their friends and families than whore themselves for their respective schools in an otherwise meaningless game.
I'm not saying that USC and Auburn aren't as deserving, but
to say the Trojans are unanimous national champions is absurd.
They didn't beat the two other best teams in the country. They
never even got to play them.
