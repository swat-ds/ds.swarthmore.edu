THE
Hepatitis-A
Appears
on Campus

Volume 118, Number 24

SC Balloting Process
Raises Questions
By

Jessica Harbour

Linda Echols, Director of Worth Health
Center, says students should not be overly
concernedabout recent cases of the hepatitis-

A virus appearing on campus. Though she
acknowledged that a few students have come
down with the virus, she disagreed with a
characterization ofthe cases as an "outbreak":
"Outbreak implies a lotof students are having
it, and we don't have that."
Hepatitis A is a viral disease that causes
inflammation of the liver. Of the five hepatitis viruses, hepatitis A is considered the least
serious. The virus can survive on a surface for
up to four hours at normal temperatures, and
can also be found in saliva. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, people most
frequently contract hepatitis A through household contact, sexual contact, attendance or
employment at day care centers, and overseas
travel. "You can get it from a variety of
ways," said Echols.
It has not yet been determined how the
affected students contracted the virus. "We
haven't pinpointed the source," Echols admitted, but added that.the source could not
have been Dining Services "or else a lot of
people would've been sick." She emphasized
that students should be especially careful to
wash their hands frequently, especially when
eating: "That's one way oftransmitting—poor
sanitary habits." She said there was no connection to recent concerns of hepatitis A being
transmitted through contaminatedstrawberries
in public schools across the country.
Symptoms for hepatitis A most closely
resemble the flu. Those infected usually suffer from fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever,
pain in the liver area, dark urine or lightcolored stools, and, on occasion, jaundice.
Symptoms usually appear within the first
month of infection; the patient is usually told
to rest and consume foods high in protein.
Echols encourages anyone who suspects he
or she has contracted hepatitis A to come to
Worth for an evaluation.

Athletic Funding: Gender Equality?
By

Nick Attanasio

The recent controversy surrounding Brown University, which dropped two men's and women's
programs and was taken to court by female athletes for violating Title IX, raises questions ofhow
Swarthmore measures up in equality between
men's and women's athletics. At Brown, the team
members felt that the school allowed a disparity
between male and female representation of the
student body on ajl athletic teams, regardless of
the actual numbers of sports per gender. According to The Brown Daily Herald of April 4,1995
"Brown has one of the most gender-equal programs in the nation, so if Brown's athletic program violates Title IX, most intercollegiate programs are also in violation-and to a much greater
extent."
According to Bob Williams, head of athletics at
Swarthmore, the College "provides men and
women with equal opportunities" to participate in
,

all levels ofathletics. As a Division 111 memberof
the NCAA, Swarthmore must comply with Title
IX of Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states that
"No person in the United States shall, on the basis
of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity
receiving Federal financial assistance."
Because of Swarthmore's Division 111 status,
Title IX's stipulations regarding athletic scholarships do not apply. Yet the College still must
ensure "equal opportunity" to both genders,though
what exactly constitutes "equal opportunity" is
suspect. The law does not specifically address
money. Various methods of compliance are available for schools, but all approaches have been
contested in court.
Williams says Swarthmore athletics demonstrates equality between genders in all aspects of

When students return for classes in the fall of
this year, the east side of campus will have an
entirely new look, complete with an artificial
river. In addition to a new garden in the upper
quad (to be planted behind Trotter) and the
relocation of the Slide Rock sculpture (to the
base of Mertz Lawn), the Facilities Office and
the Scott Arboretum plan to install a storm
drainage system which features a "bio-streambed," a 150-yard aboveground creekbed
which will run between McCabe and Willets.
The streambed represents an innovative but

risky attempt to alleviate storm flooding of the
upper campus, particularly the Rose Garden and
the roofs ofPearson and Trotter. Traditional drainage storm water drainage systems at the College
areconstructed ofimpermeable undergroundpipes,
which drain rainwater directly from roof and road
gutters, finally emptying into Crum Creek. During
major storms, the volume and velocity of the water
passing through such a system can be extremely
high, and the resulting overflow can cause harmful
erosion. Also, pollutants such as roofing chemicals and road oil can pass through the pipes and
into the Crum, threatening the local ecosystem.
In the proposed alternative system, the large-

diameter underground pipe with storm water collected from the area would surface just east of
McCabe, where it would pour water from a stone
headwall into an artificial creekbed constructed
of smooth river rocks. The creekbed would be
lined with marshland vegetation well-adapted to
occasional submersion in water. It will end just
northeast of Ben West House, where the water
will be gathered in another underground pipe,
whichflows into the larger drainpipe along Chester
Road, eventually depositing the water in theCrum.
According to Larry Schall, Associate ViceSee Creekbed, page 2

Chris DiLeo '99, one of the voters
whose name had been found crossed
off by mistake, received an official
apology from Seaman. Seaman explained that the mistake was probably due to the fact that "Voting in
Sharpies gets kind of crazy
sometimes...and it's very easy to confuse last names." In the end, DiLeo's
vote was taken into consideration.
Seaman claims that the two other
incidents were similar in nature.
Regarding the claim that students
had been given permission to take
away ballots, Seamanadmits thatsuch
a practice had in fact occurred, but

had not been encouraged. According
to Seaman, approximately twenty students had made such a request while
he was on duty over the three-day
period, but that it was made clear to
them that lost ballots would not be
replaced, and that their names had to
be takendown. In the end, most of the
students decided to fill the ballot on
the spot, whereas in around two or
threecases they were allowed to leave
with the ballots. Seaman, however,
does not see a potential for fraud in
giving away ballots. The concern over
the possibility of photocopying ballots was not legitimate, Seaman
claims, since voters' names were
checked off after their ballots were
cast. Seaman also cites a case in which
he had caught a student who tried to
vote twice.

Several incidents occurring during
the Student Council elections this
week elicited concerns over the potential flaws of the existing paper
balloting system.
On three separate occasions, students who had not voted were told
that their names had been crossed off
from the master list. In another case,
a student who had voted found that
his name had not been crossed off. It
was also reported that students were
allowed to take ballots from the polling stations and return them at a later
time. On another occasion, the official ballot box was leftunmanned for
a short interval.
Under the current system, according to Chris Seaman '99, SC Secretary and Chairman of the SC Elections Committee, at each voting station, students have their names
crossed off from the directory after
they have filled out and cast their

Greylock, Swat Apts. Lock out Students
By Tony

Sturm

Greylock and Swarthmore Apartments have stopped renting rooms to

students, causing concern about discrimination and leaving several
students looking elsewhere for housing for next year.
The apartments, located across
Chester Roa"d from PPR, currently
house ten Swarthmore students, a

number which has remained generally constant over the years.
But a few months ago, Media Real
Estate, the company that operates but
does not own the two buildings, implemented a policy in which the rooms
would no longer be rented to students.
Jaclyn Coutts '99 is a current resident of Greylock. "When I got my
lease they said I had the option to

renew it," she said. But when she
went to change it, the company said
that they were no longer allowing
students to rent. "They said it was a
corporate decision and they aren't
renting to students anymore. They
said they would give us a lease if our
parents signed for it."
There have been problems among
the non-student residents of the two
buildings, as students generally do
not live the same sort of lifestyle as
most other residents. A few weekends ago, someone threw up in the
elevator, and allegedly a student was
to blame. There have also been complaints about the noise level. "They
have legitimate and strong concerns
about the behavior of some students,"
said Larry Schall, Associate Vice
President of Facilities and Management. "So far, they have been pretty

accommodating."
Underpressure, MediaReal Estate
has stated that they will continue to
rent to students who currently rent,
but still will not allow any new studentleases. Aubrie Dirks-Moyer' 00,

Ville Apts.: No

Passover Celebrated
By

Dave Mimno

Although many students do not eat
choice, there are
times when the meals provided by
Dining Services are simply not even
an option. One group which faces
such a problem is Jewish students
who wish to keep kosher for Passover. As a result, nearly 40 students
recently spent a week off the meal
plan.
ThePassover co-op has offered an
alternative to Sharpies to students
during the Jewish holidays for several years. "Lisa Ginsberg, with the
help of others, has been in charge for
the past three years," commented
Laura Pomerance 'OO, "but because
she is now a senior and has a thesis to
write, this year she passed on the
responsibility to Shana Stein, Lyndy
Yankaskas and myself. We are members of the Ruach board and are,
respectively, the holidays coordinator, administrative coordinator, and
kosher kitchen coordinatorof Ruach,
so we were the logical people to run
the co-op."
at Sharpies out of

The co-op began its work by cleaning the kitchen under Bond. All foods
that were not kosher had to be cleaned
out or locked up. Then all of the pots,
dishes, and utensils which were to be
used in food preparation were ritually
cleaned. The students used paper
plates and plastic utensils in order to
keep the amount of dishes that had to
be cleaned to a minimum.
The students then went to the supermarket to buy food for the coop. The funding for the co-op, which
came from Dining Services, was
enough to keep the shelves stocked
for the entire week. They made four
large food runs, but, as several students commented, they had to make
numerous smaller trips to buy items.
The meals themselves were prepared by student volunteers. Dishes
included gazpacho, farfel kugel, spinach souffle, and curry. Dinners were
held in Bond, a much more comfortable location than Lodge 5, where
they have been held previously. According to Pomerance, "Everyone

be an issue, a person must be under 18

The reasons that the apartments are
no longer being offered to students are
fairly clear. "We are high risk tenants," said Dirks-Moyer.

Balloting Procedure Provokes Criticism
From Student Council, page 1

Tuesday evening, the official ballot
box was left unattended for a short
period of time. Josh Kramer 'OO, SC
Charter Chair, reports that when he
arrived at the voting station at around
5 p.m., the ballot box was unguarded
on the tables next to the entrance.
Kramer claims that he proceeded to
sit at the tables by himself for approximately forty-five minutes,
whereupon he asked Frank Mote 'OO,
former SC Treasurer, to take over for
him.
Kramer also informed Naomi
Michlin '9B, SC Co-chair, of the
situation at that time, who in turn,
called Seaman. Seaman left for
Sharpies soon after receiving
Michlin's call. According to
Kramer, Mote did not end up staying at the station until Seaman's
arrival at 6 p.m.. Seaman, on the
other hand, claims that Michlin
called him at around 5:30, and that
he arrived at the station between
5:40 and 5:45. Seaman reports that

the ballotbox had appeared untouched
upon his arrival at Sharpies, with the
phone directory on top. "I can't say
for sure that nothing happened, but I
can't imagine that anything would
have happened, Seaman remarked.
The recent string of events also
brings to light the debate over what is
the best voting procedure. SC had
experimented with computer balloting in the past, but abandoned the
method due to low turnout rates.
Kramer hopes to bring the issue to the
attention of SC at this Sunday's meeting. Kramer himself is a firm advocate of computer balloting,"lt makes
people thinkabout their vote.. .it means
that those who are voting are those
that care about SC." He also points
out the fact that computer balloting
makes elections administered by a
third party —namely the computing
center—which ensures the fairness
of the process.
Seaman, on the other hand, prefers
the paper balloting process because it

Lang's money must be spent appropriately
Eugene Lang is undoubtedly one of the greatest graduates of Swarthmore.
His "I Have a Dream Foundation" is an example of the kind of involvement
most of us expect Swatties to strive to accomplish in their own lives.
In light of Lang's recent gift of $3O million to the College, we feel it is
essential to recognize the spirit with which the money was given. $3O million
could build three more buildings like Kohlberg. And we realize that many
faculty and administration members would like to see this happen. But we
don't see the need simply to improve the way Swarthmore looks—our image
is not nearly as essential as the true substance of this College. Thus, Lang's
money should not merely become a chunk of the College's already enormous
endowment; instead, we feel this money must be used to enact the same kind
of social change as Lang does himself.
One of the areas that is most deserving of funding is financial aid. The
current system can put a lot of burden on students and parents to contribute
a large amount towards the expense of a Swarthmore education. It is also
becoming increasingly more difficult for students to attend private colleges
and this means that there is the potential for institutions like ours to become
all the more elitist. Making it possible for any students to come here is an
essential part of allowing people to give back to their communities.
Swarthmore's increasing diversity demands a commitment to increased
financial aid; it is only by bringing more disparate voices to campus that we
can improve the kind of dialogue and action that takes place here.
Moreover, we feel that the College needs to develop more ways to
encourage this sort of action and dialogue. Swarthmore Foundation grants
and the Lang Scholars program are both amazing opportunities. However,
theirreach is limited. There needs to be more money available for students and
student groups both throughout the year and during the summer who want to
do community service projects so that it is possible for anyone to carry out a
project without having to consider financial constraints.
We realize that the process of determining where the money will go will
take enormous deliberation on the part of students, faculty and staff. We
simply hope that the decision follows in the footsteps of Lang himself.

Letters to the Editor
Visiting Instructor of French Experienced a Surprisingly Uninviting Side
To the Editor:
I am currently a visiting instructor
of French here at Swarthmore College. I came here on the GrenobleSwarthmore exchange program,
promised that America was a haven
for freedom and good will, and that
no place exudes that more than
Swarthmore. However, I am leaving
this college with disappointment;
despite the fact that there were aspects of Swarthmore that I truly enjoyed (the friendliness of the people
in the Bookstore and the Scott Arboretum, and the beauty of the campus,
for example), I am worried that all is
not quite right here on the hill. This is
not my first experience at an American university; I have, in previous
years, visited the United States to
teach at other colleges. I came believing Swarthmore to be a Utopia ofthe
American university experience; I
found that it was not quite right, at
least for me. This is not meant to be a
harsh criticism of Swarthmore; I do
not see myself as a martyr, or as the
only voice of common sense in a sea
of evil. But in France, we tend to be

O'Connell andAmar Treat Jones Unfairly

To the Editors:
This is just a few thoughts on the
letter to the editor written by Ford
O'Connell and Frank Amar in last
week's issue. Unlike their article, this
letter is not some malicious, poorly
written character assassination. It is
not even a revenge killing for a misdirected attempt on the character of
Vincent Jones for three reasons.

after the first two paragraphs I decided I could get more truth and validity by reading a piece in Sun
magazine entitled "Woman Gives
Birth to Richard Simmons'
Lovechild." In fact, I wondered how
the editors ofThe Phoenix could sleep
well at night given the stark and ironic
similarities between the Amar and
O'Connell article and the e-mail the
editors published written by John

What will I miss about Swarthmore? Truly? The people, the meals shared, will anyone run the Vincent Jones'

This semester, we have seen The Phoenix grow and change, both in its look
and content. People are reading the paper
We have also grown as a
forum for discussion. We are pleased that we have helped make student
opinions more of a vehicle for beginning to change administrative policies
and campus attitudes.
No matter how open-minded we think we are, there are still new perspectives to become aware of to improve the paper's representation. Someone is
always going to be unhappy with what The Phoenix does, and the best we can
do is be responsive and treat all opinions equally.
What have we learned? Alarms must be turned off; one must never hang up
on Public Safety; it's unbelievable how quickly the night goes by; and it's not
always a good feeling to go to bed as the sun rises.
We would like to take a moment to appreciate the associate editors, section
editors, section assistants, writers and photographers who put up with our
idiosyncracies and visions, as convoluted as they may have seemed sometimes.
A special thanks to all of those who watched over us during our nervous
breakdowns. We know that these stressful times come with the position, but,
we can honestly say that if it weren't for each other, we would have burned
down Parrish a long timeago.

more.

We love you, Spike!
We are not mad. You are very funny. Next time, though, please don't steal
our templates.

very outspoken, and when a problem
arises we try to work it out together,
and certainly don'tleave it unsolved.
My major concern is how I was
treated here as a visiting instructor. I
found that my presence here made
some faculty members uncomfortable in some way. Why was that?
Was it because of my professional
profile? (This is the first time a more
"mature/experienced" instructor has
been sent from Grenoble.) I certainly
hope not; not in a place like Swarthmore! I think it is mainly because,
and I could be wrong about this, I saw
myself being forced into the position
of a "little assistant." I felt that some
faculty expected, out of habit, that I
would be a little bit obsequious to
them simply because they have been
here longer, or because they come
from a prestigious American university, that I would conform to the hierarchy that has been so carefully set
up; I have had to change offices three
times this year, and I'm sure that this
is not a common practice! I was not
expecting these kind of situations, to
tell the truth. I have taught in other

people to write them; you do the
math) that they do not even warrant
attending to specifically. The one
thing I have learned in my four years
here is that, surprisingly enough, there
will always be a constant level of
idiocracy in the world which most
certainly includes Swarthmore. It's
like background noise; one learns to
get over it.
So why, then, you may ask did I
write this letter? Simply, because I
can as the parting words of a senior.
And ifthat answer isn't good enough,
I can tell you why I didn't write it. I
didn't write this article because I am
necessarily defending everything that
Vincent Jones writes. Contrary to
popular belief, Black people are not
monolithic in their thinking. We have
as many different opinions as there
are shades of Black. Vincent Jones,
like Louis Farrakhan, is just one voice
among many, not our "self-appointed" leader. Even more, I didn't
write this article to defend Vincent
either. Believe me, if Vincenthad put
any stock in what O'Connell or Amar
wrote, he is more than capable and
articulate enough to defend himself
on this matter. Rather, I wrote in a
rare gesture of pity and concern for
O'Connell and Amar, the former so
narrow-minded he can't see straight
and the latter so unconscious he's
comatose. To them I offer my knowledge and issue a challenged you are
really concerned about the issues in
your article, I offer to discuss them
with you. I'm in the directory. You
can look me up.

Chalking Perpetuates Negative Stereotypes
To the Editor:
On April 25,1997, a chalk writing
appeared in big print in front ofParrish
by the Rose Garden so that almostall
the campus and prospective students
could see it during the whole weekend.The writing said: "On October 9,
1916,2000 children were burnt alive
by the Turkish Army. This was only
0.25% of theArmenians slaughtered."
Imagine you were a person who
read it, and thought that the given
information was completely true.
What would be your reaction?
Wouldn't you justblame the Turks as
murderers?
We, as the Turkish Cultural Society of Swarthmore College, were
deeply hurtand offended by that chalk
writing. We did not know whose idea
was to put down that writing. Amnesty International? or some Armenian friends?
Oh come on, it couldn't be Amnesty International... After all, Amnesty International is an organization
responsible for acknowledging any
kind ofinternational mass massacre.
If they put such a writing, they would
feel responsible to also put a chalk
writing about the 600,000-1.5 million Turkish Muslims who, according to some sources, were slaughtered by the Armenian gangs during
the First World War. Amnesty International could not take the responsibility of blaming a wholenation without 100% evidence.
We concluded that Amnesty International could not be that one-sided
and inconsiderate. At least not at
Swarthmore? Then, we thought that
maybe, it is some Armenian friends
who put down the chalk writing. But
what were they trying to do? Write
down a fact? or commemorate the

pains of the past?
If they thought they were writing a
fact, they were badly mistaken. The
first point to make is the fact that
there was not a Turkish army in 1916.
1916 corresponds to the First World
War years, and there was not even an
organized Ottoman army. Back then,
theOttoman Empire was almost dead,
and the Turkish Republic was not
established until 1923.
In any case, whoever wrote the
chalk writing has no justification in
writing such a one-sided notice for
the whole campus to see. Their attempt does nothing but to initiate
hate speech against the Turks. If we
are allowed to write any non-proven
one-sided facts all around campus,
then the Turks could also start listing
the Armenian massacres against the
Turks based on the Turkish and other
sources.
Furthermore, we could also write
down all the falsifications that we
have about the suggested massacres
against Armenians by the Turks.
We are at Swarthmore. We should
speak about facts, not about some
mere numbers that nobody knows by
fact. Itis a pain for both the Armenian
and the Turkish Cultures what happened in the past. We lived for 600
years as friends and neighbors, and
everything broke down in 50 years.
Both sides lost hundreds of thousands of people. Who is responsible
for it? Those who wanted to end this
friendship for the sake of their political aims. Everybody knows who that
is.We should commemorate together,
with our Armenian friends, instead
of trying to flood each other with
blame that relies on biased sources.
Pinar Karaca '9B and Onat Negiz
'97, Turkish Cultural Society

US universities and overseas and
there, people are appreciated not for
their titles or seniority, but for what
they really are as human beings.
There must be a certain way to
treat people here, and obviously I
did not act accordingly. Was it a
cultural shock? Most probably! I
may soundrather cynical when I say
this, but there seems to be a certain
attitude among some people here
that makes themask: "What can that
person bring me? Is it worth investing the effort in this person?" The
people here live in a very competitive environment and do not seem to
have the timeavailablefor the "little
people," of which I was one. At
least, I encountered here a couple of
people who eventually became real
friends, and I am grateful to them for
the support they have given me.
When one feels excluded like this,
one cannot help but wonder why.
Why, at a place that parades its freedom and philosophies of equal opportunity and fairness, is there another level, one that I find myself on
every day? I really have no answer
to that. When I brought my concerns
to thepersons directly involved, they
were very nice and polite, but nevertheless the problems were left unsolved. My salary was raised a little,
but, given to what it was originally,
I still felt a little bit like "cheap
labor" in that respect. Of course,
here again it depends on which way
you look at it and on the profile of
the person coming from Grenoble.
Unfortunately, in today' s world, and

Awareness

of Swarthmore
particularly in business, you don'talways get what you deserve. It just
seems to me that an institution such as
Swarthmore could and should apply
fairness. In my case, I'm not sure that
fairness was applied. I believe the person from Grenoble has always played
a very important part in the French
program here but has he/she been
treated accordingly?
This is not what Swarthmore is all
about. We know that. This is another
side of this college and however small
it may be, and I hope it is, this kind of
problems have to be faced, especially
this year when we are celebrating the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the
Grenoble Program. If we want this
program to continue being "exceptionally successful," we should exercise more solidarity and fairness and
include everybody.
I will conclude by saying that there
is a book that I taught in my French 2B
class called "Le Petit Prince," or "The
Little Prince." I just wish that we would
all read this book, in whatever language. In a world of complexities, this
book teaches simplicity and the value
of simple friendships and responsibilities. In the simple moral of "the
most important things are the things
you can't see with your eyes," St.
Exupery is expressing the most basic
and important values of life. He has
written life itself, I think, in just that
one sentence, and it is so very important for all of us to remember. Thank
you all for letting me teach here. It was
an experience, to say the least.

of Safety Issues Is Only the First Step

To the Editor:
In response to the Phoenix editorial "Assaults Indicate Need For
Safety Awareness," I would like to
commend the Phoenix for pointing
out a simple fact that a few of us
have known for a long time. Our
campus and its residents are not protected by a magic bubble, nor do we
live in a special "crime-free" zone.
The grounds of the college, by their
very nature, are a perfect environment for a predatory criminal such
as the person(s) who committed the
recent assaults near Wharton.
The suggestion of hiring more security officers is typical of liberal
thinkers (and spenders) and is foolish. Thepresence of unarmed public
safety officers and (occasionally)
armed borough police does not and
never will absolve the students on
this campus, or anyone else, of the
responsibility and fundamental right
of self-protection through any and
all means necessary. Public safety
and the Swarthmore police are not
your personal bodyguards, and hiring more of them is not a cost-effective solution.These officers are paid
and trained to act as a general deterrent to crime, to investigate criminal
activity after the fact, and to apprehend suspects; they do these things
very well. But criminals go to great
lengths to commit their acts when
these officers are not around, and it
is ultimately up to the potential targets of these crimes to deter the
attacker. The police have never been
and are not liable, morally or legally, for any harm that may befall
you due to criminal attack. They are
not legally required to and should
not be expected to protect our lives
with their own. If you think thatyour
immediate safety is their problem,
or the College's, then you do so at

your own risk
The Phoenix is right on the money
with the points that they did include in
this piece—more lights make a difficult environment for criminals who
rely on stealth, and hiring lone students to do the job of trained police or
to protect someone else is foolish at
best, dangerous at worst, especially
when all they could do if they were
attacked while patrolling is call for
public safety on their radio, an action
that is unlikely to deter an assault
already in progress. But the editorial
fails to point out the most important
issue raised by the recent assaults on
campus. "Awareness" of safety precautions is great, but practicing and
using strategies to defend against such
possibilities, however remote, is far
more important.
Some time, everyone will have to
walk alone at night through an unlit
area, and obviously be alert to their
surroundings while doing so. Carrying a radio, personal alarm, or
cellphone seems like a great idea in
theory, but do you really think thatyou
will be able to dial or talk while someone is beating the snot out of you? All
these passive devices do is (maybe)
allow the police to find you (or what's
left of you) after the attacker has had
his way. We would all like to live in an
environment free of such acts, but the
reality is that there will always be few
people out there like the "Wharton
Assaulter" (and worse), and despite
what many people think (or thought)
on this campus, we do not live in a
Utopian shell, and there will probably
come a time in each of our lives when
we will need to physically defend ourselves. A person's safety is nobody's
responsibility but their own, and we
all need to own up to that before this
campus will be truly "safe".

Schwartz's Swan Song
By

Brian Schwartz

I find myself at the end of the
spring semester of my senioryear. I
have written several opinion pieces
for The Phoenix over my four years
here. In them I have questioned the
authority and legitimacy of the government, accused modern liberals as
being as intolerant as conservatives,
and in just 600 words, I dismissed,
to my satisfaction, the notion that
there can be a creator of existence,

i.e., God.
I have also claimed that taxation
the implementation ofany "right" to
health care, education, etc., is extortion. Yet, as the "real world" descends upon me, so does the veil of
ignorance. I have yet to find a job,
but this does not get me down. Now
I realize that I have been mistaken
all theseyears, and I am so happy for
it, I can only break out in song. I
would like to thank those who inspired me to write it: the supporters
ofWelfare Rights Unions and President Clinton, for acknowledging "the

duty all of us owe to one another."
The song is to the tune of Roy
OrbisonV'YouGotlt:"
I don't want to earn what I need to survive

I deserve it because I'm alive.
Obliged—you are—it's your—duty

"Social—respons-ibil-ity"
Chorus:
Anything I want, I need it.
Anything I need, you owe it.
I've got a right—to it.
Serve me!
How my view is noble, you don't seem to

understand.
Look at the success of Soviet five year
plans.

My need—is a—claim to—what's yours.
Mercy—comes when—you're on —all
fours.
Chorus
Anything I want, I need it, anything at
a 1111111...
Your life—does not —belong—to you.
The gov-ernment—says this—is true.
Chorus
Anything I want, I need it,...serve
ME...you OWE it!

Opinions
The Flaws of a Swarthmore Education
By

David King

Forget theratings. Forget the guidebooks. We all know Swarthmore is a
good school, because we're living
through it, and we see it every day—in the campus, housing, club activities, et cetera. We attend classes that
are rigorous, demanding, and even
frustrating at times; but we can appreciate their level of difficulty, because
we know how classes can be at other
schools, and most of us consider ourselves lucky to be here.
Yet, despite our underlying appreciation for Swarthmore's being an
"academic powerhouse," we all feel
stretched a little thin at times. We
work hard at our papers and lab reports, spend many hours studying for
tests, and try to read long assignments
as meticulously as possible. But we
often just fall short. Even when we try
our hardest, put our all into it, and feel
the drive to do really well, we just
don't get the results we want.
We tend to accept our disappointment in ourselves as something we
have to deal with and get through,
without questioning the method behind our professors' madness. We take
it on faith that our professors teach us
as best they can, with the most suitable techniques and textbooks.
But I question this idea. What if we

are not getting the best education
possible? What ifprofessors actually
make courses more difficult than they
have to be? Is it possible that teaching methods are partly to blame for
our struggling with the material?
I am starting to think so for a number of reasons—reasons that stem
from what I have observed mainly in
math and science classes here. For
example: when professors write equations on the board, they often don't
clearly label them, in terms of what
variables and subscripts stand for,
and rarely do they give a model problem showing how and when to use the
given formulas. They sometimes
don't explain the theory or derivation
in laymen's terms, and furthermore,
many equations are taken from antiquated textbooks which use cryptic
and unintuitive variables.
Part of the problem lies in the textbooks themselves. They can be not
only dry and unengaging, but—in
terms of their methods of teaching
just plain obsolete. Most are not
geared towards a college student
learning the materialfor the first time,
but rather, to someone knowledgeable in the field in needof a reference
book. Few textbooks I have seen
clearly spell out theories and derivations in a straightforward and concise
manner, and even fewer use full color
—

graphics and an eye-catching layout.
Professors, too, are to blame. Although they possess a wealth of
knowledge and are eager to help,
they often don't teach at the students'
level. In class, they are quick to use
abbreviationsand shorthand, and they
may skip around between topics in
their lectures, causing confusion in
students' notes. At the beginning of
the semester, they will assume students havelearned a concept already,
when this is in fact not the case, and
because of this, there develops a discrepancy between studentand teacher
as to how fast and into how much
depth a class should go.
This brings me to my last point:
professors are infamous for telling a
class they are behind and that is necessary to move quickly to catch up.
My response to this is that the syllabus should not contain too much
material to begin with, so that each
topic can be given the same amount
of attention without having to be
rushed through. Just as students need
to pick and choose which paragraphs
are important in their reading, professors need to do the same when
planning their schedules, so as to
have enough time to devote to each.
I know professors want us to appreciate, even love, what they teach,
and that's why they work hard at it. I

realize the service they are doing us,
and I think we should be grateful for
their efforts. However, I believe the
way in which they present material to
students could be made better and
clearer—"better," meaning theirhaving a greater understanding of students' perspectives, and "clearer,"
meaning giving concise equations
with easily understood explanations.
When students get lost in a class,
it's not that they aren't trying to understand, but rather.that they simply
can't, and professors don't always
pick up on this. What's more, professors seem not to realize that some
students need to see a fully-labeled,
well explained equation, not written
in shorthand, in order to grasp concepts.
My argument is this: we're all trying our best in classes that, by nature,
are hard, and we all struggle with
complex new ideas. Professors, however, could be doing a better job of
softening the blow. They could maintain a better perspective on what we're
going through and understand that
ideas sometimes have to be simplified first, and then presented in the
formal, professional way. With this
in mind, they could make the learning process far more palatable for
those ofus in the big pond Swarthmore
who merely try to keep afloat.

Letters to the Editor
The Poenis Humor Trivialized Personal Religious Beliefs; Not Every Reader Was Laughing
To the Editor:
For all its obsession with sex and
the human body, I found last week's
The Poenis a good attempt at making
people laugh. And I have to admit, I
did laugh, for some analogies drawn
were truly funny. But I was not laughing for long.
"Crowded Bus Explodes, Allah
Claims Responsibility" exclaimed the
headline of one of the articles in The
Poenis. I take offense.
I somehow thought it needless for
me to repeat my standard"listen while
I tell you what the inaccurate mediaimages of Islam are" speech here, for
Swarthmore is famed as a community of informed, rigorous, questioning minds. I was, sadly, mistaken.
First we had the radio-show cracks
on how the Muslim Students' Asso-

ciation would hijack the college
shuttles for their cause, and now this.
And that is only what some individuals have been hard-headed enough to
come out with.
I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow chalkings appeared on Magill
Walk exclaiming another preposterous notion or slur against Muslims,
as there have been against other minorities.
Let me explain this. 'Allah' is the
Arabic term for God. However, the
usageof this term is exclusive mainly
to the Muslim world, it having been
incorporated into the vocabulary of
Muslims world-wide.
Applying this term to a mindless,
frivolous, nonsensical, sorry attempt
at humour offends Muslims, Jews,
Israelis, Palestinians, and every other

person concerned with the peaceprocess in the Middle East. The subject
of this article a delicate and sensitive
issue in the political arena. Its heading is an attack on the name and
beliefs thatMuslims around the world
and on this campus find sacred.
I fear I will have to spell it outto the
staffof Spike, and every other person
who saw any humour at all in this
article: 'Muslim' or 'lslam' is not
synonymous with 'terrorism'.
The Muslim students on this campus are very much a part of the community that is Swarthmore, in the
same way that Jewish, Christian,
Buddhist, Hindu, Mormon, Quaker,
Universalist or students of any other
religious hue are. And if you ever
make the mistake again of taking the
liberty to make a crack against some-

thing we hold sacred, we will take
offense and react in the very same
way that any other conscientious
member of any other minority here
would.
So enough, I say. Enough propagation of these myths. Enough perpetuation of these stereotypes. The world
is too diverse a place (world meaning
the globe, not theirrestricted parameters of an American 2.2 children
picket-fenced suburb) for us to allow
ourselves the relative bliss of ignorance.
If the staff members of Spike are
underexposed, unthinking, insensitive non-members of the larger world
community, so be it. I appeal to all the
other members of this community to
sit up and take note.

Volunteerism is a Necessary Contribution to Society; Lend a Helping Hand When You Can
To the Editor:
I would like to comment on an
article I found in last week's Phoenix. "Volunteerism Should Come
From the Heart, Not Duty," read the
headline. The headline caught my
eye, even more so when I realized
that the author was the same Brian
Schwartz who had posters put up all
over campus saying "Clinton wants
your life!" posters whose basic gist is
that the Clinton administration in
particular and the government in general is evil because it says that selflessness is a good way to live and that
selfishness is destructive to society.
Setting my teeth, I began to read.
The state of Maryland, I was told,
made community service apart of the
requirements for high school graduation. "Good for them," I thought.
Turns out I was wrong. Thisprogram
is actually going to destroy good will
in America as we know it. Although
the basic point of high school is to
prepare students for college and for
life, this particular lesson apparently
should not be part of said preparation. Although Brian praises selflessness as a good aspect of human nature in his article, it is not important
enough to be part of the education
process. I guess dissecting frogs is.
I was rather upset by this, as you
can imagine I might be. Most of the
things I would praise turned out to be
evil, until I realized, as I read on, that
all of Brian Schwartz's articles are
nothing but a rant against the evil
American government that wants to
control its people via taxes and public programs. It is a common theme in
his series ofarticles that we should be
as free as we possibly can; absolute
freedom at all costs, regardless of
what the ramifications are on other
people. As long as one is free from
any obligations, one can be happy. I
am reminded of a letter to the editor I
saw a year ago back home in my local
paper; the local school board was
reminded by a concernedcitizen that
it works for the taxpayers, and not the
children. Never mind that the children might have inadequate schooling; I don't want to have to pay for
them, was the underlying gist. I'm
sure Brian would have us agree. The
more we are taxed, it seems, the worse

off we are, and the more despotic our
government becomes.
This is not to say that I don't believe in freedom. I see freedom as a
wonderful thing. I also see that it can
be taken too far. The nation has to
have a given philosophy, and work
towards the augmentation ofit. That's
why America went through that nonsense of theVietnam War a few years
back, and why there was a Bill of
Rights set up a few more years back—all for the augmentation of thenation's
philosophies. Of course, some of you
might say, theAbsolute Freedom that
we want and deserve should be our
nation's philosophy. Youknow something? We tried Absolute Freedom
before. It didn'twork. Afterthe Revolutionary War, the Articles of Confederation were set up. I learned that
in the fifth grade. I also learned in the
fifth grade that the Articles failed in
less than a decade. It just doesn't
work.
Why not? Why won' tit work? Well,
to tell the truth, society cannot function without a given set of values.
Check that; it can function; it just
cannot function in the way it should.
The more these values promote the
self rather than society, the more society begins to crumble, and by
"crumble" I mean that the people
who most need the help of some kind
of organized society will have the
least amount of help given them. I say
"crumble" because I see this as one of
the worst evils society can perform—the ignoring of its people. That is
when freedom is taken too far, I think.
If society is nothing more than an
augmentation of the self, we become
1910 again with children working
twelve hour shifts in factories. Or
worse, we could become little more
than apes in the jungle struggling
viciously with each other over a scrap
of food.
Brian made specific reference in
his article to feminism. He points out
a flaw in our nation's reasoning: we
can generically say that people have
a duty to serve other people, but we
cannot say to women that they should
serve men. I seem to recall the same
point made in a previous Schwartz
article; he must see it as important. Of
course, the two examples cannot be

compared. How can one say that telling a human being that he is obligated
to other human beings simply be-

cause they are of equal importance is
the same as telling a woman she is
obligated to a man because she is
inferior? It cannot be done. They cannot be compared. This argument holds
no water at all.
Of course, this generic rant against
government was only the theme of
Brian's article, and not the actual
topic. The actual topic was "the destruction of good will," first of all
because of government programs to
teach high school students community service. Well, I'll just say again
what I said before. One must attend
high school by law because high
school prepares one for the life one
will live. School, especially high
school, is a place where you learn
things you might not learn at home.
There are a lot of people who are not
taught in the home that "helping
people is rewarding," to use Brian's
own words, and I think that learning
to give as well as take is one of the
most important lessons that can ever
be taught; if that's not education,
then I don'tknow what is. Naturally,
such a lesson should be taught in
schools, and one way to do that is to
institute this "evil" program.
The article also said that such programs are inherently wrong because
when you help someone, it should
come only "from the heart" and not
because of a "sense of duty." Let me
draw a metaphor. I made reference
earlier to the Vietnam War. There
were a lot of people who supported
the war "from the heart," but what
came "from the heart" was just what
Brian speaks against: "a sense of
duty!" It was with a sense of duty to
their nation and their nation's ideals
that caused patriots to salute the flag
so proudly during the 1960's. America
itself fought the war out of a sense of
duty to protect the world from the
supposed evil of Communism.
It is with the same kind of sense of
duty that I want to help people, and it
is with the same kind of sense ofduty
that I want people to be helped. But
now, instead of protecting people
from Communism by means of violence, I want to protect them from

poverty and death by means ofmercy.
Instead of duty towards America, instead of a duty to support a war, I feel
duty towards the human race that I
am so proud to be a part of, and that
duty comes straight from the heart. If
it came from anywhere else, would I
give a bum money from my own
pocket just because he asked me to?
Of course not. Brian seems very ambiguous on this issue; the duty that he
so readily condemns seems to come
from the heart that he so strongly
praises. I guess he means that the
government should not force duty
upon someone. Well, obviously,
America as a nation (the oppressors
who force duty upon us) feels just as
obligated as us (the poor, oppressed
masses) to help the impoverished and
the needy; otherwise, there would be
no taxes, there would be no laws,
there would just be a free-for-all for
survival. That is why we have this
duty "forced" upon us; it is part of
America. More than that: it is part of
being human.
I don't understand why Brian and
the Libertarian party ask the questions, "Why should I help you? Why
should I help anyone?" Why can't
they see the answer? There are parts
of humanity called benevolence and
mercy. I think it is the purpose of
society to ensure that as many people
as possible lead lives that do not
degrade them to inhuman acts—l
made reference earlier to children
working in factories for twelve hour
shifts. Why is that?Simply because I
am sickened by the sight of suffering.
I have no answer to why I am so
sickened, other than that I feel an
overpowering love for mankind. I
cannot stand the fact that, right now,
while I write this late on a beautiful
Tuesday night, millions are sleeping
on park benches because there is absolutely no place for them to go!
How can any of us sleep well at night
with that hanging over our heads? I
implore all ofyou; listen to the cries
below your feet! Your life is your
own, but you are also men and women,
and it is up to those who have to make
sure that those who have not can
survive like the humans they are. If
we don't do it, who will?

One More Thing...

One Last Thing...
By

Vincent Jones

Being that the school year is nearing the end and I did not have time to
put together something more original, I thought it would be appropriate
to reflect. More specifically, I thought
I could comment on the article written by the other Vincent Jones in the
Poenis about "the man," make a few
concluding remarks on the debate
spurred by my article about Black
racism, and bid adieu to the class of
'97, all in one shot. I know it sounds
like a bit much and somewhat disjointed, but it will all make sense in
the end...l hope.
While reading the article written
by Vincent Jones (?) entitled "Don't
Let the Man Get You Down," I was
struck by his point that "the man" is
"a highly ambiguous concept." This
stuck outto me because it's so true...in
a way. If you consider that in the not
so distant past, any white person—the mayor, the storeowner, the janitor, and the bum on the street—could
get away with calling Negroes,
Niggers, denying Black people service anywhere, or a myriad of other
things. Now, those same people (and
their children who have been influenced by them) must suppress their
racist tendencies due to the enactment of various legislation.
In other words, overtly racists acts
have become to harder to identify.
No longer do we have a Bull Conner
unleashing attack dogs on peaceful
protesters. Instead, contemporary
America is satiated with politicians
who happen to neglect double digit
unemployment rates among Black
America and "average" people who
can so easily blame "inner city youth"
(code word for nigger and spick) for
the problems affecting our nation.
So in that regard, "the man" is an
ambiguous concept. And to see that
"the man" still pervades our society
just look at some of the articles in the
Poenis for examples ofhis influence.
Only "the man" with his overly sexist
ideals could see no problem making
fun of a series of attacks against female students in a "public safety
brief." Who else could be responsible for the flat out stupid article
entitled "Crowded Bus Explodes,
AllahClaims Responsibility" but "the
man" who is probably neither a Jew,
nor Islamic. I could go on but I think
you get my point. Only a society
which fosters the values of "the man"
would generate a staff of writers who
find the aforementioned subject matter funny.

Regarding the ongoing debate
about racism, I have one thing to
say—wake up! Anyone who believes

that racism and systemic power don't
go hand-in-hand needs to enter the
real world. Consider, for example, a
situation where Sheniqua VasquezCheng comes into contact withDavid
Duke—aformer KKK GrandWizard
who garnered thousands of votes in
his bid for governor that Ford
O'Connell and Francis Amar must
have forgot about. Sheniqua could
just walk away if she felt uncomfortable around the self-proclaimed racist and that would be the end of the
matter by the definition used by Josh
Miller. However, in the real world
people like David (or people reared
by such individuals) wrote the founding document of this nation, own
most of the businesses, write school
curriculum, control the military, etc.
As a result, Sheniqua would be hard
pressed to find a place where David
Duke's racism didn't impact her life.
On the other hand, David could
enter a situation where people like
Sheniqua despise him and feel secure
knowing that he could simply leave
and things would be fine. Moreover,
if something did happen to him, he
could rest assured knowing that the
police would be more apt to believe
him over the residents of the neighborhood. Or Sheniqua's compatriots
would be less apt to harm David with
the knowledge that the odds of an
African-American getting the death
penalty for killing a white person
greatly outweigh those if the circumstances were reversed.
With that said, I would like to take
this opportunity implore the class of
'97 to look deeper into matters as you
leave this place. Don't just laugh at
something without thinking about the
underlying principles. And if you do
laugh at something like the "Public
Safety Brief about the simple assaults in the Poenis, what does that
say about you and your values? Does
that mean that you sanction violence
against women?
Or don't just take any job because
it pays well. Think about what your
intellectual prowess will be used to
promote and promulgate. Consider
the investmentand consumption patterns of your firm. Look at the people
you will be working with. How do
they fit with your values? After four
years of school at an elite liberal arts
college like Swarthmore, you'll have
the privilege to pick and choose. So
please do so wisely.
And lastly, don't forget about me
because I'll be giving you a call for
money around 2026. No, I won't be
"poor, friendless and totally unskilled." Quite the contrary, I'll be
running for Mayor of LA, Governor
of CA, or President of the US.

Coca-Cola is Not
Carbonated Immorality
By Bryan

Gobin

Thanks to last week's Phoenix, I
am privileged to be aware that the
Coca-Cola corporation is sponsoring
political rallies in support of the local
dictator as part of its deal to conduct
business in Nigeria. This is absolutely horrendous. How could any
moral individual strike a deal with an
undemocratic government in order to
make a buck? Outraged by this relationship, the Nigerian people are protesting against this immorality by
buying more Coke whose market
share in the cool beverage market
may soon surpass the popularity of
water. Having made the association
between Coke and dictatorship at
company sponsored political events,
one would think the citizens would

respond by boycotting Coke. A boycott would either cause Coke to divest from the country or make other
arrangements for contributing to political figures. The buy-more approach has yet to demonstrate its efficacy in changing corporate policy,
however, human rights activists are
closely monitoring the protest campaign. The Coca-Cola company has
responded by stating that business in
Nigeria is highly profitable. I hope
Swarthmore College has stocked up
on Coke.
Having learned about corporate
vices abroad, I decided to investigate
malfeasance at home. My extensive
research surfaced startling facts about
political manipulation which threatens the future of democracy in
America. Big corporations, specialinterest groups, and even private citizens are directly financing political
parties who use this money to spread
mud-slinging political propaganda
through the mass media, or mass distortion as informed viewers call it.

Coke probably contributes far more
to the Republican and Democratic
parties in one election year than the
sum total ofall contributions to dictatorships. I learned that even private
citizens, especially those Hollywood
ladies, are active in the fundraising
activities of the mainstream parties.
Even worse, every person who fills
out a tax form has the option to contributea dollarto political campaigns.
Nigeria is not South Africa. Dictatorship will prevail regardless of whether
or not Coke sponsors political rallies
as the price for doing business in
Nigeria. Furthermore, I would hypothesize that Nigerians don't swallow political propaganda any more or
less with Coke sponsorship.
Given the scope of corporate and
individual intrusion in thedemocratic
process, there are some concrete steps
every Swattie should take. 1) Don't
buy anything because all business
wants to influence policy, even when
it can't afford a big contribution; 2)
Don't talk to anybody, because they
have contributed to a political campaign via their tax form; of course if
you are a white male, you shouldn't
be talking to anybody anyway if you
read The Phoenix opinions—put your
hand down in class; give somebody
else a chance to speak (because they
have slow hand-raisingreflexes); and
take victimization studies (no prior
critical thinking required); 3) Prepare for the return of Hale-Bopp
comet 4) move to Greenland; 5) if
you can' t afford the Eskimo way (Inuit
Peoples), move to North Philly or
Chester, three areas with the same
amount of political and economic
activity. Otherwise, swallow the
rhetoric and join the campaign party,
or buy one. And remember, Drink
Coke, It's the Real Thing—all the
caffeine and lower tuition rates.

If You Have Nothing Else to Do This Summer...

of dollars have been spent on
entertaining America this summer.
With such high-profile event pictures
as The Lost World and Titanic, Hollywood
hopes to rake in the cash with an even bigger
summer than 1996's record-setter. Here's a
breakdown of what's in store, with personal
commentary by Capt. Leßoy "Buddy"
Warnicker (Ret.) of Shadow Force C.

May 2 Breakdown
Summer doesn't officially start for awhile,
but Paramount Pictures is hoping to get the
jumpon the competition with theKurt Russell
thriller Breakdown, directed by newcomer
Jonathan Mostow. I've seen it, and it's a
crackerjack piece of work, slick, efficient,
and just plain effective. I think if enough
people discover it it'll be a sleeper hit. This
-

movie 'only' cost $4O million. Also opening
today is Mike Myers as Austin Powers
International Man of Mystery.

—

May 9 The Fifth Element
Probably the first real event flick of the
summer is Luc Besson's The Fifth Element,
starringBruce Willis, Gary Oldman, and Milla
Jovovich. It's a huge sci-fi epic taking place
in the 23rd century about the search (by
bleached cab driver Willis) for the elusive
Fifth Element to complementing the Four
Elements of ancient Greek science. The advance word: It's not the big action movie
everyone thinks it is, and it's pretty strange.
This one had a mere $9O million pricetag.
-

May 23 The Lost World
With Memorial Day comes the longawaited (by some) sequel to Jurassic Park.
Yes, Spielberg et al. have returned to make
-

The Lost World, which was formerly a screenplay masquerading as a crappy Michael
Crichton novel. Old faces: Jeff Goldblum,
"Dickie" Attenborough. New faces: Julianne
Moore, Pete Postlethwaite. The trailer is surprisingly bad and flat-looking, and I can't
imagine how this movie is going to get past
the tired McDonald's advertising campaign
supplement it has become. We'll see. Price
tag: $BO million.
On May 23rd, however, I will be seeing
Addicted To Love, that Matthew BroderickMeg Ryan movie shot partly at the good old
SproulObservatory. How it was awarded the
unenviable task of opening against Jurassic
Park 2, we'll never know.

Jane 6 Con Air
-

In case you have gotten tired of watching
The Rock (I was tired of it after the first 5
minutes), producer Jerry Bruckheimer (sans
late partner Don Simpson) has assembled
Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich,
Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi for Con
Air, a huge testosterone-laden action flick
about a bunch of nasty cons being transported
by air. Needless to say, not everything goes as
planned. Directed by commercial auteur
Simon West. Price Tag: $BO million.

June 13 Speed 2
-

Included in the "Hopelessly Undertalented
and Overexposed" file is Sandra Bullock,
who has reunited with crazed director Jan
Deßont for Speed 2: Cruise Control in what
is shaping up to be the dumbest movie ever
made. Now, I don't want to judge it before it
comes out, but consider this: the movie takes
place on a big unexciting cruise ship; Keanu
is nowhere to be found, and has been replaced
with Jason Patric; and the trailer sucks. The
movie is also out-of-control and in trouble,

the price tag is already reportedly at $l6O

July 2 Titanic, Men In Black
The July 4 weekend will be the summer's
greatest prize, with James Cameron' s Titanic
and Barry Sonnenfeld's Men In Black going
head-to-head. Titanic is an enormous epic
starring Kate Winslet andLeonardoDiCaprio
as a pair of star-crossed lovers aboard the
doomed vessel. The story comes with a modern-day framing device, with Cameronregular Bill Paxton as a researcher bringing things
up from the icy depths. Cameron has gone
crazy on this movie, taking even longer than
normal, shooting for months and months, and
building an enomous, almost full-size replica
of the Titanic to achieve his vision. In fact, the
July 2 date is still totally up in the air. This is
the most expensive movie ever made, the
price tag is $2OO million.

the unflattering and ridiculous Batgirl costume. George Clooney is not Batman, and his
smarmy line delivery will make you cringe,
as will his double chin peeking through the
Batsuit. The trailer for the film also features
the "Hockey Team from Hell." Did someone
get paid to think that up? Price Tag: $lOO
million.

June 27 Face/Off, Hercules
For all of you Nicholas Cage fans-it's a big
summer. On June 27 you'll also be able to
catch him in John Woo's Face/Off, starring
-

Cage as a mastermind international terrorist
and John Travolta as the man who changes
his identity to catch him. As someone who
has followed Woo from brilliance (A Better
Tomorrow 11. The Killer) to mediocrity (Broken Arrow), I'm not holding my breath. The
preview features some Woo-style footage,
though, with Travoltaand Cage flying through
the air in slow motion firing two handguns,
but I wish ChowYun-Fat were in it instead of
dopey bloated-looking Travolta. Price tag:s7o

Also on June 27 is Disney's obligatory

ing with intergalactic scum. This is being
directed by Get Shorty's Barry Sonnenfeld,
and apparently has some really nifty special
effects. Price tag: $lOO million.
After the July 4 weekend there's Jodie
Foster and Matthew McConaughey in Robert
Zemeckis' Contact, a sci-fi flick based on a
book by Carl Sagan. It opens July 11. Also,
on July 25 there's Conspiracy Theory, a Richard (Superman) Donner action flick starring Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, as well as
Air Force One, a presidential-kidnapping
action-thriller starring Harrison Ford, Glenn
Close and Gary Oldman, directed by
Wolfgang (Outbreak, Das Boot) Petersen.

Evita is Alan Parker's lavish new adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice
musical about Eva Peron, much-loved wife
of Juan Peron, the dictator of Argentina during the 1940's. The film follows Eva fromher
lowly beginning, to herradio and film career,
to her long relationship with Peron and, finally, her death at a young age, although the
material is so stylized that few will mistake it
for real history.
AlanParker is the perfect choice ofdirector
for this material, as he is certainly one of
mainstream cinema's most consistently offbeat directors. Many of his films focus on
music of some kind, from the outright musicals Pink Floyd-The Wall and Fame to the
brilliant electronic score by Giorgio Moroder
for Parker's 1978film Midnight Express and
his giddy comedy about an Irish rock band,
The Committments.
Of course, someone suitably larger-thanlife needed to play the title character, and the
producers found their leading lady in Madonna. Her acting career has always been
spotty (anyone rememberBody OfEvidencel),
and, actually, Evita requires little ofher other
than to sing really well, which she does, and
to look really good, which she also does.
Antonio Banderas, in a thankless role, is the
narrator whopops up all through the movie in
different guises representing the people of
Argentina.
The wisest choice in the cast is Jonathan
Pryce as Juan Peron. Pryce is a British actor
who has been woefully underrepresented in
American movies. His performance in Terry
Gilliam's Brazil has always been one of my
favorites, and in Evita it's Pryce who steals
the show.
When Evita started, I thought, "Oh no, it's
all wrong!" Parker had recreated the period
so well that the songs seemed terribly out of
place, and, well, I actually started laughing
when they were singing. And I doubt there
are many people in our generation who have
ever seen a movie that's sung all the way
through.
As Evita went on, however, it really grew
on me. Its jangled rhythms seem more appropriate as the story moves along, and the
vastness of the whole production (there really
is a cast of thousands) seems somehow more
fitting when set to music. Pryce also has a
largerrole later in the movie, and he manages
to find the right tone for just about every
scene.
Evita isn't perfect, and, indeed, at 2 hours
and 15 minutes, it's way too long. But it's
certainly an interesting and involving diversion. Be warned, however: it takes a little
getting used to.
Shine is playing at 7:30 and 10 p.m. on
Friday; Evita is playing at 7:30 and 10 p.m.
on Saturday. Both movies will be shown in the
LP AC Cinema.

Farewell:

The
Price is
Right

Think

of your best friend. Think of her
happy, smiling face. His bright, twin
kling eyes. The way her nose wrinkles
when she laughs or the way his head gets all
puffy and swollen after he has been crying.
Think about how much joy and laughter
she has brought to you over the years.
Are you getting misty eyed?
Good.
Now think about what you would sell your

best friend for.
I mean if you were walking down the street
with your best friend and some guy came up
said, "Hey, I wanna buy your
friend. What's your asking price?" What
would you want?
I know the more concrete, natural-sciencesminded of you might as well just turn to the
athlete of the week right now because you
hate this type of hypothetical question. There
are two many variables and unknowns. If
someone asks, "When a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?" you want to know
if the tree is in the Northern or Southern
Hemisphere or how the depletion of the ozone
layer in that area affected the mating practices of the Central American quetzal.
Now, I can't answer these questions for
you because I don't even know what a quetzal
is, although my RA says it's a really good
Scrabble word because it uses both a "q" and
a "z," not that I would know because my
sisters were always too busy to play Scrabble
with me so I was reduced to reading the
dictionary alone in my room, which probably
helped my SAT scores but not my social
skills. I still don't play well with others. And
I run with scissors.
So if you want to know where this nameless stranger will be taking your friend after
you sell her to him, I don't know. He's just
taking her away and you will never see her
again.
And also, if you want to sell your best
friendfor some lofty purpose like world peace
or the end of cruelty to animals, I guess I can't
stop you, but I think you are not answering
the question in the true spirit in which it was
asked. Sure, we would all sell our best friends
to save Fluffy, the long eared bunny rabbit
from the clutches of the evil Maybelline empire. Most of us, thank heavens, are pampered, sheltered, quasi-socialist, bleeding
heartliberals, and we' ddo anything for Fluffy.
But this is a purely hedonistic, materialistic
question.
I don't think most Swatties would sell their
best friends for money. We're intelligent,
gifted people who supposedly have good
market potential. Someday in the future, we
will be The Man and will be living comfortably off the misfortunes of others, so we
won't need to sell our friends for money
alone.
So what would most people ask for?
Good MCAT scores? A controlling interest in the Pringle corporation? A Taco Bell in
Kohlberg?
One person said he would sell his best
friend for two handfuls of heroin, but I think
that he is either overestimating the street
value of heroin or underestimating the street
value ofhis friend, because I don't think two
handfuls of heroin can go that far. Plus, two
handfuls of heroin would be quite unwieldy,
especially if there was a sudden or brisk
breeze. I'd want that heroin in a Tupperware
container or something.
I was, at first, appalled when a first-year on
my hall after being asked the question said,
"Well, I don'tknow. I'm not very materialistic, and I already have a girlfriend..."
I thought that this was probably the worst
thing I had ever heard in my entire life. He
would sell his best friend for sex? For a few
cheap thrills, he would give away the person
who meant more to him than anyone else in
the world? Is this what we've come to?
And then I started to think a little more
about itand decided yes, that is what we have
come to. Swatties don't want money because
we have the skills to get that already. However, we don't all have the skills necessary to
get a significant other. That would take charm,
charisma, and other social capacities, all things
that we dictionary reading, Scrabble playing
Swatties don't have.
Pathetic as it may be, I think many of us
would sell our best friends for a babe.

Ending the Season in Grand Style:
Women Sluggers Slam the 'Fords
By

Jean Quinn

The Softball team finished its season by sweeping arch-rival
Haverford. The Garnet were 4-25
overall, 2-14 in the conference this
year. The doubleheader against the
Fords also marked the final games in
the career of Swat's lone senior on
the team, Nette Wittgert.
Earlier in the week, the Garnet traveled to Franklin and Marshall to play
two games that had been postponed
from weeks earlier. Swat dropped the
first game, 8-0, but fought back and
nearly won the second contest, giving up a two run lead in the final
inning to lose 5-4. Jen VanderVeer
'99 and Wendy Lawrence '99 each
picked up a hit, but on the whole, the
team struggled with the Diplomats'
slower pitching. In addition, the defensive end of the Garnet's gamehad

problems too. Coach Cheri Goetcheus
commented, "We committed 5 errors
despite having some individual
unique defensive plays." Swat did
have its sparkling moments in the
field by executing many double plays.
Swat turned things around in the
second game. "We rebounded well
and held them scoreless for 5 innings.
Defensively, we had some stellar
plays and played errorless ball. Offensively, we erupted in the sth inning for 4 runs. F & M crept back into
it by stringing a few hits together and
aggressive base running. The winning run was scored on a walk in the
bottom of the 7th. It-was visibly slipping away from us and it was difficult
to stop, especially after we had hung
in there so well defensively," said
Goetcheus.
Lurah Hess '99, Jean Quinn '99,
Witgert, and DanaLehman '9B each
acquired two hits in the outing. Mary
Beth Alvarez '9B commented, "I
thought we picked it up and played
tighter the second game and were

This week marked the end of the
Intramural season as championships
began and students prepare for finals.
In the qualifying game for the Quarter-finals of IM soccer the Erotimus
Prime beat the Women's Soccer
squad. The Primers defeated the
Women 5-1 to advance to the Semifinals against That Old Gang, who
had a bye during the Quarter-finals.
The other Quarter-final match never
happened as The Mercenaries and
the Mertz Team both forfeited the
game. This forfeit allowed Women's
Soccer to return to playoff action to
face a tough Faculty/Staff team. The
Faculty, who had a bye during the
Quarter-finals, soundly defeated the
Women's squad 4-1 in the Semi-finals. They now await That Old Gang
in the championship final on Thursday (5/1) who slipped by Erotimus
Prime with a 4-3 victory.
The Softball action was all hard
core this week as Westbrook's Warriors took on the DU Wrecking Crew
in the championship game on Tuesday afternoon. Lots of slugging and
plenty of defense kept this game a
close contest to the bitter end, but
Westbrook's Warriors came out on
top as they beat the DU Wrecking
Crew 8-5 and won the coveted IM
Champions t-shirts.
This week also marks the last IM
event of the academic year. The InLine Skating race is going to be held
this Monday, May sth, at 1 p.m. Both
long and short courses are available
to the participants. Course descriptions are located on the IM Board at
the West end of Parrish, or contact

for the Garnet whose record does not
attest to their capabilities.
"People who say it's not about winning but about how you play probably haven't lost as many games as

we won. It was as simple as that.
Before, I think we made it too complex—trying to analyze what was

From the viewpoint ofall who saw
theHaverford games, the team proved
their potential and finally came together and played as a team.

Men's Lacrosse

Attempts to Salvage Season
By

Patrick Donaghy

Last Saturday the men's lacrosse
had a chance to finish off its
season in style against a strong
Haverford squad. In a rivalry as heated
as one with the Fords, a one-win
season is considered a success if the
lone win comes against the rival. To
further fuel the fire of the Tide, a
team member printed comments by
the 'Fords head coach.
With all distractions notwithstanding, the teams were ready for a battle,
and the Garnet came out strong. After
spotting Haverford a one goal lead,
seniorBen Henwood made one ofhis
27 saves and sent an outlet pass to a
streaking Erik Johnson '9B. Johnson
found fellow classmate Steve Shin,
whoripped an upper corner shot to tie
the game. Minutes later, Shin continued his fine offensive play by threading the needle to middie Marcus Shin
'OO, who found the back of the net to
take the lead.
As the offense heated up, the defense became physical. Tucker
Zengerle 'OO completely dominated
the league's leading scorer, consistently stripping his opponent. Aaron
Hultgren '9B, Alex DeShields '9B
and Nimish Dave '99 threw many
takeaway checks, forcing numerous
turnovers. The defense had played
tough all year, and this game would
be no different. Two "trash" goals by
the Fords madethe score at the end of
one quarter 3-2 in favor ofHaverford.
The halftime deficit was extended
to 7-3 with the lone goalcoming from
Toby Patterson, one of many freshmen who continued to impress
throughout the year. In the third quarteam

The Warmothers started Saturday

Both teams fought for every point,
but Penn State eventually pulled out
an 11-9victory. Delila Leber '9B had
six defense blocks, one of which resulted in an unintentional split. Worthy of note was senior Katy Harrod's
entrance into the weekend's play. In
the third point of the game, Katy was
open in the end zone for a pass. In a
move reminiscent of an action hero,

Last weekend, several of the top
runners and jumpers on the men's
and women's track and field teams
were invited to compete in the annual
Penn Relays at the University ofPennsylvania. The level of competition
was extremely high with Division I,
II and 111 schools present.
The women's 4x400m relay team
of Jill Wildonger '97, Stephanie Herring '99, Danielle Duffy '9B, and
CatherineLaine '9B had an outstanding performance on Thursday, cap-

turing first place in their section, the
Mid-Atlantic Conference. Laine and
Duffy ran thefastest splits, each crossing the finish line at 59 seconds, despite Duffy being hit with a baton by
a Western Maryland runner. The team
ran 4:05.0, finishing nearly three seconds ahead of the second place team.
The 4xloom relay of Wonda Joseph 'OO, Desiree Peterkin 'OO,
Wildonger, and Laine also ran a strong
race on Thursday, finishing within a
half-second of the school record.
On Friday, the men's 4xloo relay
team consisting of Mason Tootell
'99, Ariss DerHovanessian 'OO, David
Lane '97, and Walid Gellad '97 finished the race against strong Division
I competition at 44.2. The 4x400m
relay team of Tootell, Amber Thompson '97, Gellad, and Eric Pakurar
'97 ran 3:25.0, almost a second faster
than their season best at the Pop
Haddleton Memorial Mile Relay.
Saturday afternoon, SteveDawson
'OO became only the second jumper
in the history of Swarthmore track
and field to qualify for the individual
high jump competition and the first
to clear a height. Dawson jumped
6'7.5", taking 12th place out of approximately 40 competitors from all
three divisions. Only three other Di-

vision 111 jumpers qualified for the
competition.
While some team members were
still at the Penn Relays, the rest ofthe
Swat track and field team traveled to
Moravian College in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania to compete in the BlueGrey Classic. LofrinNelson 'OO competed the 400 hurdles for the first
time, winning his heat and crossing
the finish line at 67 seconds. Liam
O'Neill 'OO won the 800 at 1:57,
with Fred Gerson '99 performing a
personal best at 1:58 and Graham
Lucks '9B close behind. In the 200m,
Gellad, Julian Haffner '9B and
Amilcar Priestley 'OO all had their
best performances finishing at 23.0,
23.8 and 24.47 respectively. In the
100m, more personal records were
set with Haffner at 11.59 and Giovi
Grasso-Knight '9B at 11.64. The
men's success continued on the field
with Priestley performing his best
ever in the long jump covering a
distance of 18'9" and Lane with a
personal best at 20' 1.75".
On the women' s side, DanielleWall
had a personal best performance in
the 1500
finishing at an impressive 5:00.3. Karen Lloyd 'OO ran
the 800 m at 2:39 followed close behindby Sarah Howard '9B. Wildonger
ran a great race in the 100 dash even
though she had just competed in the
strenuous Penn Relays. "The meet
was a lot of fun because it was so
sunny. And there were a ton ofreally
talented people at the meet trying to
get in good marks in new events before Conferences next weekend,"
commented Lloyd.
As their season comes to an end,
the track and field team is preparing

With Haverford holding a comfortable lead in the fourth, the Garnet, typical of games all year, fought

The second day started off on a

It was an eventful weekend, to say
the least, for the Garnet Tide. On the
way to finishing out what had been a
nightmarish season, the Garnet Tide
put a positive spin on things, reeled
off a two-game winning streak and
made some history.
On Friday, the Garnet Tide hit the
road to take on the Ursinus Bears.
The Tide jumped out to a 3-0 lead
early. Starter Josh Roth '99 turned in
a solid effort, working seven innings
and sparing the bullpen with a doubleheader the next day. Roth worked
into the eighth inning, but could not
record an out.
Into the maelstrom came Steve
Farneth' 00. Farneth has been a workhorse for the Tide all season, as a
starter and as a reliever. Though his
record won't merit him any postseason all-star team attention, Farneth
was the most consistent pitcher on
the Garnet Tide staff.
With the Tide leading 8-6, Ursinus
had loaded the bases with no outs.
The first batter Farneth faced lined
out to left field, not deep enough to
score the run. The next batter
grounded back to Farneth, starting a
1-2-3 double play. Farneth allowed
one hitter to reach safely in the 9th
before slamming thedoor shut, notching his second save of the season.
A beautiful Saturday afternoon was
the backdrop for Saturday's historic
doubleheader against Haverford.
Coach Frank Agovino handed the
ball to Farneth in the first game,after
having saved the Ursinus win less
than 24 hours before. The bats were
out early for the Garnet Tide, staking
Farneth out to a 7-0 lead in the first
two innings, and adding another run
in the fifth to make the score 8-0. On
offense, it was the usual suspects
Jeremy Bonder '97, Pat Straub '97,
and Carlo Fitti 'OO each chipped in
two hits, two runs scored, and a run
batted in. Rufus Frazer '99, who suffered through an injury plagued campaign, blasted a home run to center
field, his first extra base hit of the
season. While the bats were busy
burying Haverford, Farneth was
mowing down Haverford batters, his
only blemishes being a hit batter and
a base on balls. The usually unsure
Garnet Tide defense made three errors, all of which proved to be harm-

less.
Farneth reached the seventh, the
owner of a no-hitter. With the added
pressure on himself and his fielders,
Farneth and Co. got down to business. When Jose Villaviencio '99
squeezed leather around a two-out
fly ball, the story was complete. The
no-hitter was the first in the four-year
history of Centennial Conference
baseball, and the first Swarthmore
no-hitter in recent memory.
"I really didn't know if I had a nohitter or not, until Eric (Nebbia '00)
yelled it out to me," said Farneth. "I
think being unsure kind of helped me
focus a little better. Ifsomebody had
gotten a hitoff of me, I thinkI would
have justbeen able to shrug it offand
keep pitching the way I had been. I
really don't remember the celebration. I remember Jose making the
catch, and everybody tackled
This really was a dream come true."
For his efforts, Farneth was named

the Centennial Conference Player of
the Week.
Two years ago, the Garnet Tide
followed a dramatic first game victory over Haverford to get shelled in
the nightcap. Only the heroes (Jeff
Gans '95 in 1995) and the starting
pitcher changed (Straub), not the end
result. Unfortunately for Dave Giles
'9B, he was the pitcher that took the

mound for the Garnet Tide after the
adrenaline rush was over, dropping
the season finale 15-4.
The Garnet Tide finished this season with a record of 5-28. A number
of younger players made splashes
this season, including Farneth (2-7,2
saves, 3.47 ERA), Fitti (.276, IHR,
23 RBI), and Joe Aleffi 'OO (.267,
IHR, 12 RBI). Their continued development,along with improvedplay
from fellow rookies Brian LopezStillerand George Rosenbaum, along
withsolid recruiting classes, will give
the Garnet Tide firm footing for the
future.
