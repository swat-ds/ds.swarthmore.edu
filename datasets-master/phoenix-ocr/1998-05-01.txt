Housing Lottery Leaves
Some Students Homeless
Will New Dorm Alleviate Housing Crunch?
by Wendy Kemp
Lottery season swept through
campus earlier this month, and
while almost all Swatties managed to nab housing somewhere
or another, several unlucky ones
are presently homeless come fall.
At the moment, there are 20
members of the rising junior class
who are on the waiting list for
singles, and 58 rising sophomores on the waiting list for
doubles. While it is not likely that
these students will receive housing in a dorm of their choice, they
should all wind up with a place
to live before the fall semester
begins. "The chances are quite
good," said Dean of Residential
Life Myrt Westphal, "since the
College is committed to housing
all students who participated in
the lottery and were not able to
get housing."

The good news for the rising
juniors is that approximately 1015 singles are expected to open
between now and the beginning
of the fall semester. During this
time, some students usually decide to go abroad, live off-campus, or simply transfer. Sometimes this luck of the draw can
result in pleasant surprises for
those on the waiting list. "I was
practically the last person on the
waiting list last year," recalled
one sophomore. "And a couple of
weeks before I came back to Swat
in the fall, I found out I was getting a single!"
Last year, because of the overwhelming size of the entering
freshman class and the rising
sophomore class of 2000, some
creative tinkering was necessary
in order to provide housing for
everyone. Many of the dorm
lounges were converted into

doubles, most notably those in
Dana and Hallowell. This trend
is likely to continue, as half of the
lounges in Danawell were given
out as rooms. In the case of a
housing overflow, more lounges
will be converted into doubles for
rising sophomores on the waiting
list. "We hope to preserve one
[lounge] per floor [in Danawell],"
said Westphal, "but we may have
to cut back to one per building,
like this year."
A second option would be to
house more students in Strath Haven apartments, but this plan will
not be formally considered until
the final count is made for the
class of 2002 at the end of June
or the beginning of July. In the
meantime, there are approximately 400 doubles on campus
that have been reserved for insee HOUSING, page

Bean Bag Shut Down
On Thursday at 2 p.m., the Bean Bag shut
its doors to the Swarthmore community for
thelast time. This privately-run coffee shop
has served the community since it opened
in the train station in March of 1997. The
decision to close was made jointly by Larry
Hubbell and Joe King, proprietors of the
business, and by William S. Cumby, Jr. who
rented the space at the train station to the
Bean Bag.
Cumby, who also serves as mayor of
Swarthmore, has rented the facility from
SEPTA since 1985 when he renovated the
building, using half of it for his construc-

tion management company and subletting
the other half to renters interested in opening coffee houses. Three similar coffee
houses, most recently the Jumping Cow,
existed in the Bean Bag location and eventually decided to relocate or fold for financial reasons. Cumby plans to use the space
that the Bean Bag occupied to expand his
construction business offices. A letter
signed by Cumby, Hubbell, and King and
dated April 29 was sent to The
Swarthmorean, stating that the decision to
close the Bean Bag was an agreement
reached by the three. Hubbell and King,

College Adopts New
Health Insurance Policy

by Tushar Parlikar and Nii
Engineering at a liberal arts
school? No Way! This is what many
thought when they first heard that
Swarthmore has an engineering department. But for others, engineering at Swarthmore meant that a
chance existed for them to have
their cake and eat it too
they
could obtain a technical skill and
partake in a liberal arts education.
The "liberal arts engineering"
ideal has lived on at Swarthmore
for about 90 years. Engineering has
the reputation of being one of the
hardest majors at Swarthmore, yet
it is more popular than most of the
natural science majors here. Every
year many people drop out of this
highly challenging program for a
variety ofreasons, but still last year,
24 engineers graduated, compared
to 8 physics majors and 10 chemistry majors.
According to Professor of Engineering and Department Chair
Frederick Orthlieb, himself a mechanical engineer for 27 years, it is
popular because of the responsibility expected of professional engineers. "Engineers design and build
some of the most important things
in the world like bridges, buildings
and roads. When engineers screw
up, people die. This responsibility
makes it hard. At Swarthmore, we
try to make the prospective engineers gain a sense of responsibility. If they are not responsible, they
do not deserve to be engineers."
The path for an engineer at Swarthmore is not an easy one. In order
to graduate as an engineer, a student must have at least 12 credits
in engineering, 4 mathematics credits, 2 physics credits, 1 chemistry
credit, 1 credit in another lab science and complete all the normal
college distribution requirements.
When asked about the course requirement for engineering, Orthlieb
explained that the twenty course
requirement was instituted to sat-

"Rising from
the ashes..."

Next semester, an improved
health insurance policy will be
available to Swarthmore students.
Unlike the current policy, which
requires all students to purchase a
basic plan from the school whether
they have their own medical coverage or not, the new policy will require only those students without
health insurance to purchase the
plan.
According to Acting Dean Bob
Gross, "The College wanted to offer a plan that would provide better coverage for students without
health insurance while as the same
time avoiding the duplication of
coverage for students who already
have insurance plans."
The College currently provides a
Student Accident and Sickness
Medical Insurance Plan forall fulltime undergraduate students. The
basic insurance plan extends for an
entire academic term and costs
about $95 per student. The policy
benefits include up to $ 1,000 for the
expense of treating injuries resulting from any one covered accident,
and a total policy maximum of
$11,500 per sickness, which includes hospital room and board,
surgical expenses, physician expenses, and laboratory tests. Those
who wish to increase their benefits
can either extendthe basic plan into
the summer semester for an additional $45, or purchase the Annual
Optional Major Medical Expense
Benefit for an additional $ 177. The
Annual Optional plan not only increases the length of coverage but
the financial amount as well. The
current policy is underwritten and
offered by theLife Insurance Company of North America, which is a
CIGNA affiliate.
The new insurance policy is being underwritten and supplied by
Gerber Insurance Company and
will primarily affect students who
do not have health insurance. Because the new policy covers more
than the current one and fewer students will be purchasing it, the cost

will increase to $450 per students
for a period of approximately 12
months. According to Health Center Administrator Linda Echols,
"While the new plan is more expensive, students will be receiving
the maximum coverage which is
$50,000 per illness for an entire
year. Unlike the current plan, coverage will extend both nationally
and internationally
which will
be particularly beneficial to students who either live abroad or decide go abroad. Those who already
have health insurance are free to
purchase the school policy if they
find thattheir current medical plans
are not as convenient or as flexible
as that which the school will provide.
"As of now we anticipate about
155 students who will have to purchase the plan," Echols continued,
"but once you factor in those students who will either discontinue
their current plans or for whatever
reason pick up the school plan in
addition to their current coverage,
the numbers will increase. Students
who are both required to purchase
and receive financial aid or grant
money will have their award monies adjusted to cover most, if not
all of the cost of the new policy.
However, the Financial Aid office
has not yet specifically decided on
how they are going to do this."
Some highlights of the new health
policy include a zero dollar deductible for services specified in the
plan and $lOO deductible for services not specified. There is also
100 percent coverage for specified
services, 75 percent coverage for
non-specified services, and $6OO a
year in prescription benefits with a
co-payment of $5 for generic medicines and $lO for name brands.
While the College has been interested in changing its health insurance policy for some time now, the
official decision to implement the
new plan wasn't made until last
Friday. According to Echols, both

We Rose From The Ashes
The very first staff editorial we wrote this semester was titled "Rising
from the Ashes." So perhaps an appropriate question to ask as we bring
closure to our editorship this semester would be, have we really risen from
the ashes?
The answer, we sincerely believe, is yes.
And for the first time this semester you can open up The Phoenix week
in week out and not be taken by surprise, or rather, overwhelmed by its
grotesqueness. For the first time it actually looked like a real newspaper.
The look of the paper was thoroughly revamped, complete with a new
masthead and new templates for each section. The layout design was made
much more dynamic and readable withthe introduction of more pull quotes
and graphical elements. The fonts and style of each section was standardized. Beyond these aesthetic changes, we also saw an influx of new content. The Op-ed page was in particular revitalized —to along with a more
graphically-oriented layout
by the presence five permanent columnists
as well as several other regular freelance contributors. We also managed
to secure numerous regular reviewers and columnists for the Living and
Arts pages, whose template also underwent a complete makeover
in
almost every issue the section starts out with a main feature. We started to
take a more aggressive and investigative approach to reporting news, the
culmination of which being our multi-section coverage of the scholarship
controversy last week.
"The most major problem hindering The Phoenix," we wrote in our first
editorial, "is the lack of consistency."
"The key to permanence," we noted further down, "is method."
And that we feel, is our most important achievement of the semester.
Not only were we able to initiate all these changes, but we kept them in the
paper for the entire semester. Obviously we have made many adjustments
and improvements over the course of the semester, but if you randomly
pick out any two issues of the paper, they will look and read the same; the
quality is homogeneous. This semester we had successfully created and
implemented a system by" which could churn out quality pages week in
week out.
The quality of the paper cannot be gauged by looking at the product
itself. A newspaper is out there to be read, talked about and reflected on.
it is meant to
Especially a community newspaper like The Phoenix
serve as a forum, even part of an educational process, for meaningful discussion on meaningful issues, as a means of interaction between different
groups and interests on campus. And we feel that throughout the "Holocaust controversy" the paper fulfilled precisely that purpose.
Controversy is definitely not a reflection of quality but it does point to
as explosive and divisive as they may be
the fact that issues
that
people care about, issues that should be discussed but have been buried
under the covers are being touched upon. We never harbored any sensationalistic intentions when we published the news analysis on Bradley
Smith's pamphlet and his letter, but the ensuing debate heated and acrimonious as it may have been at times
we feel, taught us and the campus
community some important lessons, namely the importance to listen to
and respect other people's perspective, even ifthey might be diametrically
opposed to yours. As a result of the controversy, we also learned to take
our responsibilities as student journalists even more seriously; we were
forced to think about important ethical and journalistic questions that had
never confronted The Phoenix before.
We accomplished a lot, but that doesn't mean that we didn't suffer any
blunders at all. The entire semester was a tough balancing act
trying to
strike a balance between idealism and pragmatism. With a meager staff
and little outside support, at times both of us were so drained emotionally
and physically that we just wanted to put out the paper and get it over with.
Our involvement with the paper, as predicted, had already penetrated our
academic and personal lives to the extreme. We came in with many more
rosy dreams and ideas, but quite a few of these have been abandoned or
left unrealized once we got on the job, simply because we didn't have the
time nor energy to carry them out as we were preoccupied with the herculean
task of producing a respectable, consistent every week.
But we never lost faith. Which is why one of us will stick with the paper
and continue the mission. There remains a lot of work to be done. The
two of us and many of our staffmembers had to pay a heavy price to work
for the paper—it shouldn't have to be that way. Now that we have stripped
away the baggage of the past and laid a solid foundation, it is time to reconstruct the infrastructure to promote greater efficiency and accountability. Many of the production processes have indeed been streamlined, but
the key now is to develop a method of expansion such that newcomers can
be broken in without disrupting the equilibrium, and at the same time establishing a more refined division ofresponsibility and reducing every staff
member's workload, as well as creating incentives for everyone to do their
job well. And then finally a period of consolidation so that the whole
system will last permanently.
However, we cannot do it alone. One of our legacies, we hope, is that the
improved Phoenix will have rekindled your interest in campus journalism.
We also look forward to tapping the diverse talents of the incoming freshman class. We hope down the road many of you will join us in our crusade
to make The Phoenix a top-notchcollege newspaper. At the risk of sounding a bit repetitive, remember, YOU can make all the difference.
It has been one helluva roller coaster ride. Many a time we just felt like
jumping off the roof on Parrish sth, but in end we both agreed unanimously
that it was worth it.

Swat's New Minority: Student-Athletes
To the Editor:
Similar to Charles Green 'B5 in
last week's Phoenix, I wish to address the "Postings" article written
by J.T. Haskins 'OO in the March
1998 issue of the Swarthmore Builetin. I wish to reflect upon the fact
that Mr. Haskins' quitting the basketball team has received enough attention to warrant an article on the
third page of the alumni Bulletin. I
feel insulted that this article was
published by Editor-in-Chief, Jeffrey Lott. The perpetuation of the
notionthat theSwarthmore studentathlete is not a valued member of
the community is advanced by promoting the idea that academics are
the sole purpose of attending Swarthmore and athletics is not a worthy
endeavor. Swarthmore is teaching its
student-athletes that resigning from
their "passions" is necessary to
maintain academic subsistence at
this institution. Glorification of the
casualties furthers this notion.
The article published by Mr. Lott
should never have been printed,

Names such as Michelle Walsh,

what often seems to be overlooked in the discussions of athletics is the importance of the education that occurs on the playing

importance of the education that
athletes obtain during competition.

The classroom education at
Swarthmore is excellent. However,
it is incomplete. A liberal arts education is unique because it allows
us to focus on multiple fields of
study. The goal is to produce wellrounded, well-grounded individuals who can capitalize on the
breadth of learning possibilities
available at an institution like
Swarthmore. Balancing academic
pursuits with athletic dedication is
laudable and requires exceptional
commitment of which few in the
college population comprehend.
The issues surrounding Mr.
Haskins article are important for
the community to consider. What
this institution has taught him is
distressing. An excellent athlete
feels he needs to abandon his passion of competitive basketball because the academic rigor prevents
him from performing at a level
which he desires. Swarthmore demands excellence from its deans,
professors, faculty members, and
students; however, this attitude
does not extend beyond theSEPTA
tracks to the playing fields and
courts. The undervaluation ofathletics at Swarthmore is represented
by the publication of Mr. Haskins'

The History
ofBeirut

The Making

of a Swattie

With the semester winding down and
your workload finally easing off, you're
probably looking for a fun and inebriating
activity to enjoy. Well, it just so happens
that, since the late 1980's, Swarthmore has
had just such a diversion that has evolved
and spread over the last decade, and has
become a serious spectator sport both here
and at many other schools. Leagues have
formed, teams have stayed together for
four years at a time, and every venue at
which this great and honorable game is
played has its own character and feel. It's
time that Swarthmore learned the rich history and diverse playing styles of the game
that we call Beirut.
In the darkages known as the 80's, when
we were listening to the Jackson Five and
wearing jelly shoes, our predecessors here
were still just playing ping-pong while
drinking. Both DU and Phi Psi partook in
this table tennis debauchery, but exactly
when and how the paddles and nets were
dropped and the cups were lined up is a
nebulous and contentious issue. Alumni
from Phi Psi have sworn up and down that
the game began circa 1989, brought here
and introduced by a member of said fraternity who came from Lebanon. While
certainly a plausible explanation, alumni
from DU claim to have played a variant of
Beirut as early as 1987. One thing is clear:
Someone should have come up with this
game a lot earlier.
Although tables have been shoved together in every corner on campus in an
attempt to play this most noble game, there
are really only three locations where serious play can occur. Wharton CD basement
has earned a reputation for being a small
but very competitive table. Supported by
an inverted bed frame and located in a dark
and dingy mess of pillars and primordial
ooze, this table is an excellent place to
hone your skills to laser accuracy. This
table has been supplemented recently by
the addition of a ping-pong table, allowing this unassuming room to explode into
an exciting atmosphere of tournamentcaliber Beirut. The rules in CD are very
much like those of Phi Psi; landing two

Every student here has some memory of
their first introduction to this college, but
from my experience probably not of their
initial visions. These seem to adapt to fit
the circumstances, a wonderfully amorphous memory to be molded forfuture stories. Nearly two semesters into the.Swarthmore experience, I claim no greater vision, merely a slight recollection of my
progression into a Swattie. I would be exaggerating for effect to claim I arrived here
bright-eyed and excited. I was much closer
to Antonius Bloch, the disaffected ex-crusader of Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh
Seal. Still, like Bloch, I was hoping for a
little meaning and an experience more
heartening than the last, and I think like
Bloch I've learned something in the retrospective present.
Academically, Swarthmore has Swarthmjore has exceeded my expectations,
though this is something that I must remind
myself. The reason is that beyond this, I
have encountered a very disturbing phenomenon here: virulent apathy. Due to the
tremendous workload about which we simultaneously brag and moan, "student"
serves as a prefix to every position here
from athlete to columnist. Rather than
emphasizing the achievement that juggling
the two represents, the word "student" has
come to represent a subordinator that emphasizes the amateurish manner in which
activities here are regarded and many times
carried out.
Jhe first Phoenix my class read as Swarthmore students announced the resignation
of the Student Council Co-Chair and Community Resource Center Coordinator. Immediately, we adopted the Swat distrust of
government, not necessarily a bad thing,
but, a disappointing one. Through the fall

myself and fellow students referring to a
school athletic team as "they," though from
what I hear this terminology has a long history here. The quitting of significant portions of the team did not help matters in
terms of their general respect either. These
two incidents reflect the legitimate roots
of apathy, but do not explain its pervasive

don't believe that anyone who tries to effect any change should be laughed at.
The second semester, wherethe first class
of the new millennium faced grades for the
first time and saw several of its members
elected to Student Council, brought new
incidents. The only campaign that brought
much attention was the work of SURFS (a
typically acronymed group) to bring a degree of reform to food services. Still, afterwards I was shocked to find many
Swatties calling the campaign
which
arguably affected only a small change, in
the larger scheme of things
presumptuous and arrogant. A columnist in this publication described poor food as a "hair
shirt" to remind us of our humanity at this
elite institution. These self-hating elitists
would do well to actually try to effect
change rather than uselessly comment. This
pathetic sort of apathy which regards any
sort of change as dangerous and anyone
who tries to affect it is one of my biggest
problems with Swatties. Most of us, I
firmly believe, do not have this sort of view,

Rethinking the Role of The Phoenix
by Emily Shartin

The Phoenix has been the target of perennial criticism and ridicule at Swarthmore, and more often than not, I, a twoyear veteran of the staff, have found myself agreeing with the naysayers. While I
do think thepaper has made some substantial improvements in recent months, it frustrates me that The Phoenix is still not consistently as good as it could be. But even
after considering all the criticism, I for one
am unsure what exactly it would take to
make the newspaper better. The Phoenix
suffers from an identity crisis of sorts, primarily because the lack of student support
has made it difficult for the staff to determine the role that the newspaper plays in
this community and, hence, to clarify any
set of workable journalistic standards or
goals for itself.
Pretentious terms like "journalistic integrity" are often thrown around at Swarthmore, but I think when it comes right down
to it, those who work for publications on
campus would be hard-pressed to define
the code of journalistic ethics they adhere
to. This semester, for example, Phoenix
staff members decided to withhold the
name of the student caught distributing
those notorious holocaust revisionist pamphlets (who happened to be a former member of The Phoenix staff himself). A couple

acknowledgment of apathy.
One of the complaints I've heard is that

The Phoenix doesn't do enough investigative work, but I've often wondered at what
point this desire for the big story turns into
muckraking. There is a fine line between
sensationalism and real news, and it's also
ultimately a subjective one, as is abundantly clear to anyone who has been following the Clinton sex scandal. However,
certain projects that The Phoenix has begun with "investigative" intentions have
oftenresulted in nothing more than sensational speculation. Swarthmore's campus
is still largely governed by social codes that
make people reluctant to expose their peers
or tell the press anything very worthwhile.
While I don't necessarily condemn these
codes, they are still journalistic obstacles
that take a lot of time to navigate. I do think
there are some fairly shady things that go
on around this school, but ifnobody takes

ing of the newspaper so thatresources can
be more efficiently allocated and more interesting stories can be researched.
Ideally, I think The Phoenix could be an
instrument used to reflect campus activism and mobilize the community around
any number of important issues. The relationship between a newspaperand a small
community like Swarthmore College can
and should be more symbiotic
the community should be more constructive in explaining what it expects from the newspaper, and the staff, as members of the community, should start mapping out its goals
and ideals based on these expectations. If
it is decided that the newspaper should be
a forum for exposing people who've done
stupid things, so be it, but it is only through
this kind of interaction that The Phoenix
will be able to conceive ofitself as a product of the community and begin putting
the perennial ridicule to rest.

our work seriously and nobody is willing
to talk to the press, how much time and

effort should writers expend on investigation that may or may not lead to something
worthy of a front-page headline?
Put simply, The Phoenix has limited resources. More often than not we encounter irritating practical obstacles that obstruct us from embodying whatever journalistic ideals we may strive for. In my
yearlong stint as a news editor, for example, I and my co-editors have continually struggled to fill the 2 pages that are
allotted for news every week. It's difficult
to find writers who are always willing to
volunteer the time to look into possible
stories. We obviously would like to follow
up on every lead we get, but all too often
we don't have enough resources to do this.
There has been talk of compensating staff
members with academic credit or money,
which would certainly be effective ways
of encouraging people to become more
involved with the newspaper, although I
do recognize that this might place an unfair priority on The Phoenix as a student
activity.
If the task of the journalist is to "make
the interesting important and the important interesting," then the relationship between a newspaperand its audience needs
to be clarified. It is of course the audience
who determines whether or not a newspaper is interesting enough to read. But
should The Phoenix simply give its readers what they want? Does the staff have
any say in directing the community's attention toward issues that it finds important? After all, the staffis part of the community too. Writers and readers need to
cultivate some kind ofmutual understand-

balls in one cup clears that block of cups,
and the losing team must finish the winners' cups.
There have been many organized Beirut
tournaments in recent times (and many
more attempts), and this year's big and
well structured tourney is taking place over
several weeks at Phi Psi. Phi Psi has added
another (and longer) table to accommodate this event, and another table has just
been constructed in the basement. This
new table is an hourglass shape, a pure
Beirut table without ping-pong lineage.
The author considers this table to be of
superior construction and design since he
won six games in a row on it last week,
although it does hamper the use ofbounce
shots. In all, Phi Psi provides an outstanding venue for championship-caliber Beirut.
The third and final table where the serious players come is the mammoth slab in
the basement of Delta Upsilon. Constructed in 1994 in many pieces, this rugged table is the frequent location of serious, full contact play. This table very rarely
sees "gentleman's rules" (wherein loose
balls are uncontested) and has seen some
of the most incredibly fast and fierceBeirut
on campus. Players coming from shorter
tables such as CD basement will take a
game or two to adjust to the length, and
the rules do not include double-cup or finishing the opponents' beer. Also, a bouncing ball on the table must be allowed to
come to reasonable rest before being
picked up; that is, it must be given ample
opportunity to find a cup. These changes
are all relatively new, and DU Beirut resembled CD rules in its formative years.
The authorhas traveled far and wide and
seen many variations and permutations of
this most revered drinking game. For those
seeking a similar experience to Swat,
check out Drexel (where they play the
double cup rule), Fairfield, Washington &
Jefferson, Penn State, and Rowan. Variations include a single rack of 15 cups on
each side, and rule/lingo differences
abound. Some locations assess penalties
if you completely miss the table or do not
finish a sunk cup quickly enough, and
amounts of beer vary as well (3-4 per side
being typical). Other rule variations include returning the ball to your opponent
when they make a shot and allowing "celebrity shots", wherein a third person takes
a shot for your team. UNC-Charlotte even
plays with a ping pong net on their table.
For complete and utter chaos, one could
try 100 cup beer pong at Lehigh or play
"Death Pong" with hard liquor at West
Virginia.
The next article in this series (next semester, after the author has gathered more
first hand experience) will further reveal
the diversity of beer pong games and will
discuss rule-specific dynamics and tactics
of Beirut. Until then, keep your ping-pong
balls dry and your eyes on the back of the

ber one status to further some greater
goals. In short, being number one puts
Swarthmore in a unique position. We
can, for instance, encourage other
schools to expand their financial aid resources to make higher education more
accessible. Other institutions can try to
do this but only elite institutions set
trends followed by others aspiring to join
the ranks.
In the other camp, we have those students who feel that our rankings attracts
the "wrong" type of potential student. To
that I ask, just exactly what is the right
Swarthmore student? It seems as if antirankings people in this camp want to preserve this campus for people who look,
think, and act, like themselves. Prior to
the new found popularity triggered by the
rankings, people outside of the northeast,
with lower incomes, in urban areas, at
public schools, and with more colorful
skin tones, did not know about, and
hence, did not apply
to
Swarthmore.
Since then, a more
diverse (in the
broadest senses of
the word) group of
people have begun
to apply to the college. This could
only strengthen the
quality of student
life and the student
experience at this school. If recent trends
continue, Swarthmore will no longer be
a bastion ofupper class and middle class,
White America.
So what does this all mean? Before
launching a crusade against U.S. News
& World Report, people need
to consider
the merits of most of the variables used
to compute the rankings. At the same
time, people must realize that the magazine makes itclear that the rankings don't
mean that the No. 1 ranked school is best
for every student. The magazine only
purports that, when judged on certain criteria, Swarthmore College is the best liberals arts college. More importantly,
people should consider the implications
of arguing that being number one has a
attracted "un-Swarthmore like" students.
Such reasoning is as asinine as it is ridiculous and needs to stop.

Swarthmore is a
part of the elite tier
of educational
institutions for
better or for worse.

Taking the Stress out of Swat
By Nick Attanasio
I have a confession to make.
I'm not that interested in Mumia's plight
or the future of Hydroponics. I'm not too
concerned about the political policies of the
World Bank. I don't give two hoots about
the Spotted Owl, Tibetan Monks, or subverting the dominant discourse. And I don't
give a damn about how the establishment
marginalizes Indie Rock.
But I do care about this school and the
effect it has on my fellow students. My first
impression of Swarthmore students as a
freshman was that nearly all of them
seemed unhappy. Swarthmore is a school
of the stressed and the depressed. I think
theAdmissions department might get some
interesting results if they gave prospective
students a sheet of statistics covering antidepressant use on campus. Nearly everyone jokes about the stereotypical, neurotic,
overworked Swattie, but it's not that funny
when you realize
how many there actually are. All you
have to do is look
around in your
classes.
Or look in the
mirror.
When lan Chang '97 wrote his final editorial forSpike last spring, he talked about the
necessity of sacrificing academic goals for
extra-curricular ones and lamentedthe prevalent mentality that saw such an idea as the
worst kind of blasphemy. He was right. But
the problem isn't that the school is too academically focused. It's that we, as students,
have the wrong focus. We don't have "too
much work," we simply have the wrong attitude towards our work, our school, and each
other.
Swarthmore shouldn't be treated as
something to be "gotten through" in the
requisite four years with as little pain and
personal investment as possible. As a student body we have to force ourselves to
actively contribute to the school community. Being an honors double-major and
maxing out in McCabe is not a contribution; supporting a sports team or writing a
poem for Small Craft Warnings is.
Why is it that each semester the Phoenix
Editor-in-Chiefs run unopposed? Why do
visiting teams have more fans than we do?
Why do people seem to file glumly by each
other sometimes without saying hi. Ideas
like class unity and school spirit don't need
to be left in high school with hall passes
and detention.

But we are the ones who are going to have

as concerned with its students' social health
as with their academic reputation, I don't
think we would have to wait so long for a
student center, or have needed student initiated groups like S.U.C.K. or Vincent
Jones' food reform campaign to tackle such
easily-apparent issues. It's up to us as students
and in effect as customers
to
reform things.
However, I know that the reason we are

I think this problem is painfully obvious,
especially right now, and I don't think anyone can say that it's not a problem, at least
a little bit. The prevailing attitude seems to
be that this is your one chance and you'd

Think You Have It Bad on the Waiting List?
by Josh Alloy
As the housing lottery passes
into recent memory, and everyone on the waiting list bemoans
their bad luck and lack of housing, I wish to bring to mind a
separate residential life problem that stems from our current
housing policies.
Let me expostulate on the
detrimental side-effects of
housing lowly life forms (ie,
freshman) with advanced intelligence (seniors). For the first,
oh, three days of the semester,
all goes well. The senior, who
would normally hide himself in
his BxB foot cell, only daring
to venture outside of Wharton
or Parrish to hang out with "the
clique," finds himself meeting
new people (albeit, teenagers
who still miss high school).
These fresh, young faces, eager to metamorphosis into the
dreaded Swattie, dance hyperactive circles around the
wizened upperclassman, machine-gunning questions about
this professor or that class, this
party or that organization. For
the first time in years, the senior feels needed, smarter than
someone, perhaps even nostalgic for his own days of drunken
revelry and toilet-bowl worshipping in Willets which have
since been replaced by honors
seminars, theses and innate discussions with all those great
McCabe Library desksitters.

But after three days of such
tomfoolery, three long days of
staying up until all hours of the
evening, three days of avoiding
work in order to keep up with
those damned, pass-fail flunkies,
the senior begins to tire and slip
behind. The 1200 page book he
was supposed to finish lies unopened besides three empty
bottles of beer, and the "Recent
Applications" on*the computer
is filled with games instead of
word processing programs.
That's right, after just three
days, the senior learns the hard
way why desegregation of the
classes just
doesn't work.
What was he
thinking ?
How could a
freshman taking Intro to
Music, Calc 5,
and some ridiculous English
course comparing middle-eastern lesbian novels with early
Seinfeld episodes, possibly understand the hardships that befall a senior? Seniors must actually go to class (although I
must point out that the senior
often has class only 2-3 days
per week), do the reading, and
be prepared to run the seminar
in case the professor is hung
over again. All the freshman
needs to worry about is his or
her picture in the cygnet, that
upcoming fall formal and
which prom dress or tuxedo to

wear, and why they might be
lotteried out of International

Politics.
Within three days, at approximately Sunday 11:59
p.m., the senior decides to begin work for class on Monday.
It is here that the trouble begins. Let us look at a typical
mixed-class floor at that time...

From this point on, we run into
a classic conundrum: How to
reconcile the obvious differences
in necessary social living conditions between primates such as
the ape or monkey, and theirdistant cousin, man. To draw a similar parallel to Swarthmore College, how do we deal with the
disparities in what is considered
a "healthy" living environment
between freshman (lower life
forms) and seniors (gods).
The only answer to this problem is to segregate the classes.
Based on seniority.
Therefore, I recommend that
next year all Freshman live in
Mary Lyons. That's right, all of
them. Sophomores and Juniors
can have Dana and Hallowell
(plus, ifthey negotiate well, the
seniors might consider throwing
in Willets, Woolman and the
Lodges). Finally, Seniors will be
allowed to comfortably and luxuriously acclimate themselves to
their new three-room-singles in
Wharton, Mertz, Worth, and
PPR. Lucky seniors with numbers in the upper 1/3 of theclass
might even be able to secure entire floors to themselves. If this
doesn't appeal to you, just remember, you too will be a senior
one day.

prospects

With the recent release of Chinese dissident, Wang Dan, and
President Clinton's upcoming
summit with Premier Jiang
Zemin in June, Americans are
focusing their attention on the
issue of human rights violations
in China.
Cornell Visiting Professor, Li
Zehou, was in China during the
Tiananmen Square massacre. He
was a professor at the prestigious
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, and many of his
students were involved in the democracy movement. Li says that
in the beginning he supported
their movement, but when former
premier Deng Xiaoping, threatened to use military force against
the students and the hunger strike
began, Li warned the students to
cease their protests. "I told the
students about Deng's promise of
'bloody heaven' but they not believe that the government could
kill so many people," he says.
After the massacre, Li was seen
by the Chinese government as a
major threat to their leadership.
Although he was never involved
in the movement politically, he
was perceived as an influential
spiritual leader that could sway
the minds of Chinese youth. As
one of the foremost scholars of
aesthetics and intellectual history, Li's many articles were familiar to the majority of Chinese
students. One of his books could
be found in almost all the dorms
at every university. "I was their
number one target because they
felt that I shaped people's minds
through my books even though
they were not political works" he
says.
For several months, Li's life
was in danger. He was not allowed to give lectures or publish
his work, and all of his writings
were banned. Government officials began to write journal articles to refute Li's ideas and fi-

policy is still relatively recent, there
have been some reactions by students who became aware of the
change. According to Michelle Jordan 'OO "the new policy is a good
idea because it will provide students who don't have health insurance with an opportunity to receive
a great deal on extensive coverage.
It also will free many students and
their parents from the pressures of

Obviously this will not be considered a
great deal for those students, especially if their plan cost around the
same as what the school's policy
will offer." For all students interested in purchasing the new plan or
learning more about it, an official
letter along with the enrollment
forms will be sent out to all students
and parents providing the specifics
of the new policy soon.

Orienation Workshops
We are looking for facilitators for the Class
of 'O2 Diversity Orientation Workshops to
take place next fall. The program will include a Swat-written and directed play, followed by small-group discussions, as well
as a formal worshop (new and improved
from last year's) during the first few weeks
of classes. Facilitators will need to arrive
at Swarthmore on Sunday, August 30th,
during orientation. The workshops will
focus on many aspects of diversity, including race, gender, sexuality, class, religion,
and physical ability. Interested?

Why is it so Hard to be an Engin. Major at Swat?
from ENGIN, page Al

isfy the standards set by the Accreditation Board for Engineering
Technology, ABET, which regularly reviews the engineering programs in the nation's schools.
Swarthmore's engineering program
is currently ranked the ninth best
for undergraduates nationwide.
According to Robin Mamlet, the
Dean of Admissions, the Admissions Office has been working to
recruit prospective engineers to
Swarthmore. The PSAT scores of
high school students are bought and
those with suitable scores are contacted. Contact is maintained with
high schools that have supplied
good engineering students in the
past so that more students are encouraged to apply.
Students who have been interested in majoring in engineering at
Swarthmore have traditionally been
those who prefer a liberal education to a technical one. These are
students who want to combine their
interests in the technical world with
interests they have in the humanities and social sciences. The small
size of Swarthmore also promotes
interaction between faculty and students, which draws students to the
College's engineering program.
According to Mamlet, attention
is given to the quantitative abilities
ofapplicants who declare engineering as a possible major. This ensures that Swarthmore's standards

remain superior in the natural sciences and engineering. "However
we still lose a considerable number of good engineering students to
the traditional engineering
schools," she adds. "By far, we lose
more engineering specs to MIT
than any other school, and I earnestly believe that most of those
admitted who choose to go elsewhere would do much better here."
Considering the desirable features ofengineering at Swarthmore,
one wonders why there are so many
drop-outs early on in the engineering track. In the class of 2000, 45
students cited engineering as their
major on the application forms. Out
of these, 6 never even took engineering classes and are now on a
pre-med track. Professor Orthlieb
comments, "The admissions office
tries to be careful with their selection of engineers, but because of the
high competitiveness for getting
into Swarthmore to do pre-med,
there are some fake engineers that
apply saying that they are engineers, but end up doing pre-med
courses. Every year this factor leads
to a drop of about five or six in the
class. After that the drop-out rate is
not too high."
After completing the introductory
E5 programming class in the fall of
their first year, most engine majors
are subjected to the "horror" of Engineering Mechanics (E6) in the
spring of their first year. Summarizing the engineering class that he

is currently enrolled in, Josh
Lindsey 'Ol said, "E6 is the study
but
of stress, strain and failure
mostly failure."
After E6, a number of students
drop out of the engineering program, and E6 is hence perceived as
the "weeder" class. In the class of
2000, eight prospective engine
majors dropped after E5 and E6,
while only one dropped after the
next course Ell. The reasons for
dropping out vary. Those who drop
out after E6 often do so because
they discover that they really don't
want to be engine majors, or because they think that if E6 was difficult, then they will not get very
good grades in subsequent engine
classes. As KwabenaAdu 'Ol said,
"It is not that the class is very hard
but they give us so much work
three twenty-page lab reports,
three midterms, MATLAB programming, time-consuming problems to do twice a week and a final! We get so much work that we
have very little time for our other
classes."
"Engineering is graded too
tough," said one of the "drop-outs."
When asked about the GPA for engine majors, Professor Orthlieb
said "We don't try to discourage
[engineering students]. If anything
the faculty tries to encourage
[them] as much as possible. You
have to realize that engineering is
an accredited major at Swarthmore.
Just as at other engineering schools,

this has

to mean something. You have to be
one of the best to get it. We want to
make you responsible engineers
and by giving you the degree, we
are stamping you with the seal of

capability."
Apart from the difficulty of the
major, some engineers expressed
frustration at being unable to take

more classes outside their major
because of the workload it would
involve. Others who have dared to
carry on the extra workload attest
to the difficulty in combining the
engineering major with another.
Frank Mote Jr. 'OO, who is doublemajoring in engineering and economics, had this to say, "I can only
advise those who intend to major
in engineering and something else
to give it a serious thought before
doing it. It's not easy!"
For most people, the dream of

combining engineering with several other classes is unmanageable. To most engineering majors, the appeal of earning an engineering degree within a liberal
arts program eventually wanes.
Says Orthlieb, "I think the answer
to that question is very simple
how much class choice does an
engineer get at other schools? I
there is

still a lot more opportunity for exploring to be done at Swarthmore
than at other schools."

Baseball Finishes with First
Centennial Conference Win
Castellucci sends winning run home,
By Patricia Barrientos

Kristen Panfilio

It was a bittersweet sendoff for
pitcher Dave Giles '9B, who got the
win in the second game of the
weekend doubleheader against
Haverford's Black Squirrels. In a
long season that turned from bad
to worse, the win was a bright spot.
"It was very gratifying that the team
finally played together as a unit.
Ending the season on a win gives
you both something to remember
and something to take with you,"
said Giles after pitching his final
game for the Garnet. "It felt great
to get a win for Giles. He's worked
hard all year and he really deserved
the victory,"said Jay Schembs 'Ol,
who scored on a single by Carlo
Fitti 'OO in the third inning.
"It was good to beat Haverford,
especially to get a win for Giles"
added Andrew Lund '99. According to Giles, "The stars of the game
were really Steve [Farneth] and
Castellucci." Steve Farneth 'OO
sealed the victory for Giles.
Farneth came in to face one batter,
who hit a line drive right to second
baseman Lund. "It was probably

the hardest hit ball of the game.
That's how hard [Farneth] was
throwing" addedLund. It was the
hardest hit ball by Haverford, but
the big hit came off the bat of Rob
Castellucci 'Ol, who hammered a
2-run homer in the first inning. It
was a curve ball that hung up in the
strike zone. Though Castellucci
was still upset because he had
grounded out to end the first game,
on a 2-2 count, he turned on the ball
and drove it out to right field. The
offense
had
reawakened and
were finally getting to the

game. The Black Squirrel pitcher
was trying to break a school record
for most consecutive wins.
In the first game, the opposing
pitcher was on top of his game,but
so was Farneth, who went for the
Garnet. The difference was that for
five innings, the Garnet bats did not
do much against the Black Squirrel pitcher. However, in the sixth
inning, they were wearing him
down. Josh Roth '99 led off with a

single and with aggressive base
running skills came around to
score. Patience at the plate led to
three consecutive walks but the
rally fell short.
"We had a our chances with the
bases loaded in the seventh," lamentedLund. Nonetheless, the Garnet did get to the Black Squirrels in
the second game. Joe Aleffi 'OO
reached base on an error to lead off
the game. Next, Castellucci stepped
up to the plate and drilled theball to
give the Garnet
a 2-run lead.
Giles gave up a
run in the bottorn of the inning, but the Garnet regained it the
following inning. Lund scored what
turned out to be the winning run on
a single by Castellucci, whofinished
with 3 Pvßls. The Garnet went on to
win 4-2.
The win, the first of the year in
conference competition, was just
the fourth in 28 games and it
stopped a 22-game losing streak.
The day before, the Garnet lost a
tough game in extra innings. Roth
took the mound against Ursinus.

He got intotrouble early but held off
the Ursinus offense. He had limited
them to 3 runs until the eighth inning, when Ursinus tookthe leadand
erased the 6-run Garnet lead. The
Garnet had the lead after an offensive explosion in the second inning
in which they scored seven times.
They eventually fell 13-10.
Throughout the season, the Garnet have had to play with limited
players. Most importantly, they had
to play a season with only four
pitchers. In such circumstances, the
pitchers need to pitch many innings
without the luxury of relief pitching. The Garnet also did not have
that many bench players. In late
innings, pitch hitters were not really an option. Without arms and
reserve players, the Garnet was at
a big disadvantage. However, the
team has also had to struggle with
their offense and defense and the
Haverford games were a glimpse of
their potential. Although win was
one game in a long season, Giles
thought it was "something to think
about over the summertime and
something positive to build for the
next year."

3 Badminton Team Members
Named All-Americans
By Siobhan Carty
On the morning of April 25,
Chen '99, Erika
Johansen '99, and Tarn Doan '9B
leftcampus to represent Swarthmore College at the National
Collegiate Badminton Championship, sponsored by the United
States Badminton Association.
Previously, only Thanh Hoang
'9B had been invited to the Nationals where she finished second
in singles last year.
The three players qualified for
Nationals at the Northeastern Intercollegiate Tournament held
here at Swarthmore. The Nationals capped off a successful season for Swarthmore Badminton.

Jennifer

With the combination of enthusiastic freshmen and experienced
upperclassmen, the varsity team
became co-champions of the
PAIAW league with a record of
4-2. Over spring break, the Badminton team competed in the
prestigious State of Pennsylvania
Tournament, where they performed extraordinarily well.
Siobhan Carty 'Ol and Jane Ng
'Ol, finished second in the singles
B and C flights.
At the Nationals, Doan joined
team with Evelyn Tan from
UCSB (seeded player) to capture
third. The doubles team of Chen
and Johansen surprised the field
by finishing fourth, as they had
entered the tournament unseeded.

The pair described playing
against the best woman collegiate
player, Lily Chen of Stanford, as
a "humbling experience." Chen
continued, "That woman could
back-hand clear the bird from the
baseline all the way to the other
baseline with her body turned!
She deserved to win!" Stanford
captured the triple crown this
year with Lily Chen and Chris
Hales, an Olympian.
All three Swarthmore players
won Ail-American honors and
spots on the U.S. National Team
for their accomplishments. Hopefully with this year's performance, the Badminton team will
be able to attract new talents for
next season.

Men's Lacrosse Broken by
Haverford to End Season, 14-3
By Pat Donaghy
The men's lacrosse team lost to

Haverford 13-4 to finish the season
at 3-12. The Tide had troubles on

offense throughout the game and
lost to the Fords for the sixth consecutive year. Despite the loss, the
team has to be satisfied with the
improvement over last year's
winless season and is looking forward to next year.
Swarthmore fell behind early to
Haverford, who scored two goals
in the opening two minutes, as they
dominated the faceoffs. Haverford
scored two more goals before Swat
could finally net one of their own.
It was Mark Dingfield 'Ol who finally broke the scoring drought as
the first quarter ended.
After Swarthmore allowed two
more goals, the offense began to take
over. The Tide controlled the ball for
most of the last 10 minutes of the
halfand got off quality shots, but the
Haverford goalkeeper was able to
turn away shot after shot. Finally,
Adam Dickinson 'OO, in a man-up
situation, bounced a shot that hit the
upper corner for a 6-2 deficit.
Unfortunately, Haverford scored
just before the half ended, and then
found the net three more times before Swat finally scored in the
fourth quarter.
By then, it was too late, and
Haverford cruised to the victory.
Swarthmore outhit the Fords
throughout the game, but many of
those hits turned into man-up situations, which the Fords were able

addition, the failure of the offense to control the ball
and the frequent defensive breakdowns allowed Haverford to dominate the scoreboard.
Despite the score, goalie Sig

game in net, turning away many
close shots to keep the Tide in contention. Senior captains Alex

Ruggers Finish Second
in Temple Tournament
By Tony Sturm
The Swarthmore men's rugby
team finished their regular season
on a high note two weeks ago, placing second at the annual Temple
Tournament. Swarthmore blew out

the hosts in the first round,
squeaked by Lock Haven in the second round, and fell soundly to the
heavy favorite West Chester in the
championship. The loss in the final
was not discouraging for the Evil
Buzzards, who had already proven
they could compete. They were
unable to pull out a victory against
the alumni last Saturday, though,
losing 19-12 on the last play of the
game.
In the opening game, Swarthmore
rolled past Temple 32-12 on the
strength of three tries from Kelley
Hauser 'OO. Tony Sturm '99 scored
two tries in the victory and Ryan
Madder 'OO rounded out the scoring with one more. With that victory, the Buzzards proceeded to the
winners' bracket to face Lock Haven, who had squeaked by LaSalle
in their first round game.
Lock Haven and Swarthmore had
met in the fall, when the Buzzards
were short players and experience.
Lock Haven had humiliatedSwarthmore, winning by over 75 points,
an absurd margin for a rugby game.
Lock Haven had a severe size advantage, outweighing the Buzzard
scrum by over 250 pounds. This
was the best game of the tournament, as both teams traded try after try, with the question being who
would manage the last score and
win the game.
After Lock Haven scored first,
Madder took a scissors from Dan
Barrick '9B and darted in for a try.
Adam Booth 'OO kicked the conversion, making it a 7-5 Swarthmore lead. After Lock Haven
scored again, things took a bad turn
for Swarthmore, as Hauser was
struck with a migraine headache
and caught without his medication.
Hauser had to leave the game, and
Madder also was sidelined at the
half due to thumb trouble.
However, Swarthmore was not
about to give up. Substituting in

the week before the game) and
making some creative position
changes, Swarthmore still was able
to field a relatively sound team.
And the Buzzards showed they
could still compete short two starting backs. The forwards, led by
Pete Zustovich '99 and Mike Turick
'99, did an excellent job of maintaining possession, and the backs
demonstrated that they could still
run despite their new players, including forward captain Chris
"Slo" Jahnke '9B at outside center.

After the half, Sturm and Mike
Sheer '99 scored, but with the game
winding down, Lock Haven answered back and took a 20-17 lead.
With under two minutes left,
Swarthmore gained a scrum from
five meters out and had at least one
more chance to get in for the score.
Swat won the scrum cleanly, and
Barrick worked a little magic. He
ran directly at Lock Haven's inside
center, forcing him to commit or
play the pass. The" center decided
to play the pass, but Barrick faked
the toss and kept the ball himself,
cutting inside and dancing untouched into the try zone for the
game winner.Booth hit the conversion for some insurance, and one
minute later, the final whistle blew.
Swarthmore could not dwell on
that emotional victory for long,
though, as they had just over an
hour to rest until they played West
Chester in the championship game.
West Chester was big, strong, and
fast, but Swarthmore came out hard
and got on the score board first.
Sturm surprised West Chester
with a quick try off a pop kick,
sprinting into the try zone before
West Chester even knew what had
hit them. However, West Chester
dominated in the scrums and were
extremely effective on offense.
West Chester managed to score
twice before the half, but missed
their conversions and held only a

10-7 lead.
A few minutes into the second
half, Swarthmore suffered one
more disheartening injury when
Sturm was forced to leave the game
with a cut on his head requiring
stitches. Tragically, Swarthmore
had no more substitutes to replace
him, and were forced to play down
a man for the remainder of the
game. West Chester exploited the
resulting gaps in the defense, and
padded their lead with four relatively easy tries. Sheer snuck into
the try zone for one last try on the
identical play that worked against
Lock Haven, making the final score
30-12.
Against the alumni, Swarthmore battled back to tie the game
twice before surrendering a try in
the last play of the game off a
kick by Scott Lock '94 that went
over Sturm's head. Undergrad
tries were scored by Jerome
Bushnell '99, who scored off a
quick penalty, and Mader, who
got the glory after Barrick made
a tremendous 30 meter run and
dished him the ball at the tryline
while being tackled. Alumni tries
were scored by Bryce Walker '97

Softball Sweeps Haverford
by

Jean Quinn

The Garnet had a full plate last
weekend, with two important
double-headers against arch-rival
Haverford and the best team in the
Centennial Conference, Western
Maryland, to end their season.
Swat handily swept the Fords, but
could not muster the bats or crisp
defense to steal one from the Green
Terror, who clinched the conference title with the pair of victories.
With a record of 10-23 overall, 412 in the conference, the Garnet
tied the school's softball recoiu for
most wins in a season and also
posted a school record number of
conference
wins.
Dana Lehman
'9B collected
her eighth win
of the season,
leading Swat to
a decisive 8-2
win over the
Fords. From the
mound,
Lehman struck
out three, walked only one batter,
and gave up just seven hits.
Michelle Walsh '9B homered and
singled, acquiring 3 RB Is and scoring three runs. Mary Beth Alvarez
'9B cleared the bases on a double
in the first inning to give the Garnet a lead from which they never
looked back.
The second game was closer, but
the outcome was the same. Kate
Fama 'Ol earned her second win of
the season, giving up only six hits

in as many innings, and Lehman
picked up the save by retiring the
Fords 1-2-3 in the bottom of the
seventh. Walsh was two for three
with a double and a pair of RBIs.
Heather Marandola 'Ol was perfect
from the plate with 2 singles, an
RBI, and a run scored.
Coach Cheri Goetcheus commented, "Haverford played quite
aggressively in the second game,
coming up with some key defensive plays to keep themselves in the
game. Swat stranded 8 players on
base." Fama said, "The Haverford
double-header was a lot of fun. I
saw the whole team play with a lot
of heart and we just stayed in there
the whole time
in both games."
Swat did not

scored a run, and Kristen Panfilio
'Ol singled to drive a run in.
The second game was worse, as
Western Maryland continued to hit
the ball well. Walsh homered in the
bottom of the fifth in a valiant attempt to extend the game to seven
innings. She collected 4 RBIs and
scored one run. Marandola and
Deirdre Downey 'Ol each singled
and scored.
Alvarez commented, "There
wasn't a whole lot we could have
done about those games. Unlike
most of our games, they beat us
with hard hits and great defense.
Dana's pitching tricks were ineffective, and they were playing like a
championship team.."
The contributions of the graduating seniors were many. "They were
the leaders of the team for four
years who started the gradual improvement in the program," said
Goetcheus. "Walsh was responsible for 40% of our offense this

year. Lehman has pitched 503.1
innings in her career, and Alvarez
has come up big at the catcher's
position most of her career. All
have been significant contributors
offensively and defensively these
past 4 years, and especially this past
season."
"This season was a lot offun. It
won't be the same next year," said
Fama. "We're losing a lotof talent
and three great people who really
lead the team in every way. We're
a pretty young team, but we've still
got a solid field and batting order,
and hopefully we can keep the team
going strong."
Looking ahead to next year,
Coach Goetcheus said, "Pitching is
going to be a big hole to fill. The
present freshman class will provide
the bulk of experienced players
with major leadershipresponsibilities from Lurah Hess '99, Jean
Quinn '99 and returning catcher
Apryl Dunning '99."

MUSIC REVIEW/Patrick Boe

Tossing a
Tenuous but
Tasty Salad
Trampoline, the new album from The
Mavericks, is really packed. The thirteen
tracks that grace this CD cover so much
musical ground that the contrasts are
sometimes dizzying. The Florida band
remains true to their MCA Nashville label; the music here is all country-influenced, in one way or another. Country,
however, is nothing more than the base
of operations for this effort. The Mavericks have brought in a full brass and string
orchestra for this recording, and they use
it to guide the band to ports ofcall all over
the musical map.
This diverse collection of songs certainly can't be called boring. Each new
track is cut from an almost entirely different mold; the band wanted it that way.
The Mavericks
Trampoline
MCA Nashville
Said a Maverick in a taped interview, "We
decided that the only criteria for songs
were, did we enjoy playing them, did we
have fun playing them, did they make us
laugh or cry or tap our feet or whatever."
I guess they enjoy playing a lot of stuff.
Several tracks, like "Dance the Night
Away" and "I Should Know" have a latin
feel. They're brassy, energetic monsters
borrowing from salsa and mambo with
soaring vocals, twinkling guitars, and
pedal-steel accents. "I've Got This Feeling" is strongly soul-based, decked out in
full regalia with dramatic tambourines and
swirling string work. "Tell Me Why" is a
bluesy number, and "I Don't Even Know
Your Name" is pure pop. There are one
or two achy, love-soaked ballads, arousing gospel anthem, and a quirky ragtime
piece with AM radio vocals. At times, the
wide divergence in style is striking and
interesting, and at times a little annoying.
A lot of the music really seems to clash,
and the lack of dedication to one, or even
two or three genres, makes everything feel
a little insincere and engineered. There
is always something to be said for album
unity. The only element which serves to
pull these tracks together, apart from a basis in country music, is the set of circumstances underwhich they were recorded.
The Mavericks and their orchestral buddies spent only seven days together, recording the whole album live, together,
in an old church. The live recording and
the constant locationdo lend the whole
album a little more consistency.
The recording method also gives each
track a wonderfully blended sound, and
an energy which can't be created in the
studio. This is music truly created in an
ensemble setting, and the combined excitement of themusicians shines through.
In the interview, Raul Malo, the writer,
lead vocalist, and instrumentalist
extraordinaire for the group, said "It was
apretty intense recording session... but
probably the most gratifying recording
session we've ever had." It shows. The
music is energetically the way through,
and there's plenty of feeling in the quiet,
soulful parts. It's clear that all the participants were having a good time, both
during the actual recording and throughout thewhole week-long event. One of the
band members compared the scene to a
carnival. A camera crew was there, he
said, there was food, and the church was
packed with all the music and production
personnel involved. There was, he said,
"a lot of stimulation, a lot of visual, you
know, sight, sound coming together, just
like how at the midway of a carnival
you've got guys barking at you, you've
got food, you've got rides, and all of that
screaming."
The wails on this album aren't nearly
as abrasive as those you'd hear from the
peak of a rollercoaster, but they're just as
expressive. Malo's voice is a real asset to
the group; it's smooth enough for crooning and rugged enough for soulful growls.
Without his vocal versatility, the band
would be unable to pull off their patchwork quilt of pop, country, and everything
else. The band's capability with all these
styles is also something of a testament to
their wide-ranging instrumental

BIG
PUN

MAY 1,1998

He's Not a Player,
He Just Rhymes a Lot

There's a sticker on the
front of Big Punisher's new
album "Capital Punishment,"
which was released on Tuesday, claiming that he's "Hiphop's Biggest Artist." People
Altered Tapes
unfamiliar with the Big Pun
Big Pat
phenomenon may think that
Loud Records is inviting
some false-advertising suits with this claim.
After seeing Big Pun's amazing 400-pound girth and
hearing his hypnotizing rhymes, though, I predict everyone will be a true believer.
Big Punisher burst on the scene last year with a hit
hardcore single, "I'm Not a Player (I just fuck a lot),"
which got national distribution and was on the lips of
fans everywhere. The single, which also featured "Wishful Thinking" with Cypress Hill, promised a forthcoming Big Pun solo album.
Fans of Big Pun's blockbuster single, though, had to
wait around forever for Loud Records to get their act
together and release "Capital Punishment." Thankfully,
Big Pun's far-reaching and stunning new album was more
than worth the wait. In 24 tracks and 72 minutes, Big
Pun pushes the limits in all sorts of directions.
After the obligatory rap album intra, Pun launches into

an exciting solo track, "Beware," which effectively captures both his hypnotically
fast
and often very funny
rapping abilities as well as
his hardcore gangsta act. It's
an ominous song and Pun
shows lots of range. After
that, we get "Super Lyrical,"
another rap tour deforce.
The new single from "Capital Punishment" is clearly
supposed to be track 5, "Still
Not a Player," which is a more
hip-hoppy version of his earlier song, with all the profanity deleted. Other stand-out
tracks include "Carribean

Connection,"
featuring
Wyclef Jean, the title track
"Capital Punishment," and the
stunning album closer, "Parental Discretion," which also
spotlights the vocal stylings of
Busta Rhymes.
Of course, no rap album
would be complete without
dialogue interludes, and Big
Pun doesn't disappoint with
the amazing "Taster's
Choice," a 1:20 track of Big
Pun sexual activity, which
showcases Big Pun's amazing
speaking voice. He's so enormous and has to breathe so
often that his voice is completely unique, and interrupted with hoarse breathing noises
at every turn.
An interesting aside to most rap albums is the story of
the rapper himself. In the promotional materials for "Capital Punishment," Big Pun's personal life story gets a very
public airing. For instance, we discover that Big Pun,
who used to be called Big Moon Dog, hovered around 200
pounds until he started a family when he was seventeen.
Faced with the problems of urban life in America, Big Pun
chose a life of crack dealing, and did so well that he "ate
until he couldn't tie his shoelaces." The promotional materials also claim that Big Pun read encyclopedias to in-

crease his vocabulary. Most of the stuff he raps
about, though, is kind of tough to find in encyclopedias.
But Big Pun's life story is largely irrelevant to his
album. Like the Notorious 8.1.G.'s "Life After
Death," "Capital Punishment" adds up to an album
that will please both hard-core fans of the genre as
well as people looking for a complete auditory experience like no other. Albums like this one often
get a bad rap from people who don't understand
them, but after almost 2 solid decades of rap music,
the music's appeal is undeniable and universal.

wouldn't let me watch it. I remember sneaking down early in the morning and watching it anyway. From his first appearance in the movie, I
was mezmerized by the incredible performance of my
hero Mickey Rourke.
It's frustrating that Mickey's
career hasn't quite taken off in
recent years, and I thinkthe critical dumping that Mickey has
taken hasbeen completely unfair.
So, I've decided to put together
this video primer on the best of
Mickey Rourke.
The Year Of The Dragon
(1985) One of Mickey Rourke's
first starring vehicles, this godawful Michael Cimino 1985 disaster is a classic wherever bad
movies
are discussed. Rourke
j
stars as Captain Stanley White,
who is dispatched to New York's Chinatown to clean up
gang violence. Of course, he gets involved with some
Chinese chick (Ariane), who gives
bar none
the
worst performance I've ever seen in any major motion
picture. Mickey screws her (of course), takes out a bunch
of Chinese punks, and has a final showdown with a Chinese mob king, played by John Lone. The true mark of
quality for any motion picture is
a disclaimer (also seen in the
Friedkin classic Cruising) stating
that the film depicts only a small
part of a minority community,
and doesn't intend to represent
the whole. Of course, the filmmakers then feel it necessary to
trash the entire minority.
Rourke gives a classic Hard-ass
performance in this flick, especially as he comments on Chinese
mobsters in an early scene, "I
don't want to see their fucking
faces unless they're bringin' me
spare ribs in a restaurant." It's a cool line, and Rourke
gives a classic, greasy performance.
91/2Weeks (1986). Probably, 9 1/2 Weeks is the quintessential Mickey Rourke flick. In it, he plays a greasy
yuppie who plays kinky sex games with Kim Basinger.
It was a star-making film for everyone involved, includ-

ing director Adrian Lyne, who
proved after Flashdance that he
could make pop entertainment like
no one else. Actually, 91/2 Weeks is
such a complex, interesting, important piece of cinema thatwords can't
describe Lyne's well-developed imagery. Nothing could better describe
the current state of Rourke's career
than this film's 1997 sequel, Another

Demand the original.
Angel Heart (1987). Angel
Heart is my favorite Mickey
Rourke flick. I have seen it about
10 times, and its mysteries still
haunt me. Alan Parker, who is
one of the most daring modern
filmmakers, helmed this brilliant

supernatural thriller set in
New Orleans. Michey
Rourke plays Harry Angel, a private detective
hired by Louis Cypher (a
demonic Robert DeNiro)
to find a missing singer,
Johnny Favorite. As with
all truly great Mickey
Rourke movies, this one
features his ass quite
prominently in a classic
fuck scene that got Lisa
Bonet kicked off The
Cosby Show. You gotta love it.
Homeboy (1988). Mickey plays a retarded boxer,
Johnny Walker, in this brilliant, touching, hard-hitting drama directed by cinematographer Michael
Seresin. Classic Rourke moments include him spitting at
people, and looking totally
greasy at every moment. I
loved pretty much every moment of this movie, and I
think it's a completely overlooked classic. It also features Christopher Walken as
a wannabe mobster.
Wild Orchid (1990).
Mickey Rourke screws
around onscreen with his offscreen wife Carre Otis in this
big-budget soft-core porn
flick from Zalman King. I
recommend it only for the
balls-out fuck scene late in the movie, during which
Mickey's ass is clearly visible. It earned the film an
NC-17 rating, which got scaled down to an R after
a tiny bit of re-editing.
Bullet (1995). Thankfully, director Julien Temple
was smart enough to cast Mickey in the leading role
in this story of Jewish boxer Butch "Bullet" Stein,
who gets involved with gangster Tupac Shakur in
this bloated, hard-hitting tale of urban decay. It's
truly one of Mickey's greatest, greasiest performances.

Partus'
AdviceCorner
Dear Pardus,
I am a freshman in a rather messy situation. At the beginning of this semester, I
had a huge crush on this sophomore guy
but because I was shy, I never let him know
how I felt. It was easy enough to keep my
feelings from him because at that time we
had very different lifestyles, and while I
loved to study in the my room he did his
work in the libraries, so I rarely saw him.
About a month ago a classmate of mine
whom I was really friendly with told me
he (the classmate) had fallen for me. Now
I honestly did not love this guy but I liked
him enough and I was lonely so I agreed to
hang out with him. What he didn't tell me
was that he was on the rebound after being
dumpedby his girlfriend and he'd hurriedly
asked to me to fill in the gap. Unfortunately
for him, he ended up really falling for me
and now he tries to spend most of his time
in my company.
I recently had to do some research for a
paper I was writing and started using the
libraries more; then all hell broke lose. First
I had to seek help from the sophomore on
a research topic since it was his field and
he was nearby. He went out of his way to
help me and the next time I came to the
library he sat with me and we ended up
talking. The more visits I paid to the library
the more I like him because he always was
so entertaining. When my research was
done I continued to go to the libraries, much
to the chagrin ofmy current boyfriend. Not
long ago my new friend (the guy I had the
crush on) confessed he had fallen for me
but the problem is he already has a girlfriend. I decided it was not fair to anybody
if the two of us dated because so many
people would be hurt so I have been avoiding him. Do you think I am doing the right
thing?
Dear Freshman,
I must agree the situation is very messy
indeed, but unlike most people I tend not
to agree with the saying that "All is fair in
love and war". I think ifyou goabout things
systematically enough you should get your
hearts desire. Before you give the guy you
really like a favorable answer, you'll probably need a couple of days to buy time and
do some house cleaning. As difficult as it
may seem to do, you must tell your current guy abouthow you have deceived him
into thinking you love him, the fact that
you appreciate him as a friend not withstanding (You have really been unfair to
him!). You must plead for his forgivingness and try your best not to lose him as a
friend. Then you can tell your sophomore
about your feelings for him. But you must
make him understand that you would only
consider going out with him if he went
through the same house cleaning you did.
He must tell his girlfriend that he has fallen
for someone else. If he agrees to do that,
by all means go ahead and have fun with
him with your conscience clear. If he is still
hung up on his girlfriend, you are better
off without both guys because with each
of them you would be living a lie. Good
luck.

Rife with Personal Bests
By Gordon Roble and

Josh

Last week in competition at the
illustrious Penn Relays, both the
Men's 4x 100 and 4x400 performed
seasons bests. Representing Swarthmore in the 4xloo was Keith
Gilmore, Francis Yeo, Amilcar
Priestly and Giovi Grasso-Knight.
The 4x400 team consisted of lead
off leg, Mason Tootell, Jacob
Jurado, Gordon Roble and two
event man Gilmore running a life
time fastest 400 split of 50.5 seconds. Also competing for Swat
was Steve Dawson in the high
jump. He made three attempts at
6 ft 6 in his contention for the win.
The Swarthmore men have descended upon the track with a vengeance this season. Thrower

George Bealfeld is hoping to conquer the 40 foot mark at conferences as his outdoor best is currently 39' 11.75". Bealfeld also
leads the squad in the discus with
his throw of 127'9". However, he
is pursued by Dan Fanaras who
threw a personal best at Widener
of 118'5". Fanaras also throws
37'2.25" in the shot put. For his
first year of college track, Matt
Asano is throwing strongly. His
best in the discus is 92'4", and in
the shot put he has thrown
35'5.75". In the javelin the team
is led by Mason Tootell, our resident decathlete, with his throw of
153'2".
Freshman Chris Sajdera entered
the indoor season without any experience as a thrower. While his
skills have developed the most, he

also competes in the discus and
javelin. Sajdera has the potential to
be a force in the Centennial conference in the coming years.
Dawson has made his mark on
the conference with his high, long,
and triple jumping ability. He has
leaped over a 6'9.25" high bar,
long jumped 21 '0", and triple
jumped 42' 10.75". At indoor conferences he won both the high and
long jumps, and at outdoor conferences he is hoping to snag the triple
crown. In the long jump,Priestley
has jumped 20'6.5", and Tootell
has gone 20'4.25". Freshman Tony
Hillery and Yeo have gone 18'8"
and 17' 11", respectively.

A men's team thrower prepares to send the shot flying in a meet last season.

The women's track team has confidence in their ability to win the
outdoor Conference Championship
meet at Haverford next week after
an undefeated season. Even in the
face of Division I and II competition such as Villanova and La Salle,
and one of the highest ranked Division 111 track teams in the country, Lincoln University, the Swarthmore Women's Track team has
made a powerful showing.
The women's track team is currently one of the most successful
athletic teams on campus. In the
triple jump both Catherine Laine
'9B and Desiree Peterkin 'OO have
qualified for the national championships in Minnesota with jumps
of 37'6.25" and 37'6.5", respectively. Peterkin, who placed second at the national indoor championships, is also a two time All

The 4X400 meter relay ofStephanie Herring, Desiree Peterkin, Danielle Duffy, and
Catherine Laine, was also extremely successful at Penn Relays. They broke the
school record and won the Mid-Atlantic
Conference title for the third year in a row.
Stephanie Herring opened the relay, and
despite getting boxed in at the start still ran
a season best. The second leg, Desiree
Peterkin, went out in a blaze and fought it
out against 15 other teams. Danielle Duffy,
who has been plagued with recent injuries,
showed that when the sent of blood is
strong in the air nothing can hold herback.

her to bring the baton neck-and-neck

The pressure pushed CatherineLaine to run

a battle between Swarthmore and the other
teams in the conference. What will put this

There is also has a unique cohesive force.

Gordon Roble, '99, wrecked the 800 m
at the Hopkin's dual meet, with a time of
1:59.01, his personal best. He also debuted
in the 1500 m last weekend at Widener
with a 4:11. Another junior 800 meter runner followed Alissa Parmelee from Ware
pool to Skallerup track: Fred Gerson. After representing Swarthmore at swimming
nationals, he brought his talents to the
track. Last week he
ran a 2:01.08 in the
800 m run, coming
off only a few
weeks of practice.
Junior
Gene
Yoshida has found
his calling in the
400 m, running a
56.46 last week, a
best.
personal
Lorrin Nelson, a sophomore, running under a alias of "Corrin" last weekend, ran a
season's best of 2:04.71 in the 800 m.
Lorrin has provided great inspiration to the
team, regaling us with tales of Haverford's
fearful envy ofSwarthmore. For two Swat
runners, the 800 m transformed (more than
meets the eye) into a battle ofNevin Katz,
'99, (representing the Transformers) and
Ambrose Dierenger, 'Ol, (representing the
Decepticons, fireworks and all). The forces

Mason Tootell was
the only man willing
to brave the dangers
of the 110 meter
high hurdles.

Jeff Lockman,
who has been one
of the few captains
not to visit the
emergency room this year, was quoted as
saying "Man, this team gives its all!" He
also has had a strong season. His season's
best in the 5000 m is a 19:40. Graham
Lucks has lived up to his potential this season. With flare and a most original style,
he has excelled at every event he has decide.d to tackle. Last week, in the 5000 m
run,' he ran a near-personal best, with a
lime of 15:35. He has run a time of 4:01,
*hich both leads the team as well places

Penn Relays, where Swat ran a time of
50.16 seconds. This was the fastest Division in time at the meet, and the team has
high hopes of qualifying for the national

of good (Nevin- 2:05.17) eked out victory
(Ambrose-2:05.73) as both ran among
their top times ever. Sophomore Jeff
Doyon's season has been very progressive.
His times have dropped in the 5000 m,
claiming him a best of 16:10. At the Widener meet, he ran a personal best time of
4:19. Freshmen Mark Nierman also ran a
personal best last week, bagging a 4:15 in
the 1500 m.
Nierman has also churned out a 2:03 in
the 800 m as well as provcJ his versatility
by running 16:27 in the 5000 m. Sophomore Josh Bloom has had a good season
as well. In the 5000 m, he scored a personal
best with a time of 16:28. His time for the
1500, 4:20, was also a PR. Bloom is currently the most eligible bachelor on the team.
Swarthmore has become a powerhouse in
the 5000m, with its final component being
freshman Mark Jeuland. Mark has flourished
under the guidance of assistant Coach William Gray, a fellow 5000 runner, previously
of Gettysburg fame. Mark had brought his
time down to a 15:44, allowing for the potential to score in the conference meet. Mark
has also run a 4:08 in the 1500 m, prompting a Johns Hopkins runner to state, "Every
time we come here [to Swat] you guys pull
another fantastic runner out of'somewhere'."
Overall, the men's team has great expectations to do very well in the Conference meet
both individually and as a team.
