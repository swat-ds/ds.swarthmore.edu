1943 first African American student matriculates

With the recent election of the first
black president, many Americans are
reflecting on the past and the events
that have brought the country to this
major milestone in history. This

history. This article is the first of a
four part series; while this series is in
no way comprehensive, we do hope to
bring attention to some of the major
turning points in the history of the
college. Accompanying this article is
a 1942 Phoenix editorial endorsing
an end to the barring of African
American students.
The first reported African
American student who was admitted to and attended Swarthmore
College was Dorothea Kopchynski
Black '47. According to the records,
she enrolled in the college in the
summer of 1943. Due to the United
State's decision to enter World War
11, Swarthmore operated on an
accelerated schedule by which students could attend school yearround, thus giving male students a
chance to finish school before they
were drafted into the army. When
the war ended, the schedule
returned to normal.
There are theories that there
were black students at Swarthmore
before Black, or at least ones who
enrolled simultaneously, according
to Swarthmore's website. John

Swarthmore during the time, ran a

Americans in colleges, including
Swarthmore, instead of internment

Swarthmore as part of the US
Navy's V-5 and V-12 programs. Even
then, "there is some suggestion that
there was at least one black student
early in the 20th century, but we
were never able to pin that one
down," Chris Densmore, curator of
the Friends Historical Library, said.
"The records may not specify race."
By the early 1900s at least, a black
male, who was by all standards
a competitive and qualified student,
applied to Swarthmore and was
accepted. Because applications at
the time did not include a question

Worth reevaluates expenses

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu

Worth Health Center is undergoing a
review of its expenses and the programs
it offers due to increasing health costs
and tough economic times. While Worth
has not made any significant cuts, according to Director of Health Services Beth
Kotarski, the center is using this review
as a chance to reexamine the program's
priorities.
"I really do think that it is a campuswide opportunity to look at what we have
been doing just because we have always
been doing it," Kotarski said. "Sometimes
something like a budget check makes you
think about whether we are doing things
the best way we can, not just economically but also system-wise
does it give the
most help to the most people?"

Jake Mrozewski for The Phoenix

On this past Tuesday evening, Career Serivces hosts the "Juniors and Java"
event to help juniors map out their goals for the future.

So far, Worth has increased the hours
of the school's nurse practitioner, Suzie
Long-Blum, so that she is available on
campus five days a week. This change
allows Long-Blum to be available for
more walk-in appointments and will
allow Worth to provide more advanced
services for extended hours to meet students' needs. "One of the beauties of my
job is that it is adaptable to the needs of
Health Services and students," LongBlum said. "We are trying to be flexible
and provide the best services for students
we can."
The biggest service that is under
review and that might be changed, however, is the school's policy of providing
free prescription drugs to students. "As
long as we can remember, Swarthmore
has been able to have a small dispensary
of certain meds, not a full pharmacy, that
we could give for free to students,"
Kotarski said. "But a lot of medications
have gone up astronomically in price, and
it's just not reasonable to be able to give
out free medicines anymore."
According to Kotarski, the medications affected by this change would be
limited to prescription drugs, especially
those that are most expensive, while
antibiotics and over-the-counter medications will remain free.
Drugs that Worth would charge for
would mostly "be medications you can
buy with prescription drug cards which,
now that we have a delivery service for,
is not a hardship for students," Kotarski
said. "And they can still buy them from
Worth: they just would have to pay a modest fee for them."
Swarthmore's Health Services is one
of the most comprehensive set of programs of its type, according to Kotarski,
who worked at the health center at
Haverford for twelve years before coming
to Swarthmore.
At Haverford, outpatient services are
free but "there are fees for all diagnostic
tests, allergy injections, medications, supplies, inpatient care, bed boards and failure to keep appointments without adequate notification," according to the
school's health
services
website.
Students, therefore, are responsible for
filing claims to their insurance companies. Mono and Quick Strep tests cost
Haverford students $l5 each, whereas
both are provided free of charge at
Swarthmore.

Even at schools with more comprehensive health services like Williams
College, which provides medications for
free if they are available, students must
pay for long-term medications and for
any lab services, which are contracted
out to a nearby hospital, according to the

February 5, 2009

school's health center website.
One prominent Swarthmore health
policy that will not be changing is the
price and availability of birth control.
The prices of these also show the stark
differences between Swarthmore and
other schools in what is provided to students.
At Haverford, birth control pills cost
$2O per pack according to its website, but
at Swarthmore the same medication is

for

$ll
Additionally, Worth has worked with the
Student Health Advisory Committee to
provide free condoms for dorms and stu-'
dent organizations that request them,
according to Kotarski. At Haverford, on
the other hand, students must pay $1 per
three male condoms and $1 each for
female condoms or dental dams, according to its website.
SHAC has been involved in other
health services decisions since its inception last year to serve as a collection of
student leaders that provides Worth with
students' perspective on health care services, according to Kotarski. The committee is meeting again this week to plan the
second annual Student Health Fair,
according to SHAC member Ayanna
Johnson 'O9.
"We will be doing a lot of planning and
making an agenda for this year's fair,"
Johnson said. "We will definitely start
advocating for mental health programs,
like a stress reduction workshop, as well
as maybe a program that helps link students to other services in the area where
they can volunteer."
Along with plans for the fair, Johnson
hopes to discuss a stronger presence for a
program against sexual violence, modeled after a program at Haverford. She is
also interested in the possibility of bringing a second nurse practitioner to campus
to help ease the workload of the college's
doctor. Most of these, however, are longterm goals that may take more than this
year to complete, according to Johnson.
Most of the short-term changes that
will be seen in Worth have to do with prescription medications and the possibility
of adopting a co-pay system like several
other schools in the area have done. In a
co-pay system, a student with medical
insurance pays a flat fee to cover some of
the costs of medical service.
This system will hopefully defray some
of the costs to the college. "The savings
are significant," Kotarski said. "We could
save enough to squirrel away some
money over the next couple of years and
use it to start up more wellness initiatives and more preventative health services, which is something colleges are
moving towards." These programs could
include classes on stress reduction as
well as programs to explore the mindbody connection and alternative medicines.
Kotarski and the Worth staff will have
a chance to discuss these programs with
fellow colleagues in college health services as well as show off the Swarthmore
campus when they host this year's annual South Eastern Pennsylvania College
Health Association meeting. According to
Kotarski, this conference will allow the
school to network, learn from a variety of
talks on pressing issues in college health
and provide a chance to bring together
program leaders from the area. "It's an
opportunity to look at our programs and
compare them to peer institutions,"
Kotarski said. "And really make sure that
we are at least offering the best of what
everyone else is offering."

be able to step back and let them
be autonomous."
According to Brainard, the
goal of self-sufficiency helps set
the garden apart from many
other Swarthmore student projects in the area. "Most projects
taken on in Chester have a really short life span
when those
students graduate, the projects
go away as well," he said.
"[Environmental Justice] can be
the impetus for this to start, but
from the very beginning the
project will be powered by the
people who actually live there."
However, giving Chester the
reins to the project doesn't necessarily mean Swarthmore students won't be working with or
through the garden in the
months and years to come.

Mayoral candidate values interaction with college
The Phoenix's Jeff Davidson
recently
interviewed local
lawyer Richard Lowe, who is
running for mayor in the borough of Swarthmore in the
upcoming elections. He graduated from Yale in 1978. He later
graduated from New York
University law school in 1982. He
has lived in the borough of
Swarthmore since 1992 and is a
construction lawyer with Duane
Morris in Philadelphia. He
works to negotiate contracts and

come to resolutions on different
issues between companies. On
Tuesday evening he came to
campus to speak about his current campaign for the mayoral
position. A full transcript of the
interview can found on the
Phoenix website.

JeffDavidson: First off, can

you tell me about your campaign? What does your timeline

look like right now?
Richard Lowe: Sure. I'm
running for mayor and the
Democratic primary is May 19th
and the general election is in
November. So of course my first
focus is on the primary and so
that's one reason I'm coming to
the college tonight. One thing
I'm trying to do is spread the
word using Facebook and e-mail
in an effort to keep the paper
load down. So I've been, for the
time being, focusing most of my
energies on that. I did make an
announcement that I was running when I was at a party on
[Barack Obama's] inauguration
day with a lot of Swarthmore

Democrats and that was very
well received. I think people
were pleasantly surprised, so
that was very nice. I've been
talking with some folks in town,
and I'm hoping to meet with a
lot of people in the next coming
months.
JD: What are your biggest
goals for the town?
RL: The mayor has certain
defined responsibilities, so I
think starting there is the best
place. First, in a borough like
Swarthmore, the police chief
reports to the mayor, so that
would be a focus. We're fortunate to have an excellent police
chief and a very solid police
force, so that generally works
pretty well. Next year, towards
the end of the 2010, there's going
to be a negotiation of the police
contract. While I don't necessarily expect to be leading that
effort on behalf of the borough,
I'll certainly be paying attention
to it. I've been a lawyer since
1982 and do construction law
where I've had tons of experience in negotiation and dealing
with contracts. So there may be
a place for me to be able to help
there. So that's one.
Second I think a place where
the mayor can really focus is on
the
relationship
with
Swarthmore College. We've been
fortunate to have an excellent
relationship with the college for
many years, and I would like to
continue the regular meetings

6

that both Bill Cumby and Eck
Gerner have had with the college on public safety and other
issues. I will look forward to
doing that. I think the fact that
the college will have a new president will give us an excellent
opportunity to try to enhance
that relationship. I've heard a
lot of people in town agree with
the observation that while the
college and the town are very
good neighbors to one another,
they tend not to interact except
in some limited ways. I think it
would be great to find ways to
enhance relationships and
develop synergy between the
two. I think there are a lot of students at the college who would
look forward to that, and I think
there are a lot of people in town
who would enjoy having more
interaction. My hope is that if
more people focused on it from
both sides, there might even be
some synergy that would lead to
a more vibrant business district
for the borough. I know we have
a relatively small town, and relatively small college, but a pipe
dream I have is to see some
small businesses that interact
with the college thrive in the
borough. It's certainly not the
case now, but perhaps if there
are people smarter than I am
who are focused on it, that can
happen. And I just think the
mayor can help stimulate that
type of enthusiasm and focus.
JD: In what ways would you
like to see the interaction with the
businesses? Are you suggesting
something like having student
cards work at the local businesses, or what ideas do you have to
stimulate that interaction?
RL: That's a possibility. Look
at
the
of
University
Pennsylvania
instance,
for
which is much bigger. There are
private businesses there that
work hand in glove with the
research that goes on in that
university. It's conceivable,
although not easy, to put into
realit [here]. Some kind of public-private partnership in ways
we haven't thought of is something we should strive for. What
I think the genesis ofit would be
is a different mindset that we
would all have to think about
and try out in an effort to see
how we can help and learn from
each other as opposed to each of
us more or less staying on our
own.
JD: We don't know what the
economy will look like next year,
but we doknow things will be different. Let's first talk about how
you would shape your campaign
and goals for the town in an economy that is either the same or
worse than it is right now.
RL: We're really in uncharted
waters because of the strong economic tide rising here. So I
think that the borough is going
to have to do the same thing that
some of the others are doing,
which is continue to be cautious
on what it spends money on. The
borough has always, since I've
been involved with it since 1998,

been cautious in its expenditures. So I don't think any new
approach is necessary. We just
have to assume there's going to
be less money and plan accordingly
just cut back where we
have to. I have not heard any
specifics about where we have to
cut back, but we would have to
cut back on some things. It's fair
to assume that the tax rolls
could suffer, so we need to be
planning for that.
Having
JD:
lived
in
Swarthmore since 1992, you certainly have seen how the community involvement by students and
citizens has changed over time.
Has that change been positive
and how would you like to see it
grow in the future?
RL: I'm not sure I've seen a
change; I think what I've seen is
a pretty good interaction on a
few fronts. First I know that the
college students have provided a
lot of volunteers for the fire company, both as fire fighters and
EMTs in the ambulance. Thirty
to 40 of the roughly 80 volunteers on the fire company right
now are college students... it's
been a great boom for the borough. One of the biggest issues
the fire company faces is the
dwindling number of people
who are able to volunteer. Over
the last 20 years, the minimum
hours for training to become a
fire fighter or EMT have basically quadrupled. And now the
minimum hours to be a firefighter is about 176 hours. So for
some college students to be able
to go under that level of training
-

and then be ready to answer a
fire call any moment of the day
or night is amazing. That has
been great to see, and I only
hope it stays the same way. I
think it's a great way for the
kids to be involved in the community.

JD: Speaking of incorporating students, do you have plans to
incorporate Swarthmore students into your campaign?
RL: I'd love to have the support of students. One thing I've
been trying to do with some success so far, and I expect to have
more, is to have people take a
look at the Facebook page to
help spread the word to their

friends. If someone has a page as
a politician on Facebook, you
can sign up on their page to
become what's called a supporter. I am asking people to do that
so it can be very easy to keep in
touch with them. Also, on my
Facebook page, my e-mail is listed and if people aren't on
Facebook and just want to keep
in touch through e-mail, I'm asking that people contact me that
way, so you don't have to pass
out as much paper; it's easier
and quicker and keeps more
people in the loop. There are
hundreds ofregistered voters at
the college, so it's a very important part of the community and
I'm taking it very seriously. It's
the first campaign stop, if you
want to call it that, that I'm making.

I have a few friends who are
students who I know who have
grown up in Swarthmore, but

that's only a couple and I'm very
much looking forward to meeting the College Democrats,
which appear to be very well
organized and I understand
have pretty regular meetings. I
think it's great to see, and I
think if we have more interaction we might be able to together
develop better ways to communicate. Nowadays, with the
economy the way it is, one
upside of it, although there's
plenty of downsides of it, is that
people seem to be more focused
on trying to interact more with
the community in an effort to be
better prepared once they leave
school. I think we could perhaps
take advantage of that heightened interest and see what we
can accomplish.
JD: Do you have any last comments on how you want to change
or influence the interaction with
the college?
RL: I'm looking forward to
when the new [Swarthmore
College] president takes over,
and I think it's a great opportunity... We've had years and
years of a great relationship and
I'm sure it's going to stay that
way. I walk my dogs at the college in the good weather a number of times a week. It's one of
the prettiest places I've ever
been, and I feel great being able
to do it. I think we've got a great
thing going here. My slogan is
"let's make a good thing even
better." I think for Swarthmore,
it's appropriate. We do have a
really good thing going, and yet
we can make it better.

Spirituality Week magnifies voice of all religions
BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Although religiosity on college campuses in general has long fallen out of
fashion, this week, for the third year in
a row, Religion and Spirituality Week is
raising awareness of diverse expressions of spirituality, while providing
students with venues for dialogue.
Religious Adviser and Interfaith
Coordinator Joyce Tompkins and two
interfaith interns, Jane Abell 'll and
Dina Emam 'll, organized the schedule
for the week and are serving as facilitators for a number of events designed to
raise awareness and open up dialogue
about different expressions of spirituality.

The week began on Sunday with a
religious foods display in Sharpies that
featured such dishes as challah, hot
cross buns, latkes and a traditionally
South Asian dessert.
On Monday night, Abell and Emam
facilitated a "speak out" session for students to share their religious experiences.
Inspired by the Quaker tradition,
students were not allowed to respond to
one another's stories during the event
and were encouraged to leave silences
between remarks in order to allow for
reflection.
These guidelines created a safe environment in which students could voice
their thoughts without degenerating
into argument.
During the hour-long session, 20 students drifted in and out of the circle,

some just there to listen and others
there to express themselves. "Often discussions get really heated really quickly, especially on issues that are sort of
hot button. It's really hard to air your
own opinion sometimes," Abell said,
explaining the impetus for using such a
forum.

and informative manner.
Out of this
meeting
and
another in early January, Abell and
Emam developed a schedule of events
that would each be led by a different
student or group. "What I hoped to provide students with this week was a
voice," Abell said.
For that purpose, the coordinators
set up a series of poster boards in Shane
Lounge as a forum for students to
express their thoughts, personal experiences, dilemmas and general ideas
about religion. Many students have
already commented. One student wrote,
"I told my friend I believed in God, and
he asked me if I was joking." Another

"Our hope is that [this week] is not
something that's just about traditional
organized religion, but also any kind of
spiritual life that anybody engages in,
and most people do, even if they don't
necessarily use that language to talk
about it," Tompkins said.
It is notoriously tricky to be outwardly religious
at Swarthmore
College, and it was from this very issue
that Religion and Spirituality Week
first took form. According to Tompkins,
several years ago, while discussing the

difficulties of being religious at
Swarthmore, one student jokingly said,
"It's harder to come out as a religious
student than a gay student at
Swarthmore."

From

Tompkins created a week to provide
students with the opportunity to learn
about other religions and explore their
own spirituality.
"There's this idea that religion doesn't belong here or that it's an oppressive anti-intellectual force. I think what
I'd like to point out is that religion and
spirituality are much bigger than the
traditional groups that many people
think of. Every person has a spiritual
life, has something besides just a brain
and a body. That's really what we're
trying to attend to," Tompkins said.
Tompkins and the interfaith interns
hope that Religion and Spirituality
Week will have a lasting effect in the

community.
In particular, they hope to see oncampus religious dialogue expand
beyond the confines of the structured
events of seven days. "One thing I
would like to see is some of those events
that we weren't able to do this week dispersed throughout the semester so that
we have a presence on campus," Emam

said.
The final events of the week include
an interfaith text study on Thursday
afternoon, a multi-faith panel on
Thursday evening, a learner's Shabbat
hosted by Ruach on Friday and a
screening of the film "Barracka" on

Heo and Hanis to appear at Clinton Initiative
BY ARIEL MARTINO
amartinl@swarthmore.edu

Yongjun Heo 'O9 and Mark
Hanis 'O5 are scheduled to
speak at the upcoming Clinton
Global Initiative University
Meeting from Feb. 13-15 in
Austin, Texas.
Hanis will offer a crash
course in starting an organization, while Heo will serve as a
panelist for a presentation entitled "From Global to Local:
How the Environment Impacts
Health."
The meeting is the second
annual colloquium of students,
college and university presidents, NGOs, celebrity activists
and national youth organizations.
Former
President
Bill
Clinton will host the event with
the aim of encouraging college
students and administrators to
commit to addressing global
issues in a productive, inspired
and innovative manner.
While at Swarthmore, Hanis
became increasingly interested
in genocide intervention, an
interest that was provoked by
his four grandparents who
were Holocaust survivors and
reading works by Samantha
Power.
"I was also empowered by
Swarthmore's faculty, administration and President Bloom's
'ethical intelligence,'" Hanis
said in an e-mail.

THE PHOENIX

As a result, Hanis and several other committed students
started Swat STAND, an antigenocide organization that is
still active on campus. After
graduation, Hanis and three
other Swarthmore students
moved to Washington D.C. and
Genocide
began
the
Intervention Network (GINET).

"We've grown GI-NET from
the four Swatties who moved
to DC to a seventeen-person
full-time staff with a $1.9 million budget and are now working to expand our work from
Sudan to other areas of mass
atrocities, including Iraq,
Congo, Burma, Sri Lanka and
Somalia," Hanis said.
Hanis hopes to use his experience in building an organization from a small student
effort to an internationallyknown NGO to inform his
upcoming presentation.

"This session will be geared
towards an audience whose
commitments are more developed and ready to be scaled up
to the next level.
These discussions will
address long-term strategy,
donor relations, liabilities,
fundraising, staffing and other
factors relevant to building
and sustaining a long-term
commitment or organization,"
Hanis said.
He does, however, offer the
caveat that it is always better

to build on and improve an
existing

organization than
create an entirely new organi-

zation.
Heo began his organization
after receiving funding during
his sophomore year from the
Swarthmore Foundation to
work in a health clinic in
Venezuela.
The result was Pemon
organization
Health,
an
geared at providing sustainable healthcare in Uriman,
Venezuela.
The organization specifically addresses the deficiency in
healthcare professionals in
the area, limitation of medical
supplies, misunderstandings

of basic healthcare and lack of
modern medical supplies.
These factors, compounded
with endemic malaria, parasites and malnutrition, have
led the area into what Heo
calls a "health crisis."
Elisa Lopez 'll joined Heo
and nine other students this
past summer in Venezuela.
The group worked on a waste
management project and distributed mosquito nets and
clothing.
"While some of the students
held community health workshops in the school, others
assisted the doctor with medical emergencies," Lopez said.
"As a native Spanish speaker,

I naturally became a main
interpreter and soon started
collecting data and information about the village by interviewing villagers, which fits
perfectly into my sociology
and anthropology interests."
Lopez
and
co-Vice
President Erin Scanlon 'lO
plan to continue the organization after Heo's graduation.
"Interest and dedication in
the group is high, so I am
hopeful about the coming
years. Attending the conference should be very beneficial, since we will have the
opportunity to create partnerships with other students,"
Lopez said.

Rogue e-mail servers elicit prompt ITS repair
BY DANTE FUOCO

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

In an effort to ensure that e-mail
providers and internet service providers
won't refuse mail sent from the network,
the college has been working this past
week to block spam from infected student
computers acting as mail-servers.
Though mail would be blocked on some
computers, ITS director Gayle Barton said
in an e-mail sent to the entire campus that
regular student e-mail shouldn't be affected since the college would only block
spam from computers acting as mail
servers, which is not typical. A mail-server serves as the buffer for mail at the college
mail coming to and coming from
the network must first go through it
before it can be delivered or sent.

The e-mail said that "several dozen student computers" have been involved in
some sort of spamming in the past month.
And the fear throughout the school is that
if there is too much spam coming from college computers, corporations, ISPs and
external e-mail providers such as Gmail,
AOL and Yahoo, will "blacklist," or refuse,
mail from the Swarthmore network.
"More than half of all spam volume
worldwide originates from hacked or
infected PCs," the e-mail said. "Our efforts
to reduce spam originating from the
Swarthmore network won't significantly
impact worldwide volumes but they will

eliminate unnecessary network traffic for
our users and reduce the risk of being
blacklisted."
So far the college's efforts to stop
spam have been successful.
Information Security Analyst Nick
Hannon said on Monday morning there
weren't any infected computers.
Tuesday morning there was only one
machine on the list, which Hannon
later said was most likely due to a
minor configuration error that has
been fixed.
"What we blocked isn't expected to
be a 100 percent effective solution, but
should reduce what we're seeing," he
said in an e-mail. "The results so far are
consistent with our expectations."
Hannon said that the college has
tried to be more proactive about spam
prevention since this past summer,
when major ISPs and external mail carriers blacklisted the swarthmore.edu
site after spammers hacked college email accounts.
"The campus kind of had a scare
over the summer," Hannon said. "It
kind ofraised our attention."
Until the school explains to e-mail
providers that the accounts sending
spam are rogue accounts, it is impossible to send and receive e-mail, which is
why it was fortunate that students
weren't here when it happened over the
summer, Hannon said.

"So many people depend on their email," he said. "We're trying to avoid
that situation from happening again."
Hannon added that this is "really frustrating" not only because the schoolhas to
work with external mail carriers to get
the college removed from their blacklists,
but also because companies and corporations have their own blacklists which the
college may not even be aware of.
A computer running as a mail-server
sends excessive amounts of spam, often
equal to the volume of mail the campus
sends in a day, Hannon said. Systems
Administrator Jason Rotunno said that
spammers aim to run mail-servers on personal computers because they can both
access mail and avoid detection from the
main mail-server. Even though Rotunno
monitors the college's mail-server to
ensure "mail queues aren't creeping up in
volume," he wouldn't be able to detect
spamming from a personal computer
because it would have its own server, separate from the college's. "We don't see our
queue increasing in size," Rotunno said.
"It's a way to try to avoid [the system]."
Hannon said that the college discovered this most recent problem when it was
looking at Swarthmore addresses. "We
were seeing machines popping up [as
mail-servers]," he said, which then led to
the college blocking them from acting as
mail-servers and, as a result, sending

Despite the e-mail, Hannon said that
there didn't seem to be any confusion or
concern from the student body.
"The main thing I wanted to be understood was that it wasn't going to impact
them," Hannon said.
Something that has recently impacted
students, however, is connection to the
network. "We have been receiving more
calls than normal regarding computers in
the remediation zone this past week, and a
good portion of the ones that I have seen
in office are missing a piece of the Virus
Scan software," Restech Coordinator Seth
Frisbie-Fulton said in an e-mail. He also
noted that some computers may be in
remediation by error.
Frisbie-Fulton explained that a computer is "automatically moved into remediation if it doesn't have part of the
required software." He said, however, that
while students go through a certain registration process to connect their computers to their network, ITS may also use this
"registration system to disable the
Internet access of students when we think
their computer may be infected or hacked
usually when we detect an unusual
amount of spam mail or hacker queries to
our servers from their computer."
If students are having trouble with
wireless or wired connections, FrisbieFulton said that he'd urge them to take
them to the Restech help desk in
Beardsley.

Arts

List Gallery exhibit weaves the story of a life
BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

On display now in the. List Gallery is the work of
"Baltimore artist Michael Olszewski, whose recent fabric constructions and watercolor paintings use subdued blacks and grays to articulate feelings of loss,
solitude and struggle. Acknowledging influences
ranging from the Russian Constructivists and Nazca
Indians to Mark Rothko, Olszewski's art is a patchwork of methods (Olszewski takes advance of embroidery, crochet, dying and applique, to name a few) and
treated fabrics (silk, horsehair, cotton, leather,
metal). "Olszewski is someone who combines craft,
strong concept and a powerful emotional impulse so
that his resulting works blend all his experience and
personal concerns in a unique way," List Gallery
Director Andrew Packard said.
Shaped by the artist's experiences growing up
queer in a homophobic community where self-expres*
sion was often difficult, Olszewski's art is deeply personal and self-reflective. In that regard, an understanding of Olszewki's personal background is helpful
in coming to a greater appreciation of his work. "It's
great to hear artists talk about their works because a
lot of times they're dense works, and so it allows you
to see into the mind of the maker," Alex Weintraub 'll
said after Olszewki's lecture on Jan. 22.
Through his art, Olszewski explores his own emotional landscape and, in doing so, invites us to explore
our own. "[Olszewski's pieces are] very interesting as
documents of trying to work out your own emotions
in a way that might not be readily apparent upon first
looking at them," Sean Nesselrode 'O9 said. Achieving
a kind of transcendencefrom its material, his current
exhibition evokes a strong visceral response and emo-

tional reaction. ""Each piece is like a prayer in terms
of the tenderness and fidelity with which he's assembled it," Packard said. •
Two standout pieces amongst the collection are
"Innermost" (2004) and "Exile" (2008). Both of these
works exhibit Olszewski's trademark use of everyday
fabrics and craft methods.
"Innermost" is a silk piece, stitched with a screenprinted set of blurred words to resemble an old piece
of paper with faded text. In this piece, Olszewski uses
something familiar, paper and ink, on familiar material, silk, to confront the viewer with the impermanence of everyday objects, such as the printed word,
and strikes one with a bittersweet feeling of nostalgia.
For me, the work recalled the original documents of
the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence
how those documents may eventually be lost to history, but their ideas may live on.
"Exile" works similarly. Made of paper, silk, cotton, metal and acrylic paint that is crocheted, stitched
and appliqued, the work somehow fittingly creates a
sense of exile. This piece is remarkable in the way
that, again, Olszewski has taken everyday objects and
created something that is completely unlike those
objects. Nothing looks like cotton, silk or paper that
we see in everyday life.
But his devotion to his craft and skill allowed him
to create a piece that represents to the way that life
can wear you down and transform you into something
jumbled and disoriented. The spirals in the center
and the misguided line that seems like an off-center
divider is affecting in its confusion. A little black
piece that is separated from the rest of the jumbles of
material especially jumped out to me. It struck me as
an expression of isolation from a painful and nonsensical world.

Michael Olszewski, "Exile," textile, 2008.
For Packard, Olszewski's work and his attention to
subtle detail is an expression of the way that "we can
become sensitized to nuances that are usually missed
in the cacophony of daily life." Ultimately, his art is
moving, intimate and sentimental.
Michael Olszewski's "Recent Work" is on display

'Scandal' allows Sherlock Holmes to sing
BY MAKI SOMOSOT
msomosol@swarthmore.edu

"A grit in the eye, a crack in the
heart," sing the iconic detective
Sherlock Holmes and Miss
Adler,
the woman who famously beats Holmes
in a battle of wits, as they lay bare their
unresolved feelings to each other
onstage. With music written by associate professor of music and composer
Thomas Whitman 'B2 and a libretto by
professor of English literature and poet
Nathalie Anderson, "A Scandal in
Bohemia" transforms Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle's short detective story into a
musical opera that will be performed
Sunday, Feb. 8 in Lang Concert Hall at
7:30 p.m.

The operatic format provides a
unique interpretation of Conan Doyle's
classic short story in a hybrid performance that should be appealing to both

literature and music lovers alike.
"The passion portrayed in opera and
the intense mysteries in Sherlock
Holmes' stories complement each other
rather nicely," Swarthmore chorus
member Holly Kinnamont 'l2 said. "I
can totally picture Sherlock Holmes
belting it out in a rich baritone."
"Scandal" promises something more
than your average play with a musical
twist. The opera follows the plot of the
short story in which the King of
Bohemia (played by Julian Rodescu)
hires the services of Sherlock Holmes
(played by Markus Beam) to retrieve
certain documents that may compromise his upcoming marriage. These
documents, coincidentally, are in the
possession of an opera singer named

THE PHOENIX

Irene Adler (played by Laura Heimes),
with whom the King previously had an
affair.
While the investigation and detective work unfolds, Holmes realizes that
the King's version of the story clashes
with Holmes's personal observations
that Adler is more than what she seems
on the surface. While Whitman and
Anderson's opera stays faithful to the
original plot conformation, "Scandal"
also brings to light the more humanist
elements of Conan Doyle's tale.
"It's a love story," Whitman said of
his interpretation and personal vision.
"The music makes it possible for
someone like Sherlock Holmes to fall in
love. It's probably why it even exists in
the first place."
Because of the nature of the opera, a
much greater emphasis will be placed
on musical accompaniment and its contributions to the "emotional architecture" and "dramatic pitch" of the story.
"There are also fewer words needed
because the music is supplying the
emotions subliminally," Anderson
added. "So the original language of
Conan Doyle has to be pared back."
Ideally, the job of the music as both
emotional filler and catalyst for
Sherlock Holmes to find love would be
the defining characteristic of this
opera.
"This is what makes opera different
from other mediums," Whitman said.
"The music dictates what happens next
on the stage," Anderson added.
The continuity supplied by the
music means that the emotions contained within each scenario last for a
longer-stretch of time. Whitman, a for-

mer musical theatre aficionado who chorus, all comprised of Swarthmore

Konak
Within this cavernous Mediterranean
restaurant, one eats food fit for a king. At
first, it is easy to feel slightly overwhelmed
by the high ceilings adorned with fake windows, the ornate balcony looming overhead
and the paintings decorating the walls.
However, Konak, which means mansion in
Turkish, very quickly begins to feel like
home.

First, the ambiance. On a Friday night,

La Famiglia Ristorante

On Monday, six companions and I made
the timeto venture out of Swarthmore's bubble to try out what is widely recognized as
Philly's best in Italian cuisine. The restaurant is located near Perm's Landing on a sort
of empty block in a quiet area of East Philly.
The restaurant has an intimate and elegantly traditionalfeel with dimmed lighting,
dark wood trims and a mural on the back
wall. It wasn't rated Philadelphia's Most
Romantic Restaurant for nothing. The waiters are polite and unobtrusive, attending to
any need in such an efficient, quiet manner
that pausing to let them serve our food felt
like a brief lull in our dinner conversation.
The restaurant serves traditional Italian
fare, referred to on its website as 'an old
world inspired menu." Highlights included
the gnocchi, tender and chewy in perfect
marinara; the polenta, complex and flavorful; the veal, juicy and delectably moist; and
the rich and creamy risotto. Oh, and of
course, dessert, which to me is the highlight
of any meal. It was a sampling of three exquisite pastries: a chocolate profiterole, ethereal
cream surrounded by a flaky shell; a toothsome fruit tart; and a vanilla Italian cheesecake, spongy and soft cake with cream on
top.

enough for a sense of fun and quiet enough
for conversation. The menu caters to vegetarians as well as carnivores. For a college
student unfamiliar with Turkish cuisine,
ordering food is a daunting prospect.
Fortunately, the servers were incredibly

courteous, patiently pronouncing the names
of the dishes and describing them to us.
Finally, the food. The lamb was not as tender as I had hoped, but was grilled well.
Friends who ordered the eggplant could do
nothing but rave
the menu claimed it was
"highly recommended," and it lived up to
these lofty expectations. Another favorite

The night eventually came to a close, and

for us. The overall experience was surprisingly fun for a more formal outing. If you
crave simple, classic Mediterranean food,
Konak is the place to go.

Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of La
Famiglia was the catacomb beneath. La
Famiglia has one of the largest and most dec-

orated wine cellars in the country, and the
huge binder of a wine list presented at the
beginning of dinner was intimidating to say
the least.
La Famiglia was a great culinary experience and I highly recommend it to anyone
willing to brush up on table etiquette and
take a blow to the wallet for the sake of great
food and wine.

Tangerine
One night I was sitting at Sharpies, feeling unsatisfied after yet another disappointing dinner. The next night, amidst other
chatty Restaurant Week diners, I finished the

last bit of my Moroccan chicken and leaned
back, absolutely and completely content.

An upscale Mediterranean restaurant in
Old City, Tangerine offers high quality, intricately flavored dishes as well as a hip and

high-class atmosphere.
The candles covering one of the walls
winked in the darkness, and the deep red
curtain on the opposite wall rippled as waiters glided by, dressed in black. My mom
would have complained that it was so dark
she couldn't see what she was eating, but the
dim lighting gave our table a private and
secluded feel, even though we shared the
room with about fifty other people.
For Restaurant Week, Tangerine offered a
three course meal including appetizers of a
hummus plate with feta cheese and olives, or
a salad with goat cheese and vinaigrette;
entrees of delicately seasoned swordfish, or
Moroccan chicken so tender it was falling
apart; and intricately arranged desserts like
caramel cake or, our favorite, the mint cream
puff atop soft chocolate mousse, accompanied by a warm chocolate "soup."
Eating a rich dinner was satisfying, but
half of the fun of going to Tangerine was
dressing up
the dress code is "casual to
dressy," according to their website.
Tangerine is also about a nine-block walk
from the Market East station. As our reser-

vation was late on a weeknight, we caught a
taxi back to Swarthmore. With a $35 meal
plus tip, train fare and a taxi for five, the tab
for the night worked out to about $57 a head.
Being able to swap a quiet campus for the
bustle of the city and a decent dining hallfor
a classy cultural restaurant made me appreciate Swarthmore's location. As one of my
friends said, it "makes you think about how
nice we have it
the best of all possible
worlds, without Voltaire's sarcasm."

Food appreciation comes to nourish the bubble
BY

ISAAC

H|a

ihanl@swarmmij&.edu

Food is essentiaX food is a delight, but
food can also become bland and monoto-

nous, as is unavoidably' 1 tie case at
Sharpies. Perhaps the food is not as bad at
Sharpies as everyone says, but it can get
rather tiresome to eat the same thing from
month to month.
This past week, two events looked to
brealNhe tedium that is dining at Swat.
Katherine Gao 'l2 has started up a new

club called Gourmet and Gourmands that
will hopefully rejuvenate our food appreciation even after years of eating pasta bar
twice a week. Meanwhile, Career Services
held a lecture titled "Dapper Dining" that
just may help infuse classiness into our
meals.

Gourmet and Gourmands
With Gourmet and Gourmands, Gao
aims to share the experience of food from
all different cultures. Having grown up in
a family that often threw dinner parties to
explore different national cuisines, Gao
hopes to bring that same love of food frfM
around the world here to Swat. wnafi

Gao has many events already in mind
for her club. She said, "One of the goals is

to go out to many restaurants, not just
your basic Italian food but maybe

will be the perfect education. Aside from

"power hand" was a particularly helpful
tip of his. Let me elaborate.
Imagine you are at a banquet.
Banquets usually have a section where
you just stand around and eat hors d'oeuvres, mini-quiches or something, and
drink a beverage, lemonade let's say. So to
maximize your networking power, you
need to figure out how to effectively eat,
drink and network at the same time. This
is where the "power hand" comes in. What
you do is hold a napkin between the pinky
and the ring finger, a plate between the
middle and fore fingers, and a cup
between your thumb and forefinger of
your left hand. With this, you essentially

pare dishes. One of the potluck highlights
was a delectable fried catfish dish. Gao

Gourmet and Gourmands is an opportunity to break the monotony of Sharpies
and to experience fine dining at its finest.
A true gourmand, Gao wishes to see you at
future Gourmet and Gourmands meetings. Meetings are held every Tuesday at 9
p.m. in Kohlberg 334.

remember to use that napkin, It all comes
back to good etiquette.
Shutt went on to give other priceless
pointers, like following the leader, which
translates to the one you're trying to

make sure that you are not underperforming or showing your boss up in etiquette.
Harry Apostoleris 'l2 said, "It's good stuff

opportunities for each musician
to show off their solo skills. That
piece was followed by a smooth
and swingin' performance of

Nelson's
"Stolen

tight group playing combined
with excellent solos. The combo's
mellow renditions of smooth jazz
standards was the groovy calm
before the improv storm that was
Trio(Blue).
By the time the main group
took the stage, Bond was so
crowded that people had to move
out of the aisles in order for the
musicians to pass. The relocation
was worth it; Hooker, along with

Hennen and Moshe, dove right
into a 45 minute improv set that
left the audience slightly stunned,

yet still hungering for more. The
music varied immensely, from
moments of quiet in which only
Moshe or Hennen played to
cacophonous and chaotic sections that threatened to shatter
the windows. The only constant
was the group's immensely skillful playing and the passion that

they put into the music. There
were several moments that were
delightful in their unexpectedness, such as Hennen stepping
away from the synthesizer and
showing everyone what spectacular jazz piano sounds like, or
Moshe putting down his saxophone and playing a tiny Turkish

flute that resembled a penny
whistle and gave the music an
almost Irish sensibility.
The Trio(Blue) performance
ended in near total darkness.
When the lights came on, the
audience was left to process what
they had just heard. Jeff Santner
'O9 couldn't even describe it, saying, "Ask Greg [Albright 10],"
who was standing right behind
him. "That was an experience,"
Albright said. "Nothing like that
has ever happened before, and it
was phenomenal." Everyone in
the room seemed to agree, from
the most knowledgeable music
majors to those who had only
come to support their friends. It
was clear from the crowd that
packed Bond Hall to capacity that
Hooker was right: the music
lives, the art lives.

case houses an array of Gehry's
highly abstract"fish models"
ed, zoomorphic forms resembling a fish that helped give the
Lewis House design its loose yet
coherent movement. Such displays contain information ofparticular interest to architects and
architecture students, since they
detail specifically and technically how Gehry crafted his models.
They note how he modeled his
signature billowing, undulating

forms encased in sheet metal. In
the models, as in his actual
buildings, Gehry would wrap
existing sheets of metal around a
skeletal frame.
Other zoomorphic forms discussed in the displays include
those of a stegosaurus and a
horse's head. Amazingly, in each
February 5, 2009

of the three final designs presented, Gehry managed to merge
these unrelated and compartmentalized forms into a coherent, continuous composition.
The aforementioned rectangular layout of the gallery truly
proves conducive to understanding Gehry's style and process as
a whole. The technical details of
Gehry's construction and the
evolution of his unique forms sit
in the center of the space, and as
one peruses the perimeter's displays, one can easily see these
processes and ideas manifested
in Gehry's legendary structures,
both pre- and post- Lewis House.
One aspect of Gehry's work
notably missing from the exhibit
was any discussion of his buildings' interiors. Perhaps this

exclusion

was

deliberate,

though; Gehry and the poststructuralist style he is said to

represent fall under much criticism for not heeding the adage
that "form follows function,"
arguably modern architecture's
manifesto since the period began
around the turn of the twentieth
century. Gehry's architecture,
detractors argue, places too
much emphasis on the exterior
shell, sacrificing the building's
actual "function" and context for
"form" and aesthetics.
The exhibit's narrow focus on
Gehry's Lewis House is deceptive; upon leaving, viewers
should truly feel better sense of
how to contextualize, examine,
and understand this great contemporary architect.

Again, it's the "ugly" vs.

people still wear them? My
guess is yes, but I don't
think they would be as

Obviously I am not saying that the only worthy

To me, there is something
aggressively

and adventurous abou
"ugly" fashion. It's less

but can still be feminine
and streamlined. I wouldn't say it's exactly my cup

that this is the "modern"
direction necessary for
fashion, but that's the

B*constantly

set

apart the
upper ech-

elons of cultural production. Nothing
in the present day and age combines
the intellect of the high brow with the
good old irreverence of popular culture
like irony.
Which is why I want to talk a bit
about misogyny. Nothing in today's pop
culture climate is consumed "ironically" more than hip-hop and R&B, specifically misogynistic, musically inept
hip-hop. But is it really all that hard to
understand? I mean, it's fun to listen to,
for both men and women of all races, of
all sexualities, religions, etc. With
music piracy on the up, it's not as if
upstanding, progressive young people
(the usual demographic that listen to
such songs "ironically") have to worry

about spending money that will later be
used by these same artists as they make
even more god-awful misogynistic
albums about "freakin' honeys up in da
club" and "pimpin' on dem streets."
Now, I will freely admit to loving R.
Kelly and getting down to the Ying
Yang Twins every once in a while. And,
surprisingly enough, it is not as if I've
been spending the last five years of my
"ironic hip-hop phase" in a constant
state of conflict and guilt. In fact, I'm
quite unapologetic about my impetus to
have a little fun once in a while and listen to music that is not so serious. And
isn't it precisely because these albums
are so problematic that I love them so
much? I mean, isn't it fun, innocently
parsing each and every song, actually
searching for the ways in which they're
problematic, and then patting myself

problematic relationships with women,

demean the female sex without reservation and in general hold inaccurate,
self-effacing views about the present
state of gender politics?
Matters simply become complicated
by the racialization of hip-hop and hiphop culture, specifically by white feminists who would like us to believe that
black people are the source of all sexism and that the elimination of rap
will save us all.
Now seemingly, this is a trivial battle to even consider fighting. It's not as
if altering the way in which one listens
to hip-hop is going to save the world.
But, when we live in a world in which
even cultural production favors men,
it is important to think about resistance even on the most minute levels.
It might even be the case that there is
subversive potential in the ironic cooptation of misogynistic popular
music. .
One thing is for sure: cultural production, especially popular music and
film and media, banks its existence on
knowing what the people want. Which
is why for the past century we've seen
a lot of Eurocentric chick flicks,
movies about crazy British people runnin' around acting a fool during World
War I, music by women who can't sing,
and rap tracks that were made using
software programs named after cereal
brands [l]. Within industries that
depend so heavily on audience input
lays a great revolutionary potential,
for it is our input that in the end
makes the trends. It's time that we
think about pop culture in ways that
go beyond "what we enjoy." Not so
much that we should police ourselves
or become puritanical in our habits,
but to understand that even something
as innocuous as an R. Kelly single cannot escape the maladies of our society.
I believe that this understanding can
lead to the birth of a new "personal

Dubious encounters: dating in and out of the Swubble

utterly
bic afternoon
tantalizing. Alas, tragedy
(or sanity) struck, and paralysis left me unable to do anything but stare at my computer. Agonizing over these
ads, I thought about how much I resented the dating
dynamics at Swarthmore until I started to see each and
every dancing pixel that made up the screen. Damn you,
pixels from hell! How you mock me! And so long, lost
love, "m4w 50 (Springfield)," make-out laureate, man
amongst boys. Sadly, I am either too damn senseless or
too damn sane to come and get you.
Okay relationship veterans, I know what you're
thinking. You've been led to believe that the Craigslist
dating scene is more dubious than that of our
Swarthmore campus. Erroneous! Foolish assumptions!
For I have probed the depths of DU basement, fought the
'dactyls and propositioned naked Rugby men with single
dollar-dollar bills.
So why, you might ask, is Craigslist any safer than
our cozy little bubble? Well, at least you know what
you're getting into. Granted you might not know WHO
you're getting into, but at least people's intentions are
transparent. The point of my column this week is to illuminate the dynamics of the Swarthmore dating scene.
For instance, why does it (did it) suck so bad for some of
us at certain times? First of all, people barely leave campus, so the dating scene is more like a "hook-up culture."
The opportunity to hit it off with a crush comes about
once per week if you don't make it to Pub Nite, because
campus becomes a wasteland on Friday nights as you all
scuttle to Cornell like squirrels to finish your problem
sets, and then rendezvous with your cronies for a badass
Pirated TV party until the wee hours of the night (Rock
on!). Most Swatties feel decadent allowing themselves
one night of the weekend to "party."
You see, I know you better than you know yourself.
You're a product of a very delicate social habitat. In my
effort to make the Swarthmore hook-up culture more like
Craigslist (by increasing the transparency of the
Swattie's intentions), I will elucidate the following
Sexual Swattie Stereotypes. If you do not fit into one of
these three categories as closely as a puzzle piece, you
are clearly lying to yourself, your family and your peers.
There are no other alternatives, so please come to terms
with this now. Denial is a common but futile reaction.
You are either (1) Completely disinterested in (or
unmotivated to pursue) sex and/or relationships for any
slew of reasons. You may have just ended an unhealthy
relationship or are working on your mental stability.
Conversely, you may have convinced yourself you're just
"too busy" for romantic pursuits. While the first two
cases are dubious, the legitimacy of Scenario Three is
clear. You probably have two labs, plus you sing in
Sixteen Feet, and with that schedule, you'd be doing a
disservice to any girlfriend, spreading yourself so thin
and all. On second thought, maybe it's none of those
three. Maybe you just haven't yet gotten your foot in the
love door. You have your platonic friendships and that
satisfies you; Swarthmore runs the rest of your life, plus
you're a bit too naive to care about what you're missing.
After all, you don't really know what you are missing, or
to what extent you are missing what you're missing.
OMG WHAT AM I MISSING???
Okay, so this is not you. I know you. Your name is Joe
Bloggs. You are the type of guy that is decently good-looking. Congratulations! You're not a gremlin! But because
the number of beautiful people in the Bubble is so low,
and the number of awkward-looking people is so high,
the reasonably attractive are left with no one to compete
with. By virtue of the deceptively low attractive-to-awkward ratio (aprox. 1:15 by my count), Bloggs is fooled into
-

,

thinking he is some kind of (2) Paces Adonis. Now with
an ego inflated like a hot air balloon, Joe only wants to
hit it and quit it, like he was T-Pain. If only Joe would do
an exchange program at Williams, perhaps he would
come back having realized that the 1:15 ratio is only an
illusion, and he might start to prepare for reality.
"No, Ambah," you insist. "I'm a respekful guy, I
swayah!" Unfortunately, I've fallen for that one before,
but let's assume you really are respectful and you're a
living, breathing person that I might consider dating at
Swarthmore College. Could it be? Is it (s)he? Oh wait! Of
course! If you're not mentally/emotionally unavailable

you
and you're not insanely awkward then you're
guessed it, (3) Taken!
And so, after fleshing out the dynamic of the Swattie
Sexual Stereotype
the couple, the Paces Adonis, the
asexual, the emotionally unavailable and all that is
Swawkward in between I don't feel quite as pathetic as
I did starting out this column. I maintain, however, that
whenever you are violently ill from a Swarthmore relationship, Craigslist is as good as chicken soup.
Amber is a junior. She does not in any way advise or
condone trysts via Craigslist. Seriously. She can be

Card check neutrality update
To the Editor:
Swarthmore Labor Action Project (SLAP) would like to
update the campus community about the status of the campaign for card check neutrality at the proposed Swarthmore
Inn. This week we met with President Bloom and came to a
mutual understanding that the College can make a timely
decision, regardless of its economic situation or the status of
hotel project. We communicated to President Bloom that our
concern stems from the reality that the hotel's operator—not
the College—will have ultimate control over jobs at the hotel
and as such could not be held accountable to the campus community. Consequently, it is imperative that the College sign
an agreement guaranteeing workplace democracy in
advance.
Broad campus-wide support for the hotel campaign and
growing national consensus in favor of the Employee Free
Choice Act clearly indicate that the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) process is seriously flawed and that card check
neutrality is the appropriate alternative. We hope that
President Bloom and the Board of Managers will act accordingly

In our meeting, President Bloom agreed that his senior
staff will discuss the issue in the coming week and will meet
with a union representative to look over the language ofcard
check agreements. We look forward to hearing back from the
administration as to the results of those conversations and to
a timely decision that reflects the College's stance on workplace democracy. It would be a shame if the College fell
behind other comparable institutions in its long-standing
commitment to social responsibility.

Staff Editorial

What's coming next?
After Obama's victory in November, a number of articles
were published speculating about what the sex, religion, race
and sexual orientation ofAmerica's next president would be.
2008, it turns out, was the ideal year to pose that question.
With the election of a black president in November, everything seemed suddenly possible. In light of a historic and
unprecedented election, we are forced to turn to the next
question: Who will our next president, four or eight years
down the road, be? Will he be a Mormon? Will he even be a
he? Are we ready to elect a queer president? Only the most
cynical and regressive would suggest that race, gender, religion or sexual orientation are ever going to be absent from
electoral politics from here on out.
Americans, however, aren't the only ones who began 2009
with a landmark inauguration. Iceland swore in Johanna
Sigurdardottir on Sunday as not only the country's first
female prime minister, butalso the world's first openly queer
head of government. It is difficult to make a perfect comparison between Iceland's situation and our own; Iceland's population is less than a one-hundredth of ours, and because of
their parliamentary system, Sigurdardottir was never popularly elected. But that doesn't mean we can't ask, in a return
to our initial speculation, "What's coming next for America?"
One of the best places to begin to unravel this puzzle is,
interestingly, with the Republican Party. Since the 19605, the
Republican Party has catered to an almost exclusively white
base and has incorporated relatively few politicians from
minority backgrounds. Less than three months after the
election of Barack Obama, however, the party that brought
us Strom Thurmond and Sarah Palin has suddenly realized
that it, too, may need greater minority representation if it is
ever going to reclaim a dominant position in American politics.
Michael Steele, the newly elected black chair of the RNC,
has openly acknowledged that the Republican Party must
appeal to a wider base if it is to survive. In an interview with
The Root, a news blog associated with Slate Magazine, Steele
said that the Republican Party had a "fundamental image
problem" and that he believes that the Republicans' failure to
appeal to the black community is a large part of the problem.
"We are going to show up in the black community. We're
going to spend time in the black community and we're going
to spend money in the black community," Steele said. While
Steele's moderate conservatism and eagerness to court
minorities may not necessarily represent the sentiment of
the Republican Party at large, it bears noting that Steele was
elected by a body of GOP insiders, and that his closest rival
lost support after it came out that he used to belong to an allwhite country club.
And black leaders are hardly the only minority leaders
being celebrated in GOP circles these days. Bobby Jindal, the
Governor of Louisiana of Indian descent, has emerged as a
favorite among party leaders to challenge Obama in 2012.
What this means is that even in the most conservative
quarters of the nation, views on race are changing. The
Republicans vying for the 2008 presidential nomination during the primaries were all white. It is unlikely that, come
2012, this will happen again.
What this doesn't mean, however, is that things as they
presently stand are anywhere close to acceptable. There is
nowhere nearly enough minority representation in politics,
and the current lack of diversity of the Senate is nothing
short of depressing. Of the 100 members of the Senate body,
one is black, two are Asian, and three are Hispanic. There are
only 17 women, and there are zero queer politicians. Of the
100 Senators, 77 are white, male and, at least according to
their websites, straight.
So, as significant as the election of Barack Obama was, the
overall diversity of the federal government has changed little. What did change were the nation's perceptions of race in
politics. If Bobby Jindal doesrun for president in 2012, no one
can suggest that we should view his poll numbers with skepticism.
America is at a crossroads. The election of Barack Obama,
and the sheer amount of minorities who voted, have made it
abundantly clear that minority politicians can win elections
and that politicians without minority support will not. We
can't hazard a guess as to when we'll see our first queer or
female or Indian president. But 2008 was an excitingly
diverse year in presidential politics, and we would be very
surprised if2012 and 2016 are not.

work.
Or how about this one: Senior John
McCain-surrogate Nancy Pfotenhauer,
in an interview on MSNBC, praises the
people in "real Virginia," as opposed to
the "Democrats
[who] have just
moved into northern Virginia."
That same week, a state delegate
endorses an incumbent congressman by
saying, "This is real Virginia, right
where we are. And Virgil represents
real America, and real Virginia."
George Allen famously lost his
Senate seat in 2006 when he singled out
S.R. Sidharth, one of the only non-white
attendees at an event, as "Macaca, or
whatever his name is," and welcomed
him "to America, and the real world of
Virginia." Let's clear a few things up
about my state. Virginia is not a "purple state," nor is it a red state. When on
...

one driving trip you see a Prius with an
anti-war sticker, next to another sticker
that says "Get your laws off my gun,"
followed by a pickup with a confederate
flag, right next to an Obama 'OB sticker,
it's time to throw away the paint-bynumbers kit and add a little more depth
to the way we think of these things.
But I'm less interested here in how
the outside world sees us, and more
concerned about how people view their
own communities and society. It would
be nice to think the above quotes are
just cases ofelites trying to gin up local
pride, but the reality is that plenty of
people I've talked to believe in the
whole "real Virginia/fake Virginia"
thing. Certainly it's not all Virginians,
and it's probably not even most. But it's
enough.

Here's the problem.
It's one thing for people to take pride
in their communities and their country.
And it's not surprising that our communities and countries shape our perspectives about the world outside. But
it's a big problem when we begin to see
"outside" people as "others." And it's a
much bigger problem in a federal
democracy
or a globalized world
when even the people we see as "outsiders" can be just as affected as we are
by the political choices we make.
Let's go back to Virginia. Forget
arguing with the pundits
let's
assume
they're right.
Northern
Virginia and southern Virginia are
absolute monoliths, with all the conservatives in the south and the liberals in
the north.
People in southern Virginia have all
lived there for centuries, while the people in NoVA are all recent transplants
from the north. People in southern
Virginia
pride
being
take
in
"Virginians," while the new arrivals
from up north feel no loyalty to their
new homes. Even if we accept these
(obviously dubious) assumptions, our
political system is premised on the

ideal that every person and every vote
is equal, and that our political discourse should factor in the interests
and opinions of all citizens.
But the "Real Virginia" argument
doesn't advance anyone's interests, nor
does it provide an argument against
anybody else's. It's a way of delegitimizing people, of turning them into
"others." Earnest disagreements on
policies or differences in values turn
into disrespect and fears that people are
trying to "impose their views" unjustly.
This is not just a Virginia problem.
As a Swarthmore freshman, I was invited to the Facebook group "Coastal
States of America," a group promoting
the secession of certain northeastern
together
and Pacific western states
with a few Midwestern states
which
just happened to match the states John
Kerry won in 2004.
It was obviously a joke, but the sentiment was the same as that of
Pfotenhauer and Senator Allen: the people in the "Red States" essentially
belong to a different country from me;
why should I let their political beliefs
control the policies that affect me?
Just as people draw a line around
what is and what isn't "real Virginia,"
so too do people do this with America.
Many people adopt a mindset of "this is
America"
where "this" is typically
wherever the speaker resides.
People in big cities are probably
more likely to identify America as
diverse, busy and consumerist
traits
that happen to be particularly prominent in cities.
Likewise, a person living in a small
town in, say, rural Virginia, may be
more likely to identify factors like
close-knit communities and a greater
focus on tradition as "American."
This becomes a problem when contrasts appear: "My community is
America. This other community's values are in conflict with mine; they are
un-American."

This is a problem of replacing a failure of respect for ideas with a failure of
respect for people. And it is one of the
biggest problems with political discourse in this country.
In the dawning Age of Obama, it's
become a cliche to criticize a "politics
of difference," but the truth/is that
political contests driven by identifying
other Americans as outsiders and enemies are more the rule than the exception.
Think back to 2008. One presidential
campaign makes its motto "Country
First" and implies that, because their
rival has different ideological preferences, he is not as pro-America as their
candidate is. The chief strategist of a
different campaign pens an internal
memo stating, "I cannot imagine
America electing a president during a
time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American."
America is its people
all of them.
America may be "a center-right country," as many annoying pundits like to
say, but it is also "center-left" and "farleft" and "far-right" in 300 million different degrees.
With so many people and ideologies,
there are really only two ways to build
the majorities you need to get your preferences turned into policies. You can
accept the differences where they are
unalterable, seek common ground
where it exists and hope to reach out in
any way you can. Or you can bemoan
the "others," the infiltrators, and hope
that enough like-minded patriots will
join your cause of beating back these
outsiders.
The latter strategy has worked many
times and will be around for a long
time. But remember for a minute that
this is what both of the presidential
campaigns just mentioned attempted to
do. The target of their attacks is now in
the Oval Office.

Obama's challenge: Giving relativism a chance

Will Gtovinsky
The Commotion
The other night a friend and I
were up late working. He was
reading A Theory of Justice and
suddenly made a pejorative comment about John Rawls' lurching relativism.
"He just won't commit to his
theory!" he exclaimed.
I looked up and knew that I
would need to shelve my work
for at least half an hour. You see,
I consider myself a relativist. I'm
into multiple moral systems; I
don't believe one can say that

someone's actions or morals contradict any singular universal
truth or law. I explained this
position to my friend, who then
asked what alternative moral
mandate you could invoke if
your actions were deemed to be
inconsistent with a universal
truth.

believing that, in a given situa-

Such
restraint is quite valuable.
But why do I use my humble
Phoenix perch to ramble on
about these abstractions? There
are two reasons. First, I am very
hopeful that President Obama's
absolutely

foreign policy will swing away
from Bush's Axis of Evil universalism toward a more nuanced
and respectful tone that reflects
the best characteristics of relativists policy. That does not
mean we must reject our proclaimed self-evident truths, but
rather that we must remember
that the Founders placed a big,
fat "We hold" qualifier in front of
those truths when they penned
the Declaration of Independence.
(That famous sentence, in fact, is
a fine balance between the two
ideologies.)
The second reason is to discuss a pitfall that may trip up
such relativism. One of the nice
things about Universalism is

that it doesn't leave anybody out.
Even if a particular culture's
inclusion is, in fact, involuntary,
the Universalist writes it in with
the vague notion that they'll
thank him later. Relativism, on
the other hand, actually ends up
being more explicitly hegemonic. The relativist can only throw
up his hands and say, "Look, this
is how we see it. Tough luck."
To return to a previous issue,
then, how does one diplomatically and respectfully enforce something
like the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights?
The treatment of women in
Islamic theocracies is a wellworn example of this problem.
My answer would be to avoid
alienating rhetoric and to
patiently look for compromises.
Concessions can be bought with
good will and understanding,
whereas calling a culture uncivilized, immoral or inhumane is
sure to backfire.
So let's give relativism a
chance.

More difficult fights fruitless for men's basketball

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
Last week the Swarthmore men's basketball team
ended a four-game homestand with contests against
arch-rival Haverford (9-9, 6-6 CC) on Wednesday and
the top team in the Centennial Conference, Franklin &
Marshall (17-2, 10-2 CC), on Saturday. The Garnet
dropped both games and their record fell to 1-17 overall (0-12 CC). Even though the matches ultimately
resulted in defeats, the Garnet hotly contested both
matches.
As expected, the crowds turned out to witness the
Haverford-Swarthmore rivalry match, but even with
the fan support the Garnet could not get over the
hump and remains winless in the conference. The
team put together two solid halves, however, and
stayed in the game for the entire 40 minutes. Neither
team led by more than four points, the lead changed
seven times, and there were eight ties.
Throughout the first half, both sides exchanged
blows and entered the break knotted at 21-2 L The Fords
and the Garnet continued to swap baskets in the second half, when halfway through the 20-minute period
Haverford stretched the lead to four. Swarthmore
responded with a lay-up by co-captain Raul Ordonez
'O9. Sam Lacy 'll stymied the Fords' next two possessions single-handedly with a block (he had five that
night) and a steal. He then pulled the Garnet within
one point of the lead with a free throw. Ordonez scored
the next basket with 5:42 left in the game to put
Swarthmore up by one. It was a put-back of a missed
three-pointer, a play that brought Swat fans to their
feet, where they remained for the rest of the game.
That lead proved to be Swarthmore's last of the
game, however, and the Fords capitalized on a number
of Garnet miscues. With 1:32 left in the game, Ryan
Carmichael 11 cut the deficit to one with two free
throws, but Swarthmore squandered their opportunity
at the lead when Lacy committed an untimely offensive foul. Haverford used the window to push the score
to 43-40, and multiple last-second three-point attempts
by Swarthmore came up short.
The Garnet's player of the game was Carmichael,
who tied a career-high with a game-high 18 points.
Four of his baskets came beyond the three-point arc,

an outright career-high. Carmichael has elevated his
play in the last couple games, filling in for injured
guard/forward Danny Walker 'lO.
Co-captain Matt Allen 'lO commended Carmichael's
play. "He's been a lot more aggressive," he said.
"When he's confident and aggressive, it's so much easier for him. He's really helping us stay in a lot of
games." Allen said that he would like to see himself
step up his game like Carmichael has been doing
recently, because everyone needs to step up for this
team to win. "We just need to have a game where we
have a more well-rounded team effort," he said.
Carmichael continued his efficient play into the
Franklin & Marshall game, filling up the stat sheet
with 15 points, four assists and four rebounds.
Ordonez, the only senior on the Garnet's squad, was
also a dominant force, posting beastly game-highs of 20
points and 13 rebounds.

On paper, Swarthmore and Franklin & Marshall
seem like opposites. The Diplomats are at the top of
the conference, while Swarthmore rests at the bottom.
The Diplomats are first with a +10.6 scoring margin,
while Swarthmore is last with a margin of -14.2. The
Diplomats sink the highest percent of their shots (over
half), while the Garnet make only 39.6 percent of their
field goals, the worst percentage in the conference.
There is one significant similarity, however; each
team only has one senior. But Swarthmore's case is a
little different because Ordonez is such an integral
part of the team. "Raul is someone that we're really
going to have a hard time replacing, both as a leader
and as a presence down low," Allen said.
Despite the fact that both teams are young, the
game was well fought. During the first ten minutes of
the contest, each team held a four-point lead, and the
Garnet closed the Diplomats to one off a three-pointer
by Michael Giannangeli 'l2 to bring the score to 17-18.
From there, however, Franklin & Marshall went on a
7-0 run that spanned five minutes.
Swarthmore whittled the lead back down to four
before it ballooned to 12 right before the half, but the
Garnet caught the Diplomats off guard. With five seconds left in the half Ordonez grabbed a defensive
rebound, and after a series of passes it ended up in
Carmichael's hands a couple steps inside of half-court.
He sank a three-pointer which beat the buzzer and

sent the teams into the half with Franklin & Marshall
up 40-3

L
The Diplomats opened the second period with a 102 run and it seemed they would coast to victory, but
Swarthmore remained within striking distance for the
entire game. With three minutes left in the second
half, Ordonez and Carmichael combined to score
seven straight points for the Garnet and cut the deficit
to eight points, but Franklin & Marshall regrouped
and answered with two baskets in a row to put the
game away for good. The Diplomats won by a final
score of 70-60.
This outcome is much more favorable for the
Garnet than the two teams' earlier meeting in the season, when Franklin & Marshall won 92-67. "When we
played them earlier in the year, we were blown out,"
Allen said. "But we played better defense and we executed well." Allen noted another positive. "Offensively
we were a lot more patient," he said. "We slowed the
tempo of the game down, which is what we needed to
do to win the game." Since the Garnet was able to do
this, the outcome of the game might have been different if the team was also able to knock down shots,
which Allen deemed the Garnet's Achilles' heel.
Another area of concern for the Garnet is points in
the paint. In the last two games, the team has been
outscored 66-28 around the basket. Allen noted that in
the Franklin & Marshall game, the Diplomats were
able to thwart his team's press and get easy lay-ups,
which contributed to this discrepancy. Ordonez highlighted this same concern and also said that the inside
scoring was due to "offensive rebounding on their
part. They were able to get a lot of second-chance
points." As a solution, he noted that the team just has
to make sure to box out.
Look for the Garnet's points in the paint to rise this
weekend, however, as proven off-the-dribble scorer
Danny Walker 'lO returns to action at Dickinson on
Saturday at 4:00 PM. He said that his time on the
bench has been frustrating, but that it has given him
an opportunity to analyze his team. "I've had a chance
to look at our team play and see what things they're
doing well and what needs to be improved. I'm going to
try to fill in the gaps that are missing," he said.
"Sitting on the bench has inspired me to play to win
games."

(read:
San ton io
Holmes' total body control game-winning
catch), a lot of press has been devoted (and
rightly so) to Cardinals wide receiver Larry
Fitzgerald. After his incredible postseason
performance
it is easy to see why
Fitzgerald is such an exciting player to
watch. Watching him play football is a testament to the kind of athlete it takes to succeed at the top level of competitive sports.
We were all witnesses to the Larry
Fitzgerald show.
Standing 6'3" and weighing in at a hefty
220 pounds, Fitzgerald is a specimen, a true
athlete. As was evident when he squared up
with perennial Steeler pro-bowler Troy
Polamalu on Sunday, Fitzgerald's physique
allows him to shake and muscle even the
best defenders in the league. Even more
impressive is the breakaway speed with
which he can turn a small catch into a big
gain (perhaps illustrated best by his electrifying scamper to the end zone in the Super
,

Bowl). Interestingly, Fitzgerald ran an
unimpressive 4.67 at the NFL combine,
though his speed breaks games wide open.

Fitzgerald's ability to break big plays
demands special attention on the part of the
defense, which is a sign of a special player.
What most impresses me about
Fitzgerald is that he has hands like no

receiver I have ever seen. We've all seen
spectacular catch highlight reels on
YouTube and experienced big-name

receivers like Randy Moss and Terrell
Owens make superb grabs, but I find that

the one telling stat about Fitzgerald is drops.

This statistic records the number of times a

receiver is thrown a ball and drops the pass.
For Fitzgerald, after being targeted for over
150 passes this season, he only dropped two
balls, according to CBS Sports. To me, this is
incredible. I've witnessed games when
Owens has dropped more than that and
games when he has bungled a potentially
game-tying touchdown catch. The fact that
Fitzgerald nearly always snags a ball makes
him perhaps the most productive wide
receiver in the league.
I have to admit that, although I have not
watched a ton ofCardinals games before this
postseason (who has?), I have never seen
Fitzgerald drop a pass. I'm especially

impressed when he uses his size and jumptiming ability to beat cornerbacks in the
endzone on fade routes. I sympathize with
defensive backs when I see Fitzgerald soar
up and snag a ball at a height impossible for
any defender to block; that's just evolution,
my friend. Fitzgerald's body is a weapon. He
can manipulate himself in mid-air to do
things standard human beings like you or
me could not possibly contemplate. In addition to simply making catches on a separate
plane of existence, Fitzgerald is able to

bounce off of tackles that a lesser receiver
would not be able to shake. Fitzgerald averages about 15 yards per catch, which is quite
useful considering that the first-down dis-

tance is typically less than that.
I can guarantee you that there is not an
NFL team that would not want a player like
Fitzgerald on its roster. By being such an
incredible receiving threat, Fitzgerald opens
up the field for other players like receiver
Anquan Boldin (also a pro-bowl receiver).
Having such a prolific target as Fitzgerald
forces a defense to take calculated risks that
leave them vulnerable to exploitation in
other aspects, most notably the running
game. I say with some confidence that the
Arizona Cardinals minus 'Fitzgerald would
be a much different team. However, as we all
saw on Sunday night, having one great player does not make a team. It certainly helps,
but it does not necessarily define the outcome of a game. Ending the year on such a
great game as Super Bowl XLITJ truly makes
it a shame that we have such a long stretch
until we are able to witness football's gloririous return.

added, "It is going to be really important for us to put
together a solid 40-minute performance against
Dickinson and Muhlenberg something I know that we
can do."
"Defense is about knowing your player's strengths
and weakness and forcing them to play to their weakness, Brajtbord explained, noting that an outstanding
defensive effort was key in the Garnet's triumph over
Dickinson earlier this season.
In their first matchup with Muhlenberg on Dec. 4,
the Garnet surrendered 23 points to Chili in a 70-83 loss.
Dickinson's Muller scored 16 points on Jan. 10, but she
shot a poor percentage (4-for-13 from the field). The
Garnet defense buckled down to earn a 71-56 victory.
The Garnet will need a similar performance to put
themselves among the top five teams in the conference

Intense chatter floods through the canyons of Tarble
Pavilion on weeknights. Those running on the indoor
track, walking through the main lobby and entering
the trainers' room can hear it. The basketballs pounding against the hardwood and the sneakers chirping on
the floor serve as the perfect canvas for the women's
basketball team's symphony of focus. "Ball! Ball! Ball!"
There is shouting and screaming as the defender rips
her hands into the air to contest, and the forwards
whirl their heads toward the basket, pivoting their bodies for a chance at the rebound. The intense defensive
drills that the Garnet repeat in practice will be key
determinants of their playoff destiny in the upcoming
week. The Garnet will face against conference-leading
Muhlenberg (13-0) and third-place Dickinson (7-4),
whom the Garnet (7-5) are only a half game behind in
the conference standings. Last Saturday, against
Franklin and Marshall (7-4), Swarthmore lost by a
score of 61-55, pushing them back into sixth place in the
conference, a half game back of Dickinson, Franklin
and Marshall, and McDaniel, who are jammed in the
middle with records of 8-5.
Kathryn Stockbower 'll said, "It was definitely a
frustrating loss because we knew that it was a winnable
game that slipped through our fingers in the final minutes." Christina Duron 'l2 added, "Our poor defense
during the last few minutes was the reason they took
that game away from us. We are not as aggressive as we
should be on defense, but we can fine-tune that, and I
know we'll be ready for Dickinson and Muhlenberg."
Swarthmore is last in the eleven-team conference in
scoring defense, allowing 64.5 points per game, and
eighth in field goal percentage defense, allowing opponents to shoot 38.9 percent. All of their upcoming opponents rank in the top half of the conference offensively:
Dickinson is sixth averaging 62.6 points per game,
Muhlenberg is first averaging 70.5 points per game, and
Gettysburg is second averaging 65.9 points per game.
With matchups against two of the top scorers in the
conference, defense will make or break the Garnet's
playoff hopes.
Muhlenberg first-year Alexandra Chili is second in
the conference, scoring at 17.0 points per game, while
Dickinson junior Brooke Muller is fifth with 15.7 points
per game. "We really just want to take Chili and Muller
out of their games and force them to do things that they
aren't as good at," Sarah Brajtbord 'll said. Stockbower

The crucial upcoming stretch, with three of the final
six regular season games to be played against teams in
the playoff hunt (Muhlenberg, Dickinson and
Gettysburg), is the homestretch that will ultimately
determine whether the Garnet will play in the postseason.
The focus level is there, and the expectations are
high. Duron cited a team goal to "grab either the second
or third spot in conference" after all is said and done.
Brajtbord pointed out that, "If we don't get to the
playoffs, we will be unsatisfied and disappointed. This
team deserves a spot in the playoffs, and that spot is
there for us. We just need to take it."
The Garnet will travel to Dickinson on Saturday and
will face Muhlenberg on the road on Tuesday.

Tired swimmers shot down by speedy Bullets

The Swarthmore men's and women's
swim teams faced the Gettysburg
College Bullets last Saturday in a challenging meet.
Both Swat squads
emerged unsuccessful but not disheartened.
"Gettysburg is always a tough meet
for us," co-captain Anne Miller 'lO said.
"We're still tired from our training trip
and haven't started taper practices
yet." During taper, swimmers decrease
their overall yardage and increase the
intensity of their practices, usually in

includes
the
Swarthmore,
Conference championship meet in late
February. The slippery walls and long
drive to Gettysburg also didn't help this
Saturday.
Additionally, because the Gettysburg
pool only has six lanes, no capacity for
warm-up or cool-down laps exists.
When swimming at home in ten-lane

Ware Pool, athletes can swim down
after their races in the outside lanes, an
important step in the recovery process.

The women's team ended the meet
with a 193-69 loss, and the men's team
finished with a 146-100 loss. However,
the Swarthmore teams did see some
very positive individual performances

at Gettysburg.
Miller emerged victorious in both
the 100 and 200-yard butterfly events,
with times of 1:0L73 and 2:14.15, respectively. Several other athletes also had
strong showings, such as Naomi
Glassman 'l2, who placed third in the
100 and 200-yard butterfly races.
On the men's side, co-captain Doug
Gilchrist-Scott 'O9 captured the 50-yard
freestyle title in 22.4 seconds. Stephen
Shymon 'O9 secured a Garnet victory in
the 500-yard freestyle with a time of

5:03.49, a full six seconds ahead of the
second-place Gettysburg swimmer.
Sterling Satterfield 'll came in first
place in the 100-yard breaststroke with
a time of 1:01.49, as well as the 200-yard
breaststroke, clocking in at 2:14.00. The
relay team of Tim Brevart 'l2, Neil
Palmer 'l2, Michael Ahn 'lO and
Gilchrist-Scott worked together to win
the 400-yard freestyle relay with a time
of 3:2L57.

In preparation for this season, the
swim team trained in sunny Aruba
over winter break. The athletes bonded
and enjoyed the warm weather on their
one-and-a-half days off with activities
like snorkeling and ATV (all-terrain
vehicle) rides. However, Aruba was
"nowhere near as relaxing as it
sounds," Naomi Glassman 'l2 said.
Every day, the team began practice in
the pool at 6 a.m.
Later in the afternoon, they returned
for a second practice, combining both
dry-land workouts and workouts in the
water. Some practices lasted nearly
five hours.
"The trip was a really intense bonding experience," Miller said. "You really get to know your teammates. We
trained and suffered together, but it
was overall a lot of fun."
The swim teams indeed consider
themselves a very tight-knit group.
"The men's and women's teams act as
one," Glassman said.
"Our meets are scored separately, but
in most other regards, we are one team.
We practice together, eat dinner together,
[hang out] together and study together."

Co-captain Reid Wilkening
agrees. "Everyone thinks of swimming
as an individual sport, but it's really
not," he said.
"Everyone contributes." Although
some members of the team have individually

performances,

each member has his or her own specialties and strengths.
Now, the team looks ahead to the
Centennial Conference meet, which is
hosted by Franklin and Marshall
College. "Conferences are really what
we are working for all season long,"
Wilkening said.
The Swarthmore men's team came in
second in the Centennial Conference
last year behind Franklin and
Marshall. The women's team also finished second, trailing Gettysburg
College. This year, both teams hope for
at least a repeat performance or better.
The Swarthmore men's and women's
swim teams next compete at home this
Saturday, February 7 at 2 p.m.
