What's in a name? $4.5 to 25 million

but Bloom did invite Raciti to his office so

BY MEGO LIEN

mlienl@swarthmore.edu

Although students have become accustomed to calling them the science center
and the new dorm, Swarthmore's latest two
developments must eventually be named.
They will be named, but not in the near
future, Director of Development John
Malcolm said.
With no clear deadline in sight,

Swarthmore is still in communication with
potential donors, who must contribute at
least half the cost of construction for buildings to bear their names.
This means that students living in the
new dorm could still be calling it just that
far into next year or beyond. "It could be
'the new dorm' for a few years until someone makes a commitment," Malcolm said.
Most pioneer residents of the new dorm

have shrugged about the generic name of
their future home. "I've gotten used to calling it 'new dorm,'" Bella Liu 'O7 said. "It's
kind of a name by itself."
Others had their own ideas for naming
the dorm.
Joe Raciti 'O5, who will be an RA in the
new dorm next year, recently attempted to
take matters into his own hands by sending
a "clean, new, ironed" one-dollar bill to
President Al Bloom's office, Raciti said via

e-mail.

The dollar was a down payment on his
future alumni donations, Raciti wrote to
Bloom. He requested that the new dorm be

named "Raciti" and promised to contribute
more money "in the 40 percent chance that
I will be filthy rich when I get older," he
wrote in the letter.
The college declined the offer, Bloom's
executive coordinator Laura Warren said,

they could get better acquainted.
"Although I was honored to have been
invited to the President's Office," Raciti
said, "I decided not to meet with President
Bloom, because I was afraid that he would
turn into a warewolf and bite my leg off."
Naming the science center, which costs
$5O million in construction compared to
the new dorm's $9 million, would take a

more considerable gift, Malcolm said.
For now, the development office has
secured donors only for small components
of the building, such as the outdoor classroom and the biology department's conference and seminar room.
The donors' names were not disclosed
due to concerns about confidentiality, but
the college will reveal most in individual
dedication ceremonies held early in the fall.
But Eugene Lang '3B has already dedicated the science center commons area to
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6L
"I'm somewhat overwhelmed," said

Unlike the Lang Performing Arts Center (above) and most other buildings, the science

center awaits a name. Donors must contribute at least half the cost of construction for
the building to bear their names.

Malcolm said.
The construction of the science center
and the new dorm is part of the capital campaign, which attempts to raise new funds for
the endowment and new buildings, Eldridge
said. The campaign has set its goal at $230

three years. The college has raised about
$153 million, with a promise by Lang to contribute $5 million if the goal of $225 million

Board to decide on living wage in October meeting
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
dconner2@swarthmore.edu
After nearly four years of discussion, the Board of Managers
has set a "firm deadline" to make
a decision on the living wage
issue at its Oct. 2 meeting, accord-

ing to Melanie Young, associate
vice president for Human

Resources.

Young, who co-chaired the Ad
Hoc Committee on a Living Wage,
and other committee members
said they were looking forward to

the conclusion of what has been a

contentious issue on campus.
"I'd like it to be resolved," she

said.

"At times it's been frustrating
that it's taken four years," committee member Nate Wessler 'O4,
a founding member the living
wage movement, said. "I think the
committee put together a very
strong report."
A recent student survey found
29 percent of respondents had not
formed an opinion on the living
wage. Now that the different
options are on the table, most of
the uncertainty for students, faculty and staff has been attributed
to not yet knowing where the
funding for such a proposal would
come from.

THE PHOENIX

Student Council had hoped to
have a referendum this semester
on the living wage, Co-President
Jyoti Gupta 'O5 said, but wanted
to wait to get financial reports
from the college's treasurer, Sue
Welsh. Instead, Gupta said, the
referendum will almost certainly

board's decision. Gupta, also a
member of a working group the
board set up to investigate the
issue, said she believes it does.
"My impression is that it fits
in a lot," Gupta said. "The Board
of Managers is always trying to
find out what's important to stu-

The living wage proposals by the numbers
The Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage recommended a
raise of the minimum wage to $10.72 per hour, with adjustments for benefits and wage compression for those making up
to $lB per hour. A substantial minority recommended a minimum wage of $13.89 per hour, with parallel adjustments for
those making up to $2l per hour.

"It's important to gauge student opinion on this. Student

students," she said. But many

have wondered whether student
input will truly influence the

The planned referendum will
list different options, as well as

which would help determine students' priorities, Gupta said.
While there has been much stu-

dent-led effort to gather information on student attitudes toward
the living wage, little more has
been done to get the same information from faculty and staff.
Wessler said he was "disappointed
with the mechanisms of receiving

community feedback ... most glaringly, staff and low-wage staff
have been marginalized in this
process." The responsibility for
including them in the process is
the responsibility of the administration, he said.
But Young said she thought
the opportunities had been there.
"I don't think there's a way to
force people to talk about it," she
said. "I think there have been
plenty of opportunities for people
to respond, both in person and in
writing."
In the end, she said, "I think
it's accurate to say that there's
not really a consensus." And
Wessler, Gupta and Young agreed
that getting input from the community is very important to the
Board of Managers' decision.
"It's really vital that the
administration gets the feedback

from staff, faculty and students,"
Wessler said.
Much of the concern among
staff has been the concern that
with wage increases might come
job loss. Without knowing yet
where the funding for a living
wage proposal would come from, "I
think it's a legitimate worry,"
Young said. "Our financial pressures will not go away. Short of
coming from a very wealthy donor,
it will have to come from cuts
and that's always bad. It's more a

said.

Ultimately, he thinks the college
is capable of finding the money to
support a living wage, whether it

comes from things as small as

years instead of every four, or
from cuts students and professors
are willing to take. "I see this as

Though much work remains to

Student-run poll reveal Swat attitudes
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN

bbangiel@swarthmore.edu

A recent Swarthmore poll revealed students are less liberal than they think.
The poll, conducted by Colin HoltzEakin 'O7 and Matt Fiedler 'O6, asked students to identify themselves as "extremely
liberal, slightly liberal, middle of the road,
slightly conservative or extremely conservative." Results show that 22 percent identified as extremely liberal, 53 percent slightly liberal, 12 percent middle of
the road and 8 percent as
slightly conservative.
When students were
asked about the ideology
of their classmates, 51 percent of their classmates
were extremely liberal

"For the most part, I'm not uncomfortable," Catherine Healy 'O7, who identified
religion as very important in her life, said.
"I think religion is not important to most
people at Swarthmore, but they are tolerant at least."
Fiedler and Holtz-Eakin have been
working on the poll all year. Political science professor Keith Reeeves 'BB advised
them. The poll was distributed to 904 students who were randomly selected from an

almost a two-to-one margin, but the numbers aren't overwhelming, and so many
students have no opinion."

Final results will be released next fall

percent, of those polled
felt uncomfortable expressing their political views on campus. More than half of selfidentified conservatives feel uncomfortable expressing their political views on

felt the same way. Among students who
identified as liberal, only 13 percent felt
uncomfortable expressing their opinions
on campus.
Fewer students were uncomfortable

Students who said religion was not very

expressing their religious beliefs than students who said religion was fairly or very

Fiedler estimates that they have spent

Students of all degrees of faith supported same-sex marriage, but support ranged
from 66 percent among very religious students to 95 percent among nonreligious students. A recent poll released by the
Princeton Survey Research Associates
found that 59 percent of Americans oppose

The poll also unveiled student opinions

living wage than men. Fifty-three percent
of women supported a wage increase, while

The pollsters were unable to explain the
gender gap. "When we saw that, both of
Colin's and my jaws dropped," Fiedler said.
"If I could explain the gender gap for living wage, then I would be able to explain all
the differences between men and women. I
can't do that," Holtz-Eakin said.
Other results were less surprising. For
instance, 88 percent of students either
strongly disapprove or disapprove of the
way George W Bush is handling his job as
president, and 81 percent felt that "things

about," Fiedler said. "I'm not sure whether
we really know what other kids believe,
whether we just talk past each other,
whether there is a common ground."
Fiedler and Holtz-Eakin hope to make
the poll annual. "This year, the money for
the poll came from the President's Office,"
Holtz-Eakin said. "Next year, it'll hopefully
be covered by the Center for Policy Studies,
which is run by Professor Reeves."
Holtz-Eakin hopes to improve the quality of the poll for next year. "There were a
number of questions which were not
phrased as well as they could have been, or
introduced as well, to provide context. It's
part of the challenge in doing something
for the first time," he said. After finals, the
pollsters plan to spend time looking over
the comments on the surveys to figure out
how to improve it for future years.

Budgeting completed, closed-event funding not allocated
BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

After two 14-hour sessions, Student
Committee has provided 86 groups
with a total of $379,370.25 for next year.
The total amount requested by groups
was $428,005.24, Student Budget Manager
JeffTraczynski 'O4 said.
Last week, SBC presented all groups

Budget

with tentative budgets.
The Swarthmore Asian Organization,
Folk Dance Club and WSRN elected to
appeal their budget on Sunday.
They were all granted more money,
although not the full amount they had
requested. None of the groups furthered
their appeals to the Student Council on

Tuesday night, so the budget drafted by

SBC is now final.

According to Traczynski,

4

there were

not many major changes made this year
to the budgets of individual groups.
The only larger group given a drastically different budget was Forum for Free
Speech, because the group will now be
responsible for funding the receptions
usually accompanying lectures. Its budget
was increased by approximately $2,000.
Traczynski

also noted that more

groups appealed to SBC last year with one
group bringing its appeal before the council.

Committee member Joe Alberti 'O6

said the primary goal of the SBC was the
keep all of the groups happy, which he
believes they did.

According to Alberti, tensions did run
high at times. One contentious discussion
occurred with Deshi, an open support
group for South Asian students, over
closed-event funding. The committee will

not allocate closed-event funding until the
fall.
"That was kind of an argumentative
one," Alberti said.
But Deshi did not appeal any of the
budgeting decisions. President Anisha
Chandra 'O6 said she felt the budgeting
was fair. "We're quite happy with how
budgeting was handled," she said.
Committee member Lizzy Vogel 'O7
said it was not unusual for groups unhappy with budgeting decisions to simply
accept them and not bother appealing.
"Not all groups are completely satisfied
with their budgets," she said. "More
groups are unhappy than [those that]
appeal." Vogel was not surprised that only
three groups appealed. "All the groups
seemed pretty agreeable at the funding
itself," she said. "It was pretty uneventful."
According to Alberti, only 9.5 percent

April 29, 2004

of the budgets requested by all groups
was cut, down from the 19 percent cut
two years ago. But "the vast, vast majority of groups take a cut in some form"
from their desired budget, Traczynski
said.
SAO Co-President Wendy Cheung said
SAO had filed an appeal because "we just
didn't feel that we got the money that was
necessary. They cut the budget a lot more
than last year." She added that SAO members were concerned that SBC was not
allocating closed-group funding right now,

but hat their appeal was more general.
Marie Mark 'O5 of the Women's
Resource Center was pleased that SBC
was well informed about the group's past
activities and took them into account
while making budgeting decisions. "We're
very happy with the tentative budget they
gave us," Mark said.

Students march for women's rights in D.C.
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY SARAH DONOVAN

sdonoval@swarthmore.edu
Just before Hillary Rodham
Clinton
spoke, a group of
Swarthmore students arrived on
the Mall in Washington, D.C, for
the March for Women's Lives last

Sunday.

Clinton and other speakers,
including actors Susan Sarandon
and Whoopi Goldberg, were on a
stage in the middle of a sea of people that covered every inch of the
Mall grass.
Organizers of the march hoped
use the event to bring reproductive and women's rights back to
the forefront of political discourse, The Washington Post
reported on Monday.
According to Pro-Choice Task

board member Anisha
Chandra 'O6, the main issues
marchers wanted to raise were

Force

abortion, emergency contraception, abstinence-only education
and the "global gag rule," with
which the Bush administration
has cut funding to any organization worldwide that provided
abortions or talked about them to
patients.
"Everyone had their own
issues to bring," Chandra said.
"There were people speaking for
almost every issue."
Chandra saw representatives
of the groups Republicans for
Choice and Catholics for Choice
at the march, and she knew of
some pro-life marchers. She was
impressed by the solidarity.
"It was so all-encompassing
that a lot of people identified with
at least some aspect of it," she

said.

"Everywhere you look, you
are surrounded by people who are
working for the same thing you
are," said Jenny Holm 'O7, who
had been planning to attend the
march since October.

Many
students
from
Swarthmore marched behind a
banner that read "Swarthmore

Students for Choice," Sophie
Horowitz 'O7 said. The march lasted nearly two and half hours and
was followed by more speeches.
After the march, the attendance was announced to the
crowd. The organizers claimed
Ll5 million people had attended

the march, which would have
made it the largest in U.S. history.
After the march, Holm said,
"Seeing everybody there and feeling that energy, we really
believed that we can change
something."
Nearly 100 Swarthmore students, some joined by their parents, were among the marchers.
More than 100 Haverford students
attended, and Bryn Mawr sent
over 200.
The college's planning for the
march began in the fall, when
Eleanor Smeal, the president of
the
national
organization
Feminist Majority, came to speak
on campus.
The Pro-Choice Task Force
and Swarthmore Progressive
Action Committee co-sponsored
Swarthmore's participation in
the march and began to publicize
it then. By mid-April, all the
seats on the busses had been
taken.
Early Sunday morning, two

school buses left Swarthmore carrying 75 students, according to
Chandra, whose mother flew in
from California for the march.

Other students carpooled and
joined the group in Washington.
"A lot of students were marching with their parents. My parents flew in from Texas," PCTF
Treasurer Emily Nolte 'O7 said.
Nolte was responsible for raising the $1,200 needed to cover the
cost of the school buses, tolls and
parking. The marchers received
$450 from the PCTF budget and
$4OO from SPAC.

By tabling in Sharpies for

donations and collecting money
on Parrish Beach and in McCabe,
students were able to raise $3OO,

"People who believe men and
women are equal are a majority
in this country, but the people

believe that," she said.
The march attempted to "make
people aware that there are still a
lot of us who are pro-choice and
there's still a lot of work to be

done," Horowitz said.
While the event was called
March for Women's Lives, participating were hundreds of thousands of men also marched.
"It was so heartening to see
men there who think that women
should have the right to choose,"
Holm said.
At least ten male students

from Swarthmore attended the
march, and many also contributed donations to the march
transportation fund.
"A lot of men donated, and it
was really nice to know that a lot
of people recognize that it's not
just a cause for women and that

everyone should be involved,"

College pursues socially responsible investing
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN

akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

Gone are the days when Quaker principles prevented
Swarthmore from investing in the three vice-ridden industries of alcohol, tobacco and firearms. Yet as the first
undergraduate institution to sponsor a shareholder resolution since the apartheid era, Swarthmore believes it has
made socially responsible investing a major element of its
investment policy.
The college recently announced that two Fortune 500
companies had altered their employment policies to bar

discrimination of potential employees based on sexual orientation. Under pressure from Swarthmore and other
shareholders, Masco and Dover have adopted more equitable employment policies, according to the college's

Treasurer Sue Welsh.

Last year, Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, also
changed its non-discrimination policies after Swarthmore
introduced a shareholder resolution. This made the college
the first educational facility to sponsor such a resolution
leading to policy changes, Welsh said.

Lockheed Martin was twice faced with a shareholder
resolution sponsored by Swarthmore to incorporate sexual orientation in its anti-discrimination employment policy. The resolution failed to win enough votes to pass

immediately, but under pressure from queer rights
groups and members of its own workforce, it eventually

relented.

Last week, Morgan Simon 'O4, a member of the
Committee on Socially Responsible Investing, co-founded
The Responsible Endowments Coalition, which bridges
socially responsible investment research between institutions.

The coalition defines socially responsible investing as

"the use of investments for social good by choosing to
invest in certain companies, or participation in their
reform through shareholder resolutions and dialogue,"
according to its Web site.
One difficulty with defining socially responsible investing is that investors have different values they wish to promote. Mark Amstutz, the college's director of investments,
said some conservative Christian groups are pressuring

companies to consider socially responsible investing to
exclude companies extending equal employment benefits
to queer workers, the direct opposite of Swarthmore's
views.

m

Amstutz also argued that Swarthmore's previous policy
of non-investment in tobacco, alcohol and defense now
seems obsolete.
Originally, the college's investments focused on
Quaker-friendly activities. During the 1920s and 19305, the
April 29,

college owned stocks in areas classified as railroads, public utilities, banks and industrial. In the 19705, as stock
investment replaced bonds as the major component of the
endowment and companies diversified to multiple industries, the college no longer followed this Quaker directive,
according to Welsh.
"When we started adding more managers and when
companies started getting more diversified and becoming
conglomerates, we just decided to expand our investments," Welsh said.
Dick Willis '33, an emeritus board member who has
been involved in investment policies at Swarthmore for
almost 40 years, said it was Swarthmore's policy to promote peace and discourage vice when investing.
"For a short time we had the CEO of Phillip Morris on
our board, and he just couldn't understand why we wouldn't invest in tobacco companies," Willis said.
The first major instance of Swarthmore student
involvement in investing was the divestment movement
against companies doing business in apartheid South
Africa. Swarthmore chose to become part of this movement because it was an international movement of an
unprecedented scale. "We thought it had a higher chance
of success," Welsh said.

Crew works overtime to finish dorm on time

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Despite losing 30 days of construction time due to bad weather,
the college hopes the new dorm
will be finished by the time students return in the fall.
The construction team has
been putting in extra hours to
ensure that the dorm will open as
planned on Aug. 27, according to

Director of Facilities Stuart Hain.
"I'm not getting any alarm

bells from Facilities that they're
worried" about opening on time,
Director of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal said.

Since problems with weather
and timely arrival of building
material can be unpredictable,
Westphal said it was possible the
dorm would not open on time.
"We're hoping it will be done a
few days early and not a few days
late," she said.
"It will be completed by the
time students arrive in late
August," according to Bill Cumby
Jr., president of WS. Cumby and

Sons, the construction firm contracted to build the dorm.
"If I were you, I'd be skeptical
too," he said, but his confidence
rested in an experienced team that
included Project Manager Larry

Briggs

Though the project has lost 30 days to inclimate weather, the college believes the new dorm will open in time in the fall for students.

and Project

Matthew Sheehan, who have successfully dealt with similar construction delays in the past.
The workday, which has been
extended by two hours, now runs
from 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., according
to Hain. Additionally, crews will
be working on Saturdays.
If any work is delayed by rain
during the week, workers will also
be on site Sunday. The stonema-

sons are especially hindered by

cent complete, Hain said.
"Once the roof is on, the weather won't be a factor," he said. The
roof is scheduled for completion
in a week and a half.
Meanwhile, Hain is hopeful for
cooperative weather. "It can rain
at night, just not during the day,"
he said.
In the future, the construction
will be run on two shifts and last
until 11 p.m. In consideration for
students studying for exams, Hain
said, this second shift will not
begin until after senior honors

exams.
So far, $25,000 has been paid in

overtime, according to Hain. "I
think that number will go up considerably with the second shift,"
he said.
Although workers in the second shift will not be receiving full
overtime pay, they will receive a
premium.
The money for overtime pay is
within initial budget plans for the
dorm construction, which included funds for this purpose.
Westphal said students living
in the new dorm next semester
need not be concerned about
arriving on campus with no place
to live.
"I feel strongly we are not
going to motel rooms," she said.
Bella Liu 'O7, who will be living
in the new dorm, is not worried
about the building having a
delayed opening. "I'm sure they'll
take care of that one way or the
other," she said.
Westphal said students might
be greeted next fall with workers,
carpet-layers and technical incon-

veniences.

"There will be no leisurely

with all new buildings, there
might be some systems that won't
be functioning perfectly," she

said.

"I'm not a particularly light
sleeper, so I could deal with a little
noise," Mark Piper 'O6 said.
"It would annoy me, but it
wouldn't make my life miserable,"

said Marty Griffith 'O5, who will
be an RA in the new dorm. "As
long as I'm not being woken up at
six in the morning."
"As long as I can live in my
room, I'll be happy," Liu said.
"Running water, windows, floors,
doors" are also important, she
said.
All "finishing touches" being

made after Aug. 27 will be in public places rather than residential
rooms, according to Westphal. The

landscaping surrounding
the
dorm will not be complete until
spring 2005, she said.
According to Cumby, all
aspects dealing with "use and
occupancy of the building and life
safety [including] fire alarms,
smoke detectors, heating ventilation, plumbing and finishes" will
be complete in time for students to

arrive.
The first floor lounge may be
incomplete on student move-in
day because a shipment of large
windows may not arrive on time,
Cumby said.
Westphal hopes students will
"love and take care of the building
so it stays gorgeous, pristine and
fresh."
The
new dorm is still
unnamed, and it is uncertain
when that will change (see story,
pg. 3). "It's waiting for someone to
adopt it financially," Westphal
said.

College to review race-based admission programs
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY CAROLINE GRUBBS
cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu
In light of the June 2003 Supreme Court
ruling on the use of race in college admissions, Swarthmore will be reviewing pro-

grams that use race in their selection
processes.
The Supreme Court decision permitted
the University of Michigan and other

schools to use race as a factor in admis-

sions but banned the use of point systems

for minorities.
The court considered two cases, one
involving Michigan's law school and the
other, its undergraduate college. In its law
school ruling, the court held thatrace could
be taken into account in the admissions
process because the law school's policy was
"narrowly tailored" in that it used a holistic, individualized approach. In the undergraduate case, however, the court ruled
that the admissions policy of awarding
points based on race is not a "narrowly tailored" program and thus unconstitutional.
These rulings prompted the Equal

Opportunity Office and the President's
Office to initiate a "proactive review to
ensure that the college's programs remain
legally viable," Equal Opportunity Officer
Sharmaine LaMar said. "We're looking at
programs that use race in the selection
process. A primary example of this is

admissions."

"I welcome it. We want to
make sure that we're
within our legal rights."
Jim Bock '9O
Dean of Admissions
"I welcome it," Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O said of the
reviews. "We want to make sure that we're
within our legal rights." Bock said he
expected thereviews to begin this summer.
The admissions office does follow a narrowly tailored process, Bock said. "We

believe in affirmative action and
the value it adds to the educational experience," Bock said. "We take a holistic
approach to the review process [of applications]. We take everything into account."
The admissions office does not assign
points to minorities, Bock said. The college
offers no merit scholarships based on race,
he said, noting that it was unclear whether
colleges should have such scholarships.
"Swarthmore offers our financial aid
support to any student whose family is not
able to meet our charges. The amount we
offer is never influenced by race or ethnicity. In fact, we don't know race or ethnicity when making the awards," Director of
Financial Aid Laura Talbot said in an email.
One of the aspects of the admissions
program that will likely be reviewed is its
recruiting techniques, Bock said.

strongly

The weekend includes cultural events,
talks with faculty and deans and the opportunity to see the campus. This is one of the
programs that could be vulnerable, Bock
said.
"Is it OK? Is it legally safe?" he said. "I
think it is, because it's not an admissions
decision, but it may not be."
A program would be vulnerable if it did
not meet the standards outlined in the
Michigan decision, LaMar said.

She said the review process was in its
formative stages and that it was still "undetermined" exactly which programs other
than admissions would be up for review.
"We're gathering information to determine
what college programs are out there that
have race as a selection criteria and whether
these programs in their current state meet
the Michigan requirements," she said.
The process may take some time. "We
plan to be thorough," she said. The reviews
will be conducted by "the full group ofsenior
administrators and faculty who are responsible for race-conscious programs at
Swarthmore," LaMar said.

Questioning Ride the Tide
While the college may agree on

other Ride the Tide activities have
raised other concerns.
During three jam-packed days
at Swarthmore, admitted students
were treated to everything from
movie screenings to exclusive faculty lectures to trolley tours of

need to bend over backwards to
recruit the best of the best, sometimes to the detriment of the col-

lege's true personality.
"We are good enough not to

Halpern said.
...

Ride the Tide "does seem a little
elaborate," Yervasi said.
Kuperberg remembered when

process
The
reduces the quality of students,
who "waste time trying to look
good instead of being good," he
said.
But competition among institutions for the best students is also
fierce and frenzied, Bock said. The
college needs programs like Ride
the Tide to improve its reputation
and visibility against other
schools. Last year, 50 percent of
those who attended Ride the Tide
matriculated to Swarthmore.
But with increasing numbers of
high school students vying for
acceptance, Kuperberg marveled
that Swarthmore would have any
difficulty in finding qualified
applicants. "Kids are trying to get
in like crazy, and we feel like we
can't get students," he said. "Both
of these statements can't be true."
"Why are we playing this
game?" Halpern said. "We don't
need to be driven by ratings.
People will find us."
Bock disagreed, and cited statistical evidence that lower rankings, even a drop by one or two
spaces, resulted in a reduced number of applications. "We need to

encourage others to think about
us," he said.
Applications to the college
dropped by 4.8 percent this year,
The Phoenix reported earlier this
month. Swarthmore is currently
ranked number three among
national liberal arts colleges in the
U.S. News & World Report's survey of colleges.
Kuperberg questioned schools'
desires to discover the best of the
best. "Say we have a 50 percent
attrition rate from not being cool
so we don't have trolleys," he said.
"Then we just admit those with 1600
SATs who wouldn't have gotten in
otherwise," and you wouldn't be
able to tell the difference, he said.
Admissions officers overestimate their ability to pick the essential person to attend Swarthmore,
Kuperberg said, arguing that students are most comfortable at
schools simply where they are
engaged in their classes.
In an experimental plan "to
save the universe," Kuperberg proposed that colleges identify minimum standards for acceptance and
randomly admit students who
qualify. The policy would eliminate pressure on both sides of the
admissions process
"and we'd
save a lot of money by getting rid
of admissions officers," he said.
Schwartz recently submitted a
paper to the Chronicle for Higher
Education advocating a similar
plan.
The admissions process is 'an
unmitigated disaster
the most
colossal example of social waste I
can think of," he said. "Everyone is
trying to be a maximizer, but it's
not achievable, so people end up
suffering in the effort."
But for now, Bock remains firm
about the importance of his job for
the college. The fact remains that
students can matriculate at only
one institution, making visibility
and a good reputation essential to
the school, he said.
"Look at what everyone else is
doing," Bock said. "How could we
afford to not do that?"

Senior embarks on cross-country visit to alumni

Greg Lok 'O4, like many college students, has been
planning a road trip in his mind for a long time. It's been
on that "life goals" list for a while, which is why he is so
excited to finally be setting off across the country with
only a few books and the radio to keep him company.

Eventually, he wants to make lifelong contacts, and,
with luck, friends.
"I'm hoping for 15 to 20 people I can send Christmas
cards to," he said. The goals don't stop there: Lok wants

to meet 100 alumni in the next two years. For now,
though, he is just looking forward to the "very personal
journey" to begin July 10, his birthday.
"My dad still thinks I'm crazy," he said. "But there are
two ways of learning, one where someone tells you something, and one where you learn as you go along. I'm OK
with making mistakes as long as they're on my own."

stages of life and locations.

Lok got the idea to meet former Swatties specifically
during the time he spent looking for a job at Career
Services, where director Nancy Burkett encourages students to tap into the alumni database.

"They're out there and they want to help," Burkett

said. Students are often hesitant to contact alumni
because they are unsure of what to say and how to ask for

help.

"We can provide suggestions on how to connect with
alums," she said.
Along the way, he will do the typical road trip things:
drive long distances in the Southwest, exchange books
with people he meets, ride in silence with only his
thoughts to keep him company.
"A couple of alumni have offered to house me," Lok
said. "But I'd also like to get a sleeping bag and sleep outside under the stars sometime."

NYU student living in
library gets free room
BY NILS I. PALSSON
WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS (NEW YORK U.)
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK, April 26

After nearly eight

months of secretly living in a New York University library
basement, Steve Stanzak was relocated by university officials Tuesday when they discovered his Live Journal
Weblog, which details his subterranean life. NYU has provided the sophomore with free housing at a residence hall
for the rest of the semester but has not guaranteed anything for the future.
Stanzak, who does not receive financial assistance from
his parents, works four jobs but can only secure enough in
loans to barely cover tuition.
"My loans weren't approved with housing included," he
said. "But when I dropped $15,000 in housing out of it, it
worked." The result: Stanzak could finance his education
but was left without a place to live. He then had an
epiphany that would reshape his NYU experience
he
would live in the library.
Sleeping on a makeshift bed of three chairs pushed
together, he experienced the fear of a nighttime eviction.
"Every time I heard footsteps at night, I thought it was a
guard coming to wake me up," he said.
Ironically, the man who resided in the school's prime
studying locale could not focus there. "I can't concentrate

in Bobst because I've become so comfortable there," he
"If I have a lot of studying to do, I'll go to
McDonald's."
Stanzak found a "stress release" in an unlikely place: He

began a Live Journal Weblog at homelessatnyu.com and
quickly attracted

a fanbase.

But when University Spokesman John Beckman stumbled upon the Weblog, Stanzak was made to meet with
NYU deans Richard Kalb and Willie Long, who gave him

free housing for the rest of the semester.
Stanzak enjoys his new room."I have showered three
days in a row, and it's been really amazing," he said.
"I kind of miss the library," he said. "I've gone from
something completely fucked up to something completely
normal, and I'm still coping with that... You live anywhere
for eight months and you'll get an attachment to it," he
said.
Right now, Stanzak is awaiting his new financial aid
package, nursing the hope that NYU will be able to assist
him with housing next year.

vegetarian and semi-vege- i^^^^™l^™l^^™™'''"""lll ll
tarian restaurants, and we
had a hard time choosing which places to review. We eventually settled on Essene Natural Food Market and Cafe,
near South Street; Govinda's Cafe, also on South Street;
and Kingdom of Vegetarians, in Chinatown.
If you're allergic to yoga, be-ins and aging hippies, then
Essene is going to give you a full-body rash. (Isn't that
appetizing?) It's a large natural-food store near Fourth and
South Streets that offers ready-made vegan sandwiches
and desserts, organic groceries, cooking and meditation
classes, and a buffet featuring mostly vegetarian dishes
with a few fish items. The buffet is $6.99 per pound, which
isn't cheap, but the wide range of offerings almost justifies
the price.
I loaded up a plate with Moroccan-style seitan kebabs,
artichoke and white bean gratin, spring vegetable stew,
portabella mushroom polenta, a baked spring roll, and a
salad of soba noodles with spinach and feta cheese. The
"

kebabs were quite good, although a bit salty, and the gratin
was pleasantly flavored. The soba noodle salad was odd but
still decent. As for the baked spring roll, well, some things
are just meant to be deep-fried. I wouldn't go out of my way
to go back to Essene, but if you're on that end of South
Street, it's worth a try.
Govinda's Cafe, on the other hand, definitely merits a
special trip. It's a small cafe and gallery 10 blocks away

Ben says:

I have to admit, I have an ambiguous relationship to
vegetarian "meat." At its best, the stuff has more texture
and taste than tofu, but it's still nothing like the genuine
article. I always assumed fake meat was yet another
spongy, pasty soy product that no one actually likes, but
that people who wear a lot of hemp products insist is delicious in order to make you feel guilty over your cheeseburger. As it turns out, veggie meat, just like anything
else, is only as good or bad as the chef preparing it, and

in the case of Govinda's, that made it delicious. The
"chicken" steaks at Govinda's really were amazing,
fresh, peppery and juicy. They're also huge. The second
half of my sandwich made for a great 4 a.m. paper-writing

break.

Even with Govinda's under my belt, I was skeptical
about eating at a Chinatown restaurant called Kingdom
of Vegetarians. The name perfectly described my vision
of the apocalypse. By the time I left, however, I felt very
reassured and very full. Meat or no meat, the food at

the message. The most expensive dish is $12.95, and most
are much cheaper, around six or seven bucks.
Our first course was delicious. My meatless wonton
soup was better than most pork-ified versions of the dish
I've had, and the steamed bean curd skin rolls were tender and in a tasty sweet sauce. Only Sarah's "shrimp"

dumplings were underwhelming. Our main dishes were
a treat. The "beef" with scallions was sweet and quite flavorful, without any of the flavors overpowering each
other. The lemon "chicken" was crispy and moist and
never even got soggy in its sauce, partially because we
devoured it.

Ben and Sarah say:
We'd like to thank the people who have come up to us
to say that they tried out the places we reviewed or that
they enjoyed the column this year, particularly those
five of you who are not our direct blood relations. We'll
be gone next year, but remember, there's life beyond
Cheng Hing!

K.O.V. is fantastic.

According to previous Philly reviewers, the restaurant owns some mysterious device into which they put
things with names like "gluten" and which then produces vegetarian meat. The meat itself doesn't always

resemble its namesake, but it sometimes comes close,
and in all cases the result is surprisingly flavorful. The
menu is, as you might expect in Chinatown, very large
and very cheap. It lists 35 dim sum dishes, 14 soups and
112 main dishes, grouped into the usual categories of
beef, pork, seafood, etc., with the word "imitation" in
parentheses next to the headings, in case you didn't get

character. Chan has spent the year in her
studio getting to know the Blob, and each of
her works builds on their past together and
develops their relationship further.
Chan admits the Blob is partly a selfportrait "through a filter." But the cartoon
also frees her from herself. Many of the
details of the Blob's life are ambiguous to
both artist and viewer. Chan is always trying out new media in order to lessen her
control over her artistic production and
leave room for surprise. A new medium
produces new effects and new ideas-. It
gives the Blob a life of its own. Motifs take
on new meanings within different contexts,
and the Blob becomes a dynamic, multidimensional character in each new medium. Chan thrives on this kind of uncertainty because it leaves room for participation and reinterpretation.

battered body. Sometimes she takes
herself seriously, and sometimes
she just plays around. Her art is her
way of life.

In this show, it feels like Chan
allows us inside her brain.
Constantly changing and open to

new chapters, totally subjective
and never authoritarian, Chan's

art is also clever and thought-provoking. She said it perfectly: "If it's
not egomaniacal, then it's less
meaningful. If my work is more

confused, than that's more honest.
I want to maintain that confusion.
Don't let people tell you what to
think. Figure out what is your
stake in it."

Chan's work is neurotically selfengrossed. She processes and reprocesses

her issues and ideas

The

upcoming exhibit of art major Audrey Chan 'O4
loosely narrates the life and death of her cartoon character, the Blob. Experimenting with clay, embroidery, collage, paint and pens to create an ever-evolving story, the
exhibit includes a variety of media. A few obsessively
worked motifs soldiers, the lotus flower, swarms of flies,
pigeons and the Blob herself
give the viewer a glimpse
into the playful but weirdly preoccupied world of the

artist.

Before you go, pull out a few old Phoenix issues and read
a few of Chan's cartoons about the Blob. You'll make the

Drama and energy

Brandon

Estrella 'O4 is a masterful painter.
His oils streak thickly across his canvases, his brushstroke moves with confidence
and animation, his colors complement each
other and his compositions pulse with energy. Estrella's favored motifs
clouds, landscapes, solitary figures, cats and windows
are emotionally-loaded imagery. His dream-

like images and expressive brushwork
romance us into wistful reveries.
Estrella is also a drummer and a psychology major. Both of these interests, he said,

are integrally wrapped up in his artwork.
When he paints, he thinks about representing rhythms and moods. Whether depicting a
landscape or an abstraction, his work evokes
feelings and chain reactions of associations
in his viewers. It's admirable, because it
allows viewers the freedom to feel lonely,
despondent, excited, peaceful or any of a
whole range of emotions.

\

|

Thick brushstrokes and embel-

lished colors heavily charge both his
landscapes and his abstracts. His

fluid movement between figuration
and abstraction keeps us from pinning down meaning or narrative in
his work. Altogether, his paintings
have the tantalizing impenetrability
of a dream sequence, and an eerie
resemblance to a forgotten memory
or lost emotion.
The paintings are dramatic, but,

unlike a Hollywood film, they are
never manipulative. He plays with
violence of line, contrast in colors,
and the associations within his
motifs in order to see what effects

they produce.
Wandering through his paintings,
you'll find at least one that's cathartic for you.

Hours for both shows are Friday through Sunday, 12-5 p.m.
Openings are Fridays, $-"6.0.111.

Room Contest

An explosion of color in first place
The winning room: Mertz 310

When the New Dorm construction noise in Mertz became intolerable, Mindy Reiser 'O7 was left without a roommate. Reiser
herself
stuck it out, however, and her
reward has been the cozy and private haven she created just a few
yards away from the bulldozers. The
double, full ofodd corners and natural light, features strands of specialty lighting, rich fabrics hanging
from the ceiling and a mosquito net
around her bed.
From her roommate's old bed
Reiser built a lounge space for visiting and reading, filled with pillows
and blankets in warm colors. One
whole wall is filled with postcards
from around the world, collected
over the years from friends and
travels. And then there's the tree
with a peculiar history.
Every

day

throughout

high

school, she took individual leaves
from the plastic tree and gave them
to friends. Finally her friend dared
her to take the entire tree. She and
her friends valiantly freed the tree
from the chains that bound it to
their high school cafeteria. Now in
Reiser's dorm room, it stands guard
over a pair of bright red shoes, just
below a child's rainbow umbrella
hung from the ceiling.

So it is in the Mary Lyon triple, otherwise known as "The

and Lisa Nelson (or "LL Cool J," as they call themselves). The
walls are thoughtfully decorated, as is the floor.
The room is, of course, filled with typical college student
accoutrement: clean and dirty clothes, soda bottles, trinkets
and papers fluttering in the breeze. A thin path leads to the
three beds and desks, and to the row of three closets that do
actually close.
The high ceilings, charming old fireplace and tapestry-covered windows impart an easy-come, easy-go feel to the mess. No
wonder it's a popular meeting place for their friends.

Dear Carrie,
We appreciate your lucrative HBO offer, but we fear we may

a neat conclusion: Waistlines don't matter if you don't have a waist.

Dear Stylistic Devices,
I was deeply offended by your April 1 column, in which you
denounced scrunchies as a dated and unfashionable accessory. I
am the proud owner of over 623 scrunchies in various colors and

regarding these items. How should I tell my lover that I can only

The artist and his muse, Jocelyn Braddock, held an
intimate dinner party last week that captured the

arrived, Braddock was still in the kitchen wearing
shorts and an oversized T-shirt
and stilettos.
Altuzarra was his gorgeous self as always. He possesses a charming combination of urbane Parisian
sang froid and hip New York impudence. Together,
Altuzarra and Braddock make a captivating pair.

With her and his other models in mind, Altuzarra
has combined the low waistlines and flapper attitude of the Roaring '2os with the feminine flounces
and demure seductiveness of 'sos Balenciaga to
create his own distinctly modern feminine style.
Altuzarra's designs have always relished in
luxuriance, frivolity and drama. This fall, he seasons his sophistication with exotic and untamed
eroticism. It's Audrey Hepburn on safari, Tarzan
meets Jackie O. and Balenciaga gone Kabuki.

Spec problems
Probably the most important and most useful aspect
of a prospective student's visit to our college is the
opportunity to sit in on classes. The quality of our
classroom education, after all, ought to be the central
factor in a high school senior's decision to come here,
and no secondhand sources are as useful as firsthand
experience for students to judge how well they fit with
Swarthmore-style learning. It's a good thing, then, that
more students are coming here to take advantage of
such opportunities, and that the rescheduling of Ride
the Tide to take place during the week rather than over
the weekend has provided a broader range of classes
for them to visit.
But the expansion in scale of classroom visits doesn't appear to have come with an expanded scale of
organization and control. With the sheer number of
prospectives, over 800, wandering campus during the
day, there should have been systems in place to make
sure they used their time in ways most beneficial to
themselves and least disruptive to the campus.
All professors, for example, should have been given
a chance to clearly grant or deny prospective students
permission to visit their classrooms at a particular
date and time. Prospective students should have been
clearly instructed not to feel free to wander into and
out of classrooms while class is in session. They should
have been kept away from class sessions inappropriate
for observation, such as high-level seminars, which,
especially at this time of year, are often extremely
stressful, having to go through a fairly dense amount of
material before examinations.
Prospective students not only showed up at such
events but also turned up at classrooms where end-ofyear celebrations were being held, where advanced
language drill sessions were going on and even where
tests were being taken. We find it unlikely that specs
would benefit greatly from taking refreshments from
seminar breaks, from listening to people converse in
languages they don't understand or from staring at
students filling out blue books. For their sake and ours,
they should have been given a short list of classes most
worth their time to observe and kept out of the others.
We understand that the scope of the admissions
office's work has increased over the past few years and
that organizing this year's Ride the Tide was very challenging for all involved. Nonetheless, we should learn
from both the successes and failures of this year's
events. While most of us love to see specs enjoying and
learning about our campus, there were many burdens
students had to shoulder for Ride the Tide, of which
disruption of classes was the most egregious.
Alleviating this problem ought to be the admissions
office's first priority for next year.

Political one-sidedness tarnishes graduation
BY CARLA GREENBERG

cgreenbl@swarthmore.edu

At last year's graduation, President Bloom began his

speech by recognizing the historic year in which the class of
2003 was graduating, just under two months after American
soldiers had toppled the statue ofSaddam Hussein. He called
on Swarthmore students to critically evaluate the actions
taken by America as an international leader. While it began
in a general manner, the rest of his speech indicated
President Bloom's expectation that all of the graduates
would evaluate world events from a similar perspective. He
emphasized this by saying, "I know that you will employ

these habits ofmind because of who you are and of what it
means to have been educated here."

Two points in the speech specifically demonstrated
President Bloom's political positions.
"If you see this nation beginning to underestimate the
extent to which its own well-being is linked to that of others," President Bloom said, "I ask you to help America focus
more clearly on the risks entailed by not giving collaborative approaches every chance." This indicated his presumption that all of the graduates believed that the U.S. government has the responsibility or even the right to act for the
benefit or at the behest of anyone other than its citizens.
"If you see America so persuaded by its own success," he
said, "that it begins to assume that its preference for politi-

gang-like majority) can be considered on par with or can
even trump political freedoms.
It's as close as you get to an official admission that a
Swarthmore education attempts to indoctrinate us with a
specific (left-leaning) ideology.
Had President Bloom presented this speech at almost any
other college event, I would not have objected to it. I would
have disagreed, but I would not have experienced the disappointment I felt that day. Had he charged the senior class to
examine the United States' global role in a way that did not
entail a specific political view, I would not have felt this way.
But to face the "mainstream" viewpoint of Swarthmore on
that day was inappropriate and disparaging of the personal
achievements of the 350-plus individuals who gathered to
celebrate the fulfillment of their discrete objectives.
President Bloom, if you read this, consider the diversity
you and the college so highly praise. Please take into
account that there will be students graduating this May who
would prefer, on that momentous occasion, not to be presented with further confirmation that Swarthmore is a

monolith of one particular ideology.

out that little tidbit about the
massive radical unions of the
1900s.
This school has an ideology that it wants us to follow. It is
an ideology informed by liberal, white, upper-class guilt. This
ideology permeates the classes, the readings, the activist
groups and the school newspaper. It is manifested in a continuous drone, echoing from the Clothier Bell Tower to Parrish
Dome. It says, "The only way to change things is to buy into the
system."
I will not argue here that working through the system is
futile. But to say that it is the only way to do things is to ignore
history, and as Howard Zinn writes, "If you forget history you

will believe anything." Especially if the ideology of an institution of "higher learning" is eagerly awaiting its turn to occupy
your skull and turn you into an endowment-generating alumni.
This Saturday will be a day to remember the history of the
power of direct action and revolutionary work outside the narrowly defined realm of "legitimate politics." May 1 is internationally recognized as

a day of celebration of the struggle of the

working class everywhere. International Workers' Day is officially recognized in nearly every country in the world except
for the United States and Canada. Here, the first of May is
marked "Loyalty Day."
Yippee. We have also been given Labor Day
originally as
a concession to the demands of unions but it marks the day
that kids return to school more than anything else, and is certainly not a celebration of the defeat of big business by the big

unions.
It is incredible that the United States refuses to recognize
May Day since the significance of the holiday originated here
in the 1880s during the eight-hour-day movement. In 1884, the
Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions made a
decree that "eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labor
from and after May 1, 1886." The group, in conjunction with
thousands of anarchist labor unionists, called for a general
strike to ensure that their demands would be met. In the two
years that followed, support for the eight-hour-day movement
swelled to the point that over 340,000 workers were involved.
The first ever May Day celebration occurred in 1886 when over
300,000 workers in 13,000 business across the U.S. walked off
their jobs to demand an eight-hour-day. The prospect of a general strike was so frightening to the ruling class that business
actually purchased arms for the police to use against strikers.
The violence that ensued led to the Haymarket Affair, which

our history books occasionally glance over.
August Spies, one of the Haymarket martyrs, wrote in the

Arbeiter-Zeitung, "the first of May, whose historical significance will be understood and appreciated only in later years is
here." I wish that Spies were correct, and that the memory of
the police firing machine guns into crowds of striking workers
had not been lost to the wind, but May Day is just a few days
away and even our admittedly "liberal" institution seems to be
entirely oblivious. The work of radical social movements has
come to be taken for granted. Things as basic to our existence
as the weekend, the forty-hour work week and minimum wage
were all fought for and won not with the rhetoric of politicians
in nice suits but with the blood and courage of radical unions,
anarchists and revolutionaries who have been all but forgotten,

even within the halls ofSwarthmore.

I'm not saying this place is trying to brainwash you; I'm sayhas an ideology. If you
ing that it like any other institution
are interested in finding the truth, it is absolutely necessary
that you be acutely aware of that ideology and its impact on the
campus and the classroom. Accept no ideology, especially not
mine, even once you have questioned it to death. Rather, have
the courage to build your own ideology, fill the gaps in the history that has been presented and seek change by whichever
means seems most effective at the time.

and dialogue. Our university ain't the institu-

tion connoted by the
modern "university." It

is

the

denoted

corporation
the
by

medieval "university."
Our Pan-African university, at bottom, is about men and their books.
Etymologically, "university" is synonymous with

"corporation" or "guild." Originally, there were uni-

versities of barbers and carpenters as well as scholars.
The point is that "university" denotes a group of people, not universal learning, although scholars did
eventually monopolize the term. In his classic "The
Rise of Universities," Charles Homer Haskins variously defines "university" as 1) an academic guild organized as a means of protection against local townspeople
and professors, with the threat of secession against the
one, the threat of collective boycott against the other,
respectively, and 2) an association of masters and
scholars leading the common life of learning. Our PanAfrican university is modeled after this humanist cor-

poration of the old school, as opposed to the dehumanized institution of the new school as measured by the

utilitarian scale of "U.S. News World Report."
Just as John Doe is not to be confused with whatever estates, cars or stocks he might own, our PanAfrican university is not to be confused with whatever
libraries, laboratories or billion-dollar endowments we
might come to possess. To identify John Doe with his
properties and possessions is to dehumanize him.
Likewise, to identify the members of the university
with their properties and possessions is to dehumanize
them.
Our masters and scholars are committed to inquiry
and dialogue. When the interlocutors of our class discussion are few, we use the Socratic method. When we
are many, we engage in parliamentary debate as prescribed by "Robert's Rules of Order." Either way, our
professors are facilitators of dialogue. We question.
Sophistic professors lecture. They dictate to masses of
clerks who dutifully take notes. We dialogue. They, as
talking heads of the ivory tower orthodoxy, monologue. Our professors and students are interlocutors of
&

letter

to

the Socratic old school, but the professors and students
of the sophistic new school are dictators and stenographers. They indoctrinate and institutionalize. We educate and civilize.
The problem of human civilization comes down to
virtue and justice. How does the individual achieve
virtue? How does the society achieve justice? How do
we get adequate food, shelter and clothing, not to mention health care, to everybody? Generally speaking,
these are the fundamental questions that the humanities, as disciplined inquiries which explore human values, reckon with. More specifically, black studies,
white studies and Asian studies are the three types of
humanities that inquire into the problems of virtue
and justice as they pertain to Pan-African, PanEuropean and Pan-Asian civilization, respectively.

The natural sciences, which deal with organisms,

inanimate objects and mathematics, are disciplined
inquiries that explore the quantities and subtleties of

cause and effect. Soviet scholars under Stalin made
fools of themselves by dismissing Einstein's theory of
relativity as a "bourgeois theory." As Garveyite scholars, let's not make fools of ourselves. The calculus
invented simultaneously by both Newton and Leibniz
is not a "white man's theory." The ancient Greeks
made a civilization out of reverse-engineering
Egyptian science and technology, the epitome of which
is Euclid's "Elements." The modern African, wherever
he finds himself in the world, must likewise reverseengineer Western science and technology. Our witch
doctors steeped in magic and superstition must

become witch doctors in command of technology and
capitalism. They must master Aristotle's deductive
the syllogism
logic as well as Bacon's inductive logic
and the experiment. I say again that they are not
white-man methods of thought but are rather everyman methods of thought. Our humanities, based on
African values, are primarily black studies. But the
natural sciences, value neutral, are everyman studies.
During the 12th century, the archetypal universities
were formed at Paris and Bologna. Each university
thereafter was divided into several European
"nations." Thus Paris, Bologna and the rest were truly
Pan-European universities, cosmopolitan to the core.
From the 12th century up to the French Revolution and
Napoleon, most of the universities of Europe were
composed of these nations. Our Pan-African universi-

ties of Africa proper and all around the world should
likewise be comprised of African nations and tribes.
Unlike most of the so-called "historically black colleges" which have been historically white colleges
filled with black people, our Pan-African universities,
truly Afrocentric, shall comprehend and solve the
problems of Pan-African civilization. Knowledge is
black power.

Kudos on blood drive successes
Dear Editor:
Congratulations to the college on
the success of your truly outstanding
2003-2004 blood collection campaign.
Over the past year, Swarthmore collected 269 donations, a 45 percent
increase over last year. At a time
when blood supplies are low across
the country, this is an incredibly
valuable contribution to life-saving
efforts in our area.
As
of

a
1982

my alma mater has once again
showed it is a community of people

who care and take action.
I am also the dad of twins who
were born 11 weeks prematurely and
needed several blood transfusions
during the three months they spent
at the Crozer-Chester Medical
Center. Janet and Jared were just
two pounds each at birth and needed
a lot of help. But no medical miracle
April 29, 2004

was able to replace the gift of life-saving blood that could only come from
a generous donor like you.
Fortunately, one donor spent about
an hour and donated a single pint of
blood that was used to save their

lives several times. Nine years later,
Janet and Jared are happy and

healthy third graders and are a wonderful brother and sister to their lit-

tle sisters Katherine and Amanda.
My wife Kristen and I are eternally
grateful to everyone who played a
role in giving them the gift of life.
Swarthmore is lucky to have Al

Bloom and Maurice Eldridge who
accepted the challenge brought to
them last summer by the American
Red Cross and worked to engage the
Swarthmore community in two spectacular blood drives. Under their
guidance,

faculty

donations

increased by 63 percent over last
year and student donations were up

35 percent. Swarthmore's blood
donation program is now a model for
other colleges and universities in the
Philadelphia area.
To the graduating seniors, I congratulate you. I've been there; I share
your joy; I know what you have been
through. As you move beyond the
blooming borders of the Swarthmore
campus to change the corner of the
world you settle in, you will bring
much of the knowledge and experiences from your time here. I ask you
to bring one more thing with you, the
knowledge that one person can save
once
in about an hour
a life
every eight weeks. Make being a
blood donor one of the important
pieces of the spectacular adult you
are becoming. You will always make
a difference.

Columnist misjudges intentions of video
Dear Editor:
In his column in the April 22
Phoenix ("Don't Water Us Down,"
pg. 16) Evan Hensleigh reveals a
troubling degree of misunderstanding of the film project the administration is pursuing to help intro-

to

duce prospective students
Swarthmore.
Hensleigh writes that the administration is counting on the film to
"convince
students
that
Swarthmore isn't as intense as it's
cracked up to be." As those of us
working on the film have stated on
several occasions, we have no

desire to shrink away from the reality that Swarthmore is an intense
experience. Actually, we aim to

embrace intensity and its many different aspects. Through our students' own words and actions, the
film demonstrates that the hard
work is a central part of a fulfilling,
rounded Swarthmore experience,
and that our students pursue
extracurricular activities, social
action, friendships and
yes

parties, in addition to the academic
work. In the words of one student
we filmed, "Intensity is what you

make it."

The film consists solely of material gathered by crews that shadowed a half-dozen students over
three days, augmented by two-dozen
"self-interviews" in which students
sat alone with a camera in the
Parrish dome and talked about their
experiences, without a script and
without any rehearsing. I invite
Hensleigh and all Phoenix readers
to view the results of the latter
the "Swarthmore Unscripted" feature that is available on the front
page of the college Web site.

In defense of the editor's role
Dear Editor:
In its April 22 edition, The Phoenix published a letter
written by four Swarthmore students and two recent
alumnae ("Questioning Phoenix's ideology," pg. 15). It
protested what they claimed was the unfair treatment of
the columnist Taru Taylor by the Phoenix editorial board.
The Phoenix editors had recently been in correspondence
with Taylor and had conveyed to him concerns about the
style ofhis writing for the newspaper. Their concern was
that Taylor's column was written in a verbose style that
they felt did not present Taylor's ideas in a clear context.
The editors wanted to find a way to preserve the integrity of Taylor's opinions while at the same time making
them as clear as possible to The Phoenix's readership and
hopefully giving them greater impact.
They were doing, in other words, what editors are supposed to do.
Rather than recognizing the editors' concerns as constructive criticism, the authors of the letter in support of
Taylor took this to be a personal attack, a politically
motivated slight against Taylor's Pan-Africanist ideology.
The Phoenix, they claimed, was participating in a "white
male patriarchal discourse" and that "Taylor's voice is a
welcome challenge to the hegemony which The Phoenix
serves." They cited the Phoenix's publication of Randy
Goldstein's conservative opinions column as incontroTHE PHOENIX

vertible proof of political bias on the part of the editorial
board. They claimed, as Taylor himself did in an e-mail to
the board and every Phoenix opinion columnist, that the
editors' intention was to compel Taylor to "conform to an
orthodoxy."

As a Phoenix reader and columnist I am compelled to
wonder how they could so spectacularly miss the point. If
Goldstein's column indicates a conservative editorial bias
at The Phoenix, then by that same logic the board must at
the same time be extremely liberal, as they regularly
print Maya Schenwar's column. Presumably they must
also be devotedly Pan-Africanist, since, as of this writing,
they continue to publish Taylor's work and seem to have
no intent to do otherwise.
Politics are simply not at issue here. The Phoenix as
an organization has no stated or covert editorial agenda
beyond the production of an informative newspaper. To
do so requires the editors to offer what they feel is insightful and constructive criticism to their writers and for the
writers to respond in a similarly thoughtful manner. For
Taylor's supporters to make frivolous claims of political
or racial discrimination on the basis of such a routine
process trivializes the grave seriousness that those allegations carry, particularly on such a close-knit campus as
Swarthmore's.

choice views, it is important to understand the evolution of
the Catholic Church since Kennedy's election. From 1962 until
1965, the Church held the Second Vatican Council, which
reformed many aspects of the liturgy and encouraged a
greater lay role in the workings of the Church. Vatican II was
a notable step forward, but the Church it produced has left
neither conservative nor liberal Catholics happy, at least in

America. Conservatives complain that laypeople, and even
local parish priests, routinely ignore the Vatican's teachings,
particularly on matters of sexual morality. (American
Catholics use contraceptives, for instance, at close to the same
rate that non-Catholics do.)
Liberals, for their part, feel Vatican II promised a more
egalitarian and inclusive Church that never really came to be.
Not only did the Church reaffirm its anti-birth control stance
in 1968, but also, 10 years later, John Paul II became Pope.
John Paul has been a strong and unfailing voice for world

peace and social justice, but to Catholic liberals' dismay, he
has also been a strong and unfailing voice against any change
in the Church's strict sexual ethic, refusing to consider the
prospects offemale priests, married priests or a relaxation on

the birth control ban. Liberal Catholics also complain thatthe
Church has remained too rigid and hierarchical.
The recent sexual abuse crisis left everyone in the Church
angry and each side of the ideological divide pointing fingers
at the other. The crisis has heightened the belief on all sides
that the Catholic Church must change, though whether in a
progressive or a traditionalist direction is up for grabs. Into
this charged environment comes Kerry, a liberal Catholic
who, when in Boston, worships at the Paulist Center, a
church where my family worshipped when we lived in
Boston. The Paulist Center is a liberal Catholic church if
there ever was one. It has an intense focus on social justice
efforts and was one of the first Catholic churches to start a
group for divorced Catholics.
One might think the conservative hierarchy would prefer
not to have churches like the Paulist Center defy official
teaching or a pro-choice Catholic like Kerry receive
Communion. Indeed, some Catholic leaders, such as Nigeria's
Cardinal Francis Arinze, a potential future Pope, have hinted
that Kerry ought not to receive the Eucharist. The basis for
such a denial would be the Catholic teaching that anyone in a
state of grave sin should not receive Communion.
No doubt some American bishops feel Kerry ought to be
denied Communion, but they also know a more hard-line policy would probably alienate many liberal Catholics, who
make up a substantial portion of the American Catholic population. If a bishop does decide to deny Kerry the Eucharist,
it will be unfortunate but perhaps good for the Church in the
long run. Right now, the American Catholic hierarchy and
laypeople are locked in an uneasy truce, each wishing it could
push the other a little more. A break in that truce would be
jarring, but if it produced serious, respectful dialogue about

Four years
of change
Little has changed over the last four years, or has
it? I came to Swarthmore a Republican and, shockingly, I'm leaving an even stronger one. Listening to
the hundreds and hundreds of liberals around this
place argue their viewpoints on anything from the
living wage to the
War on Terror has
only intensified my

own views, and I am
thankful I cannot be
labeled, unlike John
Kerry and everybody
in the Swarthmore
administration, with
the dreaded L word. I
am a strong supporter
of President Bush and
am proud to admit as
much.
When I came to
Swarthmore, the footCARLTON DAVIS
ball team was on the
up and up, going 4-5
Rounding
my first year. Now
there is no football
team, much to the dismay of nearly all the seniors on campus and tens of
thousands of alumni who disagreed with the decision. But there is good news for all you football
lovers, as well as others who are displeased with the
direction in which Swarthmore is headed. Many
Swarthmore students are making an aggressive push
to see Al Bloom out the door, and it is unclear
whether the Board of Managers will follow the students' sentiments at the conclusion of the current
capital campaign. (Speaking of which, how come my
tuition has increased even though hundreds of millions of new dollars are flowing into the school?)
Think of the joy Mike Tyson must have had after he
annihilated Trevor Berbick in 1986 to become the
youngest heavyweight champion ever. That same joy
will be shared by most everyone in the Swarthmore
community with the departure of Bloom.
During my four years here wrestling was also cut
as a varsity sport, and badminton went from whatever it was before I got here to an on-the-radar event
that people now know actually exists. More importantly, the athletic department has been revamped.
Bob Williams is no longer AD. The man was unable
to make any decisions, was a puppet of Al Bloom's
and rarely showed up to any sporting event.
Replacing him was Adam Hertz, a charismatic
father of two who can be seen at every home game,
interacts with players on a daily basis, has committed the school to fielding more competitive teams
and actually understands the concerns of studentathletes. So a big thanks to Adam for everything
that he has done so far during his short time here,
including getting dugouts for the baseball and softball fields, a great new track and a first-class turf
field.
The last four years have also seen an increase in
the attractiveness of the sports medicine department. The help around Marie this year has been
dynamite compared to years past. Though Rob Roche
is married and off the market, Colleen is a looker,
and Angie Heckler, the trainer for basketball and
baseball, is incredibly attractive. So a big thanks to
Marie for helping out athletes like me in making our
training room experiences more frequent and exciting this year.
Four years ago the dynamic duo on campus was
Dave and Ray down at the cage. Broken up this year
with the retirement of Dave Lester after four decades
of service here at the college, Larry Yannelli has
admirably filled the shoes of somebody near impossible to replace.
This columnist has seen many changes for the better during his four years at Swarthmore. I can only
hope that such a trend continues in the coming years.

Men's lacrosse falls to Diplomats

aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The men's lacrosse team
fell 12-6 to Franklin and
Marshall last Saturday in
Lancaster, moving to 5-8 on
the season and 2-4 in the
Centennial Conference.
The Garnet Tide hung
with the Diplomats all the
way into the final quarter,

when the Dips managed to
blow open the one-goal
game
and notch five

straight unanswered goals
on Swarthmore's defense to
put the game away. Tim
Chryssikos 'O5 paced the
Garnet offense with a hat
trick, while Joe DeSimone
'O4, Tommy Coughlin 'O5
and Ryan McKenna 'O7

added goals of their own to

Swarthmore.
"We just made a couple
of key mistakes," McKenna
said. "We had a failed clear
which led to a goal, and then
a missed ground ball which
also led to a goal, and that
was basically the end of the

game. We just couldn't put
any offense together in the
fourth."
Steven Isbister 'O4 put
forth a solid effort in the
net, stopping 12 shots on the
day for the Tide.
Swarthmore held off
against Muhlenberg last

Wednesday,

demolishing

the Mules 12-3 on Clothier
Field in its second conference victory of the season.
Chryssikos, McKenna, John
Cleaver 'O4 and Jeff Donlea

the day to lead the offense
for the Tide.
"We were coming off a
tough loss and we were really focused on executing our

really ran everything well
and did what we wanted to

Women's lax struggles to end season
BY MATT SCHILLER
mschilll@swarthmore.edu
Garnet women's lacrosse rounded
out the season by continuing to beat up

on non-conference opponents while
against
Centennial
Conference rivals. They have lost three
struggling

conference games in the last 10 days,
finishing play with a five-game conference losing streak. The lone bright spot
for Swarthmore (8-8, 2-7 CC) was a victory over Rosemont April 2L
The Tide took on the Diplomats of

Franklin and Marshall at home April
20. The Dips made short work of
Swarthmore, shutting the women out
15-0. The game marked the first time a
Garnet women's lacrosse team had
failed to get on the scoreboard since
1990, when they feU to Wellesley 13-0.
Co-captain Jackie Kahn 'O4 saw her 33game scoring streak come to an end.
The Garnet were only able to muster a
season-low 15 shots. In goal, Jenn Hart
'O4 recorded 12 saves to keep the game
from getting even more out of hand.
But the Garnet had little time to
dwell on the loss, with another home
match the next evening against
Rosemont. Kahn quickly got a new
scoring streak underway, tallying her
first goal just four minutes into the
match. Rosemont responded with two
goals of its own to gain a 2-1 advantage.
With a potential fourth straight loss
looming, Swarthmore came roaring
back to score the next eight goals of
the game and took an 11-4 lead into the
half. After the break, the offensive
onslaught continued, led by Kahn, who

April 29, 2004

notched five goals in the second half to
lead the Garnet to a 17-7 win.
"I'm really proud of the way they've
bounced back from some tough losses
to put together some great wins,"
coach Karen Borbee said.
Lindsey Roth 'O7 had three goals
and an assist, and Megan Speare 'O5
added a hat trick of her own. Hart
turned aside 14 shots in a solid performance. Kahn totaled a career-high

eight goals on the night, the highest
scoring output of any conference play-

er this season.
On Saturday, Swarthmore paid a
visit to McDaniel, but the Garnet's success in the last game did not carry
over to conference play. The tenacious
Green Terror took the game 18-9.
"We have been playing very good
lacrosse for the majority of each

game," Borbee said. "We just haven't
been able to put a full 60 minutes of lax
together yet."
Heidi Fieselmann 'O6, Ele Forbes 'O5

and Roth provided the offense for the
Garnet, each scoring a pair of goals.
Kahn also added a goal and three assists
in the losing effort. Hart stood strong in
net, stopping 19 shots, but she could not
stop the potent McDaniel offense.
With the Garnet out of the playoff

picture, they went on the road to take
on Haverford in a grudge match to
determine who would take sole posses-

sion of seventh place in the conference.
They beat the Fords out of the gates,
taking a healthy 7-3 lead into halftime.
"The first half was definitely one of
the best halves of lacrosse we've ever
played," Hart said. "It was the first

time, recently, where everything has
gone well offensively and defensively."
In the second half, the lead grew to
8-3 before Swarthmore's offense stalled
and Haverford mounted a comeback.
Haverford cut the lead to 9-8 with just
over eight minutes remaining. They
tied the game as the clock ran down to
five minutes and then put in the goahead goal 30 seconds later. The
Garnet struggled in the final minutes
and failed to score, finally falling 10-9
in a heartbreaker.
"We broke down at times, and when
they started to come back we didn't
really respond as well as we could
have," Cara Tigue 'O6 said.

Hart finished off her season with a

15-save performance to total 569 in her
career. She sits third on the all-time
save list for Swarthmore. Fieselmann
and Roth each netted a pair of goals,
and Kahn scored in her final match for
the Garnet. Kahn is seventh place alltime in the Swarthmore record books
with 146 career goals, 54 of which came
this year.
"This is a very talented team," Hart
said. "We were just unlucky in a lot of
games, and things didn't go our way.
But hopefully they'll be able to build
on that for next year."
"We've had a great season in that
each game we've gotten better, and

improved," Borbee
"They've been a wonderful group to
work with. I've enjoyed every minute
of the season. I think it's a credit to
them and their work ethic that they've
accomplished as much as they did this

At last, its timefor my final column. A sad moment for some,
undoubtedly a happy moment for others; for me it's a little bit of
both. I wanted to try my hand at sports opinion writing, and I
happen to think I did a pretty good (or at least decent) job at it.
So I'm pleased at the way it turned out, and while I like writing
for The Phoenix, I can't keep
doing it forever, so this is as good
a time to stop as any (seeing as
I'm graduating).
So for this last column, I'm
not gonna try to make any huge
points. No real big analysis into

any of the past week's minor
sports controversies. No, this column is gonna be a good old fashioned catch-all and summary. I'm
gonna call attention to a few
things I don't want to fall
through the cracks and then I'll
ride off into the sunset. What's

I need to congratulate, thank,
appreciate and acknowledge the softball team. I've been their
scorekeeper/manager/driver/errand boy for the past three
years, and I can honestly say I can't think of a campus job I
could possibly have enjoyed more. When I started three years
ago, I think we won two games. We weren't really a powerhouse. But to those of you who laugh at our two victories, realize this. They both came at Haverford. That's right, we swept
the Safety School, which, to be honest, not too many other
teams can claim.

Marianne Klingaman earned her sixth victory of the season in the 10-8 win over Widener.

Softball whips Widener to end season
BY COLTON BANGS

cbangsl@swarthmore.edu
In its final hurrah, the Garnet
softball team (10-22 overall, 3-13 CC)
closed out the season with a 10-8 victory over neighbor Widener. By cap-

turing the final game of the season,
the squad became the first Garnet
softball team to achieve double-digit
wins in a season in six years.
The Garnet offense, under the

leadership of Sam Brody 'O5, propelled the team to 10 runs, the second most the team has scored in a
single game all season. Brody
scored four runs on four hits to
overpower the Widener offense.
"We just came out to win, and
we didn't have any pressure on
us," Brody said. "I think when we
were in conference games we had
more pressure and today we just
came out to have fun on the last
game of the season."
Danielle Miller 'O6 was a major
factor in the win for the Garnet,
driving in five runs, hitting on
three offive plate appearances and
scoring two runs. Miller concurred
with Brody, citing the lack of pressure as the fire which ignited the
Garnet offense. "The pressure was
definitely off a little bit and we
really wanted to win 10 games on
the season," Miller said.
Marianne Klingaman 'O7 went
the distance for the Garnet, giving
up eight runs but pitching well
enough to come away with the victory. While she gave up ten hits,

she managed to strand nine runners and take down four hitters on
strikes. Widener ended their
THE PHOENIX

streak of scoreless innings at 10 in
a four-run fifth inning after the
Garnet jumped off to a 6-0 start.
The Tide loaded the bases in the
first and scored when Christina
Procacci 'O6 walked home Brody.
Klingaman then followed with a
single to score Miller. In the
fourth, Brody walked and was sent
to third on a single by Mary Mintel
'O5. Miller than ripped a double to
center field to pick up a pair of
RBl's. Val Marone 'O5 brought
home Miller with a double of her
own to conclude the 6-0 start. After
Widener scored four in the fifth,

the Garnet came back and picked

up another run. Myra Vallianos 'O5

singled and was replaced by
Stephanie Rogan 'O6, who scored
off another MiUer RBI. The Garnet
proceeded to add three more runs
in the sixth giving Klingaman a
six-run advantage at 10-4 when
they were going into the final
inning.
But Widener had not yet given
up and loaded the bases en route to
putting four runs on the board off
of two Swarthmore errors. A composed Klingaman was enough to
get the Garnet out of the inning
and escape

with the win. She
a ball hit back to her with
the bases loaded and threw to first
to get the final out. "Marianne
held the team together, especially
in the final inning," Miller said.
As Brody and Miller indicated,
the team was playing at a new level
without the pressure of conference
play. The Garnet offense strung
together hit after hit despite play-1
ing dismal defense.
grabbed

The next year we won a few more games and an influx of talented first-years brought hope for the future. This year, however, will go down as the year Swat softball turned it around. We
got a new coach, Renee Clarke, who injected a huge dose of
much-needed optimism and competitiveness. And this year, for
the first time in six years, we reached double digit wins. We had
nine going into Tuesday's game against Widener, and needing
one more to go, the bats came alive for 10 runs. We like to keep
things interesting, however, so we let Widener, think they were
coming back before slamming the door on a 10-7 victory. The
whole team deserves tons of praise for playing hard and keeping their heads up during a tough season, and they should all
be really, really proud of themselves. I'd like to mention everyone by name and talk about how awesome they are, but I'll just
mention that Marianne Klingaman pitched some outstanding
games down the stretch, pitching a shutout at Haverford and
holding McDaniel's potent offense to only one run. And I wanted to mention Christina Procacci, our catcher, who never gets
the recognition that she should for playing absolutely stellar
defense for every single inning of every single game in the most
demanding postion while still finding time to lead the team in
on-base percentage and the entire Centennial Conference in

"Simply put, we hit the ball
well. Our defense was all right, but
it wasn't stellar," Kelly Siano 'O7
said. "I think we strung a lot of hits

together. Their hits were kind of

scattered over the game. We consistently hit one after the other

which allowed us to score more
runs," Klingaman said.
Brody could not put her finger
on why the team had performed so
well offensively. "I think [our offensive ability] has been there before; it
just hasn't come together. I am surprised we haven't done well this
year. I think today was more indicative of how we can play, but as to
why it was today that we showed it,
I am not quite sure," she said.
Despite several slumps, the 2004
season was a step forward for
Garnet softball as evidenced by
reaching the double digit plateau in
wins . "I think the most positive
thing this season is that we did
have a long period where we didn't
play well, but we kept practicing
hard and we stayed positive and
were able to finish strong. The
most negative thing was just getting into that slump and not holding up well under the pressure of
the conference games," Klingaman
said.
"It was frustrating that we had
the talent, but it just didn't show
through," Brody said. "We got 10
wins, so that's very positive. We
have become a more legitimate
team this year."
"We're excited for next year
because no one is graduating so we
will be able to improve on where
we left off," Siano said.

I could go on forever about the softball team (and I gladly
will, if anybody cares to strike up a conversation with me) but
I promised coach Eric Wagner that I would put in some words
about physical education classes. This semester I took ultimate
Frisbee with him and had a blast. Yes, I needed it to graduate.
But my point is that it was a lot of fun, as was basketball the
semester before and badminton the semester before that. I want

to strongly encourage Swatties of all types to take advantage of
the PE classes here. If you are gonna be playing pickup ultimate or basketball, you might as well get some credit for it.
Even if you don't need the credit, at least peruse the gym class
listings during pre-reg time. Gym class is a really good way to
relax for a few hours a week, and obviously it keeps you physically fit and whatnot. So check out gym class, folks. You'll be
glad you did.

Reddy takes third Centennial Conference title
Senior Anjani Reddy finishes her conference career with 49-game win streak, top spot in tournament
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Anjani Reddy 'O4 has made her final

mark in conference athletic books. For the
third time in four years, the senior tennis
player stole the show at conference championships and came out on top with a 6-3, 64 win over Amy Schmidt of Muhlenberg.
Reddy did not compete in the the championships last year because she had to miss
the tournament to take medical school
entrance exams. Still, every year she participated in the tournament, she came in
first in the conference in singles play.
"Winning this tournament was really
special this year because of all the support
I have had throughout the season," Reddy
said. "Teammates, friends, classmates,
and professors have voiced encouragement and enthusiasm. That has made
this conference tournament even more

memorable."
Reddy is grateful for all the support she
has had. "I really think the support we
were given made a lot of difference, and I
appreciate the effort that so many people
have taken to come cheer and to encourage
all of us," she said. "I was really happy
with the showing our girls made this tournament."
The final singles match began on the
Faulker outdoor courts on Saturday at
noon. Reddy matched up against Schmidt.
After an early 4-2 lead by Reddy, the beginnings of a rainstorm forced the match
indoors. Schmidt earned another point to
come close to tying the score, but Reddy
lield Schmidt scoreless for the rest of the
game, finishing the job at 6-3.

"It was so hard to play

an opponent. At the same
time, I think we both tried to
make the most out of the
situation by enjoying

the first round of the tournament. If they
win, they will play the winner of the

"Even if we don't make it through, we've
done so many new and exciting things this
year that we set a strong precedent that
Swarthmore women's tennis will be a
strong program for many years to come,"
coach Jeremy Loomis said. "I'm very proud
of this team and we are really happy to represent Swarthmore in the nationals."
Of course, the team has their eye on
winning nationals, but they are not jumping to any conclusions. "We are still taking
it one match at a time," Celano said. "We
can't go in thinking we have it in the bag."
Still, the Tide shows no signs that it will
go into the tournament timidly.
"We are really looking forward to next
weekend," Reddy said. "I think we have a
great group of tough and determined girls,
and I think that will make all the difference. We are going into regionals prepared
and ready to win."
