Debaters invade campus today
This weekend Swarthmore will host a 53-team debate tournawith schools from both the east and the west coast attending.
The Swarthmore American Parlimentary Debate Association
tournament is geographically diverse and involves twenty-four
schools including Standford, Princeton, Columbia, and UVA.
The tournament, immediately filling its cap of 53 teams to necessitate a wait-list to attend, is held in conjunction with an
APDA meeting which all teams in APDA are welcome to attend.
Inundated with requests to attend the extravaganza, tournament directors Alecia Magnifico 'OO and Jeff Loesel 'Ol cited
the ADPA meeting as the reason for the usually high tournament attendance.
Swarthmore requested that all schools limit the number of
teams they bring to the tournament to a meager three teams, the
result of which is that schools can afford to bring only their
premier teams.
Many of the teams have fought their way to the final rounds
of previous APDA tournaments, making for a highly competitive tournament. The top ten teams will be recognized at the
closing awards ceremony along with the top ten individual speakers and novice speakers.

Irish leaders meet
Northern Ireland's two opposing politicians, Gerry Adams of
the I.R.A. political wing, Sinn Fein, and Protestant Unionist
leader David Trimble, agreed to talks this week after separate
meetings Wednesday with President Clinton.
The British government has set April 2, Good Friday, as the
deadline for a deal between the two. Trimble has consistently
refused to support Sinn Fein's (Free State-Gaelic) eligibility for
office before the IRA is disarmed; Adams claims that the IRA
will not disarm while his party is barred.
Another issue is the possibility that if the Sinn Fein is made
eligible, Trimble may be ousted as Ulster's Unionist leader, given
his shaky hold on Protestant opinion.
Hundreds of people have been slain in Northern Ireland by
dissidents trying to prevent the Good Friday accords.

MSU greek system prohibits
parties at fraternity houses
(U-WIRE) EAST LANSING, Mich.—Michigan State U.'s fraternity and sorority presidents voted Tuesday night to eliminate
social functions at fraternity houses effective July 1, 1999.
Greek leaders will reexamine adopting alcohol-free housing
March 1, 2001, as part of the proposal approved 20-6 by fraternity presidents and 16-0 by sorority presidents.
"This is a great step toward increased focus on our founding
values ofleadership, scholarship, service and friendship," Interfraternity Council President Jason Rosenbaum said after the vote.
Tuesday's vote followed a self-imposed 30-day moratorium
on greek social events, which ended March 11. Fraternity
and sorority presidents voted for the moratorium to give the
greek system time to return to its founding values, officials
have said.
"In the 30-day moratorium, we've addressed 99 percent of
the problems in the greek system," Rosenbaum said.
MSU President M. Peter McPherson had earlier threatened
not only to denounce the greek system, but pull university support as well if a suitably strong proposal was not adopted.

Judge denies NCAA appeal
(U-WIRE)—A federal judge threw two vital aspects of college
athletics—recruiting and eligibility—into a tailspin Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter denied a request by
the NCAA that would have allowed colleges to continue using
minimum standardized test scores as a benchmark when recruiting athletes.
The decision solidifies Buckwalter's ruling in a case last week
that struck down Proposition 16, an NCAA rule that required student athletes to meet minimum ACT or SAT scores when being
awarded an athletic scholarship. Buckwalter flagged Proposition
16 as discriminatory toward African-American student-athletes.
Hundreds of universities now have been left alone to decide
what the standards of admission for student-athletes will be. Without Proposition 16, students must graduate high school with a 2.0
grade-point average in 13 core courses in subjects such as English, history and math.
The ruling puts a freeze of sorts on college recruiting, as universities try to determine what standards they should follow when
awarding athletic scholarships.
Steve Mallonee, director of membership services for the NCAA,
said the association will file for an appeal of Buckwalter's decision.

National
Senate passes
missile
defense bill
On Wednesday, the Senate
approved 97-3 a bill that commits the U.S. to building a national missile-defense against
limited ballistic missile attack,
at this stage most likely from
North Korea or China. The bill
calls for a national ballisticmissile defense "as soon as
technologically possible."
Opponents to the military
investment say that the project
violates restrictions on missiles
set in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty (ABM) with
Russia.
Sen. Carl Levin, D-MI, said
that a compromise can be
reached between nuclear arms
reduction with the Russians,
concomitant with the creation
of the missile defense system.
Russian lawmakers have opposed the defense bill, saying
it violates ABM, and have
threatened to hold any further
nuclear weapon reduction in
Russia.

Guns bought
online without
checks
U.S. federal law currently
allows private weapons dealers
to sell to others in their state
without running background
checks on the buyer. With the
increase of firearm Web sites,
this is allowing increased intrastate sale without knowledge
of the buyer.
"You don't know if it's a
hobby collector, a criminal, or
kids online," said Desmond
Riley, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
Recently, the Treasury and
Justice departments recommended that the Brady Law be
amended to require gun checks
for sale online. Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., is introducing a bill this week to require
firearms sold only through federally licensed dealers and allowing Web sites to act only as
"middlemen" in the transaction.

about the diversity of Asian culture through events that include
film, music, dance, art, history,

have students be in charge.
Gross said, "Various committees over the years have
come up with a set of rules designed to allow students to

and we think that generally
students have done a good job
in staying within limits. Lately,
though, the rules are not being
observed well enough, and we

SAC and Student Council

Upper Tarble is a difficult

area to monitor because it is

highly accessible, and Party
Associates have a difficult time
keeping situations in check,
said Goundie. Moreover, there
is a shortage of PAs on campus, which further exacerbates
the situation.
According to Solomon, SAC
Chair Brian Bell '99 suggests
that in order to have a party, a
schedule of PA time slots
should be filled.
In case of emergencies, the
only readily accessible telephone the PAs have is two
flights of stairs below; accordingly, the Deans have
been considering more telephones or at least a radio

Parrish burglary suspect arrested
Student's
stolen camera
returned
by Carly Hammond
Staff Writer
On the quiet first morning of spring break, a man
from Chester entered an
unattended room in Parrish
and stole a student's 35mm camera. The suspect
was later arrested in Swarthmore, and the camera
was recovered.
A female student living
in Parrish Hall, who did
not wish to be identified,
left her room unattended at
10 a.m. on Saturday,
March 6. Returning to her
room, she found a man inside. After he left, she realized the man had taken
the camera, and called
Public Safety, who notified the Swarthmore Police Department.

The suspect, Gregory H.
Harris of Chester, was apprehended at the corner of
South Chester Road and
Park Avenue by both Public Safety and Swarthmore
Police.
According to Swarthmore
Police Chief Brian Craig of
the Swarthmore Police, the
suspect, Gregory H. Harris,
a resident of Chester, was
arrested and charged with
burglary, criminal trespass,
theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and
disorderly conduct. The
camera was recovered and
returned.
Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave reported that
in 1998 there were 44 cases
of larceny on campus. Although arrests were made in
some cases, the "overwhelming majority of property was
not recovered," he said.
According to Public
Safety, there were no criminal homicides, no forced
rapes, no robberies (differ-

ent from larcenies because
it is forcibly taking from
one's person), four assaults, 20 burglaries, no
cases of arson and 47 cases
of vandalism on campus in
1998.
Parrish Hall, which remains unlocked for the offices inside, is an easier
target than other dormitories that are only accessible to residents.
However, Redgrave does
not think that this makes
Parrish more susceptible
to crime. "My gut feeling
is that Parrish statistics
aren't any higher," he said.
Nevertheless,
says
Redgrave, Parrish is not
necessarily a safe place
because its statistics are
lower. For instance, many
crimes which take place
are not reported. Thus,
Public Safety wishes to
heighten the awareness of
the students.
Said Redgrave, "Any
crime is one too many."

new

percent provide "miscellaneous" services.
Several factors have caused a recent
overall decline in business. Changing
prescription guidelines have affected
the pharmacy, while both competition
and volume reduction have impacted
the Co-op. Almost all the restaurants
compete for the same market of older
diners, while the hardware store,
among others, suffers from a lack of
space. Business from College students and SEPTA travelers is minimal, parking is a problem, andretailer
hours need more flexibility.
Finally, the physical appearance of
the Ville warrants scrutiny. In its attempt to provide solutions, the report
incorporates suggestions from local
businesses, the Swarthmore residential community and the College community, all of which seem to share
certain underlying concerns.
The common concerns among borough members are maintaining the
neighborhood-friendly quality of the
town, developing an inn, improving
the Town Center's appearance, improving parking options and locations, adding a bakery and ice cream
parlor or coffee bar, and both maintaining and improving the status of
local businesses.
Other frequent suggestions include
improving bicycle paths and creating
options for teenagers. Less frequent
suggestions include expanding business hours (a big concern among College students) and establishing a recycling center.
A much-debated option, which the
College is taking under consideration,
is relocating the College bookstore in
the Ville, as is a common practice
among many other colleges and universities.
An improvement of the Ville's
physical appearance would include
repairing sidewalks, landscaping,
adding lighting and coordinating the
facades of the various local businesses. Most public sidewalks are not
up to par, and the current pole lights
(wood utility, mounted) do not fit in
aesthetically.
Pedestrian scale street lighting
hardly exists, and utility wires and
poles are too visible. Underpass traffic clogs up the area, while the midblock walkways are hard to navigate,
poorly lighted, and remain aesthetically displeasing. A popular idea is
to build a public plaza, as there is
presently no open space that could be
designated as a "town square." Because of this, outdoor events currently
take place in parking lots.
Several gripes about parking lots
and spaces also need to be addressed.
Currently, there is a mixture of parallel and angled parking spaces,
which results in narrow sidewalks,
among other detriments. In addition,
most of the metered spaces are fivehour spots, and therefore unavailable
for short-term errands such as shopping. Current proposals for improving the parking situation include reducing the number of five-hour
meters, eliminating some of the
angled parking spots (compensating
for the lost spots by creating more
parallel spaces), and modifying the
Borough parking lot.
The Chester Road underpass is currently undergoing renovation, thanks
to SEPTA funds. The platform and
track area between the stairways on
both in- and out-bound platforms, as
well as the roadway between the inbound platform and the south wall of
the underpass, are being improved.

walls and railings, a concrete platform
between stairways on both platforms,
and new sidewalks. However, there are
currently no plans for lighting improvements to the underpass stairs or
walkways.
The other most frequently-suggested improvement, an inn, would
also seem to be a profitable venture.
At presently visitors wind up staying
in hotels up to a half hour's drive from
campus. Along with prospective students and their families, temporary
housing demands also exist for commencement weekend, honors degree
examiners, alumni events, as well as
weddings and catered events on the
College grounds.
As Swarthmore College can normally house only 17 guests at one
time, an inn would almost presumably
garner a great deal of business.
Slightly less popular ideas concerned the creation of new restaurants
and stores. Opening a bakery appears
to be the most popular choice as far
as possible new ventures are concerned, followed by a College bookstore.

Before new ventures can be discussed, however, the Co-op needs to
be addressed. The grocery store,
which generates about 25 percent of
the Town Center's profits, uses only
45 percent of its space for displaying
goods. The building also suffers from
structural deterioration and drainage
problems. The main issue is what to
do about temporary relocation if the

The report also analyzes the role of
the College consumer. Overall, half of
the Town Center businesses were visited by at least 13 percent of the students surveyed. The questionnaires reveals that the greatest number of
Swatties visit the Co-op, followed by
the pharmacy, Renato's, and Cheng
Hing. The latter two were more popular than several restaurants along Baltimore Pike, including the Outback
Steakhouse. Genuardi's bumped out
the Co-op for first place among student shoppers (though students without cars tended to shop at the Co-op
more frequently than Genuardi's),

The winners, who will be responsible for the fees
if they claim the tickets, called Cape Canaveral
and inquired about the price of the cruise. Without
the "free" ticket, the cruise costs the same $195.
Quint members were disheartened additionally
when they recently read an article by a professional
cruise reviewer calling Cape Canaveral Cruise one
of the worst cruises on the market.
"The situation is unfortunate," said Student
Council Co-Chair Jared Solomon 'Ol. "If the students feel that SAC did not use appropriate scrutiny, they should register a complaint with SAC."
SAC donated the six cruises to the winners of
Roommate Rivalry, the game show that preceded
the Screw Your Roommate formal. In the game,
pairs of roommates were pitted against one other;
whichever two roommates knew the most about

Roommates Duffy and Samols captured four

Twenty-five percent of students surveyed had visited the Cheese Court or
hardware store, while hardly any ever
shopped at specialty shops such as My
Cousin's Closet and Cricket's Way. Almost no students grace the Village
Restaurant with their presence, or the
Ingleneuk Tea House.
Faculty members tend to eat at
Renato's more than anywhere else in
the Ville, and list more restaurants as
their number one choice for the establishment of new retail services. This
choice is followed by a coffee shop,
bookstore, bakery and drug store.
A final long-standing debate concerns whether the Town Center should
change its "dry" status by allowing
local restaurants, and possibly the proposed inn, to serve alcohol. Another
alternative being considered is the establishment of a BYOB liquor policy
for customers in Town Center restaurants. However, despite the wide disparity of opinions, the consensus is
that beverage distributors or wine
shops will not be welcome, and would
detract from the quality of the area.

Letters
Stulman's New York Times
Op-Ed found insulting
I am deeply troubled by Nate Stulman's op-ed piece,
published in the New York Times this past Monday, and the
letter which followed in Wednesday's edition.
For those of you who missed it, Mr. Stulman's piece was
entitled "The Great Campus Goof-Off Machine," and implies
that colleges should not provide internet access to students
because of the way students waste their time on the 'net.
I disagree with Mr. Stulman's assertion, but that's not why
I'm writing. I am bothered more by the fact that he identified
himself as a Swarthmore College student and wrote that
students here are "playing Tomb Raider instead of going to
chemistry class, tweaking the configurations of their machines
instead of writing the paper due tomorrow, collecting mostly
useless information from the World Wide Web instead of
a host of other activity that has
doing a math problem set
little or nothing to do with traditional academic work."
I prefer Civilization to Tomb Raider, but that's not the point.
Mr. Stulman's piece was not representative of the vast majority of Swarthmore students, students who pride themselves on
their work ethic.
What are the consequences of his misrepresentation? Well,
there's always the letter from a self-righteous Carnegie
Mellon grad, who asked"What kind of educational institution
is Swarthmore College if students can goof off on the Internet
for four, five or ten hours a day and not flunk out?"
I don't know about you, but I've found that as many
people know Swarthmore as a small girls school in upstate
New York as know it for what it really is. I suppose that
more people do know Swarthmore now, but not as the
nation's premier liberal arts college. Instead, we're an
expensive private college that allows students to spend
"entire evenings
six to eight hours" goofing off and still
maintain passing grades.
I don't know how it effects you, but article and its ramifications hurts me. The people reading my internship applications
this week are less likely to have a favorable impression of
Swarthmore than they did a few days ago, even if they'd never
heard ofthe college before. My heart goes out to those
seniors who sit down for job interviews this week only to find
that their interviewer's first impression of Swarthmore College was through a libelous op-ed piece in the Times.
Perhaps I can follow Mr. Stulman's lead and make a
nearly groundless statement based on his op-ed piece. The
College should not allow students to have access to word
processors and the New York Times because they will
waste their time trivializing the hard work done by others.
Mr. Stulman's friends might waste hours on their computers, but at least the time they spend in front of their monitors only hurts themselves.

The present conflict in
Kosovo is not one between
two sovereign entities but is
instead a civil matter. As we
recognize the right of other
sovereign nations to govern
themselves so too must we
accede Serbia's legal authority over Kosovo. Likewise,
should armed guerillas
within a nation begin an insurrection, the government of
that state can hardly be expected to turn a blind eye.
Some have argued, however,
that the Albanian rebels of
Kosovo are in the right as
they represent the ethnic majority of that region. Yet,
should armed rebels in any
American state demand independence, regardless of the
ethnic breakdown of that
state, the majority of the
populace would no doubt demand government action.
That the situation in
Kosovo is indeed a civil war
should preclude American intervention. Furthermore,
such action on our part promises little gain but much
harm. Regarding the former,
one must consider that the
Kosovo fighting in no way

interests. Analysts would be
hard-pressed to find even a

an unchecked Kosovo war

are demanding the arrests of

bullets.

it has. Mayor Giuliani may be

US needs
universal
health care
by Ben Schweigert

Contributing Writer

Today in America, there are 40
million people without health insurance. Some people seem to
believe that our present system
of HMOs and managed care either works well or should be
further privatized. However, our
system is not working well, nor
isfurther market-orientedreform
the answer to its ills.
Americans generally agree
that health care should not be a
perfect market. A perfect market requires that consumers (patients) are selected by their ability to pay, and that those unable
to pay the market rate simply are
not provided the service. However, 91 % of Americans believe
that everybody should have the
right to the best possible health
care. Ourcriteria, then, for evaluating how well our system works
should be to look toward providing the best coverage, for the
lowest cost, to the greatest number of people. Our system leaves
a huge portion of our population
untreated. Furthermore, it provides generally worse' service
and is costlier per capita than
universal coverage systems in
other Western democracies.
In a market system of health
insurance, like the one that we have
now, there is constant pressure on
insurance providers to drive down
the cost of their service. Unfortunately, the best way (and the way
thatcompanies have chosen) to do
this is not by increasing efficiency,
but by simply excluding the very
sick and those with preexisting
conditions, a practice calledrisk selection. After all, the sickest 1 % of
Americans consume 28% ofmedical costs. So a sick person who
loses theirhealth insurance by their
employer going out ofbusiness, for
example, cannot get into another
plan. Furthermore, the fact that we
expect employers to cover health
insurance simply assures that many
people won't be covered, since a
rapidly growing segment of the
population consists of part-time,
under-employed, non-unionized,
and/or temporary workers, who
receive no coverage.
Another common criticism of
universal coverage is that it will
cost more and that the level of service will decline. This is not the
case. The United States spends a
far greater percentage of its GDP
on health care than any Western
nation thathas universal coverage:
14%in the US versus an average
of 9% in other industrialized countries. There are many reasons for
this. First and foremost, health care
providers make more money on
expensive treatments than they do
on cost-efficient preventative care.
However, there are many other
costs that private providers have
thatnational programs do not: marketing, administrative costs for
risk-selection, and most ofall, profits. Profits alone consume 30% of
the American health care dollar,
while all administrative costs in
Medicare, for example consume
only 2.4%.
In light of all this, we need
serious health care restructuring,
with universal coverage for all
Americans. Service would improve and costs would dramatically drop.

Market forces should
control health care prices
by Dave Thomas
Contributing writer
Who is in charge ofhealth care? That
is, who determines the treatment a patient will receive? Think it is the doctor? You are dead wrong. It is the insurance companies who determine
which types or treatments, or tests, are
most cost-effective for the insured. It
is no wonder people turn to government
for redress; no one likes to think oftheir
health as cost-effective. But government managed care is not where the
solution lies. In the long run, it only
leads to lower quality, more expensive
care for everyone.
So far, the President and his allies
have tried the strategy of allowing lawyers more freedom in suing the providers (insurance companies). While this
may redress one patient's wrongs, it
drives up the price of health care enormously for everyone else, and does
nothing to bring any substanstive
change.
The only way to reform the system
is to allow for greater patient choice. If
patients have more freedom to switch
plans, natural market forces will take
over, driving the cost of health care
down as providers compete with each
other for business.
The most attractive aspect of naru-

ral competition is that it helps those
who don't have coverage. One of the
main reasons there are so many
uninsureds today is because of the rising cost of family health care. From
1988 to 1996, the cost of health care
per family more than doubled to over
5,000 dollars a year. The uninsureds are
victims of a vicious cycle. Government
imposes red tape on the market, driving up costs for providers. Providers are
then forced to raise prices, forcing patients to call for greater regulation. If
the government stepped in to redress
only the most grievous discrepancies,
the cost of health care would drop precipitously. More people could be insured, and the overall cost to everyone
would be lower.
Replace the existing tax exclusion
with a refundable Universal Tax
Credit for insurance purchased by individuals, with very few if any strings
attached. Give consumers a voucher
of a fixed-dollar amount and let them
shop in the marketplace for the coverage that best suits their needs. If
they want richer coverage, they are
free to pay for it with after-tax dollars. This plan of minimum coverage
serves the needs of people of all incomes, regardless of their job. In the
end, it is the most fair and most realistic plan of reform.

Many opponents of the death penalty argue that the punish\J- racially

is

white man by the name of John William King was sentenced to death
for the racially motivated murder of a black man. Do you support the
death sentence in this case?
Swat Pulse is a new weekly features in the opinions section. Every issue,
look in this space to see how Swarthmore students respond to important
campus, national, and international issues.
No, I do not support the death sentence in this or any case. Justifying
the death sentence in this case by saying it was a racially motivated crime
by a white person against a black man
simply perpetuates the notion that the
death sentence is/should be racially
biased.
Amy Dickson '99
As someone who is very anti-death
penalty, I often use the argument that
the death penalty is racially biased.
However, that is not the only reason
that I oppose it. Despite the horrific
details of the death in jasper, I do not
believe the murderers should die. Yes,
I am an African-American. Yes, I
want the killers to be punished fully.
But I still believe that the death penalty is hypocritical, inhumane, and unjust. I oppose its use no matter what
the skin color of the victims or the
criminals may be.
Elizabeth Lindsey 'O2

I

be philosophically in fa-

cannot

vor of the deathpenalty under any circumstances. In this case, as in many

others, my anger at the perpetrator of

a crime so horrendous makes me glad
on a gut level to see him sentenced to
death, but in a civilized society mur-

der must never be sanctioned it is
just as much murder for the government to execute someone as it is for
that person to have killed someone
else. The death penalty has a number
of things going for it, chief among
which is the fact that some people
clearly deserve to die, but it has
against it the one point which really
matters, which is that it is wrong.
On the subject of race, I suppose it's
encouraging, inasmuch as someone's
impending death can be encouraging,
to see a white man sentenced to death
for killing a black man. However, this
is, as far as I can see, the only semibright spot in the grimy blot of this
execution. We can talk all we want
about being a civilized society which
is working to eliminate racism, but
until we eliminate the death penalty,
we are still barbarians.
Willa Bandler 'Ol
—

In the national context of a racially
biased death penalty, yes. In the larger
context of human justice and in the
long term, no, I'd like to see the death
penalty abolished. In other words, I
think the harm of yet another racially
biased death sentence is the paramount issue at hand. The Phoenix
doesn't really think this issue can be
reduced to a yes or no question, does
it?
Lorrin Nelson 'OO
Personally, I'd like to say that I'm
against capital punishment in any
way, shape, or form... but I'm not. I
feel that people who show an obvious disconcern for the value of human life and who like William King
commit such a vile and despicable
act, exist as a threat to the very safety
of all. The nature of the murder in Jasper, Texas most likely makes it somewhat easier for many to support a sentence to death.
Rodney Morris 'Ol
-

-

Juries are composed of imperfect
people who are likely to share the biases of their society. Judgments
handed down in court will reflect societal prejudices, whether they be racial, ideological, or political. The current disproportionate use of the death
penalty against racial minorities is just
one example ofhow these prejudices
play out in practice. Since we can
never entirely remove human partiality from trials, the question becomes
where to draw the line in granting
power to a flawed process. I would
set the limit at letting the government
make biased decisions that lead to direct killing and hence oppose the
death penalty in any case-including
that of John William King.
Maria Krisch '99
No, though it has nothing to do with
race. As the death penalty is not crucial to our society's survival, and we
as human beings remain fallible, we
have no reason to prescribe death in
the name of justice.
Ben Chan 'Ol

The Reproductive Health Counselors have sponsored the distribution of condoms and other services in conjunction with National Condom Week and other events, file photo
on on- and off-campus resources,
funding and transportation as well as
health issues. The group of freshmen,
sophomore, junior and senior counselors have undergone a two-day
training to become familiar with the
resource information and to better
approach all concerns and questions
.n a non-judgmental, apolitical and
supportive way.
All conversations are strictly confidential and phone calls may remain
anonymous, though counselors have
found that the small-campus feel of
Swarthmore has led to more discussions of sexual health over meals in
Sharpies with friends and acquaintan-

ces than to anonymous phone call in-

quiries.
This phenomenon speaks well of
Swarthmore students. Willingness to
discuss sexual and reproductive health
and a seemingly small need for
hotline-type support is areflection of,
a well-educated, healthy student body.
But as the staff of Worth warns us,
don’t assume that Swarthmore is any
different than anywhere else in terms
of STD infection and naivete.
After all, it is a little-known fact that
human papillomavirus (HPV), the disease that causes genital warts, is the
most common STD. More than half
of all infected individuals may show

no symptoms, and the vims is associated with 90% of all cervical cancers
(the second leading cause of death
among women). HPV may be transmitted even when no symptoms are
visible, and even condoms may offer
little protection against transmission?
Some health experts say this disease
may soon afflict nearly all sexually
active individuals in the world. How
to protect yourself? Get informed.
While the Reproductive Health
Counselors can’t guarantee perfect
safety, perfect sex or even multiple orgasms, they do offer the most current
information available and a wealth of
resources beyond any individual’s.

The combination of dorm autonomy, co-ed housing, the revocation ofthe sex rule, and the introduction of the Pill completed the

modern dating habits.

Love, marriage and college: a special brew
by Rachel Rose Gutman Reich
Contributing Writer

I wake up at around 7:30 am, shower,

dress and eat breakfast. By around 8:00
am, I try to coerce my husband, Sam, to
get out of bed so that he won't be late
for school. I make lunch for the two of
us, calling upstairs from the kitchen every few minutes for Sam to wake up.
By 8:30 am, I am ready to leave. I still
need to bug Sam once more to get out
ofbed before I get into our car and drive
to school.
At school, I spend most ofmy time in
Scott Gilbert's developmental genetics
lab. But even at school, I am still thinking about home. While doing my research, I know I have to make shopping
lists. While working on the computer, I
know I have to plan dinner and when to

do laundry.
I drive home, usually around 5:00 pm,
and once home I greet my husband, prepare dinner, do laundry, and of course
work on my school assignments. On
Wednesday nights, Sam and I go grocery shopping and pick up our meat order and on Fridays I spend most of the
day cooking and baking. Somewhere in
between everything else we manage to
get the house clean, do the dishes, take
care of our pet turtle, and even find time
to take a deep breath.
Being married at Swarthmore is a very
different experience from my past three
years as a single woman living in the
dorm. I rarely see my friends from
school. I have to schedule special meeting times for lunch dates or tennis games
to see anyone aside from my biology
peers. I no longer go to formals, play

basketball, eat at Sharpies, hang out in
the dorms or even meet new Swatties.
Most Swarthmore faces are unfamiliar to me after spending junior year preoccupied with a long distance engagement and planning a wedding and senior year married and living in Philadelphia. Our friends now are mostly
other married couples, and most of my
socializing is done along with Sam.
Marriage brings with it new kinds of
decisions to make. While Sam is in
graduate school, can I also pursue an
advanced degree, or should I instead
work for the next few years? When is
the best time to start a family? Should I
have children and then go to graduate
school or try to finish school first? What
career should I pursue, considering that
I want to be home a lot when our children are young?

Sometimes being a married student
can be frustrating. It is difficult trying

to balance being in the honors program
at one ofthe country's best schools with
trying to also be the perfect wife. I often
feel that I am trying to lead two lives
that are both full-time jobs, and that I
have to cut corners that leave me falling
short of reaching my goals in both arenas. But marriage also has its good side,
which thankfully, outweighs the hardships it brings with it. I have a constant
companion, who is thoughtful and caring, understands my needs, and most
importantly, is always there for me because my happiness is just as important
to him as his own. Sam helps me with
my research and listens to how my day
was, is a great help with the household
chores, and best of all, gives meaning to
all my labors.

The Olde Classic Restaurant, located in the Olde
Sproul Shopping Village just
off the Baltimore Pike, is a
restaurant that is not too far
away when you just want a
quick bite or don't have
enough cash to get into
Philly. Unlike its name
might indicate, this restaurant is your basic Chinese
food restaurant. The menu
boasts a wide array of dishes
at varying costs, generally
less than ten dollars. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing, and the wait staffis generally quite friendly. However, unless you feel like
spending ten bucks for
slightly less-than-mediocre
food, this is probably not the
place for you. Although my
order of General Tso's
Chicken promptly arrived
less than ten minutes after. I

a

placed my order, it was overcooked and bland. Also,
there was only a sparse selection of vegetarian dishes
and healthy items on the
menu. In fact, the most positive feature of this restaurant
is the staff's attention to detail. For example, after my
meal I was brought a warm
washcloth to wipe my hands
as well as orange slices to
cleanse my palette.

Today's changing economic and business environment
requires managers have knowledge of the interrelationships
of these processes. That's why CGU crafted its Master of
Arts in Politics, Economics, and Business. Described as
an "MBA of the Future," it provides our graduates
with the skills to deal with global and local issues.
Fellowships are available. Visit our Web site (you can

The Academy Awards are this
Sunday at 8:30 on ABC, Channel
Six. Look for host Whoopi
Goldberg to comment on her
clothes more often than she makes
funny jokes and for numerous reaction shots from the hottest nominee, Gwyneth Paltrow—especially
when Ben Affleck takes the stage.
Also look for me to be spectacularly wrong in most
of the following
predictions. Oscars
tend to go in unexpected directions,
and I am more ignorant than I have
been in a few years
about the nominees
(I haven't seen all
the films). I've never let that stop
me before, however, so here are my
thoughts on who will win and who
should win in the major categories.
Adapted Screenplay
The Nominees: Bill Condon for
"Gods and Monsters"; Scott Frank
for "Out of Sight"; Elaine May for
"Primary Colors"; Scott B. Smith
for "A Simple Plan"; Terence
Malick for "The Thin
Line."
Who WillWin: Voters will want
to reward Malick for his return to
the screen after twenty years, despite critical and popular indecisiveness over this three-hour personal indulgence / cinematic masterpiece, and he sure isn't going
to win best director.
Who Should Win: Scott B.
Smith for "A Simple Plan." There
simply wasn't a tighter, more
compelling story told on screen
this year than Smith's adaptation
of his own novel about three ordinary men and the curse of a
"free" $5OOO.
Original Screenplay
The Nominees: Warren Beatty
and Jeremy Pikser for "Bulworth";
Vincenzo Cerami and Roberto
Benigni for "Life is Beautiful";
Robert Rodat for "Saving Private
Ryan"; Marc Norman and Tom
Stoppard for "Shakespeare in
Love"; Andrew Niccol for "The
Truman Show."
Who Will Win: Marc Norman
and
Tom
for
Stoppard
"Shakespeare in Love." The script's
considered the thing in this witty
takeoff on "Romeo & Juliet," especially since the Academy would
love to feel all literate and reward
playwright Stoppard, who actually
just sharpened Norman's draft.
Who Should Win: Benigni for
"Life is Beautiful." Hey, you try
writing a comedy about the Holocaust.
Actress
The Nominees: Cate Blanchett
for "Elizabeth"; Fernanda
Montenegro for "Central Station";
Gwyneth Paltrow for "Shakespeare
in Love"; Meryl Streep for "One
True Thing"; Emily Watson for
"Hillary and Jackie."
Who Will Win: Cate Blanchett
for "Elizabeth." The conventional
money is on Gwyneth, but I think
Oscar voters will feel all serious voting for Blanchett's portrayal of the
Virgin Queen.
Who Should Win: Fernanda

Montenegro for "Central Station."
OK, I haven't seen the movie either, but I'm willing to bet this celebrated 69 year-old veteran from
Brazil could act circles around her
competitors. Sadly, few others, including many Academy members,
saw this film either, so we'll never
know.
Supporting Actress
The Nominees:
Kathy
Bates for "Primary Colors";
Ben Fritz
Brenda Blethyn
The Other
for
"Little
Unreal World Voice";
Judi
Dench
for
"Shakespeare in
Love"; Rachel
Griffiths for "Hillary and Jackie";
Lynn Redgrave for "Gods and.
Monsters."
Who Will Win: Judi Dench for
"Shakespeare in Love." She's only
on for nine minutes, but everyone
agrees that Dame Judi dominates
every scene as Queen Elizabeth in
this film many in Hollywood have
fallen for hard. Plus, many Oscar
voters probably feel they owe her
after snubbing her last year for her
brilliant and subtle portrayal of another British queen, Victoria, in
"Mrs. Brown." And wouldn't it be
cool if both the winning actresses
this year get theiraward for portraying the same person?
Who Should Win: Judi Dench for
"Shakespeare in Love." I have never
seen another character so brought
to life in such a short amount oftime
on screen.

Supporting Actor
The Nominees: JamesCoburn for
"Affliction"; Robert Duvall for "A
Civil Action"; Ed Harris for "The
Truman Show"; Geoffrey Rush for
"Shakespeare in Love"; Billy Bob
Thornton for "A
Simple Plan."
Who Will Win:
James Cobum for
"Affliction." This
is a VERY tight
race to call, but
I'll bet that
Coburn's critically acclaimed
return to the
screen after a long
absence as an
abusive, alcoholic father of two
grown sons will edge out Ed
Harris's subtle turn as Jim
Carrey's personal God in "The
Truman Show" and Billy Bob
Thornton's devastating portrayal
as the dimmest, yet wisest character in "A Simple Plan."
Who Should Win: Billy Bob
Thornton for "A Simple Plan."
Thornton manages to be simultaneously pathetic and profound
in this dead-on performance.
You're guaranteed to laugh at
him in the beginning and cry for
him at the end and never to lose
interest for a second along the
way. (This award is truly Bill
Murray's for his pathetically hiperformance
larious
in
"Rushmore." His absence is by
far the greatest sin of this year's

Actor

The Nominees: Roberto Benigni
for "Life is Beautiful"; Tom Hanks
for "Saving Private Ryan"; lan
McKellen for "Gods and Monsters"; Nick Nolte for "Affliction";
Edward Norton for "American History X."
Who Will Win: Nick Nolte for
"Affliction." The Academy won't
be able to resist the performance
of a career from a long undervalued actor.
Who Should Win: lan McKellen
for "Gods and Monsters" or Nick
Nolte for "Affliction." Both are fine
veteranactors who literally inhabit
their characters in films built
around them. I find it impossible
to say who gives the more compelling performance or which one deserves to finally take home the
golden boy.
Director
The Nominees: Roberto Benigni
for "Life is Beautiful"; John Madden (not that John Madden) for
"Shakespeare in Love"; Terence
Malick for "The Thin Red Line";
Steven Spielberg for "Saving Private Ryan"; Peter Weir for "The
Truman Show."
Who Will Win: Steven Spielberg

for "Saving Private Ryan." Duh.
Who Should Win: Steven
Spielberg for "Saving Private
Ryan." Sure he overdoes the
schmaltz, but the invasion of
Normandy is one of the most brilliantly real sequences ever put on
film. And Spielberg's talent for engrossing dialogue scenes is just icing on the cake.
Picture
The Nominees: "Elizabeth";

Who Will Win: "Saving Private

Who Should Win: "Saving

popular opinion when most of
the nation thinks an entire nation is so deeply effected by a
single film. There may have
been other films which struck
me as more original ("The
Butcher Boy") or compelling
("Happiness"), but I can't deny
that "Saving Private Ryan" is a
profound, brilliantly crafted
movie that brings home the
sacrifice of our grandparents

Restaurant Picks
On-line investing provides
large benefits, high risks
Olde Classic Restaurant's
by Natalie Graham

Consumers are often unaware
of pros and cons of investing
by Eugene Yoshida and

Adam Rashid

Contributing writers

For those of you who made

some money over the summer

and have it sitting in the
Credit Union savings account
you might be better off with
your money in the stocks,
bonds, or money market accounts. On-line brokerages
have made investing much
more accessible and simple.
Novice on-line investors are
often unaware of the risks and
benefits of
this type of investing, and
this lack of information often results in
serious losses
to the consumer.
One of the
primary benefits of online investing
is the low
cost
of commissions.
Whereas a full-service brokerage such as Merrill
Lynch or Smith Barney
charges a percentage of the
transaction amount (commonly more than $100), online brokers charge a flat
commission per trade.
Charles Schwab, the most
voluminous on-line broker,
charges a minimum of $39
a trade. Brokerages like
Scottrade or Suretrade, on
the other hand, charge as
little as $7 per stock trade.
Another benefit of on-line
trading is the easy access to
information. The websites
of on-line brokerages allow
users to obtain stock quotes,
usually with a twenty
minute delay, although
some brokerages provide realtime quotes
either for
free or fee.
In addition,
consumers
can configure their on-line brokerages
to notify then of new items
relating to stocks they own
or are considering. Stock
screening tools allow users
to sort and filter a large
amount of stocks according
to prescribed criteria (such
as finding the computer
companies with the highest
margins). Graphing tools allow one to compare stock
prices over time.
Constantly monitoring accounts is significantly easier
with on-line investing. Instead of waiting until the
end of the month for your
Merrill Lynch account statement, on-line investors can
monitor portfolios continuously. This convenience is
advantageous during periods of high volatility, when
stock prices are experiencing large swings, because
investors can make invest-

decisions with up-todate information.
On-line investors must research thoroughly however.
Although a stockbroker can
provide valuable advice, the
absence of a stockbroker
forces the on-line investor to
research stock ideas alone.
In the process, on-line investors become more disciplined and discriminating in
their stock selection. Investors can use the variety of
tools provided by their online broker and other investment services to
perform
rethis
search.
Novice
on-line inment

On-line

investors
become more
disciplined and
discriminating
in their stock

should
keep
in
mind the
risks and
potential
detriments
of on-line investing when
experiementing with this
emerging investing method.
There is the risk of operational failure when investing
on-line. During periods of
heavy volume trading when
many investors are executing trades during a small
time period, some on-line
brokerage websites have become non-functional. For
example, if the market is
crashing or soaring, you
may not be able to log on to
your on-line brokerage so
you cannot sell or buy your
stock holdings.
Computer trading brings
with it delayed trade execution. Your trade, more often
than not, will not be executed
at the time you click the buy
or sell button. There
is often a
lag between
the
time
trades have
been submitted and
trades have
been executed. Though this
is not significant for longterm traders, however, for
day-traders a trade submitted
at one price may vary greatly
from the actual executed
price.
There is a lack ofadvice for
the on-line investor. The
larger brokerages like Merrill
Lynch and Charles Schwab
can give valuable advice on
individual securities, distribution of investments, suitability of investments and gauge
the risk of your portfolio. Online brokerages do not provide these same services, but
instead provide the tools for
users to do their own research.
On-line trading provides
for the gunslinger mentality:
If on-line trading appeals to
you to get a quick buck take
your money to Atlantic City.
The ease-of-use and quick ac-

selection.

'

v e s to r s

cess to trading may cause
some individuals to hasty decisions without performing
diligent research. If you,
however, keep in mind that
investing requires diligence,
analysis, and reasonable
judgement; investing for the
long-term is the most profitable strategy.
Learning about investing
and beginning to invest now
are essential to a successful financial future. Employers
usually provide employees
with 401(k) plans, which are
basically retirement plans
composed of securities.
Learning the basics of investing now will allow you to
make informed decisions
about your future 401 (k)
plans, individual retirement
accounts and pension plans.

PLAYER PROFILE
Amy Dißenedetto 'O2
by Kristen English
Contributing Writer

Willingness to take one for
the team—it's one of those
timeless intangible qualities of
the true athlete. This season,
freshman Amy Dißenedetto
has taken one for the women's
lacrosse team and then another
one and then a few more....
Disregarding the inevitable
pain and terror of having hard
rubber balls rocketed at her
head for two hours a day six
days a week, Dißenedetto
grabbed a helmet and plunged
into a goal left vacant by an
abroad Jane Kendall 'OO. With
all of six weeks experience
under her belt, the 5'2" fireball
is already a phenomenal player.
"Amy's attitude is what
makes her so good," notes
Carry Hammond 'OO. "She's so
motivated to understand the
position and take control of it.
She feels like she ownsthe goal
and is responsible for it."
In addition to her success,
Dißenedetto has already garnered a broken thumb and a
wealth of bruises, which she
says are "disgusting and downright ugly." With such a fate
included in the job description,
one might naturally wonder
what could have possibly possessed her to volunteer for the
job.
"I guess it was a combination of not really expecting to
be a big asset on the field but
wanting to be," says
Dißenedetto. "I didn't start
playing lacrosse until ninth
grade, and I don't have much
confidence in my skills. But I
also thought it would be fun, a
new experience, and a challenge."
Dißenedetto has already
taken great strides to validate
these expectations. She says
she is definitely having fun and
basking in the daily challenges,
"It's so exciting. It's something
new every time someone
comes down the field, every
shot is something different. It
keeps me wanting to make
myself better.
"During a game over spring
break, there was a play where
I stepped out of the goal and
knocked down a pass. It felt so
good to make such an aggressive play. It was a move I had
been having trouble with in
practice, but this was one of
those moments where I felt like
I did everything I had been
taught. There was another time
during a scrimmage with the
coaches when I stopped one of
head coach Karen Borbee's
shots. She jokingly gave me
such a dirty look, and I knew
she was proud of me."
This is the extent of any
credit Dißenedetto will allow
herself, but her teammates and
coaches have no problem raving about her inspirational success between the pipes.
"Amy has proven to the team
what a talented athlete she is,"
says Jen Hagan '99. "She
learned in a few short weeks
what most goalies take years
to learn, and her attitude and
determination are definitely an

inspiration to our team."
"Amy has such a positive
mental attitude, and that has
allowed her to be so successful," added Katie Tarr 'O2.
"Each day she comes to practice with the desire and determination to improve, and every day she does."
"She has mental toughness
and is very coachable; she
trusts us," notes coach Julie
Mazer. "Amy wants to do well,
and she challenges herself just
the right amount."
Whether she would admit it
or not, Dißenedetto can rest
assured that she has become a
major asset to the team.
So what did it take to turn
this self-proclaimed "skilless"
freshman into a loudmouth
brick-wall?
"You pretty much have to be
crazy," laughs Dißenedetto.
"You have to let go of all fears
of getting hurt. It's both terrifying and exhilarating, and you
have to let your reflexes take
over. It's also taken determination and perseverance because
I haven't had much time to
work with. It's the weirdest
feeling to see a girl coming
down the field knowing she
wants to put the ball behind my
body."
"You need to have confidence. I have so much confidence in our defense to keep
the girls away from me and to
prevent them from taking good
shots, and I know the offense
will pull through," she said.
"I'm still working on my
own confidence, but I've seen
that when I go into a game feeling calm and consistent, I do
much better than when I'm
feeling uptight. I have to learn
to distinguish between a shot
that was stoppable and one that
was justunbelievable. This has
been kind of tough because I
tend to be a perfectionist by
nature. This is why the support
from the team and coaches has
been so great. It's amazing
how they've been there every
step of the way to encourage
me. I can't thank them
enough."
With the season barely underway, things are looking
bright for the women's lacrosse team, and players like
Dißenedetto are a big reason
for this. "For a team to be successful, it needs to have the
quiet hard workers who don't
get much hype," she says.
"You need the little guys in
there to keep things going."
It is clear that Dißenedetto
is prepared to take one, and
many more, for the team this
year.

Baseball has potential, needs wins
by Steve Farneth

Staff Writer
The Florida sun brought out the best and the
worst in the Baseball Garnet Tide. Playing one
inspired game, three solid games, and two which
they seemed to sleepwalk through left the Tide
with a 2-4 record which misrepresents the
team's generally high level ofplay. Aside from
a 6-2 shellacking at the hands of Division II
powerhouse Elizabethtown and an 11-1 finalday debacle against Wesley, Swarthmore had a
chance to win every game. The opening 7-4 victory over Wesley saw Swat in its finest form
since the end of 1997.
The immaculately groomed Florida fields
seemed to bolster the team's confidence. The
Tide's conspicuous past defensive weaknesses
were replaced by solid and occasionallyremarkable glovework. This new defensive maturity
was unfortunately offset by a severe lack of
timely hitting and the sort of inexplicable errors which have plagued the team. Each contributed to the Elizabethtown loss and the 4-3
loss to Waynesburg College which followed,
wasting a fine pitching performance by Josh

Roth '99. Swarthmore rebounded two days later
with an 11-8 win over Elizabethtown, exploding in the sixth inning for 10 runs. Carlo Fitti
'OO awoke the slumbering offense with a clutch
double; hits by Joe Corso 'O2 and Josh Lindsey
'Ol opened the floodgates.
This offensive performance unfortunately did
not prove to be the breakthrough Swat had
hoped for. The Tide followed its win over
Elizabethtown by dropping both ends of a
doubleheader the next day: first to Widener, 42, and then to Wesley, 11-1.
Swarthmore can take heart in the emergence
of Scott Murray 'Ol and Doug Kneeland 'O2 as
legitimate pitchers to ease the load on Roth and
Steve Farneth 'OO. However, the team's hit total
and run production remain matters of concern.
Bunting and baserunning will help to an extent,
but if Swarthmore is to be a winning ballclub, it
must eventually cluster its extra base hits together.
Historically, run production improves as the season progresses. Chalk Swarthmore's run production problems in Florida up to the slow bat syndrome typical of spring training and the prospects
are promising. A Swarthmore team that scores
five runs a game should be at least a .500 ballclub.

Travelling men's tennis team preps for
spring season and national ranking
by Pete Schilla

The men's tennis team traveled to California for four
matches over Spring Break, two
of which counted toward a national ranking. This year the
team competed against traditional California opponents
Foothill College and ClaremontMcKenna, and also added
Sonoma State and Redlands to
the list.
After arriving in San Francisco, the team drove to the
sunny but breezy Sonoma Valley to play Division II Sonoma
State on Sunday afternoon.
Faced with tough opponents and
some jet lag the team surrendered all three doubles matches
and was unable to surmount the
deficit in the singles matches.
The doubles teams of Greg
Emkey '99 and Peter Schilla 'Ol

Dennis Mook 'Ol at #3 both held

What's Wrong
With This Picture?

Now you can draw... MARXISM
1. First, draw a feudal
class system. Put a
crown on top: that's
where the king goes!

2. Next, draw "the
beginnings of industrialization. Erase that
crown, kids—the
Third Estate killed the
king! A little capital
here, a little labor
there, and you're
rolling!

3. Give the bourgeoisie some hands with
which to grab hold of
the means of production. Erase that
middle class, and
draw in the raging
discontent of the
oppressed proletariat.

4. Revolution! Turn
your drawing upsidedown! Now the proletariat is on top! Draw

COSA NOSTRA FOR KIDS
Tired of school? Bored on a rainy day? Tired of your parents telling you
what to do? Be the first kid on your block to have your very own shady
underworld. Here's some tips on getting started:
Start small with some racketeering: approach local ice-cream men and
lemonade stands. Let them know some bad kids might rough up their shops,
but you can protect them.. .for a price. If anyone turns you down, kill them.
All gangs need a mysterious initiation rite! Try this variation on tag —a
new member has to ride around the neighborhood at night without his bike
light on. When an adult reminds him it's off, follow them home and kill them.
Remember, nobody ever leaves the gang. If some kid's mom comes to take
him, kill him. And his mom.

KIDS TALK
Dear Spike Junior,
The first of the four horseman of the Apocalypse has been riding for the
last two decades "as a conqueror bent on conquest" (Rev 6:2). A much acclaimed spiritual leader is busily trying to form a one-world religion under his
leadership. Once this leader completes his mission, the next horsemen will
ride out in painfully swift sequence and the effect of their missions will leave
fifteen hundred million people dead or dying. Neither our religious, nor our
civil leaders, are warning our people of these upcoming tragedies of world
war, world famine, and world pestilence, so that they will not be caught by
total surprise. The Scripture reveals that 25% of the earth's population will be
killed and this would mean that over fifty million Americans will be killed or
die of starvation and disease. This spiritual leader will also bring those who
oppose his doctrines under persecution just as was the case during the dark and
middle ages. He will also be powerful enough to exercise a high level of control over the one-world government already existing—the United Nations. Since
the final countdown for our Lord's return is obviously beginning, I pray that
those who are following any leadership other than Christ, the Scriptures, and
the Holy Spirit will burn the billions of books, magazines, and newspapers that
keep them in bondage to the "Synagogue of Satan" (Rev. 2:9 & 3:9) and the
churches of those who are of the spirit of the antichrist. (1 Jn. 2:18, 2:22, 4:3,
&2 Jn. 1:17) Please contact the editor of your paper who has printed this article and thank him or her for they have become one of the workers of the final
harvest. (Mat. 9:38)
Sincerely,
Bro. Raymont Senn

Dear Raymont,
We got your letterfrom ourfriends at The Phoenix. Sure, we know the world
can be a scary place sometimes. But there's not some kind of "anti-Christ"
hiding in your closet. And those shadows on the wall that's just a coat
rack. And even if there were such a bogeyman, keep in mind, 25% dead
means 75% alive. 3-to-l odds we 'd bet on that! As for the billions of books,
magazines, and newspapers Daddy keeps under the bed they're for getting
Mommy in the mood. Not for Satan!
Good luck with the Rapture! We 'll see you up there.
Spike Junior
