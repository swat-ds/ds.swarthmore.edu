George Lakey, the visiting professor in the peace and conflict studies department who now holds the title of Peace Educator of the
Year, engages his students during a seminar.

BY NAVIN SABHARWAL

nsabharl@swarthmore.edu

On Oct. 2, former Eugene M. Lang
Visiting Professor for Issues in Social
Change and current Lang fellow George
Lakey was named the Peace Educator of
the Year by the Peace and Justice
Studies Association (PJSA) during its
conference in Winnipeg, Canada.
According to their website, the PJSA
is a non-profit organization founded in
2001 as a combination of the Consortium
on Peace Research, Education and

Development (COPRED) and the Peace
Studies Association (PSA), groups promoting leadership in the field of peace

and conflict studies. In addition to serving as a professional association for
scholars in the field, the organization
seeks to bring academics and activists
together in order to find alternatives to
violence. The association gives the
Peace Educator of the Year award "for
exemplary teaching and/or great scholarship in forwarding peace education
and peace studies."
At Swarthmore, Lakey is currently
teaching courses in the peace and conflict studies department, including
"Nonviolent Responses to Terrorism,"
"Research Seminar in Non-violent
Struggle and Strategy" and "Peace
Studies and Action," which he co-developed with Lee Smithey, coordinator of
the peace and conflict studies program.
"We are thrilled that Professor
Lakey's teaching and research at
Swarthmore, not to mention his decades
of work as a prominent Quaker peace
activist, organizer and educator, have
been recognized by the Peace and
Justice Studies Association," said
Smithey in an e-mail.

A leader in non-violent change since
the 1960'5, Lakey has held teaching posts
at Haverford College and the University
of Pennsylvania and has led workshops
in social change in five continents.
In the Fall 2007 semester, he was
invited to come to Swarthmore to serve
as the Lang visiting professor for two
academic years. "I'm proud to be at
Swarthmore because we're [proceeding]
in a way that fully empowers our graduates," he said.
He is also the founder and director of
Training for Change, a Philadelphiabased organization that seeks to spread
social change through a system that
directly challenges injustice.
Lakey became interested in and pas-

sionate about social activism when he
was an undergraduate student. "I was
brought up in a pro-union household of
people who cared about community justice, [so] I was slanted in that direction
by my family, [but] it wasn't until college when I put it together that I could
make a difference," he said.
He also cited the civil rights movement as inspiration. "The Montgomery
bus boycott was happening while I was
an undergraduate [...] and I was able to
go to a speech by Ralph Abernathy, who
was a right hand guide to Dr. King, and
hearing him talk about it, I thought that
could be me. These are real people like
me," Lakey said.
As a dedicated activist, Lakey has
worked with workers, civil rights leaders, anti-apartheid activists and human
rights organizers among others. Lakey
is also the author of numerous scholarly
articles as well as eight books, including
"A Manual for Direct Action, Powerful
Peacemaking: A Strategy for a Living
Revolution" and "Grassroots and

December 2, 2010 x

-

Nonprofit Leadership: A Guide for
Organizations in Changing Times."
Lakey's students applaud his engaging courses and unique teaching style.
Matthew Heck 'l3 is currently a member
of his non-violent struggles class. "It's a
seminar where we have to write a case
about a different struggle around the
world each week," he said. "He likes to

tell stories a lot; it's the basis for most of
this teaching. He also relates his theory
and he is able to tie in the theory that we
read into real first hand accounts."
A political science major, Heck was
impressed with how Lakey was able to
broaden his perspective: "I think the
non-violent strategies aspect is something that most poli-sci students don't
get a chance to experience because
we're mostly talking about war and conflict," he said. "Seeing that non-violent
side is nice because [it shows] not everything in the world is war, and peace can
actually be effective too. Learning different cases and learning the theory
from him has really help to make that
salient. It's a great learning experience."
Lakey further discussed how his
classes contribute both to theory and
practice of peace and justice. "The [Nonviolent Response to Terrorism] class is
partly to advance to the field but partly
to
at
empower
the
students
Swarthmore," he said. "Students taking
the [research seminar] will again be
able to stand up to forces in our body
politic that are becoming more and
more cynical in their use of fear to keep
us down."
Though he is no longer the current
Lang visiting professor, Lakey is still
working part-time at the Lang Center in
order to further his research and aid
students in projects.

begin financial discussions surrounding the initiative. Effectively, the proposed program would allow students
to use meals and dining points under
the meal plan to "swipe" for food and

snacks at select Ville locations.
As a student at Swarthmore
College, one quickly becomes very
familiar with the ins and outs of the
meal plan. While the on-campus
options provided by the meal plan are
more than enough to sustain a
healthy and comfortable diet, many
students often find themselves growing tired of them and would like to
diversify their gastronomical options.
"I just wish I could switch it up every
once in a while," Nina Serbedzija 'l4
said.
It is from this growing desire within the student body that Student
Council has recently begun to work
on an initiative to extend the meal
plan to a few of the restaurants and
stores in the Ville.
"Right now, we're looking into the
possibility of instituting a program to
use meal points in the Ville," said
. Financial
Policy
StuCo's
Representative Ben Hattem 'l2 in an
e-mail. "The locations that we've discussed have been Hobbs, Renato's and
the Co-op, but that list could expand
or contract."
At present, there are a number of
logistical barriers to such a move,
such as the cost of equipment (i.e.
card-reading machines), additional
security measures for cards abd the
wiring needed from campus to participating locations, as well as the need
for an additional accounting system
to manage the flow of capital.
In terms of security, the cards
would need to be upgraded such that
swipe access is not simply available
to anyone in possession of a students'
card. "The current card system is not
designed for protecting student's
money," said Stu Hain, Vice President
for Facilities and Services, over the

phone.
Dining Services Supervisor Linda
McDougall said in an e-mail, "The
only Ville merchant who expressed
interest to me [in. such a program]
was Hobbs and this was before they
opened. With our current system,
[meal plan expansion] would be very
difficult logistically."
Hobbs Coffee has made efforts to
be incorporated into the student meal
plan since its establishment nearly a
year ago. Given the large amount of

.December 2,-2QIO

traffic that Hobbs has already had
from Swarthmore students, there is
certainly evidence for plenty of
demand. "When families are here and
when school starts
we're at full
capacity," Randall said.
Randall also mentioned that Hobbs
would even be willing to be lenient as
far as prices, in order to accommodate the college. "Even if we didn't
make a profit," he added.
Other than Hobbs Coffee, no other
Ville restaurants or stores have come
forward and spoken to the college
regarding expansion of the meal plan
at this time.
In addition, the current card-reading system at the college is not a "onecard system" like that of credit cards
(i.e. .each card has a different meal
...

plan).

Therefore, any Ville locations to be
incorporated into the meal plan
would have to also be integrated into
the college's unique meal plan system.
Apart from the logistical ramifications, a meal plan extension would
also require substantial financial
reorganization.
The dining services budget is comprised of two main parts
revenue
and expenses. Under the heading of
expenses are both variable (e.g. groceries and supplies) and fixed costs
(e.g. staff, maintenance and utilities).
Therefore, the proposal to extend the
meal plan into the Ville would
require a detailed estimation of the
change in variable cost.
In addition, the annual budget is
appropriated based on the fixed room
and board fees of each student living
on campus. The incorporation of
Ville locations into the meal plan
(each with varying degrees of student
patronage) represents a variable cost

outside of fixed room and board fees,

posing a significant obstacle to accurately determining the funds necessary to support such a system.
"The annual dining services budget is based'on money, in points, staying on campus to support the [dining]
system," Hain said.
Larger schools around the counUniversity
like
the
of
try,
Pennsylvania, have incorporated
franchises into their respective meal
plans. However, given the small size
of the college, it would be very difficult financially to incorporate a
diverse group of off-campus dining
options. "There aren't very many

small schools our size that do this,"
Hain said.
However, any actual assessment of
the financial feasibility of a meal plan
extension would require extensive
estimation of cost based on student
habits. "We would need to find out
how much students would use it and
what meals they would use it for the
pattern, basically," Welsh said.
Such estimation would most likely
be achieved through a pilot program.
Unfortunately, due to the myriad
logistical and financial obstacles,
such an initiative is not yet in place.
Student Council is continuing discussions with the administration, but for
the time being,, the dining options
remain the same.

Mock trial sees surge in numbers and tournament wins
swarthmorephoenix.com

The Mock Trial A Team placed second out of 52 teams at its third competition of the semester at the University of Pennsylvania in November.
BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Candice Nguyen 'll says Mock Trial

at Swarthmore is a fairy tale of a club,

with unbelievable growth and success.
The idea started with her and Asher
Sered 11 and Jon Schaefer 'll during
their New Student Orientation. The club
only had six members that first'year, the
bare minimum required to compete, but
now that the three founding members
are seniors, it has expanded to 32 members. And the team is not just competing, but winning.
Mock Trial is an event where teams
of students from colleges all over the
country study and practice trying a fictional case. Students play the roles of
either lawyers or witnesses and compete
against other schools, following the procedures of the real judicial system.
Though the team is now doing well, it
had humble beginnings a few years ago.
According to Sered, the team dates
back to a pre-law information session
during his Orientation. Someone asked
if there was a Mock Trial team, and Gigi
Simeone, the pre-law advisor, said that
there wasn't, but that "a very pro-active
freshman" had e-mailed her about it
over the summer. "And Candice was
that freshman," he said.
After the information session, he and
Schaefer, both of whom had done Mock
Trial in high school, went to talk to
Nguyen, and they began to take the steps
towards forming a club. At the time, the
Peaslee Debate Society was the only public speaking activity for students.
"I went to a few meetings, but I didn't
really feel it was the place for me,"
Nguyen said. "I thought that Mock Trial
could be an interesting forum for people
to meet and learn about the way the judicial system works."
She added that the activity is for
more than just pre-law students.
Schaefer and Sered are no longer planning to go to law school.
Getting the group started was difficult for the first-years. "Everything was
an obstacle when we were starting,"
Sered said. He said that "basic logistical
things," like getting chartered, renting
buses and finding and booking hotel
rooms seemed "mysterious."
But they had a steep learning curve,

were chartered that first year, and now
have enough people to form three divisions within the team.
Now, the Mock Trial team is split into
three sub-teams, one called the "A" team,
and two "B" teams. The "A" team is comprised of the members that are expected
to score most highly.
Last semester, Swarthmore won the
Spirit of the American Mock Trial
Association (AMTA) award. "That was
nice, but it was more a You're the team
that everyone liked!' award," Schaefer
said. This semester, there have been
even more awards and recognitions.
tournament,
at
At
the first
Washington and Jefferson University,
six Swarthmore students won awards.
Three won as attorneys, and three won
as witnesses.
At the second tournament at Colgate
University, members of the team won
two more awards. Sered pointed out that
most of the award winners this semester
have been first-year students.
In a third competition, at the
University of Pennsylvania, the A team
finished second place out of 52 teams,
while one of the B teams tied for fourth
place. At the next competition, the teams
placed first and fifth with an attorney on
the B team winning an individual
award.
Sered pointed out that the more highly a team places, the less likely it is that

"Individual awards are given when
you're the best in a particular competition, so if you're on a really good team
you won't stand out as much," he said.
Unlike other teams from larger universities with law schools, the team does
not have a lawyer to. act as its coach. A
local attorney named Stephen Imbriglia
serves in an advisory role, but otherwise the team is largely self-governed.
Because of their experience, Nguyen,
Schaefer and Sered are hugely important to the team, and Rosanna Kim 'l3,
captain of the B team, is concerned that
after they graduate, the team will not be
as strong. "They're a great source of
knowledge, and they give so much support and encouragement." It will be a
young team next year, since it currently
has 22 first-years.
But Klara Aizupitis 'l3, social chair
and outreach coordinator for the team,

has big plans for their future. Next year,
she hopes the team will host its first
invitational meet here at Swarthmore.
She is optimistic about the team and
said, "It's going really we 11... We're a lot

previously. Last year, they were ranked
last, but now they're generating more
positive buzz.
Jeremy Rapaport-Stein 'l4 is glad that
he decided to join the team. "Mock Trial

school. If you're a big law nerd like I am
it's a lot of fun, definitely a lot offun."

Alums from literary magazine to hold event
to have their work right next to the work

BY GAIL ENGMANN

gengmanl@swarthmore.edu

For many current Swarthmore students, the prospect of majoring in the
humanities and continuing their creative
pursuits with the demands of a regular
job in this economy is a serious concern.
Lillian Dunn 'O7, Michelle Crouch 'O7 and
Nick Forrest 'OB have been successful so
far in this pursuit with their creation of
Philadelphia's first all-ages literary magazine, APIARY.
On Dec. 11 from 4 to 6 p.m., the group
will hold a reading event aimed at exposing Swarthmore students to established
writers from the city as well as allowing
them to learn more about the magazine
itself. According to the Chair of the
English Department, Peter Schmidt, students will be able to hear a nice cross section of writings and learn more about
what humanities majors do after
Swarthmore.
The alums wish to expose students to
the talented writers in the Philadelphia
area so that they explore the city's literary scene themselves. Students will also
get a chance to learn about APIARY's
involvement in the community.
The group become an official writing
group last December. The main objectives
of the group are to open up the literary
scene to people who are interested and
connect people from different backgrounds and of all ages. "We want people
with raw voices who are new to the scene

of well established writers," Crouch said.
The word apiary means a place where
bees are kept. At first the founders
thought the word was just catchy and
interesting, but it soon became apparent
that it was a very fitting metaphor for
their work in the literary magazine business. "There are distinct buzzing hives of
people in the literary scene and we want
their honey," Crouch said.
Crouch majored in art history and
minored in English at Swarthmore, after
which she worked for an art gallery in
Philadelphia for a year. She now works as
an archivist at the Stoogeum, a museum
dedicated entirely to the Three Stooges
memorabilia and organizes collections
and documents.
Luckily for her, her job is quite flexible, only requiring her to work 32 hours a
week. Given that, she is able to devote
weekends to creative pursuits and even
found time to take a creative writing
workshop at UPenn. Dunn said that the
alums were in one place with all this
energy and passion, giving them a real
catalyst to create something extraordinary and fill a void in their community.
at
majored
Dunn
in English
Swarthmore and had always loved writing and journalism. Now, as one of the
magazine's main promoters, she is able to
write about what she loves and meet cool
and fascinating people along the way.
Similarly to Crouch, Dunn's jobs as a
freelance editor and substitute teacher

give her the flexibility she needs to
accomplish her duties at APIARY. For her
the magazine serves two main purposes:
make a space for people to get together
and allow people of different communities
to meet.
"We want young people to know there
are older people who write in the community and its fun and cool," Dunn said.

APIARY also allows the members of
different communities and literary scenes
from across the city to make connections
and experience each other's work. Dunn
said they wanted a place for people to
hear different voices which will in turn
enrich their own practice.
"Anyone who writes knows that it can
be an isolating experience, but we're trying to show that it can be a communal
activity and a powerful thing that connects people and allows them to communicate with each other, which makes all
the stress worthwhile," Crouch said.
The third co-founder, Forrest, majored
in English literature and studio art at
Swarthmore. Today he has been able to
build his work schedule around APIARY,
which allows him to do all of the graphic
design for the magazine.
"I'm now in the midst of creating art
and creative writing workshops in local
schools in Philadelphia," he said. He
believes that it is the APIARY's mission
to create a magazine that reflects the actual diversity of the city's literary scene.
The making of the magazine is a collaborative effort. Each member takes part

in promoting, publishing and maintaining APIARY. "It's a lot of work but an
enormous pay-off is getting to read so
much great literature and being able to
see amazing work from people who
haven't published before and see them
continue to publish in the future," Dunn
said.
The first issue, selling for $9, came out
in September, and copies of it are currently in bookstores all oyer the city.
According to Crouch, the group is making
sure that people who don't have exposure
to the literary scene get access to the magazine which is why they try to distribute
them in schools and community centers.
The event being held at Swarthmore,
"Light and Honey," is a merging of APIARY and Light of Unity, bringing together
various established poets and writers
from the area. The line-up includes readings from Dr. Richard Wertime, Paul
Siegell, Jeffrey Ethan Lee and co-founder
Tamara Oakman. After a short overview
of APIARY there will be a Q&A session
with the readers and the co-founders.
There will also be an open mic portion
for anyone in the audience to read their
own work.
The alums are aware that finals are
coming up and time is precious. To interested yet apprehensive students Dunn
said "This amazing reading will blow
your mind, fill your head with great new
ideas and allow you to walk away and
back to your work with a new perspective."

Deciding on graduate school

Applying to graduate or professional school can be an.interesting, exciting,
tedious and overwhelming process, but there are many helpful people and
resources at Swarthmore to advise you including faculty, Career Services, and the
pre-med/pre-law advisor, Gigi Simeone. Deciding to attend graduate school
requires careful thought. Ask yourself:
� Do I really love the field enough to obtain an advanced degree?
� Is an advanced degree required to enter a particular profession or advance
within the field?
� Do I have the financial resources to cover the cost of graduate school?
� Do I need to take some time off from school because I am burned out?
� Am I postponing making a tough decision about a career by going to gradate school?
� Do I want to go to school full time or part time?
�Do I have the personal qualities and skills that are needed to be successful in
graduate school?
� What is the opportunity cost for me? Will it change over time?
� What is the cost benefit of attending graduate school in non financial terms?

When to attend?

Once you have decided that you want to go to graduate school, you need to consider when to attend. Although approximately 90% of Swarthmore College graduates pursue one or more advanced degrees, only about 20% of the senior class
enrolls in graduate programs immediately following graduation. Most
Swarthmore graduates work for a year or more before beginning an advanced
degree. There are pros and cons to both choices.
Choosing to attend graduate school immediately allows for a continuity ofyour
education which may be advantageous since you will still be in "studying mode."
Many students also find it easier to finance graduate school when there are no
other major financial pressures in their lives such as marriage, mortgages, and

children. Undergraduate loans are typically deferred while you are in graduate
school. If you are certain about a career path which requires an advanced degree,
choosing to go to graduate school right away will allow you to enter the profession
sooner than if you took some time off.
Most people who plan to wait a year to explore options actually wait two or
more years. Senior year is so busy many students are unable to do a thorough
graduate school search, so having a year to "shop" around for a school/program
that is best for you would be to your advantage. Exploring during the fall after
graduation is common, but by then, one finds it best to have the experience of a
full year of work and exploration before sitting down to do a highly competitive
application. If you decide to delay grad school admission, consider a postgraduate
work-related fellowship, a post-graduate internship, or a wide range of employment options Career Services and the Fellowship & Prizes office can help. Before
leaving campus, be sure to ask faculty to write letters ofrecommendation on your
behalf you can set up a file in Career Services and ask faculty to update the let."

Timeline

If you hope to enroll in a graduate program the September immediately after
graduation, ideally you will begin your graduate school search in the summer
before your senior year. Application deadlines for September admission will be
between the first of December and mid-January for most competitive programs.
Deadlines to apply for financial aid including assistantships and fellowships are
often earlier. It is best if you apply (with absolutely all admission materials submitted) at least a full month before the deadline—sooner if possible. 50% of applicants apply in the last month and to improve your competitiveness you need to get
your application considered before the rush. Most schools admit students on a
rolling basis and it is best to apply when all of the slots and all of the financial aid
awards are still available. If you wait until the last month, you are competing with
most of the applicant pool, but with only half of the slots still available.

Sleep deprivation may cause flinging of things
There's

been a lot of
flinging of
things lately. The frequency with
which I personally fling
things, particularly
cups of cof-

fee,
has
become

Ariel Swyer
Let's Be Serious

really

incredible.

In fact just
moments
ago, while
recovering
from the labor of creating the first two sentences of this article, I acquired a cup of
coffee and almost out of habit the first
thing I did was pour a large part of it onto
-

the floor.
I was beginning to fear that all of this
was a problem associated only with me
that I had developed some profound and
inexplicable propensity for flinging. But
several weeks ago, after I had flung a full
glass of water at the floor of Sharpies, I

took up the matter with the very nice person who arrived with the mop, and he
informed me that a lot of people had been

dropping things recently. He's right. In
Sharpies, at this point, one is liable to hear

smashes every few minutes.
This mass surrender to gravity could be
due to several things. First of all, the flinging could be an expression of deep, unacknowledged emotions on the part of
Swarthmore students, particularly the
emotion "eeeuuugghh," which is characterized by the tendency of one's brain to make
the sound "eeeuuugghh," instead of doing
other things like, for instance, remembering to grip water glasses. We at
Swarthmore can be so busy learning astrophysics and Scottish dancing, we completely forget to stop and pay attention to what
we are feeling (eeeuuugghh). Instead we
release these feelings by going around
spontaneously flinging our coffee about the
place. This puts everyone at great risk of
being struck by flying objects.
To promote a less hazardous and emotionally healthier environment, I propose
the designation of a wall at which everyone
is specifically allowed to fling things.
Students could smash their coffee cups
against this wall for as long as they wanted

to, thus condensing the flinging into a single safer and more predictable stream of

destruction. Students

would also be

required to spend at least an hour staring
at a tree instead of doing their homework
allowing their brains to go "eeeuuugghh..."
At the end of staring at the tree, if so
inspired, they would be welcome to fling
their coffee at it.
In addition to hampering emotional
awareness, sleep deprivation doesn't tend
to breed motor skills. In fact it doesn't tend
to breed skills of any kind. I have concluded that what we are currently experiencing
at Swarthmore is a dearth of skills.
This applies, of course, to the entire
Swarthmore population and is not in any
way limited to Willets 107 (I hope).

However, in what is a great stroke of misfortune for Willets 107, it happens to be the
place with which I am most familiar and
thus the one upon which I must base my
information. The residents of Willets 107
have noticed a marked deterioration in
communication
skills.
Since
Thanksgiving, the deterioration has been
especially rapid.
It's the sort of situation in which one
could hypothetically board a train in
Vermont as a fairly normal conversation-

alist and eleven hours later find herself
shouting disjointed statements about trees
and Michelangelo at a helpless economics
major from George Washington University
who has sat down in the adjacent seat. This
is the sort of thing that could hypothetically happen. Something needs to be done.
I advocate, along with the institution of
a flinging wall and mandatory tree-gazing,
a forcible increase in student sleep. The
way I envision it, if a student is staying up
past what will afford that student eight
hours of sleep, squirrels break into the
room, grab the student's homework and

bash the student over the head with a stick,

knocking him or her unconscious. If these
measures are not taken, things will continue to get weirder. By the timefinals arrive,
we will have been reduced to a state of
abject chaos with students drifting around
emitting unintelligible garbles of sound
and periodically flinging things at one

another.
Based on what's been seen ofWillets 107,
which has already achieved this state, we
can safely say that it's not so good. So let's
mobilize those squirrels! I'm going to go
now, as there's coffee in my shoe.

It's exactly one more month
before I return to the U.S. as I

abroad in Paris. Now that the culture shock has abated, I've been

4. The weekend philosophy.
Weary of Parisian urbanite pretensions? Why not take off to the
south of France, the Normandy
coast or even to Switzerland for
the weekend? Although I am a
poor student, at least the possibility always exists.
5. The cinematic architecture. Paris is a living cinema set,
wherein each building and street
scene is always ready to be
immortalized in a snapshot. I'll
miss walking past some of the
world's most iconic monuments
and delving into the beautiful,
atmospheric streets here.
6. The reliability and accessibility of the Paris metro. I will
miss being able to hop on the
metro and be guaranteed an efficient arrival at my destination.
7. La bonne bouffe. Otherwise
translated as the "good eats," this

covers the wealth of excellent cuisine that I will miss in Paris. This
means missing the easy availability of freshly baked baguettes,

Senior Co. to perform mythic 'Metamorphoses'

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DINA ZINGARO

dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

This weekend, Senior Company's ensemble of eight

actors will present the play "Metamorphoses," a series

of mythic Greek vignettes with about thirty different
characters. Written by American playwright Mary
Zimmerman, the play draws from the classic Ovid
poem "Metamorphoses," in addition to other fables
and poems interpreted by the playwright.
Following its initial premiere in 1996 as "Six
Myths" at Northwestern, then in Chicago by
Lookingglass Theatre Company and in New York by
Second Stage Theatre, "Metamorphoses" opened on
Broadway at the Circle Square Theater in 2002. It
received nominations for Best Play and won a Tony
Award for Best Direction.
Composed of senior theater majors, the Senior
Company includes senior actors Eva Amesse, Nell
Bang-Jensen, Emily Letts, Isa St. Clair and Brian
Willis, along with dramaturg Joshua Lipman. In theater companies, dramaturgs (or dramaturges) deal primarily with research and development of the play and
serve as consultants for the company. Along with
these Senior Company members, the ensemble
includes guest performers Ben Hattem 'l2, Thomas
Powers 'l3 and Brian Ratcliffe 'IL
Usually, the composition of Senior Company pans
out evenly between student directors, actors and
designers, but this year, five of the six majors wanted
to act. Thus, the cast £hose an ensemble piece where
performers have roughly equal amounts of importance and stage time. St. Clair feels the "very actor
driven piece" complimented the actor-heavy company.
In "Metamorphoses," since there are over 30 characters portrayed by ten or twelve actors, the play
requires actors to play multiple parts. For Senior
Company, with only four female and four male actors,
the students will actually each play a few more roles
than actors from the original production did. Along
with several mythic roles, most of the actors will also
portray the storytellers of the particular vignettes
that compose the play.
Cast as the rainbow goddesses Iris and Myrrha,
along with other characters, Bang-Jensen 'll also portrays various narrators or storytellers, such as a child
acting out a story and a laundress telling a story just
to pass the time. "We all had a lot of fun playing with
all of the narratorial roles in this production and
thinking about why people tell stories; how they shape
the stories they tell, and how they are, in turn, shaped
by them," Bang-Jensen said.
actress
Amesse
that
agrees
Fellow
'll
"Metamorphoses" broaches the importance of storytelling in contemporary culture. "When you are getting to know someone you just tell them a lot of stories
about your life and we talked a lot about how storytelling is such a fascinating thing because it takes
place on so many levels
watching a movie, reading
a book, talking with a friend, being at a big dinner
table. Whether we tell stories to impress or to make
people laugh, stories can achieve so many different
things," Amesse said. .
In choosing the play, Bang-Jensen believes the
"honesty and emotionality in [the] tales" of
"Metamorphoses" appealed to Senior Company.
Though the stories are not realistic with specific modern parallels, she feels that the "emotionality that arises from [the tales] is one that still rings true."
Since the premiere of "Metamorphoses" by Second
Stage Theatre was in its last few days of rehearsal in
New York during September 1L 2001, the cast recognizes the play's exploration of both transformation
and loss in the play.
Though for St. Clair the central thread of the play
is love and its manifestations
filial or romantic
she stresses that the cast realized that "love goes
hand-in-hand with loss." "The metamorphoses that
happen in this play can be just as easily read as deaths
of many different kinds," St. Clair said. "So, for me,
this play is very much a microcosm of a human life or
multiple human lives."
Due to the mythic quality of "Metamorphoses," its
characters can easily become archetypes and mere
emblematic figures who demonstrate a particular,

THE9HOENIX

In September, the ensemble began rehearsing and
as they are nearly all senior theater majors, the actors
were already familiar with each other's strengths,
weaknesses and acting styles. Though Assistant
Theatre Professor Erin B. Mee served as faculty adviser, the actors worked collectively and collaboratively
on "Metamorphoses" without a director.
Funneling all the company members' ideas into one
coherent voice posed quite a challenge. "One of the
strengths of our piece is that it does clearly come from
eight people and there are a lot of perspectives represented, but it does all fit together in one unified piece
of theater," St. Clair said.
Senior Company chose the more intimate and
experimental LPAC Frear Ensemble Theatre with its
black box interior. Smaller than the LPAC main stage,
the black box is essentially a room with all black walls
and no built-in stage or audience seats. Thus, it afforded the company a great deal of artistic license. "If [the
audience] comes expecting a black box, they will be
very surprised," St-Clair said.
The production also includes set design by
Professor Laila Swanson, lighting design by Jessie
Bear 'O9, sound design by Louis Jargow 'lO, costume
consultation by Tara Webb '94 and props design by
Viarica Masucci 'l3 and Logan Tiberi-Warner 'IL

identifiable human trait. "The reason it is written fairly archetypically is because that's what the myths are
in just a single story, it stands for an entire cultural heritage and it has been adapted continuously in
our cultural consciousness for thousands of years
so it does flatten out," St. Clair said.
For actors, though these characters may read as
flat, cheesy or archetypal, the challenge is finding the
character underneath the seeming commonality.
"While these huge themes of transformation, loss and
love are often romanticized and fictionalized, I think
it's rare that people talk about them in a way that
doesn't seem cheesy or flippant," Bang-Jensen said. To
overcome the banality of archetypes, St. Clair tries to
find the core of her character and what makes him or
her human. For the ensemble, she believes that the
cast succeeded in overcoming archetypes. "There are
no archetypes on our stage, and that is fantastic," she
said.
After choosing the play last spring semester, the
cast spent the following months in what St. Clair
describes as a "dramaturgical stage." In these last
weeks of school and over the summer, the students
exchanged ideas, and even had "homework assignments" to come up with questions and find poems,
images, and songs that they associated with the play.

Guest lecturer highlights Tibetan mgur poetry
Today, guest lecturer Professor Roger Jackson
from Carleton College will present an address,
"Amazement Rooted in Azure Sky: Understanding
Tibetan Spiritual Poetry," on the Tibetan literary
genre of mgur.
Mgur, pronounced "goor," are poems that have
been composed by Tibetan Buddhist masters for
thousands of years. Unlike conventional poetry,
mgur are often sung and are spiritual in nature.
Jackson classifies these poems as "songs of realization" which reveal inner thoughts and reflections of
the composer.
Jackson is a Professor of Asian Studies and
Religion at Carleton College and completed his
undergraduate studies at Wesleyan University. His
M.A. in South Asian Studies, and Ph.D. in Buddhist
Studies were completed at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
In his lecture, Jackson will highlight the work of
major Tibetan poets such as Milarepa (1040-1123), a
wandering yogi. He will also focus on verses by
Losang Chokyi Gyaltsen (1570-1662), a tutor to two
Dalai Lamas. "In examining these figures, I will situate them within their social and institutional contexts, but will primarily concentrate on the ways in
which they utilize poetic imagery and rhetoric to
describe their own experience and to impart teachings," Jackson said.
Bk, jd^
Jackson, a longtime reader and writer of poetry
became interested in the study of mgur through his
curiosity in mysticism such as that of the Zen poets
of China and Japan. "When my personal and schol-

arly interest eventually settled on Tibetan
Buddhism, the spiritual songs of Milarepa and his
predecessors in India were waiting for me," Jackson
said.
Mgur is a centuries old poetry form, but one that
has been continued into modern times. Jackson will
also look into the poetry of modern Tibetan
Buddhists such as the renowned Dondrup Gyal (195385). However, modern poetry is not strictly mgur and
Jackson will give insight into the parallels and differences of modern Tibetan Buddhist poetry to mgur.
Mgur continues to be composed today because
Tibetan Buddhist figures are expected to do so as part
of their practice. Poetry still remains a medium for
religious figures to reflect and instruct. "I don't think
mgur are much performed, though
in that sense
it's more of a literary medium now, but I expect that,
as long as there are Tibetans practicing Buddhism,
there will be Tibetans composing mgur," Jackson
said
Jackson has identified key themes of mgur such as
the Buddhists' "critique of worldliness, their exaltation of nature, their celebration of the guru and their
evocation of the natural purity of the mind."
Mgur have been shaped by influences such as traditional BUddhist songs of positive personal experience and of Indian tantric songs. Stylistically, mgur
are varied. Mgur feature meter in their Tibetan form
but retaining this form is precarious when translating into English.
"It's a very tricky matter, translating Dpetry from
one culture to another," Jackson said. "When you
evitably

lose the strong meter that's typical of Tibetan verse,
and because the spiritual songs usually have a didaci

tic element, there inevitably are references that will
be mysterious to the newcomer."
To overcome this challenge, Jackson attempts to
convey the original meanings while transforming its
poetic form that suits English. "The balance may be
impossible to achieve, but there's great satisfaction
in trying."
Hillary Yee 'l4, an international student from
Burma, was exposed to Buddhist verses in hen
upbringing. She explains Burmese and Tibetan
Buddhist practices are different, but describes listening to Buddhist verses as an experience: "A not
calming but you can learn a lot from it and people listening are very attentive," Yee said.
Host Cornell Visiting Professor Sudharshan
Seneviratne, who teaches the course Buddhist
Ideology and Social Response, invited Jackson to
Swarthmore College as he felt Jackson's profound
knowledge on Tibetan Buddhism would be conducive
for his students. "Jackson is one of the few scholars
who is able to read the Tibetan scriptures,"
Seneviratne said.
Seneviratne also felt Jackson's lecture would be
enthusiastically received by a wider group of students, "I personally Witnessed the enthusiasm displayed by the community when Lama Losang was
here two months back," Seneviratne said. The
Venerable Losang Samten's Mandala display af
McCabe and lecture held in September were wellreceived by members of the Swarthmore Community;
Professor Jackson's lecture will shed greater 1
attention on Tibetan Buddhism, an area of growing
interest for many at Swarthmore.
The lecture will take place today from 4:30-6:30
p.m. in. the Scheuer Room.

Coldwave bands combine synth, instruments
BY JOHN OH
joh2@swarthmore.eclu

This Friday, Dec. 3, bands hailing from
across North America, from New York to
Canada to California, will be taking the
stage at Olde Club. The bands all fall into
the Cold Wave genre, which include headliner Xeno and Oaklander from Brooklyn,
Automelodi from Montreal, local
Philadelphia band Void Vision and San
Francisco-based bands Sex Worker and
Psychic Reality.
"I first started thinking about booking
the headliner band, Xeno and Oaklander,
summer," Blaine O'Neill 11, Olde
Club booking director, said. "I wanted an
Olde Club show to focus on Coldwave
genre, which is an underground music
scene that continues to develop. It's an
emerging music movement that is revisiting sounds from French new wave with
a goth aesthetic."
Coldwave music takes its inspiration

,

from French Dark and New wave and
post-punk bands like Joy Division and
The Cure. Many Coldwave bands originated in countries like France and
Britain, but the five bands performing on
Friday demonstrate the expansion of the
genre across the pond.
Xeno and Oaklander, which is comprised of Liz Wendelbo and Sean
Mcßride, have their own studio in
Brooklyn. They exclusively play synthesizers and instruments with an affinity

for Coldwave music, which is a based off
of post-punk music. Xeno and Oaklander
pride themselves on the fact that they use
no digital instruments or recording. In
2009, they released a much-anticipated

album "Sentinelle" on Weird Records.
Automelodi is the main project of
Xavier Paradis. The main element defining his music is the mixture of using real
instruments and electronic sounds.
Vocalist and songwriter Xavier Paradis
has been active in Canada since the late
90s and formed the band in 2006.
Automelodi combines guitars with synthesizers and drum machines to create
another form of Coldwave music.
Void Vision a one-woman band recording with the same publisher as Xeno and
Oaklander: Weird Records. Void Vision
began a few years ago and has gOne
through a number of transitions, both
musically and internally. What started off
as a full band soon became a duo as the
music moved more into Coldwave, synthpop, and minimal electronics genres.
But, after releasing the 7" vinyl single "In
20 Years" Void Vision was reduced to it's
core member and now exists as the solo
project of Shari Wallin.
"At the heart of the music, lies a true
love for technology, craftsmanship,
expression, and experimentation," Wallin
said. "ThOugh the music is somewhat
bleak and apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic at
times, there is an underlying optimism
and spirit in the message that being, to
connect with people in a personal way
and share an excitement for music on a
higher level, as a craft, not a product."
Sex Worker is a one man band that
focuses on punk youth rock. Daniel
Martin-McCormick works both as a
soloist and in a trio. At the Olde Club per'
formance, he will be performing by himself. The underlying message beneath
some of his music has a strong anti-sex

necessarily pick up on that while listening to his music, you definitely get the
vibe of the message. He has recently

released "The Labor of Love," considered
his best%ork in terms of dark music by
critics like Spinner Magazine.
JsJPsychic Reality is also a one-woman
band comprised of Leyna Noel Tilbor.
Leyna started Psychic Reality in March
2009 using broken down electronics like
an eighties Omnichord and an old
Yamaha keyboard pushed through a loud
tube amp and a subwoofer.
**My goal in starting PR then was to
push the envelope sonically by putting
forth aggressive heavy bass and noisy

sound that, as a solo female performer as
well, bucks notions of gender and gendered notions of music," Tilbor said.
"Now, though, in 2010 my mode of operating has shifted again, towards clarity in
the vocals and a really danceablebeat. I'm
into dance music the most, and I use the
ghettotech drum machine to make my
beats."
Tilbor has a new record about to come
out on Not Not Fun called "Vibrant New |
Age." "It's an ebullient dance record with
a few twists I feel really good about. I i
recorded it all to tape, mixed to tape and
mastered it direct to vinyl so it's
remained an analog exercise in warmth

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Hanna Kozldwska
Year: 2012
From: Brooklyn, NY and Warsaw, Poland
Current Residence: Pittenger
What She's Wearing:
"[The] sweater with numbers on it [is] from
Goodwill [and] the leopard print scarf... I got on the
street," Kozlowska said. She found her brown suede
boots at a thrift store and her bow earrings were a
present from a friend. Kozlowska paired her black
tights with Gap rolled-up denim shorts and a plain
white tank top. Her "circa-1960s coat" is a hand-medown from her stepmother.
Though the picture may not do the sweater justice,
Kozlowska's navy and red cardigan features quirky
gold buttons with numerals 1 through 5, which is
such a cool alternative to the typical button. She
loves the "nautical combination of navy and red" of
her cardigan, but punches it up with the white tank
and her leopard print scarf. As the temperature is
steadily transitioning from fall to winter, Kozlowska
pairs her warm-weather denim shorts with tights,
boots and her coat.
How She Describes Her Personal Style:
"It really changes from day to day," Kozlowska
said. "One day it can be very 60s-inspired, mod [and]
sort of London 1960s look. But, the next day I could
wear like a colorful sweatshirt that my friend
designed." Kozlowska's chameleon style ranges from
classic to mod to funky and colorful, making it difficult for her to pinpoint a specific "style." But,
Kozlowska loved to dress up at a very young age. "I
always had my own thing [and] went through different phases," Kozlowska said, who would only wear
dresses when she was very little. Now, her sophisticated childhood style has transitioned into a quirky,
classic and mod style.
Fashion Influences / Inspirations:
"[The] 1960s as an era in general," Kozlowska said.
Her love of the mod, London style is very much
reflective of the 1960s aesthetic. She also "adores"
Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin,

Where She Shops:
Kozlowska frequents the usual
thrift store haunts, like Goodwill
and vintage stores in New York.
But,
she also likes "Urban
Outfitters [and] chain stores like
Gap, Zara, H&M [and] Forever 2L"
When Kozlowska goes to Warsaw for
breaks, she likes to shop at stores
there, especially since she has a
friend who designs clothing, such as a
neon-colored sweatshirt. Though
stores like Roxy and Volcom tend to
market the bright surf and ski clothing, Kozlowska likes incorporating the
colorful duds into her summer outfits
and likes their ski attire for her winter
ski trips.
Favorite Items in Her Closet:
"I have this, like, Jackie O black blazer with a round collar. It's cropped with
big buttons, which I found somewhere in
Poland a really long time ago," Kozlowska
said. She also wears shorts with tights and
incorporates a bow into all of her outfits,
such as her pink, diamond-encrusted earrings.

Wardrobe Staples:
"Tights and shorts, definitely. That's like
my uniform," Kozlowska said. She also loves
cardigans and pairing them with plain tank tops, like
her white tank. "Oh, and scarves. I always have a
scarf," she said. "It can be either the leopard print
one or if I want to add a little Polish accent, I put, like,
a traditional floral scarf on."

us toward the series' inevitable con- j
elusion.
What "Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows-Part 1" has shown is
that the filmmakers are finally taking
the book seriously and doing their job
in adapting the book. A film adaptation need not necessarily be an exact I
chronological transcription of events
of the book but must effectively cap- j
ture its tone and vision. This film has
finally proved that its filmmakers are
up to the task. It is in the dark tone
and perhaps the creepy nude make-out
scene of Ron's fears between Harry
and Hermione, as displayed by the evil
powers of the locket horcrux when it
is finally opened, that the film shows
the maturity of its characters and
establishes itself as a legitimate epic
drama film.
So what awaits Harry, Hermione,
Ron and the wizarding world in Part
2? Those of us who have read the
books already know-; what remains to
be seen is whether the filmmakers will
continue to successfully reflect the
tone and spirit of the books. And we
all must wait until the second part is
released in July to discover whether
the film can offer a satisfying ending
to Harry's on-screen journey.

Think globally, shop locally: Black Friday in Philly
It has become the widely
adopted view that the term
applied
"Black Friday"
to the (shopping) day after
Thanksgiving

color from the effect it has
on retailers, pushing them
out of the red and into the
black for the year. But its
usage with regard to this
specific Friday has a much
more local historical context: The Philadelphia
police department coined it
in the mid-1960s to describe
day
the
between

and
the
Thanksgiving
Army-Navy football game,
a day notorious for horrible traffic and pedestrian congestion throughout the city. Nowadays, more than traffic, the
mention of Black Friday conjures images of department
stores and behemoth malls besieged before sunrise by
patrons so consumed with sleep deprivation and the spirit
of the day that they might trample someone.
"Black Friday" may have its roots in Philadelphia traffic, but it has become a popular bellwether for the trajec-

tory of the US economy. This year, as the country continues to wend through an economic funk, the main question
is: Will this holiday shopping season return better sales
figures than the past two years? From their Black Friday
investigations, major newspapers around the country are
reporting significant sales increases over last year.
Consumers describe themselves as spending more and
being more willing to spend. If the stock market is driven
by optimism and pessimism, things are looking up.
How should you spend your holiday dollar? As locally
as possible. Buying local keeps significantly more cents on
the dollar in the community where you spend. If you order
from a national online retailer, you'll feed the national
economy, as well as the economy of whatever country
which may or
manufactured what you bought online
may not be the US. If you buy a Shellbark Hollow Farms
crottin de chevre cheese ($7-$9) at the Swarthmore Co-op,
the money you spend will stay concentrated within a 20mile radius. In a non-food sense, "buy local" is also taken
to mean, "shop at small businesses in your community."
If you just want to pick up biscotti or a lovely pair of
candlesticks, shopping in Swarthmore will suffice.
However, if your holiday shopping list is more extensive
or more eclectic, pick up a SEPTA Independence Pass ($11)
and let the train take you where you want to go. There are
plenty of shopping districts in Philadelphia; here are
details on two of the most accessible areas in Center City.
Rittenhouse Square, the area roughly between Walnut
and Spruce Streets and west of Broad, has it all and is
home to some of Philadelphia's most expensive restaurants (Le Bee-Fin, 1523 Walnut Street) and penthouses. The
area around Rittenhouse Square Park is Philadelphia's
version of sth Avenue in New York; if you're looking for
Zara, Armani Exchange, BCBG, H&M, Coach, etc., this is
where to come. Premium Steep (111 S. 18th St.) has tea and
everything tea related, as well as clever houseware. On the
same block, Di Bruno Brothers' largest location (103 S. 18th
St.) is a gourmet food emporium
if you like cheese, it's
worth stopping in just for samples. For hand- and locallymade jewelry and accessories, stop by Tselaine (1927
Walnut St.). Knit Wit (1718 Walnut St.) has a well-curated
collection of beautiful and expensive women's clothes; if
you go in with a few hundred dollars to drop, the saleswomen will be very helpful. Right on the Square are
Anthropologie and Barnes & Noble. If you like Urban
Outfitters and have never been into Brooklyn Industries,
check out the new branch at 1525 Walnut St. Omoi (1608
Pine St.) that carries men's and women's clothes, stationery, and Japanese knick-knacks very popular with
young adults in Philadelphia. Just off of Broad Street at
1428 Walnut is Lush Cosmetics, a British company that
body products made with highsells handmade bath
quality natural, often organic and Fair Trade, ingredients.
Some of their products bear the V for certified vegan-safe.
(If you have a problem with perfumes or other strong
odors, steer clear of this store.)
To get to Rittenhouse, get off the train at Suburban
Station at 17th & JFK; walk south on 16th, 17th, or 18th
Street (the first street you cross should be Market if it's
Arch, you're going the wrong way) until shiny boutiques
dominate. Rittenhouse Square is between 18fh and 19th,
&

12

between Walnut and Spruce. If it's freezing or you want to
do maximum shopping with minimum walking, the
Liberty Place Mall at 17th & Market is home to the major
national brands that don't have boutiques in the
Rittenhouse area, like J. Crew and Express.
Just a few blocks east of Rittenhouse is the City Hall
neighborhood. Granted, there are the shops at the Gallery
at Market East and the Burlington Coat Factory, but when
you emerge from Market East Station, the area doesn't
scream, "Shop here." Explore beyond Market Street, however, and there are a growing number of small shops
worth exploring. Cross Market at 13th and keep walking
south until you find Marcie Turney and Valerie Safron's
little empire: Grocery, a gourmet grocery with both hot
and salad bars to trump Whole Foods, at least in quality;
Open House, a home good store; Verde, a florist's, chocolatier's and accessory shop all in one; and three restaurants: Bindi, modern Indian; Barbuzzo, new Italian; and
Lolita, modern-Mexican-BYOT (bring your own tequila).
All of this and more make the 100 block of 13th Street a destination in its own right. A great resource for moderately
priced handmade jewelry, bags and other accessories,
Verde is possibly the star of the block. At the back of the
shop, watch Turney and her assistants make sumptuous
chocolate truffles destined for the display case near the
register. Chocolates are $2 a piece; flavors change seasonally, and many ingredients are sourced locally. The seasonal mix or Turney's chocolate barks topped with fleur

de sel, granola, dried berries and other wonderful things
would make excellent small gifts.
Another destination in the City Hall area is Center
City's premier commercial-historical destination, Reading
Terminal Market (51 N. 12th St, between Filbert & Arch).
The famous indoor market opened in 1892. Only open until
5 or 6 PM depending on the day, Reading Terminal Market
buzzes at lunchtime as the downtown work crowd pours in
to choose from a wide variety of delicious, inexpensive
food. If you're looking for a gift that's smaller than a breadbox and not electronic, there's a good chance it can be
foundhere. The market offers free live music, among other
events; check ReadingTerminalMarket.orgibr a calendar.
To get to the City Hall area, get off the train at Market
East Station. The nearest exit from the train tends to be
the Philadelphia Convention Center, which will put you on
Market Street between 11th and 12th. Wherever you

=—

emerge, you will be in the City Hall neighborhood. As you
stand on Market Street, City Hall and higher street numbers lie to the west; Perm's Landing, Old City, and New
Jersey lie to the east. If you stop to shop in Rittenhouse
first, just walk a few blocks east to get to the City Hall
neighborhood. It won't matter which train station you use
to return to Swarthmore; the fare zone is the same, so get
off at Market East and back on at Suburban Station if it's
more convenient.

Neutrality agreement for inn project needs college's support
Although many components of the Town
Center West Development Project
more
commonly known as the inn project
may
still be in the planning stages, it is not too
early for the college to take a definitive
stand on workers' rights.
In seeking to ensure a fair workplace
when the inn is built, the Swarthmore
Labor Action Project has attempted over
the past two years to get the college to support a card check neutrality agreement,
which is a more streamlinedandfairer way
for workers to gain union representation.
There are two ways that unions can
legally be recognized in the country:
through National Labor Relations Board
elections or a "card check." An NLRB election is a typically slower process than a
card check system.
More importantly, however, several
reported cases suggest employers in a preNLRB election period have delayed elections, fired pro-union workers, threatened
to close the worksite, threatened to cut
wages and benefits and held one-on-one
"meetings" with employees all in an effort
to intimidate workers out of voting for a
union. The grimmer reality is that this calculated intimidation does, in fact, scare
workers out of voting for union representation in several cases.
The card check system is typically
paired with a neutrality agreement. As a
legal contract between employer and workers, this agreement calls for civility
between the two sides: The employer agrees
to neither endorse nor discourage union
representation, just as employees agree to
not disrupt the flow of the business with
actions such as boycotting or striking.
We support a card check neutrality

the college should explicitly endorse the
principles of a card check neutrality agreement because it will more effectively safeguard against employer abuses and ensure

to voters because the message seems simple: we must keep spending under control
and the best way to do this is to decrease

the size of government. It is essential that
mainstream alternatives to right-wing
policy proposals are available in these
cases.
But right now in America there are
none. Instead of telling his own story, the
president reluctantly implements some
Republican ideas and in doing so deprives
himself of a message of reason and hope
that could win him re-election in 2012.
In The Netherlands political parties
that are not right-leaning can't get away
with following rightist rhetoric to score
some quick minor victories. If one leftist
party did, it would lose a large chunk of
its supporters to another leftist party.

And Americans who disagree with

back into the widespread view that the
left has no good plans for how to get the
economy back to a sound state.
At this point you might wonder how

increasingly, Democrats are convinced

think tanks have written bravely proposes two reasonable measures that will be

To be fair, these proposals originally
come from a commission set up by U.S.
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who is willing to consider non-mainstream ideas to
save money. Yet, still, the Obama administration has refused to consider further
defense cuts.
In The Netherlands both tax increases
and a large cut in spending on the military are on the tables and have a good
chance of becoming enacted in the law,
but in the U.S. this seems far from feasible
given the current political "atmosphere."
It's becoming increasingly difficult for
me to explain the unwillingness of
Americans to raise taxes or reduce
defense expenditures other than through
the bipolar nature of American politics,

which offers voters such limited choice.
Of course, the alternative proposals
are not limited to raising taxes and
decreasing defense spending.
Recognizing the American Society of
Civil Engineers' conclusion that fully
"two-thirds of U.S. roads are in poor or
mediocre condition," for instance, it recommends putting people to work to repair
the badly deteriorating infrastructure
around the United States. In the long run,
this will save costs as investment in roads
will reduce the need for expensive emer-

gency repairs.
The final note that I want to leave you
with, then, is to convince yourself that

there are reasonable alternatives to cutting, cutting and cutting more expenditures by reading the recommendations in
"Investing in America's Economy."

Second deer cull in Crum approved
To the Editor:
Swarthmore College has received permission from the Pennsylvania Game
Commission to conduct a cull of the deer
population in the college's Crum Woods for
a second consecutive year. This year's cull
is scheduled to take place during the college's winter break, from mid-December

through mid-January.
In planning for this initiative the college
has once again taken extensive measures to
ensure the safety of all who use the woods.
Highly trained sharpshooters who are
Pennsylvania Game Commission licensed
professionals will conduct the cull at preapproved sites. The areas in which the cull
will take place will be posted for the duration of the cull, which will occur during

times when there is little traffic in the
woods.
In 2003, a Conservation and Stewardship
Plan for the Crum Woods was completed by
Natural Lands Trust and Continental
Conservation. That report concluded that
an overabundance of deer headed the list of
factors threatening the woods. Excessive
deer browsing is severely limiting the ability of the forest to regenerate naturally and
is altering the structure and composition of
the forest. For example, deer are consuming nearly all of the native oak saplings. As
old oak trees age and die, there are few
younger trees left to grow and fill in the
canopy and to provide habitat for other animals. Non-native plant species that are not
part of the deer diet are replacing the native
species in the woods.
Following
the delivery of the

Conservation and Stewardship Plan, the
College's Crum Woods Stewardship
Committee engaged in research and consultation with the local and college communities to consider options for managing the
deer population in order to restore the
ecosystem of the Crum Woods. Following
an extensive review process, the College
concluded that the most humane, forest-science-based and socially responsible way to
manage the deer population in the Crum
Woods is to cull the herd.
The results of population management
measures on the health and vitality of the
overall forest ecosystem are actively being
studied at the college. A research-based
monitoring program, designed and implemented by Roger Latham of Continental
Conservation (and former Swarthmore
biology professor), is assessing the forest
ecosystem's response to the reduced number of deer in the woods. This research primarily studies the health and number of
plants in the woods with a focus on the
native species that deer are most likely to
consume. Further information about the
research that has been conducted in the
woods regarding the deer population is

Maybe.

And here's where Manny Pacquiao
comes in, the man who "could" be the
one to do the unimaginable and make
boxing relevant again
with as many
asterisks, quotations marks and italics
as you would care to put in to emphasize the "could" part of it. Pacquiao,
aside from being the guy who sang
"Imagine" with Will Ferrell, is a
Filipino fighter who is recognized as
the current pound-for-pound* best
boxer on the face of the Earth. If you're
reading this and you're a* guy, he probably weighs less than you do, but over
the past year he has climbed to the top
of his sport nearly without resistance,

defeating
oppono, obliterating
nents who outweighed him by as much
as twenty pounds.
*Basically, a system devised to compare fighters across different weight
classes. Of course, these rankings are
computed by about a hundred sources
with a hundred sets of criteria.

Somewhere in all that could lie some
insight into boxing's problem.
Horatio Alger could probably have
settled on just about any boxer there
ever was if he were searching for a new
subject, but Manny Pacquiao's story
would have proven especially tempting.
Abandoned by his father, he separates
from his five siblings to lighten the load
on his mother. Legend has it that he had
tried out for a local boxing team before
he left, but had been rejected, which is
sort of like when Michael Jordan couldn't make the roster of his high school
basketball team. He moves to Manila as
a teenager and first gets into boxing
while living on the streets. After a
friend and fellow boxer named Eugene
Barutag passes away, Pacquiao decides
to go pro at the age of sixteen. He
weighs 98 pounds.

Joe Posnanski of Sports Illustrated
once wrote something about Roger
Federer that fits Pacquiao like a glove.
Posnanski wrote that Federer's greatness was unique in that it could be

appreciated

by everyone. In other
words, if you were watching the first
tennis match of your life, you could
watch him play and find yourself
unable to take your eyes off the screen,
and if you were John McEnroe and you
had been involved in some of the greatest matches in the history of the game,
you could watch him play and be just as
enthralled. Which is why if anyone can
save boxing on style, it's Pacquiao, who
is aesthetically pleasing enough to
seduce the casual fan while causing Bob
Arum, a promoter who witnessed Ali
when Ali was Ali, to declare him the
greatest boxer he has ever seen.

Still, it wasn't enough: He wanted more.
He knew there was more in him. In 'O7,
he got his high school diploma and
started taking college courses in business management in his hometown.
Later that year, he decided to run for a
seat in the House, the same people who
honored him after he beat Barrera, only
he lost. He regrouped. He decided to run
again two years later with a party
called the People's Champ Movement.
His opponent was part of a family that
has been in power for thirty years.
Pacquiao won twice as many votes as he
does. He is still a congressman today.

Pacquiao comes out looking good, and

*Not the worst thing a boxer has ever
said about an opponent, by a long shot.
Strike three.
You could say that Pacquiao has
lived a life of contrasts, and it wouldn't
be far off. A professional fighter who
doubles as a politician, a penniless boy
from the streets who pours his new
wealth back into his community, the ne
plus ultra in a sport that thrives on
aggression who is soft-spoken and humble. All of it held up by an unshakable
Christian faith, which infuses every
part ofhis life, outside the ring but also
within it: Every day, when his training

finished honing the craft of beating men
with his fists, he will ask for a couple
minutes of silence. Then he will pray.

could make saving boxing that much
easier may be denied us just as more

But perhaps we should leave worries
about the future to Pacquiao the congressman. For now, though, whether it
be for only two, three, five, or ten more
fights, Pacquio the Savior is still among
us, ready to step into the ring to attempt

Senior Spotlight: Sarah Lambert
BY VICTOR BRADY

the art of passion

Conference Finals against Franklin
Marshall, Lambert came out firing
on her serve, running off six consecutive points to knot the third set at 22
before the Diplomats would take the
next three points.
Lambert was quickly thrust into a
leadership role with the volleyball
program. When Lambert was a sophomore, the team only had eight players, four of whom were first-years.
She joined in with the upperclassmen and has led by example since.
"Slam was a great captain. She
was always on top of things that
needed to be done. She was really
dedicated to the team and wanted to
see the team succeed as a whole,"
Brone Lobichusky 'l4 said.
"Slam loved our team and the
sport so much and that really
showed. She really led by example,
by always working her hardest and
doing everything in he power for our
team. Her dedication was a big factor
in our team's success," Kat
Montemurro 'l3 said.
"[She] was not only a great leader
on the court, but off the court we all
looked to her. She was always organized, planning team activities, travel
schedules and even some practices
she was the heart of our team,"
Montemurro added.
Lambert is a model ofconsistency
both in games, with her serve, poise
and leadership, and in practice. She
is regularly the first one in the gym,
setting up the net before each practice.
That consistency extended into
the mental aspects of the game as
well. In a sport dominated by runs,
hard hitting and fast paced action, it
was that calm collectedness that
allowed Lambert to keep not only
herself but her entire team poised
through a match.
Though Lambert hardly said anything when she first met Chwastyk,
it is her words of inspiration that her
teammates say they will miss most
next year whenLambert is no longer
there to take the court.
"I'll miss her inspirational words
at the beginning of each game," said
Allie Coleman 'l3, who shared time
at the setter position with Lambert
this year.
"[Lambert] was the best cheerleader on the team always yelling
and getting everybody pumped up.
Her team spirit is definitely going to
be a loss to the team. I liked Slam's

the lone
senior on an up-and-coming volleyball team this'past season, co-president of the Student-Athlete Advisory

at Swarthmore athletic events.

engaging personality, enthusiasm,
and that ever-present smile.

first met
Lambert,
who has led
the
Swarthmore volleyball team from
near the bottom of the Centennial

national recognition, she was a little
more quiet and reserved.
"I still remember the first time I
met Sarah," Chwastyk said. "She
barely said two words and she
seemed to be a very down to earth

person."

At Swarthmore, Lambert, behind

constant dedication and remarkable
school spirit, blossomed into the
emotional leader of the volleyball

team.

"She has exceeded every single
one of my expectations," Chwastyk
said. "Not everything comes easy to
her, but she works incredibly hard
and she's found playing time every
year because of that."
Even in her maturity, Lambert
remains a child at heart, according
to
Chwastyk,
who describes
Lambert's love of coloring and coloring books.
Lambert defines versatility on the
volleyball court. She has played
nearly every position while at
Swarthmore, from outside hitter to
setter. But a constant throughout her
Swarthmore career has been her
serving ability, a weapon which has
plagued opponents for the past four
years and propelled the Garnet to
some of its biggest wins in program
history.
Against
Haverford in the
Centennial Conference semifinals
this past November, it was behind
the golden palm of Lambert that the
Garnet advanced to the first
Centennialfinals in program history
and knocked off the four time
defending champion Fords.
Down 2-1 and tied at 24 in the
fourth set, Lambert subbed in and
pushed the Garnetto the lead to force
a fifth set. In that tie-breaking set,
Lambert served out the fmal three

It was the culmination of a bril-

liant career, during which she
amassed 132 aces, tied for fifth most
in program history, with school spirit, skill and four years of hard work
intertwining into a once-in-a-lifetime
moment.

"Lambert has consistently been
one of the strongest servers for the
last three years... at least for the last
half of the season, our lineup was set
so that Sarah was one of our first
servers," Chwastyk said.
Lambert's serve is aggressive but
more of a float serve than a hard
drive, almost ironic coming from the
senior who is affectionately known
as "Slam." She is consistently able to
drop it in between defenders and
right along the back line.

Swarthmore career. From her work
with the Swarthmore mascot
Phineas the Phoenix to her mentoring of a young volleyball team to her
constant support of her fellow athletes, it is difficult to think of
Swarthmore athletics without immediately thinking of Lambert as well.
"With a lot of players, you see
them grow and mature. But what I'd
say with Sarah is that she still has
that little bit of kid in her,"
Chwastyk said. "I think that lends
itself to the school spirit. She really
enjoys all the opportunities that
she's had and has a greater perspective. She's very mature but
still young at heart."

Women's basketball wins four in a row, now 4-1

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY RENEE FLORES

rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

Responding to a disappointing loss in the season opener against Widener, the Swarthmore women's basketball
team has won four games in a row, including two impressive Centennial Conference performances.
At the Swat Tip-Off Tournament on November 21, the
Garnet bested Immacalata 70-66. in the Championship
Game, having snuck past Misericordia the day before.
Swarthmore followed up that home championship
with a dominating road-victory over Dickinson to open
Centennial play and a strong 75-66 win at home against
defending Centennial-champion McDaniel.
Against the Dickinson Red Devils, Kayla Moritzky 'l4
led the team with a game high 21 points, including an
acrobatic and-one-layup as time expired in the first half of
Play
Kathryn Stockbower 'll put up another double-double
with 20 points and 14 rebounds. Stockbower recorded 16
double-doubles out of 25 games played in the 2009-10 season. Katie Lytle 'l4 played a solid game, recording six
points, five rebounds, three steals and two blocks.
Swarthmore's defense made a strong showing in the
second half, recording four blocks, five steals and 29
defensiverebounds as the Garnet won 63-49.

Looking to extend the winning streak to four games on
Tuesday, the Garnet took a four point lead into the half
before the Green Terror responded to take a three point
lead midway through the second half.
But the Garnet senior leaders responded, with Ceylon
Bodur 'IL who led the team with a game-high 17 points,
draining a long three and Stockbower adding an and-one
to give the Garnet a lead it would never relinquish.
In her first game of the season, Genny Pezzola 'l2
recorded six points, while Lytle scored 11 and Madeline

Ross 'l3 added seven.
After that initial loss to Widener, the team has worked
hard to get on track, playing together as a unit and powering through every game. The team went Into the second
game of the season against Misericordia with the mindset
of that being the start of the season.
"We take it four games at a time, hoping for a 4-0
among those four games. We focus on what we do well and
then capitalize on it. Swarthmore has been known as an
academic school, but we're here to make a statement,"
said Ross in response to the recent success of the team.
But despite the recent success, head coach Renee
DeVarney is only cautiously optimistic. "It's too early to
mean anything right now," she said.
The team agrees that the preseason poll, in which the
team was picked sixth, behind both Dickinson and

McDaniel, holds no meaning once the season actually
starts. "They ranked us in terms of what we had last year.
They didn't take into account our first-year class. But, this
year I think we have everything we need," Moritzky said.
"We want to play like we know how to play. When we
go into the locker room at the end of a game, we want to
be proud of how we played," Ross said.
Despite injuries in the beginning of the season, the
team is performing well. First-year Liz Casey is still
recovering with an ankle injury, but the team hopes she
will be returning to play soon.
Lytle also had a preseason leg injury but has been
lighting up the court since. Against McDaniel, she was a
sharp 3-4 from the field and 5-6 from the line.
"We got better every game," DeVarney said. "I just
want to see [the team] get better every day and have fun
in the midst of the struggle."

The team has a series of three more Centennial games

prior to December Break. Swarthmore travels to
Muhlenberg tonight before returning home for matchups
with Ursinus and Washington.
The team is not worried about the upcoming conference games, feeling confident that they will play well.
"I think we can win [the next three games], and that's
the exciting part," Moritzky said.
Tip-off with Muhlenberg tonight is scheduled for 7:30.

Garnet men look to rebound after three consecutive losses
BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

Despite some exceptional individual
performances, the Swarthmore men's basketball team displayed just a little bit too
much inconsistency over the last week
and a half. After soaring out to a 3-0
start—one of the best in school history—the Garnet dropped close games to
Washington & Lee, Dickinson (in the
Centennial Conference opener) and
Moravian this past Monday.
escaping
against
After
Clark
University with a 69-66 win that involved a
late game rally from 13 points down in
their first game of the Equinox Classic, the
Garnet ran into a strong Washington &
Lee Generals team. A back-and-forth game
ended with a 59-45 Garnet loss.
Falling behind by 16 points early in the
first half didn't help the Garnet, although
Ryan Carmichael 'll and Sam Lacy 'll
both helped to spark rallies that turned
that deficit into a 42-41 lead with 8:35 left in
the game.
Will Gates 'l3 added 15 points and 10
rebounds for a double-double, leading all
players in both categories. Unfortunately,
this was not enough, as the Generals went
on an 18-3 run to end the game.
Before leaving for Thanksgiving break,
the Garnet opened up Centennial
Conference play with a trip to Dickinson,

of his own.
Coach Lee Wimberly thought this was a
winnable game, pointing out that the
defense held the Red Devils' three leading
scorers to single digits in points.
However, he was concerned with the
guardplay, noting that three young guards
for Dickinson scored 42 points. Lacy
agreed, saying, "They got easy penetration
all game. Almost all of theirpoints were off
the drive."
Wimberly believes the guards are capable ofbetter play than they showed against
the Red Devils. While the defense needs to
improve, the offensive flow needs to as
well. Gates thinks more people need to
score: "In our two wins over Clark and
Widener, we got a lot of scoring from many
different people. I think that was our
downfall in the Dickinson game. In our
wins we had 3-4 people in double figures
and against Dickinson only 2."

,

"We need to get scoring from somewhere other than Will Gates. We need
more reliable scoring from the supporting
cast. As good a scorer as Will is, it can't be
a one-man show. Other guys need to step
up," Lacy added.
More people did score Monday night
against Moravian, but the Garnetfell 87-79
in a game high on fouls, with 67 free throw
attempts between the two teams. The
offense was still heavily reliant on Gates,
who scored 31 points to tie his career best.
The Garnet also received 13 points from
Jay Kober 'l4 and 12 from Carmichael.
The game was a tale of two halves for
the Garnet, who fell behind early again,
this time spotting the Greyhounds 22
points in the first half before warming up.
Down 49-31 after the first half, the Garnet
rallied to cut the deficit to seven late in the
second half, but that was as close as the
team would get.
Gates' consecutive 30-point games is
one of the greatest scoring performances
in Swarthmore men's basketball history.
He is the first player in program history to
score 30 back-to-back, and now has three
30-point games in his career.
The Garnet travelled to Muhlenberg
Wednesday night in a critical Centennial
Conference matchup. Although the Mules
were a preseason pick to make the
Centennial playoffs, the Garnet still went
for the win.
Wimberly believes that Muhlenberg's
gym is one of the toughest places to get a
road win in the conference.
Despite that, the team needed the win.
Lacy said, "We need to play better on the
road. It sounds simple, but we need to beat
them no matter whether the game is in our
gym or theirs. We won't make the playoffs
if we can't beat teams on the road."
Unfortunately, the Garnet's first true
road win of the season was not to be, as
Swarthmore fell to the Mules Wednesday.
After going down 16 points at the half at
Muhlenberg, the Garnet valiantly battled
back, taking a one point lead in the final
minute before the Mules rallied for a 59-58
win.
The Garnet now begins a Centennial
homestand before December Break. The
next game is on Saturday, December 4,
against Ursinus at Tarble Pavilion. Tip-off
is scheduled for 3:00. The Garnet concludes the 2010-part of the season against
Washington College on Wednesday.

First-years rule the pool Hockey for Thanksgiving
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS

aapostol@swarthmore.edu

After defeating Franklin &
Marshall for the first time in four
years two weeks ago, the
Swarthmore Garnet men's swim
team cemented its reputation as a
juggernaut in the Centennial
Conference. After several individual
wins in last weekend's Rowan Invite
(a meet without team scoring), the
men rolled to their fourth dual meet
win of the season last Tuesday,
handing the Ursinus Bears a 147-113
drubbing as Swarthmore remained
undefeated on the season.
Overlooked in the men's dominant start to the year, however, is
the fact that the women
not
expected to have much of an impact
in the conference after losing AllAmerican Anne Miller 'lO to graduation
recorded their second conference win of the season on
Tuesday, against just one loss. The
143-119victory over Ursinus came on
the heels of several strong individual showings at Rowan, and the
team's unexpected success can be
almost entirely attributed to the performances of the class of 2014.
Becky Teng, Erin Lowe, Maggie
Regan and Sarah Eppley may only
have a few months of Swat life
under their collective belt, but the
first-year quartet has wasted no
time in making a major impact on
the Garnet athletics scene. Adding
versatility and speed to a team badly
in need of a jolt, Lowe, Teng, Eppley
and Regan have rendered the future
of the women's swim team much

brighter, consistently racking up
points in a variety of events.
"It's been surprising," said tem-

porary head coach Casmera Wick.
"There was a lot of talk going into
the season about Anne Miller not
being here, and we also lost Casey
[Osborne] and Claire [Shelden], but
with our freshman women
those
four have definitely brought a lot to
the table."
Teng, in her rookie campaign, is
the Garnet's winningest swimmer of
the season to date, having won six
events in her first four collegiate
dual meets. A graduate of New
York's Bronx High School of
Science, she's given the team outstanding production in a variety of
events. She has scored points for
Swarthmore in every event except
for butterfly and distance freestyle
and has also contributed to both
freestyle and medley relays.
"Swarthmore swimming is a bit
...

of change from my club swim team

back in New York, but I think I am
adjusting pretty well," Teng said, an
assertion with which all who have
watched her swim this season can
agree. She also feels as though her
versatility is well complemented by
the practice structure at Swat, saying, "Coming from a team where
yardage was the main priority, I
[that
fully
appreciate
Swarthmore] offers options in practice to target different swimmers."
As much as she has thrived in
her new environment, Teng
remains humble about her achieve...

ments while keeping her eyes firmly
on the future. "I think my times

have been solid so far, but it's still
the beginning
and I know there's
room for improvement," she said. "I

THE PHOENIX

can't help but feel optimistic going
forward with the team; I'm always
wishing for good health, great practices and the best outcomes."
Teng's ""best outcomes" have
been matched almost win for win by
teammate Lowe. Lowe, a Texan
from Austin's Liberal Arts and
Science Academy, is one of the
Garnet's leading point-scorers thus
far; she has recorded five individual
wins in her first four meets and hasn't finished lower than third in any

event. According to Lowe, she
swims "almost exclusively butterfly
and freestyle, because I can't do
backstroke or breaststroke to save
but her areas of specialty
my life"
have worked out so far, as she has
emerged victorious in the 200
freestyle twice, the 100 freestyle
once and the 200 butterfly twice.
Eppley and Regan have swum
under the radar in comparison to
the other impact first-years, but
their importance to the team depth
is not to be underestimated. Eppley,
a sprint freestyler come to
Swarthmore by way of Orinda,
California, has put up a significant
scoring haul in the 50 and the 100,
placing in the top 5 in every race
she's swum thus far. She's also

found a niche

on Swat's

"A"

freestyle relay teams and swimming
the freestyle leg in several medley
relays. Her emergence as a sprint
specialist comes not a moment too
soon, as the Garnet's only top-16 finisher in last year's Championship
50, Claire Shelden, was lost to graduation.
In contrast, Regan's importance
to the team lies not in specialty
events, but in her ability to provide
consistent point-scoring potential
across the board. On her comfort

zone, the New Jersey native said,
"My main events are the 200 breaststroke and the 400 IM, but since I
have been at Swarthmore I have
started swimming a lot of the distance freestyle events.'2 She added
that she is used to serving as a jackof-all-trades in swimming circles
"[in high school] I would swim anything that my coach needed me to
swim."
In her ability to swim "anything," Regan has given the Garnet

women vital depth in their lineup.
She has scored points every time
she's raced, and the versatile freshman has set ambitious goals for her
collegiate career. "It would be awesome to break some of the school
records or maybe make NCAA's by
the time I graduate," she said.
With [the freshman class'] depth
and diversity
it's very exciting
going forward," Wick said. That is
not to say, however, that the future
is the only thing the women have to
look forward to. "This year, the
women have really gelled," she
added. "They're willing to stand up
for each other, willing to compete
for each other
there's something
about this team, it doesn't matter if
the cards are stacked against them,
they're ready to compete until the
bitter end."
Both the men and women take to
the pool again this Friday and
Saturday for the Swarthmore
Invitational. The Friday session will
begin at 6:30 pm, while Saturday sessions are set to begin at 9:30 a.m. and

pressure to meet the family
for the first time, or to live up

Hannah Purkey
The Purkey Perspective
With winter break fast

approaching and Thanksgiving already gone, my thoughts'
turn to what I'm most thankful for. Two things always
come to mind: family and
hockey. Yet these two things
have always felt like one and
the same to me, not only

because I love my home team
as if they were family, but also
because the drama that comes
out of the National Hockey
League can only be described
in terms of family. Thus, my
Thanksgiving dinner had a
few extra characters at the
table that kept the break
interesting, as the holidays as
a hockey fan always are.
Without further ado, I introduce my NHL family and the
storylines they have found
themselves entangled in, and
me entertained by, recently.
It is always a bit awkward
when a sibling brings home
her latest significant other for
family holidays. You hear for
so long how great this new
guy is and how she can't wait
for you to meet him. She has
hyped the guy so much that
the entire family is in a tizzy
to welcome him. But when he
finally gets there, after all the
hype and uncertainty of
whether he would actually
come this year, he trips over
the tablecloth, accidentally
knocks over some candles and
sets the turkey on fire. Meet
Ilya Kovalchuk.
The winger for the New
Jersey Devils had the entire
hockey world talking about
him this off-season when he
became a free agent. Hardly a
day went by without another
Kovalchuk trade rumor headlining hockey blogs everywhere. After his first contract
was rejected by the NHL,
Kovalchuck signed a 15-year
$lOO million deal to stay with
the Devils. New Jersey was
excited to start cashing in on
this huge investment starting

this season.
Yet all Kovalchuk seems to
be able to do this year is trip
over the tablecloth. In
November, he only racked up
one goal and three assists, not
to mention a minus-seven +/ranking. This is an abysmal
record for someone getting
paid that much and a big let
down after so much off-season
hype. He hasn't been helping
his case at all by botching

December 2; 20t6

to $lOO million expectations,
but that's no excuse to suddenly become a different player. He needs to put some serious points up in the second
half of the season if he wants
to be invited back next year.
No family is complete'without the crazy uncle whose
most recent divorce everyone
loves to gossip about. Sure,
most of the stories that you
tell behind his back are outlandish exaggerations, but
you just can't help yourself.
They seemed like such a
happy couple and then out of
nowhere, he says he needs a
change. And just like that he's
sitting in your family room,
avoiding questions about
what went wrong. Meet
Danny Heatley.
Heatley found himself at
the center of the NHL gossip
mill in 2009 when he decided
that it was "time for a change"
and asked to be traded from

the Ottawa Senators. All the
old questions are getting
thrown at him again as he
prepares to return to Ottawa
with his new team, the San
Jose Sharks, this week. Has
time healed the old wounds
between these two lovebirds?
With reports that Ottawa fans
are booing the Sharks logo
whenever it is shown at
Ottawa home games, I'm

going to say not quite.
All healthy sibling relationships have some, kind of
rivalry in them. But between
brothers, the rivalry is always

a little bloodier. Meet the

Pittsburgh Penguins and the
Washington Capitals.
The rivalry between these
two teams is especially drawn
out at the moment since HBO
is doing a special documen-

tary mini-series based on this

year's winter classic between

the two. As if the Ovechkin v.

storyline
Crosby
wasn't
enough to make these teams
competitive, the promise of
prime television airtime has

made it even better.
At a recent team bonding
exercise, HBO followed the
Caps to FBI headquarters,
where the guys got some tips
on how to train like agents.
And really, what better way
for hockey players to show off
their manliness than by
shooting things and knocking
down doors? And to top it all
off, "blowing stuff up," as
Semyon Varlamov describes
it. Their target of choice was
easy: a stuffed penguin dolK If
only Santa could fit some
Penguin retaliation onto his
sleigh

...

For everyone who has a little brother, you know that it is
his job to be as annoying as
possible. This usually entails

reading your diary, ratting
you out to your parents, or, if
he's really intent on making
your life hell, sticking his

hands within an inch of your
face and repeating, "I'm riot
touching you, I'm not touching you!" Meet Chris Pronger.
Over the last few seasons,
it has become apparent that
Flyers
this Philadelphia
defenseman wants to challenge Sean Avery for the title
of most annoying opponent.
In last year's Stanley Cup
Finals, Pronger thought it
would be a good idea to make
for
off with the game puck
games his team didn't win.
Thus it should be no surprise
that Pronger is again in the
media for acting in a lessthan-mature manner. In a
game this week against the
Pronger
Calgary Flames,
attempted to distract the
Flames' goalie by waving his
arm in front of his face, little
brother-style. Although it is
debatable whether this was
actually against NHL rules,
the overtime goal that came
from the incident was disallowed and the Flyers ended up
losing in a shootout. When the
media asked Pronger about it,
he took the high road, of
course: "I'm not going to get
into a he-said-she-said with'
the refs; I'm the he." Yes, calling the referee a girl is definitely the best way to handle a
call you don't like.
Lastly, we have the helicopter parent. Some know
this particular type of parenting better than others, but we
have all heard the horror stories. These parents get
involved in their kids lives
whether they want them to or
not. They bend rules and overstep boundaries to ensure that
their kid is protected. Meet
Colin Campbell.
A Senior VP and Director
of Hockey Operations in the
NHL, Campbell functions as
the league's disciplinarian
and is responsible for overseeing suspensions and other
punishments for players who
misbehave. But much to his
embarrassment,
e-mails
recently came out where
Campbell tried to intervene
on behalf of his son, Gregory,
a player for the Boston
Bruins. Campbell complains
about borderline calls against
his son and insults other players who drew the penalties,
notably calling Marc Savard
the "biggest faker." Talk
about hovering too close. The
person most embarrassed by
the exposure of these emails
was probably the person they
were meant to protect:
Campbell's son.
As finals end and you start
heading home, I hope you will
consider inviting these characters to your next family get
together as well. Sure, they
are a bit eccentric and steal
all the best leftovers. But really, life is just more interesting
when they are around.

Senior Spotlight: The maturation of Morgan Langley
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore. edu

The number seven has earned a special place in recent soccer history,
donned by some of the premier scorers
in the last two decades: Christia.no
Ronaldo, David Beckham, Frank Ribery,
David Villa and Bastian Schweinsteiger,
just to name a few.
For the Swarthmore Garnet, Morgan
Langley 'll has worn the number seven
for the past two years during which he
became not only the best player in the
Centennial Conference and the best
player to ever play at Swarthmore, but
one of the best men's soccer players in
all of Division 111.
Langley led Swarthmore in goals in
each of the past two seasons, compiling
14 goals in each of the past two campaigns. Langley also led the Garnet in
assists this season, with 14, shattering
the previous single season record of
eight.

For Langley, 73 ofhis 95 career points,
the most in Swarthmore history, came in
his final two years for the Garnet. The
highlights are endless"— the game-tying
goal against Hobart, the assist versus
Dickinson,
the hat-trick against
Gettysburg, the game winners over
Stevens or Hopkins or Haverford
as
Langley combined his stunning combination of strength, speed, touch and finish to wreak havoc to the Garnet' opposition.
But despite the scoring explosion,
Langley's greatest improvements on the
pitch over the past four seasons have
been in the mental side of the game.
When you are a premiere offensive
talent, everything is fair game for
defenders. Throughout his career,
Langley was pushed, pulled, tripped,
kicked and hit with moves suitable for a
WWE wrestling ring. On three separate
occasions just this past year, he was
dragged down from behind by the last
defender to prevent a breakaway. Fouls?
Sure. But enough to throw Langley off
his game.
"I think [Morgan] would be the first
to tell you that in his early years at
Swarthmore, he had a very short fuse,"
goaltender David D'Annunzio 'l2 said.
"And that was sometimes a problem.
Opponents would use his intensity
against him and try to get him focused
more on the trash talk and the dirty
fouls they would make on him."
But that changed in the past two
years. Langley never lost his fire and
intensity on the field, but instead channeled that energy and passion through
his play. "I remember there were many
incidents this season where in past seasons I would have thought, 'That's going
to take Morgan out of his game.' But
I'm really pleased with
they didn't
how he responded to our opponents'
antics this year, and I think it is an indicator of how Morgan's game has developed and matured over his college
career," D'Annunzio added.
"I think that Morgan has been one of
the most dramatic development cases I
have worked with," head coach Eric
Wagner said. "He has become multidimensional and as an athlete, when he
got here he was fairly fragile
and he
became much more physically tough,
sound, athletic and fit. He has gone from
being a very tentative player to being an

As a senior, Morgan Langley set both the single-season and career points men's soccer record. Langley recorded 42 points this
season to give him 95 .in his career.
incredibly strong emotional leader for
the team," Wagner added.
Langley, as a junior, became the first
10-goal scorer in a single season for
Swarthmore in Wagner's tenure at the
College. The breakout season was the
result of a commitment that Langley
made over the summer after his sophomore spring-season when he realized
that he needed to rely on more than just
skill to become the dominant player that

he believed he could be.
"He decided that he needed to commit
himself 100% to soccer or get out of it, and
between that sophomore spring and junior fall, he decided to commit himself
athletically
fitness, strength, health,
everything. He worked his tail off over
the summer and came back in incredible
shape and was a 90-myiute player from
then on," Wagner said.
For anyone who has seen Langley dismantle opponent's defenses with his
brilliant first touch, quick turns and
breakaway speed, it is difficult to imagine Langley ever laboring on the field.
But prior to that summer, Langley
would find himself winded after only 20
or 25 minutes on the pitch. He would lose
his touch and focus. But not anymore.
"It's a wonderful case of player development and a wonderful case of maturity. It's just a great success story all
around," said Wagner, who never saw
Langley play live until he arrived at
Swarthmore as a first-year.
That maturity was contagious, instill-

ing confidence in all of his other teammates that if they put a ball within the
same area-code as Langley, he would
find it and make a play.

Kieran Reichert 'l3, who was second
on the team with seven assists this year,
will miss Langley's play-making ability
up top. "The thing I will miss most next
season will be looking up, seeing
Morgan making a run, hitting a ball and
feeling confident and relieved that he
will put the ball away. That kind of relief
and trust is invaluable."

"He's so quick that he can always create for himself, however this season, he
showed an equal willingness to create
for his teammates," Micah Rose 'l2 said.
Langley assisted on three of Rose's five
non-penalty-kick goals this season.
For his senior season, the Clothier
Field crowd expected magic from
Langley every time he took the pitch.
And incredibly he delivered, time and
time again. He scored or assisted on the
game-winning goal in eight of the team's
10 regular-season home games this year.
Rose, a captain for the Garnet in 2010,
knows that the team will miss Langley's
talent in 201 L But it is his chemistry
with Langley that Rose will miss the
most.
"I'll just miss walking out onto the
field with somebody who I've played
dozens and dozens of games with that
level of familiarity is not easy to develop. Morgan and I worked a lot together.
We developed a certain chemistry

through playing at Swat and in Vermont
that will be difficult to replace," Rose

said.
That chemistry was tangible
between Langley and all of his teammates every time that he stepped onto
the field. Langley's 14 assists, good for
fourth in all of Division 111, are a good
testament to that, with Langley putting
pass after pass right to the feet of his

teammates.
Langley gave the Garnet fans one
final treat in his penultimate game, a
thrilling 2-1 victory over DeSales in the
first round of the 2010 NCAA tournament.
Tied in the final minute ofregulation.
Langley ran onto a ball in the left corner
and served a perfect cross —cleat to
to Fabian Castro 'l2 for a tap-in
cleat
to put the Garnet back into the second
round of the NCAA Championships."
"I'm going to miss the attitude and
intensity that he brought to the field,"
D'Annunzio said. "He was always so
confident, and I think that helped every-

one around him. I knew that every time
he played he was going to show the oppo-

nents why they shouldn't be on the field

with us. And he wasn't going to stop
until they knew."
Langley and his classmates Gage
Newman 'll and Philippe Celestin 'll
leave the Garnet with a 63-9-12 career
record. The team did not lose a single
game at Clothier Field in either of the
past two seasons.
