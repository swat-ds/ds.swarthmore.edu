VP for Alumni,

dies of heart attack
By Emily

Shartin

Harry Gotwals, Vice President
for Alumni, Development, and
Public Relations, died yesterday
evening of an apparent heart attack. He was 50 years old.
According to unconfirmed reports, Gotwals was found unconscious in front ofhis home on Elm
Street yesterday at around 7:00
p.m.
A neighbor began CPR as an
ambulance was called. Gotwals
was rushed to Taylor Hospital
where, after numerous attempts
were made to revive him, he was
pronounced dead.
Gotwals
had
been
at
Swarthmore for 8 years after a previous stint at Duke University. As
Swarthmore's Vice President for
Public Relations, Alumni Relations, and Development, Gotwals
handled the college's fundraising
and external relations.
Larry Schall, Associate Vice
President for Facilities and
Services, notes, however, "He
was critical in a lot of what the
college does, not just his area
of fundraising."
The college community is in
shock over the sudden, tragic loss.
Associate Vice President and Executive Assistant to the President
Maurice Eldridge describes his
good friend Gotwals as "a great
guy" and "a community man who
truly loved Swarthmore." Schall
adds, "It's hard to imagine that
he's gone. He was a friend and
colleague that suffered a heart attack. His daughters are friends of
my daughters. He was young, he
was healthy. It's a shock."
President Al Bloom noted, "This
is a tremendous loss personally,
but also one of the most tremendous losses that the college has
faced."
Gotwals is survived by his wife
Katherine, her two daughters, and
four daughters by a previous marriage.

Workshops have been part of the Swarthmore
experience for as long as any current student can
remember. "ASAP" and "Safer Sex" are words that
have special meanings to Swatties. They remind
us of the first few weeks of our first year, when we
were all discussing topics of a rather personal nature with people we hardly knew. The administration believes these conversations are important, if
not only to educate us on a specific topic, then to
help us adjust to life at Swat through interaction.
Last spring the Deans took their beliefs in the
benefits of workshops one step further: they decided
that "diversity" should be another topic of discussion. And so was born the Diversity Workshop, an
orientation program coordinated by members of the
Diversity Umbrella.
On the nights ofSeptember 16,17, and 18, pairs of
facilitators met with groups of first-year students and
spent a few hours leading them in a series ofactivities and discussions related to the topic of "diversity."
The primary idea behind these exercises, according
to Tina Gourd '99, a coordinator, was that "the acknowledgment of differences is the first step to real
communication. Not talking about them is unhealthy.
The goal is to start a conversation." The workshops
encouraged students to point out differences among
themselves, leading to discussions about how diversity has affected individual lives.
For the most part, that is not what participants
expected of the workshops. DanMarrin 'Ol thought
"they'd be something in which we'd be discussing
differences and how they affected us before college and how they'd be handled in college. I thought
they would give us ideas, like a true 'work'shop."
Others didn't know what to expect. "The name
sounded idealistic, but gave no hint of what might
be involved," said Jessica Schwartz 'Ol. In hind-

the missing student. At around 1:15 am, Kahn
saw her walking along by the train station as
he was driving by the south entrance of the
College. When he approached the entrance to
the Crum woods he came across a group of
public safety officers, upon which he stopped
to inform them of the sighting. The student
was confirmed safe and back on campus at
2:20 am, according to Public Safety records.
As the evening progressed, two incidents
temporarily distracted efforts to locate the
missing student. According to eye-witnesses,
at around 11:30, a verbal argument had broken outside of Willets Hall between a
Swarthmore student and an outsider. The dispute escalated to a physical fight when the
former tried to "charge" the latter, a passerby recalled. Subsequently onlookers tried to
break the two apart. Public Safety was notified of the incident at 11:45. Since the fighting occured behind Ben West, the public safety
officers on duty were able to reach the scene
shortly. After their arrival, according to
Redgrave, the officers observed a "fighting
scene" —people were trying to hold back the
two parties involved in the fight—but that the
actual fighting had come to a stop.
Approximately twenty mintues later, an assault occured on the pathway leading from
Willets to Wharton. The assailant (a male) was
walking in a group of four towards Magill
walk, according to an eye-witness, who was
traveling behind the assailant's party, one
member of which he identified as a
Swarthmore student. Just as a female student
walking towards them emerged under a lamp,
the assailant leaped out to strike her on the
jaw. "He stepped out of his way and just
punched her," said the source. The victim was

The night of September 27th is one that
many members of the Swarthmore community would prefer to forget.
The day began with a frantic search for a
missing female student—which soon escalated into a more elaborate operation involving police officers from two counties—and
ended with her safe return to campus; sandwiched in between was a brief tussle and subsequent assault briefly diverting the attention
of the search party.
A source indicated that on the morning of
the 27th, friends of the missing student had
received an email from the student hinting at
the possibility of suicide. "The letter did not
threaten suicide explicitly, but it was suggestive and alarming," according to Acting Dean
of the College Bob Gross, who was approached by the student's friends shortly after they had received the email.
At around 1 pm, Director ofPublic Safety Owen
Redgrave revealed, the Public Safety Department
initiated an informal search of the campus. The
search party comprised several public safety officers, members of the Dean's Office and friends of
the missing studentAt the same time, Public Safety
also began to interview friends and acquaintences
of the student The search focused on the Crum
area as it was known thatthe missing person was a
nature lover.
As the early evening approached, Redgrave
along with other members of the administration—both President Al Bloom and Director
of Housing Myrt Westphal were present as
well as Swarthmore Police ChiefDonald Lee,
reached a consensus to escalate the search.
While the initial search continued, Redgrave
and his colleagues started work to assemble a
larger search team. Apart from the Swarthmore

Police, the help of the Nether-Providence
County Police was solicited. Redgrave summoned back off-duty several public safety officers as well. The Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association (SF&PA) also offered assistance. In the end, approximately 50 to 60
people were mobilized for the official search,
which began "in earnest," Redgrave estimated,
at around 9:30 in the evening. Public Safety also
asked WSRN to broadcast a physical description of the missing student. "We searched every building," recalled Redgrave with a tone of
resignation. In addition to the Crum, almost
every space on campus—including the attics
and basements of dorms —except for dorm
rooms had been searched, he added.
Student volunteers of SF&PA also participated in the later search as well. The fire horn
went off twice at both approximately 11:30
and half past midnight, according to one of
the volunteers who partook in thesearch. The
firefighters who arrived after the first horn
were subsequently paired up with public safety
officers to search all campus buildings. After
the rest of the firefighters had arrived following the second horn, they were kept in until a
little before 2 am, at which point the entire
party set out for the Crum to conduct a thorough search. The students were informed that
a college student had possibly committedsuicide. "We were told that we were looking for
a body," the source said. In addition to the
twenty student volunteers, around twenty fulltime firefighters also took part in the search.
However, en route to the search, the team
encoutered several students who had seen the
missing student. "When we started, I thought
there was a good chance that she somewhere
else and alive," said the source. The search
was called off soon after it commenced.

Scott
S
Krueger 'Ol
died last night
at Beth Israel
Deaconess
Medical Center, according
to wire reports
this
early
morning.
Krueger was
found unconscious in his room at Phi Gamma Delta late
Friday night, apparently suffering from alcohol poisoning after drinking excessively
during a fraternity event. He was in a coma
for three days before his death.
Kreuger's blood alcohol level was 0.41
percent when he arrived at the hospital Saturday morning. As a result of this incident
all fraternity, sorority and independent living group activities involving alcohol have
been voluntarily suspended and all dormitory activities will be alcohol-free pending
a review of alcohol policies.

MIT Campus Police were notified that
Krueger was unconscious at approximately
11:56 p.m Friday. Boston Police, Fire Department and EMS officers responded after the Campus Police called 911. Boston
police reported finding Krueger "unresponsive [and] unconscious" at approximately
12:12 a.m. in his basement room at Fiji.
The police report stated that "several empty
alcohol bottles and fresh vomit [were] observed in [the] victim's room."
According to Robert M. Randolph, senior
dean for Undergraduate Educationand Student Affairs, "they (the pledges) had just
been told who their big brothers were." In
addition, Randolph said, "they were celebrating with alcohol."
On Sunday, President Charles M. Vest released a statement saying "my thoughts and
prayers, and those of my wife Becky, go
out to Scott Krueger, his family, and all
those touched by this terrible tragedy."
Following this incident, the MIT Chapter of Fiji, lota Mu, has been jointly suspended by MIT and the national Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity pending an investigation.
While suspended "only the most basic operations of the chapter are allowed," accord-

ing to Executive Director of Phi Gamma

Delta, Bill Martin. Fiji will not be permit-

ted to hold social events or initiate new
members while suspended.
In addition, the Interfraternity Council
unanimously passed a resolution agreeing to
"voluntarily cancel all events in which alcohol is involved until all FSILG and EFC risk
management policies have been reviewed,"
according to a statement released Sunday.
Iddo Gilon '9B, president of the IFC, said,
"We have the commitment of the FSILGs
to make this review possible." Gilon did
not speculate on what specific changes
might be made to the policies. "This is the
first accident ofits nature," Gilon said. "In
outcome, it is an isolated incident."
The Dormitory Council also announced
late Monday night that all dormitory functions will be alcohol free for an indefinite
period of time pending a review of the alcohol policies in Institute housing.
Ashesh P. Shah '9B, president of
Dormcon, said "hopefully we can resolve
this [issue] and come up with new policies
that are beneficial to students and to the
administration."
"We will press any criminal charges
should they develop," said Sgt. Marjorie

Hill of the Boston Police Department.
Charges of "involuntary manslaughter at
the least would result if the student dies,"
Hill said prior to Krueger's death.
In addition, following Kreuger's hospitalization on Friday, Boston Police conducted a license premise inspection of the
Fiji house. Following the inspection, Fiji
was presented with charges of: serving alcohol to a minor, overdose ofalcohol causing serious injury, debris blocking a second floor corridor and bicycle and debris
blocking a fire exit in the basement. These
charges were violations of Fiji's dormitory
license, which is in the name of Daniel A.
Hermann '9B, Fiji treasurer.
According to Hill, representatives of Fiji
must appear before a city licensing board to
answer the charges.
An officialof the licensing board said that the
outcome of the charges could range from probation to the suspension of Fiji's dormitory license.

According to Arnold N. Weinberg, director of the MIT Medical Department, a blood
alcohol level of 0.41 results from ingesting
the equivalent of approximately 16 drinks.
At this level ofintoxication there is a 50 percent chance of death.

first-years were
expected to attend three mandatory workshops as part of
their acclimation to the college community. The
latest addition to this series of peerfacilitated activities was the Diversity Workshop, whose apparent aim
was to introduce a dialogue on diversity issues to the incoming students. If the pages of this newspaper are any indication, it's clear that
diversity is a much-talked about issue already, and to have an activity
whose goal it is to spur such discussions seems superfluous. More
troubling than this is the fact that the
workshop's structure was not conducive to any substantive discussion on
diversity issues. If anything, the consensus seems to be that the workshops tended to reinforce existing
views rather than catalyze new conceptions of personal differences.
We do not feel that the workshop
environment is useful in creating an
atmosphere where an issue as complex and personal as diversity can
be wrestled with comfortably and
effectively. The rules of a workshop—confidentiality, subjective
qualification of statements, and the
barring of spontaneous interjection
and personal rebuttals —cannot
overcome the inherent impersonality of being grouped together with
strangers and casual acquaintances.

workshop is at least a first step towards intellectual engagement in
the community; if it is, it is an infinitesimal step. In many instances,
the workshop served only to highlight the defensive obstinacy of
white students to admit that they
were in possession of any privilege
at all. It's safe to assume that the
most progressive and cathartic step
an individual can take in his reassessment of his preconceptions is
the open admission and confrontation ofhis prejudices—this kind of
admission will almost never occur
in a workshop, no matter what rules
you have in place.
The proper forums for these discussions are those that naturally
occur within personal relationships
in a diverse student body. The institutionalization of an impotent
mechanism such as a single threehour workshop certainly cannot be
counted on to provide any impetus
for meaningful change. Issues of
diversity will surely define our generation socially and politically, and
they must be seriously debated,
honestly discussed, and carefully
pondered. Diversity cannot be

Letters to the Editor
Diversity does not mean education must be sacrificed
To the editor
There are no grounds for Ilya
Leskov's assertion that diversity
means sacrificing education. In
fact, the two goals go hand in
hand: the fight for diversity on this
campus is about striving for a
well-rounded, rich, and interesting educational experience for
each of us. Diversity should be a
priority for the admissions office
to improve this institution and ultimately to increase the impact
that we have in enacting social
change after leaving Swarthmore
.Leskov admits that many are deprived of educational opportunities like "good schools" and "a
safe study environment" during
the first 12 years of their educational experience. But he fails to
recognize the role that institutions
of higher learning have in correcting these imbalances. Change can

only be achieved when previously
underrepresented groups gain political power and when everyone
recognizes their role in ending
oppression. Education is key in
both areas, which is where
Swarthmore fits in. To fulfill this
mission, it is important that we
have diversity among faculty and
students. We educate each other;
we learn from the people we see
daily during our four years here.
The diversity workshops for
first-years were designed to begin
this dialogue. The activities were
not designed to divide or alienate,
but to encourage us to recognize
and appreciate our differences.
These differences include academic interests and ideological
beliefs, but the elements that have
most influence on one's status in
American society today are eco-

Female Officer resignation
should be covered; Phoenix

To the Editor:
Perhaps it is my own ignorance
of journalism that keeps me from
understanding the mysterious system through which The Phoenix
editorial board chooses new story
topics. It's also possible that I was
misguided in my belief that the
purpose of The Phoenix is to report noteworthy happenings at
Swarthmore College. Or maybe,
just maybe, for two straight
weeks, the news pages of The
Phoenix were so jam-packed with
urgent stories such as "Is Swat really that tough?" and "The Freedom Singers: A Voice of Hope,"
that the editors decided other stories would have to wait until the
whirlwind of excitement that had
consumed Swarthmore blew
away. Otherwise, I have no explanation for the fact that The
Phoenix has yet to produce a story
about the resignation of Kelly
Dodson, Public Safety's lone female officer. Yes, you read that
correctly, the only female Public
Safety patrol officer resigned as
ofSeptember 15, and there was no
Phoenix story covering it. lam
extremely concerned about what
this might be telling us about the
priorities of The Phoenix editorial board.
I don't have an informant in
Swarthmore Public Safety, I know
about this occurrence because I
get The Daily Gazette, a student
email publication produced every
weekday. I don't know how the
heard about Ms.
Gazette
Dodson's resignation, but somehow they found out in time to interview both Ms. Dodson and
Larry Schall, associate vice president for facilities and services, and
produce a news brief about the
occurrence for the September 17
issue of the Gazette. It includes
the quote from Ms. Dodson, "I
was often told that there was no
room for women in the Public
The
Safety Department."
Gazette's coverage of this event
was not only timely, but also relatively informative considering the
time and space constraints of a
daily publication.

If The Phoenix editors do not
have access to the same sources as
The Daily Gazette, that is unfortunate. I would understand, then, that
the editors did not hear about this
event in time to include it in the
September 19 issue. However,
there is no excuse for the absence
of a story in the September 26 issue. It's possible that the editors
of The Phoenix don't subscribe to
The Daily Gazette, but I would be
amazed to learn that this is true. It's
simply good journalism to read
other publications.
Another possible explanation for
the omission is the fact that no officials seem to want to talk about
this occurrence. Perhaps the editors sent out some trustworthy ace
reporter to cover the story and he
or she found (as I did in an attempt
to learn more about the situation)
that Owen Redgrave, director of
public safety, Larry Schall, and
Maurice Eldridge, associate vice
president and executive assistant to
the president, all decline to comment on the particulars of Ms.
Dodson's resignation. However,
would that not have made a newsworthy story? "Female Patrol Officer Resigns, Administration Has
No Comment." Doesn't The Phoenix think it's strange that Larry
Schall told the Gazette "things are
never as simple as they seem, especially when only one person is
talking," when he himself declined
the opportunity to discuss the case
in further detail? I don't yet understand enough about this case to
know whether it would be appropriate for the administration to tell
us more, but I do think we should
be asking more questions.
I sincerely hope that the all-male
editorial board does not view stories such as Ms. Dodson's resignation as relevant only to feminist
groups and not to the rest of the
campus. The Phoenix should be a
medium through which we can all
learn what is going on at our College, from as many view points as
possible. I hope in the future such
an oversight will not occur again.

nomics, race, class, gender, and
sexual orientation. If people felt
alone and alienated when asked to
identify with a certain category, it
is a commentary on prejudices in
our society which confer stereotypes on these groups. If difference
divides us, I think it is a reflection
of the world we live in, and it is
something we should be aware of.
I don't think it reflected a flaw in
the workshops.
The workshops were also designed to encourage discussion
about how these differences influence our Swarthmore experience.
Each of us have privileges conferred upon us because of our identity, privileges that we do not ask
for but benefit from daily, even at
Swarthmore. Other elements of our
identity make us underprivileged,
and influence our daily experiences

which we have little influence.
Appreciating diversity does not
come from covering over difference, be that racial, sexual, or educational. Instead, it comes fromrecognizing that we all travelledmany different paths to get here,
some of which were more difficultthan others. Now that we are here,and have begun to learn eachother's life stories, we are the better for it. When we leave here, we;
can actively work to end racism,
classism, sexism, and homophobia; or we can at least try not to
perpetuate these phenomena by
being utterly blind to how they
affect our position in society,
whether we are on the privileged
or underprivileged sides of each

meanderings

To the Editor:
I see a fair number of interesting
articles in the Swarthmore Phoenix
each week as I peruse the pages of
this venerable publication. Actually, I've never read it before tonight. Nevertheless, I think it's a
great paper...even if it is a little dry.
In fact, I was thinking I could entertain your readers with a little
something I put together myself,
"39 pass/fail days at Swat", or "The
things I learned in Willets that are
really a lot more entertaining than
studying." This includes such gems
as the age-old discovery that Mountain Dew and tequila just don't add
up to a good studying aid, and the
realization that no matter what, you
will always run out of quarters just
before your clothes have finished

drying. I might include photographs of myself making contact
with several new civilizations in
the kitchen fridge, or I might simply ponder upon the fact that no
matter what color clothes you put
in the dryer, the lint collected is
always blue-gray. I could even recount a late-night philosophical
debate on the question of whether
soap bounces. The list is endless;
the 1 minute 48 second dash from
bed to class (uuurghh...
9:26...p1enty of ti....zzz), the fact
that no matter where you order
Chinese from, what you get is
never quite what you asked for, the
numberof people maimed in overzealous games of hall frisbee...

Car policy should

official Student
Handbook states the
following policy:

Because of the limited number of parking spaces on campus, only those students receiving permission from the

Committee will be

issued permanent
parking permits...Although permit applications are judged primarily on need, first and

second year students are generally not
granted permission. Juniors who are in
doubt as to whether they would likely be a
recipient of a permit should contact the
Department ofPublic Safety before bringing a car back to school" (Swarthmore
College 1997-1998 Student Handbook
pg. 83 emphasis added).
I am confused. Can someone tell where
this official statement says Seniors must
show need? Freshman, Sophomores, and
Juniors are each specifically told they
might be denied, but Seniors are told
nothing!!! No specific mention is
made that we ought to worry our applications might be denied. Yet I write this as a

They have a point. I have no idea whatthe
actual policy is, for as I have stated many
times, it is clearly not the one published in
the Student Handbook.
I would also like to address the use of
the word "need" in the allegedly official
policy. "Need" is a word that opens itself
to an enormous spectrum of interpretation.
Need can not be anything more stringent
than, "um, yeah, like, give this person a
permit cause he's, like, my friend n stuff."

wrong with the question the student asked,
or the continuation of their discussion after the lecture. There may have been substantive problems in Rogers's work that
needed to be addressed, and I am glad the
student was able to pursue the matter. The
problem lies solely with Rogers, and his
failure to afford similar respect to a member of the faculty who notably deserves it.
We should expect better from a guest in
our community.
At first glance, Joel Rogers seemed to be
a striking example of "integrative" social
activism, but I have come to conclude that
he is a problematic progressive. I don't
know whether he is disrespectful to all
women, or only one; but I do know that
the fight for social justice must be fought
by people willing to listen and engage in
dialogue. In her autobiography, the Black
feminist Angela Davis addressed the problem of civil rights activists who "happened"
to be sexist, calling the contradiction "a
constant problem in my political life." The
personal is political.
I still believe that Rogers does important
work, but it's hard for me to admire him.
It's hard to deal with such a contradiction,
but I think it's important to confront the
issue, not elide it. Working for justice cannot be separate from our daily lives, from
the way we treat each other and speak to
each other. On this point, I think we can all
use some education.

CRC Election Platforms
The candidates for the CRC position on student council
were asked to respond to the following questions. The
election will take place Monday through Wednesday of next
week.
1)What would you like to accomplish on SC this
semester and what kind of role do you see yourself
playing on council in general?
2) What problems do you see with student space at
Swarthmore, and what do you hope to accomplish as
CRC coordinator?
On student council, I would like
to get things down. I feel that the
curriculum can be broadened to

offer a wider range of courses and
other departments such as finance, accounting, or communications would be good fields to

include in the academia, or at
least courses in the present departments that could branch out
and cover some of the aforementioned subjects and other topics
of interest. I also think that a new
student center would help the

college environment, a space that
can provide an area to relax or socialize when students want to unwind during the week, or even, a
nicer environment to study in
rather than the libraries which
often feel depressing, warranting
the nickname McCage. Lastly, I
think the college should maintain
the current size of the school. At
present, the school barely fits all
the students and I feel that expansion of the. student body would
degrade the environment that the
Swarthmore community provides.
As for the campus space, problems have already occurred this
year with one of the committees
not having a space to meet during one of the times that their

members were available. Although this situation was resolved, I would hope to provide
all clubs and committees with a
time to meet for a meal during
Sharpies, and if a conflict arises,
I believe that some of the lunch
times should be looked at for possible periods for a club to meet.
With the worst case scenario of
two different groups that could
only meet during one time, I
would look into developing a rotation schedule that would be fair
for both factions. In the end, I
hope to provide new ideas for student council and fair solutions for
campus space problems as CRC
coordinator.
—lmran Posner

As a member of student council,
my main objective would be to
cause change in the Swarthmore
community. I will not waste time
with meaningless rhetoric, but instead will deal with the issues that
concern the student body. I propose
that a questionnaire be sent to all
students asking them to identify
specific issues that they want addressed. After processing the information, action would be taken so that
the voice of the student body is
heard. I will be vocal in student council in identifying the wants and needs
of the students. In addition, I will
consider all views presented by other
members of the student council.
The problem with the allocation
of student space at Swarthmore is
that it's done without a goal in

mind. Instead of merely granting a
group or organization a designated
area, I would investigate the purpose behind their action. Is it to
promote diversity?What parties are
participating? Why not have certain
groups join not only to conserve
space but also to promote unity on
campus. Certain events are perfect
opportunities for various groups to
form alliances. I am a responsible
person who will handle the task of
CRC coordinator with efficiency
and effectiveness. Requests for
space will be answered immediately and processed through the appropriate channels. I will be readily
accessible and anxious to respond
to students needs.

CPC prepares to "galvanize consensus"
By

Major issues to be discussed include:
•Facilities: The CPC will consider renovation of Parrish, a new or expanded gymnasium, a new student center, and a new
residence hall.
A $4 million expansion and renovation
of DuPont is already in the planning process. Architects have been hired and are
drafting potential plans for renovations and
expansions ofother buildings.
According to Bloom, the college library
system—McCabe in particular—is running
out of space and may need to be expanded,
possibly via a renovation ofOld Tarble.The
CPC is also looking into the possibility of
combining the library and computer services into one "information services" unit.

Nate Stulman

Last Friday, the College Planning Com-

mittee (CPC) formally began an extensive

multi-year process to set priorities for
Swarthmore's future. President Al Bloom,
chairof the CPC, is "looking for great ideas
whose time has come and which will galvanize consensus," and hopes to identify
them through a comprehensive review of
nearly all major facets of the college.
The CPC and its sub-committees, known
as Planning Sub-Groups or PSGs, will sift
through scores of proposals over the next
year before concentrating on a short list of
objectives that will be presented for review
to the college community.

•Curriculum: Provost Jennie Keith is
coordinating the review of the college's
curriculum. The Council on Educational
Policy (CEP), which Keith chairs, will
study "substantive issues this year and
structural issues next year."
Substantively, the CEP is considering
four new areas of study. Cognitive Science, Film and Media Studies, and Islamic
Studies may become concentrations, while
Japanese Studies may be integrated into the
Department of Modern Languages. Additionally, the CEP is expected to endorse
stronger institutional support for community-based learning programs.
Structurally, Keith is focusing on issues
ranging from staffing to graduation require-

consider, for instance,
whether it would be better to create requirements based on broader learning categories like quantitative thinking rather than
the traditional PDC requirements.
•Financial Aid: The college remains
"firmly committed to need-blind admissions and to meeting full financial aid," says
Bloom. The president wants to ensure that
the college is treating students fairly and
not creating excessive financial burdens.
The committee will compare Swarthmore's
financial aid program to those of some of
its peer institutions such as Amherst and
Williams.
•Athletics: Bloom supports strengthening the college's athletic program. "Our

goal is to make sure student athletes have
positive experiences in each of our sports.
They deserve level playing fields with their
competition and frequent opportunities to
experience the success they deserve, given
the enormous effort they invest." Bloom
also said the college's policy on athletic
recruitment will be reviewed.
The CPC will present a tentative list of
priorities and recommendations to the college community during the fall of 1998 and
will finalize its report to Bloom by the
spring of 1999. The President will then
present the recommendations and priorities to the Board of Managers, which is
expected to review (and hopefully accept)
the plan by May 1999.

Lang creates endowment to commission young composers
Eugene Lang announced at last
Friday night's Orchestra 2001 concert that he is creating an endowment that will commission a young
composer each year to write a piece
that will be performed at
Swarthmore. This endowment will
honor the late Mary Stott, the wife
of Gil Stott, one of the Associate
Deans.
The Stotts have been very involved within the Swarthmore
community for many years, especially within the music department.
Both have been members of the

orchestra since 1950. "Frankly, I
just like many other people who've
known the Stotts always saw Gil
and Mary Stott as one. They were
wonderful people completely in
tandem, in their relationship to
Swarthmore and the students," says
Lang who approached the college
this year to discuss how he could
honor the Stotts.
Professor Jim Freeman worked
alongside Lang to formulate the
idea for the endowment. The fund
is one of the first definitive plans
that Lang has made for the $3O

sight, Schwartz agreed with Marrin,
that "calling it a diversity workshop
didn't relate to what happened
pointing out how each person was
different, not the group."
Besides these initial misconceptions, there were some negative reactions, both formal and informal,
from a small group of students. In
an editorial letter that appeared in
last week's issue of ihePhoenix,
two first-years wrote of the workshops: "Instead of celebrating diversity, the sessions served to highlight otherwise unimportant differences and create divisions among an
already tolerant and accepting
group." Eric Freedman '99, another
coordinator, stressed that only a few
people had such negative reactions.
"In the overwhelming majority of
written evaluations, participants said
it was a positive experience—better
than they expected. Unfortunately,
it seems that when people have a
negative reaction to something
they're prone to write an article."
Indeed, each of the first-years interviewed for this article had mostly
positive comments. Arianna Freeman 'Ol said, "...diversity is right
on top of us, it's important to address it on many levels. It was
great that the workshop stressed
diversities besides race. In two
hours they managed to include
socio-economic issues, gender,
sexuality, religion, and geography." Jane Ng 'Ol said "I liked
what I saw—everyone in a circle
acknowledging differences and
discussing them."
So were the workshops worthwhile?
lithe objectives were to start conversations and increase awareness then they
were unquestionably successful. Many
first-years continued discussions into

lection. The person who receives
the grant is given about a year to
compose a piece for either a chamber ensemble or a small orchestra.
The piece will be performed for the
first time in Lang Concert Hall by
a professional ensemble, including
at least one Swarthmore student.
Freedman says that he hopes that
the grant will stimulate young
people to compose and meet the
need for American music to be written and heard.
Lang has donated over $6 million
to the performing arts center
through the years. "In an age where

we are thinking of diversity and the/
need for understanding and togetherness is increasingly important, I
know no other source that brings
people together more than music,"
says Lang.
Gil Stott, who was surprised by
Lang's announcement at the concert, expressed his gratitude towards Lang, and pride that his
wife's name would now always be
associated with the arts, something
she valued dearly. "This is another
instance of Lang's great generosity and reflects the college's involvement in the fine arts department," says Stott.

in two hours. We were trying to start
people talking about it, to takethat first

step."

Furthermore, coordinators are
taking most of the criticism constructively. Ng mentioned that although she liked the idea of the
circle, she "wanted people to be
aware that there are also numerous
similarities among people from all
over the world." Marrin said that it
was unclear what the goal was,
even during the workshop. He
"missed what it was after... They
seemed to be encouraging us to

acknowledge the differences but
forgot to address the vast common
ground that exists." Freedman indeed acknowledged that "there are
certainly changes that we would
like to make. The concerns of the
students who wrote the editorial
and others will surely be addressed
as we prepare to facilitate these
workshops next fall."
The Diversity Workshops are here
to stay. The strong positive response in the first year has been
very encouraging to the coordinators, and they look forward to making improvements in the years to
come.

Women's rugby fights hard, comes up short
Swat women put forth valiant effort against University of
Pennsylvania Quakers, showing spirit despite defeat
By Amber

Halsey, Danielle
Thomas, Rhiana Swartz

On Saturday the women's rugby
team traveled to the University of

Pennsylvania where they attempted
to claim victory in their first division game. However theAside team
was not able to fulfill this dream;
they lost 5-3, the smallest margin

possible in a rugby match.
Despite the first match, theB-side
team, consisting mostly ofrookies,
held up against the Quakers which
resulted in a score of 0-0.
The A-side game was plagued
from the very start by the appearance ofPenn's tight head prop, who
was deemed worthy of blocking for
the NFL. Thus the women ruggers

allowed Penn to score a quick try
within the first five minutes. The
A-side squad regained its composure though and managed to narrow the gap to 2 with a 3 point penalty kick by Beth Wiles '9B.
Despite this minor setback, the
team as a whole played a tight defensive game. Forward Becky
Snyder '9B bowled through the op-

Scrum half Meghan Brennan 'OO
suffered a knee injury and was
forced to leave the game. She was
replaced by heroic rookie Nancy
Craig 'Ol who took the reigns and
finished theA-side game with skill
and devotion.
The B-side game was a pleasure
to watch after the frustrating A-side
game. Craig played just as well in
the second game, getting the ball
out to fly half Noelle Goodin 'OO
as well as passing the ball continually to Tracy McNeil 'OO and

played a new position in her second game of rugby; she proved her
incredible fielding skills at fullback. Ursula Lang 'OO played a

All in all, the Swarthmore

TheSwarthmore women's ultimate team
not only placed sixth out of thirteen teams,

week from a foot injury to prove herself a
powerful contender in the midfield.
The other captain, Betsy Rosenbaum,
scored the team's goal with an assist from
Jaquette to tie the game at 1-1. Throughout this game of fierce play, Rosenbaum,
Baxter and Jacquette lead the team with
their strong prescence on the field.
In addition to the strength of the captains,
the Tide was also supported by a tremendous wave of fans who came to the game.
"There was so much support for our team
out there, including the field hockey and
men's soccer teams, that all sides of the
field were lined with fans," said Jaquette.
Considered possibly the best game of the
season, or at least in competition to the 42 season opening win against Goucher, this
game has added another boost in the confidence of the team in its abilities to succeed in the face of adversity.

but improved their level of play immensely
this past weekend at Sectionals.
They opened Saturday playing hard, but
were defeated 4-11 by a club team, Sol.
The second game was against the Masters
team, a club team from the Philly area. The
Masters had the skill to match their number three seating in the tournament, also
defeating Swarthmore, 11-4. The
Warmothers finished their play with a victory, solidly defeating Penn. State, 11-4.
After working hard on their zone defense
at the Rutgers tournament two weekends
ago, the Warmothers were ready to use it
on Sunday at Sectionals. Beginning their
play against U. of Delaware, Swarthmore
was quick to reach a victory. With their
aggressive zone defense, and quick throws
on offense, the Warmothers' level of play
was impressive.
The second game, against one of the best
teams in the nation, the Philly Peppers,
gave theWarmothers an opportunity to play
hard and learn new techniques. The Philly
Peppers, at this point having shut out all
their opponents in the tournament, were

halted by Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol, who got
a defensive block right away. After a few
more defensive moves, and quick passes
on offense, Simone Brant '99 caught the
disk off a short pass in the end zone, and
Swarthmore became the first team to score
against the Peppers in the tournament.
Carrying over their energy and confidence into the next game, Swarthmore
showed how much they had improved by
defeating the Masters team, 9-6. With the
help of great cuts, beautifully placed hammers (thrown by Julia Trippel '01), and
team flow, the Warmothers fought for their
triumph over the Masters.
"We destroyed the zone of the Philly
Masters team, which beat us on Saturday"
said co-captain Mandy Hourihan '9B. The
tournament ended in full circle, with a final game against Sol, in which
Swarthmore, feeling the effects of several
team injuries, and seven games in one
weekend, was defeated, but, in the words
of co-captain, Leslianne Yen '9B, "with
great spirit!"
Regionals this weekend will wrap up the
official women's season for the
Warmothers, however they will be playing
with the men's team in some co-ed tournaments in October before the spring season.

The women's tennis team battled
Kutztown, West Chester, and played a tournament at the College of New Jersey this
past week.
They fell 1-7 to Kutztown with the only
win coming from Freshman Jennifer Pao.
On Thursday they travelled to West
Chester, where they won 7-2 with four of
the singles teams and all of the doubles
teams

coming out solid.

Their week continued to be busy with a
tournament on Saturday at the College of
New Jersey. It was the first time all season
that they played all Division 111 teams, including College of NJ, Skidmore, NYU,
Vassar, and Haverford.
Only four players, Jennifer Pao, Laura
Brown, Wendy Kemp, and Rani Shankar,
went to this tournament and played both
singles and doubles. All of them played
well against the other 64 players who were
at the tournament, especially considering

Adam Stem

that one doubles team, Pao and Shankar,
played their second game against the number one seed.
Their last tournament of the fall season
is the Capitol Classic Tournament, which
will be the weekend of the 11th and 12th;
only the top six players will go. When
asked what her hopes were for this upcoming tournament,. Pao said that she and the
team will just "see what happens."
After that weekend, the fall season will
be over and the team will be responsible
for training on their on until the spring season begins after winter break. When the
spring season begins, the games and tournaments will begin to count for the season, unlike now when the team is playing
for practice and to get back into tennis.
"None of the matches we've had are league.
Nothing is conference until the spring,"
stated JenniferPao. As they go into their
last tournament, the team looks forward to
the spring season where they'll be playing
competitively and can see how their efforts
this fall paid off.

Field Hockey
triumphs again
By

N.H.L Preview
Repeat. It's one of the most
feared words in the N.H.L. Shortly
after the Detroit Red Wings finished their celebration, their citywide party to which one-fourth of
Detroit's population showed up,
their champagneflowing from Lord
Stanley's Cup, and their time on
Letterman, Leno and Conan, it was
time to face the crushing reality:
they're the defending champs.
Winning back-to-back cups in
hockey is nearly impossible, and
for Detroit in 1997-98, it will be
even harder than that. The Wings
will have to overcome the tragic
limo wreck which placed
defensemen VladamirKonstintinov
and Slava Fetisov in the hospital for
most of the summer, and the freeagency loss of goaltender and playoff M.V.R Mike Vernon to San Jose.
Strangely enough, though, a Detroit repeat cannot be totally ruled
out. Head coach Scotty Bowman
enters this year with at least 700
more victories than any other active coach, and none of his opposing coaches even have 700 total
wins. This record is made possible
by Bowman's brilliant left-wing
lock system, and his ability to teach
fundamental defense.
With this in mind, the defensive
positions left by Konstantinov and
Fetisov may be filled effectively by
the rest of the Wings squad, capable
of showing more depth over the
years than Confucius. Vernon's
position in goal could be replaced
by the young Chris Osgood, named
to the mid-season all-star game in
'97 but who lost the starting job to
injury this year.
In Detroit's way will be the Dallas Stars, who actually won the
Central Division last year, ending
a long time streak of Detroit regular-season dominance. Dallas
comes fresh off of signing all-star
center Mike Modano, and aim to
make some noise in the playoffs
after last year's premature first
round exit made possible by
Edmonton. Overrated goaltender
Ed "the eagle" Belfour will join
Dallas and will feel right at home
with the stellar defense.
Other teams to watch in TheWest
include the Pacific Division's Colorado Avalanche, cup champs in 96'
and who exited in the conference
finals complements ofDetroit. This
year they return to the lineup goalie
Patrick Roy, along with captain Joe
Sakic, fresh from a new three year,
$2l million contract.
Also in the division lie the
Edmonton Oilers, a dark horse who
last year upset the Dallas Stars,
heavy favorites. The Oilers boast
a roster with the league's best
young talent, headed by centers
Weight and Arnott. Without question, the team's key player will be
all-world goaltender Curtis "Cujo"
Joseph, who virtually won the Dallas series on his own behind a terrible defense. Joseph's desperation
play has spawned the sign which
states: "Only god has more saves
than Joseph" If Cujo can compensate for his team's poor defense,the
Oilers look to mix it up in the
postseason.
In the East, the Philadelphia Flyers are still the team to beat in their
conference, provided goaltender
Hextall finishes the year without
passing away from natural causes.
The elite Western teams seem to
boast faster and simply better players than those of the East, though.
Others East teams to watch include the New Jersey Devils, the
New York (booooo) Rangers, and
the underdog Buffalo Sabers. Buffalo contains last year's M.V.P.
goalie Hasek, perhaps the best
goaltender in trie N.H.L. along with
Roy and Joseph.
Departures form the East include
center Mark Messier from New
York to Vancouver in the West, and
Pittsburgh's saviorMario Lemieux,
from the Penguins to the golf
course after one of the best ever
N.H.L. careers.
The story of this year's N.H.L.
champion remains unwritten and
vague at this point, but there are
plenty of qualified candidates. The
season promises to bring with it old
heroes, new youngblood, and the
unique blend of grace and bullfighting reserved exclusively for the
N.H.L.

Blowing away their competition
in three games, the field hockey
team won the Seven Sisters Tournament last weekend. The Garnet
(10-0 overall, 3-0 conference) defeated Mount Holyoke, host Smith,
and defendingchampion Wellesley
en route to recapturing the trophy.
In addition, Danielle Duffy '9B was
named the tournament's MostValuable
Player, while Michelle Walsh '9B and
Donna Griffin '99 made theprestigious
All-Tournament team.
Swat made a strong showing in their
opening contest, defeating Mt Holyoke
8-0. Duffy scored four goals and had
two assists. Krista Hollis 'Ol scored a
hat trick, and Holly Baker '99 also put
one past the goalie. Griffin,LurahHess
'99, and Jen Hagan '99 all picked up
assists.
Coach Karen Borbee cited one
shining moment in the game to be
the first goal, when "Danielle Duffy
took the ball at our defensive 25 yd.
line and beat at least eight Mount
Holyoke players by herselfand went
the entire length of the field. She
then burnt the goalie and scored. I've
never seen anyone do that."
In the second round of play, the
Garnet torched the squad from
Smith, 7-1. Duffy and Hess both
scored hat tricks, and Walsh recorded a goal as well. Kristen English 'Ol had a pair of assists, and
Baker, Griffin, Hagan, and Hollis
notched assists too. This game was
more challenging thanthe first according to the players. "Smith played a
tough first half, they were on theirhome
field and wanted to win. They scored
early, but even after we scored a few
more times, Smith didn't quit until the

last second was off the clock," commented Hess.
The finals predictably pitted rival
Wellesley against Swarthmore.
Wellesley, ranked second in its region, beat the Garnet in the finals
last year. Swat, ranked fifth in the
South Atlantic Region as of 9/23,
soundly defeated their foe 4-1, with
the Wellesley goal being scored in
the closing moments of the game.
"Wellesley was a very strong team
with great passing and strong free
hits, but our defense was able to
break them down and get the ball
up to the offense," said Hess.
Swarthmore's last goal in the finals was "a direct corner, and it was
perfect. Danielle Duffy hit out to
Kristen English who made a perfect stick stop, and Jen Hagan fired
a bullet past the goalie. It was like
putting an exclamation point on the
whole tournament," said Borbee.
Duffy's 21 point performance
earned her not only the MVP
award, but also Conference honors
as Athlete of the Week for the second week in a row. "Danielle,
Donna, and Michelle deserved the
individual honors they received.
They had an outstanding tournament. But I know even they would
agree that many more members of
the team could have been selected
and also had outstanding tournaments." said Borbee.
The Garnet expect the tournament and their victory over the
highly ranked Massachusetts squad
to push them up in their own regional rankings, which next come
out October 4. They travel to
Dickinson this Saturday to take on
the Diplomats in a conference
match-up.

The women's soccer team traveled to play against Western Maryland last Saturday, September 27,
where they lost 5-1.
The Garnet had difficulty coping
with the new terrain especially the
slope of a hill near the playing
field. In addition, the team found
the speed of the Western Maryland
team impressive. By the end of

the first half, the Garnet was down
4-0. After some half-time adjustments, the Garnet Tide played very
strong, keeping the Maryland squad
to only one goal. They also
knocked one in to even up the half.
Betsy Rosenbaum '9B scored the
goal from an assist by Diana Hunt
'99. After their strong performances for the week both,
Rosenbaum and goalie Sari
Altscheur made the Centenial Con-

ference Honor Roll.
On Tuesday, the Tide played a
powerful game against Gettysburg,
After a grueling 90 minutes and 1
period of overtime, Gettysburg, a
team ranked 11th in the country,
defeated the Garnet 2-1. "We
played really hard and aggressive,"
said Captain Claire Baxter, "We
really broke up the midfield."

The Garnet Tide hosted Gettysburg Saturday
afternoon and attempted to reverse its early season misfortunes. After taking a 15-7 lead, however, Gettysburg scored 57 consecutive points
to hand Swarthmore its third blowout in as many
games.
After spotting the Bullets a 7-0 lead,
Swarthmore put together a 7 play 80 yard drive,
capped by sophomore tailback JoeAleffi's three
yard touchdown. Two long receptions by
sophomre wingback Lou Basanese highlighted
the drive. Quarterback J.P. Harris '99 followed
the score with a two point conversion for the
Tide's first lead of the year.
After the defense stopped the Bullets on their
next drive, the Tide took over again on their own
20. This time, theTide needed 12 plays to march
the eighty yards for the touchdown. Aleffi took
advantage of huge holes made by the offensive
line and ran three times for thirty yards on
the drive. Harris took advantage of Aleffi's
running by faking him a handoff and sprinting
around the end for a 25 yard touchdown and a
15-7 lead.
"It was great to finally put those points on the
board" Harris said afterwards. "A lot ofcredit
has to go to the offensive line on those drives."
With the lead and the momentum, the Tide

Mike

Jean Quinn

appeared to take full control of the game. A
late first half touchdown by the Bullets tied the
score just before the half, but what happened in
the third quarter caught everybody completely,
by surprise.
Any thoughts of an upset ended in the next
sixteen minutes as Gettysburg rolled up six
touchdowns and completely dominated every aspect of the game. The Bullets rushed for 360
yards in the second half as their top threerushers finished with 29 carries for 385 yards.
Swarthmore's offense froze and the Tide could
only muster 40 second half yards and turned the
ball over three times.
"Offensively, they made adjustments to stop
our running game, and we couldn't get anything
going afterwards" lineman Paul Willenberg 'OO
claimed. Defensively, "We just couldn't tackle.
You can't win if you don't tackle" said Bernard
Nossuli '9B.
Facing the question of what happened in the
second half, one coach remarked "We were patting ourselveson the back when the game was
only half over. As a result, we came out flat in
the second half."
Swarthmore's next opponent is Ursinus, the
longest consecutive college rivalry in the Philly
area, with a series that started in 1885.
Swarthmore, losers of 13 straight, won the last
meeting at Ursinus 24-22 in 1995.

Men's Ultimate plays well at Sectionals
Earthworms add two wins, three losses to
By

Drew Mast and Galen O’Toole

The Swarthmore Men's Ultimate team competed in the Sectional tournament at Penn State
last Saturday, winning two games and dropping
three.
Opening the day against cross-town rival
UPenn, Swarthmore surprised the Void with
tight defense and a patient offense, winning the
game 9-6. It was Swat's first victory against
UPenn in three tries this season.
The next three contests were significantly less
successful for the Earthworms, as they took on
three Club teams. The Earthworms lost 11-1 to
the Q City All-Stars, 11-3 to Retired to Stud,
and 11-5 to Spare Tire. In each of the games,
however, Swarthmore continued its inspired play
and won the respect of the Club teams with their
feisty play. The final game for the Earthworms
was against a motley Eastern College team, and
saw the Earthworms prevail 12-2.
The B Team's eleven-man freshman squad

season records

played four tough games against some of the
best teams at the tournament. They started out
a little disorganized but picked up the pace as
the day progressed and worked the disc up the
field for a total of ten points.
The game scores fell out U. Of Penn.-15, Swat-0; Mr. Yuk-15, Swat-3; Mr. Fun-15, Swat-6, and
Rage-15, Swat-1. The B Team received a big
pat on the back for scoring against Rage, by far
the best team at the tourney.
The highlight of the day was when Matt
Murphy out-jumped the man with "the best hops
in Pittsburgh" to score against Mr. Fun.
They're playing cohesively and moving the
disc against teams with over six times as much
experience. Several members of the B team had
hardly touched a disc before this fall, and none
had ever played for organized teams.
Swarthmore Ultimate finishes up its season
in the next three weeks with a Co-Ed tournament at Swarthmore on the 26th, and the annual Halloween tournament.

The Swarming Earthworms are playing hard and doing well.

explains, there is

montage is immediately followed by a disclaimer by
Hudgens, editor of the slimy tabloid
Hush-Hush that there is a huge difference between what is on the surface and
what is on the underbelly of Los Angeles, a city of both angels and devils. Of
course, the underbelly itself is just as
much substanceless style as the shiny surI face, with hard nosed cops, good-girlI gone-wrong prostitutes, and the truth always being where you least expect it. It
is this contrast between the shiny gleam
and the dirty floor ofL.A. that LA. Confidential focuses on, inviting the viewer
into a world of film noir suspense that
comes into conflict with the politics and
glamour of the City of Angels.
Based on the novel by James Ellroy,
LA. Confidential brilliantly portrays a
complex story of crime, suspense, and
hidden questions (let alone answers) with
the depth and insight, but without ever
,
losing the viewer’s interest. The story
focuses on a troika of cops who are each

Pearce in a role about as far as possible
from the cross-dressing Felicia in
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert) who is
both amazingly dutiful to his job as a
police officer to the point of earning his
fellow officers’ contempt by ratting on

Rolling Stones Burn Bridges To Babylon
by Matt Hellman

Everything

seems as it should be
in the opening seconds of the
first track on Bridges to
Babylon, the new album by the
Rolling Stones. Charlie Watts gives us his
best swinging backbeat, setting the stage
for a prickly Keith Richards riff which
floods the right channel. By the time Mick
Jagger starts yowling I'm not going to
burn in hell/I cased the joint/And I know
it well you're ready to believe that the
Stones of old have appeared with their
over the top bragadaccio and bluesy-rock
sound intact.
By the time we reach the next track,
Anybody Seen My Baby (which is also the
first single), it's clear that the Stones are
also trying to be "relevant," with only
mixed results. Anybody has the slick feel
of a 90's-style Miss You with a huskyvoiced Jagger once again pursuing the

unattainable through the streets of New
York. This time around though the Stones
have brought in the Dust Brothers (of Beck
and Beastie Boys fame) as producers to
update the sound. Their major contribution on the track appears to be a sample of
the rap artist Biz Markie which serves as
a lead-in to one of the final choruses. It
sounded out of place the first time I heard
it on the radio and repeated plays of the
CD haven't changed my mind.
Richards, the grizzly traditionalist, has
already gone on the record saying that "the
Dust Brothers took nine months to ruin
two songs." And the contrast between the
Dust Brothers tracks and those that
Richards worked on is enormous. The album closes with two laid-back, almost
jazzy (for the Stones) tracks featuring
Richards in which Jagger is nowhere to
be seen. These tracks, Thief in the Night
and How Can I Stop, which have some of
the most beautiful and subtle playing on

the album, show that Stones still don't
need heavy production to sound great.
That isn't to say that some of the more
modern-sounding tracks don't work. In
the pulsating Out of Control, Jagger
shows why he may be the greatest
frontsman of all time with his gripping
delivery of the lines / was young/I was
foolish/I was angry/I was vain/I was
charming/I was lucky/Tell me how have
I changed. Later, in the catchy Saint of
Me, Jagger himself plays the acoustic
guitar, copping riffs from Street Fighting Man, and giving a melodic history
of treachery committed in the name of
religion. It's odd, but it works.
But in the end what the album needs is
more of what made the Stones great
Jagger and Richards singing in ragged
harmony over a jabbing guitar riff and
tight rhythm section. In their quest to be
"interesting" they have almost perversely
stayed away from the type ofmusic they

do better than anyone. Biz Markie aside,
the Stones have nothing to be ashamed of
on this album, but I would have liked more
of the bluesy rock they were so obviously
put on this earth to play. It may only be
rock and roll, but that's how I like it.

College's orchestra-in-residence,
began the celebration of their tenth
anniversary last Friday, September
26th, with the performance of three
outstanding pieces. Orchestra 2001
is Philadelphia's contemporary
chamberensemble and chamber orchestra. It was founded in 1988 by
James Freeman, who also serves as
conductor, pianist and bassist. The
orchestra's repertoire is devoted almost completely to 20th century
music, with emphasis on American

composers, and of late, music by
Philadelphia natives.
Before the music began, artistic
director James Freeman spoke of
what he had foreseen as being the
necessary "ingredients" to the
event: First, he wanted to bring
back George Crumb's Music for a
Summer Evening, a piece commissioned for the inauguration of
Swarthmore's Lang Music Building in 1974. Second, he wanted the
program to feature a spectacular
soloist. Third, he wanted a piece
with a Quaker connection of some
kind, and fourth, to have Eugene
Lang present and participating. All

four of these components were indeed part of the concert.
The first composition, A Quaker
Reader, is an orchestral suite written by Ned Rorem. This piece consists of eight parts, each of which
begins with a narration. Eugene
Lang read each of the eight passages,
all of which were quotations from
famous Quakers. The music for each
section patterned itself on the text of
the preceding reading. Both text and
music went from terrifying and angry, with visions of "Mary dying for
her faith," to celebratory, in the socalled silence of nature, to sad yet
hopeful. After a strong, loud sev-

enth movement, the piece ended with
a serene and quiet finale.
Helios: Concerto for Oboe and
Orchestra, was the American premiere of the Scottish-American
composer Thea Musgrave. It featured Richard Woodhams, the distinguished principal oboist of the
Philadelphia Orchestra. This work
was meant to be representative of
sun god Helios' chariot ride through
the heavens. The oboe's journey
through the heavens and the four
movements of the concerto was
accentuated by different instruments in the orchestra: the beginning tremolo in the cellos, the

muted trumpet, and at one point
wild pizzicato from all of the
strings.
The final composition, Crumb's
Music for a Summer Evening
(Makrokosmos HI), had been last
performed 23 years ago in the same
space. A transcribed, framed page
of the score was presented to be
hung in the music building. Afterwards, Eugene Lang, principal
benefactor of the music building
and concert hall, bestowed yet another endowment on the school, in
honor of Gil and Mary Stott.
Crumb's remarkable and moving
piece was written for two pianists

and two percussionists in five titled
movements. The ideas in each of
the movements, some from only the
titles, and some from supporting
written text, were clearly illustrated
in the music. Freeman and
Marcantonio Barone played and
otherwise made music on the two
grand, lidless, amplified pianos,
while percussionists Susan Jones
and William Kerrigan dealt with a
wide array of percussive instruments, including, at times, the pianos themselves.

Big Independent Features Sling Blade, El Mariachi this weekend
By Fred Bush

and Jessica Harbour
This week's movies are not for the apathetic. Both El Mariachi and Sling Blade
feature the confrontation of a lone good
man against evil
that evil represented
by warring drug lords in the former film
and a friend's cruel boyfriend in the latter.
But if you like conflict where the good guy
is not simply good and the bad guy may
occasionally win your sympathy, LPAC
Cinema is the place for you this weekend.
El Mariachi, the Friday night movie, is
shorter, faster, more lurid, and more
cheaply done (on a $7,000 budget) than its
Saturday counterpart. A mariachi (traveling musician) carrying only a guitar and
his charisma (Carlos M. Gallardo) wanders
into a sleepy Mexican town, only to be
mistaken for Azul (Reinol Martinez), a
drug runner who happens to carry his weap-

onry in a guitar case. Azul is being hunted by
his former partner Moco (Peter Marquardt);
Moco's men have been sent out to kill Azul.
Not knowing what Azul looks like, the goons
chase the beleaguered mariachi instead. He
manages to find refuge with the beautiful
Domino (Consuelo G6mez) and the laziest pit
bull infilm history, but in the end nobody can
avoid the bloodshed.
There is plenty of violence in this film.
First-time director Robert Rodriguez
clearly enjoys staging action scenes; one
in particular, when the mariachi manages
to avoid two men shooting at him by climbing over their car—you'll see—is almost
beautiful. Rodriguez' action scenes flow in
a ballet of bullets; characters dance in and
out of harm's way, i nd each wound is carefully and lovingly accounted for. There are
quite a few slow-motion shots of wouldbe assassins recoiling from fatal gunshot
wounds, and the mariachi's own fate is

somewhat gruesome, but Rodriguez isn't
giving us violence and gore just to titillate;
with every man shot, the mariachi, engagingly portrayed by Gallardo, falls deeper
into danger, and the plot advances with the
body count. Put it this way: I, Jess, normally dislike both shoot-'em-up films and
mistaken identity plots, and I thoroughly
enjoyed this movie; I'd give it an 8. Fred
gives it a 9, and recommends Rodriguez'
big-budget "sequel," Desperado.
Saturday night is Sling Blade, also an
independent film with a much-heralded
director, Billy Bob Thornton. Besides directing and writing the script, Thornton
plays Karl, a mentally handicapped man
institutionalized years ago for the murder
of his mother and her lover and then, quite
suddenly and without his consent, set free.
He finds a quiet and stable life in his Arkansas hometown, taking a job as a mechanic under a kindly boss and befriend-

ing a young boy, Frank (Lucas Black, from
American Gothic). As the movie
progresses, Karl becomes a greater part of
the life of Frank and his mother Linda
(Natalie Canerday), but so does Linda's
bullying boyfriend, Doyle (country star
Dwight Yoakam, turning in a terrific performance). You can guess that the movie
will end in a confrontationbetween Doyle
and Karl, but you may be surprised by the
confrontation itself.
The movie has some great visuals, mostly
revolving around Karl. As he tells the story
of killing his mother, the camera shows
only his hands endlessly washing each
other. As he prepares for his final confrontation with Doyle, the camera silently pans
360 degrees around him, keeping him centered at all times. As he wanders through
the farmhouse where he used to live, the
camera shows us his viewpoint for the first
time: jerky, wavery, blurry, diffuse, con-

fused. Unfortunately, that's about the best
view we get of Karl: at times, he has an
almost mystical understanding of reality;
at others, he behaves as if he were profoundly retarded.
All in all, while the performances are
strong, Sling Blade suffers somewhat from
being a set piece with stock characters: the
idiot savant, the redneck bully, the gay best
friend (played by the amazing John Ritter),
and the kid who's wiser than any of them.
Throw them all together and bake, then add
occasional funny incidental music. Such
cookie-cutter filmmaking is not what you
expect from independent studios. Still,
Thornton does capture your attention,
whether he's ordering French fries (one of
the movie's best scenes), telling Linda a
joke to cheer her up, or conversing with a
bona fide psychopath. We give it a 7; it
would have been a 10 if it didn't seem so
hackneyed.

Administration takes cover as swat.talk opens fire
by Patrick Runkle

With the changing of the leaves
comes another Autumn of Discontent for Swatties, and what better
way to gripe about policies and administrators than on _swat.talk?
For the uninitiated, _swat.talk is the
only one of the _swat. hierarchy of
newsgroups (seen with Netscape or
a newsreader program like
Newswatcher) that sees any kind
of traffic at all. The messages
posted on _swat.talk are often stunningly insightful critiques of Swat
administrative policy and campus
life. So, here, for the first time, the
Living & Arts section ofThe Phoenix presents _swat.talk Beat.
A hot topic on _swat.talk this semester has been food, and Tarble
food in particular. Some of the
more exciting bits of discussion:
Rafi Dowty '9B pointed out:
Does anyone else realize thatthe
college is _making_ money with the
new 14 mealplan? We all thought
that they had finally given in, but
both plans cost $lBOO, and you get
14 instead of 21 meals, with only
$lOO in Tarble cash (or whatever
its called). Now, the way they
taught me math, shouldn't the 14
meal plan cost $l3OO (2/3 1800
100), not $1800?
Yes, while I think most of us have

noticed this intuitively, putting it
into perspective this way is quite
helpful. I'm forced to speculfie that
l
the administrators are embarf" ag on
establishing a new monetary s, ,Uem
on campus, centered around the
concept of Tarble Dollars versus
Sharpies Dollars. Stunningly, however, this is a monetary system in
which, once you give them the
money, you will never see it again,
regardless of how many services
you actually receive.
On a related topic, Melissa Binde
'9B noted:
Is _anyone_ else bothered by the
reduction in the amount offood you
getfrom Tarble ? I haven't gotten a
sandwich or anything, so I can't
speak for that, but I know an old
mainstay of my Swat dining was to
run by Tarble and get some chicken
fingers and fries. They used to give
4 or 5 chicken strips and fill up the
rest with fries,- making a nice (but
greasy) filling meal. I've gone to
Tarblefour times since returning to
Swat, at various points in the day
(to exclude the chance that it's one
particular worker) and have gotten
three chicken strips and a small
basket offries instead.

of all, its really easy to
modify how much access a particular card commands. If the card
gets lost, for instance, you would
just call security and they would
completely deactivate that cardfor
all campus facilities. This is also
useful for giving students additional access to facility's. Since I
am working as a projectionist, they
could have my card open up both

to both projection facilities. And
this access would not have to be
perpetual, they could simply say
that my card only opens those
doors between 7pm-lam on Friday
and Saturday nights.
Yes, a keycard system would be
really nifty, but it would require

move on to talk about more important things like average SAT scores
and law school admissions.
This is an impressive observation,
and since the actual amount of
crime at Swat (especially the kind
of crime prevented by having
locked doors) is so amazingly low,
the only possible reason has to be
outward appearances. Most people
here keep their doors unlocked
most of the time, and nothing ever
comes of it. No one has ever stolen my Die Hard 111 poster or
Donna Summer albums. Locking
the doors is just an easy way to answer to parents, with the unfortunate side effect of pissing us all off.
A possible keycard solution was
suggested by several _swat.talk
posters, Greg Ingber '9B said it
best:
Each card is encoded with an ID
number, and that number is stored
in a database (so each student has
their own card ID number). Every
door that is hooked up to the system also has its own identity. The
way it works is that when you stick
a card into a door, that door checks
the database to see if the number
on that card corresponds to the list

seems odd considering she didn't

Here I would have to speculate
that the 'weight' she was referring
to was how much you will gain if
you eat Fingers & Fries on a regular basis. It certainly could not be
weight of the french fries, because
everyone knows that they still are
unable to exact any kind of portion
control. And the wildly variable
size of the fingers throws thewhole
3-finger limit into unfair disarray.
Actually, portion control is an unAmerican concept that nesds to be

end, we've put together a proposal

_swat.talk heated up again when
the subject of perpetually-locked
dorms was discussed. Dave
Mimno '9B had this to say:
My impression has always been
that dorms are now locked to reassure concerned parents. You remember that one person in every

City of

The Agony and the
Ecstasy, India-style
from INDIA, BI

This past year I spent four months
traveling in India. I went there with
the intention of doing volunteer
work and touring the country, but
when I discovered the rich spiritual
traditions India had to offer, my
tplans changed. After three weeks
of teaching English at a village
school, I arrived at my first Ashram.
An Ashram is a community developed around a Guru, someone
thought to have attained or be close
to attaining Self-Realization. This
Ashram, at Arunachala mountain,
was a very devotionalAshram. The
Guru was dead and the people worshipped him, God, and the truth of
them being one. The meaning of
their worship is slightly different

from, for instance, a Christian form

of worship, and I learned a lot from
it. They still have one God, but everything imaginable can be worshipped as God because it is all seen
as a manifestation of God. When
really incorporated into life, this
can be very beautiful and inspiring.
As I grew to understand their practices, my days were filled with loving devotion. I had a mantra running through my head every waking minute of the day, fervent with
devotion to God to the universe
to life. I stayed for a week, seized
by a state of both ecstacy and agony
for deliverance to God.
I wanted to see what other
Ashrams and Gurus were like, so I
traveled via a cramped overnight
trainride to Coimbatore. The teach-

B3

ings here are calmer, more intellectual. They believe that Self-Realization can be intellectually realized. Itinvolves a mental shift, following a process of alignment to
moral principles and understanding
of the practical teachings. I had the
opportunity of speaking, with the
Guru here, Swami Dayananda
Saraswati, and asking him questions. His explanations were simple
and beautiful. He teaches no beliefs. Instead, he explains in common logic the adherence to moral
principles and how our own self can
be nothing other than God. Then it
must be thought over, applied and
questioned until the complete shift
is made. It helped me so much to
hear such a complete explanation
of Self-Realization and the entire
spiritual process. The
Swami demystified the
teachings for me, anc
helped me to understanc
how truthful and logica
the teachings were.
Again, I stayed a week.
My intentions were more
exploratory than devotional.
I visited two more
Ashrams, one with a
woman Guru, Mata
Amritanandamaya, and
another in Rishikesh,
where the Beatles went to
meet their Guru. I travelled around the deser
