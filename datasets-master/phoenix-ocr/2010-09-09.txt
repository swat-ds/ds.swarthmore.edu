Cornell Visiting Professor Sudharshan Seneviratne looks at his notes during his class on Buddhist ideology and social response.

BY AARON FREEDMAN
afreedmanl@swarthmore.edu

The religion department's latest visiting professor never went to divinity
school. He's neither a pulpit figure nor
even a religious scholar. In fact, virtually all of his academic and professional

background has been focused on one
field archaeology.
Nonetheless, this year's Cornell
Visiting
Professor,
Sudharshan
Seneviratne, chair of Sri Lanka's
University of Peradeniya's archaeology
department, will be temporarily joining
the college's religion faculty.
For some, it may seem odd to see a
career archaeological scholar teaching
courses in a completely different department, but Seneviratne said that the
many subjects that he studies are all
closely related.
"Art of religion, culture ofreligion, it
is all part of archaeology," Seneviratne
said. This relationship is made especially apparent in the professor's new course
this semester, Buddhist Ideology and
Social Response, in which a history of
the Buddhist faith and its cultural
impact, such as in its art and archaeological artifacts, is also combined with a
look at Buddhism's response to other
large social movements in South Asia,
such as colonialism and nationalism. .
Associate Provost Lisa Smuylan said
that the Provost's office, which chooses
the Cornell Visiting Professor from a list
of nominees, had trouble deciding which
department Prof. Seneviratne would
teach in. "Prof. Seneviratne is a professor of archaeology; because we don't
have a department of archaeology, we
explored a range of possible departments
to host him. Given his interdisciplinary
scholarship, there were a number of
options, including the religion depart-

,

ment, which is where he is currently
housed."
In his course, Seneviratne is doing
what he is most adept at taking archaeological history, religious analysis, and
peace & conflict studies, and combining
them seamlessly into one course. In
Seneviratne's words, "religion does not
exist in a vacuum."
Much ofSeneviratne's understanding
ofreligion as a synthesis ofother aspects
ofculture stems from his time at Ananda
College, a primary and secondary school
in the Sri Lankan city of Colombo. For
Seneviratne, Ananda was an early example of a school in South Asia that promoted local culture, Buddhism, and anticolonial sentiments, as opposed to the
"parochialism and fundamentalism"
that was and still is prevalent in schools
around the world.
These values of pride in one's history
and culture are ones that Seneviratne
has carried with him from his time at
Ananda through his ten years of university education in India, and into his
work today.
In Buddhist Ideology and Social
Response, Seneviratne tries to impart
not only historical principles but also
these values to his students. Yet,
Seneviratne acknowledges that this can
sometimes be difficult. "The majority of
the students were not familiar with
South Asia [it is] challenging for me to
break in all of this history that is not
familiar," he said.
However, Seneviratne does acknowledge that his students "are open to
knowledge, but it is another issue to put
it to them. They are not familiar with the
culture, the region, the geography." To
help make the material more accessible
to his students, Seneviratne incorporates more "relatable issues," such as
early
Christianity
and

...

Mediterranean civilizations, into his
course.
"My objective has been to familiarize
the students with the religion and also
impressing upon the students that none
of these things are static," he said.
According to Seneviratne, one shouldn't
look "with a tunnel view at religion." He
joked that the "hidden agenda" of his
course "is to let students know that they
are not alone in the world; there are
other students who think in the same
...

way."

This message seems to have already
come across to some students only two
weeks into classes. "It is more of a social
science class than a religion class...We
are learning about how Buddhism developed and continued to evolve in response
to societal conditions, and how societal
conditions developed as a result of
Buddhism and other cultural entities,"
said Harrison Tasoff 'l4.
Christopher
student,
Another
Geissler 13, agreed. "Nothing exists in a
vacuum and ideas flowfrom one another
and can be traced through time."
The course material isn't the only
thing students like about the class.
"Prof. Seneviratne is a magnificent
professor and brings a valuable perspective that of an archaeologist. He sees
and teaches the patterns, the big picture,
the 'why'
he shows how humanity,
societies, geography, and other factors
interact to produce what we know as history," Geissler said.
As for Professor Seneviratne, he has
also been extremely happy with his time
at Swarthmore so far.
"Students are willing to listen.
They're willing to learn, and they're willing to learn with an open mind," he said.
"The liberal arts education you have
here is a unique thing you could call it
a gift to the world."

War News Radio story hits national airwaves

BY LAUREN KIM

lkiml@swarthmore.edu

The voices of Emily
Crawford
and Kyle

nation
last
across
the
Thursday. Their radio piece
on the Health Professional
Scholarship Porgram (HPSP),
which originally aired on War
News Radio (WNR), was
broadcast on nearly 200 stations as a part of "The Health
Show."
"The Health Show" is a
radio program that airs on
over 200 public radio networks across the country and
on the Armed Forces Radio, a
program provided for the
American troops fighting
over-seas. The show discovered Emily Crawford and
Kyle Crawford's radio story
on a public radio exchange,
where shows can be published and then republished
by any radio program.
The story features three
medical school students who
received the scholarship
describing the benefits and
their motivation for joining
the HPSP. The program promises to pay for medical school
in return for a minimum of
four years of service and benefits students pursuing, or
planning to pursue, medical
careers.
This public airing of a
radio story by WNR elicited
hopeful and positive comments about the project from
Kyle Crawford. "I think the
fact that a nationally syndicated radio show has included
this story in their program
[demonstrates] the professional quality of WNR," he
said in an interview.
He also noted that the
recent story is just one example of WNR's consistently professional level work. He said
that WNR's rising to operate
on par with official public
radio programs nationwide
could be attributed to the dedication of its members.
For Emily Crawford, the
process of gathering information and meeting soldiers to
make the HPSP story was a
rewarding and educational
experience. She reflected
back on how Major Hooten
had been "very energetic and
friendly," and also spoke of
how much she had learned
about soldiers and their different aspects.
"[Writing the story and
meeting the people] definitely
changed my perspective on
why people joined the military," she said. "I was guilty
of the prejudice that soldiers
just go out and shoot people.
But I got to see the humanitarian side of the military,
and hearing the stories of the
program participants who
were in medical school was
really exciting."

soldiers whom they had
"coincidentally" met on the
college campus.
Emily Crawford recalled
the fortunate circumstances
that helped her develop the
story. "I just met [the soldiers]
on Parrish Beach and interviewed them on the spot," she
said. "It was coincidental and
fortunate that I met them."
She had been working on a
separate story for WNR during the summer, in early July,
on how soldiers stationed
abroad spend their free time.
She recalled "having trouble"
finding soldier contacts who
were willing to participate in
interviews with her and give
her information. But meeting
the two soldiers gave her the
sources she had been seeking,
and more.
September 9, 2010

One of the soldiers had
been stationed in Iraq, but
both are now in the country
and working as recruiters for
the HPSP. Emily Crawford
said the soldiers were on campus to talk with the pre-med
advisor about the program.
She also noted that one or two
Swarthmore graduates go on
each year to join the program.
The information Emily
gained from these two soldiers
gave her and Kyle Crawford
the inspiration to create a
story on the HPSP. She also
commented on how she
received much assistance
from one of the men in particular, Major Leon Hooten, who
also made an appearance in
the WNR show. He invited the
two reporters to travel down
to his office in New Jersey to
interview members. While the

soldiers in the office did not
provide any usable information, Emily Crawford said that
Major Hooten's assistance
served as the basis from
which their story grew.
Both reporters also express
hopes for WNR's future.
"We got a good crew together this summer, all new to
WNR and very dedicated," she
said. "Since then we've been
looking to not only increase
our membership but also our
audience as well, and we've
been successful on that to
some extent."
WNR also welcomed a former member of the Associated
Press, Jim MacMillan, to its
staff as the journalist resident
who serves as editor and advisor to the group. The project's
budget fund was cut last year,
which reduced the job from
being a full-time position to a
part-time one, forcing the previous journalist resident to
leave.
MacMillan has two general
ambitions in mind for WNR:
extending the reach of the program to a wider audience and
enhancing the experience of
all those involved.
"There's always room for
improvement in journalism
and in storytelling so I hope to
raise the bar on every facet,"
MacMillan said.
Emily Crawford shared her
enthusiasm about MacMillan,
saying that she is "hoping that
[the advisor's] specialty will
help us in our goal of increasing our audience."

stereotype.

STEREOTYPE
PROCESS

1:

THE

VISA

Before I proceed with the cultural
documentary, I must first document the
visa application process, otherwise
known as the bane of every study abroad
student's experience.
The French visa process was as
stereotypical as it could possibly be:
long, tedious and nerve-wracking, with
even the classic heU-cat of a
officer thrown in for good measure. I
should note here, first and foremost,
that before applying for the actual
French student visa itself, every study
abroad student must first go through
Campus France.
Campus France is a specialized intermediary institution, which reviews the
student's academic record, educational
background and overall proficiency in
the French language. It is also a complete pain in the ass to apply through. Its
website is an unfriendly linguistic
hybrid between French and English, and
if you don't understand enough of the
former, you will be lost in translation.
The point of Campus France is to
obtain the all-important quittance de
paiement, the official receipt ofpayment
that every French Consulate in the U.S.
requires from all study abroad students.
After finishing your application, you
have to send a money order of $6O to the
Campus France headquarters
in
Washington. Campus France only
accepts money orders and will not
start
to process your application upon receipt
of this money order, which normally
takes two or three weeks. I made sure to
apply very early.
Thanks to an unknown stroke of fate,
Campus France increased the application fee to $75, the day right after I had

was pissed off. For three weeks, I
gnawed my nails into exceptional
shapes and forms, agonizing that
Campus France wouldn't accept my
money order in light of their recent fee
increase. Just about when I had finished
decimating half of the cuticle on my ring
finger, I finally received the official
Campus France quittance in the mail,
exactly two days prior to my visa
appointment at the New York French
Consulate.
The French Consulate requires your
personal appearance for a visa application. The Consulate also asks for the
original document and one or more corresponding copies. I made at least three
copies of the 12 required documents.
All in all, 36 sheets of paper. The
French visa application turned me
into an environmental mercenary.
Horror stories of people getting turned away at the door

intimidating cloud of disrepute, lis peuvent

in
particular. They can
be difficult. So I made more

copies.

I braced myself for the Consulate. In
fact, I braced myself so well that I was
one day too early for my appointment.
When I arrived at the Consulate, I was
unceremoniously turned away by the
guard. Your appointment is for tomorrow. My conviction was such that I
never bothered to double-check the actual date on the appointment confirmation
sheet. Epic fail.
The next day, I went back to the
Consulate with dampened clothes and
spirits, but still determined to procure
my visa at any cost. All was well until I
came face to face with the Consulate
Officer from Hell.
Madame was a redhead, with bloodshot eyes, massive eye-bags and a shrill,
exacting voice that rose in deadly pitch
each time she demanded a particular
document.
She began her crusade by taking my
photo for the visa, insisting that I press
my face as acutely as possible to the partition glass separating us to capture a
better angle of my face.
"Madame, PLEASE move CLOSER to
the camera
yes, no, NO, STOP, NOT
like that, but CLOSER.
And so on and so forth, until she was
finally satisfied with my precise spatial
location. This bizarre, back-and-forth
dance that I was forced to engage in is
probably why I look like a confused
deer-in-the-headlights in my visa photo.
Madame was, as the French like to
say, tres exigeante. She was demanding
and impatient to near-intimidating
extremes. As she demanded rapid-fire
for all my documents, the meticulous
order in which I had arranged my documents came undone under pressure.
She was also quick to pounce on
unwanted verbal mannerisms.
"Do NOT say 'UH HUH' to me,
Madame, I do NOT understand this 'UH
HUH,' say 'YES' or 'NO' instead. I do
NOT understand this 'UH HUH!'"

Finally, she was satisfied.
"Your paperwork is perfect. But
because you have a Filipino passport,
you have to come back in two weeks for
your visa."

It wasn't as straightforward as that, I
explained to Madame. I needed to have
my visa processed earlier than two
weeks, because I was leaving

i soon for the Philippines.

Iw

Madame scowled, and pondered the possibility of an expef dited student visa, which was
completely against Consulate
rules. She instructed an increasingly despondent me to return to
the Consulate three days before my
flight to the Philippines, for further
advice. It was, of course, without
the assurance that my visa was
going to be issued, given that the
Consulate never makes the exception to expedite the process.
I became manic. I griped to
friends, professors and even casual
acquaintances unlucky enough to
cross my path. I sent angry e-mails
to the Consulate. My French pro-

fessor and I called the Consulate

"I have the approval for your

When Madame's high-pitched voice
called for me through the speakers, the
most beautiful green page entitled
"VISA: Valable pour FRANCE" (Valid
for France) with the official seal of the
French Consulate General of New York
greeted my eyes.

"Please check that everything is in

order, Madame."
I nodded mutely, trying to digest the
reality that I was actually receiving my
French visa four days earlier than was
permitted
by
strict,
unbendable
Consulate policy.
"Yes, everything looks good," I managed to croak back audibly. I turned on
my heel to leave, with the full intent of
dancing like a madwoman down sth
Avenue.
"Bon voyage!" the Consulate Officer
from Hell, or rather, an Angel-inDisguise, wished me, with a fond hint of
a smile on her face. Meanwhile, she
scowled at her next victim standing in
line, ready to rip his visa application
apart. Was this curiously paradoxical
behavior stereotypical of the French? It
remains to be seen.
The French bureaucracy, as eloquently embodied by Madame, exceeded its
infamous reputation for being unhelpful
and exigeante when it came to my personal dilemma. Perhaps it was a case of
well-placed, propitious bureaucratic
guilt that she felt towards helpless college students like me, God knows. But
contrary to the stereotype, the impassable, uncaring French bureaucracy of ill
repute does indeed make humane exceptions from time to time. Just as long as

Artists explore the range of dance at Philly Fringe
swarthmorephoenix.com

Swarthmore is well represented at the 14th annual
Philly Fringe, which showcases pieces that artists selfproduce. Though coupled with the Live Arts Festival,
Fringe is specifically an unfiltered festival, meaning that
it offers a space to introduce work without a selection
process.
Assistant Professor Jumatatu Poe 'O4 and Associate in
Performance Leah Stein both spearheaded dance productions, "Unstuck" and "Japanese House/Philadelphia,"
respectively. Also, two alum-founded companies, Pig Iron
Theatre Company and Green Chair Dance Group, will
perform their productions of "Cankerblossom" and
"Gravity Theater," respectively.
Poe is the founder and artistic director of the physical
theater company IdiosynCrazy Productions. He majored
in English Literature and minored in Black Studies, but
as a student he explored the classes offered by the Dance
Department and also founded the Rhythm and Motion
(RnM) dance club.
His productions, often with a narrative element,
encourage the audience to uncover the piece's moral.
"The moral in my work is never explicit or didactic, but
there is always a sense that the performers are struggling
to find their sense of morality throughout," Poe said.
Watufani Poe 13 admires his brother's worldly artistic
vision. "[Jumatatu's] work always seems to be not just
beautiful movement of the body, but also a story of
human emotion. He also continues to connect his work to
political motive, seeing his work [as] not separate from
the world around him," the sophomore said.
Living in Philly, Poe is inspired by his quotidian interactions as he explores urban and metropolitan phenomena. Especially in "Unstuck," Poe is grappling with "those
subjects that aren't heroic
there is nothing fantastic
about them."
"I'm interested in how this anti-hero can become heroic in certain aspects, in a more realistic way," Poe said.
The collaborators interviewed four millennials, people born between 1980 and 2000, and then investigated the
internal qualities of the texts generated from these interviews. Performers then incorporated the reflections of
the words used into their own previously established
style of movement. "[The text and the performer's style of
movement] are from two very different worlds and we are
figuring out how they coexist together," Poe said.
The narrative of "Unstuck" is quite dreamlike in
nature, and Poe compares the dance piece's "blurred distinction between dream and reality" to the similar concept in the popular film "Inception."
Poe is a true believer in the importance of physical
practice in the human body. "There is so much that is
really valid in dance scholarship, but there is so much
that to really be a performer, the practice of performance
is essential and the discipline and understanding of one's
body. This is something you will be able to see in this performance," Poe said.
Poe is also an active member of Stein's company, but
due to scheduling was not able to perform in Stein's
"Japanese House/Philadelphia." Stein, founder and artistic director of the Leah Stein Co., specializes in site work.
She explores the relationship between the site's architecture and the dancer's expressions through movement.
"The strongest thrust or main theme of what I'm interested in imparting to students, which is the basis of [Leah
Stein Co.'s] work, is really listening and noticing and
being able to tune into more than what you can just see
and more than what you just think." Stein said.
The work behind the production of "Japanese
House/Philadelphia" initially began in Tokyo, in 2007.
Stein's collaborator Roko Kawai travelled on a fellowship
to Japan and later invited Stein, along with artists Hideo
Arai and Mika Kimula, to explore the Japanese architecture. The team received funding, and created the first
dance performance in a two hundred year-old traditional
Japanese house south of Tokyo. The team created a second production in Japan before bringing the project back
to Philly for its third incarnation at the Japanese House
and Garden in Fairmount Park.
The Japanese House in Fairmount Park echoes the
intricate architecture of the original Japanese house that
first inspired the series of three performances. "The

THE PHOENIX

space and the site really is our inspiration and our
springboard, and the whole piece is coming from the
architecture and the relationship of the architecture with

the landscape and how the architecture defines space,"
Stein said.
In Japanese architecture, there is a blurred distinction between being physically indoors or outdoors. Stein
explained that compared to Western architecture where
one is clearly inside after closing the door, in Japanese
architecture, "it is very changeable and you cannot really be inside or outside or be both inside and outside."
Stein, unable to categorize the company's style of
dance, said, "What connects us is a sensibility; it's an
attunement to space and a sensibility to each other and
the space we are in and a sense of time. We are not drawing from that traditional technique."
"Japanese House/Philadelphia" also features a series
of paintings created and gifted to the Japanese House and
Garden by artist Hiroshi Senju. These abstract depictions
of waterfalls were controversial due to the fusion of this
contemporary art with the House's traditional architecture. "The calmness and appreciation of contemporary
design alongside traditional design is one of the most
important things we all aligned with. It's a beautiful synthesis of traditional and contemporary expression," Stein
said.
"Unstuck" is showing at the Live Arts Studio on
Saturday, Sept. 11 and Sunday, Sept. 12, both at 8:00 p.m.

those with

deep pockets, but it can be prohibitively expensive
for college students. But twice a year, for
two weeks at a time, over 100 restaurants
in and around Center City participate in
Restaurant Week, offering three-course
fixed-price (prix-fixe) menus for $35 at
dinner and $2O at lunch.
Restaurant Week happens biannually
at the end of January and the end of
September. This fall, Restaurant Week is
September 12-17 and 19-24. The menus typically include at least two options for the
appetizer and dessert courses, and at least
three for the main course. 119 restaurants

participated in the January 2010
Restaurant Week, and a list of participating restaurants
in addition to a map of
can be found at
where they are located

http://www.centercityphila.org/life/RWR
estaurants.php.

Restaurant Week is an excellent time

to take advantage of the city's fine dining
options
to put on some nice clothes and
have a fun evening out with friends. Last
year, several halls on campus organized

Restaurant Week excursions for their residents. If you have never participated, it's
likely that someone you know has.
The best way to have a good
Restaurant Week experience is to do
some research. Ask students who live
around you, or even professors and
deans, where they've gone and what their
experiences have been. Philadelphia's list
of participating restaurants also lists
what each restaurant will be serving as
its Restaurant Week fixed-price menu;
compare this with the regular menu. Is
the restaurant highlighting its specialties
or offering a high-profit medley of underwhelming choices?
Take note, also, of how much the
restaurant normally costs. Getting out of
a $lOO-a-head restaurant for $35 plus tip
and tax is a great deal. Getting out of a
$3O-a-head restaurant for the same price

is not. Nevertheless, restaurants all along
the nice-dinner-restaurant spectrum par-

ticipate.

Portion size may be the greatest
unknown factor in Restaurant Week.
Does a decadent three-course meal at a
high society restaurant for $35 seem too
good to be true? Sometimes, it is. In particular, if it is the style of the restaurant
to serve small portions
think sushi,
leave a
tapas, or dim sum
Thanksgiving appetite at home. The quality of these dishes may be very high, or
they may be very rich, but beware of the
restaurant whose small plates are neither.

Many of these restaurants feature
excellent wine lists or bars, but remember: alcohol is not part of the deal. In fact,
nowhere does it say that restaurants will
include beverages of any kind with the
meal. Whether or not iced tea with your
dinner or coffee afterwards will be additional is up to the restaurant; if you plan
on drinking anything besides water, plan
on paying for it.
In addition to menus, Center City
District's Restaurant Week website also
provides a link to OpenTable.com, an
online reservation service for many
restaurants, which says what major credit cards the restaurants accept and

whether or not restaurants are wheelchair accessible. Notice that some restaurants are cash only.
Some of the most desirable restaurants are booked solid months in
advance; others don't begin taking reservations until two months before the start
of Restaurant Week. This close to the
beginning of the event, a reservation at
Le Bee-Fin (which Chef Georges Perrier
announced in July that he would close
after 40 years of service
see Robert
DiGiacomo's August 27 article in The
Washington Post) would be difficult to
come by. But there,are plenty of reservations still to be had. Find some friends,
find a restaurant, find a time and make a
plan. Just remember to give yourself
enough time to get lost on the way there
participating restaurants will not be
inclined to honor your reservation if you
show up thirty minutes late during such
and know
a popular two-week period
how to get back safely at the end of the
night.

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Daisy Schmitt
Year: 2012

From: Killingworth, CT
Current Residence: Off campus
What She's Wearing:
"The shoes are just from Target, but they've been my
tried and true flats for a really long time," Schmitt said.
Her houndstooth skirt and white and gold-embellished
belt are from a Goodwill purchase back in 2005. "It was
just one of those fantastic finds where [the skirt] fit perfectly, and everything was clicking with it," she said. Her
tank top with lace trimmings is from The Gap, her necklace is from Urban Outfitters, her earrings were her
grandmother's and her bag is from H&M. Schmitt also
loves her glasses, which she purchased at SEE Eyewear
in Boston.

Schmitt understands the art of combining loud patterns with brights, a skill that can be difficult to continually master. But if you ever take notice of Schmitt around
campus, her penchant for mixing bright colors with patterns and basics is spot on. She nails it perfectly with the
sweet combination of her fuchsia top and houndstooth
skirt, as well as balancing out the bright and loud with
her understated flats and bag. While mixing patterns
might make you shudder with thoughts of a paisley shirt
and Americana shorts, it's definitely a risk to consider.
But try and avoid American flag harem pants.
How She Describes Her Style:
"I'm the kind of person that likes to mix really basic
things in bright colors with more exciting pieces,"
Schmitt said. She owns the basic tank tops, t-shirts and
bottoms but enjoys punching up an outfit with a patterned, standout item or interesting accessories, like
scarves and jewelry. "[lt's] kind of like having a black
canvas that I add things to," Schmitt said, adding that
her overall style description would be "basic with an

edge."

Schmitt also mentioned her excitement of putting
together a great outfit. "If I create an outfit that's new
that I haven't worn before, it feels like 'Ok, today is going
to be a good day,' and it puts me in the right mindset to
sort of go forth," she said. "I think that fashion is really

in that way because it can color how you feel
about yourself."

Where She Shops:
"I shop pretty much anywhere,"
Schmitt said, shopping at stores
ranging from thrift stores to more
brand name places, like Urban
Outfitters, H&M and Target. Schmitt
has recently started shopping at Pac
Sun, the store known for its thirteenyear-old-geared style. "I found some
really fantastic high-waisted skirts
there and dresses," she said.

;

Fashion Influences/Inspirations:
Schmitt is an English major with
minors in History and Film, but she's
found that most of her inspiration for
what she wears comes from films. "I think
that a lot of my influence comes from the
styling in movies, like in period pieces,"
Schmitt said. Some recent period films, like
"A Single Man" or "An Education," both of
which are set in the '6os, are among some of
the films that Schmitt enjoys.
Besides film, she also looks toward street
fashion and her friends for inspiration. "I'll
see a pair of shoes or how an outfit's put
together, and that will inspire me," Schmitt
said. "My friend Emily Leach is also a big
influence to me. She knows how to mix patterns and colors and fabrics like no one else."
Favorite Item in Her Closet:
For Schmitt, there isn't one particular item
that she loves more than the others. "I like
exploring how different pieces come alive in dif-

st

tant

ferent outfits," she said in an e-mail. 'TE]very- M
thing is my favorite." But one thing that Schmitt ■

regards as a staple, both for style and poor vision
reasons, are her glasses. She enjoys changing up
her look with different interestingframes and admits that
she's grateful for her poor eyesight.

as keeping hydrated
helps the body both inside and out.
Beautiful skin is infinitely more amazing than a fantastic handbag or dress.

Never Leaves the House Without:
"I never leave the house without my tinted chapstick,"
Schmitt said. She also is never without a water bottle.
Maybe this isn't a "style staple," but it's definitely impor-

tion.

inspiring mostly grief and powerlessness. But
after summer, we may find a reassuring, homelike sense of constancy in the majestic trees that
crown our lawns and border our paths. It is easy,
then, to forget that these trees, much like us, may
be only temporary residents of this place. The
red tree outside of Trotter Hall is a magnificent
reminder of this reality.
Christened "In the Shadow of Abracadabra,"
this thirty-foot oak tree of the Quercus macrocarpa variety was painted by former Scott
Arboretum curatorial intern Sam Keitch over
the summer. Keitch used several gallons of red,
latex-based paint, which he applied with a power
sprayer. The task was especially challenging in
light of the size of the tree, as well as the weather conditions and the required precautions.
"The whole process lasted a little over two
days. The bulk of the work was performed in the
middle of June during two of the hottest days of
the summer. Of course, I was also covered in a
protective suit and wore gear on my face, making
the process a bit more complicated," Keitch said
in an e-mail.
The Scott Arboretum staff selected the tree
because it was dying. It was the second such tree
to be painted at Swarthmore. The first one, a blue
tree, was done by curatorial intern Todd
Rounsaville in 2005. Rounsaville painted the dead
tree that stood in the Crosby Courtyard outside
Kohlberg, until it was removed two years ago.
Alumni recall it with great nostalgia.
"I liked it because it was such a bright happy
blue, and from my freshman year window on
Parrish 4th; it seemed to watch over all the comings and goings in the Kohlberg Courtyard,"
Cecelia Osowoki 'lO said in an e-mail.
Katie Becker 'lO was struck by the discovery
of the white growths on the dying blue tree. "I
didn't really understand [when I first saw it] that
it was a dead tree just painted blue, so [later] I
was shocked to see that it wasn't as pristine and
blue. The fact that it had been blue had made me

art

forever, and I hated to see that
! think it could stay
it was still rotting anyway."
According to Claire Sawyers, the director of
the Scott Arboretum, painting dead or dying
trees is a way to make the campus community
reflect on the process of change, one which naturally includes living and dying.
the
"It is a way to turn an apparent problem
loss of a tree's life
into an opportunity, to
extend the tree's life even beyond its death,"
Sawyers said. Through a creative process, the
tree transcends the natural limitations of its regular mode of existence and is transformed into
something else, a work of art. While it may no
longer function as a living being, it now exists as
an aesthetic object.
"Most people observe a dying tree and view it
as [an] imperfection, as something that should be
discarded," Keitch said. "This piece provides an
opportunity to recognize death in the landscape,
and how the process of dying is not just natural
but often beautiful. However, this tree [is] also
bold and vibrant, and is a celebration of this
tree's life."
The painted trees are also simply intended to
j
jostle
people out of their daily routines and calltheir attention to the environment in which they
find themselves. "It is easy at a place like
Swarthmore for students to get very busy and
wrapped up in studying, and to forget about their
surroundings," Sawyers said. As such, the
arboretum staff chose a color that would contrast
with the natural colors of the landscape.
"The original plan was to pay homage to
,jSwarthmore and use the traditional garnet,"
Keitch noted.
However, Sawyers explained, this color
turned out to be too subdued for the project's full
intent to be realized, and so a more vibrant geranium-red color was selected for the oak. Sawyers
further mentioned the complementarity of these
blue and red hues with their surroundings. The
blue of the first tree played off the blue of the art
glass panes of Kohlberg, while the red of the present tree recalls that of the roses in the nearby
rose garden.
Slowly, the "red tree," as most people call it, is
j
finding
its place in the Swarthmore landscape.

Ask for stability from

college. Though potentially vague and

tired desires, they nevertheless are
important ones to expect.
But, truly, what students need most
out of Braun is stability and a sincere
pride in the college. It was naturally
confusing, even discouraging, when
the president,
four administrators
dean of students, assistant director of
student life and director of the Black
Cultural Center
left over the course
of a year and a half for NYU Abu
Dhabi, an NYU branch campus in the
United Arab Emirates.
While the college community
should be happy for
and even proud
of these administrators, their departure still leaves a void that naturally
makes people wonder what is missing
at Swarthmore, and what is better in
Abu Dhabi.
Beyond the logistical nightmare of
administrative turnover, student trust
of the administrators notably became
tenuous, if not vulnerable. Seasoned
administrators who praised the college have left and new people who we
hardly know anything about have
been arriving

budget cuts and a rough economy. .

Swarthmore merely as a stepping-

Liz Braun, who officially started in
July.
She is filling a role vacated by Jim

Already Braun

enthusiastic and driven, empowered

Nevertheless, it is important for
students to have certain expectations
for her, largely because this transitional time has made the college vulnerable.
What's key for us as students to recognize, however, is that we should also
have certain expectations for ourselves.

Sharples dishware not microwave safe
To the editor:
I am writing in lieu of some serious
concerns about dishware in Sharpies.
Midway
through last semester,
Sharpies began to replace some of its
traditional ceramic bowls, mugs, and
plates, with a durable plasticware
known as melamine.
Melamine is a tough-quality dishware, but there have been numerous
health concerns about its long-term
impact. Melamine is especially dangerous when heated because it absorbs
heat and radiation. As such, it should
never be microwaved. Microwaved
melamine can begin leaching heavy
metals and other compounds that some
scientists have tied to the development
of bladder cancer.
Last week, ceramic bowls and mugs
were no longer available for student
use in Sharpies. For a few days,
melamine dishware was the only viable
option for students wishing
to
microwave their food. Sharpies has
already (via email; last semester) notified the student body that this is dangerous and should not be happening.
Sharpies has recently provided disposable paper plates and bowls, located
next to the microwave, to ensure student health and safety. This is a very
important step in ensuring that we
interact with our new melamine dishware in a responsible way.
It is still important that students be
on guard against microwaving the
melamine dishware, which could potentially endanger our own health, and the

With the quick departure of four

health of everyone who uses that specific bowl or mug after them. We also

Sharpies has provided these

products specifically for this use, and
we should all be concerned with their
conservation.
However, the student body should
also be mindful of the fact that disposable paper dishware is neither a sustainable solution, nor one that many
members of this student body would
wish to stand by.
Until the student body and Sharpies
can work out a better long-term solution (most likely, a way to provide
ceramic dishware at every meal), I
entreat the student body to please be
mindful of the situation. Do not
microwave melamine dishware. It will
get hot and hurt your hands, and the
long-term effects are even more deleterious. If you wish to microwave your
food, use the disposables provided, but
try to use them sparingly.
Please also consider bringing in an
outside bowl or cup made of appropriate material
especially if you plan to
be using the microwave regularly.
Hopefully, this situation will provide
the student body and Sharpies with an
exciting opportunity to consider the
sustainability, and long-term safety, of
our current dishware use. Until then, it
is important that we work together to
preserve our health & safety, and use
the melamine dishware appropriately.

In turn, Braun should live up to the
innovative ideas she proposed at her
fireside chat last winter. For one, she
talked about holding open office hours
in a student space as a way to interact
with the campus. At another point she
discussed how "no study zones"
an
idea she had at Mount Holoyoke
could aid the college's increased
emphasis on student wellness and
"destressing."
She also notably talked about acting

proactively, rather than reactively,
about serious issues such as sexual
assault. Now, we would like to see
these ideas come to fruition.
Already, Braun has shown that she
is committed.
Last week, for instance, Braun,
Chopp and members of the Peaslee
Debate Society debated about long
term relationships at college. Though
a small effort, the event was a perfect
blend of fun and engagement.
Of course, it's not fair to put the
load of administrative turnover on
Braun's shoulders. But a new adminisno less

that a sincere desire to provide
longevity and, in turn, a passionate

But students must understand that

the poll.

this is all a collaborative effort.
In other words, students shouldn't
ask things from administrators that
they themselves can't or refuse to
offer. We cannot vaguely ask administrators to be engaged when we ouror, even,
selves choose not to be
when we struggle to define what exactly we mean by "engagement."
"Starting a dialogue" not only
requires two sides to participate but
also implicitly means that discourse is
civil rather than demanding or
demeaning.
While we live in a place where skepticism is valued, we should resist rash,
unsubstantiated hyper-criticism of the
,
administration.
And, of course, we should keep in
mind that administrators are people,

too.

Unfortunately, these have been
problems in the past that have split
apart administrators and students
rather than bring them together
something the college can't afford at
this unstable time.
After all, we are at a transition, and
it hasn't been easy for anyone.
But as the college starts to re-enter
a state of normalcy, there should be a
recognition
among students and
administrators alike that, truly, collaboration is a two-way-street.

Currently, roughly half of Dutch
youngsters start higher education,
which is similar to the ratio in the
United States. Opponents of proposals
to alter the Dutch model of financing
reasonably fear that far fewer students will pursue higher education
should they have to borrow to study,
rather than receive a grant. Nobody
seems to know exactly how many
potential students would forgo a higher education, but it's an important
question for any society. Should as
many young people as possible be

a whole.

Swarthmore Inn story incomplete
To the editor:
Last week's cover story entitled
"Swarthmore Inn project given $2
million grant" disappointed me with
false information and one-sided
interviews. Ethical, economic, and
environmental concerns about the
extremely controversial hotel project
abound among community members.
For example, several concerned
citizens who stand to be impacted by
the hotel complex have written eloquent Letters to the Editor of the
Swarthmorean over the past three
months. Where were their voices in
last week's article?
One piece of information about
funding for the project was completely omitted.- As a condition of receivthe public grant money,
ing
Swarthmore College must match the
public subsidies. Accordingly, the
college plans to spend $2.3 million to
develop this hotel complex, as recently reported on the front page of the
Swarthmorean (8/27/10).
After cutting over $6 million from
the budget last year
a decision
which harmed students on financial
aid, eliminated tenured positions,
and slashed staff healthcare benefits
how can the college justify lining
the pockets of a private developer
with this exorbitant sum?
Furthermore, this decision to funnel millions toward developers signals a change of policy from when
the plan to build a hotel was only a
few years old.
In an outstanding article published by The Phoenix called "A blueprint for a new Ville?" (9/28/2000),
college administrators made it clear
that the developers
not the college
would fund this project.
Another glaringly incorrect piece
of information regards the grant
itself. Contrary to the article's title,
no money has been awarded. Instead,

September 9, 2QIO

college administrators are busy putting together an application by
October 1, 2010 for $2 million in taxpayer money.
Although private colleges are not
legally permitted to apply for these
public subsidies according to the
RACP website, Swarthmore College
is doing all of the work as a "subapplicant" through the Borough of
Swarthmore. While Governor Ed
Rendell has preliminarily approved
the release of funding, the application has not even been submitted, let
alone approved.
The recent article also did not
fact-check State Senator Edwin
Erickson's blatantly false statement;
there are many places to stay in the
area, several of which have emerged
over the past decade.
For instance, the Borough of
Swarthmore now has three bed and
breakfasts, and Widener University
recently constructed a hotel less than

from
Swarthmore's campus.
Finally, the article neglected to
gather student opinion about the disastrous proposal to move our bookstore off-campus and sell it to Barnes
& Noble, as reported by
the Daily
Gazette (8/20/2008). We strongly
oppose selling our college-owned
bookstore to a giant chain to turn a
profit for a private developer.
Both the multitude and gravity of
concerns with this project are too
numerous to discuss here.
Thankfully, a town meeting has
been called by a group of local citizens. This Saturday, Sept. 11 at 7 p.m.
residents and students alike will
gather at the Swarthmore Friends
Meeting house to engage in that discussion. In the meantime, I look forward to better-researched and more
comprehensive articles in the future.

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION Mi

Argument over Obama's religion is getting old
BY MICHAEL OPLINGER
COLLEGIAN.PSU.COM, SEPT. 7, 2010
Enough is enough. As the Obama
administration attempts to rectify a
bleak economic situation in the United
States, two old but scary rumors about
the president continue to flourish.
Though they've been circulating
since before he was elected, Barack
Obama must still deal with comments
that he is a Muslim and that he is not
an American citizen.
A recently released Newsweek poll
shows that nearly a quarter of
Americans believe Obama is a Muslim.
An early August CNN poll found a
similar number reflected the belief
that he was not born in the United
States and therefore, ineligible to be
president.
Both numbers are actually higher
than polls released earlier this year,
representing a daunting task for
Obama as he tries to promote an economic recovery and deal with two
wars while a significant portion of his
constituency feels he doesn't lawfully
hold his position.
Obama has clearly stated he is a
Christian from Hawaii to no avail.
As the country deals with larger
issues, these false rumors based on
fear, hatred and bigotry must stop.
Obama finds himself in a prickly

situation, especially when addressing
the Muslim rumor.
If he repeatedly and forcefully stated that he is not a Muslim, he would
imply that being a Muslim is a bad
thing and a trait that inhibits one's
ability to effectively govern.
To make such an implication could
only worsen public perception of
Muslims in a country where many

But being different is exactly what
got Obama in the middle of the whirlwind of ridiculous rumors.
Were Obama a white man with a
more common name, no one would
question his religion or citizenship.
His name and skin color fuel the
falsehoods, particularly the "Birther"
movement, which bases its entire

knew he would grow up to be an intelligent, well-spoken and popular political leader.
Without any supporting evidence
for their wild conspiracy theory, Lakin
and other Birthers get exposed for
their blatant racism.
Normally, such bigoted beliefs can
be cast aside as the thinking of a small
fringe group. But the poll numbers
suggest a disturbing trend of racist
behavior.
As the president, Obama will certainly be scrutinized but critiques
should be based on his policies and
leadership abilities, not his religion
and birthplace.
Obama's election represented a triumph of civil rights in a country
founded on the freedom of all, regardless of race or religion.
But should these movements continue to grow, Obama's election won't be
nearly as historic or symbolic as originally thought.
It will just be an example of how
most of the country believes in equality, but a far-too-large portion of the
population still practices bigotry and
blind hatred.

Cross country teams to race for Centennial championships
BY LAYLA HELWA
lhelwal@swarthmore.edu

Running through open fields, rough terrain and all
kinds of weather conditions may not be one's normal idea
of fun, but to the Garnet men's and women's cross country
teams, that's just a normal afternoon. A typical race can
range from a 5K run to a grueling BK. This past Friday, the
men's and women's cross country teams ran at the
Haverford Duals, the season opening meet.
In that first competition of the year, Rebecca Hammond
'l3 placed 10th overall to lead the Garnet women with a
time of 20:27 on the 5K course. Leading the men was Zach
Gershenson 'l2 who placed 47th overall with a strong 17:35
finish. Many of the Garnet runners did not compete.
A season ago, the Garnet men netted a sixth place finish in the very competitive Centennial Conference and
earned a 14th place finish in the NCAA Mid-Atlantic
region rankings.
The 2010 Centennial Conference preseason poll again
placed the Swarthmore men in the middle of the pack in
sixth place. Seniors Patrick Hartnett and Alex Breslow
will provide guidance to this young team dominated by
first-years and sophomores. Much is expected from a very
talented sophomore class featuring John McMinn, Jacob
Phillips, Brian King, Bill King and Aidan DuMontMcCaffrey. Throughout theirfirst years, they ran many of
the fastest times on the team. Chris Wickham 'l2 is also
expected to have an exemplary season while providing
strong leadership on and off the track.
In an interview with the Swarthmore Athletics
Website, Cross Country Coach Pete Carroll commented
about the improvements of the team from a year ago.

"Maturation is pretty important; we have lifted expectations from this [first-year] group and rising sophomores."
Danny Cramer 'l2 added that "our [first-year] class is
very strong
their addition definitely improves our
team. On the men's side, we've had a lot of [newcomers],
which gives us more depth."
Swarthmore's men's cross country program has had
many strong Centennial showings in the past, earning top
three finishes in each year from 2003 to 2005. Coach Carroll
believes that with the progress the team has made and the
pure talent of the sophomore and first-year classes, "[in]
two years we can make the national championship and
become a top ten team."
Cramer also added that "[as] far as team goals, I think
we're really focused on finishing higher in the conference
and regional meets."
On the women's side, the team looks toward a possible
Seven Sister's Meet championship and a high Centennial
Conference finish this season. After losing the leadership
and skills of last year's graduating class, the women's
team will rely on some standout seniors and juniors for
strong performances.
The class of 2012 provides lots of hope for the Garnet

women this season. All-Region Performer Melissa Frick
'l2 returns this season after studying abroad in Ghana.
Captain Hannah Rose 'l2 and Margaret Lenfast 'l2 are also
expected to have impressive seasons after their respective
All-Seven Sisters and All-Conference performances last
season.
Rose is very optimistic about the many new additions
to the Garnet women's team this season. "We have two
first-years this year, Emma Saarel and Ximena Violante,
but we have several other new runners as well
Isabel
...

Newlin 'l3 switched from playing soccer to running cross
country this year, and Stephanie Beebe 'l2 is a transfer
student from Washington and Lee. All of our new runners
have a lot of talent and enthusiasm [to] bring to the team
it is going to be exciting to see what they can do this season."
Rose believes that one of the greatest strengths of the
women's team is in what she describes as.the team's "pack
mentality." "When we run workouts, nearly everyone has
someone running with them, pushing them to go faster.
The same goes for meets everyone is trying to stick with
the teammate in front of them. Even though only the top
five runners score points in a meet, the 6th and 7th runners on a team can displace runners on other teams, so
this depth is to our advantage," added Rose."
The Garnet women finished fifth in the Centennial
Conference last year, and in the Centennial Conference
Pre-Season poll, they were tied for fifth place with
Franklin & Marshall.
In a conference traditionally dominated by Haverford
and Dickinson in running, both the- men's and women's
cross country teams have their work cut out for them this
season. For the women, "[o]ur long-term goals are to race
well at the Seven Sisters Championship, the Centennial
Conference Championships, and the Mideast Regional
Meet in early November," said Rose. The junior added that
it is also a key "to stay healthy
last year we had a lot of
injuries that affected our performance, but this year, if we
stay healthy, we look like a completely different beast that
I think can take a lot of other teams by surprise."
The Garnet will host its only home meet of the season,
the team's annual Alumni Meet, this Saturday beginning
at noon.

No. 15 Garnet men's soccer off to another hot start
BY SAM LACY

slacyl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore College's season-opening
men's soccer tournament, the Garnet
Alumni Classic, was first played in 1998,

and has been a great indicator of
Centennial Conference success for
Swarthmore teams over the years.
From 1998 to 2003, the Garnet won a
total offour games in the season-opening
tournament. The team's conference seasons followed suit, with a total of five
conference wins over the six seasons. In
2004, Swarthmore won the Classic for the
first time. The team has now won every
Classic since and developed into a
Centennial Conference powerhouse.
If history is any indication,
Swarthmore's dominance at the 2010
Garnet Alumni Classic should foreshadow another successful Centennial season.
Swarthmore imposed its will all weekend, beating Gwynedd-Mercy 7-1 on
Saturday and shutting out Immaculata 30 on Sunday. Of the 10 goals scored by
the team in the tournament, Morgan
Langley 'll, Roberto Contreras IV 'l2 and
Fabian Castro 'l2 each accounted for
two. Langley also had four assists, tying
Len Cuello '95 for the Swarthmore men's
soccer career assist record of 17.
After starting the season 2-0,
Swarthmore jumped two spots in the
National Soccer Coaches Association of
America poll. The team is now ranked
No. 15.
Langley burst onto the national scene
last year, scoring 14 goals during
Swarthmore's run to the NCAA Sweet 16.
It didn't take long for Langley to regain
his scoring touch in 2010 as the senior
one-timed a cross from Pierre Dyer 'l2
into the back of the net in the eighth
minute of Saturday's season opener.
For the remainder of the weekend, the
opposing coaches implored their defenders to pressure Langley, creating scoring
opportunities for his teammates and

On Sunday, Swarthmore's potent

offense and beautiful brand of soccer was
stalled in the first half by Immaculata's
gritty style. The Mighty Macs frustrated
the Garnet with tough play and physical
challenges, holding Swarthmore scoreless for the first 37 minutes. But Kieran

The Garnet came out in the second
half on Saturday with a renewed focus
on movement and possession. The team
quickly reaped the benefits as Castro
scored two goals in ten minutes to put
the game out ofreach. The first came in
the 51st minute off an assist from
Contreras. Taking the pass just outside
the box, Castro turned the corner and
beat Garcia high to the right side of the

Langley at the top of the circle with one
of his signature pinpoint longballs from
the midfield. Wary of Langley's speed
and finishing ability, two Immaculata
defenders immediately converged on the
senior. Langley played a quick throughball ahead of Castro, who slipped
between two defenders and neatly
clipped the ball over Garcia for his second goal of the day.
Wagner praised Langley's ability to
draw defensive pressure in order to create opportunities for others. But even
more excited was Castro, Langley's new
partner up top. "Knowing [Langley] has
that eye open for me and I have my eye

open for him will be great for our team's
success this year," said Castro.
When asked about the assists record,
however, Langley showed the true scorer's mentality that will keep defenses
closing in on him all year. "Tying the
assist record feels great, but I really wish
I had scored [in Sunday's game]."
The Garnet continued its early-season
dominance on Wednesday, defeating

Jay Cutler comes to mind as well.
Cutler's going into his second season

come). Josh Beckett is one more year
removed from 2007, when he carried the
Red Sox to a world championship, and
now he's an injury risk with an ERA of
5.91 this year and $6B million left on his
contract, and that 2007 season is looking
an awful lot like the exception, not the
rule.
But one good start from Beckett, and
we'll start hearing about how he's about
to go on a tear. One three-touchdown
weekend from Cutler, and he's the quarterback the Bears have waited twenty
years for. That's what really sets these
players apart—their ability to keep
drawing us in and feeding on whatever
scraps of optimism they allow us, like
when Roddick periodically sheds ten
pounds, gets a new coach and re-convinces everyone that now he's going to
take his game to the elusive "next level."
Once Cutler gets through his "trust
issues" with the offensive line (an actual
term he used), then Bears offense will
really put it together. Following this
process firsthand with Burnett in New
York, it's become like watching a desperate girlfriend try to find excuses for a
guy who cheats on her every fifth day:
"I'm teUing you, he's reaUy a great guy!
He just needs to mix in his changeup!" "I
know he struggled in Florida and
Toronto, but we can change him!" "His
pitching coach was away for three
starts, and he doesn't like change, that's
all!" "Look how well he did against
Oakland—six innings!" Three years and
50 million left on that deal, incidentally.

Garnet field hockey opens with two impressive victories
BY XIAN SIEW HEW SAM
xsiewhel@swarthmore.edu

As Swarthmore poured in goal after
goal in a 5-0 drubbing of Immaculata,
one could not help but be impressed
with the team. They passed the ball
well, they defended well, and most
importantly, they finished well. The
team thoroughly dominated the game
and never allowed Immaculata to get
into any sort of rhythm.
On offense, Senior Sophia Ferguson
led the Garnet attack, scoring her first
career hat trick and adding an assist.
For her performance Saturday,
Ferguson, who scored six goals all of
last year, was named Centennial
Conference Offensive Player of the
Week. Ferguson now has 13 career
goals, the most on the team.
The talented and dynamic sophomore trio of Sophia Agathis, Taryn
Colonnese, and Katie Teleky also
chipped in and combined for two goals
and two assists. While this trio has
only competed on the college level for
one year, they play beyond their years
and, with the absence of juniors on the
team, have stepped up like upperclassmen.

Though it was Ferguson who was
the star on Saturday, the versatile
Garnet knows that any one member of
the team can take over the scoring
load. But even in the season-opener,
the win was far from a one-woman
show.
"Every single member of the team
contributed to the win," Ferguson said.
"[We knew] our options ahead of time,
we were able to make quick transitions in the midfield that caught our
opponents off guard," the senior added.
Using their field awareness and
understanding the offense meant the
Garnet players were extremely efficient and were also able to dominate
possession. Swarthmore produced a
barrage
of shots, outnumbering
Immaculata's attempts on goal 30-5.
Immaculata could never hold on to
the ball long enough to create rhythm.
For the Garnet, the best defense on
Saturday was a good offense, maintaining control and possession
throughout the game and maintaining
pressure on the Mighty Macs even
after Swarthmore established a 2-0
first half lead.
Even though Immaculata rarely had
the chance to score, whenever they did
have possession, Swarthmore was
quick to defuse the counterattack. Led
by defensive anchor Allison Ranshous,
a sophomore, Swarthmore's defense
was so strong that only one out of
Immaculata's five shots was on target.
That shot was saved by senior goalie
Katie Ashmore.
Indeed, Ranshous' performance was
so impressive that she, like Ferguson
on the offensive end, was named
Centennial Conference Defensive
Player of the Week.
The season-opening shutout was
immediate payoff for the team which is
in the midst of implementing a new
zone defense in the backfield for this
season. This new defense is something
Ferguson thinks the team still needs to
work on. "[The team] will be working
hard to ensure that the zone is as effective as possible by improving [the

18

team's] one-on-one defense and reac-

tion time to the whistle."
Once it gets the defense in sync, the
Garnet will be even more disciplined
and ruthless in the defensive end.
.The team is still young and yet
plays very cohesively as one unit.
This is a tribute to the strong leadership and great chemistry of the group.
From attending summer field hockey
camps to regular team dinners in
Sharpies, this group has grown close
and its members trust each other,
something vital to the success of any
team.

"Though we don't have any official
captains, the seniors have done a great
job of guiding the team in the early
part of the season," said Teleky, who
has 20 career points in her 20 games
played.
"The [first-year] players have also
really helped our team chemistry.
They contribute both on the field and
off," Teleky added.
Swarthmore returned to action on
Wednesday, traveling to Richard
Stockton. After seventy minutes of
play, the Garnet found itself tied with
the homestanding Ospreys 1-1 thanks
to the second career goal for
Colonnese.
The teams played through two scorless 15-minute sudden death overtimes
before the game went to penalty
strokes.
Catie Meador 'l3, Julia Tallarico
'l3 Devon Novotnak 'll and Ferguson
all converted their penalty strokes for
Swarthmore. Richard Stockton only
scored on one of four attempts as the
Garnet came away with the 2-1 win.
Even after the two wins to open the
season, the team recognizes that there
is still work that needs to be done to
prepare for challenging non-conference road games and Centennial
Conference opponents.
"Opening with a 5-0 win against
Immaculata is a great way to start off
the season. Nevertheless, we all recognize that there are many areas that
need improvement in order to be successful against Centennial Conference
opponents. We have a very challenging schedule ahead of us and we hope
to use every game as an opportunity to
improve," Ferguson said.
"I think that we need to focus on
keeping all of our individual skills up
and running with one another so that
we work even more cohesively as a
unit," said Colonnese, whose goal
Saturday was the first of her collegiate
,

career.
"It's also critical that we take the
momentum that we gained from these
[first two wins] and run with it rather
than either losing it halfway through
the season or just settling with the
level of play that we've shown so far,"
Colonnese added.
The Garnet travels to Widener on
a non-conference
Saturday for
matchup with the Pride and to
Elizabethtown on Tuesday. The team
does not return home until September
18 when it will play Eastern.
As the players look to improve and
continue to work hard in preparation
for greater challenges throughout the
season, they will also try to savor the
moment and theirfirst two wins. After
all, the team is still undefeated.

"A big part of our goals for

Garnet to 16 wins a year ago.
"We are technically very good
and physically in great shape,
so we put a lot of emphasis on
the mental things, and I think a
lot of our finishing struggles
was more about mental stuff
than anything else, having our
heads in the game and a composure on the ball."
"Right now, we need to continue to come together as a team
and find a rhythm, and that has
a lot to do with our attacking as
well," Anckaitis said.
Even in the two losses, the
Garnet received several encouraging signs as they look to continue their recent success, even
without five seniors from last
year's 16-win team. First-years
Patusky and Brock both used
their speed and footwork to create several scoring opportunities in each of the first three
games. Amber Famiglietti 'l4

"The [first-years] have done
a lot for us over the past couple
of weeks," said Spiegel, who
appeared in 19 games as a firstyear player last year. "They
have really helped all of us pick

up our play, pushing the upper-

impressed by the play of the

called one of the best recruiting
classes in program history. "We
expect that the [Class of 2014]
will be the future of our program, and we are really glad to
