Dave Matthews Blows
Through Swarthmore
By Andrew Robbins, Dominic
Sagolla and Emily Willits
For the 500 people who attended the
Dave Matthews extravaganza on Sunday, the time spent was well spent. Dave
and guitar phenomenon Tim Reynolds
put on a display that gave those who
stayed until the end a memorable afternoon. Thanks to SAC funding, concert
tickets were free.
Swarthmore's own Sixteen Feet
opened theconcert with a variety of songs
from theirrepertoire. They ended with an
acappella cover ofDaveMatthews' "Ants
Marching," while the audience was
treated to their first glimpse of the man
himself as he strolled onto stage to hear
their rendition. The audience was abuzz
with the Dave sighting, although a few
wondered, "Was that really him?"
Their doubts turned to smiles and applause as Dave and Tim re-entered with
their guitars. Dave promptly informed
the audience that since he missed his

original flight to Philly and had some
airport time, hehad "just smoked a
fatty. "The audience'sinitial shock turned
to laughter and cheers as Dave and Tim
began a jam that turned into "Recently."
From the onset, the concert had a mellow
atmosphere. This was partly due to the
absence of the rest of Dave's band. Normally Dave plays with The Dave
Matthews Band, which consists of Dave,
extra

a percussionist, a bassist, a violinist, and
a saxophonist/flutist. Sunday's exclusively guitar and voice performance was
a welcome departure from the usual largevenue Dave Matthews concert.
The intimate setting of the LP AC created a bond between the singer and the
audience, to the point where Dave began
telling personal anecdotes and jokes.The
casual atmosphere at Sunday's show allowed Dave to improvise and entertain
audience requests. One of the request
songs was "Granny," which was a highsee Dave...page

Field Hockey Wins Seven
Sisters' Championship

flattened the competition
the Seven Sisters Tournament last
weekend en route to winning the championship for the second consecutive year.
The Garnet defeated three teams, including Wellesley, the #1 ranked NCAA Division HI team, to capture the precious
championship title. Swat (now 7-1), allowed only one goal to be scored against
them, overpowering all of their
opponents.The team was led by Tournament MVP Danielle Duffy '9B, All Tournament Team selectionLia Ernst '97 and
theplay of goalkeeper Kelly Wilcox '97.
Swat's opening round game pitted them
against Vassar College. The Garnet won
3-0 with goals from Duffy and Michelle
Walsh '9B. Duffy said that, "although
Wellesley wasranked, we were definitely
the team to beat coming into the tournament." The pressure of being a marked
team did not, however, hinderSwat from
pursuing their goal of retaining the troS warthmore

at

phy. Coach Richard Kentwell said that
holding onto the title was "very difficult.
We were very optimistic, but as a marked
team with people wanting to beat you, it
was not a given."
Li the second round, the Garnetbreezed
by Bryn Mawr by a score of 5-0. Duffy
scored three times, and Ernst and Donna
Griffin '99 each put one inside the cage
for Swat. Coach Kentwell said that as the
opponents improved, so did the level of
the Garnet's play. "We tended to play
better as the opponent got better. Vassar
is a weak team, and we didnot play well
against them. We played better against
Bryn Mawr, and in the finals, we faced,
well, a very good team (Wellesley), and
we played very well," he said.
The Wellesley game in the finals was
undoubtedly thehardest one S warthmore
has faced so far this season. Coach
Kentwell said that his team and Wellesley
are quite similar. "Both are very fast.

Planning is currently underway to install security phones in front of other
dormitories at Swarthmore, as has been
done at Willets and Mary Lyons. Doors

least can be locked earlier on in the day,
such as at dusk.
According to Owen Redgrave, Director of Public Safety as well as of the
project, funding has already been provided, and now certain aspects of the
project must be resolved before more

Capitol Steps to Show Swat
"A Whole Newt World"
Bv Erik Huneke
On Friday, October6, Capitol Steps, a
musical ensemble devoted to political
satire which characterizes itself as "the
only group in Washington that attempts
to be funnier than the Congress," will
perform at the first Collectionof the year
at 1:00 pm and again at 8:00 pm, in Lang
PAC.
Capitol Steps consists entirely of entertainers who have actually worked on
Capitol Hill, fromboth sidesofthepolitical "table" and, noted Elaina Newport, a
co-founder who acts as producer, writer,
and performer, from those "lying on the
table."
The group originated in December
1981 when three staffers for Senator
Charles Percy were asked to entertain
guests at the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Christmas party. Newport
claimed, "We had hoped to put on a
nativity play, but in all of the Congress
we couldn't find three wise men and a
v irgin." Under the leadership of Newport
and co-founders Bill Strauss and Jim
Aidala, they instead decided to satirize
current political figures by devising creative lyrics for popular songs.
The group'sname, although seemingly
associated with a more or less mundance
location, is itself associated with a 1981
political scandal. Newport said, "A South
Carolina Congressman claimed to have
done something lewd and physically impossible on the Capitol Steps without
being seen." The Capitol Steps have
committed themselves to "going...after
every scandal after that," Newport noted.
Newport explained further, "When we

started, it was December of 1981, Reagan
had just started [his Presidency.]" His
"clear-cut right-wing agenda" of military expansion and "strip-mining national
parks" offered the Congressional comedians much material for their routines.
Yet the former president and his wife
once commented, "thank you so much
for the terrific performance...at our Congressional Picnic...you are all just as
clever and professional as can be."
Capitol Steps has performed for four
presidents in all, "five if you include
Hillary," and been featured on three national specials for public television,
"Good Morning, America," "Entertainment Tonight," "Nightline," "The Today
Show," "20/20," "CBS Morning News,"
"ABC's World News Tonight," "NBC
Nightly News," and many times on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered."They have also included targets
of their satire such as Vice President Al
Gore, Pat Robertson, and former president GeorgeBush in their performances.
Public officialscontinue to offer praise
for Capitol Steps because it makes a
point of making fun of everyone, reg?rdless of their political inclinations. Newport said, "We do have gVght-wing Republicans and left-wing Dewaocrats, but
we all seem to agree on what's iuiv.n v."
Newport acknowledged that this polity
was not always easy to uphold. She remarked, "It was hard to find a funny
Democrat for a while, then it was hard to
find a funny Republican...Now we have
the best of both worlds with Newt and
Clinton." She said that during any given
performance, "if we get the politician
[certain audience members] like in this

song, then we'll get the politician
don't like in the next song."

security measures are."
Phones will most likely first be installed in those dorms that are off-campus and are already locked 24 hours a
day: Woolman, Palmer, Pittenger, and
Roberts, where they are most needed.
Redgrave says that the phones are not
a cure-all, but he does hope they will
increase security: "In a college that's
open to the public, pretty much, there's
absolutely nothing stopping people from
justwalking in...people who just have no
business walking through [the
dorms]...you just play the odds, some
small percentage of that general population are people you don't want to have
there... At least if the doors are locked, it
provides a significant deterrent to something that could be devastating."
Many problems remain to be worked
out in addition to the door-propping issue. Installation in certain buildings presents certain logistical problems, as does
determining the best locations for the
phones at each building. It will be difficult to have phones installed at every
dorm by the end of the year, but Redgrave
says he thinks it's still possible.

How the College
Selected Kohlberg
Hall Contractors
By Will Quale
By now, everyone at Swarthmore is
more than familiar with the Kohlberg
Hall construction project, and knows what
the building will look like, about the new
coffee bar that will be housed there, and
whichpaths are the shortest routes around
the construction zone. But who is actually building Kohlberg, and how were
they chosen?
According to Larry Schall, Associate
Vice President in charge of Facilities and
Services, Lehrer, McGovem, and Bovis
is in charge of the overall job. The firm
was chosen after "a lengthy interview
and selection process where there were
lots of competitors." Criteria used to
choose the winner of the contract included references, financial terms, and

financial strength. Lehrer, McGovem,
and Bovis has "done a lot of work here
[before] and we have been happy with
them," according to Schall.
The construction manager then hired
its own subcontractors—over twenty of
them—to build Kohlberg, each incharge
of a specific task, such as roofing or
electrical work.
The College could influence theawarding ofeach subcontract. Schall notes that
the winners were again chosen by references, prior experience, financial
strength, and "in the end, on pricing and
quality." While anyone with an open
shop may bid for smaller jobs at the
college, the Kohlberg project, like all
projects of its magnitude here, is open
only to fully unionized firms.
Through this system of Lehrer,
McGovem, and Bovis and their subcontractors, we will have a new building in
which to take shelter, coffee to warm us,
and straight paths to our next classes by
next semester.

Inside this issue:

The group is able to maintain a membership derived completely from Capitol
Hill since, as Newport noted, "tens of
thousands of people work on Capitol
Hill, so some of them must be able to
sing." Their unique insight into the workings of government prevents members
from running out of material. In a press
release, Newport said, 'Typically the
Republicans goof up, and the Democrats
party. Then the Democrats goof up, and
the Republicans party. That's what we
call the two-party system."
Capitol Steps' recent musical creations
have included "A Whole Newt World,"
"Can You Feel the Rub Tonight?" (dealing with now former Senator Bob
Packwood), and "Return to CenteT," featuring President Bill Clinton dressed as
Elvis Presley.
In April, Capitol Steps even had the
privilege of performin p for the jury in the
O.J. Simpson trial. This resulted after the
group created a song in whichthe subject
dumped Kato Kaelin in favor of Judge
Lance Ito. When California radio stations played this song frequently, Ito became quite fond of it, and soon Capitol
Steps received a phone call from a court
clerk requesting a performance.
Although they were initially worried
that the jury would not enjoy the performance because they were insulatedfrom
what was going on in the world, Newport
.-aid, "then again, so is Congress," and
that had not stopped them from relishing
the Capitol Steps' humor. Newport concluded, "It's hard to be funnier than the
politicians, but that's our goal."

Congress Considers Fee on
Colleges for Student Loans
By Ben Fritz
According to an article published in
the September 20th edition of The New
York Times, Senator Nancy Landon
Kassebaum (R-Kansas), chairwoman of
the Committee on Labor and Human
Resources, has called for cutting student
loans by $lO.l billion over seven years.
$4.4 billion of that cut is to be financed
by charging a two percent fee to colleges
and universities for the Federal loans
their students receive.
This proposal drew ire both from college and university officials and from
Democrats in the Senate. Ed Elmendorf,
VicePresident for GovernmentRelations
of the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities, succinctly
described the proposal as "stupid," saying the proposal was likely to be favored
only by the student loan industry as a way
of avoiding higher charges to banks and
other lenders.
Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Massachusetts), the senior Democrat on the
Committee also denounced Senator
Kassebaum's plan, saying that the two
percent fee was really a tax on academic
instutions. He compared this proposal
with the Republican proposals tocut taxes
by observing, "The Republican Congress
has no business picking the pockets of
students and working families to pay for
tax cuts for therich."
SenatorKassebaum acknowledged she
had received compaints from colleges
and universities in her state, but insisted
shehad no alternative way to achieve the
cuts called for in a House-Senateconference.
Opponents of Senator Kassebaum's
plan say there is indeed an alternative and
that they plan to offer it as an amendment
when this proposal comes to the Senate
floor after its all but assured passage in
committee. They call for eliminating a
business tax benefit that, if struck, would
raise the same amount ofmoney as Senator Kassebaum's proposed fee. That approach was adopted by the Senate, 67 to
32, in May of this year when it was
proposed by Senators Olympia Snowe
(R-Maine) and Paul Simon (D-Illinois).

SASS Chooses New
Presidents for '95- '96

However, if this proposal is buried in
the huge reconciliation bills that will be
part of the budget battle this spring, it
may be difficult to debate this relatively
minor point. So May's vote is not necessarily a predictor of what the Senate will
be able to do now.
This proposal has not been met with
much enthusiasm on the Swarthmore
campus. Mike Schall '99 said that this
proposal would "indiscriminately discriminate against low-income students"
and would be "a deterrent for schools to
take on low-income students."
Abraham Nussbaum '97 inadvertently
borrowed the language of Senator
Kennedy in calling this proposal "a tax
on colleges for taking on financial aid
students" and saying it would be especially harsh on schools "with poor students and poor endowments."
Among the less controversial aspects
of Senator Kassebaum's plan to chop
$lO.l billion over seven years out of the
$25 billion a year program were:
•Decreasing from the current six

Approximately twenty students atmeeting held by Student Council this Wednesday in Parrish Parlors
tended a

about College parking policies. While
some students felt that the College should
devote more of its parking spaces for
student use, others felt that expanding
parking areas might come at the expense
of the needs of other groups on campus
for space.

According to Rahul Sakhuja '9B, CoCoordinator of Student Council, ten percent of parking spaces are devoted to
student use. The rest of the spaces are

used by members of the faculty, staff,
and administration as well as visitors.
Seth Harvey '97, however, mentioned
that the College granted more permits to
students than spaces were available. Although only 115 spaces were planned to
be available to students, 135permits were
granted. Other spaces are reserved for
students with special needs, who can
apply for temporary parking permits during the course of the semester..
Jill Rubin '97 asked what the criteria
for the distribution of parking permits
were. Jen Hayoun '97 said that, based on
her conversations with Leon Francis,
Assistant Director of Public Safety, the

decisions were based primarily on seniority. Of the 135 permits granted this
year, 115 went to seniors, 10 to commuting students, and 10 to underclasspeople

his mind, undermines "community involvement" because it does not sufficiendy take into account the needs of
underclasspeople who need cars for community service projects. Makler offered
to "drive a senior to the movies" if s/he
felt s/he needed a car for social reasons.
Hayoun noted that changing the
seniorirty system would not be fair to
those who had viewed parking as a privilege for which "everyone has to wait
their turn."
Caitlin VanDusen '97, however, suggested, "Can't they distributethem [parking spaces] first by need, and then give
what's left to seniors?" Carl Heiberg '96
noted that "you have to make definite
restrictions on what 'needs' [would] include." Hayoun mentioned that emphasizing need would go contrary to the
College's policy of honoring seniority in
other areas, and Alisha Pennix '97 also
remarked, "I don'tknow if I like the idea
of scrapping the seniority system."
Pennix noted,- however, that "if you
bring acar to campus, you shouldn't have
to walk 10 miles to get it." Since many of
the more conveniently located spaces are
reserved for visitors, Jude Uzonwanne
'9B suggested that "Public Safety...keep
a tally of the usage of visitor parking
spaces" and see whether more of them
could or could not be opened for student
use. Hayoun added, "Maybe there could
be a condition [for occupying certain
parking spots]...that you do two medical
runs" or vacate those spots before and
during special events that attract a lot of
visitors to the campus.
Students then wondered whether or
not more parking lots could be constructed. Makler suggested a lot behind
the bleachers of the football field, near
the StrawBale House, but Eddie Shin '97
noted that the track team uses that space
to practice shot put and discus throwing.
Sakhuja also floated the notion of using
some of the fields near the Jumping Cow.
Nancy Benson-Nicol '9B, however, noted
that any expansion for "increasing land
[use] would go to expanding faculty and
staff housing."
Makler noted that students who parked
in the Ville to circumvent campus park-

ing regulations would probably add to

tension between the College and the borough. Yet Harvey noted that increasing
the space devoted to parking would decrease space available for other purposes.
Although the meeting produced no single
set of simple solutions, it did allow the
StudentCouncil and other concerned students to contemplate different aspects of
this multifaceted issue.

wantto consider a new connotation of the
word. The Swarthmore African American Student Society resumes its activities for theacademic year with a meeting
this Sunday, October 1, at 7:00 pm in the
Black Cultural Center, under the directionofits new co-presidents Ni Ya Costley
'97 and Tanisha Little '97. The society
will continue tomeet every other Sunday
throughout the year.
Although SASS normally chooses its
new leadership towards the end of the
spring semester, this year the election
was postponed until the fall semester due
to an lack of potential candidates, according to Seth Harvey '97, an active
member.
SASS is designed to be a "political,
educational, cultural, social, and supportive organization which develops programs and activities that maintain the
understanding of African-diasporan experiences," as stated in the '95- '96 Guide
to Student Life. When asked what SASS
meant to her personally, Little described
it as "a friend who's always there for

to help its members survive in an environment that can be new and shocking to
some of the African-American commu-

nity."

Yet SASS also extends its activities
far into the all-inclusive domains of political, social, and cultural awareness and
education. Harvey notes, "It might seem
that SASS is very much an introverted
group, but that is not the case. SASS'
continued existence in this community is
based upon the need to support and then
educate. SASS will be able to educate
when it is comfortable with the level of
support it is providing its members. Edu-

cating could be very harmful if SASS
were not firmly rooted in the support of
its members." He continues, saying that
"as a multifunctional organization, itaddresses many of the concerns of members of the black community through
providing support and guidance for its
many diverse members, but SASS does
not end there. It also branches out and

as a political entity and actively
participates in the lively debates thatpaint
the campus" and that "this function of
SASS is not only vital, but necessary to
fill a void of ideas here at Swat."
Last year, under the direction of its
president Rebeccah Bennett '96, SASS
engaged itself in many outreach efforts
involving other organizations on campus
acts

Co-President Tanisha Little '97 described
SASS as "a friend who's always there for
academic, social, and emotional support; a
vehicle to get things accomplished."
academic, social, and emotional support;
a vehicle to get things accomplished"
and as "a very important part of [her] life
and existence at Swarthmore." Brenda
Ayers '97 added that "as a support group
it allows you to be yourself in your own

space."

What is a support group? Along with
several other organizations on campus,
such as SAO (the Swarthmore Asian Or-

ganization), HOLA (Hispanic Organization for Latin American Awareness), and
LBGA (Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Alliance), SASS carries the status of a "closed
support group," which means that in order to address its function effectively,
meetings are open only to students within

the specified group. Harvey says, "S ASS'
role as a support for African-Americans
on this campus is derived from the need

concerned with diversity issues. Among
many achievements, last year SASS initiated the now-annual Harambee festival, which is an outdoor extravaganza of
diversity celebration featuring live music, theater, dance, and vendors of all
varieties, all with the mission of fostering inclusivity and strengthening the
Swarthmore community.

Additionally, SASS received grants

from the Cooper Foundation, which has
allowed them to slate various speakers
and activities for this year. See the classy
Cooper flyers floating around for details
on the many upcoming opportunities to
meet and appreciate the workofrenowned
scholars, artists, and leaders. Look for
other SASS sponsored events this year,
as their full agenda is as yet undetermined but certain to be ambitious.

Committee Set to Begin National Search for Dean

of Admissions

The College is conducting a national search to fill the position of Dean of
Admissions. The search committee is chaired by Provost JennieKeith and includes
Thompson Bradley, Professor of Russian; Robert Gross '62, Associate Dean of the
College for Academic Affairs; Pieter Judson '7B, Assistant Professor of History;
Tracy Collins Matthews, Associate Dean of Admissions; and Janet Talvacchia,
Associate Professor of Mathematics. Two student members will be named to the
committee.
The Dean ofAdmissions provides leadership for the College's efforts to recruit
a diverse and academically excellent student body, and the search committee is
working to develop a large pool of applicants from which to choose the person who
can best fulfill this role for Swarthmore. The committee welcomes nominations
from all members of the College community. Suggestions of individuals who
would be good sources of nominations would be very useful to the Committee as
well. Nominations as well as direct applications should be submitted to Jennie
Keith by October 31. The College hopes to fill the position by July 1, 1996.

As part of the democracy training
course, which Weinstein conceived in
his coursework at S warthmore, theSouth
African students volunteer their services
to non-profit community service organizations. Students in the program this past
summer worked for such orgnanizations
as an adoption center, a law center dedi-

cated to the legal rights of women, a
career skills training center, and a child
welfare society.
To prepare himself for his work at
Zonnebloem, Weinstein spent two
months living in the nearby township of
Guguletu—thesite of the widelyreported
murder of Amy Biehl, an American college student, in 1993. Weinstein says he
immersedhimself in black SouthAfrican
culture to gain a better understanding of
the challenges facing the country's democracy builders, and to erase any
"Eurocentric" biases in his teaching.

Since returning to S warthmore in August, Weinstein has been working to secure grants to fund the South Africa democracy education program on a wider
scale. His first step, he said, is to fmd
money to hire a full-time executive director to replace him.
Weinstein's work in South Africa is
neither his first nor his last venture into
community service. He spent eight

year in high school, he was featured in a
San Francisco Chronicle story on "FastTrack Teenagers" who were making impacts on their communities before adulthood. Weinstein, as president of the Palo

Letters to the Editors

Swatties Strong on Complaints, Weak on Commotion
It is generally our practice to take a stand on a
given issue, expressing our praise or constructive
criticism about an action or a policy. This week,
however, we'd like to point to what we see as a
trend at Swarthmore, which manifested itself last
weekend.
A few weeks ago, acrimonious debate was
occurring all over campus about the (then) impending Dave Matthews concert. The issues at the
timeseemed very pungent and vital. When it was
announced that the performance was to be held in
the auditorium of the Lang Performing Arts Center, which has a capacity for a limited number of
students, furor erupted amongst the student body.
The concept at the heart of the debate: since a
significantportion of ALL of the students' activities fees was going towards paying for this show,
it was outrageous that not all of the students could
attend. Other controversial issues included the
fact that only Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds
were playing and not the full Matthews B and, that
the concert would overlap with the beginning of
Rosh Hashana, and that students would have to
wait in line a week in advance for tickets. Indeed,
many a Sharpies conversation dealt with the
complications of the Dave Matthews show.
Now, almost

a full week after Dave Matthews

performed at Swarthmore, it seems that he came
and went without much fanfare. Many members
ofThePhoenix staff itself were guilty for tirading
against SAC and their decision to hold the concert
in this manner. Yet whatdid these very people do
on the day of the concert? Jen Philpott spent her
Sunday afternoon in McCabe, while Erik Huneke
took an ornithology field trip. DanSachar worked

on his seminar paper. Tara Zahra caught up on
reading in her room. Both JulieFalk and Franklin
Rubinstein used the time to catch up on lost sleep.
Phil Spector went out to dinner with his parents.
Finally, Joe Khan did go to see Dave Matthews
but had to leave in the middle. In hindsight, the
actual Dave Matthews performance was not much
of an issue for The Phoenix staff.
Nor was it an issue for the campus as a whole.
When questioned as to the concert itself, students
who actually did attend it said, "Yeah, it was
pretty good," or "It was a good time." Nearly 70%
of the students polled by The Phoenix planned to
attend the show, yet fewer than halfof the student
body actually showed up. The LP AC was far from
packed (no pun intended) to its full capacity.
There are those who, like the majority of the
Phoenix staff, did not have the time or desire to see
the show. There even remain a substantial population of students who do not know who Dave
Matthews is. Ultimately, the Dave Matthews
concert itself, both for those who attended and
those who did not, was not a major campus event.
Despite what one might expect, there was very
little commotion to accompany the event.
Whatconclusions can bedrawn from this experience? Swatties liked to rant and rave about the
theoretical idea of the possible complications
surrounding the concert, but when the real thing
happened, not much was said. We at ThePhoenix
are not taking a stance on the issue of the concert,
nor are we prescribing some sort of advice. We
are simply pointing out that at Swarthmore we
often like to get upset in the abstract, but, in the
end, we happily do our own thing.

Faculty Viewpoint: Fernando Chang-Muy
For the past year, I have served as the College's
Equal Opportunity Officer. What do the words
"Equal Opportunity"mean? I myself didn't know
until I took up my duties last year. I'd been
practicing as an immigration and refugee rights
attorney for ten years, and now suddenly, I faced
the challenge of learning new words and definitions and principles. The Swarthmore College
Bulletin states on the first page:
Swarthmore College does not discriminate in
education or employment on the basis of sex, race,
color, age, religion, national origin, sexual preference, or handicap.
Where did these categories originate?The Civil
Rights Act of 1964basically gave birth to what we
now define as principles of "Equal Opportunity".
That Act, passed by Congress in 1964,prohibits
discriminationbased on race and sex, in the areas
of employment and education. Later statutes protected other "categories" or types of people: For
example, the elderly or persons with disabilities.
The laws which Congress passed protecting different types of persons include the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination Act, and the Americans with Disabilities
Act. And so, Swarthmore, as both an educational
institution, and as a place which employs people
(faculty and staff), is obligated to treat everyone
equally and ensure that no one is discriminated
regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, disability, Vietnam Vet status, age or sexual
orientation. (Although Federal and State laws do
not recognize lesbian and gay people as worthy of
protection from discrimination, the Swarthmore
Board of Managers agreed to do so on their own.
Therefore, it is College policy to treat equally
lesbians and gay people in the same way it treats
other groups of people).
For students who want to talk about an incident
or feel that they are being discriminated based on
one of the enumerated protected grounds, the
Student Handbook 1995-1996 edition, pages 56-

59, lays

out the procedure for filing a grievance.
Students are welcome to just come by my office in
the Clothier Fragrance Garden, Room 136, to talk
about whether they feel that they are being discriminated. All conversation is confidential and
will not begin an investigation automatically.
The faculty and staff handbooks also outline

policies and procedures which give guidance on
how to deal with complaints of discrimination. In
that context, an Equal Opportunity Advisory Committee (EOAC) exists. It is composed of faculty,
students, and staff and chairedby Professors Lynne
Molter and Steve Sowards.
One of the Committee's goals for this year is to
simplify and standardize, as much as possible, the
three procedures on campus. For example, some
of the procedures state exact times by w' '
complaints must be filed; some procedures do
One set of procedures lists more protected cat
ries than others.
The Committee urges faculty, students
staff to read the procedures for a couple of
sons: 1) so that people are familiar with i
rights under the law; 2) to give the Comm
suggestions on how to make the procedures i

To the Editors:

Every weekend, a student has certain options
for Friday and Saturday evening activities. The
purpose of the films which are screened on weekends is to provide alternative entertainment for
the students. It is with this goal in mind that
members of the Movie Committee convene and
select the films. We try to avoid selecting films
which the Film Society (whose purpose is to
educate the campus with "artsier" films) would
normally show. We do haveother interests, to be
sure, particularly to represent as many different
genres of films as possible. However, the main
question we have in our minds while selecting
films is, "Will the students want to come out and
see these movies?"
When I was a first-year student at Swarthmore,
few of the weekend films were very recent, and
more were older films. There were also very few
movies which students on campus went to see.
When formulating their weekend plans, students

To the Editors:
The Phoenix editorial of 9/22 questioned the

importance of the college's solicitation of current
students' parents. I have had the pleasure of

working for the Annual Funds office since the fall
of 1993, and believe that the information in this
article was misleading and one-sided. The editorial incorrecdy represented the Annual Fund and
its mission.
The goal of the Annual Fund is to raise money
for the unrestricted use of the college in such areas
as financial aid and need-blind admissions, computer centers, faculty salaries, utilities, libraries,
and much more. The college prides itself upon
having need-blind admissions. Without continued financial support from parents, alumni and
friends, thiswould be impossible to maintain. The
cost per student is approaching $50,000 and the
cost paid per student is currently approximately
$27,000. However, about 46% of studentsreceive
financial aid, thereby reducing the amount actually received. An article on July 27, 1994 in The
New York Times by Peter Passell, addressed the
distribution of the college's costs and the drastic
need for funds to cover the spread between the
average student charge and the average cost per
student (this spread was approximately $23,000
in 1993.) The article breaks down the student's
and college's costs. The college must raise the
money to fill this gap and that is where the Annual
Fund fits in. Although much is covered by the
coUege's endowment, over $1,600 per student is
provided through the Annual Fund.
I would also like to emphasize how much becomes available to students as a directresult of the
Annual Fund and the endowment. Our "sister"
college, Bryn Mawr, charges additional fees for
things such as local telephone calls, snack bar,
computer networking, etc. These are things that
students here at Swarthmore College may take for
granted.

rarely took the films into consideration. Then, as
time moved on, the films became more and more
recent, and attendance increased along with this
trend.By the end of last year, the Movie Committee was able to procure such films as Pulp Fiction,
and The Shawshank Redemption, recent meritworthy films to which turnout was very high.
Satisfaction of the student body increasednoticeably. One student even approached me and said,
"I want to thank you for giving me something
more to do on weekends." Such comments solidify in my mind the fact that students would
rather see more recent films. ThePhoenix opinion
poll this past week reinforces this conclusion, as
63% of the student body stated that they would
rather see more recent films on the weekends,
with 10% undecided.
I am quite confident that the MovieCommittee
is doing a good job; many differentfacts point me
in this direction. First of all, the comments I have
received from students are almost entirely positive, and include, "Why go out andpay to see these

campus?" Secondly, as attendance has increased,
so has our budget and our ability to rent newer
films.Finally, I feel that we have maintained a
very good balance among our films and that they
do indeed represent many different interests. This
semester alone we have had films as varied as
"Menace II Society," "Eat, Drink, Man,Woman,"
(a Chinese film) and the classic "Charade." We
are showing films of Whit Stillman, Barbel
Schroeder, and the Coen brothers, all (debatably)
fine filmmakers of our generation.
Hence, I feel theMovieCommitteehas selected
an excellent mix of old, new, and foreign films,
whilekeeping our chartered purpose in mind: 'To
provide alternative weekendentertainmentfor the
student body." Now it is my third year at Swat,
and almost all students take the films into serious
consideration when formulating their weekend
plans.

Solicitation is done through a series of mailings, supplemented by telephone calls. Telephone
calls are important to the Fund because they are a
more personal and direct mode of contacting potential supporters. Mailings are sometimes misplaced or forgotten and a phone call serves as the
perfect reminder. Telephone calls channel communication between the parents, alumni, friends
and the college. If these people are not solicited
their gifts will be lost, we, as students, would
greatly suffer. Imagine having to pay an additional fee for your telephone, for a card to eat at
Tarble, for your sports uniforms to be laundered,
for your paper to be printed out, for yourbathroom
to be cleaned, etc. These are just a few of the
things the college provides for us. So many
students take for granted the generosity of the
college. Realize that there is a need to maintain
this support and the Annual Fund is doing this.
That is the basic role of the Annual Fund. The
editorial specifically questioned the AnnualFunds
Office's solicitation of current students' parents.
Although it is true that some parents do not wish
to contribute, there are many who are eager to
contribute. The phone call from the Annual Funds
office serves as the perfect reminder in assuring
the parent gets a gift in each fiscal year. A phone
call can also persuade an unsure parent to give to
the college.
Additionally the Parents Fund Committee exists, which is a group of current students' parents
who makecalls for the Parents Fund (which is the
subset of the Annual Fund pertaining to parents
gifts) from their own home.This is not just some
administration bent on raising as much money as
it can, but a project thatinvolves the commitment
and support of many volunteers, alumni, parents,
all to benefit the current student
and students

contribution and those contributions are essential.
"My family can't even afford the tuition." Parents
of students on financial aid give to the Annual
Fund too. It is important that the Annual Funds
Office find the parents who want to give, and
telephone solicitation is a highly effective manner
of this search.
The Phoenix editorial also suggested a general
unwillingness amongst parents to give. However,
through past experience the Annual Fund has
been quite successful, especially with parents of
current students. In my own experience calling
parents of current students I have spoken with
many enthusiastic givers as well as reluctant ones.
This emphasizes the importance of pinpointing
those interested in giving.
Information provided by the Annual Funds
Office was misconstrued by the Phoenix editors.
Parents of alumni are often interested in finding
out the latest "scoop" about the college, while
obviously parents of current students have adirect
connection with which to find this information.
This refers to the conclusionmade that "while this
argument may hold in the case of alumni, we
doubt that the best way for our parents to get the
"real scoop" about Swarthmore is by asking a
phonathon caller."The importance of calling parents lies in keeping the continuity ofcommunication and in assuring regular giving. These calls are
more personal and direct than most mailings and
also serve as essential cohorts of the mailings.
I am disappointed by the general bitterness
towards the efforts, of the Annual Funds office to
increase support for the institution we attend.
However, I understand that much of this is due to
lack of knowledge .H ope fully this article has been

what can be a marvelous resource to show only the
kinds of films that most students have already
been exposed to at the neighborhood multiplex.
I want to emphasize that I don't feel this way
just because I ended up a film critic. Many of my
classmates, for whom movies are now a peripheral interest, still speak fondly of the remarkable
selection of films they were exposed to here.
These are works they never would have known
about otherwise, films that tend to be difficult to
see outside of a major city film archive, films that
enriched their lives. And they were a lot offun as
well.
If S warthmore only allowed in its bookstore the
kinds of novels that dominate paperback bestseller lists, or if all it did was admit familiar,
business-as-usual applicants, wails of protest
would be heard. Yet, today's students are just as
deprived of what used to be an accepted, even

Swarthmore Should Return to Screening the Classics on Movie Nights

I had to laugh when I read the article about
Swarthmore's commitment to education. When I
began my search for employment I looked at
colleges and universities because I had bills to
pay, but I wanted to continue my education.
When I interviewed for employment at
Swarthmore, I was misled by the educational
benefits of employment offered. Most colleges
and universities have 100% tuition reimbursement for all staff members. Swarthmore offered
50%, but after completing my probation I was
informed that it was 50% up to $250.00 maximum
for any one year period.
Recently the maximum changed to $500.00
but Swarthmore, the college with a commitment
to education, doesn't come close to WAWA when
it comes to educational benefits.
I can only wonder why one of the ten richest
colleges in the country, one with a reputation for
helping people, won'thelp their own staff. I guess
this, in combination with the Annual Funds office,
is how they got so rich.
I would sign my name, but staff members are
not allowed to express their opinions. It would
adversely affect their employment.

Is Colin Powell the Next von Clausewitz or the Next Ross Perot?
By Jude Uzonwanne
Clausewitz, an eighteenth century
Prussian army officer, defined war- making as a scientific venture that demands
the application of not just intellect but
certainimmutableprinciples. Theseprinciples include the need to have a clearly
defined objective, an offensive style, and
the economic usage of force.
In the twentieth century, many of his
ideas were consigned to the trash can of
history after detractors claimed they were
outdated and outmoded given the strategic changes in our ability to annihilate
one another. Today, his theology of war
is given doctrinal status inmilitary establishments around the world, particularly
in the American military.
One man. General Colin Powell, was
vital to that revival. To observers of
defense policy, those strategies advocated in Clausewitz's On War were brilliantly internalized in the Gulf War.
Therefore, it is befitting that Colin
Powell's recent upsurge of popularity be
examined through a Clausewitzian prism
just as Powell four years ago paid tribute
to that distinguished philosopher-soldier.
Without further ado, I will offer my take
on the Powellian phenomena in what I

hopes that in the course of the tour
America will pass through him as he has
passed through her, in the process initiating the beginning of a sensitive and respectful relationship.
Powell in the last few months has also
held dearly to Clausewitz's principles of
security, surprise, and simplicity. He has
ensured that no candidate has acquired
an unexpected advantage over him; this
tactic, as in the case of operational mobility, leaves him in control of picking the
location and time of any battle. For
example, inresponding to the announcement that Perot would form a third party
based in Maine, Powell simply replied
that the proclamation was just 18 hours
old and deserved further observation.
Rather than be trapped into taking a premature stance, he has deferred commentary until he can strike with precision and
even force. As Clintonhas learned in the
last three weeks, the general can launch
an assault with surprising accuracy. When
least expected, he has made statements
on both domesticand foreignpolicy questions. This, coupled with the "clear,
uncomplicated plans" he appears to have
and occasionally hints at, has won him
the heart and mind of many an American
and foreigner alike. He simplifies only to
clarify and not to diminish the urgency of
any public policy issues. This has helped
him retain the tactical and strategic advantage in all relevant theaters of the
possible 'war' for the White House.
Powell has stated that his mission is to
recreate America . That he is careful to
define this mission is a tribute to his
Clausewitzian background. He has fully
internalized even in domestic affairs the
lesson that an agreement must exist between the American domestic Trinity :
the People, the Political Class and the
Candidate. He will not run until the other
two groups indicate theirdesire and willingness thathe run. So far, it appears that
he is the last of the Trinity to make a
decision.

What he will do, I believe, would be
within the framework defined by his
philosophical mentor. Even if Powell
does notrun, he has reopened America's
eye to a world where politics is about
idealism, issues, morality, unity of purpose and mission. He has reawakened
the spirit of dignified existence in
America's disenfranchised folks.
America's political climate and landscape
it appears will never be the same again in
the aftermath of this Powellian blitzkrieg. Let those who will listen beware!

Growing Pains in Taiwan and Swat It is Possible
By Mike Scott

I was walking on the street in Taichung,
Taiwan. There were two seconds of
refreshing air-conditionedbreeze and the
scent of designer cotton as Ipassed by the
open store front; then it was gone. The air
rushed back around me the steamy, hot
mix of exhaust fumes and scents of spicy
chicken feet and other vendors that filled
the city.
My eyes were everywhere, darting
from the gaudy neon signs to the chaotic
traffic with mopeds buzzing around the
cars like bees. I was intent, on taking in
every sight around me. I wasn't going to
miss a thing. Nothing, it turns out, except
for the gaping hole four feet in front of
me. With my next step my left leg went
forward, and down. And it kept going
down, until I felt my leg plunge knee
deep into the sludge of the open sewer
duct in front of me. I had fallen into a
-

sewer.
What was an uncovered sewer doing
in the middle of a sidewalk!? Looking
back now, I realize that this was not that
uncommon. In many ofTaiwan's urban
commercial districts there seems to have
been a race to see who could put the most
new concrete into their street or property.
The construction would often spill out
into the sidewalks, forcing pedestrians to
walk out into the street traffic to get
around. The gutters and sewers ran together only a feet under the street. They
were covered by metal grates that are
simply laid over the opening and not
bolted down, coming loose after a few
motorcycles drive over them on the sidewalk.
The entire infrastructure of Taiwan
gives the impression that it was undertaken with more enthusiasm than foresight. From theroads and the sidewalks
to the housesand buildings (80% of which
are estimated to be built in violation of
Taiwanese building codes), theresult of
this building frenzy often looked shoddy
or half-finished.
The industrial expansion thatprompted
the building boom also brought with it a
new prosperity. Thenewness ofindustrialization was accompanied by a standard
of living that the island had never seen.
Perhaps this was the atmosphere in the
U.S. of the 1950'5. The goal of most
families seemed to be the purchase of a
checklist of consumer durables and outward symbols of material success.
The most obvious choice for the material showpiece is the automobile. It is
mobile and thus easily seen
more
people are impressed. Whether they are
made in Germany or Japan, the image is
thatofprogress, success, and of theWest.
The model names remain prominently
displayed in English, and the commercials on TV show the cars being driven on
California's scenic Highway 101.
Where are they really driven in Taiwan? With the majority of the population
living in garageless apartments and most

business area already owned by private
individuals (the average spot in dowtown
Taipei goes for about $50,000), you can't
really park.
Given the narrow, rush-job roads and
infrastructure I mentioned earlier, there
is hardly enough to support traffic in the
off hours. And during rush hour the cars
move at a speed that make the pasta bar
line at Sharpies look fast. But people still
buy new cars each year in record numbers.
In a conversation with one of my Taiwanese roommates over the summer, it
came up that his father had recently
a Mercedes, no less.
bought a car
While trying to look duly impressed I
asked him why, then, had his family
taken the train when they came to visit
him the weekend before.
"Oh," he explained, "We don't keep
the car at our house. My father takes the
train to work. The car is at my
grandmother's house in the countryside."
I started nodding slowly. He finished,
"We take it on drives on vacation and to
visit friends."
Of course, everyone has the right to
spend her/his money however it pleases
him/her. This was just a case that seemed
to me to highlight a mentality that praised
getting ahead materially above almost
anything else.
I had never felt this attitude to the
same extent in the U.S.. The U.S. also
had a much slower, longer period of
growing prosperity in which to get used
to the capitalist/consumer system.
At the same time as the economy developed, bringing the changes in city
landscape and consumer culture, which
I've discussed, the political system was
also transforming.
Formostof the last 50 years, the political system has been democratic only by
the most generous of definitions. Recently, however, the ruling KMT party
has loosened its control and allowed the
growth of true opposition parties.
In its eagerness to differentiate themselves from the ruling party, opposition
groups have taken radical and defiant
stands on issues from tarrifs on imports
to Taiwanese independence.
The fervor stirred up by the issue of
independence over the last few years
made world headlines this summer as
mainland China used a U.S. visit by
Taiwan's president as grounds for a new
hardline policy against Taiwan. Specifically, China began a series of missile
tests.

Taiwan has felt the damage of this
policy in the form of a plumetting stock
market, investment worries, and losses in
thefishing industry as aresultof Chinese
missile tests north of Taiwan.
But political violence in Taiwan this
summer was not limited to remote missile tests. On at least two separate occasions, the news reported members of
Congress leaving the debatefloor in ambulances following fist fights between

individuals. Here were bloody examples
of a vicious antagonism between parties
and factions, attributable, I contend, at
least in part to an eagerness to be as
aggressive and confrontational as pos-

sible in the early stages of the new political atomosphere.
Returning from Taiwan, I left a country I felt was experiencing what might be
called growing pains. It felt as if it had
overagressively jumped at changes over
the last 50 years. I saw this, again, in its
response to rapid economic growth and
to multiparty democracy.
I saw the same phenomenon in
personal reaction to being in such a

my
different country. It wasn't until I slowed
down and stopped trying to be robotouristthat I began to see things with any
understanding. Apparently it took an
encounter with an open sewer to awaken
me to this. But I don't think that it has to
take a misfortune to learn the lesson.
I doubt that Taiwan's infrastructure
and economic planning, its consumer
culture, or its political climateis likely to
be terribly shaken up by anything I write
(I don't even know for a fact thafXte
Phoenix is widely read in Taiwan.) But
for now I will be content to have my say
to a smaller audience
Swarthmore
College.
On the college campus I see the same
kind of eagerness to take new situations
by storm. Maybe it is taking five classes
while triple-majoring and running four
different clubs. Or maybe it is "taking
full advantage" of the party scene and
ending up with alchohol poisoning.
So often we hear the words "take advantage of your time here at Swarthmore."
I advocate the same, but the question is
how best to do it. The most important
thing is to think about why you are doing
what you are.
I know many here at Swarthmore who
have thought about it and decided that
hustling every minute and sleeping five
hours a day is the best way for them to
spend their time. Great; what is important is that the reason was considered and
the decision made over time. It wasn't
part of a blind headlong rush into the
future with your head so focused on the
goal that you miss what is in front of you.
Perhaps this happens most for firstyear students, for whom college is so
new. But it seems to me that for almost
all of us here at school, the process of
being an adult living away from home
and making our own decisions is at least
somewhat new.
Whose mind would be changed by an
opinions piece preaching moderation
when everything else seems to push to
excess? All I wanted to do is make draw
a parallel. I wanted to strike a blow for
the middleroad
for TV on a Thursday
night.

But isn't it asking a littlemuch of even
the most open-minded of readers to take
advice from someone who, by his own
admission, recently fell into a sewer?

to Object to LBGA Sidewalk
Chalkings Without Objecting to the LBGA
By Chuck Stevens

There comes a time in every writer's
career when he or she is faced with a
moral dilemma of sorts, often in the following form: by addressing an issue, or
group, or situation, said writer draws
attention to whateverit is, whether or not
he or she wishes to. This is a particular
problem in the case of individuals or
groups who invade the political or cultural scene primarily to be noticed: does
one take them on in print and risk implicitly legitimizing them?
A variant on this problem currently
confronts your columnist as he reads
Becca Hover's letter in the September 22
issue of the Phoenix. Ms. Hover objects
therein to an opinion by Jen Philpott a
weekearlieTthathad voiceddoubts about
the utility of LBGA sidewalk chalkings,
claiming that "the chalkings were not
intended to be shocking or confrontational" and asserting one could only be
shocked if "one is offended by the very
conceptofhomo and bisexuality." It isn't,
precisely, that drawing any more attention to the LBGA is a problem, but it is
difficult to discuss the issue at hand—substantively—without committing the
very evil that precipitated the crisis. Specifically: to address why the chalkings
were offensive, it will shortly be necessary for your columnist to bring up .topics
unsuitable for polite conversation—topics which many object to having thrown
in their collective face.
Misgivings stated, disclaimers made,
let us hold our noses and commence. Ms.
Philpott's opinion was not specifically
addressing the latest round of sidewalk
chalk—she questioned "the means of
presenting an activist message via anonymous sidewalk chalk written in themiddle
of the night," a fairly broad description of
this, urn, time-honoredritual. Rather, she
wondered "why activism on this campus
tends to use shock value". Ms. Hover—a first-year student—may not be aware
of the recent history of LBGA sidewalk
chalk; Ms. Philpott, more discreet than
your columnist, did not elaborate on past
instances of thelocal game ofLet's Show
Everyone How Many Dirty Words We
Know. To wit (no, your columnist did not
write these down, he's working from
memory; if he misquotes slightly, forgivehim): "Kiss my tw*t.""Swat women
lick c*nt." "Kiss my cl*t." "Have you
kissed a c*nt today?" There have been
references to genitalia and to sexual acts
that would make a construction worker
blush emblazoned boldly on the sidewalk, enough that, after at least one such
little spree, Physical Plant folks were
called in with buckets of water. Messages that require Swarthmore staff to
leave their work and go around cleaning
up the sidewalks go a touch beyond informative, your columnist ventures to
say.

Even in the latest round, there was

plenty of room for shock among the non-

homophobic. "Women on women" and
"men on men" come to mind, as does
"queers eat out here" and "bisexuality:
double your pleasure". Even messages
that make no references to sexual acts
can be offensive; when was the last time
"Smile if you're a fag" came up in your
casual conversations, Ms. Hover? How
does one make a non-confrontational
statement out of "Gay by nature, proud
by choice"? How does being unsettled by
these messages—by having to read about
someone's sexual activities if one dares
to look at the ground—equal "being offended by the very concept" of LBGA?
It should be noted, again, that Ms.
Philpott's predicament came as theresult
of leading a tour and having to explain
away sidewalk messages to a mother. If
the mother was concerned about
"graphic" chalkings, it seems safe to say
that neither she nor anyone else is particularly concerned about "queers live in
Mertz" or any other variant of the "weexist" theme. Having faith as I do in Ms.
Philpott's intelligence, I feel confident
that she, in her concerns about activism
at Swarthmore, was not referring to the
bestiality chalkings. But when messages
supposedly intended as "a welcoming
wish for awareness of Queer presence on
campus" end up disturbing a parent
enough that she sees it as intendedprimarily to shock, something is gravely
amiss—and it solves nothing to dismiss
the mother as homophobic and go one's
merry way.
Let us suppose, by way of analogy,
that there is a minority ethnic group in
our midst, one whose customs seem odd
and eccentric to the outside observer. If
said group decided it wanted to be part of
the Swarthmore community, would it go
around asserting, as loudly as possible
and in as harsh language as possible,
exactly what it does that makes it so
different? Or would it stress the commonalities between itself and the rest of
the college, the ways in which members
of the group are like everyone else and
deserve to be treated in the same way?
Deliberately disseminating messages that
offend a good portion of the community
merely to let said community know that
one exists seems similar to screaming
obscenities at someone rather than introducing oneself, just to ensure that one
will be remembered; such an approach
may make an impression, but not necessarily a favorable one.

Ms. Hover descends into the realm of
crummy analogies in dismissing Ms.
Philpott's complaint that offensive
chalkings make for ineffective discourse:
"That is exactly what every oppressed
minority has been accused of when demanding rights and awareness of issues."
Oh—so, since the accusation has been
leveled at oppressed groups in the past,
its presence must mean that the group in
question is oppressed. Right. Further-

"rights" being demanded here that I can discern, unless
it's the right to have people talking about
their sexual practices a lot, nor are there
any "issues" at stake of which the explicitly sexual chalkings can make us aware.
They're not dirty words to make a useful
point, they're just, well, dirty words.
According to Ms. Hover, "Queer invisibility is a serious problem." Such an
assertion occasions some wonder: for
whom? Whom does it harm when homosexuals go a day, two days, a week, a
month without asserting their sexual orientation to all and sundry? Presumably,
they still know who they are, as do their
friends and significant others. And as
long as there is an LBGA, gay/lesbian/
bisexual students will know each other
and have a support network of sorts.
When discussion of Queer issues and
contact with a group of Queer students is
readily available to any halfway with-it
student, how some gratuitous "visibility" strengthens the psychological (let
alone the "physical"; someone kindly
clue me in as to how anyone's physical
well-being is endangered when LBGA
activity is quiet) well-being of anyone is
lost on me.
Ms. Hover blithely informs us that
more, there are no

"there are people on this campus who are
not aware that there are real Queers in the
world," a statement that cries for substantiation.Who are these people?Where
have they been living? Had they been

assuming that there were real gays in
other worlds, but not here? More to the
point, even accepting the remarkably
dubious premise that these people exist
and live at Swarthmore, what did the
sidewalk messages accomplish?
Queers Live in Parrish. Women On
Women. Fags Have Class in Papazian.
Why, there must be an active Queer community on campus that wishes to send me
a welcoming message." More likely, this
remarkably ignorant person became
aware that there were students on campus that were upset about something and
needed to make that very clear; that such
a person wouldbecome any more accepting of LBGA folk is not so clear.
Yourcolumnistreiteratesfor therecord
that we-exist messages are all very well,
though they do rather resemble an ex-

tended exercise of carrying coals to
Newcastle. But—and dismiss his column as a homophobic rant if you like—there seems no useful purpose behind
explicitly sexual messages on sidewalks

that other approaches

to

reminding or

informing the community of the LBGA
presence (pink triangles, "LBGA Meeting At 10 On Thursdays" signs, etc.)

would not accomplish with less hostility.
No one is proposing silencing—although
your columnist will not be seen standing
in the way of the bucket team —but worries like Ms. Philpott's should encourage
the LBGA folks to reconsider their approach to heightening visibility.

Lenny Kravitz Can't Leave Behind
the 70's in Latest Album, Circus
By Dan Sachar

I've always felt that musicof the 1970s
is much unappreciated and underrated.
Lenny Kravitz, who has just released his
fourth LP, Circus (Virgin), evidently
agrees. While I have been a fan of such
seventies superstars as the Village People
and KC and the Sunshine Band, Lenny
went more for Led Zeppelin, Jimi
Hendrix, the DoobieBrothers and Barry
White. These influences were clear in his
past three albums, and little changes in
Circus. Lacking any semblance of originality (never Lenny's strongpoint), this
album still is entertaining enough to rank
among his previous work an honor of
distinct, yet debatable worth.
Much like his last album, Are You
Gonna Go My Way, Circus opens with a
Hendrix-like and very entertainingrocker
entitled "Rock and Roll is Dead," a blatant attack on the music industry, which
features a great guitar riff for all you airguitarists out there. The only problem
with opening the album with this fastpaced rock song is that it sets a standard
to which other songs on the album fail to
live up. Nevertheless, it is the hard rock
songs on the album which fare best, for
Lenny tends to be a bit too much when he
slows things down. Songs such as 'Tunnel Vision," "Beyond the 7th Sky," and
"Thinlce," therefore, rank with the opener
as entertaining rock songs, often funkier
than hard. 'Thin Ice," in particular, offers a great "wah-wah" guitar sound to
fans of the theme song from "Shaft."
When the pace slackens, however,
things go downhill. "Can't Get You Off
My Mind," is a very undistinctcheeseball
love song which includes such thrilling
lyrics as, "I don't wanna lose you baby
and I don't wanna be alone." C'mon,
Lenny. "Don't Go and Put a Bullet in
Your Head," a song I'mtrying hard not to
associate with KurtCobain, actually uses
a beat box instead of drums and just
sounds pretty bad. It's not until the final
two songs, "In My Life Today," and

"The Resurrection," does Lenny find a
balance between cheese and musicianship
and actually comes up with a couple

more good songs.
Lenny Kravitz's affinity for the past is
such that he actually used recording
equipment from the sixties torecord Circus. The effects of this manuever are
more in symbolism than in actualresults.
The album is a bit disappointing, because
I felt Lenny was actually maturing with
his last album, and this new one ranks

with his earlier work. Mama Said.
It's really not a terrible album, it's just
unremarkable. There are definately entertaining moments, but this 70's rehash
thing is starting to get a bit old.
One final note for those of you who
buy albums for reasons other than music:
the CD booklet has some pretty interesting pictures of Lenny in various poses,
none of which include much in the way of
clothing. I guess he'sreally proud of that
nipple ring and all those tattoos.

saying the film didn't have a great effect

to going into a comic store, impressing

Carl:Oddly enough, both our opinions
this weekend are pretty similar. Bullets
Over Broadway asks the question: "At
what price, art?" Set in the 19205, the
film also stars John Cusack, Jack Warden, Jennifer Tilly, Rob Reiner, MaryLouise Parker and Tracey Ullman. It is
about a struggling writer, David Shane
(Cusack), who finally gets his big break
with a play he has written. The one catch
is that mob boss Nick Valenti (Joe
Viterelli) is funding the play and wants
his girlfriend Olive Neal (Tilley) to have
a starring role. Shane puts up with this
and more compromises as his play is
changed; he gets taken in by the charms
of Broadway, and he neglects his girlfriend Ellen (Parker). Most of the people
I spoke too thought the film was really

away. So, if you're awake Saturday

Kate: In summary, Carl and I both

it is entertaining, if only to see theposter

September 29,1995

SPORTS
Women's
Soccer
By John Simon

This past week, the Swat Women's
Soccer team hoped to improve on its 1-61 record in games against league rivals
Gettysburg and F&M, but they unfortunately lost both games. So now the
Garnet women stand at 1-8-1 overall and
0-2 in the Centennial Conference, and
there are moTe questions than answers.
The league opener on Saturday against
perennial power Gettysburg was a good
test for the young Garnet team. Despite
this being a down year for the Bullets,
they still had more than enough firepower to dispose of the Swat women 5-0.
In the first half, the Garnetkept the game
close and only trailed 1-0 at the half, but
in the secondhalf Gettysburg pulled away
to an easy victory.
As inprevious games a lack of offense
hurt the Garnet; the team has scored only
3 goals in its 9 games. This year the team
has to discover a way to score or else they
simply won't be able to win games.
On Wednesday at Clothier field, the
Garnet took on F&M, who in the meantime had defeated Gettysburg 1-0. The
Garnet knew they had their work cut out
for them. They fell behind early, and
trailed 4-1 at the half. The Garnet's sole
goal was scored on a penalty kick by
Amy Markey '99, but that was all the
offense that they could manage, as F&M
rolled home with a 6-1 victory.
Again, the Garnet suffered offensive
woes as they had a difficult time putting
the ball in the net despite repeated
chances. However, the team showed much
more promise in this game than in the
previous one against Gettysburg, generating far more worthwhile attacks and
generally playing better soccer.
The team hopes to turn it around on
Saturday at Western Maryland, and on
Wednesday at home against Cabrini.
With only nine games remaining, one
can consider this a make-it-or-break-it
week for the Garnet. If they can win both
of their games, they can generate some
momentum for the rest of the season. If
they lose, they may end up simply playing out the string in October, counting
down the days until the season ends.
Hopefully the former will occur rather
than the latter.

Tennis Teams Prepare For Rolex Tournaments

On Wednesday, the Garnet women
ended a six match losing streak with a
convincing three game victory, 15-4,154,15-7, over Neumann College. Although
Neumann, traditionally a school with
weaker athletic teams, was a non-conference opponent, the victory seems to have
awakened the Garnet. On Wednesday
night, they quickly silenced a late-arriving Farleigh-Dickinson team in another
three game match, 15-10, 15-8, 16-14.

'9B played excellent games against
Farleigh-Dickinson. Barton showed her
versatility and made several fine digs in
addition to a number of kills. The team's
serving showed flashes of the brilliance
that the team had reached last season.
Barton and Deena Bahri '9B aced
Farleigh-Dickinson numerous times.
Rosenbaum's serve led a Garnet run of
five straight points that broke a 10-10
deadlock in the second game and gave
them a commanding 2 game lead.
In the Neumann match, Vanya
Tepavcevic '97 played well at setter after
taking over for starter Jordan Hay '9B
midway through the second game.
In addition, two of the taller members
of the team, Rebecca Roth '97 and Hillary
Scheipe '9B, got to play front line in their
first significant playing time of the season. The substitutes were up to the task
and handily defeated Neumann 15-7 in
the third game.
The wins come on the heels of a disappointing weekend at Bryn MawrCollege
where the Garnet were swept in three
games by both the hosts and Gettysburg
College. The Garnet played better against
Gettysburg, the stronger team, and when
they rallied, the teams were evenly
matched. Their inability to force long
rallies, however, hurt them in the end.
While the team is likely out of the
conference playoff picture, there is still
much that can be gained from the season.

The men's tennis team continues to
impress their opposition and themselves
as they played well against Division I and
Division II opponents this past weekend
at Swarthmore.
Seven teams participated, including
strong teams such as University ofPennsylvania, Bloomsburg University, and
Catholic University. The individual tournament is a warm-up for thebiggest event
of the fall, the Rolex Tournament, which
will be held here this weekend.
In the warm-up event, there were
four flights, with two members of each
team competing in each flight. Because
fall tennis does not allow for team competition, this tournament was an individual affair.
Sophomore Ed Ernst played a great
series in the A flight, advancing all the
way to the semi-finals before finally being knocked out.
Senior Jerry Camas, playing in the D
flight, never lost a match-while winning
his flight. This feat has not been accomplished by a Swarthmore student in years.
Assistant Coach Chris Pearson, a 1995
graduate, commented after the match,
"The strong individual accomplishments
are a result of the hard work that the team
has been going through."
This weekend, the Rolex Tournament will be the talkof the team. Pearson
added, "A Swarthmore student has won
the entire region the last two years. We
are definitely looking for the same this
year."
Indeed, Pearson knows this tourna-

Men's

Rugby
By Tony Sturm
The Evil Buzzards were taught some
fundamental lessons on Saturday by a
Princeton team that ran theiroffense better than any other team that Swarthmore's
men's rugby team is likely to meet this
season. The Princeton Tigers used a potent post and clear offense to demolish
the Buzzards 52-7 on a muddy DuPont
Field.

Swat was working
hard, but Princeton
was just too good
for them to get
anything going.
S warthmore went into the gameknowing that Princeton would be one of the
toughest teams that they would meet all
season,

but the Buzzards did

not

ap-

proach this match without hope: they

were clinging to the memory of having
shocked Princeton last spring with a 9-6

victory.
The game started out on a good note
for Swarthmore when they scored less
than five minutes into the match. Dan
Barrick '9B sprinted after a quick punt by
Chez Teplin '96 off of a back line play,
and beat the entire Princeton team to the
ball, falling on it in the try zone for an
early score. Teplin's converson gave the
Buzzards a 7-0 lead and a lot of confidence.

Princeton was just

too

tough for

Swarthmore, however, and they used their
size and speed to post and clear the ball

up and down the field almost at will.
They scored four times before the half to
make it 24-7, and added four more tries in
the second half to finish out the scoring.
A spectator commented midway
through the game, "Swat was working
hard, but Princeton was just too good for
them to get anything going."
The offense employed by Princeton
was very dominant. As soon as a player
with the ball was likely to be tackled, he
would post into the Swarthmore defender
and place the ball behind him. There
were almost always two or three teammates ready to pick up the ball and ruck
or maul it down the field.Theb-side team
suffered a similar fate, getting shut out
32-0 by the same sort of tough, Princeton
offense.
Swarthmore can't dwell on this defeat,
because they play Kutztown University
tomorrow at DuPont field. Kutztown is
another team which has been a perennial
power, and the Buzzards will have their
work cut out for them again this week as
they challenge a long-time rival.

skillful, well prepared, and have good
players," he said. The match-up in the
Championship game was an even and
exciting one.
Swat won the gameand the title by a
score of 2-1. Duffy scored both goals for
the Garnet. The low score against the
nationally ranked squad from Wellesley
is, in this case, a testament to the outstanding play of Swarthmore's defense.
Wilcox performed marvelously, making
about eight superb saves in a span of as
many minutes. Her performance is especially remarkable in light of the fact that
this is her first season as goalie at
Swarthmore. Jennifer Hagan '99, the
coach added, played the best game of her
season as sweeper, making some key
saves of her own. Swat's strategy in the
last game was to let Wellesley reveal
their game plan. Once they did so, the
Garnet was able to counter them offensively, and come out victorious.
The team's victory was a compilation
of thehard work and dedication ofall its
players. Duffy played "brilliantly in the
final," according to her coach. He said
that there was no question that she deserved the MVP award, and the vote was
unanimously in her favor. "Samantha
Peltz '97 played the best game of her
Swarthmore career in the Finals of the
tournament," said the coach. "Donna
Griffinworked tirelessly. Lynne Steuerle
'99 and Erin Flather '97, two strong wing
half-backs, are both really bright players
and outwit their opponents."
The All Tournament Team is selected
by thecoaches prior to the final game. No
more than three players from one team
may be chosen so that as many schools as
possible be represented. CoachKentwell
is not a fan of this policy and feels that
sometimes more than three players from
a team deserve to be honored if they play
very well. He said that had the All Tournament Team been chosen after the Finals, Wilcox definitely wouldhave made

game against Gettysburg will be a pivotal one. The success of this year's team

Hockey Player Stands Out
By Lia Ernst
Danielle Duffy '9B has been having
one heck of a field hockey season. Leading the team in goals with 10, she has
been unstoppable on attack. Danielle also
led the team in scoring for the Seven
Sisters tournament this past weekend,
helping the team to win theConstance M.
Appleby Cup for the second year running
withher six goals in the three games. Her
exemplary play was recognized by the
coaches at the tournament when she was
named the tournament MVP.
Danielle's already excellent play has
improved markedly since last season.
Her leadership and confidence in moving
the ball have soared, and her amazing
stickwork has left many a dusted defender standing bewildered in her wake.
This change is largely due to her experience this summer playing on turf.
Working under severe time constraints, however, I was unable to do
actual interviews, so I have justmade up
quotes as I saw fit. Goalkeeper Kelly
Wilcox'97: "Well, she certainly wouldn't
be scoring that many on me, that's for

"No comment." The feelings of the team
as a whole, however, were best summed
up by the eloquent words of defender
Michelle Walsh "98: "WhoaMistah, that

Lane, Cuello Lead Garnet to
Three Game Winning Streak
By Dan Malkoun

This week, theGarnetTide men's soccer team racked up two more wins to
improve their record to 6-3 overall, and
1-1 in the Centennial Conference. Dave
Lane '97 and Len Cuello '96 put their
marks on the highlights combining for
six goals over the two game span, and
pushing thetide to a perfect record for the
week.

The victory over Western Maryland
put the Garnet back at .500 for the season
in the conference. This Saturday, the
men in garnet are at home to do battle
with Dickinson.

The first of the two victories came
when Swarthmore rebounded from the
disappointing Conference opening loss
to Johns Hopkins University with convincing wins over Division II leader,
Millersville University, and Centennial
foe. Western Maryland College.
Senior forwaid Cuello of Easton, Connecticut had two goals in the win over the
Maraudersand assisted on two more goals
in the win over the GreenTerror ofWestern Maryland two days later.
The Millersville game went into overtime, and as darkness swamped Clothier
field, so did Cuello who tookcontrol and
scored two times to put the game away
for Swat
In the next game against rival. Western Maryland, Lane equaled a Conference single-game record for goals and
points with a four-goal performance in
the Garnet's 4-2 win. Lane tied the
marks of four goals and eight points held
by Washington College's Jon Kostyal,
and Haverford's Frank Adamson, set in

1993 and 1994,respectively. Along with
all the hoopla, Lane garnered "Player of
the Week" honors in the CentennialConference. Junior goalkeeper Will Dulaney

the same game.

By Jennifer Philpott

fitness to a higher level than in past
seasons. Swarthmore defeated Rutgers

captains Kelly Shannon and Rebecca Cole,
and it was through their combined efforts
that the team played with such intensity
after a rather shaky start
In the first few minutes of the first half,
Swarthmore looked rough around the
edges, and Rutgers back line was able to
complete a few impressive back line
plays. After the initial shock wore off,
though. Swat got down to business and
the forward pack, led by Shannon, dominated every scrum, thus wearing Rutgers
into the ground. Senior prop, Margaret
Cohen said, "We drove them back in
many scrums. We were stronger than
they were." Swat's back line looked confused on their first few lines, but they,
too, pulled their act together and recovered before the first half had ended.
Swarthmore scored first off of a penalty kick by full-back, Alii Pierce '97,
that was set up late in the first half by the
forward pack. The fact that the team
chose to kick for points rather than going
for a try is evidence that they lacked
confidence in their ability to run the ball
in at that point. Cohen said, "The game
started off slowly, but the intensitypicked
up after Allie's kick and we rode that
momentum through the end of the game."
Rutgers didn'tlose any steam, though,
and came right back after Pierce's kick
marching the ball down the field.
Swarthmore was on the defensive for the
last several minutes of the first half and
Rutgers fin ally scored offof a scrum-half
sneak into the try zone. They did not

successfully make their conversion.
The tide turned in Swarthmore's favor
from the beginning of the second half
until 35 minutes later when the referee
blew his whistle and Swat celebrated
their victory. Swat's superior stamina

and intensity were evident in every scrum
as Swat drove Rutgers all over the place.
Swarthmore also had an overload in almost every ruck because Rutgers simply
could not get there in time.
The team scored their first try when
Shannon made an exciting, heads-upplay
in the try zone, grabbing a lose ball and
touching it down. Pierce made the conversion and the score became 10-s.Given
the dominance of Swat's forwards, it is
no surprise that Andrea Johnson '9B
scored another try soon after Shannon's
offof a penalty play that was neatly setup
by scrum half, Jen Philpott '97, and perfectly completed by the forward pack.
Johnson had an outstanding game with
several impressive tackles in the midfield and one amazing tackle after
Swarthmore kicked off in the second
half. In fact, severalRutgers players were
seen throwing themselves to the ground
rather than being tumbled by the powerful Johnson.
Rutgers did add five more points to
their score when they scored off a ridiculous series of penalty plays in which
Swarthmore made the tactical error of
neglecting to retreat when they should
have. It was the kind of error that is made
in the first game of a season but never
again. Swarthmore didn't let down for a

The only Teal disappointments of the

and was unable to return. Andrea Bamett

a brilliant game at fly half. Cole will be
able to play in next week's divisional
game against Millersville University,
though. Senior Alicia Wilson, who returned to rugby after a long hiatus, had
been playing superbly in the position of
hooker, but was brought up short by a
nasty gash to her forehead that required
five stitches in Saturday's game. The
team is hoping to have her playing again
in a week or so.
A lot of mistakes were made in
Saturday's game, but the team has had a
full week to correct those errors and they

three Divisional games; if they win all
three, they automatically qualify for the

Tide Falls to 0-2 in Centennial
By Frank Amar

After one uneventful drive for both
Gettysburg got the ball back, but
Erik Johnson '9B (9 tackles) intercepted
a pass that put the Garnet Tide in great
field position. However, another missed
field goal by Minero kept the score 8-0.
With about two minutes left in the first
half, the ball changed hands three times
within 20 seconds: Straub interception,
Gettysburg fumble, Straub interception.
After the second interception, Gettysburg
capitalized by driving 44 yards and scoring, and the two teams went into the
locker room with S warthmore leading 86 after a failed two point conversion.
In what is rapidly becoming a lead
pipe cinch, Gettysburg opened the second half with a scoring drive that lasted
12 plays and consumed 60 yards, all of
them on the ground. The rest of the third
quarter was uneventful, with both teams
missing field goals. With 10:52remaining in the game, the Garnet Tide began
their march to the end zone. Starting
from their own 32 and going without a
huddle, the GarnetTide pounded the ball
right at the Bullet defense, mixing in a
few passes along the way. With 5:27 left
in the game, Straub (21-40 268 yards, 2
TD's, 2 Interceptions) hit Nick Milligan
'96, who smashed his way across the
goalline for the 13 yard touchdown. The
Minero kick was good and the Tide was
in the lead 15-12.
On the second play of the following
drive, fate dealt the GarnetTide a losing
hand. Gettysburg fumbled and the Garnet Tide defense pounced all over it.The
momentum was clearly on the Tide's
side, but a defensive face-masking penalty gave the ballback to theBullets.This
sudden twist of fate took the air right out
of the defense's sails as theBullets continued their drive, which culminatedwith
a Shannon Forsythe 12 yard touchdown
run. Although the Tide got the ball back

will all answer the same:
commit stupid penalties, turn the ball
over, fail to score from inside the red
zone and fail to put an opponent away
when he's on the ropes.The Garnet Tide
followed that recipe last Saturday afternoon, letting what should have been conference win #1 slip away like the sand in
the hour glass in the opening credits of
"Days ofOur Lives," as they dropped a
frustrating 19-15 decision to Gettysburg.
On paper, this matchup looked like
smash mouth football at its best.
Gettysburg and S warthmore were ranked
2nd and 3rd inrushing offense last year,
respectively, but the GarnetTide took the
opportunity to establish its passing game
on the opening drive. Quarterback Pat
Straub '97 came out firing, completing
four of his first five passes, including a
41-yard scoring strike to Sam Paschel
'96(6catches,96yards). Straub hitbrother
Jason '96 for the two-point conversion
and the score stood at 8-0.
The restofthe first half, however, was
not as pretty. Both teams put on a display
on how to play bad football. After the
kickoff, Gettysburg's Wing T offense
went to work. The Bullets moved theball
into GarnetTide territory, but theiropening drive stalled at the 25 yard line. The
Gettysburg field goal unit came out, but
Wayne Rumsey misfired and the score
remained 8-0.
The Tide's next drive was sabotaged
by penalties, and they were forced to
punt. The Gettysburg returner could not
handle the kick and the Garnet Tide recovered in Bullet territory. Though they
would get as close as the three yard line,
the offensehad to settle for a 33 yard field
goal attempt by Matt Minero '96 that

with just under two minutes to play, they
were not able to successfully move the
ball, thus ending hopes of a dramatic
comeback.
This week, the Garnet Tide travels to
Collegeville, PA to take on the Ursinus
Bears. The Garnet Tide will be looking to
win at Patterson Field for the first time
since 1983. Additionally, the team will
look to avenge a 57-16 loss the last time
they traveled to Ursinus.

missing the first four games with an injury. Lane has exploded for 7 goals and
3 assists. According to teammate ChrisMarin '96,"Dave's return has definetely

importance of every goal is magnified.His presence has helped the attack, and
in turn, all aspects of our game are starting to click".

Andrea Johnson *9B played her first season of rugby in the fall of 1994. Johnson
learned the complex game quickly and became a key player in her first season. The
team was very sad to see her run track in the spring. This fall, though, Johnson is
playing rugby again and has assumed the forward position of eight with ease and skill.
She had an amazing game on Saturday, scoring her first A side try and tackling Rutgers
players left and right. In one notable tackle after a kick-off, she hit one Rutgers rugger
so hard that the ball flew from her hands. Johnson is a favorite on the rugby field
because ofher athletic ability and intense work ethic, and off thefield because of her
supportive and willing attitude.
