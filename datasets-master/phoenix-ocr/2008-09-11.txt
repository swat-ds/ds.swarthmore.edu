McCabe unveils lockers to combat theft
BY AMANDA KLAUSE

aklausel@swarthmore.edu

Security in McCabe has become much
tighter this year. During the month of
June sixty lockers were installed in the
library on the lower level and second and

third floors.
The twenty lockers on the lower level
are reserved for senior thesis students,
but all other students can check out keys
for the lockers on the second and third
floor at the circulation desk for no fee.
Students are allowed to leave their
belongings in the library during library
hours. However, items that are left in the
lockers overnight will be removed from
the lockers and placed on the Student
Belongings shelf.
Previously, students had only been
able to store personal belongings on specially designated open shelves.
Associate Vice President of Facilities
Management Stu Hain agreed that the
installation was part of a general effort to
improve campus security.

"The lockers were installed to give
students the option of leaving their
belongings in a secure place if they wanted to leave the library or use another
part of the library unencumbered," Hain
said.
In recent years, as more people began
to bring personal laptops to the library,
concerns about theft have grown.
Lending and Access Services Supervisor
Alison Masterpasqua said she hopes that
the lockers will reduce the number of
thefts that occur at the library.
According to Masterpasqua, McCabe
installed the lockers "because we noticed
an increase in theft of personal belongings in the past couple of years."
"The open nature of our previous storage system led to occasional thefts,"
Masterpasqua said.
Students have already begun to recognize the benefits of the lockers.
According to Masterpasqua, 23 students

used the lockers within the first four
days of classes. She added that so far, no
thefts from lockers have been reported.
Melanie Spaulding 'O9, who works at
the circulation desk at the library,
admits that although the lockers aren't
very popular yet, she has checked out
keys to several students.
"During a regular shift, which is
about two hours, I see two or three students coming to check out a key,"
Spaulding said.
Students, even those who don't live off
campus, seem pleased with the new
arrangement.

Bradley Fong 'lO finds the lockers convenient. "I don't personally use the lockers much because I live in Wharton. I
can see how they might be really useful
for someone who lives in ML. But I also
think the lockers are good because if you
have to get up to get a drink you can put
your laptop in one. It's safer," Fong said.
However, some students think that
the lockers are redundant. Sarah Kroll
'll, who is living off campus for a second
year, thinks the campus has better
options.

"The lockers in McCabe are really
more for leaving your stuff during a
McCabe study break than as on-campus
storage. I had a Parrish locker last year,
which was great for storing my laptop on
the days I had my radio show in the
morning. I lived in ML, so when I wanted
to be on campus all day, I sometimes left
textbooks in my locker so I could pick
them up after class to study," Kroll said.
Kroll said students who live off campus and rely heavily on the Parrish lockers may not feel compelled to transfer
their belongings to the new storage area
in McCabe.
"As far as I know, there are still
Parrish lockers for off-campus students
this semester, so I don't really see the
point in using a McCabe locker when you
can have a 24/7 personal locker in
Parrish," Kroll said.

Women’s Resource Center transitions into dry space
BY ASHIA TROIANO

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

Starting this school year, the Women's Resource
Center has joined the ranks of the Black Cultural Center,
the Intercultural Center, and Upper Tarble in becoming a
dry campus space.
Originally, the WRC was a space for both weekend
parties and educational resources, but after the damage
that often resulted from parties involving alcohol, the
members of the WRC agreed that it was time to take more
direct action.
"It is necessary to preserve the physical space for the
benefit of the women who use it," Dina Kopansky 11, a
WRC board member, said.
Discussion about making the WRC a dry space first
emerged last year during the WRC Board meetings, but a
final decision was only made this year.
The WRC board wanted to secure the building from
damage, especially after the WRC was renovated during
the summer, including getting the walls repainted and
new furniture moved in. The board also plans to get new
materials for the center, such as books, movies and
games.

There was also concern that the purpose of the center
to provide a safe and educational space for women
was getting lost between the lines. "We felt as if the space
was being associated more with drinking parties than

with a resource center for women. We also couldn't leave

THE PHOENIX

in the WRC space, such as books and other
visual resources, because we were afraid that these parties would hurt the resources," Kristin Caspar 'O9, board
member, said.
Of the campus's reaction to the WRC's new status,
Amanda Morrison 11, another member of the board,
said, "People may be disappointed at the limited number
of wet spaces, but I do not expect a strong reaction." And
thus far, the news has generated both support and indifference. For those who do not spend the bulk of their
time at the WRC, the decision does not have much of an
any resources

impact.

But for others, the decision sparked conversation.
"I think it's very important that a space designated

for women is used by women as women want it," Cecilia
Marquez 'll said. "It's a resource center and, it's unacceptable for outside groups to trash women's space. What
does that mean for the space? I wouldn't go to Paces for a
deep conversation because of what the space represents."
The WRC has been home to a number of "wet" events,
including Sager, one of Swarthmore's most popular campus-wide events.

Known for the large crowd it draws, many have questioned how the event will be affected given that the WRC
is no longer an option as a space. "With Sager, people
tend to let loose a little bit more, so I can understand the
WRC's concerns," Erika Slaymaker 11, a former WRC
board member and current member of the Sager
Planning Committee, said. "But the Sager Committee is

September

IX 2008

flexible in planning the event, and will find a supplemental space if needed."
The Latin Lounge, formed last year by an 'OB graduate
with the help of other students, also held its weekly
"wet" events at the WRC. "We made a substantial investment in alcohol because we served mixed drinks like
mojitos and sangria," Nick Pascuzzi 'll said. "The WRC
was known less for its party scene than Paces and Olde
Club. It was a chill environment, and the space really
worked out for our purposes." However, it is unclear as
to whether the Latin Lounge will be continued this year,
which leaves one less group to compete for the remaining
"wet" spaces.
Similar to how the board did not want the presence of
alcohol to cloud the goals of the center, they do not want
the absence of alcohol to do the same. With the start of a
new school year, the WRC has a new vision, and according to Kopansky, that includes "revamping our image,
redefining what we do and focusing on women's community building."
Her hope is that the WRC will break away from the
image of it catering to certain groups of women, co-sponsor events with other groups, engage in dialogue with the
IC and BCC communities, and become a center that is
used much more frequently than it is now. "In my conception of what the WRC should be, I hope that we
keep an open Board that is receptive to all ideas from
women on this campus
and have the flexibility to
evolve to the needs of Swarthmore women."

Public magnet school for the arts opens
After four years of planning, Music Professor John Alston's school enrolls 200 students for its first year

Courtesy of Jeff Lott, College Communications Office

The Chester Children's Chorus, seen here rehearsing, provided the inspiration for John Alston to create the Chester-Upland School of the Arts.

BY ARIEL MARTINO

amartinl@swarthmore.edu

This past week, the Chester Upland
School of the Arts opened in the Parry
Building, which formerly housed Chester
High School. The public magnet school is
a result of the efforts of Dr. John Alston, a
Swarthmore music professor and director
of the Chester Children's Chorus.
The school will combine rigorous academic work with music, dance and visual
art classes. Currently, the school offers
instruction for two hundred students ages
three through eight. Alston hopes to
expand the number of students by continuing the school through eighth grade and
expanding the size of each grade. In order
to gain admission to CUSA, interested parents attended two meetings and entered
their children in a lottery.
"There is a huge community interest
and it's possible to expand class sizes. We
could probably support three or four threeyear-old classes and four four-year old
classes if we had the money," Alston said.

CUSA is the culmination of four years
of workfor John Alston, but the seed of the
idea for a public magnet school was planted nearly fourteen years ago when Alston
was a new professor at Swarthmore. He
hoped to recreate his positive experience
with the Newark Boys' Choir with children in Chester. "Growing up in a poor
city, in a single parent household, why
wouldn't I want to recreate that [experience]? It was the best experience of my
life." Alston said.
The Chester Children's Chorus began
in 1994 with seven boys. Since that time, it
has expanded to include 95 boys and girls
from the Chester-Upland School District.
The students are chosen by audition while
in second grade and receive a full scholarship through high school upon selection.

The summer program has also evolved to

include instruction in math and science as
well as intense musical training.
Sarah Posey 'O4 provided the impetus
needed to move the Chester Children's
Choir in a new direction. Posey, who had
been very involved with the Chester
Children's Chorus throughout her
Swarthmore career, completed her senior
thesis on progressive education. Alston
credits her with providing the information
he needed about education to get the ball
rolling on the expansion of Chester
Children's Choir. "She was the most profound influence and change in the Chester
Children's Choir," Alston said.
After Posey's influence, Alston began to
gain a clearer picture of how a school
might integrate arts and academics to promote a more positive learning experience.
"Children need hundreds of thousands of
positive experiences to grow into healthy
adults. A school can give them thousands
of positive experience, but a school can't
do it all. We do our part, maybe a little
more," Alston said.
However, Alston lacked the experience
in teaching and administration that was
necessary to take on such an ambitious
project. "I didn't know how to teach, I
went to professional school, not teaching
school. My assumption, which was a little
narcissistic, was that if music worked for
me, it would work for everyone."
Four years ago planning began for the
new Chester-Upland School of the Arts
through the Chester Fund for Education
and the Arts. The Chester Fund is a nonprofit corporation that supports the smaller class sizes, the commitment to the arts,
and the free after-school program that is
available to children in second grade and

above.
Maurice
President

Eldridge
for

Class and Community
September

Relations, is the chair of the Chester Fund
and has been involved in the CUSA since
its beginnings. "I absolutely believe in the
work John wanted to do. I've always been
an educator and I believe that arts are an
important part of education," Eldridge
said. Eldridge also brought ten years of
experience as the head of an arts school to
the project.
Currently the Chester Fund funds only
the Chester-Upland School of the Arts.
However, depending on donations, it could
also support future educational or artistic
endeavors in Chester. When asked about
any future plans for a high school, Alston
said, "I'm dreaming about it."
Money is a concern for the fledgling
school. It takes about $40,000 per year to

support each student, including instruction, facilities, supplies, transportation
and meals.

The school relies heavily on donations
through the Chester Fund to keep the quality of instruction and facilities up to par.
Alston hopes to garner $1 million in donations for next year to support the expanding student body.
The school is public and the students do
not have to pay tuition. Instead, it is supported by the Chester-Upland School
District and under the jurisdiction of
Gregory E. Thornton, the superintendent
of the district and a veteran of the
Philadelphia School district. He has made
his commitment to the children of Chester
very clear with projects encouraging high
school students to go to college and
encouraging interested students to pursue
careers in health.
Alston acknowledged that the CUSA
project would have been impossible without Thornton's involvement but added
that the Chester Fund is also responsible
for keeping the quality of education high.
The high quality ofeducation is a direct

IX 2008

result of the resources available at the
Chester-Upland School of the Arts. There

is a dedicated teaching staff, which
includes Posey, a host of new computers
for technology classes, a professional
dance studio, an art studio, and a music
facility, which is equipped with xylophones and African drums.
The Chester Fund also makes it possible to offer an after-school program for the
current second-graders free of charge. The
program offers time to do homework,
extended music classes, and a snack time.
The after-school program will expand to
encompass all students in second grade
and older.
While the school is clearly the result of
a collaborative effort, Alston deserves
accolades for his dedication and commit-

ment to the project. "[Alston] is the vision-

ary He's a wonderful teacher. He's got
energy, charisma, a genuine love for the
kids, and he's determined to make them

succeed," Eldridge said.

Now that the school is in session, it
remains to be seen how CUSA will interact

with the Chester Children's Chorus.
They are each separate organizations,
and students in the Chester Children's
Chorus are too old to enroll in CUSA. But
it will be interesting to see if the
Swarthmore community will offer the
same support for CUSA as it does for CCC.
"Once [CUSA] feels [itself] established
and the growing pains and opening kinks
are ironed out, hopefully we'll begin to
form a stronger bond. It's possible to form
a link between the school and the education department. There are lots of ways
for Swarthmore students to share their talents," Eldridge said.

The school has been up and running for
about a week and has maintained perfect
attendance
a feat that is usually
unheard of in a public school.

Deer culling to occur during winter break
BY APOLLINE BERTY
abertyl@swarthmore.edu
During this week's Swarthmore Borough Council meeting, the council amended an existing firearms ordinance
that stood in the way of the college's proposal to regulate
the Crum Woods' deer population with sharpshooters. The
language of the amendment authorizes "the discharge of a
firearm for the purposes of animal control," clearing the
way for the anticipated culling of the deer this winter.
After careful study of the deer population's effect on the
ecological wellbeing of the Crum Woods, the college heeded
an external consultant's recommendation that sharpshooters be employed to regulate the number of deer. Last year,
the Crum Woods Stewardship Committee settled on the
sharpshooter method and has since lobbied the borough to
revise a local ordinance that could enable the use of sharpshooters on Swarthmore's campus. Now that the amend-

ment has been passed, the culling could take place as early

as winter break.
"For the college to use the method of culling that the
committee recommended requires that the borough amend
for a very specific purpose its prohibition of using firearms
in the town," Professor of Economics and member of the
borough council Philip Jefferson said prior to the council's
decision this week. The next stage in the process is to
request a permit from the Pennsylvania Game Commission
to conduct the hunt.
The College cannot apply directly for a permit, explained
Borough Council member Elisabeth Knapp. As a result, the
borough has worked with the College to pass an amendment
making an exception on the use of firearms and administratively apply for the permit on behalfof the College.
"We're very supportive of the Swarthmore College deer
cull. Swarthmore can't get their permit. It has to be
obtained by a municipality. We are ready, willing and anxious to get this done for Swarthmore College," Swarthmore
Mayor Eck Gerner said.

"The idea is to do it at a time when
the use of the woods by human
beings [is expected] to be quite low,
and one time to do that is in the
dead of winter, when [Swarthmore
students] won't be in there."

Professor of Economics
Philip Jefferson
Knapp stressed that the amendment only applies to
firearms used for the culling of deer. "It doesn't make an
exception to the existing firearms regulations throughout
the borough in any other situation, it just makes a one-time
exception for this deer culling. I think that it also might
leave open the possibility of Swarthmore College culling
deer at a subsequent time but all based on approval,"
Knapp said.
Permits granted by the Pennsylvania Game Commission
are only valid for a single event, so the borough would need
to apply for another permit on the college's behalf if a subsequent cull is deemed necessary. If all goes according to
plan, the culling should take place during winter break.
"The idea is to do it at a time when the use of the woods by
human beings [is expected] to be quite low, and one time to
do that is in the dead of winter, when [Swarthmore students] won't be in there," Jefferson said.
Following the deer culling, the deer meat will be donated to homeless shelters. "I think the deer is going to be
sliced and given to homeless shelters or different agencies
able to accept that type of food for people. It's not like it's
just going to be sent off," Gerner said.
Knapp explained that whenever the council considers an
amendment that would impact the community, the borough
advertises the initiative in The Swarthmorean to facilitate
public debate on the matter.
"We publicized it for public hearing and we haven't
received any negative feedback," Borough Council
President, Tom Heustis said.
Gail Babcock '65, an animal rights activist who currently resides in Oregon, learned of the decision to cull the deer

The college's plan to cull deer pushes forward, but a dissenting Quaker and animal rights activist questions the
morality of the college's decision to use sharpshooters rather than what she deems more humane methods.
through the Alumni Bulletin and has sent letters to the
Crum Woods Stewardship Committee in protest.
"The most central humanist choice and Quaker choice is
to choose nonviolence," Babcock said in a phone interview.
"This really struck to the heart to know that when I'm out
in the world fighting for animal rights, the place where I
developed my moralviews has made a choice that goes completely against that."
In a letter she drafted to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l, Babcock advocated "humane [and] effective
alternatives to killing." Other options besides sharp shooting considered by the stewardship committee included: taking no action, contraception, fencing, euthanasia, and
recreational hunting.
As for the decision to donate the deer meat, Babcock's
letter to Eldridge took issue with the proposed redistribution of deer meat for human consumption. "Donating the
deer after they have been killed to the poor is an unacceptable salve to conscience. Why not donate the hides to make
clothes as well? The poor can all dress like Daniel Boone,"
Babcock said. She then raised the issue of disease borne by

deer.

"My singular concern is that the decision to cull and kill
the Crum Woods deer has been dictated by expediency and
ignores as necessary context the core values that are a part
of Quakerism: coexistence and compassion to living creatures including the animals among us," Babcock said in an
e-mail.
In his response to Babcock, Eldridge said the decision of
the organized deer cull came only 'after careful study of the
September

IX 2008

woods, consideration of a wide range of deer population
management options, and extensive engagement with the
community." A public presentation of the deer overpopulation issue first occurred in 2004, and other public forums
followed in the springs of 2006 and 2007 and the winter of
2008. The College has also informed the local media of all
developments.

"The place where I developed my
moral views has made a choice that
goes completely against that."
Gail Babcock '65
"During the most recent forum," Eldridge said, "a consultant from Natural Resource Consultants Inc. discussed
at length and fielded questions about its recommendation
that a sharpshooter be hired to euthanize deer as the most
humane, effective and socially responsible method to protect and restore the diverse ecosystem of the Woods."
As to keeping with Swarthmore's Quaker heritage,
Eldridge said, "The CWSC has
determined that action
must be taken
and has recommended the path that we
believe will cause the least suffering for the deer in our
efforts to protect and restore the Crum Woods."

Fireside chat proves success
BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossal@swarthmore.edu

Friday evenings are usually a time to relax and unwind
after a hectic week ofclasses. But last Friday, over forty students opted instead to voice their ideas and questions concerning the current search for the college's next president.
stuSix members of the presidential search committee
dents Lauren Stokes 'O9 and Aaron Schwartz 'O9, Barbara
Mather '65, Dean Rafael Zapata, Biology Professor Elizabeth
Vallen, and Search Consultant Shelly Weiss hosted a fireside chat in the Kohlberg coffee bar. The discussion was
intended to illuminate the mechanisms of the search
process and gather student input concerning the qualities a
future president should possess.

"There is a remarkable consistency
in what people have said about
basic characteristics."
Barbara Mater '65
Presidential Search
Committee Member

What exactly is a search consultant? Weiss went on to
describe her role as "a professional individual who advises
the search process, and recruits candidates." Weiss is part of
a minority and female-owned search firm, Storbeck/
Pimentel & Associates, which exclusively advises non-profit organizations such as colleges and universities.
After this introduction the panelists opened the floor to
gather student input concerning the qualities they hope to
see in the future president. They posed questions ranging
from, "What are Swarthmore's strengths and weaknesses?"
to "Do we need to improve the quality of student life here?"
to "What specific characteristics would you like to see in the
future president?" As expected, the questions generated a
variety of responses, but some common threads ran
throughout the entire discussion.
Students spoke about the college's core characteristics:
diversity, generous financial aid, rigorous academics, and
strong student/faculty relationships. But while acknowledg-

ing Swarthmore's strength in these areas, they also noted
that it is equally important for the college to continue pushing boundaries and keep pace with its peer institutions.
Whatever its strengths are today, they won't be strengths
tomorrow if the college refuses to change.
The financial aid program could offer money for extra
expenses such as dorm essentials and train tickets. The academic program could introduce more activities outside the
classroom. The admissions office could work to create political and ideological diversity, students noted, among other
suggestions.

"I think it's important to [attend the fireside chat]
because it's so important to have student input, especially
for a presidential search, and it is in keeping with the small
college tradition," Sara Forster 11 said before the event.
Another attendee, Cecilia Marquez 'll, came to the event
with a specific mission in mind: to say that she wants to see
a woman of color become president.
To begin the session, Schwartz and Mather explained the
committee's work. The members are officially charged with
suggesting a candidate for the position of president to the
Board of Managers. Advertisements have already been
placed in a diverse range of prestigious publications including "The Chronicle of Higher Education" and "The
Economist," for the position of president. Several candidates
have already expressed their interest to the committee.
The committee's next task is to formalize a job description, eliminate candidates, and interview those remaining.
Once the committee suggests a candidate, the Board will
have the final say.
At the fireside chat, committee members expressed their
hope that the process will remain as transparent as possible,
with opportunities for student, staff, faculty, and administrative input at every juncture. Some candidates, however,
may request confidentiality ifthey have not already notified
their current employers that they are exploring opportunities elsewhere. Before turning the chat over to the students,
Weiss addressed one of the questions on everyone's mind:

"I think it's important to [attend the
fireside chat] because it's so important to have student input, especially
for a presidential search."
Sara Forster 'll
Also, many students agreed that the new president
should actively communicate with the students to better
understand their needs. His or her interaction with students
could include anything from fireside chats to teaching a
class every year.
"There is a remarkable consistency in what people have
said about basic characteristics," Mather said. Most of the
people she has spoken to, in conversation and in open events
with other members of the community, have said they want
a president who is a good listener and has the ability to

bring people together.

The committee urges those who were not present at the
fireside chat to share their thoughts online. Visit

Drag Troupe debuts,
bends social norms
BY ADAM BORTNER

abortnel@swarthmore.edu

Gender-bending and challenging social norms
take center stage this semester with the Drag
Troupe, an incipient performing arts group at the

college.

While drag as portrayed in movies or television

may be primarily associated with the queer community, Drag Troupe is open to all interested students including performers, choreographers and

techies.

Drag refers to the act of dressing in attire of the
opposite or other gender.
More than that, it can also be a political form of
expressing or questioning sexual and social identity. Dressing in drag is about "playing around
with gender, breaking out of the strict boxes of
societal gender norms," Erika Slaymaker 'll said.
"I think
Drag Troupe adds to the multifaceted, open and
diverse queer community on campus and sounds

like so much fun," she said.
Co-founders Anjali Jaiman 'lO and Logan
Tiberi-Warner 11 spontaneously came up with the
idea of putting on a drag show around the period
of final exams last spring.
"Personally Lexpect to have a show where we
simultaneously are able to have fun, that offers a
safe space for people who are interested to express
the issues they wish to explore regarding gender
and sexuality, and
challenged] the people who
are seeing the show in regards to gender and sexuality," Tiberi-Warner said. Hopefully, this initiative will help revive political performances on
campus, Jaiman said.
The group is currently working out the logistics of the show
coming up with a name, organizing a rehearsal schedule, generating ideas for
skits and
numbers and, of course, securing funding. The
members plan to meet weekly, building up to a
performance on campus sometime in mid to late
November.
"I hope that people will be interested from a
spectator's point of view and will just come to see
what we have to offer," Tiberi-Warner said.
One first-year student who is not planning to
participate, Lang Haynes 'l2, said that he is nevertheless "looking forward to the show." He finds
it amusing to see gender roles overturned since
society "puts so much importance on masculinity
and femininity."

One of the 28 campus
shuttles now runs on waste vegetable oil.
Jake Green, manager for campus
transportation, decided to convert a
campus shuttle that previously ran on
diesel fuel to an environmentally friendly alternative.
"This is one project that we're very
excited about," said Alma Allred,
Director of Commuter Services. "One of
our shuttles now runs on the waste vegetable oil—oil from restaurants."
Biodiesel was already used on campus when Green decided to make the
WVO conversion. "This system is slightly different than biodiesel. Our vehicles
run on a mixture that has 20 percent
biodiesel," he said.
"There is no processing procedure for
vegetable oil, but with biodiesel you

have byproducts and we didn't know
would do with them."
The WVO conversion recycles the
iused vegetable oil from restaurants and
eateries on campus, filters the oil and
iinjects it into the engine as a complete
substitute for diesel.
The WVO conversions overhaul the
ifuel tank system of diesel vehicles,

the average student's commute. It uses
about five gallons ofWVO per day.
Although the level of carbon pumped
into the air is about the same, the conversion severely reduces the amount of
deadly gases emitted by gasoline and
diesel fuel vehicles. The XJ does not have
any plans to convert another shuttle in
the future.
"We have a limited source of vegetable oil on campus," Green said.
But the U was not the first in Salt
Lake to take on this conversion technology.

Etta Crowley, a Salt Lake resident
who converted her 1984 Chevy van in
2006, says the conversion for her vehicle
cost only $BOO, two months of research
and two weeks ofmaintenance.
"I didn't have any experience working on cars. I think two months including research.and two weeks hands on.

It's totally possible to do it in less than
that. I've heard it can take a couple of
hours, if you have car experience," she
said.
Over the course of the 10,000 miles
she has traveled since the conversion,
she says the differences in the van
before and after the conversion are minimal.
"I barely notice a power loss, sometimes when Fm going uphill," Crowley
said.
The U conversion cost $3,100 for a new
fuel system and a conversion company
based in Logan, Golden Fuel Systems,
was hired to help with the project.
Although home conversions are
cheaper than the IPs project, Green says
money is not the point. "We save money,
probably not a ton. It's less about the
money saving and more about the environment. Money wasn't the motivating
factor."

Magee assumes new leadership at Lang Center
BY MICHAEL GLUK
mglukl@swarthmore.edu
Last May, Pat James announced her resignation from
the College after years of serving as the Lang Center's
Associate Director of Student Programs and Training.
Following James' resignation, former assistant professor Jennifer Magee has stepped in to take the vacated

position.

Elizabeth Crow 'O9, a Lang Scholar currently in
Romania developing her Lang program, summarized the
Center's feelings on James's departure and Magee's
arrival.
"I think everyone was surprised when we learned that
[James] was leaving. She's always been a big part of the
picture for students in the Lang Scholars Program, but I
think she wouldn't want us to see her departure as a
roadblock," Crow said.
While Crow said she would miss James's presence at
the Lang center, she expressed excitement about Magee
assuming her new duties in the position.
"[James] always projected such a positive "move on,
move forward' mentality, and this transition has encouraged us all to do so," Crow said. "I miss having Pat right
around the corner, but I'm also really excited to get to
know Mrs. Magee."
The Lang Center's mission drew Jennifer Magee's
attention to the organization; the opportunity for such
mentoring of and personal
engagement with
Swarthmore's students opened the possibility of a career
within it.
Magee earned her Ph.D. in conflict analysis and resolution, of which social activism is an intrinsic component.
She followed her education by serving as a rowing
instructor at the University of Washington, then by
matriculating to Swarthmore as an assistant professor in
the Peace and Conflict Studies department.
"My career has always involved working with students in some capacity, whether in or out of the class-

room," Magee said.
It is while teaching Introduction to Peace and Conflict
Studies and a mediation course in the department that
she was exposed to the Lang Center.
"My exposure to the Center was by Sarah Willie, [with
whom] I had conversations about incorporating a community-based learning component into my class," she
says.
The degree of collaboration and mentorship both with
the school at large and among the Center's staff itself left
Magee so deeply impressed that when Pat James's sudden resignation opened an opportunity for employment
in the organization, she jumped in to fill the position.

"[James] always projected such a
positive 'move on, move forward'
mentality... I miss having Pat right
around the corner, but I'm also really
excited to get to know Mrs. Magee."

"lt was a big decision," Magee said, considering her
love for working with students in all capacities, "but

I
decided to throw my hat in the ring."
The responsibility has been keeping Magee busy since
the beginning of August.
"What I started off doing is going through Pat's files
on Lang scholars, reports, and newsletters [...] I began by
just reading through everything," Magee said. "But,
since students have returned, I've begun meeting with
students every day."
This past week, she hosted a Lang Opportunity
Scholarship Information Session and a dinner for new
Lang scholars, and she has been advising student groups
interested in community service, social action, and
activism, and working to support service-learning based
initiatives on campus. Additionally, she plans to carry

out "assessment research" on the efficacy of "the work
we do here at the Lang center, and also on students' individual projects," she says.
Such a comprehensive assessment has never before
been undertaken at the Lang Center, making it an innovative step in the Center's development.
However, Magee said, "I haven't started it yet because
my first priority is to take care of students [...] Just to
reiterate, what we really strive for here is to connect people who are interested in making a difference in the
world with the necessary resources. If you are about
social action and civil engagement, come see me; you're
always very welcome.
The Lang Center, Magee said, "strives to be a hub of
activity for students interested in social action, community service, and social justice."
The institution perhaps most famously offers the coveted Lang Opportunity Scholarship, a grant awarded to
only six sophomores annually.
The package includes, according to the scholarship
Web site, "a budget of up to $lO,OOO to support a service
project which, in the opinion of the staff of the Lang
Center for Civic and Social Responsibility, will facilitate
social change in a significant way," eligibility for a paid
summer internship, and even money toward graduate
studies.
These grants are awarded to students with the capacity, creativity, and dedication to turn their visions of
social action into a functional project.
Recipient Hansi Lo Wang 'O9, for example, used his
funding to launch the Chinatown Youth Radio

Philadelphia.
"[lt is] a pilot program," Wang said, "for high school
students to create radio stories about Philadelphia
Chinatown, with the hope of the project continuing as a
long-term, youth-produced radio program about

Chinatown issues."

In addition to the Lang Scholarships, the Lang Center
provides transportation to groups who are involved in
community-based learning
i.e. shuttles or train tickets
to Chester or Philadelphia
as well as numerous smaller grants and scholarships.
Though Magee concedes that "the financial resources

are what make this groups different and distinct," one of
the center's most vital functions is to provide cost-free
guidance to those looking to pursue social activism.

"Another recourse we offer is a great space for students to meet that is conducive to student collaboration.
For faculty, in addition to meeting places, we offer support for developing community based learning," Magee

Magee also encouraged student groups to seek out

"Further, my colleagues and I are always available to
provide advice to student groups interested in specific

SWOCC caters to womyn
BY HAE-IN PARK

hpark6@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Womyn of Color
Collective, a new cultural group on campus, provides a safe space for women of
color to navigate their dual identities and
engage in enhancing women's rights. The
collective will be hosting panels and
events throughout the semester. The
organization is only open to women of
color, though the wider campus is also
"encourage[d] to attend
events and
engage in these discussions," Executive
...

Board Member Kaitlin Smith 10 said.

While the name of this new organiza-

tion may seem like a typo, it in fact conveys what this organization pursues. "The

Swarthmore

Womyn

of Color Collective

has chosen to spell woman with a y' so as

to create an identity that is independent of
any other entity," Cecilia Marquez 11,

another executive board member, said.
"The SWOCC is really just about having a community of womyn who are there
for each other. Because even if you feel
totally comfortable in the group meant to
be there for people of your racial and/or
ethnic background, with SWOCC, you are
not [fill in race] first then a womyn second
or vice versa," Executive Board Member
Sable Mensah 11 said. So far, over sixty
women have signed onto the group's mailing list and over half attended the first
meeting. "Many more women have
expressed interest in getting involved in
our events and initiatives," Executive
Board Member Grace Kaissal 10 said.
The first event the SWOCC has planned
is a reproductive justice panel on Sept. 16.

The panel features the executive directors
of four reproductive justice organizations.
The Collective is also hosting "a series of
luncheons in which we as womyn ofcolor
can build long lasting bridges and foster
connections that can benefit the community as a whole," Mensah, also an executive
member, said.
The members hope thatthese activities
would 'empower womyn socially, emotionally and academically," Marquez said. "We
want this to be a safe space for womyn of
color where they aren't forced to choose
between any of their many identities," she
said. The members said that for them, the
Collective takes precedence over other
current activities because it allows them
"to address issues of great importance that
reflect [their] multiple identities without
forcing [them] to make compromises,"
Kaissal said.
"The group is also run collective style
and while we currently have an executive
board structure, the decisions are made
collectively and based on consensus,"
Marquez said. All of the board members
share all responsibilities and therefore
have identical titles.
It is not the first time Swatties have
attempted to form an organization centered around women of color issues. In the
fall of 2007, Kaissal and several graduates
worked on a campaign to end violence
against women of color. While the issueoriented campaign never became a college
organization, the SWOCC will probably be
discussing violence against women of
color as one of an array ofissues thataffect
the women of color population at large,
Kaissal said.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Kidnapping charges dropped after missed court dates
The case against Tom T. Chiang, a
Virginia dental student accused of
attempting
kidnap
to
a
male
Swarthmore student in May, was dismissed in the Media District Court after
the victim neglected to appear for a
series of scheduled court dates this summer.
According to a May 2, 2008 article in
The Phoenix, “Suspect charged with
attempted kidnapping of Swarthmore
student,” Chiang allegedly drove up to
the student and asked for directions to
the President’s house, and that the student get in his car to show him the way.
The student refused but agreed to
walk beside the car. Chiang then tried to
force the student into his 1997 Lexus, at
which point the victim was able to break
free and run to the nearby Black
Cultural Center, where the police were
called.
Chiang was apprehended by Officer
Murrin of the Marple Police Department
after driving on the wrong side of
Springfield Road. He eventually abandoned his car at the intersection of
Sproul and Springfield. The victim was
then brought to the scene, where he positively identified the driver. Chiang was
charged with attempted kidnapping, a

Students for a Free Palestine (SFP), a
new campus organization that aims to
promote awareness of the Palestinian
situation, held its first meeting on
Tuesday, Sept. 9.

The co-founders of SFP said that they
were motivated by the desire to generate more dialogue about the controversial issue and highlight its human
dimensions. "We felt an absence in dialogue and discussion on campus," SFP
co-founder Sarah Brajtbord 'll said
. According to Brajtbord, many people on campus have opinions about the
Palestinian situation but there has not
been an organized forum in which to
discuss the issue. "People want to participate but we felt like no one wanted to
set up [a dialogue]," Brajtbord said,
adding that "individual passion brought
us together."
They were not deterred by the recent
hate crime, in which an unidentified
student wrote an offensive message on
another student's door. "We!re not easily intimidated. We're used to the fact
that people will have different reactions," SFP co-founder Nidal Alayasa 'll

said.
The co-founders said they view the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict not only as a
political dispute, but also as a matter of
human and civil rights.

Alayasa said that he sees similarities
between this conflict and the American

civil rights struggle waged during the
1950s and 19605, citing Martin Luther
King Jr.'s observation that "injustice
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."

The issue is "a universal conflict. It
doesn't have to be about politics,"
Fatima De Vol 'll said.
"You don't have to be Palestinian or
Israeli to be interested," Alayasa said.
SFP member Samia Abbass 'll said that
the group also aims to correct cultural
misperceptions. "In America, the image
of Palestine is skewed," Abbass said.
The co-founders stressed the importance of educating students about the
conflict and mobilizing them as advocates for the Palestinian community.
"American students need to know that
they have a voice in this [conflict],"
Brajtbord said.
The group hopes that a legacy of sustained dialogue will outlive the
founders after they graduate in two
years.

Alayasa said that the group aspires
to become a permanent fixture on campus and bring Palestine "out of the dark
and into the light." They want an openness about education and dialogue.
"We're not here to cause problems; we
felt a lack of a voice on campus,"
Brajtbord said.
Student Organization for Israel member Xander Warso 'll felt a similar lack.
There is a "deficiency of equally represented dialogue" about Palestine and
Israel on the campus, according to
Warso. He said he hopes that Students
for a Free Palestine will help to "broaden overall knowledge" about the issue.
The first meeting of SFP was held last
Tuesday in the Science Center.
Natalia Cote 'l2 seemed pleased with
the first meeting. "The members are
very friendly. I came here mostly to
learn, and I think I will get a lot from
it."

Campus shootings prompt concealed carry legislation
BY ANDREW DOSE
ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLLEGIAN (COLORADO STATE U.)
Following a string of campus shootings
(U-WIRE)
last year, universities and colleges across the nation
have taken to examining the safety policies of their campus, including allowing students to carry concealed
weapons on campus, a practice banned in most states.
The issue has achieved debate in the state legislatures
of both Virginia and Illinois, and has turned many eyes
towards the few campuses that have legalized concealed
carry.

there's not going to be an active shooter, we can't say
that there isn't going to be an assault."
Some students, however, feel less safe on a campus
that permits concealed carry.
Mark Spowart, a freshman open option major, said he
felt uncomfortable with the fact that anyone with a concealed weapons permit was allowed to carry a gun at
CSU.
"I think it's pretty messed up," Spowart said. "Ten
years ago I would have been fine with it, but in light of
everything that's been going on, there's a lot of fucked-up

...

Last year in Utah, state government enacted a bill
legalizing concealed carry on campuses across the state,

a decision which has yet to result in a documented incident.
Colorado State University is one of the few campuses
where students are permitted to carry concealed
weapons, granted they carry a carrying concealed
weapon permit.

The policy allows students with a permit to carry
their handgun most places on campus including class-

rooms but not residence halls.

...

Some people may have [guns] for

On Campus

Anthony Ryan, a senior art major and campus leader
for CSU's chapter of Students for Concealed Carry on
Campus, says it might help increase security if students
started carrying guns on campus.
"I think it could happen anywhere, and that's why I
think the administration here at CSU and the campus
police department allow us to do what we do," Ryan said.
"They know it is a possibility."
The issue, Ryan told The Rocky Mountain Collegian,
is one that affects all students.
"This isn't just about active shooters," he said. "This
isn't just about (Virginia Tech) and (University of
Northern Illinois) scenarios. This is about any kind of
protection from any kind of an assault. We can't say that

Mark Spowart 'l2
Ericka Taylor, a sophomore chemistry major, said it's
not up to students to worry about a shooting, but that

students who could carry guns on campus made her
nervous.
"I really don't like the fact (that concealed carry is
allowed) because we really don't need it here on campus," she said. "We have police, you should feel safe, so I
don't get why you should feel you need to bring your own
weapon here on campus when it's safe already. It makes

me nervous that people can be walking around with
(guns)."
Ryan argues that those who carry concealed weapons
are generally of a more healthy state of mind because
they have to qualify for a permit.
"We're law-abiding citizens; we have to be in order to
get approved," he said.
Jenny Romanin, a sophomore agricultural business
major and shotgun sports team president, agrees with
Ryan.

"The people that do everything by the book ...you go
through a course that's taught by the government," she
said. "They teach you safety. It's not like, 'Oh I have a

Safety's not political
Christian Heyne, a senior political science major at
California State University, Chico, and the President of
the recently sanctioned Chico State chapter of the Brady
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, feels that the main
issue at hand is the continuing rate of gun-related death
and violence in the United States.
"100,000 people die from gun violence every year, and
that's domestically, and those numbers are too crazy,"
Heyne said. "As far as I'm concerned, that's way too high.
It isn't a Republican issue, it isn't a Democrat issue, it's
an issue where our family members are dying because
the access to guns is too easy in America."
Regardless of political affiliation, Heyne says that
both sides can avoid the irrelevant and interfering
nature of political beliefs that push aside the real issue of
security.

"So much of this gets lost in party politics, especially
on the side of gun control," Heyne said. "People think
that we're trying to infringe upon their second amendment rights and that's not what we're really trying to
work toward."

Case on alleged Princeton admissions bias expands
BY MENDY FISCH
THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN
(PRINCETON U.)

(U-WIRE)
The Department of
Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR)
has broadened its investigation into a federal complaint filed in August 2006 by an
applicant to the University who was denied
admission. Jian Li claimed in the complaint that he was rejected because he is
Asian.
The University announced Tuesday that
it plans to provide information to aid the
OCR in the investigation, which will examine the admissions procedures used to
admit the Class of 2010. This significantly
widens the range of the inquiry, which had
previously focused solely on the decisionmaking process behind Li's rejection.
Despite receiving a perfect SAT score of
2400 and having several other educational
achievements on his record, Li was denied
admission at Harvard, MIT, Penn and
Stanford in addition to his rejection from
Princeton. Li has not filed similar complaints against these universities.
The OCR notified the University in
January of its decision to proceed with the
broader inquiry, called a "compliance
review," Department of Education
spokesman Jim Bradshaw said in an interview.
In a letter to members of the New Jersey
Congressional delegation, the OCR's chief
civil rights attorney, Timothy Blanchard,
wrote that the review will investigate
"whether the University discriminates
against Asians, on the basis of race or
national origin, in its admissions process,
in violation of Title VI" of the Civil Rights

THE PHOENIX

Act of 1964. Title VI prohibits racial discrimination in "any education program
operated by a recipient of Federal financial
assistance" from the Department of
Education, Blanchard explained in the let...

ter.

Both Bradshaw and University spokeswoman Cass Cliatt '96 declined to comment
on the nature of the information provided
by the University to the OCR. Bradshaw
said, however, that "the review expands
the inquiry to include all Asian-American
applicants and covers the original individual allegation."
University officials have denied any
bias against Li in the admissions process.
Dean of Admission Janet Rapelye said soon
after the 2006 filing of the complaint that
"the numbers don't indicate [discrimination]," and Cliatt maintained that
"Princeton does not discriminate on the
basis of race, color or national origin, and
our admission policy is in full compliance
with Title VI of the federal law" in a state-

ment released Tuesday evening.
In an e-mail to The Daily Princetonian,
Li expressed satisfaction with the new
direction the inquiry he initiated is taking.
"The Office for Civil Right[s'] decision to
broaden its investigation is good news for
those who oppose the use of racial preferences in college admissions," Li said.
"I filed the complaint not for my own
sake, but rather to hold Princeton accountable for racially discriminatory standards," he added. "Therefore, I had hoped
from the start that the scope of the complaint would be much wider than my indi-

vidual case."
Cliatt, on the other hand, said that the
University does not believe there is "any

merit" to Li's complaint. "We're very confident about our admissions policy, and we
welcome the opportunity to explain to [the]
OCR how we do it," Cliatt said.
Though Cliatt said that "there is no factor that is assigned a fixed weight" in the
admissions process, she acknowledged that
"race is one component that factors into"
the decision.
Bradshaw said that OCR opening the
investigation "in no way implies that the
OCR has made a determination on the merits of the complaint," and that the office
will proceed in the investigation as "a neutral fact finder."

"I filed the complaint not
for my own sake, but
rather to hold Princeton
accountable for racially
discriminatory standards."
Jian Li

Plaintive

But Scott Jaschik,

editor of Inside

Higher Ed, suggested that the OCR was
downplaying the significance of the move.
"At the very least, the shift suggests that
the government does not view the complaint as frivolous," Jaschik wrote in an
analysis of the investigation. "OCR regularly shuts down complaint investigations
...

and the agency has limited resources for

compliance reviews. Compliance reviews

September 11, 2008

tend to take place on issues that the
department believes are important." If the
OCR finds that the University is not in
compliance with the Civil Rights Act, the
office will try to reach a settlement with
the University before taking more serious
...

measures.

"In nearly all cases, we are able to reach
settlement agreements with schools short
of moving to enforcement," Bradshaw said.
"However, if an institution refuses to comply with the civil rights laws, enforcement
options do exist."
According to the OCR's case processing
manual, "enforcement actions" can include
termination of financial assistance to the
university or referral to the Department of
Justice for judicial proceedings.
After his rejection from Princeton, Li
enrolled at Yale in fall 2006.
That fall, Li told the 'Prince' that he was
"fine" at Yale, but he has since transferred
to Harvard.
Li declined to comment on his transfer
or his reasons for not filing complaints
against the other universities that rejected
him. In 2006, Rapelye said that Li's application was not as impressive as he alleges.
"Many others had far better qualifications," she said, adding that "his outside
activities were not all that outstanding."
Li said in the e-mail, though, that his
placement on the University's waitlist
before ultimately being rejected undermines Rapelye's claim.
"Princeton had initially waitlisted my
application," Li said. "So if it were not for
a yield which was higher than expected,
the admissions office very well may have
admitted a candidate whose 'outside activities were not all that outstanding."

refreshed in the morning, and the ability to
have everything taste like what you
thought it would when you first saw it.
Like most silly questions, it's pretty
revealing. My answer after a semester
abroad? To always have a phone card on
you (one that you paid for with your own
money) whenever you really need to make
a call to a friend 7000 miles away. My
answer two years ago? To be able to chose
my own body weight and stay there.
Unfortunately, that would have been the
same weight I was sophomore year in high
school.
I'm not the only one who has held unrealistic, unhealthy desires regarding her
weight. And yet, two years ago, dealing
with my freshman fifteen, I felt completely
alone in my struggle.
When I came home for Christmas break
that year, having gained 15 pounds on my
very slight frame, my best male friend
called me "plump". Numerous people told
me I looked "mature," which I, of course,
took for an insult. The amount of attention
that was paid to a few late-night pizzas and
celebratory Cheng Heng brought me to the
point that vacation that every time I went
out to eat with my friends, I ended up crying. To take the food would make me feel
awful about myself later, and to sit there
not eating while everyone else was made
me feel like a freak.
It wasn't until my best female friend
came home that I realized that something
bigger was going on. Julia is 5'10", blonde,
and applied to be on America's Next Top
Model. She's that girl and she's dealt with a
lot of hate from other women because of it.
Yet, when we went to 7-11 her first night in
and I was eying the donuts, she walked
straight to the back and made herself a cup
of tea. "Every time I'm hungry," she told
me "I drink tea instead."
Whoa.
And yet, no one is talking about it.
That's why I'm writing this column. For a
school teeming with dialogue, safe spaces,
and support groups for almost ever conceivable group or issue within the population at large, in my time here the campus
has been almost silent on the question of
body image issues.

The little public discussion I've encountered is well-intentioned, but the message
has been unfortunately simplistic, to a
point where it's almost dismissive: Love
your body just the way it is. Thanks. If it
were that easy, I'm sure we'd all do it. So,
many of us are left still feeling bad about
our bodies, but now also feeling bad that we
feel bad.
Which is maybe why there has been so
little dialogue on campus. As a school, we
value intelligence, passion, world-shaking
drive. We value alternative culture so
much that we look down on people who we
see as "mainstream". And what could be
more mainstream than a 20-year-old girl
complaining about her weight?
I'm sick of the stigma and sick of the
silence. I have not had a serious conversation with a girl about how she feels about
herself who hasn't revealed that she has
her own body image issues. I encountered
so many confessions of "disordered eating"
that grey zone before "Eating Disorder"
when eating and thought patterns aren't
quite right but there's nothing officially
wrong with what you're doing
that I've
stopped being surprised. A new survey by
Self Magazine and UNC Chapel Hill found
that "75 percent of American women surveyed endorse some unhealthy thoughts,
feelings or behaviors related to food or
their bodies."

And while I'm sure exceptions exist, my
there is a huge
problem with how we, as college-aged
females, view ourselves and our bodies.
And it's not the dramatic appearance of
Anorexia or Bulimia that we usually limit
our notice of these issues to. It's subtle, it's
complex, it's nuanced, and I'm going to talk
about it. If only to let someone who is reading this and struggling with his or her own
weight know that he or she is not alone.
experience says something:

For a school teeming with
dialogue, safe spaces, and
support groups... the
campus has been almost
silent on body image.
...

There are two main viewpoints I take on
this subject, that seem contradictory, but I
believe are inherent to any healthy
approach to understanding ourselves and
our bodies. Firstly: Our society holds unrealistic images of beauty that we should not
try to live up to because they are unhealthy
and impossible.
Secondly: It is okay to want to lose
weight for purely superficial reasons.
Foremost, I believe that it is most important to be healthy
and in many cases
making healthier choices will lead to
weight lost.
I want this column to be positive,
because that's the first step to feeling better
about ourselves: a positive attitude. I'm far
from perfect Oust ask the lovely editors of
this paper), but when I think about how low
I felt about myself two years ago, I'm pretty
shocked at how far I've come. I hope that
together all of us who struggle with our
bodies can take a step towards shocking
ourselves.

Consider someone who tells the
truth all the time. I almost always tell
the truth, to my detriment and benefit.
If you have a terrible haircut, I'll let

honesty often gets me into trouble: in
Sharpies, in Willets, in the world. But
I continue nonetheless for I believe

GABRIEL ZACARIAS
Truth or Perdify
During a class one semester at our
current institution, a professor was
discussing, almost relevantly, what
someone college-age would think if
they saw our professor nearing them

on the walk. I said: "Old." She didn't
really like it.
It seems to me that honesty is often
overrated. We talk about it being the
best policy, only to mean it's actually
the best policy in certain, limited situations. After all, how many situations
can you name where absolute honesty
is best? Excepting situations of personal safety, when shouldn't honesty be
used?
While honesty is perhaps preferred
over deception, it depends on how
desirable the information is. When
Calvin, of Calvin and Hobbes, refers to
his potentially pregnant wife as one
reminiscent of "a hippopotamus with a
gland' problem" (oh, how the wine
talks), his wife strikes him. People

don't generally like to hear that their
new haircut makes them look like a
baboon's rear, or when their makeup
makes them look like a homeless pig
with facial paralysis, or whatever.
However, people love to hear how they
remind onlookers of George Clooney,
or whomever you young folk love
these days. I don't mean to appear confused as to why this is the case; of
course people prefer to hear good
things that make them feel good
inside, as if their life were actually better than it is.
I like to think of life as an unpaid
search for the Truth note the capital
"T" and no, not the Mulder and Scully
type
in which we are all engaging
daily with both large truths (green and
yellow skittles suck) and small truths
(this could all be a dream). I feel that
regardless of the truth, I have a right
to hear it and not be bogged down by
personal bullshit or deception. After
all, people don't merely stay silent if
they don't have a compliment; they
rave positively, lying through their
teeth.
This is because staying silent
would eventually be understood as the
lack of complimentary thoughts (pay
attention to signals, people!). That
means not only are we being lied to,
we are lying to ourselves about the
truthfulness of events going on around
us. So little honesty! What's the alter-

that honesty, even brutal honesty, is
better than not knowing if the comments coming at you are on the level.
Sadly, reasons of personal safety, physical and otherwise, preempt us from
being honest.
I recently got pulled over while
driving. The officer told me he had
"clocked" me going fifty in a 35 zone. I
was incredulous, mostly because I
know when I drive over the speed limit
(most of the time), and this was not
one of those times. After enough discussion, the officer talked about how
he was trained to sense how fast cars
go by looking at them. I felt like saying
"So, when you said you 'clocked' me,
you actually meant you imagined my
speed in your head and took steps as if
the world that exists in your head was
manifesting itself in my world, excuse

me, in everybody else's world." But I
didn't say that I didn't want a ticket.
Thus it seems that there are two main
reasons to lie, to protect other people
and to protect ourselves. I wonder, if
we
both ourselves and others
can't handle tough truths, how can we
hope to make it in this tough world?

Regardless of the truth, I
have a right to hear it
and not be bogged down
by personal bullshit or
deception.
Imagine a world where everyone
told the perfect truth, except in situations with demonstrated physical or
other danger. Would we want to live in
this world? We would often get hurt, as
well as praised, shocked, and surprised as well as surer of our relationships. We all have thoughts and feelings that we shouldn't share (such as
the random results of synaptic firings
in a body with sufficient testosterone),
but we also constantly evaluate and
judge each other, and I believe that
open dialogue is better than having
these thoughts in secrets where we
might potentially brood on them.
This column is going to be a step
towards this world. Deception and its
bedfellows will be shaken out and discussed. The awkwardness at this
school will be probed and dissected.
No stone of truth shall be left
unturned, regardless of the disgusting,
rancid crap that may be found underneath. For all we know, there might be
a squished cockroach or there might
be, uh, the opposite of that. I welcome
your company on this journey, and
may we find ourselves together.

'Simpsons' and 'Sex' have success at the multiplex
Television columnist Alex Israel contemplates the jump from small screen to silver screen

ALEX ISRAEL

Pencils Down, Pass
the Remote
Now, those of you who read my column
on a regular enough basis to be aware
that the subject is television
and those
who are sufficiently in the know to realize that I have never even
thought
the name

much less denigrated their music in a

be wondering why the

headline of this column has the word "multiplex" in the title. "Why
is she talking about
movies?" you might be
asking; "I thought someone
else covered that. Shouldn't
she just be talking about Lost
and South Park?"
To answer you curious readers (and to explain to those who
were previously unaware of the
existence of this column), yes, my
subject is television and anything
that has to do with television. In
this case, I'm including movies based
on long-running and beloved (or not)
TV shows in the category of "things
that are related to television." This summer saw the release of a good number of
films that were based on or continuations
of TV series sandwiched between
remakes of previously existing films,
sequels to comic-book blockbusters, and a
few honest-to-goodness original screenplays. I witnessed the results of several
small-screen to big-screen transfers, and I
got to thinking: What is it that makes a
successful TV-based movie and is it in
any way related to what makes a successful TV show?

[The Simpsons] has penetrated the pop culture
lexicon in a way that only
elite works of art have
managed.
Please forgive the Carrie Bradshawstyle narration, but the adaptation that
got me thinking about this particular sub-

THE PHOENIX

ject was the “Sex and the City” movie. I
didn’t watch “Sex” when it originally
aired on HBO; back then I was too young
to appreciate jokes about funky spunk
and not yet interested enough in fashion
to understand the concept of “shoe porn.”
Last summer, however, I watched a few
episodes of the show at the urging of my
mother, a woman who believes that “Sex”
is the alpha and omega of television
shows. One of those episodes was the
series finale, which was a truly spectacular example of television at its finest (and
which also contained a great linguistic
moment, in which Mr. Big utilizes the
phenomenon of infixation to demonstrate
his love for Carrie. If you don’t know
what infixation is, then you should absofuckinglutely take a linguistics class). A
final episode as perfect as that of “Sex”
made the prospect of a movie seem extraneous.
In contrast, by the time I saw “The
Simpsons Movie” I was completely in love
with the series. Those of you who know
and love the show the way I do will understand that “The Simpsons” is so much
more than a TV show; it has penetrated
the pop-culture lexicon in a way that only
elite works of art have managed. The
inclusion of Homer Simpson’s annoyed
grunt “d’oh!” in the Oxford English
Dictionary shows that the phenomenon of “The Simpsons” has gotten to
the point where a film seems com-

This wink at the audience acknowledges
upfront the criticism leveled against the
film and therefore allows the audience to
forget about it and pay attention to other
things, such as the famed (and very
catchy) Spider-pig song.

"Sex" also uses the cinematic format to

its advantage. In this case the space on the
screen is less important; it is the time that
matters. Because the film has two hours to
unfold, rather than the thirty minutes per

week that the show had, the writers could
give Carrie and co. a longer story, one that
takes Carrie to the altar, then Mexico and

few days. This is a film, however, that also
acknowledges the limitations of the genre;
because the story arc is primarily about
Carrie, the arcs involving Samantha,
Charlotte and Miranda are smaller and quieter, yet still compelling. I do wish that
Charlotte had been given more screen time;
her story, unfortunately, was cut back in
order to give space to a rather tedious section in which Carrie hires a personal assistant, played by an ill-used Jennifer Hudson.
All in all, however, the film was successful
in its mission: to'give "Sex" fans one more
night with their girlfriends.

how to take advantage of
the big screen in making their smallscreen classics work as films.
In “The Simpsons Movie,” the biggest
change was technological. The writers
and animators took advantage of the
large-screen format to do things that simply aren’t possible on the small screen.
They used the technology to their advantage when creating crowd scenes that contained all the inhabitants of Springfield
who have ever appeared on the show
(allegedly; I can think of a few who were
missing) and used the widescreen format
and increased color palette to add depth
and beauty to the images of Springfield,
as well as to more exotic locales such as
Alaska. The film’s creators also used their
trademark satiric wit to poke fun of their
desire to make a movie: “The Simpsons
Movie” opens with the titular family
watching the cinematic version of “Itchy

show, creating a situation in which
Homer can complain about “paying for

Coffee Fashion and Cigarettes
morning, but that it doesn't matter anyway. It helps one to avoid that ill-fated
trying-too-hard look, and ironically, it
projects confidence, even if the habit
may suggest otherwise.

Of course, it's not just street fashion
blogs that have pictures of women and
men smoking. The most high-end couture
labels have always had models smoking
in their ads, and it was even seen on the
runway during Jean Paul Gaultier's
Fall/Winter 2008 collection for Hermes.
Cigarettes have been carefully placed
and planned into the editorial spreads of

years, and it's no wonder that Yves Saint

MING CAI

The Swatorialist
It seems only fitting that the inspiration for my first Phoenix column would

be a photo from The Sartorialist, the blog
whose name I liberally used to make a
not-so-clever pun for my column title.
The photo/post was entitled “On the
Street...That Girl! Paris” and featured a
lithe young woman wearing a summer
mini dress, bolero shrug, knee socks and
peep-toe pumps. The length of the dress
and her innocently nonchalant pose
made her legs look miles long, and the
structure of her outfit contrasted beautifully with the old and graying limestone
walls in the background. But that wasn't
what people focused on in their comments.

The source of controversy lay in what
a cigarette, held
she held in her hand
delicately between her fingers in midtap. Readers bashed Sart for “promoting
smoking” by featuring a picture of that
same girl with cigarette in hand a couple
of weeks earlier. Many commented that
the girl looked cute, but would look better without the cigarette. Others disagreed and retaliated that smoking is a
personal choice, or that it simply adds to
the overall aesthetics and the attitude
projected in the photos.
Given the percentage of people who
smoke in Europe and the number of
street style fashion blogs that photograph
there, it isn't surprising that cigarettes
often appear to be the accessory of
choice. While sometimes smoking completes the look (think chic fashion editor
dressed in head-to-toe black), it seems to
fit even more when there is a noticeable
contrast. What could better balance out a
ruffled girly frock than a lit cigarette? Or
over-sized nerdy glasses and loafers? It
sends the message that one may or may

with women smoking my immediate
the smoking
reaction is not distaste
only adds to the nostalgic feel and mystery. If there were one word to sum up
the “look” that cigarettes project, it
would be simply “cool.”
That leaves street fashion photographers in a difficult situation. Runway
shows and couture ads may feature
smoking, but street fashion shows people
in everyday life. Would a photographer
pass up a good photo opportunity if the
person happened to be smoking? Does the
cigarette complete the picture or does it
ruin it? The Sartorialist has explicitly
said that certain photos are not meant to
“celebrate smoking.” Sometimes he also
has to post a message telling his readers
to direct their attention to the real focus

This seems like a fairly responsible way
to handle the often-touchy subject, but it
does nbt mask the fact that there seems
to be a spike in the number of comments
every time a picture features a smoker.
Perhaps people are so concerned with
photographs of smokers because it is

know, that girl may have other
unhealthy habits, like not eating enough
fiber, but you wouldn't be able to tell just
by looking at a picture of her or seeing
her on a street. But if the entire fashion
community quit smoking, would that be

more effective than those Truth commercials? Though it would certainly stop
adding to the glamorous image of smoking, smoking is such a deeply entrenched
cultural condition that it would be hard
to remove it altogether. What's in is in, so
for now, smoking will just have to remain
visually polarizing, no matter how hazy
the subject can be.

Feelin' Groovy: Olde Club Fall 2008
Although it has been a while since the cold stone walls of Olde Club last shook
with raucous sound, Swarthmore’s favorite venue for alternative music will soon be
up and rocking once again. This semester, Olde Club booking director Charlie
Decker ’O9 has crafted a fall lineup comprised of various up-and-coming acts and a
few that have already received critical acclaim. Decker hopes that this semester’s
performances will bring a diverse range of music to Swarthmore without abandoning Olde Club’s reputation as an indie stronghold. “You don’t want five bands that
sound the same,” Decker said. “It’s all about finding the balance between accessibility but also innovation.”

September 26: Titus Andronicus

w/ Dead Heart of Bloom

Ever expanding and contracting
in band member numbers, Titus
Andronicus will headline Olde
Club’s September 26 show. Now
comprised of five New Jersey-ites,
Titus Andronicus plays music that
borrows its attitude from vintage
icons such as The Buzzcocks and
The Replacements, Dead Heart of
Bloom will open for Titus
Andronicus with a more traditional
alternative sound. Despite the somewhat gloomy moniker, the band features soaring guitars, gentle drums
and brooding vocals. Their style has
been compared to the “eclectic
eccentricity of Beck” and the “dramatics of Bowie.”

November 21: Bishop Allen w/ These
United States
These United States will start off the night
on November 21 These United States is an
unornamented “psychedelic folk” band that
draws inspiration from the famed Muppets
band Electric Mayhem and “the rhythm section of Shakespeare’s brain.” Then, Olde
Club will explore its quiet and sentimental
side when Bishop Allen takes the stage. Also
from Brooklyn, Bishop Allen recently
received a brief cameo in the Michael Cera
vehicle Nick and Nora’s Infinite Playlist.
Unlike Ponytail, Bishop Allen does not venture into bizarre and uncharted musical
waters. Instead, they adhere to a lighter, poppier sound sometimes tinged by decrescendoes of piano-fueled introspection.

November 15: Ponytail w/ Creaky Boards
■
If any performance will cause a riot, it will be Ponytail’s
on November 15. Lead singer Molly Siegel delivers shrieks
and birdcalls against the rumble of her band’s fast-paced
classic rock. Although Ponytail does not have a bags player
or songs with traditional “lyrics,” Siegel’s dramatic stage
presence more than compensates for what the band lacks.
“Their live show is supposedly fantastic,” said Decker.
Ponytail will be preceded by a set from the Brooklyn sextet
Creaky Boards. Under the guidance of frontman Andrew
Hoepfner, the group’s only core member, Creaky Boards has
delved into folk, costume drama and Brian Wilson-inspired
sunshine pop. Most recently, Hoepfner has taken the
Wilsonian route and toured extensively with just a glockenspiel and computer. Whatever incarnation of Creaky Boards
Hoepfner brings to Olde Club will be a surprise.

with punk beats. Citing influences such as Nirvana and
the Shangri-Las, the group will be an interesting contrast to the bluegrass rock of O’death which can be
described as “part southern gothic spiritual, part moonshine fueled hoedown.” Known for intense shows that
border on the profound, O’death fuses the pluck of the
banjo with a hard-edged aesthetic. “They’re a completely

something breathtaking about their

pop. Thankfully, the group did not get too

The Trio Kavkasia, composed of Alan Gasser, Stuart
Gelzer and Carl Linich, is a group of three musicians
who perform traditional vocal music from the Caucasus
nation of Georgia. Georgian folk music is distinctively
dark, haunting and full ofrich polyphonic textures that

came into being long before Western Renaissance music
fully developed the form.
The Trio Kavkasia has sung at venues including the
Tbilisi Opera House and Lincoln Center, and on Sunday,
Sept. 14, they will be performing at Swarthmore.

Bill Scott's abstract and vivid paintings hang in List Gallery. Scott will give a lecture at 4:30 p.m. in LPAC cinema.

Artist Scott unveils two exhibits
BY SHAWN DOHERTY

sdohertl@swarthmore.edu

Local artist Bill Scott, whose
vibrant abstract paintings have been
shown in places like Philadelphia,
New York and London, will unveil his
two exhibitions in the List Gallery
and in McCabe Library this
Thursday, Sept. 11 Scott will highlight these shows with a lecture at
4:30 p.m., followed by a reception in
the LPAC cinema.
Scott,
who was raised in
Haverford and now lives in
Philadelphia, says he is excited but
somewhat nervous to have his work
at Swarthmore, his first area solo
exhibition in six years. "It is both a
pleasure and nerve-racking," Scott
said. While Scott's two exhibits are
distinct, they complement and inform
each other.
Scott's exhibit of paintings in the
List Gallery is the primary focus, but
his exhibit of prints in the McCabe
Library provides a context to help
better understand Scott's paintings
and his methods. It shows his finished prints alongside various trials
of different color schemes as well as
the plates for these prints.
"[The print exhibit] shows the evolution of the painting process.
Printmaking deconstructs a painting
and then puts it back together again,"
Scott said.
The evolution of each painting is
important to Scott, who said, "I paint
improvisationally. I never know what
a painting is going to be when I start."
In describing his style, Scott
referred to himself as "a nearsighted
realist," adding that he became an
abstract artist during a time when he
needed glasses but was unaware of it.

14

When he finally put on a pair of glasses, he was overwhelmed by the number of details he could see, like the
individual strands of his shoelaces
and the number of bricks on distant
buildings.
"I took my glasses off. It was like it
was too much information," Scott

said.

Similarly, Scott's art is not focused

on details.

According to Scott, his paintings
are more about knowing where
things are located in space than what
they are specifically. Therefore, his
paintings are extremely open to interpretation. Depending on the viewer,
one of his paintings might call to
mind a building, or a landscape, or a
particular emotion. "I don't mind

that," he said. "I like it."
Scott's lecture will highlight these
exhibitions and make his art more
accessible to the campus community.
While it promises to be interesting
and informative for all who attend,
Scott will gear the lecture toward
young artists, particularly young
painters.
He plans to speak on his own artistic development throughout college
and art school and how those changes
unfolded. Through this, he hopes to
convey to young painters that, "We
all go through the same insecurities,
the same struggles, and have similar
triumphs as well."

Studio Art Professor Brian
Meunier points out the importance of
lectures like Scott's to Swarthmore
art students.
He says, "I make it mandatory for
all. my classes to attend all List
Gallery events and lectures because I
myself learned so much from listening to artists talk about their life as

artists and the twists and turns their
work took over years of discipline."
Besides seeing Scott's artwork and
attending his lecture, studio art seniors will get another chance to work
with Scott when he critiques their
artwork, both as a group and one-onone.
List Gallery Director Andrea
Packard described the selection
process Scott went through in order
to be one of the five artists featured in
a List Gallery exhibit each year as
highly competitive.

"I paint
improvisationally. I
never know what a
painting is going to be
when I start."
Bill Scott
Local artist
She said that she is glad Scott was
selected, first and foremost because of
his own artistic accomplishments,

but also because of his broader work
in the field, both as a curator and a
writer, especially for "Art in
America."
Scott is very pleased with this
exhibition, but is already looking
toward the future. "I like all the
paintings, but I still want to paint
more," he said. He is currently working on about ten other paintings in
various states of development. "I'm
always most interested in what I'm
doing right now, the things I have in
my studio."

Gasser, Gelzer and Linich all have extensive experience studying, performing and teaching Georgian
music.
All three are Georgian State Laureates and have
received the Silver Medal of the Georgian Ministry of
Culture for theirrole in popularizing Georgian music.
The three became interested in Georgian music
while singing in the Yale Russian Chorus and the
Kartuli Ensemble, a non-profit organization dedicated
to Georgian folk-song and dance. They were captivated
by the strange and complex music.
"A Georgian song is like a jolt of electricity for someone who has only heard traditional Western choral
music," they wrote in the liner notes of their third CD
"The Fox and the Lion."
From this initial interest and passion, the three
began a more in-depth study of Georgian history and
culture, delving more deeply into the fascinating and
often neglected history of the country. "There's a huge
range of types of songs, from lyric love songs to upbeat
work songs, from Georgian Orthodox liturgical music to

spirited toasting songs (mravalzhamier)," Wright said.
"It's...inseparable from Georgian culture."
The concert should prove to be an eye-opening and
truly exciting experience. Georgian music differs fundamentally from Western music in that it uses an untempered scale. In an untempered scale, the spacing
between notes is different than in Western music, in
that the intervals are evenly spaced while a Western

scale makes use of both whole and half steps. The even

spacing creates intervals like the stretched perfect

fourth.
This different spacing in Georgian music creates a
largely dissonant sound, as well as melodies thatfollow
unpredictable and exciting melodic patterns.
All three members of the Trio have done extensive
work not only in performing Georgian music, but also
in researching the musical mysteries posed by Georgian
tuning. Georgian music is built around the "quintave"
rather than the octave. In such a structure, the fifth
scale degree rather than the third becomes the most stable interval in the scale. This structure affects the sound
of the music specifically by removing a sense of major
and minor chords, replacing them with a lingering
sense of instability.
Ifthat explanation seems daunting, don't worry. The
music is easy to appreciate, yet still powerful.
As event organizer Becky Wright 11points out, the
music is "true folk music that didn't come from some
brilliant composer, but from generations of Georgians
who sang, without any musical training or theory, just
because they loved it. The untempered scale and dark
timbre...combine to make a sound quite unlike anything you've heard before. It's music that resonates
through your entire body." Wright made use of the
resources provided by the Cooper Foundation to organize the concert. She first heard Georgian music at a summer program called Village Harmony where she studied
withLinich.
"At first I just wanted to have Carl [Linich] teach a
workshop, but another studentmentioned to me the possibility that Kavkasia could come, and I just thought,
why not?" Wright said. "It's great that Swarthmore will
be able to see them perform and learn from them." She
added, "the music is stunningly gorgeous, but it's also a
window to cultural understanding, and for me, that's
the most important thing for anyone, with musical
training or without, to take away from the concert."
The concert will take place in Lang Concert Hall on
Sunday at 3 p.m. It is open to the public, and admission
is free.

Princess Anastasia pulls out her magic camera and sets in her viewfinder a gigantic bluishpurple womyn-demon with about a dozen breasts.
A few minutes ago, that many-breasted creature
was a dominatrix-sorceress who was working
with the infamous mystic, holyman and lover
Rasputin to steal Mother Russia away from the
righteous rule of the Romanov dynasty. Believe it
or not, I have some pretty legit thematic analysis
running through my head as I play the RPG
"Shadow Hearts: Covenant" (PS2). "Shadow
Hearts" is part of an odd sub-sub genre of games:
occult alternative history. Take the Earth (it's a
pretty sweet Earth, you might say), pose that
magic/faeries/Reptilians are real and let loose
with whatever crazy shit the supernatural could
possibly do in a "real" historical setting. From a
gut level, I might say thatthis is a great ideafrom
the get-go, but in practice, I can imagine trying to
mix the rather real with the absolutely absurd
could get cumbersome and perhaps even banal.
Our sweet Princess Anastasia in "Shadow
Hearts," for example, joins the game party
because everyone in her family has been
bewitched by Rasputin, thus leading to the sorry
state ofaffairs we wouldrecognize as pre-October
Revolution Russiai There's a simplistic plot-logic
at play in the framing of this conflict; since the
current problems of Russia are caused by one
very evil man, then maybe Russia is normally a
wonderful place. This plot-logic is rewarded:

RJD2, Broken Social Scene feel good lost
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DAISY SCHMITT
dschmitl@swarthmore.edu

Bringing together elements of classic action movies,
trippy lights, multi-layered instrumentals, some barely intelligible half-jokes about Swarthmore, an
impromptu horn section comprised of Swarthmore
students,and most importantly, good vibes,
Saturday’s Large Scale Event brought over 500 students to LPAC for performances by RJD2 and

Broken Social Scene. Whether you were
packed into the front of the venue or lingering in the very back of the room, the
excitement was palpable from the first of
RJD2’s synth beats to the last note of
Broken Social Scene’s encore. Both RJD2
and Broken Social Scene delivered electrie performances
the witty, whimsy and
infectious beats of RJD2's set made it impossible to
stand still and contrasted perfectly with the beautiful
intricacies ofBroken Social Scene's melodies (though it
is important to note that their faster-paced songs caused
several sort-of-mosh-pits).
The night would not have been possible, however, if it
weren’t for the efforts of both the LSE committee and
Assistant Coordinator of Student Activities Paury
Flowers. Reid Wilkening TO, who has been chair of the
committee since last year’s Worthstock, said that the
show turned out well from both an audience and behindespecially given the rain and the

together was reported to be a relatively easy
process, though not one that was devoid of

Wilkening also noted the bands were easy to work
with, very accommodating and friendly. "The performers
were excited to work with each other," Wilkening said,
adding that the members of Broken Social Scene were
impressed with RJD2, whose set they caught from LPAC's
1 and whose equipment they asked to try out before
the show. Wilkening also noted the effectiveness of the
contrast between the two artists' musical styles, a sentiment echoed by many students, including Linnet DavisStermitz 12 who found it to be "a grand fusion of trippy
danceability and instrumental bliss."

and Broken Social Scene’s receptiveness to the
requests of the fans who cheered for a longer set and
shouted out specific songs they wanted to hear (songs that
the band actually incorporated into their performance,
altering their planned set list mid-performance) speaks to
the importance that Broken Social Scene placed on building the relationship between artist and audience, a detail
that ultimately made their performance not only musically transcendent but also engaging on a personal level.

Dining Services changes unpalatable to students
Something is rotten in the state of Dining Services.
First, it is important to note that this article is not an
attack on the hard-working staff of Dining Services; it is
a critique of administrative policies, and nothing more.
First, a quick bit of math. Sharpies meal prices for
guests run $3.75 for breakfast, $5.50 for lunch, and $7.50
for dinner. At these prices, eating every meal possible at
Sharpies (amounting to six breakfasts, seven lunches,
and seven double Indian bar dinners) amounts to $113.50
per week, or $1,816 per semester, or a rather distasteful
$3,632 per year. Swarthmore students, however, have the
privilege of paying $5,514 annually in "board," a non-specific amount that appears to account for little more than
meals. Food, it turns out, is 52 percent more expensive if
you attend the college than if you don't. Meal equivalencies are even less forgiving.
The financial debate over the cost of Swarthmore
meals has raged for years. In an Oct. 5, 2006 Phoenix column entitled "No such thing as a free lunch" (a title that
seems eerily suited to the Dining Services debacle at
hand), the authors tried to justify the disparity in meal
pricing based on two claims: first, that the college subsidizes guest meals for visitors to the school; and second,
that students pay less than what their education costs
the school in the first place, so what's $1,882 between
friends?
But what is most distasteful, and what has prompted
the resurrection of this rather tedious issue, is the manner in which Swarthmore students have been fleeced
anew this semester by Dining Services. In addition to
making frankly bamboozling modifications to the pricing and point structure of the 17 and 14 meal plans
(although the increased number of points is appreciated),
student meal plan dollars now buy less than they used to.

The list of sometimes absurd changes include:
The removal of the hugely popular free pickles and
potato chips from Essie Mae's. Pickle policy technically
is: one free pickle wedge with the purchase of a cold
sandwich, or 25 cents otherwise. Pickles are no longer
over-the-counter: while students once had the luxury of
selecting their own pickle(s), they must now explicitly
request the desired quantity of pickles while ordering
their meal. An average of eight potato chips (plus fragments) are now provided in individual packages, but
again, only with the purchase of a cold sandwich.

Food, it turns out, is 52 percent
more expensive if you attend the
college than if you don't.
The size of cereal packages has been reduced from an
approximate caloric content of 240 calories to a paltry 70
calories, while the price has remained unchanged. While
on the subject of cereals, the elimination of half of the
cereals in Sharpies (including the invaluable organic
options) has not gone unnoticed by the breakfasting
masses. Despite assurances that changes to the sale of
packaged goods would be delayed until next semester,
the availability oflarge bags of chips, dip, Pop-Tarts, and
other prepackaged foods has, in practice, been greatly
diminished.

These changes, and many others like them, raise two
concerns. First, are student meal plans the right place to

cut back an already hemorrhaging budget? Unlike many
of our peer institutions, Swarthmore does not allow students to live on campus without subscribing to the
College's meal plan. Students dissatisfied with the pricing, quality, or availability of food have few options for
solving this problem beyond the faint comfort of the
Sharpies napkin board.
If Dining Services is as committed to providing quality service to its "customers," as Director of Dining
Services Linda McDougall called Swarthmore's students
in last week's issue, they should feel confident in giving
them the right to choose with their feet. Dining Services
uses college policies to lock students into plans that fail
to serve their needs.
Second, why has Dining Services eliminated its former transparency in the process of changing their policies and prices? The Dining Services Committee became
dormant in the spring of last year and has not reconvened this semester.
The promised forum on meal plan changes has likewise flown under the radar. However, Therese Hopson,
the Front of House Manager at Sharpies, has assured the
Phoenix that a meeting between Student Council representatives, Dining Services staff, and Associate Vice
President of Facilities Management Stu Hain is being
scheduledfor later this month. More alarmingly, pickles,
chips, and Dizzy Dino Fruit Snacks were dropped without comment.
If Dining Services wants students to accept their
changes, the least they can do is justify them. If eliminating free pickles represents such a substantial costcutting measure, show us the math. Swarthmore students are hardly unreasonable; we merely like to be
informed as to where our $5,514 are going.

Republican or Democrat: Vote for Obama in November

PHILIP ISSA

There is more at stake in the upcoming
election than foreign policy, economic policy, social policy and a handful of
Supreme Court nominations. What is really at stake is the nature of American political discourse and whether it is to
embrace idealism and progressivism or to
reject such values for the comforts of complacency, intolerance and pessimism.
Over the past several years, our society
has become increasingly pessimistic
about dealing with the hurdles it faces to
form a "more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide
for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity."
Our Congress, representative of us and
charged with pursuing the above goals as
laid out in the Constitution, has roundly
failed to discuss the hard realities of
inequality in opportunity and education,
of global warming, of shrinking personal
liberties and of a crumbling national

infrastructure, amongst other things.
Even when controlled by the opposition
party, Congress has refused to even consider impeaching a President that has
committed (off the top of my head) two
felonies (instructing the leak of a name of
a CIA operative; instructing torture) and
two constitutional crimes (suspending
writs of habeas corpus; unwarranted
eavesdropping on citizens). This is indicative of complacency with the way things
are rather than a yearning for the way
things should be.
Congress's silence on these important
issues is not surprising considering the
current state of political discourse.
Consider how the predominant discourse
is inherently complacent and intolerant of
new ideas and cultures.
Last year, a smear campaign led
against the original principal and founder
of the Khalil Gibran International
Academy, the only Arabic-English language public school in New York City, left
her in disrepute and without a job the
very year that she founded the school.

Congress has refused to
even consider impeaching
a President who has
committed two
felonies... and two
constitutional crimes.
...

This is despite the fact that 67 other
languages are taught at bilingual academies in the very same school system. Nor
did it seem to matter that the ArabAmerican founder was a highly respected
educator before pursuing this extension of

into
American
Xenophobes and religious fundamentalists will always rail against foreigners,
but it is an indictment against the current
state of political discourse that the smear
campaign managed to propagate so effectively without being challenged by rational New Yorkers and a fair municipal gov-

ernment.

Examples of a complacent and intolerant political discourse abound. This is a
discourse that is not alarmed by the violence in Trinidad, a predominantly black
neighborhood in Washington D.C. that has
seen so much violence that District police
have closed the neighborhood off from
non-residents; that does not discuss granting the residents of Puerto Rico and D.C.
representation in Congress or an equal
right to self-governance that other US citizens enjoy; and that does not speak about
the continued deferral of hope for poor cit-

izens of New Orleans.
It is a discourse that, if left unchallenged, will fiercely oppose the life-saving
research that our biology graduates will
conduct; will ostracize those of us who
stand up for the rights of the disenfranchised and who struggle to build bridges
among the mosaic ofAmerican immigrant
cultures; will mock the students who are
brave enough to accept Al Gore's challenge to switch to renewable resources
within ten years; and will demand that
our female graduates accept a lower pay
scale than their male counterparts.
Idealism suffocates when discourse
does not embrace ambition but is instead
complacent, intolerant and pessimistic.
As Swarthmore students, our work
depends on our ability to envision a better
world and pursue the ideas that will constitute that world. To live in a society that
is hostile to idealism, as we do now, is to
impose self-restraints on our liberty to

dream and to work as we please. For this
I believe that every single
Swarthmore student, regardless of party
affiliation, owes it to our future to vote for
Barack Obama.
A vote for Obama is a rejection of the
current state of political discourse that
has constrained our growth as a society in
ways beyond which I have just described.
Look at the rhetoric coming out of each
campaign. Obama's rhetoric matches his
policy: ambitious and idealistic; hopeful
yet flexible. McCain's rhetoric and policies: complacent and antiquated; intolerant and rigid.
reason,

Idealism suffocates when

pessimistic.
The victor will bring his rhetoric into
the White House and, by extension, into
American politics and media. Certainly,
Obama's presidency will not be all things
to all people.
Reform of all types will be slow and
perhaps not even completed (or considered seriously) during his term. However,
Obama's election will widen the scope of
political discourse to include new and progressive ideas, the types of ideas that form
the basis of a Swarthmore education.
The deadlines for registering to vote

approaching. Check out vote4ll.org for

Opinions
US hypocrisy about China

JAMES MAO

Over International Borders
At first glance, what the government of the People's Republic of China
has to offer is repulsive to any selfrespecting freedom lover. After all, the
founding fathers would not have
approved of a single-party state with
heavy media control and various
human rights offenses on its rap sheet.
These damning facts have become
the asterisk in virtually every single
Western media report on China.
Newsweek exemplified this recurring
phenomenon in its September 15 issue,

reporting

Beijing's construction of

numerous concessions for disabled persons (including equipping the Great
Wall with ramps and elevators) only to
bemoan the fact that the still-modernizing city had a long way to go in becoming truly disability-friendly. That is
only one of the tamer examples of what
is essentially a continuous backhanded
complimenting ofChina.
Such treatment ofChina has led this
Asian-American who has lived in the
country for ten years
to wonder
about the hypocrisy and necessity of
this kind of labeling. When Team
Darfur member Joey Cheek was denied
access to the Olympic Games, NBC commentator Bob Costas called the decision
"outrageous." News outlets from ESPN
to The Virginia Gazette portrayed
Cheek as some sort of human rights
martyr. But what is really outrageous is
that Cheek felt the need to travel across
the Pacific and tell the Chinese government to promote peace in Sudan. Could
Cheek not have played his heroic role
for human rights by staying on his
home soil and telling the White House
to do something about Guantanamo Bay
already?
In a similar vein, it is true that the
totalitarian state does exercise significant
i.e. "complete"
control over

the Chinese media. And it is inevitable
that the Western world, given its democratic institutions, views state censorship as the ultimate suppression of the
right to free speech. And it is also true
that Fox News said that the censorship

was "tarnishing" China's image, but
failed to mention anything about the
governmental measure colloquially
known as the "Patriot Act" that exists
in the USA.
Hypocrisy on its own is understandable. After all, it is always easier to
preach than to do. But when it comes to
China the Western world adds a healthy
dose of ignorance. Even though the
phrase "Free Tibet" has become a
cliche, many who utter it are confused
about what Tibet is being "freed" from.
Is the 100% agrarian region that depends
on the Communist Party for 90% of its
government expenditures going to survive in the 21st century without China?
It would be like removing the life support system from a comatose patient.
It seems that there is fear associated
with China's ascent as a global power.
This feeling presumably stems from the
fact that a wholly undemocratic process
has led to such unprecedented success.
It is not a stretch to suggest that the
media likes to poke holes in the image
of China even though the Western portrait has just as many defects, simply
because China is so different. In criticism, then, we try to point China
towards the "right" path.
Yet that brings us to the question of
how necessary it really is to follow the
democratic models of today. The
Communist Party, for all its perceived
faults, commenced relief efforts following the Sichuan Province earthquake
that killed 7000 in May immediately
after the disaster. The Chengdu (City)
Military Area Command dispatched
50,000 troops and armed police to provide relief on the same day. What the
government did not do was endure several days of democratic wrangling
before sending in FEMA.
China has carved out its own niche.
It is able to achieve success because the
totalitarian state gets things done.
Admittedly it is annoying to have
Youtube blocked for two months after
Free Tibet (what else?) campaigns
appear on the site, but it is not nearly as
annoying as being forced to take a
detour due to indefinite road work. The
fact is that the line between freedom
and restriction is a blurry one
for
example, Peaslee Debate Society's
introductory debate highlighted the
conundrum of restricting hate speech,
which is still free speech. China has its
share of ethical concerns, but so does
every other country. Give it time, and
perhaps it may direct itself to the
"right" path.

But for the moment, China is still
growing as a nation. Whatever the criticisms of the Communist Party, it still

facilitated the evolution of a country
that had tens of millions starving just
twenty years ago into the global super
power it is today. And that is something

that does not need an asterisk.

'Graduate' contentious
Cult classics aren't merely film, but how the audience acts.
I am a firm believer in feminist film analysis, but also in the power of fans to use media in
complicated and unintuitive ways, and frankly, I'm a little surprised at the lack of confidence
Joel Swanson shows in the Swarthmore student body when he suggests that The Graduate
(Mike Nichols, 1967) should no longer be shown during orientationbecause of its problematic
politics.
The cult-like atmosphere of "The Graduate" as shown at Swarthmore takes much of the
film's message out of the hands of the original producers and places it squarely with the
ers, whose deafening applause and catcalls threaten to completely overpower the dialogue. I
would guess that for first-time "Graduate" viewers, much of the film's plot, on which Swanson
bases his analysis, was difficult to make out this year, so quiet was the audio, and so obscured
was the video as students jumped from their seats to block the screen.
Masculine leanings of the American New Wave aside, Swanson should know that a film
itself is only part of any film viewing experience. Taken outside their original context, films
take on lives of their own, and the Swarthmore "cult classic," "The Graduate," is no exception.

Diana Pozo 'O9

'Graduate' is a reflection on the annual return to Swarthmore.
In response to "'Graduate' misrepresentative of Swarthmore's values" published in "The
Phoenix" on September 4, 2008...
I don't think the tradition of screening "The Graduate" on the eve of the first day ofclass
is as much an endorsement of "sexual violence" and "stalking" as it is an opportunity for people to reflect on their return (or arrival) to Swarthmore. What attracts students from all
years to this event isn't solely the content or reputation of the film, but rather the occasion
to meet up with the friends one hasn't seen for months or, in the case of freshmen, to bond
with their hall mates and make new friends. "The Graduate" begins hours before Dustin
Hoffman picks up his suitcase from baggage claim. Calling your friends, hunting for seats,
acknowledging that it really would have been a good idea to show up 15 minutes earlier after
all this is all part of the annual tradition.
With moving in, purchasing textbooks, choosing classes and meeting new people, the few
days before classes are incredibly hectic. I find something very relaxing and head-clearing
about gathering in the same place, at the same time, to watch the same film every year.
During the film, I recall the uncertainty and nervousness about college life and academics I
had as a freshman. I remember, as a sophomore, feeling prepared and eager to resume my
social life at Swarthmore. I think back to what I've experienced and the people I've met in
these wild times sandwiched between screenings of "The Graduate," and by the end of the
film, I'm ready for another year at Swarthmore.
Bradley T. Fong 'lO

Swansons critique of 'Graduate' misses the satire, relevance.
As an aspiring humorist, I feel the need to respond to Joel Swanson's criticisms of "The
Graduate." Joel condemns protagonist Benjamin Braddock's actions (as portrayed by Dustin
Hoffman) as "illegal and immoral." This, I would argue, is precisely the point of the film.
Benjamin's worldview is defined by his sheltered upbringing and education, and he is emotionally unequipped to handle any kind of human interaction beyond superficial conversation. This is made evident repeatedly through the film: as he fumbles though a party of
acquaintances arbitrarily branded as friends; as he unknowingly torments Mrs. Robinson
(Anne Bancroft) with misguided attempts at small talk about her (miserable, dysfunctional)
home life; as he is able neither to accept Mrs. Robinson's sexual advances nor to refuse them,
and instead allows himself to be coaxed and manipulated into the affair rather than taking
responsibility for his own actions, etc. Benjamin's utterly inept courtship of Elaine (and
Elaine's passive, mildly annoyed response to Benjamin's unrepentant stalking) demonstrates
both characters' emotional immaturity. I think that the final shot of the film, as Ben and
Elaine giddily jump onto a bus together and then sit in horrified silence as they realize the
implications of their choice (as "Sounds of Silence" plays on the soundtrack) makes this fairly explicit. I agree with Joel that Benjamin's actions are inappropriate, but disagree strongly his claim that the film uncritically endorses them. The film's satire of passivity, hypocrisy
and above all the despised social awkwardness is, I believe, entirely relevant to the
Swarthmore community.
I had planned a similarresponse defending Amy Chozick's presumably ironic condemnation of Barack Obama's totally hot bod; however a quick online search confirmed that, inconceivably and asininely, her article on Obama's skinniness as a campaign liability was not
intended as satire. Also, I would like to note that upon typing "Is Obama..." into Google, the
search engine offered "...the Antichrist?" as a popular conclusion to my incomplete query.
This is a question I believe we would all do well to ponder. God bless America.

Below are the platforms for the Fall 2008 Student Council

thankful for. We

Voting will take place online from Thursday, September 11th
through Saturday, September 13th. Voting in Sharpies will
take place at dinner on Sunday, September 14th, and at both
lunch and diunner on Monday, September 15th.
Augusta Christensen ’ll
My name is Augusta Christensen,
and I am a sophomore transfer student
looking to get involved in the
Swarthmore community during my first
year by running in the special election
for Campus Life Representative. My
unique experience as not only a new student, but a student that has seen how
another college operates, would be
extremely helpful in enacting tangible
changes on campus.
As a resident of Willets, I feel strongly about the security of our dorms. A
universal swipe card would make it
unnecessary for people to prop open
doors. As we all know, it is not at all difficult for an intruder to force his way
into the building because of outdated
and ineffective locks. Since this is an

important issue that affects all
Swarthmore students, I will do everything I can as Campus Life Representative to improve the safety of our dorms.
We all get accustomed to the inconveniences of campus life the restrictive dining hours, the
coin-operated washers and dryers, and the lack of key-coded doors but we shouldn’t have to.
As a candidate for Campus Life Representative, I can bring to the Student Council a fresh perspective and some new ideas for old problems. I start my second year of college believing that
some of Swarthmore’s policies require change and will work tirelessly towards fulfilling this
aim.
If you want your voice to be heard, vote for me, Augusta Christensen, in this special election.

Kate Goertzen 'O9
I work in groups with ease and
enjoy bringing
events
to
the
Swarthmore community. I've gathered
a great deal of publicity, and planning
experience as co-director of the Kitao
Gallery board, as a member and now
co-director of the Sexual Health
Counselors, and as a member of the
Student Health Advisory Council (if
you have ideas for or concerns about
Worth, talk to me)!
Last summer I worked for the AIDS
Institute in Washington, D.C., where I
pushed for responsible policy change,
created outreach materials, and
helped organize the annual conference
for health organizations in the D.C.
area. Thus I am comfortable with publicity, event planning, and problem
solving strategies on and off campus.
I also realize how important it is for
Swarthmore to reach outside the "bubble." I enthusiastically take part in the Philadelphia art, music, and theater scenes, and have a
lot of ideas for sponsored trips off campus. I'm doing thesis research in Philly and Chester, so I
am likely to find activities "off the beaten path" that Swatties would be interested in.
I think it's important for Swatties to take advantage of the opportunities in surrounding communities and to give back to these areas. I would love to help connect you with these opportunities. To start this process, I'd like to provide more college sponsored transportation to nearby attractions using student input to determine popular spots and an appropriate schedule.
This position has added importance due to the privilege of serving on the Dean's Advisory
Council. I feel that my extensive experience in outreach, planning, and group efforts has prepared me for this challenge.
I'm approachable, organized, responsible, and a great communicator, and I look forward to
serving you in this capacity. I'm ready to listen to your voiced concerns and to push for appropriate changes.

happy,
congenial
atmosphere. The college and its adminisgenerally
tration
treats us fairly, and

we all should be
excited that we’re
students here.
That being said, I
believe that there are
certain issues that
need to be addressed
to positively improve
our college experiences. As Campus Life Representative, I will listen to and amplify your
concerns and raise issues that I believe are adversely affecting the student body. If elected, I will focus on improving amenities, providing better access to internships, jobs, and alumni networking, and generating a
greater deal of unity on campus.

Swarthmore has one of the highest college endowments per student in
the country. There is no excuse for the lackluster quality of campus food,
restroom facilities and their maintenance, and laundry services. Though
the food in Sharpies and Tarble is prepared with great care, I think many
of us find the menu (frankly) rather boring, and in dire need of revamping.

Structural maintenance in the bathrooms in many of the older dorms
is being neglected. In fact, if you ever find yourself in the men's room of
Wharton AB Ist, you will see a sign reading, "This urinal is old, the pipes
are old, please be gentle." I think it's important that we don't risk a major
flood / hygiene hazard when using the restroom.
Finally, laundry machines are more or less costly and ineffective. I will
ensure that these matters are dealt with.
As a senior, I'm finding it extremely difficult to network and find jobs
through the college network. Employers at prestigious law firms, investment banks, consulting firms, and corporations are seldom seen recruiting on campus.
Additionally, the use of alumni resources is not a simple process, and
I find myself doing most of the networking legwork that alumni offices in
comparable institutions would do. Given the current economic environment, I believe that this situation has to change for us to be successful in
thereal world.
Lastly, I feel that the campus is more fragmented than I would like. I
would support campus bonding by organizing more social events that are
appealing to a larger fraction of the student body. I believe that a greater
degree of unity would foster a happier atmosphere.
In conclusion, Swarthmore students do a lot for Swarthmore College.
We're all hardworking, we all overachieve, and most importantly we
maintain the reputation of this institution.
I think it's time that the deans and the administration started doing

more for students, and as campus life representative, I will make them do
so to the best of my abilities.
To the deans I say: ask not what we, the students, can do for
Swarthmore, but ask what Swarthmore can do for us.

The Swarthmore women's volleyball team
improved its record to 1-5 after a weekend journey to
the Colby Invitational in Maine. They found their first
victory of the season in a five-set thrill ride against
Bates College, and a rare taste of not only highly competitive teams outside of the Centennial Conference,
but also of Maine's famous seafood.

On Friday, the volleyball team flew into
Manchester, New Hampshire to begin a journey that
would take them by van through Freeport, Maine,
home of L.L. Bean to Colby College. There, Swarthmore
defeated Bates 21-25, 25-23, 22-25, 29-27, 15-12 in a gritty
two-hour-plus match and split sets with the host college, Colby, 25-19, 25-22, 26-28, 25-16. The excursion to

24th-ranked Swarthmore Men's Soccer improved to 20-1 with an impressive 5-1 victory over St. Mary's College
of Maryland last Sunday afternoon. Although the game
was postponed for a day due to inclement weather, the
domination of the Seahawks was inevitable
delayed.

The Garnet aggressively took advantage of numerous
in the game and a player in white
tracked down almost every loose ball, prompting a frustrated St. Mary's supporter to yell, "C'mon blue, pick up
the pace!" The plea went unheard, however, and within a
few minutes, Swarthmore had netted its first goal.
The goal came in the 35th minute when Dylan Langley
'lO sent a strategic pass to his brother, Morgan Langley
'IL The latter looped the ball over the opposing goalie
before it bounced into the back of the net. Referencing
the stellar play of the Langleys, teammate Brett
McLarney 'l2 said, "The Honolulu Connection is a dominant force on the field." Thanks to the brothers' skillful
maneuver, Swarthmore entered halftime with a 1-0
opportunities early

advantage.

The Garnet began the second half with increased confidence by controlling possession and imposing its will
on St. Mary's defense. Christopher Szeto 'O9 had an
opportunity early in the second half when, in the 46th
minute, he juked a St. Mary's defender and fired a curving shot just over the near corner of the crossbar. A
minute later Swarthmore had another chance at a goal
when Morgan Langley sent a cross into the middle where
Evan Nesterack 'O9 nearly headed the ball into the net.
With all of these plays in the box, it was inevitable
that a Seahawk defender would commit a mistake, and in
the 48th minute a defender pushed Morgan Langley to
the turf during a goal-scoring opportunity. Tobias Resch
'll converted the penalty kick to put the Garnet up 2-0
and open the floodgates. Four minutes later, Ladule Lako
Lo Sarah 'O9 capitalized on a bouncing corner kick to
score the Garnet's third goal.
Frustration began to set in for the Seahawks, and as
their first goal-scoring opportunity of the game resulted
in the ball rolling out of bounds, a St. Mary's player took
down a Garnet defender and received a yellow card.
After the foul, physical contact between the two teams
intensified, and so did Swarthmore's goal scoring. In the
59th minute Nesterak received a beautiful cross from Lo

Sarah and finished it for his team-leading third goal of
the season.
At this point, Swarthmore Coach Eric Wagner began
clear the bench, putting in players such as crowdfavorite Omari Faakye 10. The Garnet continued to
pressure offensively and in the 68th minute Jason
Thorpe 'O9 unleashed a strike from 30 yards out into the
upper left corner of the net to put the Garnet up 5-0. Five
minutes later Wagner substituted out his goalie, Zach
Weimer 10, to a big hand from the crowd. Weimer has yet
to allow a goal this season.

"The Honolulu Connection is a
dominant force on the field."
Brett McLarney 'l2
St. Mary's denied the Garnet keepers a blank sheet in
the 78th minute when Seahawk midfielder Matt Grady
headed a cross over the outstretched arms of replacement goalie David D'Annunzio 'l2.
After the little black pieces of rubber on the artificial
turf had settled, the Garnet had outshot the Seahawks 23
to 5. Nesterak attributed the prolific offense to recent
practices in which the team worked on passes designed
to penetrate defenses.
Coach Wagner applauded his team on the victory, noting that his players finished their chances "very well"—
maybe even the best they ever have. After seven of his
players graduated last year, Wagner knew the team
would be different, with the freshman bringing "new
energy." "This team has a special character," he said,
"and we are still developing it; it is definitely a skillful
team." Even so, Wagner said he did not think the rest of
the season would be easy. "We have our hands full with
a very difficult schedule," he said. Also, he noted that
with a national ranking, everyone in the country knows
about Swarthmore now and will come to the field prepared.

Nesterak was optimistic about the prospects of this
year's team. "If we keep our mindset right, we can go
places," he said. The men's soccer team will certainly be
traveling because the next four games are on the road.
The next home match is on Wednesday the 24th against
Arcadia.

Maine would also take them to Bowdoin College on
Sunday where Swarthmore split sets 19-25, 25-16, 25-16,
25-17 and continued their series of challenging matches
that would prepare them for Conference matches.
Kearney Bangs 'lO was named All-Tournament,
posting 71 assists and 24 digs through the tournament.
She continued to play impressively against Bowdoin,
posting 96 assists for the entire weekend. Jen Wang 'O9
recorded 43 kills during the Colby tournament.
The first-years have adjusted well to the college
level, coming through at crucial moments to put
Swarthmore ahead in many sets. Their performance is
even more impressive because the volleyball team has
only eight members this year, providing extra pressure
for newcomers to perform and to be fit enough to play
the majority of a match.
"I have to give credit to the freshmen on the team.
They are a huge part of our team and each person plays
a big role on the team. They practice hard and work
hard and inspire the upperclassmen to do the same,"

Wang said.
Given how well the team has played, the team's size
does not seem to be much of a problem.
"The team dynamic is a lot stronger...we are definitely in better shape to play five-set matches compared to some other teams because we don't really get
a break in practice," said Sarah Lambert 11, also
adding that the Maine trip was a great way to get to
know each other better. Erin Heaney 'O9 also mentioned how close-knit their team had become, but cautioned that each member had to pay special attention
to health and fitness.
Coach Harleigh Chwastyk commented that the team
is the best she has ever coached "on ball control on
defense and serve receiving," partly because the smallness of the team allowed players to recognize each
other's tendencies and subtleties. Chwastyk also complimented the team on its smart offense and its ability
to place balls where their opponent's revealed holes.
However, the team is not only small in numbers,
but also in size. Graduating their tallest players last
year, the team is lacking a true middle blocker. Still,
Wang said she believes that the absence of these key
players has motivated the team to work harder on
defense.

"We are a really scrappy team and it is hard and
frustrating for the other team because they can't hit
the ball down as much as they would like," she said. In
the Bates victory in particular, the team fought hard
through many long points where Swarthmore would
outlast the opponents to end up with the point.
Looking ahead, the Swarthmore women have developed goals for how they would like their season to
unfold. One particular goal was attained this weekend
when Swarthmore, for the first time this season, won
its first set of a match. A quick look at the other goals
will show you that they are not only highly competitive
volleyball players, but great athletes and balanced students. The women hope to finish above .500, make conference playoffs, build a large fan base, beat Haverford,
finish top three in the conference in sets, digs, and
service aces, and to have no regrets.
According to Chwastyk, "Doing the best that they
can and leaving their best on the court" was the most
important thing.
The team's busy season continues with Moravian
College at 7 p.m. this Wednesday and the Garnet
Classic tournament this weekend. Also look forward to
the first Centennial Conference match against Bryn
Mawr on Sept. 24th.

Changes in drug testing a burden for DIII athletes

HANNAH PURKEY
Purkey Perspective
There have been plenty of embarrassing
moments in the sports world. Take, for
instance, Diana Ross missing her ceremonious penalty kick as part of the disastrously
gaudy 1994 World Cup opening ceremonies.
Or take Steve Smith scoring the winning
goal in game seven of the 1986 conference
finals... for the other team. Oh, and who can
forget the infamous 1982 Cal-Stanford football game where the band rushed the field to
celebrate Stanford's victory a little too early,
allowing Cal to score a last second touchdown and win the game.
What could I possibly imagine to be the
embarrassing moment to top all those?
Something so traumatizing it need not
involve anything more than a cup, a bathroom stall and a complete stranger. That is,
being asked for a urine sample for a drug
test and being unable to perform. It's a lot
...

of pressure. Too much pressure. Stories of
athletes taking hours while teammates wait
on the bus can make the most unabashed
athletes worry.
Unfortunately for Din student-athletes
like me, this embarrassing moment could
become a lot more common. Every year student-athletes at Swarthmore and elsewhere
are asked to sign a series of documents that
give the NCAA permission to drug test. As
fall athletes already know, though, this year
the forms are a little different.
Students were asked to sign a drug testing permission for a new pilot program for
DIQ schools. The pilot program, in its second
year of administration, includes 120 schools.
At each up to 16-20 student-athletes can be
randomly drug tested at any point in the
year. NCAA is looking not only for performance enhancing drugs like steroids but also
social ones such as marijuana. Although
Swarthmore is not participating in the pilot,
the program if adopted at the close of 2009
would mean that the NCAA could test any
DIE athlete at anytime during the year in
season as well as out. This marks a notable
departure from the previous policy for DIE
schools, which only made athletes eligible to
be tested if their team qualified for the

NCAA championships.
Nowadays, when one hears "BALCO" as
often as "batting average" and no accomplishment of athletic prowess is able to
escape suspicion, steroid use has become a
reality at every level ofathletic competition.
It may thus seem like the time to widen the

net of testing.

However, the drug testing policy outlined
by the new pilot program is not the needed
response to the drug use problems of DEI

athletes. It reaches into the lives of DEI students far beyond where the NCAA should be
allowed.
This new policy for Din athletes resembles more the policies followed by DI and DH
schools, where testing is not limited to inseason athletes and that teams can be tested
anytime throughout the season. However, it
is important to note the fundamental differences between sports at the DI and DIE levels. By choosing to participate in a DI program, student athletes at those schools agree
to have much more of their lives determined
by their commitment to their athletic team
and thus allow a larger part of their lives to
be regulated by the NCAA. Dm athletes, on
the other hand, come to school with the idea
that although they must be committed first
to their team during the season, while out of
the season athletics can take a backseat to
other activities, thus making the studentathlete just another student. The NCAA has
numerous rules that restrict the amount of
time Din students can practice in theoff-season specifically because Din sports are not
supposed to be year round programs. Yearround drug testing of student athletes who
did not sign up for a year round athletic
commitment seems to go against the very
guidelines the NCAA has set up for Dm programs and is an unnecessary invasion of
students privacy.
Testing like this has further effects on
athletes at schools like Swarthmore.
Athletic Director Adam Hertz points out

that there are both benefits and drawbacks

to the new system, but one of these drawbacks is the effect it has on separating out
athletes. "This is just another way to further
segregate student-athletes from the rest of

the student body," Hertz said. My biggest
fear if this pilot program becomes national
is the effects it will have at schools like
Swarthmore. Here, students' participation
in sports is usually not a priority, and I fear
that they will simply not participate if the
NCAA tries to control too much of students
life with year round drug tests, which test
both for steroid use and recreational drug
use. In the 2005 NCAA Study of Substance
Use Habits of College Student Athletes, a
survey given every four years that helps to
guide the NCAA drug testing procedures,
showed that even without year round drug
testing, the number of students who said
they used drugs to increase athletic performance was fairly similar to DI and DII
programs, which have year-round drug testing.

The survey did show however that recreational drug use by DEI athletes was significantly higher than in other divisions, but
that "very few state they use social drugs to
improve athletic performance." Students
participating in Dm sports are more likely
to use social drugs, such as marijuana,
which they will no longer be able to do if the
new program is set into effect. I hope that
this will not affect the numbers of students
who participate in sports here or other DEI
institutions, but schools have to recognize
the possibility that it might.
As a student-athlete I am very wary of
this new program. It is comforting to know
that the administration is "not completely
convinced that this is the best approach," as
Hertz said, but I hope that these doubts of
both students and administrators are
expressed and that the NCAA takes note
before making this pilot program national.

tuann Cignavitch played in the Swarthmore Invitational last weekend.
On Saturday, Sept. 6 and Sunday, Sept. 7 the women's tennis team participated in
the Swarthmore Invitational tournament as part of their fall training. In preparation
for the spring season, Garnet tennis players were matched against players from Johns
Hopkins, University of Delaware, and Haverford in round-robin tournament play. Both
the singles players and doubles pairs made a strong showing, especially against
Division I competitors Johns Hopkins and University of Delaware.
Team member Marissa Lee 'O9 was optimistic about the upcoming varsity season,
acknowledging thatthe invitational pitted her teammates against stiff competitors who
would "probably be the toughest players all season." The team will continue to tune-up
throughout its unofficial fall season, next competing at the Franklin & Marshall
Invitational on Sept. 19.
