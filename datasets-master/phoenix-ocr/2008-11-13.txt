Status of proposed inn remains uncertain
BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

Representatives from Swarthmore's administration

met with members of a planning committee to discuss the

proposed inn on Nov. 11 The focus was on plans for moving forward in light of the current financial conditions,
said Stu Hain, vice president for facilities and services.
Although Swarthmore has been seriously involved in
the planning of the inn since last May, the recent meeting
was an opportunity for the developers to present a new,
more realistic plan given the state of the economy, Hain
said. "With the economy doing what it did, it's made the
developer back up, slow down a little and think about
what's possible," he said. "We've been working out the
details of the landleases and development agreement, but
the plan they presented last spring may change some as a
result of what's happening in credit markets and the economy in general."
Talks will continue into December, Hain said. "We're
talking more about financing now, and how can we finance
this project," Hain said. "I hate to be so nebulous, but
that's just the way it is. It's still not clear how it's going to
come out. I still think people are pretty certain we're going
to do this, the question is how quickly."
At this point in the process, plans for the inn somewhat
depend on how much state and outside funding the project
can obtain. "It turns out that it's really hard to tell where
we're going to wind up," Hain said. "A part of this depends
on the developer's ability to get some support through the
state, but we don't know what they might get out of that

fund."
Members of the planning group are set to meet again
next Tuesday to hone their financial plans, Hain said. "I
think the team, the developer, the folks from Swat and our
consultants are getting better and better," he said.

"There's just still an awful lot of work to do. We're going to
meet again next Tuesday afternoon, and we'll talk more
about numbers."
Hain said the recent financial crisis has slowed plans
for the inn. "I thought I'd be able to go to the board and the
property committee in December, but we're not there yet,"
he said.

"I hate to be so nebulous, but that's
just the way it is. It's still not clear
how it's going to come out... People
are pretty certain we're going to do
this, the question is how quickly."
Stu Hain
Vice president for facilities
and services
"It's a process that has a lot of unknowns right now. I
think it's taking a lot longer than anyone anticipated at
this point. Once we figure out how it's going to happen it
will go pretty quickly, but I think we're still trying to pin
down a moving target," Hain said.
Taking into account potential setbacks and lengthy
approval processes, Hain estimated that work on the inn
will start in a little over a year. "IfI had to guess, I think
we're talking about starting in 14-20 months from now," he
said. "That seems awfully long from now, but that's what
it's going to take, assuming that all the approval processes
work reasonably well."

On campus, student members of the Swarthmore
Labor Action Project have already started a campaign to
ensure that future employees of the inn will have fair
working conditions.
"We want to make sure that workers at the inn have
the choice to form a union or not," Alexa Malishchak 'O9
said. "This summer I worked for a union representing
hotel workers, and I saw firsthand how empowering a
union in the workplace could be for employees. I thought
it was a great idea to approach the administration
about."
SLAP organized a panel with hotel workers last
Monday to raise awareness on campus. "Monday's panel
was an awareness event to talk about the conditions that
can exist in hotels," SLAP member Erin Heaney 'O9 said.
"We don't think that the Swarthmore Inn will offer bad
jobs, we just want people to be aware of what happens in
the hotel industry and what the differences of working in
a democratic workplace are versus working in an environment where you're not allowed to speak up or organize democratically."
Heaney said the administration has been very responsive to SLAP's concerns so far. "The administration has
been fabulous. They've indicated that they plan to have
good quality jobs," she said. "In the next few weeks we're
going to speak with members of the administration about
our specific requests, and we feel very optimistic about
their cooperation. We're looking forward to beginning
the conversation."
Hain said he is in contact with students from SLAP
and is aware of their concerns. "I have a meeting with
some of the students from SLAP next week," Hain
said."We haven't finalized a deal with the hotel developer yet, but I know what SLAP is asking for. I'm in conversation with those students, and I will continue to be
in conversation with those students."

SLAP advocates unionizing rights for future inn workers
BY JONATHAN EMONT

jemontl@swarthmore.edu

As the Swarthmore administration continues to deliberate plans for a future
Swarthmore Inn, student activists are
mobilizing to make sure that in case the
inn becomes a reality, inn employees will
have the opportunity to unionize. The new
Swarthmore Labor Action Project has initiated discussions with the administration
to ensure that a neutrality agreement will
be a component of inn policy. A neutrality
agreement is a legal document that would
obligate the inn developer to work with
and recognize an inn worker union.
In order to drum up support on campus
for the neutrality agreement, SLAP, in
coordination with Class Awareness Month,
hosted a hotel workers panel in Bond Hall
on Monday night. This event was the first
one planned by SLAP to address the issue.
The event began with an introduction
by SLAP member Alexa Malishchak 'O9.
She said SLAP convened the panel because
"we wanted to talk about what work in the
hotel industry can be like." While waiting
for the two panelists, who were delayed,
Malishchak discussed the likelihood of the
proposed hotel being built and what she
called the "necessity" that the hotel workers are given the right to unionize.
"Organizing workers," she said, "can be a
very effective mechanism for ensuring
workers' rights."
SLAP organizers intended for the panel
to contrast the working conditions of
unionized hotel workers with their nonunionized counterparts. The first hotel
worker to arrive was a woman operating
under the pseudonym Maria. The organizers were worried that if her employers
became aware that Maria was campaign-

THE PHOENIX

ing for workers' rights, she would face
harassment from them. Maria spoke for
over fifteen minutes about the struggles
she faced on the job, the intimidation and
arbitrary treatment she was subjected to
and the ways her employers managed to
quash attempts by workers to organize a
union.
Speaking with the aid of a translator,
Maria gave a short narrative about her
daily life at the hotel. She then responded
to questions posed by Malishchak, and a
few minutes later, by members of the audience. When asked why the workers weren't
able to start up a union, she said, "Workers
listen to everything you say about unions,
then take it back to management because
they know that's how they can get a raise."

"If we're going to have a
say, we have to speak
up now."
Alexa Malishchak 'O9
As Maria was finishing speaking, Lebe,
a Togo native and labor organizer, joined
the panel. Lebe discussed her attempts to
secure a job as an immigrant in the United
States and described her work as a unionized worker at the Hampton Inn. While she
was careful to make clear how much she
felt unions protected workers, contrasting
her unionized job at the Hampton Inn
favorably with her earlier, non-unionized
one at Popeyes, Lebe focused primarily on
describing the management's attempts to
derail the Hampton Inn workers' union.
"Even with the union contract they can

still get you," Lebe said. "One day I was off
from work they hired these six West
Africans who they convinced to sign pieces
of paper saying they didn't want a union."
Lebe confronted her employer and ultimately left the Hampton Inn. Now, she
works as a labor union organizer for the
Hotel Workers of America. Lebe believes
that unions are necessary for granting
workers reasonable wages, job security
and vacation days.
SLAP is engaging in efforts to allow
Swarthmore's hotel workers to organize
despite the fact that arrangements made
for the construction of the hotel are not at
all definite. When asked whether their
efforts could be considered premature,
Malishchak said, "The administration is
going to make the decision [on the inn] by
February. If we're going to have a say, we
have to speak up now."
SLAP member Megan Long 'l2 said,
"We see the contract negotiations as the
perfect time to bring up this discussion."
Both Long and Malishchak also emphasized that SLAP's efforts to ensure that
workers can unionize in the future are in
no way interfering with their autonomy.
"We are not organizing any workers.
We are merely guaranteeing them the right
to organize," Malishchak said. Both she
and Long resented the charge that SLAP's
efforts could be seen as patronizing.
No groups on campus have publicly
opposed SLAP's campaign so far. In fact,
their efforts have met with widespread
support on campus. According to
Malishchak, eight student groups have
endorsed SLAP's current campaign,
although she said that she didn't have the
right to identify the groups at the time of
the interview. While SLAP is clearly
behind current efforts, White Women

November 13, 2008

Confronting Racism and the Womyn of
Color Collective, two Swarthmore coalitions, have signed onto SLAP's efforts.

Malishchak was confident that the administration would be amenable to the campaign's concerns. "Fm sitting down formally with the administration next week,"
Malishchak
"Knowing
said.
that
Swarthmore has been very responsive to
student concerns in the past, I would say
that I am hopeful an arrangement will be
reached."
SLAP's activities are not limited to the
hotel campaign. SLAP member Loretta
Gary 'O9 described the organization as a
multi-pronged operation that has effectively utilized a "divide-and-conquer strategy"
to cover a lot of ground, delegating different teams to tackle a variety of campaigns
aimed at improving the quality of workers'
occupational environments.
According to Gary, "SLAP has been
really effective in generating discussions
with workers about how we can help them
achieve their goals." SLAP is currently
working with mushroom farmers in nearby Kennett Square
the self-proclaimed
"mushroom capital of the world"
in
their efforts to unionize. Since much of the
workers' campaign literature was originally written in Spanish, Swarthmore students have stepped up to translate the pamphlets into English and increase the campaign's visibility to potential donors interested in backing the workers financially.
Gary has also began work on a documentary on the intimidation tactics that
can often deter workers from pursuing
unionization. According to Gary, the different projects all share the common objective of standing up for the rights of labor
workers and promoting a respectful workplace."

Alum mobilizes community
in opposing Proposition 8

HIS WEEK IN PICTURES

Proposition 8, the California ballot initiative that would define marriage as a union

between a man and a woman, was passed on
Tuesday, November 4 by almost 500,000 votes:
a margin of four percent. The measure was
passed despite the vigorous efforts of many
some of them
California residents
who campaigned in
Swarthmore alumni
opposition to the measure. Vincent Jones '96
was heavily involved in the campaign to
defeat the ballot initiative in California, both
as a member of the Jordan/Rustin coalition, a
fundraiser for Love Honor Cherish and as an
independent activist. Although his efforts
failed to sway a sufficient number of voters,
Jones is not ready to concede defeat just yet
and urges thosestudents dissatisfied with the
election's outcome to protest Proposition 8.
Jones' campaign strategy hinged on mobilizing California's African-American community, which he recognized as an influential
constituency in the election and one that had
been overlooked by other vocal opponents of
Proposition 8. "I realized that the black community would be swing voters and that the
campaign [against Proposition 8] hadn't targeted them enough," Jones said. He correctly
predicted high turnout among black voters, a
statistic he attributed partially to the candidacy of Barack Obama.
Through his blog, www.whoiscitizenjones.blogspot.com, Jones circulated video
clips of African-Americans speaking out
against Proposition 8. In one clip, an elderly
black woman identified as Aretha described
herself as being "raised in the heartof the Jim
Crow South" and denounced discrimination
against the queer community. Joined on
screen by her daughter and granddaughters,
the family appealed to all voters, but especially African-Americans. "It's unfair and wrong
to write discriminationinto the constitution,"
her youngest granddaughter said. In another
clip, entitled "No Matter Who You Are Vote
No Against Proposition 8," a number of
African-Americans, who identify themselves
one by one as a veteran, a man of faith, a
lawyer, a marketing professional, a VicePresident of a Fortune 500 company, and a
parent, urge the viewer to vote no on
Proposition 8.

""As a minority I was happy
that Obama won but as a
queer person I still had that
feeling of being a second
class citizen."
Brigette Buquez 'll
...

According to Jones, those who campaigned for Proposition 8 realized that voters
didn't like the idea of taking rights away from
California citizens, as the campaign against
the proposition had put it, so they "changed
the debate." This angle included some false
information spread by some proponents of the

ballot measure.
Noting that some voters were under the
impression that churches would lose their
tax-exempt status if they refused to perform
same-sex marriage, and that schools would be
forced to teach young children about samesex marriage, Jones said "unfortunately, you
don't always have to be fully accurate in cam-

November 13, 2008

paigning." Because of this, some of his work
consisted of correcting these mistaken beliefs.
After the passing of Proposition 8, the campaign against it is gearing up for a new fight.
"Now the strategy is to challenge it in court
that it's not a constitutionalamendment but a
—

constitutional revision, which has a different
process for ratification," Jones said. The campaign argues that the proposed amendment,
which defines marriage as a union between a
man and a woman, is actually a revision

because it would change the original inter-

pretation of the constitution by the state
Supreme Court, which decided that the right
for a person to marry any other person was
implied by

the document.

"People have to know that
their vote has an effect on
people's lives."
Vincent Jones '96
Activist against passage
of Proposition 8
As many Swarthmore students were cele-

brating the election of Barack Obama on
November 4, others were still anxiously
awaiting the fate of Proposition 8. "I was really concerned about it," Linnet Davis-Stermitz
'l2 said. "They called [the election] for Obama
at 11 when the polls closed in California, but I
was checking for the results on Prop 8 for a
couple hours afterwards."
Brigette Buquez 11 said she was torn by

the election's mixed results.
"As a minority I was happy that Obama
won the election, but as a queer person I still
had that feeling of being a second class citizen," Buquez said.
Asked what Swarthmore students who are
interested in fighting for same-sex marriage
can do, Jones mentioned a couple of ways to
make a difference. On Saturday, Nov. 15, he
will join other opponents of the initiative in a
nationwide "Prop. 8 Protest" directed at the
California measure and similar initiatives
that Were passed in Florida, Arizona and
Arkansas.
Jones specifically criticized Arkansas'
Initiative 1, which will make illegal the adoption of children by unmarried "sexual partners." While this initiative applies to both
same-sex and opposite-sex couples, it effectively bars homosexual couples from adopting children, as these couples cannot marry
in Arkansas. Information on the protest is
available at www.jointheimpact.com
queer
Additionally,
urged
Jones
Swarthmore students to talk to their friends
and family. "People have to know that their
vote has an effect on people's lives," he said.
He also called for straight people who support
gay marriage to talk to their straight friends
who oppose it, because "straight people can
have a different conversation with other
straight people than they would with a gay
person."

Adrianna Massi 'l2 said that she "sees the
passage of these regressive ballot initiatives
as an affront to the constitutional rights ofall
Americans, not just the queer community.
"This is a civil rights issue. For me as a queer
person, this isn't a queer issue, it's a simple
issue of the 14th amendment: full federal protection of citizens," Massi said. "At the same
time, this is what you get when you legislate
from the bench."

Dining Services seeks campus input at forum
Despite numerous complaints, few students who attend offer dining suggestions
Both Eric Brown 'O9 and Elizabeth Crampton 'O9 asked
about the Styrofoam products that can be found in both
Tarble and Sharpies. The panelists defended their decision
to use these products and made small concessions. Ruhri,
the head of Essie Mae's, said that the cups in the snack bar
are the most biodegradable low-cost option. McDougall said
that the Styrofoam bowls in Sharpies on Ice Cream Bar
nights are there to make up for the fact that the dining hall
does not have enough bowls. Her only solution was to move
them next to the regular bowls so that students would consciously have to choose between the two types of bowls.
Larimore suggested that a group of students collect stolen
flatware and dishware from dorms in order to alleviate this

BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu
Sharpies and Tarble are common nouns in the
Swarthmore student vernacular that can be easily used as
meeting locations or the subjects of a complaint. But few
students truly know what sort of work makes these dining
institutions run, both on a day-to-day basis and in the longterm. Last Thursday, Student Council hosted the Dining
Services Panel to allow members of the community to learn
about and inquire into the quotidian details of Dining
Services and provide input for future changes. The panel
featured Dining Services Director Linda McDougall, Vice
President of Facilities Stu Hain and Dean of Students Jim
Larimore, and StuCo Appointments Chair Nate Erskine 'lO
served as moderator. Roughly 20 students, including
Student Council members and reporters, attended the

meeting.
The panelists initially fielded Erskine's questions about
the basic decisions that Dining Services administrators

problem.

-

make. Erskine first asked how the board money students
pay each year as part of their college fee is spent.
Responding to the question, Hain explained that a variety
of costs must be covered each year in order to keep the dining hall and snack bars running: food costs, staff salaries,
utilities, maintenance, air conditioning and administration. He then estimated that only about 30 percent of board
fees goes to food; another 30 percent goes to staff salaries
and the remainder covers administrative and physical
maintenance costs. Each year, an average of $15,000 goes to
replacing "missing" dishware and flatware.
Next, Erskine asked the panel to lead the students
through the process they picked to choose the food that
goes on the menu each day. Although staff expertise and
food costs do go into consideration, the largest factors are
student input and student responses. "We can look at
what's popular and not popular," McDougall said, citing
the fact that on Pasta Bar nights, students go through somewhere between 110 and 120 pounds of pasta, while on other
evenings there are lots of leftovers.
The panelists briefly addressed the scare that happened
last year when Dining Services considered eliminating
packaged goods from Essie Mae's snack bar. This option
went into deliberation not only because of the cost of packaged goods, but also due to the storage problem they created. "[Augustine Ruhri] had a really nice office and now it's
a storage room," McDougall said. Although Essie Mae's
offers a diminishing variety of packaged goods, they have
not yet been eliminated altogether. The panel members
avoided mentioning whether the switch to this previously
proposed change would take place in the near future, but
they continued to stress that student input was the driving
force behind their decisions. A change would not take place
without first taking into consideration student voices.

"My job is to make you guys happy.
Sometimes there's a perception
that Dining Services won't give you
what you want... We ask students
all the time for suggestions."
Linda McDougall
Dining Services Director
But some factors must be taken as a given. Is the college
going to build another dining hall any time soon? Not likely. "We've considered the dining hall a center for community," Larimore said.
Some students attended the panel to learn more about
the inner workings of Dining Services. "I'm interested in
learning more about why Dining Services works the way it
does and starting a dialogue about making reasonable
changes," Becky Wright 'll said.
However, three out of the four studentswho asked questions during the panel were concerned specifically with
sustainability, and asked questions related to environmentally responsible consumption rather than changes to food

Larimore's comment showed a theme that ran throughout the evening much of what goes on in dining services
doesn't have to be a mystery. In fact, the panel members
sounded eager to hear student input and make changes to
the services and food options they provide. "[The panelists]
said they got most of their suggestions through the napkin

board and emails. I now know that I can use that for a
forum, and I will be telling other people that as well,"
Crampton said.
Crampton, a Green Advisor and member of Earthlust,
attended the panel with a sustainability agenda. "I was
really encouraged that a lot of the student questions at the
forum were about sustainability in Sharpies," she said.
"What I took away from that night is that if students want
something they should just ask for it."
Some students, such as Amalia FekTl2, are doing just
a sustainabilithat. Feld, who attended the panel,
ty consultant to Dining Services. One of her.first projects

'MINUS

was Local Food Night, for which she put together a food
labeling system and a map depicting the sources of the food
items available.
The only questions specifically about food were generated by the moderator.

"[The panelists] said they got most
of their suggestions through the
napkin board and e-mails. I now
know that I can use that for a forum,
and I will be telling other people."

Elizabeth Crampton 'O9

"I was a little disappointed. In order to be effective and
make changes we need feedback from our customers. In
addition to the low student turn out we also experienced a
low number of responses from the survey student council
emailed to the student body," McDougall said in an e-mail.
For McDougall, student input and assistance is key to the

Alumni Council expands connections with students
BY DYLON CHOW

Barrington

the

Last weekend, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 9,
alumni returned to their alma mater to
attend classes, talk to current students and
reconnect with the campus they once
called home at this semester's Alumni
Council meeting. Council members, some
of whom graduated as far back as 1955 and
others as recently as 2008, convene on campus twice a year to foster communication
between past and present Swarthmore students.
Around 50 alumni and 100 students networked at one of the weekend's major
events last Saturday, an alumni/student
dinner in Upper Tarble. According to
Assistant Director of Alumni Relations
Jennifer Barrington, the dinner brings students and alumni together for two purposes: one social, the other advisory.
According to Barrington, "It's a time to sit
back and have a conversation" in a setting
that is conducive to career-oriented networking. Each of the seventeen tables was
decked out in paraphernalia pertaining to
a different career field, ranging from arts
to business to healthcare to higher education. "Alums act as career mentors,"

internship programs that do not compensate them.The alumni present at the meeting addressed the possibility of starting a

potential careers."
Other popular events included the
alumni/student mixers, where students
considering certain majors could speak to
alumni with professional experience in
those fields. Another was a lecture by
Professor of Biology, Amy Vollmer, and
Associate Professor of Astronomy, Eric
Jensen, called "Astrobiology: Are We
Alone?" which discussed the origins oflife
on Earth and the likelihood of the origin of
life elsewhere in the universe. Many fondly referred to it afterward as "the E.T. lec-

fund for these students.
The IC representatives also discussed
extracurricular projects to which they
devote substantial time during the academic year and asked the alumni whether they
would be amenable to supporting these
activities with a similar fund. Deivid Rojas
'll, one of the representatives, mentioned
that it was inconvenient to arrange transportation between campus and Kennett
Square, where some IC members are
involved in service projects.
"Sometimes we have to borrow the van
from the Lang Center," Rojas said.
According to Rojas, it is not always possible to find volunteers to drive IC members
to volunteer sites in Chester or
Philadelphia, but he said that providing
the IC with its own vehicle would eliminate
this problem. "We talked about the idea
that the IC should have its own van," he
said. According to Rojas, the Alumni
Council was very receptive to the suggestion and is considering creating a fund for
an IC van.
Current IC members also discussed the
activities of recently launched student

dchowl@swarthmore.edu

said,

adding

that

alumni/student dinner gives students the
opportunity to "learn first-hand about

ture."
Alumni belonging to the Student
Support committee also had the opportunity to connect to current students by discussing various ways they could help the
student body with funding and support. On
Saturday, these alumni spoke with three
members of the Intercultural Center. At
the meeting, the IC representatives raised
the issue that unpaid internships and
externships impose a financial hardship on
students who rely heavily on paying jobs.
Financial constraints deter many students
from participating in externship and

organizations with which most alumni are
not familiar. Cecilia Marquez 'll, one of the
founders of the Swarthmore Womyn of
Color Collective, spoke to the group about
the organization's efforts to empower
women of color. "I enjoyed talking [with
the alumni] about how we think we could
be supported," Marquez said, adding that
the alumni discussion was very productive
and she would welcome more opportunities for dialogue with former students.
"They're not prescribing, just asking,"
Marquez said of the discussion's tone.
Alumni said that they are making a concerted effort to make the community of former students more accessible to current
ones in an online forum. Currently, alumni
can contact each other through the
Swarthmore College Online Community, a
service restricted to alumni. Albert Kim '93
and Matthew Armstead 'OB are building
upon this idea to enhance opportunities for

communication between alumni and cur-

rent students in online venues.
Rojas said he appreciated the Alumni
Council's efforts to engage more directly
with the student body. "I didn'tknow about
[the Alumni Council] before
[but] they
are really concerned about being more
accessible to students," Rojas said.

Financial aid petition response appreciated, but students seek more
BY CLARISSA SKINNER
cskinnl@swarthmore.edu

Students for Financial Justice recently petitioned for
in deciding how aid packages are
granted. The students are campaigning for a more personoriented appeals process, for an earlier postmark date on
students' financial aid packages, and for allotting a percentage of outside scholarships to the family contribution. Five
hundred and forty-five students signed the petition, as well
as several student groups and faculty members. Director of
Financial Aid Laura Talbot issued a response to the concerns expressed in the petition. SFJ and the administration
have since established a dialogue and are discussing concerns related to financial aid.
Students expressed gratitude for the response. Student
Groups Advisor Chris Green 'O9 said, "The Financial Aid
Office's response to the petition was really great because it
shows that they are interested. They took the time to find the
petition, to look it up, to read it and to write a long, thoughtful document to explain their response." However, Green
also said, "The response didn't really address the concerns.
It was more of an explanation of what the Financial Aid
Office already does. Students don't need to know what the
Financial Aid Office does, but want to change what it does."
To try and remedy financial aid issues that students are
concerned about, SFJ has continued discussion with the
administration. Writer of the petition Candice Nguyen 11
said, "On Monday, three members of SFJ met with Dean
Bach and Laura Talbot. Both were very receptive and congreater transparency

cerned."

According to the parties concerned, dialogue between
students and administrators is necessary for change.
"Administrators have been at Swarthmore for a long time.
They've seen more and know more of the background of the
college than students, and it's important to listen to that
voice," Green said.
Further, discussions with administrators have helped
SFJ refine and consolidate its goals. "SFJ has evolved over
time. It began with a vague dissatisfaction or a vague feeling
ofanger, which developed into solutions we'dlike to offer as
ways to change," Green said. "As we've discussed more,
thought more, interacted with the administration, each time
we come together we have a greater understanding of what
we want to happen."
In addition to students, several groups signed the petition. Many groups on campus have expressed financial aid
concerns that relate specifically to their members, including
the Swarthmore African-American Student Society, the
International Club and the Swarthmore Queer Union.
Eva McKend 11 of SASSsaid, "Disproportionately across
America, students ofcolor are affected by the issue offinancial aid."
McKend described an incident that occurred during
Discovery Weekend: "A prospective student said that he was
looking forward to coming to Swarthmore and that his mom
had encouraged him to apply because they didn't have a lot
of money, and Swarthmore has a large endowment. Some
members started to laugh, but didn't say anything. Many of
us haven't benefited."
According to McKend, a lower percentage ofblack people
across the country apply to college than do those of other

racial groups. Thus, members of SASS do not want to jeopardize the possibility of more black students coming to
Swarthmore. McKend said, "We can't dissuade them from
applying, but we're lying to them at the same time."
McKend pointed out the irony of this when she said,
"Swarthmore is advocating for diversity, but not really trying to keep black students here."
She expressed the perception of a number of black students on campus when she said, "There are other colleges
that bend over backwards to get black students. It feels
almost if Swarthmore doesn't want us here."
Another group that enhances diversity on campus is the
international students.
International students have also expressed concern about
financial aid, specifically taking issue with the fact that
admissions for these students is not need blind. Many other
colleges, according to Co-President of i2O Michael Xu 11,
have adopted need-blind admissions for international students, including Amherst, Williams, Harvard, Yale and
Dartmouth.
"I think what really matters is admission [that] is needblind to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, and that
itself shows inequality. It's discrimination against national
origin and nationality," Xu said. If an international student
cannot pay tuition, the possible courses of action that student can take are limited. "International students don't have
the option to transfer, because it's almost impossible [for
international students]," Xu said. "It's really unrealistic to
tell us to go home."
In addition to students of color and international students, queer students also face problems in relation to financial aid.
A representative of SQU who wished to remain anonymous said in an e-mail, "Many of the policies directly impact
queer students
for example, current FAO policies don't
support you if your family decides to disown you due to coming out as queer to them. They still consider your parent contribution as part of your demonstrated assets. For many
queer students, financial aid policies (among other factors,
of course) force closeting in fear of the financial repercussions, which is a general trend, both in and out of
Swarthmore."
Many of these groups hope that a continued discourse
with the administration can result in remedies for these
problems. However, advocates recognize that these issues
need long-term solutions, and could take many years before
being instituted. However, many students express their continued support of the initiative.
As Nguyen said, "I was told that changes will not happen
during my stay at Swarthmore. However, that should not
stop students from pushing for change."
"You can't go to a school and be in fear. If you feel that
something is wrong, you should speak out," McKend said.

Spoken word group iLL-Literacy treats issues of class, race, gender and sexuality in a performance

Speaking out against injustice
BY APOLLINE BERTY
abertyl@swarthmore. edu

The Spoken Word event hosted by Class
Awareness Month and the Swarthmore Asian
Organization (SAO) revved up Swarthmore
College's OldeClub Friday night withprose, humor
and activist zeal. The four-member band iLLLiteracy joined forces with the Hi-Lifes for their
Natural Electricity tour, ending Nov. 15 at Syracuse.
They were introduced by two Swarthmore performers, Tayarisha Poe "12 and Eva McKend 11,followed
by Bryn Mawr's trio, 3X.A.LADY.
Poe started off the event with "I'm writing you a
request for some face time," a provocative poem
about Internet communication and addiction that
elicited a spout of laughter from the audience. "I
thought Tayarisha and Eva were amazing," Xiaoxia
Zhuang 'lO, a member ofSAO and one of the organizers for the event, said. "I really commendthem for
being brave enough to stand solo on a stage [...] and
for them both to be opening themselves up like
that."
Following Poe's introduction, McKend took the
stage and was immediately met with roaring
applause from the Olde Club crowd. McKend performed two pieces the first addressing the present financial aid issues assailing Swarthmore students and the second entitled "Gentrification," a
poem she had written for and performed at last
semester's New Orleans Rhythm N Motion concert.
Worried that her work was starting to lose quality and originality, McKend had decided that she
would take a break from performing this semester
but felt thatthis event was too important to miss. "I
performed specifically for Class Awareness Month,"
she said. "The first piece especially, that was my
whole purpose. There is a real financial injustice
that is going on at these top liberal arts colleges."
Drawing from figures and personal experience, she
presented what she believed to be the financial
injustice currently occurring at Swarthmore, which
prevented her friends and almost herselffrom coming back to school. Following McKend were Shayna
Israel, Menda Franchise-Francois and Nikki Lopez,
whose band names are SITY (Should I tell you),
Fr@nchise and D.J. Nikk, respectively. Together,
they are 3X.A.LADY.
"Very quickly I have to do this first, cause I was
really excited," D.J. Nikk said as she showed the
crowd her Obama t-shirt and spoke of her excite-

8

ment at his election. She then performed a tribute to
Luis Ramirez, a Mexican immigrant who was beaten to death by three boys aged 17 and 18 in
Schuylkill County. The poem was received with

awed silence and some tears as Lopez told
Ramirez's story in a voice quivering with emotion.
The event lightened up, however, as the performance went on, and 3X.A.LADYmoved on to hip-hop,
engaging in conversation with the audience after
playing the wrong track. They ended with their
song Womyn Heads High" before handing the stage
off to iLL-Literacy and the Hi-Lifes.
"We're a spoken word arts collective but we
recently graduated to a full-on music set and
there are a couple folks that say we don't really
do spoken word anymore, so tonight we thought
we'd present some spoken word for that ass,"
Dahlak said before parodying spoken word with
band-member Adriel, who dramatically accompanied him on the drum. Olde Club shook with
laughter as Dahlak dramatically flayed his arms
while talking of the origins of the English language dictated by that old white man named God.
When the piece came to the segment on words
that were not recommended, Dahlak and Nico
did an impressive coordinated bleeping of curse
words.
The humor continued with a "fuck you list,"
read from hand-made scrolls by Dahlak, Nico,
Adriel and Ruby, the four iLL-Literacy members.
The list said "fuck you" to issues such as racism,
people like Carlos Mencia, people are who happy
at 5 a.m. and those who made Vitamin Water.
"And fuck myself for not having anything more
constructive to say than 'fuck everybody else,'"
Nico said, ending the piece.
Ruby said she preferred the intimacy of Olde
Club to venues at other colleges where the group
had performed. "I just felt like I could feel everybody here and that's what matters in a show, is
really being able to feel the audience vibe with
you," she said after the show.
"I think they bring an awareness to issues
that aren't really represented and Class
Awareness Month brings about the same issues,"
Zhuang said of the night's spoken word artists.
"With Class Awareness Month, it's not just about
class, it's about race, gender, sexuality. So, I
think that iLL-Literacy really fits in perfect with
that because these are the issues that they are
very invested in."

time for such girls is
they'll pass
short
their prime before
early-to-mid
their
twenties, save for some
notorious supermodels
like Kate Moss and
Naomi Campbell. With
few exceptions, youth
is glorified and, similarly, those captured
on film for street fash-

these things in common: they're young and they like to party.
But take a closer look at what that red-lipsticked girl smoking a cigarette on The Facehunter is wearing. Why, isn't that Grandma Rhoda's
canary yellow Golden-Girls-esque pantsuit? Or what about all of those
slouchy grandpa cardigans? Or that lovely Florida retirement home
floral print dress? From the looks of things, street fashion around the

world seems to be diverging in two directions. There are those who
take the futuristic approach, with ensembles comprised of metallic
skinny jeans, stiletto gladiator heels and some sort of intricate top, and
then there are those taking fashion cues from their grandparents.
Instead of dressing like twenty-something-year-olds, they mix in elements of traditionally dowdy and mumsy clothing. Intersecting with
"geek chic," accessories such as the giant oversized glasses that the
elderly need to drive, lace-up oxford walking shoes and leather briefcase satchels are now being reproduced by stores like Urban Outfitters
and H&M. Marketed as vintage-inspired, they sell just about as well as
the vintage originals up for auction on eßay, which is to say: like hot
cakes. Though such a way of dress seems to ignore all the tenets of
what we'd known as style
like fit and cut, material and design
these fashions are as popular as they've ever been.
So I guess I shouldn't have been that surprised when street fashion
photos of the elderly started popping up on various blogs such as Style
Bubble, Painfully Hip and Liebemarlene Vintage. At first I thought it was
just a coincidence, but then I realized that all their photos came from one
source: Advanced Style, a street-styleblog capturing the looks of the "wizened and silver-haired set." The site has only been around for a few
months, but it already has over 120,000 page views thanks to word of
mouth. Instead of seeing style as a fixed entity associated with youthful
beauty, the blog's trio of (young) writers set out to prove that style comes
in all different forms. As for the younger set, style for the elderly is just as
much about attitude as it is about looks, proving the wise saying "it's not
what you wear, it's how you wear it."
But what about those who are simply unaware that what they are
wearing has any relevance to current fashion, who fail to recognize that
the way they dress is in fact very hip and cool? While this is refreshing in
that it avoids pretension and the dreaded trying-too-hard affliction, does
the lack of fashion consciousness mean a lack of style? Over fall break, I
was looking through old family photo albums and was shocked to see how
"hip" my parents were in college. Honestly, you could have given them a
couple of fixes and they would have been dead ringers for any hipster
walking the streets of Williamsburg today. When I asked them about their
clothes, my dad just shrugged and said those were just the clothes that he
happened to have and that he didn't really think about it too much. He
was certainly surprised, and a little pleased, when I told him that people
our age actually dress like that now. My mom seemed a little more conscious of what she wore, but said that clothes were always secondary to
essentials like food, due to money, and that because of this she made a
lot of her own clothes. So is style based on one's own perceptions, or is
it dependent on what others perceive? I don't think I can fully answer
that question, except to say that it's probably an intersection ofboth, but
I will note that it is pretty amusing how styles and trends are recycled
from one generation to the next.
With the exception of The Sartorialist, few street-style blogs feature
older people, and I don't know of any beside Advanced Style that focus
solely on such an age group. After looking at blog post after blog post of
doe-eyed, skinny-legged girls, it's nice to see something a little different,
something a little more organic and unassuming. It does make me wonder, though, if style is something that not only stays with a person, but
also gets better with time.

Cinematic obsession with vampires has deep roots
Vampires

have been enjoy-

since before the

of
Bram Stoker's
"Dracula," but in
years
recent
vampire lore has
undergone
a
surge in popularity thatshows no
signs of subsiding. Interest in
vampires spiked
in 1997 when a

mediocre movie
called "Bufly the

ALEX ISRAEL

Pencils Down,
Pass the Remote

Vampire Slayer"

became the nowclassic TV teen
drama of the
same
name.
"Buffy"
gave
teenagers iden-

tifiable charac-

ters and a complex mythology, but the series' most important cultural contribution may have been David
Boreanaz's Angel, a vampire heartthrob so delicious that
he was given his own TV series. Vampire frenzy recently
reached fever pitch with Stephanie Meyer's vampire
romance novel "Twilight" and its three sequels, each

more hotly anticipated than the last. Although the last
novel, "Breaking Dawn," was considered disappointing by
many critics and fans, the buzz that surrounds this winter's release of a "Twilight" movie hasn't diminished in
the slightest. It looks like Angel might have to fight the
film's resident bloodsucker Edward (Robert Pattinson) to
retain his throne as supremely sexy vampire-candy.
If you ask me, however, both Edward and Angel should
be bracing themselves for a fight with Bill Compton
(Stephen Moyer), the enigmatic vampire at the heart of
HBO's newest original series, "True Blood." Bill is part
Southern gentleman (the show is set in the fictional town
of Bon Temps, Louisiana, where the Civil War is still
called The War of Northern Aggression), part out-of-control predator and all angsty sexuality. I dare you not to
smile at the adorable way Bill (who was "turned" just
after the war and thus still speaks like the characters in
"Gone With the Wind") asks a girl's permission to "call"
on her at her home, then turns around and viciously
destroys her would-be murderers with the ferocity of a
natural disaster. Bill is attractive because he is mysterious; his near-translucent skin and unfailing politeness
hide a vicious nature with which he is constantly in conflict.
Attraction to mystery is brilliantly (and, this being
HBO, steamily) showcased in Bill's relationship with the
show's sassy Southern protagonist, waitress and mind
reader Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin). Sookie's cheery
and slightly oblivious facade masks an unwanted ability
to hear other people's thoughts (once again, this being
HBO, most people are thinking about sex). Paquin, in a
charming and utterly believable performance, shows
Sookie's frustration with her so-called "gift" as she strug-

gles not to listen to the inner dialogues of the other characters, including her boss Sam, (Sam Trammell) and her
best friend Tara, a character who could have been just
another angry-black-woman cliche were it not for the
feisty, scene-stealing performance of Rutina Wesley.
When Sookie meets Bill, she is attracted to him both
because his vampirism marks him as even more of an outsider than she is and because he is the one man she's met
whose thoughts she can't read. Sookie's attraction proves
stronger than the warnings of her friends, and at the end
of the pilot episode she steps in to save him from the
hands of a vicious white-trash couple who had planned on
draining him of his blood, vampire blood being a highly
sought-after drug known on the show as "V."
It is really the strength of the Bill-Sookie coupling that
holds the show together, as several of the more peripheral
plot elements occasionally threaten the storytelling. The
most distracting subplot is one involving Sookie's brother
Jason (Ryan Kwanten), a womanizer with rock-hard abs

and empty space in his skull. Another distraction is the
show's element of social commentary: vampires are presented as a group of outsiders whose struggles are meant
to parallel those of the homosexual community, with evangelical preachers referring to theirkind as "ungodly" and
prejudiced Southerners wanting them segregated from the
rest of the community. When these two subplots are
pushed aside, however, the show returns to being a soapy,
enthralling tale based around two intriguing characters
and the love they share for each other. Ultimately, it is
Sookie's and Bill's humanity (albeit, in his case, a conflicted humanity) that holds the show together.

Hamada installation brings harmony to List
BY AMBER WANTMAN

awantmal@swarthmore.edu

Brainteaser for all you Swarthmore
geniuses (for their own safety, non-geniuses
are encouraged to cease reading immediately): what do a space capsule, an igloo and a
life preserver have in common? "Elementary,
Wantman," you say with a matter-of-fact tone
and half-smile (for you have just made a
"funny"). "Why, those objects are all currentlyresiding in theList Gallery" Negatory, you
fool! That was no space capsule you saw in
the List Gallery, but an authentic Hiroyuki
Hamada! Hiroyuki Hamada's new exhibit
which will both excite and confuse you
houses several sculptures, including three
familiar objects resembling an igloo, a life
preserver and a space capsule, but are actually far from being so. As Andrea Packard,
the director of the List Gallery, points out,
"these objects are not stage props. Hamada's
sculptures are not illusions of something in
the actual world, but things that cause us to

contemplate states of being."
Why do these sculptures inspire such contemplation? Perhaps because their initial
resemblance to familiar objects is illusory,
and upon closer inspection we notice conflicting characteristics, characteristics that
oppose eachother so fundamentally as to create oxymoronic art. Hamada's sculptures are
simultaneously weathered and worn, yet
shaped with perfect symmetry and engraved
with ritualistic care. One piece in particular,
#5l, made of enamel, oil, plaster, tar and wax,
is particularly deceptive. From afar, we see
the smooth outline of a perfect ellipse. Up
close, however, we notice clear imperfections
such as gashes and what almost look like bite
marks on piano keys. What's more, once
we're a few feet from the piece, we discover
that the brown mass of tar is no longer an
ellipse, but a rounded object with rippled
edges
merely a victim of the passage of
eons. The paradox that arises between a timeworn yet harmonious appearance provokes
the viewer. We are left wondering how these

dual characteristics

symmetry and asym-

metry, perfection and imperfection

work

together to create beauty.

Tania Alvarez 'O9, an art history major,
describes how the engraved surfaces monopolize her attention, distracting her from the
overall shape of the piece, making unnecessary the discussion of whether these figures
are real-world objects or not. "Hamada's
sculptures
asked me to slow down and
closely examine their surfaces," Alvarez said.
"I soon found myself interlocked with the
piece meditating on the elaborately worked
surface against its smooth and plain counterpart. Hamada's pieces create such a memorably peaceful interaction that for me, any
references to reality seem superfluous."
Hamada himself compares the use of dual
characteristics to create beauty in art with
the use of multiple tones to produce harmony
in music. "Just as music uses certain combinations of sounds to have effects on our emotion, in visual art, people use visual cues
effectively to create main themes, backgrounds, rhythms and so on. Here, two different visual cues can be put together in cohesive ways to present tension and/or drama in
the work," Hamada said.
"The duality also comes from my making
process perhaps ... Most of the time, the basic
shapes or the ideas that get to be the 3D
objects are fairly pristine, balanced looking. I
would say that might be the part that gives
the idea of 'near-perfect.' But from then on,
the pieces get the layers that can be described
as distressed.'" The 'uistressed" look is similar in theory but different in realization.
Hamada produces a worn and weathered
look by overlaying wooden structures with
plaster and burlap, then shaping and staining
them with resin, paint and wax. The process
requires two or more years' time, and so we
can safely say that the result looks more
frayed
authentic than your faux
Abercrombies (even if you did pay $89.90).
Distress is one characteristic that differentiates Hamada's art from objects we have
experienced before. For this reason, Packard
points out, "They resist exact description or
language." Interesting that she chose the

word "language," because the absence of language culture, and social processes in art are
key to Hamada's vision. "I grew up in a different country with a different language, a
different value system, a different social
structure and so on. So when I found out that
there are ways to communicate through
paintings and sculptures without referring to
our cultural, socialbackgrounds, it really hit
me hard. I just think it's plain weirdand wonderful at the same time to be able to say
things visually. I can't seem to get over the
fun in exploring the possibilities in it and
also it's such a good feeling to come up with
some common grounds for us to go beyond
our differences, and all that without shooting
at each other!" said Hamada.
Upon hearing his response, Packard
admired Hamada's nobility and affirmed his
13, 2008

declaration, saying, "His work represents
universal truth rather than [truth] specific to
one culture or environment."
Having been asked the same question,
List Gallery intern Yuan Liu 'O9 interprets
Hamada's vision in much the same way the
artist expressed it himself: "I know that the
idea of a universal visual language is important in Hamada's work," Liu said. "After
coming to the US from Japan at age 18,
Hamada found himself experiencing a wide
culture and language gap. As an Asian immigrant artist myself, I understand the power of
visual communicationwhen language fails in
expression."

Hamada's art remains on display in LPAC
until Dec. 14.Liu will be hosting a talk on the
artist from 2 to 3 p.m. on Dec. 10 at the List
Gallery.

pop
out

BY JON PETERS
jpetersl@swarthmore.edu

This weekend, Jessie Bear 'O9

will bring her playwriting thesis
to life on the Frear Theater stage
with "Pop Out." With a cast of
Bear
characters,
complex
explores some of the dilemmas
that result when occupational
ambitions interfere with already
strained personal relationships.
'Top Out" considers the genderrelated hurdles that women
encounter in both their personal
and professional lives.
And so it goes: Jenny, a physician specializing in obstetrics
and gynecology, is already the
designated breadwinner in a
relationship with job-averse
Dennis. And now she's trying to
land a much sought-after promotion at the hospital where she
regularly toils. Phyllis, a ghost
from Jenny's medical school
days, is the only thing standing
between her and the job.
Meanwhile, Dolly, a college
student, is struggling to tell her
boyfriend that they will never be
able to have children because
she is reproductively challenged.
Moving nicely between plots and
ideas, Bear's script effectively
synthesizes multiple stories into

a coherent whole.
While each character's story
remains Unique, the intertwin-

10

ing narratives are all driven by
dilemmas.
gender-based
According to Bear, "The play is
heavily influenced by my own
musings on gendered power relations."
Commenting on the strained

relationship between the highpowered Jenny and her underachieving companion, Dennis,
Bear said that these two characters "struggle with finding satisfaction [while] there's clearly
great tension bubbling under the
surface." Dolly's character is,
impressively, just as well developed, despite her less prominent
role in the production. In Dolly's
brief scenes, she overcomes her
with
the
disappointment
prospect of a childless existence
and emerges from this coping
process a stronger person.
Bear is only the second student to complete a playwriting
and
the
Theater
thesis,
Department sought out a professional director, Lisa Jo Epstein,
to coordinate the performance.
Bear said she was humbled by
the experience of working with a
professional like Epstein, who

has accumulated extensive directorial credentials in her capacity
as artistic director of the Gas
Electric Arts Theater Company.
"It's such a privilege to work
with a professional director. It's
crazy to get that experience as an
&

undergraduate playwright who's
never had anything produced
until this show."

Under Epstein's direction, the
players became intimately familiar with their characters. Isa St.
Clair 'IL who plays multiple
characters in the play, stressed

of interpersonal
dynamics. "For this play in parthe
relationships
ticular,

importance

between the characters are crucial to the play's structure, so
Lisa Jo introduced some great
exercises to build these relationships," St. Clair said.
For Judy Browngoehl 'O9,
who is also juggling multiple
roles in the production, these
exercises have been infinitely
valuable to helping her polish
her performance. "Sitting across
from someone and having to
communicate with only a few
gestures
raising a hand, turning a head, crossing the legs
[you see] how these small movements can sometimes convey
more than language can,"
Browngoehl said.
Ben Hattem 'l2, who plays all
of the male characters in the production, said that the small cast
of characters has become very
close-knit. "It's a very ensembley show. A small cast leads to a lot
of bonding," Hattem said. He also
noted that the male characters

roles in Bear's play, deviating
from the standard theatrical
model of male-dominated narratives. "Sometimes I feel played

off of, but it's not a bad thing.
Plays are generally male-heavy."
According to Bear, the current version of the play has

"Even in September, the play
looked quite different from what
it will look like on Friday" Bear

said. Admitting that she "initially set out to write a lighter play,"
Bear did not anticipate that "Pop

But now that it has, the
show's cast is confident that
Bear's hard work has paid off
with a final product that
explores the troubled intersection of gender, work and love.
"Jessie is basically brilliant, and
it's a joy to work on this piece of
hers," St. Clair said.

Beyond the scale: alternatives to numerical thinness
swarthmorephoenix.com

C3P

clothing eliminates external standards that
don't apply to you
whatever size that
model is, she is not you and you are not
her. Your jeans, however, are yours, and if
you once looked how you like looking in

TAMAR LERER
Everybody Eats
Why do so many of us want to be thin?
I know it might sound like a stupid question, but I don't think it's one we ask often
enough. Yes, a lot of it comes from external
images of what is considered attractive.
But that is not enough of an explanation on

its own. What does this "attractiveness"
mean, what is the point of it, why is it so
important? The answer, for many, is that
we equate attractiveness with personal
worth.
I'm sure that any of you would tell your
best friend that what determines her value
is not how much the scale says she weighs,
but her compassion, intellect, sense of
humor, and fabulous collection of hats
with ears. In fact, you'd tell her, those
things make her truly beautiful. I'd bet,
however, that you'd be less willing to turn
that standard back around on yourself. In
lieu of other tangible, concrete measures
of self-worth, many of us turn to the scale
or to the label on our pants. It's not just
that society tells us that a lower number
means we're more attractive, we feel that
it is telling us that it means we're more

valuable.

Today, I'm going to suggest two better
and more tangible measures of you as a
person. While my hope is that we will all
come to accept
ourdare I say love
selves for the indefinable, subjective facets
of our personalities that truly make us
who we are, for now I will suggest healthier, more productive, and ultimately more
positive ways to measure yourself. The
numbers we obsess over are just a very
imperfect proxy for things that matter

more.

How your clothing fits
is so much more
important than what
size your clothing is or
what size you are.
How your clothing fits is so much more
important than what size your clothing is
or what size you are. More than that, the
fit of your clothing tells you much more
about your weight gain or loss than obsessing over what those digits mean. The average woman's weight fluctuates up to seven
pounds throughout the day. The three
pounds you're obsessing about are meaningless. What is meaningful is the way the
waist of your jeans fits compared to how
they used to. Measuring yourself by your

12

them, use that as the standard for how you
want to look again. It's at once concrete
and personal, like all weight-management
programs should be.
So stop squeezing yourself into clothing
that is too small for you, either because you
actively want to fit into a smaller size or
because you can't give up on your old
favorite skirt. Whether or not you are
ready to accept that your hips are actually
incredibly attractive, you'll have to accept
that they look better when they're not
spilling over the waistband of your pants.
You can see if you fit into something the
way you should
it is tangible. If you can
replace your desire to be an arbitrarily designated size with a desire to find flattering
cuts, colors that complement your knockout eyes and styles that highlight your
assets, you will feel more beautiful and
take a lot of unhealthy pressure off.

Please, throw your scale away. I know
you, Ms. Scale-In-Her-Roorh, weighing herself at least twice a day (naked, before eating, or maybe after the shower because

you can knock off two pounds from your

wet hair). I was there. It is an obsession
that will not only eventually drive you

insane and make you feel worthless, but it
is an obsession that won't tell you as much
about how you look as the fit of your clothing or the new-found height in your leap.
There are scales in Worth and in Mullan,

ing yourself is by the physical gains you've

accomplishments in the physical activity

arena are often correlated with your thinness. Even more importantly, however,
they are correlated with your health. The
best thing that can happen to you on your
weight loss journey is realizing it's not a
weight loss journey at all: it's a health gain
journey. Becoming healthier often involves
becoming thinner, or maintaining a weight

that works for you. But it also involves
having a stronger heart and lungs, more
toned (and incidentally, more attractive in
that halter) muscles, and lower levels of
stress. Focusing on health instead of on
weight takes a lot of the low self-esteem out
of becoming the weight you want to be. It
will also increase the quality of your life,
now and for your (newly extended, lower
cholesterol) future. Focus on being good to
your body, and I can almost guarantee your
body will look better to you.

bit sheepishly.

"Come on!" she

replies.
you are

"Here
in the

Mall of our nation's fine capital, taking in the sights, visiting the monuments. Face it: you're a tourist." With the
collapsing remnants of the Washington Monument looming behind me, I guess I really can't argue with her.
Despite a few minor problems with the (lack of) emotiveness in the character models and some annoying
mechanics, "Fallout 3" (Xbox 360, PS3, PC) is a rich and
elegantly constructed first-person role-playing game
(RPG) and the finest game I have played in 2008.
"War, war never changes," the voice of Ron Perlman
deadpans in the opening of every entry hi the series. As its
name suggests, the essential point of "Fallout" is its setting: the remnants of the United States in the wake of
absolute nuclear holocaust. The incomprehensible cause
of the conflict that led to the bombs dropping is faceless in
every way except for through its consequences on the
vast, well-crafted wasteland you have the opportunity to
explore. Many of the people (those that can still be called
people, anyway) that currently populate the Washington

metropolitan area's own Wasteland are from high-tech
underground complexes called "Vaults," with seals so
powerful that they can take a direct nuclear blast. You
were born in one of these Vaults, number 101, located (as
best I can tell) near Tyson's Corner, VA, and there you
lived for many years, until the day your father mysteriously escapes from the Vault and you follow his trail out

into the Wasteland.
Although the process of character generation is ultimately standard, it is presented through a refreshing
framework wherein you play through snapshots of your
character's life to help determine your attributes, skills
and appearance (though you can later customize all of
these to your heart's content). Bluntly and with an odd
appropriateness rare to the field, the game opens with
your birth, where you mold your character's physical features and first meet your father, whose paternal visage is
crafted to strongly resemble your own, an immersive
touch. You stumble around as a toddler to learn basic
movement, and shoot rad-roaches with your birthday BB
gun to hone your skills at the game's hybrid first-person
shooter/turn-based strategy combat system. Though you
grow up with the antiquated relics of American culture
jukeboxes and birthday cakes
when you step outside
those Vault doors, things, you soon learn, have changed.
The broad theme of the game pits the hopelessness of
the wasteland against the sometimes fleeting successes of
people struggling to survive at any cost. It's not the larger
events that communicate the devastation
It's the little
details that destroy you emotionally. At one point, I pick
up a shortwave radio transmission from a father asking
for help for him and his child, and I start to search around
the area for the source. Eventually, next to a blinking
radio transponder, I find two skeletons, one large and one
small, curled up into each other. They had been dead for
years. The skeletons and other detritus of human life that
you encounter are a stark reminder of the finality of
destruction that no matter how heroic or powerful your
character is, you cannot hope to reverse the nuclear holo-

caust. The static horror that saturates the atmosphere
nevertheless highlights your character as a dynamic
force, either for the revitalization of humanity or for the

furtherance of its ruin. While the designers could have
done more to emphasize the agency of the non-player characters in the game universe, the powerful changes you can
make to the landscape gives you some (perhaps misguided) hope that life can continue after the end of the world.
More so than the other entries in the series by virtue of
its setting in D.C., "Fallout 3" evokes a broad line of questioning strangely thoughtful for a video game, exploring
the most resilient elements of culture and history. The
only individual who is at all interested in actively preserving the past is an Abraham Lincoln fetishist who collects U.S. governmental documents, only to grossly and
perhaps purposefully misunderstand them. You listen to
him ramble about the "first and second Judgmental
Congresses" that sparked the "Civil War against
England," before he asks you to break into the National
Archives to steal the Declaration of Independence, presumably so that he can fake Lincoln's signature onto it
(under what state's banner, I ask). Afterwards, he has you
return to collect Lincoln memorabilia, including a fake
recording ofhis voice and that iconic stovepipe hat. It isn't
history: it's mental masturbation. A tourist, through and

through.
Through the atomic dust and the utter collapse of civilization, it's interesting that the residents of the Capital
Wasteland still turn to the (blindly?) positive, harmless
music of the 'sos for the small comfort in their lives. (I will
interject to say that at times the designers are coyly ironic
in their music selection; Google the songs "Bongo Bongo
Bongo (I Don't Wanna Leave the Congo)" and "I Don't Want
to See the World On Fire.") It's up to you to discover what
other little bits of Americana survive in the Wastes.
I've neglected much in talking about "Fallout 3": its
occasional flaws (why does the nuclear holocaust make
everyone look like plastic?), the exact ins and outs of its
gameplay (try placing a grenade on an unsuspecting
raider), the scope of its world (that, sadly, does not
extend to my own home in Northern Virginia), etc. I can
write with confidence, though, that if you like gaming at
all, the Wasteland will treat you surprisingly well.

Craig Finn, lead singer and guitarist of The Hold Steady, at Philadelphia's Electric
Factory.

Last Saturday night, the Electric
Factory was lit up by the hot, soft light of
the Hold Steady, one of the only true rock
bands alive and kicking in today's music
scene. The venue was hardly packed, as
most ticket-holders were there for indie
Drive-By
southern-rock
ensemble
Truckers. The Hold Steady fans, however,
were easily identifiable. Squished like

THE PHOENIX

sardines at the front of the stage an hour
before the show began, they were a motley crew: middle-aged men and their sons,
bespectacled hipsters, mustachioed and
leather jacket-clad men who'd clearly
been rocking for years, awkward twentysomethings and giggling, flannel-sporting
teenage girls. What did they all have in
common? A palpable and urgent adoration for the honesty, simplicity and musicianship of the band about to take the
stage.

screaming congregation.
Living up to the promise Craig makes in

"Constructive Summer" that the band's
"psalms are sing-along songs," The Hold
Steady seemed to turn music, especially the
experience oflive music, into something of a
religious experience. This was, perhaps, the
most beautiful part of the show: the band's
ability to unite 14 and 41-year-olds and
everyone in between, all of them singing
along to the same words at the top of their
lungs while moving to the beat of the same
music, fists pounding in the air as they
"raise a toast to Saint Joe Strummer."
Charlotte Gaw 'l2, who saw the Hold
Steady for the first time last Saturday night,
felt overwhelmed by the passion that the
band brought to the stage: "I would just say

November 13, 2008

that the energy at the show was really
incredible. It was clear that Craig and the
rest of the band was really excited to be
there, which made it so much better. The
crowd was so into it," she said.
Equally impressive was keyboardist
Franz Nicolay, also of World/Inferno
Friendship Society (who, by the way, Hold
Steady fans, is coming out with a solo album
Jan. 13). The exultant piano in "Stuck
Between Stations" and "Sequestered in
Memphis" complemented Finn's narrative
style and showcased the band's seasoned
musicianship. In true "less talk, more rock"
spirit, Finn spoke to the audience in only a
few instances
once to tell the tale of how
The Hold Steady was formed: a story particularly appropriate for their current tour, as
it was at a Drive-By Truckers show at New
York's Bowery Ballroom in 2002 that Finn
was inspired by the realization that good
music was not, in fact, dead. "I wanted to be
in a band again," Finn said.
As the night closed with "Slapped
Actress," fans nostalgically once again sang
along with Craig's "Whoa-oh-oh's"
only
this time, sans instruments, until the
"Whoa-oh-oh's" became a sort of punk rock
kumbaya that captured the spirit of The
Hold Steady's particular brand of intimate
rock and roll.
At the end of it all, the boys and girls of
America were impressed: "I think the Hold
Steady are the best band in America," Hold
Steady veteran Joel Mittleman 'O9 said.
"After seeing them 10 times now, they only
get better each performance. I thought
they were dead on, maybe the best I've
ever seen them." It was, truly, a massive
night, where every song was right.

The new demography
Obama won

JONATHAN EMONT

the election last

Tuesday by improving on
Kerry's performance in every
measurable demographic. He
•"won a clear majority of the votes
of the poorest Americans, and
won a majority of the votes cast
by the richest (those making
more than $200,000). His numbers were higher than Kerry's
when it came to winning over
Blacks, Whites, Hispanics and
Asians. He won the majority of
Catholic votes, the vast majority
of Jewish votes and did better
among Protestants than Kerry
ever had. Young people went out

in record numbers and voted
in record numbers. A
Political Prisoner
few days after Election Day, a
I New York Times map that
showed the voting trends of
every county in the nation showed an America swamped in blue. Nearly
every county outside of the South had a higher percentage ofits voters voting Democratic than they had in 2004. It was a big win for Obama, and it's
time to take stock.
As good a candidate as Obama turned out to be, most of the credit for
the Obama victory has to go to George Bush's incompetence and, not unrelated, the current economic crisis. However, Obama's ability to appeal to
all demographics and to win the majority of self-declared moderates and
independents
demonstrates that the candidate who ran his campaign on
the theme of national unity has amazing potential to deliver it.
So while the statistics show Obama's approach is working, there is one
caveat I would have Obama, and future Democrats, bear in mind:
Democrats should not compromise the party agenda in order to win over
evangelicals. In the months leading up to the election there were daily
reports of the impending evangelical crack-up; about a newer generation of
evangelicals who cared more about helping the poor and fighting climate
change than they did about winning the war in Iraq.
Obama's campaign clearly believed this. He established numerous
evangelical outreach associations, becoming the first Democrat to do this.
He spoke about hisfaith in God more than any Democratic candidate since
Bryan. And he laid out plans to further dissolve the separation between
church and state by expanding federal funding for faith-based initiatives (a
personal peeve of mine and a calculated attempted at doing away with the
Democratic Party's secular label).
They called this newer generation of evangelicals the "Joshua
Generation," and article after article hailed the possibility of the emergence of an Evangelical Left. It is unclear whether this generation has
already emerged or not. 32 percent of evangelicals aged 18-29 supported
Barack Obama, compared to the 16 percent of the same age and religion
who went for Kerry. This is a significant improvement.
However, overall, only 24 percent of evangelicals went for Obama,
which isn't that much different from the 21 percent who supported Kerry.
So perhaps the younger generation is breaking away from the older evangelicals a little, but I don't see this as evidence that Obama's outreach
efforts to win evangelical votes were especially effective or that evangelicals were placated by Obama's tolerance of a little mixing of church and
state. His success among the younger evangelicals was still very low when
compared to how he fared with younger voters nationally, and it seems
that the younger evangelicals who supported him did so because they have
as young
the same issues with the economy, the planet and the war
people everywhere else do.
So, it wouldbe stupid for Democrats to get into the habit of nominating
atheists, as refreshing as many would find this. But the Democrats should
realize that their most effective appeal to the religious does not involve
religion. It involves using government to fight poverty, to right the sorry
economy and to respond when natural disasters strike.
It involves avoiding needless war and, increasingly, fighting climate
change. It helps win over religious voters when the party has a nominee
who speaks as easily about his faith as Obama does. But it's important to
remember that Obama's opponent was one of the most hated Republicans
in evangelical history, yet Obama won a similar percentage of the evangelical vote as Kerry did when running against Bush.
Younger evangelicals are even more conservative than their elders
when it comes to issues like abortion and capital punishment. This doesn't mean that evangelicals should not be extended an open invitation to
become Democrats, or that, since it's victory, the Democratic Party can
afford to become an exclusive one. It is merely an acknowledgment that
the Democratic Party will never be able to crowd everyone into its tent.
I like having the queer constituency. If that means thatthe Republicans
get the lion's share of the evangelicals, so be it.

Planning on moving to Canada?
Threatening to move to Canada has become, to

many Americans, a political panacea. In 2004, the

Canadian immigration website recorded its highest
ever traffic the day after the presidential election
nearly 200,000 visitors, almost all Americans, flooded the site, seeking information on how to facilitate
a Bush-driven escape from the UnitedStates. Author
and humorist ChristianLander dedicated a chapter
to "threatening to move to Canada" in his book of
American social criticism, "Stuff White People
Like." And while few ultimately act on their professed desires, moving to Canada has become an
automatic rejoinder for members of the losing party
in the American political process.
The reasons for this would-be exodus are as myriad as they are misguided: we (erroneously) compress Canada into a land of progressive, hard-working (if slightly quirky) salt-of-the-earth types who
like individual liberties, socialized medicine and
moose. Theircrime rates are lower, theirpoliticians
less crooked and their citizens more trusting. Even
professional crank Michael Moore likes Canada. It
is, in short, the paradise Americans wish they had
been born into, and the perfect place to threaten to
move to when the going gets tough in the States.
Following the election ofBarack Obama, some of
America's conservatives stopped for a slightly confused pause: would it still be appropriate, as a
Republican, to pick up the Democrats' favorite move
of threatening to move to Canada? No, argued Slate
Magazine, although they helpfully provided a sometimes surprising list of conservative-friendly alternatives: Israel (hawkish), Poland (anti-Communist)
and the Cayman Islands (no taxes) wouldall be adequate homes for red state refugees seeking to weather the Democratic storm.
But that some Americans believe they can escape
political climates that they personal disagree with
by fleeing to a foreign country reflects the overwhelming ignorance that many people in the United
States have about the domestic affairs of the rest of
the world. Or, put another way, we think that the
grass is greener in Canada even though we've never
seen it. The goal of this editorial, therefore, is to
attempt to relieve some of that ignorance, at least in
regards to Canada.
Let's begin with a briefoverview of what Canada
does and doesn't have to offer to the liberal
Democratic crowd.
Unlike many Americans, Canadians have an
aversion to guns. Not only does their constitution
not explicitly protect Canadians' natural right to
bear arms (potentially excluded to avoid miscommunications resulting from the abundance ofactual
bears on Canadian soil), but only 22 percent of
Canadians own guns. In comparison, a 2008 Gallup
poll found that 42 percent of Americans own guns.
More than half of the Republican respondents
reported that they not only own guns, but are satisfied with America's loose gun control regulations.
Clearly Canada is not the place for America's gunslingers.

Stoners, however, should keep their eyes to the
north: whereas America seems to slowly be lumbering towards legalization (with Massachusetts
decriminalizing cannabis possession and Michigan
legalizing medicinal marijuana in 2008 ballot initiatives), Canada has consistently maintained a much
more tolerant perspective. More than half of
Canadian voters in 2008 supported the legalization
of pot. Medicinal marijuana is legal in all ten
provinces (and three territories, although the combined numberof individuals growing medical marijuana in the Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest
Territories is negligible). And Ontario's courts have
made a habit of striking down Canadian substance
control laws. For loadies looking to legally smoke a
joint Canada may be looking more like home; but
for those less inclined towards individual liberty
and recreational drugs, itremains a dubious option.
With the bitter fight over Proposition 8 still rag-

November 13, 2008

ing in California, supporters of same-sex marriage
can take comfort in knowing that, as of 2005, Canada
became the fourth country in the world to grant
equal marital rights to gay and lesbian couples. In
the fiendishly liberal Ontario, same-sex marriage
has been legal since 2003, and the Canadian
Supreme Court granted equal rights to unmarried
same-sex couples in 1999. For liberals looking to
escape the culture wars ofred versus blue America,
or for same-sex couples shunned from city halls
throughout California, Canada seems increasingly
appealing.
The hist of appealing (at least to liberals) practices in Canada could continue in this vein
their
social medical system has a habit of keeping their
citizens alive longer and with lower costs than its
American counterpart, they have two official languages, and so on—butthis isn't the complete story.
There is an unmentionable, darker side to Canada,
one that many knee-jerk would-be expatriates
blithely ignore. Let's explore that side in greater
depth.
While Americans are loathe to hear about financial woes abroad with our domestic problems still
weighing heavily on our minds, Canadian markets
were in dire straits long before the Lehman
Brothers dam burst. The Toronto stock exchange
has fallen 37 percent from its heady high of nearly
15,000 in mid June to a close of 9,424 on Tuesday.
Canadian labor statistics show a loss of over 67,000
this
jobs in the manufacturing sector alone thus
year. Fleeing Americans take note: even though the

American economy has continued to flounder, the
Canadian economy is not in much better shape. And
as America, which buys 75 percent of Canada's
exports, sinks even deeper into a recession, it is
almost certain to take Canada with it.
Considering that most Americans who threaten
to move to Canada are doing so to escape from the
perceived flaws ofAmerican politics, it may be surprising to note that the Canadian government is
even more fractured than its American counterpart's red-blue divide. Canada's parliament is divided between five major parties, with a sixth (the
newly minted Green Party) winning 7 percent of the
popular vote but failing to get any seats. The largest
party, the Conservatives, holds justunder halfof the
seats of parliament, but only won 37.6 percent of the
popular vote. The third largest, the Bloc Quebecois,
holds 50 of the 308 parliamentary seats on a platform
of secessionism, underscoring the growing divide
between Quebec and the rest of Canada. The splintering of Canadian politics runs deep, and has
proven difficult for Prime Minister Stephen Harper
to remedy.

Canadaalso has a strange affinity for the known
carcinogenic compound asbestos. Despite some of
the highest mesothelioma (the cancer associated
with asbestos) rates in the world, the highly effective lobbying of the asbestos industry has made
Quebec's government averse to shutting down the
industry. The Canadian government has been similarly silent on the issue, despite a preponderance of
medical evidence and a precedent set by a majority
of developed and developing nations supporting an

asbestos ban.
As if this weren't enough, The Economist published a report in September detailing the increasing number of bear attacks plaguing outdoorsy
Canadians. With 900,000 black bears and 70,000 grizzlies taking up residence in the woods of Canada,
Americans frustrated by the actions of politicians
they disagree with may want to reevaluate their
options in light of the evisceration risk.
Whatever the credibility of threats of expatriation, the fact remains that a startling number of
Americans are ignorant of the political, social and
ursine challenges faced by our neighbors to the
north. And in many ways, that ignorance is more
offensive than the capriciousness with which we
have come to regard our citizenship.

Obama only won a little over half of the electorate, leaving
some of my right-wing facebook friends posting messages
about moving to Canada. But conservatives gnashing their
teeth over an Obama win don't have The Daily Show, The
Onion, et al. in their arsenal. Therefore, the power of snark

lies in the realm of Obama.) But if this is the case, then it's
only temporary.
Why are we jaded? Ignoring sociopathic ad men who
start pushing Christmas decorations in September, whoever thought up Palin porn, and the demonic rise of Miley
Cyrus, the 'slice n' bake' answer is politicians.
Slice 'n' bake as may be, it is to overstate the role of cynicism in mediating politics with our lives. Why would people watch TV pundits if they didn't feel some sort of disconnect? Hopefully you'd only let someone else think for
you if you didn't really care for what you were supposed to

think about.
Other than the fact that most politicos aren't the greatest of orators is the fact thatthat the whole soliciting-sex-inMinneapolis-restrooms-money-laundering game is a bit
alienating. We orient ourselves via snark towards politics
because if you feel like you don't have any voice in the way
things are run, you might as well blow smoke rings at the
world. And guess what? An ex-smoker is running our country.

Though at first glance, an uncontested, optimistic winner makes for a healthy relationship between the White
House and the public, the prospect of leaving jaded behind
is more than a little jarring. What would politics be without
the cynicism? I get the feeling that a lesser sense of political despair is going to have a hand in bringing about the
apocalypse, and there's not a damn thing any one of us can

do about it; in a weird way the federal government is predicated upon people being: (a) pissed off, or (b) indifferent
towards politics.
And let's not forget the attractions of the whatever, it
doesn't matter, black coffee n' cigarettes mentality, the
slick swift slide toward personal entropy.
There's a certain style, a certain glamour to not giving a
damn, even if it kills us all in the end (if you think I kid,
think about the healthcare system). Beyond the surface of
cynicism is often a lack of engagement, the feeling that you
can't do anything about the way things are.
Cynicism then renders the world livable, through sarcasm, without meaning that you have" to take responsibility for it. But once "that world" is run by someone intent on
fixing the economy, healthcare, education, our two wars,
etc. etc., what do you do?
If all the hip lads and lasses who said that the world
won't listen were of the subset that voted for Senator 0.,
then it appears that the world did listen, if only for a bit.
The chance of an unclouded relationship with power may
just do the trick for not putting up with politicians with
horrible speaking skills and track records.
Hopefully we'll be a little less likely to put up with alienating politicians, if only because the whole —gate" suffix
is getting more than a little stale.

Resolution in the Congo difficult to achieve

JAMES MAO

Over International Borders
Last week saw the passing of one of science fiction's most prolific writers, Michael
Crichton, the author of "Jurassic Park." The
award-winning Crichton gained popularity
for his adventurous storytelling, often cautioning against the perils of scientific experimentation.
In "Congo," for example, his protagonists
pursue diamonds, aided by an intelligent
gorilla, while being stalked by foreign corporations, in addition to murderous gorillas.
Yet even with Crichton's vivid imagining of
death in the forests of Congo, it is sadly possible to find a more alarming vision of the
region: right now, in real life, in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
Since 2004, there has been armed conflict
between the military of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (FARDC) and the insur-

to the region. And if
force in the world
there was a clear-cut side to support in the
name of peace, perhaps these forces would
be effective.
But in a situation where MUNOC has
accused the government of war crimes and
the rebel opposition is at the same time the
most frequent provoker of warfare, what
can the UN do? In 2007, they attempted to
quell Nkunda's authority by integrating
him into the FARDC, which worked beautifully in Nkunda's favor as three brigades of
troops were added to his power.
Nkunda, to some, might be seen as a
sympathetic figure. He is, after all, apparently protecting the minority Tutsi against
the wrath of the Hutu. At the same time, he
has repeatedly violated ceasefires and peace
agreements, most notably the November
2007 agreement which disarmed Rwandan
Hutu militiamen as well as ending
Rwandan government support for Nkunda.
government supported Hutu violence
Most troublesome of all is that he is
clearly the one calling the shots, as eviagainst Tutsi.
In July 2003, a peace was brokered, and denced by his recent statement on Oct. 30
by 2006 the United Nations Mission in the that he would take the eastern region of
Democratic Republic of Congo (MUNOC) Goma if no ceasefire was realized a statement magnified in ridiculousness when you
had facilitated the first democratic elections in the country. At this point Nkunda realize that his forces instigated the viohad already re-ignited violence, claiming lence.

gent force led by Laurent Nkunda of the
National Congress for the Defense of the
People (CNDP) in the Kivu region of Congo.
This battle, however, finds its roots much
further back than 2004.
In 1994, the Rwandan genocide of ethnic
Tutsis by the Hutu militia was halted by
rebel Tutsi. Fleeing Rwanda, millions of
Hutu refugees poured into North and South
Kivu, and promptly began massacring the
local Tutsi minority with the aid of
Congolese Hutu.
Throughout the rest of the '9os the
nation endured the First Congo War and the
beginning of the Second Congo War. Hutu
militia continued raping and killing Tutsis,
while foreign political intrigue rendered
the government mistrusted and ineffectual.
Out of this chaos arrived Nkunda and
the CNDP, who claimed to represent the
protection
of the Tutsi minority.
Meanwhile, accusations abound that the

It's this type of thickheadedness dis-

played by the internationalcommunity that
led to the senseless murder of 5.4 million
people. Both the USA and the African Union
stepped away from the November 2007
peace agreement expecting MUNOC to
enforce all its terms effectively, knowing

that this 17,000-strong force has been in

Congo for nearly a decade now with nothing
but blood to show for it.
Both the EU and the UN declared the
2006 democratic elections to be a success for
Congo, even as Nkunda's forces rampaged
around killing non-Tutsis. As long as these
summit meetings exclude key figures and
display no substance whatsoever, the
Congolese government and the Congolese
rebels will continue to disregard petty mandates and continue the business ofkilling as

usual.
I don't pretend to fully understand the
intricacies of ethnic conflict in a nation I
have never been to. However, I also don't
understand why the worst instance of
bloodshed since Hitler invaded Poland
receives such scarce attention, both in the
media and in the eyes of international powers.
With a little more enforcement and commitment from relevant parties, fruitful
steps could actually be taken towards the
resolution of conflict.
To paraphrase our next president, the
road toward resolution will be long. The
climb will be steep. But when the real
world facts are more horrifying than
Michael Crichton's fiction, it's high time
something was done to take the first step on
this long road.

Did you see the solitary individual scribbling
notes at First Collection? Yes, that was me. I am a perpetual note-taker. I like to write and consider myself
to be well organized; in fact, I tend to take notes voraciously. It can be embarrassing at times, but I feel as
if this component of my personality has finally found
a calling. Maybe I have been in training for this secretarial position all along and failed to realize it until
a junior on Student Council suggested that I run for
secretary. Regardless, I am now out of my note-taking
closet: I want to be your Student Council secretary.
While I applaud Student Council's efforts to provide opportunities for students to voice their concerns, I feel that active leadership entails more.
Though it is essential that student representatives
listen, we must also think critically, propose concrete
ideas for change and seek feedback to reach a consensus. And, as a contender for this position, I come
with not only a critical yet constructive perspective
but moreover, the energy and will to put my ideas
into action. I see myself as a motor for change.
As secretary, I would like to pave the way for more
student involvement in Student Council: more dialogue and increased accountability. According to its
constitution, Student Council aims to function as a
"vehicle of communication." While our vehicle is not
"totaled" by any means, it could still use a little work.
(Or perhaps a motor for change?)
The broken links and lack of recent newsletters
posted on the Student Council website are clear signs
that this vehicle is in need of repair. I would first
focus on improving the website with a special emphasis on making the minutes concise and easy to read.
It is essential that all students know when Student
Council meets, that the weekly meetings are open to
all, and most importantly, that Student Council exists
to "serve, represent, and protect" the interests of students. In short, please vote for me to be your secre-

time, represent their student constituents.
Yet, this does not mean Swarthmore or Student Council is, or
necessarily will be, free from imperfections. In the coming year,
Swarthmore must have an Appointment Chair who is judicious
and prudent enough to appoint open-minded and passionate
Swatties who take their responsibilities seriously. The
Appointments Chair, head of the Appointments Committee, is
responsible for appointments to the Social Affairs Committee,
Student Budget Committee, and Movie Committee to name only a

new here at Swarthmore, I do have experience in critical leadership positions. My senior year of high school I was the first student to sit on the Development Committee of the Board of Trustees
of the Episcopal Academy, the first student to sit in on any committee for the Board since its founding. The development committee's main purpose was to raise funds for the 212 million dollar
endeavor to buy a new campus and reach out to the entire
Episcopal community including alumni, current parents and
prospects.
I kept the student body updated each time the committee
reached a goal and kept them aware of the building process. As a
student on the committee I also worked with the alumni office to
develop new ways to reach out to young alumni and publicized
alumni events. I am also on the SASS exec board as corresponding
secretary and the co-founder of Coalition for a Free Haiti. I work
very well with others, which has been reinforced through my
experience as an ESL teacher in Chester, a researcher at the
Franklin Institute and English teacher in Guayas, Ecuador.

While on the development committee I was also required to
form a student committeewhose main goal was to educate the student body on the importance of the annual fund and raise funds
for the annual gift which would be donated to a teacher or department of the class's choice. This position has given me vital experience thatI will use as your Appointments Chair.
Though I am a freshman, I am certain that I am qualified for
this position. My passion and excitement is my motivationfor this
endeavor. Vote Jacqueline Bailey-Ross as Appointments Chair.
Thank you.

Aside from my note-taking passion, I would love to
make Student Council work for all Swarthmore students. In concordance with my do ask, do tell policy,
I encourage you to ask me questions and tell me your
thoughts so that I can be your voice. If you don't happen upon my smiling face, please email me at

An open letter from Obama to Swarthmore admissions

PHILIP ISSA
Philadelphia
I'm sure you've heard by now
that Barack Obama, America's
greatest President-Elect ever, was
rejected from Swarthmore.
What you may not know is that I
have in my hand a letter that he
asked me to deliver to the College
after he swept the election. Here it
is:

THE PHOENIX

Dear Swarthmore,
I am what you might call an
"Admissions Mistake." I would have
made an excellent addition to your
basketball team. Also, look at where I
am now.
Maybe you thought I wouldn'treally fit in at Swat. Perhaps I was a little
too well-rounded, too pragmatic, or
just a little bit too good with my
words. I could navigate awkward situations with too much ease, which
would be a tragedy. And, of course I
would do all the readings for seminar
without complaining. I guess you
were worried that with an attitude
like that, I wouldn't make any friends.
What you didn't realize was that
my social grace transcends all. I'd
smile when I see you at the gym, and
I'd say something encouraging when I
pass you on the track. At Paces, I just
want to dance. I love the music, and
it's always ten degrees cooler where
I'm dancing. I'm the kind of guy who
enjoys Sharpies food and genuinely
believes in the Quaker matchbox. I'm
an unflappable Beirut player and a
wizard at Up-the-river Down-the-river
(I always call "same"). I'd be DonateEo
for Halloween.

I had big plans for this school. I
was going to fix the meal plan and
bring back soft-serve ice cream.
Sharpies would stay open later, the
gym would open earlier and the
library would have more windows.
Pub Nite would always have six

kegs.

But OK, you didn't let me in. You
know, I'm kind of glad you rejected
me. The day I got your letter, I said to
myself, "I will never be rejected
again," and just like that, I wasn't. I
left Swarthmore after my interview

and I took Hope with me. That was a
little selfish; I probably should have
left some behind. It seems like you
guys could use some hope.
It's all good, though. I mean, you
did have Dukakis
in a few years,
you might even be proud enough to
admit it. Still, I want to point out
that if you had let me in,
Swarthmore would have the highest
ratio of Presidents to alumni right
now. So, OOPS.
Love, Barack

help, you guys are the bestPhilip is a senior. He can be

Stephan Lefebvre 'll
My name is Stephan Lefebvre and I am running
for the position of Student Council secretary. As
Secretary, I will take notes at all of the meetings and
I will make sure the minutes continue to be posted in
a timely fashion on the StuCo blog. Also, I believe it
is the Secretary's duty to continue to push for transparency and accountability for the Student Council
and the College itself.
The current Council has done a remarkable job of
reaching out to the Swarthmore community most
notably, they station themselves outside Sharpies
and host fun events with the intention of gathering
feedback and offering opportunities for concerns to
be raised. My interest in serving on the Student
Council was sparked by their inspiring outreach and
the realization that other parts of our institution are
not so forthcoming. Lately, the Financial Justice
campaign has raised issues about the College's transparency. 1 will work to bring all aspects of decisionmaking at this College to light. To do this I will join
the current Council members in constantly seeking
input so as to align my priorities with those of my
peers and friends. As secretary, I will be able to
quickly act on these concerns by proposing solutions
to people in positions of power at the College.
As the Council's secretary, I see the potential for
becoming an influential facilitator for building institutional memory on campus. Does your favorite student organization, whether it is a sports team, a performing arts group, or a part of the IC and BCC community, have the resources to document its activities
for posterity? Will the new leadership next year have
to reinvent the wheel? I'm interested in working
with the Deans to create a systematic way of keeping
inter-group records that are both easy to use and
which preserve confidentiality for those groups for
whom this is important. These records will have
immediate benefits. For example, written records
about whom to contact for departmental funding and
how to order a take-out meal for your group from
Sharpies will encourage new students as well as
group members without much free time to help with
events.
Last year, as Treasurer for the Swarthmore Queer
Union (SQU), I started to learn the ins and outs of
Swarthmore, including how to work with the
Student Budget Committee (SBC) to get funding for
groups and activities. My experience working to
plan events such as Paces parties, workshops, book
sales and events for Coming Out Week have made me
aware that the intricacies of getting stuff done at this
school should be available to all. This year I have
helped get several new student groups chartered,
and I'm serving as the Business Editor of the
Halcyon, in which capacity I'm entrusted with all the
funds used for designing, printing, and delivering
the yearbooks. While I still have a lot to learn, I feel
like it is time to put the experience I've gained to
-

.use.

After a year and a half, I see Swarthmore as a
place where I get to live with and learn from the
most amazing people anywhere. I want to serve on
the Student Council to address those few moments
when I notice that something could be improved. You
deserve a Student Council Secretary that is willing
to do more than take notes!
Tiffany Lee 'l2
Are you aware of what Student Council actually
does? No? That's ok, I'm not either. But I'm willing to
learn, and what's more, I'll make sure you come
along for the ride. As secretary, I will ensure that
what goes on in those mysterious meetings is easily
accessible to the rest of the world, or at least to those
of you Swatties who might have the remotest interest. For those of you who do know what's going on
and have your own interesting, wacky, or otherwise
unusual ideas, I will ensure your opinions are taken
into account by the Student Council. After all, who
can keep anything quiet around here, right? The key
is to be heard by the right people in the position to
take action, and as Student Council member, I will

make sure that happens.

Ambar La Forgia 'll

Nate Erskine 'lO
Serving as your StudentCouncil Appointments Chair
has been one of my best experiences at Swarthmore. I
have enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many of you and
to work with some fabulous committee members. I have
used this opportunity to improve the transparency and
accessibility of appointments process. I have learned a lot
about Student Council and Swarthmore, and thus feel
ready to seek the office ofVice-President. I have decided
to run for Vice-Presidentrather than to seek re-election
as Appointments Chair because of my desire to tackle
some important priorities that are listed below. These are
issues that I would not be able to all focus on due to the
organizational responsibilities that go with being
Appointments Chair.
For the past two years, Student Council has made
huge progress in becoming more open and active. Part of
successfully continuing this pattern relies upon having
leaders who are experienced and have a record of positive accomplishments. I believe that I can best fit that
model. The following are a list of my priorities that I
pledge to work on, if you elect me to be the VicePresident:
I promise to better present Student Council as a student advocacy organization. Despite all of our work,
many Swatties do not know what beneficial resources
Council can provide. I hope to accomplish this by establishing a better website to improve facility of communication. As vice-president, I would see it as my responsibility to encourage Student Council to be more proactive
rather than reactive in tackling student issues. I promise
thatI will continue to work withDining Services and students to improve the setup of the meal plan. This
November, I led an open forum for Swatties to learn
about Sharpies and to be able to question our administrators. We have made substantial progress this semester to facilitating communication withDining Services. I
want to make sure that beneficial changes will be in place

I'm afraid that we sometimes get quite bored,
In our secluded sanctuary of Swarthmore,
All work and no play,
Really dampens the day,
And that hard work should not go ignored.
If elected campus life representative, I would do my best to
increase the quality oflife here at Swarthmore. I hope to fix all
the small annoyances, like making sure the printers and coin
machines work. I will use my advertising and publicity skills to
make Student Council, as well as Deans, more accessible and try
to keep you as a student body "in the know." Also, I hope to
diversify and spread out campus events (Why can't weekdays be
fun too?).
As a Student Academic Mentor and a member of the Social
Affairs Committee, I am constantly working with deans and students to increase the quality of life of individuals and
Swarthmore as a whole. I am energetic, determined and friendly
and am ready to be your campus life representative.
So in my final plea,
Please vote for me,
Because....
Swarthmore students, for all the work you do,
Swarthmore campus should work for you too!
Cindy Luu 'l2
If you're looking for someone who is outgoing, vivacious,
bubbly, well-organized, approachable and part Siberian to be
your Campus Life representative, look for Cindy Luu! She's willing to represent your needs with respect to Campus life because
she cares about everyone she meets. She'll learn about what
changes current "Swat team" members want and she'll work to
make it happen by listening to your suggestions and doing whatever necessary to carry out your ideas.
I am Cindy Luu and I approve this message.

Scott 'l2
My name is Omari Scott 'l2 and I am running for Campus
Life Representative. The thought of a freshman running for
this position might sound a little scary for some of you, but I
assure you, you need not be afraid. As a freshman, I bring a
new and fresh perspective to the Swarthmore community.
I understand the importance of communication, meeting
deadlines, and working as part of a team, as I have served in
various leadership positions in high school, and currently
serve as a the Civic and Political Action Coordinator for SASS.
I am also a very good listener, which is a vital characteristic
for this position. I am already a reachable person, but will be
even more so as Campus Life Representative to ensure your
One of the major issues I have heard discussed over the
past few months is the inefficiency of the driers in the dorm
laundry rooms. I believe that this is something that needs to
be brought to the attention of the administration because our
continuous use of these inefficient machines is a detriment to
the environment. While I support Earth Lust's campaign for
students to use drying racks, I also think it is necessary that
we begin to invest in better drying machines. This is one of the
many concerns I know students in the community face, and I
am running for Campus Life Representative because I want to
serve as a voice for you.
I only have one promise for you, and that is I will work tirelessly with the other Campus Life Representative, Student
Council members, and appropriate members of the administration to make sure your concerns as a member of this community are heard and addressed.

by fall '09.1 promise to ensure that the IC and BCC communities have access to the Board of Managers. Last
spring, I successfully petitioned council to invite IC and
BCC leaders to a luncheon with the board this fall. This

was a tremendous step forward, but Student Council's
support should not end there.
I promise to make sure that Student Council continues its responsible oversight of the Student Budget
Committee (SBC). Last semester, I helped to vote down an
irresponsible amendment to our constitution that would
have made difficult for the SBC members to properly
carry out their jobs. It is important that Student Council
insures that the $400,000 student activities budget is well
managed. I promise to make campus security a priority
for Student Council.
Our current council president and I have been laying
down the foundation for a student committee that will
have the mandate to assess security problems and to
report back to us. I want to make sure that this committee is created, and that all Swatties have the chance to
weigh in. Since the incident in Willets this September,
Swatties have done a good job 'Stopping the prop."
Student Councilneeds to push for better campus lighting
and the placement of call boxes around campus. We
should not have to wait for another terrible incident to
make us do more. I promise to continue Student Council
support of seeking a more open financial aid process at
Swarthmore. We owe a lot to the dedicatedSwatties who
have collected over 500 signatures from students and faculty to demand a fairer and better financial aid process.
With many Swatfamilies being hit hard by the economic
downturn, it is extremely important that a successful dialogue continues. I pledge that I will be a dependable liaison to the administration.
I am excited at the prospect of continuing to work on
Council and hope to have your support. Please feelfree to
contact me (nerskinl) if you have any questions about
my proposals.

For student events advisor:
Rachel Bell 'lO
"Change we can believe in." "A leader we can believe
in." Change. Experience. Why do campaigns present
these two concepts as mutually exclusive?
My name is Rachel Bell, and I am embarking on the
rather difficult (and hopefully not too humiliating) task
of campaigning during my semester abroad. That
explains why I did not officially decide to run before the
I always pitied those camfirst platform deadline
paigning from off-campus. So to the 1/4 of you who have
never laid eyes on me on the Swarthmore campus, and to
all Swarthmore students, for that matter, hear me out:
The Student Events Advisor acts as a liaison between
SAC and the Student Council. I believe I am the most
qualified candidate for this position, first and foremost,
because of my experience working on committees pertaining to social life on campus. I became a member of
SAC in the winter of my freshman year, which at the
time was rather daunting because I was the only member
as young as a 2010'er. And I think, over the years, I
brought a lot to the table when it came to SAC.
Consistently, I favored granting full funding to new
events just to see what they might add to campus life. I
like to get creative and feel that having a diverse social
calendar really matters on a campus that can feel as
small as Swarthmore. As an avid study break and party
attendee, I have a good grasp of social life on campus, and
how the student body responds. Anyone remember the
SAC attacks? Yes, a lot ofthat was me, including the everpopular free sushi give-away in the spring of 2007, and the
Qdoba SAC attack last year. What can I say? I recognize
students' "needs." And as far as the more technical
aspects which serving as a SAC member entails, I know
how to host and organize events. I more than held up my
end of the bargain as a non-senior SAC member and can
admit to hosting a few more private festivities of my own.
Okay, enough talk about experience, because let's be
honest: as Swatties, nothing satisfies us. We complain
and not (always) without reason. That's why I also wish
to campaign as a candidate of change. I recognize the
problems with sociallife on campus. Attending meetings
of and holding a position on the Social Scene Advisory

Committee last year gave me a wider perspective of students' views on the social scene. When people complain
about the lack of diversity of events on campus, or how
life can occasionally be monotonous, I absolutely agree; I
am a student choosing to study abroad after all. When
students present new and exciting proposals at SAC
meetings, I jump at the opportunity. And I see the importance ofSAC taking the initiative when students do not
propose frequently. Hence, the SAC attacks of the past
two years.Another complaint I hear concerns SAC as a
committee, and perhaps its disconnect from the student
body and its lack of transparency. I sat in on a meeting
involving SAC, Student Council, and SBC last year about
this very issue. And I do find it legitimate as a former
SAC member, which is why I would love to serve as the
connection or the bridge between the elected Student
Council and SAC, the powerful group with appointed
members. I want to correct for this problem.
What my experience grants me is an eye to the institutional and bureaucratic limits on. change. I cannot
completely overhaul the system and provide free sushi
from Margaret Kuo's every day, nor can I promise you
that I will meet absolutely every single students' needs. I
wish I could, but knowing the budgetary limits and the
rules of funding and hosting events, I understand that I
cannot. But this knowledge does indeed make me aware
ofhow to best improve the quality and diversity ofevents
within the current set-up. And given the financial situation these days, I do not think the college will throw more
and more money at SAC. We have what we have, and I
know how to work within these constraints best.
So, please, vote for me for Student Events Advisor.
Even though I am studying in Copenhagen at the
moment and many students will not be able to meet me
and no freshmen will know me, I hope this platform lets
you know what you need to know. If you have any questions, please email me (rbelll), Facebook message me, etc.
—do what you need to do and I will respond. I hope being
abroad will not disadvantage my campaign, but will
instead assure you all that I can bring a bit of a European
flair to the position. And I am ready to be back at Swat to
do so.

Rivalries exploited to boost morale and ticket sales

had really even begun. This dispute ended in the two players throwing water at each other from their respective
benches. I have to admit, I found this entertaining, but it
did strike me how this incident and others that continued
to occur throughout the game, usually involving Avery,
brought a halt to the game coverage. While play continued
elsewhere on the ice, the TV commentators were left discussing how it was worse of Avery to throw Gatorade than
for Shelley to throw water because of the "stickiness factor." So however entertaining it was to watch these two
grown men resort to water throwing to express their frustration, it left me wondering if this bitterness toward each
other actually had any effect on either team's play or
whether individual or team rivalries are even a useful part
of sports.
There are some obvious uses for team rivalries off the
field, one of which is as a marketing tool for sports. Most
colleges, and even high schools, have a form of the Big
Game, a game against the school's rival, and these are usually hyped to be the most important event of the season. In
the Pac 10 conference, the Big Game between Stanford and
Berkeley football is advertised far more than any other
game in the season. Coaches use these rivalries and
increased advertising in hopes of boosting fan attendance.
According to recent research, this strategy has been
proven to work. An April 2004 article in the American
Journal of Economics and Sociology found that the transition in the NHL over the past decade to increase the number of games played against divisional rivals was success-

Garnet secures ECAC berth
BY JARED NOLAN

jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

In a semifinal match of the
Centennial Conference Championship
last Saturday, Swarthmore Women's
Soccer suffered a 2-1 loss to the
Dickinson Red Devils, ending the
Garnet's hopes of a bid in the NCAA
tournament. Despite the loss, which
dropped Swarthmore's record to 9-4-4
and eliminated them from the conference tournament, the Garnet's season
continued in the Eastern College
Athletic Conference (ECAC) South

Region Championship.

Swarthmore entered last Saturday's
playoff match against Dickinson (the
Red Devils were the No. 2 seed with a
record of 12-3-3) as the No. 3 seed, competing in its third consecutive
Centennial Conference Championship.
The game began auspiciously for
Swarthmore, who returned to its goalscoring ways early in the match
despite coming off two straight scoreless ties. Garnet Midfielder Kelsey
Cline 11 capitalized in the 17thminute
off an assist by fellow midfielder Sarah
Reece 1L Reece recounted the score.
"I played a ball over the top of the
defense to Kelsey. The goalie came out
and Kelsey headed it over her," she
said. It was Cline's third goal of the
season and the eleventh of her career.
Swarthmore's 1-0 advantage held up
for almost half an hour until the Red
Devils found a way to respond. Right
before the end of the half, in the 42nd
minute, Dickinson forward Molly
Schaefer found the back of the net,
assisted by Courtney Anderson and
Ashley Kunkle. The goal sent the
match into halftime with the score tied
atl-L
Both teams experienced multiple
opportunities in the second half, forcing keepers from both sides to make
saves, but neither team could find a
way to finish until the 67th minute.
Dickinson forward Genevieve Olson
scored on an assist by Sarah
Montminy, putting the Red Devils up 2X a deficit the Garnet would not overcome.

THE PHOENIX

Swarthmore keeper Lauren Walker
'O9 finished the game with three saves
while Dickinson's goalie, Kailyn
Hartmann, corralled four of the
Garnet's five shots on goal. Another statistic, total shots, was in the Garnet's
favor.
Swarthmore had 13 shots to
Dickinson's 10, and the Garnet's totals
were also higher in each of the individual halves. Therefore, the Garnet's loss
was not due to lack of scoring opportunities. Forward Emily Coleman 'l2
instead attributed the defeat to another
factor. "We had lapses where we lost
focus," she said. "These lapses caused
the goals. Both were off quick transitions." But once the team gave up the
goals, forward Megan Colombo 11
insisted the team did not give up. "We
tried to get the momentum back," she
said, "but we were just unlucky."
The Garnethas had recent success in
the ECAC Championship. Last season
the team won the regional tournament
in a scoreless match against Catholic
University that required penalty kicks
to establish Swarthmore as the victor.
This year the going will be more difficult, however, because the Garnet have
been seeded sixth (last season the team
had the third seed) and had to play No. 3
seed Delaware Valley College (14-4-1)
yesterday. Dickinson, who lost to Johns
Hopkins in the Centennial Conference
Championship game, also received a
berth in the ECAC Championship, seeded fourth.
"We just want to finish off the season
with a win and give the seniors another
chance," Colombo said about the tournament. "I think that we're a lot better
then our record shows and we can come
together one more time." Even if the
Garnet is unable to produce a victory in
the ECAC Championship, the team
should come back strong next season. "I
think [the seniors] are definitely going
to be big losses, but we still have a lot of
talent on the team, so we'll be able to
continue without them." Look for the
Garnetto continue their emergence as a
Centennial Conference power either in
the final rounds of the ECAC
Championship or when they begin a
new season next September.

ful in helping increase overall attendance at games. For
example, the NHL office increased the number of times
Canadian teams played other Canadian teams. Games like
these, where teams have a long history with one another,
tended to attract more people and were more entertaining
for fans, giving them an opportunity to watch the rivalry
develop.

Besides boosting ticket sales, some sports psychologists

argue that these rivalries can help a team get ready for
important games. In an article on his Psychology of Sports

Web site, Richard Lustberg, a licensed psychologist, discusses how the long-standing rivalry between the Yankees
and Red Sox has intensified games between the two for
both fans and players alike. "Hate has a way of making
people feel alive," Lustberg said in the article. "Hanging
onto a grudge for a long time gives people a feeling of being
pumped up and energized beyond a humdrum day."
Although games against rivals do not count for more
points, psychologically they carry more meaning for players and fans. Thus Saturday's victory against the Stars
was not just another two points for the Sharks and a continuance of their winning streak, but it was also a type of
payback against the team responsible for cutting their previous season short. The fact that this victory came at the
expense of Avery, who spent the entire game provoking
Sharks players instead of concentrating on his own play,
was really just a bonus.

Swimmers place first in CC contest
BY DENNIS FAN

dfanl@swarthmore.edu

While the men's soccer team was locked in
a life-or-death struggle for a spot in the
Centennial Conference Finals, another team's
conference hopes began in nearby Ware Pool.
With fans watching, both the Men's Swimming
Team (1-1, CC 1-0) and Women's Swimming
Team (2-0, CC 1-0) decisively defeated
McDaniel's GreenTerror with scores of 101-83
and 112-84, respectively.
The Garnet was the first to make a statement by winning the first two events, the
Women's and Men's 200-yard Medley Relay.
The men took first, second, and third place on
their medley relay, a feat repeated four more
times by the Garnet in the Men's 50-yard

Freestyle,

100-yard

Freestyle,
100-yard
Backstroke, and 200-Yard Freestyle Relay.
The McDaniel team tried to fight back, and
strung together first place finishes in four consecutive events, but the Garnet's lead proved
to be insurmountable. It did not take long for
the Garnet to record their first conference victories of what looks to be a promising season.

"Meets are a lot of fun.
A big part of It is the
competition somebody
has to come out on top"
Sarah Bedolfe 'U
"We have a really big, really strong freshman class this year," Sarah Bedolfe 11, who
sees the first-years as a key to the success of
the women's team this year, said. The women's
team has several new first-years while the men
have a whopping ten new additions.
"Our team didn't lose a large number of
seniors," said Captain Douglas Gilchrist-Scott
'O9 (who also mentioned that he missed the
departed seniors greatly). Gilchrist-Scott led
the team by taking first in the 200-yard Medley
Relay, 50-yard Freestyle, and 200-yard

Freestyle Relay.

Bedolfe also commented on the competitive
spirit of swimming. "Meets are a lot of fun. A
big part of itis the competition somebody has
to come out on top."

The team has been practicing hard this preseason, which lasted from the end of
September to their first meet against Widener
this past Wednesday. Gilchrist-Scott noted the
incorporation of more dry land' exercises to
their training regimen, and that everybody
has been putting in a lot of work. That is,
swimmers are expected to go to the weight
room and do other (fish)-out-of-water activities
to get in shape.
In addition to swimming together for several hours each week, the teams spend a great
amount of time together outside of the pool.
They often eat together at Sharpies, hanging
out and wearing matching hoodies. GilchristScott confirms that "the swim team is a very
close team...the guys all like to hang out with

each other."
Both teams are hopeful for victory this
year, aiming for the conference title. The
women finished last year with a 6-5 overall
record, the men with a 6-4 overall record, and
both finished second in the Centennial
Championships. For senior Gilchrist-Scott, the
stakes are high as the Garnet men have finished second in the conference for the past
three years.
On the other hand, first in the conference
for those years has been Franklin & Marshall
College, one of the strongest competitors in the
Centennial Conference, and appropriately, the
Garnet's next opponent. The meet, this
Saturday at 2:00 p.m., could provide a litmus
test for the rest of the season.
"The meet should be extremely close,"
Gilchrist-Scott said. "Their team has a lot of
depth and it's not just going to be about who
wins each race." A lot will rest on
Swarthmore's ability to place even if it don't
finish first in an event.
This meet will be key to the Garnet's conference hopes, as Franklin & Marshall seems
to be the biggest obstacle looming between the
swim teams and a conference championship.
Throughout this week our swimmers will be
practicing hard, and, behind the scenes, coaches will be setting up a lineup that highlights
each swimmer's strengths.
There's a fair amount of optimism in the
air. "We have a good chance to win. It's always
a good meet," Bedolfe said. The historic rivalry, the implications for a conference championship, and the promise of a tight competition
are all reasons for coming out to support your
Garnet swimmers this coming weekend.

Swarthmore Men's Soccer team (15-2-2)

won the championship in its first appearance in the Centennial Conference men's
soccer final. In addition to snagging the
school records for Conference wins and
the longest uninterrupted winning streak,
the team captured the first Centennial title
in the program's history in Sunday's dramatic win over longtime rival Johns
Hopkins.
The Championships began with a contest between Johns Hopkins University
and Gettysburg College on Nov. 8. Johns
Hopkins' midfielder Matty Carlson scored
the golden goal in the 98th minute to
secure a 2-1 victory for Hopkins. The vic-

The Garnet began their Championship
run against fourth-seeded Dickinson at
Clothier field. The Garnet started with a
bang, as forward Evan Nesterak 'O9 sent a
low cross from midfielder Dylan Langley

tying the game up five minutes later when
midfielder Ben Gemberling sent a low

cross across the Garnet goal and the ball
found the left corner of the net at 7:14.
Despite a few attempts by both teams,
the game remained scoreless until the
final buzzer. Both teams failed to score in
overtime, thus sending the game into a
penalty kick shootout.

Swarthmore came out victorious in the
shoot-out and earned their place in the
Championship finals. Yoi Tibbetts 'O9, Rory
Stackpole 'O9, Dylan Langley 10 and David
Sterngold 'l2 all successfully made the penalty shots, while goalkeeper David
D'Annunzio 'l2 saved two of Dickinson's
attempts. As a result, Swarthmore won the
shoot-out 4-2, securing their place in
Sunday's final.
"It was a battle," Head Coach Eric
Wagner said. "But we ended up being a better battling team."
The
Centennial
Conference
Championship was contested between twotime defending champion Johns Hopkins
and the Garnet, making their first final
appearance. The Garnet got off to a great
start, earning two consecutive corner kicks
and two shots on goal within the first twenty
minutes. The best chance came when Jeff
Kushner 'O9 intercepted a header on goal in
the twentieth minute. His attempt was
thwarted by a Hopkins midfielder, keeping
the first half scoreless. Hopkins also found
scoring chances but the Swarthmore
defense, led by captain Rory Stackpole 'O9,
proved unbeatable.
The winning goal came at 60:11 in the second half when midfielderStu Leon 'O9 played
a long ball over the Hopkins defense to for-

ward Sterngold. Hopkins goalie Matt Mierley
came out to challenge, but Sterngold chipped
a shot over the goalie at the top of the penalty box, earning his sixth goal of the season.
The Garnet went on to win the game 1-0.
"I think I speak for all the seniors on the
team in saying that this is the way we wanted to end our careers. There's no better feeling than ending up on top, knowing that you
contributed to something special to the program and the school as well"Kushner said.
Stackpole attributed the victories to the
team's depth. The Garnet has shown lot of
depth in their lineup this season. Although
the team was missing key players, including

Celestin 11, their depth proved to be a great
attribute. "Hopkins did not have that depth
and that's a big reason that we won. Being
unable to sub, their midfielders had to play
180 minutes" Stackpole said.
"For me, what was most impressive about
our success was that our defense was outstanding," Sterngold said. In addition, he
lavished praise on the team's graduating
cohort, describing the senior class as "true
leaders." "Our senior captains JeffKushner
and Rory Stackpole really came up huge and
that's what won us the Conference
Championship. Regardless of what happens
for the rest of the season, they will have left a
huge legacy to live up to," Sterngold said.
The players said that the large crowd of
fans had a motivational effect on the team's
performance. "Without a doubt, the homefield advantage certainly worked in our
favor. Two games in a row we've had an
amazing amount of fans. Their support and

enthusiasm was the difference in both
matches," Kushner said. Sterngold also
appreciate the heavy turnout. "The team is
really grateful for the support... it makes the
game so much more fun to play," Sterngold
added.
Swarthmore, currently ranked 11th in
Division EI, will make its fourth appearance
in the national tournament and, for the first
time in school history, will be hosting the
first round of the NCAA Division 111 Men's
Soccer Championship. The first match will

be between Swarthmore and RutgersCamden while the other first match features
a face-off between Salisbury and Dickinson.
The first and second round action of the
Championships will be on November 15th
and 16th at Swarthmore's Clothier field. The
winners of the first-round matches will
advance to second-round action on Sunday,
Nov. 16.
"I think teams will come out fired up and
so will we. If we come out like we did this
weekend, I think it will be exciting to see
how far we go." Stackpole said.

Cabrini squeaks by Garnet basketball in season-opening match
BY DANNY FRIEL

dfriell@swarthmore.edu

The women's basketball team took the court for the first
time this Monday in a season-opening scrimmage against
area powerhouse Cabrini College. The Garnet, who finished
the 2007 season with a record of 8-16, dropped the early season match by a score of 62-64. Yet despite the loss, the scrimmage proves to be a good omen for this year's squad.
Cabrini finished last season at 21-7 on the way to winning
the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference Championship and a
berth in the NCAA tournament. In the same scrimmage last
year, Cabrini outscored Swarthmore by over 25 points. This
year, that margin was cut to only 2. The Garnet returns firstteam All-Centennial Conference selection Kathryn
Stockbower 'll this year. Stockbower, who was also named
the ECAC South Region Co-Rookie of the Year, led the conference in rebounds last winter, and was top-five in points
scored. The team will turn to co-captains Melissa Grigsby 'O9
and Pamela Costello 10 for leadership.
Other returnees include Amber Wantman 10, back on the
roster after not playing last year, and a trio of capable sophomores, Ceylan Bodur 11, Sarah Brajtbord 11 and Summer
Miller-Walfish 11 The remainder of the squad is composed
offour newcomers Christina Duron 'l2, Genny Pezzola 'l2,
Nicole Rizzo 'l2 and Brittany Schmelz 'l2.
Grigsby, affectionately known as "Grigs" by her teammates, looks forward to making big improvements this season. "We are already a much faster team [than we were last
year]," she said, noting that "we can transition a lot, and
we've got that high-powered offense. And I think we have a
lot more depth this year."
The lone senior on the squad, Grigsby looks to facilitate

a smooth transition of the four first-years as well. "It is a
young team, but the sophomore class has a lot of experience," she said of the talented class of 2011, headed by the
standout Stockbower. Grigsby also indicated confidence in
the team's preparation for the season, noting that "we have
been working really hard and are learning how to play with
each other. It's been pretty easy to create this team chemistry." Rizzo, who was first off the bench in Monday's scrimmage, is one of four fresh faces that could help revitalize the
women this year. "It was an encouraging scrimmage," Rizzo
said. "Cabrini had won their conference [championship] last
year, and we stayed with them the entire time. Now we have
two weeks to fine tune our offense and defense [before officially opening the season]."

Miller-Walfish cites the striking difference in the scores
of this year's scrimmage and last year's scrimmage as a step
in the right direction for the Garnet. "We had lost to them by
almost 30 last year, so it was good," she saidof nearly matching the Cavaliers this week. Miller-Walfish, who set a
Swarthmore record for most shots blocked last season, noted
that she is "excited" about integrating a solid freshman class
into the mix. "We are going to be better this year," she said
about the team, which is comprised of only three juniors and
seniors. Rizzo agreed, looking to capitalize on the opportunity to achieve a "team goal to make the Centennial
Conference playoffs, which is doable."
The Garnetlooks ahead to November 22, when it will host
the annual Swarthmore Tip-Off Tournament throughout the
weekend. Swarthmore will open the season against
Wesleyan University at 6:00 pm that Saturday, and will aim
to come out on top of the four-team field, which also includes
the University of Mary Washington and Alvernia College.
