THE PHOENIX

by

Jim MacMillan, the new journalist
mentor of War News Radio, has big
shoes to fill. While his predecessor,
Abdulla Mizead, worked full time,
recent budget cuts have halved hours
from 35 to 17. Mizead left in August to
take a full-time job elsewhere.
MacMillan has previously worked
in the Middle East for the Associated
Press where he and his colleagues won
a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News
Photography in 2005, has been following WNR for about five years and
applied for the first time several years
ago. He said that he was drawn to the
program partially because of its quality, and also because he is "excited
about various forms of new and independent radio" and "WNR leverages
every new media opportunity."
This is a great time for journalism,
for communicating important news."
His primary goal during his tenure
journalist- in-residence is
as
to
increase the audience size of War
News Radio. "This is really a truly
exceptional news organization that
provides a service that is seldom seen.
It's important journalism, and it is
done very well
I've seen inferior
content that gets a greater deal of
attention because of its positioning
online, and I like to hope that we can
take this to a larger audience," he said.
He added that he hopes every student
journalist on staff will "have the best
...

experience possible."
Anjali Cadambi 'l3, a WNR staff
reporter, said that the student journal-

ists are still evaluating what they want
their goals to be as they get to know
MacMillan and collaborate with him.

Mizead's role was extremely
important, according to the students
who worked with him closely. Marina

Tucktuck 'l3, a WNR staff reporter
who worked alongside him during the
summer, said in an e-mail, "[Mizead
helped us by] guiding us through
every step of the production process,
from sharing his story ideas, to
answering our questions, to editing
scripts, to chatting with us about his
experiences in Iraq. He was our
source for any concerns we had about
the show. He always tried to give us
control over what we are doing by
encouraging us and checking up on us
every now and then. I really enjoyed
working with him."
MacMillan will also be teaching a
weekly graduate class at NYU, occasionally leading journalism events at
Temple University, and doing instructional consulting on the side.

"I do have lots of irons in the fire

right now, but I'm going to devote

about half of my waking hours to War
News Radio," he said. "It's my priority."

Since its inception, War News
Radio has always been funded with
money from presidential discretionary funds. These are normally
used to support one-time or shortterm opportunities rather than longterm programs, so the need for cuts
was not surprising.
"In this case the funding was
extended a long time beyond what is
normal," Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice
president of the college and executive
assistant to the president, who oversaw the budget cuts, said in an e-mail.
The operating budget for WNR
remains untouched, which means the
amount of money available for its

September 2, 2010

other usual yearly expenses, such as
phone cards, is the same as in the

past.
"We are really grateful for the college's level of support during these
hard financial times," Cadambi said.
Eldridge hopes that WNR will be
able to find grant money to support
itself after the money for even a parttime professional journalist runs out.
He explained that cutting the hours
was a necessary step in saving money.
"There were no other really viable
options given the financial constraints, even though we discussed
with students their sense of being
able to continue without professional
support. I believe we have found a
good and workable compromise," he
said.
The Lang Center for Civic and
Social Responsibility also lent support to War News Radio by allowing
them to apply for Summer Social
Action Awards, also known as S2A2,
which provided funds to keep the program operating with Mizead's help
over the summer.
Moreover, an intern from the Lang
Center will work with WNR this

semester.

"We're still working to determine
exactly what the role of the Lang

intern will be, but we think that it
will probably involve publicity and
outreach," Cadambi said.
Eldridge is pleased with the state of
the program. "War News Radio is
highly regarded
and has been and
continues to be a valuable experience
for the students and for listeners. We
are happy to have been able to make a
decision to continue the program with
a part-time professional journalist,"
he said.

AlphaAlliedßarton,
Centurion Security Inc. is
replacing Alliedßarton this

The new firm, based in
Havertown, PA, is a femaleowned enterprise that provides security for the Tri-state
area.
Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, one of the

involved in the College's hiring decision, said that the
College subcontracted two

Alliedßarton had been the

The College currently has a

"I do not know at this time

Though Young said AlphaCenturion has a "good reputation," she was unsure if students concerned about labor

Tribute to Joan Friedman (1943-2010)
BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossanl@swarthmore. edu

Joan Esther Friedman
asked all the members of her
upper-level Spanish class to
memorize Pablo Neurda's simply-titled "Poem 20." Many of
her past students still remember some of the poem, or at
least the first line -"Puedo
escribir los versos mas tristes
esta noche," or, "Tonight I
write the saddest lines." But
they remember Friedman herself for her vivacious teaching
style, the joy she brought to
the classroom and the faith
that she had in her students.
Joan, a lecturer in Spanish,
died suddenly of a cerebral
aneurysm on June 14. She was
67.

Joan's husband of 43 years,
Joel Friedman, described her a
positive person who loved life
and wanted to experience
everything. "She had a great
desire to capture every
moment," he said.
Her colleagues remember
her as a woman whose migrations mirrored those of the
characters she read about. She
was born in Shanghai in 1943
to a Russian father and a
German mother, both of whom
have fled anti-Semitism.
At age six, the family
moved to Venezuela. After
growing up there, she came to
the U.S. to study Italian and
Latin American literature at
Hunter College in New York.
She earned her B.A. there in
1965 and went on to receive an
M.A. from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison in 1967,

where she met her husband,
Joel Friedman. She pursued
further graduate study in
Comparative Literature at
CUNY's graduate center. She
went on to hold several teaching posts across the Northeast
before settling at Swarthmore
in 1987.
At the college, she taught
all levels of Spanish language
courses and delved into studying the Jewish experience in
Latin America. It was a little
researched area, but Joan
made use of as many opportunities as possible she could to
pursue the field. She attended
several conferences, translated a novel that chronicled the
migratory experience of one
Jewish family, and became the
publisher of the biannual
newsletter of the Latin
American Jewish Studies
Association.
Associate
Professor
of
Spanish Aurora Camacho de
Schmidt related this interest
to Joan's own experience. "She
had felt the horror of the loss
of many families.
She
remained connected to many
people who had lost relatives
and who had migrated to
either Latin America or the
United States," she said.
Kendal Rinko 'O9, a Latin
American Studies major, tried
to fit Joan's classes into her
schedule wherever she could.
"She just always seemed to
bring the world into the room
with her," she said. "I really
respected her because she was
charismatic. She made me
love going to class everyday."
Joan also expressed her
September 2, 2010

devotion to students outside
the classroom. As the faculty
advisor to HOLA, or the
Hispanic Organization for
Latin American Awareness, a
precursor to ENLACE, she
helped form a Latino community on campus.
Rinko also said that she
sought out Joan for advice on
what major to choose, when to
study abroad and what to do
after college. She valued the
way Joan gave her honest
answers, even if they were
also tough.
Rinko now teaches high
school Spanish in Tennessee
through "Teach for America"
and tries to emulate Joan's
enthusiasm, energy and deep
concern for her students.
"I think about her everyday
when I walk into my classroom because I want to be that
teacher for my students," she
said.
Mark Chin 'l2 remembers
her for the way she made students strive to meet her high
standards. "She knew as students we could reach a certain

Camacho de Schmidt said
that Joan was also deeply
invested in her students, often
remembering specific details
about each one of them and
worrying about them long
after they left her classroom.
"She very often said it's just
like being a mother," Camacho
de Schmidt said.As a migrant, Joan had an
ear for languages and showed
a great respect toward all of

them. Camacho de Schmidt
remembers that Joan always
finished a sentence in the
same language that she began
it in, never mixing the
German,
French,
Italian,
English and Spanish that
swirled in her life.
Joel also recalled that her
knack for learning languages
often came in handy on their
many travels.
"We went to Paris, and we
went to the market. We went
three or four days just listening, not talking to anyone.

Then the next day she was
talking to all the little old
ladies in French," Friedman
said, adding that it was a skill
she inheritedfrom her mother.
"She loved the opera, she
loved music, she loved art," he
said, linking her study of
Italian to her interest in opera.
Joan is also survived by her
two children, Ruth and Daniel.

Google apps available for college community
BY AARON FREEDMAN

afreedml@swarthmore.edu

While students returning to
Swarthmore this fall will be
familiar with the sudden
upstart of classes and clubs,
they may also be surprised by
a new Internet feature that
both of them are now using.
Thanks to an effort by
Information
Technology
Services (ITS) this summer,
students, faculty and staff at
the college will be able to use
their Swarthmore IDs to access
Google Docs and Google Sites
to easily gather information
and collaborate on different
projects.
According to Gayle Barton,

chief information technology
officer, Google Docs and Sites
integration will allow faculty,
students and staff to collaborate on documents, websites
and projects with greater ease
than they ever could have
before. In addition, the apps
are very versatile and can be
used for a number of different
purposes. These include the
purely academic, such as
allowing students in a group
project to collaborate on a project online, to the social, giving
clubs and student organizations the ability to share
resources with members that
can also be edited or updated
by a select group.
"Anytime you're

working
with someone else, [Google
Docs] is a great tool to use,"

said Barton.
Google Docs and Google
Sites, created in 2007 and 2008,
respectively, have always been
available freely to any Gmail
user and have always provided
the same basic functionality
for users.
With Google Docs, one can
create, upload and edit documents, spreadsheets and presentations with an online
office suite, in addition to sharing and editing them in real-

time with any other user.
Google Sites allows users to
easily create and publish their
own websites for various uses,
such as sharing photos and collecting form data.
While college students, faculty and staff with Gmail
accounts have been able to
take advantage of these features for a while, the new ability to sign into them with a
Swarthmore ID and password
gives these apps greater potential for collaborative use.
While the Google Docs and
Sites integration is a very useful new feature itself, it is also
another step towards several
other initiatives. One of these
is the implementation of
Central Authentication Server,
or CAS, which allows multiple
Swarthmore websites and
online services to share common usernames and passwords
for each College student,
teacher and staff member.
CAS also shares directory
services across different applications, which allows one student to invite anyone else at
the College to see a Google Doc
simply by starting to type the
person's name, letting autocompletion fill out the rest.

The second initiative is
cloud services that is, offering
more
and
more
Swarthmore web services
through providers that store
data off-site in the vast Internet
"cloud." According to Barton,
these include the college's
existing wiki and blog services, Moodle and Google Docs
and Sites.
Future possibilities include
Amazon S3
a file hosting
service that gives users the
ability to host huge files and
computer processes. There is
also an online video tool currently being tested by ITS, in
addition to the possible implementation of Google's photo
managing and sharing service,
Picasa.
-

A new Google Apps tab is now on the Dash, the new campus dashboard for faculty, staff and students,
allowing anyone with a Swarthmore account to use Google Docs and Google Sites.
Still, there are some limits

to the increasingly large offering of cloud services at the

College. For example, last year
the joint student-faculty-staff

ITS Committee evaluated
Gmail as a possible alternative
to SwatMail but eventually
decided it to be "not useful at
that time," and seemed "kind
of unnecessary" according to
Barton.
TTowever, as a result of this
decision, other Google services that rely on Gmail, like
Google Chat, Video Chat and
Google Calendar, will not be
offered through the College, at
least in the near future.
Google Docs and Sites still
seem to have already began to
proliferate around the campus.
In the flood of mailing lists and

meeting minutes that comes

with the start of clubs, a few
student groups, such as
Students for a Democratic
Society
(SDS)
and The
Phoenix, have already made
use of the Google services with
which their SwatlD's provide
them, including online surveys, interactive spreadsheets,
and shared documents filling
up students' inboxes.
Yet students aren't tile only
ones using Google apps members of the faculty and administration are as well.
For example, Barton said
that ITS has been using Google
Docs to keep meeting minutes
that can be seen by all of the
ITS staff, and the Alumni
Office has been collecting
information for events using
.

Google Forms, a feature of
Google Docs that takes survey
results and puts them directly
into a spreadsheet.
However,

haven't fully taken advantage
of the Google integration yet.
"It's really new. No one's really switched to it," said
Jonathan Gluck 'l2, an ITS student associate. But, Gluck is

Sites'
future
at
Swarthmore. "I expect it to be

'U.S. News' changes rating criteria for university rankings
BY ELLIE LEVITT

Sept. X

2010

With the release of U.S.
News and World Report's
university

Columbia

rankings,
University

eclipsed Penn for the first
time in recent memory.

The report, which came
out in mid-August, ranked
Columbia fourth
four
spots ahead of its ranking
last year. Penn dropped

from fourth to fifth this
year
and
tied with
Stanford University for
the second year in a row.
Steven Goodman, educational consultant at Top

6

Colleges, said there are
two reasons why Columbia
appears to have "jumped
out of the blue."
In addition to long-

established criteria, this
year's ranking relied on
two
new components:
graduation rates and the
opinions of high school
college counselors. Both

favored Columbia, according to Goodman.
The ranking committee
looked at the difference
expected
between
and

actual size of graduating
class. Since Penn has been
a "much stronger" school
in the last 20 years, it has a
smaller graduation differ-

ential

than Columbia,
Goodman explained.

"It's almost like an

Olympic athlete," he said.

When someone who wins
three gold medals was
expected to win four, their
exceptional accomplishment is almost disappointing. By contrast, when

someone who isn't slated
to do well wins two gold
medals, the achievement
seems admirable, he said.
One of the other main
reasons for Columbia's
success has to do with its
location in New York City.
For the first time, college
counselors' opinions were
included in the assessment

ranking, and these counselors expressed their students' increasing interest
in the city over the last

decade.
"Urban
institutions
have recently enjoyed a
great renaissance," Dean
of Admissions Eric Furda
said.
Columbia began
experiencing a real shift in
the early 1990s as the
school began promoting
New York as a resource.
Furda, who is beginning
his third year at Penn,
worked in admissions at
Columbia
from
1991
through 2008.

Consulting

Michael Goran believes
rankings aren't actually
that important to most stu-

dents.

"The general prestige of

a top-20 school factors into
some students' analysis,
but beyond that point,
they're not scrutinizing
these numbers," he said.
Furda agreed but added
that international students
in particular strongly consider rankings in their col-

lege decisions.
"Disproportionally, the
report

carries greater
further away,"
Furda said. Parents of
international
students
sometimes only pay for an

weight

expensive American education if their child is
accepted into one of the
top five schools, for example.
At the end of the day,
however, Furda, Goodman
and Goran all encourage
students to look past the

numbers.
"The rankings generally influence students to a
degree, but thankfully

once we get past the numbers we really do look at
what schools are about,

what schools are a better
fit based on an array of factors," Goran said. "It really is silly to base a school

on what number it is."

:

These particular styles could hardly seem more
different, particularly when referring
to contemporary American science fiction shows which, like 'Battlestar
Galactica,' tend to be dramatic to the
point of humorlessness (sorry, BSG
fans; I don't doubt that the show had its
merits, but a sense of humor wasn't one
of them). This is rather at odds with
comedies, whose defining characteristic is, unsurprisingly, the ability to
make you laugh.
There is, however, one important
and influential point of intersection
between British comedy and sci-fi, and
that is the absurdly long-running
British TV touchstone 'Doctor Who.'
For British people, 'Doctor Who,' which
has been broadcasted for over forty
years, is the equivalent of 'I Love Lucy,'
'The Simpsons,' and 'Seinfeld' all rolled
into one; it has had a truly unique
impact on British culture. For an entertaining discussion of the show's influence, watch Eddie Izzard's extremely
funny discussion of the Daleks (the
major villains of "Doctor
Who"), which can be found ffp :
on YouTube.
I discovered the new "Doctor

1963 to 1989, was brought back by
the BBC in 2005), and spent the

Tennant's Doctor, however, was
much more than just the madcap adventurer visible on the surface; he was also
capable of great sadness and unfathomable rage, and Tennant played all
those qualities to perfection. In my
opinion, the best episode of the new
"Doctor Who" (as well as one of the best
episodes of any T.V. show, ever, period)
is the two-part episode of season three
"Human Nature" and "The Family of
Blood," in which the Doctor is forced to
disguise himself as a human in order to
evade the titular Family, a group of

extraterrestrial hunters who will follow
him to the end of the universe in order
to kill him and gain immortality.

The medium of sand also demon-

strates the impermanence of all things,
especially in the dismantling ceremony
when the sand is cast into a body of
water. The process bears meaning to the
belief that nothing in the world lasts forever. "Everything comes and everything
goes," Losang said.
Religious Advisor to the Protestant
Community Joyce Tompkins, who has

observed a mandala dismantling ceremony, spoke of such a planned destruction.
"To watch the monks create such a
beautiful,
work of art, then
willingly let it go, seems a much-needed
lesson in humility and grace," Tompkins
said.
From Sept. 6-10, Losang will work on
the mandala and will dismantle his creation during a ceremony on Sept. 11 at
11:30 a.m.
Each mandate's distinctive design has
remained a tradition for over 2,600 years.
The mandala that Losang will create, the
Wheel of Life, teaches that all worldly

suffering originates from three poisons:
anger, greed, and ignorance.
The circular form of the mandala
demonstrates the understanding of life
as a cyclical existence of birth, death and
rebirth, which is called "samsara." One
is constantly evolving and through continual rebirth, one is given the opportu-

nity to cleanse oneself of these three poisons to grow closer to enlightenment.
Geissler said, "Buddhism is the medicine, the doctor, the nurses who cure this
malady that we have."
The center of this mandala depicts
three animals that represent the poisons:
the snake for fear, the rooster for greed,
and the boar for ignorance. The ying and
yang, dark and light areas surrounding
the center, represent respectively those
seeking to lessen the force of the poisons
and those suffering due to theirpresence.
Six realms divide the next circle into

conditions that result from the presence
of the poisons, but a radiant Buddha
offering hope depicted in each realm suggests the unending possibility of liberation from the poisons.
Twelve illustrations in the outermost
circle illustrate the phases ofhuman consciousness. Death is depicted not as the
end of life, but instead as the renewal of
life through rebirth. It upholds the idea
of samsara, one's cyclical existence
formed by his or her choices.
Sand paintings are considered
enlightenment art since each mandala
acts as a mirror for self-reflection. Its
purpose is to bring one to the realization
of the true self and simply viewing a
mandala is a chance to encounter both
peace and harmony.

Year: 2012
From: New York City, New York
Current Residence: Pittenger
What She's Wearing:
"This [dress] is from Target
it's Isaac Mizrahi,"
Disken-Cahill said, adding her dismay that Mizrahi no
longer designs for Target. "My shoes are from Kmart and
my necklaces are from Target and Forever 2L" DiskenCahill also enjoys thrifting through flea markets and yard
sales and found her ladylike handbag at a local church for
50 cents.
How She Describes Her Style:
"I'm totally the 'older woman'," Disken-Cahill said of
her style, which consists of many floral dresses, cardigans and handbags. Though these types of styles used to
be found mainly in your grandmother's closet, the look of
the 'so's has invaded runways, stores and TV shows, like
"Mad Men," a favorite of Disken-Cahill's. "[I like] the
kind of 'Suzy Homemaker' look. I love aprons," she said.
"My way of being girly is by wearing floral dresses and
stuff like that."

Fashion Influences / Inspiration:

"A lot of Isaac Mizrahi and Zac Posen," Disken-Cahill
consistently loved what they put out." She
loves looking through old photographs of her grandmother and great-aunts and evokes their styles. Her family
lives in North Fork, Long Island, which is largely farm
country, and she frequents the yard sales where older
ladies sell their clothing from the 30s to the 60s. "It's completely changed... every aspect [of my life], such as what

Where She Shops:
For as much as New York has some of the best shopping, Disken-Cahill would rather go to thousands of yard
sales than Barneys or H&M. "I love yard sales because I
love to barter with people, and church thrift store:
because the women always give yomthe funniest stories,'
she said. "I enjoy the atmosphere more than anythin{ ;
else." She also loves the bargains, such as her 50-cen
handbag and a beloved $3 dress.
For Disken-Cahill, shopping is more about the experi
ence and the stories behind the clothes. "The people
when you shop at those stores [i.e. department stores

Forever 21, etc.], don't have any connection to what they're selling and
they don't really have a story to it,"
she said. "I think that the most exciting thing about buying an item is
having a story to it, whether it's your

said. But her main staple is a dress. In
7th grade, she stopped wearing pants
altogether and has never looked back.
While some of her friends thought that
wearing a dress could be complex, she
begs to differ. "Once you start wearing
dresses, your whole outfit is picked out for
you," she said. "With pants, you have to
pick a shirt and you have to pick all this
that's it,
other stuff, but with dresses
you've got the whole ensemble and the

whole look together."
Disken-Cahill also finds that wearing
dresses daily is quite perfect for a lazy person. "Wearing dresses is like a cop out," she
said, adding how easy it is to save time and
just roll out of bed into a good floral dress
quite a must for the lazy college students who
typically look like they never change from
their pajamas. "It really pulls things together,"
she said. "It makes you look like you thought
really hard about what you were wearing than
you actually did [sic]."
Never Leaves the House Without:
Obviously, Disken-Cahill is always in a dress
But besides that, she loves her purses. "I am ai
obsessive handbag collector," she said. "I justify i„
by spending 50 cents on a bag, but it's absolutely
ridiculous." With her expansive collection, Disken-Cahill
likes to change her wallet, bag or pocketbook, though not
to attract attention from others. "It's more so that I can
use different [purses], it's not what other people are going
to think about it. Dressing for me is very selfish," DiskenCahill added with a laugh.

writer and actors, all seven artists work
collaboratively in a devised theatre form,
where all the members of a company write
and create the work together.

fell easily into place. At the start of summer, the group got right to work.
"We all kind of just brainstormed
themes and ideas that we
wanted to see
on stage or our ideas we had about characters," Jargow said. "We came across characters that we liked and
we tried to figure out how to tie them together in the

most rich and dynamic way."
Following the devised theater model, all
the artists started the process by presenting and talking about their ideas, com-

bined with hours of improvisations and
creating characters. They would also have
one-on-one interviews with each other as
their characters, building backstories.
"We started by playing, and then we
did a lot of improvisation, so once we knew
which characters we wanted to highlight,
we figured out what scenes we need[ed] to
tell their stories," Bang-Jensen said.
There was also a video camera recording their improv games and scenes, which
playwright Goodman later watched and
edited to pick out the strongest characters
and stories.
"[lt] was fun for me to have these scenes
that the actors had done so much in developing and to just put them in order and
streamline them," Goodman said, translating the fast-paced movement of improv to

dialogue or a scene.

While other theatre companies can't
dedicate as much time as Telephone
Bronco did (20 hours a week through the
entire summer), the process led to stronger
characters and defined themes. Even
before rehearsals, the group agreed on two
themes: the brain and cartography, the
study of map-making. They wanted to
explore how the inner workings of the
brain translate into the external world and
the borders and lines in which we place

"We started with these themes in

\L&.

this past spring, I decided that I was
tired of reading about places and wanted
to actually see them. I was slightly ahead on credits thanks to Arabic and AP classes, so I chose to
take the semester off and spend a few months traveling. I already had a plane ticket out of Tbilisi,
Georgia in early October, meaning that I would have
less than two months to cross the continent. A little
daunting, perhaps, but a lot better than a midterm
exam.
Like most Californians, Mexican food is a comfort food for me. Within a day of beginning my solo
trip, in Helsinki, Finland, I was already craving a
burrito. Scandinavian food involves copious
amounts of herring, berries and enough reindeer
per person to wipe out Santa's flight team weekly. I
have nothing against pickled herring, as I know that
the Russians believe it can counteract the alcohol in
vodka, but our relationship had become a bit
strained.
It was a tremendous relief therefore when I spotted a Mexican flag flying from a building in
Helsinki. Suddenly, the grass became guacamole,
the lines on the road sour cream, and the honking
cars a mariachi band as I hurried toward heaven.
Strangely, there were no tables outside, only an
intimidating man (a bouncer? At 10 am?) standing
outside. It was at this point that I realized I had
arrived at the Mexican embassy.
My quest foiled, I left Helsinki for Tallinn,
Estonia and came across the legendary Brice Jordan
'l2, who was busy charming Estonians in two languages outside a pub. We left our groups to catch up,
and ended up agreeing to meet the next day for
lunch at a local Estonian place named Eat. This
restaurant specializes in dumplings, which you pay
for in units of 100 grams. It was excellent and something I would highly recommend if you ever find
yourself in my new favorite city in the European
Union, but I still needed some Mexican food.
The next day, Jordan and I tried a Mexican place
in Tallinn's old city. Our burritos arrived quickly,
and I soon discovered that the poor Estonian chef
had confused Mexico with India. To be fair, my
curry burrito was quite good and something I've
had back home, but I felt wronged.
Soon enough I was on my way to Riga, a beautiful
city filled with Art Nouveau architecture, which
involves Greek heroes supporting balconies, lions
roaring from the roofs of buildings, and general
awesomeness.
After joining a few new friends for sightseeing, I
exchanged my 60 Estonian krone (EEK) for 2.11
Latvian lats (great currency names, Baltic states),
which didn't seem like much until I managed to buy
yellow peppers, pasta, basil, cucumbers and a peach
with one of the lats. Here comes perhaps the best
hostel food tip I know give your leftovers to the barman/manager of your hostel. That night, I paid Pub
Nite prices for my Czech and German beers, which I
believe may have inspired a few of my table mates to
take up cooking during their stay.
As you'll soon discover in this column, I don't
like staying in one place for too long. And so the end
of the week found me in Vilnius, Lithuania. Just
across the river from the Uzupis Republic, an "inde-

of cats to be fed, I discovered
a Mexican place that
included guacamole in
its burritos. With
great joy and jubilation, my quest had
finally ended in success.
Again, I was on the
*F move, heading south
to Warsaw. Having satisjP fied my desire for Mexican
food, I decided to eat the most
Polish meal possible. I surveyed
the street, located the man with the
most epic facial hair to baldness

the same thing as him. This backfired horribly when a few minutes later, my plate appeared
with the usual cabbage, carrots, and a sort of cole
slaw Gust like Baltic food) and two giant samosas
topped with lentils (I know they were samosas from

the bill, not from the taste). I wanted to grab him by
the handlebars of his mustache and yell "thanks a
lot, you inauthentic jerk," but instead I simply
choked down my juice, which tasted like a combination of carrots, rye bread, and soil and that would
have made even the least-washed hippie beg for
Coca-Cola.
The gods offood soon took pity on me though, and
just as I headed back to my hostel from a day of
sightseeing and watching the zoo's free brown bear
exhibit (bears are my third favorite wild animal,
just a hair ahead of jaguars thanks to Paul Weston),
I came across a delicious-smelling kebab stand. As I
ate my kebab, I realized that every single person
around me was speaking Polish, even the Turkish
men making kebabs. Perhaps a pita kebab is just as
authentically Polish as a burrito is authentically
American.

Sharpies TV purchase
flawed but salvageable
Sharpies Dining Hall's new flatscreen
television came first as a surprise to students confusing and, perhaps for some,
frustrating.

Since having a television in the dining
hall has never seemed worthwhile and
demand for one has never seemed strong,
its seemingly inexplicable arrival made
the college's purchase look rash, ill-

It's been clear for years that we've consistently had only one dining hall to preserve Quaker tenets of communal eating

and open discourse. That said, the television will likely distract students from conversation rather than push them toward
it.

for many sporting events.
And who even has "control" of the television? The dining hall staff? A random
student? A new table each day? Choosing
the "right" program or show is an inane,
worthless debate, particularly for our college
but it is a debate, as many know,

inextricably linked to having a television.
If there were snowstorms or similar
emergencies, it also seems unlikely that
we all could or would want to gather in
Sharpies.
Nevertheless, complaining will not get
rid of the television; it's here to stay.
Perhaps the television isn't an irrevocably bad decision. After all, Dining
Services purchased it in the interest of the

ing budget, which is money allotted for
more standard purchases like food.
For example, it's not as though buying
a TV was in lieu of getting more organic
food because the two purchases are dictated under two separate budgets. In turn,
spending money on a television in
Sharpies does not take away that amount
from, say, financial aid because Dining
Services and financial aid expenditures
are dictated by different budgets.
While these points may clear up confusion and quell frustration, they still
struggle to change one simple fact: The

A slide show of events with details
could be useful, but the college needs to
figure out how to fairly gather all this
information from the student body and

effectively show it. In turn, students
should not simply complain, but voice
concerns to the Dining Services staff,
which has admirably worked closely with
students in the past.
And seeing as there wasn't much student input on purchasing the television,
Dining Services could poll the students to
gauge what they'd like to see. This easy
tactic could help strike a much-needed
rapport between the administration and

students about the issue.

the left and right cannot
come together on any one issue.
It's not that I am some sort of "moderate" who expects everyone to get together
and compromise all the time, but there is
one issue where this may be possible:
same-sex marriage.
The debate over same-sex marriage has
three distinct sides
individuals such as
President Barack Obama support civil
unions but not same-sex marriage, social
conservatives oppose it entirely, and social
liberals support the right fully.
As a socially conservative Christian, I
have been trying to align myself with one
of those sides for years. Recently, I realized
that there was another way
the government should get out of the marriage business.
In a San Francisco Chronicle article
from March 2009, Pepperdine Law School
professors Douglas W. Kmiec and Shelley
Ross Saxer wrote that Proposition 8, the
ban on gay marriage in California passed
by popular vote in 2008, does nothing to
solve the issue. They propose that the government stop regulating marriages. People

would be recognized as "together" there
would be no marriage in the eyes of the
law. Essentially, it would be civil unions
for homosexual and straight couples.
I have always seen marriage as a religious ceremony, so I have no problem with
this. As a conservative, I would like to
have the government out of my life as
much as possible anyway. Kmiec and
Saxer go on to propose that marriages be

given out by individual churches.
This idea takes the issue out of the

hands of the government and puts it into
those of churches and their parishioners.
If you don't want to go to a church that permits same-sex marriages, then you don't
have to. It solves the problem entirely.
My question is why this idea has not

been picked up by other conservatives, or
independents
even
and moderate
Democrats.
The most prominent figures who have
offered the idea are California Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Attorney
General Jerry Brown. They supported in
separate legal briefs the elimination of the
use of the word "marriage," which could
be done through legislation. This seems to
me a perfect compromise.
While I would not have voted for
Obama in the 2008 election, I admired his

determination to change politics in
Washington and to unify the nation, even
though I knew it would not happen. Many
people I know felt this nostalgia for a less
contentious political climate.
The recent overturning of Proposition 8
by a U.S. District Court judge has opened
up the floodgates for disputes over samesex marriage to head to the U.S. Supreme
Court. The longer the debate takes to
resolve, the more acrimonious it will

become. Rather than let one more issue
divide the nation, action should be taken
to end government regulation of marriage.
Ridding the government from involvement in granting marriages may not be
the perfect solution, but I believe it is the
best solution. In the politically polarized
society we live in, it is rare that such a
compromise could be found.
Some see social conservatives as opposing gay rights and not recognizing the

diverse society in which we reside, but
this is untrue of most social conservatives.

Issues such as the criminalization of the
travesty that is abortion and fighting
against the immoral spread of pornography are more widely accepted goals of
social conservatives.
There are some on the far-right who
may not be willing to accept homosexuals,
but this is not true of the majority of us
social conservatives.
In what has become a divisive political
system, we must be willing to compromise
if a compromise exists that allows both
sides to have what they want.
Ending the government's involvement
in marriage has the potential to achieve
this end.

Hopes and expectations are high for the field hockey class of 2014. "Given that we're such a small team,

These questions are only a few of
the tests Swat athletic trainers are
asking fall athletes to complete as part
of Swarthmore's ever-evolving concussion protocol. This newest addition of
tests, called ImPACT, has athletes
undergo a series of computer exercises
testing their recall ability and speed as
well- as other brain functions such as
attention span. The results of these
tests can then be used as a baseline
comparison if athletes ever are diagnosed with a concussion.
This new testing is another
improvement to an already extensive
protocol that has been in place at Swat
for several years. As research in head
traumas has changed, the athletic
trainers have adapted Swat's program,
but have always erred on the side of
caution.
"We have athletes come in here
with head injuries who want to get
back on the field, saying there is a big

Johns Hopkins," Head Athletic
Trainer Marie Mancini said. "And we
have to tell them no, you have physics
class and biology class coming up and
that is more important."
However, not all athletic institutions are this careful about head
injuries and there are very few rules
that require them to be. Even the
NCAA's supposed crackdown this year
on concussions does not require
enough of college athletic departments.

New legislation only requires that
member institutions have a concussion management plan for student-athletes, according to legislation 3.2.4.16
in the NCAA handbook. The plan
requires schools to do four things: educate students on concussion symptoms, evaluate players showing symptoms of a concussion, remove an athlete diagnosed with a concussion for at
least the remainder of that calendar
day, and have a medical clearance for
all athletes diagnosed with a concussion by a physician or the physician's
designee (e.g. an athletic trainer).
While this may be a good start, it is
not a strict enough policy to protect
student-athletes. By merely requiring
athletes diagnosed with a concussion
to be removed for the remainder of the
day that they are injured, this policy
leaves the possibility that athletes
with concussions could return to contact play within 24 hours of being
injured. As more research comes out
about the prevalence of head injuries
in intercollegiate sports and the serious side affects of improper treatment,
the NCAA needs to help athletic train-

ers protect their athletes by setting
stricter standards for concussion policies.
In the last few years, there has been
an increased awareness of head
injuries not only in medical fields but
also in the press. Most of the recent
articles that have highlighted the
severe consequences of head injuries
have focused on either professional
athletic teams or sports the public sees
as high-risk for concussions like football or hockey.
However, a 2003 study done by the
department of kinesiology at Temple
University reported that of 15 different
intercollegiate sports tracked over
three academic years for concussion
injuries, the two sports that reported
the highest percentage of players suffering a concussion during a game

ies have shown that soccer and
lacrosse players ofboth genders suffer
a higher percentage of head injuries
than other sports and that female athletes suffer a significantly higher percentage of concussions than male athletes competing in the same sport.
The fact that concussions are a
problem across many different sports
make it even more important for the
NCAA to require schools to have better concussion policies. While it is possible that the apparent increase in concussions is due to better awareness of
concussion symptoms by coaches,
trainers and players, this does not

September 2, 2010

change the dangerous long-term side
affects of repeated concussions. The
NCAA should be leading the athletic
community in concussion prevention
and treatment, not just now starting to
require schools to have a plan for athletes with head injuries.
Swarthmore's athletic department
has set a good example for what the
NCAA guidelines should be. The current protocol here at Swat has any
player reporting symptoms of a head
injury pulled from participation and
immediately evaluated by an athletic
trainer, according to Mancini and
Assistant Athletic Trainer Jessica
Lydon. If an athlete is diagnosed with
a concussion after seeing a physician
at Worth Health Center, he/she is ineligible to play for a minimum of seven
days. Even after being cleared by the
same physician, an athlete must
undergo a Return To Play protocol
closely monitored by the athletic
training staff before being cleared for
competition.

The NCAA's current protocol
requirements are closer to that of the

NFL than those of Swarthmore.

A

recent column in the Philadelphia
Daily News calls the required poster
in NFL locker rooms outlining the
dangers of concussion symptoms as
"as bold a step as the NFL has ever
taken in trying to change the culture
of hiding brain trauma from doctors."
Not to belittle the NFL's efforts, but I

think the NCAA can do better than a
poster or simply the requirement of

Garnet ready to spike Centennial competition in 2010
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

What a difference a year can make.
Entering the 2009 season after a disappointing 6-19 finish the year before,
the Swarthmore Garnet Women's
Volleyball team was picked to finish
ninth in the preseason poll for the 11team Centennial Conference.
But after a fourth place Conference
finish in 2009, the first Centennial
Conference playoff victory in program
history, and an ECAC South Region
playoff berth, the Garnet begins the
2010 campaign with a target on its back
and dreams of surpassing last year's
19-11 record.
The Garnet brings a very young
team to the gym floor in 2010, but as the
team proved last year, youth can translate into success. The team features
only one senior, Sarah Lambert, and
three juniors.
Though the Garnet will miss the
leadership and experience of Kearney
Bangs 'lO and Johanna Bond 'lO, key
pieces in last year's playoff run,
Sophomore Kat Montemurro, who was
the only first-year in the Conference to
be named to the All-Centennial volleyball teams in 2009, believes that the
team has the talent and chemistry to
overcome these losses.
"Kearney [Bangs] and Johanna
[Bond] are really tough players to
replace, but we have so much talent
coming in," said Montemurro. We did
lose two very key players, but we know
that we have to step up. We're ready to
make the big plays and to step into
leadership roles with the team."
Head Coach Harleigh Chwastyk
enters her ninth season at Swarthmore
as the reigning Centennial Conference
Coach of the Year. During her tenure,
the Garnet has captured three tournament titles, made two Centennial
Conference playoff appearances, and
competed in last year's ECAC tournament, and Chwastyk believes that this
year's team can build off of last year's
success.
"We are gaining respect from our
conference opponents, so we need to
respect them as well. We are going to
take each opponent one at a time and
take each match one as a time. We are
going to out-prepare and outwork our
opponents," said Chwastyk.
The Garnet had the opportunity to
compete for the first time this season
in the Swarthmore Preseason
Spikefest, as Swarthmore faced
Centennial Conference rivals Johns
Hopkins and Washington and nationally ranked Eastern. The Garnet won
five of nine sets and continued to
improve throughout the afternoon.
First-years Maggie Duszyk, Brone
Lobichusky, and Danielle Sullivan all
showed that they will make major contributions in an already potent
Swarthmore lineup.
Chwastyk called the class of 2014 the
most experienced incoming class that
she has seen in her time at
Swarthmore. She added that the firstyears "also bring great size, and this
size adds to the fundamentals that we
already have in our program. We are
going to have a stronger more aggres-

THE PHOENIX

sive attack, and our ball control and
defense will improve as well."
The size and experience of the firstyears will strengthen the already talented returning core. Junior Genny
Pezzola, who became the first player in
Swarthmore history to receive firstteam All-Centennial honors for her
2009 performance, was 41st in the country last year with 3.74 kills per set for
Division 111. Pezzola will work alongside sophomores Montemurro and
Allie Coleman, who already ranks
sixth in program history in assists,
juniors Lisa Shang and Hillary
Santana, and senior Sarah Lambert.
Shang, Swarthmore's libero, has averaged nearly three digs a set in her
career, Santana leads the team in
career blocks, and Lambert is just four
aces away from 100 on her career.
But the contributions of this core
group of players extend well off the
court. Lobichusky admires the leadership and confidence that the returning
players have shown throughout preseason.
"They have been really supportive
throughout
preseason.
Genny
[Pezzola] is always there, shouting
encouragement. You can always here
her voice in the background. Same
with Kat [Montemurro]. She's just a
fireball, always pumping you up."

Lobichusky is eager to contribute in
2010, and is excited to continue her
shift to the college game.
"It's been a big transition," said
Lobichusky. "The biggest difficulty so
far has been the speed. The college
game is a lot faster than the high
school game. I'm still working on my
reflexes to get them to where they need
to be for collegiate competition."
Montemurro has
also
been
impressed with the play of the firstyears heading into the season. "The
[first-years] have been great so far. It's
amazing how they have been able to
play in the preseason. I know for me
coming in last year, it was really tough
to get into the rhythm of playing with
a new team and a new system, and I
think that they have adjusted really
quickly. They just look natural on the
court."
It is this comfort on the court, and
confidence in each other
for the
incoming first-years, and for the
returning players with another year of
college experience that will allow the
Garnet to contend for a Centennial
Conference championship this year.
But as the Garnet proved last season, the final Centennial standings can
look very different from the preseason
poll. The team recognizes that though
they may have gained the respect of
their Conference foes, they will need to
battle in order to live up to the high

preseason expectations.

"The
poll

means

absolutely nothing. We proved that
last year in finishing so much higher
than we were picked to finish," said
Montemurro. "We improved so much
from last year start to finish, and that
process is really just beginning. It
really comes down to how we work and
how we play, and we have to take it
game by game. There is no limit to
where we can go from here."

BY TIM BERNSTEIN

This summer on HBO's "Hard
Knocks," viewers have been treated to
a behind-the-scenes look at the training camp for the New York Jets, a
team that possessed a stringent
defense and went deep into the postseason in 2009.
For their surprising success last
season, the Jets were rewarded with
both an enhanced profile and
increased expectations to match.
Cut out the HBO and the story can
be applied to the Swarthmore men's
soccer team with surprising fluidity.
The Garnet wasted little time establishing itself as a defensive power in
2009, surrendering just one goal in its
first seven games and fourteen for the
entire year.
The Garnet proved to have a formidable offense as well last year, averaging a little over two goals per game.
For the first time in the program's history, Swarthmore was nationally
ranked for the entire season. For the
second consecutive year, the team
reached the Round of 16 in the NCAA
Tournament.
However, for all of the promise that
the team's NCAA run inspired, the
2009 season came to an end in heartbreak. Tied 1-1 with Transylvania at
the end of overtime in their Round of
16 match, Swarthmore was defeated on
penalty kicks and sent home.
For the players, the defeat, once a
source of agony, has since been converted into motivation. "This year, we
