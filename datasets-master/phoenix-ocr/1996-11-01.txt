CPC Report Coincides With Incidents of Hate Speech
Sturm
Erica Turner

By Tony
&

In the past week, several incidents of hate

speech have coincided with the publication
of a report on speech released by the College
Planning Committee's TaskForce on Speech
and the Academic Community at Swarthmore.
On October 24 a homophobic remark, "Fuck
Homos," was spray-painted outside the fifth
floor of Parrish. This prompted an all-campus e-mail from Dean Ngina Lythcott to
inform the campus of the incident.
Workers from Physical Plant removed the
graffiti that morning. Administrators do not
know the identity of the offender, according
to Associate Dean Tedd Goundie.

Goundie said of the homophobic graffiti,
"If we didknow [who had done it], under our
current policy it would not be adjudicated as

hate speech, although it would be considered
vandalism," Goundiesaid. Under the current
harassment guidelines in the Student Handbook, the incident would not be considered
harassment either.
Lythcott described another incident of harassing speech in which a Swarthmore student told two students speaking Spanish on

their way back to campus from the Mary
Lyon Halloween party that they should go
back to where they came from because people
in the United States should speak English.
Goundie plans to speak with all parties in
this incident, and notes that the student who
made the remarks has already apologized to
the students speaking Spanish. But Goundie
said the comment was "also an offense to the
whole community."
The incident outside of Mary Lyon would
also not be considered harassing speech, according to the guidelines in the Student Handbook, because it was not repeated; thus, the
perpetrator will not be adjudicated, according to Goundie. "Under our current policy, as
inappropriate and unwarranted as those comments were, it would fall under the category
offree speech, although I would call it offensive," Goundie said.
There have also been several reports of
harassment directed towards gay and lesbian
students on campus, according to Josh Freker
'99, co-cordinator of the Swarthmore Queer
Union. Students report being accosted and
addressed both directly and indirectly with
derogatory terms such as "faggot" and
"homo." This has happened in class, at parties, and outside a dorm. According to Mark

Boulos '9B, one student told another student
he planned to beat up a third student.
The Task Force on Speech and Academic
C ommunity at Swarthmore's report set out
College guidelines for identifying and dealing with "harassing expression" on campus.
The report, found in its entirety on page 4
of The Phoenix, represents the culmination of
over two years of work by the Task Force.
"What we were concerned about is the
limits and responsibilities of expression on
campus," said Hans Oberdiek, chair of the
Task Force, and professor of philosophy.
Previously, the College's guidelines on harassment appeared in the Student Handbook.
The guidelines in the Student Handbook
specify that speech must be directed at an
individual, be degrading and demeaning, and
be repeated or persistent.
This task force was created two years ago
after a rash of offensive graffiti appeared on
campus. "The main event that pushed the
College to thinkin gabout this more was in the
spring of 1995," said Goundie. "Chalked on
Magill walk were the words 'Fuck niggers.'
Obviously, the community reacted to this.
African-American students staged a silent
sit-in in frontof the Admissions Office. They
also did a silent march around campus."

Election ’96

"We tried to fold [hate speech] into harassment," said Oberdiek
The major change in this stance is that
speech no longer needs to be directed at an
individual. The report reads, "If expression
that would be regarded as harassing if directed at an individual is directed at a group—where no individuals are specifically named
or referred to as targets—any member of that
group will have an adjudicable complaint
only if it can be established that a reasonable
person would regard that offending expression as harassing each and every member of
the group as individuals."
Another of the major points in the report is
that the administration wants to ensure that
dialogue on campus is open and that harassment or harassing expressions are not quietly
resolved, but rather addressed openly and
discussed by the College community.
Lythcott's all-campus e-mail following the
epithet written outside ofParrishFifth was an
attempt to begin this form of dialogue.
The report is directed primarily towards
students. Oberdiek said, "The particular lan-

Wednesday night, less than a week
before the election, five members of
the Political Science Department led a
spirited and often contentious forum
entitled, "The Election of 1996: Everything You Always Wanted to Ask."
Fielding questions from the audience as well as from Associate Professor Carol NackenofF s AmericanElections class, the faculty focused primarily on the state of the major political
parties and the ways in which this
election might change party dynamics.
First among the topics of discussion
was the American tendency to elect a
President of one party and a Congress
of the other, which is likely to happen
next week. Echoing a theme ofProfessor CharlesO. Jones' lecture last week,
Professor Richard Rubin argued that
we as American voters "don't know
enough about what we really want to
trust one party or another." Nackenoff
added that although such split government is clearly not a form of checks
and balances intended by the framers
of the Constitution, she detects a definite "post-Watergate suspicion ofgovernment" at work in our national indecision.
The next round of questions the audience raised concerned the capacity
of third parties to garner significant
support and influence the national political agenda, which Reform Party
candidate Ross Perot has not been able
to do this year as effectively as he did
in 1992. Most of the panel agreed with
Professor Ken Sharpe that, for better
or for worse, "there is a structural
impossibility that a third party could
ever be very important" in our winnertake-all electoral structure. Drawing
on Perot's experience, they conceded
that third parties could raise vital issues during the campaign, but they
concluded that these issues would
eventually be co-opted by the major
parties. With an eye on the current
situation, Nackenoff suggested that a
"middle-of the road" party, situated
between the increasingly religious right
and the traditionally liberal left, may
be forming in the years to come.
Finally, they spoke on the possible
outcomes of a second Clinton term. As
Assistant Professor Cynthia Halpern
noted, liberals everywhere are hoping
that Clinton has not decided permanently to disavow the liberal label.
Rubin emphasized his faith in Clinton's
commitment to civil rights and race
issues, but admitted that, as a candidate forre-election, Clinton often cannot be "singularly liberal." They all
seemed to agree that if he wins, Clinton will need to re-establish his party' s
position; Sharpe went as far as to say
that he and his fellow Democrats must
be willing "to stake out a principled
position and argue and defend it even
when they're in the minority."

bal," Goundie said.

guage applies only to students. However, the
principles and criteria, as used, apply to faculty, staff, and students. The procedures [of
adjudication] would be quite different, depending on the constituency."
If it is approved by the CPC and other
authorities, this report will become a part of
the staff, faculty, and student handbooks. In
order to get into the faculty handbook, the
report must be voted on and passed by the
faculty. Oberdiek was not sure about the
complete process for inclusion in the student
and staff handbooks.
This report will probably not cause any
sudden change in College policy. "Problems
with harassing expressions is that they tend to
be anonymous." said Oberdiek. "We don't
anticipate many cases, since perpetrators are
almost always anonymous.
"I think that as the College becomes more
culturally diverse, tensions and pressures become more acute than whenthere was a more
homogeneous student body. I think it is important that the College makes clear what it
permits and doesn't permit. We want to make
sure that we protect the College as a place
where even the most offensive ideas are heard,
but that people can exist at this College without being harassed."

At 411 students, this year's first-year class
is much larger than was anticipated. The
senior class, which originally had 417 members and now has 398, is also quite large;
together, the two classes contribute to
Swarthmore' s having its biggest student body
ever. This fact, as well as Swarthmore's recent #1 ranking in U.S. News and World
Report, points to a definite change in the
admissions process for next year.
"This year's first-year class numbered 411;
we had been aiming for 365," said Robin
Mamlet, dean of admissions. "In terms of
how we handle things in the Admissions
Office, I think we will need to be aware that
Swat's popularity seems to be on therise, and
that more students may accept our offer of
admission than have in the past few years."
According to Mamlet, inquiries about the
College are up considerably. When asked
how the Admissions Office would handle a
surge in the number of applications, Mamlet
said that Swarthmore may offer fewer applicants admission, and then turn to the alternate
list to "bring up the class to theright number."
"The President's staff," she explained,
"along with consultation from several campus committees, sets the size of each year's
incoming class, and we have yet to do that.
My best guess at this point is that we will aim
for roughly the usual size, give or take."
So far thenumber of early admission applications is not higher than last year; however,
last year at this time, Swarthmore was behind
in applications, but ended up with the most in
the history of the College.
"Admissions is a dicey business," she
added. "It's justtoo early on to state with any

confidence at all what may happen."
Susan Untereker, director of admissions,
pointed out that while applications have been
slowly accumulating, it is still hard to tell
exactly how many people will apply. "October is too early to set the size of the anticipated class," she said.
Nonetheless, when asked about her feelings about S warthmore' s recent # 1 ranking in
U.S. News and World Report, Untereker admitted that it would most likely have some
bearing on the size of this year's applicant
pool, she said "I think any kind of national
publicity is going to make us at least as
popular as we were last year."
According to both Untereker and Mamlet,
the Admissions Office has seen more., .more
people on overnights, more tours, and more
interviews. In addition, tours have gotten
larger, and there is now a wait list for interviews— despite the fact that Admissions has
hired three additional part-time interviewers.
"The deans are telling us that more kids are
coming to their [high school] visits,"
Untereker added, citing another indication of
S warthmore's increasingpopularity. "It's too
early to say, but I would think we will have to
do something to make sure this class isn't too
large."
Chris DiLeo '99, one of Swarthmore's two
coordinators of overnight visits, believes that
Swarthmore has tried to increase its visibility, as far as name recognition is concerned—that it has tried to "pump up its advertising a
little bit." He also points out that there has
been a steady increase in the number of overnights and a growing amount ofinterest in the
school, in general. "I definitely think the
[U.S. News and World Report] rating is going
to drive people to Swarthmore," he said.
AnneFrankenfield '99, the other overnight
coordinatorfor the Admissions Office, agreed
with DiLeo. She said the school is more
widely known now, and a lot more people are
talking about it. "I think the rating has a lot to
do with it," she said.

Jessica Harbour

A recent incident involving Phoenix Circulation Manager Patrice Harper '99 at Strath
Haven Condominiums has raised questions
about the interactions of Swarthmore students and non-student residents living there.
On Thursday, October 24, Harper and Shola
Abidoye '97 approached the front door to the
condominiums, where Harper is a resident.
While digging for her copy of the black
electronic key which opens the front door
(roomkeys are kept separately), Harper asked
another resident, a white woman, to hold the
door open for her. The woman refused on the
grounds that management policy forbids residents' to hold the door open for others. When
Harper tried to explain she was also a resident, the woman replied that she would not
feel comfortable letting them in and closed
the door. "For me," said Abidoye, "it was
pretty obvious that this woman felt we were
a threat to her." Both Abidoye and Harper are

African-American.
Once inside, Abidoye said she thought the
woman's actions racist, whereupon the
woman became very upset. Abidoye and
Harper then went to Harper's room. Soon

afterwards, a security guard appeared at
Harper's door and asked if she had made a
racist remark to the woman. Harper, in turn,
asked him what information the woman had
given him that would lead him to her door.
The guard reminded her of Strath Haven's
non-discriminatory policy and left. In an interview yesterday, Dee Carey, manager of
Strath Haven Condominiums, said, "All that
was said to College personnel was that the
security guard had observed what tookplace";
she said she had not known of the guard's
visit to Harper's room.
Carey notified Facilities Manager Alice
Balbierer of the incident when Balbierer visited the condominiums the following day.
Balbierer referred her to Myrt Westphal, director ofresidential life, but as of yesterday,
Westphal had not spoken directly to Carey
and was in the process of setting up a meeting
with Harper. According to Balbierer, the
womin complained that Harper and Abidoye
had prevented her from accessing the elevator, a charge they deny.
The following Monday, October 28, Kate
Walker '97, the Strath Haven RA, called
Harper to tell her the College had been notified; she discussed with Harper the possibility of Harper's apologizing to the other resident. "We were told that Patrice and her
companion had somehow prevented the other

resident from getting on the elevator," Walker
explained. "Just going on those grounds, we
thought Patrice and her friend were in the
wrong...which was definitely wrong to assume." Harper was outraged: "Ifthere should
be any apology, it should be to me."
This was, Harper and Abidoye said, the
most serious incident of apparent racism they
have encountered, but not the first. Abidoye
spoke of traveling in an elevator with a man
who asked her if she was "the new secretary,"
while Harper said African-American friends
who have come to visit her have been asked
if they were cleaning people. "No matter
what you do," she concluded, "people can't
get past the c010r...1 really didn't come to
college to experience this kind of stuff." Said
Abidoye, "I've been here for four years and
I've never experienced anything like this
[incident]."
Harper's complaint about the door, however, has been reiterated by other students
living in Strath Haven. Maria McMath '99
said, "Most of the residents.. .do not want us
there and will close the door in your face if
you do not have your key out." Added Jenna
Tiitsman '99, a bit more lightheartedly, "I've
had more than one resident lock the door
behind them while I search frantically for my
missing key!" This opinion was seconded by
Paul Aslanian, vice president for finance and
planning, who has lived in Strath Haven for
the past 13 months, concurred, noting that
other residents have denied him access even
when he was "struggling with grocery bags"
or carrying a suitcase after returning from out
of town.

"On a routine check of Bond at 1:50 p.m. on Sunday, October 10, one of our officers
observed glass on the ground justbelow the tower (courtyard side). Further investigation found
six panes of glass broken out of the Caritas' room and two window screens torn," reported
Owen Redgrave, director of Public Safety. No evidence was found at the scene of the crime
and nothing was reported missing from the room. Redgrave said it was "possible" that this
incident could be related to recent occurrences on campus (the Parrish vandalism or the
Sharpies window breakings), but there were "no links or leads at this point."
Pauline Allen, Protestant religious advisor, said, "I feel sad that someone would want to do

assertiveness and humor
By Abigail Schade

On Wednesday evening, Professor Mary
Crawford of West Chester University gave a
lecture entitled "Talking Difference," sponsored by the Psychology Department and the
programs in women's studies and linguistics.
Crawford, a psychologist by training and
sociolinguist by professional interest, discussed two important aspects of speech discourse which carry gender "tags" in our society: assertiveness and humor. She began by
bringing up the concept of a role in social
situations, and questioning how people enact
their own gender and power when they talk to
others.
Explaining that the common notion of "assertion" and assertive personality types is
actually a recent construct, Crawford recounted a brief history of the self-help popular psychology movement for women. In the
early 1970'5, literature describing the social
problems resulting from a lack of personal
assertion flooded magazines and bookstores.
By 1985, over 1,000 works about assertion
and effective speaking have been written,
targeted mainly at women, with the goal of

Voice Mail System Down on Tuesday
This week, the campus voice mail system suffered an outage. Community members
attempting to check their mail were greeted by either an error message or an odd tone.
Voice messages are saved on multiple drives and one of these stopped working. The system
was taken off-line for several hours Tuesday evening in an attempt to repair the system.
The drive's controller card seemed to be the faulty part and was replaced on Tuesday. The
drive was testedand it appeared to workfine. As a precautionary measure, thedrive will be used
as a "read-only" drive for about a week which will allow users to fetch any messages in the
system. The status will then bere-evaluated. Bob Velez, a Telcom representative, summed
the situation up by saying, "No messages were lost and everything looks fine for now."

Housing Committee Discussed ML Improvements
The Housing Committee discussed suggestions forboth long and short-term maintenance
plans on Monday.
In terms of worthwhile projects, the committee decided, first of all, that Mary Lyon
Residence Hall requires serious attention at this point in time. Because of Mary Lyon's
location, the committee proposed ways of making the dorm more desirable. Among suggestions for improvement were new furniture, better lighting in lounges and hallways, and a
possible computer space in the basement lounge.
In the future, the committee would like to see new lighting and furniture in Worth, as well
as uniform window coverings. They also determinedthatDana and Hallowell dormitoriesneed
new plumbing as well as new carpeting once the plumbing situation has been corrected.
Lastly, the committee recommended upgrading the laundry facilities in all of theresidence
halls by adding more washers and driers, possibly of higher quality, and providing ironing
equipment for every dormitory. They also hope to see the new wooden-frame beds and
furniture filtered into all residence halls.
The final meeting of the semester will be Monday, November 4 at 7:00 p.m. in the Parrish
third floor classroom. The meeting is open to all students; the committee plans to discuss
maintenance issues, lottery procedures, and how the current housing crunch has affected
residential life.
and renovation

empowerment.
Crawfordcriticized this as a "man-as-norm,
woman-as-problem" style of research.
Through self-help books, workshops, and
seminars, women were taught to improve the
effectiveness of their communication skills
by addressing problems, desires, and questions directly with an "'I-me' sentence structure." The "I-me" type of speech is usually
associated with male patterns of discourse,
whereas women provide a more supporting
and indirect role in conversation.
According to Crawford, assertiveness training techniques operated on the assumption
that women had a communication deficiency,
which resulted in their lower status in social
situations. However, Crawford insisted that
"Women as a group are not less competent
communicators than men as a group."
"Assertiveness," as defined by what
Crawford calls the "Assertiveness Training
Bandwagon," is characterized as being clear,
forceful, direct, individualistic, and dominant. Crawford noted that these traits closely
overlap withthe sexual stereotypes of masculinity that existed when the movement started,
and accuses assertiveness training advocates
of a "naive belief in sex differences," without
the appropriate research to support this belief.
The lecture went on to examine the popular
conceptions of the assertion literature. Asserfion has become a valued trait in society, and

is necessary to be perceived as competent.
Although men are accepted when they are
perceived as competent, women are held to
both standards of competence and "likability." In becoming assertive, women are forced
to walk the line between assertion and aggression.
Crawford also criticized the unnatural aspect of the constructed speech of assertion,
saying that people on the "receiving end" of
what often sounds like an assertively broken
record do not appreciate the new style of
speech, which is stripped of the naturally
developed idiosyncrasies and mechanisms of
human interaction. A resulting communication breakdown proves the very ineffectiveness of "effective speech."
Crawford noted thatboth asserti veness and
humor are commonly considered to be male
traits in our society, although both men and
women have equally developed styles of assertion and humor. Both women and,men
consider women to be less likely to get ajoke,
deliver a good punch line, or use humor in a
way that improves overall communication.
She believes that this is because humor is
"subversive" in its ability to lighten a difficult situation, and the opportunity for subversion is mainly open to the people who already
control the course of the conversation (men,
according to the assertion model). This explains the phenomenon of women who are
incredibly funny among themselves.

Speaker Tackles Abortion Issues
By

Toki Rehder

Carole Joffe, professor of sociology and
women's studies at the University ofCalifornia at Davis, gave a talk entitled "Doctors of
Conscience: Abortion Before and After Roe
v. Wade" on Monday afternoon. Joffe spoke
of the current inaccessibility ofabortion services in the United States.
Today, 86 percent of U.S. counties lack
abortion providers. According to Joffe, this is
due to the marginalization of abortion providers by the medical community. Even
though more than 80 percent of physicians
believe abortion should be legal, abortion
training is not regularly provided for residents in obstetrics and gynecology. Also,
abortion procedures, which are simple and
routine, do not provide doctors with desired
opportunities forresearch and career advancement. There are few professional incentives
to provide abortions.

Borough Teen Passes Out on Parrish Beach
Two underage females were escorted off the Swarthmore campus by Swarthmore Borough
Police on Thursday evening at 9:35 p.m. One needed an ambulance due to excessive
consumption of alcohol. Their names and ages were not disclosed, though one officer
commented that they were "extremely underage... they looked about 16 years old to me." The
individuals were drinking in the Crum, according to Jude Uzonwanne '9B. One of the
individuals, who had apparently drunk more thanher companion, passed out on Parrish Beach,
after reportedly asking for a lighter and taking off various pieces of clothing.

Chris DiLeo and Josh Kramer contributed to these Briefs.

According to Joffe, abortion doctors have
also been stigmatized by pro-choice and prolife rhetoric whichlabeled pre-1973 abortion
providers as "back-alley butchers." Although
many women were injured or died at the
hands of inept practitioners, Joffe points out
that there were other abortion providers. Respected members of the medical profession,
motivated by "compassion for women," risked
their careers by performing abortions before
abortion was legalized by the Supreme Court
decision Roe v. Wade in 1973.
The marginalization and stigmatization of
abortion doctors is today compounded with
the anti-abortion terrorism of right-wing
groups. Joffe describes this violence as "a
recent phenomenon." Not until around 1987
did killings, firebombings, and intimidation
become methods used by extremists in the
right-to-life movement.
Joffe is "cautiously optimistic" about the
future of women's right to choose. She is

encouraged by the "extraordinary mobiliza-

tion of medical students across the country"
in response to recent violence. Joffe hopes
increased education will make women aware
of their options. These options include the
"morning-after pill," RU-486, and other drugs
which provide nonsurgical ways to induce
abortion.
Joffe's lecture was based upon her most
recent book, Doctors of Conscience: The
Struggle to Provide Abortion Before and After Roe v. Wade (1995) and was co-sponsored by the Biology Department, the Health
Science Advisors Office, and the Sociology/
Anthropology Department.
On thiscampus, the Pro-Choice TaskForce
is actively engaged in educating students
about various contraception methods and
abortion procedures. Students are currently
being trained to offer confidential Pregnancy
Options Counseling. For more information,

cept for Walker. Still, the emphasis on regu-

lated conduct at Strath Haven has led to some
tension, as described by James Harris '99:
"When we walk around the halls here, it
seems like everyone is watching us, waiting
for us to break one of the many rules they
have for conduct in the building.. .The room
is nice and I like living here, but there is some
uneasiness as well."
According to Walker, the College's initial
reaction to a report of the incident was one of
alarm, since "they've been nervous about
students living here."
"We expected some friction," Westphal
admitted. "We can't initiate an educational
program for all the residents on what is sensitive behavior...We have less control over
the environment" than if the students were
living in trailer housing or an ordinary residence hall. "It's a mixture of the outside
world and Swat."
In preparation for the move, she, Associate
Dean Tedd Goundie, Carey, Balbierer and
Walker met to discuss possible problems
before the students moved in on August 30.
As of yet, it is not clear whether any action
will be taken by either the College or by
Strath Haven concerning this incident. Carey
said that Strath Haven management has not
filed an official complaint, and Westphal did
not wantto speculate on what possible action
might be taken until she had met with Harper
and learned what happened firsthand.

Several students said they have met many
non-student residents who have welcomed
them with open arms. "I think people were
somewhat distrustful initially," said Walker,
"but have found out that we are civil, responsible people." Tiitsman noted, "The
security and other residents are the least
problematic elements of living here. The
residents have been fairly friendly and I
think have gotten a kick out of us wandering around in our pajamas on Sunday mornings." Harper agreed: "There are quite a
few residents who say they like having
youth there because it makes them feel
young again." Aslanian once asked a security guard in the building, "So how is it with
those college kids here?" The guard responded, '"Those are really good kids.'"
The majority of Strath Haven residents,
according to Westphal, are longtime Swarthmoreresidents who have retired and sold
their homes. "Demographically, it's definitely skewed toward the senior citizen,"
she said. In part because ofits demographic
makeup, Strath Haven is "a community
with a very strong sense ofrules and regulations." Before students moved in, they
were sent a summary of what rules to expect. "Management was not averse to our
putting students in there," said Westphal.
The College owns the apartments, traditionally used for guest housing; now four-

In an attempt to make our editorials more representative, we had a two-week
open application period for theEditorial Board. And we succeeded: its size and
diversity both grew. As with any situation at Swarthmore, with more voices,
we now have a new problem—conflict of opinion.
This week, we felt it timely to comment upon the report released by the CPC
Task Force on Speech and the Academic Community. Because of the pertinence of this issue, we are including more than one perspective on the report’s
attempt to deal with harassing speech. As we are specifically addressing
whether it is fair to limit freedom of speech in any situation, we felt it would
then be hypocritical to limit our comments to a single overarching opinion.
As always, our editorials continue to be unsigned. The editorialsreflect the
voice of theBoard as a whole and cannot be attributed to any single member.

The Right of Expression at Swarthmore
We admire the attempt of the Task Force to walk the fine line between
protecting freedom of speech and freedom from harassment. Their document
attempts to reconcile the seemingly contradictory goals of encouraging “respect and civility” without stifling “vigorous and controversial discussion and

debate.”
The document does not specifically protect members of historically disadvantaged groups. The universal language seeks to protect all members of the
College community from harassing speech. Racist, sexist, and homophobic
speech is not specifically prohibited unless it is also threatening, fraudulent, or
harassing speech.
But would the interests of the Swarthmore community be served by allowing
all forms of expression, with the hope that targets of the hate speech and other
students will counter this speech with their own, thereby educating the
campus? This is the question the TaskForce seeks toresolve by outlining strict
requirements for what constitutes harassing expression. This caution is warranted, yet it is important to begin to define which kinds of speech are
unacceptable. This report operates on the premise that speech is also conduct,
in that “we do things with words.” Words that do not seek to promote
reasonable debate and civil discourse, but which instead cause repeated harm
and degradation to individuals, should not be tolerated. The operating ideal of
this document, which is an admirable one, is to “create and sustain a setting
where students, faculty, and staff can pursue life at Swarthmore free from
hatred, slurs, and vilification.”
But what happens after an incident of hate speech not subject to adjudication? Recently a slur against gays and lesbians which read “flick homos” was
painted outside of Parrish Fifth. Dean Ngina Lythcott promptly informed the
College community of this graffiti without describing its specific content. We
understand that she did not want to want to repeat these hurtful words, but
shouldn’t the College community be aware of what has been “said” in a public
space? Does the community as a whole have any say in labeling harmful
speech? Did the method in which this was handled stifle controversy and
prevent discussion?
After incidents of hate speech occur, we believe thatdebate and discussion
should be encouraged. This incident could provide a good opportunity to
discuss the appropriate mechanisms of dealing with this kind of speech. We
believe that students have every right to be angry about this anonymous
derogatory expression, and that the perpetrators should be aware of this.
It was refreshing earlier this week to see Dean Lythcott’s quick response to
the homophobic remark spray-painted on Parrish. On its heels comes the
release of the report of the TaskForce. The report holds the potential to lay the
foundation for institutional support of hate speech victims. Unfortunately, it
centers its focus upon the perpetrators rather than the victims, devoting the
majority of its space to stringent guidelines which must be met before an act
can be considered by the College Judiciary Committee and the Equal Opportunity Office. The report’s cautious tone appears to stem from the possibility
of infringement upon what the Task Force perceives as the College’s core
ideals: “Before any expression can be considered for possible adjudication, it
must be clear that no substantial free expression interests are threatened.”
An expression not only has to be established as “harassing” by “reasonable”
individuals, but it must also have been “repeated and persisted” as well as
“brought to the attention of the defendant” in order to be adjudicated. In
addition, for an act aimed at a group of people to be deemed harassment, “it
(must) be established that a reasonable person would regard that offending
expression as harassing each and every member of the group as individuals."
Plagiarism, on the other hand, is sent directly to the C.J.C. What institutional
ethics is the College projecting when it appears to privilege plagiarism over
hate speech? Of course it is a greater legal challenge to uphold hate speech
codes thanpenalties for academic honesty, but if the College wants to cultivate
a comfortable learning environment, it must do more than simply hand out
penalties. Reducing hate speech involves open dialogue, which is better
facilitated in small groups than in College-wide collections.
It could be argued that any limitation on speech will open the floodgates for
censorship, but the premise of such a claim rests on the assumption that every
member of society has equal access to free speech. Unfortunately, our society
is ridden with racial and gender inequalities tied to ongoing historical processes which cannot be remedied by simply declaring “freedom of speech.”
Freedom implies free will. It is wrong to apply such a term to the verbalization
of epithets which hold power over groups of people who have never been able
to decide whether or not they want to accept the epithets’ stigmas. If this were
the case, Swarthmore’s African-American students wouldn’t have minded
when “Fuck niggers” was scrawled across Magill Walk severalyears ago. The
incident could have been casually dismissed as another reactionary student
misdirecting his or heranger. Until widespread equality is achieved outside the
university, it is unrealistic to pretend historically opressed groups have the
same access to “free speech” as whites.
The option may not appear politically viable, but the College must take a
side on this issue. Swarthmore can either helpremedy legacies of prejudice by
establishing clear policy which advocates the concerns and dignity of people
of color, women, and queers, or it can perpetuate the power structure of a
society in which white males still hold a disproportionate amount of power.
Someform of institutional recourse must be established. Suspension should
be avoided because it tends to diminish dialogue. Mediation is a viable
alternative in that it forces the perpetrator to face his or her victim and can open
channels ofcommunication. Before any change takes place, the College needs
to take more action than simply suggesting an annual committee to respond to
hate speech, which minimizes its role: “Fortunately, Swarthmore does not
sufferfrommany instances of fraudulent or offensive expression, so time spent
should not be onerous.” After a week in which multiple incidents seemingly
sparked by hate have occurred on campus, we should reconsider such an
optimistic evaluation.

In 1992, then-presidential-candidate Bill Clinton promised to "end
welfare as we know it." In doing so,
he put the decades-old entitlement
program under the microscope of
nearly everyone actively engaged in
politics. This campaign promise

exercised
wise judgment and political acumen by vetoing the conservative attempt to decrease the program's ability to assist

the poor in this country drastically.
Two years later, he immediately
made clear his intention to sign the
legislation which would effectively
end the federal guarantee of monetary assistance to the poor. In other
words, he would end welfare as we

Meanwhile, conservatives lauded the

Initially, I found myself in the
former category, criticizing Bill
Clinton's actions and questioning his
loyalties to the traditionalbase ofhis
own party. However, I now find myself not as disapproving of the decision but for much different reasons
than those put forth by many Republicans. Some basic understandings of
the nature of poverty and the conditions within which it festers, coupled
with the inadequacy of welfare to
address these complex realities (due
to various political and economic reasons) led me to my conclusion.
When you think about it, welfare
merely maintains poverty rather than
pro-actively working to eliminate it.
For instance, one million children
may fall underthe poverty line due to
this legislation. I asked my liberal
compatriots, "how far above the line
were they in the first place?"
In most cases, these children and
their families survived with income
and welfare assistance which made
them only marginally better. Moreover, the majority of children
benefittedby welfare lacked the ability to improve their condition due to

There is a fundamental difference
between the way in which Republicans and Democrats view the role of
the government in the everyday lives
of Americans. From the conservative
standpoint, "a little goes a long way."
And as Senator Bob Dole stated in
the first presidential debate, "I trust
the people [to carry out their own
matters], the President trusts the government." This statement, which captures the Republican view, redefines
governmental bureaucracy so that
Americans will pay less in tax and
enjoy a broader sense of freedom.
Incorporating Senator Dole's proposed agenda, I will discuss some
key issues which clearly define this
conservative view.
1) Taxes: Do you want to have
more money in you own pocket or
would you prefer the government to
consume your hard-earned tax dollars in its endless bureaucracy and
red tape? My philosophy is that the
private sector can do things much
more efficiently than the government.
Since each person has a vested interest in his own activities, he should be
able to spend his money in whatever
manner he wishes. This is something
toward which, regardless of party alliance, we should all be striving. The
allocation of tax dollars to wasteful
government agencies is not what we
want after we pay a considerable portion of our paychecks to the government. Thus, reducing taxes will in
turn empower all Americans and
make the United States more prosperous. So, by giving an across-theboard 15 percent tax cut and $5OO-tax credit, Bob Dole would
indeed put more decision-making
power back into the hands of the
average American. The big question
is: How he is going to pay for it
without "blowing a hole in the deficit," as Clinton would say. He intends to cut spending from 20 percent
to 14 percent in the next six years,
and, through a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution, he
will attain a balanced budget by 2002.
If all went well, Americans would
have lower taxes and a balanced budget. What more could we want out of
our government?
2) Education: School choice should
be a top priority. When I say school
choice, I do not mean public school
choice, but rather the option of any
school, public or private. Dole's proposed opportunity scholarships,
which wouldbe funded by the money
that nowruns the Department ofEducation, are a way for low to lowmiddle-income Americans to send
their children to the better schools.
This policy would improve the quality of existing schools, since they
would be in a competitive market and
ensure that only schools with a high
standard would exist. This is not
purely a matter of academic quality,
though. Some schools in inner cities
are not safe and the opportunity scholarship program would allow parents

formation-based, technology-driven,
global economy. In other words, the
structural limitations largely responsible for the marginal conditions of
many Americans would be eliminated or severely debilitated. This

would also eliminate the use of welfare recipients (especially Black
women) as punching bags in the political discourse.
Conservatives can no longer blame
poverty on poor people. They do not
have dependency on welfare to use to
explain the rising poverty rate in this
country. Now, Republicans will have
a more difficult time ignoring the
role of others in perpetuating poverty.
These possibilities would not have
been possible without the President
fulfilling his pledge to "end welfare
as we know it," and they will not
manifest themselves without applying pressure to the necessary political
entities.
Instead of complaining about the
specifics ofClinton's welfarereform
bill, pressure Congress to maintain
the integrity of the Earned Income
Tax Credit, which has already been
demonstrated to improve conditions
for those whose incomes from work
fall below the poverty line. Or encourage school systems to improve
their quality of instruction by raising
standards. Lobby to increase teacher
salaries, to better prepare all public
school students for high-skilled jobs
and to implement other reforms in a
wide variety of areas. Basically, critically analyze the true nature of poverty and work to attack the phenomenon at its source, instead of crying
over spilled milk.

Counterpoint

Dole's agenda weds freedom and efficiency...
By

substandard school systems, little or
no viable job opportunities, poor access to adequate health care and high
crime levels in their neighborhoods.
The small amount ofmoney given to
these individuals through AFDC and
othermeans-tested welfare programs
could not possibly address the myriad
problems recipients must face on a
daily basis.
Since the Republican-controlled
Congress, with the assistance of the
Clinton administration, "reformed"
welfare, the country has finally begun to discuss implementing policy
that attacks the true sources ofurban
decay and poverty. The new legislation mandates that states move welfare recipients to gainful employment within a certain time period.
Although this task presents many
difficulties and seems impossible
without other actions, such effort
could stimulate improvements in education in poor school districts, lure
companies back into the inner cities,
and encourage greater investment in
infrastructure and human resources
throughout the nation.
All of these efforts would enable
current welfare recipients to effectively compete in today's highly in-

to send their children to an environment more conducive to learning.

Such a policy would again put money
back into the hands ofAmericans and
give them choices on how to gain the
best results.
3) Affirmative Action: In an age
when our society has become and
will increasingly become more global, we need to eliminate policies
which give preferences on the basis
of race, color, ethnicity, or gender.
As Dole said in his speech on affirmative action on Monday, "We cannot fight the evil of discrimination
with more discrimination, because
this leads to an endless cycle of bitterness." Instead, we shouldfocus on
meritandpass federal legislation comparable to the Civil Rights Initiative
209 on Californians' ballots. If we
wantto promote diversity, fine. However, we should promote this diversity in the form of thought. We can
also discuss affirmative action in
terms of economics. If we would aid
economically disadvantaged Americans to gain equal footing with their
counterparts in the middle and upper
classes, we would not create the racial polarizations in our society that
the current system triggers. Remember, America should be a land of
equal opportunity, not one of equal
outcomes.
4) Firearms: The U.S. Constitution

gives all law-abiding citizens the
"right to bear arms." Clinton, by passing the Brady Bill and the Assault
Weapon Ban, thought that he would
remove the guns from the hands of
criminals. However, this has not
turned out to be true. Many of the
weapons banned under these laws
have been reintroduced into the market by conforming to the stipulations
of the laws. These guns are as lethal
as before and once again legal. So,
what did these laws do? Bob Dole
pointed out in the first presidential
debate that only one prosecution has
occurred under the Assault Weapon
Ban and only seven as a result of the
Brady Bill. So if these bills are as
effective as Clinton claims, why have
their impacts been so marginal? Instead of such laws thatcould prove to
be lax in the long run, Senator Dole
has proposed an automated check
system. This plan, which is already
being used in 17 states, would include a national database containing
names of individuals who cannot
purchase guns. Truly such a system
would prevent criminals from getting the guns and help our communities become safer.
With increasing decision making
power by reducing taxes, removing
financial boundaries to high quality
education, abolishing race and gender based preferences, and ensuring
that criminals cannot buy firearms,
the Republican platform promotes an
augmentation of individual rights for
all Americans by redefining the
government's role. Hopefully, on
Election Day, the American people
will vote Republican for precisely
this reason.

but Clinton keeps the collective good in mind.
By Sylvia

Weedman

In much of his campaigning this
year Bob Dole has focused on the
"individual," demanding individual
responsibility and celebrating individual freedoms. He seems to define
America as a space in which millions
of individuals live, work, and raise
their families in self-contained, selfsufficient bubbles. After the Republicans won both houses of Congress
in 1994, they sparked a debate so
elemental that it divided the populace, closed the federal government,
and even overwhelmed this year's
presidential campaign. The debate,
of course, is over the fundamental
role of our government today. Dole
maintains that the role of the public
sector is to celebrate the individual.
In stark contrast, President Clinton
acknowledges the existence of the
collective. He recognizes that Americans can have neither individual responsibility nor individual freedom
without the collective measures of a
federal government. An individual is
not responsible for her lack of education if she has grown up in an area
with very poor schools, and an individual is not free if he is hurt by a
drive-by shooting. Government exists because, without it, people could
not individually exercise their freedom and responsibility without detrimentally affecting the national community. I will look at four specific
areas in which we need to be engaged
as a collective: taxes, education, affirmative action, and gun control. I
will then look at the ways in which
PresidentClinton believes these problems should and should not be addressed.
Dole has clearly made taxes his
issue in this campaign. Speaking in
triplicate, he cautioned voters not to
forget what this election is all about,
saying, "It's your money! It's your
money! It's your money!" Dole's
proposed 15 percent tax cut across
the board will indeed save wealthy
people a lot ofmoney, and will even
save middle class people a little, but
it will do so at the expense of public
programs for everyone else. It's clear
that you can't both balance the budget and reduce taxes without cutting
spending, but the largest social spending programs—Medicare and Social
Security—have long been sacrosanct
and will not be drastically cut because they benefit the influential
middle and upper classes. Dole will
find nothing left to cut but programs
for the poor and for children. It may
be a tax break for all, but only the less
fortunate would get broken.
Clinton, on the other hand, is in
favor of what he calls "targeted" tax
cuts, which are specifically intended
to ease the middle class's tax burden
to make it easier to finance education
for their children. These cuts allow
individuals to save money for education without bankrupting our social
programs. Clinton recognizes that
Dole's watered-down"trickle-down"
theories can do no collective good.

On the topic of education, the two
candidates differ just as profoundly.
While Dole advocates diverting
money from our public schools for
his "schoolchoice" programs, Clinton
has launched a great initiative to guarantee that young people learn to read
and to utilize informationtechnology
within the public school system. Under Dole's plan, the Department of
Education would be abolished outright, and the savings would pay for
any private school educationthat parents choose. Because such a per-studentcredit would not cover the entire
cost of most private schools, the plan
would siphon out wealthier students
from the public schools in a metaphorical flight to the suburbs. Dole
seems to insist that members of a
community have no responsibility for
children that are not theirs, but Clinton
knows that "it takes a village."
The contentious issue of affirmative action perhaps best encapsulates
the debate over the role of government today. Clinton has suggested
over and again that we should "mend
it, not end it" by eliminating fraud in
the system while re-dedicating ourselves to its purposes. Though Dole
favors eliminating it entirely so as
not to make workers today pay for
our national mistakes of the past,
Clinton understands that mistaken
racial policies of the past are still
affecting people today.
For instance, women and minorities were not regularly admitted to
Ivy League schools 30 years ago—thus, 50 year old women and minorities still cannot be judgedby the same
educational criteria as white men. In
order to have equal opportunities collectively, Clinton is in favor ofretaining affirmative action law.
Finally, I would like to look at the
issue of gun control. The candidates
have agreed that background checks
should be conducted on anyone who
wants to purchase a handgun. They
disagree, however, about which
weapons should be illegal. Clinton
negotiated a ban on assault rifles
which Dole has said he would like to
repeal. Clearly, the Constitution guarantees our right to bear arms, but do
any arms count? I am quite certain
that it is illegal to own and operate
one's own intercontinental ballistic
missiles. For these reasons, the Assault Weapons Ban is among those
pieces of legislation that can protect
our collective interests.
This is an era of cutting the budget,
reducing the deficit, and eliminating
government waste. The ethos of the
era has influenced Republicans and
Democrats alike so much that even
Clinton is prone to boast. The federal
government, he says, is smaller than
it has been since the Kennedy Administration, and the deficit has been
cut to half of what it was when he
took office. Clinton has not, however, forgotten the purpose of government. He has affirmed it timeand
again on the campaign trail, and more
importantly, he has affirmed it in his
actions as President.

Rights and Responsibilities of Expression at Swarthmore
The following document is the report of the College Planning Committee Task Force on Speech in the Academic Community. The Task
Force will present a collection on the topic "Hate Speech Revisited" on Friday, November 8 at 1 p.m. in the Friends Meeting House.
Swarthmore Collegeis deeply
committed to free inquiry,
speech, expression, and exchange of ideas. Without this
commitment, the pursuit of
5
truth, exploration of alternate
approaches to knowledge and
art, and broader concerns to educate ourselves about different
10 ways oflife wouldbe deformed.
Free inquiry, speech, expression, and exchange ofideas often lead to controversy. Such
controversies can be fierce and
15 often painful for those who believe—sometimes rightly—that
their views or ways ofexpressing themselves are not given
their due or that cherished con-20 victions are under siege. But no
academic institution can avoid
these dangers. We can hope and
urge, however, that faculty, students, and staff will be civil and
25 treat each another with respect.
For speech is also conduct: we
do things with words. Speech
and other forms of expression
have effects, intended or other-30 wise. Just as we demand that
people take responsibility for
their conduct, so we can demandthat people take responsibility for their speech: freedom
35 is not license. Yet because ofits
commitment to free expression,
the College will regulate speech
or expression [hereafter, expression] only if fraudulent, threat-40 ening, or harassing.

where one lies about or seriously misrepresents authorship
of one'sexpression. Plagiarism,
of course, is one instance. But
there are others. It is forbidden,
for instance, for A to send an email message to B purporting to
be from C or for an individual or
group to place a poster attributing it to another individual or
group. Clearly, some instances
are mere pranks, but many instances can cause serious harm,
so even pranksters must realize
that they run the risk of adjudication for reckless conduct that
causes harm.

Threatening Expression
Expression that credibly
threatens physical violence will
not be tolerated any more than
the College tolerates physical
assault and battery: everyone
has a right to participate in all
aspects of College life without
fear of physical attack. Threatening expression will be inferred
from all the circumstances.

Harassing Expression
The Student Handbook's
Statement ofStudent Rights, Responsibilities, and Code ofConductalready forbids Harassment
(See §ll, C). It needs to be emphasized that harassment can be
and often is non-physical; e.g.,
verbal. This is implied but not
stated explicitly in the Handbook, and we now propose that
the Handbook read "Harassment, verbal or otherwise, is
defined...." This includes
words, pictures, gestures, and
other expression. To count as
harassment, such expression
must be reasonably regarded as
(a) taunting, 1 vilifying 2 or de-

jeering expression.

grading3 whether (b) directed at
individuals or groups [subject
to the clarification and qualification below] and (c) where reasonable people may suppose that
such expression harms its
target(s) by substantially interfering with their educational opportunities, peaceful enjoyment
ofresidence and community, or
terms of employment. Further,
to count as harassment subject
to possible adjudication, such
expression must (d) be taken
either with the intent to interfere with the protected interests
mentioned in (c), above, or with
reckless disregard to the nature
of the conduct. Such intent or
recklessness must be inferred
from all the circumstances. Finally (e), such expression must
be repeated and persistent. To
be "repeated and persistent", the
offending conduct must have
been brought to the attention of
the defendant (though not necessarily by the complainant), be
of the same kind, and repeated.
There are two reasons for adding (e): first, the College wishes
to have the opportunity to educate those who may not realize
that certain expression constitutes harassment; second, by requiring that the expression be
repeated and persistent, theCollege helps establish intent or
recklessness. However: (f) before any expression can be considered for possible adjudication, it must be clear that no
substantial free expression interests are threatened by bringing a formal charge of harassing
expression. This strict criterion
for possible adjudication must
be imposed to insure that the
College does nothing that would
tend to diminish free expression
or compromiseprinciplesof academic freedom in the vigorous
and often contentious examination and criticism ofideas, works
of art, and political activity that
marks Swarthmore College.
Because groupshave been ineluded in (b), above, the following clarification and qualification is in order. If expression
that would be regarded as harassing if directed at an individual is directed at a group—where no individuals are specifically named or referred to as
targets —any member of that
group will have an adjudicable
complaint only ifit can be established that a reasonable person
would regard that offending expression as harassing each and
every member of the group as
individuals. Unlike sexual harassment, which is often though
not exclusively directed at particular individuals, degrading
expression is more often than
not directed at individuals
through their group identity. A
loose analogy with threats may
clarify what is intended: in cases
where someone credibly threatens violence against group X,
reasonable people would be
right to conclude that each and
every member of X has good
reason to believe himself or herself threatened, and thus any
memberof X would have a complaint even though unmentioned
by name and perhaps unknown
to the threatener.

Adjudication

EO Officer determines the offense should be adjudicated, the
case materials must first be reviewed by the faculty members
200 oftheCJC, who shall determine
whether any substantialfree expression issues are at stake. 4 If
the CJC faculty members find
that adjudication of the case
205 would violate individual rights
to free expression or the
College's commitment to academic freedom, the case will
not be heard by the CJC. In-210 stead, the case will be referred
back to the EO officer who may
discuss with the complainant(s)
other options for resolution. If,
on the other hand, it is deter-215 mined by the faculty members
of the CJC that the case represents no infringement on the
right to free expression, the case
will be forwarded to the full
220 CJC for adjudication.
If the decision is made to adjudicate and the CJC finds the
perpetrator(s) guilty, the CJC
will determine the degree of
225 harm caused and assess punishment up to and including expulsion. It will not be a defense that
one did not intend the harm
caused—that it was reckless.
230 Lack of intent, however, maybe
a mitigating factor in determining the degree of punishment.
Swarthmore College is an
educational institution, not a
235 civil society with the responsibilities or resources of a civil
society. It makes no promises or
guarantees, express or otherwise, that it will undertake ef-240 forts to ferret out those who act
to violate the proscriptions set
out above. Those who regard
themselves as having been targets of fraudulent or degrading
245 expression, of course, may avail
themselves of legal remedies at
theirown initiation and expense;
e.g., regarding libel or slander.
When adjudication is not
250 deemed appropriate, mediation
may be suggested, and it will
normally be preferred as a first
step anyway. In particularly
egregious cases, however, the
255 Equal Opportunity Officer may
recommend adjudication without mediation. (Note: Mediation at Swarthmore College is
never required: all parties in-260 volved must willingly agree to
participate in the mediationprocess.)
Non-Adjudicable Uncivil
265 and Demeaning Expression
As a member of Swarthmore
College, one's moral responsibilities extend beyond formally
sanctionable conduct: All of us,
270 therefore, have a responsibility
not to indulge in gratuitous offensive expression just because
it may not be subject to official
sanctions. Anonymous offen-275 sive expression is almost always
unconscionable, but the risk of
harm in making adjudicable all
forms of offensive expression
would not only outweigh the
280 benefits ofofficial proscription,
but endangeracademic freedom.
Even when individuals (or
groups) admit authorship, however, they act irresponsibly if
285 they are unwilling to engage in

a defense of their views, especially with those targeted.
Perpetrators of alleged nonadjudicable but deplorable ex-290 pression will be urged by the
Deans to engage the objects of
their attacks through discussion
and, possibly, mediation.Ifthey
refuse, the Deans will not for-295 ward the perpetrators for adjudication by the CJC, though
they—and other College officials or anyone else—may publicly decry the content and man-300 ner of such expression, publicize the names of those who
engage in such behavior, and/or
refer the matter to the response
team (see below).

Without vigorous and controversial discussion and debate,
the College cannot survive;
without respect and civility,

however, it cannot thrive. Swar-350 thmore Collegetherefore strives
to create an environment of civility and respect where those

of diversebackgrounds and convictions can explore questions
355 and controversies that naturally
arise in an academic setting.

invasions of Privacy
The internet provides enormous opportunities for nonadjudicable invasions of privacy. Sometimes, of course, the
invasion may be libelous, and
therefore subject to legal sanctions. Often, however, what is
said will be true but embarrassing, humiliating, or simply revelations about oneself that one
has every reason to want to control; e.g., truths about one's state
of mind and body. Those who
publicly disseminate such information without the prior consent of those affected can cause
enormous harm. Because another Task Force is devoting
itself to ethical matters thatarise
because ofthe use of telephones
and computers, we make no formal recommendation ourselves
regarding such invasions. It is,
of course, possible to harass
someone or a group by electronic means, and where that
occurs, the restrictions set out
above apply.

It needs stressing again that

the College will in no way for-

-385

be guaranteed. But however vehement controversy becomes,
the College insists that its members take responsibility for their
expression just as it insists that
individuals take responsibility
for their other actions.
To attack the bases of selfrespect for others, especially
while hiding behind a veil of
anonymity, is inexcusable. First,
it is cowardly, and abjectly so:
license masquerading as freedom may not takerefuge in cowardice. Second, because Swarthmore is committed to the free
exchange of ideas, all must take
responsibility for their expression: those subject to attack especially need to know who is
mounting attacks against them
so that they can better decide
how to respond.
It should be noted that the
criteria set out above regarding
harassing expression are not limited to individuals or groups his-

torically oppressed and/or as
protected in the College'sEqual
Opportunity statement. It must
be stressed that the proposed
390 regulations protect specified
interests, not specified groups,
and apply only to expression
that harasses, not other expression that might reasonably be
395 regarded as offensive or hurtful, whether intended, reckless,
or negligent. To reiterate: the
College's response and any punishments assessed by the CJC
400 will address only the intentional
or reckless infliction of harm
caused by harassing expression,
and not other possible harms or
offensiveness caused by non-405 harassing expression.
In particular, the proposed
regulations do not apply to what
are arguably far more destructive forms of offensive expres-410 sion, whether or not anonymously expressed and whether
or not they are harassing: e.g.,
racism or sexism thinly disguised as science or art. The
415 College does not attempt to prohibit such expression, however
irresponsible it may be. A sufficient reason not to do so is the
virtual impossibility of framing
420 regulations with requisite
subtlety to capture just those
cases we would wish to discourage without—at the same time—creating a chilling educational,
425 scholarly, and artistic atmosphere. Further, experience elsewhere suggests that when complex and fine-grained regulations are drafted, attention tends
430 to be diverted from the substance of irresponsible expression to the niceties of quasilegal interpretation. Finally,
fraudulent and harassing expres-435 sion are the two most prevalent
and serious forms of expressive
misconduct that occur at Swarthmore and so they, along with
threats of violence, are singled
440 out for attention. In prohibiting
only them the College hopes to
foster maximum academic freedom. Only fraudulent expression, threats, and verbal harass-445 ment, therefore, run the risk of
official sanction. Again, when
offensive but non-harassing expression occurs, especially when
repeated and persistent, the dis-450 cussion and mediation may be
suggested and even urged, but
never adjudication.
These formal limits on harmful, anonymous licentious ex-455 pression do not exhaust
anyone'sresponsibilities to create and sustain a setting where
students, faculty, and staff can
pursue life at Swarthmore free
460 from hatred, slurs, and vilification.The purpose of theseregulations, however, is to put everyone on notice concerning
what will and will not enjoy
465 formal protection under the
guise of "free expression."

Responses to NonAdjudicable Offensive
Expression
As already mentioned, the EO
Officer and/or the Deans may
suggest mediation when instances ofoffensive expression
occur. Frequently, however, alleged perpetrators are unknown
or charges do not clear the high
hurdle needed for adjudication.
This only aggravates the harm
done. Those aggrieved—especially when alleged perpetrators cannot be found—often feel
abandoned. Just as all of us are
responsible for our expression,
so it is appropriate that the College make a collective response
to show solidarity with those

harmed by offensive expression,
whether the expression is
adjudicableand whethertheperpetrators are identified. While
College officers—especially the
President and Dean of the College—often speak eloquently
and forcefully for the College
and its values and while the
Dean's office provides support
for harmed students, responsibility needs to be shared more
widely. One danger in any "official" response is that it can
seem merely pro forma. There
is no way to overcome this danger completely, but there may
be a way both to broaden the
number ofcommunity members
involved and keep the process
vigorous.
We thereforerecommend that
each year a new group of faculty, staff, and students be appointed as a team from among
those who have volunteered,
either individually or collectively, to respond to instances
ofoffensive expression brought
to their attention when that expression is anonymous and/or
when, though serious, it would
not meet the conditions for adjudication. The task of this team
would not be to formulate general policies but to provide a
forum for discussion of incidents as and when they occur
with an eye to particular responses tailored to particular
cases. The team would bring to
the wider community its views
and any specific recommendations, short of imposing sanctions. At the very least, the team
would provide a forum for discussion; more ambitiously, it
could show solidarity with and
concern for those harmed and
think of creative ways of responding to particular incidents.
Fortunately, Swarthmore does
not suffer from many instances
of fraudulent or offensive expression, so time spent by this
team should not be onerous,
except rarely.
We envision a large team that
would consist of a cross-section
of the College community. An
academic department, for instance, might comprise the faculty members for a given year
or semester, were they to volunteer, and one or two studentclubs
or organizations, also volunteers, could comprise some or
all the student members. This
would help keep the team fresh
and non-routinized. Membersof
staff would be drawn from the
various areas of the College.
Individual members ofthis team
might be consulted for advice
when incidents occur.
It would be Utopian to think
that Swarthmore College can
escape problems that afflict our
society and culture generally.
With persistent effort, however,
we may avoid some ofthe worst
cases of offensive expression
and have fewer instances of all
cases. In particular, we encourage students and Deans engaged
in orientation for first-year students to include segments devoted to offensive expression as
they now do to sexual harassment, plagiarism, and other mis-

conduct. Education cannot
eliminate the problem of de-580 grading expression, but it may
reduce its frequency and severityMark Friedberg

FEATURES
Distinguished Alums, Strange Rituals and Bad Poetry
By

Elizabeth Weber

For

most of the first half of this century,
at 7 minutes to 7:00 each Thursday

night, 7 senior men in dark suits and
garnet ties would rise from dinner and walk
side by side to a small temple on Elm Street,
at the end ofWhittier Place. This temple was
the meeting house of Swarthmore's own secret honor society, Book and Key.
While Book and Key was active, only its
members eversaw the inside of the windowless temple. The first floor contained a meeting room, with a lectern holding a large copy
of the Bible, and four stained glass windows
(a book, a key, the scales of justice, and the
number 232), illuminated from behind. The
benches outside of the Admissions Office
also stood inside the temple.
Book and Key members first saw the inside
of the temple in May of their junior year. As
the March 28, 1966 Delco Times describes,
"Selection for the Book and Key was a ritual.
At a gathering of junior classmen, one would
be tapped for membership every seven minutes until seven new members were selected.
Tap night was on the first Thursday in May.
The first visit to the Book and Key meeting
House the following Thursday night was also
a ritualistic affair. Every three minutes, a new

member presented himself at the door—where he waited. Suddenly a 'ghost' hand
would reach out the door and yank the new
member inside, where initiation rites and a
welcome dinnerawaited." The new initiates
would not emerge from the temple until the
next morning.
The initiationritual itselftook several hours.
Initiates were conducted around the room
several times, each time
representing a year of
Swarthmore. They were
introduced to the signs,
symbols, knock, etc. of
the society. At its conclusion, the initiates were
presented with golden
Book and Key pins, and
remained in the temple
for the night, studying the
Society's records. The
words, "May love ofyour
Alma Mater increase as
the night wears on, and
may the morning find you
bound to each other, to
us, and to your Alma
Mater, with ties of deathless affection," ended the
ceremony.
The Temple
Book and Key was
largely an alumni creation. In a tributeread at
Morris Clothier 'B6's funeral, Howard
Johnson said, "Shortly after 1900, Clothier
and I conferred about the establishment at
Swarthmore of a Senior Honor Society based
on the plan of the Yale Societies. We visited,
from the outside, Skull and Bones, Scroll and
Key, Book and Snake, and others...and
planned the building and its furnishing. For
practically all of this, Morris paid. In the
meantime, we drew upon the experience of

Herbert J. Tiley in drafting the Initiation
Ritual ...In Morris' mind, secrecy was very
important. In 1906 the building was completed and the first undergraduate class initiated."
Alumni continued to play an active role in
the selection of students for initiation, and
under the general supervision of Book and
Key, through the Temple Trust Association,
an organization of Book
and Key's founders and
alumni. The Temple Trust
Association met yearly,
and invitations were issued to all members,
signed with the phrase
"Yours in 232".
Members of Book and
Key were selected because of their activity in
College organizations and
their perceived commitment to the College. Most
were captains of sports
teams, Student Council
members, fraternity officers, or leaders in other student organizations. For
years, only those alumni
Friends' Library who had been Book and
Key members became
membersof the College administration.Book
and Key members discussed such things as
whether Swarthmore should adopt an honor
code (they didn't think so), grant "distinction
in course" to non-honors students (they
thought it should), and whether there should
be a picture directory of the freshmen class
(they thought so).
In the 19305, several of the rituals of the
society, including the Thursday evening procession to the temple, were dropped. Most of

thetic and Friendless."
And so, you might be saying, "Come on,
Katie! Aren't you writing these little dia-

the secrecy surrounding the organization was
also dropped. Selection ofmembers for Book
and Key became increasingly based on recommendationsoffellow students; the Temple
Trust Association began inviting alumni who
had made substantial contributions to Swarthmore but not been Book and Key members
in their college days to join the Association.
By the time of Morris Clothier's death in
1949, the initiation ritual remained somewhat intact, but several other trappings of the
organization had disappeared. The activities
ofBook and Key that year included sponsoring a play contest, organizing a shoe drive for
European refugees, organizing a faculty-student quiz program, organizing college open
houses for high schoolboys, organizing freshman orientation, ushering at lectures, and
selecting members for the following year.
Within a decade, Book and Key was gone.
J.Lawrence Shane '56, chair of the Board of
Managers, was selected for Book and Key in
the spring of 1955. "It was very low key. It
had sort of run its course by the 'sos" he said.
"All the pomp and circumstance was not a
part ofit. It wasn't all that active...l remember
going to one meeting in the Temple...the
whole thing was to be a positive influence in
a very quiet way."
While the organization was becoming less
active, student opposition to any sort of campus "elite" was growing. The senior members
of Book and Key decided not to initiate any
junior men in the spring of 1957. Temple
Trust Association members were upset, but
the news ofBook and Key's demise merited
only a news brief in The Phoenix.
In 1965, the Temple Trust Association
gave up all hope of reestablishing Book and
Key, and donated the remaining funds and
the Temple to the College, and their records
to Friends' Library.

Song

Our work is over; ye seven draw nigh
And followwhere leadeth the garnet on high.
Without o'er the campus spreads midnight's deep gloom,
While here with full hearts ye your late vows assume.
The Praeces is waiting on you to bestow
The archives and vestments whose purpose ye know,
Your care 'tis to guard them while this year ensues,
Then pass to the seven whom ye duly choose
The 800K—sacred symbol of knowledge profound
Where treasures of heavenly wisdom abound,
Wherein hath been written that precept of old
To all mankind known as the precept of gold.
The KEY—hopeful symbol to all who desire
Deep knowledge to gain, and who truly aspire
To have that which opens to students sincere
The world's hidden secrets which study makes clear.
In token that they their new duties accept,
And that all their vows will be faithfully kept,
The new chosen seven their vigil will keep
While all their companions are wrapt in deep sleep.
Approach then the altar, and view there displayed
The symbols whereon each his true vow hath made,
And be there invested with cap and with gown
Which we to your keeping now duly lay down.

The following year, The Phoenix reported,
"Equipping the building to meet legal requirements would have cost an estimated 3035,000 dollars. Unusedfor over ten years, the
heating system, plumbing, wiring, and roof
needed major repairs. An additional exit and
a fire escape would have been needed also.
The cost figure did not include the installation of windows in the once obscure building.
No permanent specific uses for Book and
Key were judged worthy of such an expenditure. As a permanent location for music practice rooms or an art gallery, the building
seemed inadequate."
In 1967, the building was razed. The Book
and Key Scholarship Fund, established with
the funds from the organization, is still in
existence. According to the Bulletin, it is
"awarded at the discretion of the college."

actuality, pathetic and friendless and this is
why you are sitting alone in various places at
various times across campus.
And to a statement such as this I must
respond with a resounding, uh, maybe. But,
two out of three of my friends, when asked if
they were my friends, all responded in the
affirmative, and statistics don't lie. So what
I'm saying must be true. I have no ulterior
motive. Just because you are sitting alone in
your room on a Saturday night doesn't mean
you are pathetic and friendless.
Let me give you an example. Last Saturday
was the prestigious Mary Lyon Halloween
Party. It is always well attended because it's
one of the only chances all year where Swarthmore students feel comfortable showing
off their bountiful, often pasty cleavage.
Although against my better judgment because I had much too much work to do, I
decidedI would go to the Halloweenparty for
a few minutes, at least. I justified my actions
by saying that going to the Halloween party
was research for my next article in The Phoenix and I was, therefore, doing work. I still
believe this justification is valid because what
if something really good happened and I, as
social commentator, had missed it? What if
this was the year that we finally grooved and
stomped our way through the molding Mary
Lyon floorof the breakfast room and straight
into the basement? What if those guys who
dressed up as Parrish were accidentally set
aflame by someone's smoldering cigarette?
Who would have commented on such an
irony? It was my duty as a journalist to attend.
So, I did. But afterabout twenty minutes of
trying to dance to tunes that my white girl,Bos
bubble gum pop, Madonna-loving body always rejects, I bid adieu to my inebriated
friends and took the shuttle back to Parrish. I
then checked my e-mail, went back to my
dorm, turned on the t.v., and wrote a paper.
Okay, so I admit, whenI read over that last
sentence, I sounded pathetic and friendless.
And when I read the first half of this article to
my mom on the phone, she said, "Great! You
are now going to be friends with all the
pathetic and friendless people on campus."
Well, so be it. I guess I am pathetic and
friendless. But being pathetic and friendless
is how we all got into Swat in the first place.
We all sat at home on Friday nights studying
for the SAT. We all answered the extra discussion questions at the end of the chapters in
our text books. We didn't just build Play-Do
modelsof volcanoes for our 4th grade science
projects, we built flaming, thunderous palisades of molten lava that vied only with
Mount Olympus in their grandeur.
I think what I'm trying to say here is that it
is your birthright as a Swattie to stay at home
and do work. And yes, it probably means that
you are pathetic and friendless. But face it,
man, you go to Swarthmore and you are a
geek. Anyone of you could have gone to a
state school andpartied yourself into oblivion,
but you didn't. You chose this existence and
there's no use denying it. And anyway, I
would ratherbe Queen of the Geeks than one
of her quasi-geek, go out on Saturday night,
blindly following minions.
So, stay, young Swatties, stay at home on
Saturday nights. Heck, stay at home on Friday nights, too, and practice bowing and
genuflecting to me, Katie, Queen of the Geeks,
pathetic and friendless.

being read aloud-with self-conscious
voice-over narration, interviews with
talking heads (Kenneth Branagh and
Vanessa Redgrave on acting
Shakespeare; scholar Rosemary Harris on Richard's historical context),
and behind-the-scenes footage.
The film's producer, Michael
Hadge, appears frequently, kvetching
about Shakespeare's inaccessibility
and the production's rising costs.
Shakespearean actor and frequent
Pacino-collaborator Fred Kimball
plays himself, which means playing
Pacino's on-screen muse and foil,
throwing the occasional spectacular
tantrum.

And Pacino himself is almost always onscreen, interviewing people
on the street (who generally seem
more interested in Pacino than in the
Bard, an opinion which Pacino seems
to share), sinking his teeth into the
showstopping role of Richard, goofing off. When you don't see him, you
hear him, offering up a self-consciously naive voice-over explanation of Richard's labyrinthine plot
("OK, so the kids have got to go!").
Fortunately, Pacino is a thoroughly
entertaining impresario, as well as an
actor well-equipped with the chops
necessary for a juicy role like Richard. Shedding most of his accumulated Pacinoisms (no hoo-hahs, no
tics, less Brooklynese), he thrillingly
treads the thin line between acting
and ACTING. He's joinedby a firstrate collection of actors, most of
whomrise to the challenge of iambic
pentameter. Winona Ryder's appearance as Queen Ann, seduced by Richard in a scene of almost delicious
malevolence, is as good as anything
she's done. Kevin Spacey and Alec
Baldwin acquit themselves well in
smaller roles. It is to Pacino's credit
that the film gives considerably more
screen time to Penelope Allen's

Queen Elizabeth than to any of the

big-name stars brought in to bankroll
the project.
Looking for Richard is at its best
when it veers back and forth between
the performed play and therehearsals
and readings from whichit has developed. The creative energy is palpable
as the camera scans Pacino and company, crowded around someone's
dining room table, arguing over their
characterizations. When the film
jumps back into the final performance,
it's instant payoff for months of hard
work. These sequences render the
making of theatre exhilarating in and
of itself.
Pacino's editing rhythms seem to
follow the contours of the play. Looking for Richard climaxes with the
simultaneous rehearsal and performance ofthe play' s concluding battle
scene, cutting from rehearsal to rehearsal and from rehearsal to performance, often from line to line. The
documentary inserts act as a suspensegenerating mechanism. They never
interrupt the narrative momentum of
Richard 111 long enough to trip up the
performance, just long enough to
bolster the dramatic meat of the scene
in question.
This successful mix of play and
documentary is what makes Looking
for Richard worth seeing. The play
within the film, the final product, is
good-well-acted, intelligently directed, making clever use of Gothic
New York locations. But lan
McKellan's pulpy, 19405-dress Richard 111 of last year was both better
made and considerably more adventurous.

The documentary sections ofLooking are diverting enough, even ifthey
unearth few revelations. Pacino's awshucks naivete can be grating, particularly since he's always on, always playing to the camera. The man
has already performed Richard twice
onstage. He doesn't need to reconstruct the play in the sort of simplistic
terms that his voice-over offers.
Which means that Al is intentionally
dumbing-down for our benefit, which
is more than a little patronizing. His
on-screen presence is charming
enough however, rendering one of
Shakespeare's most complicated
plays accessible, engaging, and surprisingly fresh. Looking forRichard's
success is a modest, but vital one: it
makes you want to see more
Shakespeare or, better yet, make some
Shakespeare of your own. And that
seems to be the whole idea.

Andy: Be quiet. I'm not talking to
you.
Emily: Why?
A: Well maybe because you get to
review the movie where Susan
Sarandon and Kevin Costner have
sex for three whole days and I get
stuck with Jim and his Biggo
Nectarine.
E: But that happens to be the
beautiful part of this nifty dialogue: we each get to talkabout
both movies, da? Besides, you
know that even though there is
oodles of on-screen sex in Bull
Durham, James and the Giant
Peach is just as replete with
suggestive undertones.
A: I guess. And now that
you've brought it up, let me
just say I initially felt a little
guilty about reading all this
sexual innuendo into what appears to be a children's story.
But to put off my feelings of
guilt and shame, I want to say that
James and the Giant Peach isn't as
innocent as it seems. The story is of
course based on the book by Roald
Dahl—
E: Who apparently was just a tad
perverse himself, and preferred to
writestories for adults under the guise

of kiddie-lit.
A: Right. But to get back to the tale
of the peach, James is a young English orphan who goes to live with his
disgusting and mean aunties. Auntie
Sponge and Auntie Spiker never let
James get a good night's sleep, serve
him horrible dinners of fishheads,

and drive him mercilessly with the
chant: "Work, Work. Work! Stop
lolly gagging in dreamland!"
E: I'm sure Swatties are familiar
with that type of mantra...
A: Yes, we certainly are. But back
to the story, what rescues James from
this bleak, depressing childhood pit?
A big, juicy peach. As far as subtlety
goes, James and the Giant Peach is

A Bulls to hook up with for the duration of the season, claiming that sex
sharpens a ball player's skill on the

wild, rookie pitcher Ebbie "Nuke"
Laloosh (TimRobbins), even though
everyone knows she'd rather be with
the moody, frustrated, slightly overthe-hill catcher Crash Davis
(Costner).

A:Don'tforget
that Costner and

writer/director
Ron Shelton just
released Tin Cup,
another movie
about sex and
sports.
E: OK, so
maybe we could
suggest that they
have hang-ups
with their masculinity. But lest we
tread too much on

psychological
grounds in this review, Annie and
Crash eventually do end up together,
resolving not to "think" about things
too much, but rather just to "be."
A: Which is the sort of message
one would expect from Disney in
James and the Giant Peach. And I'm
not suggesting that thereisn't a wholesome moral to be gleaned from James'
travels. I just think thereis a whole lot
of weirdness thrown in on the side.
E: Oh. You mean the bugs.
A: Yep, I certainly do. Imagine the

for young James, but more a second
womb that replaces his dead mother
and father.

experiment and the fabricatedreality
starts to crumble like a robot gone

haywire.
The entire soundtrack was electronically pre-recorded: there was no
live dialogue, and every sound effect
(from footsteps to the orchestra music) was created note by note by John
Moran, through a process of digital
sampling. The actors had nearly every action controlled by the
soundtrack, including their every line.
The combined effect was an overwhelming construction of a determined mechanical framework to
which people must adhere.
The opera exaggerates how much
humans love to be in control. There
was much robotocizing of human
behaviour which creates a sense that
conformity is more valuable than in-

dividuation.
The fact that three actors play the
role ofMathew (at one point, all three
of them were on stage), and three
other actors play the part ofLucy (the
woman charged with taking care of
Mathew) demonstrates thenotion that
people are easily replaceable-more
than one person can possess the same
type of characteristics.
The illusion of control is also demonstrated in the way Mathew is taught
about life. When Mathew is learning
how to cross the street, he is shown a
"video demonstration," and then is
asked to try it himself. He is given
three "lives": three chances not to be
hit by the cars that zoom by. He fails
the first two times, but remembers
what he must doafter that. The screen
on stage displaying the three X's (that
denote the number of lives remaining) is eerily reminiscent of a video
game; life is controllable and disposable, and our choices are limited.
There were several videos used in
the production that added to the overall effect. Clips from Sesame Street
such as a film about the letter "M," a
glorified, slicked-up countdown sequence, achild discussing what school
means to him are juxtaposed against
the horrible reality Mathew faces in
the consumeristic, violent society.
Many people left Mathew feeling
somewhat disturbed, but not entirely
sure why. Perhaps it was that the
social commentary hit a little too
close to home, or that too much information was presented in too stange
a way. Whether we were disturbed,
enlightened, or just plain amazed,
Mathew found a way to enter our
subconscious, perhaps to stay.

Mothers' and Worms' Last Hurrah Has Spirit
By

Tim

Sibley

"Dela-who, Dela-what, Dela-why,
Delaware... woo-hoo!"
This weekend, a co-ed ultimate
team traveled to the University of
Delaware to compete in the annual
Halloween tournament. The entire
team showed up in costume, including senior Courtney Harter' s brilliant
"I don't have a brain."
Courageously playing for glory,
guts, and the good-will of mankind,
not to mention the Great Pumpkin
(alias Roger Bock '99) and the free
giant pizzas whose boxes later made
it to the ML party, Swarthmore's

Smart Whores truly astonished their
unsuspecting opponents.
In fact, so outstanding was their
exuberance that the team was rewarded with the tournament's infamous Spirit Award to accompany
their less than auspicious 0-3 record.
The award was won by such dramatic, heartwarming displays as senior Dave Lewis' knock-em down
and hug-em-later maneuvers and
sophomore Noam Unger's nipplechaffing bids. Equally impressive was
the teammanship displayed by the
eight Warmothers who had to trade
for the three women's positions on
the team.

In the first game of the day, Swarthmore discovered that the success of
the previous night's Pterodactyl Hunt
had left their normally unparalleled
quads feeling like a bowlof jello with
a hangover. Nevertheless, an astute
half-time analysis by captain Gabi
Kruks-Wisner '99 helped Swarthmore overcome their sluggishness.
After trying in vain during their
second round bye to both digest the
industrialized world's largest delivered pizza and find Unger some much
needed Vaseline, our intelligent persons of questionable occupation saw
their hardworking zone defense
picked apart, first by The Tall Guy

Mothers and Worms enticed their
Delaware and Rutgers foes into a

Intramural Action

From In-line Races
Men's Rugby Lose in Finale to Inner Tubes
By Tony

Sturm

The S warthmore men's rugby team
was unable to overcome the aggressiveness of visiting Villanova on Saturday and succumbed to the visitors
by a score of 33-17. The host Buzzards, at times, showed signs of what
they couldhave been, but these flashes
of brilliance were dulled by the relentless Villanova rucking and their
ability to stay on their feet no matter
how many Swarthmore ruggers were
pulling them down.
The game started with a sour twist
for theBuzzards when Villanova took
advantage of some powerful backs to
break through Swarthmore's line for
two tries almost before the referee
had time to start his watch. Swarthmore regrouped only after Villanova
had struck once more to seize a 21-0
lead.

The Buzzards did not give up hope,
though. Although they were without
both of their starting wing forwards,
Swarthmore struck back with force.
Co-captain Jason Sturm '97 answered
with a try off a quick penalty, and
Dan Schwan '97 scored another try in
the same manner. Just as Swarthmore
began climbing out of the hole they
had dug themselves into, Villanova
dumped dirtinto theirfaces andforced
them to fall back to the bottom.
Villanova's inside center, who was
dominant all day, scored a nicely
executed try when he faked the ball
outside and kept it, diving into the try
zone for the score. And just after the
half, Villanova scored again when
their weak side wing snuck into the
corner of the try zone, effectively
putting the game out of reach.
This did not prevent Swarthmore
from playing for pride, and they added

Women's Soccer
Ends Season 5-10-3

Beth Wiles

The women's soccer team began
its final week of the season by taking
on their most hated rival, Haverford,
on Saturday. The players were extremely psyched up for the game,for
if they won they would have accomplished a big upset in the Centennial
Conference.
The game started well, with Swarthmore playing strong and generating several attacks on the relatively
weak Haverford defense. Strikers
Sarah Jaquette '9B and Betsy
Rosenbaum '9B were instrumental in
setting up several scoring opportunities. Unfortunately, the team was
unable to capitalize.
Very late in thefirst half, Haverford
scored itsfirst goal ofthe game,which
took some of the momentum out of
the Swarthmore players. At halftime,
Head Coach Alex Ely commended
the solid play of his girls and exhorted them to rise to the challenge
presented. Although Janice Gallagher
'99 returned to the'field and did a
fabulous job of anchoring the defense throughout the second half,
Swarthmore was unable to stop
Haverford from scoring two more
times. The game ended with a 3-0
Swarthmore loss.
The Haverford game marked the
last home game in the soccer career
of the team's loneseniorLaura Starita.
Starita, with her experience and versatility on the field, had a fine season
and was a valuable contributor to the
team. "We'll all miss you, Laura."
On Monday, the team traveled to
Kutztown to take on the Division II
Kutztown University Golden Bears.
Playing conditions were rough, with
next to invisible side-lines and one

half of the field a murky, muddy
swamp. Swarthmoreplayedtoughbut
had difficulty adjusting to Kutztown' s
very poor playing field.
The team was down by two goals
in the second half when leading scorer
Kirstin Knox '99 sailed a direct kick
into theupper right hand corner ofthe
Kutztown goal. Knox finished the
season with nine goals and three assists. She was fifth in the Conference
for goals scored and was twice named
to the Centennial Conference Weekly
Honor Roll.
Reflecting on the season Knox said,
"It was good. The season was an
improvement over last year's and we
feel like we are going to have a strong
team next year. We really will. I just
know it."
The season ended against
Millersville on Wednesday. In darkening conditions, the two teams
battled to a 0-0 tie. Goalkeepers Anne
Holland '99 (first half) and Emily
Manetta 'OO (second half) did a great
job of denying all Millersville scoring opportunities.
In addition, Jen Vander Veer '99
and Melissa Morrell '99 played well
in the midfield and Susan Hunt '99
and Nia Wright 'OO did a great job of
shutting down the Millersville attack.
Swarthmore ended the season with
a 5-10-3 record. Captain Claire Baxter
'9B said of the season, "I was really
pleased and impressed with the attitude and commitment of my fellow
players as well as by their support for
the new coach."
Said Betsy Rosenbaum '9B, "Leadership was a very important aspect on
the team this year. We are looking

two more tries before thefinal whistle
blew. Chris Jahnke '9B scored one of
the more beautiful tries this year,
faking out four Villanova opponents
and dragging two more with him into
the try zone from five meters out.
Soon after, Adam Blescia '97 scored
after he recovered his own pop kick
in the try zone. Blescia's try was set
up by fine running by the backs and
well executed rucking by the for-

wards.

Matt "Astro" Lillvis '9B, seeing
his first A-Side action ever, played
extremely well at the demanding position of wing forward. He was not
intimidated by his opponents, who
outweighed him by a good 50pounds.
In the B-side game, Jerome "Bam
Bam" Bushnell '99 scored his first
try of his career on a heads up play,
touching the ball down for the score.
He, along with two Villanova players, provided much entertainment
after the contest with an unclothed
tour of Wharton CD.
The Buzzards did not meet expectations this year, but no one on the
team is hanging his head. "Although
we have had our share of disappointments, I think this has been a really
fun season," said Sturm. "I would
like to thank everyone who came out
for a great season."
Sturm also noted that the season is
not completely over; they still have
to overcome the formidable opponents of intra-squad kickball on Friday and Goldschlager next week,
which "whupped ourasses last year."

Saturday at Bryn Mawr. They were

defeated 8-7 after a tough game. Jen
Philpott '97 summed up the team's
reaction to the game as, "We were

Bryn Mawr was the first to score

off the first half with another five

on a try by Beth Vose '99, who ran in

Undefeated Conference Champions
By

Jean Quinn

The season may not be over yet for
the Centennial Conference Champs.
The field hockey team continued their
romp against conference rivals, defeating Gettysburg, Washington, and
Haverford this week, and locked up
first place with a flawless conference
record of 9-0. At 15-4 overall, the
Garnet await next week's announcement of post-season tournament
berths. Swarthmore should participate in the either theNCAA or ECAC
tournament.

The Garnet's 2-1 double overtime
victory against Gettysburg last Saturday was a huge win. After a scoreless first half in which goalie Kelly
Wilcox '97 made fantastic saves,
Gettysburg lit up the scoreboard first
with 30 minutes of regulation remaining. Swarthmore actually scored
moments later, but the goal was disallowed. "Apparently the referee
thought it went off a defender's stick.
On a free hit, it must hit a stick from
our team before it goes in, or it doesn't
count," said Coach Karen Borbee.
Jen Hag an '99 tied the game with
20 minutes left in the game. Lurah
Hess '99 was on the right side of the
goalie at the time and said, "What I
basically saw was a good strong drive
from Jen (off of a penalty corner)
headed straight for the goalkeeper.
The goalie didn't have enough time
to get her legs closed, because it was
such a quick drive. She attempted to
squeeze her legs around the ball, but
it was too powerful and zipped

through her legs and into the cage."
Coach Borbee felt that Hagan's goal
gave Swarthmore control of the
game's momentum.
The teams remained in a stalemate
until less than four minutes were left
on the clock in the second overtime,
when Danielle Duffy '9B saved the
day and scored on a break-away. "She
beat her player to the right and fired it
in. She does that all the time in practice so when I saw her beat her player,
and therewas no other defender there,
I knew there was a very good chance
the game was over," said Coach
Borbee.
Duffy reports that "Gettysburg was
a really skilled, fast team, and the
game was a good match. I think that
the fact that we could come back
from being down 0-1 and win the
game in OT shows that our team has
a lot of heart and desire. No one got
down after Gettysburg scored their
first goal; it was like it didn't even
happen. We just went out harder and
got a goal to tie it up. And then in the
overtime, everyone just gave all they
had left."
Against Washington College, the
Garnet chalked up another win, 2-1.
Holly Baker '99 put Swarthmore
ahead early in the first half on an
assist by Michelle Walsh '9B. Washington tied it up five minutes later,
and the Garnet only secured their
victory with five minutes left in the
whole game when Donna Griffin '99
scored off assists by Walsh and Duffy.
Coach Borbee said, "We didn'tplay
our best, but we did what it took to

win. Washington is a very good team
and we played well enough to beat
them." As Lynne Steuerle '99 said
after the game, "Good teams find a
way to win even when they aren't
playing their best."
With just one night to recover from
another exhausting game,..Swarthmore facedrival Haverford on Tuesday. Coach Borbee commented, "I
knew we were a much better team,
but I was concerned because it's easy
to play down to the level of the team
you are on the field with. Also, after
a disappointing season, it would make
their season much better to ruin ours..
Finally, it was Haverford so you never
take them lightly."
Baker scored the first two goals of
the game off assists by Griffin and
Ch'uya Hornberger '97, and Duffy
scored twice as well. Lia Ernst '97
picked up an assist. The Garnet outshot Haverford 30-2. Wilcox got to
come out of the goal and play the
field andLauren Hopkins' 98 guarded
the cage for most of the second half.
Duffy, who was named the conference player of the week for her outstanding offensive performances,
said, "It was a good gameand all the
seniors got to play in the second half...
Kelly showed that not only is she the
best goalie in the conference, but that
she is still an excellent field player!"
The team will continue practicing
while they wait to find out if they
qualified for post-season action. If
they do get into a tournament, they
will probably have their first game on
Saturday, November 9.

Ending on a High Note
By

David Lischer

Rounding out their season with a
tri-match at Western Maryland, the
Swarthmore women's volleyball
team earned its first Centennial Conference win with a victory over
Ursinus. The team finished the year
with a disappointing 4-17 (1-9 conference) record one year after stunning the conference with a 6-4 mark.
Although the team graduated many
players with significant court experience, this year's squad had the tools
to continue in its winning ways. Led
by co-captains Vanya Tepavcevic '97
and Jordan Hay '9B, the team had a
number of solid individual performers, but eventually failed to gel. Still,

in looking back on the season and
seeing only four matches in the win
column, one does not get an accurate
picture of the skills, effort, or dedication on the part of the players.
Hay and Holly Barton '99 were the
only returning players with a great
deal of court experience. Tepavcevic,
Heather Stickney '9B, and Connie
Cheung '9B all saw action last year,
but not to an extent that they could be
expected to dominate the conference.
Stickney has improved tremendously at the net, in terms of hitting
and especially blocking. Cheung dug
like a backline player all season and
was a strong all-around hitter.
This season, starters received much
support from the bench. Tepavcevic

set the tone

for this positive spirit.
Although rookie Becky Ndosi '97
had to cope with a number ofinjuries,
she could be counted on to win crucial side-outs. Wendy Williams '97
and Kimberly Klock '97 both made
major contributions, Williams in the
unfamiliar middle-hitterposition and
Klock offside.
Jenny Yang 'OO and Jae-Kyoung
Hong' 00received much playing time
as rookies. Yang played outside position and was one of the team's most
consistent passers. Hong was also a
valuable defensive substitute. Jeannie
Gallego 'OO showcased a powerful,
left-handed serve. These younger
players will be vital components of
next year's squad.

Men's X-Country Preservers
By

Nevin Katz

Last weekend, the men's cross
country team ventured to Gettysburg
for the Centennial ConferenceChampionship meet. The pack of approximately 100 harriers, went out fast
and furious, cruising across flat open
plains. Despite the lack of hills, there
were many aspects to the course that
hindered therunners' momentum; one
was the mud, whose merciless grip
would suck up shoes, and the other
was the infamous gravel path.
Finally, from a purely mental perspective, the open lay of the land
made each mile almost too visible.
However, the course was conquered,
primarily by the Swarthmore seniors,
each of whom gave excellent performances.
Captain Kerry Boeye '97 kept to

himself before the race, but his quiet
and reserved air concealed theflames
of racing fury that lurked inside him,
waiting to be unleashed onto the terrain. Between the thundering call of
the starting gun and 27 minutes, 52
seconds later, Boeye let loose a torrent of aggression, blowing past runner after runner to gut into 15th place.
Close behind him was Jeremy
Weinstein '97 who put in a smashing
performance in finishing 20th overall in 28:12. Having not raced for
almost a month, Weinstein had been
ready to capitalize on this competitive opportunity for weeks, and now
he's receiving phone calls from
around the conference regarding the
secret to his success.
Cameron Warner '97 also performed well. He proved exceedingly
valuable on the defensive end, push-

ing back enemy runners on all sides,
to finish in 42nd at 29:16.
Youth comprised the rest of the
Swarthmore Pack: Liam O'Neill 'OO
placed a strong 25th at 28:37 and then
Phil Jones'99reeled in33rd at 28:51.
Graham Lucks '9B flew into 38th at
29:06, while Wyn Strodtbeck '9B
appeared seconds later in 45th at
29:22.
The team's fifth-place finish overall was frustrated many; however,
the men were able to put aside any
residual discouragement and give the
most spirited support for the women's
team they had all season.
For everyone, the race serves as a
springboard for Regionals at
Dickinson on November 9, and it has

given each of the men an idea about
which parts of their races to work on
the most.

Foul Play in Soccer
By

Shulamit Shapiro

It's usually in the spirit of sportsmanship that the Swarthmore men's
soccer team plays all of its games.
Unfortunately, in the game this past
Saturday against Gettysburg, the
team slipped out of this spirit.
The players were very frustrated
with thebehavior ofthe referee. "The
referee was horrendous. He basically
determined the outcome of the game
by making ridiculous calls," said cocaptain Amber "Waves of Grain"
Thompson '97.
The referee also took Mike Schall
'99 out of the game because of an
apparent misunderstanding between
them. After the referee called for
Schall to sit out of the game temporarily, Schall walked out of his earshot. As aresult, he didn'trespond to
further remarks made by the referee.
The referee took his behavior as a
deliberate slight and gave Schall a
red card, which prevented him from
playing for theremainderof thegame.
"When he ejected Mike Schall,
who by the way was The Player of
the Week last week, we lost our main
defender and we had to play a man
down," said Thompson.
Thompson also felt that the referee allowed the other team to stand
in arestricted area, either by an accidental or deliberate oversight. This
oversight resulted in the other team
having overly easy access to making
a goal. In the end, Gettysburg won

Tide Falls Again

The Garnet Tide continued their
losing skid this past Saturday to the
bloodthirsty Dickinson College Red
Devils, 56-12. The Tide came into
thegame with memories oftheir huge
upset win over the Red Devils the
previous year on Clothier Field. The
S warthmoreteam this year was not as
fortunate. The Dickinson unit continually pounded them.
As always, the Tide began the game
with enthusiasm and confidence in
their beginning drives. The defense
was able to force and recover a fumble

Danielle Duffy, the fastest forward on thefield hockey team, contributed
greatly to the team's success this regular season. Able to outrun almost any
opponent, Danielle leads the team with 19points (8 goals and 3 assists) in
the conference and 30 points (12 goals and 6 assists) overall. "Whenever
there is a big goal, Danielle usually had a hand in it," said Coach Karen
Borbee. This past week, Duff not only scored twice against Haverford,
assisted on the winning goal against Washington but also scored the
winning goals in both double overtimes against Rowan and Gettysburg.,
nationally ranked fourth and sixth respectively.
Duffy's consistent performance has earned her the titles of Player of the
Weeks of 9/16/96 and 10/28/96 as well as the Centennial Player ofthe Year
in 1995 and provided Swarthmore the opportunity to appear in post-season
playoffs for the first time in history.

the game 3-0.
On Wednesday, the team faced
Ursinus. "We started off a little slow.
We weren't really in our game and
our passing was a bit slow. We had a
panicky style," said Thompson.
Will Dulaney '97, the team's number one goalie, was absent from this
game,and Adam Macßeth '99 had to
stand in his place. "Adam played a
phenomenal game. When they had a
penalty kick, he saved it, but it
bounced off of the post and went
back to the original kicker. Then, the
kicker finished it," said Thompson.
Co-captain Kyle Barnett '97 had a
very unfortunate accident during the
first half, which may sideline him for
the remainder of the season. He collided with a goalkeeper and dislocated his patella (kneecap).
"Hopefully he'll be back for the
last game of our season which is
against Haverford," said Thompson.
Thompson scored the team's only
goal with ten minutes left in the game,
but his effort was to no avail as the
Garnet dropped the match 2-1.
Thompson is already eyeing
archrival Haverford, the team's final
opponents of the year. Of the other
two games that the team has left to
play, Thompson has a very relaxed
attitude. "We have nothing to lose,"
he said.

Kurk Selverian, a senior co-captain ofthe Garnet Tide, was an "ironman"
against Dickinson, playing the entire game at offensive guard in addition
to his usual duties as a defensive tackle. "He plays well on both sides of
the ball," commented fellow teammate Eddie Shin '97. On offense, he led
the team with 11 "roller-skate" blocks, where a blocker takes the opposing
defensive lineman and pushes him backward like he was on roller skates.
He also did an outstanding job in pass protection helping to rejuvenate the
Garnet offense. On defense, he recorded six tackles, including two for
losses.
In addition to his remarkable performance against Dickinson, Kurk is
the Tide's second-leading tackier with 39 tackles, along with two sacks,
two forced fumbles, and one interception through seven games. He was
also selected first team All-Centennial-Conference in 1995.

on Dickinson's first series and then
hold them to a field goal on the second. Also in the first half,
Swarthmore' s offense moved the ball
on the Devils and scored their only
points of the game during this time.
The Tide's first score was at the
end of an intense drive. However,
when repeated attempts to punch the
ball in from the one yard line failed,
head coach Karl Miran called on
Patrick Straub '97 to run a quarterback sneak. On the snap, Straub took
the ball and leaped over the offensive
and defensive line into the endzone.
The Garnet's second touchdown
occurred when Straubconnectedwith
Lou Basenese 'OO for his second
touchdown in the last two games.
Straub's passing efforts during this
game gave him 4,232 total passing
yards, which is just 327 short of 10th
place on the all-time Centennial Conference career passing list.
The usual problems thatplague the
Tide began to surface near the end of
the first half.With Dickinson consistently moving the ball on offense, the
Garnet fell behind 31 -12 at halftime.
In the second half, the Tide's lack
of depth began to show in all aspects
of their play. The special teams allowed long punt and kickoff returns
and both the offensive and defensive
units became sluggish. The Red Devils began to pass the ball effectively
for several touchdowns and their defensive unit stepped up its already
impressive play and converted turnovers into scores. The Red Devils
finished with aconvincing 56-12 win.
The Tide faced a fired-up opponent which was seeking revenge for
last year's game. They also faced
problems which have plagued them
throughout the season. One can imagine what the Tide would play like if
they could have substitutes at each
position and if they did not have to
play starters on all the special teams.
Unfortunately this problem cannot
be solved until they can effectively
field larger recruiting classes.

Next week (Nov. 9), field hockey
and cross-country will engage in
post-season competitions.

Championship Results

X-Country
By Sarah

McClure

On Friday evening, the women's
and men's cross country teams left
for their trip to Gettysburg College to
compete in the Centennial Championships meet. When they arrived at
The Holiday Inn in the historic city of
Gettysburg the women's team gathered together to receive pep talks
from co-captains Danielle Wall '9B
and Alison Schirmer '97 and Coach
Erica Chiavetti.

Take this race one
step at a time...before
you know it, you 'll be
at the finish line.
Erica Chiavetti
Wall handed out plastic skull rings
of the team members to wear
during the race as a symbol of the
team's strength and need to stick together. "This is our time to push
ourselves... we need to work together
during this race," Wall explained.
"I've seen all the time and effort
you've put in to making this season a
success. You're all strong and prepared for this race," commented
to each

Chiavetti.
'Take this race one step at a time;
focus on the shoulders of the woman
in front of you and catch up with her,
then pass her and focus on the next
runner ahead ofyou. Before youknow
it you'll be at the finish line," she
continued.
The course at Gettysburg is usually
ideal. It's almost completely flat and
can be seen in its entirety throughout
the race.
However, Saturday morning, as the
women warmed-up, they discovered
the course was not as perfect as they
had imagined it would be. Due to
recent heavy rainfall, the vast majority of the course was muddy.
After the men finished their race
they advised the women to tape their
sneakers on to prevent them from
becoming stuck in the mud and falling off while running.
Coach Ted Dixon explained to the
women's team that time was not an
issue in this race; the main objective
was to pass as many women as possible along the course.
Despite the conditions, the team
finished strong as the men's team
cheered them on throughout the race.
Amalia Jerison' 00 took thirdplace
in the race crossing the finish line
with a time of 19:34. Close behind
were Wall at 20:17 in 12thplace and
Rebecca Riskey '9B. Karen Lloyd
'OO followed in 27th place with a
time of 21:15 along with Schirmer in
33rd place at 21:20.
The women's team finished third
in the conference out of ten teams.
"The Amazon Women rocked the
Centennial Conference's world this
Saturday. We body-slammed the
competition in the great mud-wrestling pit that some call the Gettysburg
cross country course. It was obvious
that CoachTed's WWF training videos really taught the team a lot,"
commented Wall.
Lloyd added, "The pressure was
off because we weren't expected to
win, so we mucked through the mud
like bats outta hell with nothing to
lose."
As the season comes to an end, the
women are currently training for the
NCAA Regional Championships at
Carlisle, Pennsylvania the afternoon
of Saturday, November 9.
