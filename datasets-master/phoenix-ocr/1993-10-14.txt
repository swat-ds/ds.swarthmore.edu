Trotter plans unveiled
By Elizabeth Bramson
Plans for the North Campus/
Trotter Project are nearly complete
and have been on display in the
CollegeBookstore for the past week.
The Campus Steering Committee
and countless architects, planners,
landscapers and artists developed
theplan, which callsfor tearingdown
Parrish Annex, constructing a new
building, and renovating Trotter
Hall. In addition, the plan will eliminate the road that currently runs
through the center of campus, in
front of Trotter and alongside
Beardsley.
The first step in the project is
the razing of Parrish Annex, which
was originally built as a temporary
structure. The demolitionis scheduled to begin in June 1994. A new
building will be constructed in the
spot where Parrish Annex now
stands.
The new building will be a twostory stone structure with a pitched
slate roof. It will "complement adjacent buildings," trying for an architectural compromise between
Parrish Hall and Trotter on the one
hand, and the more modem Lang
Performing Arts Center on the other.
The College's needsand wishes
are reflected in the architects' plans.
In Bloom's words, "we have begun
to envision a better integrated, more
functional north campus, enhanced
with landscaped outdoorspacescon-

ducive to meeting, conversing,
studying and relaxing: spaces reminiscent of the front lawn of Parrish,
. Worth courtyard and the Scott amphitheater."
The new U-shaped building
will house theNorth Campus Commons—a student center where students can grab a cup ofcoffee and
meetwithfriendsorprofessors. The
Commons will be glass-enclosed to
allow students to look southwards,
to Parrish Court—the area between
the existing Parrish Hall and the
new building—or northwards, to
the area between DuPont and the
new building, which will be called
the North Campus Quadrangle.
Eliminating the road that currently runs alongside Beardsley,
from Parrish to DuPont, will change
the campus, making it almost entirely pedestrian. The plan calls for
a tree-lined walkway that would
connect the North Campus Quadrangle and the Rose Garden.
According to Bonnie Mcßride,
DirectorofMajor Gifts, the parking
issue has not been resolved. Possibleresolutions include a parking
lot by the train station and/or behind
DuPont where the rugby field now
sits. Neither option seems satisfactory to faculty and staff.
Once the new building is completed in September 1995,renovation will begin on Trotter Hall. The
grade will be lowered by about three
feet, making the current basement

of Trotter into the ground level.
Inside, the most dramatic change
will be theconstruction of a central
stairway which will, according to
the architects' plans, "function as
both stairs and a vertical lounge."
Trotter will also be completely accessible by wheelchair withthis lowered grade and the installation of an
elevator.
The project's "ideal" completion date is January 1997. In addi-

tion to the estimated $19.8 million
construction cost, there will be an
expense ofapproximately $5.2 million added to the endowment to
provide for the increased operating
costs, making the total cost of the
North Campus/Trotter Project a
minimum of $24,997,000—again,
perhaps "ideal."
On the brighter side, President
Bloom said, "It will convert a building which is home to more than a

quarter of our faculty and more than
60% of our classes into a stunning
and state of the art faculty office and
teaching facility. It will create a
second stunning building which creates spacefor thoseofficesand classrooms that cannot fit into the renewed Trotter.... From a prudent,

long

planning perspective
represents the most important deferred maintenance project we can
undertake."

College reconsiders South Africa investments
end one

Could

of campus's most divisive issues

By Andy Perrin
Following the call by African
National Congress president Nelson
Mandela, the Board of Managers
and Al Bloom have initiated a process aimed at reinvesting the College endowment in companies that
do business with South Africa.
Swarthmore divested itsholdings from such companies in 1986,
after a long and often bitter campus
debate on the issue. When it divested, theCollege had two options
for handling the expected loss of
revenue. Rather than simply accept
a more slowly growing endowment,
Swarthmore decided to create an
item in each budget to pay for any
investment losses, explained College treasurer Sue Welsh.
Welsh estimated, each quarter,
the difference between the return
Swarthmore made on its investments and the return similarinstitutionsreceived without divesting. As
it turned out, the difference was
about $917,000 over the seven years
the College has maintained the
policy. However, the predictions
were more pessimistic than the reality; the College reserved almost
$2 millionout ofits seven-year budget to pay for the endowment loss.
Thus over $1 million "extra" has
been paid into the endowment over
the period of divestment.
The movementfor S warthmore
to divest itsmoney from South Africa consumed much of campus
political life in 1985 and 1986.Led
by Rajen Naidoo 'B6, the
Swarthmore Anti-Apartheid Committee (SA AC) and the Swarthmore
College Divestment Coalition petitioned the Board of Managers to
divest.

Since 1978, Swarthmore had
invested only in companies that followed the Sullivan Principles, a set
ofrequirements laid out by a Philadelphia activist, Rev. Leon Sullivan.
By 1986, however, Sullivan had rejected the principles as inadequate
and had endorsed total divestment.
A student council referendum
in the spring of 1985 found widespread student support for divestment. For nearly threeweeks in September, 1985,pro-divestment activists held a constant vigil on Parrish
porch.
Then-president David Fraser
and other members of the administration said there was a conflict between the College's basic educational mission and a commitment to
social action using the endowment.
Professor Raymond Hopkins and
others argued against divestment on
the same grounds.
At its meeting on September
28, 1985, the Board of Managers
tabled the motion. The student
groups responded by occupying the
Admissions office; later SAAC and
SASS seized the President's Office
and the next meeting of theBoard of
Managers. The protesters were fined
$2O each; instead ofpaying they put
the money in escrow until the College divested.
In its meeting on March 1,1986,
the Board of Managers made the
decision to divest. The resolution,
proposed by Fraser, said that "unless apartheid is dismantled as a
system of institutionalized racism,
the Board of Managers intends to
divest of its equity holdings..." in
companies that do substantial business in South Africa.
President Bloom has been consulting with faculty and students by

e-mail and in public meetings. He
said faculty were very supportive of
reinvestment and that most student
e-mail respondents supported the
measure.
At the student meeting held
October 12, however, many students —including some from South
Africa and neighboring countries
—expressed reservations about reinvesting.
Bloom argued for reinvestment, noting that many colleges and
companies were doing so, and that
"we have an opportunity to make a
positive gesture" by displaying confidence in South Africa's future.
Ivan Mofokeng '95, a South
African student, disagreed.
"Mandela is a very optimistic person and I stand behind him," he
said. "But at the same time we must
look at the realities." Mofokeng
pointed out that South Africa is still
ruled by a white minority government. He urged the College to wait
until a democratic future was secured there.
Bloomalso claimed that neighboring countries like Botswana and
Zimbabwewouldbenefit by a stronger South African economy. A student from Botswana replied, "That
same South African government
came and did cross raids in
Botswana and Zimbabwe.... the
money that goes right now will go
to the people who should not be
getting it... people are still oppressed."
RobinLasersohn 'B6, who was
involved in the original agitation
for divestment, had no problem with
reinvesting now. "I don't think it
was just blind following of the
ANC," she told The Phoenix. "But
we looked to the ANC for leader-

ship. I think it's legitimate to reinvest."
Pointing to the campus-wide
debate that brought about divestment, Bloom told the meeting that
"this is an issue that we'd like to
have a real sense of community."
In an interview withThePhoenix, Bloom offered the following:
"As I expressed to the faculty and
to thestudentbody and to the Board,
I believe the College should respond to Nelson Mandela's call to
begin again to invest in companies
whichdo business in South Africa.
Such a move would both be a visible sign of our support for the
constructive directions which are
being pursued in South Africa and
would free the college to invest in
ways it deems most appropriate to
fulfilling its fiduciary responsibility to guarantee the best education
it can to this and future generations
of students. The original decision

to divest resulted from a commu-

nity expression ofmoral outrage at
the Apartheid system and I believe
the decision to discontinue that divestment must also be a decision
that represents the collective commitment of the community."
Vice President Harry Gotwals
noted that one of the most pressing
reasons toreinvest now was to avoid
having to sell stocks at a significant
loss as companies reentered the
country.
Vice President Bill Spock suggested that the College might agree
not to seek new investment in companies with South African dealings
but, at the same time, not require
itself to sell stocks in countries reentering the market.
After more consultation,
Bloom will make a recommendation to theBoard ofManagers, who
will make the final decision on the
issue.

Women's affairs
expert to visit
By Andy Perrin
Bernice Sandler, a Senior Associate with the Washington-Based
Center for Women Policy Studies, will visit Swarthmore October 27
and 28 to meet with students involved in a variety of programs relating
to Women's concerns.
Sandler will give a series ofpresentations and workshops on topics
including gender dynamics in the classroom, sexual intimidation,
harassment and assault, policies to insure equity, and relevant federal
regulations.
Sandler edits the newsletter About Women on Campus, and has
published more than one hundred reports on various women *s issues on
American college campuses. She played a major role in the development and passage of several laws prohibiting sex discrimination in
education.

Swarthmore needs an intelligent conservative voice

'to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable...'
By Andy Perrin
I usually dread opening up and reading the
Opinion section of the Phoenix.
It's not because it's a one-sided forum
anyone can tell it's not without more than a
cursory glance at the articles. Rather, it's because
I can expect that most, if not all, of the conservative argument will be on such a depressingry
simplistic level that it makes little sense to respond. Nevertheless, I doread on.
Fveoftensaid —you'UfmditinmyP/wg/iuc
column, "For the People," as early as theFall of
1990—that an intelligent and thoughtful conservative presence on campus would be a welcome

Last week was no exception to my unhappiness about opening the Opinion section. Page 5
alone provides sufficient ammunition for a semesterworthofcolumns. Apparently the opinion
co-editor —who, coincidenlalry, isalso editor-inchief of a certain conservative newspaper on
campus
forgot his own admonition to reject
"...a private and political agenda" since he managed to construct an entire page in defense of his
own pet project.
Theauthorof thatpiececlaims confusion, or
at least annoyance, that a news commentary column of mine, which has appeared in the same
space every week thisyear, expressed opinions,
which it has done every week this year. No
complaints whatsoever were raised in previous
weeks about the column's opinionated character,

most readers, I feel confident, were entirely capable of noticing an "editor's view" column and
reading it appropriately.
Last week's letter complains that this column is a special privilege; "It's a pity thatall the
students...don'thave their own paper to air thenown views in. [sic]" That's a point Common
Sense tried andfailed to make; there is simply no
evidence that any students are being systematically excludedfrom campus debate or from publication in the Phoenix. There certainly is evidence that conservative voices are losing arguments, but the two are very different claims.
The opinion co-editorclaims that his views
were printed here for "exactly one semester."
Qearlyheismissingtheprevioussemester,when
he wrote frequently for the pages, which I then
edited. And clearly he is ignoring the present
situation, in whichhe edits the section. He then
brings up "hostile" treatment of conservative
columnist Read Schuchardt; one wonders if the
reference is to the full-page treatment of
Schuchardt'santi-abortionrights tract inthe Spring
of 1992.
Somehow, without an argument behind it,
the existence ofmy columnhasbecome the basis
for a claim thatconservative voices are excluded
from The Phoenix. How that logical leap was
madeis beyond even speculation. Butlast week's
opinion section made it abundantly clear that
conservative opinion isaliveand well in thepages
of theCollege's official studentnewspaper.

larly, it is not Swarthmore's responsibility to
encourage specifically conservative voices, and

since they have not been taught tobe comfortable
with their own sexuality and have been told"Just
Say No" instead of being encouraged to make
their own decisions about sex.

safer sex tools is by demonstrating on the body
parts for which they are actually made. The first
step tobeing able to usea condom or a dentaldam
correctly is by seeing it done on areal person, not
on thebanana that then goes into your Cheerios.
We would not have included all of the sexual
acts and graphic footage had we not decidedafter
much debatethatit was absolutely necessary. The
decision to use sexually graphic footage and to
cover a variety of sexual activities was made in
accordance with our ideals, even if they offended
the sensibilities of some people. This difficult
decision was made because any compromise on
our part could lead to theloss of one ofyour lives.
As we said, our intention was not to scare people
away from sex or to make them imcomfortable
with it, yet we know some people obviously left
the workshopsfeeling that way. (We would also
like to add that we have also heard many very
positive responses to the workshop and video as
well!!!). Our response to this reaction is that
anyone who is going to have sex needs to be

comfortable with it, with themselves and their
bodies, and with their partner('s). We understand
and expect that many people are having sex even
though they are uncomfortablewith some aspects
of it, and that is exactly why we are giving these
workshops, to help people learn to have safer sex
andbe more comfortable with it
To thosewho were offended or upset by the
video, the following may sound harsh, yet we
cannot apologize for the truth as we see it A
number of people were disturbed by the video
because theyfelt itcheapened sex orthat it showed
sex unrelated to love or emotions. We were not
trying to make a video about love. The title was
safer sex, not safer love. This is because, unfortunately, love never has and never will protect
anyonefrom sexually transmitteddiseases. This
does not make us happy either, but once one
understands that thereis a distinctionbetween the
two, onecan realize the importance of protecting
oneself using lajex, lubricant, and Nonoxynol-9,
insteadofliving in a fantasy worldwhichdoes not
exist in 1993.
Fmally, one of our main goals was to challenge people to get them to think for themselves
about what safer sex means to them.We want this
discussion to happen, so that people continually

and it seems that almost as many stories feature
how much money an athletemakes or shouldbe
making as theperformances of theathletes themselves. All this attention to money, specifically
large amounts of it, has led many to protest that
these athletes are overpaid, that they should take
a back seat to thosewhose professions truly serve
the community. While this ideahas some merit,
reviling the athletes in question for the abilities
whichbring them so much wealthseems unfair,
as there is more at work than simply greed. Our
society's fascination with sports, with entertainment furnishes the money to pay those salaries,
and there is no practical way, shortof a socialist
approach to income redistribution.
First, pro athletes, one and all, are overpaid.
Twomilliondollars, nevermindseven or eight, is
far too much to pay anyone, even a teacher,
doctor, or selfless phUanthropist, let alone an
entertainer.The starting salaries, the minimum
wagesof these sports, are similarly out ofwhack;
even borderline players are paid a minimum of
$lOO,OOO in baseball, $75,000 in football, just as
absurd when compared to the actual minimum
wage.
It is indeed hard to argue that pro athletes
genuinely deserve to be paid as much as they are.
Considering die grueling nature of these professions, however, the long seasons spent traveling
around the country and the bruising naturesof the
sports themselves, complaints are not quite merited; there is ample evidence that many professional athletes' lifespans are shortened by their
sports. In aperfect world, those who serve society
best would earn the most money,andathletes and
other entertainers would be paid according to

their trueworth to the community at large, but this
is obviously not the case. Until we, the consumer
public, stop watching sports or other entertainmentevents and start paying more attention to the
"public service" occupations, untilkids start collecting teacher or doctor cards, the inequities will
continue, and it is useless to protest
Second, there is something vaguely disturbing aboutthenatureofthe "he'smaking too much
money" complaints. For better or worse, the
country has implicitly dedicated itself since its
founding to the concept of *'making it good," of
becoming a character in a Horatio Alger novel,
and now is a tad late to start questioning.
It's the American way, fundamentally, to
bring in Qegally) all diematerial wealth one can
amass, andif the results tend tobe a little unsightly
sometimes, well, that's how these things can be.
Au fond, thecriticisms sound like no more than
sour grapes; decry the greedofthosethatfailtouse

disapprovingly on the gain of wealth is simply
hypocritical.
Third, there isnopracticalmethod ofdistributing the income to those who supposedly deserveitrnore.whUewelivemourimperfectworld
thatpays for the athletes and entertainers.Let me
qualify that:thereis one way, popularly known as
communism, under which these athletes would
be paid no more than anyone else, but tearing
down capitalism because of injustices in the
salary structure seems a mite extreme. Again,
why indictthe athletes themselvesfor theirphysical gifts?Rather, encouragethemto contribute, to
donate to this charity or that
Giventhatyoung people look up to athletes

rather than to those whose professions serve
society, those is the public eye should feel obligated toset a goodexample. Itis unfair to expect
them to become models of decorum solely because of their professions, but the tremendous
influence theycanhaveonimpressionableyouths
must be takeninto account
More than "don't do drugs" commercials
are needed in efforts by athletes to clean up their
act, public-relations-wise; thealarmingfrequency
of brushes with the law by such public figures
indicates that this particular aim, setting a good
example, is not exactlyhigh on thepriority listfor
most athletes. Contradictions betweenrole models' words and action often serve to belie the
worthwhile messages they preach. If genuine
service of others were more prevalent among
these figures, some of the injustice of awarding
massive amounts ofmoney to people who do no
discernible good for society would be mitigated,
and young people would have truly worthy heroes.
While it is unreasonable to expect that all
such luminaries become paragons of virtue, or
that young people turn their attention to teachers
anddoctors, movements in these directions might
help. When it comes to reducing the monetary
inequities, salary caps or similar devices in baseball wouldhelp toendthespendingfrenzy, butthe
most important changes must come from those
who watch and support the games, rather than
those who work hard and receive their due.
Shakespeare's Cassius said "The fault lies not in
our stars, but in ourselves," a maxim that applies
even today; a little self-examination on thepart of
society is required.

Giving us a piece of their mime Revolutionary poet comes

The San Francisco Mime Troupe impacts the community
By Sanda J. Balaban
If you attended the San Francisco Mime
Troupe's extravaganza in the PAC last weekend
expecting to see a group of skinny, black-clad
men in whiteface grappling with imaginary walls,
you were greeted with a (pleasant) surprise. The
Troupe's production of "Offshore," which premiered in San Francisco this summer during the
Troupe's season offree performances in the city
parks, satirizedthe politics of thePacific Rim and
the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) with a blend of Italian commedia
dell'arte, 19th-century melodrama, and musical
comedy. This piece was a collaboration between
the Troupe's resident playwright and theatre artists from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and the
Philippines. The Mime Troupe describes whatit
does as "popular theatre, not high art," in which
the actors work to show their values through
physically defined characterizations that read
across cultures by using a universal language of
movement (Incidentally, theatreprofessor Allen
Kuharski explained that the "Mime" in the
Company's namecomes from''mimesis," meaning role-playing, which was definitely a major
aspect of SFMC's production, as the cast of six
actors took on a multitude of roles.)
The Troupeperformedto afull-house which
saw all contingents of the Swarthmore community in the audience; Kuharski described theperformance as"tnriyacornmunity event thatcrossed
all lines." Hefelt that theperformance dramatically illustrated—through its socially-conscious
agenda,itsdealingswithissuesofmultiodturalism,
and its service as a community-building event
that theatrecan and does express the values and
traditions of the college in a deep way.
The San Francisco Mime Troupe, founded
in 1959, is America's oldest political theatre
company,andhasbeen expressly multicultural, in
both the subject matters they deal with and in the
composition of the group itself, since its beginning.
The Troupe members made it a point to be
active in the Swarthmore community while they
were here. On the political side, members of the
Troupe met with classes inpolitical science and
Asian-American literature, and withmembers of
the Intercultural Center and SAO over the past
two weeks. On the theatrical side, the Troupe
conducted a three-day long workshop over the
weekend for Theatre majors. Kuharski summarized thisresidency as the suitableextensionof the
performance, since the group's agenda is to impact the community and build a meaningful relationship.
Seventeen theatremajors participated in the
workshops, and several faculty members and
students observed. As one student aptly pointed
out, "todo thismuch workover a weekend"—the
workshops ranfor a totalof eighteen hours—"it's
gotta be fun." These workshops provided experience with a master teacher on issues of
physicalization in a presentational style. Dan
Chumley, whodropped out ofHarvard to join the
Troupe twenty-six years ago, directed and performed in "Offshore" and also conducted the

Eight weeks ago, they stepped onto
Swarthmore soil, leaving their parents and
taking withthem only the lingering warmth of

They stared out around them, at the other

nervousness, at the grass that would be their
playing fields and the teachers who would
determine their academic success. Now, the
first-years are going to take their first break
from school, to travel, relax here, or return
home, and many are assessing how the first
half of the semester has gone.
Upperclassmen can remember the insecurity of the first year, and many of the firstyear students are feeling this uncertaintyabout
their surroundings. It is often difficult to go
from a home environment to a dorm, living
with peers rather than the people with whom
one has grown up. One first-year woman
feels that she still hasn't had enough time to
adjust to the change. "I'm not saying I don't
like it here, but I don'tfeel like I'm part of this
community,itdoesn'tfeellikeahome." Raina
Siladi '97 agrees, "I'm still getting used to a
different world."

Rebecca Giguere '97 points out one
source of difficulty of adjusting to life at
college: "I got so much attention at home
from my parents and siblings. Here, it's
different because I'm more independent and
on my own, and if I want to get attention I
have to get it for myself." Some miss the

Courtenay Dunn '97 feels that it was
particularly easy for her to fit inhere because of
the type of students who choose to attend
Swarthmore. "It's really easy to feel like youfit

have already found a group of friends with
whom they felt comfortable. David Lewis' 97
found a niche withhis hallfrom thebeginning:
"During orientation, all the freshmen on our
hall bonded."
Whether they are having a hard timehere
or really enjoying college life, most students
are glad to get the chance to go home for break.
Sofie Beckham '97 is looking forward to allof
the things she can do there that she's been
missing here. "I'mready to go and eat really
good food, sleep a lot, play, and have adventures."
Some are nervous about feeling different
at home. Lewis was able to experience this
return on a trip home a few weeks ago, and
reports, "It was strange to be home, and it's not
home any more. I was referring to here as

break will give them a chance to see whether
they miss life here, and to take note of how
they have developed sincethat scary first day

Swat's women ruggers grapple for the ball during their recent shut-out of Shippensburg, at home.

Rugby women fall hard, recover
By Delta Ruscheinsky
The women's rugby team traveled toPrinceton on Saturday, October
5 to face the #5 team in USA/Rugby
East. While Swat was prepared for a
close match-up after a 100 loss last
season, the Princeton team, scoring
two trys in the opening minutes of the
game, dominated from the start and
wentontowinthegame4l-0. Despite
a poor overall team performance, the
forward pack was able to win most of
the line-outs in the game with a new
strategy.
The women's team quickly put
thelossbehind them andputforth their
best performance this season to beat
Shippensburg 22-0 last Saturday in the
first home gameof theyear.
Shippensburg's forward pack
seemed physically overpowering at
times, butSwat's ability to •-emainlow
in the scrums resulted in Swat's con-

trolling the ball and remaining on
Shippensburg's side of the field for
mostof diegame.Forward CaptainJen
Romich commented, "I was particularly proud of forward support Deb
[Cunningham], of course, is always
there, but in this game so were Kim
[Lundgren] andWendy[Weiner] '94."
Romich, a loose forward, opened
theShippensburg gamewith a try off a
penalty and m the process set a scoring
precedent. Lundgren and Cunningham,
the other two loose forwards, scored
one and two trysrespectively off short
yardage plays later in thegame.
Whiletheforward pack controlled
the scoring, it was back line tactics that
moved theball upfield KatieLaird '96
had several long runs to leadthe back
line in its best offensive performance
this year. Rebecca Cole '96 responded
well to an extensive kicking game in
her debut at fullback, while the tackling
consistency of LynnMatthews '97 ral-

bed the team defensively.
"We have had to make a lot of
adjustments in theback line this season
andonSaturday everything finally came
together. Every player was able to
walk off the field feeling they had
contributedto the victory," said sophomore back Rebecca Cole.
Said Romich, '1 finally feel we
have become an offensive team and a
force tobereckonedwith in theEastern
Pennsylvania Rugby Union."
The B-side team followed die A
team's lead and soundly beat
Shippensburg 15-0. The highlight of
the game coming early in the second
half whenSarah Azaransky '97 raced
50 meters for an uncontested try.
The women's next match-their
final division game-is at home against
Franklin and Marshall on October 23.

Ex-Houston Rocket star Kevin
Kurmert once said of the 76-77 team,
"rveneverplayedwithacrazierbunch
of guys, this team will live onforever."
Of course, he's speaking of the original
Fab Five, which consisted of himself,
Rudy Tomjanovich, Calvin Murphy,
Dwight Jones, and Mike "Unfrozen
Caveman Lawyer" Newlin. Unfortuneately, with the exception of
Tomjanovich, themembers of this unbelievable team have practically been
forgotten by most sports fans over the
years. INJUSTICE, you say,
MARGINALIZATION,youcry,such
INTOLERANCE cannot goon. Well,
a few select members of Parrish 4th
West decided to do something about
thisproblem. And after days ofserious
negotiations, the GreatWall of Fame
was erected.
The Wall of Fame consists of
many groups of baseball, football, and
basketball cards featuringplayers who
were, or are "on the margin" of the
sporting world For example, former
Oakland A's third baseman Mickey
Klutts had a .215 lifetime batting average after hacking around baseball for
ten years, yet his smiling mug appears
on theWall. Rather thanshowMichael
JordanandScottie Pippen to represent
the ChicagoBulls, we chose ex-Bulls
John "the Glide" Mengelt and Tom
"the Natural" Boerwinkle. And who
could forget theErxleben twins, who,
besides sharing the same first name,
Russell, had the exact same stats while
punting for the New Orleans Saints at
the same time—UNBELIEVABLE!
But theWallhas many more than
marginalized players thatpeoplereally
don'tremember. Many of the players
are divided into subgroups. For example, the"Five Vowel Society" features ex-CubsoutfielderJesus Hgueroa

and former Royals pitcher Aurelio
Monteagudo. At the "Horn of Plenty"
you can eat a Juan Eichelberger with a
side order of Coy Bacon and Rusty
Kuntz, and washit downwith that exNew England Patriot, Sam Adams.
And for die non-secularists, you can
come worship at "Clergy Comer" with
Adrian Devine, Richard Bishop, and
ex-SeattleMarinerJohn' Holy"Moses.
If you come to visit the Wall,
please sign the guest register and make
a request. Toyota, thebenevolentsponsor of theWall, hasre-introduced their
"YouAskFor It, YouGotIt" campaign
of yore in order to ensure that many
requests are granted.
Another UNBELIEVABLE aspect of theWall ofFame is the eightby
ten photo of Toby Sterling '94 with
none other thanSantaClara University
basketball superstar"Pistor,PeteEisenrich. You mayrememberPete's blond
mop, goofy mug and Otis Birdsongesque moves, fromlast spring'sNCAA
tournament, whenClara pulled off the
upset of the century versus Arizona
and leaving Aaron "Neal" Feuer '94
"in stunned disbelief!"
A major ideological influence on
the Wall ofFame is die eminent contemporary philosopher Steve Somers
from California-Berkeley. Kevin
Babitz '94 had the blessing of conversing with Dr. Somers earlier this week
on thereligious and philosophical implications of the Wall of Fame. "Always remember the marginalized, the
choking chopper, but always eschew
the temptation offrontrunning,forwhile
the former can help you arrive at true
redemption, the latter is nothing but
cold emptiness." The thought ofSteve
Somers is sometimes incomprehensible tomanyof us, but thewall offame
is a place for everybody. Come up to
Parrish Fourth West, sign the Guest
Register, and just soak up all of the
pandaemonium,bay-bee.

Phillies headed for the Series
By Robert Fleegler
The Philadelphia Phillies
clinched the National League title
with a 6-3 victory over the Atlanta
Braves in Game 6 of their series last
night The Phillies, who defeated the
Braves 4-2 in games, earn the right to
face thedefending champion Toronto
Blue Jays for the World Series over
October break.
The Phillies came back to win
the title after losing Games Twoand
Three by a total score of 23-6. These
defeats put Philadelphia down 2-1
with two games remaining in Atlanta. The Phillies recovered to win

games three and four in dramatic
fashion, 2-1 and 4-3, respectively.
The key blow in these two games
came on Lenny Dykstra's lOth-inning home run whichclinched Game
Four.
It was a disapointing end to a
season that saw the Braves come
from lOgamesback of the SanFrancisco Giants to win the National
League West for the third season in a
row. However, Atlanta once again
fell short of achieving their ultimate
goal-a World Series victory.
By the way, if anyone finds an
Atlanta Braves hat on the north side
