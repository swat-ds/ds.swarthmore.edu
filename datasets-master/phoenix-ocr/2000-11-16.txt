ROLLING THE DICE
The Athletic Review Committee is betting that changes to Swarthmore
sports will improve the program. But no one knows if teams will be cut
and, if so, which. The outcome is as uncertain as a throw of the dice.

EXTENDED COVERAGE: NO WORD YET ON FATE OF SWARTHMORE ATHLETICS

Board of Managers to make final
decision after discussing 'several
models' identified by committee
SY

LILLIE DREMEAUX AND JUSTIN KANE

After meeting for the entire day Tuesday, the
Athletic Review Committee postponed making a
specific decision on the fate ofSwarthmore
athletics until well after the upcoming Board of
Managers meeting Dec. 1
According to ARC Chair and Provost Jennie
Keith, the final meeting of the semester at the
Ashton House unfolded largely as expected, with
the committee discussing "several models" for a
potential course of action but making no "specific
recommendations" in the report to the board.
Keith and others refused to comment on the
details of the various proposals the committee
discussed, citing a need to present the models to
the board before releasing details to the public.
Committee member and Athletic Director Bob
Williams noted that "there were some specific
ideas expressed" but that the decision-making
process still remains a "very broad discussion."
Although the ARC will present its proposals to
the board Dec. 1 Keith said that the committee
expects the board to make its decision at the
following meeting, which will be held on Feb. 2324. In the meantime, the ARC will send out a
student survey and allocate time to "community
discussion of more specific issues," Keith said.
The committee's indecision reflects the
caution it is taking with its recommendations,
which may include the elimination of a number of
varsity teams and a change in the slotting system
and other admissions policies. After 10 months of
deliberation, however, some coaches many of
whose futures will be decided by the ARC are
worried about the impact the prolonged
uncertainty will have on surviving teams.
"It's very difficult to recruit when there's no
guarantee you'll have a team next season," said
head football coach Pete Alvanos, who began the
bulk of his recruiting this week. "I want a decision
now. We need to put this behind us so we don't
have to worry about it anymore."
At one point the committee had planned to
make a final decision by December 2000, but the
pace of the investigation has pushed back the
projected date of its final decision to February

2001

"We thought we might get to that point, but
we're not ready yet," Keith said.
Other coaches reported that prospective
student athletes who saw articles about the ARC'S
review on The Phoenix's Web site have called the
athletic department to register their concerns
about whether the sports they play will exist at

Swarthmore next year.

Williams said that he has told coaches of all
teams to "recruit normally" as the committee

waits for more input from the board. "Hopefully
with the board's direction, we will come to a
decision soon," he said. "The specifics are up to
the board after their deliberations."
Keith, Williams and other committee members
declined further comment on the ARC'S report to
the board.

Sitting across a desk from Pete
Alvanos, you can read the stress on his

face.
When the Swarthmore head football
coach wrinkles his brow, there's more on
his mind than the recruiting calls he has
to make later. His eyes bulge, then sink
resignedly back into his head. This is the
story of his week
minus his characteristic intensity. He leans back to laugh, his
chest expanding wide, and just as you
brace for his hearty roar, out slips a nervous chuckle, the devilish plot twist just
when you had it all figured out.
Everything seems a little amiss, and
it's not just confined to Pete Alvanos.
There's something rotten in the LambMiller Field House.
As the Athletic Review Committee's
deliberations grow more specific, hushed
tones and careful words have become de
rigueur in the athletic department, and
for some coaches,
understandably so
the committee's recommendations may
mean the difference between offensive
lines and unemployment lines.
With a final decision on the ARC's proposals pushed back to the Feb. 23-24 Board
of Managers meeting (see accompanying
article, this page), the uncertainty continues for coaches, who now face the difficult task of recruiting for teams whose
very existence is in doubt.
"Nobody knows what's going to happen," said Sue Davis, coach of the men's
and women's swimming teams. "And what
the ARC presents to the Board of Managers is just going to be a recommendation,

not a decision."

The issue of recruiting this year has
posed a challenge to coaches whose goals
to better their teams sometimes interfere
with moral qualms about plugging teams
that might not exist next year. Athletic
personnel have been told by the athletic
director to recruit just as they would have
last year, even though all teams are under consideration for removal by the ARC.
"For the good of our program, I have
to continue [recruiting]," said women's

basketball coach Adrienne Shibles, who,
like the other coaches, was instructed to
recruit for her team as normal. She explained that forfeiting an entire class of
basketball players would undoubtedly
weaken her team for four whole years.
Shibles' personal defense for continuing to secure players lies in the fact that
she is "selling a good product." In other
words, even if a potential player were to
come to Swarthmore and discover thatthe
team for which shehadbeen recruited was
gone, she would still receive an education
at an excellent institution.
For other coaches, the promise of a topnotch education isn't a strong enough incentive to attract athletes who have their
choice ofthe nation's top colleges and universities.
"There's no one you can recruit to play
for one season," Alvanos said. "How can
you bring in players when there's no guarantee there will even be a program? I
struggle with that from an ethical standpoint. The more [the ARC] drags this out,
the more it hangs over our heads."
Coaches have faced difficulty in re-

cruiting high-schoolers who know nothing about the deliberations of the ARC.
Some

of them worry that the prospect of

possibly having their teams cut may scare
away recruits who actually do stand a
chance of playing on a certain team as
planned. A few prospective student athletes have even read about the ARC's ac-

tivities on The Phoenix Web site and
phoned the athletic office with their concerns.
Yet for all the hand-wringing the review is causing, the consensus among the
coaches seems to be that the ARC is a necessary evil.
Davis saw theformation of theARC as
a necessary response to a change thathas
occurred in Division in athletics over the
last ten years. Colleges have become so
competitive, she said, that scholar-athletes
are now extremely important to Division
HI schools, even though they once mattered only to Division I schools. In an attempt to try to fit the mold of the ideal college, Davis said, Swarthmore administrators have plunged into an unrealistic effort to 'fexude as much excellence in athletics as they exude in academics."According to Davis, the college's attempt to meet

this goalby sustaining 24 teams clearly has
not been successful.
"I think all of us in the athletic department are glad the ARC exists," said
Shibles, "because there is an obvious problem
here."

the lack of support for athletics

The ARC, led by Provost Jennie Keith,
was created last winter with a twofoldpurpose: to assess the state of theathletic program in relation to the college's mission,
and to make a recommendation abouthow
to make improvements to the program
where necessary. But an effort to improve
athletics on a large scale or to purposely
shrink its role at Swarthmore—may come
in the form of eliminating certain teams
or significantly altering admissions poli-

cies.
Shibles' comment seems to reflect a
view that the ARC's upcoming recommendation will remedy some of this lack of
support. But thereality, according to members of the ARC., is that cutting sports
teams is a distinctpossibility, as isrevamping the slotting system in the admissions
process. Both would likely reduce support

Coaches concerned, feel undervalued
From COACHES, pg. 3
for the athletic department.
Clearly, the Swarthmore athletic faculty
recognize the need for the ARC to assess the
sports program. As the coaches await, somewhat nervously, the ARC'srecommendation
about what changes should be made, their
feelings about the subject vary widely.
Some are general and optimistic. Men's
lacrosse coach Pat Gress saidthat he thought
"the end result [is] going to be positive and
that [the athletic department would ] have
more competitive teams here."
Others' opinions were bitingly personal:
"If my sport is cut, I'll start looking for a new
job," said Dan Sears, coach ofbadminton and
women's tennis.
Chris Pearson '95, interim coachof men's
tennis, said his response to the ARC's cutting of teams would "depend on the message
behind it.
"They can say that [they] value sports but
[they] need to decrease the size of the program for athletics to succeed," he said.
"That's an approach I could live with.But if
the long-term concern is to dimmish therole
of athletics, that will change the nature of
the decision and the way people feel about
it. There are a lot of people who don't see it
as something that shouldbe part of a college
curriculum."
Pearson added, "I honestly don't know
which side they're going to come down on."
Although the Board ofManagers will not

make any final decisions until February, it
will hear a report from theARC which Keith
described as "substantial" on Dec. 1-2.
Regardless of what decisions are made,
the coaches are determined to maintain an
integrity that seems to arise fromfierce dedication to athletics and to their own teams.
"If the campus isn't going to recognize
what athletics can do for a young person's
life, [athletics] should be done away with,"
said Shibles. Women's soccer coach Amy
Brunner's feelings on the subject were nearly

identical: "If we decide to keep it, we need to
understand why athletics is valuable," she declared, adding that the committee deciding that
athletics is not important would be akin to telling all the coaches that theirjobs are not worthwhile.
"The Board ofManagers is doing what it feels
is best for this institution," Alvanos said. "The
outcome is going to be the outcome, and it's going to affect my life. But through sport we are

taught to deal with adversity."
There is a concern voiced widely by faculty
and students alike that the administration and
the campus culture at large have failed to coexist peacefully with theathletic program over the
years.
"We feel very undervalued," said Brunner.

"Assumptions are being madethat athletics are
unworthy and that they should not be a part of

Swarthmore."
Many coaches expressed particular distress
about the relationship between academics and
athletics at the college, blaming the administration and student body for not recognizing the
educational value in playing a sport.
"I think a lot of students see sports as just
throwing a ball around, and that's not what it is
at all," said Shibles. Shereferred to herrole not
as that of a coach but as that of'a physical educator. I challenge my women every day to test
themselves, to become better leaders, to work
with a team."
"Every school I've been associated with has
had physical education as well as academics.
Everyone functions better if they use their body
some," Dan Sears said. "A person learns a lot
about himself or herself through various kinds
of competition."
Gress said that the athletic staff here
"teachfes] teamwork, sportsmanship, physical
conditioning." He also asserted that sports pro-

vide a necessary diversionfrom academics and
add diversity to the campus "that otherwise
wouldn't be here."

But, according to much of theathletic department, most of the campus fails to see the importance of balancing academics and athletics.

"It's a catch-22, whether or not to inform
teams of what's going on," Brunner said. She
stated that discussing the matter couldlead athletes to feel even more alienatedfrom therest of
the student body than they already do. Pearson
said that the ARC's decision has "the potential
to make the relationship between [academics
and sports] worse before it gets better."
"[The tension] has always been there and it
always will be," said Pearson. "It's how it has
been since the college first started athletics."
Since its formation, issues such as the cutting of teams and how sports on a broad scale
should fit intoSwarthmore life have been hotly

debated both inside and outside the committee.
Certain topics, such as the slot system, have
aroused controversy andfallen prey to false assumptions, according to the athletic personnel.
Slotting is a method of recruiting in which a
certain number of places within the admitted
class are reserved for athletes.
Shibles hoped the ARC would address what
she felt was the primary concern among her
colleagues: untrue assumptions about the slot
system. Denying the notion that "that the
coaches are justtrying to get better teams," she

said that "academics is our number one consideration. We all want students to be here that
are going to flourish" as a part of campus life.
Shibles compared the athletic slot system to
choosing one of two otherwise equal candidates
because one plays an instrument and the other
does not.
"The whole slot issue is a mess," said
Brunner. "The term 'slot' has created the idea
that students are getting in [solely] on athletic
ability. That's very false."
Alvanos felt that very few people in the ad-

missions office and in the athletic department
understand the slot system. "The committee
needs to define a slot before we start talking
about numbers," he said. "That's where this
whole process could be misleading— I don'tclassify a slot as an admit but as a yield."
Brunner also expressed concern that revamping the slot system could seriously diminish the quality of the teams here. "If the slots
are reduced, we will have high difficulty offielding a team," she said of her soccer team. "I'm
going to lose out on some talented players who
are very smart."
Alvanos said a reduction of slots would send
a definite message to the athletic department.
"When you talk about numbers, I have to question how seriously athletics will be taken," he
said. "They're talking about 10 percent. How
many teams can you field with 37 kids?"
It is already hard for Swarthmore to attract
high quality student-athletes due to the poor

reputation of the teams here and the intellectual rigor of the curriculum. Prospective studentswho couldkeep up with Swarthmore's academic program weigh the college against other
options that seem friendlier toward athletes.
These include other liberal arts schools, such
as Williams and Amherst, along with the Ivy
League and similar large institutions, like the
University of Michigan and Georgetown.
The coaches emphasized a need for the college to acknowledge the contributions their
' teams make to academic life. Shibles pointed out
that her team had a 3.5 GPA last year, while

Brunner said that "the athletes here are [academically] equally strong as students thatwould
have been [admitted] otherwise."
The athletic personnel also saw the ARC as
a possible means to remedy or at least assess
theissue ofintolerancefor Swarthmore athletes.
Shibles said that many athletes over the years
had expressed anxiety about "not being accepted
on campus," and Brunner referred to "a real fear
that younger students feel like they shouldn't
be here." But there was also the worry that a
dialogue about this topic might even worsen the
situation.

"Some of the discussion could lead students to believe that they shouldn'tbe here,
that they aren't up to par academically," commented Brunner.
Despite discrepancies among the coaches'
views of the ARC's upcoming recommendation and the place ofathletics at Swarthmore,
the physical education faculty on the whole
agreed that the committeehad conducted its
deliberations in a scrupulous manner.
"They've been very thorough and inclusive," said Gress. All told, the athletic per-

sonnel approved of the ARC's decision to
obtain a variety ofperspectives by interviewing student athletes, studentnon-athletes, administrators, physical educators and other
faculty.

Davis noted that, in particular, the committee has "done a very good job of.. .better
understanding the position we are in as an
athletic department in the world of college
athletics. It's something we've understood for
a long time," she added.
Alvanos, however, wonderedwhether the
committeehas neglected a key constituency
in its discussions. "I don't know if the com-

mittee has truly investigated alumni," he
said. "Football has been played for 114
years.... There's a phenomenal amount of
support. I don't think any alumni wants any
sport dropped."
With regard to what lies ahead for specific teams, the athletic faculty are in the
dark. Shibles and Gress both said they "had
no idea" what lay ahead for their respective

sports. ThePhoenix reported last week that
all sports have been considered for elimination, so athletic faculty and students alike
are simply awaiting the ARC's recommendation.
For Alvanos, whosefootball team justfinished its best season since 1995, the review
comes at an especially bad time. "I think my
program is alive and well. It would be a travesty to pull the plug at this point," he said.
Pearson was the exception, asserting that
he thought men's tennis was probably safe
from removal. "We've made postseason play
every season but one since the '7os," he said.
With their careers at stake, most coaches
are on the edges of their seats. "Our lives are
sort of onhold," said Shibles. The ARC's recommendations, whatever they are, will
clearly have major implications for the nature of the athletic program at Swarthmore
as well as the individual lives of student athletes and their coaches. In keeping with its
two-part objective, the ARC will affect athletics on two fronts: what tangible changes
the program should undergo, and how athletics and its participants should fit into
Swarthmore life. The latter issue seems to
be the one that touches a nerve with the
physical educators here.
"In order for us to bridge the gaps, the
Board of Managers needs to step in and ...
address the entire community," Alvanos
said. "This is a larger issue—it's about what
the board wants the college's culture to be."
"It makes me feel very disappointed that
people don't appreciate what we do for the
students," said Brunner. "There are a number of people that would consider leaving if
the work that we do is denounced as not good
or not valuable."
At the end of the day, however, Alvanos
wished the stress of the review could have
been avoided. "Three years ago would have
been a good time to sit down and figure out
what to do with the athletic program," he
said. "Had I been informed that this was a
three-year trial period, I would have looked
long and hard before accepting the position.
That's what I struggle with on a personal
level."

New constitution to be put to student vote
Changes include direct election of co-chairs and creation of new representative positions
BY IVAN BOOTHE

After a year and a halfof work, Student Council unani-

mously approved a new constitution Monday. The constitution will be put before the student body for approval the
Tuesday and Wednesday after Thanksgiving break.
If ratified through the studentreferendum, the constitution wouldbe implemented before the upcoming council elections. In addition to needing a majority vote to pass, at least
one-third of the student body must vote for the constitution
to be valid. An all-campus study break will be held next Monday at 10 p.m. to discuss the new constitution.
The new constitution is significantly differentfrom the
original. The most noticeable change is the direct election
of the council co-chairs. Previously, members voted by secret ballot for the two chairpersons.
Under the system of direct election established by the
new constitution, the two chairpersons' terms would be
staggered; one would be elected in the fall and serve during the spring and following fall semesters, while the second would be elected in the spring and serve the following
fall and spring semesters.
In the process of revising its constitution, the council
also re-evaluated the positions on the council, replacing
some and creating new ones. Previously, Student Council
sent representatives to the Curriculum and College Budget Committees and the Council on Educational Policy.
Under the new provisions, two of the old positions will be
condensed into one, with a single educational policy representative serving on both the Council on Educational
Policy and the Curriculum Committee. A financial policy
representative willattend College Budget Committeemeetings.
The treasurer position has been eliminated, with the

duties divided between the secretary and the financial

policy representative. The secretary will serve as an exofficio treasurer and will attend Student Budget Committee (SBC) meetings.

The facilities and space coordinator's duties have been
divided up among two campus life representatives and a
student events advisor.
The two campus life representatives' terms will be staggered like the co-chairs', and they will act as liaisons be-

tween

the student body and the Deans' Office, attending

regular meetings ofthe Deans' Advisory Council. They will

also serve on other committees related to student life as
ex-officio members.
The student events advisor will be responsible for overseeing the Social Affairs Committee and will coordinate
efforts between organizations which host large-scale events.
The charter chair's position has been renamed the student groups advisor. This member will attend SBC meetings and chair the Charter Committee, advising groups on
charter initiations and developments as well as on funding.
A preamble has been added to the constitution. It states
in part, "We are the students of Swarthmore College, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit and hoping to
learn more so that we might somehow make it better." A
footnote describes this preamble as being adopted from the

founding documents of the Students for a Democratic Society.
A mission statement describing the overall aim and direction of the council was also added to the constitution. "SC
shall exist to serve and represent the students ofSwarthmore
College," it reads, "serv[ing] as official representatives of the
student body both to the Swarthmore community and the ex-

ternal world."
Much of the language of the original constitution relating
to elections, referenda and group charters has been re-worded
and made clearer. The new constitution now calls for a written set of bylaws to be used as guidelines for SC meetings.
Previously, SC had only been required to "choose the format
ofits meetings" at the beginning of each semester.
A provision directed at preventing conflicts ofinterest has
been added. It states, "No member whose name appears on
the ballot may sit on Elections Committee."
A motion to declare an election fraudulent now requires

a super majority, or two-thirds of council members, in
order to pass. Specific statutes are also written out giving official guidelines for dealing with "no preference"
and "none of the above" votes, as well as an official margin of error.
Since council co-chairs will now be elected directly by
the student body, a line item has been added prohibiting
any Student Council member for holding more than one

position simultaneously.
Campus organization budgeting is more explicitly itemized, and the appeals process for a group unhappy with its
budget has been reworded.
Under several sections, statutes have been added stating that "no such procedures or guidelines may supersede
this Constitution." In relating to the Social Affairs Committee, the constitution states that "SC has final jurisdic-

tion in all SAC matters."

Committee lends support
to limited coed housing
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

Claire Weiss For the Phoenix

Students wait in line for Essie Mae's Tuesday, the day the bag lunch program was
discontinued following the theft of a C-BORD card-swiping machine from Sharpies.

Coed housing on campus is one step closer
to becoming a reality after the Housing Committee gave its support to a proposal to allow
for the option of coed housing in the Lodges,
Palmer, Roberts and Worth.
Under the proposal, written by Tim
Stewart-Winter 'Ol, all rooms in those dorms
would have the option of being coed, but they
would not be required to be.
The committee is now in the process of
seeking student opinion on the issue. An open
meeting next Monday in the Parrish third
floor classroom will provide students with a
forum for expressing support for or concerns

about coed housing.
The proposal maintains that "manda-

tory same-gender rooming is heterosexist,"
and that a change in policy to allowfor coed
housing should be made in the interest of

fairness.

"Many queer students are less comfortable living with same-gender roommates
than they would be with roommates of the
other gender, because offactors like attraction and homophobia that complicate the
usual issues of compatibility," StewartWinter wrote.
Several other liberal arts colleges, including Haverford, currently permit coed

housing in some form.

■ CAMPUS EVENTS—

Speaker discusses
body projects
BY JONATHAN EHRENFELD
Looking around at her audience as she delivered a
lecture on alterations to the conception or appearance
of the body, author and professor Joan Jacobs Brumberg
commented on the occurrence of what she calls body
projects at Swarthmore. "I don'tsee this happening here
at Swat," she said.
Regardless of whether they could relate to some of
Brumberg's more extreme anecdotes, however, the audience responded favorably to Brumberg's lecture,
which chronicled and analyzed the history of body
projects. It followed a lunch discussion of body projects
among women of color.

Brumberg explained that in order to understandbody
one must first understand the female conception of self. As girls' views of their bodies have changed
with each successive generation, she said, body projects
have in turn changed.
The material for Brumberg's presentation was taken
primarily from diaries, photographs, and advertisements. Diary writing has always been a popular channel for girls to express their emotions, Brumberg said.
While most of Brumberg's diaries come from middleclass women, they are spread among a range of
ethnicities and portray society as a whole.
That society has changed a lot over the years. "Before the twentieth century, girls simply did not organize their thinking around the body," Brumberg said.
During the nineteenth century, the female image of
beauty was determined wholly by men. It was for this
reason that girls squeezed themselves into dangerously
tight corsets and obeyed the prevailing social norms regarding appearance to the letter.
Anorexia nervosa emerged in the late eighteenth century, and mirrors, which came around the same time,
are body projects not often recognized as such, she said.
By the 19205, attitudes had begun to change. Hair
styles underwent a drastic change, not only in terms of
what was viewed as permissible and attractive, but also
in variety as well. Hair, Brumberg said, has remained a
key element in body projects for over a century, as it is
extremely malleable and is a cornerstone of the motherdaughter relationship.
In addition to hair, attitudes toward sexuality
changed during the 19205. The issues of sex and menprojects,

Phoenix editor wins reporting award
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
Phoenix in-depth editor Sonia Scherr
'Ol received second place in the Associated Collegiate Press Reporter of the
Year contest at the ACP's annual meet-

ing for college media, held last weekend
in Washington, D.C.

Scherr was among three finalists for
the award, one of the most prestigious
honors a college reporter can receive.
She won the $5OO prize for three indepth pieces she wrote for The Phoenix
last spring. Two focused on concerns of
college staffand a thirdfeatured women
involved in science at Swarthmore.
Scherr said she enjoyed writing all
three pieces. "I was happy with the staff
[series] because I think it might have increased awareness of staff issues," she
said. "As for women in science, I am interested in science, but I haven't been
able to pursue that here as much as I
would have liked to. The experience of
writing the article allowed me to still be

involved with science at Swarthmore."
Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman, co-editor of

The Phoenix, said Scherr's reporting and
editing skill are responsible for the

newspaper's improvements in investigative journalism. "I'm not sure what we'd
do without [Scherr]," he said. "The quality of the in-depth section you see in The
Phoenix is due exclusively to her work."
According to Ashby-Kuhlman,
Scherr puts in extensive hours. "Every
week, she spends the better part of entire days reporting, writing and editing
stories for us," he said. "The ACP judges
decided well. There's no one I know who
deserves this award more."
Scherr's interest in journalism dates
back to high school. She became editor
of the in-depth section in January.
And, as she prepares to graduate, it
looks like journalism may be in her future, too.
Scherr hopes to find a newspaper internship for this summer and then see

where it leads.

macy.

By the 19505, inhibitions regarding writing and talking about sex, menstruation and body image had decreased even further. This was reflected in an increased
sexual vocabulary and a greater number of clothing and
hair options. Twenty years later, in the 19705, the sexual
revolution marked the beginning of a new era in body
image. This time period held the first wave of comingout revelations from lesbians, who were feeling more
comfortable about revealing their sexuality.
Between the 1980s and the 19905, Brumberg said, the
focus on the body gradually shifted from the verbal and
compositional to the active and visual. This change was
reflected in body projects that consistently became more
apparent and pushed the envelope of acceptability. Today, the proliferation of piercings, tattoos, and plastic
surgery is simply the progression of this trend.
"Virtually every body part is part of the body
project," Brumberg said
Some members of the audience, which was largely
female, were enthused. "I enjoyed the lecture, and it
made me see how this relates to some of what my cousin
is doing," said Cathy Danh 'O4. "It's worrying."
Others thought the talk was little more than interesting. "I thought it was very informative, but I don't
think she did that good a job of showing how different
body projects evolved," said Deanna Wilson 'O4.
Asked about her views on the future of body projects,
Brumberg mused at just what is left to do that hasn't
been done. "It looks as though there's going to be more
projects around the genitalia," she said.

THE PHOENIX

BY KATHRYN TONG

After the human genome project was unveiled this summer,
Americans started speculating on whether the "end to all diseases" was just around the corner. The idea is that once the entire human genome is sequenced, we can prevent all illnesses

from cancer to cystic fibrosis.
In fact, this is one of the most dangerous times in history.
Many of the antibiotics that we take for granted, including penicillin, are becoming obsolete. More people still die of pneumonia
in the world than any other disease. Humans are losing the war
to anti-microbial resistance, as seen in the recent outbreaks of
the plague in India and ebola in the Congo.
Why? Because of the fragile global public health infrastructure, Newsday health reporter Laurie Garrett argues in her latest
book, "Betrayal ofTrust: The Collapse of Global Public Health."
Garrett will be speaking about the book at 4:15 p.m. today in
the Scheuer Room. She is on campus as part of the Swarthmore
Media Fellows program, which is sponsored by the Office of News
and Information and which brings a professional journalist to
Swarthmore each year.
The world's public health systems are not prepared to deal with
the outbreak of disease, Garrett argues. Governments in most developing countries still cannot provide adequate drinking water,
sanitation, and uncontaminated food to their people. Even in the
United States, sales of bottled water have tripled to about $2 billion a year, reflecting increasing distrust of tap water.
The essential covenant between the individualand the government in matters of health, Garrettbelieves, has been broken.
She gives numerous examples ofthehorrific state of public health

in her book, from the plague outbreak in India to the high
death rate in the former Soviet Union. For this book, Garrett
conducted research in five continents, spanning five years.
She begins her book by describing the 1994 outbreak of
pneumonic plague that infected 6,500 people in India. In an
era of jet travel, an outbreak of this magnitude is a global
emergency.
The outbreak put America's public health infrastructure
to the test. Every day 2,000 to 3,000 passengers from India arrive in New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Like the majority of U.S. airports, JFK has no method of
identifyingpassengers that are seriously ill. Thirteen plagueinfected patients were able to come into the country, even
though New York City instituted emergency surveillance measures in 1994.
Through its surveillance measures, the city was able to
find one passenger with plague, three malaria victims, a person with typhoid fever, and four others with various infections. One can only imagine what would have happened if
those 13patients had ebola instead of plague.
Garrett won the Pulitzer Prize in 1996 for "The Coming
Plague," which illustrated the rise of new strains of deadly
infectious diseases. Prior to her current stint as a health reporter at Newsday, she was a science correspondent for Na-

tionalPublic Radio.
Garrett graduated with honors in biology from the University ofCalifornia in Santa Cruz. She left her graduate program in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology at
the University of California at Berkeley to pursue a career in

journalism.

Council discusses proposal to
charge for additional bandwidth

3 burglaries
occur in dorm

Concerns of equity lead council to reject provost's proposal to provide modem-quality bandwidth for a fee
BY IVAN BOOTH E
Student Council tabled a proposal at its
that would offer students extra bandwidth for a price.
The proposal, which was presented to
the council by Stephen Maurer, professor
and associate provost for information technology, and Mark Dumic, manager of networking and systems, would have allowed
students to pay around $4O per semester
for cable modem-quality bandwidth,
around 640 kilobits per second (kbps). As
of this week, the college's bandwidth
shaper is limiting traffic to 256 kbps incoming and 392 kbps outgoing.
Although Dumic said that the specifics
still needed to be worked out, he said that
students wouldprobably be able to try out
the increased bandwidth for a week or so
meeting Monday night

before committing.
Since the college can only purchase
bandwidth in one-megabit blocks, several
students would need to decide per semes-

ter to participate.
Student

Council asked Maurer and

Dumic not to implement the plan yet. "If the
system is in place," Will Ortman 'O2 said, "I'm
worried that there would be no incentive for
the administration to get more bandwidth for
everyone." Several other SC members, including chair Jen Pao 'Ol, also disagreed with the
proposal, citing "equity issues."
Dumic pointed out that the amount of
bandwidth that the college currently provides
is considered generous in the educational
community. He estimated that Swarthmore is
in "the top 20 percent" of schools in amount

of bandwidth provided.
"We should be in the top one percent," Neil
Cavanaugh 'O3 said.
Colin Moore 'O2, who made bandwidth a
priority in his campaign earlier this semester, supported the proposal. He came into the
meeting against the idea, he said, but he later
told Dumic and Maurer, "You've changed my
mind."
Peter Holm 'Ol disagreed with Dumic and
Maurer. "There are some things we shouldn't
do the same as other schools," he said.
Co-chair Jordan Brackett 'Ol felt the same
way. Although he conceded that extra band-

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

width was a luxury item, he questioned
whether the college should only be concerned
with students' academic well-being.
Maurer likened the issue ofbandwidth as
a luxury to central heating and personal dorm
room telephones, once both thought of as a
luxury at the college.
Holm argued that institutionalizing the
proposal woulddo more damage than good for
students. Several members also questioned

the number of students who would opt for the
service.
Tony Hillery 'Ol said that at an RA lunch,
bandwidth had been discussed and the consensus was that "it wasn't affecting very many

students."
Members also cited the need for student
input, possibly with a fireside chat, before
implementing such a plan.
The council will discuss this option, as well
as the possibility of buying more bandwidth
for the school as a whole, at its next meeting.
Information Technology Services is also
planning to investigate further the causes of
slow connections, as Dumic believes that they
are not solely from limited bandwidth.

Several students living in Roberts
had belongings stolen from them
Friday morning. Three rooms in the
dorm were burglarized sometime
between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.
One of the victims had left the
doors to the rooms unlocked because
a male carrying brooms had explained
he would need to clean the rooms
later.
Several hours later, the student
returned and discovered the thefts.
The man was described as white,
possibly in his forties, and about
5'11" with short, dark hair. He was
wearing a red long-sleeved sweater
and jeans on the day the burglary
occurred.
Public Safety and the Swarthmore
Police Department are currently
investigating the burglaries, and are
looking for anyone with information
regarding the incident.
This is the first burglary of this
nature to occur on campus this year.

OPINIONS
I^HWrIMI:

Hello, class of 2005?
With recent developments (or lack thereof) in the
actions of the Athletic Review Committee and, by
extension, the status of athletics at Swarthmore, it is
very hard to predict what the college's next generations are going to be like. But with all the discussion
going on about just who should be here, something is
getting left out of the picture.
Whatever the decision is, it will affect the makeup
of future student bodies. But what about the class of
2002? Seniors will miss their final season. What about
the classes of 2003,2004 and 2005? It is inevitable that
there will be some people at Swarthmore who were
recruited for a sport that will no longer exist next year.
Where were you in mid-November of your senior
year in high school? Early decision deadline just
passed, so maybe you were breathing a (small) sigh of
relief. Or maybe you were still deciding what school
was right for you. The wide variety of sports might
have been a factor in your decision: would you still
have come here if your sport or, if you aren't an
athlete, your favorite activity weren't offered?
What would you do if you had realized that the
college's coaches couldn't negotiate in good faith with you,
uncertain of even their own future? What would it mean if
a significant portion ofcurrent student athletes were to
transfer away from Swarthmore next year? That is indeed
a distinct possibility, depending on the sports that are cut.
By drawing this process out, the college has done a
disservice to the student body of the present and
future. Though the supposed aim of the college is to
improve the state of athletics here at Swat, they have
already significantly set back every sport in their
recruiting efforts for this year. Would you roll the dice
and take the chance that your sport might be eliminated before you had even arrived on campus?

ofit.

Changes in the new constitution aim to correct several
long-standing problems within the organization of the
council. The current constitution provides few institutionalized ways for Student Council to be accountable to the
student body, and voters have suffered as a result. Because
individual members' job descriptions have never been
clear to student electors or even sometimes to those
elected to fill the jobs some positions on the council
became mere soapboxes for members while rarely
accomplishing anything useful.
The new constitution would make significant
improvements. Student Council's leaders, currently called
co-chairs and chosen by the council, would instead be
directly elected by the student body and called copresidents. Students could make a clear and decisive
choice as reflected in the platforms ofthe candidates
for co-president on the general direction of Student
Council semester-by-semester rather than by electing
members on vague campaign promises.
The other positions created in the new constitution
would have more intelligent functions than the current
ones. The new constitution provides for fewer council
positions ofrepresentatives to college committees and more
positions related to studentlife. All the positions have
clearer names and roles, creating more accountability.
Finally, the new constitution sets in stone the council's
practice of adding "none of the above" and "no preference"
to election ballotsrather than solely the option'^abstain."
You should read the proposed new constitution if you
have the time. But a fair summary is that it is just
designed and written more intelligently than the current
one not a bad thing at a school like Swarthmore. Vote
to implement it, and then reap the benefits.

THE PHOENIX

Dear Editor:
In last week's Phoenix, columnist Matt Rubin 'O4 wrote a
clarification about his position on gay marriage. He is evidently in favor of the federal government allowing and condoning gay marriage, and not opposed, which I infer many
people gathered from his column the week before. Though I
do not know this for sure, I gather that Mr. Rubin felt compelled to write the letter since some people on campus had

been quite offended when they found out thatMr. Rubin was
spreading homophobic ideas, and he felt threatened enough
by this to take action. After all, this is Swarthmore, a bastion of tolerance and social change, standing on its own
against a racist, consumer-driven, chauvinistic, homophobic, wealth-dominatedAmerican society that we all despise.
I applaud Mr. Rubin for his steadfast support of gay marriage, and his clarification of his position inspired me to do
some research on which politicians in Washington are discriminatory toward gays. I asked myself, "If I were a homophobic legislator, what bill would I vote for?" The obvious answer is 1996's infamous homophobic Defense of Marriage Act. And who voted for this outrageous, exclusionary,
intolerant act bent on preventing federal recognition of gay
marriage? Why, that hypocritical David Bonior, who claims
to be all liberal, but in reality opposes basic human rights.
Who else did I find? Former representative Floyd Flake, who
apparently cannot seem to recognize that discriminationcan

occur to people other than African-Americans. Who else
voted against the Defense of Marriage Act? None other than
Mr. Homophobe himself, Paul Wellstone. That conservative,
anachronistic Wellstone
he is always opposing the pro-

gressive agenda with his racist and homophobic rallying
calls to America's terribly homophobic culture.
In case anyone doesn't know who PaulWellstone is-, he is
possibly the most progressive and liberal Senate member
the chamber has even seen. And I think it says something
about Swarthmore culture that Mr. Rubin felt compelled to
write a letter because he was afraid that his unclear position on gay marriage would designate him as a homophobe
to the community at large. Perhaps a culture that finds Paul
Wellstone too conservative needs to look in the mirror and
examine whether its designations of people that disagree
with gay marriage and group preferences as homophobes
and racists is fair. Being called a racist or a homophobe is
like becoming Joseph K in Kafka's "The Trial"
it's impossible to logically prove you're not one, and even if you do,
the label sticks with you and takes legitimacy from whatever else you have to say. Perhaps we as a culture need to be
more judicious in our intolerance towards Wellstone's views.
Oh, and, lest anyone think thatI, too, am a homophobe, I
would like to follow Rubin's lead and formally assert my
support for gay marriage.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Swat's liberalism confining
Dear Editor:
I'd say the entire campus, whether or not they actually
had it marked down on their calendar, realized that last week
was decidedly "Coming Out Week" at Swarthmore. It's rather
hard to miss.
Specifically, it was hard not to notice the poster that was
strategically placed on the door of my room. Or the "men loving men" slogan on the way down to Sharpies. Now, I'm a
permissive person when it comes down to just about anything.
I won't go out of my way to say that I'm liberal, because I've
come to the realization that I'm not as liberal as the majority
of the student body. However, I'm perfectly happy with letting people live their lives how they choose, as long as they
let me live mine in peace.
However, when I have to deal with suggestive posters on
my door is when I have to draw the line. I honestly believe
that if I were to start the Heterosexual Club of Swarthmore,
I'd be labeled a violent homophobe and they'd find my body
the next day crucified to the front of Parrish. And I believe
that if I were to place "men loving women" or "90 percent is
not enough. Recruit, recruit, recruit, recruit" on the sidewalk,

I would be lynched. Why? Because for some reason, the same
rules that apply for the majority don't seem to apply for the
minority. What would be construed as nothing more than hateful bigotry on one side of the fence is perfectly acceptable on
the other. In essence, the Swarthmore Queer Union has full
access to the invasive tactics that they decry in the heterosexual majority. And this is the very definitionof hypocrisy.
It all comes down to how "liberal" this campus supposedly
is. I'm less than convinced. After all, doesn't being a liberal
mean that you have an open mind and that you accept all viewpoints? This is definitely not the case. Just ask any Republican on campus. Just ask anyone who has ever dared to verbally disagree with SOU. Many of the "liberals" here are just
as close-minded as their arch-rival conservatives. People here
seem to be very liberal,' but only when people share their
same viewpoints. I have come to accept that these left-wing
extremists (for I can no longer call them liberals) will never
accept their slightly less open-minded counterparts.
And I thought that everything was accepted at a liberal
school. Silly me.
Eric Shang 'O4

Honor code insulting, New movements

often stereotyped

unnecessary
Dear Editor:
I am writing a letter in opposition to the proposed honor
code. An honor code does not necessarily increase academic
integrity, and the supposition that Swarthmore needs such a
code to maintain its academic integrity is ludicrous. Integrity cannot be forced upon a person. It does not rely on a written, artificial code. It instead depends on a person's own view
of morality. Signing a pledge would probably not stop those
students who would cheat under our current academic policy
from cheating. Being forced to sign an honor code, however,
does insult the personal integrity of a student who would never
cheat.
Wisely, the so-called "narcing policy" has been left out of
the proposal, and so the moral dilemmas associated with it
can be avoided. To me, the most disturbing aspect of the proposed honor code is its presentation as a means for
self-scheduled exams. This focus naively ignores both the affronts to personal dignity inherent in an honor code and the
reality that self-scheduled exams (whether by proctor or other
means) are possible without an honor code.
If I am not mistaken, the lack of an honor code has neither
allowed cheating to go unpunished at Swarthmore, nor encouraged mass plagiarism by the student body. That is because
Swarthmore students are generally people of great integrity.
Let's not insult ourselves with the imposition of an artificial
morality. We can think for ourselves.
Kara Spangler 'Ol

Don't suppress athletics
Dear Editor:
I am a Swarthmore student-athlete. I place an enormously
high value on my Swarthmore education, but I also value
Swarthmore athletics to a similar extent. Throughout my
years here, I have seen numerous references to statistical
rankings
primarily as a barometer to measure ourselves
against our supposed liberal arts competitors, namely Will. iams and Amherst. Granted, we do compete quite well with
these schools academically, but what about athletically? There
couldn't be a further divide. Williams' baseball team played
Swat last year and absolutely destroyed our team. I imagine
p. similar results would likely come to fruition if other
Swarthmore athletic teams (women's basketball excluded)
played either Williams or Amherst.
I realize that Swarthmore's Quaker ethos constrains the
ability to which we would ever sacrifice athletics in the name
of academia. Most in the community do not want such an outcome, and I for one am fine with the establishment of an acceptable equilibrium. The argument that Swarthmore cannot
r °r should not field competitive teams because it compromises
the academic integrity of the school, however, is absurd. In
our incessant quest to promote racial, sexual, and religious
equality, I think we are naively suppressing an integral part
of collegiate life.

Jay Schembs 'Ol

Dear Editor:
I am writing in reference to the recent comments about
Falun Gong in the pages of The Phoenix. Falun Gong strikes
me as a deeply meaningful spiritual practice for numerous
practitioners worldwide. I do not find it to be an example of a
dangerous cult that uses drugs and practices mind control.
Many new religious movements are often seen this way. Eucharistic language in early Christian services prompted its
detractors to label it a cannibalistic sect. Today, neo-pagans
are stereotyped as dangerous to the traditional values ofWestern societies. Instead of condemning Falun Gong practitioners as cultists, why not try to learn from them how they
themselves understand the integrity and value of their emerging practices and beliefs?

Chair, Department of Religion

Poverty clarification needed
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Jessica Sheldon and her fellow
Empty The Shelters (ETS) members' letter to the editor "Alternative fallbreak not just community service" (Nov. 2,2000).
While I appreciate the clarification of the purpose of ETS and
give them my respect and encouragement, I have to question
their claim that Kensington is the "poorest district in Pennsylvania, and worldwide." I sincerely hope that they meant
"nationwide" instead of "worldwide,"for although I am not an
expert on international poverty issues, I am certain that there
are other places on the globe that are in worse shape than
Kensington. This may seem nit-picky, but in cases where one
is attempting to clarify one's position and purpose, it is of utter importance that one stay within the correct order of magnitude.

Ville helps UNICEF
Dear Editor:
The Feminist Majority would like to thank all of the
Swarthmore village businesses and residents who contributed
to our very successful Halloween UNICEF drive. Village businesses are often portrayed as apathetic towards students, but
at least in this case, they were more than willing, even excited, to work with us. Although we ran out of boxes before
we could place them in all of the village stores, we would like
to thank the following stores for their participation:
Booksource, Celebrity Deli, The Co-op, Cricket Way, Garnet
Cleaners, Finlandia, Michael's College Pharmacy, My Cousin's
Closet, Poco Loco, Renato's Pizza, The Studio at Swarthmore,
Swarthmore Antiques, Swarthmore Flower Shop, Swarthmore
Hardware and T Bumbles.

Falun Gong not a
cultish practice
Dear Editor:
I was shocked last week to see the Phoenix publish a letter to the editor full of fallacies about Falun
Gong, a mind/body self-cultivationpractice currently
being brutally persecuted in China. Hopefully, when
you received my flyer in your mailbox calling for
support, you were able to recognize the gravity of
the situation.
Unfortunately, the letter's author failed to see the
point of those flyers: instead of reaching out to those
being denied basic human rights in China, he chose
to blame and demonize the victim.
The letter was written under the guise of helping
people, just as the Chinese government has excused
on Falun
their attack both verbal and physical
Gong practitioners. If you can't feel compassion for
these people, don't perpetuate the cruelty. If you can't
support these people, don't sidetrack those who
might have otherwise helped our cause to end the

atrocities in China.
The practice of Falun Gong is wonderful for
health, non-violent, and based on the principles
Truth, Compassion, and Forbearance. Falun Gong
has no "members," no "psychological manipulation
techniques" and no "drug use," as the letter implied.
The claims couldn't be further from the truth.
Many organizations and individuals of goodwill
have come to the aid of Falun Gong practitioners in

I

THE POINT OF THE FLYERS WAS NOT
WHAT THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE, BUT THAT
THEY'RE BEING FIRED FROM THEIR JOBS,
KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES, EXPELLED
FROM THEIR UNIVERSITIES, TORTURED,
RAPED AND BEATEN TO DEATH!

China, such as Amnesty International, Human
Rights Watch, Freedom House, the U.S. Congress, the
U.S. State Department, members of the British Parliament and many others. Lives are at stake here.
All of what was in those flyers was fact information from the Hong Kong Centerfor Human Rights
and Democracy, Amnesty International, the Associated Press, Reuters, the U.S. State Department and
others. No one can deny the injustices being done to
those in China who practice Falun Gong. Neither can
anyone justify it.
The point of the flyers was not what these people
believe, but that they're being fired from their jobs,
kicked out of their homes, expelled from their universities, tortured, raped and beaten to death! How
could anyone question whether those suffering in
China deserve people's support, and further, whether
people should help them obtain basic human rights?
As Mark Palmer, vice chairman of the board at
Freedom House (one ofAmerica's first human rights
organizations) and former U.S. ambassador, said
about Falun Gong, "You can't dismiss this, any more
than you can dismiss Christianity or Buddhism or
Islam or any other great spiritual movement. This
is in my judgement, the greatest single spiritual
movement in Asia today. There is nothing that begins to compare with it in courage and importance."
It is easy to find out what Falun Gong is
come
to one of our events or talk to someone who practices before claiming insider's knowledge. To regurgitate and deepen lies is really regrettable.
At the very least, do not insult and mock those
who are being jailed, brutalized and murdered for
this practice or poison those who would support
them. I'm afraid the letter confused the issues and
propagated misinformation, and at a potentially terrible expense to those in China who might have otherwise gained people's support. I sincerely hope that
this letter, and people's own ability to discern fact
from fiction, will help undo any harm last week's
letter might have caused.

Participation not limited to
merely voting every four years
BY DANN NASEEMULLAH
Most people view politics as what happened last Tuesday night when Al Gore and George W. Bush faced off in the
competitive struggle for states and electoral votes. As the
election drags into its second week with not much hope of
resolution, it's really tempting to throw up our hands in

frustration.

Not only are there two mediocre candidates who do not
talk about issues we really care about, but it seems like the
more mediocre one (in the opinion of the vast majority of
campus) will eventually win, and this after a painfully
drawn-outand dirty battle for Florida's 25 electoral votes.
I feel like there are mixed messages that have come out of
this election. On one hand, your vote really does count when
a few hundred people decide an election involving 200 million. On the other, your vote really doesn't count when the

two candidates' policies look like carbon copies ofeachother
and the only way to choose is on personality, experience,
moral standing or whatever. Whatever else it was, this was
not an election based on policy and ideology.
So what does the 2000 election, whenever it gets resolved,
mean for us? Is it just going to go down in history as a disheartening event thatstructuralist political science buffs pick apart?
I hope that this election will eventually lead to a real
transformation of politics, and that means a redefinition of
the nature of political participation in the United States.
Politics itselfis a term that requires a new definition in the
year 2000. If participation in politics only means voting every four years, then there will be no end to the cynicism
and frustration so evident in the 2000 campaigns.

In last week's Phoenix, College Democrats President
Delonte Gholston speculated that perhaps many
Swarthmore students were not registered to vote due to
"partisan fraud."
Well, I can assure you that was not the case.
I was one of the few, unlucky Swarthmore students who,
after registering on campus, was denied the right to vote. I
was also one of the few who, like Gholston and two others,

went to court to request my right to vote.
Only I, unlike them, didn't get to vote.
At about 10 a.m., after a wonderful discussion with my
philosophy professor, I ambled cheerily on down to the
Swarthmore-Rutledge Elementary School to vote. Since this
was my first election, you can bet I was excited. Before I
went in to vote, I spent ample time talking to all of the
electioneering soccer moms about every candidate. I can
even tell you that Katie True is going to make a wonderful

State Auditor.
When I finally went to vote, I found that I did not have a
registration slip. No problem, the volunteers assured me.
They would just call the board ofelections and get this all
worked out. But although Matthew Rubin in Broomall
County had not yet voted, I did not exist.
Well, the kind women outside were not happy about this.
It was their idea, not mine, to go to the courthouse; they
were not about to put up with my not being allowed to vote,
especially after planning my first-ever vote so carefully.
So, at about 12:30 p.m., I left my Spanish class to meet one
of the election volunteers at her car.
We loaded up her new Lexus and set out to make democracy work for the next generation of American voters.
It didn't.
Our troubles began immediately. We had a hard time
finding where we were supposed to go in the court. After 15 minutes and a couple of you're-in-the-wrong-placeyou-need-to-go-to-that-place-over-there-and-then-come-

backs, we finally found the Center for Government Affairs.
Once there, we waited in line while nobody attended to
us for about half an hour. Finally someone came to help
us. "Who are you?" sheasked. I started to describe my problem. Before I got to the end of the word "student," she had
cut me off. "No, no, no," she said. "Name." I gave her my
name and she left immediately.

THE PHOENIX

In a sense, Naderites were trying to do the right thing but
in the wrong way. Issues like fair trade, environmental regulation, employment at a living wage and the universality of
health care need to enter the political arena. However, presidential campaigns have a way of marginalizing all issues that
don'taffect or influence pivotal groups in society like soccer
moms or seniors.
So what can be done? Well, we can vote with our feet. That's
right, political activism and real democratic participation

are required now. The two major parties are completely centrist, and third-party efforts have been unsuccessful. Whether
the Democrats or the Republicans eventually win the White
House, it's more than likely that many issues will not be addressed. This is indeed an outcome of the system, but the
system cannot and should not define our actions regarding
what we really care about.
We need to start sharing with each other our viewpoints on
what matters to us, and together we can build movements, make
politicians accountable and force issues onto the political agenda.
This engagement and interaction
this commitment to our
says more about the democratic nature of our society
values

than a thousand elections or a billion votes cast.
Our reaction to this election can be a real sign of hope, or
it can be ultimate despair. There is nothing in the rules and
frameworks of our society that limits our capacity as individuals in a political community. It really is our choice
whether we participate at the level of punching holes in a
card once every four years or at the level of positive engagement with the problems and challenges of our times. I happen to think that America itself is a little too special a project
to be left to election-year politics.

System disillusioning
for new voter
She returned 20 minutes later. "Mr. Rubin, I think we have
found you," she said. "You should have been voting in
Broomall." I explained to her that I had gone through this
before, and so she told me to get in another line to see the
judge.
I was in this line for another half-hour or so. I would note,
however, thatthis line was productive. While waiting, I met a
retired army officer who gave me the names, locations, and
membership fees of many localrifle ranges. He then explained
to me that there was no way I was going to exercise my right
to vote, at least not in this election, since we were in "good old
Delaware County."
My faith only a bit shaken and having no idea (yet) what
he meant by this, I was still quite excited when some court
employee (she never mentioned who she was) took me up an
escalator and, after a small delay, led me into the courtroom.
I had no idea what was going on or what I was petitioning for,
though they announced it rapidly to the judge without telling
me. In fact, all they told me was where to stand.
Before I knew it, I had sworn an oath and was being questioned about my residence, registration procedure, etc. The
questions, as Gholston noted, seemed to go on forever. After
telling my story, the judge concluded that no one in my situation could possibly be given the right to vote. I argued with
him about the effort that I put in, how others who had registered just like me had voted, and so on. But no, I was not going to vote in my first election.
Unlike Gholston and friends, I was not provided with a
public attorney. Nor was I finally allowed to vote. And yes, I
am a Republican. So no, it was not partisan fraud.
It was, however, a disgusting display of democracy in action. I have been taught about disillusioned students before; I
have been taught that politics are supposed to be inaccesible
and full of red tape. Truth is, I never believed most of this
teaching; I always saw most of this so-called dissatisfaction
as an excuse for apathy. Until I tried to exercise one of my
most fundamental, democratic rights, that is.
I tried to explain to the judge that at a time when students
are disillusioned and voting less than any other age group,
denying the vote to a student who took hours to go through a
legal process was an irrational decision. He wouldn't listen,
though. Instead he cut me off, apologized, and sent me on my
way. And on that way, like those I have always been taught
about but only now understand, I continue.

Naderite: hold fast
to long-term goals
BY GABRIEL HETLAND

With the presidential question still in the balance, many
liberals are rightly becoming scared that George W. Bush
may end up in the White House come January. In wondering why, many are pointing a rage-filled finger at Ralph
Nader as the scapegoat responsible for Gore's troubles.
Given the stakes for progressive politics and a third party
in the United States, it's important to have cool heads prevail in assessing the impact of Nader's run.
There are a few important questions, with big consequences at stake. First, just how much blame can
be placed on Nader's shoulders if Gore loses the election? Second, what are the differences between Gore
and Bush, and how important are these differences?
And third, why was Nader running in the first place,
and how important was his run?
In the rush to blame someone, Nader is seen as
the sole reason that Gore might lose, ignoring Gore's
failure to capitalize on a successful administration and
good economic times. He lost many key states, including his home state, and continuously bumbled opportunities to pull away in the campaign. And according
to a CNN poll, only 47 percent of Nader voters would
have voted for Gore. Thirty percent would not have
voted at all, and 17 percent would voted for Bush.
This means that even if Nader had not run, Gore's
edge over Bush would have only been increased by 30
percent of Nader's total votes, showing the relative flimsiness of the argument that a vote for Nader is a vote
for Bush. Admittedly, in Florida 30 percent of Nader's
votes probably would have put Gore ahead, but blaming Nader alone fails to take this into account.
When choosing who to vote for, many progressives
cited the short-term losses that a Bush presidency could
entail, including a rollback of social and educational
spending, Bush's death penalty record and a possible
threat to abortion rights. These differences are important, but they should not be overestimated, as Gore has
continuously talked of reducing the federal government,
also supports the death penalty and doesn't have the
strongest record in abortion rights himself. There are
differences, but many simply cannot be accurately predicted beforehand and are of somewhat dubious values as arguments against voting for Nader.
In the rush to blame someone if Gore ends up losing
the reasons that Nader ran in the first place are being
increasingly forgotten. Foremost is the continued and
overwhelming influence of money in politics, which means
that public officials are increasingly subject to corporate
interests rather than human ones. From this corporate
influence flow many of the Democrats' recent conservative policies, including free-market trade policies that put
profits ahead of human rights and the environment, the
gutting of the social safety net and a murderous foreign
economic and military policy that is wreaking havoc in
Iraq, Colombia and places all around the world.
The consequences of continued U.S. government
policies and the influence of money in politics which
go hand-in-hand will have direct and deadly effects
on millions in the United States and overseas. These
are the reasons that Nader ran and they remain tremendously important.
I know many progressives who struggled with the
Gore/Nader dilemma in swing states, and others who
continue to point to short-term issues as so fundamental that no support should go to Nader. I understand
these concerns, as rational people who care about both
short- and long-term goals can vote in different ways.
In this emotional time, I implore everyone to keep a
cool head and remember just why Nader ran, and to
understand why this movement is so important, in both
in the long and the short term.
I didn't vote for Ralph Nader to be self-righteous or
to make a glamorous protest statement. I voted for him
because I think thatthe consequences of not changing
the system are so deadly that something has to give.
For millions in the ghettoes of Philadelphia, the sweatshops of Managua and especially in the fields and mountains of Colombia and Iraq, there needs to be a change.
It cannot keep waiting until the time is right.

A PRO AND
A CON

Take a stand
against rape
I find the advocacy of rape highly problematic.
Apparently, some Swatties do not.
Last week, in need of "a big finish," a fellow Phoenix columnist mentioned that a fellow student had
urged others to "press the 'rape' button" during a video
game. The author then concluded, "let he who is without sin administer the beat down." My interpretation
of this statement is: We all say dumb things occasionally. Thus, when others advocate rape in a moment of
innocuous thoughtlessness, no one who has made stupid statements has the legitimacy to take a stand.
I find these comments to be dangerously offensive.
Since I don't want to be affiliated with an organization
that offends me, I am resigning as a columnist for this
newspaper. Swarthmore, like every other college and
university, has a culture of rape. By culture of rape, I
mean that there are certain individuals, organizations,
and institutional functions that facilitate the milieu for
the rape of women. Some examples include individuals who joke about rape, organizations that grant individuals the means to air these views, and institutional
guidelines that make it such that women who are raped
do not have an avenue of recourse. (Like, oh, I don't
know, the fact that the burden of proof to win a College
Judiciary Committee rape case is absurdly high. This
is one explanation for why there hasn't been a CJC trial
regarding rape in three years. Of course, it could be
that Swarthmore hasn't had a rape in three years. Or it
could be that the CJC is stacked such that women know
their rapists won't be convicted, as the last CJC rape
trial tragically demonstrated.)
But that's not why I'm offended. I'm offendedbecause
the aforementioned article protects the culture of rape
by equivocating all forms of thoughtless stupidity.

There is an enormous difference between "kind" and
"degree."

For this reason, I fundamentally disagree with the
author. I believe the culture of rape compels each of us
to always take a stand against people who want us to
"push the "rape' button." True, we all have our stupid
moments, but I think certain extreme moments of stupidity (like, say, advocating rape) demand immediate,
vigilant refutation.
If we don't stop laughing, look the jokester in the
eye, and tell him he's wrong; if we don't go to the deans
and say that it's not a he-said/she-said rape not-guilty
verdict for the CJC if there was clear medical evidence
supporting the woman's accusation; if we don't take a
stand against people who write in newspapers about
how we shouldn't "administer the first beat down" unthen we tacitly support a
less we are "without sin"
culture that allows the cycle of rape to continue against
women.
They are our girlfriends, our sisters, our mothers,
and our friends. They are our professors, our varsity
athletes, our fellow students, and our hallmates. And
they deserve a hell of a lot better than to have their
ordeals reduced to one writer's "big finish."
College isn't the place to "do many very stupid
things," as the article's headline suggests. College is
the place to fight for what you believe in, especially
when it might prevent the fulfillment of the statistical
survey that found that one in four women will be sexually assaulted during their four years of college.
The fight against the culture of rape starts now.
The responsibility is not just at the feet of women, but
everyone. So when you finish reading this article, tell
your friends that rape jokes are not only crass or inappropriate, but also facilitate an environment that
condones rape. Tell the newspaper editors that you
are outraged that they don't edit out comments that
tacitly support pro-rape sentiments. And tell yourself
that the culture of rape is something you are against,
even it means you have to resign from a position you
love.

Honor code: if it ain't broke, don't fix it
BY ANDY KARR
I considered going to college in rural Massachusetts. During my senior year in high school, my sense of geography
was so Midwest-centered that I thought the whole state was
a big suburb of Boston. Once I realized what it's actually
like out there, I ruled the truly rural schools out, leaving
Swarthmore and Grinnell atop my list. I chose Swat and am
glad I did. I've been here for two years, and I'm comfortable.
I wish people would stop trying to change my mind for me.
Even if someone were to move all the buildings and the
people to rural Massachusetts, ideologically Swarthmore
would still be where it is today: exactly where it should be.
The latest evidence of this disturbing trend towards geographical confusion has come in a strange form: the honor
code proposal brought before the Student Council a few weeks
ago ("Solomon proposes honor code," Oct. 26), a proposal the
council is apparently considering.
Change is not an inherently good thing. Sure, ifsomething's
wrong, I'll be the first to say, "let's fix it." But I'm not sure
what problem the proposed honor code wouldfix. Ifthere has
been an increase in academic dishonesty scary enough to merit
a policy change, why haven't we heard about it?
True, there have been cases ofacademic dishonesty, but I
don't see how an honor code would change that. In the student handbook, there's already a 35-page section
representing the bulk of the book
devoted to "Rules, Regulations and Student Conduct." To me, that section of the handbook, particularly the part about academic honesty, is crys-

tal clear. Cases of academic dishonesty can go in front of the
College Judiciary Committee, a body representing the students, the faculty, and the administration. If the current
policy is failing, shouldn't we expect to hear about it from
that body, not from students?
Furthermore, how could a student-imposed honor code be
reconciled with a school whose policy expects "that students
assume responsibility for helping to sustain an educational
and social community where the rights ofall are respected?"
When I decided to come to Swarthmore, I also decided to
accept the rules of Swarthmore College as a member of that
community. As someone who mostly follows the rules, I did
not expect anyone, much less fellow students, to impose more
rules on me without cause. That's one of the things I like
most about Swarthmore: the college treats us as adults. For
the most part, my interactions with other Swarthmore students have led me to believe that we live up to the standards
of our community. We do, in fact, act like adults, and our
current system treats us likeadults. Our honor code doesn't
need to be signed; it is lived.
I think the policy works, and I don't see any reason to
change it. I've heard only one possible benefit: un-proctored
exams. Considering the potential for paranoia and at the very
least, more paperwork, if we want un-proctored exams, I think
we should try to get themwithout any additional regulations.
I have no reason to believe the current policy is failing. I
have no reason to believe the benefits of an honor code could
outweigh the costs. I have no reason to believe I should transfer to rural Massachusetts.

Letter propagates many fallacies about Falun Gong

Dear Editor:
At a campus of intelligent, discerning people that prides
itself on toleranceand respect for difference, Bjorn DittmerRoche's Nov. 9 letter to the editor ("Falun Gong flyer misleading, exaggerated") came as a shock. The accusation that
Falun Gong "strictly advocates" itself "as a replacement for
'Western' Medicine" and that students "refuse even antibiotics" is not in anything ever written or said by Li Hongzhi,
Falun Gong's teacher, or any of the practice's students. Plenty
of people who practice Falun Gong take medicine.
It was Falun Gong's healing efficacy, in fact, that had much
to do with its remarkable growth. Before political winds
shifted, the Chinese government actively supported Falun
Gong for years, largely for its health benefits. Local practitioners have been invited by Americorps to teach the prac-

tice to its medical staff.
The author pinned Falun Gong as a "cult" that uses "psychological manipulation." The only evidence he gave for this
claim was "the ridiculousness of their beliefs." He implies
that if he disagrees with someone's beliefs, thatperson must
have been psychologically manipulated and lost "full command of [his] own thoughts"!
All ofthis is topassively reiterate the Chinese government's
recent, venomous rhetoric used to justify its evil actions. The
government's claims are effective only as much as the public
is ignorant. Let's not breed ignorance here at home.
Hearsay and thirty minutes surfing the Web hardly qualify
anyone to represent this practice. And the author apparently
wrote without having talked to a single person who practices
Falun Gong.

ON BEHALF OF THE

BY JONAFTGOLD

What have you been up to lately?
Other than this tour, I've been trying to construct a special recording studio so I can finish my new record that probably will come out some time in the next century. It's going to
be a double album, and it's going to have a lot of the songs
that you guys are going to hear in Swarthmore on Friday. I've
put together a new band.... I've got an amazing keyboardist...
Skel Dalrymple
Monica Boußou, the violinist and special
friend. And then there's Colby Stark, our new drummer
and he's our drummer from Lincoln, Neb. And we're going to
come, and we're going to create a sort of cruise-ship-like
atmosphere. I hope we can play two sets. I'd like to
have an introspective spacey set and a more
rocking set.... I asked earlier if I'd be able to
get an honorary degree from Swarthmore
do you have any pull?
...

...

..

Not particularly. I heard you
went to art school.

No. I went to military acadIt
emy. But uh
you know
would be great ifI had even just

like a Bachelor's. Just something so I can get my foot in
the door. A lot of job oppor-

tunities are really closed to
me; so an honorary degree
wouldreally come in handy.

with animated cartoons and fast food franchises...with
animatronic dolls that serve my favorite foods, which
would be vegetables and soft fruit. We have a new range of
animated characters that are on our T-shirts now.
What are your thoughts on the current election
situation?
I think that obviously the Bush campaign will probably
stop at nothing to ensure their victory, and seemingly the
Gore people are willing to be elected via court order, and I
think it's a pretty sad state of affairs all around. I think it's
kind of amazing how close that election really is. It's odd
to foliow it... sort of surreal really. I voted for Gore myself
because the concept of Bush being elected president because his dad was seems very un-American to me. In point
of fact, I'm actually a sort of benevolent socialist myself.
Now that the divinity gig is up, have you considered
"Bobby Conn 2004"?
I'm not interested in holding any kind of political office
myself.... Given my short attention span and my inattentiveness to detail, people under my rule would be unhappy. It would be aesthetically more pleasing if I was in
charge, but I think overall probably a lot of the details of
economy would fall on the wayside. I'd probably disband
the military, and perhaps we would be overrun by wildlife. I'd probably lose interest after about a year, and I'd
wander off, and people would find me in like a bar or something. I think I could give more to my country if I learned
how to dance better. I also don't think America's willing to
elect someone who's small and fuzzy as I am. They didn't
like Ross Perot very much. He's not really fuzzy... He's
kind of small and lizardy.
...

...

What would you want a
degree in?
Um, a degree in, like,
philosophy probably, or barring that marketing.

I've suffered sort of a setback in
that this year my birthday came, and

as it turns out I'm just an ordinary mortal. I had this premonition that I was some
kind of divine person, and as it turns out
I'm n0t.... I've had to sort of rethink my
whole agenda. Because I really had a lot
riding on this whole divinity thing and it
hasn't come to pass, so here I am stuck in
a mortal body like yourself, so I have to
get eight hours of sleep a night, and
eat three meals a day, and pay

'Titans' poignant
BY MORGHAN HOLT
A football movie? My friend sighed and snorted,
scoffing at my proposition to see the only flick that
would work into our busy schedules. I had to be
joking, he said. He thought he knew me better than
that. For God's sake. A football movie?
With a little coaxing and the employment of my
superior whining skills, he finally conceded. He'd see
the show, if only to appease me and burn up some
otherwise idle time, but not before emphatically
asserting that he'd really expected more from me
than to want to watch some mindless football movie,
even if Denzel Washington was playing the lead.
Maybe Washington's gorgeous face and truly
admirable acting were factors, but they alone were
not what drove me to beg my friend to accompany
me to the movie. Having seen the previews for
"Remember the Titans," I was lured by its promise to
address racial issues in a high school setting at the
height of the segregation movement, with a football
team, of all things, as its medium. And all of it is
based on a true story.
Indeed, as soon as Washington's face came onto
the screen and he assumed the role of hard-ass Titan
football coach Herman Boone, who is in the process
of assisting in the desegregation of the district's

experimental high school, I was impressed.
Washington, as usual, is believably passionate
furiously spewing tirades about race and equality and
humanity in general and fighting against the system
as well fighting against the now-subordinate Titan exhead coach, played by a very white and very resentful
Will Patton. The struggle with which coach Boone is
faced is that of creating a team that is functional
both on the field and off, of sculpting the racist, bullheaded, hormonal players into a group of dedicated,
accepting men who will, in their unity, win games and
act as shining examples of open-mindedness for their
hate-filled classmates and community.
Not the first racism flick Washington has tackled,
"Remember the Titans" certainly has a different twist.
It's the story of a man, nay, a pillar who withstands
the torment of his white neighbors, employers and coworkers. A man who manages, through his fierce
integrity and almost frightening determination, to
integrate his hostile team and to convince his

subordinates that he is much more than a hairless
monkey as his opponents had claimed; in all truth, he
is probably more deserving of the position than they
or at least more competent. Indirectly, Coach
Boone's remarkable accomplishments with the Titan
team impact the greater community. The team's unity
in the face of cries for re-segregation and racism
rampant in the halls of the school and on the streets
of the city, reverberate in the cheers of the team's
fans, who are thrilled by the team's surprising
winning streak. The effect is overwhelming, though
not easily achieved.
Moreover, it is convincing, perhaps because of its
true-life basis, but even more so because Washington
and his supporting cast carry the anti-racism theme
well. They make it work: what might otherwise have
been a lousy football movie, focusing on the violence
of players, the outrageousness of the team's plays
and the sound effects of the helmets grinding against
heads, helmets grinding against shoulders and
helmets grinding into the field.
"Remember the Titans" transforms a simple game
into something bigger, something symbolic. It makes
the brutality and aggression of a great American
pastime into a symbol of the struggle to override
another unfortunate American pastime
racism. In
all, the movie works. All of it: the jerseys and punts,
the irate coach, the frustrated team and the
unsuspecting crowd, whose minds are eventually
transformed, like those of the players. I was putty in
Denzel Washington's hands, mouth agape as he
hollered harshness at his team and fellow coaches,
forcing back tears as their victory leaps from the field
into their lives, as his dreams and theirs come true.

Get into your groove
thang: lessons on partying

Erica Cartmill For The Phoenix

BY ERICA

CARTMILL

It's Friday afternoon, and you've just woken from your
end-of-the-week, post-paper collapse. You start (like every good
Swattie) to make your agenda for the weekend. Gazing at a
pile of laundry, you resign yourself to an evening of domestic
duties and last week's econ reading. Then a little voice screams
in your ear, "WAKE UP! COME AND PARTY!!"
The voice, it turns out, it is actually that of your roommate, who, having returned triumphant from a victorious
rugby match, has already begun the night's pre-party festivities. Perhaps you are moved by the excitement and joy in her
face, or possibly you realize that you are out of dryer sheets.
Either way, you relent and agree to pry yourself from IM and
econ and meet her at a party.
Now what do you do? Fortunately for you, I, a reasonably
experienced partygoer, have put pen to paper to show you the
way in five easy-to-follow steps.

Get "Cute." This could entail putting on those tight bitch
pants or new Dockers, the silver strappy sandals or the clingy
Structure T, or whatever you feel is necessary to positively
affect your state of mind. Note: for a Swat party the entire
process should take no more than 20 minutes. Remember that
most parties are dark and crowded and people are sufficiently
inebriated that only you will be aware of how you look. What
is noticeable is your attitude; so put on whatever will make
you feel bold, outrageous and ready to "get down."
Prep Your "Groove Thang." No one walks into a party
and slips naturally into the sea of bobbing, swiveling and groping that is the dance floor. People need a little revving up.
Before you can begin to be comfortable "backing your ass
up" around people you'll see in seminar on Wednesday, you
need to psych yourself up. So whileprepping to go out "on the
town," put on that Britney Spears or N'Sync MP3 that you've
been trying to hidefrom your friends and move around a little
more than usual. This is also a great time to try out that
Michael Jackson pelvic thrust that might not make the final
cut. But the knowledge that it lurks in your hot-sexy-dancemoves repertoire will shoot your mojo through the roof.
Hint: To maximize your brazenness, dance practice is best

done between showering and dressing. This does not apply if
you live on the first floor of Dana or Hallowell and don't have
curtains.

The All-Important Entrance. This is so essential to
party success that it has subcategories:
a) Show up with friends or acquaintances, or that girl
from math class you ran into on the way over. Unless you
are meeting people there or are guaranteed to be the life of
the party (in which case you shouldn't be reading this),
the two minutes spent alone trying to find someone you
know can totally ruin your confidence and turn you off to
a party.
b) Lingering by the door is something that can work
either for you or against you depending on how it's handled.
The entrance area draws a lot ofattention from people who
are already at the party scoping out new arrivals. Pausing
near the door, rather than plunging into the fray, will give
you the opportunity to see who's at the party and will allow people, whether they're your close friends or just the

general masses, to see that you've arrived.

Hint: Don't survey the room in an obvious way. Peer-

ing over the heads of the crowd will single you out as someone who is looking for a support system. The more confident and at-home you can look, the more memorable an
impression you will make.
Hit the Bar. Whether you drink or not, visiting the
bar gives you a good excuse to schmooze. Also, waiting in
line for the bar gives you a chance to look around the party
some more without standing awkwardly to one side. Ask
the people around you what's good; then you can either
take their advice or order a Sprite.
Walking around the edge of the crowd on the dance floor
is infinitely more comfortable with a drink in hand; you
can always use it as an excuse to get out of an undesirable

situation.

Some examples to prove my point: "I think I'll sit "Big
Pimpin'" out. I want to finish my drink." "Oh God, I spilled
cranberry juice on myself. I'm gonna go wash it off."
You can also use your drink as a way to "get a little
closer." Things like "I'm going to go get a drink. Do you
want something?" or better yet "Do you want to come?"
are great ways to single out someone from the crowd.
It's All About the Pelvis. Getting out onto the dance
floor can be the most intimidating thing at a party. None of

Little girl
in a big city

The names used in this article have been changed.
Every Swattie has seen them. They vary in size
and appearance, ranging from tiny middle-schoolers
to large, surly punks who are far cooler than Swatties
and know it. They skate the library steps, sit in the
circle ofbenches on the way to the Co-op and from
time to time have been known to drive around late
at night, waving large inflatable animals at unsuspecting Swatties. Like the psychotic squirrels and
those adorable spec tour groups, the youth of the
town of Swarthmore are, without question, a part of
the campus.
We here at Swat tend to think ofthem as not much

I fell in love over the weekend. And it was beautiful, maddening, awe-inspiring, and intense: the head-over-heels sort that
I always imagined true love should and would be. My mother
will be giddy when I tell her. I can almost hear her now, excitedly grilling me: Is he good-looking? Cultured? Entertaining?
Witty? Lively? Does he make your hair stand on end and your
heart pound wildly in your chest? And I'll answer her, telling
her what I know she wants to hear: Yes, yes, yes! Just one thing,
Mama: my love is not a he.
She'll be shocked at first, I'm sure. But she'll recover quickly,
masking her surprise (and perhaps dismay) with understanding, accepting and reassuring comments that come too fast, and
seem disturbingly rehearsed. She'll tell me that she's had a
hunch, and that, given my distaste for and dissatisfaction with
relationships with men, she should have seen it coming. Some
sick part of me will snicker, listening to my mother's uneasy
babble, and urge me to continue the charade. But my more sensitive side, the part of me that loves my mom and doesn't want
to hurt her by messing with her head, will break down, forcing
me to tell her that I am not a lesbian.
My love is neither a he nor she. My love spoke to me, taught
me more than I ever could have fathomed. My love wooed me

a distraction from that reading we've been putting
off, an annoyance when we're taking a hot date to
Renato's. These, our fellow residents of a small, notterribly-exciting town, are just kids, and they are
doing what kids do. It's a struggle we may never comprehend, forced as we are to juggle work, activities,
sleep and socializationat an inhuman pace. But their
struggle is a struggle nonetheless.
Welcome to the life of a Swarthmore teen: the life
of trying to find something more entertaining to look

"There's not much to do around here," John says,
practically as an introduction, as he leans against
the wall ofthe Swarthmore Co-op. Two similarly clad
teenagers, standing with their bikes, introduce themselves as Mike and Joe.
John and his friends are local kids, students at
the high school that is only a ten-minute walk from
campus. They are just a few of the non-collegiate
youth from the sleepy borough of Swarthmore,
which they never refer to as "The Ville," who are
forced to seek amusement without the benefit oftenpage lab reports and intramural sports to fill their
waking hours.
In light of the amount of disturbance a collection
of 1400 or so 18-to-22-year-olds has the potential to
create, it's somehow comforting to learn that their
feelings about us are, all in all, pretty ambivalent.
They do not hate us as much as we might fear. Nor
do they crack Swattie jokes comparable to our "Ville
Rat" quips. "The college isn't bad," John says, explaining his feelings toward Swat. "Just too far up-

finer things in life. So I guess that's out of the picture.

Kids: bored, but alright

BY MORGHAN HOLT

New York, mi amor, burst my precious bubble ruthlessly
and without qualm. When my lovely bubble popped, it splattered, spitting my identity, my inescapable uncultured country bumpkin roots, in my face.
New York City is like nothing I've ever seen, nothing I've
ever experienced before. The biggest Montana metropolis boasts
a population of just slightly more than 90,000. And it has no
street vendors, no glass-faced buildings that stretch endlessly
into the clouds, no strips of sinfully over-priced designer boutiques, and it sure as hell has not got Broadway.
It fascinated me, this concrete, capitalist paradise, so much
that I suddenly wanted my own cache of bad habits
my own
mysterious, sketchy lifestyle. I wanted to live among all these
beautiful, diverse people. I wanted to smoke and drink too much,
to wear too much eyeliner and painfully crimson lipstick, to
dress entirely in black, and to rent myself an insrjiely costly,
uninhabitable apartment overlooking Madison Avenue where
I could live in peace and pseudo-artistic oblivion, surrounded
by but disconnected from the several million people with whom
I shared my love. For the life of me, I'd have done it if I could.
I'm not sure I still wouldn't.
I dined luxuriously in New York, eating foods whose names
I refuse to attempt to pronounce and filling my belly with mystery munchies whose taste had no Montana comparison. I saw
"Cabaret" in New York, and I was gripped by the fast-paced,
entertaining story, the throaty, trilling voices, covered in
goosebumps, trying to prevent myself from squealing with excitement. I've never seen a show that good. Certainly, no recent
Hollywood release could begin to match the intensity andforce
and provocation of this musical (I thought I hated musicals,
but this was no "Oklahoma").
I sat in Studio 54, admiring the leopard-print carpet, the surreal environment. Glancing at the woman on my right, dressed
entirely in Gucci and sporting a necklace ofrocks worth more
than I'll ever be, I crossed my ankles anxiously, hoping to conceal the hole I'd torn in my nylons earlier that evening. I felt
horribly out of place, surrounded by such glamorous, elegant
people. Their lives, their incomes, they seemed unreal to me,
like I was floating in a fantasy. I couldn't help thinking that

biking the steps and parking lots of Swat grounds.

as I am by stress-induced migraines, burning, embittered intolerance, and a general disdain for the American public, and
accustomed as I am to wide, open spaces, lush, green fields, an
enormous sky free of pollution and its nasty effects, and, of
course, looming, majestic mountains.
I could probably never really live in New York; I'd suffer
severe hypertension. I can picture myself trying to cope with
the obscene traffic, my major arteries bulging and bursting all
over the place. I'd be forced to take up smoking and routine
heavy drinking justto deal. I'd be flat broke living in New York;
the lack of vegetation (the only glimpse of greenery I got while
I was in the city was the potted plants outside our hotel, which
I'm pretty sure were fake) would eventually get to me. It simply wouldn't work.
But I can dream. In spite of the lack of vegetation and the
overwhelming commotion, I can't help wishing I were one of
the millions, rushing frenzied down the street, trying desperately to catch a cab to my ultra-important business meeting,
strolling casually through Times Square, exuding my artsy-ness,
my mysteriousness, my intrigue, hustling people on the corner, desperately trying to convince them that my bootleg wares
are as good or better than the higher-priced product in the display window behind me. I couldn't help wishing I could blend
intothe crowd, that I could have a life that was at once interesting and all my own. I'vebeen at Swarthmore too long, I thought,
as we left New York, and I realized that what I loved most about
the city was its extreme city-ness, its anonymity. That is, if you

parties, but these three particular borough youths
know what every good Swattie knows: "college parties are lame." Besides a little bit of on-campus antagonism from mocking students, and some friendly
rivalry with the one or two Swattie skaters, they
have little actual interaction with college students.
However, they do sometimes take advantage of
the fact that college students tend to be both tolerant and over eighteen. According to John, "pretty
much every kid in Swarthmore smokes," starting
from middle school or "sometimes earlier." Though
some college students refuse to provide tobacco to
Ville teens, many are still ready sources of tobacco
products. The reason given for this highrate of nicotine addiction? Boredom, obviously. The same motivator for everything else the ville kids do in this

j

town.

The phrase "there's nothing else to do," in some
form or another, comes up more often than any other
in conversations with these kids. "We come up here
and sit around, skate, get in trouble, [are] bored,"
Mike says, detailing the activities of a standard weekend. After-hours excitement is particularly hard to
find in a town where most things close at six or seven
in the evening. Some villers even hang out at Wa-Wa
from time to time: it's that bad.
The only excitement for ville teens comes when
they actively try to make their own fun. Like the
time someone who was unable to understand the
concept "do not leave donations after hours," left
some old furnishings by the local Goodwill at night.
"We took the stuff... and broke it," says Mike. "That's

Some love advice
from an expert
BY JOEY SPADOLA
This campus is facing a devastating problem. Despite the
overachievementof the student body, despite all the accolades and laurels
and widespread use ofbig words, there is one thing Swatties cannot figure
out for the life of them, and that thing is love.
Now, I happen to be an expert in this domain, because I had a girlfriend once. Well, I went on a date once. And even though my parents
came along, I learned an immeasurable amount.
What's more, by watching the "Ricki Lake Show" with the fidelity of a
neutered German Shephard, I have come to be better acquainted with the
intricacies of love than even Ken Starr. (Incidentally, next week's "Ricki
Lake" episode is "Your ex-boyfriend's dentist is having an affair with your
second cousin twice removed on your mother's side, who has at one time
or another slept with all four of your former high school history teachers
and has a decided fetish for Tipper Gore look-alikes." If this applies to you,
please contact the American Department of Statistics, which has issued a
statement asserting that any such person, by the laws of probability, cannot exist.)

You're probably thinking that my experience in matters of love does
not seem all that extensiveand that whatever advice I have to offer cannot
possibly be useful. So before I set out to solve what went wrong with the
"Quaker matchbox," I first must establish my qualifications.
You see, although my success with relationships has been admittedly
unimpressive, ladies have nonetheless played a very major role in my life,
in much the same way that the Battle of Waterloo played a large role in
Napoleon's life. I cite these examples to support my claim: 1.1 was a strict
vegan for a number of years, until a girl came along and seduced me into
eating a bacon double cheeseburger. 2.1 used to be happy with what I had
achieved in life, until a girl came along and told me that getting really
high scores in "Donkey Kong" was nothing to be too proud of. 3. I had
planned on going to the tenth-grade Halloween party as a vampire, until a
girl came along and told me it would be far "cuter" if I were to go as Mary
Poppins. So I know first-hand as well as any, whenit comes down to it, just
how malicious women are
I mean, how tough love is.
My authority on the matter being thus proven, let us turn to the problem at hand. That is, why does a school in which free love ought to reign
supreme produce about as much relationship activity as a Buddhist monastery?
The problem, I have determined, is that the student body, by and large,
does not consider the opposite sex here to be all that attractive. The men,
for example, can be heard describing the school as the "Swarthmore County
Dogpound," or, in more refined circles, "Le Chateau Bow Wow." The
women, on the other hand, are quick to point out that the male population
here has the combined charm and social tact of an untamed walrus (the
plural of which, incidentally, is "walrii," according to trustworthy grammatical sources, such as "The Collected Writings of George W Bush").
Now, I believe that both views are just not fair. There are plenty of
individuals at Swarthmore, both men and women, who are extremely beautiful in their own unique way, so that any normal, uninhibited person
might pursue them with full zeal, as long he or she is sufficiently intoxicated and is not a stickler for personal hygiene.
The problem lies, therefore, not with the physical attributes of the student body, which is comparable in looks to the cast of "Friends," not including Jennifer Aniston, whom even Swarthmore cannot hope to match.
Swatties, to put it frankly, have set their sights too high.
I long for the day when love-struck students, having at last set for themselves reasonable standards, say such things as, "Look at that hottie! He
can even stay on his feet when he dances" or "Man! You can hardly notice
that her face resembles a Newfoundland Beagle's." Following the maxim
"beggars can't be choosers," I require only that my objects of desire (a)
have a pulse and (b) know my name, because relationships can be rough
when your beloved refers to you by the phrase "Hey you."
As for what causes students here to have such high standards, I blame
television. More specifically, I blame the show "Boy Meets World" (which

should be entitled "Boy Meets Mid-life Crisis," because the main charac-

ter is approximately 38 years old now, though he still seeks the daily advice of his neighbor and high school principal Mr. Feeney, who in a current episode delivers Topenga's third child in the backyard).
The reason I blame this show is simple. In real life, a guy as positively
goofy as boy-who-meets-world could never get a girl like Topenga. Not even
with pick-up lines thought up by Mr. Feeney. Such unrealistic hogwash
should not beallowed on television, what with the way it pollutes the young
minds of ugly individuals across the nation, many of whom, sad to say,
end up at Swarthmore.
Why build up the hopes of the tragically charmless? For them, having a
conversation with such a girl, never mind having a love eternal since age
four, would be impressive. So why pretend a character played by Ben Savage, now a balding, middle-aged bachelor, who recently appeared on "Love
Connection," can have anything more than a prayer in hell?
My point is, don't delude yourself. Don't set the bar too high. In fact,
don't even put the bar up. Dreaming is okay in the world of sleep, but in
your waking hours you must face the facts. And thefact is: only I can have
Topenga.

REVIEW
Essential Dirda comes to life in 'Readings'
BOOK
BY CATHERINE OSBORNE
For years, I've waited eagerly for the third
Sunday of the month. That's the day when
Michael Dirda's "Readings" column appears
on the back page of the Washington Post Book
World. Incredibly learned, without a scrap
of pretension, Dirda shifts effortlessly between wistful reminiscence, self-deprecating
humor and book recommendations. When he
won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993, Washington
book-lovers rubbed their hands together in
glee: now, finally, someone would publish a
collection of these columns in a format more
durable than newsprint.
It's taken seven years, but the Indiana
University Press has finally come through.
"Readings: Essays and Literary Entertainments" is a collection of the forty-six most
essential Dirda columns. Most of my favorites are here, ranging from a list of the 100
best comic novels in English to deeply moving tributes to his late father and beloved
teachers.
Dirda has either read or is about to read
everything in the English language. In fact,
he probably owns two copies of it, and stores
them in one of the cardboard boxes he describes as being stacked in his basement. Leading an impoverished childhood in a blue-collar town, he nonetheless developed "an inexplicable passion for books." Now well into
middle age, his thirstfor words has yet to be
slaked. He is clearly one of those people who
reads the backs of cereal boxes when nothing
else is available, and he will acquire and devour oldissues ofMad Magazine as readily as

a new edition of Joyce. Several ofhis columns
are essentially lists ofrecommendations, with twenty
or so obscure minor masterpieces, held up to the light
ofday for perhaps thefirst time in decades, illustrated
with a well-chosen quotation and a few sentences of
commentary.

But Dirda has humility about his voluminous
reading. He devotes half a column to a minor obsession with the leavings of authors, "what one might
call supplementary materials," such as photographs, postcards and signatures. He mocks himself:
"Do not imagine that I regard my taste for such artifacts as anything but shameless and vulgar. I have
sunk so low as to covet Edward Gorey coffee mugs."
One of the best things about a "Readings" column is that it is not primarily a book review.
Rather, it is an account of Dirda's reading experience - all the preparation, setbacks, insights, pleasures. A true bibliophile, Dirda is apparently incapable of reading anything without consulting

fifteen other books in preparation. For instance,
planning to read "The Tale of Genji" he acquired
several translations, scholarly commentaries, etc.
But when, in a busy life, could he find the time?
"Years passed, and I was beginning to think that
I might wind up like one of the minor characters
in 'Genji,'" who died before his dream in life could
be fulfilled. He got lucky, though, when he was
awarded a month-long fellowship at Duke in 1996.
He worked during business hours and at night,
away from home and family, he immersed himself totally in the world of "Genji." The book itself served as an "intellectual base," but, being
Dirda, he couldn't help himself: soon he was reading Japanese diaries and poetry, memoirs of the
"Genji" translator, journal articles. "I even listened to early koto music," he says, and I can almost hear him shaking his head in wry wonder.
When Michael Dirda reads a book, he does it right.

bobbing his head like the guys in "A Night at the
Roxbury." Nor do we want to be the one self-proclaimed John Travolta flailing about like an ostrich
on hot coals or the girl dancing like she's in an

Herbal Essences commercial.
Don't stress out about it. If you are able to identify those people, then you are probably not one of
them. As long as you're not trying to get a club to
hire you as a cage dancer, you have to be able to do
little other than move your pelvis (and occasionally
your feet) back and forth to the driving, pulsing
rhythm that dominatesall dance music. Remember,
the music was made for the masses, and the masses
can't dance, so you'll do just fine. Just let the throbbing bass that's shaking the cups on the table do
the same thing to your hips. As long as you manage
to sway back and forth on counts "1" and "2" and
not flail your arms into someone's face, you're doing fine.
Summary: Pick out someone in the crowd whom

you don't want to look like and avoid doing the
things he/she does that make you cringe. Then once
you have mastered not embarrassing yourself, you
can work your way up to imitating people who have
all the right moves.

HIVING

Fall break just might be the most
amazing thing to happen to me since I
figured out how the Nintendo Gun
works. IfI'm right, the gun is no laser
but rather a sensor that picks up the
light rays from the TV; so if you point
the gun at the duck, which has a distinctly purple head, the gun reads the
purple signal, kind of takes a snapshot
of it and triggers the system just like
any old controller.
Anyway, I digress. In October, I had
a really nice break from Swat. Maybe
it's just me, but whenever I am on campus I find myself, whether jokingly or
not, talking about politics or policy or
some other serious thing. So fall break
was exactly what it should have been:
a real break.
While home, I went to see the opera
"Madame Butterfly" with an ex-girlfriend from high school. As the opera
unfolded, I began to make what I think
might be the most amazing musical connection in history. Granted, many of

you may have heard this before, and
some of you may have even figured it
out for yourselves, but I am yet to hear
it anywhere except in my own brain.
So I am going claim credit for the discovery. Here it is: the Weezer album
"Pinkerton" is modeled on the opera
"Madame Butterfly"!
Here's how:
L The album, as any Weezer fan
knows, is aboutRivers' (the lead singer

who, incidentally, attended Harvard) relationship with a half-Japanese girl,
who is living overseas. Similarly, the
opera (read: album) is about an American military officer's (read: Rivers') relationship with a Japanese girl (read:
half-Japanese girl), who is also living

overseas.
2. The Weezer album is entitled
"Pinkerton." The officer in the opera is

named Pinkerton.
3. The lyrics in the sixth song of the
album, "El Scorcho," explain how Rivers
falls in love with his half-Japanese girlfriend because she is "listening to Cio-Cio
San." In the opera, Pinkerton's (read: Riv-

ers') Japanese wife (read: Rivers' girlfriend) is Cho-Cho San. So Rivers sings
on the album thathe falls in love with his
girlfriend because she is listening to the
songs of the opera character who she herselfrepresents in his mind.
4. The last song in the opera is entitled
"Butterfly." In the song "Butterfly," Rivers sings to his girlfriend: "I told you I
would return / When the robin makes his
nest / But I ain't never coming back." In
the opera, Officer Pinkerton sings to ChoCho San that he will return "when the
robin makes his nest," though he never
does return. 'Nuff said.
There are more examples that underscore the similarity between "Pinkerton"
and "Madame Butterfly," but I think you
get the point. In the opera, when I heard
the line "when the robin makes his nest,"
I got the shivers. You all know what I'm
talking about
the intense, awesome
shivers. These were not the shivers your
friends gave you at summer camp while

sitting around the fire telling ghost sto-

ries. No, these were shivers more intense
than the tears I shed at the end of"Titanic"
(all four times I saw it in the theaters,
thank you very much).
For someone so obsessed with rock
music, this was an intense, almost religious
moment. Finally, I had found an interesting, engaging and non-pretentious example
of intellectualism in rockmusic today. Most

ofthe so-called "intellectual"references in

rock nowadays are either stupid or forced.
For example, remember the lyric "She's so
high above me, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc,
or Aphrodite"? Yeah. But just when I
thought nothing at all creative and learned
went on in rock anymore without being
shoved down the listener's ear canal, Riv-

ers proved me wrong.
In fact, he inspired me. I could be like
Rivers. He's in a rock band; I'm in a rock
band. He went to Harvard; I'm at
Swarthmore. He had a girlfriend once; I
had a girlfriend once I swear. He writes
about opera; I can write about opera. How
about my version of "Rigoletto" in whichI
like the hunchbacked jester who hires
a hitman to save his beautiful daughter
from the salacious desires of the Duke
try to protect my pure cousin from the
wealthy, skanky suburbanboy who propositions her nightly from the rolled down
windowofhis Jeep Grand Cherokee. Cool,
eh?
I'm starting to have doubts about my
chances. I'll admitit. What if there are tons
of other pretentious wannabe rock stars
out there who are also inspired by Rivers?
I wouldn't doubt it. After all, everybody
likes Weezer. I never knew why, but now I
do: Weezer represents the smart, nerdy
rock star inside all of us. Though I may
not have known about the significance of
the lyrics of"Pinkerton" before I attended
the opera, perhaps it was a subconscious
understanding of Weezer's refreshing allusions that made me like them so much.
Weezer has shown me that this complex
type of pop is exactly what I am looking
for, not some cheap pop fix
It's not just me, though; this rare intelligence in rock is what we all yearn for in
music, and it is why we all love Weezer. It
is why you are still reading this column:
you like everybody else in this schooland
on every college campus in America, like
Weezer for all the right reasons, whether
you realized it or not. (Unless you haven't
heard Weezer, in which case, feel free to
stop by Dana 307, and I will be sure to remedy that.) Just find me one person who
doesn't like Weezer and prove me wrong
by emailing me his name at mrubinL It
might be a nice thing to have in between
all those hate monkey letters I get every
night.

But life is not all destruction and what Joe calls "anarchistic activities." Ville teens have constructive outlets for their
nothing-to-do frustrations, as well. There has been discussion
of building a skate park in nearby Media, but the idea has
been thusfar turned down by "the civil powers that be." Some
of the youths I met are also in a punk band called "Global
Chaos," which is not yet in the gig-playing phase but undoubtedly will suffer from a lack of playable venues in the
Swarthmore area when it is. But mostly, they just do what
comes naturally to bored teenagers, which is not a whole lot.
When my interview with them comes to an end, it is about
7 p.m. on a Saturday, and they've been with me for around
half an hour. They've been trying tricks on their bikes, joking about other local kids, eating jerky and cheese sticks from
inside the Co-op and generally acting out the dictionary definition of "hanging out." Eventually, the less talkative two,
Joe and Mike, decide that they have somewhere to be. They
get on their bikes and ride away, leaving Johnand me alone.
John, looking for people, walks to Renato's and looks in, but
all he sees are college students inside the only local hangout
with reasonable evening hours. He walks to the train station,
on the border of the steel tracks that separate Swarthmore
the college from Swarthmore the borough. Kids often sit in-

side the station, but on this cold night, no one is there.
"Pretty much what you're seeing is what our average day
is like," he tells me. "The life of a no-life." After a little while,
he starts to walk home. I say goodbye and cross under the
tracks, heading back to campus, where there are myriad concerts, lame parties and good movies slated to keep me occupied well into the night.
We don't tend to think much about the Ville because, as
Mike, John and Joe have made clear to me, it's a pretty dull
place as far as youth culture goes. And we've got something
better right here, in our oft-discussed "Swat bubble," with an
a cappella concert every time we turn around, where work
awaits just when we think we have time to relax and contemplate the outside world.
But these kids don'thave anything better to do. They have
public school, which (at least in my memory) was far from a
24-7 stimulus, and then they have the Ville.
It's about at this point that I come to believe something
that I have long suspected: Had I grown up here, in the town
of Swarthmore, I would have been a "Ville Rat." You probably
would have, too. At the very least, this is something to remember the next time the McCabe skater kids block your path
to another five hours in the stacks. Sure, it's our campus, but
thesekids grew up here. They belong here, and not in the sense
that we say "I belong here." For us, this is a college education
and a fine experience, to be sure. But to them, it's something
bigger, if a bit less exciting. To them, Swarthmore is home.

was a time at Swarthmore when "survivors'

student interest and campus resources related to sexual
assault have diminished, leaving misleading campus crime
statistics as the major influence on students' beliefs about
sexual assault at Swarthmore. These statistics, published
annually in accordance with federal law, produce a false sense
of security among students who take them at their word and a
distrust of the institution among those who know better.

Crumbling support system endangers survivors
Although

Swarthmore has institutional structures responsible for
handling and preventing sexual assault, they tend to be insufficiently coordinated, poorly publicized and underused.
Both the student-led organizations focused
on sexual assault, Friends of Survivors
(FOS) and the Survivors support group,
have entirely disintegrated over the past
two years. Assistant Dean and GenderEduHenry,
cation
Karen
Advisor
Swarthmore's administrative resource for
sexual misconduct, is so low-profile that
two of the survivors interviewed for this
article were unaware of her existence.
In addition, a fall 1999 Women's Resource Center initiative to renew the student dialogue on sexual assault folded almost as soon as it began. The Sexual Misconduct Advisors and Resource Team
(SMART), a group of female faculty and
staff trained to direct survivors toward
campus resources and serve as crisis coun-

selors, attained a new level of invisibility
this year when the administration decided

against distributing its brochure to the
class of 2004.

Misleading Assault Statistics

Every

year on the last Thursday of
September, a compilation of campus
crime statistics for the past three
years appears in the Weekly News. This
set of numbers is tabulated annually by
Public Safety in accordance with the federal Clery Act, named after a first-year student at nearby Lehigh University who was
raped and murdered by another student in
her dormroom in 1986. Since the Clery Act
was passed in 1990, all institutions of
higher education in the United States have
been required to publicize campus crime
occurring in 18 designated categories, including everything from murder to burglary to sex offenses.
Under the Clery Act, sexual assault is
considered in two categories, forcible sex
offenses and non-forcible sex offenses, with
sub-headings for forcible rape/forcible sodomy, sexual assault with object, forcible

The Clery report
The Clery Act of 1990 requires that
schools publish an annual report
detailing all campus crimes known
to school officials except for
religious and psychological
counselors. The sexual assault
statistics from Swarthmore's last
Clery report are found below;
however, many believe the
reported statistics do not reflect
the reality of the situation.

fondling, incest and statutory rape. In addition to crimes reported to campus security authorities, schools must include crimes known
to all school officials with "significant responsibility for student and campus activities", except "professional, licensed mental health
counselors acting in that capacity and pasto-

ral counselors."
Swarthmore Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave explained how the Clery statistics are
compiled at Swarthmore. "We officially inquire
of about a dozen individuals, in the dean's office, but also in athletics, and some other places,
whether they have any incidents reported to
them," Redgrave said. In accordance with the
Clery Act, Psychological Services, the Office
of Religious Advisors and Worth Health Center are exempt from reporting.
In its

most recent

Clery

report,

Swarthmore reported five sex offenses occurring between 1997 and 1999, only one of which
fell under a Clery Act sub-heading, a 1999 forcible fondling. None of the reported incidents
was classified as a rape, defined as "the carnal knowledge of a person, forcibly and/or
against that person's will; or not forcibly or
against the person's will where the victim is
incapable of giving consent because ofhis/her
temporary or permanent mental or physical
capacity." According to informal statistics
gathered by Henry, most of these sexual assaults are perpetrated by Swarthmore stu-

dents and involve alcohol.
In contrast to the extremely low number
of sexualassaults reported nationally in Clery
reports, one frequently cited statistic states

that approximately one out of four women is
raped in college. According to national statistics from the Department of Justice, 10 percent to 30 percent of rapes are reported to law

enforcement authorities.
According to S. Daniel Carter of Security
On-Campus Inc., the organization founded by
the parents of the murdered Lehigh student,
the purpose of publishing crime statistics is "to
make students moreaware and afford them the
opportunity to make informed decisions about
precautions they may choose to take."
But many students believe that this goal
is not fulfilled when published statistics do
not fully reflect the reality on campus.
One senior called the low statistics "absolutely misleading" and said that almost everyone she talks to knows someone who has been
sexually assaulted. "I'm not sure why or how
these statistics get reported, but I think part
of the reason that there's no administrative
support system [for survivors] has to do with
maintaining that statistic for U.S. News and
World Report and the world at large," she said.
"I don't think that the administration is at all
malicious or uncaring. I just think that the
needs of students are getting lost in a bureau-

cratic tangle."
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie said,
"I'm sure there are more incidents than the
one or two that get reported each year."
Karen Henry, Assistant Dean and Gender
Education Advisor, also voiced doubts about
the accuracy, as well as the scope, ofthe Clery
statistics. "I think [the Clery statistics] are
kind of misleading, because a lot more things
happen than are actually reported," she said.
"And people need to know about things that
aren't on this list that are happening, like
sexual harassment and stalking."

duct. Of these,31 percent were cases of sexual
assault; 41 percent involved sexual harassment; and the remaining 28 percent consisted
ofother types of incidents or of students who
wanted to talk about experiences that did not
occur at Swarthmore. Among the sexual assault cases, 70 percent of the perpetrators were
otherSwarthmore students, and 60 percent involved alcohol.
Henry has no plans to publish her sexual
misconduct numbers as a supplement to the
Clery Act statistics. "I don'tknow that these
are necessarily useful tidbits of information,"
she said.
According to David Ramirez, Director of
Psychological Services, the prevalence of under-reporting of sexual assault in American
society reveals that there are reasons for this
phenomenon aside from Swarthmore's institutional failures. He explained the pervasiveness of under-reporting sexual assault as the
nature of a very personal trauma. "The dynamic of the trauma, as I understand it, is that
the person feels objectified," he said. "They're
stripped of their humanity and their personality and they're just this thing. People say,
'How is it a violation to report a number?' But
and your
it is, if you're one of the people
friends know you've been in counseling.
There's no such thing as an anonymous fact
here."
But many students interviewed felt that if
...

complying with the federal Clery Act results in the circulation of one set of incomplete "tidbits of information," the administration has a responsibility to counteract the resulting misconceptions however
possible. This might be accomplished by
publishing more relevant numbers for this
community in addition to the annual Clery
report, or ensuring that Swarthmore pro-

vides visible and viable resources for survivor support and community education.

Institutional Support Resources

The

low statistics for sexual assault
may be linked to the underuse and
poor publicity of resources for survi-

vors. Students interviewed felt that survivors should know that initiating a judiciary process or filing an official crime
report at Public Safety are not the only
ways for their experience to be counted in
Swarthmore's statistics. They said that
survivors should have as many options as
possible, and if the current options are not
being used sufficiently, this may indicate
not the rarity of sexual assault, but problems with existing resources.
Most students are introduced to
Swarthmore's sexual assault resources as
first-years, during the last two minutes of

their student-led ASAP workshop, which
Henry believes is "the best supplement" to the
misleading Clery statistics.
But ASAP is a three-hour experience that
easily gets lost amidst the barrage of orienta-

tion activities during a student's first two

weeks at Swarthmore, rather than an ongoing presence in student life.
Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol thinks ASAP
would be more effective if it were structured
more concretely and less intellectually. "It
would be helpful if [ASAP] were more about
what actually happens on campus
more on
assault outside of relationships, more on saying if you are assaulted, here's what you

should do," Howes-Mischel said. "Right now

it's so abstract."

Despite these perceived problems with
ASAP, the student body tends to be aware of

some campus resources for sexual assault.
WorthHealth Center is availablefor survivors
concernedabout the medical ramifications of
assault, and Public Safety for the minority
who decide to file crime reports. Psychological Services, a resource for those seeking longterm support, also has a fairly high profile on
campus.
By contrast, the most common student response to the question, "What does Karen
Henry do?" seems to be, "Who?" Although
Henry is introduced annually at orientation,
many students do not realize thather title "As-

sistant Dean and Gender Education Advisor"
means sexual assault counselor in
Swarthmore-speak. (Gender Education Advisor also refers to Henry's responsibilities as
an administrative resource for groups such
as the Women's Resource Center board.)
Goundie explained that when developing
Henry's position, fears arose that the administrator responsible for issues of sexual misconduct would be perceived as the figurehead
of a witch hunt against men. "We had to come
up with a kind ofneutral title. People might
still understand what she does, but I doubt
it," Goundie said.
Henry said her lack of name recognition
among students may partially result from the
time she spent last year doing her clinical internship, whichkept her off-campus during the
day. "I've thought about doing study breaks [to
increase visibility], but I'm too old to stay up

until ten o'clock drinking coffee and eating

cookies and then go back to the city," Henry
said. She said she welcomes other suggestions.
Henry is not the only sexual assault resource at Swarthmore that is not widely
known. The Sexual Misconduct Advisors and
Resource Team (SMART) members have experienced a similar fate. In 1995, Henry
trained this group of women faculty and staff
to serve as crisis counselors and make survivors aware of the other resources available
to themon campus. They are listed in the student handbook, and their brochure appeared
until this year in a folder distributed to first
years in their ASAP workshops. But the majority of SMART members have never been

consulted.

In addition to her ambiguous title, Henry's

location in the Dean's Office is unusual for a
non-judiciary, counseling sexual assault resource. Both Amherst and Williams Colleges
have a more clearly named Sexual Assault
Counselor who works out of their campus
health centers, which means that the physical and psychological needs of survivors are
handled at the same location.
Henry views her location in the dean's office with ambivalence. "I think there's some
disadvantage to being located in a dean's office," she said. "People assume that if you go
to a dean, you are initiating a disciplinary pro[The advantage is] it

Henry said she maintains close ties with
Worth Health Center and walks down to the
health center to visit with students whenever
the need arises.
But students have not always appreciated
these close ties between the dean's office and
other resources at Swarthmore. "It was a rule
[in the survivors support group] that you kept
away from the deans as long as possible, because if you weren't up for it, they would make
you think you had caused [the assault] yourself," one survivor said. Instead, she said the
tradition was to use student-facilitated support and consult certain counselors in Psychological Services.

Lack of Student Support Groups

The

2000-2001 student handbook informs
students that a survivors' support group
meets weekly and advises survivors

seeking information to look on the Friends of
Survivors (FOS) bulletin board outside the
Dean's Office. But neither the support group
nor the FOS bulletin board exists.
A former member of the survivors support
group, which was attended weekly by as many
as fifteen people, described it as a crucial
space for long term healing. "You did talk
about what happened, why you considered
yourself a survivor, but it wasn't as much
about that. It was more about getting your life

back."
She added, "Here [at SwarthmoreJ, a few
meetings at Psych Services, maybe some disciplinary action, maybe you take a semester
off, and you're supposed to be ready to go. But
the healing process takes years, the rest of
your life, and right now that acknowledgment
doesn't exist in this institution."
When asked why student support has diminished, Henry, who originally oversaw
both the support group and FOS, replied, "I
just don'tknow.... It really depends on the student body and what people need. There usually was a group of eager people who were
organizing it, and we haven't had that group
of people over the past year or two."
One former student facilitator of the support group explained why that eagerness is
difficult to sustain at Swarthmore. "There's
so much politicking involved in getting a
group on campus and sustaining that group,
and then finding a neutral space," she said.
"A student who is trying to deal with a very
personal trauma isn't in much of a position

to do that."
But this student and many other people

concerned about sexual assault at
Swarthmorefeel student support is essential.
"Students are very unsure of what happened
to them. They aren't ready to go to the deans
and give them a word for it," Howes-Mischel

said.

Aurora Camacho de Schmidt, Spanish professor and SMART member, said, "I suspect
victims rely more on other students than on
staff or faculty. If this is so, then we must be
concerned about how to help students help
each other."
Indeed, students hope that Swarthmore's
consciousness of sexual assault will be revived. One step in this process might be the
development of a team of sexual assault coun-

selors. At a school with sexual health and
queer peer counselors, many students interviewed were surprised that such a resource
does not yet exist.
"I think there are students who are never
going to come to administrators, and there are
also students who are never going to go to students, and ideally, I want both of those groups
to be served," Henry said. "I'm actually talking to a couple groups of people about maybe
getting trained to be crisis counselors, because
I find that the student resources are some-

times a little better used than the staff. There

has been a lot of interest."

Doubts about honor code expressed
BY GERRITT HALL

Students had a chance to weigh in on the proposed honor code during a fireside chat on Tuesday evening. The discussion was led by Jared
Solomon 'Ol and Horatiu Stefan 'Ol, who originally proposed the honor code to the Student
Council in late October.
"The central focus ofSwarthmore is academics," said Solomon. "Why wouldn't you find a
formal way of addressing academic integrity?"
Solomon and Stefan said an honor code would
not only promote academic honesty, but also
create a sense of community on campus and communicate the role of academics to incoming
classes.

Nationwide, about 30 colleges and universities have an honor code, according to the Bryn
Mawr Web site. Though both Bryn Mawr and
Haverford already have a form of the honor code,
the proposed honor code for Swarthmore would
not be as extensive.
"It's not a police state [under the new code],"
said Stefan. "You're not responsible for every
other person." The Swarthmore honor code,
unlike Haverford's, would not apply to social life,
only to academic life. Students wouldbe encouraged, but not obligated, to report offenses.
Implementation ofthe honor code requires a
two-thirds majority in a student referendum. If
the code were to pass, every student would be
bound by it. Admitted students would be required to sign a form of consent as well. Solomon
sees this as a benefit of the honor code.
"New students will look at the paper and say,
'OK, there's something aboutacademic integrity
that's important here,'" said Solomon. He hopes
that an honor code will help to communicate the
importance of academic honesty to all students.
Stefan and Solomon now face the hurdle of
convincing the student body. Upwards of forty
people attended the fireside chat, including Registrar Martin Warner and Dean of the College
Bob Gross.
After Stefan and Solomon gave their presentations, students had a chance to discuss their
opinions about the honor code withthe presenters. "Generally, the reaction was critical," said
Stefan.
"I don't understand how an honor code builds
trust," Dann Naseemullah 'O2 said. "You're codifying something that can't be codified."

Budget Committee considers
increase in activities fee

Student Budget Committee (SBC),
the organization in charge of allocating funds to the 95 student groups on
campus, is likely to recommend a StudentActivities Fee (SAF) increase for
next year to continue replenishing the

to give unproctored exams was imposing on the
faculty's right to teach. Students also said an honor

code would be ineffective and could break down
distinctions between Bryn Mawr, Haverford and
Swarthmore.
Despite an icy reception, Solomon did not see
the fireside chat as a setback to an honor code. He
said the turnout shows "people are interested in
the idea ofacademic honesty. If there's an interest,
hopefully it can be addressed in some capacity."
The chat did bring academic honesty to the forefront of campus discussion. With the evidence that
cheating is a bigger problem at Swarthmore than
before, students have begun to consider solutions.
In the past semester, six students have been
brought before the College Judiciary Committee
for plagiarism, an unusually high number.
A few students attributed the higher number of
cases to anti-plagiarism resources on the internet,
such as plagiarism.com. Dean Gross confirmed that
plagiarism.com had helped a professor detect plagiarism in one case.
"People say that the honor code can be the first
heightening students' aversion to
step towards
dishonesty. But I think they have it backwards,"
said Rajaa Shakir 'O4. "The school must start by
changing the culture and the attitudes of the students, not merely by changing the policies of the
institution."
But Solomon said the school needs a more formalized statement ofits position on academic dishonesty. "Right now, it's just a blurb on the syllabus: 'Plagiarism is wrong,'" he said.
For now, though, Solomon and Stefan will "reformulate their proposal" based on student comments. "I hope we get, if not an honor code, at least
a way to rethink academic integrity," saidSolomon.
...

capital replacement account. But the
committee may not recommend any
additionalfunding for student groups.
Nevertheless, a fairly significant
fee increase is expected to continue
the process of compensating for SBC
deficit spending over the past four or

five years. SBC Treasurer Marvin
Barron 'O2 said his "best guess" on the
fee increase wouldbe an additional$3O
to $4O next year. This year's SAF was
$250, and the year before, it was $226.
Last year, SBC finances had
reached a crisis state. The most pressing issue was the depletion of the
capital replacement fund, a savings
account used to cover large expenses
such as replacing vans and purchasing equipment. The fund was depleted at the end of last year.
SBC had realized early in the year
that to replenish the account, it
would have to recommend a very
large increase in the fee, on the order ofan additional $5O. The increase
was to be phased in over two years.
The increased SAF charged this
year is already replenishing the capital replacement account, whose balance now stands at $24,500. By 2003,
the goal is to have $125,000 in the account. That amount is necessary,
Barron said, because it has not been
unheard-of in the past to spend
$70,000 to $lOO,OOO from that account
in a single year. "The driving force

behind this," he said, "is the empirical observation that everything
breaks at once, and that everything
breaks every three to four years."
As SBC determines precisely how
much next year's SAF fee should be

raised, considerations beyond the
capital replacement account are being weighed. Additional increases in
the fee would enable SBC to allocate
more money for student groups next
year after the 19-percent cut in this
year's funding.

Barron said a five- to 10-percent
increase in group spending is a possibility. However, he added, "I can
hesitantly say the committee is not
interested in further additions."
Barron was reluctant to endorse
a large increase in the SAF fee in order to increase funds for groups. "We

are trying to maintain fiscal stability. One thing you can't do is jack the
fee up as high as you can," he said.
Barron said he was surprised at
the mildness of student reaction to
the cuts. He had expected many students to go up in arms over the cuts.
"As it turned out, we only received
about three mean e-mails, while we
received about 30 e-mails that were
very understanding, saying what we
did was fair," he said.
In anticipation of appeals that student groups might make this semester as well as to provide for new
groups that might be formed, SBC set
aside $27,000 in discretionary funds.
Barron said that only about $3,000 has
been distributed this semester,
mainly to new student groups.
SBC is seeking student input as it
nears a decision on next year's SAF.
The committee will hold a fireside
chat on Nov. 30 to discuss potential
SAF increases. Barron said he is especially hoping to hear from students
who are not involved in campus
groups, because those students would
end up paying an increased fee, but
they would not benefit.
SBC will meet to finalize its rec- *
ommendations for next year's SAF
amount on Dec. 4, then will present
its conclusions to Student Council the
following evening.

Tharoor sees strength in pluralistic Indian culture
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

ternational body serve similar functions in
that both bring together differing beliefs into

A large crowd packed into the Scheuer
Room in Kohlberg Tuesday night to listen
to Executive Assistant to the United Nations Secretary General and author Shashi

a unified group.

Tharoor lecture on identity and democracy
in India. Though his subject was serious,
his humor kept the audience wide-eyed and
attentive for the eighty-minute discussion
on the plurality of Indian culture.
Tharoor was born in London in 1956, but
spent the early parts ofhis life studying in
India before coming to the United States
to attain his Ph.D. at Tufts University. As
a diplomat, Tharoor has held several different positions in the United Nations since
1978. As an author, he has won various
awards and acknowledgements, including
the prestigious Commonwealth Writers'
Prize. His latest book, "India: From Midnight to the Millennium," on whichhis lecture was titledand based, is a study on the
first fifty years ofIndian independence.
From the beginning ofhis talk, Tharoor
made the distinction that he was speaking
as an Indian writer, not as a United Nations official. He said, however, thatIndian
culture and the United Nations as an in-

"The singular thing about India is that you
can only speak about it in the plural," Tharoor
said. He discussed in depth the varying factions in India that make it what he termed a
"nation without a majority."

According to Tharoor, India currently
boasts 18 nationally recognized languages, 17
other distinct languages and 22,000 dialects.
India has four major religions and "is home
to every faith of mankind with the possible
exception of Shintoism," Tharoor said.
Tharoor said that the struggles India faces
include conflicts between bread versus democracy, pluralism versus fundamentalism, centralism versus federalism, and globalization
versus self-reliance.

Tharoor went on to focus on religion, most
importantly how the secularization of religion
in India means religious pluralism rather
than religious absence.
He proposed that the cause of much of
India's paradoxical secularism, and ability as
a nation in general to be accepting, is that a
large percentage of Indians are Hindus. The
Hindu faith in general is free from restrictions
present in many Western faiths. Specifically,

Hinduism asserts that all religious beliefs are
equally valid.
Tharoor admitted that the twentieth-cen-

tury politics of deprivation have changed
some things, and not everyone agrees with his
views on the importance of diversity in India. Some factions want the Hindu majority
to claim power, and these groups have made
recent gains in government seats and street
politics. Tharoor added, however, that he felt
India's greatest strength is its pluralism, and
that the idea that only Hindus can be Indians
is contradictory to Indian nationality.
The response to the lecture was overwhelmingly positive and numerous students
praised Tharoor on his lecture.
Surphi Gupta 'O4, a first-generation Indian
who spends her summers in India, said, "Not
only did listening to Dr. Tharoor speak make
me proud of my Indian culture and heritage,
but I also think it inculcated a sense of awareness amongst non-Indians as to the diversity

and complexity of Indian life."
The lecture was sponsored by the William
J. Cooper Foundation, which funds proposals
to bring to Swarthmore speakers that will
enrich the student body.
Aisha Talib 'OL wrote the proposal to bring
Tharoor to Swarthmore, said in her introduc-

remarks, "It is important to me to introduce Swarthmore to the vast diversity
in India." According to Talib, part of the
reason Tharoor was chosen was that
Tharoor has a background and role in international affairs that allow him to view
India with both an internal and internaTory

tional eye.

■ SWIMMING

Swimmers
kick off
season
BY TED CHAN
In the swim team's first two meets
of the season, both the men and the
women split. Swarthmore easily
handled Ursinus, one of the
conference's weaker programs, but
then found themselves overmatched
against Franklin & Marshall.
Despite missing some key
swimmers who are abroad for the
semester, the women led Franklin &
Marshall going into the final event.
Unfortunately, the Diplomats were able
to pull out first- and third-place finishes
in the 400-meter relay to pull out a
narrow 106-99 victory. Among the
strongest performances were the 1-2
finish from Natalie Briones 'O3 (25.26)
and Leah Davis 'O4 (25.80) in the 50
free. Briones and Amy Auerbach 'O2
were each triple winners against F&M.
Auerbach captured the 200 free
(2:012) and the 200 fly (2:19.35). In
addition to the 50 free, Briones won
the 200 breast (2:33.74). Each was
part of a winning relay team.
Despite the loss, head coach Sue
Davis was pleased with the
performance of the team. Although the
team actually defeated the Diplomats
in the 1999-2000 season, "We swam
better on Saturday against Franklin and
Marshall than last year at this time,"
she said. "I couldn't have asked for
more from our team in their efforts to
compete against F&M with multiple
lifetime and season best times. F&M
was just faster and deeper than we
were."
The men, however, ran into a
problem that might recurring
throughout the season. The team has
strong individuals, but is limited in
numbers, which make it tough to win
the dual meets. Despite some strong
individual performances from the likes
of Mike Dudley 'O3 (2:04.99 in the 200meter back) and All-American Ted
Sherer 'Ol (2:18.98 in the 200-meter
breast) and the 400-meter freestyle
relay comprised of Dudley, Chris
Bussard 'O3, Jason Kerensky 'O3 and
Eric Shang 'O4, the team fell 125-78.
"Everyone on the team stepped up
, to that intensity and swam a fast
meet," said assistant coach Claire
Arbour 'OO. "With a bit more practice,
polish and racing, these close meets
will be ours for the winning."
On Saturday, The Garnet will swim
against Washington and Lee at the
Ware Pool next to the Field House. The
meet begins at 2 p.m.

English named conference Player of the Year

UP IN THE
SKYBOX

17 Garnet athletes receive recognition
BY TED CHAN

With a stellar performance by the football squad
in a victory over Washington & Lee, Swarthmore's
2000 fall season winds to a close as one of the most
successful in recent history. The conference recently honored a number of Garnet athletes with

All-Conference accolades.
Leading the way was field hockey star Kristen
English 'Ol, who was selected as the Centennial
Conference Player of the Year and a First Team
All-Star. English led the Garnet to a strong season
with stellar two-way play that included six goals
and three assists. Also selected to the first team
for the Garnet, who finished second in the conference and reached the quarterfinals of the Eastern
College Athletic Conference Mid-Atlantic Championships, was Katie Tarr 'O2. She had 12 defensive saves in addition to six goals and two assists.
"It caught me completely by surprise. I had no
idea I was a candidate. It was never a consideration of mine. It's an unbelievable honor," said
English, who is also one of the nation's top lacrosse
players. She will be shooting to make the U.S. National team in the spring. Whether she makes it or
not, the invitation is a testament to her dedication
to athletics.
The Garnet also had a number of first-team selections in football and cross country. Conference
champion Joko Agunloye 'Ol was an easy selection,
as was Mark Jeuland 'Ol
In football, star running back Ken Clark 'O3 and
his top blocker, offensive linemen Mat Rapoza 'O3,
were both named to the first team. Clark shattered
Garnet records in becoming the first Swarthmore
running back ever to go over the 1,000-yard mark
in a single season.

Tide down W&L to cap best season since 1995
BY JUSTIN KANE
Saturday the Garnet Tide returned to two of this season's themes
Ken Clark 'O3 and solid defense to shutdown Washington & Lee 16-6 and
post their first win over a team with a winning record since 1995.
Clark bore another heavy burden this week, grinding out 151 yards on
44 carries and scoring two short touchdowns. The first-team All-Centennial Conference back's effort was more than enough to cement his place in
the Swarthmore record books. Clark set school records for season carries
(263) and yards (1,053), making him the first Swarthmore running back to
break 1,000 yards and to lead the conference in rushing.
The defense, led by linebacker Kevin Perry 'o4's nine tackles, held the
powerful Washington and Lee running attack to 121 yards and four first
downs on the ground. With the exception of a first-quarter kickoff return for
a touchdown, the Tide defense kept the Generals in check.
"Except for that return, we played a near-perfect game," said head
coach Pete Alvanos. "To send the seniors out with that was huge. This is
the one that makes the off-season better."

Accolades galore
Lately, I've been following the progress of the crosscountry team through the various stages of Marc
Jeuland's hair. During the regular season, it was of average length, fine and blond. When the team showed up
for last weekend's NCAA Men's Mid-East Regional
Championships, it had turned a lovely shadeof garnet.
And now that Jeuland is heading off to Spokane, Wash.,
to theNCAA Division HI Cross Country Championships
this weekend, it has been cut very short length, with a
swirly pattern ofblond and garnet. I just hope it won't

completely disappear next week.
With Marc's changing hairstyles has come his most
recent success. He finished second at the Centennial
Conference (CC) championship meet, placing himself
on the first team, and with last Saturday's fourth-place
finish at Regionals, he has earned himself a trip to the
finals. This final year of Jeuland's collegiate cross country career has been studded with various accolades,

most notably the ones he has claimed within the past
two weeks. He'll face a field of Division Ill's best runners, and he has nothing to lose, except for a bit more

off the top.

Of course, Joko Agunloye will be heading to Spokane as well, mostly because she is one ofthe best runners in the history of the CC. She handily scooped up
the title Runner of the Year, with a course-record time
of 18:56.20, in the CC Championships on Oct. 3L This
was the second year in a row that Agunloye has earned
the honor, and the fourth straight year thatshe has made
first team. In fact, she hasn't finished below fourth in
any of her four CC championships. Agunloye is thefirst
runner in CC history to win first-team laurels four years
in a row, and only the second runner to win back-toback titles. With all of these spectacular local finishings,
it is no surprise that Agunloye finished third in the
NCAA Division EtSouth Atlantic Regionals. Damn, girl!
Fact: Kristen English is Queen of All Swarthmore
Realms. Her most recent acquisition to prove it is the
Centennial Conference Field HockeyPlayer ofthe Year
award. The multitude of newspaper articles about her
that have been popping up all week are fond of pointing
out that she was also a unanimous selection to the first
team, and that she's scored a large number of goals and
assisted on a multitude ofothers. On Tuesday she was

named to the NFHCA first team regional All-American.
I'm sure that within the next week or two, two or three
more awards will be given to her, affirming that she is,
in fact, the Queen.
If English is the Queen, thenKatie Tarr is Ms. Thang.
Tarr joins English on the CC first team, and made the
NFHCA second team regional All-American. Her most
impressive statistic is her 12 defensive saves, an indication of her life-long dream to be a goalie. But in addition, she helped theoffence at least times (six goals, two
assists).

On the football side of things, a total of nine
Swarthmore players earned CC honors. Both Ken Clark
and Mat Rapoza earned first-team offensive honors.
Clark, of course, is the first Swarthmore player to rush
for over 1,000 yards in one season. To be exact, Clark
finished with 1053 rushing yards.
Although both rugby and ultimate are 'fclub sports,"
they too have theirfair shareofend-of-season accomplishments. This past Sunday, four members of the women's
team tried out for the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union
AU-Star team. All four Nancy Craig, Emily Wilkins,
Elizabeth "Phil" Meehan, and Adrienne Fowler—made
the team, and will be playing various other all-star teams
down in Manassas, VA this weekend.
As usual, both the men's and women's ultimate
teams went on one of their crazy van excursions to
Wilmington, N.C. for the Fall Colliagates tournament
last weekend. This lovely event is the largest collegiate
tournament, and the Swat teams did very well, with
the men finishing fifth and the women sixth. Brandon
Silverman has some lovely footage ofthe weekend. He
also maintains that'bf all of the years we've had a men's
ultimate team, this year is the best shot we have of going to nationals in the spring." 'Nuff said, I'm sure.
Cheers!

majestic

The hippo gods
NO HOLDS

bow to me
With nearly flawless play, Vladimir Kramnik
took the title ofWorld Chess Champion away
from the legendary Garry Kasparov last week.
While Kasparov, Kramnik's former mentor,
played the two matches he lost like he was
lobotomized, the new champion played solid
fundamental chess. That's just what I read.
What the hell is this crap doing in the sports
section, you say? It's late in the semester and
I'm running out of crap to ramble about. Well,
that and I consider anything that requires
competitive discipline and focus a sport. Makes
topics more readily available. Kramnik may not
be an athlete, per se, but certainly he trains as
hard as any world class athlete. And I most
admire those who thrive in sports in which I
struggle to find success.
My curiosity in chess was piqued when I
heard Bobby Fischer's story. After winning the
world championship in 1972, he disappeared
from the scene when he joined the Worldwide
Church of God. This, urn, "church" advocated a
mixture of observance of the Jewish Sabbath
and dietary ritual and apocalyptic Christianity,
the Second Coming, the end of the world,
regenerative baptism and, probably above all
else, tithing. Fischer, the best American chess
player ever, is one of the most compelling
figures in chess. (Actually, I'm not sure if you
can still call him American, seeing as he's
banned from the country for spitting on
American documents and tearing them up on
television.) And the movie "Searching for Bobby
Fischer" made me want to be a chess badass.
And, hey, I was reasonably smart, had a lot of
free time and was good at Connect Four at the
time. I thought I ought to give this game a shot.
I am the worst chess player in the universe.
I am the Yinka Dare of chess. Like Yinka, I
cannot make two moves without falling flat on
my face. My Yahoo! chess profile could be
mistaken for Glass Joe's. My strategies are
more ill-conceived than Rae Carruth's, more
suicidal than Demetrius Underwood. I've never
once said "check mate" unless it was because
I'm finished with my beef at the Outback Steak
House.
So I admire Kramnik's handiwork and the
greatness of the opponent he outwitted. I can
admire the brilliance of his play. (Well, after the
fact, when I read some expert's analysis.) Until
then, I can admire the pretty pieces they played
with and think about how cool it is when dudes
get killed in Chessmaster 6000 and whether
knights in the medieval times were really only
allowed to move in an L-shape.
In any case, my eleven-year-old sister sent
me an e-mail saying my mom and dad picked
stuff off my Amazon Wish List for Christmas. I'm
psyched, because they're getting me a
Simpsons chess set and one of my all-time
favorites, Hungry Hungry Hippos (not to be
confused with me after weigh-ins at a wrestling
tournament).
Finally, I can hone my game in these two
important skills while at college and beat my
sister. Sadly, I can already school her in HHH.

Agunloye, Jeuland qualify for nationals
BY CATHERINE CLARK AND DONALD NGUYEN
Last weekend, the men's and women's cross country teams
traveled to Dickinson College to run in the all-important Mideast
Regional Race, which determines the team and individual qualifiersfor the National Championship race in Spokane, Wash. The
conditions for the race were less than optimal: 50 degrees with a
15 mile-per-hour wind that brought it down to about 40 degrees.
Both teams, however, battled successfully as they outran the field.
The men's race fielded 245 runners from39 teams. "Iraced smart,"
said Marc Jeuland'Ol as he finished fourth in a time of 26:12 which
earned him All-Region honors and qualified for the national championship race. This is Jeuland'sfirst trip in his career.
Sam Evans 'Ol followed up on his impressive race at the Centennial Conference championship finishing 19th with a time of 27:06,
earning him All-Region honors for the second consecutive year.
This race also marked his best finish at the regional meet. Finishing third for Swarthmore was Joe Makin 'O3 in 88th place with a
timeof 28:53. Senior co-captain Ambrose Dieringer ran a personal
best timeof 30:03 finishing 144th. Rounding out the top five for the
team was Akira Irie 'O3, finishing 175th with a time of30:45. Over-

all, the men's team shocked a few Centennial Conferencefoes as they
finished 15th out of 34 teams beating rivals Johns Hopkins and
Muhlenberg, who hadbeaten them two weeks earlier.
The women's race numbered 237 runners from 40 teams. Leading
the pack was co-captain JokoAgunloye 'OL who finished third with a
time of 18:34, earning her All-Region honorsand third straight berth
to the national championship. Freshman Maria Elena Young finished
22nd with a time of 19:42 making All-Region honors as well as FirstTeam All Freshman in the region. Co-captain Alissa Parmelee finished 40th, with a time of 20:19 in her final cross country race. Following closely behind her was junior Christen Lungren, who finished46th with a time of20:29. Rounding out the top five for the squad
was Kate Baker 'O4, finishing 103rd with a time of 21:14. The women's
outstanding effort earned the team a sixth place finish out of35 teams.
This Saturday, Jeuland and Agunloye will represent
Country Championships in Spokane. Agunloye willbe aiming to finish in the top
35 while Jeuland looks to surprise the competition. Whether they
achieve that or not, it has been a fine season and career for those
two. In addition, a number of younger runners have emerged as
the runners who will head to the indoor track.
