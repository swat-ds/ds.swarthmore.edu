Police accused of racially
motivated illegal entry
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO

Swarthmore borough police entered the off-campus
apartment of Nii Addy 'O2 and Prince Achime 'Ol to question the pair approximately an hour after three men assaulted Randy Keim 'O2 in his Mertz dorm room early
Sunday morning,
Achime and Addy said that the police had no warrant
and that the entry was without due cause. "Nobody gave
them permission [to enter]," said Achime.
Borough Police ChiefBrian Craig said the incident reports show no evidence to support the students' claims
that officers illegally entered the apartment. Officer William Thomas of the Swarthmore Borough Police Department also denied that the apartment was ever entered.
The students have made no official complaint against
the police department, although they have spoken to the
college administration.
Addy described the experience as surreal. "[The police officers] opened the door. Everyone was asleep," Addy
said. "They flashed a light into my face and said, 'Come
out here right now, Prince."
Addy said he saw a police officer standing in his room.
After Addy asked the officer to extinguish his flashlight,
Addy went into the hall. The police called him "Prince,"
the name of his roommate,
several times. After Addy
told the police his name
was not Prince, they asked

for the location of his
roommate.
Addy said he told the
police he did not know

Keim said he was confident that Achime had
nothing to do with the assault.
Public Safety officers arrived at Achime's apartment
building after the police did. "When they went inside... a
Public Safety officer observed... a Swarthmore police officer talking to an individual on the steps [in the corridor]," said Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave. He
said the police had requested Public Safety's assistance
in taking Achime to the Benjamin West House for ques-

fraternity.

tioning.
Achime said he agreed to be questioned at Ben West,
since the officers said that if he did not go, they would
obtain a warrant. Miranda rights were first mentioned at
Ben West, according to Achime.
According to Thomas, Achime "came to Ben West
House of his own accord."
The Swarthmore police returned to the apartment
around 12:30 a.m. on Monday to make the same accusations, Achime and Addy said
Keim had described one of his assailants as a black
male with glasses and cornrows, approximately 510" tall
and weighing about 230 pounds. The other, he said, was a.
black male, 61" tall, about 190 pounds, who was wearing a
bright orange fleece. The third assailant, Keim said, may
have been a black male, approximately 510" tall and of a
stocky build. Achime, although a black male, is 6'4"
and weighs 215 pounds,

point, Addy's other roommate, Ted Sherer 'Ol woke
up and came out of his

room to speak to the officers. Addy left and then went back to sleep.
In an interview Wednesday night, Thomas denied both

entering the apartment and speaking to Addy.
"Not a single officer crossed the threshold of that apartment," Thomas said. "We would not enter anybody's apartment without the search warrant," he added. "I didn'tviolate anybody's rights."
Thomas said he knows Addy's face but did not speak
with or see him at the apartment that night.
Thomas's partner, Officer Leonard Poggi, had more
detailed information regarding what happened at this
apartment, but was denied authorization to make any
statements. Thomas directed The Phoenix to speak to
Achime in order to obtain reliable information supporting Thomas' position.
According to Achime, the police woke him minutes
after speaking to Sherer and asked Achime to step into
•the hall. "They said they wanted me," Achime said. The
officers then questioned him.
"They told me to confess to an assault charge," he said.
"They told me they had me on the charge of a conspiracy
to commit an assault. They told me I would go to jail unless I 'fessed up about [my accomplices'] identities."
Achime denied participating in or having any knowledge

of the assault on Keim.
Thomas denied that any accusations had been made
against Achime at any time during the questioning.
"Prince Achime was talked to because he was mentioned
by the victim" Thomas said. "Prince was never accused
of the crime. Prince was very cooperative."
Keim said he had not named Achime as an attacker. "I
mentioned [Achime] as someone who might know who
the guys [who attacked me] were, because he brings a lot
of friends from Philly," saidKeim. He assumed that the
men attacking him did not come from the Swarthmore
campus, he said, and thought that Achime, a Delta Upsilon member, might know about off-campus visitors to the

tioned in that manner]

race," said Achime. "No
question on that one."
Addy agreed. "I think

way," he said.

In response, Craig said, "I know there were three individuals that were questioned due to the evidence leading
directly to them." He said the victim had not offered the
evidence himself, later adding, "I cannot say whether the
conduct [of the officers involved] was proper or improper."
In another interview, Craig said thereport "is not complete yet." He estimated that three or four weeks would
be necessary to complete the investigation. In its current
state, the report is an initial synopsis of events written by
officers Leonard Poggi and William Thomas.
After hearing a description of Addy and Achime's
claims, Stefan Presser, legal director of the Pennsylvania
Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said
"There may have been a violation of their [Achime's and
Addy's] Fourth Amendment Rights." He encouraged all
parties involved to contact a lawyer regarding possible

litigation.

Presser said there is a difference between racial profiling and having a description of a perpetrator as a member of a certain race. Craig also made the same distinction when he denied the "Cop Watch" flyer's allegation of
racial profiling.
In a related occurrence, several police officers showed
up at the Willets dorm room of a student who had called
for a cab through Ben West approximately 15 minutes after the assault in Mertz.
"More than one person in that room was looking for a
cab to Philadelphia," said Redgrave. The police had received the informationfrom a telephone operator. Corporal Stephano of the Public Safety arrived at Willets after
the police.
"When our officer arrived at Willets... the officers were
already inside the building. [The officers] were in the hall
with two individuals," Redgrave said.
According to Thomas, he went to Willets in response

CRIME

Student attacked in
weekend incidents
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
After officers arrived in response to a call about an argument
between a drunk woman and Randy Keim 'O2, the woman attacked
Keim in Worth Courtyard early Sunday morning. In an unrelated
later incident, three people assaulted Keim in his room, two of whom
he had argued with earlier that night at the Delta Upsilon house.
After the three men assaulted him, EMTs took Keim to Springfield Hospital, where he was treated for "multiple lacerations and
contusions to his forehead, ears and hands," Chief Brian Craig ofthe
Swarthmore Police Department said. Keim also received a concus-

sion.
Keim and a woman whCTwas later identified as Lindsay McLean
Stevenson, a first-year student at Bryn Mawr College, were having a
verbal argument immediately outside Worth L, when a student called
the Swarthmore Police Department and the Department of Public
Safety to report the argument. At 1:38 a.m., officers Len Poggi and
William Thomas of the Swarthmore police and Patrol Corporal Bob
Stephan and officer Kathy Augustinelli of public safety arrived at
the dorm and found the visibly drunk Stevenson. According to Craig,
she appeared quite upset and shouted obscenities at the officers.
"She was warned several times to refrain from these actions,"
Craig said.
Witnesses confirmed that Stevenson struck Keim on his face with
a closed fist and that he had tried to calm her without touching her.
Keim said that at one point, he stepped aside when Stevenson swung
at him, and she fell hard to the ground.
The police report statedthat officers took Stevenson outside when
she broke free and tried to punch and kick Keim, saying, "No man
hits me." Stevenson later told the police that Keim had not struck
her at any time during the evening.
"We were taking her to the Worth Health Center when she attacked him," said Thomas.
Stevenson has been charged with simple assault, resisting arrest,
underage drinking and "terroristic threats" for threatening to hurt
Keim during her arrest. She was released later that morning on a
$2,000 unsecured bail and declined to comment on this matter due to
legal issues.
Although the police report named Stevenson as Keim's girlfriend,
Keim said there had been no romantic connection between them,
although he did say the two had been acquainted before the incident.
Keim does not plan to press any criminal charges against
Stevenson. "Nothing that is going on with her has anything to do
with me," he said.
After Stevenson's arrest, Keim went to the Delta Upsilon fraternity house, where he related the story to other students. Police officers later came to DU searchingforStevenson's purse. Stevenson "said
she didn't know where her purse was and believed she left it at DU,"
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave said. Initially, fraternity
members refused to allow the officers inside, prompting them to request assistance from public safety.
After overhearing Keim describe the incident to Jared Passmore
'O4 and Donovan Goodley 'O2, a man sitting approximately six feet
from the trio told Kiem to "chill the fuck out," according to Passmore.
Keim described the person as an African-American male, approximately 510" and about 230 lbs., and wearing glasses and cornrows.
Keim said he thought the men were from Temple University.
Passmore said that the man's reaction seemed to have nothing to
do with the fight Keim was describing, but rather with Keim's excited state and the presence of the police.
"Whichever way they meant it, it came out very offensively,"

Passmore said.
"I told them to shut up, since I didn't want them to attract the
attention of the police entering the party," Keim said, "and since one
man yelled to me to shut up while I was talking to a friend privately."
He said that the man that yelled at him Might have been intoxicated
or under the influence of drugs.
"The conversation was not pleasant, but it did not seem like it
was going to lead to what it led to," Passmore said. "It was very short
I think they each said about two sentences apiece."
A witness who later spoke withKeim and Passmore said that when
the two began to leave later, the unidentified man rose, handed his
glasses to a friend and pursued them.

No blanket cuts
this year, says SBC
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
A proposed budget that would allot $360,614.68 to
student groups next year was approved by Student
Council Monday night. Sam Blair 'O2, council liaison
from Student Budget Committee (SBC), said the committee was happy with the way budgeting had gone.
SBC prepares the budget based on groups' requests.
"The good news was there was more money to give
out and less was requested this year than last," Blair
said. "There were no 19 percent or any percent cuts
this year." Last year, SBC made significant across-theboard cuts to groups' funding. The cuts were made in
order to set money aside to increase the capital replacement fund, which is used to pay for the replacement of
big-ticket items like vans. The fund had been almost
entirely depleted by the end oflast year. SBC is aiming
to add $40,000 to the account each year over the next
four years, a goal Blair said had been met this year.
Although SBC did not allocate any extra funds to
groups to make up for last year's cuts, Blair said that
when groups were making their proposals, some said
that in order to make up the difference, they were
requesting more than they would have had cuts not
been made last year.
Still, student groups requested over $392,000 for
next year, more than SBC could fund. As a result,
not all groups were funded at the full requested level.
Nearly 100 groups applied for funding, and ten of
these submitted proposals that accounted for 65 percent of all funds requested.
"Generally, the biggest groups took the biggest
cuts,' Blair said. SBC decided to give the section of
Drama Board devoted to large events $3,000 less than
they asked for, and the WSRNrequest was also pared
down by $3,000, money that would have gone toward
refurbishing the radio station's second studio.
The Halcyon was funded at full request; however,

its proposal for a budget of $37,819 is much lower than
in previous years, and represents significant changes
the yearbook staff is planning. Next year, the Halcyon will publish a shortened yearbook that will be
distributedfree to all students before the end of the
year. In the past, it was distributed only to seniors a
few months after graduation.
Two groups Forum for a Free Press (FFFP) and
Olde Club appealed SBC's decisions. After review,
SBC gave FFFP full funding and gave Olde Club an
additional$3,000, leaving them with $6,000 less than
they had asked for.
One smaller group, The Hybrid Electric Vehicle
Team, had its funding cut entirely "because of a technicality," Blair said. The team's main competition
occurs after the end of spring semester, and SBCrules
prevent it from funding events that take place during the summer. The team's treasurer, Kiyoyuki
Miyasaka 'O3, said that since "most of our funding is
obtained from donations," the team would be able to
survive. Given that the group has been funded by
SBC in the past, however, he said he "was very disappointed at the SBC's attitude this year."
Although the College Budget Committee approved
a raise in the Student Activities Fee (SAF), which is
used to fund student groups, the increase to $278 is
not as high as the $287 fee SBC had asked for. Blair
said the college was reluctant to increase the SAF so
much in one year because it is included in overall
tuition estimations. The college did agree to make up
the difference by transferring money from other college accounts to help fund student groups, Blair said.

For sophomores, adding a minor is no minor decision
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
As students begin to select courses for fall semester, many
current sophomores are making the additional decision of
whether to include a course minor in their plan of study.
Last May, the faculty decided to offer some course minors
outside the honors program, but were uncertain if the proposal would take effect for the class of 2003. A week ago, sophomores were informed that they may choose between the existing policy and the new one, which permits course minors in
many departments.
Most students were glad course minors are now an option,
but with sophomore papers outlining academic plans for the
next few years behind them, some members of the class of
2003 were more eager than others to rearrange their plans in
order to include a course minor.
Registrar Martin Warner advised sophomores in March to
plan their proposed course of study under the assumption that
course minors would not be offered to them.
Elcin Akcura 'O3 wishes she could have known before writ-

ing her sophomore paper that course minors would be an option. For now, Akcura intends to stick with a course of study
under the old plan.
"It's a good thing they gave us this option," said Krista
Marshall 'O3, who is thinking of adding a philosophy minor
under the new program. She said she still needs time to consider what to do, as she had made all her plans up until now
under the impression that course minors would not be an
option for her.
For Carolynn Laurenza 'O3, however, a choice between the
new and old program makes little difference in her plans.
Under the old system, she intended to major in psychology
with a concentration in environmental studies; now she plans
to have environmental studies as a minor.
Chris Bussard 'O3 said he is very pleased that minors will

offered to sophomores. He plans to be an English major and a
computer science minor underthe new program. "Previously,
I was generally throwing a fit because I didn't have enough
class space to do an honors major and minor," he said, explaining that adding a course minor will be more feasible for
him. Another benefit of the new system, he said, is that since
concentrations will become minors, "I won't have to explain
what a concentration means out in the real world."
Some students found the rules for the new policy confusing, however, and felt it would mean taking additional classes.
Ackura said the "overlap constraints" for minors particularly
discouraged her from looking into adding a minor.
Craig Williamson, the chair of the curriculum committee
and an English professor, said he anticipated confusion surrounding the overlap constraint, which is meant to encourage students to pursue depth in the discipline that is their
chosen minor. In her announcement early last week, Associate Dean for Academic Advising Joy Charlton said that four
of the credits taken for a course minor may not be counted
toward any other major or minor. This overlap is described
as a "pair-wise" constraint, as opposed to a "global-wise" constraint, because it means that the overlap rule must be met in
every possible pairing of majors and minors.
The overlap rule has several exceptions, however. If, for
example, the physics department requires a math course for
a major, then that math course would not be subject to the
overlap constraint in a math minor.
In addition, for an honors major who is a double major,
the overlap constraint does not apply because thesecond major
would always be in the same department as the minor in the
honors program.
On March 30, proposals were approved for minors in some
departments. Minors will not be offered in comparative literature, economics, sociology and anthropology, political science or studio art.

Protecting refugees
no easy task, UN
official explains
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
A United Nations official described the impact of
the organization's protection on the lives of refugees
in a talk entitled "Human Rights, Refugees, and the

Search for Protection" Monday.
Debbie Elizondo, the chief of the Refugee Resettlement Department at the office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
Geneva, Switzerland, defined a refugee as a person
who leaves his or her home country because of a wellfounded fear of persecution based on race, religion,
nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, and who cannot or does not want
to return home.
Last year, she said, approximately 22.3 million
people became refugees; many of these fled to wealthy
countries, like the United States, Australia and
Canada. Many who needed protection could not afford to make the trip to these countries and ended up
in refugee camps in developing countries.
Some such countries, like Kenya, cannot accommodate the number of refugees who plead for asylum each year. Elizondo illustrated this problem by
pointing to the situation of Kakuma, a refugee camp
located in Northern Kenya that is home to about
75,000 refugees from various neighboring countries.'
Refugees in such camps must often lookfor homes
in a third country willing to grant them asylum and
a chance at a new life. Elizondo's department works
to facilitate this process of searching for a permanent

home.

Perry Link, a professor at Princeton, co-edited a book that purports to provide inside government documents from the
period leading up to the student confrontation in June 1989.

Link describes decision to use
force in Tiananmen Square
troublemakers, explained Link, and declared martial law on

BY GABRIEL HETLAND

May 20,1989.

The image of student protesters confronting tanks and
troops in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in China is recognizable throughout the world. What is less well-known is how
the Chinese government came to its decision to use force
against students on June 4, 1989, after several months of a
tense but nonviolent standoff.
Perry Link, professor ofChinese at Princeton University,
spoke Monday about his recent
book, "The Tiananmen Papers:
The Chinese Leadership's Decision to Use Force Against Their
Own People: In Their Own
Words," which he co-edited with
Andrew Nathan, the director of
Columbia University's East
Asian Institute.
The book, which has generated a storm of controversy in
China and around the world,
consists of documents allegedly
from the Chinese government detailing what went on
amongst decision-makers during the tense days of confrontation with the students.
Before addressing the book's content, why he wrote it,
and what the controversy is all about, Link gave a brief history of what had happened in June of 1989. Link said the
roots of the incident go back to 1987, when Hu Yaobang was
expelled from the Chinese Communist Party for favoring
democratic reforms.
Hu died in April 1989, and students gathered in Tiananmen
Square to memorialize his life and reignite the reform movement he had come to represent.
The Chinese government denounced the students as

Sometime in the next several weeks, the government made
the decision to use force against them, and, on June 4, troops
violently confronted the assembled students in what many jour
nalists and eye-witnesses have described as a massacre, with
hundreds reportedly killed.
The Chinese government denied that anyone was killed in
the square.

"What does the book tell us
about these events?" Link askec
the audience. "Not much that is
new, but it gives us countless
small details."
The book came about when
Nathan was approached by an in
dividualfrom within the Chinese
government who wanted over
6,000 pages of documents pub
lished. Due to the possibility of
retribution from the government
Link and Nathan have main
tainedabsolute secrecy about their source's identity, using the
pseudonym "Zhang Liang" as the "compiler" of the informa
tion.
One thing the information does tell us, said Link, was that
the student movement of 1989 was truly nationwide. "There
were demonstrations in many other cities, which were in tune
with what was happening in Beijing," he said.
Another important idea the documents reveal, according
to Link, is how decisions at the top were made. Link said that
the government's "official story" about the events that the
students were being manipulated by "black hands" working

takes only a few months, many people spend years
within the chain-link fences of refugee camps. Conditions in these camps are often very difficult, and
refugees are forced to put their old lives and occupations on hold.
Elizondo explained that the largest problem that
the UNHCR faces in resettling refugees is that "asylum countries are becoming more restrictive." She
noted that countries like the Netherlands and Sweden, which have recently received large numbers of
illegal asylum-seekers, have subsequently refused to
receive refugees through the UNHCR's resettlement
process.
"For us, this is very bad," Elizondo said, "because
we lose places and resettlement positions." She added,
"We don't mind the numbers. We like the opportu-

nity [that] asylum countries give to both those who
arrive in the country and seek asylum and those who
need resettlement."
Visiting Swarthmore professor of peace and conflict studies Fernando Chang-Muy said that restrictive quotas do not always limit the number of entering refugees. "The more restrictive the quota is
the more people a country will have that try to come
illegally" as asylum-seekers, he said.
One hundred thirty-nine nations have signed either or both of the 1951 Convention on or the 1967
Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which
oblige countries not to return a refugee home if his
or her life is in imminent danger. Only 18 of these
countries allow asylum-seekers to enter through a
resettlement plan.
For refugees, said Elizondo, resettlement is not
the end of a journey, but rather the beginning of a
new set of challenges. Resettled refugees must adjust to life outside the camps which have been their
homes for months or years. Often, they must travel
thousands of miles to countries with cultures and
languages vastly different from their own. But resettlement offers them a chance they would not have
had in the camps at a life they may not have had at
home.

block him from the stairs," Passmore said.
At 3:17 a.m., a person knocked on Keim's door
while he was on the phone with a Residential Advisor from Worth who had been present during the

incident with Stevenson. After repeatedly asking
who was there, Keim told the people to come in.
Three males entered.
"Two of them I can identify as having been in
the basement [ofDU]," said Keim. One was the man
with whom Keim had spoken earlierthat night; the
other was that man's friend, who had been sitting
next to the first man during the earlier exchange.
Keim described the second man as an AfricanAmerican male, 61", weighing approximately 190
pounds and wearing a bright orange fleece.
While Keim had clearly seen a third man with
the two assailants at the party, he could not ascer-

tain if it was the same man who entered his room.
Keim told police that as to "the third one, I was not
positive about anything... I did not get a good look
at his face."

He did give the police a description of the third
man he had seen in the fraternity house: a black
male, approximately 5'10", with a stocky build. Keim
was certain the third assailant was no one with
whom he was acquainted.
The person who invited the three assailants to
campus had discouraged themfrom the attack, Keim
said.Keim declined to divulge the person's identity.

The assaults of the past weekend have accompanied a series of criminal activities this semester, in-

cluding the vandalisms, resistance of arrest, attempted
burglary, aggravated indecent assault and attempted
rape that took place at the end of February.
"There certainly has been a flurry of activities,
and if it continues we will have to review [our policies]," Redgrave said.

Panel seeks solutions
to war in Sierra Leone
BY HOFAN CHAU
A panel of experts on Sierra Leone convened
on Friday to discuss the war-torn nation in an
effort to expose more students to the dire situation there and to provide a forum for possible solutions. The program touched on such issues as
the diamond trade's role in aggravating the war
and the stream of educated citizens flowing out

of the country.
Overwhelmingly, students left the panel with
a new understanding of the intricacies of the situation in Sierra Leone. "I think what I most got
out of it was a sense that the war in Sierra Leone
is a complicated, fascinating, and important issue that the United States should pay more attention to," said Amanda Schneider 'O2.
The audience in the packed Scheuer room
seemed interested in learning more about the
topic. Schneider wished that the event could have
provided more general information so that people
with no background could follow the different and
complex opinions of the panelists.
"I was skeptical that a workshop could hold
an audience for three hours without a break. That
it did was a testimony to the energy of its organizers and the quality of exchange that occurred,"
said Swarthmore political science professor
Raymond Hopkins, who moderated the panel.
Panelists included Ambassador from Sierra
Leone John Leigh, lawyer and activist Isha Dsyfan
and political science professors William Reno
from Northwestern University and Jimmy
Kandeh from University of Richmond.
"This is not a civil war." Leißh said, "it's a war
for the capture and plunder of diamonds." He said
demand for diamonds in Europe and other west-

ern countries continues to fuel the rebels with

money for arms, and he urged people to examine
and push for the Clean Diamonds Act to be passed
in Congress, which will close many loopholes on

the trade of what he called "blood diamonds."
Leigh also described how the diamonds bring
in huge sums of money for relatively little effort,
resulting in a corrupt elite class. Unlike mining in
other developing countries, diamond mining in
Sierra Leone is not labor intensive. The abundance
ofunskilledlabor allows those in power to utterly
disregard the needs of their people. Kandeh described the elite class as "more interested in domination than legitimization... in consumption than
in production."
Kandeh agreed that diamonds were problematic, but he and Leigh were divided on the the
role of "recycled politicians." Because most educated Sierra Leoneans choose to remain out of the

country, the government has to be dependent on
the old, corrupt politicians to keep it functioning.
Swarthmore Economics professor Stephen

O'Connell calls this a "fundamental" disagreement. "They are basically disagreeing about
whether the current leadership can bring Sierra
Leone out of its difficulties
Kandeh says no;
Leigh understandably, as government spokesman,
says yes," he said.
The drain of intellectuals struck a chord in
Phuong Bui 'O4, who is from Vietnam. "In my
country it's the same ... people move out of the
country for education and never come back, and
we really need those people to help rebuild the
country," she said.
On a different note, Dsyfan addressed the need
to engender the peace process and her involvement to get a United Nations resolution passed so
that women's groups would be financially and
logistically supported to participate in the process.
The presentation also involved the showing of
the documentary clip "Cry Freetown," which pictured scenes ofuncensoredviolence. The clip opened
with a young boy shot in cold blood, and therewere
images of people with mutilated limbs in the aftermath of "Operation Spare No Living Thing."
"The documentary was intense for me to watch
I don't think I've ever seen footage like that in
documentary form," Chela Delgardo 'O3 said. "It
was stunning in the most horrible way. It affected
me much more than the speakers." The audience
joined her in stunned silence that was punctuated
only by gasps of horror.
...

Despite the grisly, violent reality of the war,
Mel Okudo 'O3 left "a little more optimistic" about
the situation after hearing the panelists. "At least
there is some progress towards something sustain-

able," he said.
Both Sierra Leoneans who helped organize the
panel, Harriette Williams 'O3 and Sade GilpinJackson 'O2, were happy with the event and
thought that it achieved what it was set out to do:

to a radio call from the operator unaware of the race or physical description
of anyone involved. Upon arriving to Willets, Thomas said he found Sanjay
Richards 'O3 and Courtney Roberts. "They were fully clothed. The door was
fully opened. I did not enter," Thomas said. "I saw two black males fitting the
general description." He said he then asked the students to come with him to
Mertz to allow the victim to look at them and tell Thomas whether or not
Richards and Roberts participated in the assault.
Richards was unavailable for a comment.
Craig denied any evidence of police officers entering dorm rooms or private apartments without receiving prior permission or obtaining a warrant.
Craig also denied that any evidence was found in the report to corroborate
the allegations made in the "Cop Watch Bulletin" that was prominently displayed around campus. This flyer, which imitates the style of Public Safety
Awareness Bulletins, describes Achime and Addy's claims as well as the officers' entry of room of the student who had called for a cab. The flyer describes the two incidents as "a blatant act of racial profiling."
"Nothing that has been written in ["Cop Watch Bulletin"] is consistent
with the report," said Craig. "I have not had a chance to talk to the officers

about what occurred."

Thomas said he wished the author of the bulletin found an alternate way
express his or her sentiments. "If they have a legitimate complaint, they
should sign it." The bulletin accused the police of violating students' constitutional rights and encouraged students to speak to the deans, public safety
and the police department and listed only the Public Safety's phone number.
No indication of the identity of the author was made.
Associate Dean for Student Life Tedd Goundieand Vice President for College and Community Relations Maurice Eldridge '6l are conducting an investigation in cooperation with the students making the allegations. They
are in the process of gathering facts and talking to the parties involved.
"We are looking into the whole matter and we are talking to the students
contacted," said Eldridge. He noted that, during his first few years in his 12
years with the college, there had been a pattern of events happening in the
spring that had been in some way racially tainted. In particular, he recollected such incidents as racist chalkings on the Magill Walk and student art
exhibit in the Parrish Fifth dome featuring works ofracist nature. "The pattern has not [yet] included the police," he added.

Eldridge said the college will not take official action until the investigation is complete.

With criminal issues
on the rise, we must
re-examine policies
When the Department of Public Safety posted its
übiquitous "awareness bulletins" Sunday morning in
response to the early morning assaults, the zealousness
with which the police were pursuing the assailants of
victim Randy Keim 'O2 seemed unquestionably good.
But when students posted the "cop watch" flyers
next to the awareness bulletins, that same zealousness had suddenly turned ugly. Although what
happened according to the Swarthmore police was
still unclear at the time of the opinions pages deadline, the accounts of the students whose apartment in
the Barn was entered point to the same kind of
racially informed tactics that have led to lawsuits at
other police departments.
These students claim police entered their apartment
without a warrant or permission shortly after the

assault, woke them up and threatened them with
criminal charges unless they divulged information
related to the Sunday morning assault. The students
said they were not connected in any way to the assaults
and that the police singled them out due to their race.
Was this a case of racial profiling, the police practice
of using minor violations committedby people who "fit
the profile" ofcriminals to investigate them for more
serious crimes? At this point, without any mention of
the incident in the police reports pertaining to the
assaults, it's unclear what the officers' intentions were
in entering the apartment. But allegations of racial
profiling don't seem to fit the description of the incident.
What seems to have happened is racially biased
abuse of police power, a far more serious allegation.
It's one thing to have some vaguely legal pretense to
enter a private residence; it's a far different story
when police not only enter a residence without

cause or a warrant, but also intimidate a
citizen with threats of criminal charges.
If this is indeed what happened, there are serious
problems in the Swarthmore police department. As
mentioned above, the police reports that have been
filed to this point made no mention of the incident.
Police chief Brian Craig has said he has not been
informed of this incident.
Perhaps in the flurry of police activity sparked by the
crime wave that occurred earlier this semester, solving
crimes has taken precedence over legal and proper
police investigations in officers' minds. This incident
should be a powerful reminder that a respect for due
process should always be foremost in investigations.
Calls for increased police watchfulness earlier in the
semester were not calls for the police to take whatever
means they saw necessary to solve crimes. The calls
were requests for the police to take greater preventive
measures in order to ensure that these types of police
investigations would not be needed in the first place.
With criminal activity becoming a more pressing
issue at the college, perhaps a reexamination of police
and public safety procedures is in order. Especially at a
college like Swarthmore, where the demographics of the
college do not match the demographics of the surrounding community, sensitivity to issues like these is a must.
Police responsiveness is something Swarthmore
needs. But the police zealousness of the type alleged
this weekend has no place at the college.

Campaign's efforts to implement living wage continue
Dear Editor:
At the Board of Managers meeting on Feb. 24, next year's
compensation package for staff and faculty was approved.
All staff who are "performing at expected levels" will receive
a 4 percent increase, which reflects the college's standard
measure of approximately inflation plus L 5 percent. For the
first time in many years, however, all employees who have
worked at the college for five years or more, and who are not
currently paid at full market value, will be raised to that
level (the full market value calculates an average wage for a
particular type of job, using local and regional data). We applaud the work of Human Resources Director Melanie Young
and her department in this important effort.
For several years now, raising all staff to fullmarket value
has been the objective of grassroots organizing and advocacy on campus, including the efforts ofthe Ad Hoc Committee on Staff Experience and the Student Labor Action Group.
That the college will now implement what has long been a
stated goal is a clear step forward. However, raising staff to
full market value is not enough: even at full market value,
not all Swarthmore employees can meet their basic needs.
Along with the announcement of next year's budget, Human Resources has announced the formation of a Compensation Review Committee which will re-evaluate the college's

Spoiled brats
What the hell is going on around here?
There was a time when I boasted about
Swarthmore's safety to friends, family, specs. Now I'm
getting used to waking up topublic safety e-mails about
violence and vandalism. I'm not a fan of this particular
deviation from the norm. I'm even less a fan of the possibility that the norm may be changing.
I don't pretend to know details relating to any of
the destructive events this semester. My sense,
though, is that more than a few of them are in some
way related to students' loss of self-control
the result of rage, alcohol or other instigating factors. When
I view the recent rise in crime from that perspective, I'm a little less surprised, and a little more angry. Let's face it: we are a bunch of spoiled brats.
I'm not talking about an excess of wealth. I'm talking about a dearth of responsibility. Too many of us
seem far too comfortable letting other people clean
both literally and figuraup the messes we make
tively. We want what we want, when we want it
and if what we want has an adverse effect on someone else, well, too bad. We don't have time to deal
with the aftermath. We've got papers to write.
Let's talk, firstly, about theliteral messes. People, if
you threw it up, clean it up. So you went too far with
your weekend fun and didn't feel so well. In the morning, you've got no excuse to avoid heading back to the
scene of the crime with a mop. Think about it: if you
had done the deed on your living room floor at home,
would you skip out of the house the next day, leaving
your parents to deal with the situation? Why is it any
more acceptable to leave it for your RA or, worse,
the environmental services staff? People have jobs to
do, and your inability to hold your liquor does not give
you the right to make those jobs any more unpleasant.
The food fights in Sharpies are, in a way, even more
obnoxious, because there's no intoxication defense. If
you've got the burning need to hurl a few french fries
at your friend at the next table, at least go over and
pick up the wasted food before you leave. There is just
no reason to leave it on the floor so that someone else
can scrape it up at the end of the day. That kind of behavior was annoying when we were 10. Now that we're
over 18, it's just plain offensive. The Magic Clean-Up
Fairy does not come to whisk away yourrefuse; doesn't
it bother you at all that a few seconds of fun for you
mean a few minutes of not-so-fun for someone else?
Socially conscious, my ass.
A similar self-centered attitude and the refusal to
accept that this attitude may have adverse conseis, unfortunately, perpetuated by
quences for others
some of the members of the rapidly growing
Swarthmore-related Mind the Light organization. Stories abound of parents with pressing questions being
steamrolled by outspoken, belligerent MTL members
during the recent Parents' Weekend; Student Council

has recently drafted a letter to MTL objecting to the
group's rumored plans to "make its presence known"
at graduation. This kind of inconsiderate, tantrum-like

behavior is driving away some ofthose who might otherwise support some of MTL's objectives; although I,
like many others, am outraged by the Board of Managers' decision-making process, I am certainly not willing to associate with anyone who would dare presume
to detract from the culmination of my undergraduate
career. MTL has a point to make, and one that might be
well taken; the offensive behavior of some of its members, however, and their apparent willingness to make
those points at the expense ofothers not implicated in
their accusations, is causing a rapid decline in the number of people willing to listen.
Swat students and, in some cases, alumni and
parents need to start taking responsibility for their
own actions. What is so objectionable about the offenses I've discussed is that they are so avoidable. If
you make a mess, pick it up; if you want something,
don't push bystanders out of the way in order to get
it. We should have learned those lessons long before
now. We're just too old for this.

Outrage about race too low

The events of this past weekend are harrowing to the mind,

cell in the McCabe basement where you're
churning out what I'm sure will be a stellar thesis, many of us are hiding from one
essential, and certainly unpleasant, truth:

the only thing new about this new millennium is that no one knows what in the
hell to call it.
Sadly, the fact that it is the year 2001

graduation) does little to detach this institution from its very recent (and very
present) history concerning the mistreatment of and institutionalized disregard

Just three years ago, a friend (who is

excuse me, cat-called "niggers" and "koons"
while walking that summer from the Black Cultural Center
to our apartment in the ville. This being the second time we
had been assaulted in four days, we decided to alert public
safety. After a week of several unreturned phone calls, we
were notified that our request to be escorted from the BCC to
our apartment had been denied on the grounds that Swarthmore is safe, and that since campus security resources are
"not in full force" over the summer, we should take it upon
ourselves to return home before it got dark out. I guess you
can just call me "Toby."
So let's be clear about this. In December, "Molly B." can
get an escort because it's raining and she doesn't want to get
wet, but if it's summer and I'm genuinely concerned for my
safety, it's "sorry, can't help you"?

The world is always happening
around us. And whether we like it or
not, our actions (or lack thereof)
carry consequences that extend far
beyond our four years at Swarthmore. Saying that you stand for or
against something means nothing if

you're unwilling to leave the comfort
of your seat. Crying at the injustice
of the world is not enough.

I've been a student here for four

years. And in those four years I've
been a Lang Scholar, Student Council representative, co-director of the Social Affairs Committee, an RA and black. That means that I've had ville police sit
outside my summer apartment in unmarked cars. It means
I've had professors tell me to not speak in class because white
students felt uncomfortable defending claims about what they
perceive to be the "black, African-American, Negro, colored,
slave, and/or urban experience." It means I've had my own
personal and creative expressions demeaned as "unscholarly
and elementary" or lauded as wild and fascinatingly exotic,
all in the same breath. I've seen black men harassed like
marked cattle (because they always know where we are), and
still have to wake up every morning and rediscover thatwhile
in a landof "great minds" and "free thinkers," I am surrounded
by an apathy and an ignorance that is suffocating.
You should be outraged. But I'm sure you aren't.

Athletics cut questions remain, keep Swarthmore from healing
Dear Editor:
With respect to the athletics decision, the deeper you dig,
the more cancerous the process. A few of the questions these

perplexed alumni have been pondering:
Who is accountable for the sudden 'emergency' that necessitated such a drastic decision that has greatly diminished
the reputation of the college? Is there no strategic planning
on issues ofrecruitment not even a basic understanding of
when in the year it actually occurs?
How many times in the past has the Board of Managers made
a major decision after a 90-minute "verbal" presentation?
When did the college PR machinery develop the 'spin' cycle
in place of integrity? Is this not a crisis of corporate governance
and effective leadership? Can members of the community have
any confidence that their interests will be represented?
Two board members and at least a dozen class agents have
resigned. Why are a large number of credible and long-time supporters ofthis community so disgusted with this administration?
Why have alumni, who have a vested interest in the reputation of the college, had their voices been muffled and their representation limited with respect to the direction of the college?
Has the time come for the community to consider the danger of a system of governance in which the administration
controls virtually all of the appointments to the board?
How is it the prerogative of the president to withhold the
names of the new board members prior to the emergency January meeting on the basis of confidentiality? Why has this administration engaged in the unsavory practice of lobbying
for the board's support instead of following the traditional
method of providing facts (through a written briefing book,
for example) and allowing the process of review, reflection,
and consensus to run its course?
How can we raise $2OO millionfor a capital fund and we can
buy out coaching contracts, but we cannot raise funds to hire
additional faculty to accommodate a few additional students?
You do not have to dig very deep to discover that this administration and board have engaged in the most heinous decision-making process in the history of this community. It is
premature to call for healing before we call for accountability.

Dear Editor:

Swarthmore hasbeenblessed with an extraordinarily talented
alumni group who retain an unusually strong commitment to
the college. The class of 1960 had a wonderful reunion weekend
last June and a contribution rate of over 75 percent, raising a
new record for total dollars contributed to the Alumni Fund. One
of the leaders of our reunion, and every class reunion we have
had over the last 40 years, was the alumnus that had theunfortunate exchange with the administration on March 3L This alumnus has also served on the Board of Managers and capital campaigns. You have to ask why is it that such an alumnus, with
over 40 years of committed service to the college, should have
gotten into a shouting match with Al Bloom and Jennie Keith.
For over 135 years the glue that has held this college community together has been the tradition of making important decisions only after full and open discussion where active listening and a sincere desire to understand and, if possible, accommodate everyone's views has been achieved. This tradition was
not upheld in the sports decision. The tradition has not been upheld in the months since the decision. The administration and
the board majority have failed in their leadership responsibilities. Their siege mentality has made a bad situation worse.
The Phoenix has had mixed success in covering this issue.
The reporting of specific events has been balanced, yet this issue
is truly remarkable in my 45 years as a member of this community. There has been no similar decision that has so fractured
our community. It begs for quality investigative reporting about
how the decision was truly made, what alternatives were considered, the aftermath, the negative reaction of many committed alumni and data supporting or refuting the Shulman and
Bowen's (authors of "The Game of Life") thesis?
I see little prospect for healing until the above questions
are addressed in an open and honest dialogue and the members of the College community are assured that the consensus-based decision process is reinstated for all issues that need
to be decided in this new century. The alumnus involved in
Saturday's unfortunate flare-up has written a letter of apology to Al Bloom. What will the administration's response be?

First lesson: how
to say 'I'm sorry'
It is somehow fitting that George W. Bush's first
international crisis is something most children overcome at the age of five.
Think about it. You throw your crayon at Timmy's
face, and Timmy refuses to give the crayon back. "Say
you're sorry!" he demands. "No!" you retort. "Say it!
Say it!"
This time it's a spy plane, not a crayon. Oh, and

Timmy is China.
On April 1, a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese fighter
jet somehow collided, killing a Chinese pilot and damaging the American plane so badly it is was forced to
make an emergency landing in China.
All Bush had to do, China insisted, was apologize
and they would return our 24 "detained" servicemen (and our stupid airplane too).
But the Bush administration didn't wantto apologize, and the crew was held in China for nearly two
weeks as the two countries argued. The United States
didn't do anything wrong, Bush said, and an apology
would admit guilt. Besides, if we apologized this time
we'dbe forced to say sorry every time we want something from another country. Apologies are expensive!
Hmm. Do apologies admit guilt? Analogy time: I
think that if a small child ran onto the BaltimorePike
right in front of my car and I could not possibly avoid
the messy situation sure to follow, I would still apologize (to the parents). And I probably would not worry
too much that I was setting a dangerous precedent.
If the parents had nuclear weapons, I would apologize profusely.
But we Americans don't behave that way in the
world of international politics. Colin Powell was willing to "regret the loss oflife" that occurred. But apologize? No way, Jose. No way, Jiang.
Didn't Bush get it? There are all sorts of really
fun ways to apologize without really meaning it!
As this column reported two years ago, Jerry
Falwell apologized for using poor judgment and tact

when he said that the Antichrist was Jewish, but he
added: "I apologize not for what I believe." And Nuon
Chea, Pol Pot's right hand man during Cambodia's
million-death genocide, apologized this way: "Actually, we are very sorry not only for the lives of the
people of Cambodia, but even for the lives of all animals that suffered because of the war."
Bill Clinton, furthermore, is a master at this sort of
thing. Sure, it is something of a dubious honor to be
really good at apologizing, but I bet he would have called
the president of China right away. "You see, Jiang, it

all depends on what the definitionof 'sorry' is."
Well, you're not going to believe it, but that's
pretty much what went on behind the scenes as China
and the United States hammered out an agreement
this week. Clinton, of course, was not involved. But
American diplomats and their translators spent days
drafting a letter which would fall just short of being
fully sorry in English but, when translated into Chinese, would just barely count as an apology!
No word on the details of translation yet, bet
here's a guess. According to The New York Times,
the United States has already used the word "yihan,"
which carries intonations of regret and "internal
remorse" but is entirely unacceptable as a form of
apology. China wanted "dao qien," the formal Chinese term of apology. Apparently, though, we'd never
get away with writing "regret" in the English version of the letter and translating it as "dao qien" in
Chinese the two terms are not equivalent.
What might have done the trick, though, is if we
used the term "bao qien," which Chinese dictionaries
interpret as either "apology" or "regret." From "dao
qien" to "bao qien," this is one hell of a face-saving "b."
We can call it Dictionary Diplomacy.
On an episode of Star Trek, Captain Picard once
had to greet some planet in an alien language such
that one verbal goof-up wouldruin the entire diplomatic mission. I just hope George W. Bush doesn't
have to apologize on live TV.

McCabe paper use wasteful
Dear Editor:
In the peaceful computer
lab on the fourth floor of
McCabe, there is an environmental crisis going on. In this

quaint little study center, hun-

dreds of sheets of paper are
wasted unnecessarily every

day, because people print
loads of documents without

ever claiming them. Some of
the documentsare just ridiculous, like 100-page journal articles and 50 copies of club
signs that were mistakenly
printed horizontally rather
than vertically. Because of the
lack of responsibility, hun-

dreds of white paper casualties lie on the table and eventually make their way into the
blue recycle bin. They disappear quietly, unnoticed and
without proper burial.
It seems to me that because the printouts are free,
people do not have the consciousness to think before
they press the "print" button.
The "One Copy Please" policy is also ineffective, because it is
easy to ignore and there is no enforcement of the policy since
Beardsley stopped having printer managers. Another reason
for such a waste of paper and disrespect for materials is the
new e-reserve system. Instead of professors handing out one
copy of the assigned reading or posting them in class binders,
students have access to the readings in .pdfform, meaning they
can print a copy whenever they leave their reading at home.
Although the e-reserves were intended for on-line reading, it
seems that students are too lazy to read the documents on the
screen, so they print the articles out whenever they feel like it.
Instead of one copy being made per class in the reserve-binder

system, multiple copies are being made per student.That means
the e-reserve system is encouraging the use of 30 times the
amount of paper that it used to! Something must be done!
We shouldn't charge for printouts, but we shouldenforce some
kind of policy that would make students feel more guilty about
printing 40-page articles from the internet that they never intend to claim. Perhaps thestudent's name should appear on docu-

ments so that they can bear some responsibility when piles and
piles ofpaper are wasted on theirbehalf. Whatever the solution
may be to this environmental crisis, the first step is to make it
known how much paper this college wastes every day.

Information key to avoiding, surviving rape
Dear Editor:
As the events of this year have shown

all too plainly, there is nothing that
Swarthmore is "too safe" for. We have
had armed robbery; we have had an attempted stranger rape. We can no longer
afford to turn a blind eye to anything and
say, "It could never happen here."
Rape and sexual assault are more
common than anyone here thinks, and
most sexual assaults are perpetrated by
an acquaintance of the survivor. Sound
horrible? It is, without a doubt. But in
the eyes ofthe law, there is an even worse
crime drug-facilitated sexual assault,
a felony in the first degree punishable
by up to 20 years in prison. And if you
think it can't happen here, think again.

Alcohol is the most common substance

used to facilitate sexualassaults. But there
are many other drugs that are commonly
used by assault perpetrators. Most people
have heard of Rohypnol, commonly
known as "roofies," a colorless, odorless
substance that dissolves quickly in liquid.
It can knock out a victim in less than half
an hour, and leave that person unconscious and vulnerable for up to eight
hours. A similar drug, GHB, acts even
more quickly within 15 minutes of ingestion and lasts up to six hours. Both
drugs not only prevent victims from resisting sexual assault, but can cause later
amnesia so that victims are not sure if
anything even happened to them at all.
This can lead to delays in treatment,
which can be incredibly dangerous for a
woman who wants to prevent a pregnancy, since emergency contraceptives
decrease in effectiveness as time passes

after unprotected sexual intercourse. Also,
many STDs are asymptomatic in women
but can still do considerable damage to
health if not diagnosed and treated quickly.
If you have been assaulted, or fear that
you may have been a victim of drug-facili-

tatedsexual assault, theabsolutefirst thing

you must do is ensure your own physical
safety. Get to a safe place—your own room,

a friend's room, or Worth Health Center,
which is staffed 24 hours a day. Call someone you know, ora trained member of the
SMART team, to support you, because you
will have several choices to make. You
should be examined as soon as possible after the attack. You can choose to stay in
Worth Health Center, wherethe nurses can
examine you for internal damage in a regular gynecological examination. They can
check for STDs and give you the morningafter pill, and it will all be free of charge.
If you decide to go to the hospital, you
will be taken to Crozer in Chester, which
is the Delaware County facility to handle
all sexual assaults. There are special facilities available to assault victims, like private waiting rooms and counselors from
groups such as Women Organized Against
Rape. Hospitals are legally obligated to call
the police if you identify yourself as an assault victim, and cannot discharge you
until you have talked to the police. If you
want to consider taking legal action against
your attacker, Crozer is the onlyplace that
will collect forensic evidence.
This is particularly pertinent in cases
of drug-facilitated assault, since the victim
often can't remember anything. The hospital has a special "rape kit" which contains the evidence
usually the victim's

undergarments, vaginal, cervical, anal
and oral swabs and blood tests. The hospital will do baseline HIV and pregnancy
tests, and later on will do follow-up tests
so you can legally prove that ifyou become
pregnant or HIV-positive, it is a result of
the assault. They will also screen you for
other STDs, take samples ofpubic hairand
offerantibiotics and the morning-after pill.
Most importantly, if you are afraid you've
been a victim of drug-facilitated assault,
tell the nurses. Both Rohypnol and GHB
can be detected in urine tests for a brief
window after the assault takes place.
If you are a victim, there are many
processes that you can go through at the
college if and only if you choose to do so.
You can bring formal charges against the
perpetrator before the Judiciary Committee, or you can work informally withdean
Karen Henry to confront the perpetrator.
It is the prerogative of the survivor to decide what action will be taken.
Survivors can talk with Karen Henry,

a SMART team member and/or Psycho-

logical Services about their experience.

Sexualassault is highly traumatic. If you
or someone you know is a survivor, it is
vital to recognize that it is not your fault.
Still, there are certain precautions that
you can take against victimization by
drug-facilitated sexual assault:
1 Do not accept open drinks from others.
2. Watch your own drink at all times.
3. Be aware of what's happening around
you, and who you are with.
4. Pay attention to your body! If you feel
on the verge of passing out after only one
drink, tell someone you trust immediately.

Tattoo
you!

F’hotoscourtesyJoeySpaaola

Columnist Joey Spadola shares his tattoo arts festival experience
Whenever I think of good-natured, wholesomefolks coming together to enjoy themselves in a spirit of camaraderie,
merriment and good cheer, thefirst thing that comes to mind
and I think this applies to most people
is a national
tattoo convention. Nothing in the world ties a person more
closely to his friendsand loved ones than having their names
scrawled indelibly upon various conspicuous body parts.
Two weekends ago, as most of you undoubtedly marked
on your calendar, the Ramada Inn hosted Philadelphia
Eddie's National Festival of Tattoo' Arts, which I had the
good fortune to attend. The festival is an annual event
where hundreds of people from all over the nation come to
accomplish two noble and praiseworthy goals: (1) to cover
as much of their skin with ink as possible, and (2) to fill at
least one floor of the Ramada with the greatest density of
second-hand cigar smoke physically attainable.
Tattoo conventions have a long and impressive history
in Philadelphia, dating back many generations. The Constitutional convention, in fact, started out as a tattoo convention. A jolly group of patriotic gentlemen from each of
the original thirteen states gathered together to have the
exact geographical images of their respective home states
emblazoned in green ink on their chests. (In attendance
was, of course, Ben Franklin, who, besides being a statesman, an inventor, a scientist, an author, an education reformer, a gourmet chef, a long-distance runner, an able
rock-climber, a fabled pianist and a mean billiards player,
is said to have been quite the tattoo artist as well.) According to traditional lore, there arose a great dispute during
the tattooing festivities: the men from the smaller, states
felt that their larger-state compatriots were using up an
unfair portion of the ink. Luckily, however, they came to
some kind of compromise.

Before setting out for Eddie's Festival ofTattoo Arts, I tried
to convince as many of my friends as possible to join me, explaining to them that attending this event would be a profitable experience in many ways. To illustrate just how much
they could gain, I explained that I would never have known
that "tattoo" had three t's if it weren't for this convention, even
citing a pamphlet on tattoos written by one Sergeant Bob, who
stated that "tattoo recognition and interpretation is a valuable tool when dealing with state prison parolees."
Eventually, they could hardly contain their enthusiasm.
They begged and pleaded to be permitted to go; they even offered me cash up front to secure their place among the lucky
few. But despite all this, I ended up going by myself, because
every single person who was supposed to accompany me cancelled at the last minute owing to alleged observance of the
Taoist holiday Ta Chiu.
Upon arriving at the convention, I was a little apprehensive.
Although I had amply prepared myself with an impressive fake
tattoo ofChristinaAguilera, carefully placed on my right shoulder, there was some doubt as to whether I wouldfit in with the
crowd. I was not assured upon entrance, either. Within my immediate view were, by a conservative estimate, two-thirds of
all the persons I have ever seen on the show "Cops." Someone
with a less tasteful sense ofhumor might have been induced to
ask the shuttle driver if he'd accidentally made a wrong turn
and gone to the Pennsylvania State Penitentiary.
But, as it turned out, these prejudicial notions were completely unfounded. In fact, I've never seen a more genial bunch,
a bunch with more progressive ideals, than the folks at the
tattoo convention. For instance, at these conventions there is
never any discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic background
mostly because it is difficult to make racial or ethnic distinctions when just about every cubit of your skin is

covered with ink. You could be a Jack Russell Terrier under there and no one wouldknow.
As I insinuated above, one conspicuous fact about the
tattoo crowd is that they are particularly fond of cigars. At
first it didn't bother me, and I even joined in the cancerinducing bonanza, buying myself a fine specimen of a cigar priced at SLSO. By the end of the day, however, my

Hair: a unifying trait, a universal terror
BY MORGHAN HOLT
I cut my hair last semester. It wasn't a big thing: just
enough to revamp the unkempt scraggliness I had on my
head. Colored it, too, but, again, it was no big thing.
Still, it reminded me of all the times I have drastically
changed my hair and my reaction to my new 'do each time.
When I first seriously chopped my hair or dyed it some outlandish color, I couldn't pry myself from the mirror, unable
to believe the reflection was my own. I looked so different,
and I couldn't decide if I liked the new style or not. It was
just different, weird, not me.
It's funny, the way we begin to identify with our hair,
whether we're conscious of it or not, especially if we're not
prone to frequent image alterations. We get into ruts, get
used to our 'dos and have trouble accepting even the most
minor changes because they just look weird. And it's a big
thing, hair, whether people realize it or not.
A lot of people laughed in my face when I asked them
about their hair in my attempt to understand our strange
connection to our locks. They couldn'tbelieve I was serious.
After all, it is just hair, they said, and it's not very significant. Some chicks are blessed with blonde hair, others are
naturally curly, still others are enviably straight; some guys
have good hair, others can't find a thing to do with it. But,
when it comes down to it, it is just hair and everyone has it.
End of story.
The fact that we all have it, however, does not negate its
importance. Hair's a big deal for the very reason that everyone has it. Somehow, we find stylistic ways to distinguish
ourselves from others. And it's also a fashion statement, a
formidable focus of the fashion industry: sometimes dye's
in, sometimes it's out
sometimes short's in, sometimes
long. Hairstyling is an ever-changing industry and, somewhere in the middle of the mess, we've got to find something
that works for us, that suits our personal tastes and that
won't cause us to cringe before the mirror as we deal with

these same women admitted their days are quickly dampened by a misbehaving mane. Obviously something's happening between these ladies and their hair for it to so intensely affect their lives.
Granted, some of my respondents, both male and female,
confessed to caring a great deal about the condition of their
hair. My infamously blonde roommate, for example, describes her hair as an "extension" of herself, in that it alters
her appearance and, therefore, the way people perceive her.
Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 agrees with her on this point, asserting
that "hair styling holds plenty of significant value in terms
of how people perceive you and how you perceive yourself,
since it is a major factor in one's physical appearance."
It would be tough to deny the importance of hair if we
took into account how we use it to identify others: "the
blonde chick," "the dude with the dreds," "you know, that
guy with the chronically uncombed hair," "the girl with
the 'fro," and so on. People consistently use striking physical attributes to refer to others, and whether we recognize
it or not, hair is a significant attribute and has a definite
effect on how others perceive us.
Which is why I found it funny that some people tried to
convince me that they honestly didn't notice their hair or
thatof others, let alone feel some sort ofconnection to it. A
number of people tried to tell me that they'd rather not
have hair so they wouldn't have to deal with it. But they
don't shave their heads, so something's working in their
hair's favor. Maybe it's simply the previously mentioned
hesitance towards change, or maybe their apathy keeps
them from bothering to shave their heads, but I think it's
deeper than that; I think people, perhaps subconsciously,
are in tune with their hair, and most people, though not

all, would have a problem losing it.
Girls said they liked their hair because they could
change it regularly or because they could put it up and
forget about it, but it's not so easily forgotten, really. We're
confronted with our hair every time we look in the mirror, every time we, hopefully, wash it, and every time we
look at pictures ofourselves. Whether we want to admit it
or not, our hair, or lack thereof, is an inexorable part of
our physical appearance and, again, whether we like it or
not, it's going to impact others.
And that can be a good thing. Who doesn't want to be
noticed? Who wants to have boring-blah hair? Admittedly,
I like mine to be as low-maintenance as possible. And I
have to say that I have, on more than one occasion, been
accused of hiding under my hat... but I still recognize the
importance of my hair and its implications about my personality and my style, bland though they may be.
While they differed in individual taste, the guys I interviewed mostly agreed that chicks' hair is better longer,
shinier and, yes, blonder.. .but there're plenty of guys who
date girls with short, dark, drab hair, so ... how much does
it matter? And, although girls, for the most part, said they
wanted clean-cut guys (with no back hair), there are
women who find long-locked men overwhelmingly desirable, so ... how much does it matter?
Perhaps it doesn't, really. In the greater scheme of
things, there's much more to a person than his or her hair,
but that doesn't deny its significance, and it doesn't mean
we shouldn't all strive to obtain the highest degree of individual stylistic superiority. After all, as Gabriel Tajeu
'O3 pointed out, hair is a reflection, if indirect, of "personality and [an] accentuation of personal identity."

...

our 'dos each morning.

In my quest to learn more about people's relationships
with the hair on their heads, I surveyed various students of
various hair types, lengths and colors, asking themhow their
hair affects their self-perception and their sense of style, as
well as how they react to others' hairstyles. The responses
were peculiarly polarized and really rather funny.
As a whole, guys and girls of all hair types hate bad hair

days. Having hair out of whack can destroy entire days.
People hate feeling unmanageable, and untamable tresses
almost surely set them off.
Many of my female respondents said that they could predict the nature of their days based on the degree to which
their hair was behaving that morning, which speaks for the
importance of hair in spite of the commonly held belief that
it's not a big deal. Even some of the women who most vehemently bemoaned bad-hair days tried to tell me that hair
isn't important enough to be considered a worthwhile conversation topic, let alone the subject of a whole article

A short guide to getting a haircut in the ville
So we're a little limited in terms of haircutting/style joints
in close and immediate proximity. In fact, there are only
three haircutting joints in the ville, but don't let that get
you down. The ville shops offer a variety of services to
meet your styling needs and suit your cutting pleasure:

The Swarthmore Hair Studio is open Wed. thru Sat. and
offers an abundance of services for the ladies. From
Marianne, the energetic stylist, who says she loves giving
facials because it gives her the power to improve women's
moods, to Betty, the hairstylist who'll chop her regular rate
in half to accommodate our limited student budgets, the
staff of this Aveda Concepts Salon are eager to serve the
Swarthmore community. "We make beautiful people,"
boasts their motto, and that applies to guys as much as
girls. Treat yourself to a facial, a waxing, a color treatment,
or a good ol' trim off the top. Call (610) 544-6620 for an
appointment, or, if you don't mind the wait, stop in without
•

one.

The Co-Ed Hair Salon, across the street from the Hair
Studio, offers a wide range of services and uses your
favorite professional styling products. Not limited to
Aveda, the stylists at the Co-Ed Hair Salon pour a little
Biolage, Matrix and Redkin into the mix. Like the ladies at
the Hair Studio, the Co-Ed staff offer a variety of services,
but without the reduced haircut price. And, as the name
clearly states, clients of all shapes, sizes and chromosome
types are gladly welcomed. Call (610) 328-5885 for an
•

appointment.

The GoldenScissors Barber Shop is owned by Fred
Allegra, who opens shop Tues. thru Sat. bright and early at 7
a.m. and closes the doors at 6 p.m. (3 p.m. on Sat.). The
sign says "unisex" and I've heard he's a hell of a sports fan,
not to mention reasonable with his rates. Still, I'm a little
wary of having my hair cut and styled by an elderly man.
Unless you're only looking for a half-inch trim, I'd encourage
the ladies to leave the barber pole and baseball chats for
the guys. For a haircut by Fred, call (610) 328-0851

Alum explores ramifications of artificial intelligence
BY DANIEL MARRIN
The idea ofhuman cloning, or ofmachines
that do human tasks or are as intelligent as
humans, both fascinates and frightens us, especially those of us whose knowledge of robotics comes from movies. We envision the
murderous HAL 9000 of "2001," the manipulative Matrix and the bloodthirsty Terminator,
sci-fl creations that create greater fear than
understanding ofrobotic intelligence.
For writer-performer Tom Sgorous 'B2, in-

vestigations ofartificial intelligence are missing a crucial avenue of inquiry. Thursday
he is will
night, Sgorous will fill that void

interview a robot and ask her opinion. He is

returning to Swat to perform his play, "Judy,"
a 50-minute conversation between Sgorous
and his "test subject," a robot named Judy.
The idea seemed so strange to me that I
needed an expert. Computer science professor Lisa Meeden was my best bet. Though his
specialty is theater, Sgorous went through
Meeden, who has taught computer science at
Swarthmore for the last seven years, to bring
his play to Swarthmore. She approved the
12

APRIL 12, 2001

proposal when she read a good review of his
work, and she is overflowing with opinions
about artificial intelligence from herresearch.
Meeden often meets with fear of the possibilities of artificial intelligence, but the issue
becomes more complicated when you ask what
intelligence means. Performing mathematical
algorithms or winning chess, the things we
constitute as intelligent, are easy for robots to
perform. Intuitive mental processes we takefor
granted, like perception and putting things in
context, are what robots find so difficult.
"The thing about robots is it's hard to
make them robust and adaptive like we are,"
Meeden told me. Dealing with new situations
is difficult, she said, for a machine that lacks
a context for a solution.
A robot could never react and think about
itself in the same way as a five-year-old child
would, because it lacks the context of the child.
She believes that it will take more than harddrive space and endless memory banks to build
such intelligence and ability to connect ideas.
With equal numbers of neurons for robots
and humans nowhere near, the philosophical issues of artificial intelligence take hold.

THE PHOENIX

For Meeden, these constitute three questions: "Can robots be conscious? If so, do
we want themto be? And what would it then
mean if we were to turn them off?"
It is these points that Sgorous aims to

address in "Judy." After graduating from
Swarthmore, he began a solo career as a
rope-walker and a silent clown. In his bio,
Sgorous writes that in 1990 he "decided that
our world was too peculiar to stay silent any
longer." He is known for idiosyncratic theatrical works that use bits of philosophy and
technology to investigate popular culture.
Meeden suspects that Sgorous pre-pro-

grammed answers into Judy to allow what
seems like a 50-minute-long spontaneous
conversation between them, a dialogue that
includes a musical performance by both of
them and some philosophical questions

about the life of a robot.
"Judy" is being co-sponsored by the com-

puter science and psychology departments,
which will participate in a panel discussion
afterwards, along with Sgorous, on the obstacles and ethics in artificial intelligence.
While the subject of robotic intelligence

The key to getting a tattoo: keep a diary 'Blow' drags out '70s clichés
From TATTOO, pg. 11
general attitude toward cigar smokers was that we
should gather them all up, throw them in a gigantic Ziploc™ bag, seal it tightly and, as they asphyxiate, gleefully look on, marching around the outside with banners bearing the surgeon general's
warning in large print.
Because I always wondered how, exactly, the tattooing process works, one of the first tasks I set for
myself at the convention was to do some investigation. I discovered, that the secrets of the trade are
guarded jealously. Nonetheless, I managed to extract
some insider informationfrom an extremely old tattoo artist in attendance named Jed. I'm not sure why
Jed decided to let me in on these facts, but I offer
these two hypotheses: (1) he was too old to care about
betraying his profession, or (2) he was actually just
talking to himself and didn't realize I was there. Either way, there is nothing particularly striking about
the tattooing method. Broadly speaking, it involves
four elements: (1) a tattoo gun, (2) a needle, (3) ink (as
Jed stresses, it cannot be from a ballpoint pen) and
(4) a trained tattoo artist who has the necessary qualification of either looking like an escaped convict or
having biceps the size of small inflatable rafts.
Because the ink is left permanently beneath the
first layer of the skin, some of you may wonder, as I
did, whether getting a tattoo is healthy. This worry,
I can assure you, is entirely unfounded. Jed has
compiled an abundance of documented scientific
evidence showing conclusively that tattoos are 100
percent harmless. As he put it, "Hell, I've had tattoos for 57 years, and nothing's wrong with me yet."

In view of this reassurance, I cannot deny that I
was tempted, amidst the general excitement ofthe festivities, to get a tattoo. Right now you are probably a

clean-cut, upstanding, levelheaded, mature individual
who would never dream of defiling your body, which
you believe to be a sacred temple. But let me tell you,
as soon as you hear the collective buzzing of one hundred relentlessly irritating tattoo machines and see
person after person grimace in pain as they are poked
with large, uninviting tattoo guns fixed with large and
uninviting needles, then, my friends, you will forget
all about your unimpeachable youth and you will momentarily remove the cigar from your mouth to proclaim, "Where the hell is the exit in this place?!"
Now that you are all anxious to get a tattoo, I have
one important piece of advice before you take the final, irrevocable step. You should write a detailed diary entry explaining exactly why you are getting one,
so that thirty years from now, when indelibly written
across your upper torso is the name of an obscure, nolonger-existent left-wing political party, you will realize how much good sense you once had. The entry
should go something like this:
Dear diary,
Today I am getting the words "my dearest Anna"
tattooed upon my bosom in large, uppercase,
underlined lettering in order to commemorate the
name of my beloved, whom I have now been dating
for a total of two and a half weeks.
That said, I whole-heartedly encourage you to get
a tattoo. If you can, try to get one representing something you truly care about, one you won't be ashamed
of many years down the road. And, preferably, one
you can wash off at the end of the afternoon.

BY ESTER BLOOM
Here's a bizarre pattern for you: I reviewed "Chocolat" with Carrie-Anne
Moss and Johnny Depp two weeks ago; then last week, I reviewed "Memento,"
with Carrie-Anne Moss; now it's "Blow," with Johnny Depp. "Memento" is by
far the most worthwhile of the bunch, and Carrie-Anne Moss proves herself to
be the most gifted actor. Her world-weary cynic in "Memento" is a notable
departure from her pious mother in "Chocolat." Johnny Depp, on the other
hand, looks like he sauntered off of one set and onto the other, simply adopting
a facial tic and dropping the Irish accent to morph from Roux to George Jung.
He also is equipped with a seemingly endless supply of white turtleneck
sweaters and tinted sunglasses. This is a movie about looks, after all, and most
of it takes place in the 19705. This is the decade he was meant to advertise: the
collar-bone length hair, the wide lapels, the androgynous shirts; they all complement him so well that it's a wonder he would ever wear anything else.
Sadly, both chronology and bad instinct on the part ofdirector Ted Demme
drag "Blow" into the 1980s. As it is supposed to be based on a true story, perhaps Demme cannot be fully blamed. Still, he should learn when to quit; perhaps he could have taken notes on "Boogie Nights." Movies that begin in the
1970s feed off the adrenaline, the craziness and the great non-gender-specific
wardrobes of the era; inevitably, when disco dies, the movies fall apart.
"Blow" is the supposedly true story of George Jung, a man whose 15 minutes come from the part he played in the U.S. marijuana and, later, cocaine
trade. Essentially Gump-like in his luck, which is unobstructed by his lack of
street-smarts, he orchestrates the transport of drugs from Mexico and Colombia to rich, spoiled Californians and East Coast college students. And he makes
fabulous amounts of money from it.
Help comes in the form of a flamingly-gay hairdresser, Derek Foreal (Paul
Reubens, a.k.a. Pee Wee), and George's childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee,
the fat dude from "Mallrats" who couldn't see the sailboat). Accompanied and
entertained by a cadre of beach-loving hedonistic stewardesses who look like
they slipped out of their mothers' wombs into string bikinis, they adhere to
,
the live-fast-die-young philosophy.
But then one of their number does die young; and simultaneously George's
luck runs out. His friends scatter and George finds himself in jail, betrayed by
someone he trusted. It is in jail, ironically, that George goes from having "a
degree in weed to a Master's in cocaine." His Colombian roommate, who becomes his partner, teaches him all he needs to know.
The movie tracks George's career and his marriage to Mirtha (Penelope
Cruz). The requisite quivering highs and devastating lows are, for a while,
brightly-colored and well-costumed enough to remain interesting. But then
"Blow" begins to repeat itself, and, when it tires of that, it repeats other movies. Dead-horse cliches are dragged out and beaten; heart-strings are tugged;

tears are jerked.
The problem is that Johnny Depp never makes a truly sympathetic character. There is no depth to him, no real heart beating beneath that übiquitous
white turtleneck. We know nothing about him except that he continues to fuck
himselfover and get fucked over, particularly by women. The only good woman
dies early—but you could extrapolate that if she'd lived, she would have fucked
him over, too. And he wouldn't have learned his lesson then, either.
My advice is to skip the movies where Johnny Depp dresses in vintage
clothes. Both Roux and George are pretty but shallow, like the movies that
showcase them; but whereas "Chocolat" at least maintains its fluffy tone, the
last third of "Blow" is inexcusably preachy and clunky and sours the whole
piece. Neither compares with "Memento." If you need a masculinity fix, "Memento" offers Guy Pearce, who, though less well-known, is more well-built.
Just like the movie.

Honors math major
wins Gold water
BY ELIZABETH HANSEN
Karen Lange 'O2, an honors major
in mathematics and statistics, has
received a Barry M. GoldwaterScholarship, which provides $7,500 a year
for undergraduate tuition expenses.
The scholarship is awarded to sophomores and juniors studying mathematics, science and engineering.
The application, Lange said, focused on research experience. Last
summer, Lange received an undergraduate grant from the National Science Foundation to research matrix
theory at the College of William and
Mary.
There, Lange worked on patterninterpolation problems, a class of research questions in linear algebra.
"These problems involve considering
how the arrangement of entries in a
matrix and the entries' characteristics determine properties of the matrix," she said.
"I was really drawn to my problem because the statement of the
problem is relatively very simple,"
she said. "[lt was] almost like a math
puzzle you would find at the end of a

'Tiananmen Papers' prompted
denials from Chinese government

'Scientific American,' but it still involved quite a bit ofreal mathematics."
Lange plans to stick with mathematics after her graduation. "I am pretty
certain that I want to go to graduate
school for math and get a Ph.D. in math,"
she said. Lange would like to become a
professor.

The GoldwaterFoundation describes
its award recipients as having "very impressive academic qualifications that
have garnered the attention of prestigious post-graduate fellowship pro-

grams, such as the Rhodes and Marshall
awards."
Lange said next year she will prob-

ably apply for a National Science Foundation fellowship to cover graduate
school expenses.
Irene Garcia, a biology major, re-

ceived an Goldwaterhonorable mention
this year.
Out of an applicant pool of U64 students, 302 scholars were selected this
year. Swarthmore nominates four candidates annually. Last year, Matt

Landreman 'O2, a physics major, and
Jordan Wales 'Ol, an engineering major, each received a Goldwater Scholarship.

From TIANANMEN, pg. 5
behind the scenes
was probably believed
by many decision-makers.
Link said the book's documents also reveal

how soldiers were trained to respond to the
students.

Troops were brought in from outside
Beijing so that soldiers would not know the
protestors. He said that soldiers also were
given the government's official story, and be-

lieved that black hands were at work, manipulating events behind the scenes.
Since the book's publication early this
year, the Chinese government has been at
work to fervently denounce its validity.
Link said that the government has called
the documents "inauthentic" and "fabricated," and has suggested that they are part
of an international plot against the socialist
system and the communist state. Link said
that he has come to believe that the documents
are authentic, after extensive meetings with
his source.
Link believes there has been so much controversy because the government has never

been able to fully put the events behind them.
He said that the book may force the Chinese
government to re-examine how it has portrayed the events of June 1989.

If the government chooses to reverse its
story, what is referred to as a "turn over" in
China, the implications could be major. Ac-

cording to Link, the source who compiled the
Tiananmen papers is hoping that their publication will jolt the upper leadership into some
action.
Link said that currently there are efforts
by many in China to rekindle the reform movement of the late 1980s, and that the book may
help this.
Political science professor Tyrene White,
who has studied China for years, said that in
recent years there has been a resurgence of
bottom-up organizing.
According to Link, these documents are
aimed primarily at influencing top leaders, but
there could be an impact on the grassroots
level as well. He hopes that the main effect of
the document on ordinary people in China will
be to "call into question the moral authority"

of the government and elite decision-makers.
Matthew Kutolowski '99, the English
department's writing intern, echoed this hope.
"My main interest is how it fits into a larger
pattern of questioning that's taking place in
China," said Kutowlowski. He has been an active participant in the Falun Gong movement
that the government has been working against
in recent years.

Track meets JHU

Rugby meets with mixed success
BY PAYAL SHAH AND JOANNE JACOBSON

Early on the morning of Saturday, April 7, rugby
women from all over the East Coast piled into vans
and made their way out to the prestigious West
Chester Tournament, just a half-hour away from
Swarthmore. Despite the rainy weather and freezing temperatures, 24 teams competed, including
two from Swarthmore, each of which played three
games over the course of the weekend.
The A-side began the weekend facing one of the

nation's highest-ranked teams, the University ofDelaware, in a fierce match thatremained tied until the
final minute of play. Delaware took command early,
scoring a try within minutes of the first half, but
Swarthmore held on strong. It was a game of frustration, as Swarthmore's backs approached Delaware's
try line again and again only to have thereferee make
questionable calls that broke their momentum. But
through fastrucks that fed the ball right to the backs,
Swarthmore was able to approach the try line one
final time before half was called. This time, outside
center Katie Harper 'O2 made a clean breakaway right
into Delaware's try zone, tying the score at 5-5.
Throughout the second half, the Quaker forwards kept the ball away from the Delaware pack
through tight scrums, where hooker Taina Guarda
'O2 repeatedly stole the ball away. Jumpers Maya
Peterson 'O2 and Dani Holt-Lyman 'O3 successfully
spoiled several Delaware lineouts. But a minute
before the half was called, Del was awarded a penalty kick that resulted in a final score of 8-5.
In their second game, A-side shut out Elon, 100. Scrumhalf Nancy Craig 'Ol scored the first try,
driving through Salisbury's forwards off a penalty.
The forwards were fast in the rucks and mauls,
ripping the ball out ofElon's hands. Harper scored
the other try of the game, running the ball down

the field in a collective effort by the backs.
On Sunday, April 8, in the second day of tournamentplay, the A-side faced Salisbury State. Swat won
the game in another shutout, 12-0. Flyhalf Cathy
Vaughan 'Ol stumped Salisbury by switching tactics
constantly, mixing up skips with kicks and weak side

plays. Emily Rhoades 'O4 played an outstanding game
as wing, scoring a try and consistently making tackles, then Craig scored on a quick penalty. Craig also
converted one try to bring Swarthmore's total to 12.
The B-side had a rough start on Saturday morning in a game against Slippery Rock College. Swat
held off the Rock inches away from the try line for
half of the first half. Though they put up a valiant
fight, the B-side was no match for the Rock's experienced A-side, and the match ended in a 50-0 defeat.
Later in the day, B-side lost again in yet another
uphill struggle against the College of New Jersey's
A-side. Jessica Lee 'O3 played a fast and mean out-

side center, ruthlessly tackling New Jersey's
backs. Payal Shah 'O3 played on a hurt ankle to
put up essential defense as wing. Fullback Karly
Ford 'O3 savedthe day several times by body-slamming breakaway New Jersey backs moments before they could score. Rookie Stephanie Tonnesen
'O3 won the ball when she was lifted for lineouts,
keeping the ball in Swat's possession. Hooker Erica
Anderson 'Ol gave the backs much-needed support
by joining the loop. Despite the combined efforts,
Swarthmore lost 26-0 to CNJ.
B-side's final match pitted the team against

Philadelphia's Drexel University. Due to several injuries taking out many of their starters, A-side players had to step in for the B-side Quakers to form a
full team. Julie George 'O2 was iron woman of the
game, playing in her fifth match of the weekend.
Although the game was tight, the combined strength
of A-side and B-side shut out Drexel 3-0. The backs
ran fast and flat, providing an impenetrable line of
defense. They also proved to be a fantastic offense,
keeping the ball on Drexel's side of the pitch for
most of the game. The Drexel women proved to be
strong opponents, and neither side was able to score
a try. However, in the final minutes of the second
half, Swarthmore was awarded a penalty. In a
breathtaking penalty kick, Craig sent the ball sailing through the uprights, earning Swarthmore the
three points to win the game.
Seniors play their last homethis weekend against
the combined team from Haverford and Bryn Mawr.

Lax falls to 'Fords
BY MIKE LLOYD

The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team (3-5) lost 12-5 to
Haverford (3-7) last Saturday, April 7. Despite the loss, cocaptain Blake Atkins 'O2 scored five goals, won 13 of 19
faceoffs, and picked up a game-high eight groundballs.
Aktins was named to the Centennial Conference Weekly
Honor Roll for his efforts against the Fords.
Yesterday, the Garnet faced Franklin and Marshall on
the muddy mess that was Clothier Field.
The Diplomats are currently ranked seventeenth in this
week's USILA/STX Division 111 poll. With nine different
F&M players scoring, the Garnet was outplayed 14-6 despite Mark Dingfield 'ol's three goals and one assist.
Swarthmore is now 3-6 overall and 0-3 in Centennial Conference play.
With just three CC games left to play, two of which are
against the nationally ranked squads from Washington
(15th) and Gettysburg (2nd). Next Saturday, April 14, the
team travels to Carlisle, Pa., to take on the Dickinson Red
Devils, in what may be a battle not to finish last in the
conference. Last year Swarthmore beat Dickinson 17-6.

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

Jessica Rickabaugh 'O2 won the high jump last Saturday against Johns
Hopkins. The women won the dual meet 78-42, but the men fell 90-43,
despite strong finishes by the throwers, who swept all of their events.

Baseball picks up second win

frisbee

Warmothers fall
to rival Bucknell
in tourney semis
BY LINDSAY GOLDSMITH
This past weekend, April 7 and 8, the Warmothers
traveled to Annapolis, Md. for the Chesapeake Invitational Tournament. In pool play on Saturday, the
women's frisbee team went 2-2, beating Yale 13-3 and
Maryland 13-1, while losing to Bucknell 13-7 and to
UVA 9-8, in an extremely tight game. The Warmothers
advanced on Sunday to the quarterfinals against
Salisbury and won 13-7 before losing in the semis to
Bucknell, 13-10.
The weekend was frustrating for the team in that
they lost to both Bucknell and UVA, teams they usually beat. However, the teams sees the losses as good
motivation to kick into high gear for the upcoming
sectionals and regionals. To qualify for the national
tournament, Swarthmore must finish well in both

tournaments.

Garnet bats come alive in shootouts vs. Western Md., Ursinus

Outstanding players over the weekend included
Sanya Carley 'O3, back from serious injury and surgical recovery only a few weeks ago, who played with
the steady reliability of a an older and experienced
player. Carolynn Laurenza 'O3 wowed everyone with
her amazing jumps and catches and definitely took
the unofficial Warmothers title for most goals scored.
Marah Gotscik 'O2, in only her second season of
Swarthmore frisbee, exceeded everyone's expectations with phenomenal defense (including an amazing d-block on Bucknell's top player) and some of the
most consistent, speedy and reliable cutting on offense that the captains had ever seen from a secondseason rookie.

specialty.

Catcher Josh Lindsey moves to catch the pitch of closer Carlton Davis, who shut out the GreenTerror over four innings in
relief of starter Drew Adams for the save Saturday. Swarthmore won 7-4 to take the second half of a doubleheader.

Going into last weekend, the entire Swarthmore baseball
team appeared to be stuck in a major offensive slump. With a
team batting average below the Mendoza line, the Garnet was
scoring just over two runs per game. To make matters worse,
perennial powerhouses Western Maryland and Ursinus were
next up on the schedule.
In the first game of Saturday, April 7's doubleheader versus Western Maryland, the Tide wasted another fine pitching
performance from James Zvokel 'O4, scoring only once in the
first inning and falling 6-L Whether it was the stale chicken
salad sandwiches or the warming weather, the Garnet returned from the intermission swinging hot bats. Led by senior co-captain Josh Lindsey's 3-for-3 performance, the Tide
crossed the plate a then-season-high seven times en route to
their 7-4 victory. Drew Adams 'O3 picked up his second win
and Carlton Davis 'O4 closed the door, shutting out Western
Maryland over the last four innings. Lindsay's .600 batting
average on the week and his four RBIs saw him named to the
Weekly Honor Roll.
The following day, Swarthmore traveled to Ursinus to face
the defending conference champions. The Bears had drubbed
the Garnet 24-1 in their first meeting, but a second blowout
was not in store. The Garnet was jumpstarted by Ryan
Pannorfi 'O4, Davis and Jacob Cortes 'O4 as they began a fiverun rally in the second inning. With the score 6-4 in favor of
the Garnet in the sixth, a controversial call changed the face
of the game. With the bases loaded, Ursinus' cleanup hitter
launched a deep fly ball that appeared to go foul down the left
field line. The home plate umpire, however, gave the signal
that the ball was fair and therefore a grand slam to give
Ursinus their first lead of the game. A passing comment about
"umpire evaluation forms" led to the ejection of head coach
Frank Agovino.
Despite these setbacks, Pannorfi and company started another rally, this time scoring three runs to reclaim the lead at
9-8. Ursinus scored four more runs in the bottom half of the
seventh. Also in the seventh, Lindsey was ejected for questioning the umpire's strike zone. The seemingly undeserved
ejection was followed by a less-than-quiet exit by Swarthmore's
backstop. Swarthmore loaded the bases in the eighth but was
unable to score and went down quietly in the ninth. The 12-9
loss was perhaps the best all-around effort of the season. The

On Tuesday, April 10, the Garnet traveled to Washington
College, looking to build off their impressive weekend. However, erratic pitching and costly errors led to an onslaught of
runs. A two-run homer by Scott Kushner 'O2 and three more
hits by Lindsey were not nearly enough to overcome the early
deficit as the team fell 18-7. Lindsey was swinging a red-hot
stick, going 11-for-17 over the lastfour games. The Garnet have
a chance at revenge when the team hosts Washington on Friday, April 13.

The Earthworms traveled to the Chesapeake Invitational in Annapolis, Md., hosted by the University of Maryland, last weekend. The men's frisbee
team went 2-3 on the weekend, losing two games by
just one point. As Matt Murphy 'Ol put it, the team
was "two points from being 4-L" He added, "There's
still room to grow. We [are looking] forward to spending the next couple of weeks learning how to win
those points" before sectionals.
On Saturday, April 7, the Earthworms went 1-3 in
pool play, while on Sunday, they went 1-1 losing a 1110 heartbreaker to the University of Delaware. The
weekend highlighted a 11-9 Earthworm victory over
the team's biggest rival, Princeton. The game could
be a preview of the regional semifinals or finals.

Men's tennis goes
2-0 on the weekend

Garnet softball drives one home,
splits with Dickinson Red Devils

BY MIKE NOREIKA

BY LINDSAY VANSCIVER

The men's tennis team continued its quest for NCAA
gold this past weekend, taking on two strong Division 111
teams. The Garnet played the pre-season llth-ranked team
in the nation, Trinity College (Ct), on Friday, April 6. Last
year's heartbreaking loss at Trinity fueled a Swarthmore

It's about time. For the first time this season, Swat
softball was able to put it all together to secure a 4-3 win
against Dickinson on Saturday, April 7.
The Lady Garnet lost the first game of the double
header with the Dickinson Red Devils 4-2, but this only
seemed to add fuel to the hot bats of the Garnet offense.
In the second game, Deirdre Downey 'Ol smashed a gamewinning RBI triple following a one-out rally in the bottom of the seventh to secure the win. Ironclad defense
and consistent pitching by Lindsay VanSciver 'O3 aided
the Tide in its victory by preventing the Devils from
making any headway at the plate. VanSciver was named
to the Centennial Conference Pitching Honor Roll this
week for her four-hitter and eight strikeouts in the second game of the twinbill. Heather Marandola 'Ol also
earned Weekly Honor Roll accolades with her .545 slugging percentage and two RBIs on the week.
The Garnet faced a grueling defeat after 12 innings of
play against Muhlenberg on Tuesday, April 10. Despite
numerous attempts at the plate to grasp a second win on
the season, Swat fell to the Mules 3-2. Swarthmore scored
first in the first inning, with Gretchen Heitz 'O4 hitting
Stephanie Wojtkowski 'O4 home. Once again, the Tide defense held the Mules scoreless until the seventh inning,
when Muhlenberg scored one to tie it up and send both
teams into what would become a mental battle in extra
innings. The game tensed as the rules shifted in the ninth,
with a batter on second at the start of each inning. The
game was locked at 1-1 until the tenth inning, when Pam
Lavallee 'O3 hit a sacrifice fly to drive Marandola home.
The Mules scored their final run in the top of the twelfth,
and Swat was unable to recover the lost run with their

desire for revenge. This year, Swarthmore turned the tables
on Trinity, pulling out a gut-wrenching 4-3 win. The following Sunday, April 8, the Garnet played flawless tennis
in defeating an overmatched Rochester team, 7-0.
Although Trinity is no longer in Swarthmore's region,
the match was crucial for national rankings because games
both in and out of the region are counted in the calculations. The Garnet men came out of the box swinging and
won the doubles point. Scott Grant 'Ol and Jayson Yost 'O3
wrapped up an 8-6 win at second doubles to make four wins
on the season for the duo. Justin Singer 'O3 and Frank
Visciano 'O4 ended a brief slump with a solid 8-6 win at
third doubles. With the doubles point in hand, the Garnet
entered the singles with the advantage, yet both teams knew
the match was far from over.
Two big wins came from the third and sixth singles positions, as Singer crushed Trinity's Csoba Gaduy, 6-1, 6-2 and
Grant pummeled Peter Green, 6-2, 6-L The win for Singer
was his third on the season at the No. 3 position. Grant has
been an integral part in every win for the Garnet this season with his consistent triumphs at the No. 6 spot.
With the team score notched at three, the match rested
on the shoulders ofthe Garnet'sNo. 4 man, Yost. The clearly
ailing Yost, who nearly decided not to play because of a
mild case of the flu, played the match of his life to secure
the victory for Swarthmore. After losing the first set 6-3 to
Trinity's Scott Levy, the Garnet hope dwindled watching
Yost struggle with both his opponent and illness on the
court. However, the relentless second-year veteran persisted in the second set, taking it 6-4. The third and deciding set went back and forth, with both teams doing their
best to urge their player to victory. After beingpoints away
from losing the match, Yost pulled even with Levy at 5-5.
With Levy serving at match point up 40-15 in the ensuing
game, his left quadricep cramped up, forcing the Trinity
man to question continuing the match. But the collegiate
tennis rules state that a player cannot take an injury
timeout for a cramp, leaving Yost the chance to take ad
vantage of his hurting opponent and get ahead 6-5. Although
Levy managed to come out of the cramp, Yost served out
the third set, winning 7-5 to clinch victory for the Garnet.
The second match of the weekend against Rochester was
much less eventful, due to the wave of Garnet confidence
coming out of the win over Trinity. The Tide swept the
doubles with wins from the duos of Pete Schilla 'Ol/John
Thomas 'O2, Visciano/Singer and Yost/Grant, at Nos. 1,2 and
3 doubles, respectively. The only scare in singles came at
the No. 1 position, where Schilla lost the first set to Colin
Ryan from Rochester. But Schilla used his supreme patience
to slowly battleback and take Ryan in three sets. The rest of
the Garnet singles players had no such trouble against the
weaker Rochester team. Schilla, Thomas, Singer, Yost,
Visciano and Grant all won their singles matches.
The win over Trinity will boost Swarthmore tremendously from a national standpoint, as Swarthmore was
"ranked 18th overall preseason and Trinity 11th. With the

bats. Because of the exceeding innings of play in the first
game, the second game of the double header was postponed
until a later date this season.
Now 1-15 on the season and 1-6 in the conference, the team
faces a grueling end-of-season schedule, with four double
headers against CC teams in the next two weeks. Next up for
the Garnet is a road trip to Gettysburg on Saturday, April
14. The Bullets are currently 15-4 overall and 7-1 in the CC.

most critical matches of the season over, Swarthmore's
chances for the post-season are extremely good. The final
regular-season challenge for the Garnet will be this Saturday, April 14, when then men will travel to Salisbury State,
the twelfth-ranked team in the South region. The match is

a must-win for Swarthmore, because a loss could disturb
any chance of a NCAA Division 111 tournament berth.

Men's rugby faces logistical challenges
Changes in coaching rules and loss of their playing field don't daunt ruggers' spirit, socializing
BYANNAMASILELA
Where will the men's rugby team be playing next year?
No one has yet been able to answer this question. DuPont
Field, the current location for practices and games, is due to
become a parking lot as construction on the new science
center begins. The two options that have been suggested are
a renovated lower Cunningham field or some part of the

fields located around the Lamb-Miller Fieldhouse.
Such an upheaval poses an special challenge for a club
team like men's rugby, which is 2-1 so far this season. Since
it does not have varsity status, officers of the team, rather
than the Athletic Department, are responsible for duties such
as finding space where the team can play, organizing
matches and social events, hiring referees, registering players with the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union (EPRU) and
paying dues to the EPRU.

“MY FIRST GAME, I WAS THROWN
IN AND I STARTED LOOKING
AROUND, WONDERING ‘WHAT AM I
DOING HERE?’
MIKE DUFFY
”

-

This year, the EPRU has begun requiring that teams have
coaches who do not play on the field. Beginning this spring
season, the team has been coached by former wrestling coach
Fred Gruhler, who plays rugby with a club in Media.
For all the challenges, the men’s rugby team relishes its
club status. “We like the support of the administration, but
we also want independence,” said co-captain Kyung Lee ’O2
of the possibility of increased administrative regulation.
“Plus, the social side wouldn’t go over too well.”
That social side, said players, is a principal part of the
rugby experience. After each home game, the men’s rugby
team invites the visiting team to a “social” and the two teams
spend the rest of the afternoon exchanging stories over a
keg of beer. “Most of the time, no one is pissed off,” said
Mike Duffy ’OL “This is not war, so there is no anger or hostility off the field.”
According to co-captain Pablo Montagnes ’O2, the social
culture is due in large part to the “socio-political aspects of
rugby’s origins,” which have become part of a tradition
passed from old-time England to the Swarthmore of today.
Named after the prestigious preparatory school where it was
invented about two hundred years ago, rugby has always
been played by clubs. Following games, competing teams
would retire to the clubhouse of the hosting team to share
drinks, a common tradition of the British Isles.
The Swarthmore team may not have a clubhouse at its dis-

posal aftereach game, but, said Montagnes, "we gather and we
sing songs with the other team." The Dash for Cash and the
periodical streaking around Wharton courtyard in celebration
of a rugger's first try (goal) are both part of another tradition,
one less likely to have come from the Britons.
Duffy participated in the rugby social scene for many
seasons before he actually joined the team. Friendly with
some of the ruggers, he was a regular at the smaller gatherings as well as the all-campus parties thrown by the team.
He is one of several seniors, including Keith Bentrup 'Ol,
James Jones 'Ol and Sam Picard 'Ol, who began playing for
the first time in the fall of this
year.

"My first game, I was thrown
in and I started looking around,

wondering 'What am I doing
here?'" said Duffy. Since the
rugby team is relatively small,
with 17 or 18 active players this
season, he could be fairly sure
that bench-warming would not
make up a large part of his game.
In fact, he credits the playing
time he's gotten for helping him
learn the game quickly.
According to the Web site
www.rugby.com, the basic game
involves 15 players and lasts 80
minutes, dividedinto two halves
ofcontinuous play. The object of
the game is to score as many

points as possible by carrying,
passing and kicking an oval ball.
Tries, worth five points, are
scored in the "try zone" at each
end ofthe field and must involve
placing the ball on the ground

with downward pressure. After
a try, a conversion may be at-

tempted by place kick or drop kick. If the ball passes over
the bar and between the goal posts, the conversion is successful and results in a further two points. Points may also
be scored from a drop kick in general play, worth three
points, and a penalty kick, also worth three points.
The ball may not be passed forward, though it may be
kicked forward, and players may not receive the ball in an
off-sides position, nor may they wait in such a position.
Players may not be tackled without the ball. Play only stops
when a try is scored, the ball goes out of play or an infringement occurs. "Much of the game is played on the fly," said
David Thomas 'O2. "It's not like football, where every play
is cataloged and diagrammed." When the ball goes out, it is
thrown back in at a line-out, where the opposing forwards
line up and jump for the ball. Infringements result in a penalty, a free kick or a scrum. In a scrum, the opposing forwards bind together in a unit and push against the other
forwards, trying to win the ball with their feet. There are
not separate offensive and defensive units.
The game lends itself to different interpretations, even
by members of the same team. "It's a release of some kind
of stress," Duffy said, comparing the sport to the movie
"Fight Club." One of the reasons he joined the team was
because the rugby players "seemed like typical Swatties,
he said, "but then they would be running around, beating
the crap out of people. It's an escape from the grind."
Lee agreed. "Physicality is what draws a lot of people,"

he said. "It's what makes the game what it is."

For Stephen Duvignau 'O3, the game is about something
different. "I ask myself [why I play rugby] all the time, because I'm small and I don't play to get hit," he said. "When
you see lines of men moving and the patterns they create,
supporting each other and creating space for the ball, that's

rugby."
Tim Lang 'O4 concurred, referring to the punching and
other questionable behavior of some teams as atypical. "It's
noticeable," he said. "You can't be an animal and seem nor-

mal on the rugby field."
Wherever the men's rugby team ends up next year, the
spirit of the team will remain intact.

So you want to

be a baller?
Michael Jordan stopped by my Mary Lyon palace
last night. He wanted me to be the first to know definitively that he's making a comeback. Okay, maybe not. I
can only dream of MJ's return. But I do know of some
other players that will enter the NBA next fall players whose decisions to join the league make George W.
Bush's trade of Sammy Sosa look brilliant. Yes, these
ingenious players are high school and college prospects
who, like Donnell Harvey, William Avery and Al
Harrington before them, are certain they'll be NBA

stars. Unfortunately, they're wrong.

Eddie Griffin (Freshman, Seton Hall, Forward):
If Griffin thinks he can score, rebound and block shots,
he's correct. If he thinks he can do all of those things on
a professional level, he should take a long look in the
mirror until he sees Yinka Dare. Griffin does have talent, and he may have enough to warrant being a top
draft choice. However, I have my suspicions about a
player who was unable to guide his team to the NCAA
Tournament. Even Monmouth qualified.
Troy Murphy (Junior, Notre Dame, Forward):
Can you say Chris Crawford? Murphy can shoot (without a man in his face), and he can play defense (if he's
guarding Dickey Simpkins or Jud Buechler). At best,
Murphy will be the second coming ofChristian Laettner.

HAVING AN OBSCENE AMOUNT
OF SIZE CAN HELP ON THE
COLLEGE LEVEL, BUT THE LAST
FAT MAN TO MAKE IT IN THE
PROS WAS OLIVER MILLER.
Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

Jason Richardson (Sophomore, Michigan State,
Guard): Just because he sports a wristband, wears No.
23 and looks like Michael Jordan doesn't mean he's as
good as MJ. Sure, Richardson had a solid season at MSU,
but he was completely shut down in the Final Four. Nobody who is shut down in college makes it in the pros.
Kevin Lyde (Junior, Temple, Fat): Can you say
Tractor Tray lor? Having an obscene amount of size can
help on the college level, but the last fat man to make it
in the pros was Oliver Miller. Lyde needs to shed fifty
lbs. and grow five inches to be a legitimate NBA prospect.
Michael Wright (Junior, Arizona, Forward):
Think Donnell Harvey. (Read: think Michael Wright has
absolutely no chance of signing another contract once
his mandatory three-year rookie contract expires.) If
he's lucky, the Spurs will select him in the thirdround.
Wait, there is no third round.
High School Players You've Never Heard Of: I
guarantee they're the scrawniest, most prepubescent
players you have seen since Kevin Garnett entered the
league. Like Garnett, though, one or two of these players may have a chance in the NBA. As for the rest...
College Players You've Never Heard Of: Herein
lies the problem. Ifthese guys have put up average numbers for Podunk University, chances are they don'thave
what it takes for the pros.
Richard Jefferson (Junior, Arizona, Forward): I
save Jeffersonfor last because I actually think he has a
long professional career ahead of him. Also, he's intelligent enough to admit that he needs one or two years
of bench warming in the NBA before he can step into
games and really make a difference. He's a solid pick
for a perennial playoff team looking to pick up a future
star late in the first round.

Rookie Jackie Khan pressures the ball while Katie Tarr and Erika Williams look on. Khan has scored at least one goal
in each of the last five games. The Garnet lost to Gettysburg, 13-6, to fall to 1-3 in Centennial Conference play.

BY KATIE CLOONAN
The Swarthmore's women's lacrosse team stayed close to

home last week as they hosted teams ranging from Gettysburg
College, thenranked No. 7 nationally in Division lE, to local team
Cedar Crest. Early this week, the Garnethit the local backroads

to Widenerand Chestnut Hill.
On Thursday, April 5, the Garnet faced Cedar Crest for a onesided matchup that Swarthmore won 12-3.Up and down the field,
offensively and defensively, the Lady Laxers clearly dominated.
Swarthmore proved its depth as seven different players scored.
Katie Tarr 'O2 had four goals and Mavis Biss 'O2 had three, while
Kristen English 'Ol, Natania Kremer 'Ol, Drea Figueroa 'O2, Jackie

Kahn 'O4 and Christina Hinton 'O4 each tallied one.
Next up, on Saturday, April 7, the Garnetfaced the perennial
powerhouse Gettysburg Bullets. The Lady Laxers got off to a weak
start as Gettysburg tallied the first goal. Despite a six-goal effort
by the Garnet, Gettysburg showed Swarthmore 13 reasons for
their national ranking. Tarr had three goals and one assist, while
Biss, Kahn, and English each found the back of the Bullet goal
once. The Garnet had 40 ground balls to the Bullets' 20. In the
end, it came down to who came up with the ball after the draw,
as Gettysburg had 12 draw controls while Swarthmore had nine.
The following Monday, a different Garnet women's lacrosse
team showed up against local rival Widener University. Traditionally an intense scrappy team, Widener stood no chance
against a fired-up Garnet squad. The team meshed particularly
well, including top-notch backfield defense from Heather Kile
'O2, Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3, Meg Woodworth 'O3 andSari Altschuler
'OL The fouranchored a fierce full-field team defensive effort that
limited Widener to just one goal. Justene Hill 'O4 picked up her

first collegiate goal as the Garnet rode valiantly home down
Chester Road with the final score registering in at 16-1
To finish off their streak oflocal games, the Lady Laxers
traveled to nearby Plymouth-Whitemarsh to battle Chestnut
Hill on Tuesday, April 10. A few miles away from her alma
mater, English dished out three goals and threeassists to pace
out a 16-6 win over the "Hill." Tarr racked up her offensive
stats with five goals and four assists. Particularly fierce offense was played by Lucy Lang 'O3 and Amber Adamson 'Ol,
who scored two goals each. The one-two punch of Widener
and Chestnut Hill provided the team an opportunity to test
the depths of the bench, as every present Garnet player saw
playing time in both games. At the beginning of the week,
Tarr sat at third on the Centennial Conference season scoring list, averaging 3.5 goals a game. In goalkeeping, Jenn Hart
'O3 is second in the conference, with a 57.6 save percentage.
The Lady Laxers hope to carry their recent high-scoring
trend on into theweekend as they face Franklin and Marshall
College, ranked twelfth in the nation, on Saturday, April 14.
A win against the Diplomats would brighten the Tide's playoff hopes. The alumni game following the matchup should be

conference game against F&M, with the alumni game following at approximately 1:30 p.m.
