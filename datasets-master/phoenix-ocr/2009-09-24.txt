of the Good Food Compost Project, fears
that the golf cart won't be able to handle

the addition ofEssie Mae's Snack Bar to
the compost pick up rounds.
The composting of cups, napkins and
plates in Essie Mae's, which began last
Wednesday, is the newest of the group's
three composting initiatives. Several
other initiatives, including Mary Lyon
breakfast room composting and solarpowered rotary composters, are in the
planning stages.
For the past two years pre-consumer

Center coffee bar as well.
After compostable items enter the
green bins, they are picked up and
dumped behind the grandstands of
Clothier Field. Then a Scott Arboretum
staff member picks it up and takes it to
the Swarthmore Municipal Composting
Plant in the Crum, which handles the
entire borough's composting.
"We haven't really met with any opposition," Dahlquist said. "We try to do
everything we can to make their [the
arboretum's] pick up easy for them
because they're doing us a big favor."
Gusti Ruhri, the dining services cash
operations manager, was eager to help
the students begin composting Essie
Mae's waste. "Just the thought behind it,
it's wonderful," she said.
But even though the new project has
just begun, the Compost Project has
already run into difficulty. "Essie Mae's
is a bit of a challenge because we already
had our routine down," Dahlquist said.
What's even more challenging, according to Dahlquist, is that students have
already eaten off the plates they throw
into the compost bins. If they accidentally leave any food on the plates or do not
completely scrape them off, the whole bin
cannot be composted and must be thrown
out.

In the first week of Essie Mae's com-

posting, this has already been a problem.
"Unfortunately, when I look into the com-

posting containers, I see that the customers often throw out everything indiscriminately, thus somewhat defeating the
purpose," Ruhri said. She suggested that
further education, either through more
signage or campus-wide emails, could
help with the problem.
The Compost Project encountered a
similar problem when it tried to set up
post-consumer composting in Sharpies.
"We have trouble getting people to throw
away cups in the Kohlberg bins,"
Dahlquist said. "We try doing a scrape-off
in Sharpies, and no one listens. So that's
probably never going to work."
The group is still thinking of ways to
expand its project. "Right now we're
thinking of expanding next into ML,"
Dahlquist said. The pre-consumer waste,
such as eggshells, from the breakfast
room could be composted in a manner

similar to the Sharpies system.
"It would be great if we had all the
waste that students produced, like
banana peels and things like that, composted as well," she said.
Hannah Jones 'l2 and Zein Nakhoda
'l2 ran ML composting on their own last
year and hope to spread their project to
all dorms this year through the Green
Advisor program. "The Green Advisor
program has grown quite a bit this year,"
Jones said.
Now with more GAs, dorm waste composting is a possibility. Jones explained
that not only would GAs have to carry
compostable waste out of the dorms, they
would also have to educate residents
about what is compostable.
A pilot program will begin next week
in ML, Mertz and Dana. Study breaks and
fliers will teach students what they can

and cannot throw in the compost bins.
Most food waste, such as orange rinds,
coffee filters and tea bags with their staples removed, can be composted, with the
exception of dairy products.
The Compost Project may also have
the opportunity to acquire two solar-powered rotary composters. Kanti Somani, a
Deputy U.S. Marshal and owner of the
worms.com composting business, found
the Good Food Project website three
years ago. According to Jamie Hansen
Lewis 10, Good Food garden co-manager,
Somani contacted Marshall Morales 'OB
in July 2008 saying that he had found a
description of the group's mission online
and wanted to write a grant proposal for
them.
Marshall passed on this information
to Jim Marzluff 'OB who then met with
Kanti to discuss the details. Somani
applied to the state of Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection
for a Compost Infrastructure grant to
build two stainless steel bins with solarpowered motors for rotation, a project
similar to one he completed at Princeton
in 2002. He received the grant in May and
notified the Good Food Project.
The Compost Project still needs the
administration to approve the building
project.

"It would be innovative and interest-

ing if he were to do this because no one's
ever built solar-powered rotary composters before," Toby Altman 'lO, co-coordinator of the Good Food Composting
Project, said.
The new composter would create compost of a higher grade for use by both the

Scott Arboretum and the Good Food garden.

Free condoms to be placed in dorms within the week
BY DANTE FUOCO

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

Aiming to make sex safer on campus,
the Sexual Health Counselors are beginning to work with RAs to stock recently-funded condoms in every dorm.

This year the SHCs have
received $4OO of SBC funding for
roughly 8,000 condoms and
$5O for "condom pockets"
the places where some of
the condoms will be
provided in dorms.
This is the first
year that the

fund male condoms. These condoms arrived on
Tuesday and SHC Eric
Glickman 'lO said that

dorms' medicine cabinets and

week or so, especially after the
i&
SHCs' meeting on Sunday.
"What we're trying to do is make sure
everyone on the campus gets condoms,"
Glickman said. "We thought the best
way to do that would be to go to SBC."
SHC Alyssa Fatal 'l2 said that availability of condoms is important in the
college environment.
"A lot of students, especially in college, are having sex," she said. "And if
it's easy for them to access condoms,
then it'll be easier for them to practice
safer sex."
When asked if this influx in condoms
was precipitated from any kind of campus feedback last year, Glickman said
that he thought it was "more of an effort
coming from within the group."
"SHCs really want to help streamline
access" to condoms, he said. This
includes a more direct communication
between RAs and SHCs than in the past.
While before RAs and SHCs would often
go to Worth separately to get condoms
...

for their halls or dorms, an SHC will now
be responsible for directly providing
condoms to RAs in each campus dorm.
Amelia Kidd 'll, an RA and an SHC,
said in an e-mail that she is glad that
this initiative will foster more communication between the two
groups.
"Not only will it increase
the dialogue between the
two groups, but it will

Services
Kotarski said. Despite
budget cuts, Worth's current yearly budget still
includes money for about
4,000 condoms, as much as in
years past, she said. SHCs and
RAs have free access to condoms
from Worth,, and students have the
option of buying condoms for 50 cents a
piece from Worth or for higher prices at
the CVS close Jto the college.
"[Condom availability] is a relatively
inexpensive way to safeguard the health
of those who may not have anticipated
the need to have safe sex," Kotarski said,
explaining that condoms are effective
and cheap "preventive measures" for
dealing with more serious issues like
STDs and STIs that could, in turn,
require more expensive care.
Glickman said that even with more
condoms on campus, Kotarski has been
flexible in providing condoms: "Beth has
constantly assured us that we'll have
what we need within reason. When we
say that we need condoms, they'll help us
get them."
While stating that "nothing .has

changed" from Worth's end, Kotarski
stressed that Worth is encouraging students to be "prudent" with their access to
condoms.

Allocation of donation to library under review
The council discussed ways to

for the purchase of textbooks. Since
textbooks quickly become obsolete
as new editions are produced, the
library suggested renting the textbooks from online sites by semester.

However, it is uncertain how much
the library will save from that. The
council also debated which kinds of
textbooks to get. Ideas suggested
include getting introductory course
textbooks only and having a student

Bookstore removes fee from wholesale costs for campus

The new wholesale program now waives that fee,

In an effort to save the college money amid a struggling economy, the bookstore has started to waive fees

meaning that the bookstore is still facilitating the connection with wholesalers but not breaking even. These
large-quantity purchases include orders for supplies,
apparel, gift items, computer products, consumer elec-

"From the bookstore's perspective, it is more work
and less income. But from a campus perspective, I
think it makes sense,"
she said. "[The fee] was

Grace added that while saving money is important,
the bookstore wants to contribute more.
"The bottom line is that we are a department of the
college just like any other," Grace said. "We look a little differentbecause we are a store. But we are owned
and operated by the college and for the college. And we
just want to be good 'team players.'"
While it might seem as thdugh the wholesale program would just create more work for the bookstore,
Grace said that it works well for both the bookstore
and the college.
"Hopefully the benefit to departments, and ultimately to the college, is better pricing. We like to think
better service goes along with it," she said. "It makes
us more valuable customers with our vendors because
we are sending more business their way. And it makes
us a more valuable contributor to the campus as well."
Grace conceded that there are concerns. "My
biggest concern is that we might get 'too busy' with
the wholesale program and that the bookstore side of
our operation would suffer."
All the same, she is optimistic.
"We are managing pretty well so far," Grace said.
"Of course, the program is in its infancy. As it grows
we may experience some growing pains. But we'll figure it out. I think this could be a strong benefit to the
college for a long time to come."

Students back from study abroad
present at first classics colloquium
BY SHELIA LOBO
BICONEWS.COM, SEPT. 15, 2009
Recently returned undergraduates and graduates
abroad spoke at Friday's first Classics
Colloquium in the Department of Greek, Latin and
Classical Studies and the Department of Classical and
Near Eastern Archaeology.
"This is the first colloquium of the year," said

from

Greek, Latin and Classical Studies Professor Radcliffe
Edmonds. "It's always for students who have done a
year abroad, or an archaeology dig over the summer,
or worked in Professor Peter Magee's site in the United
Arab Emirates during the winter."
The Classics department runs the colloquium weekly, typically every Friday. Following this week's meeting, it will host distinguished scholars, usually from
other institutions, who will speak and present papers
on various subjects relating to the field.
After a brief tea in the Quita Woodward Room, students and faculty relocated to lecture room 821 of
Carpenter Library. Speakers showed PowerPoint presentations depicting their academic experiences and
travels, as well as advertising their selected programs
of study or work.
"We have some [study abroad students] every year,"
Edmonds said. "A large number of archaeology majors
go on some sort of dig at some point."
As undergraduates in the College Year in Athens
program, students are able to personally visit the sites
of the ancient world about which they write and read.
Nicole Williams 'lO spent the past summer in Athens,
while Emma Buckingham 'lO and Lara Pollack 'lO were
there for the past fall.
"I took an Archaeology ofAthens class," said Emma
Buckingham. "Every time we met up, we met at a different site in Athens... at the Acropolis, the Agora.
Buckingham and Pollack also experienced the
December riots in Athens.
"It was a very surreal experience. The rioting was
mainly property damage and attacks on the police, confined to a few districts," said Pollack.
"It didn't encroach upon where we were. We would
get text messages from the school alerting us to use
caution in certain areas. We never felt unsafe."
Teresa Silva 'lO and Catharine Judson 'lO also visited Athens, working at the Golandris Museum, excavating, giving tours, creating an audio guide and setting
up exhibits.

Nicole Colosimo and Lisa Mays, graduate students, both worked in Greece for several months.
Colosimo worked on the Ayia Sotira excavation.
Mays worked on excavations in Athens and Agora.
Emily Stevens, a graduate student, participated in
the Saronic Harbors Archaeological Research Project
along the Saronic Gulf of Greece. The project surveyed the architecture of the region and was codirected by Daniel J. Pullen from Florida State
University and Thomas F. Tartaron from the
University of Pennsylvania.
Steven Karacic,

Students raise money
to help pay off citations
BY WALEED SHAHID
BICONEWS.COM, SEPT. 15, 2009
Sitting at a picnic table at HCA the morning after the
Sept. 3 Lloyd raids, Casey Ross 'lO and Emma Richards
'l2 had already begun to look back arid laugh at the
whole incident.
In jest, Ross and Richards thought it would be funny
to create T-shirts commemorating the raids with the
phrase "Lloyd 2009: Never Forget" emblazoned on the
front. The joke has now unexpectedly culminated in a
very real fundraising idea.
Ross and Richards never expected their idea to come
to fruition, but the more they talked about it, the more
their idea of fundraising through "Never Forget" shirts
made sense.
"The idea sort of grew on its own," said Ross 'lO. They
soon realized that profits from the sale of the shirts could
be used to help lighten the cited students' fines or defray
the transport costs to the community service sites.
The T-shirt design consists of a picture of Founders
Hall with a blue ribbon over which is the phrase, "Never
Forget." The text below reads "Lloyd Around the World
Fall 2009." The back of the shirt contains the logo of
Pennsylvania's Liquor Control Enforcement.
Some students found Ross and Richards' proposed
slogan offensive as it could connote more serious
tragedies such as the Holocaust, Sept. 11 or the
Oklahoma City Bombings. Ross and Richards state that
people have the right to be offended, but that their shirts
do not refer to anything but the Lloyd raids.
Others found the "Never Forget" shirts to be a great

idea.
"If I were cited at Lloyd, I would definitely appreciate
if someone made a T-shirt for me," said Daniel Feller 'l3.
"The majority of those who have voiced an opinion
are behind us," Ross added.
Hannah-Ruth Miller 'lO decided to expand Ross and
Richards' plan by including alternate designs, available
through an online order form. Miller's variety of designs
will offer alternatives for students uncomfortable with
the "Never Forget" phrase.
"If students would vow to wear them instead of'Swat
Sucks' shirts, I'd support that," joked President Dr.
Stephen G. Emerson '74.
Ross, Richards and Miller all agree that students' positive reactions to their fundraising ideas demonstrates

that the community is working together in solidarity,
using humor to overcome a sobering experience.
"Instead of starting a riot, we decided to make funny
t-shirts," Miller said.

This year's project was disrupted early
on by the vandalism of the project's supplies. When Grein went to check on the
supplies in a secure, hidden location in
Upper Tarble on Aug. 31, she found that
shirts had been scattered across the room,
paint splattered and supplies, including
markers, paint cans and blank t-shirts,
stolen.
"It wasn't so much that they stole supplies from us, the paint and the blank
shirts; they took the old shirts that were
packed away neatly and tossed them up
on the floor. It was clearly a malicious act.
...

They didn't just mess up the area to steal
the shirts; they just wanted to mess things
up," Grein said, adding that the area was
"just like a crime scene." The project was
able to receive additional funding and
replace the stolen supplies. All of the supplies were moved to a new location.
The project is supported and funded by

the Gender Education Office under Dean
Karen Henry 'B7, which provides numerous resources for students who are dealing with issues of sexual violence, including a peer-run Survivors Support Group,
SMART (Sexual Misconduct Advisors &
Resource Team), a sexual assault response
team and ASAP (Acquaintance Sexual
Assault Prevention), a peer sexual assault
prevention program. Students may also
speak to CAPS (Counseling and
Psychological Services), which offers free
psychological counseling to students
found in Worth Health Center.
"The project can be triggering to some
survivors on campus, so I would just
encourage them to take good care of themselves and get the support they need,"
Henry said.
This year's project was organized by
Reid Wilkening 'lO and Urooj Khan 10, as
well as by new members Will Hopkins 'll,

Midwest Teen Sex Show advocates sexual honesty

Last Friday, the Sexual Health
Counselors sponsored a screen-

8

ing of the popular online video
series, the Midwest Teen Sex
Show to foster campus discussion
on teen sexuality.

The Midwest Teen Sex Show

features frank informationabout
sex with deadpan humor and
over-the-top sketch comedy skits.
It is meant to create a space for
providing an honest discussion
on all topics that stem from teen
sexuality. The show is directed
towards a younger, more conservative audience, as apparent by
its logo two cattle getting it on.
Its introduction even features a
girl clad in a blackbikini top and
cargo pants dancing on farmland.
Hosted by Nikbl Hasler, a "former expert practitioner in teen
promiscuity" and mother of
three, Hasler delivers her information with knowledge of teen
vernacular for sex and hopes that
her audience will not repeat the
same mistakes she made as an
adolescent. Their skits perfectly
encapsulate attitudes towards
teen sexuality. For example, in
the vagina episode, she captures

vagina interrupting its owner

while she reads:
VAGINA: 'Scu me, scu me! I'm

GIRL READING: Vagina?
VAGINA: Hi! Hey, we need to
talk!
GIRL READING: Yea later.
VAGINA: No. Now. You've been
ignoring me all your life and
it's not fair! I'm lonely!
GD*L READING: You're weird
and gross!
VAGINA: No I'm not, I'm beautiful! I'm a source of life and good

are for sluts.
VAGINA: Knowing your body
doesn't make you a slut, it makes
you awesome! So touch me! Feel
me! Put a dick in me! Put two

dicks in me! Scissor!
For someone with sex education, the information presented in
the show is redundant but it is
important to remember that this
show is probably countering
abstinence-only sex education.
The Midwest Teen Sex Show is
reaching their intended audience
and empowering teenagers with
honest sex information. Lorenzo

The thought of your future career

the registration for the Extern Program
this week, many students are considering the opportunity to immerse themselves in a specific career under the

The program began 30 years ago
through Judge Jed Rakoff, who takes
two students each year.

The mission of the program is that
"no matter what year, no matter where
[students] are in their career development, [they] have an opportunity to
shadow someone in a career that they're
dedicated toward or that they're just
thinking about," Laura Sibson, assistant director of Career Services, said.
The externships are coordinated and
run by Career Services and occur
the last week of winter brea

Nathalie

Kelly also learned about the amount
of work that goes into being a judge and
a clerk. "[Judges] make sure to research
everything well and have a firm basis

clerks and Judge Rackoff have in their
heads is pretty phenomenal. Their ability to research and find answers is phenomenal. Their time schedule makes
the average Swattie time schedule look

Rakoff "said that he thought it was a

I saw a member of Sharpies staff doing this and
wanted to try it out. It was on a night when the London
broil was made with a really nice chipotle onion sauce.
The red chili peppers in the sauce added a subtle mildness and gave the meat great flavor. I layered lettuce,
tomato, provolone and a thick piece ofLondon broil on
a Kaiser roll, remembering to put every last drop of
the delicious onion chipotle sauce on top of the meat.
The burger doesn't need a separate dressing or sauce
because the onion chipotle sauce keeps the meat moist
and holds the burger together. The meat is flavorful
and the Kaiser roll, in all ofits crusty exteriorand soft,
chewy interior, makes this a powerful burger. My
friend tells me that meatloaf topped with alfalfa
sprouts also makes for a delicious burger. It's a simple
combination, but the result is a gourmet, taste-budpleasing sensation. Yum.
Eat well, be happy, and stay healthy! I am always

What She's Wearing:
"The shirt's from Elie Tahari and the skirt is from my
favorite boutique, Intermix," Rodriguez said.
She is also wearing "Michael Kors sandals, a vintage
Gucci bag [not pictured], a vintage Chanel necklace, and

the belt's from Target."
In this outfit, Rodriguez mixes her love of sophisticated
designer items with her knack for findingchic, reasonably
priced items. Her detailed top and high-waisted skirt,
cinched by the vintage-looking belt, make a simple, chic
ensemble. The MichaelKors sandals are spot on with the
trend of hardware accessories and shoes.
How to describe your style?
"I would say it's playful chic

...

that sounds a little

silly!"

Where do you shop?

"My roommate actually got me into thrift stores, vintage and secondhand [clothing], so that's pretty cOol. But
mostly, I go to Bloomingdales and Saks." For more basic
items, Rodriguez likes to shop at Target and Old Navy.

Style Influences:
"I love Ashley Olsen, maybe it's the height thing, but I
really love her style," Rodriguez said. "I really admire
Rachel Zoe and what she does for her clients. I also love old
movies and French new wave cinema, so I get a lot of fashion inspiration from those sorts of films."
Favorite Designers:
Rodriguez listed some of the top names in the fashion
world, including Christian Lacroix, Chanel and Miu Miu

Shoes

Wardrobe Staples:
"Definitely a high waisted skirt because those
are really in right now and they're super flattering. A good jacket or a good sweater will go a long
way," Rodriguez said. She also likes "simple pieces"
because they're easy to combine with a lot of
things. "You're in college," Rodriguez said, "You
can't bring that much stuff with you."
Follow trends or fashion blogs?

"I pick and choose whatever I really like,"
Rodriguez said. "I also like looking at what people
wear in Europe."
Rodriguez channels her interest in European fashion by looking at blogs like StockholmStreetStyle. "A
lot of the clothes they wear are really out there," she
said, but "there's sort of this sophistication and simplicity to what they wear. It's a lot of monochromatic
colors that I think really translates into what's going
on right now in terms of fashion."
Rodriguez frequently visits WhoWhatWear.com,
which updates readers daily about fashion news and
click-to-buy clothing and beauty items, as well as the
blog The Sartorialist, which features street fashion.

Her excitement for fashion is rooted in the fact that
she went to an all-girls Catholic school and had to wear a
uniform. "People don't really dress up that much here as
they would in maybe a more urban setting, but it makes
sense because it's college," Rodriguez said.
Getting to wear different styles every day is "my outlet
for me," Rodriguez said.

subtle changes. Firstly, there seems to be
a shying away from regular leggings and
towards ankle-length, "wet-look" ones.
Black pencil skirts and skinny jeans
seem to be popular as well. The T-shirts
aren't long like they were last season;
they're just big, oversized and white.
White T-shirts haven't been a major fashion statement for well, I'm going to say
forever. They were a staple of an average
wardrobe but now they're getting their
spot in the sunlight. Any white T-shirt
about 3 sizes too big for you and embellished with black designs will be perfect.
And the second outfit? Any long, flowing, cotton dress. A maxi dress works, a
knee-length dress works. Victoria's

Now, you might be reading this in

that the outfits you're wearing right now

attractive shoes?
Problem solved. For a similar effect
but a different silhouette (and for a
tighter budget), open-toed shoes and colorful nail polish can still draw all the
attention to your feet. Colorful or patterned socks work well for this too: if
you're running around with neon yellow

shove.

The story of a day in the life
of a small town diner along the
bus route west-of Kansas City,
"Bus Stop" is both wildly fanciful and painfully human. When
a winter storm delays one of
the buses, the lives of the four
passengers on the bus unfold
in the diner, breaking up the
monotony, for Elma, Grace and
Sheriff Will Masters (Joseph
Jude Zito).
First to disembark is nightclub singer Cherie

who
sees the delay as her chance to

is to escape the clutches of her
abductor, the rootin' tootin'
cowboy Bo Decker (Howie
Brown). Next off the bus is the
eccentric and melancholy
pedophilic
professor
Dr.
Gerald Lyman (Tim Moyer),

who is trying to break free
from his self-loathing by drinking his way across the country.
Carl the bus driver (Kristopher
Yoder) is almost as happy as
Cherie to stop overnight at the
restaurant, seizing his opportunity at last to spend a little
quality time with Grace. Last
to make their way into the
diner are the outrageous Bo
and his more reasonable companion Virgil Blessing (Paul
Drake), bringing with them a

load of drama and a little
Western flavor to spice up the
mix.
The actors have energy to
spare and the script provides
numerous opportunities for
reinvention, but there isn't a
clear
directorial
vision.
Philadelphia scenic designer
Adam Riggar provides a flawless set and Maggie Baker's
period costumes are charming,
but the staging doesn't live up
to the rest of the production
components. The playing space
September 24, 2009

is challenging to be sure, but
Riggar's set provides ample
space for creativity. The actors
make the best of it, but they
seem adrift at times, as if they
are unsure of why they are on
the stage at all.
Director Tom Quinn gives
us a production that is impressively true to the era in which
the script was written but
nonetheless unfaithful to
Inge's script. Quinn doesn't
appear to have strong ties to
any particular school of acting,
a fact which is evidenced by
stylistic
the
differences
between the performances that
Foley, Moyer and Brown give
and those of the rest of the cast.
Even when the actors are pouring their hearts into a scene,
the contrast between the styles
dilutes the impact of the
moment. This is most evident
in the scene when Moyer's Dr.
Lyman falls apart, faced with
the fact that he will never real-

ly be free of his demons. Moyer
turns in a haunting performance, the kind of performance
that sticks with you long after
you leave the theater, but the

moment his speech is done, the
magic fades, displaced by the
incongruously goofy antics of

the unwilling lovers, Bo and
Cherie.

The production also suffers
as a result of the two-intermission structure. The play is not
particularly long, but Quinn
elected to observeTnge's original act designations with intermissions.Unfortunately,
Quinn's decision to stick with
that format presents some real
challenges for the actors. The
play is a high-energy caper and
the impact of the intermissions
on the energy is tangible. The
second act continues the action
of the first, with the note "a few
minutes later," but the energy
sags as if at least an hour has
passed.

With one fewer intermission and a stronger directorial
presence, "Bus Stop" could
have been great. But for now,
Quinn and his team have settled for a solid and pleasant
interpretation of the Inge classic. Considering the limitations of its size and location
the theater is an hour's drive
North of Philadelphia on a
route that includes colorful
street names like "Cowpath
Road"
the Montgomery
Theater far exceeds expectations.

are badass. Edward Cullen, eat your heart out.

Not that my vampires are devoid of feeling. Bill

is sweet, kind and loving to Sookie,
(Anna Paquin)
which makes it all the more terrifying when his fangs
come out and he goes for someone's throat. Bill is also
adorable because, having been "turned" at the end of
the Civil War, he remains the epitome of the Southern
gentleman. When he told Jessica (the fabulously bratty Deborah Ann Woll), the young vampire he turned at
the end of the first season, that she "looks quite a
vision" on her way to her date with a local boy, I
almost passed out from the adorableness of it all.
Bill, however, is not the vampire I truly lust after,
despite his adorable Southern affectations and the tenderness with which he treats Sookie. That vampire
would be the unbearably sexy and fascinatingly dangerous Eric Northman (played by Alexander
Skarsgard, a gorgeous slice of Nordic beauty who was
named Sexiest Man in Sweden for five years in a row.
Given that Sweden is full of impossibly beautiful people, this should tell you just how hot Skarsgard is).
Northman is the vampire "sheriff' to whose whims
Bill is constantly subject and whose fascination with
Sookie has recently turned into something that looks
an awful lot like love. Really twisted love, in which
Eric tries to win Sookie over by tricking her into

dreams which reach a level of sexiness that was previously unknown in the universe. Plus, he refers to children as "like humans, but miniature. Teacup human."
Be still, my heart.
Despite my deep felt allegiance to Team Eric, however (yes, there are T-shirts, and no, I do not own one),
I'm really pulling for Bill and Sookie as a couple. This
is partly due to the unhealthy level of jealousy that I
experience every time someone who isn't me gets all
hot and heavy with Eric, but mostly (I hope) due to the
level of truth that the writers of "True Blood" bring to
Bill and Sookie's relationship. He may be a vampire
and she may be able to read minds and shoot electricity out of her hands, but they end up dealing with the
same issues that all couples have to work through:
jealousy, trust, arguments about whether Bill murdered Sookie's uncle. Well, that last one might not be a
normal issue, but still. The great thing about "True
Blood" is that, unlike many other TV shows (I'm looking at you, "Gossip Girl"), characters don't break up
after one fight or one lie. They stay together, they fight
it out, they talk, they have hot make-up sex, and they
get on with their lives. Much as I want to see Eric
naked at all times, I don't want Bill and Sookie to selfdestruct in order for that to happen.
Of course, Bill, Sookie and Eric are not the only
characters on the show, despite the fact that approximately 98 percent of "True Blood" discussion centers
on the three of them. The show features a fantastic
cast of characters, none of whom are anything less
than fully human (even if, technically, they don't fit
into the "human" category). One of my personal
favorites, and great addition to the show, is Bill's
aforementioned "progeny," Jessica. Deborah Ann Woll
makes the character bratty and sensitive, unsure of
her newfound powers and rebellious all at the same
time. One of the most delightful plotlines of Season 2
focused on Jessica's budding relationship with Hoyt
Fortenberry (Jim Parrack), a former football star and
construction worker whose love for Jessica is one of
the sweetest and most tender things I've ever seen on
television. Their puppy love is adorable, and the dissolution of their relationship at the end of the season
is heartbreaking, although it does allow for a killer
scene in which Jessica seduces and then drains a

Despite the impression this column may have
given, "True Blood" is not all about relationships, or
even sex (although, this being HBO, there is a lot of
sex, all of which, is displayed in graphic detail). There
is endless intrigue and mystery, supernatural creatures of all sorts (in addition to vampires and
telepaths, there are shapeshifters, Manaeds, and
apparently werewolves), and there is an overarching
conflict between the vampires and the fundamentalist
Christians who want them destroyed. Overall, "True
Blood" is not just a story of vampires and the women
who love them; it's about the interactions between
people and how those interactions may be loving or
manipulative, gentle or poisonous. Despite all the
supernatural creatures, the wars, and the drama,
"True Blood" is about life in all its complexity. And
really, what's more dramatic than that?

EVS Appreciation Week

This week is Environmental
Services, or EVS Appreciation
Week, and one EVS Technician
prefaced the occasion by having
to clean up fecal matter deposited in the closet of a resident.
Sadly, this story may not even
be the most repulsive occurrence that has resulted from the
exciting weekend activities
Swarthmore students have long
participated in. It can be quite
confidently said that, virtually
every weekend, at least one of
the dorms on campus is plagued
by vomit on carpets and other
similarly disgusting byproducts
of having too much fun.
For example, last year fea-

the women's bathrooms in
Willets Hall that was paired
with a student's vomiting right

water. In situations such as this,

bystanders and busily vomiting
sufferers alike seems to be resignation. Each person affected by
the vomit (or the feces) resigns
themselves to the fact that there
is not much they can do to remedy the crisis
and if there
were, going down that path
would clearly take too much

effort. After all, Swarthmore
College has EVS Technicians on
hand to clean up messes. And so
resignation becomes indifference, both to the stench of the
human excrement and to the
thankless job the faceless EVS
Technician will have to do on
Monday morning.

pie's rationalizations in those
situations might seem simplistic

or harsh, but there is no doubt
that the temptation to give up at
four in the morning because
"Hey, it's EVS' job to clean it up
anyway" is an easy one to succumb to. And it is one that students do give in to far too often.
Unfortunately for those who
seek solace in that kind of reasoning, it is most certainly not

without worrying that fecal matter is on the -dispenser. They

the smaller particles of dirt that
cannot so easily be picked up
and disposed of.
They do not remove shit from
people's closets.
There is an overwhelming
lack of respect for the humanity
of the EVS Technicians on campus. Admittedly, their job is to
help keep Swarthmore a cleaner
place. But there are some tasks
that we ask of— or force upon
them that challenge all concepts
of civility. Resident Assistants
across campus do their best to
contain our baser natures by

tems where, for example, failure

to clean up vomit in the middle

of the hall means everyone has
to pay a certain amount of
money to the hall fund (which
sometimes is given to the EVS
Technician inconvenienced).
Sometimes, though, even a monetary penalty is not a strong
enough deterrent, at which
point EVS Technicians have no
choice but to clean up the mess.
After all, it is not as though they
can vacuum around the mess
until somebody's conscience
takes over.
Clearly, the problem is one of
personal responsibility and
accountability. And one of
not just for the EVS

Technicians, but for the places
that we have to inhabit for most
of the year. It is easy to dismiss
the responsibility of caring for a
dormitory because the place is,
after all, only temporary housing. That does not mean there is
a free license to destroy property. Four weeks ago, the third
floor lounge in Alice Paul still
added meaning to AP's status as
one of the "new dorms." Now
there are tables with legs missing and chairs with unidentifiable stains on the cushions. At
what point does letting loose on
a weekend, even after the laborious struggle Swarthmore students have to grind past every
week, go too far?
Decompressing after a hard
week's work does not mean that
all sense of accountability is
thrown out of the equation as
well. When there is vomit on the
carpet, it defies human decency
for nobody to clean the mess
because "that's EVS' job."
Obviously, this issue is not

pietsch

one that is confined to
Swarthmore. Indeed, the aftereffects of parties at certain other
campuses are likely far more
catastrophic than can be found
here. On some campuses, EVS
Technicians have even greater
responsibilities
at Claremont
McKenna College, for instance,
the EVS workers also have to
provide services to individual
dorm rooms.
From an outsider's point of
view, no firm conclusions can be
drawn from how that expanded
role affects the dignity with
which Claremont McKenna's
students treat their EVS workers. There is no doubt, however,
that there are problems of how
to ensure accountability from
dorm residents at campuses all
across the country.
Now, would the fact that it
was a fellow hallmate's job was
to clean up vomit and feces
change how residents treat such
regrettable incidents?
There is, of course, an aversion to creating more manual
labor-oriented jobs for student
workers on campus. An intellectually-driven community is
understandably resistant to having its students perform bluecollar work; the consternation
over servers at Sharpies is
already widely acknowledged.

But it would be a telling test of
our civility if, perhaps, a student employment opportunity
that complemented EVS' work
was created—say, for example,

among residents.

Whatever the format, the key
point is to make a resident the
one responsible for cleaning up.
It would be an interesting study
in how we treat those whose
thankless task is to remove our

messes.
Our consciences, perhaps,
would be more easily moved if
we knew that our hallmates
were the ones who had to suffer
through janitorial duties. Or
perhaps we would continue on
as we always have.
This exercise in the hypothetical is not mere wishful pondering. It highlights what is quite
blatantly the great dichotomy of
our campus: for all the environmentalism and social activism
that students promote, we can
stillmake drastic improvements
in how we treat our EVS
Technicians.
The counterargument, of
course, is that perpetrators of
vomit or feces left unattended
represent the great minority of
students. Truthfully, however,
that rings more like an excuse
than an argument.lt is past time
to take responsibility for our
messes.

It seems all discussions of health care
are infected by some citation of
Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, or OECD, numbers that
compare health care spending to gross
national product, or GNP, across OECD
countries and juxtapose statistics of
national health care outcomes to these
ratios. Although the health care outcome
comparisons are flawed, the primary concern here is why Americans are so fascinated by the percentage of GNP devoted to
health care.
While recent auto bailouts and passed
protectionist policies suggest that many
Americans and much of Washington still
perceive tangible manufactured products
as the primary source of our nation's output, an economic perspective yields
another point of view. With a few exceptions, anything on which consumers are
willing to spend money is important to
our economy.
This idea, however, is hard to understand. Since health care is a service-based
industry and the value of services is much
less quantifiable than that of tangible
goods like manufactured steel or tires, it's

Division HI just doesn't get enough respect. I'm not
saying that I'm a better player than Scottie Reynolds, or
that I'd get playing time at UPenn, but I am saying that
I'm sick of being in the shadows of Division I athletes.
Even on a non-athletic scale, how sick are you of people not knowing that Swarthmore exists? It's as if
Swarthmore being a reputable school is a myth, and I
just have to take their word for it. I know it gets tiring
that the name Swarthmore doesn't speak for itself the
way Brown does, and that your Ivy League friends get
more respect and attention, even though Swarthmore is
just as selective and just as challenging as any of those
schools. But what really gets on my nerves is how people just don't understand Division 111 athletics.
.We're treated like second-class citizens just because
people are uninformed.
Here's what most people know: Division I athletes
work their asses off. Between exhaustive travel schedules and mind-blowingly difficult workouts and training
regimens, mentally taxing worries about retaining
scholarship dollars and impressing coaches in a no-offseason format, there are few things that require more
commitment. I respect the hell out of them.
People also seem to have some concept of the trials of
Division 111 athletics. We actually have to do our homework. Academics come first, always. But that's where
the knowledge stops.
However, I'm not here toplay misery poker with time
management issues or relate sob stories of athletes who
have to do homework, because I think this issue goes
deeper than that.
I get that it's hard work, that it's cut throat, and that
people are gunning for scholarship dollars at the higher
levels. I understand how much harder I'd run if $30,000
was on the line, but that's exactly the point. It's easy to
run hard when so much is at stake. My question to the
Division I athlete is this: How hard would you run if
nothing were at stake? If you knew you had a spot on the

team, you knew you were going to get playing time, and
you knew that you weren't going pro, how motivated
would you be?
Not every Division EI athlete has the same drive to
improve, but let's think about those who do. There's
tremendous tension in the desire to get better and the

opportunity to actually do so. It's easier to work out
when someone is pushing you. Personally, I have a lot of
trouble upholding my training schedule.
I have an ambitious schedule and drive to improve,
but it isn't uncommon for me to miss a workout from
plain laziness. I'm my own boss, and it's easy to cut
yourself some slack. In a nutshell, Division I athletes
have more people and more dollars invested in their success. The situation I described of getting playing time
and having a guaranteed spot may sound ideal. And in
the eyes of many, if is, but to those who are constantly
looking to improve, finding motivation in those types of
situations is a struggle.
The way I see it, every added pressure that a Division
•I athlete faces is a luxury that I don't have. To list just a
few, the opportunity to work with professional coaches
year-round, the accountability of coach-mandated practices, and the fear of what's at stake are all motivating
factors that I just can't duplicate. It's fight or flight in a
way. We don't really have control over this basic human
instinct. A Division I athlete is in athletic fight or flight.
Another factor that gets overlooked is the subject of
team chemistry, described by Coach Wimberly in the
basketball's team's "Thoughts to Consider," which stated that "As individuals develop and display determination, aggressiveness, responsibility, sacrifice, and all-out
effort, a particular camaraderie sets into that group and

becomes infectious."
Chemistry can become a challenge in Division 111.
The tension of people missing "voluntary but strongly
encouraged" workouts and discrepancies in work ethic
within a team are major issues for team chemistry. In
Division I, it's not to say that everyone puts in the same
amount of effort, but the difference between the hardest
worker and the biggest slacker isn't as magnified.
Former Duke point guard Dick DiVenzio offers another
perspective, and I'm in agreement. I feel like the greater
the grind, the greater the team. The greater the team, the
more fun the experience. Striving for such a grind is
much harder at the Division 111 level.
I'll leave you with Mr. DiVenzio's thoughts: "A team
may include athletes that are jealous of each other, competitive (of course), and irritated with each other's
habits and idiosyncrasies. Athletes who must be together under intense circumstances and over a long period
of time have abundant opportunities to dislike each
other and engage in petty squabbles. But let them share
pain together and they are likely to emerge as friends."

AROUND COLLEGIATE SPORTS JOURNALISM ■

Despite intent, Title IX hinders both men and women
BY JESSICA HENSLEY

KSTATECOLLEGIAN.COM, SEPT. 3, 2009

Women's sports have come a long way
since Title IX came into effect in 1972.
There are now five times as many
women in Division I athletics as there
were pre-Title IX, according to a CBS
News report. This, however, isn't necessarily a good thing.
As a former female athlete at Kansas
State, I have experienced firsthand the
negative effects Title IX has had on both
women's and men's athletics. Title IX,
while a step in the right direction, is outdated and has become a hindrance to
those it is supposed to help.
The most common, and most often
dismissed, argument against Title IX is
that it has led to the destruction of many
men's athletic teams. Hundreds of men's
wrestling, gymnastics and tennis teams
have been cut from D-I athletics programs around the country in order to

THE PHOENIX

allow universities to meet Title IX pro-

portionality requirements, according to
60 Minutes. While this should be cause
for concern for those who claim to support equality in college athletics, it is
often dismissed as unimportant or
blamed on football.
There are many Title IX supporters
who claim that if universities would

spend less on football, they would be able
to have as many wrestlers and male gymnasts as they wanted. This is a ridiculous

argument, however, in a country that is
built on the tradition of college football.
Football makes millions of dollars for
universities every year, and cutting
their funding for less profitable sports is
hardly in the best interest of college athletics.
The argument heard less often
against Title IX is that it allows universities to exploit women's athletic teams
in order to meet the proportionality
requirements. Many universities in D-I

athletics have taken to picking up one or
two women's sports and forcing upon
them huge numbers of athletes in order
to balance out the universities' football
teams, and K-State is no exception.
As an example, the equestrian team
here currently carries a roster of 60,
according to kstatesports.com. However,
the NCAA allows only 15 full scholarships per equestrian team, according to
varsityequestrian.com. Approximately
only 20 equestrian team members can
compete at any one competition.

It doesn't take much mathematical
skill to see the NCAA never meant for DI equestrian teams to reach the sizes that
they have here at K-State and elsewhere
around the country. Unfortunately,
women's rowing has suffered a similar
fate of overloaded rosters and not
enough scholarships to go around.
Why is this a problem? It's a problem

and it's a problem for male athletes
because, unless they're football players,
their team is in danger of getting axed in
favor of proportionality. While this
might seem like a problem with universities and not with Title IX, the loopholes
in the legislation are to blame for the
exploitation that is occurring.
If universities were held to more practical standards of measurement than
simple proportionality, they wouldn't
have to find ways around the system.
Title IX was written with the best of
to create equality.
intentions
Unfortunately, equality in numbers is
not the same thing. If 60 female athletes
are forced to split 15 scholarships just so
the number of male and female athletes
is proportional, where is the fairness in
that?
Female athletes suffer so the school
can meet requirements of Title IX. Both
men and women athletes would be much
better off if Title IX were abolished.

Women dismiss Red Devils in conference opener
BY TIMOTHY BERNSTEIN
tbernstl@swarthmore.edu

No longer undefeated? No problem.
Coming off their first loss of the season, the #2O Garnet women's soccer
team rebounded with a 1-0 win against
25th-ranked Dickinson College (6-X 0-1
CC) on Saturday. It was the first
Centennial Conference matchup of the
season for both teams, and a memorable
one at that.
Saturday's game at Clothier came
with an element of history. With the
Garnet (6-1, 1-0 CC) ranked 15th in the
country, it was the first time }n the history of the conference that two nationally ranked teams played each other in
women's soccer. The fact that it was
played on a beautiful Saturday afternoon didn't hurt, especially for the 300plus spectators who came out to support
the Garnet in person.
In what quickly proved to be a defensive battle, the lone offensive strike was
provided by Garnet forward Hannah
Deming 'l2, who took a rebound off of
Dickinson keeper Kailyn Hartmann and
hit the net for a 1-0 lead that stood until
the final whistle.
The Garnet, who had been defeated 20 by The College of New Jersey just
three days beforehand, improved to 6-1
on the season with the victory. The fast
start, coupled with early intra-conference success, is a great sign for a team
that had four ties against conference
opponents last year and whose conference run last season came to a devastating end to none other than Dickinson in
a 2-1 loss, despite having beaten the Red
Devils in the regular season. All of that,
however, is stored in the past a little
more easily with this latest victory.
Still, members of the team saw room
for improvement.
"I was happy we came away with a
win, but there's still much work to be
done in preparation for the rest of the
season," defender Laura Bolger 'll said.
"The quality of our play could have
been more consistent throughout the
match."
"There were times when we were
playing really hard, and times [when] I
know we could have played better,"
defender Cassie Strawser 'l3 said.
"Overall, it was a good win for us. This
win was really important for us because
it was our first conference game, and we
needed a strong win to put us on the
right path for the rest of the season."
It is hard to find fault with the
Garnet defense, however. Led by keeper
Marie Mutryn 'l2, who had six saves,
Swarthmore completely neutralized an
aggressive Dickinson attack.
Two particularly sterling highlights

bookended the game: with Dickinson
attacking on an empty net early in the
first half, defender Hannah Purkey 'll
had a clutch steal to keep the game
scoreless; later, nursing the slim lead,
Mutryn's save from inside the six
ensured a Swarthmore victory in the
conference opener.
Mutryn
was honored by the
Centennial Conference as the Defensive
Player of the Week for her efforts in the
shutout.
Dickinson, for their part, took more
than twice as many shots on the goal as
the Garnet, who had only seven to their
opponents' 16. The Red Devils, however,
didn't convert once. Swarthmore had
four shots, split evenly between Deming
and her fellow forward Julia Luongo 'lO.

Kirsten Peterson outruns Dickinson midfielder Sara White in Saturday's 1-0 victory over the Red Devils.

In their loss Wednesday, the opposing

team had the same number of shots on

goal as Dickinson, but managed to score
two goals. Here, Mutryn and the Garnet
defense came through when it counted.
According to Strawser, however, the
reasons for the victory go beyond meas-

urable statistics. She cited "continued
communication and effort on the field"
and "being first to every ball" as key
components to the victory.
So far, Swarthmore is showing that it
can win in a variety of ways, with victo-

ries coming by way of 6-1 blowouts and
1-0 overtime squeakers. This is an
encouraging sign as the thick of the
Centennial
Conference
season
approaches.

The women will take on Widener (70-1) tonight at 7 p.m. in the latest

installment of the so-called "320
Challenge" between the Garnet and the
local rivals. The series is currently tied
with one win apiece (the men's soccer
team defeated the Pride by a score of 40 on Sept. 16, while the field hockey

September 24, 2009

team fell to Widener in a 4-1 decision
on Sept. 5).
Conference play will resume at
Clothier Field on Saturday as the
women's soccer team plays defending
champions #l2 Johns Hopkins (5-2, 1-0
CC) with the hope of avenging a 1-0 loss
last September. Start time is slated for 3
p.m

new pair of Nike running shoes accompanied by a constant stream of pump-up
music. The song is temporarily interrupted by a computerized voice updating her on the mileage and pace of her
workout: three miles completed at nine
mph. At the completion of her run, she
turns off her music and a look of bliss
overcomes her.
The screen goes black except for the
Nike swoosh and the tagline "Run like
you have never run before. I am addicted." This Nike ad is probably familiar to
anyone who owns a television or computer.

Although most manufacturers of
running apparel feature similar promotions, sporting lines like "Just do it,"
Nike always has been at the forefront of
shoe production and more importantly
shoe advertising. Their website is full of
interactive promotional campaigns to
get people online and buying their products, but it only gives quick glimpses
into the thought behind their shoe
designs.
It doesn't take long to realize that the
ad was right: We are addicted not to
running, but to running shoes. And like
most addictions, this one is detrimental

to our health.

At least according to Christopher
McDougall in his new book "Born to
Run." In search of answers to why runners are so inclined to injuries, he
claims that 65 to 80 percent of runners
sustain an injury every year

McDougall faced off with doctors, running coaches and ultra-marathoners,
crisscrossing the country and ending
up in the Copper Canyons of Mexico

with a tribe of super-runners called the

Tarahumara.
What answer did he come up with for
why running hurts so much? It's the
shoes.
With this book, McDougall joins a
growing number of writers and
researchers who are arguing that running shoes were introduced to fix problems the human foot never had. As a
result, these shoes have simply created
more injuries and a $2O billion industry.
Shocked? So was I. But the debate is
intriguing. McDougall argues that the
human foot was meant to run barefoot.
Instead of running heel-to-toe as is necessary when wearing running shoes, a
barefoot runner lands on the more cushioned sole of the foot and uses the calf
and lower leg muscles to
absorb the shock (test

So not only does
running barefoot help
avoid some of the most

common
injuries, but it actually
is more energy effi'
cient as well.
These ideas have
not escaped the notice
of shoe manufactures like Nike. In an
attempt by a shoe company to make
money off not wearing shoes, Nike
introduced the Nike Free with its
tagline, "Run supernatural." The new
shoe is supposed to mimic barefoot running while still providing the cushioning that its web site claims most runners need but that researchers have
shown causes injuries.
To accompany the new shoe is a new
advertising technique: the Bear Butte
Running Camp. In a video of this camp
on the Nike website, Olympic runners
are featured training in the mountains
completely naked, except, of course, for
their new Nike Free running shoes.
It seems that Nike missed the point
of the barefoot running movement: The
point is to lose the shoes, not your
clothes.
But then again, that wouldn't sell
shoes nearly as effectively as well-toned
and airbrushed naked people running
through scenic mountains.
Considering the extremes of Nike
advertising campaigns, it is no wonder
that researchers Robbins and Waked in
1997 suggested that deceptive advertising of athletic footwear could in fact be
a public health hazard.

Unbeaten soccer shuts out Hopkins once again
BY VICTOR BRADY

vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

In front of over 600 jpocal fans at
Clothier Field and with hundreds more
watching the live video feed online the
#9 Swarthmore men's soccer team contin-

-

ued their winning streak to start the 2009
campaign, defeating the #25 Johns
Hopkins Blue Jays by a score of 1-0 last
Saturday.

For the first time since 1991,
Swarthmore has now won back-to-back
games
against
their
Centennial
Conference rivals, stringing Saturday's
victory to last year's Centennial
Conference Championship, which the
Garnet won by a score of 1-0. This regular
season win over Hopkins (6-2, 0-1 CC) was
Swarthmore's first since 2003.
It took just six minutes for the Garnet
(7-0, 1-0 CC) to light the scoreboard.

Showing off blazing speed, Morgan
Langley 'll took a long pass from defender Brett McLarney 'l2 and beat the
Hopkins netminder for his team-leading
fifth goal of the year.
That one tally proved to be all that the

Garnet would need.

"We got the early goal, and it really set
the tone for the rest of the night. We established that they weren't going to be able
to keep us from scoring, and I think that
really put all of the pressure on them. All
of the pressure in the world," head coach

Eric Wagner said.
Though the game against Hopkins was
only the first in 2009 conference play, it
represents a crucial victory.
Pierre Dyer 'l2 outlined a few reasons
why: "Because it was our first Centennial
Conference game, we had to come out
strong," he said of the Hopkins match. "It
was the game that would tell how well we
can play against highly skilled teams.
[The win] showed us all what we are capable of."
Dyer, a critical part of the Garnet lockdown defense, cited "keeping our composure and focus during important matches," as an on-the-field area of consequence
for the men.
"The young back line is led by Gage
Newman 'll, who was named Centennial

Conference Defender of the Week earlier
this month. He continued to act as a linchpin in front of the net on Saturday, directing the traffic and keeping a fast Johns
Hopkins offense at bay.
According to Wagner, "[Newman's]
style is very different from what we've
had in the past, but it is very effective. It
is athletic; it is reading the game; it's
experience to the point where he knows
what he needs to do, and the other guys
really feed off of his confidence."
Newman, the senior member of the
group, is humbled by the honor and quick
to give credit to those around him. "We
just have a strong back line," he said, noting that the all of the defense is worthy of
recognition. In particular, Newman

tabbed John Pontillo 'l3, known affectionately as "Samurai Steel" among his teammates, as a major factor in what is proving to be a stalwart defense.
Newman's leadership by example and
experience has helped the defense to gel
into a fabulous unit. Unselfish play has
been contagious throughout the entire
team, with 10 players having scored for
the Garnet through the first six games.
Newman added that "it seemed to me

20

like [Hopkins was] just waiting for us to
make a mistake that they could capitalize
on. We stayed pretty organized shifting
from side to side, and so they didn't end
up with too many chances." Those few
shots on goal that they did manage,
Newman pointed out, were blocked in a
superb effort by goalkeeper David
D'Annunzio 'l2.
By not giving up a goal in the Hopkins
win, the Garnet extended their shutout
streak to 307 minutes. D'Annunzio has not
allowed a goal all year, and Swarthmore
has allowed only one all year. But the
sophomore goaltender was tested against
the potent Blue Jays offense.
Hopkins outshot the Garnet by a 19-12
margin, but amidst chants of his name
from the crowd, D'Annunzio was perfect,
making save after save and organizing the
defense in front of him. He left the match
with six saves in his third shutout of the
...

year.

A good team wins games, but a great
team always looks to improve, even after
wins. And even though Swarthmore is off
to a 6-0 start, both the players and Coach
Wagner recognize that there is room for
improvement. "I think that we can work
on our off-the-ball runs," Kieran Riechert
'l3 said.
Wagner added that "we definitely
aren't playing perfectly yet, and our goal
is to continue to improve, so we are going
to try to improve in all areas of our
game."
And the coaches and players certainly
appreciate playing in front large crowds.
Wagner pointed out the value of having,
noting that it is "exciting to have that

kind of interest and that kind of excitement for our program. We look forward

to the next chance to impress our home
fans."
