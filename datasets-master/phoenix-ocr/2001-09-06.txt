Alcohol present at freshman
orientation, despite ban
BY IVAN BOOTH E

Despite the official college policy of a dry
Orientation Week, alcohol was available to students at several times last week, according to
freshmen, Campus Advisers (CAs) and Residential
Assistants (RAs).
According to an e-mail sent to CAs by the
Orientation Committee, an OC member was taken
to the hospital for alcohol poisoning on the night
of Aug. 29. The police department has not cited the
student, whose name has not been released.
Several freshmen said that members of their class
also had easy access to alcohol during the week.
"At the 80s dance, people seemed to be drunk,"
Erika Seigel 'O5 said. Several other freshmen also
mentioned seeing inebriated students at this orientation event. Seigel mentioned the dance thrown
on Saturday night as another source ofalcohol.

"I saw alcohol during orientation, at the fraternities," Adam Gerber 'O5 said. Derrick Wansom 'O5
and Rebecca Davis 'O5 also said that alcohol had
been available at the fraternity houses.
"There was definitely lots of alcohol," said
Dante DeCrescenzo 'O5, who did not remember a
single social event at which he did not see alcohol.
"It wasn't like Swat is all the time," Rasika

Teredesai 'O4, a CA, said, but "people want to party."
"I'm sure it was present among freshmen and
CAs," said CA Anna Morgan 'O4. "I did know people were consuming alcohol."
Alcohol was also available to freshmen in the
dorms. "I saw a lot of alcohol transportation in
Willets during orientation," said Jessica Salvatore
'O2, a Worth RA. "It seemed really likely they were
freshmen or sophomores."
On one night, DeCrescenzo said, "a couple of
kids passed out; [I think] they were freshmen."
There were "various nights" when the freshmen
on his hall, in Willets, were drunk. He said that
RAs, however, "were really cool with them."
According to Teredesai, "People who wanted to
get alcohol could get it."
Several other CAs, asking that their names be

withheld, agreed thatfreshmen and upperclassmen
had been drinking during the Orientation Week.
"The atmosphere was complete ignorance of

the dry orientation," Salvatore said. "No one knew I
was an RA, so they were just carrying cups around
with no concern for the fact that freshman orientation was dry. I thought it was pretty shocking."
While Alejandra Hernandez 'O4, also a CA, did
not see any freshmen consuming alcohol, "there
were signs that some upperclassmen had been
drinking." David Urban, also a CA, said that while
he saw many people drinking, "no one in the

Orientation Committee or CAs provided the alcohol."
Members of the OC all refused comment for this
article. Several of the CAs were also unsure of
whether or not they should talk. "I'll just get
myself in trouble," Danielle Keifert 'O4 said, before
she declined to comment.
"How difficult is it to not drink for a week?"
said Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie, whose
office directs the orientation effort. "We really rely
on the honor system I think the upperclassmen
by and large buy into that."
Freshmen, however, seem not to agree.
Attempts to keep the campus dry "were not successful because students will flaunt rules no matter how hard they are enforced," Christopher
Ward 'O5 said. "It's really a useless rule."
"It really wouldn't bother me either way,"
Caitlin Smith 'O5 said, whether orientation was
dry or not. "People can make their own decisions,
especially once they're in college," she said.
"This is the third consecutive year that someone has gone to the hospital," Goundie said, but
"it's never been a freshman.
"It is a big concern," he said, "not just during
orientation, but year-round. If we can't get everyone to buy into it, our hand will be forced, and
we'll have to have house mothers and fathers like
we used to have." Goundie hopes that this does not
occur. "I think one of the wonderful things about
Swarthmore is that we don't have that adult super...

vision."

"I don't think it's going to work," Morgan said.
"I think a lot of freshmen, when they come to college, they're going to drink. Nothing's going to
stop them."

Man arrested for assault on student
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
Hassan West of Temple
University was arrested on May
1 regarding the assault and bat-

tery of Randy Keim 'O2. West is
currently being held for trial.
"The information leading to
his arrest was obtained within a
day of the incident," said Chief
Brian Craig of the Swarthmore
police department.
assault
The
on Keim
occurred in the early morning of
April 8, when three men, two of
whom he had verbally fought
with earlier that night at a Delta

Upsilon

party,
fraternity
attacked him in his room in

Mertz.
Following the incident, Keim
was treated for a concussion and
multiple lacerations, as well as
contusions.
Keim told The Phoenix in
April that he could identify two
of his assailants as having been
at DU that night. Chief Craig
said this week that the police
had leads to the identity of the

other two assailants in addition
to having arrested West.
"We believe they have been
identified," Craig said, "but we
were unable to come up with a
probable cause to actually make
an arrest."

Craig said he was unable to
discuss the evidence against any
of the suspects, West among them.
Lindsay McLean Stevenson,
a Bryn Mawr College student,
has stood trial after being
charged with simple assault,
resisting arrest, under-aged
drinking
and
"terroristic

threats" after an unrelated conflict with Keim that also
occurred on April 8.
Stevenson received a fine of
$6OO as a result of a plea bargain
with the district attorney.
The police have not made any
progress in other unrelated
criminal activities that happened on campus during the
spring 2001 semester.
The investigation of the Feb.
25 attempted rape and aggravated indecent assault is at an

impasse. "That [case] is kind of
in a limbo," Craig said.

"The inforr
was very limited. They [the
police] were trying to help [the
victim]
remember helpful
details," he said. "So far, we
haven't been able to come up
with anything."

Craig said the district attorney's office had cooperated with
one of the borough officers in
attempting to gather more infor-

mation.

According to the victim, the
assailant in the case of the
aggravated indecent assault
wore a ski mask, making it very
difficult for the police to identify
the perpetrator's physical traits.
In addition, the police have
made no progress in the case of
multiple counts of vandalism
committed on the early morning
of Feb. 25.
"We don't have any offender
or suspect information in [the
vandalism case]," Craig said.

Improved lighting was installed in the SEPTA tunnel this summer.

Facilities makes safety
changes over summer
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER
Security improvements—including call boxes, lighting and a new shuttle program—appeared on campus over the summer in response to student
concerns about safety. But Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave and
Vice President of Facilities Larry Schall both expressed skepticism about
whether the changes will actually increase safety on campus.
Although the improvements are designed to discourage criminals
and make students more comfortable on campus, Redgrave and Schall
both mentioned that studies have not shown call boxes to have a deter-

rent effect on crime. Redgrave also pointed out that "programs only
work if people use them," and worried that students would be reluctant
to call "just because they have a gut feeling that something is amiss."
Schall said there might be reason to fear that improved lighting and
call boxes will give students the illusion of safety, causing them to take
more risks than they should. Redgrave echoed this point.
"People shouldn't rely on lighting" as a substitute for making safe
decisions when walking around campus at night, Redgrave said.
"People should always be aware that crime is an issue
the best
approach to security is a combination of using good judgment and
making campus not conducive to criminal activity."
Four call boxes now exist on campus, located on the west side of
Beardsley, at the back door of Sharpies, at the entrance to Sharpies 111,
and on the side of the physical plant building facing the SEPTA tunnel.
Each phone has a red button that places a call directly to public safety
and a black button that accesses a regular college phone line. Schall
said the administration was working with SEPTA officials in an
attempt to install a phone by the tunnel under the train station.
A mirror was installed in the SEPTA tunnel over the summer, but
...

it was vandalized and removed over the summer. The mirror and has

not yet been reinstalled.
Further improvements include extended hours and professional
staffing for the Safewalk and shuttle programs. Schall stressed that
students are still welcome to call public safety at any time for an escort
or ride on campus, and Redgrave hoped the services would discourage
students from walking alone at night. In addition, a public safety officer will begin To patrol the campus on foot at night.
"The changes have made the campus more safe at the margins,"
Schall said, where lighting may have been poor or phones more distant

in the past.

Demolition for the new science center began this summer. The science center

will contain a new lecture hall and student lounge and is scheduled for completion in fall 2004.

Construction begins on science center
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
Construction of the college's
new science center began this
summer with a groundbreaking
ceremony
on
June
9.
Construction crews continued on
the project during the remainder
of the summer and will continue
to do so until the project's completion date, now scheduled for
fall 2004. Construction of the new
center is on schedule and has
been progressing smoothly so far,
Vice President of Facilities Larry
Schall said.

Demolition crews began tearing down the math wing of

DuPont and the building's lecture hall, formerly room 161, in
late July. This vacated space will
become home to a new two-story,
structure,
70,000-square-foot
which will include a new 200-seat
lecture hall to replace the original one. In addition, workers tore
down the canopy at the entrance

to Cornell Library to make room
for the new 2,000-square-foot science commons and balcony that
will eventually link the library
with the science center.

SEPTEMBER 6, 2001

The rest of the work on camwill consist mainly of building and renovation over the next
three years. "There are still a few
odds and ends which will be torn
down," Schall said, "but, for the
most part, the demolition is

pus

done."

The chemistry and physics
wing of DuPont is still standing

and remains home to its departments. Students taking classes in
this building, however, need to
enter DuPont through two
entrances in the building's rear.

The first, located on the building's south side, is accessible via
a path that runs behind Cornell
Library. The second, located just
beyond the building's northwest

corner, can be reached by walking through the parking lot
which occupies the space previously held by the DuPont rugby

field.

Additionally, students wishing to use Cornell Library need
to access the building through
the entrance in the rear.

The mathematics and statistics department has been most
affected by the construction, hav-

THE PHOENIX

ing relocated this summer to a
temporary space in two houses at
3 and 5 Whittier Place, about 250
feet beyond Papazian Hall. These
former private residences were
renovated to provide room for
classes, seminar and offices for
the department's faculty.
Faculty now in Whittier House
are generally excited about their
new home, although they said it
was too early to comment on how
it would affect classes.
"The faculty members in the
mathematics and
statistics
department are very happy about
our temporary quarters on
Whittier Place," said department
chair Charles Grinstead. "We feel
that we have been given adequate
space to carry out our jobs."
professor
Mathematics
Deborah Bergstrand agreed.
"The temporary math and stat
space is terrific. It's a bit off the
beaten path, but this way we are
spared most of the noise and dust
of construction. We have lovely
common space, a seminar room,
two kitchens, nice offices, and
our own backyard. Everyone
should come visit."

The next department move
will not come until the new structure is completed in June 2003,

Schall said. Then, he said, the

chemistry and physics departments will move into the new
building and renovation will
begin on the existing portion of

DuPont.
Schall said that at one point
there was the possibility of moving the physics department out of
the building, possibly into temporary trailers set up somewhere in
the area. That, however, may not
be necessary. "We hope to be able
to accommodate physics in the
new building," he said. When
renovation is complete, the mathematics and statistics department will move into this section.

IC construction nears
completion
A three-month-long project to
renovate
the Intercultural
Center, which began late last
semester, also took place this

summer.
"There is still a handful of lit-

tie details to work out," Schall
said, "but, for the most part, the
work is complete."
The renovated center features
a new mezzanine level, which

will function as a library and
meeting room, and a first-floor

office for the IC's administrative
assistant,
Sheila
Gonzales.
Schall said, however, that the
changes made to the IC were

revisable.

"It may be at some point that
the IC gets too big for its current
space," Schall said. "If that happens, the area can be restored to

a large room for use as a meeting
room by other groups."
Several other construction
projects were also completed on
campus this summer. Sprinklers
were installed in every room in
the Mertz and PPR dorms. The
bathrooms in Mertz were renovated and a laundry room, previously located on the first floor of
the building, was moved to the
basement.
Renovation of the lobby and
reception area of the field house
was started, but is not yet com-

pleted.

LPAC wall difficulties
disable cinema venue
BY MATTHEW FITTING
An accident involving the

Arts Center
wall has removed that building's
cinema as a venue for classes,
activities and weekend movies.
The incident, which occured Aug.
20, has left lingering technical
problems, and the wall can no
longer be raised or lowered.
Those in LPAC around
lunchtime on the day of the accident heard
and felt
what several described as an earthquakelike noise and tremor, as the wall
became stuck while crew attempted to raise it to separate the cinema from the main theater. And
while the "earthquake" has since
passed, its aftershocks are still
causing problems for students,
faculty and staffmembers alike.
Professors have moved to
Kirby lecture hall in Martin as
their backup theater, since the
DuPont lecture hall, sometimes
used for movie screenings in the
past, was demolished this summer to make way for the new science center.
"We've had to reschedule a
pretty large number of things,
including three regularly scheduled classes," said Susan Smythe,
managing director of LPAC. "We
anticipate the project [to repair
Lang Performing

the wall] being completed by the

middle of October."
The incident was impossible to
foresee. The wall raises and lowers using two brass nuts, which
move along two screw jacks resting on either side of the 75-ton
concrete wall. The nuts are softer
than the jacks by design, and if a
jack fails, as happened on Aug. 20,
the nut strips itself, stopping its
side from moving.
In this case, however, only the
right nut stripped, while the left
side kept rising, which resulted

in that side stopping about six
inches above the floor while the

right side stayed in the ground.
"We're not 100 percent sure
why the brass nut failed," said
Jim Murphy, manager of operations at LPAC. "It's been 10 years
and really we've had no problems
with it, so we're not sure what
caused it to eventually strip away.
I'm guessing it was a gradual
thing."
"We've kind of for 10 years
taken it for granted that 75 tons of
concrete goes happily up and
down," said Smythe. "We're very
lucky that it happened safely and
didn't cause any problems to the
building."
A team leveled the wall on
Tuesday afternoon and, according
to Stuart Hain, the director for

facilities management and the
original project manager for
LPAC, the wall rested on cribbing
for a short while, about one foot
above the LPAC floor.
The wall was further raised
on Wednesday so Hain and others could examine the screw
jacks. After examination is complete, the wall's cover plates will
be back in place and the wall
itself will again be submerged
into the floor. This will allow the
full theater to stay open for some
of its scheduled events. Two new

brass nuts, which will replace
the old ones, should be manufac-

tured in about 25 days, Smythe
said. Soon after, the cinema
should reopen.

For several cinema users,
though, mid-October can't come
soon enough. "I just know that
it's sad," said Tiffany Lennon 'O2,
a film and media studies major.

"We
couldn't watch 'The
Graduate' there for our senior
year, which was unfortunate."
Lennon is also a teaching assistant for an introductory film class

The left side of the LPAC wall was raised about six inches off the ground for several days, while the right
remained submerged in the floor.
taught this semester by Professor
Sunka Simon. Lennon said that
course has been injured by the
unforeseen problem. "It's a serious inconvenience for the first
few weeks of Film Studies 1, with
a new professor teaching it," she
said.

Simon agreed that the unexpected move to Kirby has been

difficult. "It's not the ideal space,"
she said. "First of all, the projectors are much older, and we had
to move all the equipment and
install it freshly into a new cabinet, which cost everybody more
man hours and more money, and
the equipment is sitting there in
LPAC, not being used for two or
three months."

But Gabriel Hankins 'O2, head
of the Film Society, said the
impact on that organization had
been minimal. "It's going to really be too bad in general, because
it's nice to use LPAC when you
have nice prints, and you can use
the full theater," he said. "But it
won't affect the film society very
much at all."

Police refute charges of racially motivated behavior
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
In an internal investigation published
June 15, the Swarthmore police department presented an account of its response
to an assault on Randy Keim 'O2 last April
that does not describe any racially motivated behavior or illegal entry.
The report claimed that the department's response reflected neither "actions
taken based on race or any racist attitudes
among the members of the Swarthmore
police" nor '<any illegal action taken by the
police."

In April, Swarthmore police entered the
off-campus apartment of Nii Addy 'O2 and
Prince Achime 'Ol to question them about
an hour after three unidentified men
assaulted Randy Keim 'O2 in his Mertz
dorm room. Achime and Addy told The
Phoenix last spring that the police had no
warrant and that the entry was without

cause.

"Nobody gave them permission [to
enter]," said Achime, who claimed that the
officers "told [him] to confess to an assault

charge" and that he would go to jail unless
he disclosed the identities of his "accomplices." He said he felt he was questioned
in that manner "completely because of [my]
race."
The report said the police did read
Achime his Miranda rights. The reason,
according to the report, was that one of
Achime's roommates had told the police
that Achime was not home when he actually was.
In a transcript of the police's radio communication the night of the assault, Officer
Len Poggi described Achime as "not directly related to the assault but... on the scene
apparently." The report stated that Achime
was questioned before any other sources

because Keim had named him first.
Officer William Thomas told The
Phoenix in April that "not a single officer
crossed the threshold of that apartment."
But the report states that Officer Poggi did
"briefly" enter the apartment after making
"several attempts to have someone come to
the door" by knocking. Although the report
states that the apartment door was open

wide enough to see into the apartment,
Addy claimed in April that the door had
been closed.
In a separate incident related to the
attack on Keim, Sanjay Richards 'O3
claimed that Officer Thomas entered his

dorm room without a warrant or permission and searched him and a friend for
drugs and weapons. He said the police also
took them to Mertz so that Keim could
attempt to identify them as his assailants.
The police report denies all of these
charges, asserting that Thomas' "intrusion
was minimal" and that he entered the
room to search "a pile of clothing on the
floor" for an orange fleece, which Keim had
said one of his attackers had been wearing.
"The room was not 'searched,'" the report
stated. It also asserted Richards had given
consent for Thomas to enter.
Richards and his friend were "patted
down" for the officer's safety, according to
the police report. But Richards told The
Phoenix in April that he and his friend had
been "shoved up against a wall" and told to
keep their hands on the wall while they

were searched. Richards also said that the
officer asked if he or his friend had any
weapons or drugs on them.
Thomas came to Richards' room
because he had called the college operator
for a taxicab to Philadelphia shortly after
Keim had told the police that he believed
his assailants were from Philadelphia.
None of the students made an official
complaint to the police department, nor did
they take any form of legal action.
However, their accusations generated publicity about the police's allegedly racist
actions, and students organized an "awareness walk" around the borough and a
speakout in which students gave testimonies about their experiences with the
police mistreating them based on thenrace.
Although Brian Craig, the chief of the
Swarthmore police department, had hoped
to complete the report by the end of spring
semester and share it with concerned students and staff, he said this was not feasible, as he was waiting to hear from "just
about all the parties that were involved."

Tuition increases by 4.6 percent
5.2 percent, according to the Chronicle of
Higher Education. Fee increases have averaged
about 41 percent per year over the past five
years at Swarthmore.
The college's policy in the future is to
increase fees at a rate L 5 percent above the rate
of inflation, said Paul Aslanian, vice president
offinance and planning. Aslanian said the college's expenses, as well as the size and performance of the endowment and competition
from the college's liberal arts counterparts,
play a role in fee increases.

Did you notice an increase in the college
bill this summer? For the 2001-02 school
year, the comprehensive fee at Swarthmore

Borough passes liquor referendum
BY IVAN BOOTHE
Swarthmore voters approved a referendum last May, allowing for the granting of
liquor licenses in the borough, with 796 voting in favor of the measure and 712 voting
against it. The licenses would only be available to businesses "on property owned by
an accredited college or university,"
in other
according to the referendum
words, Swarthmore College.
The passage of the referendum means
that planning for an inn on college property, slated for construction on the athletic
fields between the SEPTA train station and
the PPR dormitories, can move forward.

The project is a joint effort between the
Swarthmore borough and the college, and was
developed by a "revitalization committee"
formed several years ago.
The developer for the hotel had stated that
he was not willing to proceed with the project
unless alcohol is allowed at the inn's restaurant.
"The referendum allows the process now to
go forward," borough council member Lisa
Aaron said. Its passage, however, "just makes it
possible" for the construction of a hotel. "It
doesn't even make it likely," she said. If the resolution had not passed, however, Aaron said
the chance of building a hotel would have been
"very unlikely."

admissions dean
BY CATHY DANH

Jim Bock '9O, who served as acting
dean of admissions and finanial aid
through the 2000-2001 school year, has
been hired as the permanent admissions
dean following a rejection by the search
committee's number-one candidate

early this summer.
He brings to the position a list of
goals that includes increasing exposure
of Swarthmore and giving preferential
treatment to athletes in the form of setting aside 15 percent of each class for
them.

Although the search committee continued to look seriously at other applicants after one candidate withdrew and

another declined, "the search committee felt very comfortable ultimately
going with Jim," said Maurice
Eldridge, co-chair of the committee.
Gilbert Rose, the other co-chair, said
that "none of the other candidates really measured up to Jim." Despite a
lengthy and trying search, Rose said,

sized.
Jim Bock took on the position of acting dean of admissions after Robin
Mamlet, the former dean of admissions,
left for Stanford University last fall,
giving the search committee a year to
find a permanent replacement.
After months of sifting through
applications and conducting interviews last year, the committee chose
two finalists: Janet Lavin Rapelye of
Wellesley College and Nancy Cable of
Davidson College. Both finalists
received invitations to meet with students and faculty in the spring.
When Cable withdrew in the middle
of the process due to personal circumstances, Rapelye remained to take the
position. According to Rose, although
"very

Swarthmore," she declined the offer,
choosing to remain at Wellesley for professional and personal reasons.
Even though Bock was not a finalist,
Rose said, he was "in the running all
along" and was a "top candidate beginning to end." The reason the search
committee went first to the other two
candidates, he said, was that they had

"a lot more experience than Jim, who
was ten years out of undergraduate college." The hiring committee "gave preference to those who had top leadership
under their belt."
As a Swarthmore alumnus, Bock
describes himself as "completely devoted" to his alma mater. After graduating
from Swarthmore in 1990, Bock worked
at Connecticut College as assistant
director of admissions until 1995, when
he left the to earn his masters degree at
the Darden School of Business at the
University of Virginia. After receiving
his
Bock
returned
degree,
to
Swarthmore to work in admissions.
In spite of the hectic hiring process,
"the admission process for 'O5 went
amazingly well," Bock said.
As dean of admissions and financial
aid, Bock hopes to achieve five goals, the
first of which is to increase the exposure
of the college. Bock understands that
Swarthmore is not yet a household
name and plans to work continuously to
increase exposure. He hopes to have
Swarthmore representatives tour with
representatives from big name schools
in order to reach a larger number of target high school students.
Secondly, Bock would like to
increase student involvement in the
admission process. "Our representatives don't travel to Wyoming because
we rarely get students from Wyoming,"
says Bock, "but if the one or two students that we do have from Wyoming
bring literature home with them, that
would increase exposure."
Bock also hopes to strengthen athletics by giving preferential treatment
in the form of 15 percent of admissions
spots to athletes. He plans to begin this
year with the class of 2005. Bock said he
wants athletes to "feel like they have a
chance at winning when they step onto
the playing field."
The tradition of reaching out to students of color is something Bock also
plans to continue. Ideally, he would like
the student body of Swarthmore to
reflect society "racially, geographically
and socioeconomically."
Finally, Bock wants to maintain the
academic mission of the college by
offering the "best liberal arts education
in the world" by ensuring that academics are not "lost in the shuffle."

Students and
staff organize
around police
relations
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Members of the college community who began
working to improve the relationship between police
and the campus in the spring said their present
interest was not in reacting to the report but in
ensuring that future police issues can be better

addressed.
"We're trying to create a process by which students can lodge their complaints and know their
rights," said Delonte Gholston 'O2, who is a member
of what he described as "an amalgam of concerned
students" working with college staff to address the
police issues. He added that the group's plans were
"manifold," including the implementation of police
sensitivity training and the formation of a permanent campus-borough-public safety committee.
Moriah Radin 'O2 said the group wanted to
"make whatever we do as
long-lasting as possi...

ble."
In his June 15 report, Chief Craig said he was
"excited about participating" in a joint training
program for Public Safety and the borough police to
raise awareness of cultural diversity. Presently,
Sharmaine LaMar, the equal opportunity officer at
the college, is investigating what type of training
would be appropriate, Gholston said. Craig is planning to set aside a day for training in the 2002 police
department schedule so that each officer may participate in an eight-hour session.
Maurice Eldridge, vice president of college and
community relations, said that in meetings in the
spring, the police and mayor spoke with the deans
about the formation of a committee to address
police issues and that they "acknowledge and want

Organization (SAO), the Swarthmore
Queer Union (SQU), the Hispanic
Organization for Latino Awareness
(HOLA), and the Native American
Student Association (NASA).
President Bloom, who helped in the
initial planning of the IC, and several
alumni and past IC staffers returned to
campus for the event and took part in a
panel in which they shared their experiences with the IC.

The panelists described the hard
work that brought about the IC in 1992
as the shared space for HOLA, SAO and
SQU. NASA became the fourth group to
share the space when students chartered it in the fall of 2000. They also dis-

cussed the continual problem the IC has
faced
the opposing visions of the IC
as both a safe haven for its members
and as a place of community to share

with the entire campus.
Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol, a member
of SQU for four years, spoke of a note-

book he and other members of SQU
found last year while cleaning their
group space in order to accommodate
this summer's renovations. The notebook, entitled "Journal of Homophobic
Incidents," was written by three gay

Swarthmore students in the late 1980s
and documented acts of discrimination
and prejudice the students encountered each day on the Swarthmore
campus. The notebook has been in the
college's archives at the Friends
Historical Library since its discovery.
"I realized my experience was very
different," Stewart-Winter said, "in the
fact that I never had to feel there was
no institutional mechanism" for dealing with discrimination.
The other panelists offered similar
sentiments, describing the IC as a
place where they learned both to celebrate their groups' common background and to respect and cherish the
diversity they found in the IC and the
Swarthmore campus.

it."

"Everybody is on board for that," Eldridge said.
Once the group formed, he said, it would follow
the same procedure as any other college committee,
with deans as the "focal point" of the group and students chosen by the appointments committee.
Students who met early this week proposed including on the committee representatives of cultural
support groups, fraternities, the Swarthmore Queer
Union and the Women's Resource Center.
The committee would make sure that "the rights
of students with respect to public safety are known
and that any violation of those rights can be
brought to the attention of the college administration in a very quick way," Gholston said.
Tim Sams, assistant dean and director of the
Black Cultural Center, described such a committee
as "proactive instead of reactive" and said that it
would allow for "ongoing discussions about the
relationship between the college and the police."

Swarthmore plans $230 million fundraising campaign
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
A giant white tent will soon be raised on Parrish Beach,
in order to host the kick-off dinner for a $230 million fundraising campaign on Saturday, Sept. 22. Entitled "The
Meaning of Swarthmore," the campaign's promoters hope
that it will be the largest fund-raiser in college history.
With plans to increase the annual fund and endowment
and to help pay for future construction projects, the benefits
of the campaign will be many. "If we are successful, it will
mean a lot to the campus community and to the programs
that distinguish Swarthmore from other schools," said Dan
West, vice president for alumni development and public
relations.
Over the past three years, the college administration
and the Board of Managers have been working to develop
the details of the campaign. "Distinctive needs of the
school became clear during the planning stages," said
Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president of the college and community relations.

In the end, the campaign's goals are divided into three
categories. Approximately $28.38 million will go toward
increasing the annual fund over the next five years.
According to the campaign guidelines, this will "support
all facets of Swarthmore's mission and provide for its most
pressing needs."

The school's endowment will receive $97.88 million
from the campaign. This money will go toward maintaining the honors program, need-blind admissions policies,
career services, faculty leaves and general campus
repairs. The endowment, explained West, is what makes
Swarthmore stand out. "It's very important to make sure
Swarthmore offers a wide array of opportunities," he said.
"The college's endowment makes possible these great programs."

Finally, almost $lO4 million will fund five construction
projects scheduled for the next several years. Fifty-nine
million dollars of this total will fund the science center
renovations. About half of that remaining total will go
toward the complete remodeling ofParrish's interior. "We

all know that our science buildings and Parrish Hall need
modernization," West said.
The remainder of the construction allocation will go
toward the building of the new dormitory, the expansion of
the Intercultural Center and the renovation of McCabe

Library.
The college will host a rally on Sept. 22 to begin the
campaign. That Saturday, alumni from around the country will convene at Swarthmore for a day of activities.
"The primary purpose of this day is to generate enthusiasm for the college and the campaign," said Tom

Krattenmaker, director of news and information.
The day's events include campus tours and an extensive program on "The Meaning of Swarthmore" in the
Lang Performing Arts Center. The launch culminates with
a dinner under the tent.

Orientation Week
drinking troubling
Fifty-one weeks a year, alcohol flows freely here at
Swarthmore.
But for Orientation Week, the college administration
asks that the campus be dry. Together with the administration, Campus Advisors (CA's) and members of
Orientation Committee (OC's) organize events to help
freshmen adjust to Swarthmore. They keep freshmen
busy with meetings, workshops, preliminary tests and
name-learning games
all dry activities.
The dry week is intended to ease freshmen into life at
Swarthmore. Making friends, figuring out schedules and
learning to live away from home are hard enough without the pressures, dangers and discomfort often associated with alcohol.
Thus it has been disturbing to note the widespread
drinking during Orientation Week this year. Despite the
dry designation, alcohol is almost always available on
campus during orientation, this year and every year.
Last week, however, was remarkable for the brazenness with which this restriction was snubbed. There was
drinking. And then there was heavy drinking.

the hospital and treated for alcohol poisoning.
The poisoning itself is only the unfortunate side effect
of a larger problem. Drinking was prevalent during orientation, not only in private spaces but also at several
social events.
In particular, OC members and CA's drank during at
least one public, college-sponsored freshman event.
Private drinking is one thing, but drinking at officially
dry events is another, and drinking at officially dry
events when you're supposed to be upholding the dry
policy is another thing altogether. If the upperclassmen
running orientation can't seem to stay away from alcohol for a week, why should freshmen even bother trying?

Alcohol has long been a contentious gray area in college policy, and when shaken with 385 excited freshmen
and stirred with quite a few all-too-knowledgeable
upperclassmen, you have a recipe for muddled messages. Yes, orientation is dry, but no, Public Safety
won't stop you from drinking in Wharton. No, you're
not allowed to drink, but yes, they will look the other
way if you do.

Campaign, welcome to another year at Swarthmore.
After a summer filled with research, conferences and
much thinking, we are energized and ready to continue
working toward just wages and workplace democracy
both on campus and beyond.
This semester will be a crucial one for the goal of a
living wage at Swarthmore. As many of you know, a committee charged with revamping the staff compensation
process at the college has been meeting since the spring
to review the college's philosophy and system of staff
compensation, and it is expected to solicit input on its
initial recommendations for improvements later this
semester.

As a campaign, we will be working to ensure that our
collective voice
and the voices of all members of the

college community, particularly staff members who will

gray area black and white. Orientation is dry, and, even
if the policy isn't strictly enforced, upperclassmen need

to have a minimal measure of respect for this fact. CA's
and OC members drinking at events for freshmen is simply not acceptable. The least that parents, administrators
and the freshmen can expect from upperclassmen who
volunteered to run orientation is the discipline to stay
dry for one week.
Next year, we hope the CA's and OC's can exercise
some restraint, and other upperclassmen will think a little harder about where, when and how they drink their
first week here. Drinking quietly in your room with
friends, OK; plopping an open keg in a Willets lounge,
not so OK.
In this year's application process, we hope that potential OC members and CA's will acknowledge to the
administration that a dry orientation is impossible. But
it is also their responsibility to refrain from making it
wetter.

It was the summer of the combo meal
DAN KOROBKIN
In Public
the summer months are
a bit slow in the world of political news, but this summer's top stories
were just plain weird. Think about it
since you took off for your Washington
internships and your California road
trips, three "important" things have
happened: Vieques, Gary Condit and
stem cells.
What are we to make of this bizarre
triad of cnn.com's? As Barlett and Steele
might say, "America: What Went Wrong?"
On the surface, it is true these three
news items have nothing to do with each
other. They are not particularly atypical,
and they certainly aren't the newsstand
blockbusters of the century. But they do
tell us a little something about just how
wacky things were in Washington and with
the media this summer.
Vieques, Gary Condit and stem cells are
what I like to call the combo meals of journalism. They're stories that combine so
many little elements from America's goodie-bag that Americans can't help but bite.
Let's start with the Gary ConditChandra Levy story. Here we have a
Congressman who had a "close relationship" with a 24-year-old female Washington
intern from his district, which is not so
unusuaf except that Condit's "friend" hasn't been seen since April.
Why does this otherwise ho-hum missing-person story show up on the news

I know

every night? Because this is missing person PLUS. It's plus sex, plus politician,
plus power, and plus Monica. The Chandra
Levy affair has been super-sized. It's
"Combo Meal No. L"
All right, now stem cells. These little
buggers have been around for a few years,

but never before has something from a
petri dish brought banner headlines to the
front page of The New York Times.

Scientists told President Bush that embryonic stem cells might cure Alzheimer's, but
the Pope said that conducting experimenting on stem cells "devalue and violate
human life." Now, wait a minute, said the
Bush team. This isn't just the religious
right. It's the religious right PLUS! Plus
medical breakthroughs, plus bioethics,
plus the President's chance to quote
Aldous Huxley on TV and say he's overcome a moral dilemma.
Not only that, the American public
got even more excited when it started
confusing the stem cell mess with that
crazy doctor who's threatened to clone
humans. "I strongly oppose cloning,"
President Bush felt the need to point out
in what was supposed to be an address to
the nation about stem cells. And when
Senator Daschle announced that the
Senate might vote to fund stem cell
research even if the President didn't
want to, a reporter asked him if that
measure would be part of Congress' anticloning bill. That is to say, "Do you want
fries with that?" That's "Combo Meal No.

2."

Finally, there's Vieques, the early headline grabber of the summer. The Air Force
is dropping lots of bombs on Puerto Rico
for target practice, and even though some
Vieques locals themselves get blown to bits
every so often, the Air Force likes this particular test site and would rather not leave.
Bombs are not so special. But, if you bring
in the politics and protests, we've got

bombs PLUS. Plus a minority population.
Plus "taxation without representation."
Plus Al Sharpton gets arrested protesting
and sent to jail for 90 days. Plus Robert
Kennedy Jr. gets arrested too. That's
"Combo Meal No. 3."
The combo meals, I think, are a boon for
the news media. There are so many 24-hour
news channels these days that they need
something to talk about all day. And why
repeat the same story all day if you can discuss the seven virtues of one lousy event?
So it's Gary Condit, the Monica syndrome.
Or it's Vieques, the Al Sharpton story. Or
stem cells, and how's Dolly the cloned
sheep doing these days?

Melanie Maksin For The Phoenix

If you're beginning to notice things getting out of hand, you're not alone.

These combo meal news stories are a lot
like real combo meals at McDonald's and
Burger King: you feel sort of crappy just
ordering them. You know you should be
getting some real food from a real restaurant, but you're not. The pimple-faced
teenager behind the counter"says, "Can I
super-size that?" and suddenly well, forget stem cells, this is what's demeaning to

These news events, after all, should

Orientation organizers deserve praise
Dear Editor:
The job undertaken by the Orientation
Committee is difficult to do well. The OC's
responsibilities are vast: picking up frosh
from the airport, training 60 Campus
Advisers to lead orientation groups, and
coordinating multiple events every day
that both instruct and entertain 400 incoming Swatties.
I am impressed with the OC's dedication to its job and still more impressed

with the results of its hard work.
Most of us upperclassmen did not get to
observe the 16-hour days that the OC
members put in as the arrival of the frosh
approached, and I think it fair that they
get due recognition.
By my count, there were about 75 orientation events.
The OC had to coordinate a schedule
that would allow for maximum flexibility
so incoming students would not have to
choose between entertaining activities and
information sessions.
The schedule allowed students to par-

ticipate in orientation activities at their

own pace.
I did not hear a single complaint that
there were too many mandatory events or
not enough fun ones. The needs of the

frosh were well met.
The ice cream social on the first night
was a blast.
The dorms got together for the first
time and frosh got to meet their peers,
socialize, and break the ice.
The "Being a Vegetarian" tutorial was
much appreciated by students on my hall,
a nice touch to help vegetarians adjust to
dining hall cuisine.
The Paces Cafe event was spectacularly
pulled off. OC members were baking all
day to serve desserts to all 400 frosh.
The Coffee House was packed; the
Women's Resource Center has never seen
so many people.
Both the 80s party and "The Dance"
were hits with frosh on my hall. They
danced and chilled and talked of how
much fun college parties would be, enthu-

siastic about the possibilities of the college
social scene.
The frosh I talked with were entertained and happily surprised that meeting
people and making friends could be so

about Gary Condit the same way I felt
when "I Still Know What You Did Last

a really bad sequel to a really bad movie,
that its very existence is, well, kind of
insulting to human dignity.
But, dammit, a lot of people went to see

While the adjustment to college life is
rife with challenges and anxiety, a good

As a Willets Residential Assisstant, I
have had the opportunity to talk with
many first-years about their time here so

I applaud the OC for the hundreds of

value. Some of the reactions to the workshop ranged

faith in our abilities, as well as the
knowledge that we will need help to
hone these skills.
At First Collection, I was pleased
to discover that Swat had faith in my
ability to act as a mature and responsible individual.
Just think: 380 students, 380 lit
candles, 380 copies of "Alma Mater"

and one large forest.

No, this year Supermen and

Until I conquer one of the

head thumping against a table, emitting a muffled cry for help.

I just tell myself, as I tell my
friends, that, having survived orientation, and with help from the

same academically for the next four

Hold high
expectations

for bad habits
BY DAVID HAENDLER
Hello, and welcome. Ordinarily, this column space will
be used for the promotion of my right-wing political
views, which economics professor Mark Kuperberg once
branded as "Wall Street Journal crypto-conservatism."
I'm not sure what makes crypto-conservatism different
from regular conservatism, but it sounds a lot cooler and
I intend to wear the title as a badge of honor. However,
this week's column will not be given over to the cruel
denunciations of globalization protestors, which are my
typical fare.
Instead, I wish to offer a few words of guidance to the
gentlemen and ladies of the class of 2005.
To begin, accept that you will develop bad habits while
you are at Swarthmore. Cherish them. In addition to
being loads of fun, they are a more valuable learning
experience than anything else found in the liberal arts
curriculum.
You only have four years to enjoy the safe, sheltered
groves of academia (more if you intend to go to grad
school) before you are hurled into the dreaded real world
and must start giving more thought to the consequences
of your actions.
Whether your particular vice is drinking, fast women
and/or men, taking the Lord's name in vain, or whatever
else floats your boat, my advice is to savor wickedness
and self-destructive behavior while you still can.
Despite what you have read in the brochures,
Swarthmore was actually not built on Quaker heritage. It
was built on an Indian graveyard.
Read for pleasure on a regular basis. Sometimes it's a
real temptation to say "All right, I've just finished going
over 300 pages of assigned readings! I'm done with the
printed word for at least the rest of the week!" This is a
mistake. People who don't occasionally take breaks from
Michel Foucault to read a comic book go nuts.
A lot ofSwarthmore students seem to think that meals

should consist of Al Bloom serving them lobsters and
champagne on a silver platter. If those are your expectations for institutional food, then I'm sorry to inform you
that you're going to be disappointed. Sharpies does not
offer the perfect dining experience, but it gets far more

criticism than it deserves.
Have you seen those T-Shirts that say Anywhere Else
It Would Have Been An A'? A more honest garment might
say something along the lines of 'My Work Ethic Is
Faulty!' There's a lot of self-congratulatory talk about
how Swatties all work much harder than any other college students on the planet.
If this is true and perhaps it is then the only conclusion that I can draw is that students at other colleges
spend most of their time drinking daiquiris and playing
on bongo drums. Although your experience may vary
from mine depending on what courses you take, I have
not found the workload to be anywhere near as bad as
...

...

people allege.
If you study diligently, set yourself a reasonable work
schedule and have enough brainpower to outwit the average Yalie, you can get good grades here.
All of the people who post on the Daily Jolt message
boards are deranged. Every last one of them.
Write home on at least a semi-regular basis. Your parents are paying a princely sum for you to attend this liberal arts wonderland. It's the least you can do to keep
them happy. For those of you who cannot be swayed by
appeals to filial piety, keep this in mind: parents are the
source of money and care packages. Pleasing your family
is the right thing to do whether you are moral or just self-

interested.
Over the next few weeks, months and years, you will
hear bitter upperclassmen complaining a lot about this
place. Do not listen to their ignorant guff. This place is
loaded with interesting people and great professors.
If you put just a little bit of time and effort into seeking out opportunity, you should be ceaselessly entertained. I know that I am.

OPINIONS

A large paper trail
meanders through a
compulsive society
BY ALEX EDLESON
You should feel special. Swarthmore College chopped
down half the trees in a small forest to get you here. Did
anyone else notice how much paper was involved in the
application process? I could easily go on to make some
conclusion concerning the environmental impact of these
observations, but I'll leave that to the squirrels.
What disturbs me are the bureaucratic and social
implications of the mountains of paper involved in
admissions.
This isn't the first time I've applied to college. I transferred to Swarthmore after a year at a London university, so I'm somewhat of a pro when it comes to the admissions process. Swarthmore required a staggering quantity of paper, about ten times more than did the "London

Audrey Chan Phoenix

Demand the impossible: speak about the unspoken
BY BRANDON SILVERMAN
Before the majority of the school got here, I spent an
evening with about two dozen RAs in an activity related
to RA training. The moderator asked all of us to write
down something that we are not allowed to talk about at
Swarthmore, something taboo and unspoken. I thought
for a while and wrote down "oppressive tolerance." I
think what I really meant was "oppressive liberalness,"
a topic that is more often than not joked about but rarely
discussed with the seriousness I think it warrants.
Intellectual exploration, outside the realm of the
classroom, is supposedly one of the strongest aspects of
this institution. But to what degree do we really do that?

And if we do, how open are we with each other? Two
years ago, a Harvard student wrote in his school newspaper that the liberal arts schools across the country
"win" (especially Swarthmore), because we are the
schools that actually engage in the late-night, intellectual discussions that everyone looks for when choosing a
college. Were we too happy about whathe was writing to
ask whether or not he was right?
At Swarthmore, I don't think discussions of race, sexuality, culture and diversity are as common as we think.
In fact, we have cultivated a dangerous environment
that preaches tolerance and diversity but exist in a
realm of hypersensitivity. Our differences tug at our
sense of comfort and security, and in response, we
choose the worst course of action: expecting everyone to
be perfect and act perfectly. In doing so, we stifle any
opportunities to take advantage of our diversity by generating an atmosphere where the worst offense is saying
something that could be construed as ignorant, prejudiced, racist, sexist or bigoted. We demand and expect a
language and system of political correctness that no one
has or even could have. The result is a deafening silence.
When the vandalism in the Intercultural Center
occurred my freshman year, the response made me realize how complicated issues surrounding diversity and
freedom of speech were. There is no easy answer.
However, I do not think that the environment we have
been living in is progressing in the appropriate direction. In fact, I think our attitudes are manifesting serious negative consequences that deserve some serious
attention. I believe we are actually promoting cultural
insensitivity and encouraging prejudices, because the
only place anyone feels comfortable speaking their mind
is in small, intimate groups of like-minded individuals.
Our politically correct environment is silencing the conversations that may result in enormous positive cultural exchange. Fear has become
the most important ingredient in our diversity.
What is the alternative we should strive for? It is not

complete and uncensored honesty glossed over with
labels of freedom of speech. That could easily be much
worse. However, I think we have to begin moving slowly
in that direction because we are so far on the opposite
end of the spectrum. We have to trust that we are smart
enough and educated enough to discover a language of
respect and sensitivity somewhere between our current
atmosphere and one of unbridled preachiness.
Retreating from the cold comfort of our current intellectual lull means having faith in each other. More importantly, we can all take a step towards using our communal diversity is altering the expectations we have of one
another. An over-commitment to language and sensitivity has done too much harm to our campus. We have to
begin allowing each other to say the wrong things and
sometimes, the really wrong things. Our goal should be
to encourage responsible honesty even if it hurts sometimes, which it will. Our prejudices must be given a
chance to surface if we are going to challenge them.
Imagine, if you will, a world where you were completely sure that no one was going to be offended, hurt
or insulted by anything you said. Imagine the degree of
growth and discovery that would take place. It would be
like lifting the bell tower off of your intellectual shoulders. Granted, we will never reach that point, but the
idea is that we should aim for an environment where, at
the very least, people feel comfortable asking questions

rather than an environment where individuals are
forced to foster and strengthen their ignorance in private because they are too afraid to challenge them in
public. It is no easy task. We have to sacrifice a great
deal of our pride and humility. In response, however, we
are going to get an accurate picture of our own biases
and those of people around us. Furthermore, who knows
to what degree such an understanding would play in
learning from each other and ultimately, ridding ourselves of those means of thought we never voluntarily
chose to have in the first place. It is the fundamental to
the act of becoming your own individual.
John Stuart Mill once said that "no one can be a
great thinker who does not recognize that as a thinker

it is his first duty to follow his intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead." Follow your intellect, speak your
mind, but only if you are willing to allow other people to
do the same. None of us is perfect, and we have all
offended someone else at one point or another. If we genuinely desire positive intellectual exchange through our
diversity, we need to lift the blanket of fear that has
silenced our campus. We need to give each other the
opportunity to fumble around, say the incorrect things,
and learn as a result of it. The most politically correct
thing you can possibly do is admit your own imperfections, and then you won't demand it ofother people.

University.
I used five pieces of paper to apply to six universities
through the British University and Colleges Admissions
Service, and then
I swear to you
it only took about
50 pieces of paper to get me rolling in London.
In coming here, I was inundated by all kinds of creative booklets presenting imaginative ways to insure my
ass (and in several cases I received the booklet more than
once)!

I can't even count the number of times I signed myself

to the college. I felt all too violated when I found myself
signing consent to an excessive third medical insurance
plan. I have even been led to believe that the swim test is
merely a way for the college to gather evidence in order
to disavow any. responsibility if someone is found
drowned with their head in a puddle.
But my cynicism runs away with me. I believe, in any
case, that all this wasted paper is not so much a fault of
the college's but rather an indicator ofAmerican society.
All of higher education under Britain's socialism is
public, so it is not as heavily subject as Swarthmore is to
the whims of the economy. Indeed, this institution must
protect itself from factors far beyond its control.
Swarthmore's main threats, however, come from the
potential pitfalls of a compulsive society.
Though some of us pay a bankload of cash to go here,
each and every one of us is a walking lawsuit waiting to
happen. In other words, we, the constituents of the college, are a threat to it. I assure you this anal retentiveness about protection in the face of potential incidences
is purely a U.S. phenomenon.
No other culture uses the phrase "So sue me!" as often
as this country does. In England, you just beat up the person who's complaining or otherwise come to some kind of
civilized agreement over tea (or just side along the soccer
team they support) to solve problems.
In Indonesia, where I grew up, corrupt judicials are
very rarely even brought to a court of law. The little incidences the college has to protect itself from seem petty
compared to what needs to be dealt with over there.
We might, however, view the situation in this country
as a sign of a healthy economic and judicial system and
that we have nothing better to do but squeeze cash out of
petty violations of the law
or it could be just mass neurosis. In less fortunate countries of a decrepit judicial
system, one is responsible before the eyes of God. In this
country, I feel as though the law has become so powerful
that it has assumed the role of a god as some kind of
abstract entity in the mind of all its citizens.
I am sorry that our college education must be groped
by the fastidious fingers of law and economy, but I do not
blame Swarthmore. I am pleased to find thus far that,
between you and me (and trusty Public Safety), we have
created an environment within the college that seems to
have reinstated the human element in maintaining
peace, even if it is behind a fierce facade of papers.

Steele-ing home
Three-time transfer Matt Steele on Division IA football,

at Butler University and Temple University, but came back to Swarthmore

BY CARLA GREENBERG
"Transfer" seems to be one of the buzzwords at
Swarthmore this semester. Last year's football cut contributed both to the transfer of 15 football players away
from Swat and to the unprecedented number of students transferring into the college this year. In addition, we have our own transfer anomaly: Matt Steele
'O3, who transferred out of Swarthmore one year ago,

...

'Ghost World': More
human than human
Finally, a film about unrepentant dorks. "Ghost World,"
the story of two disaffected high schoolers utterly unable to
bear their mainstream classmates, should strike a chord with
everyone who has felt alienated by bland, brand-name
America. It's smart, dark and sarcastic, yet at heart, it's as
squishy-soft as a beanbag chair.
Scarlett Johanssen and Thora Birch play, respectively,
Rebecca, a bored, low-voiced blonde, and Enid, a curvy, disdainful Indie chick with thick-rimmed glasses and unconventional taste in clothes. As their names suggest, Rebecca could
pass for normal, but nothing she sees can tempt her to abandon her scorn for the mainstream. Enid, however, is even further removed. Boys don't give her the opportunity to reject
them not that, according to her, she cares.
Or maybe she does. Underneath her layers of dismissive
cynicism, Enid wants to meet someone. She's not a misanthrope, she's just not drawn to the typical male. Her fantasy
man would have to be older and wiser/with a perspective on
life and sense of humor similar to her own. Still, that desire
is hidden deep below the surface. It's by no means the focus of
either the film or Enid's life.
Both girls have decided against college in favor of moving
into an apartment together. Enid's single father, a sad-faced
pushover, is willing to let her do what she thinks is best. The
only obstacle to beginning their new life as independent
adults is an art class that Enid must retake in order to graduate. Her teacher, a skinny new-ager who speaks in PC
cliches, sets Enid's teeth on edge.
Fortunately, Enid meets a man of the same breed, an awkward music aficionado portrayed by Steve Buscemi. She and
Rebecca play a sadistic trick on him, thinking he's simply
another loser. Rebecca shrugs it off, but Enid's curiosity and
guilt for having kicked this perpetually down guy propel her
to meet him formally.
While Rebecca works as a barista at a yuppie coffee shop,
spends her

is a warm, caring environment in terms of faculty and
administration. I decided to come back here in spite of
not being able to play football, because I acknowledge
that there are things more important than football.

Buscemi is as believable as always, both charmed by and
wary of Enid's insistent interest in him.
One particularly refreshing detail is that neither Enid nor
Rebecca has the typical adolescent girl obsessions. They don't

about their faults. They aren't fountains of confidence, but
they trust their own judgment and intelligence. Janeane

could be Enid's long-lost older sister, but Enid could teach her
a thing or two.
Terry Zwigoff adapted this film from a comic book, and he
seems to have taken the punchy dialogue and Enid's colorful
wardrobe straight off the page. Toward the end, the film differs from the comic. With the introduction of the conflict and
its resolution, the film loses much of its credibility. The slip
is particularly disappointing because until then, "Ghost
World" is a straightforward, touching look at how alternative
kids make it through late adolescence. Flawed as it is, the film
remains engaging.
This story isn't normal life via Hollywood. It might not be
life, exactly, but it is a lot closer than most movies come. As a
consequence, you relate to the characters, you really care
about them, and you want to bring them to campus, because,
if nothing else, they would find solidarity and sympathy here.

L'art de la conversation Shins shake
On dating, the British Empire and earplugs: a remedy for Swatties everywhere
BY JOEY SPADOLA
As a general rule, conversation is
a pleasurable and engaging activity
which at once enriches the understanding and strengthens that ethereal bond which can exist between two
sympathetic and affectionate human
souls. Every so often, however, we
find ourselves on Delta flight 132
whose estimated duration is seven
hours
seated next to a loud, talkaoverweight
tive,
fellow from
Bullwhip, Arkansas who has such a
bad case of halitosis that the paint on
the frames of your glasses is completely melted off before you even
leave the runway, and whose sole
topic of discourse (which nonetheless
he can sustain for a much greater
space of time than you can hide in the
bathroom) is that gun control should
consist of using two hands.
That is, at times we find ourselves
unwillingly thrown, as if by the hand
of a revengeful deity, into a particular
conversational situation which is so
abhorrent that we would gladly agree
to watch every existing episode of the
Oprah Winfrey show if it could afford
us the minutest chance of escaping.
The bane of all conversation is
Awkward Silence.
Analogously
speaking, Awkward Silence is to conversation what Gary Condit is to
young female interns: that is, it has
never been anything more than just
friends with them.
No, wait. I mean, it puts an end to
them.
We have all witnessed (though of
course we ourselves have never experienced) the anguish of the young
couple out on a first date, seated
across from one another at a restaurant, tensely wriggling in their chairs
in an attempt to think up some
damned thing to say, until at length
one of them (invariably the guy) takes
heart and stammers out something
which, although it may smack slightly of heavy-handedness, is nonetheless almost always a tactful and
romantic attempt:
GUY: So Jenny these are nice
table cloths they have here.
they're just place
GIRL: Um
mats made from recycled paper. And
my name is Rachel.
The remedy to conversations
stalled by Silence is this: never be
unwilling to make things up.
Whereas what actually happens to
you in an ordinary day is not likely to
produce much material for talk, the
imagination is limitless. And I know
all of you are equal to the task of fabricating a few details here or there,
because you have all filled out college

BY JOEL BLECHER
It was summertime, the living was easy, and the
music was full of ups and downs. Scottish lads and
lassies prattled on excitedly about Belle and
Sebastian's latest litter, while the teenage American
middle-class sat disappointed with Ben Folds' too
appropriate new album title choice, "Rockin' the
Suburbs." And while J. Lo made alternateens everywhere mourn the shifting focus of MTV towards soft
porn after 25 years, progrockers were pleased that
Radiohead's world tour brought the cutting edge to
boys and girls around the globe. Those searching for
the best new talent, however, had only to peek into the
world of Indie-rock: The Shins, a kick-ass band from
New Mexico, brimming with promise, released their
debut album, "Oh, Inverted World" on Subpop Records.
Technically, The Shins have been a legitimate band
for almost ten years, putting out records under the
name Flake, or Flake Music. As they had with Flake
Music, James Mercer's polished Sting-like vocals sang
abstruse poetry accompanied by wholesome guitar
chords, leading bandmates Marty Crandall, Neal
Langford and Jesse Sandoval to the edge of their rocking capacity. It's clear within the first moments of the
album: the band is tight, and the boys have got talent.
A wall of sound fills the speakers, and delicious rock
n'roll sound comes pouring out. Although they taste a
little like their Subpop cousins, The Beachwood
Sparks, their flavor is distinctively more complex.
In the album's first track, "Caring is Creepy," it
immediately becomes clear that the band's most
notable strength and maturity is in the songs' lyrics.
"It's a luscious mix of words and tricks," sings Mercer,
"that let us bet when we know we should fold." The

applications.

Just think back to the "Personal
Experience essay" you wrote for

Swarthmore.
The typical such essay reads as follows:
"The day of June 6, 1993 shall be
forever impressed upon my memory.
I had just finished playing Schubert's
'String Quartet in B minor' on both
the viola and cello, so that my fingers
were weary; and my voice, having
been used to excess the previous day

Ancient Hindu Art in 13 volumes.
Upon taking the volumes into my
hands, I was thrown into such a
transport of excitement that I
swooned and, unconscious on the
ground, began to recite Wordsworth's
Tintern Abbey'..."
If you could simply put this ability
to use in any stale conversation, you
would be able to hold forth for hours
on any topic at all.
But even before making things up,
the cardinal rule of conversation is
that political correctness must be
thrown right out the window. If you
attempt to be PC, you will never get

any further than the weather. In
mixed company, a good religious jibe

or ethnic plaisanterie can really get
things going. My father never tires of
telling about the time several years
ago he was eating dinner with a
group of conservative, prudish
Englishman, and decided to infuse a
little animation into the gathering.

"You know,"

he said, "when

England was part of an empire, she

had an emperor as a ruler; when she
was a kingdom, she had a king; but
now that she's a country (and here,
for effect, he paused slightly, amidst
gasps of shock), you guys have
Maggie Thatcher."
Now, you may be inclined to ask
whether this got the conversation
rolling, the answer to which is, to noone's surprise, of course not, chiefly
because it is difficult to continue a
conversation when you are standing
outside in he middle of the street and
the rest of your interlocutors are
inside eating dinner. However, I cannot express adequately to you how
many subsequent torturously slow
conversations at family gatherings
and the like have been moved along
by my father relating this very story.
So, I urge you all now to go forth
and converse with your Fellow Man.
Only be sure, on planes, to bring

The chords mirror the mixed

lines couldn't describe the band's pessimistic optimism
any better; while the lyrics often describe pain and
cynicism in a cryptic poetry, playfulness usually finds
a way to pull through. The chords mirror the mixed
feelings, often shifting more ground between major
and minor keys than contemporary rock convention
permits. "One by One All Day," the following track,
begins bouncing in the majors singing about playing in
streams with snails and the nostalgic smell of engine
grease. As the song closes, it inverts to a minor key as
Mercer cries, "Oh, Inverted World, if every moment of
our lives were cradled softly in the hands of some
strange and gentle child, I'd not roll my eyes so."
There's no shortage of rolling eyes on this record, and
most of it has to do with Mercer's Rilkean anxieties of
having an adult consciousness. "[We] make haste with
ideas that can't help but creep good people out," he
sings in "Pressed in a Book," ".... I know when you
hear these sappy lines you'll roll your eyes and say
"nice try'."
The record's thirty three short minutes are more
than worth its price; "Oh, Inverted World" is a record
no one will regret buying. Although The Shins may not
be on the next level of rock n'roll, they've shown that
they certainly have what it takes to be big, if they're
given enough time. As even James Mercer concedes in
the final lines of "The Weird Divide,"
'teven time can
do good things to you."
The Shins open for Modest Mouse in Philadelphia
on Sept. 30 at the Trocadero. Their album "Oh,
Inverted World" is sold at finer record stores everywhere.

Property in storage damaged, stolen
In addition, Larry Schall, vice president
of facilities, noted that several summer

BY ZAC STEELE
The loss and damage of property stored
in school facilities over the summer has
left some students frustrated with the storage and security precautions taken by the
college. Damage ranged from mildewed
boxes stored in Parrish basement and a
trailer behind Mertz to the theft of over
$2,000 worth of personal goods.
Students with lost or damaged property
have blamed the influx of construction
workers and lax security procedures as the

probable culprits.

Christine Hancock 'O2, whose belongings were stolen from Wharton storage last
summer, endured the same problem this
summer, when she lost three boxes of personal material that she had stored in the
Mertz basement before going abroad last

semester. The boxes were subsequently
moved to the trailer behind Mertz, where,

Hancock said, she found the trailer open
"three days in a row" upon returning to
campus for the athletic pre-season. She said
that she reported the situation to officials in
the Public Safety office, who did not appear
to know about the breach of security.
Scott Kushner 'O2 lost a computer, textbooks, bedding and clothing from the same
location. Both Hancock and Kushner cited
the large numbers of construction workers
on campus over the summer as a potential
danger to unprotected storage.

storms flooded basement storage areas,
damaging the contents of an unknown
number of boxes. He states that the college
made every effort to save these boxes, taking "stuff out and putting it on crates."

The Swarthmore Student Handbook is

explicit on the issue of storage, stating that
"regular storage is provided in every residence hall [typically including] bedding,

books, and bulletin boards
There is no
access to these storage areas during winter
and summer breaks."
Although the handbook suggests that
these areas are secure, it designates
Roberts' limited-access, locked storage as
the only "secure" storage on campus. The
handbook also states that the college is not
responsible for "insuring student belongings." Students with lost or damaged property, therefore, receive no reimbursement
from the college. Despite these rules, both
students and staff recognize that there is a
storage problem. Assistant Dean- and
Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
said that "students bring too much stuff to
store in the amount of space available.
"The college doesn't have the resources
to do more than they are about storage,"
Westphal said. "If more is done, then there
would most likely be an increase in the
room rates to cover the costs and there is
concern to contain costs."
...

From ALCOHOL, pg. 3
"I think the freshman class is pretty

experienced
with
their booze,"
DeCrescenzo said. He believes that the
alcohol available might have even help
the first-years bond. "I think it helped
the freshmen class come together socially," he said. "When people would be
drunk, you could help them out."
As far as RAs and CAs drinking,
DeCrescenzo said, "I don't think anyone
stopped their drinking habits."
Rob Melick 'O4, a CA, said he never
saw anyone drinking. The dry campus
rule, however, was only working "for
the most part," he said.
Many freshmen heard about older
students having alcohol available. "I
heard that upperclassmen were having
keg parties," Ethan Sherrard 'O5 said.
Salvatore agreed. "There were definitely parties in Worth at which alcohol was
available," she said.
"I'm not sure about the plan for next
year," Goundie said. "We're talking to
CAs and the Orientation Committee and
asking, 'ls this a problem we need to
address?'
Goundie said that a contract that
CAs might sign in the future, barring
them from drinking during the week,
"is not a bad idea." He pointed out that
RAs "sign off as an agent of the college,"
and promise to follow all the rules. "It
really shouldn't be that difficult," he
"

said.

Both Schall and Redgrave emphasized that there is no upward trend in
reported campus crimes.
The safety improvements made over
the summer followed student council's
discussion of safety issues meetings
between the council and the administration during the spring semester.
Council members seem pleased with
the administration's sensitivity to
their concerns. Lauren Tobias 'O2,
council co-president, said it is "clear
Owen [Redgrave] is trying to do his job
and wants campus to be as safe as possible."
Both Tobias and Redgrave said that
the council and Public Safety plan to
continue to work together, particularly
on identifying areas of campus that still
need call boxes or better lighting.
Tobias said the council also plans to
discuss other ideas on improving safety,
including safety whistles, which "the
community would understand as a cry
for help."
Jesse Taylor 'O3, a resident assistant
in Mary Lyon, pointed out that the
Swarthmore campus is "generally safer
at night than places where people usually come from."
Andy Wong 'O2 also expressed satisfaction with the level of campus safety,
particularly in light of the recent
improvements. "The administration has
been as responsive as they could," he
said. "Now it's up to students to pick up
the slack."
Redgrave stressed the importance of
locking doors and reporting suspicious
activity as key features in making the
campus an unattractive place for criminals.
He said he believed there was still
room for improved safety programs
and communication between public
safety
and the student body.
"Obviously," he said, "one crime is one
crime too many."

Large incoming class
makes space tight
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Hardly the largest class ever, but still
class of 2005 arrived at
Swarthmore last week. Officially, the
class is made up of 385 students, though
quite sizable, the

Director of Admissions Jim Bock said
that some students may have decided
not to come after that number was
recorded. In addition to the first-years,
an unusually large group of 20 transfer
students arrived as well.
"What happened this year is that we
experienced very little melt," Bock
said, referring to the common term for
students who enroll at a college, then
never show up for one reason or another. This causes admissions offices to
admit more students than needed to
meet their enrollment targets, opening
the possibility that more students than
expected will enroll.

Bock said it would have been a significant problem if 30 or so more students
than expected had decided to come. But
as long as the housing office can find
beds for everyone, he said, having such a
high yield is considered a good thing in
the admissions office. The overall yield
increased slightly to 42 percent this year.
"I don't think 20 transfers broke the
bank this year," Bock said. Yet even a
small handful of unanticipated students can create a space crunch on a
small campus.
When students first arrived this year,
only one bed was available anywhere on
campus. A bit of shifting around since
then has left two spaces open, but it was
a tight year for housing, according to
Dean of Housing Myrt Westphal. Several
lounges in Dana, Hallowell and Willets

were coverted into rooms.

Despite that, Westphal said this year

was nowhere near as difficult as the
year the class 2000 was admitted. That
incoming class had around 420 members, and the class of then-seniors was
also very large.
The result was that the college had to
rent out some rooms for students in the
Strath Haven Condominiums. The
Danawell trailer dates from that year,
when it was installed to provide some
common space for students living in
loungeless dorms.

As usual when space is tight, sopho-

mores suffer many of the consequences. Westphal said she was unable
to respond to the room change requests
of most rising sophomores. Most jun-

iors, however, had their requests met.

From FUNDRAISING, pg. 7
During the dinner, President Al
Bloom will introduce the campaign.
Brief speeches from J. "Lawrence
Shane '56, the board of managers
chair, and the campaign co-chairs will
follow. The dinner will end with a
screening of a video, "The Meaning of
Swarthmore," which will feature students and alumni participating in a
round table discussion about the
school and its attributes.
"The launch," said Director of
Development John Malcolm, "will be a
way to draw together early donors to
the campaign, future donors, and members of the Swarthmore community to
celebrate the public phase of the most
ambitious campaign in Swarthmore's
history."

FIELD HOCKEY
The Garnet field hockey team opened their season with a game against Widener University on
Saturday, Sept. 1 Though originally scheduled to be a home game, the match was played at
Widener because of Swarthmore's field problems.
Much improved from last year, the Widener team was a good test for the Tide. However the
Garnet girls prevailed for the 1-0 win.
The game remained scoreless throughout the first half, despite Swarthmore's 11 shots to
Widner's two. Both teams came out of the intermission hungry, but it was Meg Woodworth's 'O3
pass across the goal that put Kim Cariello in position to get the Garnet on the board.
Despite Swarthmore's domination of the game, Widener surged late in the second half with 12
shots to Swat's 14. Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 preserved the shutout with 10 saves and the help of a
strong defensive effort by tri-captain Katie Tarr 'O2, Katie Cloonan 'O3, Heather Doyle 'O3 and tricaptain Carly Hammond 'O2. Hammond said, "The Widener game was a good place to start because
we need to see what we were working with and where we're starting from."
With the solid win under their belts, the field hockey team will host #4 Rowan University this
afternoon on the "Parking Meter Field" by the softball field. The team's traditional Cunningham
game field is not quite ready for the squad, but they are adapting to the situation and the team welcomes the challenges that the temporary home poses. Of the challenge of facing the #4 team in
Division 111, Hamond said, "The Rowan is just a great game to play because we have nothing to lose
and they have everything to lose. Knocking them down would set us up nicely for the rest of the
season. We'll see what we're made of."

Phillies contend
for NL East title
BY TAKI MICHAELIDIS
For once, the baseball gods are smiling upon the Philadelphia
Phillies or perhaps they're smirking. After two decades of postseason futility, after an embarrassing 97-loss season and after last
year's managerial shake-up, the perennial bottom feeding Phillies
are in playoff contention.
Led by the resurgence of Scott Rolen and unlikely heroes Jose
Mesa, Travis Lee, Bruce Chen and Omar Daal, the team surged
through April and May with a 35-18 record. Presently, they sit merely two games behind the division-leading Atlanta Braves in the
National League East with 25 games left to play in the regular season. For the first time in recent memory, the Phillies are playing in
games that matter.
A year ago today, the Phillies were in the midst of what eventually would become an NL East train wreck. Phillies pitchers finished the year with a 4.77 ERA, 11th in the National League.
Simultaneously.the hitters failed to carry their weight, scoring a
meager 708 runs, the worst in all ofbaseball.
The Phillies' off-season did little to allay fears of another dismal year. The front office traded away perennial-All-Star Curt
Schilling for, at best, a few mediocre prospects. Rookie third baseman-sensation Scott Rolen returned from an injury-plagued season, and the managerial offseason rebuilding strategy seemed contradictory, as manager Ed Wade overpaid for relievers Jose Mesa
and Real Cormier. After such a horrendous season, the postseason
seemed a wild fantasy rather than a plausible reality but a reality it is.
However, even as the Phillies sit just two games out of first
place, they hold the unenviable honor of having the worst record of

Even as the Phillies sit just two games

honor of having the worst record of the
NL wild card contenders.
the NL wild card contenders. Indeed, since their fantastic spring,
the boys in red have struggled, going 37-47 since early June, and
dropping seven of their past 10 games.
Indeed, the fact that they trail the Braves by just two games is
due as much to the epic struggles of the Atlanta Braves as it is to
their own sound playing. By dropping six of theirpast 10 games, the
Braves have been unable to capitalize on the many chances to
extend their lead. With the National League wild card most likely
coming out of the stronger NL West or NL Central, the Phillies will
have to outplay their division rivals for a shot at the postseason.
Whether the Phillies make the playoffs or not, fans can sit content with the knowledge that the Phillies' recent swell of young talent on the roster and in the high minor leagues has left this team
looking formidable for the near future. Brandon Duckworth, David
Coggin and Nelson Figueroa are all under 26 years of age and form
a trio ofrookie starters who have combined for a 3.39 ERA and a 107 record in limited action. Scott Rolen and Bobby Abreu, the offensive leaders of the Phillies are only 26 and 27 years old respectively

Women's volleyball coach Chang Han coached the
team last season.

Volleyball loses
another coach
BY ANNA MASILELA
Chang Han, head coach of the women's volleyball team last year, resigned over the summer
because of a National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) recruiting rules conflict.
In addition to his work with the college, Han
coached a club team, Synergy, and NCAA rules
require that all members of the club live within a
50-mile radius of his intercollegiate coaching site.
According to Bryn Rosenfeld 'O3, co-captain of
Swarthmore's team, two Centennial Conference
coaches raised concerns that two Synergy players
lived a few miles outside the mandatedradius.
After being made aware of the situation,
Swarthmore College self-reported the issue to the
NCAA.
"The NCAA did not push us to have Han resign
over the conflict, but they were concerned about
the continuation of the relationship," said Athletic
Director Bob Williams.
Han chose to continue coaching Synergy,
where he had developed a long-standing relationship, instead of remaining at Swarthmore.
Swarthmore College notified the volleyball
team of Han's resignation and the start of a local
search for a replacement late July. In early
August, the College began a nationwide search.
Tom Bosley, previously the women's volleyball
head coach at Eureka College in Illinois, was hired
AugJ.7. During his season at Eureka, Bosley led
the Division 111 team to a 7-2 record in the
Northern Illinois-lowa Conference and a 17-12
record overall.
"We are fortunate to have him," said Williams.
"Seldom do we have interest in part-time jobs
from outside the area."
The volleyball team has increased to 10 members after training in the pre-season with six members, the minimum required for intercollegiate

participation.
"After today, I feel we have a team," said
r ßosenfeld on Sept. 3. "There is a good mix of people who came out to play and I'm looking forward
|to the season."

No consolation for Garnet men's soccer
BY DERRICK WU
Last weekend, the 2001 season kicked off to a bad start for the men's
soccer team as inexperience and a decisive own-goal in overtime
earned the young squad a last-place finish in the Swat Kick Classic

Tournament.
The men's team opened the tournament with a 3-0 loss to a strong
Catholic squad that went on to finish first in the tournament. In the
consolation game the next day, Swat fell 3-2 in overtime to a Wesley

team they clearly outplayed.
Despite a rigorous preseason that had the players on the field four
times a day for the past two weeks, the Garnet opened their first game
against Catholic looking out-of-sync. The experienced defense,
anchored by co-captains Chuck Withers 'O2 and Cameron MacDearmid

'O3, saw the bulk of the action in the first half, when the midfield couldn't string consecutive passes together and the front line was unable to
make enough distance from defenders to create shots. Catholic took
advantage of Swat's latent possession game 33 minutes into the half by
scoring off a deflection past Swat goalkeeper Andrew Kramer 'O2.
Catholic never trailed despite allowing nine corner kicks, 14 free
kicks, and half a dozen other legitimate scoring chances. Swat came
within inches of tying the game in the second half when Steven Pater
'O5 rocketed a shot three inches over the crossbar. Midfielder
Goreleigh Willis 'O3 followed moments later with a header that sailed
just over the top of the goal.
By the second half, though, Catholic's quick counterattacks and
consistency paid off, and they tacked on two more goals in the 70th and

73rd minutes of play.
After the game, several players agreed that the offense's lack of synchronization was due to a preseason that focused on fitness rather
than playing together. With one-third of the team composed of freshmen, scrimmaging together more often during the preseason could
have had a profound effect on the outcome of the tournament.
However, Brendan R. Moriarty 'O4 put a positive spin on the situation:
"A lack of scrimmages may have cost us the tournament, but the fitness we gained from preseason will help us in the long run."
In the other Saturday game, Widener and Wesley squared off in a

feverishly paced match. After ending the overtime period tied 4-4,
Widener emerged as the victor when they escaped with a narrow 4-3
win in penalty kicks.
On Sunday morning, Swat and Wesley faced off in the consolation
match. Swat played two halves and an overtime of quality soccer; however, the team fell behind when a Wesley forward scored off a corner
kick 16 minutes into the first half.
Rookie Marty Griffith 'O5 almost notched the first goal of his Swat
career when he unloaded a wide-open shot that clanged off the right
post. He redeemed himself moments later when he played the ball to a
cutting Brendan R. Moriarty who sent a low far-post shot past the
aggressive Wesley goalie that finally put Swat on the scoreboard.
The game was tied 1-1, until Wesley jumped ahead at the 64th
minute with a perfectly placed goal that came off a deflection and
arched over Kramer's outstretched hands. However, Swat leveled the

score 10 minutes later when midfielder Brendan Moriarty 'O5 pushed a through-ball to fellow rookie Kirk
Ellison 'O5, who finished with a nice shot from the 18-yard line. For the remainder of the half, the teams
remained deadlocked, with Swat outshooting Wesley 15-10 but unable to find the back of the net.
The Garnet opened the overtime period dominating Wesley. However, after 106 minutes of play, the game
ended in heartbreak for Swat when Brendan R. Moriarty misplayed a routine ball in the backfield that
resulted in an own-goal and a loss to Wesley.
"The ball came in so quickly. Everyone has their own soccer horror stories; that was my day," said
Brendan R. Moriarty.

After the tournament, Head Coach Don Norton was proud of his players: "We outplayed Wesley, and we
had our chances to score against Catholic. The ball just didn't go our way."
Despite the disappointing last-place finish in the tournament and a preseason coaches' poll that has them
ranked last in the Centennial Conference, the team sees plenty of potential with a talented freshmen class
and an offense that has yet to gel. "Swat's going to kick ass," Griffith said. Forward Aurelio Perez 'O2 admitted that while the team still needs to improve, he believes that the team has a good chance of proving all the
naysayers wrong. The Garnet will hit the road for their next two matchups, heading to Gwynedd Mercy
today, and to Lancaster Bible on Saturday, September 8.

Tide surges to 3-0 start
from WOMEN'S SOCCER, pg. 24
as "Peppy McPepper and the Peptronic Pepnodromes." Several painted soccer fanatics
accompanied the group with chants of encouragement. Such antics served to motivate
an already dominating team.
Though the dedicated fans were not on hand for the road trip to Philadelphia Bible
University on Tuesday, Sept. 4, the Garnet cruised to a 6-0 non-conference win.
Hoverman opened the scoring run in the 22nd minute of the game off an assist by
Stephanie Chapell 'O5. The Garnet continued to pepper the Crimson Eagles with shots
at the end of the first half, and Went into halftime leading 4-0. Both Ele Forbes 'O5 and
Monica Larimer 'O5 scored their first collegiate goals, Forbes unassisted and Larimer
off an assist from tri-captain Katey McCaffrey 'O4. The secondhalf saw two more Garnet
goals from the rookies. Corey Pilver 'O5 popped in her first collegiate goal from Jackie
Kahn's 'O4 assist, while Hahnel finished off the Garnet offensive crusade in the 70th
minute. The victory proved to be a clear domination of the Crimson Eagles, with the
Tide outshooting their opponents 28-5.
Though the 3-0 opening run bodes well for the rest of the season, both players and
coaches see areas for improvement. The team indicated that though it had many opportunities to score, more careful shooting could result in more comfortable leads. As
Coach Amy Brunner said after the opening game, "We definitely have some things to
work on. We need to make sure we move the ball a little quicker. We need to exploit
spaces more." Gotcsik concurred, saying, "Since our team is so young, we still need to
get more accustomed to playing with each other, which is simply the nature of the

game."
All in all, the players feel that their championship win in the 2001 Swat Kick Classic
gives them the confidence they need to enter the season on the right note. Though they
are ranked 10th of 11 Centennial Conference teams in a preseason coaches poll, team
members are excited about their prospects. Brunner said, "Step one began Saturday
and step two was completed Sunday. We have begun to create our solid base. Now we
continue with the next step We're poised to surprise a few people this year. I don't
expect us to win [the conference], but I definitely expect us to improve." McCaffrey
agreed, saying, "Now we know what we need to fine tune in order to have the great season that we all expect to have."

Ted Chan and David El is forecast the NFL season
Ellis' expectations

With the arrival of fall comes school, Jewish holidays,and pro football
and lest we forget, the requisite
football predictions. Football's aspiring prognosticators
have had a robust history of failure. How many of us can
name an "expert" who picked the Giants and the Ravens to
make the Superbowl last September? Instead, the talking
heads annointed the Rams, Colts, Bucs, or 'Skins dismal
failures all. And we mocked the silly football forecasters.
But with a Korobkinesque sense that I know everything, I hereby strive to defy the odds. After all, was Neo
emasculated by his doubts that he was indeed the One? To
the risk-takers come the rewards, and so too do I boldly
proclaim these foolproof predictions for all to see. And
we'll see who's laughing at whom come winter.
NFC East Clearly the Giants, led by Amani "It's not
a" Toomer, are due for a nasty fall. The offensive line is
patchwork, the skill players are mediocre at best, the secondary is porous and the first place schedule is grueling.
The conventional wisdom has selected the Eagles as division champion, despite their frail running back and their
pathetic receiving
corps. While Philly is playoff material,
the 'Skins shall inevitably be the NFC East champs. They
have excellent line-play, playmakers on defense, outstanding running backs and receivers and the league's easiest
schedule. And Jeff George has had one good season for his
last three teams. The Cardinals are despicably pathetic,
and the Cowboys are far worse.
NFC Central
Just like the Vikings' despicable
defense cost them home-field advantage last December, so
too will it bring the state of Wellstone and Ventura to
mediocrity this year. Minnesota's division crown will be
taken by Tampa, where Brad Johnson will finally lead an
offense capable of matching Tampa's ferocious defense.
The overrated Packers shall remain utterly mediocre,
while the upstart Lions promise to bully theirway into the
playoffs. As for the Bears
Shane Mathiews is not an NFL
quarterback.

NFC West
While the Rams are everyone's
Superbowl pick due to their revamped defense, I
disdain
their gimmicky offensive attack and I question whether a
defense made up of outcasts and rookies will be formidable
in the slightest.
Instead I favor the hard-nosed Saints, who

I

IDoast the best offensive and defensive lines in football.
AFC East
Everyone loves the Colts' big three, but
tney won 't get past the
wildcard round until Polian pays
attention to his defense. Herman Edwards will lead the tal-

ented Jets to the division crown, while Miami will struggle with its Herculean schedule. Buffalo shall suffer the
curse of Flutie, and of course New England is atrocious.
Except for its fluky loss in the diviAFC Central
sional playoffs, Tennessee was the top team in football last
year, and they've gotten even better. They will take the
division over the playoff-bound Ravens and the underrated Jaguars. Pittsburgh is everyone's dark horse, but until
they give up their failed Slash experiment, they will continue to disappoint. The Browns and Bengals will rival the
Cowboys as the worst team in the league.
AFC West
The Broncos are the class of the NFL.
They have the league's top coach, great skill players, outstanding lines, and decent linebackers and defensive
backs. They'll overcome the Raiders and Seahawks, both
of whom boast outstanding teams in this, the league's
toughest division. Vermeil needs time with the Chiefs,
while Flutie can only do so much for San Diego.
And my Superbowl pick, you ask? Denver over New
Orleans. And then us sports fans will have to wait until
June, when Jordan'sWizards will battle the Lakers in the
NBA finals. Kassandra was wrong, it seems prophesy is
a blessing, not a curse.

Ted's take

AFC East
Indianapolis: no team in the division
comes close to matching their talent on offense, but their
defense should be improved just a bit.
AFC Central
Baltimore: the loss of Jamal Lewis
hurts more than watching Derek Lowe close a game and
that's pretty painful, but the league's top defense and
upgraded passing game should be enough to go 12-4.
AFC West Denver: the most talented team from 1 to
47 in the league, and that tends to mean a lot these days.
Wild Cards Miami, Tennessee, Oakland
My Patriots: Plenty of talent on the
Worst team
offensive line unfortunately, they're all rookies or second-year players. Combined with a "running" game featuring an underachiever, a fat guy, Kevin "the wrong"
Faulk and a guy named Pass, means Drew Bledsoe will
spend more time on his back than a USC sorority girl.
Kansas City: the defense has stars, but
Overrated
also major holes. I'm of the belief that Trent Green, Priest
Holmes and Derrick Alexander are all overrated. New
York Jets: old quarterbacks, terrible defensive line and an
overworked star runningback. This team could easily

implode. San Diego: Flutie magic? Maybe not, but he won't

throw away games for a great defense like Ryan Leaf did.
Plus, they have the NFL scheduling the equivalent of three
PDCs and Acting 1 (New England, Cincy, Dallas, Cleveland
and Washington).
NFC East Philadelphia: the chic pick this year with
Donovan McNabb. It's another year before their young
wide receivers will be ready to take them to the Super
Bowl.
NFC Central Tampa Bay: seems like they have a bigname player at every position, and that should take them
to the National Football Conference Championship game
this year.
NFC West St. Louis: only injuries can stop them.
Wild Cards New Orleans, Green Bay, Minnesota
Sleepers
Arizona: fairly weak schedule, weak division and a rebuilt offensive line could spell a playoff berth
for the seemingly perpetual underachievers. But I ain't
gonna pick 'em quite yet.
New York Giants: lucky last year, first
Overrated
place schedule this year. They might still sneak into the
playoffs because they play Dallas and Washington twice,
and they own Philadelphia.
Worst Team
Dallas: the fact that the Cowboys suck
makes me really, really happy. Its sort of like how I'd feel
if the Bush family ended up in poverty and could not get
any help from welfare because of their own policies.

The Sweet Spot

'Everyone must play'
mentality hurts
today's Little League

Women's soccer on
3-0 shutout streak

There is a specter haunting Little League baseball: the
specter of communism. The team sports version of com-

munism at least.
Given: team sports drive athletes to hone their physical and mental abilities through competition. That's why
team sports are fun to watch and satisfying to play. Any
lack of competition dilutes these benefits. Watching the
Little League World Series two weeks ago, I realized that
LLWS executives are slowly choking the life out of the
game by removing the element of competition.
How? The execs force every team to play all of its players because they want everyone to have fun. That's sweet.
But it diminishes competition, which in turn makes the
game less satisfying to play and watch. Let's break down
these effects of the "everyone must play" rule.
The best players cannot perfect their baseball skills
because they do not compete with other top-tier players
for an entire game. One may think that skill development
is not too important for twelve-year-olds, but it can make
a big difference in a big game.

I'm sure that Little Timmy loves
baseball, but Pm also sure he
can't play it. I want to see the
best kids play the best ball they
can. Otherwise, I would just videotape myself at batting practice.
Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Tanya Hahnel 'O5, looks to blast a cross during 1-0 Sep. 1 victory against against Immaculata College.
Case in point: in the championship game ofthe LLWS, third
baseman Zach Zwieg made two errors that put the winning
runs on base, ultimately costing his Apopka, Florida team a victory. Now, sports fans across the country are ripping the poor
prepubescent for making "bonehead" plays. But they should
really be ripping LLWS execs for making bonehead rules.
Maybe if Zwieg got more playing time ahead of Little
Timmy, a beneficiary of the "everyone must play" rule,
Zwieg would have accumulated enough experience to
avoid making those two errors.
The game is not always fun for the fans. I'm sure that Little
Timmy loves baseball, but I am also sure he can't play it. I want
to see the best kids play the best ball they possibly can.

Otherwise, I would just videotape myselfat batting practice.
The game is neither fun nor instructive for the Little
Timmies. Sure, they get to play an inning or two of baseball, but they can't have any fun because they play for a
split second and they're too embarrassed that they're not
great. So ironically, they can't even perfect their skills
because they get so little practice on the field.

What are we teaching these kids? Eventually, Little

Timmy will get to high school and college, but he can't
expect to be a walk-on and get playing time. Not on our
team; that's for sure. Little Timmy needs to learn at some
be it
point that everybody excels at different things
sports, academics or otherwise. He should learn to be
happy with those abilities that he does have and to let
Zach Zwieg be happy being a baseball player.
For example, I learned a long time ago that I should
write, not play, sports. So what should we do? We should
let everyone play, but every Little Timmy or Zach Zwieg
should play the full six innings of Little League baseball
with players of his own caliber. That way, everyone gets to
play

Young Garnet team takes first Swat Kick Classic
championship and road trip behind first-year firepower
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
Amid cheers from an adoring entourage reminiscent of
those present at a professional soccer match, the

Swarthmore women's soccer team captured its first championship in the six year history of the Swat Kick Classic
tournament on Labor Day weekend. There have been
some near misses in the past, with Beaver denying
Swarthmore a 1996 win in overtime and with rain canceling the championship game last year.
Though a non-conference event, the tournament allows
teams to demonstrate their skills in a game setting. It is a
test the members of the Garnet Tide passed with flying
colors. Responding to the victory, tri-captain Marah
Gotcsik 'O2 said, "Winning this tournament was absolutely amazing for the team. Hopefully, we will be able to take
this energy into our next game."
A Saturday 1-0 win over the Immaculata Mighty Macs
allowed Swarthmore to advance to the championship
game against Widener University. In a game likely to indicate the intensity of future Centennial Conference play,

Swarthmore dominated the Widener Pioneers with a
resounding 2-0 victory.

The consolation game between

Catholic and Immaculata resulted in a 6-0 Catholic win.
In both games, Swarthmore players demonstrated the
teamwork that they have been developing for the last several weeks of practice. Since the team is comprised pri-

marily of sophomores and freshmen, such solidarity is
essential. Rookies did not disappoint in their inaugural
performance. In Saturday's game against Immaculata,
Rachel Jacobs 'O5 scored the lone goal on an assist by fellow freshman Shavaughn Lewis 'O5 with only 28 seconds
remaining in the first half. Swarthmore outshot their
opponent 14-5 and dominated play in both halves.
In Sunday's championship game against Widener
Tanya Hahnel 'O5 scored a goal on an assist by tri-captain

Claire Hoverman 'O3 only a few minutes into the game.
The insurance goal was scored on a defensive play by a
Widener player after an initial shot by Hoverman. Lewis
applied the pressure necessary for the deflection to take
place. As in Saturday's game, the Garnet remained on the
offensive for the entire game, outshooting Widener 5-L
Commenting on the team dynamic which allowed for
such aggressive play, Hoverman said, "We have a young
team, 14 freshmen, and we are doing our best to use everyone's talent and figure out where they fit on the field and
with the rest of the team."
In addition to positive interactions between teammates, the team cited a supportive fan base as key to their
victories. Swarthmore students turned out in droves to
witness the wins. Their presence and enthusiasm were
highlighted by

a student musical ensemble known as
