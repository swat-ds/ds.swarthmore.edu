institutions such as Swarthmore.
Kari Hong '94 delivered a
speech different from the other
seven. Hong attacked homophobia
at Swarthmore, wondering why so
many students can speak out against
racism without expressing similar
concern for those oppressed due to
sexual orientation. Hong read the
five points of theLBGA proposal,
which include diversity workshops
and courses in sensitivity training
for incoming students. Hong was
quick to point out that similar programs are already in place at other
colleges such as Bryn Mawr and
Carleton.
After the seven speeches, the
floor opened up for comments. Everyone in attendance, including
DeanNgina Lythcott and Associate
Dean for Multicultural Affairs Joe
Mason, seemed concerned with
moving forward. In fact, one student even remarked "There seems
to be more agreement here than disagreement."

Although this gathering was
slightly smaller than last week's

the community appear drivennot to
let theissue die. As Maurice Eldridge
said, "This is not the last time we

Blocks Come Tumbling Down
Following a lengthy discussion, the Housing Committee has
decidedto eliminate all block housing assignments for the upcoming academic year. We realize this change will adversely affect a
certain number of students and we apologize for any inconvenience. However, we felt that eliminating all blocks and following
the normal room choosing procedure was the fairest and most
efficient of all possible solutions.
In its deliberations, the Housing Committee agreed that the
issue of seniority was paramount in the room-choosing process.
Therefore, we felt compelled to make a change because the
principle of seniority which underlies this process was violated.
More specifically, the lottery at Swarthmore College is structured
according to class hierarchy as is reflected in the way the lottery
numbers are generated. Seniors who traditionally live in the best
singles and two-room doubles were being displaced either byrising
sophomores or rising juniors who obtained those rooms through
block housing. In addition, considering the block-housing application only allows threechoices, the goal ofroom choosing based
on seniority was overridden because senior requests overlapped.
The Housing Committee also considered the issues of efficiency and simplicity in its decisions. We kept in mind the time
constraintsfor both the student body at large and the students serving
on the Housing Committee, as well as the time students need to
communicate with each other before going to the actual room draw.
The Housing Committee sincerely apologizes for the
unforseen consequences of increasing the number of blocks
without retaining class restrictions. The entire process will be
carefully revised by the Housing Committee next year.

Student Council Hard at Work Everyone Saywutchalike
Underage Drinking, Hate Speech, and Course Registration:
Student Representatives Tackle Some of Swarthmore's Problems
By Zongqi Xia
Recently, Student Council
has discussed a number of important issues that may profoundly
affect thelives ofS warthmore students. These issues include registration, alcohol reform, The Phoenix, and a possible hate speech
policy.
Disturbed by theincidentduring last winter's Registration in
which a large crowd of students
attempted to push through the entrance of Sharpies at once, Student Council has proposed two
goals, one immediateand another
long term. The immediate goal is
to move registration to the field
house where there is a large open
space so that chaos will be minimized. The long term goal is to
completely computerize the registration process.
With a well-devised method
of computer registration, the students would be required to register directly through professors'
computers. According to Andy
Feldman '96, an SC member, the
major advantage of computer registration wouldbe to increase personal contact between faculty advisorsandadvisees. This proposal,
however, faces serious financial
problems since a replacement of
the existing Computing Center
database would cost the college
one million dollars. The complete
computerization of Registration
will most likely depend upon the
decisions of the College Planning
Committee, currently conducting
nr> this matter,
an..' nore importantly on the feedan

students and faculty.

The second issue that directly
involves students who live on
campus is the proposed Policy on
Alcohol and Other Drugs submitted to Student Council by the Alcohol Reform Policy Committee,
which is composed of students,
faculty and members of the administration. As indicated by the
proposed draft, this new policy
will "uphold, and be in full compliance with, federal statues and

Pennsylvania laws....whichpenalize irresponsible drinking by persons of any age."
In particular, the new policy
focuses on underage drinking and
reckless vandalism resulting from
drinking. The draft proposes that
a first violation of the policy will
result in a warning; a second violation will result in a fine of $5O;
and a third one will result in a fine
of $lOO and possibly suspension
or expulsion. Once the policy is
institutionalized, public safety
officers will not actively search
for individuals who violate it.
"Only if students come to their
[Public Safety's] attention
through violations of other rules
of the Student Code of Conduct,
then any violations of the rules
regarding alcohol will also be subject to adjudication," explained
Dean Bob Gross, who was the
chief author of the proposed draft.
According to Dean Gross, the objective of this new policy is to
"create a climate that supports
moderation in the use of alcohol,
and to reduce instances of individual abuse." Student Council
will hold an open discussion regarding this draft and by the end
of this semester a majority vote
by all students will determine the
proposal's fate.
StudentCouncil has also been
actively involved in helping victims of the recent hate speech incidents. Currently, SC is discussing two proposals for a Hate
Speech Policy. The first one was
submitted by Kari Hong '94 of
LBGA; the other was submitted
by the Coalition of Concerned
Students, which was formed last
week.
In her proposal, Hong demanded prompt and decisive responses by the administration in
cases of violent hate speech. According to her original proposal,
the administration ought first to
send an all-campus e-maildescribing the details of the hate speech
incident. This mailing should then
be followed by a prompt condemnation of the speech. Hong's pro-

posal has been discussed by students in Student Council's open
meetings.
According to Ashee Bhan
'94, the co-coordinator of SC,
many students who attended the
open discussions disagreed with
certain aspects of Hong's proposal. In particular, there were
discrepancies in the exact definition of "hate speech." As a result,
Student Council is working on
broadening the definition of hate
speech.
According to Julie Thomas
'94, the other co-coordinator of
SC, the proposal submitted by
the Coalition calls for a new definitionofmulticulturalism as well
as the establishment of a judicial
process that will specifically deal
withhate speech. In addition, the
Coalition demands that the administration keep records of all
hate speech incidents on archive.
Student Council will hold more
open discussions regarding the
implications of the Coalition's
proposal.
Finally, as a part of the agreement made withthe Phoenix staff,
Student Council is still in the process of helping the English Department find a permanent faculty member who will supervise
the publications seminar given to
the editors of The Phoenix. The
English Department, whichis currently short of faculty, will not
agree to grant The Phoenix editors course credit unless Student
Council can find a candidate for
the position. Once the faculty
member is found, (s)he will discuss, oh a weekly basis, the quality of the previous week's paper
withThe Phoenix editors. It is not
likely that the proper candidate
will be found during this academic year.
In short, members ofStudent
Council have had a busy semester trying to improve students'
quality of life at Swarthmore. As
always, they welcome student input at their weekly Thursday
meetings held in Parrish Parlors
at 8:00 pm.

Who Will Get to Vote in El Salvador?
By Eugene Sonn
Saying he had already made
his position on the issue clear, Representative Curt Weldon refused a
local human rights group's request
that he take action to ensure that
citizens who were denied ballots in
the recent election in El Salvador
are allowed tovote in the upcoming
run-off election.
The human rights group, The
Delaware County (Delco) Pledge of
Resistance, staged an all-day vigil
outside Weldon's Upper Darby district office on Wednesday to pressure the representative into signing
a letterbeing circulated by Rep. Joe
Kennedy of Massachusetts. The
Kennedy letter urges President
Clinton to postpone distributing U.S.
economic aid to El Salvador and to
pressure theS alvadoran government
to make sure no one is barred from
voting in the second round.
Myron Amowitt, the Delco
Pledge of Resistance's staff worker,
reports that between 10 and 15 percent of citizens with voting cards
were turned away at the polls on the
March 20th election and at least
300,000 of 2.7 million eligible voters were deniedvoting cards.
The Delco Pledge of Resistance, which was founded in the
early 1980s by concerned community members and Swarthmore stu-

dents, was joined in their vigil by
several current S warthmorestudents
who had traveled to El Salvador to
observe the March 20 elections:
Sarah Stock well '94, Justin Paulson
'96 and Miriam Shakow '97.
Arnow itt said the Delco Pledge
ofResistance was targeting Weldon
for two reasons. First, Weldon
represents amajority of thepledge's
members. Second, because Weldon
had written letters to President
Clinton, Salvadoran President
Cristiani, and Secretary of State
Christopher back in February, they
hoped Weldon might be convinced
to sign onto the Kennedy letter.
Ironically, these letters which inspired some of the group's hope
were also Weldon's ultimate justification for not taking further action.
Early in the day, vigil members
presented their request to Weldon's
aide, Dennis Lynch. Though the
Delco Pledge of Resistance had sent
a letter to Weldon last week, members said they felt the vigil was
necessary to make sure they got a
response from Weldon by Thursday
the last day to sign the Kennedy
letter.
"We met with him this morning and he didn't say much, but he
said they were considering signing
theKennedy letter," said Stockwell.
As the day wore on and therain kept
falling, members grew anxious.

Hate Speech Dialogue Needs to Address Heterosexism
To the Editor:

I am writing to identify some problematic tensions in the recent campus wide discourse abouthate speech and multiculturalism,
NOT to indict or blame individuals for failing,
but rather to challenge all of us to use this
opportunity of rupture to rethink and revise
how people approach difference at
Swarthmore. Ideally, all of us—administration, students, faculty, straight, queer, black,
white, Jewish, Latino, and Asian—will be
able to capitalize on our commitment, resources, and dedication to make our communities, greater-Swarthmore, and the world a
safer place for all. I attended the student
collection last Thursday nighL Although many
people denounced racism through powerful
and impassioned testimony, no student and
denounced theinstitution of heterosexismand
the pervasive force of homophobia in our
society and
For most students, the
hate of race was privileged over the hate of
sexual orientation.
I am deeply concerned by thecollection's
discourse as itrepresents tome a greater issue;
connections of hate are not recognized or
analyzed by enough people at Swarthmore. I
have been out as a lesbian for the past three
years. IfI do not makeefforts to hide who I am
and who I love when I walk the streets ofany
major city, I am consistently subjected to
verbal harassment—in two icidents the harassment escalated into threats of physical
violence. Even off the streets, four police
officers escorted me out of a place of business
because the owner didnot want lesbians in her
establishment. A lawyer informed me later
that unless there is an explicit gay rights
ordinance, every private business, restaurant,
and movie theater has the "right" to call the
police to remove me from the premises.
Even though the statements from the
Coalition ofConcerned Students and the administration denounced the past homophobic
and racist writings as violent and interconnected, I am concerned that the students who
did not voice this connection might not be as
willing or able to translate their anti-racism
work into advocating against the growing
number of anti-gay rights ordinances that are
being enacted across the country. Ifthey do
not learn to connect the hate at Swarthmore—who else can prepare them for the world?

A more subtle example is the lack of
connection appears in the proposed solution
of the SALANA committee. When theBlack
and Minority Concerns committee was asked
to definewho is a minority, theresponse was
to specify ethnic minority only. To bifurcate
ethnic minority from sexual preference is
problematic for three reasons: 1. It sends a
strong message that the issues facing lesbians, bisexuals, and gay men do not count as
being serious enough to be addressed. 2. It
ignores the overlap of queer people of color.
For queer students of color, racism and
homophobia are intricately tied to their safety.
3. It ignores the overlap of hatred of the two
groups. The past five weeks clearly illustrates that if the campus is not safe for gay,
lesbian, and bisexual students, it is not safe
for any other minority as well.
From these examples, I ask how
Swarthmore students, faculty, and administrators can do a better job of making interconnections ofhow hatred of one of us affects us
all. Because in the end, what difference does
it make if erasure happens by violence or
politeness?
But as I said in the beginning, my hopes
in bringing forward what has been bothering
me is not to point fingers andblame people,
but to be sure to move forward with a clear
vision as to where we are headed. The
administration's
commitment
to
multiculturalism is obvious. Over the past 6
years, the administration has been listening
carefully to the activist, angry and overextended students who were committed to
change. In a sense, the administration and the
students who came beforeus were effective in
changing the structure. To borrow from an
observation made by Ellen Chen,
multiculturalism has become a commodity
here at Swarthmore. Jobs have been created
to select people who are committed to
change—a president that values
multiculturalism, a dean of multiculturalism,
a director for the intercultural center, and
most recently, a gender concerns advocate.
Even with my previous concerns, I am
convinced that there are visionary people
committed to promote multiculturahsm and
the intersections between differences. We
now need to act;, in the hopes of building on
what we already have, I have 5 proposals for
students and administration to consider:

National Responses to Ewart
Administration's Action Spurs Widespread Outrage
To the Editor:
Swarthmore's pusillanimous handling
of the Clinansmith-Yearwood sexual harassment case (EDUCATION, Jan. 24) is
the ultimate example of multiculturalismcum-situational ethics run amok. On the
evidence gleaned from Time's and other
press reports, Ewart Yearwood is an obnoxious, foul-mouthedbully who has cynically used the invalid excuse of"cultural
differences" to hoodwink a well-meaning
but naive faculty head into rewarding him
for his crude sexist arrogance by offering
to pay his tuition at another college during
a one-semester suspension!
As an American of Hispanic extraction,
I particularly resent Yearwood's implication
that male boorishness and vulgarity toward
women is a latino cultural trait. While it is
true that some Hispanic men may adopt such
attitudes toward women they consider to be
of an "inferiorsocial class," itis also true that
in Latin America such men, should they
persist in such harassment, run the risk of
being badly beaten, castrated or even shot to
death by the father, brothers or cousins of the
offended female. Cultural differences or
not, Yearwood is damned lucky that Ms.
Clinansmith is a non-Hispanic white woman,
attending an educational institution that is
politically correct to the point of idiocy.
And by the way, if as the media reports, Yearwood was born and raised in
Belize, he cannot rightfully claim the protection of his "Hispanic culture" as an
excuse for his gross behavior, inasmuch
as the culture of his native country is
Anglo-American rather than Hispanic. In
this case, geographical proximity does not
confer cultural identity.

To the Editor:

I am ususally happy to see myalma mater
in the news. Though I have never been much
of a booster, I do admit some pride in having
completed (survived) the demanding course
load at SwarthmoreCollege. For some reason,
when something niceis said about Swarthmore,
it seems toreflect favorably on me just a little.
Of course, it works both ways. When all
of New York's news media focused on
Swarthmore last week, it was not because of
some brilliant young scholar. It was not even
because Eugene Lang had performed yet another act of generosity. No, it was because
Swarthmore's administration, unable to solve
a problem, had decided to give theproblem to

someone else.
A student at Swarthmore had been accused by a classmate of sexual harrassment.
Although a board of inquiry did not find him
guilty ofthis, it didfind that hehad engaged in
"a pattern of intimidation." To teach the
accused student that"intimidation is not to be
tolerated at Swarthmore College," the administration proposed to send the student study
somewhere else for a semester. As it turned
out, thestudent was rejected by Columbia, the
school ofhis choice, on academic grounds.
I do not pretend to know whatEwart did
ordidnot do. However, I find theactions ofthe
administration preposterously arrogant If intimidationis not to betolerated at Swarthmore,
why should it be tolerated somewhere else?
Why should Swarthmore foist its problem
student on another school? I sincerely hope
that both the Ewart and the Swarthmore administration overcome their evident confusion about their importance. Now, as I had
previously basked in Swarthmore's glory, I
share in its shame.

Sincerely,

Sincerely,

Marc Rangel

1. Change SALANA's focus or form a
sub-committee of SALANA to deal with
sexual orientation and other differences as
they relate to and within race.
2. Have administrative support for annual workshops within "special interest
groups." Just as students at the collection did
not always talk about how race and sexuality
connected, white gay students were not well
represented irt the coalition by our own doing. Trained facilitators need to give annual
workshops in LBGA to deal with its racism,
students of color to deal with homophobia,
etc. We need continuous efforts and opportunitiesfor students to learn to be eachother's
advocates and allies.
1. Just as we have Safer-Sex and ASAP
workshops, four years ago we had diversity
workshops. Bryn Mawr has excellent workshops for lesbian/bisexual sensitivity for all
incoming first-years during orientation week.
I would recommend that the administration
and students to use these workshops as a
model for Swarthmore, so that incoming
students can be exposed to, begin talking
about, and ultimately make connections between their lives and difference.
2 Carleton College has a diversity requirement entitled RAP "Recognition and AffirmaticnofDifferenee3*All students are required to.

take a course that deals with class, race,
gender, sexual orientation, or religious difference in order to graduate. I would recommend that Swarthmore adopt a similar requirement.
3.Have better communication between
administrative initiatives and students. Myself and other students who have brought
concerns to the administration have usually
received a caring, and positive response.
However, I would like to have the administration complete this cycle by being more
vocal and informative so that we may avoid
crisis situations.
I believe Swarthmore is at a unique
point. Everyone is in agreement on basic
values and there is no enemy or obtrusive
barrier to progress. I hope we seek creative and multiple ways for people to make
connections among different issues. Now
is an incredible opportunity to recreate the
meaning of a Swarthmore education to
include the belief that your well-being is
connected to a classmate whose life is
subject to discrimination, hate, and violence. Living in a multicultural society
should mean recognizing another's
struggle as tied to your own survival.

A Defense of Free Speech
To the Editor:

I feel college should prepare the student
for the "real" world. I am talking not merely
of the intellectual obstacles a Swarthmore
education will help us to overcome, but also
the relationships we will have with other
individuals and with society. Hopefully we
will be prepared to deal with these contacts
maturely and responsibly. If Swarthmore is
by any means a microcosm of the "real"
world, then I think it necessary that each
individual doeshis or her part towards bettering, or at the minimum not worsening, the
community as a whole. I therefore deem it
necessary that we embracefreedomof speech
in both its most agreeable and its most unpleasant of forms. If this unpleasant form
involves hate speech then so be it.
I would like to explain thatthere are but
two instances in which free speech must be
restricted.Thefirst involvesfree speech aimed
at inciting illegal action. The second instance,
and one more pertinent to the issue at hand,
involves "fighting words," such as face-toface insults, that are an attack on an individual
rather than on an idea which that person may
stand for. Save these instances, free speech,
whether racist, homophobic, sexist, or whatever, must be allowed. The good of the community is at stake.
How I could anyone believe that words
that might substantially hurt a person can be
anything but detrimental? Truth is a relative
term. We never know quite what it is. We can
only hope that as individuals and as members
of a community we can steer ourselves in its
direction. When two clashing opinions are
argued, we can only edge closer and closer
towards the ultimate truth and the ultimate
right. JohnStuart Mill states "we can never be
sure that the opinion we are endeavoring to
stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure,
stifling it would be an evil still." (On Liberty,
p. 16)
We need falseness to reinforce the truth,
whatever itmay be. Openness in the community is vital. Without freedom of opinion,
even hateful opinion, there is no discussion,
and without controversial discussion no one
is acquainted with his or her own argument. If
we hold a truth that we cannot defend then we,
in reality, hold a prejudice; we must know
why we say what we say so that we do not
function on mindless, blind faith. Much more
importantly, whendiscussion flourishes, truth
hovers within our grasp. If we truly believe
that racism, homophobia, etc. is wrong, then
we shouldbe content with allowing hate speech
to exist. If hate speech is grounded in falsehoods then these falsehoods will slowly die
amidst the discussion.
There is no need for speech codes on
this campus. By stifling expression they will
lead the Swarthmore community farther and
farther from the common good. It is a proven
fact that with the implementation of speech
codes on campuses across the country the
number of biased-related incidents has actu-

ally increased (Free Speech, p. 92). Even
with speech codes, the individuals who have
sribbled slanderousremarks inthepast would
still have taken the cowardly approach that
they did. The fact that they went the anonymous route is a testament to both their lack of
courage and the malevolent effect of the
schools atmosphere.
There is an interesting paradox embedded within the hate speech argument. Those
against hate speech express their views that
hate speech is not welcome on campus and
should be banned. Then they proceed to hold
a collection, the purpose of which is to flesh
out the issue ofhate speech/ free speech and
perhaps find a common ground. People eloquently spoke their minds' and, while the
problem wasn't solvedper se, the comments
helped clarify the various issues. Yet I wonder why those pushing for hate speech codes
are incapable of applying this principle to
more specific issues, like racism. They promoted a collection of opinions in which their
opinion is torestrict certain opinions. Fathom
that. If an open exchange of opinions can
work so well with an issue as controversial as
hate speech, I would thinkthat it would work
equally, if not more effectively, with an issue
as one-sided as racism.
In conclusion, all free speech, save very
particular instances, must at all costs be preserved, for the good of both individual and
community. For these reasons I cannot condemn the act of hate speech (only what it
stands for). At the same time I encourage
those who disagree with me to bring forth
their respective opinions. My adversaries may
ask, "What is the difference between anonymous hate speech and 'fighting words?"They
are both harmful. In fact, at times the former
may be more harmful than the latter. I will
concede that people often get hurt when they
are members of a group thatis targeted in hate
speech. They may even be offended by hate
speech even if they are not a member of the
targeted group. I am heterosexual and
homophobic remarks irritate me, to say the
least.
We must distinguish between hate
speech against an idea and against an individual. We cannot sanction hateful remarks aimed at an individual because, after all, one must be protected against harassment. And this type of ruthless, individually-directed hate speech falls into the
category of harassment rather than expression. Granted, a group is comprised of
individuals. So how can we allow comments which target a specific group to
exist when these comments are destined to
indirectly hurt the individual? I answer
that a fairbalance between individual rights
and the communal good is necessary, and
I believe that hate speech codes should not
be part of this balance.

The Phbepix

A Different Perspective:

'Fashionable Ignorance'

The Phoenix solicited opinion editors
from a number of other colleges to submit
pieces on the issue offree speech on college
campuses. This article was written by a
studentat Dartmouth college in response to
an incident last semester when a group of
students removed the latest issue of The
Dartmouth Review from hundreds ofdoorsteps because they disagreed with its political views.
While walking across campus a few
weeks ago, I watched as one friend approached another who was thumbing through
a copy of The Dartmouth Review. The first
friend, in a tone of disappointment and
disgust, said, "You're not reading that, are
you?" She lowered her head and in an embarrassed voice answered, "No, not really."
Then, as if to save face, she crumpled the
paper in a dramatic fashion and threw it in a
nearby garbage can. A few days later I was
talking to an acquaintance, and I mentioned
that I write for The Beacon. She flatly responded, "Oh, I don't read The Beacon;"
there exists a sense on our campus that you
don'tadmit toreading the "wrong" newspapers.
Some people apparently think it's a
badge ofcourage or a sign ofenlightenment
to refuse conspicuously to read campus political newspapers withwhich they disagree.
It is not noble, or even beneficial, to shield
oneself from another viewpoint, and it is
even less noble to stifle othersfrom seeking
different views. John Stuart Mill's On Liberty states that "whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name itmay
be called and whether it professes to be
enforcing the will of God or the injunctions
ofmen." The most common defense is, "I 'm
just expressing my own opinion, making a
statement." It is one's right, but an immature and self-destructive choice, to refuse to
consider the arguments made by another.
Whether itbe a liberal or conservative voice,
to throw yourhands to your ears and block
out another's voice is not a response that
should be prided.
Yet so many people are proud ofdoing
just this. J.S. Mill astutely argues that in the
end they are the ones who are being damaged. When somebody refuses to consider a
new or conflicting idea, he is denying him-

self the truth, even if only partial, that
exists in the opposing opinion. Mill also
asserts that even if one is not the least bit
convinced by a differing opinion, he at
least achieves a better understanding ofhis
own position by listening to differentideas.
To those who are sure that their views are
correct Mill states, "Torefuse a hearing to
an opinion because they are sure that it is
false is to assume that their certainty is the
same thing as absolute certainty." He continues, "Yet it is evident in itself, as any
amount of argument can make it, that ages
are no more infallible than individuals—every age having heldmany opinions which
subsequent ages have deemed not only
false but absurd..."
The symbolic gesture of disregarding
particular viewpoints and publications does
make a statement, but that statement is not
very flattering. It indicates a person is so
supremely confident that nothing he believes can be false that he no longer needs
to hear the arguments of others. He has
found the eternal and complete truth, and
everyone who differs is either misled or
stupid. The damage inflicted by the closed
minds of such people is spelled out by J.S.
Mill! "If the [different] opinion is right,
they are deprived the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose
what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer
perception and livelier impression of truth
produced by its Collision with error."
All people, regardless of political affiliation, should confront those who attempt to limit by social stigmatization our
ability to considerall viewpoints. Seeking
out the opinions of those not necessarily in
the mainstream is the true sign of enlightenment. No one has a monopoly on the
truth.J.S. Mill succinctly concludes, "in an
imperfect state of the human mind the
interests of truth require a diversity of
opinions." In the words of Sinead O'
Connor, "Fight the real enemy." And the
most dangerous enemies ofany academic
community are not those who hold unorthodox opinions, but those who choose to
remain fashionably ignorant.

Media Makes Heroes,
Legends From Suicide
By John Freeman '96
I've seen the reaction painted across
people's faces and splattered in print: "Oh
boy, anotherrock star living hard and dying
young." The initial jolt of a celebrity's
suicide passes through us like a cola burp
and is gone; how can we sympathize with a
man made inhuman by his fame, a legend
by popular culture, a millionaire by his
music? Often times, as I see happening
with Kurt Kobain in the media, we make
heroes of the fallen star; unable to empathize with their internal pain, we frame
them as having the guts to look death in the
face and find it more attractive than life.
Their death makes them even more like a
character in a play; their death note is read
like a soliloquy of a Shakespearean player
to be glossed and dissected by critics in the
field who fancy that their opinions of knowledge of music or film will enable us to
package the star's life with some sort of
empathic understanding.
Perhaps we feel guilty or insensitive,
remembering the careless hours spent
thrashing about to songs, ignoring groveled
words, too thick and abrasive to hear. Perhaps we feel that we have trivialized
Kobain's music and played a preordained
role in the consumption machine that processes and packages lives like a cookie
factory. And then we purge this guilt by
valorizing the musician, assuming the most
profound poetry into a life we've never
listened to. Somewhere in the media spin
and gory details, it gets lost thatKurtKobain

was a person with a wife, child, friends,
and mother who probably loved him and
were hurt very much by his suicide.
They too, become characters in the
media's Hamletesque story ofKobain's
life; their words and cries are made into
sound bites, cut and shaped like lines,
atomized into electrons to be shot from
a cathode ray tube into our lives.
In moments like these, we ought to
be aware of our reactions, our fear of
death, and our romantic image of the
artist dying young. Suicides in the arts
hit us deeper than we can fathom; it
reminds us that art does not always explain life; as Kierkegaard once said of
poetry, "Much has been said of it reconciling us with existence. Rather much
should be said about it allying us against
existence."
Events like theseraise doubts about
the ability of arts and education to fortify us from sorrow and pain. In this
instance, we ought to remind ourselves
that people are not theorems to control
or characters to entertain us; we ought to
remember that fame and fortune can be,
as Shakespeare's Henry IV said, "like
armor in the heat of day, that scalds't
with safety;" and we need to resist the
urge to buy into the popular culture
glosses of Kobain's life. Let tragic
events like these remind us most importantly that suicide induces as much pain
as it reflects, and that there are depths of
humanpain and suffering which we cannot experience vicariously.

Housing Policy Unfair
Students on Financial Aid Experience Problems
Due to College's Perplexing $lOO Deposit Bill
By Cameron Warner '97
Like many people, I am bitter about the
way housing was handledthis year. The more
people I speak with, the more it appears that
in addition to many other problems with the
housing process, thoseof us on Financial Aid
had problems in the housing lottery at a much
higher percentage than other students.
I'dlike to dabble inrumor, an evil entity
thatruns this school, but I'll stick to fact. My
father was sent the bill for this semester's
housing with a due date of April 15th.He also
was sent a bill for next semester's housing
deposit. He paid the second bill, the housing
deposit, on time, but the money was put
towards the negative balance we still had
because as everybody knows one must have a
positive balance of $ 100.Why, I ask, was that
not made clear to my parents? Why is the due
date for the housing deposit March 28th, and
this semester's housing (as my father understood it) April 15th?Why is it that one cannot
pay the bills separately?
For those of you not on Financial Aid,
the situation might seem simple, but for those
of us whose education is being paid by many
different sources (my personal savings, my
parent's savings, loans from the bank, scholarships, federal government loans, and
Swarthmore) the system is anything but
simple. With so many different sources paying for a person's education it is easy to see
how one or more of these different places
might for some unforeseeablereasonnothave
their appropriate check sent to my parent's or
arrive at Swarthmore right on time. It is also
understandable that it might be confusing for
myself and my parents to keep track of exactly what money we owe to whom for what
and when. Swarthmore ought to have a policy
that accommodates for these complications
if they intend to be truly "need-blind. 1
'

I am angry that my Dad had to pay the
same bill twice, my housing block was thrown
out of the running for supposed late payment
(a practice not done across the board), and I
had to spend two-and-a-half hours tracking
down the check my Dad paid in person that
somehow didn't get sent to theBursarresulting in my still not having a number generated. I also began to hear more testimonies
from people on Financial Aid who had been
treated unfairly. I heard a story about Juniors
who lost theirblock to Sophomores because
one ofthe membersof theirblock didn't have
a scholarship check arrive on time. I heard
stories about people who paid their checks in
person before Spring Break, returning to find
their names still on the list ofpeople who had
paid.
A number of people suggested that I
speak with Dean Westphal or Goundie; I did
talk to Tedd, a very nice man, and I talked to
him for the samereason I am writing this, not
because I want to be handed a room, which
would not be fair to the rest of the student
body, but because I want the system to hopefully be made easier, more fair, and clearer
for students on Aid. I am also writing because I think it is unfair for the Housing
Committee to throw out the block forms of
SOME people who haven't paid, and not
others. It is especially angering that they
threw out the forms for those of us who have
spent inordinate amounts of time trying to
get everything straight, and now manyof us
STILL have not been given a lottery number.
I am usually the first person to stand up
and defendSwarthmore when it is criticized
because I love this place and think thateverybody who doesn'tlike it should simply leave.
In this case though my reaction is decidedly
the opposite.

Gourmet Jazz in the City
The Ravishing Gourmet reviews the Zanzibar Blue
By Wendi Cholbi
Feeling the urge to escape the cuisine of
the Greater Swarthmore Area, three friends
and I headed to Center City to experience
Zanzibar Blue, a restaurant and jazz cafe
located at 301-305 South 11thStreet. That's
about six blocks from Suburban Station. They
feature live jazz in the cafe nightly. Their
menu is self-described as having "French,
Italian, North African, Caribbean, and regional American influences."
The restaurant and jazz cafe are part of
the same establishment, but you can't hear the
live jazz from the restaurant portion, which is
too bad. Recorded jazz music is piped intothe
eating area, but it's just not the same. If you
choose to sit in the cafe area, be aware that
there is a 2-drinkminimumperpersonper set.
Aside from the separation of the cafe
from the restaurant, the atmosphere at Zanzibar Blue is elegant. We walked through the
well-appointed bar area to the small dining
room, furnished with jazzrelated prints, white
tablecloths, and flickering candles on each
table. Our waiter, who introduced himself as
Reggae,' was very friendly and described the
specials in lavish detail.The menu features a
wide selection of seafood dishes, plus a sampling of other meats. The one vegetarian
entree is thePasta of the Day, though they also
have salads and soup, and plenty of bread.
There is also an extensive wine list.
For starters, we decided to order two
appetizers for the table: an appetizer-sized
portion of the Pasta of the Day, which was
garlic and rosemary ravioli with a plum tomato marinara; and a cold appetizer composed of roasted red peppers, arugula, and
thick slices of fresh mozzarella topped with
pesto. They were both delicious.
For entrees, we chose to sample the meats.
I chose the special, Veal with roasted garlic
and pineapple sauce. Ben ordered Chicken
Breast Fontina with sun-dried tomatoes and
marsala wine sauce. Jacy had Raspberry and
Red Wine Scallops, and Michael picked the
Bay ouFilet Mignon withcognac-creamsauce.
While we were waiting for our main
courses, unobtrusive waiters kept our water
glasses filled and provided us with plenty of
fresh rolls and butter. Other diners chatted in
the corners, glasses clinked in the bar, and
jazzplayed in the background.
When our maindishes arrived, they were
beautifully presented on large white plates.
We each had a portion of fresh string beans
and carrots, crisp, not overcooked. Each plate
also included fresh spinach with a warm garlic-herb vinaigrette. The scallop dishincluded
'

rice, and the other three meats came with
potatos, which were tender and delicately
flavored with butter and herbs.
The meats were cooked to perfection,
the filet just to Michael's specification. The
flavors of the vegetables complemented the
meats nicely, but the sauces for each dish
were the glory of the meal. The chefs at
Zanzibar Blue really know how to blend
flavors. They add a touch of wine or cognac,
and create unusual combinations that don't
overwhelm the flavor of the meat itself.
We enjoyed the main part of the meal,
and tradedbites of our maindishes around the
table, but we left room for dessert. We were
glad we did. The dessert menu has old favorites like apple tart, key lime pie, and French
chocolate cake. They also have homemade
icecreams and mousses. The most impressive
dessert on the menu is the ChocolateLover's
Sampler, which includes portions of white
chocolate and milk chocolate mousses, French
chocolate cake, and chocolate ice cream. We
were tempted, but we all agreed that if we
ordered that particular dessert we would ex-

plode.
Jacy ordered White Chocolate/Raspberry
Velvet, which was the dessert of the day, and
Ben and I each ordered French chocolate
cake. I asked for whipped cream on mine.
Michael settledfor espresso, whichreminded
Ben that he wanted to try their cappuccino.
The presentation of the desserts was so
beautiful we had to "ooh" and "aah" before
eating them. The chocolate cake was flanked
by a small scoopof chocolate ice cream, and
in my case, an identical-sized scoop of
whippedcream. Raspberry sauce was drizzled
over thecake, andfresh raspberries andblackberries were scattered over the plate. The
presentation was completed by a sprinkling
ofconfectioner's sugar over the whole thing.
Jacy's velvet was presented similarly, covered with whipped cream, topped by huge
curls of white chocolate.
Our admiration didn't last long, and we
dove in with gusto. The chocolatecake was so
light itmelted in my mouth like a mousse, and
the raspberry sauce was delicious. The
whipped cream was fresh; no Ready-Whip
here. The velvet was so rich that among the
four of us we couldn't finish it. Ben and
Michael reported that the cappuccino and
espresso were hot, rich, freshly brewed and
delicious.

Activism and Teaching
taining the tools to do a great many things.
Among those things, I think, is the ability to
take an active role in the community." The
study of politics and social issues provides
students with many abilities which can be
implemented in work for change.
However, such work also requires a sense
ofpartnership withthe people with whom one
is working. Through the program's internship
aspect, students gain direct access to the lives
ofindividuals whoface difficulties. This contact fosters the communication necessary for
this work.
Mendel-Reyes asserts that"Swarthmore
students have as much to learn from the community as they have to give the community.
You can't really work in a community unless
you're attentive to diversity and difference,
and recognize your common humanity with
other people."

During the past two weeks, Swarthmore
studentshave witnessed and participated in a
surge of campus activism. It has been a time
of exploring our role in the community, our
responsibilities as citizens of a democracy,
and our rights as human beings. This experience has caused many students to seriously
consider and critique American democracy,
and the role that it plays at this school.
Political Science professor MetaMendelReyes has spent her career involved with
these issues. Before coming to Swarthmore
two years ago, she worked for 15 years with
farm workers and grassroots organizations in
California. She helped organize laborers and
minority groups in a struggle for social justice
under oppressive conditions. Her goals in
both social activism and teaching focus upon
working with laborers in the fields, and teaching others about the politics of change in the
classroom.

Mendel-Reyes views such community ways. I would like to see some more regular

To properly mosh, there is a specific
sequence of actions that one must engage in.
First, wait until there is music playing. This is
very important. Then, make sure that you are
not the only one in the circle (it takes many to
mosh). Begin to move in a circular motion,
usually counterclockwise. The proper pace
for this movement seems to be a cross between skipping, hopping and running, but you
can go with the flow.
As you move around the circle, bump
into people with your shoulders. Try to avoid
using any other extremities, as this can lead to
personal injury and lawsuits (here's another
hint, beer is easier to get out of clothing than
blood). Then, voila, you are moshing. Oh, one
thing you may like to do in advance is to make
sure that one of your friends knows how to
contact paramedics, and has a list ofyour next
of kin, in case you collapse and wind up

writhing around on the floor, caught in the
hysterics of a severe head injury.
Perhaps the style of moshing depends
upon the part of the country that one moshes
in. The style that I have related here is the
"Western," Colorado style of moshing. A
close friendofmine told me that she attended
Lollapallooza in lowa, her native state
(sheesh!), and that there was a very large
mosh pit.
I envision this "Midwestern" style of
moshing as a couple of guys in overalls that
bump into each other and then say, "Oh,
excuse me! Are you okay?" Of course, when
I informed her of this, she promptly hit me
over the head with her Birkenstock. Maybe
there is a distinctive "Swarthmore" style of
moshing, with a couple guys running around
in sandals, and giving each other triumphant
high-fives. It's something to think about.

She attempts to integrate all
aspects ofher life in this same way.
As an example, she tells about her
thirteen year-old daughter, Jackie.
As a single parent, Mendel-Reyes
finds that both her daughter's
awareness and her work in activism andteaching areenrkhed when
she is able to bring them together
in a constructive way.
"Having a child and thinking

Just as Mendel-Reyes sees possibilities for political change, she
also sees new lifestyle choices,
which are often ignored. By introducing students to both of these
ideas in an animated way, she combines many concerns, and approaches her work with a broad outlook

Mendel-Reyes admits that
there is conflictbetween ihe types

Machinal Hits Frear
By Mike Maletic
Aah, Springtime once again at
Swarthmore College! The arboretum is beginning to come into full
bloom, frisbees once again soar over
the lawn, squirrels and birds chase
each other around trees, students
begin to shave their heads.. .something special is indeed in the air. All
of the revelry, however, should not
distract us from seeing another jewel
the spring: the Theatre Studies
Department's production ofSophie
Treadwell's Machinal.
This show promises to be another exciting event in what has
been a remarkably active and successful year of theatre at Swarthmore. Directed by faculty member
Abigail Adams, Machinal represents the final product of the Acting
111 class, an entirely curricular production that is the culmination of a
semester's work for more than sixteen students, three faculty members, and two theatre professionals.
In the program notes, Professor Lee Devin, Chair of the Theatre
Department, asserts that the production did not follow any sort of
'style' andrather developed organically out of the specific 'given circumstances' of the text. While this
may be true as an ideal way to attempt to produce a live event from a
written text, one cannot help but
notice the presence of Professor
Adams' particular and distinct style
in her annual productions at the college, a style where a single actor
will flow effortlessly from one character to another, while a group of
actors merge to speak as a single
character. In this way the real, unreal, and subconscious exist on the
stage simultaneously.
Sound confusing? You'll be
surprised to find that Adams andher
actors are able to make perfect sense
out ofall thesetransitions and intersections to the degree that they might
as well have been part of the original play's stage directions. So while
I would argue that Adams does indeed carry a particular style into the
Frear Ensemble Theatre of the PAC
each year, it is one that is at the very
worst enjoyable and at the very best
deeply poetic. That style added to
an original score by David Eckman
of the People's Light and Theatre
Company, lovely early 20th century costumes by Maria Jurglanis
also of People's Light, and an imposing set reminiscent of socialist
constructivism by Professor WilliamMarshall create a degree of polish unmatched by many professional
productions.

The young and talented cast
madeup ofMarahFortson '97, Jove
Graham '96, Suli Holum '97,
Vanessa Morrel '96, Morgan
Phillips '96, Elizabeth Webster '96,
Lesley Tsina '96,and Edward Lloyd
Pierce '94 (the only senior and a
three time veteran of the Acting 111
production) are more than capable
of living up to the high standards of
the other aspects of the production.
And what cretin could ignore the
efforts of Stage Manager/Assistant
Director Jeffery Preston Sugg '95, a
guy who always seems ridiculously
overcommittedbut always pulls everything off withpanache. Thecombined competence of this production team promises to deliver an
impressive evening of theatre.
If there can be any complaint
levied against past Acting 111
projects, it wouldbe that they are so
impressively well put together that
they become perhaps too easy to
watch and avoid challenging the
audience to think, to be moved. The
bold choice to produce Treadwell 's
Machinal, however, necessarily
avoids eliciting anything but an extremely active audience response.
The single greatest success of
Treadwell, one of America's most
important playwright's of the early
to mid 1900's, Machinal recounts
the story of a woman pressed into
marriage for economic reasons and
her radical revolt against the life she
has been forced to accept.
The play is told through a series of nine episodes that describe
the woman's systematic entrapment
within a world which deprives her
of freedom and humanity. It is a
wonderful text, filled with humor
and terror servedup in a remarkably
original fashion even by today's
standards. You can be sure that this
production will only add to the
script's inherent intensity: it is a
show which should not be missed
by anyone interested in supporting
the tremendous effort required to
produce such impressive results.
Machinal by Sophie Treadwell
will be shown in the Frear Ensemble
Theatre of the PAC this weekend at
B:ooFriday and Saturday, 2:00. (the
posters incorrectly say 3:00)
Also, don't forget to go see
Cyrano for Two Quartets in Bond

Directed by Dan Rothenberg '95
and starring Quinn Bauriedel '94,
Dito van Reigersberg '94, Tellery
Williamson '95, and Nate Read '95.
Like Machinal this production is
sure to make for a moving and entertaining evening.

Rugby Rocks UVA Tournament
By Jennie Romich
Last weekend, Swarthmore
Women's Rugby team traveled to
the University of Virginia Women's
InvitationalTournament. TheTournament started with an easy victory
over fledgling Johns Hopkins. With
this victory under their belts,
Swarthmore advanced to play Mary
Washington College onUVA's Mad
Bowl, a vomit strewn field surrounded by good-ol'-boy fraternity
houses. Swat'sfirstscorecamefairly
early in the first half as Mel Bonder
'95 picked up a bouncing loose ball
and ran 60 meters, shedding four
Mary Washington tackles for the
try. JuniorRachel Johnson's magic
foot converted, putting Swat up 7-0.
Up by a scant two points at the half,
Swarthmore stepped up the intensity level. Despite blatantly antiSwat refereeing, the women hung
tough to win the matchafter a scoreless second half.
That night, the word on the
street was thatUVA wanted to make
the finals, and thought Swat had
lucked their way into the semis-an
easy win. "Drink up," encouraged
other teams, "UVA will squash you
anyway." Trying to quash mutiny
among the seniors, co-captains
Romich and Delta Ruscheinsky '95
urged players to get sleep.
Scared as they took the field

the next day, Swarthmore reversed
all predictions. Holding a confused
UVA scoreless until the half, Swat
came back from an inspiring halftimerecovery sessionready to show
the tournament hosts a thing or two
about "easy wins."
Through continued fine and
clean play, Swarthmore capitalized
on UVA's frustration. The forward
pack's looseplay escalated to mighty
levels. Filling into the back line,
second-rowAlice Sondheimer '94,
contributed most significantly to the
fowards' constant support and fine
rucking. Aperennially strong player,
Sondheimer proved herself to be a
most valuable and versatile pack
member.
Tough defense from the backs
prevented break-away UVA tries.
Shaking off a rough start in the
tournament, Lynn Mathews '97
fielded like a monster and ran every
kick back while full-back Rebecca
Cole '96, assisted by fine tackles by
flankers KarenKleiber '95 andfirstyear standout Dana Correale '97,
shut down UVA's running game.
After 50 scoreless minutes, the
game movedinto suddendeath overtime. UVA, confused and battered,
stepped up the aggression and drew
apenalty withinthree minutes. Once
again, Johnson was called to kick.
Thanks to the frat boys, the uprights
were partially destroyed and

Johnsonhad to aimfor one pole and
half of a cross-bar-with a menacing
UVA squad ready to pounce. The
team closed its eyes on the kick and
opened them to shockedUVAfaces.
Thekick was indisputably good and
Swarthmore was in thefinals with a
3-0 victory!
After playing three full games
in twenty-four hours, Swat had to
rally for a grueling 80-minute game
against Virginia Tech, an emerging
powerhouse of the south. Outweighed by an average of fifteen
pounds per player in the scrum and
faced by a vicious flanker and back
even faster than Bonder,
Swarthmore geared up for a tough
defensive game.
Tackles by Correale and outside center Kathy Suyeyasu
vented thebreak-away tries thathad
markedevery other VA Tech game
in the tournament. VAT fought hard
for each try, with Swarthmore
strongly resisting.
The bruisedSwatteamcouldn't
advance offensively. The game
ended a 20-0 loss, placing
Swarthmore second in the tournament.

With a 4-3 record with losses
three East Coast quarterfinalist
teams, Swarthmore hits the road
again this weekend to play Wellesley
before returning to beat Bryn Mawr/
Haverford on the 23rd.

team is made of experienced returning players accompanied by
many strong freshman, making

Swarthmore a powerhouse in the
Centennial Conference.

Tournament was held at Swarthmore. After beating Kenyon and
losing a close game to Mount
Holyoke, the Swat team came

U. of Michigan Blues
By Jon Safran and Dan Maher
There are ten completely valid
reasons why the Michigan maize
and blue should have prevailed in
the 1994 men's collegiate basketball tournament. In fact, the authors
of this invaluable article contend
that, if not for a conspiracy at the
highest levels ofAmerican government, Michigan would have
trounced Arkansas, spanked Arizona and spat upon the lowly Blue
Devils of Duke University.
1) As alluded to above, President Bill Clinton unlawfully abused
the powers of his post to influence
the result of the Michigan-Arkansas game. Clinton used the Secret
Service to intimidate the Wolverines players—there is one documented case where Secret Service
members appeared at Michigan star
JuwanHoward'shotel room at 3 am
brandishing weapons. Clinton also
threatened to deport the game officials to Toronto if they allowed
Arkansas to lose. This is the only
reason Michigan lost to the lowly

Hogs.
2) The Michigan Wolverine
point guard Jalen Rose is the best
all-around player in the country,
period And we all know good guard
play is the key to winning tournament games.
3) Michigan has the best looking players.
4) Corliss Williamson was accidentally switched at birth with

somebody named "Dugan" Fife. If
this error, Corliss wouldbe a
Wolverine and Dugan a Hog.
5) Michigan is the only team to
be visited by an extraterrestrial being during the season. After playing
a night game in Indiana, an alien
appeared in the Michigan lockerroom completely lost; the Michigan
players—who are known for their
sagacious nature—helped the alien
reprogram his transmogrifier and
return home.
6) The only other team that
truly deserved to win the tournament was the mighty Colonials of
GeorgeWashington led by theYinka
Dare and the irrepressible, lovable
Nimbo Hammons. Unfortunately,
Hammons ran into a cold streakand
his team was defeatedby theUConn
Huskies.
7) Michigan is known for its
clean "Ail-American" scholar-athlete image and sportsmanship. What
better team for young Americans to
look up to than the gentlemen who
don the maize and blue?
8) Michigan has the coolest
uniforms. Baggy gold shorts, shiny
gold shirts, black socks; they got the
look you want to know better!
9) Despite losing the key member of the Fab Five, the unheralded
Michigan squad was clearly the best
team in the nation throughout the
entire season. Period.
10) We both picked them to
win (as did every other good lawabiding democracy-loving citizen).
