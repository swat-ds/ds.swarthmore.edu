Talk of Financial Aid Pervades Campus
By

Patrick Runkle

"If financial aid at Swarthmore is
threatened in any way, I am ready to
fight."
These words come not from a studentbut fromDonna Jo Napoli, chair
of the linguistics department, in an
all-faculty e-mail message sent on
Monday. She was writing in response
to a The Phoenix report of a 26.4
percent cap on the proportion of the
budget allotted for financial aid. Her
message was intended to make faculty members become more involved
in the discussion.
During the course of the week,
President Al Bloom and Dean Ngina
Lythcott have sent messages to the
faculty and students, respectively, to
reassure them that "the College remains fully committed to need-blind
admissions, to meeting the assessed
financial need of each student, and to
[the] vigorous pursuit of our effort to
increase the representation of cultural diversity in the community," as
Bloom wrote.
Lythcott reinforced this, writing
that "it's hard for me to imagine
Swarthmore ever abandoning these

commitments."
Napoli explained in an interview
on Wednesday, "I am very proud to
teach at Swarthmore. It's not because
of the academics. There are many
places with outstanding academics.
I'm proud to teach here because
Swarthmore has a social conscience.
I'm extremely proud of that. I think
the financial aid policy is one of the
prime examples of that conscience."
Bloom explained further in his message that "because within several
years we are likely to reach a limit on
how much students can borrow from
federal programs, we will have to
explore other funding sources—including alternative borrowing programs, development efforts, and the
College budget—to cover any increases in student financial need
which might exceed the rate of increase in tuition."
In her message, Napoli described
how a cap on financial aid could
perpetuate and widen the gap between rich and poor: "The poor kid
will be in the same old position
having to do more and better than the
rich kid just in order to be in a comparable position when competing for
—

a slot in medical school or grad school
or law school or even when going out
into the world and competing for a

job."
She also said she is ashamed that a
college which can seemingly raise
enough money for ornate Italian
marble in Kohlberg cannot raise the
same money to reduce loan and workstudy requirements for students on
financial aid.
Bloom noted in his message that
while next year's budgetary allotment foresees increased loans and
increased
work
"slightly
expectations...the College's loan and
work expectations will likely remain
significantly below the median of
those of our comparison group of
institutions."
Napoli said the few reactions she
has gotten to her message have been
positive. She also says that she has
received several messages telling her
that the article in last week's Phoenix
was inaccurate and that the financial
aid cap was never on the table.
"I hope I'm just chasing a phantom," she said. "But students here
don't usually get upset over nothing."

This week, the Friends of Survivors organization at Swarthmore has
sponsored Survivors' Week, an effort to raise awareness about sexual
assault and abuse and to rally support
for men and women who have survived sexual abuse.
The support for survivors has taken
many forms. At the desk in Parrish
Parlors, volunteers handed out information on sexual assault, rape, and
abuse, as well as yellow ribbons to be
worn as a demonstration of support
for those who have experienced such
trauma. There are several opportunities for students to meet in large and
small groups to talk about personal
experiences, and experiences of those
close to them.
Thereis also a poster where people
can write their reasons for wearing
the yellow ribbons. Statements on
the board that is titled "I wear a yellow ribbon because..." declare "my
sister is a survivor;" "one of my
friends was raped;" "my mother was
raped, and the guy is still out there
somewhere...;" "I was 14, I never
told anyone;" "my cousin is a survivor, fighting to regain what they stole
from her;" "he still has no idea it was
rape;" "at least 50% of my friends
admit to having been raped. How
many more do I know who can't
admit it yet?" and "survivors need

support!"

Dana Yamate '96, co-coordinator
of Survivors' Week, says that the
main goals of the event were to "increase awareness about issues [of
sexual abuse and assault] and show
how pervasive they are; that they can
affect everyone, men and women,
students and faculty."
Yamate says that there has been a
lot of student support for the events
that have taken place so far, such as
the t-shirt making party for the
Clothesline Project, and the showing
and discussion of the movie Kids.
She said, "It's been really exciting to
see so many students involved."
"People were genuinely appreciative that the Clothesline Project was
brought here," says Yamate. "It's had
a lot of impact, sort of quietly. People
have been free to go in and contemplate them on their own." The Clothesline Project uses t-shirts strung across
Parrish Parlors as visual representations of people who have suffered or
died as a result of sexual abuse, rape,
or intolerance.
Anonymous responses to the
Clothesline Project, written on the
poster in Parrish Parlors, demonstrate
the emotion that the display generated: "All the silence that surrounds
these victims and all the voiceless
who aren't making t-shirts scream
out of these clotheslines making us
hear, making usreckon with the pain."
Another states "these faceless t-shirts
are real people, real stories... it makes

me sick. A huge pain in my stomach
means that we have to FIGHT this
violence."
Gabrielle Kruks-Wisner '99, one
of the coordinators for the Take Back
the Night rally, which merged with
Survivors' Week, says that not all of
the responses have been positive. She
says that some people have "had really bad reactions to the signs, and
said that they annoy them, and that
the signs were excessive and overdoing it." But Kruks-Wisner defends
the signs by saying that "there's so
much silence the other weeks that
this week we have to speak out."
Yamate agrees, saying that "thereis a
tendency to ignore it [sexual assault
and abuse], or treat it with silence or
shame, which does not help the survi-

vors."
Yamate adds that the signs, t-shirts
and other events were not merely for
shock value. She and co-coordinator
Colleen Bartley '96 say that they
"have been concerned that people
would have seen the signs and things
for the rally, but not have been aware
that there was a space for discussion."
In order to answer questions raised
by all of the publicity, there will be an
open meeting for all interested students on Sunday night at 8 p.m. in the
Lang Performing Arts Center, room
201. The remainder of the meeting is
reserved for survivors to talk about
their experiences.

SC Sponsors Student Sit-in
By

Fred Bush

Troubled by the recent College
Budget Committeerecommendations
regarding student financial aid, StudentCouncil has circulated a petition
to bring more student input into the
budgeting process. Student Council
members, ever-present at meals, have
been asking students to sign the document.

Student Council plans to present
the petition to the Board of Managers
after a silent demonstration starting
at 9:40 a.m. tomorrow outside the
Friends Meeting House.
Citing a desire that "student opinion be accorded due respect," the

petition notes that "the decision-making process that produced the current
budget proposals before the Board is
not one that reflects the value we
believe the college places in addressing legitimate student concerns." To
that end, the petition asks the Board
to return the recommendations to the
CBC for more student input.
The petition goes on to attack the
policy of confidentiality under which
many College committees operate,
claiming that confidentiality both
keeps students away from issues that
affect them deeply, and prevents student committee members from "adequately representing the interests of
the student body as a whole."

&

Petition

The petition claims that Budget

Committee student representatives
"were as isolated from the student
body as the student body was from
the issue."
Finally, the petition voices concern over the long-term effects of the
changes under consideration. Noting
that"the diversity ofthe campus community is a foremost value of the
studentsofS warthmore College,"the
petition states that "a long-term policy
of capping the proportion ofCollege
revenues that can be used to aid students with need and to bring socioeconomic diversity to the campus
sends the wrong signal to prospective
Swarthmore students."

Unpaid Bills and Missing Receipts Spur Request for Change in SAC Protocol
By Abigail

Salerno

Last weekend, Budget Committee
Treasurer TanishaLittle '97 presented
Student Council with a proposal that
would redefine the protocol of the
Social Affairs Committee. This proposal denies additional funds to "students, organizations or their student
representatives...until all previous
balances have been reconciled." The
Budget Committeeasked that the new
policy be included in the Student
Council Constitution applying to
SAC.
Little hopes that the new measure
will bring more order to the work or
the Budget Committee.She regretted
the fact that "getting receipts has al-

ways been difficult" because those
who apply for SAC funds do not
necessarily come from organizations
with a set group of people assuming
responsibility for the budget of a particular event. Little noticed that "certain people or certain groups
were...getting more funding without
reconciling differences."
The proposal, in its original form,
included strict guidelines to limit the
potential for abuse of new regulations. Fearing that students might
solicit funds using their own names
on behalfof organizations which had
been delinquent in the return of receipts, the proposal originally read,
"no student organization or member
ofthat organization may receive funds

from SAC unless they have turnedall
receipts or a combination ofreceipts
and money to the Budget Committee
Treasurer." Little agreed to eliminate
this clause so as to avoid penalizing
members of an organization who were
not responsible for budgetary negligence.
Student Council Co-Coordinator
Nancy Benson-Nicol '9B explained,
"The Student Council saw difficulties in the fairness and feasibility of
holding [all] members of an organization responsible, since many students belong to many different organizations and request funding for different constituencies." By holding
every group member responsible for
the negligence of their group, a

member's right to ask for funds if he
or she were planning another event
with another group would have been
suspended.
The importance of receipts was
illustrated by last semester's SACfunded Pub Night. According to
Little, the "Budget Committee was
not very pleased with the way SAC
was spending money...they funded
Pub Night one week; although they
said the money wasn't spent on alcohol, it still isn't the kind ofactivity we
would like to see the committee working on." SAC gave Paces $6OO, but
according to Benson-Nicol, "no SAC
money funded any alcohol, only refreshments." She also hoped that"this
issue will be totally resolved when

At Swat, Many Celebrate Black History Month on a Personal Level
By

Evelina Shmukler

The first Negro History Week was
celebrated in 1926. Though the occasion went unmentioned in The Phoenix, on February 23 of that year the
newspaper reported "an innovation
in Swarthmoreforensic circles" when
"the Garnet team met representatives
from Lincoln University, a colored
institution, in an open-forum debate."
Now, seventy years later, Negro
History Week has become Black History Month, and at Swarthmore there
were a number of events in celebration of the contributions and successes ofAfricans andAfrican Americans.
Last Saturday the Black Cultural
Center was the site of a Black History
Celebration, where attendees read
poetry, sang, and listened to the a
cappella group Black Coffee. The
BCC is also housing a collection by
quilter Sylvia Blackwell, and along
with SASS (Swarthmore African
American Students Society) and the
Intercultural Center, it has sponsored
several speakers during themonth. A
prominent display in Parrish Parlors
highlighted the theme of Black history, as did another display in the
Bookstore.
Though most students seemed to
be aware of Black History Month,
few seemed excited about it. Many

felt that the celebration shouldn't be
confined to such a limited time.
"I'm one of those people who prefers to celebrate excellence and promote the progress that the African

Sean Wright '96 agreed that the
events planned dependmainly on students' desires. "We're all so busy

diaspora has made every day," said
NiYa Costley '97, co-president of
SASS. "A month set aside is nice, but
I prefer to make it an everyday issue."
Costley also said that this year's
celebration of the month wasn't very
different those of previous years.
"The events planned really depend
on what the current students want to
do, on who's spearheading things,"

what students can handle, and that's
not very much."
Wright saw the month in a personal
way. "I think [Black History Month]
is more of a celebration," he said. "I
don't find it necessary to go to a
museum or to the theater, though I
did this year. I see it as setting some
timeaside to celebrate the great Afri
can Americans that have contributed

so much to American society."
Anam Owili-Eger '96 similarly saw
the month as time to celebrate personally. As a member of Black Coffee, he performed this month at the
Settlement Music School in Philadelphia, doing a show with the theme
of black history.
"Most of the things I've done for
Black History Month in the past have
beenrelated to music," he said. "Making my own music is a way, for me, of
creating my own history."
Emily Bobrow '96 felt that she
hadn't participated as much this year
as she had in years past, when as the
head of Ruach she organized a joint
program with SASS.
Pauline Cho' 96, on the other hand,
said that she felt like she had participated more this year. "I heard a lot
about Black History Month on the
radio, I saw the quilts at the BCC, I
read the Parrish Wall," she said. "I
think I was more involved this semester because ofmy friends and my
thesis."
Wright felt that this year's Black
History month marked an important
change in him. "As a senior, I've
appreciated that so much more is left
to be done in making American societyaware in general ofAfricanAmericans, what they've done, what their
problems are, and where their communities are," he reflected.

receipts become available."
Funding a diverse range of social
events is proving difficult. Despite
the Budget Committee's feelings, as
expressed by Little, that "there were
a lot of parties with alcohol and there
weren't enough alternatives and the
money wasn't being spread out
enough among students or student
groups," the principle of "first come
first serve" on any specific weekend

rules the appropriation of SAC
money.
Although SAC sometimesreceived
more requests than it could fill, Little
still was concerned that "there aren't
as many people going to SAC to
request funds" compared to last year,
when she claims that a greater variety
of events were soliciting funding. She

Night Vigil Honors Victims
By

Patrick Runkle

On Monday night about 40 students gathered on Magill Walk for a
candlelight vigil in memory of the 25
people who died and 77 who were
injured as a result of Sunday's bombings in Israel, and to memorialize all
other Arab and Jewish victims of
recent terrorism in the Middle East.
The vigil was organized by the
Swarthmore Zionist connection.
Rabbi Rebecca Lillian, Tri-College
Jewish students' advisor Cheryl
Cook, and a representative from the
WorldZionist Organization were also
in attendance.
Both Jewish and non-Jewish students stood in a circle at the top of
Magill walk. The vigil commenced
with the lighting of candles and a
moment of silence. At both the be-

ginning and end of the service, students sang the song "Oseh Shalom"
("Make Peace"). During the service,
students took turns reading through
several prayers for peace in English.
The vigil also included the songs
"Shir Ha-Shalom" ("Song of Peace")
and Israel's national anthem
"HaTikva" ("The Hope").
In a message on Tuesday, Naomi
Michlin '9B said, "When gathering to
mourn or commemorate victims of
such violence it is critical for people
to feel the support of others, and for
everyone I talked to, that was exactly
what happened. It was encouraging
to have so many people show up and
participate on such short notice. As
glad as one can be under such circumstances, I was glad to be a part of
the care and strength that came out of
everyone coming together."

toilets have been jammed; the last

Part of the top floor of McCabe
Library was flooded last Saturday
night; water soaked though the carpets and leaked onto the floor below
in what has been described as the
worst such incident ever in t^; building.
Evidence shows that it was not
caused by recent rain and snow
storms, but by an act of vandalism: a
toilet in the women's bathroom on
the fourth floor was found stuffed
with paper towels, and the lid had
been removed. One of the valves had
been jammed so that the water would
keep running.
The flood was discovered Sunday
morning by the cleaning staff, who
called Physical Plant. Circulation
Librarian Libby Amann was then
called in, after which clean-up of the
area and removal of books began.
Environmental Services brought in a
big blower, set up some fans to help
dry the carpet.
"Thiskind ofincident happens with
some degree of frequency [around
campus]," said Owen Regrave, Public Safety. "There were no eyewitnesses, and not many clues. Wedon't
really have much to follow up on."
This is not the first time that
McCabehas been flooded. There have
been four or five occasions where the

incident occurred a few years ago.
There have also been leaks in the
roof, causing water to collect on Level
IV.
The flood most seriously affected
the areas around the women's bathrooms, especially on the Level 111,
where the journals are shelved. There
was water trapped in the ceiling of
the third floor above the false tiles,
where it couldn't be removed.
We just had to let it drip down,"
said Ralph Thayer, director ofmaintenance, who supervised the cleanup.
Most of the books in the area were
just splashed and escaped with
slightly wet covers. However there
are about a hundred periodicals that
are wet enough to be considered seriously damaged. Some of them need
to be rebound, others replaced, while
still others may look bad but are still
in good enough condition to be used.
We're going on a case-by-case basis as to determining which ones need
to be replaced," said Amann.
All the books were removed and
placed on the tables in the newspaper
reading lounge. One major danger
has been avoided: no mildew formed
on the books or the carpet.
That's always a problem in a warm,
wet environment," said Amann, "but
the books are drying all right."

A nutrition and exercise issues support group, made up of faculty and
staff members and led by Personal
Trainer Debi Cornaglia, plans to resume its weekly meetings beginning
Wednesday, March 6. The group
meets in Worth Health Center from
noon to 1 p.m. to discuss a variety of
fitness-related issues including the
food pyramid and the use of inexpensive weights. Cornagliais also available to work withindividuals on their
personal diet and exercise programs.
The group was started by Nancy
Loeffelholz, textbook buyer for the
College Bookstore. Loeffelholz met
with Amy Graham, monographs/reference librarian in McCabe library,
and Linda Echols, director of Worth
Health Center, and they decided to
invite Cornaglia to facilitate the meetings of the support group. "It seems
natural that...[the group] should be
supported by the Worth Health Center," says Loeffelholz, "since nutrition and exercise are health issues."
Cornaglia's works with the Sports
Authority, and she is paid for her time
at Swarthmore only through donations,
usually a few dollars per person.
For Loeffelholz, the group is a way
to encourage good health. "It's
easier," she says, "when you know
other people also have similar goals
and you can act as a support for one
another." The focus of the group is
not on losing weight but on healthy
exercise and eating habits.
Loeffelholz stresses the fact that
fitness "affects everything we do including our jobs." She had, herself,
been experiencing daily fatigue,
which came to an end when she took

Cornaglia's suggestion and started
drinking more water. "Without the
liquid," says Loeffelholz, "none of
the nutrients were being dispersed
throughout my body."
At one meeting, Cornaglia had each
person in the group write in a journal
about what he or she did and ate in a
typical day. Then she analyzed the
journals to make specific, realistic
recommendations for each person that
did not require huge investments in
time or money. Some of these included walking 15 minutes a day,
parking further away, and taking the
stairs instead of the elevator.
Loeffelholz recalls that about 12
people came to the group's first meeting in November. The group continued to meet once a week throughout
December but then stopped meeting
in January and February due to inclement weather, winter break, and

personal complications.
Loeffelholz is optimistic about
resuming group meetings and believes that "as the weather begins to
get nicer and people start wanting to
be out and are thinking about summer
they will naturally begin thinking
about shaping up and exercising."
The group is open to all faculty and
staff and Loeffelholz hopes that increased participation will help participants to "get to know other people
from different areas of the college
community." Although many faculty
members have expressed interest in
the group, faculty luncheons conflict
with the Wednesday noon meetings.
The group may discuss changing the
day to accommodate more faculty
participants. So far, for what appear
to be legal reasons, the group has not
been opened to students.

Council's commitment to "ensuring
that prior agreements about the availability of minutes, fairness in allocation, and open communication continue throughout the semester and

There Is A World Outside of Swarthmore: News from Other College Campuses
Students Disillusioned With Presidential Field

Tsongas Predicts 1996 Campaign Outcomes

By Stephen Kiehl

Rachel Smolkin
The Brown Daily Herald
By

The Daily Northwestern

(U-WIRE) As college students struggle to keep up with rising tuition costs,
try to break into the job market and prepare to lead this country into the next
century, they may have the most at stake in this year's presidential election.
They just don't realize it yet.
In 1992,with the young, charismatic Bill Clinton courting the college vote
and MTV urging students to "Rock the Vote," young people voted at a higher
level than they did throughout the 1980s.
But this year, none of the candidates has strong support among college
students yet. The Republican candidates have failed to specifically target
students, and Clinton has not lived up to the expectations of the students who
so vigorously supported him four years ago.
"Clinton went in and made all these promises," said Medill freshmanKevin
O'Reilly. "And a lot of those promises have not come to pass. Youngerpeople
feel disillusioned with Clinton."
O'Reilly' s thoughts are echoed by many college students, who say Clinton' s
campaign pledges on social issues and education have not come to fruition.
"I would normally support the Democratic candidate, but I'm disappointed
with Clinton," said Music sophomore Brad Haak. "He hasn't kept his
promises."
But the Republican candidates have not stirred much emotion among
students, either.
Many students say Pat Buchanan is "just scary." Bob Dole's age may be an
issue. Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes have found limited support. "Lamar
is the one who could appeal most to college students," said Becky
Levin, president of College Democrats at Northwestern. "He's charismatic
and seems more in touch with people."
"Forbes has generated some student support because of the simple appeal
of the flat tax," said NU political science Prof. Ken Janda. "Dole's stories
about World War II don't relate very clearly. It's trying to invoke an image
of John Wayne, and he's not the current hero."
Then again, neither is Clinton. But while they're not exactly thrilled with
his performance in office, students say he has not abandoned them.
"I like the fact that Clinton, even though he made mistakes, was trying to
do things," said Speech junior Jeff Apfelberg.
"I'm annoyed with who's running and who's doing well," said graduate
student Jodi Salomon, referring to Buchanan's recent success in the campaign. "I believe Clinton is for the students."
The lack of a single, clear-cut candidate for students to support may lead to
a lower turnout at the polls in November, said Curtis Gans, director of the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a Washington, D.C.based voting analysis organization.
"The level of enthusiasm has been diminished for the Democrats and was
never there for the Republicans," Gans said.
Young people have always voted far below the national average. In 1992,
37 percent of those age 18-24 voted, compared to the 55.2 percent average.
In 1994, 16 percent of the 18-24 group voted while the national average was
38.8 percent, Gans said.
"Older people participate more than younger people because voting is a
learned habit," Janda said. "So students are coming in at the beginning."
At NU, there has long been the stereotype that students are apathetic about
politics. Interviews with students found many who were uninformed about
this presidential campaign.
Involvement in NU's political clubs offers further evidence of the apathy.
College Democrats has about 15 active members, Levin estimated. There
are about 20 to 25 active members of the Conservative Council, president
Kevin Frost said. And College Republicans has about 25 active members, said
member David Seckinger.

(U-WIRE) Former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas has a prediction
for the 1996 elections—squabbles among Republican presidential candidates
will benefit the Democrats.
"Not only will Bill Clinton w n re-election, there's a good chance the
Democrats will take back the House," Tsongas said in an interview Tuesday
with The Herald.
"The interesting thing about it is the Democrats didn't do a thing to make
it happen," he said. "They just sat back and watched the Republicans push too

far."
Tsongas, a 1992 Democratic presidential candidate, also served in Congress from 1974 to 1984. He has just completed a book called Journey of
Purpose, which articulates his view that Americans support economic
conservativism and social liberalism.
Most Americans want to balance the budget and cut the deficit, Tsongas
said.
He is the cofounder, with formet Senator Warren Rudman, of the Concord
Coalition, a bipartisan grass-roots organization devoted to controlling the
federal deficit.
Tsongas also believes the majority of Americans want a multicultural
society that supports gay rights and a woman's right to choose. The problem,
said Tsongas, is that Americans are hard-pressed to find a politician who
embraces their views.
"The politics of this country changed tremendously for the worse in
November when Colin Powell said 'No thank you,'" Tsongas said.
In 1994, Americans disgusted withbig government and PresidentClinton's
failed health care plan voted overwhelmingly for Republicans, Tsongas
writes in Journey of Purpose.
But Republicans misinterpreted this vote as a mandate for a social
revolution, Tsongas said. The House and Senate leadership began to
dismantle programs for the poor and attack entitlements—such as Medicare—that Americans cherished.
The unity of the Republican party and the Contract With America are now
in shambles, he added.
In recent weeks, public opinion polls have cast doubt on the certainty of
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's Republican nomination for President.
The campaign of conservative political pundit Pat Buchanan has gained
momentum.

"Those of us who served withBob Dole are admirers of his," Tsongas said.
"The problem with Bob Dole is he had so much money, and so many
endorsements, he didn't think he had to articulate his message."
Tsongas declined to comment directly on Buchanan's candidacy. But he
implied thatBuchanan's ratings do not reflect the desires of most Americans.
"He's doing well because of the sheer ineptitude of others in the race,"
Tsongas said. "The interesting thing about the Buchanan phenomenon is
watching all the moderates go berzerk."
Rather than helping America, Republican moderates are hurting each other,
Tsongas said. "Even a guy like [Republican Senator from Indiana] Dick
Lugar, who I respect, should not be in the race right now."
Tsongas said he was saddened by the choice of candidates in the upcoming
presidential election. "[A few months ago] the only two people I thought
could win were Colin Powell and Clinton, and I haven't changed that view."

Candace Gingrich Defends Queer Rights
By

Heather Ratcliffe

The Oklahoma Daily
(U-WIRE) Accidental gay activist Candace Gingrich, U.S. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich's sister, said Tuesday night that she wants to end discrimination based on sexual orientation, a cause her brother won't support.
"Most Americans are ahead of my bother in supporting gay rights," she said
Gingrich, who is finishing a national tour to more than 50 cities to talk about
gay rights, spoke at the University of Oklahoma to an audience of several
hundred people.
She said her goals include helping end discrimination in the workplace and
in the real-estate industry.
"All we want is a level playing field," she said. "In America, it is ludicrous
to know that there is still a group of people who are legally discriminated
against."
She said she never spoke out against gay and lesbian discriminationbefore
her brother was elected Speaker of theHouse because she didn't wantto "rock
the family boat."
Gingrich said she disagrees with Newt on almost every issue, but they don't
usually talk politics when they visit each other.
She said she didn't vote for her brother and can't support him politically.
"I cannot support any candidate that doesn't think I am worthy of the same
rights and protection as non-gay Americans."
Gingrich encouraged students to get involved in the 1996 presidential
election, because, she said, it will reshape the future of America.
She said she is supporting President Bill Clinton for re-election because he
supports gay- and lesbian-rights legislation.
"He is the only candidate that can say the words 'gay and lesbian' without
spitting," she said.
Gingrich also spoke on behalf of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, a
lesbian and gay political organization.
Anu Pugalia, petroleum engineering sophomore, said he was impressed
with Gingrich and her campaign to raise gay- and lesbian-rights awareness.
T.J. Singleton, Gay Lesbian and Bisexual Association co-chair, said she
was a motivational speaker.
Singleton said he liked that Gingrich doesn't portray her brother as a
monster and admits respectably that she doesn't agree with his viewpoints.

We need more than a protest.
The College Budget Committee has recommended that next year, Swarthmore ask financial aid recipients to earn $ 100 more over the summer than they
did this year, and to borrow as much as $lOOO more than they borrowed this
year. Tomorrow, the Board of Managers will approve, reject, or modify
CBC's plan.
The recommendations—especially those pertaining to summer work—put
an unnecessarily heavy burden on financial aid recipients, and we hope the
Board will seek other options. But unless the Board is offered a viable
alternative, it will have little choice but to approve the current plan.
A constructive counterproposal would tell the Board where it should cut
spending in order to avoid asking aid recipients to work and borrow more. For
example, one could recommend fielding fewer athletic teams, or increasing
the student-faculty ratio, or requiring all College departments to cut their
budgets by some fixed percentage.
Or faculty salaries could increase at a rate slower than that proposed by the
CBC. Swarthmore's policy of setting faculty salaries and benefits at 102.5
percent of what comparable institutions offer seems rather arbitrary; we'd
like to know why 102 percent or 101.5 percent wouldn't be good enough,
although we understand that faculty members might feel otherwise.
Or the Board could consider spending more of the interest income from the
endowment, and reinvesting less. Perhaps it's time to re-evaluate our ex-

tremely conservative endowment spending policies.
This list could go on for pages. Suffice it to say we see no reason why
Swarthmore can't find a few hundred thousand dollars to cut out of a budget
that exceeds $5O million, especially when those cuts would fund something
as important as financial aid.
Cutting any part of the budget would be painful, of course. But it might be
worse for financial aid recipients to give up meaningful jobs away from home
so they can live with their parents this summer and save $ 1700 towards tuition
charges.
Unfortunately, while many students oppose CBC's proposal on these
grounds, few have made a good-faith effort to come up with an alternative.
And although the obstacles to creating an alternative are large, they are not
insurmountable. Students do not have access to all of the information CBC
has—but students can examine the budget for the fiscal year that ended last
June. CBC's plan was announced just two weeks ago, so students haven't had
much time to consider it—but students have found more than enough time to
debate various plans to protest at the Board meeting. Few students are
financial wizards—but students should still be able to state clearly what they
would give up in order not to increase summer work and loan expectations.
Student Council has prepared a petition asking the Board to send the plan
back to CBC "for reconsideration under terms more amenable to substantive
student input." We wouldn't mind if the Board acquiesced, but we doubt it
will: telling CBC to start over on the proposal, which is merely an outline for
next year's budget, would leave little time to write a detailed budget before
the next fiscal year begins.
Student Council's petition, and the silent protest that has been planned to
accompany it, thus seem rather pointless. The petition and protest are not
likely to dissuade the Board from approving CBC' s plan. Nextyear, perhaps,
the College will listen to SC's demand for more open and inclusive administrative procedures—something that we ourselves proposed twice this semester. But because SC's petition does not tellBoard members what they can cut
in order to leave aid untouched, financial aid recipients next year might still
be subject to larger loan or work requirements.
Students, led by their elected representatives, have missed the perfect
opportunity to show the College that they can contribute important ideas to
administrative decisions. While a protest may show that many students are
angry, a constructive proposal would demonstrate that students have good
ideas about the budget. Students do not deserve a place on administrative
committees by virtue of feeling strongly about some issue or by virtue of being
students; they should sit on committees because they have valuable contributions to make and important perspectives to share.
If you are reading this hot off the presses, you have about 18 hours until the
Board meets to come up with a good alternative to CBC's plan. We can only
hope that someone will make areasonable proposal; if someone does, we trust
the Board of Managers will consider it in good faith.

How your computer can become your best friend.
The Sharpies registration process has been a nightmarish experience for
many, the cheerful clowns last semester notwithstanding. This semester,
thanks to the Registration Review Committee, all students will be able to
register for up to 4.5 credits by computer. If the computer has not already
become every Swattie's best friend (who heeds dogs when you have Power
Macs?), it will now.
This new system might reduce the phenomenon of class rivalry evident at
conventional registration, the only time in which Swatties are taunted by
fellow students solely on the basis of the year in which they intend to graduate.
Those of us who cannot bear the thought oflife at Swat with fewer than 4.5
credits will still have to go to Sharpies in person. While this could provide a
welcome break from being confined to the library, it does not constitute an
incentive to take on a larger course load, which in the larger scheme of things
might actually make us all a little bit more sane. Students lotteried out of
courses will also have to make a personal appearance, but at least they will not
feel they are in the middle of a stampede at a European soccer game.

In an editorial last week entitled "Dollars and diversity, now and tomorrow," we
failed to state clearly the difference between a policy of need-blind admissions and
a policy of meeting all admitted students' full financial need.
Underneed-blindadmissions, financial status is not a factor in thedecision whether
or not to accept an applicant. When Swarthmore says that it meets all students' full
financial need, it means thatthe College arranges for all accepted students to attend,
even if they cannot pay in full.
Our editorial stated that the 26.4 percent cap on financial aid funding "has
potentially seriousramifications" forSwarthmore's policy of need-blindadmissions.
This is not true: need-blind admissions does not cost money.
We have never questioned Swarthmore's commitment in principle to meeting full
needand to need-blindadmissions. We worry, though, that if current trends continue,
it will become increasingly difficult for this college to meet students' full need in a
meaningful way—that is, primarily with scholarships rather than loans or workstudy.

Responding to Brian Schwartz: Trying to disprove God's existence raises semantic
To the editor:

I'm not sure that I want to go into
what I see as the logical flaws and
unreasonable assumptions that Brian
Schwartz makes in his latest opinion
piece. I would, however, like to express my dismay at his less-thangenuine-sounding apology at the end
ofthe piece. Here Mr. Schwartz seems
to take a relativist stance inconsistent
with what had come before.
As I see it, the piece in question
makes a number of assumptions to
arrive at a conclusion. That's not so
remarkable. What is remarkable is
the cursory manner in which these
assumptions are made, with no acknowledgment ofhow tenuous those
assumptions are. As far as Mr.
Schwartz claims to be simply presenting an opinion, I have to say that
his opinion here is not well thought
out. In an argument so dependent on
logic and deduction, the validity of
the initial premises is critical. Here,
that validity is lacking. What is so
disturbing is not precisely that his
assumptions are not valid (they might
be), but rather the way that they are
not even recognized as assumptions
at all, or open to question.
Here are some examples of unquestioned assumptions that I would
like to see argued more persuasively:
"TheLaw ofNon-Contradiction says
that an existent being can not act in
contradiction to its nature."
Whose law is this? Which nature
are we dealing with? These are not
simple issues.
'"To exist... is to be an entity of a
specific nature made of specific attributes. . Nothing does not exist.
All things exist... No thing does not

I wonder if theremight be different
types of existence, and further,
whether the distinction between them
is essential. I can think of lots of
things that do not exist in the real
world. Wondrous creatures, characters from fiction, my ideal mate, these
things exist in my mind, but seemingly not in the world. The ideas
exist, no? They have specific at-

tributes and a particular nature. Ideas

Mr. Schwartz to give a conclusive
account of the nature of anything, in
particular a human being.
There is a simple and telling semantic problem here. What does it
mean to say "Nothing does not exist"? Well, it might mean that there is
not one thing that does not exist, or it
could mean thaINOTHING, as a con-

thing which does not exist, we create

difficulties.

Mr. Schwartz states that "People have
every right to believe what they believe, but no right to force others to
act according to their beliefs."
In attempting to avoid dogmatism,
Mr. Schwartz goes too far. It's impossible to talk about his statement

here and avoid a discussion ofrights,
and I don't want to talk about that.
There is too much to say. I'll just say
that this kind of oversimplification (I
almost said "serves no one"; instead,
I'll say that it...) does not serve Mr.
Schwartz's purpose, that is, coming
to some conclusions on these issues.
If he truly believes that no definitive
conclusions are possible, as his final
paragraph implies, then he has no
business submitting an article for publication.

Continuing Concerns Over Financial Aid and Student Representation
To the editor:
Following Student Council's open
meeting where bothLaura Talbot and
Paul Aslanian addressed the student
body on the status of financial aid
planning, many students remained
concerned. Namely, students felt uneasy about the nature of the increases
to self-help aid, the confidential nature of the process by which the CBC
came to this recommendation, and
the nature of the committee's representation. Further, students worried
that maintaining the socioeconomic
diversity of the student body would
no longer be a priority, in light of an
analogy one administrator made between choices of diversity and capital investment. Students strongly felt
that diversity of the student body and
the quality ofeducation are not mutually, exclusive, but that both values
enrich their academic and personal
development in tandem. Students
expressed the strong desire to see the
current policy of meeting 100% of
demonstrated
need
upheld

unwaveringly.
Thus, in following through with
those concerns students expressed, it
was decided by Student Council that,

in order for students' concerns to be
most effectively considered in the
final budget deliberations, it was necessary to draft a petition for presentation to the Board of Managers. In
addition, students were asked to
gather for a silent, peaceful sit-in, as
a visible show of support for those
ideals expressed in the petition.
We wish to express our sincere
appreciation of Swarthmore's commitment thus far in meeting financial
need ofstudents. We support all methods adopted by the administration to
guarantee this commitment to mem-

bers of our community. It is our job as
representatives of the student body to
make sure that student input is considered, taken seriously, and reflected
on all levels of decision-making.
Current restrictions on the amount of
information student representatives
are allowed to divulge have crippled
the ability of committees to receive
accurate and complete input from
students, the population such deliberations directly impact.

Clarifying the Colleges financial aid policy.
To the editor:
In my opinion, the article and editorial dealing with Financial Aid in
the February 23 issue of The Phoenix
were, at best, confusing. Allow me to
clarify two important points:
S warthmore College remains committed to its need-blind admissions
policy. Swarthmore is committed to
meeting the demonstrated need of
every admitted student.
These policies have not changed.
Student need has outpaced the

growth of tuition, fees and inflation,
but the good news is that the CBC
was able to recommend a budget with
financial aid packages which are still
among the very best in the country
for colleges ofSwarthmore's quality.
Building the College's budget requires balancing many competing
demands; our responsibility is to meet
the needs of both current and future
generations of students —a complex,
difficult and hugely important task.

Audience Members Express Mixed Feelings About Play
By

Ben Fritz

Mark

Kenward 'B9 returned to Swat
Thursday, February 23 to present
his one-man adaptation of Herman
Melville's novel Moby Dick. The audience
included both current Swarthmore students,
faculty, and staff as well as alumni who knew
Mr. Kenward during his time here.
Kenward's adaptation provoked very strong
responses from the audience. Some people
raved, giving him a standing ovation while
others, including myself, found the performance disappointing and, in the words of
Dan Fanaras' 99, "difficult to follow" and too

"theatrical."
The main problem I had with the adaptation was that of the six characters portrayed
by Mr. Kenward, only one, Captain Ahab,
had any real life to him. Particularly lacking
in spirit was Ishmael, the narrator and lone
survivor of the entire ideal. Ishmael is supposedly scarred by the events that unfold in

his story, but he came across as a pretty bland
narrator, just telling the events as they happened.
I also did not like Mr. Kenward's overly
dramatic use of props and gymnastics, which
detracted from a serious adaptation of a major work of literature, making the viewer pay
more attention to what was happening rather
than what story was being told.
However, many students had a favorable
opinion of the play. Kelli Tennent '9B reflected the popular view that, "Adapting such
a complex and lengthy work of literature into
a one-man, one-hourproduction takes a lot of
daring and skill, and I think he did an admirable job with it." Scott Timm '99 commented, "Although I was required to see the
performance for my acting class, I ended up
really enjoying it. I felt that his props were an
excellent addition to the performance as they
helped me imagine what was happening more
clearly and presented the dialogue in an interesting visual manner."

Impressive Directorial Debuts
Recent "Night of Scenes"

Performance Highlighted

Three First-Year Directors
By

The

Jessica Harbour

first "Night of Scenes" ofthe spring

semester, presented last Saturday in
Pearson Hall Theater at 2 and 8 pm,

gave three first-years, Kate Bernstein '99,
Simon Harding '99 and Deborah Stein '99, a
chance to make their Swat directing debut.
The production left the directors, actors,
and stage crew exhausted but pleased and the
audience impressed.
Bernstein's adaptation of "Painting
Churches," by Tina Howe, required six actors to play three roles. Kelli Tennent '9B
played an artist struggling with her controlling mother, played by AnjaLandis '97, while
Rich Vezina '99 looked on as the absentminded father; Rebecca Louie '99, Erin
Greeson '99 and Ben Fritz '99 played the
three roles in a flashback scene.
"When looking for a scene," Bernstein
explained, "I knew that I wanted to direct
something that was written by a woman.
Women playwrights have a lot less exposure
in the theatre world and it was important for
me to put female work out there. I also picked
something that had to do with and centered
around women. 'Painting Churches' deals
with a lot of important issues and problems,
like eating disorders and insecurity, that face
young women."
In the play, Fanny Church (Landis) nags
her daughter Mags (Tennent) to improve her
looks and concentrate on finding a suitable
husband; the tone, comedic at first, quickly
shifts when Mags recalls her mother's destruction ofherfirst "masterpiece": a radiator
covered with the colorful meltedcrayon wax.
The play ends with Fanny and Gardner
standing behind Mags as she declares repeatedly, with more and more conviction, "I have
abilities...strong abilities."
For the next scene, Harding actually combined two plays: "That Time," by Samuel
Beckett, and "Wandering" by Lanford Wilson. Jen Weiss '9B and Jim Harker '99 began
as the conscience of Raj Ayyaguri '96, forcing him to look back at his life; then, they
become his tormentors.

Weiss and Harker each take on several
different roles in the second scene, playing
the parts of Ayyaguri's parents, army recruiters, and doctors. Ayyaguri is forced to join
the army, even though he strongly objects to
killing, and would prefer to spend his life
wandering.
"The only real problem I had," said Harding,
"was the lack ofrehearsal time. We had three
weeks to memorize all the lines and get the
show together. That the show came off well is
a tribute to the professionalism of Stephen
Svoboda '9B, our Tech Director, and the
actors themselves."
Weiss agreed: "We ended up performing
three times on Saturday.. .call was at 9am for
dress rehearsal, then a performance [at 2],
then an 8. It was nuts.. .but it's over and we all
felt it went really well." Harding, who is
thinking of becoming a theater major or minor, Weiss, and Harker are all involved with
the upcoming musical "Pippin."
"As the play unfolds, you discover more
about these people and their relationship and
regrets they have," explains Stein of her work,
four excerpts from the play "Sight Unseen,"
by Donald Margulies. "So, at the end, when
they meet, you know what happens and how
they hurt each other . . . that's what was so
powerful to me when I first read it."
The play traces the relationship of artist
Jonathan (Ben Wilder '99) and the "diletante"
Patricia (MC Hyland '99) backwards in time,
from their last meeting to their first.
Stein praised her actors: "It was really
incredible to work with them and discover
things about the characters and the play." In
addition to Wilder and Hyland, Aisha Hobbs
provided the voice of Jonathan's interviewer
in the first scene.
Since this "Night of Scenes" had so little
rehearsal time and even less time to set up
(because of the performance of "Moby Dick"
the night before), many people were all the
more impressed with the performance.
Said Drama Board member Jenny Briggs
'99, "The performances were wonderful and
intense." She added, "Next year the Drama
Board will try to schedule things so they
[will] have more timeto rehearse, to cut down
on stress."
Despite the frantic schedule, all three directors seemed proud of their own accomplishments and those of the actors and tech
crew, especially Svobodaand Stage Manager
Danielle Sass '99.

On-Campus: Johnny Depp Film Festival

Commentary on "Moby Dick"

&

By

Jonathan Evans and Jessica Keith

Jonathan: Oh boy, here we go. Johnny
Depp. You know, as much as this guy
annoys me, I love most of his work...
Jessica: Johnny Depp annoys you? Not
me. I think he's a pretty good actor, not to
mention definitely hot. And the former star
of "21 Jump Street," a great show which I
watched in reruns for a whole summer
straight when I was younger. The show
went all downhill after Johnny left and
Richard Grieco replaced him. But I digress.
The movies in this first Annual Swarthmore Johnny Depp Film Festival are "Ed
Wood" (Friday, in LPAC) and "Don Juan
De Marco" (Saturday, Dupont).
Jonathan: Johnny Depp plays warped,
wacky people better than anyone I've seen.
"Edward Scissorhands," "Benny and Joon,"
"Gilbert Grape"... The man has a style.
Jessica: "Ed Wood" is no exception. His
role as the title character is definitely bizarre. You should know the movie will be
strange with the pairing ofDepp and Director Tim Burton.
Anyways, the film is the true story ofEd
Wood, who was known as "the worst director of all time," creating such infamously
awful movies as "Plan Nine from Outer
Space" and "Glen or Glenda" (both available in McCabe).
The movie chronicles Wood's "ascent"
to notoriety, detailing not only his career
but also his
shaky relationships

Parker)
and Kathy
(Patricia
Arquette),
hj
s
i
transvestitism (a plothne which diminishes

early in the movie), and most importantly,
his friendship with former horror star Bela
Lugosi (Martin Landau).

The movie tries to cover a lot of ground,
and thus gets pretty long. You may be
thinking of skipping this movie if you've
had a long week, but please don't—there is
one big reason to see it: the acting.
Everyone in it is absolutely fabulous. Depp is the
perfect quirky Ed Wood,
Parker is greatas an annoying Dolores, and Landau,
who of course won a Best
SupportingActor Oscarfor
his role, was damn scary in
his portrayal of vampireman Bela Lugosi. The dramatic scenes between
Landau and Depp pretty
much blew me away.
The supporting cast is
first-rate, too, includingBill
Murray, Max Casella
(Doogie Howser's friend Vinny), George
Steele, and Jeffrey Jones. And Lisa Marie
(not Presley) plays a rather interesting
Vampira.
So, basically this is a good movie.
Respectable.A little weird.
Jonathan: I am so there for "Ed Wood."
I've seen "Glen or Glenda"—the worst
movie ever made—and it's hysterical. Add
Tim Burton, and you've got just an incredible set-up for a movie. Can't wait for

cast is exceptional: Depp as the psycho
Don Juan,
Marlon Brando as the therapist that lives
vicariously through him, and Faye

Dunnaway as Brando's wife.
Depp is a man who is suicidal because he
can't have the love ofhis life. He's taken in
by Brando because everyone thinks Depp
is delusional. What ends up happening is
that Brando is
drawn into Depp's
seemingly
fantasticalreality,
and what it takes
to "Really Love a
Woman" to use
Bryan Adam's
words. Dunnaway
gets the benefit of
this new reality as
Brando's wife.
It's a simple
plot, but it's wonderfully crafted.
Brando as a great
psychiatrist, though? The man can't talk
clearly to the audience, much less a patient!
And...well, it's hard to buy his metamorphosis into a great lover unless he tries to
look a little less Dom Deluise-like. And

Off-Campus: Forget About "Unforgettable"
By

lan Bricke

Unforgettable"

is unforgivable. The
big-budget picture from hotshot
director John Dahl ("Red Rock
West," "TheLast Seduction"), it's a nasty,
incoherent, and thoroughly unwatchable
anthology of B-movie cliches. A cross between "The Fugitive" and "Strange Days,"
it stars Ray Liotta as Dr. David Krane, a
Seattle medical examiner with an unhealthy
(and unintentionally comical) obsession
with his dead wife. As the ads put it: "He
loved her. He lost her. He won't let her
memory die...until it tells him who killed
her." David still has the masking tape outline of his wife's body smack dab in the
middle of his rec room carpet.
The good doctor was arrested and charged
with his wife's murder, only to be released
on a technicality. So, he's on less-thanconvivial terms with his police colleagues,
including the ludicrously odious Stewart
Gleck (Christopher McDonald) and the
Chief, Don Bresler (Peter Coyote). Just
about the only person who actually likes
David is his fellow examiner, Curtis Avery
(the übiquitous David Paymer).

All this changes when Dr. Martha Briggs
(Linda Fiorentino), the ultimate in bombshell science dorks, makes her first appearance, fumbling her way through a lecture
on her latest discovery—a serum that allows the user to relive dead people's memories. Within minutes, David is shooting up
pilfered serum, reliving his wife's murder,
complete with wonky camera angles and
distorted filter shots. Martha finds out, confronts him, and gets to tag along as the
movie goes to hell in a handbasket.
Just to keep things ticking, the filmmakers throw in not one, but six, gratuitous
injection sequences, an autopsy, several
remarkably grisly murders, plenty of misogynistic violence, and one of the most
incompetently structured chase sequences
in recent memory. The whole thing ends
with a couple of explosions and a whole
batch of arbitrary revelations. If it weren't
so horrid, "Unforgettable" would be funny.
John Dahl's first two films were just
about great, combining dark wit, visual
flair, and diabolical plotting into deliciously
nasty neo-films noir. "The Last Seduction," in particular, was a treat, starring a
fire-breathing Linda Fiorentino as the last

word in femmes fatale. That's why watching "Unforgettable" is such a depressing
experience. The zip has gone out of Dahl's
directing. Visually, themovie looks good—
Dahl obviously has an eye for vivid lighting and clever compositional gimmicks.
But it's dead on arrival. The wicked zest
that made "Red Rock West" and "TheLast
Seduction" so much fun is nowhere to be
found. Watching Fiorentino this time around
is almost painful. The last thing this woman
needs to do is grow bangs and play the
cookie-cutter Hollywood ditz. Her performance is awful, but with this material,
whose wouldn't be?
Ray Liotta (terrific in Martin Scorcese's
"Goodfellas") looks embarrassed to be
there. His David doesn't make eye-contact
much. When he does, he looks more like a
pathological puppy-dog than the driven
hero this stuff requires.
Everybody involved in this film should
fire their agent, take a couple of years
hiatus, and pray for better luck next time. In
the meantime, I'll try to put the memory of
this turkey behind me. "Unforgettable" has
to be one of the worst movies I've ever
seen. I saw it, so you don't have to.

Controversial, Eclectic Art Collection Features International Masterpieces
By

John Freeman

To

the outsider, Merion, Pennsylvania
seems a likely place for Dr. Albert C.
Barnes's monument to his treasurechest of masterpieces of Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist paintings. The Barnes
Foundation's French Renaissance style mansion and its manicured twelve-acre arboretum plot are deceptively at home among
neighboring estates with families rushing off
to squash games in Range Rovers.
History, however, will tell you a much
different story.
Like how the young Barnes was beat up in

money or how the young medical school
graduate had neither the capital nor friends to
practice as a physician. So it could not have
been a surprise when the art communityridiculed Barnes's controversial display of his

2500 objetsd'art.
During his lifetime Barnes was an outsider
to every circle he came in contact with,
whetherit be modernist painters or fox-hunting Main Line aristocrats.
So when the Foundation attempted a world
tour, no one expected a smooth ride.
Numerous legal battles and $l6 million in
ticket sales later, the Barnes Foundation has
returned to its renovated home after a muchstoried world tour. Anyone who saw the
Philadelphia Museum of Art's conventional
display of Barnes's treasures ought to pay a
visit to the eccentric doctor's arboretum and
museum for a viewing experience unparalleled by any American museum.

sometimes out of the way places (often distinctly out of eye level), one must dedicate
effort in controlling perceptual focus and
letting the picture speak for itself.
There are no lengthy placards interpreting
the paintings for viewers as one might find in
major museums. Rather, the visitor must seek
out labeled diagrams of the walls on benches
situated in each gallery.
Each room of the museum seems to flow
into the next thanks to the beautiful design
done by French architect Paul Cret, who also
designed the Rodin Museum. Upgrades in
lighting have utilized natural light in the
maximum amount of spaces, giving the space
an airy feel. The second floor gallery space to
the left of the balcony landing is perhaps the
most refreshing room for a long break in front
of a painting. Light entering from an overhead skylight complements the lively and
sensual colors of several large Matisse paintings.
The upstairs galleries explore mixing arts
of eastern and western origins; in one room,
nearly 20 charcoal drawings by Picasso are
displayed immediately above sculptures from
various African countries. The gallery next to
that one contained perhaps the most dramatic
of such mixings with a famous Modigliani
portrait hanging above a waist high bust of a
woman from Africa.
Barnes's attempts at studying universal
concepts in art across continents, however
ahead of his time he might have been, are
typically patronizing at best and colonial at
worst. None of the sculptures from Africa are
labeled with the name of an artist, but are

perhaps intended as pieces of "continental"
art. The sculptures are rarely mixed in with
Renoirs or Cezannes, rather they are contained in glass cases like trophies. Add a few
paintings by Rosseau to this mish-mash and
the museum sends a very mixed message as
to the relationship of non-western art to the
overall collection.
Barnes himself lived this contradiction,
alternately inviting promising African-American painters to live and work at his foundation home and then severing ties abruptly.
A powerfully unique and trying experience
in perception can still be had at the Barnes'
Foundation in spite of clouding by the prodigious figure of its benefactor—take a break
from the regular museum scene and step
inside this amazing collection and explore
the masterpieces so long hidden from the

A: I actually have three: Director of Residential Life, Lang Scholar Advisor and
Coordinator of Support for Students with
Disabilities.

Q: How long have you been

at these positions?
A: I have been working at the college for
about 8 years. I have been the Director of
ResidentialLife and Coordinator ofSupport for Students with Disabilities for
three years, and this is my second year as
Lang Scholar Adviser.
Ibegan working at the college in 1987
as director of a summer program for
middle-high school students. I continued
with this for four summers. In 1988, I
began working part-time with students
with disabilities and eventually with fellowships and prizes.
When the current dean went on leave,
I was an Assistant Dean and did a lot of
different tasks. Once Ngina was hired,
the funding for a new position, Director
ofResidential Life, was made available.
I applied, got that job and carried along
the disabilities piece with it. Strangely
enough I have been at the same desk all
these years!

Q: What "magic formula" allows you

to

match compatible roommates so well?
A: I love the way you asked this question
because I see the failures of this office. I
rarely see the successes. I remind myself,
"Well, Myrt, there are only 10 or 12
roommate pairings that did not work out,
so don't feel bad." But I don't have a
stream of people coming in here saying,
"We are friends forever."
The process has evolved over the
years. When I first started, Ted Goundie
had this job. I shared roommate matching with him for two years; I did the
women one year and the men another
year. I read through students' folders,
and a four page roommate questionnaire
which I took notes on and then matched
people.
Then [after becoming Director of
Residential Life] I was doing all the
matching. I decided to use just the roommate questionnaire. The most recent
roommate questionnaire was brought
down to one page containing the essentials. The other Deans and I agreed living
habits were essential along with some
sort of compatibility. My goal was to put
similar roommates together and have a
variety of people on the hall.

a momentous
task?
A: It takes me from about the middle of June
until the middle of August, working
morning, noon and night. I work one
gender at a time. I start by looking at
characteristics. So, for instance I begin
separating by smoking and non-smoking. Then I take smokers who want quiet
rooms. I keep whittling at the piles until
I get a pretty specific pile. Then I match
those withinthe specific piles together. If
there is no match, other piles contain
somebody similar.

Q: What else does your job entail, otherthan

matching and placing roommates?
A: I deal with the people whose roommate
situations are not working. I do a lot of
work with RAs. One of the mandates
when my job was created was to create a
residential lifeprogram with more action
within the dorms. I have been trying to
foster more building-wide activities. This
is a chance for people to interact with
people who aren't on the same team, of
the same major or in the same class.
There arp some people who just don't fit
in on their hall, yet there may be other
people within the building that, if they
met, would connect.
Of course I have the other pieces of
my job: students with disabilities and
helping Lang scholars withtheirprojects.
I also deal with maintenance issues, vandalism, renovation plans, and I work
with the physical plant to deal with tnings
in dorms such as microwaves. I do not
choose the furniture or carpeting!

Q: How was your college experience?

A: It was great! I went to Occidental College, a small liberal arts college in Los
Angeles. Women lived in their own
dorms. There were dorm mothers that sat
at the front desk and guys weren't allowed on the hall. There were hours
when we had to be in and we had to sign
in and out. It was a really different world.
We just didn't have wild shenanigans on
the hall.
I had a roommate for three years. My
freshman roommate I did not choose to
live with again. She was okay, but she
wasn't a good friend. The girls across the
hall became my good friends and I lived
with one one year and the other the following year. I was a good roommate
because I fell asleep very easily.

Q: If you drew the highest number in the

housing lottery, which room would you
choose to live in?
A: I would probably choose a two room
double, or something with a connecting
door. I have lived in a single and I did not
like it. I would like the connection but
the separation as well.

Q: How do you feel about substance-free

housing?
A: I like that at Swarthmore we really don't
have housing by certain categories. I
understand and sympathize with the desire of people to be away from that kind
of party environment. But, I also think it
is important for them to be with other
people. If you segregate the people of
one type, it isolates both sides. On the
other hand, I think it's good because it
lets people know the college values the
substance-free lifestyle. It's all about
watching howother people make choices.
It's a way a person can learn to be assertive about their opinions and learn what's
successful and not so successful.

Q: How do you feel Swarthmore dormitory
life is different from other institutions?
A: The two schools I know best are Bryn
Mawr and Haverford, and the interesting thing about those two places is that
they do not allow roommate changes. If
you do want one, there is a long process
involved. But those institutions also have
honorcodes so there may be more agreement on how one will work through
personal conflicts. I admire those systems where people are committed to
working through conflict, but I don't

of dissection justify the means? Objections
range from the smell of the chemicals to the
cost of the animal's life.
Roger Bellin, '99, who has chosen not to
take the class, feels that by allowing students
to dissect animals, Swarthmore is "supporting an industry that kills the animals," and
says that the policy reflects a "disrespect for
students with ethics."
Others, however, feel quite differently.
Some students, like George Bealefeld '99
said, "This will be the best lab we do all year
and we should do more [like it]."
This delicate issue has become a major
item of debate among some animal rights
groups nationwide. The National Anti-Vivisection Society, for example, offers information for students of elementary schools, high
schools, and colleges on how to object to
dissection in the classroom and where to find
information to learn the material without
going through the process.
To back up their anti-dissection stance,
organizations like this one cite the disappear-

ance of frog populations in the wild due to
collection for dissection, the value of an
animal's life versus the benefit of dissection
to a student not necessarily concentrating in
that area of science, and the existence of
alternatives such as physical and computer
models, videotapes, and illustrations.
The Biology Department is aware of these
concerns. To avoid problems of extinction
and inhumaneanimal farming, the minks are
carcasses that would otherwise be thrown
away by a fur farm, said a departmentspokesperson. As far as alternatives go, the department feels that there is really nothing like
actual dissection.
The college's policy of getting minks from
a fur farm, where they are already killed, has
set many minds to ease, such as that ofBio 2
student MikeMahowald '99, "The minks are
waste products that we are using as teaching
tools. I don't see the cost of the dissection
because we're not destroying any life."
According to one spokesperson for the
department,the dissection lab gets a lot of

lab would deprive students of a unique and
valuable learning tool.

Biology Department respects the choice of
each student in the class to dissect or not to
dissect. Students are permitted to attend the
lab without participating, or to skip it altogether. Such a policy can only be called
equitable, and the only caveat is that each
student is responsible for the material.
Dissection, is an issue of debate in high
schools and colleges across the country. At
Swarthmore, precautions are taken to ensure
that all are satisfied—those with strong objections, people with slight reservations, and
dissection enthusiasts. Swarthmore's policies are another example of the school delicately balancing a precious means ofeducation with the fragile question of ethics.

In other institutions, the residential
lifeprograms are more firmly entrenched.
Williams, for example, has officers who
are elected to provide activities in the
buildings so there is more going on in the
residence halls. This is the direction I
would like to go in. Also, at some other
institutions, there is more faculty and
staffinvolvement. This was another mandate when I was hired, but I am not sure
that is the right thing for here. Students
seem to resist. They have a chance to

Women's Lacrosse Upcoming Games: Men's Tennis Debuts

This week's surprisingly warm

lost five starters to graduation. However, Coach Borbee remarks that regardless of the age of the players, this
team shows better overall skills than
last year's team. As a result, Coach
Borbee plans to adopt a new playing
style that utilizes the skill level of the
players in a team passing game instead of relying more heavily on the
team's athleticism.
"The team will be young, overall,

and will have little experience playing this new style, therefore, our success will be determined by how
quickly we come together as a unit,"
said Coach Borbee.
Under the leadership of co-captains Lara Ewens '96, Nancy
Rosenbaum '96, and Lia Ernst '97
(who returns after missing last season with a knee injury), a cohesive
team seems easily attainable. Also,
former player Julie Noyes '95, who
led the nation in scoring and received
First Team All-American honors
twice, joins the squad as an assistant
coach. She will add to the overall
experience and expertise of the team.
"The team's atmosphere is great.
Karen is incredibly encouraging, and
the team is really patient even with
the rookie players who have never
played before," said rookie goalie
Jaclyn Coutts '99. "Everyone is always patting each other on the back
and really making you feel like a part
of the team."
Over the years, Coach Borbee has
observed
the

Swarthmore's women's lacrosse program from a minimally known team
to a nationally competitive one with
the reputation of a strong solid program. This year,Coach Borbee hopes
to see this team reach its full potential, be a contender for the Centennial
ConferenceChampionship, and be in
a position to be considered for a

Swarthmore Track Teams
Take Third at Conferences

Pole Vaulters Strong in Field Events
By

Eric Pakurar

Theathletes who competed in track
and field last weekenddelivered solid
points to the team total. The biggest
accomplishment was achieved by
Heather Mateyak '97, who set a personal best by more than a foot to take
fifth place in the shot with a throw of
31' 9". Eric Walton '97 also did well
in the shot, throwing the second longest distance of his life (39' 7.75") to
earn seventh place. Also for the
women, Lucy Hunt '96 threw 27'
8.75" to place eighth overall.
In other events, Shan Sutherland
'97 and Sam Paschel '96 finished
one-two in the pole vault against lessthan-admirable competition. Paschel
also contributed a fifth place in the
long jump, and Stephanie Herring
'99 took seventh place for the women
with a 14' jump. Ben Heuston '96
landed third place in the high jump
with a jumpof 5' 10", as did Catherine
Laine '9B and Eric Pakurar '97 in the
triple jump with distances of 33'6"
and 41 '5" respectively.
Despite these huge marks, the terrific potential previously demonstrated by the field squad went largely
unrealized due to several key inju-

ries. The biggest disappointment of
the meet was the absence of Brian
Baird '99, who was forced to the
sidelines by a week-old hamstring
tear. His previous performances set
him up as a favorite in both the long
jump and the pole vault.
Swarthmore also lost Nate Mason
'99, who injured his knee during com-

petition Friday, causing him to forego
an almost certain second or third

place.
Nonetheless, the field events look
solid heading into the outdoor season, with both Mason and Baird almost healed. Their return and the
addition of the discus and javelin
events will be in Swarthmore's advantage when they face Haverford in
the Spring.

Distance Events
Also Very Strong
By

Nevin Katz

Swarthmore's runners provedquite
threatening last weekend as they careened through lap after lap in the
distance events, powered by competitive determination, months ofhard
training, and thecontinuous onslaught
of Swarthmore cheers from teammates.

The first test ofenduranceoccurred
in the women's 5000 meter race,
where Shoshanna Pearlman '9B
seized second overall. Next, Scott
Reents '96 mixed it up in the 1500
arena, running a cool, yet aggressive
race, then throwing on the hot sauce
in the last few hundred meters to
capture sixth place by a nose.
The evening was completed with a
thrilling display of team heart in the
Distance Medley Relays. Danielle
Wall '9B led off in the 800m, establishing a powerful position in the
pack. Stephanie Herring '99 cruised
through the 400 leg, capturing the
few crucial seconds so that the race
would eventually come down to Solai
Buchanan '96 and Alison Schirmer
'97. Maintaining her place for the
first half of the race, Schirmer systematically disposed of runners one
by one in the second half to capture
third for the relay team.
For the men, Wyn Strodtbeck '9B
led off like a maniac, achieving his
first sub-two-minute time of the season. Eric Pakurar '97 flew through
the 400m, maintaining those hardearned seconds, to hand off to GrahamLucks '9B in the 1200m. Reents

Now-legendary coach Ted Dixon led his highly successful program
to Franklin and Marshall last weekend for the 1996 Centennial
Conference Indoor Track and Field Championships. Men's and
women's teams both placed third, even though several of their members were plagued by injuries. The team came home with six individual
Conference Champion titles and the knowledge that only fractions of
a second stood between them and second place. This team has improved dramatically from last year and will continue to excel as the
talented group of first-years gets more college-level experience.

The men's tennis team opened their
season with a pair of dual meets
against Millersville and Kutztown last
weekend. The Garnet prevailed in
both matches, struggling through the
first match and easily coming through
in the second despite the harsh
weather.
There was little intensity on either
side, as this match was used as a
warm up for the rest of the season.
Both foes were NCAA Division II
teams, so they might have been expected to give Swarthmore a run for
their money. But that wasn't the
"I don't think we have ever lost to
them," said George Khalaf '96.
"[Coach Mike Mullan] uses these
matches to help him determine the
lineup for the future."
Swarthmore was also lacking the
presence of Rolex Regional Champion, and second doubles, Ed Ernst
'9B and Nick Slimack '99. The pair
couldn't play because theirparticipation in the Rolex Tournament forced
them to forfeit two matches during
the year. NCAA rules only allow a
certain number of matches to be
played in a year by players. Slimack
and Ernst chose to sit this last weekend because these matches were of
least importance to the Garnet, coming so early in the season.
Swarthmore opened up playing
indoors against Millersville. Swat had
a hard time in the doubles games,
losing at first and second doubles,
and therefore losing the point awarded
for doubles play. John Derdarian '97
andPaul Wachter' 97 won their match

Garnet.
Swarthmore then came on strong
in singles competition. Bolstered by
victories from Khalaf at second
singles, Greg "Doogie" Emkey '99 at
fourth singles, and Gerry Karnass
'97 at sixth singles, they pulled even
despite losses by Barry Mook '96 at
first singles and Roger Warner '9B at
third singles.
The score was tied at 3-3 when
Derdarian closed the door on
Millersville with a straight set victory at fifth singles. In the end, Swarthmore barely squeaked out a 4-3 victory.
In the day's second match, weather
permitted Swarthmore to play on the
outdoor courts, a rarity for a Februrary
match. The temperature was balmy,
but the wind was gusting as the Garnet took on Kutztown.
Swat dominated, shutting out the
visitors 7-0. The lone blemish on the
day was a loss at third doubles, when
Steve Richards '99, who was without
his usual partner Emkey, and Khalaf
fell to their Kutztown opponents.
However, victories posted by Mook
and Warner at first doubles and
Derdarian and Wachter at second
doubles secured the point.
Sweeping the singles play were
Khalaf at first, Emkey at second,
Derdarian at third, Karnass at fourth,
Richards at fifth, and Walkter at sixth.
There was little emotion as Swarthmore easily dispatched Kutztown.
"It was nice to start the season with
easy wins," said Khalaf. "We are a
very young team. Barry [Mook] and
I are the only returning players from
last year who started."

Sprinters Bring Home Trophies on Both Sides at Franklin and Marshall
The Swarthmore College Sprint
Squad had their best season in recent
memory this year, dominating regular season competition and rewriting
both the school and conference record
books in the process. Out of a total of
10 indoor men' s and women's school
records, only two were not broken
this season. This year's team is quite
simply the fastest indoor track team
in Swarthmore College history.
This success is due in no small part
to a group of three women and one
man. For the women.the recordbreaking trio of Catherine Laine '9B
(55m), Danielle Duffy '9B (55m,
200m) and Jill Wildonger '97 (400m)
each now own at least one individual
event school record as well as being
part of the school record-holding
4x200m and 4x400m sprint relay
teams.

Laine took second place in the
Conference Championships 55m (behind a national qualifier), third in the

Triple Jump and fourth in the 200
(27.63). Duffy won the 200 in a
college and conference record time
of 26.93 and took third in the 400
(61.35). Wildonger also broke the
school and conference record, this
time in the 400m, with her winning
time of 60.70. She also took third in
the 200 (27.60), completing an almost perfect sweep for the women in
that event.
These three teamed with Betsy
Davis '96 to crush the field in the
4x200m relay, smashing the old conference record by over five seconds
and winning their race by over 30
meters. Davis also ran in the 55m
Hurdles, where she placed fifth in
9.69 seconds, just ahead of teammate
Stephanie Herring '99 (sixth in 9.70
seconds).
On the men's side it was all Mike.
Mike Turner '96 is the new Centennial Conference Champion in both
the 200 m and the 400m. WhenTurner
arrived at Swarthmore in 1992, the
200 indoor record was an impres-

sive 23.5 seconds. He has broken this
record three times in his college career, which culminated in his final
indoor meet last weekend, when he
ran a22.5 to win the final heat by over
five meters. Turner also pulled off an
incredible upset by winning the 400
(50.93), soundly beating the race favorite from national powerhouse
Haverford.
Eric Pakurar '97 won his heat in
the 400 placing sixth overall in a
time of 53.35. Sam Paschel '96 and
Al Molnar '97 also ran well, taking
tenth (54.18) and fifteenth (56.13)
places respectively. In the 200m,
Chris Hourigan' 96 and Giovi GrassoKnight '9B continued their season
long struggle taking seventeenth and
eighteenth places in the 200m. Kelly
Hauser '99 continues to show great
improvement and should be a major
factor in the coming season.
The men didn't fare as well in the
55m sprint, which was the only event
where no Swarthmore athletes qualified for the final. Decathlete Mason

Men's
Volleyball
Splits Pair
By George Matula

Friends, Swarthmoreans, Countrymen, lend me your eyes for I've got
an awesome story about which to
write. It's a story about a team on the
rise, a team on a mission, a team in
search of itself, a team known as the
Swarthmore College Garnet.
The Garnet had two exciting
matches early this week. After a tough
three-hour practice Sunday night, the
team was prepared to face RutgersCamden.
Led by an athletic middle blocker,
Rutgers took charge early. The
blocker was only 5' 10" but his jumping ability made up for it. Despite an
outstanding hitting display put on by
Dave "The Eliminator" O'Brien '96,
Swarthmore dropped the first set by a
score of 16-14.
The Garnet turned the tide in the
second set. Led by the outstanding
blocking ofGeorge "Cavities" Matula
'9B, the team took charge of the second set. Matula had six blocks for the
match including three stuffblocks in
the second set alone. Emily Shartin
'9B said,"George was a veritable brick
wall. I thought I saw some extra mortar on his jersey." The Garnet took
the set 15-11.
The third and fourth sets, and consequently the match, went to Rutgers
15-11, 15-7. The Garnet lost their
composure and intensity in the face
of superior Rutgers' talent.
The next day, a rejuvenated and
determined team faced an unknown
in Washington College. The
Shoremen's only strength was their
middle blocker, but when he was in
the back row, the Garnet controlled
the flow of the match.
A tremendous bright spot for the
Garnet was outside hitter Amber
"Please Amber, don't hurt 'em" Thompson '97. He had an extraordinary
hitting day driving home a gamehigh 12 kills. Andrew Mast '99 said,
"The man has got the skills to pay the
bills." The match ended 15-5,15-10,
15-7, in favor of Swarthmore.
The Garnet'snext matchis at Tarble
Pavilion on Sunday night at 7:00 p.m.
against Rutgers-New Brunswick. The
team hopes to see you there.

The absence of Freshman Brian
Baird due to injury hurt the team.
Nonetheless Tootel took second in
the 55m Hurdles. Reuben Canada '99
also qualified for the 55m Hurdle
final but had to withdraw with an
injury. The 4x200m team of Turner,
Paschel, Tootel and Canada took

Paschel, Tootel andPakurar tookthird
place in a time of 3 minutes, 28.78
seconds, just 0.1 of a second behind
the hosts.
The sprinters will travel to Florida
on a high note. With many injured
runners returning to training, including major contributors such as Baird,
Canada and Walid Gellad '97, the
spring team should be very strong.
Expectations are high, and everyone
is focused on the Outdoor Conference Championships which will be
hosted by Swarthmore on May 3rd
and 4th.

What is good in life? Ask this of a
Swarthmore swimmer, and he or she
will probably begin reciting something about "crushing enemies" and
"lamentations." Some might even tell
you who your daddy is! Don'tworry,
they haven't all gone insane—the
chlorine is not causing massive brain
damage. It's just the remains of a
weekend-long adrenaline rush that
has left the Swarthmore Swim Team
dry and struggling to catch up on
missed work.
This past weekend marked the end
of the swim season for most of the
members of the team as the swimmers traveled to Lancaster, Pennsylvania to compete in the Centennial
Conference Swim Championships at
Franklin and Marshall's new $l9
million Kunkel Aquatic Center.
Both the men and the women took
second place in the Centennial Conference, outscored
only by defending
champion
Gettysburg College. The men,
however, were a
mere 50 points behind the first place
team —closer than
any other team in
the conference has
ever come to beating Gettysburg.
Swarthmore's
success in the conference meet this
past weekend was its best in recent
years. The team broke many conference, pool, and school records. In
total, 10 conference records were set
by the Swarthmore team. Virtually
every swimmer swam personal best
times and many placed in theirevents.
The highlight of Friday night's finals was Swarthmore's breathtaking
sweep of the men' s and women' s 400
Medley Relays. The Swarthmore
teams of Kris Robertson '9B, Skye

Fulkerson '96, Cathy Polinsky '99
and Jenny Harvey '99 for the women
and Andrew "Shaft" Robbins '9B
Kendrew Witt '96, Justin Herring
'97, and Carl "Peaches" Sanders '9
for the men, slaughtered the compe
tition and set new conference record
with times of 4:04.66 and 3:32.24
respectively. Robbins, Witt, and Ryan
Fruh '99 took three of the top eight
places in the 200 Individual Medley,
while Harvey took third for trie
women in the event. Jill Belding '99
was runner-up in the women's 500
Freestyle.
In Saturday's finals, Swarthmore
quickly resumed its offensive, claiming huge victories in the men's and
women's 200 Medley Relays and
second places in the men's and
women's 800 Freestyle Relays. The
women's team of Alanna Roazzi '99,
S. Fulkerson, Polinsky and Janine
Gent '99 set a conference record of
1:51.03, while the same men's team
as the 400 Medley relay replaced the
conference record
with their time of
1:37.34.
Also on Saturday,
Polinsky won the
100Butterfly with a
conference record
time of 59.26, with
Sarah Werneck '96
following in a close
third. S. Fulkerson,
Harvey, and Erin

time of 52.87 to win the event.
In Saturday's final event, both the
men and women placed second in the
800 Freestyle Relay. The men's team
was comprised of Fruh, F.obbins,
Mark Friedberg '9B, and Sanders,
while the women's team members
were Belding, Liz Hall worth '96,
Harvey, and Polinsky.
Just when the rest of the conference thought that Swarthmore had
nothing left up its sleeves, the team
returned on Sunday to rearrange even
more of the record board! Hall worth
claimed a victory in the women's
1650 Free, the most grueling event in
collegiate swimming. On the men's
side, Swarthmore shocked the rest of
the conference, with Friedberg, Gerry
Kaufman '99, and Julien Lartigue
97 taking threeof the top eight places
in the event.
Robbins won the men's 200 Backstroke in another conference record
time of 1:54.97, while Robertson
placed second in the event for the
women. Swarthmore again exhibited
'

its dominance over the conference in
the breaststroke, as Harvey, S.
Fulkerson, and Werneck took three
ofthe top five places in the200, while
Witt broke another record on the
men's side to win the 200 Breaststroke in 2:10.33.
Swat also owned the 200 Butterfly,
as Belding broke the conference
record and Maria Kaufman '96 finished close behind in third place for
the women, and Herring and Keith
"Oz" Earley '99 took two of the top
eight places in the men's 200 Butterfly.
While this marks the end of the
swim season for most of the team,
some individuals still await invitations to NCAA Division 111 Nationals. Swarthmore has more prospective competitors this year than ever
before. Although the team will not
return to Ware Pool until next fall,
you'll still have to move your trays
aside at Sharpies every evening when
the swimmers sit down for dinner.
The season may be over, but the
legacy continues.

into this season with guarded optimism.
For the first time in more than a
quarter century, the venerable Ernie
Prudente will not be at the helm of the
Garnet Tide. Brad Hoffman '93, an
assistant forthe past two seasons,will
take over the reigns. Joining the staff
will be hitting instructor John
Crawford '93.
Catchers and Infielders: For the
second consecutive season, Andrew
Clayton '96 will don the catcher's
garb. A .200 batter last year, the team
will need some more pop out of his
bat and improved defensive play .Jeff
Spritzer '96 and Andrew Lund '99
will split backup duties and might see
time if Clayton falters.
Matt Wiggins '96 (.245) will once
again man the hot corner, and jackof-all trades Bob Mascia '96 will
startat shortstop. While Mascia's bat
is proven (.305, 2 HR, 24 RBI), he
will have to shine with the glove if the
GarnetTide is to have any chance of
improving in the competitive Centennial Conference.
The slick fielding Jeremy Bonder
'97 will start at second base. Bonder,
an all-conference selection, batted
.294 and had an impressive .980 fielding percentage, which was highlighted by a 77 consecutive errorless
chance streak to end the season. Dan
Johnston '9B (.277) will play backup
at second and short. Matt Grossman
'96 will return to his spot at first base.
After a torrid start, Grossman cooled
off a bit, but still hit .275 (1 HR 16
RBI).
Outfield: This year's outfield will
take on a slightly different look than
last year. Craig Rodner '96 will open
the season in leftfield. Batting lead-

off, Rodner is the table-setter, in much
the same way Vince Colemanwas for
the Runnin' Redbirds during the mid
1980s. Primarily a singles hitter,
Rodner stole a conference record 17
bases in conference games (despite
missing six games), and had 26 in a
row for the season before being caught
in his last attempt.
Pat Straub '97 will patrol
centerfield. Straub carried a big stick
(.326 2HR 22R81) and will be counted
on for bigger and better things this
year at the cleanup spot. Frank Santora
'96 returns after spending last spring
in Italy. Santora, the team's MVP in
1994, will move to rightfield as he
continues to recover from a devastating foot injury suffered during the
football season. Rufus Frazier '99
and Jeff Spritzer '96 provide depth,
with Spritzer a likely candidate for
designated hitter.
Pitching: The foundation of any
successful baseball team is its pitching. There is some talent on the staff,
but it must improve on its 5.52 ERA
and .314 opponent's batting average.
Not all of the spots in the rotation
are set, but it appears as though Chuck
Hudson '96 and Dave Giles '9B have
won jobs. The hard-luck Hudson was
1-9 last year, but posted a more than
respectable 3.77 ERA. Giles, ahighly
regarded transfer from Wesleyan, has
shown much promise in the early
going and should have no problem
adjusting to Centennialplay. The third
spot in the rotation is up for grabs,
with Bonder, Dave Lischer '97, and
Sam Voolich '96 all in the hunt.
Newcomer Ben Sousa '9B will
likely assume the role ofcloser. Sousa,
sidelined last year because of knee
surgery, has a very good fastball—a
desirable trait for a closer.
Final Analysis: From a realist's
standpoint, I would expect the Garnet Tide to finish at or around .500
this season. For this to happen they
need several things; offensive consistency, fewer errors, and better
pitching. Also, a good start in nonconference play could give the Garnet Tide the confidence boost they
need to compete in the rough-andtumble Centennial Conference.

Men's Lacrosse Scrimmages
By

Pat Donaghy

After just one month of preseason,
the reign of new coach Pat Gress
began with a bang in a scrimmage
against Harford Community College
in Maryland last Sunday. Heading
into the scrimmage, the team was not
looking for a great performance
against the tough junior college, but
was instead trying to find an identity.
Coming off a 4-10 season and having lost their top offensive and defensive players, the Garnet are very thin
and inexperienced. With barely
enough experienced players to field a
competitive team, the team was not
sure ifthey would get blown out or if
they could put up a fight. But strong
coaching paid off, as the Garnet ran
away with a 8-7 victory in the gamelike scrimmage. Additionally, manup offense and man-down defense
both performed exceptionally well,
considering there has been little practice time attributed.
Offensively, Coach Gress has
molded the team into a cohesive unit
in a very short time. Instituting plays
for the first time in years, the Garnet
has learned to work the ball patiently
while looking for an open shot. Patience and execution are necessary
for the success of the team, as they
will usually be outskilled. The Garnet has quickly learned those ingredients to success, going through countless hours of drills in which the plays
are run until they become second
nature.

In the scrimmage, these plays were
executed very well, allowing the offense to control the ball for the majority of the game and creating excellent
shots. Senior attackmen Ben Seigel,
Will Craig, and Eric Griffinall played

outstanding while sticking with the
game plan and running through the
plays. Senior midfielders Andy Place
andDave Sturtevant were able to find
the back of the net on feeds from the
attackmen. Altogether, the attack and
middies have been working well together and will form an offense that
will keep the Garnet close in most
games.
Defensively, rookie goalie Elijah
Porter '99 made many outstanding
saves in his first collegiate experience. Porter really stepped it up when
it counted as well, stopping numerous mid range shots in the second
half. Seniors Nick Milligan and
Charles Horton played outstanding
defense. Milligan, besides being quick
with the stick, punished many Harford
players with bone-jarring hits. Defensive middies Alex DeShields '9B
and Tom Hooper '96 disrupted the
flow of the Harford offense. Overall,
the defense shut down the Harford
offense, allowing few shots and creating many turnovers.
This victory shows the dramatic
improvement that Coach Gress has
brought to the lacrosse program. Indeed, the first-time head coach has
been able to work extremely well
with what he has. The team may not
be as talented as others, but will work
harderand play smarter, two attributes
which Gress has used to his advantage in practice. And practice has
paid off well so far. We'll see exactly
where the team stands after theirfirst
two contests, against Division II West
Chester (#9 in the country), and Division I Drexel, a scholarship school.
These tough early matches are a good
warmup to the Centennial Conference matches, noted as one of the
toughest conferences in the country.

Danielle Duffy had, as usual, an outstanding weekend at the Centennial Conference track meet. Duffy won the 200-meter dash with a
blistering time of 26.93 seconds, a new conference record; placed third
in the 400-meter dash with a time of 61.35 seconds; and ran a crucial
leg in the winning 4x200 relay team which shattered the conference
record by a full five seconds.
Captain Betsy Davis '96 commented, "In practice, Danielle leads by
example. She takes any workout that [Coach] Ted Dixon can dish out
and eats it up. Her ironic sense of humor spices things up during
recovery laps. Her recent success especially illustrates her dedication
and talent in track."

Mike Turner has had a phenomenal season in indoor track which was
capped by an especially outsanding performance at the Centennial
Conference Championships on Saturday. Turner won gold medals in
the 400 m dash with a time of 50.93 seconds, and the 200 m dash with
a time of 22.73 seconds. Both first place finishes also gave Turner new
conference records. In fact, in the 200 m he broke the record by .4
seconds and in the 400 m he broke the record by .05 seconds.
These victories came as no surprise to the Indoor Track team and
Coach Dixon given that Turner has been performing consistenly well all
season long, winning events weekly throughout the season and setting
records consistently.

Kendrew Witt '96

Skye Fulkerson '96

Skye Fulkerson has been one of Swarthmore's most consistently
successful swimmers for four years. She has qualified for Nationals
twice before and broken several school and conference records. At last
weekend's Centennial Conference swim meet, Fulkerson qualified for
Nationals and set a Conference record in the 100 Breast, 200 Medley
Relay and 400 Medley relay. For the second straight year, she took
home the gold in the 100 Breast.
As a captain of the swim team this season, Fulkerson concentrated
both on improving her own swimming and encouraging her teammates
to reach their goals. Her personal effort payed off, as can be demonstrated by her individual and relay championships. The team as a whole
faired well at the meet, racking up a second place finish behind
Gettysburg.

Kendrew Witt has also had an amazing swimming career at
Swarthmore which was topped off by several resoundingly successful
swims at the Centennial Conference Championships. For the second
year in a row, Witt qualified for Nationals in the 100 Breaststroke and
won the gold medal.
Witt served as a captain of the swim team this season, and, when
asked whom he would nominate for athlete of the week, replied by
naming several of his teammates who had strong swims. "Alex Huk,
Ryan Kennedy, Fred Gerson, and Tarek Radwan," he said. "Although
this award is typically given to individuals, I am nominating a group
because it emphasizes the importance of a collective effort in team

sports."

Clearly, Witt's skill in the water is matched only by his dedication to
his team and teammates.
