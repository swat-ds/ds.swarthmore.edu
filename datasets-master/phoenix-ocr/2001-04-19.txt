SASS members meet with
college, borough officials
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
In response to student claims of racially motivated mistreatment by the police, distressed students have made it their
objective to open communication between the campus and
the police, raise general awareness about past discrimination and clarify the events of two weeks ago.
The Swarthmore African-American Students Society
(SASS) has been spearheading efforts to make the college
community aware of the claims of discriminatory treatment

some students have made.
In addition to other general requests to improve relations
between black students and the police, SASS member

Brandyn White 'O3 said that the group decided yesterday to
request that the police department make a formal apology
for the disputed incidents involving police questioning of Nii
Addy 'O2, Prince Achime 'Ol and Sanjay Richards 'O3 that
occurred two weekends ago. White said SASS has been deliberating whether to ask for an apology since shortly after
the incidents.
SASS will make its request at a meeting with college administrators and borough officials today at 2 p.m.
"We're requesting the apology because we believe that
the students were improperly treated by the Swarthmore
Borough Police and that treatment was specifically discriminatory treatment based on race," White said.
Rodney Morris 'Ol, an organizer of the awareness walk
and speak-out held last Friday, said concerned students must
engage others "intellectually and emotionally" and "make
them allies of the cause" beyond the limits of what he felt
was the usual two-week period during which students ordinarily become angry and concerned about community issues at the college.

expressed eagerness to improve communication and interMichael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Road toward the train station. At times,
the line stretched for nearly two blocks,

Over 60 students gathered to march
in an "awareness walk" organized by
the Swarthmore African-American Student Society (SASS) beginning at 3 p.m.
on Friday. The walk and subsequent
"student speak-out" occurred in response to the recent accusations some
students have made of racial prejudice
in actions of the Swarthmore Borough
Police Department last weekend.
The walk began with a moment of
silence that was meant to help participants focus, said Rodney Morris "Tjl, "one
if the organizers of the two events. He
stressed that the walk would be a silent

with reporters and photographers from
various newspapers in tow. The marchers proceeded under the SEPTA station
and into the Swarthmore business district. Onlookers near Park Avenue
stopped and stared at the protesters,
while SASS members hurried to distribute small flyers asking residents to
help raise awareness of what they
called "police officers' discriminatory
practices." The flyers claimed that
there has been a history of negative
incidents involving black students and
the Swarthmore police. The flyer
claimed that black students have been

'hunni and borough

residents who sup-

ported the protest. SASS had contacted
■he police department in advance about

he walk, and officers had stationed

hernselves at many of the intersections,

'topping traffic to allow the students to

In addition, three SASS members

vith Public Safety and with each other.

sponse to complaints about racial harassment.
Continuing down Chester Road, the
marchers continued to attract the interest ofonlookers, and cars slowed as they
passed the line of protesters. Several
cars honked, apparently in support, as
they passed, and many residents came
out of their houses to watch the procession. The group turned east onto Yale
Avenue, and drivers, stuck behind the
long line of protesters as they crossed
Cornell Avenue, left their cars to discuss

the march.

Nancy Mudrick,

a borough resident
who witnessed the protest, seemed
somewhat ambivalent about the issue.

"It's not like it used to be in the old
were friends with
all.the kids in town," she said as she
looked over a flyer. "I never knew there
days, the police, they

was a problem."

The protesters circled near the police station twice, accompanied by borough Police Chief Brian Craig and other
officers to stop traffic. Several volunteer firefighters came out of the garage
and watched as the procession passed.
After a short break, Hernease Davis
'O4, a SASS member, offered a prayer to
begin the Student Speak Out. Soenda
Howell 'Ol, president of SASS, summa-

rized the students' concerns with the
recent incidents between black students and the police department. "Last
weekend," Howell said, "police violated
the privacy and security of black stu-,
dents. This is the most recent incident
in a general trend of discriminatory
practices."

Their ultimate goal, Howell said,

was "to achieve fair treatment." She emphasized that "this is not a time for confrontation or accusation, but a way for
the Swarthmore community to hear our
first-hand accounts." The first speaker

action between the college and the department and invited
students to speak with him about concerns.
Last Thursday, Delonte Gholston 'O2 met with Craig to
discuss the incidents of April 8. "I went to deliver a letter
from SASS to the chief, and heinvited me in," Gholston said.
"We chatted a bit, and he told be about his willingness to be

open to meet with the college community and students."
Five students, two deans, borough mayor William S.
Cumby and President of Borough Council Ed Gerner are
planning to meet with Craig soon to discuss the issue of
police discrimination and identify possible long-range so-

lutions.
Achime and Addy, the students who said the police illegally entered their home and mistreated thembecause they

were black, had a conversation with Chief Craig on Friday,
accompanied by Tedd Goundie, associate dean of the college
for student life, and Maurice Eldridge '6l vice president of

the college, Eldridge said.
Craig has since continued to investigate the alleged illegal entry and has admitted that a police officer did enter Addy
and Achime's apartment. Officer Thomas, who was present
on campus that night, had initially denied any entry.
Officer Poggi, who also went to the apartment that night,
said he attempted several times to knock on the open door,
then entered the apartment, according to Chief Craig.
At the speak-out last Friday and the roundtable discussion at the Black Cultural'Center on Monday, SASS
encouraged students to share stories of perceived ra-

cial discrimination with the police.

(See

"Students or-

ganize in response to claims of discriminatory treatment" pg. 3)
A "Know Your Rights" educational session is slated to
take place in the BCC tonight from 6 to 8 p.m. Attorney Paul
Messing will give an overview of racial profiling as a civil
rights issue and provide information on safety and individual
rights when confronted by the police. Messing works for the

law firm that is currently representing the plaintiffs in the
New Jersey racial profiling case.
SASS has also made an effort to address concerns
that the police were acting out of an obligation to find
the three men, all of them black, who assaulted Randy

Keim 'O2. Some students believe the incentive to track
down the three men Keim described partially or fully
validated the actions of the police.

Two students' assertion that policemen illegally

BY ANASTASIA

Sanjay Richards 'O3 has claimed that Swarthmore police entered his dorm
room at around 3:30 a.m. without a warrant or permission on Sunday, April 8.
He is also maintaining that the police searched him and his friend Courtney
Edwards, who is not a Swarthmore student, for drugs and weapons. Then, he
says, the police took them to the Mertz dormitory so that Randy Keim 'O2, who
had been assaulted at 3:17 that morning, could identify them as his assailants.
Keim said neither Edwards nor Richards had anything to do with the attack.
Richards hesitated to make any judgments as to whether his treatment
was racially motivated. He is unsure about whether he will take legal action
against the police department.
Swarthmore police chief Brian Craig has said that he does not know
whether it will be necessary for him to speak to Richards.
Richards and Edwards had been at the Delta Upsilon party on Saturday
night. After returning to Richards' room in Willets, they called the college
operator and told her they needed a cab to Philadelphia, requesting the numbers of taxi companies. The operator asked Richards how many people needed
a cab and then put him on hold, Richards said.
The police said the operator then radioed them with Richards' dorm and
room number. Keim had told the police department earlier that he believed
his assailants were not Swarthmore students. Richards said he was still on the
phone with the operator when he heard the door to the hall swinging open. "I
heard people running in the hallway," he said.
From his room, Richards heard someone asking on the radio for
comfirmation that the room whose occupants had made the phone call was
really 204. The information was verified, Richards said. Then a policeman
pushed open the door. "My door was not really closed, but it wasn't wide
open either," Richards said. The police officer "had his flashlight and his
hand on the gun and said, 'Drop everything.'
Officer William Thomas disputed Richards' account. "I went to Willets,
where I spoke to two people," he said. "They were fully clothed. The door was
"

fully opened."
Craig said Thomas was the only Swarthmore policeman at Richards' door.
Other police officers who may have been present would have had to come
from other local departments, he said.
The police officer was still outside the door when Richards dropped the
phone receiver. He said he saw four officers standing in the hallway. Thomas
denied that any officer entered the dorm room. "I did not enter. I didn't violate anybody's rights," he said.
Richards said one of the police officers entered the room and wokeEdwards
with a flashlight. "He told us to get outside," Richards said. After the two
students were out of the room, the police officers "shoved us up against the
wall," he said. According to Richards, he and Edwards were told to keep their
hands on the wall as they were searched. An officer asked them whether they
had any weapons or drugs on them.
Craig said the search was normal procedure. "They were patted down
because they were being placed in a police vehicle. It's standard procedure,"
he said, adding that, at this point in the night, Richards and Edwards were
suspects in the investigation of the assault on Keim.
When a Willets Resident Assistant came into the hallway, "they told her
we were suspects," Richards said. "They did not tell us why we were being
searched." When the RA came, "that was the first we heard" of the police
officers' reason for coming, he added.
According to Richards, after the police finished searching the two of them,
an officer contacted other police on a radio to ask for the physical descriptions that Keim had given. "When they searched us, that's when they radioed
for descriptions," Richards said.
Thomas said that he was aware of some similiarties in the appearances of
Richards and Edwards before he even started speaking to them. "I saw two
black males fitting the general description [inside the room]," he said.
Keim had described one ofhis assailants as a black male with glasses and
cornrows, approximately 5'10" tall and weighing about 230 pounds. The other,
he said, was a black male, 6'l" tall, about 190 pounds, who was wearing a
bright orange fleece. The third assailant, Keim said, may have been a black
male, approximately 5'10" tall and of stocky build.
Richards is a black male who is approximately 5' 10" tall, but he has an
afro hairstyle and was dressed in black and white clothes. Edwards is also
black, stands at s'B" and was wearing clothing similar to Richards.
An officer requested Richards' permission to search his room for an orange fleece after being told the assailant had worn such an item, Richards
said. After he gave consent, the officer went through dresser drawers and the
closet but did not find the garment, Richards said.
"The cop said, 'Come take a ride with us, guys,'" Richards said. "He didn't
tell us where we were going."
Thomas disputed this report, claiming that both of the suspects had been
told they were going to Mertz and had consented tobeing taken there. Richards
said the police officers took his and Edwards' driver licenses while they were
in the car. After arriving at Mertz, the police asked the two men to stand
outside, Richards said. He said there were police officers both inside Keim's
room and outside with him and Edwards.
Richards said the police asked them to move closer to the dormitory, so
that their noses were almost touching the glass, because Keim could not see
them. The police asked Keim to identify them, both suspects in assault at the
time. The police said Keim told them Richards and Edwards were not the
men who had attacked him earlier that night.

entered their home and mistreated them because
of their race has sparked additional testimonies in
which black students claimed to have encountered
racially motivated treatment in the past.
But for all the history that students say predated
the claimed illegal entry two weekends ago, only
one person has registered an official complaint
about police mistreatment in recent years.
A speak out organized by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society (SASS) last Friday
allowed students to share stories about what they
perceived as discrimination on the part of the police. These included tales of police not responding
to ongoing racist harassment, denying an escortto
a student who had been subject to racist name calling, frequently stopping a black student while driving, and asking a black student, but not his white
friend, for identification without telling him why
(see "Students organize in response to claims of
discriminatory treatment," pg. 3).

Students and administration invested in addressing police discrimination hold varying views
on why students have been loath to complain openly
about claimed mistreatment and why they have felt
angered
or empowered enough to bring their
tales to light in recent weeks.
"People's tolerance for these occasions can hit
a threshold," Vice President for College and Community Relations Maurice Eldridge '6l said regarding issues of racial discrimination. Eldridge has
been acting as a liaison between the administration and students who are alarmed at claims against
the police. He has also offered to accompany those
planning to meet with Chiefof Police Brian Craig.
The lack of awareness about students' experi-

ences with racial discrimination may have been a

product of those experiences being "not as sensational" or as serious as the illegal entry of April 8,
said Black Cultural Center director Tim Sams.
Sams did point out that, among the black community, "racial profiling has been a real, huge issue in the last year" although "it hasn't been elevated to a campus-wide discussion."
Eldridge added thatthe events oftwo weekends ago
may have "triggered responses from people's memories." He did point out that he had listened to and
worked with Moriah Radin 'O2, who had approached
him in response to ongoing racial harassment ofherself and her boyfriend Nii Addy 'O2, who is black, at
their off-campus apartment. The harassment included
having their cars keyed and receiving a sign said
"Nigger don't park here." Another sign criticized their
relationship because it was interracial.
"Our cars were covered with garbage, flour, eggs,
kitty litter ... our apartments were buzzed, and nobody would be there," Radin said, explaining that,
after repeated calls to the police department, the police were "concerned, but they never did anything."
The police told her she and Addy had "obviously done
something to piss off our neighbors," Radin said, and
that maybe the two should move.
Radin emphasized thatshe did not want to "brand
the police department as racist or ineffective." Although Radin's experience prompted her to speak
with students, deans and Chief Craig about discrimination issues well in advance of the illegal entry,
she is the only one who has taken pointed action.
Rodney Morris 'Ol, who wrote a letter to The
Phoenix last week accusing the campus of blindness to the discrimination that he and other black
students have incurred, said students' reluctance
to report what they perceive as civil rights violations may come from a sense of shame.
"These aren't experiences students are proud
of," he said. Morris also described a confusion about

what actually constitutes racially motivated treatment
a confusion that can deter students from
speaking up.
"You sit there for three hours and try to figure
out if it was a racial issue," he explained.
Radin, who has been "trying to gauge the relationship between the police department and campus students, specifically minority students" all
year, said she has spoken to people who have felt
they have been mistreated but are unwilling to la-

treatment as racially
suggested
ambiguity
causes many
to steer
some
racial issues. Because racial harassment is not something most non-minorities personally undergo, he
said, they generally do not feel as compelled as minority students to "ask [themselves], 'Was that a racial issue?'" But racial and ethnic discrimination "are
concerns and are problems for minority students."

Strides that the United States has experienced
in improving civil rights may also lead students to
keep their complaints about racism to themselves,
Morris said, citing the subtle discrimination minorities feel today as opposed to the overt segregation and humiliating treatment largely accepted
in America less than forty years ago
as the reason some discriminatory acts are "hard to identify."
But many minorities develop a "heightened sensitivity" to instances of discrimination, having encountered many of them in the past, Eldridge said. He
pointed to black men in particular, explaining that "if
you're a young black male living in America, chances
are you've experienced this [targeting by the police]."
There also exists a sort of jaded indifference that
may prevent students from wanting to share their stories with the public or administration, said Brandyn
White 'O3. White has been investigating students'
claims of police discrimination for the last two weeks.
"Some people say, 'lt'll keep happening here even after I leave, so why bother [protesting]?'" she said.
Furthermore, allowing oneself to reflect and act
on discriminatory treatment can often become a
burden in itself. "You're a student at Swarthmore
College, you have a heavy workload, you need to
graduate," Morris said. "If you let these things consume you, they consume you fully."
Still other students are simply averse to causing more trouble with a police force they already
feel at odds with, White said.
Morris said he felt this way when a professor
asked him and some black classmates to "temper"
their views on urban education because they were
making white students uncomfortable, thereby stifling discussion. Morris, who saidhe had "real opinions" on the urban experience because he had lived
it, felt the professor's request had rendered him "not
allowed to own my experience," although he understood her aim to improve dialogue in the class.
Though the black students in the class felt the professor had mistreated them based on their race, they
were disinclined to brand and confront her as racist,
acknowledging that sometimes people do not intend to
be racist but "just don't know any better," Morris said.
The accounts of racist treatment that students
are now publicizing have focused almost exclusively
on events of the past four years and on the borough
police. But Eldridge said there were complaints
about a decade ago, when students noticed Public
Safety singling out "black males in particular."
Morris attested to "a handful" of such incidents
with Public Safety, citing interrogation about
crimes involving other black students and having
to show identification as examples. He also said that,
when he and a black friend were subject to racial
slurs and were concerned for their safety over the
summer, neither the police nor Public Safety would
provide an escort for them, each saying that the
problem was not under its jurisdiction.

Discussions organized
to help clarify events
From EFFORTS, pg. 3
At the BCC roundtable, SASS members and other concerned students repeatedly raised the point that when examining the police's behavior in trying to solve the crime,
the seriousness of the assault that had taken place needed
to be taken into account. Keim had been invited to the event
to clear up any myths about his experience as an assault
victim and what he had told the police about Achime. He
explained that he had given the police a list of students,
most of them Delta Upsilon brothers, who might have
known something about the three men who had attacked
Keim. He emphasized that he had never namedAchime as
a possible suspect and that his list included both white
and black students. Many SASS members also asked those
present at the roundtable to spread the word about what
had happened to Keim, Achime and Addy without sensationalizing the events.

Eldridge described the situation as "tricky to think

about." Because it was three black men who attacked
Keim, Eldridge said, "it isn't off the mark for police to be
looking for information fromblack people." But, he said,
it was important to examine whether the police interrogated Achime and Addy "as if they were seeking information or as if [the students] were guilty of something."

was Brandyn White 'O3, who read a

and her black friends had a flat tire on
ChesterRoad in the middle of the night.
A police officer approached, she said,
but only stopped after she ran after his
car. "I tell him my tire popped and I'm
not sure what to do. He says, 'I don't
care what you do, but you need to get
this car off the road.'" She said the officer only reluctantly agreed to follow
her back to campus in her disabled car.
Davis read the testimony of Sanjay
Richards 'O3, who claims his dorm room
was entered by police two weekends ago.
(See "Richards: police entered, searched
without warrant," pg. 5).
"A police officer comes in through
my door with a hand on his gun," he
said. "Another wakes up my friend with
a flashlight. Then we were put up
against the wall and searched." The
police, Richards wrote, were told that
the suspect wore orange fleece. After
allowing the police to search his room,
where they did not find an orange
fleece, he and his friend were forced to
go to Mertz. "They asked Randy [Keim
'o2] to identify us," he wrote. "After
about five minutes, he gave a negative
ID." Despite this, the police still took
down the names of Richards and his

prepared testimony from Prince

Achime 'Ol, one of the students involved last weekend in what some
students assert was illegal entry of
his off-campus apartment and racially prejudiced treatment by
Swarthmore police officers.
In the last four years, White read,
Achime has been pulled over eight
times by the police. He has been
stopped for not using his turn signal
and for playing excessively loud music.
In the statement, Achime alleges
that he was arrested in Wharton last
year without hearing his Miranda
rights, and that, while walking on
campus with a white student, he was
asked to show his ID by police, while
his friend was not. To the police,
Achime wrote, "my name is synonymous with problems on campus. I'm

He also addressed the fact that jurisdictions in the
Swarthmore borough overlap with other local police
departments and with Public Safety on campus, especially when backup is needed. Some of the police whom
students say have discriminated against them do not
necessarily report to Craig.
Once the actions of the police havebeen investigated
thoroughly and the police department has taken an official position, Craig willpresent it to other local chiefs,
he told Gholston last Thursday.
Members of SASS said their organization had nothing to do with the posting of the "Cop Watch Bulletins,"
which claimed students had been subject to racial profiling. In fact, SASS has pointed out that the experience
ofAchime and Addy was not racial profiling but racially
motivated mistreatment, or discrimination. Craig said
he was disappointed that no one had asked to speak with
him before the bulletins were put up.
Craig said the discrepancies in the accounts given
by Addy and Achime and the accounts given to him by
officers Poggi and Thomas are "he said, she said" claims
at this point. "The differences are difficult for me to deal
with right now when there are such consistencies in
what they are telling me," Craig said.
Although SASS has not outlined specific objectives for
the meeting with Chief Craig, the notion of sensitivity or
discriminationtraining has been raised by many students.
Craig attended a seminar on racism in 1999 but said that
other officers have not had similar opportunities.
The ad hoc student committee has also discussed

analyzing statistics from the police department that may
pertain to racial profiling and perhaps having the police and Public Safety talk with freshmen during orientation about their role in college life.
Craig has provided police records that track drivers
who were pulled over for traffic violations, broken down
into different demographic groups. He said he wants to
make the data freely available to be interpreted. He emphasized that the department has been sensitive to issues
like racial profiling for a while. "It's not like it took this
incident for the department to take a look at these things.
"From my perspective," Craig said, "The department

Science center plans presented
BY ELIZABETH

WRIGHT

With the groundbreaking for an $BO million new science center only a few months away, members ofthe planning committee held a fireside chat Wednesday night in

Kohlberg to present the nearly finalized plans for the
center to the college community. Students who attended
the chat posed questions about the practical features of
the building, expressed curiosity about the ecologically
friendly construction details and asked about the filmshowing capacities of the new lecture halls.
The planned science center will resemble DuPont in
that it will be a low structure meant to blend in with the
Crum woods. It will be larger than DuPont, however,
and it will connect with Cornell. There will also be a
new structure in front of Cornell that will include a 200seat and an 80-seat lecture hall.
Construction workers will demolish large sections
ofDuPont late this fall, but the building will not be leveled entirely. In response to a student's aesthetic concerns about how much of the existing building will be
visible after construction is complete, Vice President

Vans like this shuttle have a high rollover risk, a study says.

U.S. Transportation
Dept. issues safety
warning on vans
BY JON EHRENFELD
In a new report, the United States Department of Transportation has concluded that the type of fifteen-passenger vans that
are commonly used by colleges as shuttles are liable to roll over
in the event of a crash. The study, which was released in early
April, pertains to most of the vans Swarthmore uses.
The study was begun and performed by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a division of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Using data from fifteen-passenger van
crashes last year, the report said, "These crashes have raised the
question as to whether fifteen-passenger vans, especially loaded
fifteen-passenger vans, are unusually susceptible to rollover."
Jim McKenna, the motor pool foreman for the facilities department, acknowledged that the college is aware of the warning about the vans. "Somebody's decided that these vans roll
over easy," he said.
The college uses Ford Econoline and Dodge Ram vans, both
of which have been included in the list of vans likely to roll
over in the event of a crash. McKenna said, however, that he
was not aware of a recall notice from either company.
College vans are often loaded to capacity with people and equipment, both for shuttling and transportation to sports games. It is
in these fully-loaded vans, the study concluded, that the risk of a
rollover was highest. Loaded with fifteen people, the vans are six
times more likely to roU over than with a load of five people.
Because of the likelihood of a rollover, which often results in
death or serious injury, the college will be changing some procedures for its vans.
In the near future, a meeting will be held to come up with
ideas on how to minimize the danger to van drivers and passenger. "We are all going to discuss it," said Karen Mazza, auxiliary services assistant.
McKenna said that a meeting would be held when Vice President
Tor Facilities and Services Larry Schall returns from abroad, either
this week or next. "I think it's important we talk about this," he said.
Despite the fact that the college has no history of accidents
with the vans, the new information warrants takingprecautionary measures, McKenna said. The next time student drivers are
trained to drive the vans, he said, there will certainly be an
added component which addresses the new study. As well as
increased training, he said, there will be additions made to the

for Facilities Larry Schall responded, "Not much."
Major changes will include additionaloffice space, seminarrooms for each department with floor-to-ceiling chalkboards, improved lab facilities and a large commons area.
Planning for the new science center began five years
ago, when the college underwent a process to determine
what its greatest future needs would be, Merz said. The
number-one need that emerged from those discussions
was creating improved science facilities.
The existing science facilities are all quite old. Martin
was built in the 19305, DuPont in the 1950s and Cornell in
the 19705. The architects were challeged to integrate the
three very dissimilar science buildings in a manner that
would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
When making plans for the science center, which as
of yet has no official name, members of the committee
visited a wide range of other colleges to compare science facilities. While Merz said many colleges are opting for large, block-like science buildings, the committee decided a low, spread-out structure would be the best
choice for that location on campus.
Schall said the early stages of construction have already begun, referring to the large trees in front of
DuPont that have been transplanted to other locations
on campus in recent weeks. Construction will begin in
earnest early this summer
with the installation of underground piping and wiring needed for the new
building, which will be

hangout," but instead intended to help draw students to
the north side of campus.
improving safety in the labs was a large concern, especially for the chemistry department. This was one of
the most complex aspects ofthe design process, Merz said.
The computer science department will have a computer room that will be open in some form at all times.
The biology department will have new labs for introductory courses in the new building in front of Cornell. The
center's architects are planning a new observatory space
for the roof of the physics and astronomy department's
wing and on the installation of several small telescopes.
The planning committee has also focused efforts to
have the new science center built in an ecologically

By late fall, Schall said,
construction will be
heavy. "Part of the north
campus will be a mess,"
with the construction zone
extending about twothirds of the way from
Cornell to Kohlberg. "The process will be disruptive,"
he warned. "It's not a painless process."
Presentation attendee Ilya Leskov 'Ol said that many
of the planned features excite him, especially the commons area and the outdoor classroom, but he is glad he
will not be around for any of the construction.
Later on in the construction process, workers will
gut Martin, and a large seminar room and offices will
replace what is currently Kirby lecture hall. Wings of
the new science center will open as they are completed.
The math department will experience the longest
displacement, as its wing will be the first to be torn
down and the new math space is scheduled to open last.
For the next few years, the department will move to
two houses behind Papazian on Whittier Place.
Unique aspects of the center will include devices on
the roofs to channel rainwater through a series of visible effects, including a rain stair and fountain. Black
granite will be used to create three outdoor chalkboards,
giving professors one more reason to hold classes outdoors in good weather.
A commons area, meant to as a student gathering
area similar to Kohlberg coffee bar, will be another component in the science center. It is expected to be completed in January of 2003. Beth Tsai 'O2 said the lounge

system for trapping rain runoff will return the water to
the Crum via a storage tank allowing for limited release

In designing the center, architects are following
guidelines put forth by the LEEDS organization, which
promotes high environmental standards in construction.
The architects have said that there is a good possibility
that the center will meet enough of those standards that
the center may earn an award from the organization,
which would be a first for any college science building.
Tsai, who has been working with the planning committee since its beginning three years ago, said she was
pleased with the chat. "Students asked good questions

and seemed excited and concerned," she said.
She said that members of the committee decided to
hold the chat this week because they are at a point when
they are essentially ready to break ground. She said

many students have felt in the dark throughout most of
the process and that the committee wanted to provide a
chance to answer questions and address concerns.
She encouraged students who still have questions
about the science center to check out the Web site at
sciencecenter.swarthmore.edu or to talk with a student
representative to the committee. The 25-member committee comprises faculty in the natural sciences and
some other departments, administrators, facilities staff
and students. They expect the entire project to be completed by the fall semester of 2005.

Journal shows that some college viewbooks twist campus reality
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Some colleges put out admissions brochures that belie tensions that exist among
different minority groups on their campuses,
a story that appeared in The Chronicle of

Higher Education last month said.
Unlike at the colleges profiled in the article, Swarthmore's admissions materials are
primarily student- and faculty-driven, and
there is no evidence of intentional dishonesty
on the part ofadmissions or the outside publicity designers.
The Chronicle story highlighted SUNY

the Alumni Bulletin, Jeff Lott. Pamphlets for
queer, Latino, international and Asian prospective students already exist, and members
ofthe Swarthmore African-American Student
Society (SASS) are in the process of creating
a brochure for African-American specs.
"We were given a tremendous amount of
leeway about it," said Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol,
who helped design the "Queer & Questioning
at Swarthmore" booklet. "Except for the cover

Russo 'Ol and I wrote most of the text, and

Binghamton, where swastikas appeared in
residence halls in the fall and the campus is
still reeling from the beating of Asian-American students by white students last year. Yet
the Binghamton Web page for prospective
student shows "photos of six smiling students, one black, two Asian, and three white,"
the Chronicle reported.
And at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, a black student named Diallo
Shabazz saw his picture pasted onto a crowd
of white students at a sporting event he had
not attended.

The Cornell Web site shows a group of
five students smiling at the camera, including one black, one Asian and one Latino. But
according to Beth Fischer, a freshman there,
the university's diversity is not what one
might expect. "There are all different races,

religions, ethnicities, especially with international students," she said, "but the thing
with that is, we aren't very united. With the
Greek system, especially... there is an Asian

house and an African-American house."
The Swarthmore Web site has hardly any

pictures of students at all, making it difficult
to find fault with the accuracy of how it portrays the student

body. Ethnic minority

groups at other schools sometimes complain
about being linked with all other minorities
under the umbrella category "students of
color"; Swarthmore admissions pamphlets
usually cite each group separately. And minority groups at the college create their own

literature, with oversight from the editor of

Robin Mamlet helped edit it. I'm very, very
happy with how it's turned out."
Stewart-Winter did add that he thought it
was important for there to be more ways for
queer and questioning high schoolers
who
are generally difficult to target
to obtain
literature about being queer at Swarthmore,
including a check box to request it on the reply cards they send to the college. StewartWinter has also requested that the admissions
office create a link on their Web page to the
Web vprsion of the queer brochure, which has
yet to occur.
Lena Sze 'Ol holds similar views on the "So
You're Asian @ Swarthmore" brochure,
which she helped write and compile. "It was
basically a student effort," she said, adding
that members of the Swarthmore Asian Organization wrote nearly all the text and took
most of their own pictures as well.

Jim Bock, acting dean of admissions,
described the effort to put out honest and

informative minority literature as "collaborative," with students producing text,
assisting in layout and design and sometimes taking their own pictures. The ad-

missions office, he said, is charged with
providing a budget, deadlines and general

oversight.
In broader publications, featured students and professors have mixed
but
mostly positive
feelings about how well
life at Swarthmore is represented. In the
first part of the new college view book,
which will do its best to convey all of the
college's features in one big publication
this fall, four classrooms are featured. For
each, there are interviews with the professors and select students as well as photos of the classroom setting itself.
Political science professor Keith
Reeves, whose class was highlighted in the
view book, had no complaints about his
representation.
"I don't have any qualms or quibbles
about the interviewing or questions that
were asked of me or my students," he said,
adding, "I think it's a very good sense of
what we're trying to do both inside the
classroom and outside the classroom."
He also pointed out that he had been
able to read over his portion of the view
book. "I thought they did a fairly good job
of capturing some ... complex things we're
trying to do," Reeves said.
Nat Anderson, a professor of English
whose creative writing course was also
featured, also felt optimistic about her representation.
"I enjoyed talking with the person who
interviewed me,'' she said. We talked for
a long time. I felt I was able to say a lot
about how creative writing has begun to
flower here at Swarthmore... the directed
creative writing project is an end step in
a great many steps that have been very
exciting for our students."
Anderson was pleased that admissions
and the company that helped with the
view book had selected Lena Sze as the
main creative writing student to portray,
but that expecting her to represent the entire humanities division is "a big load for
a single person to carry.

The School District of Philadelphia

one who uses a particular method of teaching all the time simply because she happened to use that method with Sze.

But, she conceded, this method of publicity does "[have] an impact. It's not a bad
way to get across a sense of what college

life can be like" and what one could do
with a creative writing project. The English professor mentioned that her nieces
and nephews, who are upperclassmen in
high school now, are particularly drawn
to "stories of individuals." Using someone
like Sze as an example of what one can do
with a creative writing project, she said,
would be an effective way to attract students like them.
But Sze herself felt differently. She has
read which of her words will be published,
and they have given her reason to expect
she will be presented as one-sided in the new

view book.

"I feel like the admissions office has prototypes of people they want to portray," she
said, referring to what she thought was an
effort to present her as a writer only. Sze
was disappointed that her interviewer
would not include the many other aspects
of her life she had discussed, such as service and activism.
She was also concerned that current and
potential Swarthmore students would see
her as overwhelmingly satisfied with her
school, even though she does have complaints about the college.
"My voice will be distorted as very proSwarthmore," Sze said.
Aside from those whom the view book
actually features, the admissions materials
are passed through the Student Admissions
Committee, Faculty Admissions Committee,
and administrative staff, among others. The
material is based primarily on interviews
with faculty and students.
"We want to show that we're the most
intellectually challenging college in the nation
or even in the world," Bock said,
adding that admissions also tries to display
the "human and ethical side" and the "service side" of the college.

was the time constraint. "This extra

her ideas for more leadership training at Swarthmore.
Kalwaic said there was also interest around Haverford's policy

could implement a similar policy.

Rebuilding WSRN
Somewhere in between the vast wasteland of
commercialradio and the mostly dead air of the AM
band, there lived a littleradio station with a 110-watt
transmitter and a tiny little budget.
Every week, the littleradio station that could
produced a few hours of news programs, the occasional
radio theater piece, a variety of interesting music shows
and some talk shows, broadcasting 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. Many people listened, and it was good.
Jump forward 25 years. In that same little radio
station, a forlorn DJ sits in a dingy studio, afraid to use
the turntablesbecause she doesn'tknow how. As the last

song of her show
comes to a close, the D J scheduled after her still hasn't
shown up. At 8 p.m. in the evening

time, although no one's listening at all
she shuts
down the station. Dead air.
Whatever could have happened to WSRN? How did it
fall from the little radio station that could to the little
radio station that just can't make it up that big hill?
It's certainly easy to point fingers
at the organization ofWSRN, at the rise of television and the Internet, at
the lack of skilled students to maintain and run the
station
but it's just as easy andfar more constructive to
suggest ways for the station to start thinking that it can.

The WSRN mission statement is an excellent place to
start. The statement is two-fold: first, "to provide the
studentsof Swarthmore with a chance to work with a
radio station," and second, "to serve the listening
community." Currently, WSRN fulfills the letter, if not
the spirit, of these guidelines. Students do run the
station, and the music and programming on WSRN can't

In light of recent allegations made by black students
of discrimination by
police officers,

Swarthmore
the
Swarthmore African-American Student Society raised
awareness on campus and opened dialogue with
Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig and other
members of the department. The Phoenix commends the
members of SASS, especially those who have organized
the effort to address possible police harassment.
The awareness walk and speak out of last week
were well-thought-out and well-organized: the walk
was coordinated with Public Safety and the
Swarthmore Police Department; the speak out was
carefully arranged to focus on a trend of perceived
discrimination through the testimonials of many
different students, rather than concentrate on just the
events of the weekend before last.
SASS's ongoing dialogue with the police seems to
in fact, Craig told a Phoenix reporter

impressed he was with the students with whom
he had been in touch. It seems that there are many
communities that could learn from the example that
aASS and Swarthmore have set in dealing with this
delicate issue of police attitudes and race relations.

Bloom should have

been included in
columnist's apology
Dear Editor:
Last week, Lane Oatey issued an apology to Emily Pollina
'O4 for comments he had made in his previous column. I
believe the apology contained an oversight on Oatey's part

the name of Al Bloom was omitted.

Oatey has made it abundantly clear in his columns that
he is infuriated by the football cut. His anger is entirely
justifiable, if a bit overstated. However, personal attacks
on individuals involved in the cut are neither justifiable
nor appropriate. It seems Oatey believes that Al Bloom is
the driving force behind some dark consortium bent on

destroying Swarthmore athletics. Whether this is true or
not, Oatey is not an individual target. The actions of the
college administration are actions of the administration

alone.
While Oatey has every right to criticize those actions
and any individual's role in said actions, he has no right
to publicly defame any of those individuals. Comments
about "how ugly [Bloom's] kids would be, and how blackened and cold their hearts would be" are hardly appropriate. This is not commentary on an administrative decision; this is name-calling, the likes of which would have
landed Oatey in time-out during his formative years.
Surely, he can find the maturity to write on topics of substance, rather than hijacking a public forum for his personal vendettas.

But it would be extremely difficultfor a student to
jump from doing a show on WSRN to doing a show on
WHYY, Philadelphia's public radio station. Most DJs do
little more than choose music and then play it, and the
production skills taught at WSRN are rudimentary, if
they're even taught at all. It doesn't take much to
improve how a show sounds, and most DJs would
welcome the opportunity to improve their shows.
Worse yet is the "service" WSRN does its listening
community. Although the music played is interesting and
can't be found elsewhere, students who listen to the
station regularly are few and far between. Rather than
alienating its potential audience with elitist attitudes
about serving those who already listen, WSRN should be
making its case for why music you can't find on commercial radio is important and interesting, and why you
should be listening. Promote good shows heavily and
reward them with choice time slots, rather than throwing
up the occasional flyer and scheduling shows by genre.
After all, what's the point of broadcasting if nobody's

FRESH OFF
THE BOAT

Open your arms
and breathe the
off-campus air
Sometimes I wonder why such a small number of

Swarthmore students live off campus.
When I was a freshman here, often I did not venture outside the boundaries of the college for weeks. Going to PPR
was an adventure, not to mention a visit to Mary Lyon or
Strath Haven. Walking behind Wharton, on the way to my
bunker-like basement room in Hallowell, I would yell from
the bottom of my lungs, "I hate you, Swarthmore!" I felt like
the place was choking me, taking all my freedom, self-esteem
and peace of mind. Yet. I stuck around.
Then I left, and during the time I was gone, I looked back
and could not believe the life I had lived during my first three
semesters here. I realized that, in living on campus, I was
more than a student of Swarthmore: I was Swarthmore,

whether I wanted to be or not. The phone ringing differently
meant an outside call. If I missed my Sharpies meal, I would
have to go to Tarble. I was looking forward to being on the
fourteen-meal plan. I thought it was acceptable that during
winter break I would need special permission to access my
own room, not to mention that by a certain date I would need
to have it clean and evacuated.
I swallowed all these impositions with no critical deliberation. After all, they were all part of the big college meal I
was savoring. The problem was that some things I ate were
making me sick.
When I came back, I had a clearer picture of how I wanted
my life to be. I wanted to eat the food that I prepared. I wanted
to eat when I wanted and in the quantities I desired. Taking
this deep necessity of mine into account, I went out of my
way, and with the help of a teddy-bear friend, I was able to
lease an apartment.
Though I had a clearer picture of what I wanted, it certainly was not easy to put it into practice. It took a lot of work

before the empty apartment felt like home. I (rather ridiculously) made it a point to stay away from Sharpies for one full
year. I was glad that when I picked up the phone, I did not
have to hear "Voice mail... voice mail," and reach out for the
button before I heard it again one more intolerable time. I
appreciated the opportunity to assert my habits and desires
on the institution, rather than the other way around.
Sure, I feel more distance and alienation from the campus,
but people are more attractive in a variety of ways when you
don't run into them every day. Though it is more of an effort
to see my friends, I don't feel like a burning object, inevitably
disintegrating as a social being as the semester progresses.
The time I spend with them feels like a true commitment,
rather than a lunch at Sharpies, and that makes it all the more
meaningful.
Many of the "commitments" here at Swarthmore don't
mean much. How often are they fueled by contingency alone?
At Swarthmore you don't need to make any real effort to keep
most of your immediate relationships alive. I hope We have
relational adaptability after four years of this, because if we
don't we are in trouble.
We all share so much in common here. We are all taking
classes, being graded, retrieving our mail from little yellowish boxes located one beside the other. We plan our year following the same calendar. All of this sharing is great if the
goal is to create a collective ground for all to tread upon. But
however I might enjoy many of the things this ground may
offer, I don't know if staying solely on it is healthy at all.
In fact, I think that staying on any single ground is really
unhealthy for the soul. That is why I come home and do dishes.
It really feels like Zen therapy, especially during those three
winter weeks where we had no warm water. That is why I
think constantly about my friends all over the world, about
my family in Brazil, about the broadest range of relations
possible, rather than having a sole intravenous relation with
Swarthmore. In the aspiration to be in touch with something
else, I can gain some distancefrom the institutionand at least
provide an interesting fight, rather than completely subduing myself to it. And it is in this fight that I find one of my few
connections with any type of sanity.

Don't be afraid to judge others
BY RYAN CHAHROUR
Baseball season is under way. A few flowers are blooming. And finally, the time has come for a little spring cleaning.
I humbly urge you to throw out, along with all the old
high school notebooks, broken guitar strings and unmatched socks, the phrase and the idea "who am I to
judge?" One of the great liberal
axioms, the idea that we shouldn't'
judge others' actions, choices and
lifestyles, has become familiar
ground, an unchallenged assumption in many individual philosophies. Though it may be appealing
to many, refusing to ever pass
judgment is more of a cop-out than
big-hearted embrace of tolerance.
We can't simultaneously claim to
have personal values and persistently refuse to engage them in our
experiences. By denying people's
right to make such judgments, we
cut ourselves off from the worthwhile discussion of right and

port openly.
Some people avoid judgment because it might create
conflict. Just because we can't come to some grand consensus on right and wrong doesn't mean we should entirely avoid the issue. Sure, we could avoid some conflict
if we just shut our mouths and our minds and took responsibly for ourselves alone. Most first-grade teachers
would love it if their students took that approach. In reality, though, it doesn't make sense.
How can you legitimately claim any
moral as a value, or something of importance, unless you believe that ideally, everyone ought to share that

HOW CAN YOU

LEGITIMATELY CLAIM
ANY MORAL AS

value?

That doesn't mean attempting to
force your views on everyone around
you, or even speaking up every time
you don't approve of something. It
does mean having the guts to make a
decision and form your own perspective what you think is right. If you
don't approve of the way that women
are treated in some Middle Eastern
countries, tolerance be damned. You
have every right, maybe even a responsibility, to do what you can
change the situation. It can be difficult to say, or even think these things,
but doing so provides a fantastic opportunity.
We have much to gain from a more open dialogue on
the issues that we want to brush under the rug. Your opinions and values should be important to me. You may have
a take on some issue that hasn't occurred to me. How can
we create a well-developed moral compass with ourselves
as the only point of reference? Nothing is more important in an individual's life than the values or ideals for
which he or she strives. And if we know people aren't

SOMETHING OF
IMPORTANCE UNLESS

wrong.

From the start, this abstentious
impulse is hypocritical, given that

YOU BELIEVE THAT
IDEALLY, EVERYONE
OUGHT TO SHARE THAT
VALUE?

we almost never follow it. The Swarthmore student body,
as liberal and tolerant a group as it aspires to be, is actually extraordinarily judgmental. Really, doesn't every
single one of us just hate stupid people? How about Republicans who want to hoard their money and screw the
poor
don't many of us consider them morally bankrupt? Feel free to admit it, there is no reason for there to
be a stigma attached to making these kinds of appraisals.
Currently, we use the phrase "who am I to judge?" to
support actions or activities of which we basically all
approve. We don't "judge" people who drink or have casual sex because they are a part of our collective lifestyle
and we think they are okay. Some conservatives like to
call these actions immoral because they think they are
wrong and claim that they don't do them. Liberals, on
the other hand, disapprove of greed, and make the same
claims regarding it. Basically, "not judging" is a mechanism for tacitly supporting actions we are afraid to sup-

really reserving judgment on everything, it might help
keep us in line. Nobody wants people in stocks and a pillory in the middle of the village, but we also shouldn't
pretend our actions are morally neutral to the world.
So while you reexamine your old winter clothes, bookshelves and drawers full of what could only be objectively
referred to "crap," consider adding right and wrong to
your vocabulary and tell somebody what you actually
think for once. They might thank you
but I doubt it.

SASS prayer inappropriate
discriminatory actions and invite every supporter to help

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Shocked by the incidents of last weekend, I donned a
black T-shirt and joined the awareness walk in the ville
on Friday afternoon. I was not reporting on the event,
but I had come to participate in what I thought was a
creative and effective way to bring attention to the what
some students perceived as an alarming trend of racial
discrimination in the ville. Upon our return to Parrish, I
was curious to hear what students
claiming discriminatory treatu^m
ment would have to say.
the
But as
event began, some of
my support turned to bitterness
and a feeling of exclusion. SASS
member Hernease Davis 'O4 began
the speak out by asking the audience members to bow their heads
and be silent, not for personal reflection but for prayer. She began
with, "Oh, Lord, how excellent is
thy name," proceeded to lead the
entire group 'through a series of
"Thank you, Lord"s, and con-

stop them. Yet conducting prayer to a Christian God in a
public setting left out all atheists, agnostics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and anyone in between. This
action seriously undermined the cause of SASS and its
supporters.

Before the awareness walk, Rodney Morris 'Ol asked
everyone present to take a moment of silence to focus
their energies on the task to come. Afterwards, he called
for silence again, so that every-

,
I have no problem with an advocacy group counting its proverbial blessings, but SASS
had no place bringing religion
specifically, Christianity —to the speak out on Friday. The cause for which we
had all gathered was not, by nature, religious, and certainly the spiritual leanings of the supporters varied
greatly. I was under the impression that one of SASS's
goals was to unite the campus against the police force's

one could reflect on what they
had just accomplished. These requests were entirely appropriate
and inclusive. It would have
been easy for Davis to make a
speech noting what the group
should be thankful for and re-

minding it of what strength it
would need without turning to
religion. Yes, some people draw
strength from and offer thanks
to a god or gods; this is a personal choice, and they have every right to do it. But nonbeliev-

ers and non-Christians know
how to be grateful, too.
After participating in the
awareness march on Sunday, I felt positively excluded
from the continuation of the very event to which I had
brought my wholehearted support. The prayer session
was downright insulting. I hope leaders of this very important fight against discrimination realize that exclusion of non-Christians in any form will only harm their
ambitions.

Blacks and Republicans: a necessary marriage
BY DAVID HAENDLER
It hasn't been a good week for race relations. In Cincinnati, the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen by a policeman sparked demonstrationsand riots. At our beloved
ivory tower, protestors marched on "Finlandia" to rally
against police discrimination. Even the normally sedate
Daily Jolt forum seemed to sense that trouble was brewing. For a few days, the high-brow discussions on Proust
and Nietzsche which normally dominate the Jolt were replaced by knock-down, drag-out debates over racial profiling. Online intellectuals searched in vain for a recent
thread about Kafka, only to find that it had been replaced
by a heated argument over whether Randy Keim was an
overlooked victim or a rogue well-deserving of his comeuppance.
Come to think of it, this hasn't been much of a year for
race relations. Jesse Jackson was 'outed' as an absentee
father and is currently having his personal finances investigated. There was the recent flap over David Horowitz
and his quest to ignite campus firestorms for fun and profit.
And let's not forget about the presidential election, in
which George W. Bush made some token gestures to build
a more inclusive GOP, even going so far as to turn the Republican convention into a sort of right-wing diversity festival, only to be met withrecord black opposition and comparisons to Goebbels. There have been a few hopeful signs
since then. A group of African-American entrepreneurs,
including the founder of BET, have rallied around Bush's
estate tax cut, claiming that the cut would help to "preserve the first generation of significant black wealth." And
John Dilulio, the man chosen to head up Bush's charitable
choice program, has a long and fruitful history of working

•<

well with black churches. But these are just band-aids applied to an open gash. Clearly, something is screwed up when
the country's largest minority cannot get along with the
country's current government. So where do we go from
here?

Republicans need to realize that they cannot afford to
write off the African-American community, or any racial
minority, if they hope to have a chance of holding onto political power. The demographic currents in this country are

YEAR FOR RACE RELATIONS.
shifting quickly, and if the GOP does not change to accommodate that, they will find themselves relegated to the

dustbin of history, along with the Whigs, the Federalists
and the aptly-named Know-Nothing Party. This means
cracking down on racial profiling, ending the war on drugs,
re-examining sentencing flaws in the justice system, improving the educational system (through vouchers and charter schools if need be) and working hard to encourage family values and maintain law and order. Some of these goals
sound more like the ideals of Ralph Nader than those of
Ronald Reagan, but I think that they are all compatible with
the conservative ideals of a limited, race-neutral government. In the short term there will be a lot of griping, and
maybe even a few defections to the Reform party. But in the
long term, the Republicans will benefit greatly from escaping the old stigma that they are the party of intolerance.

Likewise, black leaders need to realize that they can gain
more by working with the system than by reflexively opposing it. Protests and heated rhetoric are good for bringing attention to a bad situation, but when you really want to
get something done, you need flexibility and willingness to
compromise. That's tricky when you've cut off all contact
with one of the two major blocs in American politics. As
long as the Democrats know that they can win black votes
by spreading fears of the big, bad Republican bogeyman,
what reason do they have to work for substantial improvements in the inner city? And as long as Republicans know
that they can't win over African-Americans, why should they
bother to try?
A similar argument can be made regarding law enforcement. If cops believe that every police action against a person of color will be called racialized, they will stop trying to
rein in urban crime. As bad as police racism is (and I think
that stamping it out should be one of the first priorities of
the Justice Department), allowing gangs to run rampant is

even worse. Cities like Boston have made a lot of progress

by achieving better communication between the police department and the black community. The people of Cincin-

nati would be well advised to heed that example and try to
open up a constructive dialogue before they reach for their
crowbars.
Healing centuries of mistrust is not going to be an easy
task. Blacks have good reason to be suspicious of any orga-

nization which includes Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond.
Conservatives have good reason to be wary of anyone who
admires Al Sharpton. But on the off-chance that Republicans were willing to extend an olive branch to blacks or vice
versa, both sides could gain a lot. It's a shame that neither
group seems particularly interested in trying.

OUTSIDE
THE BOX

Preserve the memory
of Alice Paul's WRC
Alice Paul 'O5 was a remarkable person. In the pantheon of
Swarthmore alumni, she stands even with James Michener
'29 and Michael Dukakis '55 as one of the finest and most accomplished people Swarthmore has ever educated.
Paul is among the ten seminal figures in the women'srights
movement of the last two centuries. She organized a protest at
Wilson's inauguration that drew more attention than the president himself. She organized the first ever pickets of the White
House. She was the chief lobbyist and arguably the most important catalyst for the passage of women's suffrage bills. She
was the architect behind the Equal Rights Amendment. Partly
as an honor to Paul, and partly in order to further legitimize
themselves, the founders of the Women's Resource Center
named the center after Paul in 1975.In the early 1990s her name
was removed due to allegedly racist and anti-Semitic remarks.
This WRC should rename itself the Alice Paul WRC, and
Paul's good name should be restored.
Originally, what was then called the Women's Center was
started in the climate of 1970s feminism, when McCabe lacked
women's studies books and women's services were shamefully
lacking. It was highly successful until the awkward early 19905,
when a campus controversy arose over the lack of diversity
within the WRC management. One solution was that the WRC
board would have strict "minimums" for whom could serve
among the nine board members, there had be two women of
color, two lesbians and so on. Another solution was to quietly
drop any reference to Alice Paul from the center's name.
Thefirst question that shouldbe addressed is whether Paul
was actually racist and anti-semitic. A vibrant debate exists
among women's studies circles questioning whether her actions were actually racist, and if so, whether this was because
she was actually racist or pragmatic. While it seems that few
of Paul's direct racist quotes exist, Freda Kirchwey fanned
the flames in a 1921 article in The Nation claiming that black
women were unfairly treated by "Paul's machine" at a feminist conference. Paul vigorously denied these charges.
Even if we are to accept that Paul was actually racist, it is
still important to consider the context. The women's movement
has had a long history of racist undertones, going back, for
example, to Susan B. Anthony's painfully racist language after
blacks got the right to vote. While in cozy 2001 we may say that
Paul's courtship of the racist components of the women's right
movement was immoral, it seems somewhat presumptuous to
denounce her actions from afar. After all, it is possible that
women's suffrage would never have passed had the women's
movement not been united, just like abolitionism was set back
by Garrison's splitting of the movement in the 1830s.
As a Jew, one might suppose that I would be offended by
Paul's anti-Semitism
only I'm not. When I see that Paul
went to amazing lengths to help Jews escape Hitler's death
camps, I recognize that her actions speak far louder than
whatever supposedly anti-semitic remarks she mumbled.
Even if we accept that Paul truly was an uncompromising
racist, is it fair to discount her other accomplishments? Should
we tear down the Jefferson Memorialbecause he had slaves?
Should we eliminate Martin Luther King Day because he was
a womanizer? Should we hold Ghandi in disdain because he
was a misogynist? It is important that we judge historical figures from a contextual standpoint, and while we should recognize their faults, we shouldn't blow them out of historical
proportion and thereby ignore their accomplishments.
At Swarthmore, we lack both tradition and institutional
memory. At other top schools, they eat amidst 18th-century
books and 19th-century photographs. Here, it seems like we
don't acknowledge our past, and we have no traditions other
thanthe relatively new Screw Your Roommate and Sager Symposium. When we walk the grounds of Swarthmore, it seems
that we forget that many have done so before us, and that
their story is our story. Not only is this unfortunate, it is unnecessary when we have heroes such as Paul among our past.
We should remedy the excesses of the overly politically correct sentiment of the early 1990s and recognize that we can
both move on to the future and accept our past.
Paul was near death when she found out that the women's
center had been named after her, and according to accounts,
she was emotionally moved by the tribute. The WRC obviously meant a great deal to her, and we should honor her brave
and magnificent legacy. We have hidden from it long enough.

Why we need to curb C0 2 emissions
BY MATTHEW DAVIS
David Haendler is correct when
he mentions in "How I learned to
stop worrying and love SUV emissions" (March 22) that many people
in our society predict the future,
from economists to volcanologists.
However, this is where my agreement with Haendler's viewpoint
ends: most predictions play a fundamental role in directing
society's attention to areas of concern. Indeed, I would like to direct
everyone's attention to two environmental issues in which "cataclysmic" predictions were not far
from the truth: the effects of pesticide übiquity in the environment,
and the chlorofluorocarbon-induced creation of the ozone hole.
These two examples demonstrate
that, contrary to Haendler's belief,
j mm
we need to reduce greenhouse
emissions now.
Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring" caught the
public's attention by painting a bleak future of spring
without bird song, wrought by pesticides' impact on the
environment. When the chemical DDT became popular
with farmers, no one knew pesticides' long-term effects
on ecosystems. But naturalists, biologists and birders
soon observed negative effects of pesticide use in birds.
Taking note of this evidence, Carson decided to take action before it was too late. As a biologist and employee of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, she was not poised to
become wealthy from her book. Carson merely feared
that pesticides would contaminate and disturb the natural world. Initially dubbed a radical despite her government career, Carson eventually stimulated enough public outcry to outlaw DDT. The scientific evidence was not
fully developed when she published her book in 1962, and
if it had been, many species would have already succumbed to the deadly toxins. There is uncertainty inherent in science, and this should be reflected in the way it
is used in decision-making; science should be used to
guide policy discussions, but policy decisions should ultimately be based on our values.
Since Carson's initiation of environmental watchdog-ism, scientists have discovered another group of
man-made chemicals that have been disrupting natural systems: chloroflourocarbons (CFCs). Cheap to
manufacture, CFCs are chemically stable and work well
as refrigerants and aerosols. Not until the early 1980s,
when climate scientists stumbled upon a hole in the
earth's protective ozone layer, did there seem any reason not to use them. Unbeknownst to humankind, CFCs
were so stable that they were surviving the journey to
15 to 30 kilometers above the earth's surface, where they
finally reacted with ozone. Although the science of ozone
depletion was not completely understood, as DDT effects
had not been fully understood in Carson's time,
policymakers convened to prevent further damage to
the ozone layer. Out of these international negotiations
emerged the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which phased
out CFC usage in an effort to avert the disaster that
would inevitably result from increased UV radiation.
The swift action taken by international governments is
particularly commendable in light of its foundation in
science as well as in values. We may never fully understand earth systems
so we cannot wait for flawless

science in order to protect them, especially when the re-

percussions

are so severe.
Even when scientific hypotheses are not guaranteed,
we must rely on our values and risk aversion to shape
policy decisions that will avoid serious consequences. The
science of global climate change may not be perfect, but
there are approximately 2000 climate scientists from
around the world who agree in a recent assessment report
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) that the global warming over the past 100 years is
'Very unlikely (1 to 10 percent chance) to be due to internal variability alone
in the light of new evidence and
taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of
the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely (66 to
90 percent chance) to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations." The authors of this paper have
been careful to present sound data and receive no payment
for their efforts; these scientists are merely supplying
policymakers and the public with information on the global climate and its future.
Considering the potential impacts of global warming,
public awareness must be raised. Indeed, many of the most
disturbing predictions of climate change fall well withinthe
realm ofpossibility: according to the IPCC, even a small temperature increase will likely result in serious problems for
humans around the globe, especially in developing nations.
Current climate models are good enoughto replicate the longterm rise in temperature based on the global increase of
greenhouse gases in the past 150 years. Currently, we do
know enough to warrant a self-imposed reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Maintaining the climate stability humankind has enjoyed in the recent past is of primary importance to our future; now it is up to the public to agitate
for policy adjustments that reflect this knowledge.

Phoenix reporter Ivan Boothe investigates the mission of Swarthmore's radio station

On

a wall on the fifth floor of Parrish hangs the philosophy of WSRN, the Swarthmore College's radio
station since 1940. The goals for the stationare, first,
"to provide the students of Swarthmore with a chance to
work with a radio station," and second, "to serve the listening community." Though the station may have a mission statement, its members seem to have conflicting views
on how to fulfill that mission.
Andy Smith 'Ol, director of the station's rock department, believes that the station is fulfilling its goal to give
students on campus access to a diverse assortment of music. "We provide some really cool stuff to the campus, but
most students are too boring to realize that," he wrote in
an e-mail.

Others, like J. Branen Salmon 'O3, the station's technical director, believe that WSRN has been declining, and is
failing in its most important goal. "'SRN used to have a
much greater concern with public service, as opposed to
entertainment," he said. He cites a lack of organization and
commitment on the part of the directors of the station.
Many DJs also believe that the station is far too heavily
weighted toward the "indierock" genre, at the expense of
other types of music.

THE BIRTH OF A NETWORK
bunded in 1940, the college's radio station was originally known simply as SN, the Swarthmore Network.
It was a carrier-current AM station, using the
college's power lines as an antenna, and initially grew out

F

of the Amateur Radio Club. Over the years, the radio station's
name was changed first to the Swarthmore Radio Network,
and then, when the college was granted an FM license in 1971,
to WSRN. Among its members, however, the radio station has
been known as WSRN from the very beginning.
"It started off playing classical music for studying, then
expanded intoradio theatre," Salmon said. In addition to working with the station on mechanical issues, Salmon has learned
quite a bit about the station's history, and is hoping to compile the information he has amassed on it.
A ham radio club, using the call letters W3AJ, began at the
same time as WSRN, but the radio station has long outlived
it."WSRN's equipment when we were carrier-current AM was
largely home-brew," Salmon said.
On November 28, 1962, the radio station's board of directors took the first step toward acquiring an FM license. In a
poll conducted that year, 431 students answered in the affirmative when asked if they would support a full-fledged station, with only 31 voting against it.
"It takes a long time to start a radio station," Salmon said.
Indeed, nearly a decade passed before the station first broadcast on 91.5 FM in the fall of 1971. Originally located in
Trotter,the station moved into its present home on the top floor
of Parrish during the 19705. Pointing to a binder thick with
schematics, tables, and charts, Salmon said, "this is what we
had to do just to move the station." With all of the requirements, he said, he wasn't surprised it took so long to get the
FM license.
At times, Salmon seems to wax a little nostalgic for the

glory days of the station. "Once upon a time, SRN used to
be really organized," he said. He flipped through binders
full ofold program logs and described an intricate system
of dumb terminals, computer monitors tied to a central
server, which every department in the station had.
The radio station, in fact, used to have its own news
department, as evidenced by the barely visible letters,
"NEWS," on what is now the door to the jazz library "It
used to be much more central to the lives of the student
body," Salmon said.

THE DECLINE OF A NETWORK
decline of the station, Salmon said, "was a gradual
process." In October 1990, interns from Strath Haven
High School, who the station used to employ, conducted a survey. The results of that survey are still posted
on the wall inside the main WSRN office. Students, for in-

The

stance, said that they listened to the station for an average
of 4.9 hours per week.
One question on the survey asked students to complete
the statement, "I would make WSRN better serve the college community by
One student responded, "WSRN
does not equal democracy. We exist to play new music. Lots
o' folk don't care for it, but compared to other college radio
stations, we are pretty damn good. Sacrificing that to bring
our listenership from five to six is a dumb idea."
The response to the question, "Do you listen to news

once a week on WSRN?" was overwhelmingly, "No." Salmon
believes it was shortly after this point that the station did
away with its news department.
According to Salmon, "SRN's decline happened in themid-80s." The advent of MTV, in 1981, and the increasing commercialization of television and radio "dealt a huge blow to college radio."

„

"It was echoed in college radio stations all across the nation," Salmon said. "You have people coming to college for
whom radio didn'tplay an important part oftheir lives." However, he said, "I don'tblame SRN's decline on anyone. It frustrates me from time to time, but
[the station] kept from
being homogenized."

*

THE STATION TODAY
lan Huntington 'Ol, the current general manager ofthe station, feels that today, both WSRN goals are being fulfilled. Letting students contribute to the show, he said, is where the station does best. "The quality of applications [for radio shows] is
usually pretty high, so we don't need to cut many shows at all."
Therock department, Smith wrote, is "one of the only departments to have to cut DJs because of lack of time space."
"I've heard talk ofpeople wanting to reform WSRN, which
I think is symptomatic of a growing trend of banalization
sweeping our campus," Smith wrote. "There is this new interest in appealing to the mass of the student body. The result
.is a move away from the new and challenging things and toward what kids already know."
"It's a philosophy that a lot of people, especially in terms
ofrock, find exclusionary, like it's not serving the majority of
students," said Benjamin Galynker 'O3, the director ofthe blues
department. However, he said, "you can't please everybody."
Huntington believes one of the station's strengths is playing music not heard anywhere else. On some departments,
such as jazz, he said "you can hear a lot of the same stuff on
the Temple [University] station," but their jazz is played at
night, unlike WSRN's.
"We're not a business, so success isn't really a primary
goal," Smith wrote. "I guess success comes from providing
the newest and most innovative music to our DJs."
Indie rock and world music, Huntington said, are the
station's strongest departments. Smith agreed. "I really think
opening up people to new music is the best thing WSRN does,"
he wrote. The indie department, in fact, is the only one with
its own office, and also has a room for a library.
Some students are less than appreciative of the disparity.
Sarah Wood 'O4, who DJs a hip-hop show on the station, said
the genre of"hip-hop/electronica is under-represented." While
it stands to reason, she said, that the rock department would
be the largest, "I think there could be more of a balance."
"The rock library takes up a full room," she said. "The
electronica library has one shelf."
Caroline Fritz 'O4, a DJ of a world music show, said that
"the station operates in a very disorganized way." She said,
in her experience, DJs are not consistent in showing up, and
there have been problems with thefts of CDs.
"DJs don'thold a very deep commitment" to their show, she
said. "I think if there was more communicationbetween the
board and the DJs, or more cohesiveness, it would be better."
There are "at least eight" substitutes available to the station, according to Galynker, in case a DJ doesn't show up.
"The fact is, we realize that people have things that come
up in their lives which push their radio commitment to the
side," Smith wrote. "It's really inexcusable, but we're running a college radio station, not a reform school. We don't
teach manners, just rock and roll."
"It's especially a problem when the person is a senior DJ
or a board member, which happens too," Galynker said.
"I've made several attempts to try tobridge what I perceived
as a gapbetween therock DJs and directors," Smith wrote. He
said that he encourages DJs to write their own reviews of new
albums, in addition to the reviews the directors compose.
Even Smith, though, sees problems in the system. "As for
communication with the board as a whole, I think there is
very little," he wrote. "In the past, we always sent out minutes from our meetings. For some reason (laziness) that has
stopped," he added.
Salmon said that last semester, 'a couple of guys were
prank-calling residents in the Ville,' which was extremely illegal." The two students' talk show was taken away from them.
"It's the number one reason we reject talk shows more
than anything else," Huntington said, "because they give us
so many problems." DJs on all programs are required to sign
contracts that holds them and any guests or guest callers that
they have responsible if they use obscenities on air.

Huntington said there was a clear difference between what
is said by a DJ and what is contained in a song. "It's easier to

defendthe artistic merit about things said in a song," he said.
But, he said, "we basically have zero tolerance for DJs" who

use obscenities.
The problem, Huntington said, is that many talk show
hosts don't realize how hard it is to fill up an entire hour.
They also may not realize that they can't talk like they do
with their friends. "Your conversation hanging out in Tarble
isn't regulated by the FCC," he said.
After 10 p.m., he said, there is more leniency given as to
what a radio station can play on air. Every few years, Huntington said, the FCC arrests someone, takes him or her to
court, and levies a fine of several thousand dollars. "I guess
we're just playing the percentages after 10 o'clock," he said.
Though some have argued that WSRN's music is not what
most people want to hear, Huntington feels that the diversity
of music is the station's strongest point. "I think that the radio station is closely tied with the whole point of this college,
exploring areas you don't know about," he said. "I would like
to have an SRN where you walk down the hall and it's playing in everyone's rooms, but I know that's not for everyone."
"People who call WSRN 'elitist' need to look at the institution they are going to," Huntington said in a follow-up e-mail.
"To spend four years and all this money learning because you
like it, without any direct commercial benefit, is also a pretty
elitist idea. WSRN in its present form is just one of the many
resources on campus for exploring interests with passion."
In addition, Huntington wrote, "it's pretty easy to escape
the 'tyranny' of independent music." WSRN is in a unique

position, he said, because "college radio is not commercial
radio, and therefore it doesn't need to be concerned with listeners for the sake oflisteners."
"Whysquander that amazing opportunity to explore other
musical options by playing things you can hear elsewhere,
just so more people will listen?" he asked.
"Our charter stipulates that we play music that can't be
found elsewhere on the radio spectrum," Smith wrote, "and
the fact is most kids at our school are content listening to
popular radio."
DJs in the rock department, however, are required to play
at least half of their shows from a pre-determined play list.
"It's the songs that the directors think are the hottest,"
Galynker said.

"The play list is incredibly diverse," Smith wrote. "Two
different shows within our department vary several times
more than a whole day of programming on corporate radio."
DJs, however, disagreed. Carey Kopeikin 'O3, a DJ for a
ska and punk program, said, "Because of the play list rule, it
can get pretty old." While Smith described the play list as
composed of over 100 CDs, Kopeikin said it was more like 30.
"There are about three punk CDs in the play list," he said.
"It feels a little oppressive, but I think its significantly diverse," said Sydney Beveridge 'O3, the station's treasurer and

a rock DJ.
Most musical genres at WSRN are grouped by time ofday.
Classical, for instance, is always in the morning, whileworld
and hip-hop music is generally played on the weekends.
"The idea behind block scheduling is that someone can
turn on the radio at a specific time and know what kind of

music they're going to hear," Smith said.
Some DJs were upset, however that someone with a good
classical show would be forced to play at 7 a.m., while a marginal rock D J would get a time slot in the late afternoon.
"I think the notion that more people listen to the radio in
the evening is a broad generalization that doesn't really hold
up," Smith countered. "The first problem is actually defining
'prime spot.' Historically, our classical programming has been
really popular with the off-campus community, as people can
turn it on in the mornings as they get ready to go to work,"

Smith wrote.
As far as the rationale behind indie rock programming,
Galynker said, "It's become kind of institutionalized."
Smith also described the industry supporting the rock
department. "Rock music has been the focus of college radio
in general for the last 20 years or so," he wrote. As a result,
radio directors will frequently receive new music before it is
released to the public.
Huntington also wanted to dispel the myth that it is difficult to get a radio show on the station. "If you care about a
certain subject and you know a lot about it, you can get a
show," he said.
Some DJs are more skeptical. "To get a good time slot, you
have to be friends with a director," Kopeikin said.
Beveridge partly concurred. "I agree that scheduling depends partly on seniority and experience, and depending on
the genre of your show," she said.

Although WSRN's rock library, pictured here, isn't in
danger, many of the recordings made by WSRN up to 58
years ago are deteriorating.

Early WSRN records
slowly deteriorating
Many years worth of records recorded by WSRN
during the heyday of the radio station are in danger of
being lost to deterioration, according to the station's
technical director.
J. Branen Salmon 'O3, WSRN's tech director, said, "We
used to record pretty much anything that happened on
campus." WSRN, in fact, was recording events long before
most college 'adio stations. The station had its own lathe,
upon which it cut large, 78 rpm discs that "would run better
on a Gramophone than a modern record player," Salmon
said. In a stack of old discs several feet high, Salmon
pointed to the earliest one he had come across, from an
alumni dinner on Feb. 13,1943.
However, Salmon said, "these are deteriorating very
rapidly." The materials, which Salmon describes as
having "serious historical value," are composed of discs,
magnetic tape recordings, and reels of old radio
programs. "We have the first recording of anything ever
written by Peter Schickele," Salmon said, referring to the
1957 graduate of Swarthmore who created the persona
"P.D.Q. Bach" to wide acclaim and several Grammys.
"I'm about the only person who is really concerned
about these," Salmon said. He has spoken with the
Alumni Office and the library, and the latter seems to be
the most interested.
Christopher Densmore, the curator of the Friends'
Historical Library, said, "We would definitely be
interested in talking with [WSRN]." In addition to
historical Quaker documents, the library houses history
on the college itself.
"Obviously, one of the concerns with the recordings is
the preservation issue," Densmore said. "It's sort of
interesting, though," he added, "the idea of what college
radio stations thought they were doing at the time."
Although Densmore said that WSRN was not the first
college radio station, by about twenty years, he felt that
the old media would still be valuable for alumni use and
general college history.
"I'm hoping that the stuff that's important can get
moved to a safe place in anticipation of their
restoration," Salmon said. As we walked into the jazz
library, Salmon pointed to plaster that littered the floor.
"You'll notice we have ceiling issues," he said. This type
of incident is exactly why Salmon wants to find the
recordings a new home. "There were a bunch of old
tapes, right there," he said, pointing to the spot
underneath the crumbling ceiling.
In addition to old recordings, WSRN has file cabinets
full of electronic schematics, old letters (particularly
those to and from the Federal Communications
Commission), punch cards, and transcripts of live
remote broadcasts.

Sitting on top of the million
Physics professor Andrea Stout is set to be the next "Millionaire"
BY DANIEL MARRIN
What would you do with a million
dollars? Physics professor Andrea
Stout might answer this question as
Swarthmore's first contestant on
ABC's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" According to Stout, it's been a
hell of a ride.
Her fiance, statistics professor Phil
Iversen, began the madness. He was
first to notice Stout's gift at answering the show's quick-response multiple-choice questions. Since Stout is
on sabbatical doing research, and has
more free time, Iversen recommended
auditioning.

"I didn't care about being on TV,"
she said. "But the money built up re-

ally quick."

Stout and Iverson noticed an ad for
"Millionaire" auditions. It led them to
a surreal day of tests at Philadelphia's
ABC studio. "It was like being back
in high school," said Stout. "I was
shocked at how far people would
travel for the auditions." People everywhere from Boston to California had
flown in. The auditioners were
"mostly lawyers, some accountants,

and one guy from the White House
I'm not sure what his job was."
On the show, a ring of contestants
are placed around Regis Philbin, who
sits in the center opposite the contestant going for the million. The fastest
to push the right answers, and correctly arrange four items, gets in the
"hot seat."
The auditions are full of the "fastest-finger" questions, like "arrange
these foods in increasing amount of
fiber per cup." After being one of 20
to pass, Stout goes on a Jeopardystyle game show with cameras filming to see if she's got the look. The
host finally asks the magic question:
"So what'll you do with a million
bucks?" The right look, voice and
answer mean Stout's chance at fame,
and on Tuesday, April 3, a smoothtalking TV voice announces that she
is headed to New York for the next
Tuesday's show, with 24 hours to decide her one companion for her stay
in New York.
Stout picks her mom, who flies free
from Kalamazoo, Mich, to meet her at
LaGuardia Airport. The royal treatmentbegins with two limos, one each,
that take them separately to their

...

Center.
The initiation begins at 5:30 p.m.
on Monday night with a legal brief-

ing. "They explained all the rules,"
said Stout later of the experience.
"We couldn't bring anything to the
studio, no crib sheets, newspapers,
cell phones, not even blank paper or

pens! They even searched

our bags."
After making sure Stout would not
try to write or read anything before
or during the show, ABC approves
her outfit, a teal sweater with black
pants.

On Tuesday morning, mother and
daughter drive out for the big day.
Stout is overtired. "I couldn't sleep in
the hotel," she recalled later. "That

The driver jets them over to ABC
studios, where the feeding process begins: a full breakfast buffet around 7
a.m., a boxed lunch with wrapped sandwiches two hours later, and yet more
food two hours after that. After eating
like a king, Stout steps onto the comparatively bare-bones set. "It's like
they just went to Radio Shack," she
said of the set's components. "They
never anticipated the show taking off
like it did, so the technology is very
cheap." The "fastest-finger" monitor,
which Stout had imagined as a touch
screen, is actually just a monitor showing the question with buttons on a box
below attached with black masking
tape.
"This is something I'd build in my
garage," she said later.
Stout gets nervous as she watches
the first show being taped. The intensity begins to build, especially as the
regular feedings keep the sugar and
caffeine pulsating in her body. Everyone forms a kind of artificial closeness. The women reach out to Stout,
hoping she will go on to be the first
woman millionaire in the show's history. At 4 p.m., lovable Regis introduces himself to the contestants, saying "I am the man who saved the ABC
network," with a huge smile. The
good-natured host makes sure he's got
Stout's name right and the show begins. Stout takes her place in the ring,
and the fast-finger questions begin
under blinding lights and booming
synthesizers.
She gets the first fast-finger quesstupid Millionaire music

tion wrong. On the second, she comes
in second to a guy who walks off with
$500,000. Then comes the third and final fast-finger round. The question:
"Put these TV detectives in order of
series appearance: Peter Gunn,
Beretta, Ironside and Lenny Brisco."
In 4.888 seconds, Stout punches in the
answer, presses OK, and hits the jackpot. She walks into the "hot seat" and
answers five easy questions to win one
grand before the show ends. Stout and
Philbin stand together under the Millionaire archway, Andrea waving to
the camera. Afterward, there under
the lights, over the music, Regis whispers the question he's been waiting to
ask her all day: "Why would you want
to marry a statistician?"
On Sunday, April 29, Stout will return to New York for the second
round, to go from her guaranteed
grand for a million. She has five potential lifelines, including math professor Cheryl Grood, history professor Tim Burke, physics professor
Carl Grossman's wife and her dad.
And of course, Mom will be flying
back again.
Finally, I have to pop the question.
I have to know the answer that had
gotten her on the show, back in Philly.
"So what will you do with a million
bucks?" I ask.
"Invest in an IRA," she tells me.
Well. "Also, I'm getting married this
summer, so I'd make the wedding
nicer. Um, I've always wanted a
horse, and of course I'd need some
land to put the horse on." Then Stout
flashes a smile, and I can instantly
see why the networks made her a

star.

The Magnetic Fields played at the Trocadero on
Saturday. From left: guitarist John Woo, pianist Claudia
Golson, vocalist Stephin Merritt and cellist Sam Davol.
BY JOEL BLECHER
Last Saturday night, The Magnetic Fields aspired to find

a good metaphor for that all-encompassing passion of the
heart, that certain je ne sais quoi. Led by Stephin Merritt's

creative melancholic genius and driving voice, the band
stopped in Philadelphia to tour the colossal release of "69
Love Songs," a well-written album of charming laments
and self-mocking ballads.
Before the concert began on Trocadero's awkwardly
high stage, short story writer Rick Moody was conscripted
to warm up the crowd.
"We're into doing a reading before we play," said Magnetic Fields' peppy pianist and vocalist Claudia Golson,
"so try to keep it quiet." This would have been an easier
task for the audience if Moody hadn't stumbled across the
fine line between repetition and monotony, reading from
his book "Demonology" atop musical background of a sluggish Casio improv. He wouldn't have survived more than
a minute on Amateur Night at the Apollo, and even
Trocadero's crowd, a peculiar mix of ear-pierced indies and
melancholy Swatties, didn't respond so well. The couple in
front of me scribbled pictures of suicide fantasies on scrap
paper, while the guy behind me sat down in protest.
"I'm just going to read a little bit more, and then you'll
get to hear The Magnetic Fields," Moody told us, as if even
he knew his readings were a punishment. "But we want
you, Rick!" shouted the aggravated guy behind me, sarcastically. Nevertheless, the audience was patient enough
Moody finished as he promised and The Magnetic Fields
entered, not a moment too soon.
Merritt's deep voice, barely amplified, was more powerful than any stereo could ever reproduce and his forlorn
eyes were intoxicating. Golson balanced the equation with
her sparkling, energetic piano accompaniment and vocal
harmony. She dazzled the crowd with her sweetness in
"Reno Dakota." Electric cellist Sam Davol's face was expressionless, but his solos were rich, especially in "Come
Back From San Francisco." John Woo, the band's consistent, precise guitarist and banjo player, simply crossed his
legs and smiled. They were delightful and saddening, light
and serious
ridiculous enough to rhythmically zip a
jacket zipper as substitute percussion, and nerdy enough
to sneak in a Camus allusion.
But, for all the band's fabulous playing, a loud bunch
remained at the bar, peeving both the band and the audience with its unceasing chatter. "I will now perform a song
called 'The Book of Love,'" said Merritt, addressing the
noisy drinkers in the back. "It requires intense concentration, so please use telepathy only." In spite of his appeal,
the drinking group muttered over Merritt's solo ukulele.

Joey Ramone, dead at 49
BY MORGHAN HOLT
I just want to take a moment to extend a personal thank
you to the late Joey Ramone, who, at 49, died Sunday, April
15, 2001 from lymphoma. I want to thank Joey for pioneering a musical genre that I've grown to love and that my
roommate has, based on the past year of rolled eyes and
hyperbolized complaints about my "hardcore" tunes, grown
to hate equally as much. But, god, I do love punk.
There are days when it gets under my skin, the urge to
pop in a Rancid orBad Religion disc or even to listen to the
more contemporary, more mainstreamed Blink-182. There
are days when I need the release that the fast-paced, hard-

hitting chords allow me. There are days when life's too
mellow and my insides itch, and on days like these punk
music has never failed to meet my need for a moment of
unstructured intensity. I have the Ramones to thank for its

presence

in my life.

Joey Ramone (a.k.a. Jeff Hyman), lead singer of the
Ramones, helped lighten up the rock 'n roll arena, when it
most needed it. The Ramones brought an insouciant, "doit-yourself' style and an explosive sound to the forefront
when they evolved in 1974 from a less musically inclined
band, the Queens. From there, punk rock exploded.
Joe Strummer, lead singer of the Clash, calls the Ramones
"the daddy punk group of all time," and it's a pretty accurate attribution. Schooled by the Ramones' 1976 tour of England, directly following their first album's release, British
bands like the Sex Pistols and the Clash emerged. And their
innovative influence resonates throughout the genre: from
earlier bands like Blondie and the Talking Heads to the more
recent Offspring and Green Day, the Ramones, though five
years disbanded, remain pervasive in the music.
Just as Elvis Presley, pioneer of the rock 'n roll era, is
fondly remembered for his contributions to the world of
music, so too will Joey Ramone be remembered, even if on
a much smaller scale, for his addition. Punk is an everexpanding musical field and, whatever direction it takes,
it will be forever indebted to the Ramones and the man
who, clad in leather jacket, tinted glasses and permanently
torn jeans, set the ball in motion.
Although the Ramones never attained any great com-

mercial success or even
made it onto the Billboard
Top 40, they released nearly
thirty albums and compilations over the course oftheir
twenty-two year career and
produced the likes of "Beat
on the Brat" and "Teenage
Lobotomy," works for which
I, personally, will always be
grateful. So thanks, Joey, for
livening up the rock world
and starting a trend that's
made my days a little easier.
And may you rest in peace,

no longer needing or wanting "to be sedated."

Renee Zellweger plays a slightly frumpy Bridget Jones; Colin Firth appears as Mark Darcy, one of her love interests.

Finally, a woman can be a romantic lead and get plenty of laughs
BY ESTER BLOOM
Dear, dear Diary:
It is very rare in mainstream movies to see a woman
portrayed as bothridiculous and sexy. In the world according to Hollywood, women can either get laughs without
being romantic leads (like Rosie O'Donnell and Joan
Cusack) or get men without the laughs (too many dull,
bleached women to mention). "Bridget Jones' Diary" is an
exception, which might have something to do withthe fact
that its director, Sharon Maguire, is a woman.
Initially, the film takes a risk. Bridget Jones (Renee
Zellweger), a 30-something, perpetually single Londoner,
slightly frumpy, slightly fleshy (by Tinseltown standards)
and more than slightly flawed, is not a typical heroine and
certainly not a conventional candidate for love. On-screen
sex is almost always reserved for women with flat stomachs; Renee Zellweger, who, to much publicity, added 20
pounds for the role, as well as dimples and folds, is almost
like a normal female. And still, she's unabashedly adorable.
Bridget's boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant),for one, is
smitten. He begins a flirtatious e-mail correspondence with
her at work. He's charming, clever, articulate, well-dressed,
but quite possibly an emotional fuckwit precisely the
type of man Bridget vowed in her diary-entered New Year's
Resolution to avoid. She has also vowed to cut back on her
cigarettes and alcohol, but, as each scene shows her with
one or the other in hand, it's abundantly clear how religiously she adheres to her convictions.
Before long, she and Daniel are shagging and having
an altogether glorious time. This gives her a much-needed
defense against the barrage of presumptuous comments
from the "smug marrieds." These terribly dressed, falsely
cheerful folks pop up like whack-a-moles wherever she
goes: "Tick-tock, tick-tock," they say to Bridget, wagging
their fingers.
Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a solemn, successful barrister, categorically belongs with these abominations in
Bridget's mind, partly because her over-eager mother keeps
pressing him on her. When they meet for the first time,
Darcy is wearing a terriblereindeer sweater, doesn't laugh
at Bridget's jokes and, with her still in earshot, makes a
few choice, harsh comments about her.
Then Daniel Cleaver reveals that Darcy had an affair
with Cleaver's fiancee, which solidifies his enemy status
in Bridget's mind. Meanwhile, Cleaver is Bridget's dream
man. He takes her on expensive vacations, talks dirty to
her, encourages her to be ridiculous and generally can't
get enough ofher. Bridget all but disappears into clouds of
-

euphoria. Naturally, it's too good to last.
Things look their worst when Darcy reappears, contrite
and in a better sweater. Suddenly, Bridget has two options.
One of the most amusing scenes in the film occurs when
the tension between Bridget's suitors reaches the nosebreaking point and they take a fistfight out into the street,
into a restaurant and back into the street again.
Renee Zellweger does a lovely job with Bridget. Many
people were skeptical of the casting choice, since Bridget
is supposed to be an Everywoman. How could she be portrayed by the woman who "completes" Tom Cruise? But
Zellweger throws herselfinto the role by throwing her inhibitions to the wind, which ensures thatthe audience will
respond to her abandon and wind up loving her for it. Her
male leads certainly do.
On that note, I have to confess that I actually liked Hugh
Grant, maybe because his character is so villainous. The
ironed-on wistful look doesn't appear until halfway through
and, even then, we're not forced to sympathize with him.

What a relief.
Fans of the book will note that there are a few discrepancies. The focus is mainly on men in the movie and, while
they get their share ofattention in print, more time is spent
examining Bridget's other charming eccentricities. The
movie also follows a more typical Hollywood pattern than
the book. Certain outcomes are predictable and, of course,
there's the unavoidable low, sappy background music at

key sappy moments.

Still, the film stays true to the spirit ofHelen Fielding's
novel and to the character of Bridget. "Bridget Jones' Diary" is no "Princess Bride," but for a literary adaptation
(and a romantic comedy), it's impressive.

Guided By Voices' latest reflects singer's personal pain
BY JOEL BLECHER
"The Robert Pollard All-Beer Diet" doesn't seem to work
for anyone but Robert Pollard. And it effortlessly worked
its magic again when Pollard led Guided By Voices (GBV)
to release their new album "Isolation Drills" on April 3.
This Dayton, Ohio band's prolific middle-aged singersongwriter is famous for his indecipherable stream-of-consciousness lyrics, often dismissing English syntax, concen-

trating on each lyrical phrase's acoustics to produce impenetrable yet charming indie classics such as "Gold Heart
Mountaintop Queen Directory." In "Isolation Drills," he
once again wrestles with the dilemma of language and meaning, but this time in a much more self-conscious way. To
make his point, he sometimes concedes to channel his creativity into semi-intelligible lyrics, hurling Guided By
Voices into uncharted territory for the 21st century.
Musically, most of the songs recycle the same motifs and
rhythms that GBV patented in their 1997 album "Mag
Earwhig" (Matador). Moreover, songs repeat the neighboring tracks on the album five of the songs begin with the

same chord.

Yet, despite the repetition, Guided By Voices makes time
for diversity. The saccharine flavor of"Glad Girls," which
leaves most musicians dissatisfied, contrasts with
"Unspirited," which is both rhythmically and lyrically complex, revealing the band's more mature, polished side. Overall, Pollard is still churning out captivating and catchy
melodies "Twilight Campfighter" is a song you could sing
in the shower for hours.
Although it's pointedly set to the tune of peppy rock 'n'
roll, this album is, inversely, one of deeply personal struggle

he sings abouthow he doesn't "care about being sober... leave

the album's climactic song, "Run Wild."
"Think of a no-parking zone," he chants, "where armored

in the chorus' powerful rock anthem: "Leave your things in
the streets, and run wild." It's clear that he feels constricted,
but he refuses to explain why.
I suspect that he may be battling with a deeper linguistic
struggle, which he confronts in the album's lively opener,
"Fair Touching." After a baffling verse of non sequiturs, he
declares, "perhaps at last, the song you sing will have meaning." His post-modern suggestion, serious and subtle, is that
value can be found outside the conventional narrative lyrics
of today's music; that is, the audience should be able to ap...

Although "Isolation Drills" may not deliver the raw, uncut
talentthat GBV commanded in the mid-90s, it canonizes a few
more indie classics for those dedicated fans. In an age where
-

rock musicians have shut themselves up with their own
tongues, Robert Pollard once again kicks and screams his way
through the millennial gloom, turning language on its head
with a little skill, a catchy tune and a few bottles ofbeer.

Stubborn crowd mars concert
From FIELDS, pg. 15

They behaved no better for the following song, forcing a grumbling Merritt to
cut it in the middle. "Let's just skip this
song," he said. "They're not listening."
If they lacked energy at any point during the concert, they gained it back and
then some with "The Luckiest Guy On
The Lower East Side," which bulged with
humor and movement. Merritt made
faces at Golson for the poor sound quality of Trocadero's amps. As Merritt lit
his sixth cigarette, Golson affectionately
whimpered about how the Philadelphia
traffic prevented them from to seeing
"the great sights." Referring to the
crowd's rudeness, Merritt grunted sarcastically, "Yet, what could be more glorious than to be before you all tonight?"
When an absent-minded woman's cell
phone went off, Merritt mocked her by
pretending to answer his own phone, to
which Golson naively responded,
"Stephin, did you really forget to turn
your cell phone off?!"
The concert came to a climax with
"Yeah, Oh Yeah," performed in indie-pop
double time. The crowd welcomed it with

cheers. Merritt lit another cigarette and
cued their final song, which was unfortunately undermined by more noise from
the bar. Merritt nearly walked offbefore
he finished playing.

'Killer'

This coming Wednesday's Hong Kong/Taiwan movie is
"The Killer/Die xue shuang xiong," a 1989 John Woo masterpiece. "This film willblow you away," was the tagline of
this bloody gangster hit. Chow Yun-Fat stars as an aboutto-retire assassin who takes one last assignment to help a

An unfinished novel, a stolen car, a murdered pet and a failing marriage are just a
few of the crises piling up in this hilarious story of bright promise gone awry. During a
single hectic weekend, Michael Douglas' college professor scrambles to gather a life that
has suddenly reeled out of control. Joining the frenzy are his gifted but troubled student
(Tobey Maguire), his eccentric editor (Robert Downey, Jr.) and the married chancellor
of his university (Frances McDormand), who is pregnant with his child. Directed by
Curtis Hanson, this darkly comedic odyssey of self-discovery was hailed by Roger Ebert

College permits alcohol
at spec weekend parties

Council urges Mind the Light
not to protest at graduation
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

"but that graduation [is] not one of those events, except possibly for graduating students themselves to

BY HOFAN CHAU

Student Council has responded to the possibility of further Mind the Light protests with a
letter requesting that the group refrain from engaging in such activities during graduation.
The letter, which was sent to Mind the Light
President BillRobinson '6O and addressed to all Mind
the Light members, requested that the group, formed
in response to the Board of Managers' December
decision about athletics, not stage any protest at
graduation. The council said it wanted to allow
"Swarthmore students to enjoy their graduation free
from disruptive and discomforting activities."
In the letter, the council conceded that "despite
the inappropriate nature of some of the protests
made at Family Weekend," the event, as well as
Alumni Weekend, were "appropriate time[s] for
Mind the Light parents to demonstrate their unhappiness with the college."
However, they argued that graduation was a
time to celebrate the achievements of the senior
class, and should be a time of happiness, relief,
and joy, not a time for non-students to take ac-

make any protests."

The administration has decided to forgo a ban on parties with alcohol
during this year's Admitted Students Weekend, which starts tomorrow.
"Last year, when we said no parties with alcohol, it created a rather
artificial atmosphere," said Assistant Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie.
"We found that students who wanted to drink drank anyway."
Goundie said the deans, RAs and admissions staff thought it would be
safer to have alcohol served in places that could be controlled. He added
that the administration is not trying to encourage admitted students to
attend such parties. Any parties with alcohol "would be heavily PAed to
and that ages are
make sure none of the admitted students got in
checked," he said.
Student Council member Sara Edelstein 'O3 reported at the council
meeting Monday night that no proposal had been submitted for Social
Affairs Committee (SAC) funding over the weekend.By Tuesday, the committee had persuaded Phi Psi fraternity to host an event at Olde Club

tions that may make seniors and their guests feel

"uncomfortable and besieged."
"We feel that Mind the Light does have a right
to protest at appropriate events," council Educational Policy Representative Peter Holm 'Ol said,

The letter was written in response to a letter from

Mind the Light member Dave Rowley '65, published
in the April 5 issue of The Phoenix. In the letter,
Rowley said that Mind the Light will "continue to
make ourselves known at graduation, alumni day
and other college meetings until we get the college
administration to face up to the fact that their decision-making process is flawed."
Holm, a senior who expects to graduate this June,
said, "Frankly, I would be embarrassed if my parents and family were subjected to something similar
to what happened during Family Weekend. I just
want to graduate in peace, and I will be angry ifMind
the Light is not respectful of that."
Siobhan Carty 'Ol added, "As a member of the badminton team, I understand the feelings of many members ofMind the Light and of other groups, but I think
that graduation is a time for the senior class to be
celebrated and congratulated for their work and success. I think a disruption, of any kind, would be disrespectful to the senior class
even if some members of the senior class were negatively affected by
Swarthmore decisions."
Though the council has not yet received a response from Mind the Light, Holm said they expect
to receive one soon.

Deans approve wilderness
program for fall break
BY JON EHRENFELD
Starting next fall, freshmen who want to start college away from campus will be have the opportunity to participate in the Swarthmore Wilderness Orientation Program (SwOOP). Conceived last year and based on
similar programs at other colleges, SwOOP's pilot program has recently
been approved by the deans.
During the 2001 fall break, approximately 10 to 12 leaders will take a
group of freshmen and possibly faculty and staff to a wilderness preserve
in the Delaware Water Gap. Since this is the group's first year, subsequent programs, trips and training will be predicated upon the first trip.
Last year, Christine Hancock 'O2 wrote to the Outsiders Club about
forming a wilderness orientation program. Planning for SwOOP began in
earnest when four freshmen became interested in the idea. To a large
extent, it is based on wilderness orientation programs at other schools,
especially Princeton's Outdoor Action. Considered among the best in the
country, Outdoor Action takes over half of all freshmen at Princeton on a

trip.
Giving students the opportunity to live in the wilderness and backpack is only one aspect of the program. The group's proposal says experience in"the wilderness classroom" also results in personal improvement
and "interpersonal skills that are essential to survival in the college environment."
In February, SwOOP met with a group of deans to propose the program and begin discussing logistics and budgeting. Joseph Florence 'O4,

one of the group's founders, said the meetings were productive because
"we were able to flesh out a lot of the problems they had with it." Since
then, the group has been working primarily with Associate Dean Anna

Maria Cobo.

One problem that surfaced early was the matter of training. Citing
safety and insurance concerns, the deans requested that SwOOP's organizers ensure a certain level of training in the student leaders. For one
week before fall classes start, around a dozen selected leaders will train
in outdoor safety, backpacking techniques and group dynamics. Gary
Nussbaum '7l, who is an EMT and runs outdoor education programs at
Radford College in Virginia, will conduct the training. One of his colleagues
will accompany the SwOOP group on the leader training trip and the freshman pilot trip over fall break.
The actual trips will travel on trails in the Delaware Water Gap, which
is about 120 miles from campus. Since there will be more than one trip,
they will possibly vary in difficulty, ranging from three to eight miles a
day with packs weighing from 30 to 60 lbs. The leaders are concerned that
the trips not be too strenuous and not focus on the ardor of the task. "We
don't want that aspect to limit anyone," Florence said.
At this stage of the program, it is difficult for SwOOP's founders to
anticipate the level of freshman interest, but they are optimistic. The
group's proposal indicated that two-thirds of the freshman class would be
interested in participating in the type of trip that will be offered. Florence, who also expects "a lot of freshman interest," said that the leaders
will be able to accommodate a large range of trip sizes.
The SwOOP leaders have wide-ranging goals for their program. Florence indicated that he would like to see SwOOP branch out and include
activities such as canoeing and. climbing, again using the model of Outdoor Action. In addition, there is talk of creating a Tri-College wilderness
orientation program, thereby augmenting and strengthening the ailing
Bi-College wilderness program at Haverford and Bryn Mawr.

Female runners
dominate JHU and
at Moravian tourney
BY MARK JANOFF

L

The Swarthmore women's team notched a resounding
team victory Saturday, April 7, collecting a total of 78
points to Johns Hopkins' 42.
Notable female performers included Imo Akpan 'O2,
who continued her unmatched dominance of the 100meter and 200-meter dashes with respective times of 12.3
and 25.8 seconds. In a women's 3000-meter field flooded
with lady Blue Jays, Joko Agunloye 'Ol and Sarah Jay
'Ol placed first and second with respective times of 10:29.5
and 10:40.3.
The Swarthmore men's team did not fare as well
against Hopkins, losing the overall points battle 90-4
Nonetheless, several men recorded solid performances.
In the men's 110-meter hurdles, Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 finished
first, with Matt Williams 'O4 a close second. Mat Rapoza
'O3 continued his excellent throwing, placing first in the
men's shot-put with a throw of 39'03.25".
The track and field teams faced a broader field of com-

petition at Moravian College's Greyhound Invitational

last Saturday, April 14.Akpan performed at her usual best,
easily winning the women's 400-meter with a time of 58.38,

more than three seconds faster than her closest competitor. Akpan also placed second in the women's 200-meter.
In the 4x400 women's relay, the team of Akpan, Jay,
Njideka Akunyili 'O4 and Katie Robinson 'O4 took first
place with a time of 4:10.4.
The most phenomenal triumph for the women's team,
however, was Agunloye's NCAA Automatic Qualifying
and school record time of 36:43.41 in the 10K race. That
time also earned her second place in that contest.
Agunloye will join teammate Marc Jeuland 'Ol at the
NCAA Division 111 Track and Field Championships May

23-26 at Millikin University in Decatur, 111.
The Swarthmore men also posted solid performances.
In the men's 1500-meter, Joe Makin 'O3 notched a personal best with a time of 4:2121. Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol
also recorded a personal best at the tournament, with a
time of 2:03.57 in the men's 800-meter. Later, Dieringer
noted, "As a senior, I have to gather my rosebuds while
I still can."
Time is running short for the seniors on the team,
which has two more local tournaments before the Centennial Conference Championships at Muhlenberg on
May 4-6.

Garnet makes mincemeat of Salisbury State
BY MIKE NOREIKA
The men's tennis team faced South Region foe Salisbury
State this past Saturday. Although it was not one of the
more difficult matches scheduled this season, the match
held significant weight for the regional rankings, for if the
Garnet lost this match the hope of a national spotlight
would have been dashed. But the Garnet excelled and defeated the overmatched SSU Sea Gulls 7-0.
The Garnet started the day strongly, winning two of the
three doubles matches and thereby gaining the doubles
point to take an early lead. At first doubles, Pete Schilla
'Ol and John Thomas 'O2 continued their incredible season, knocking off a solid SSU doubles team. At third
doubles, Justin Singer 'O3 and Frank Visciano 'O4 won big,
extending their winning streak to three matches.
The team then went on to sweep the singles matches.
Schilla played another solid match, winning at first singles.
Thomas outlasted his SSU opponent, winning a tough one
in three sets at the No. 2 position. Singer won easily at No.
3, continuing his upswing from a slight slump in the beginning of the spring. At fourth singles, Jayson Yost 'O3,
coming off his gutsy victory last week against Trinity, pummeled his opponent in less than an hour. Of the quickest
match of the day, an impressed Thomas said, "Yet again,

Yost was an animal."
In other matches, Visciano won in straight sets at the
No. 5 position, and Scott Grant 'Ol, as he has been prone to
do this season, won his match in three sets in the sixth
spot.
The more important tennis news of the week is the release of the mid-spring regional rankings. The highly anticipated rankings give an estimate as to who will be playing where in the NCAA tournament. Swarthmore jumped
from a pre-season ranking of fifth in the South Region to a
very respectable fourth. The three teams ahead of
Swarthmore are Emory, Washington College and University of the South, respectively. Both Emory and Washington College have defeated the Garnet earlier this season,

and Swarthmore has yet to face University of the South.
University of the South and Swarthmore have identical
records against the same teams this season, but a head-tohead match is not to be expected this year. The No. 4 ranking in the South Region means that Swarthmore will most
likely play Mary Washington in the first round of the NCAA

regional bracket and Emory in the second round. Both
matches will take place at Emory, in Thomas' home state of
Georgia.
Along with the team rankings came the individual
rankings, in which two Garnet players surfaced. After a
couple of big wins, Schilla moved up four spots, to sixth in
the region. A little further down the list (although some
members of the Swarthmore tennis community believe he
should be higher), Thomas moved up two spots from the preseason rankings to 17th. The consensus on the team is that
Thomas would be higher were he not a second singles player,
making it difficult to rank him above other schools' first
singles players. In the doubles rankings, the team of Schilla/
Thomas remained steadfast at No. 4.
With another win under its belt, the Garnet enters the
last match of the season with confidence and a 7-5 record.
The hope is for the momentum to carry them through the
regional playoffs and into the national tournament finals in
May. The last regular-season match of the year is this Tuesday, April 24 against tri-co rival Haverford. Matches begin
at 3:30 p.m. at Haverford, with a rain location of the Mullan
Center.

BY FRANK MARTINEZ

The Swarthmore College baseball team continued
to struggle this past week. The young team lost several relatively close games, failing to do the little things
that end up making the difference.
After losing 18-7 at Washington College earlier last
week, the team sought to split the season series with
a home game on Friday, April 13. Unfortunately the
team came out flat and went down 9-1 early on. Drew
Adams 'O3 threw three-plus innings of good middle

relief as Swarthmore climbed back into the game, but
a two-run deficit was as close as the Garnet got to the
Shoremen.

Carlton Davis 'O4 followed Adams to finish the game
strongly. Davis, who is second in the Centennial Conference with 11 strikeouts per nine innings pitched,
continues to throw well, using his unorthodox style
to deliver his overpowering fastball and sharp curve.
In the end, the initial letdown was too much to overcome. Swarthmore lost 12-9.
In Saturday, April 14's doubleheader at Dickinson
College, the team seemed to sleepwalk through the first
game. In probably the season's quickest match-up, the
Garnet lost 4-2 as neither team did anything extraordinary. On a positive note, rookie pitcher Matt
Goldstein 'O4 threw the complete game in one of the
season's best efforts and allowed only three earned
runs. Without any help from the offense, Goldstein
still picked up the loss.
It was in the second game of the twinbill that the
team most distressingly failed to take advantage of
wide-open opportunities. After not much run production in the first game, the team jumped out to a 3-0
lead after the first half-inning.
Things were looking bright as the opposing starting pitcher was having control problems. With three
runs already in, the bases were loaded with nobody
out, yet the team could not capitalize on the opportunity. With the chance to put Dickinson away early,
the next two batters struck out, followed by a pop up
to end the inning.
Until the last inning, the score was tied up at sixall. A key base-running mistake prevented

Swarthmorefrom taking the lead. Then Dickinson had
its chance, and Swarthmore fell apart. The team gave
up four runs and did not make the one big defensive
play that could have prevented the collapse that ultimately led to a 10-6 loss.
Third baseman Ryan Pannorfi 'O4 was 5-for-6
against Dickinson. Pannorfi went 9-for-16 on the
week with a double, a triple, three RBIs, three stolen
bases and three runs scored. He earned Centennial
Conference Weekly Honor Roll laurels for his performances.

The most recent game for Swarthmore was Tuesday, April 17, at Franklin and Marshall. Again, the
team came out lackadaisical and flat. Despite the 12-3
final score, however, there were some bright spots for
the Garnet. Defensively, Goldstein made a fantastic
diving catch in right field, and catcher Josh Lindsey
'Ol flashed his strong arm by throwing out a pair of
runners attempting to steal and made his presence
felt with a nice tag at the plate. Kushner provided the
offense with a three-run homer in the fifth, while in
relief pitching work, Mike DiFilipo 'O4 had his best
outing of the season.
Later this week, the Swarthmore baseball team
will have plenty of chances to put together a complete effort and win a few games. The Garnet hosts
Washington and Lee this afternoon and Franklin
and Marshall on Friday, April 20. Everyone is invited to come on down to the diamond to cheer on
the Tide.
Will Ryan Chahrour make his way back into the
lineup? Will either of the Chan brothers get a chance
to contribute? Will Jacob Cortes crack a smile? The
team has been having good pitching, some solid defense, and is finally scoring someruns. Hopefully they
can put it all together for a few wins.

BRIEFS
Swat softball lookin' strong
Despite a difficult double-header loss to
on Saturday, April 14, the Lady Garnet
pulled it together to find a solid conference win
against Washington College on Tuesday, April 17. The
bats were hot and the defense impenetrable as the
Tide defeated the Shorewomen 5-0 in the first of a
chilling doubleheader series. The Lady Garnet
started early at the plate with back-to-back doubles
Gettysburg

from Stephanie Wotjkowski 'O2 and Pam Lavallee 'O3
to score Swat's first run in the top of the first inning.
Lindsay VanSciver 'O3 pitched a complete game with
four strikeouts and scattering four hits to claim the
Tide's first shutout of the season. Swarthmore
dropped the second game to Washington, 5-L
The team, anxious to find a win after a devastating loss to the Mules earlier last week, traveled to
Gettysburg on Saturday, April 14, to face the Bullets
in a two-game series. Ending in a double loss for the
Tide, the Bullets were able to seek revenge for the
Lady Garnet's surprise upset last season. Swat softball now stands at 2-9 in the conference and 2-18 overall. The Tide faces Franklin and Marshall on Saturday, April 21, then has a make-up home game with
the Mules on Monday, April 23, and the final game of
the season at home on Tuesday, April 24 against crosstown rivals Haverford.

Women's tennis one win from title
On Wednesday, the women's tennis team pulled a
major upset against Haverford College 5-4. Battling
against post-winter winds, the Garnet lost all three
doubles matches to the Black Squirrels. Relying
heavily on the singles matches, the Garnet Tide pulled
through. Straight set wins came from first and third
singles. Anjani Reddy 'O4 dominated Haverford's
Alyssa Kennedy 7-5,6-2, while Kristina Pao 'O4 crushed
Kendra Metzger 6-2, 6-2. Having lost their first sets,
fifth and sixth singles players Katherine Voll 'O3 and
rookie Audrey Dorelien 'O4 came back to win in three
sets. The winning match came from second singles
Caroline Celano 'O4, who defeated Joanna Grayer in
three sets, 6-1, 6-7 (7-3), 6-2.
Top singles Reddy, Celano and Pao continued their
undefeated conference records, while the team conference record is now 9-0. With one conference match remaining at Western Maryland this Saturday, the Garnet is one win away from the conference title, which it
has not won since 1995. The next home match will be
against the College of N.J. Monday at 4 p.m.

Lady Laxers split Centennial
Conference weekend to go 1-1
BY KATE NELSON-LEE
A playoff berth was on the line in the
Garnet vs. Diplomats conference
matchup on Saturday, April 14.
Swarthmore needed a win to stay in contention for the four-team playoff tournament, and Franklin and Marshallneeded
the win to shore up the second seed. Unfortunately for the Lady Laxers' post-season hopes, the Dips pulled out a 10-7 win.
Katie Tarr 'O2, the Tide's leading scoring machine, lit up the scoreboard first

with a quick goal in the first few minutes
of the game. The Garnet outshot the Dips
20-8 and scooped up 24 ground balls to
F&M's 14, but a 10-save-strong show in goal
by F&M's Madhavi Rao kept the Garnet

from the lead at half. The Diplomats
worked hard for a lead 4-3 at halftime.
In the second half, F&M pulled ahead
by as much as four goals. With just three

minutes remaining, the Garnet launched
a two-goal scoring surge to attempt to
regain the lead, but it was not enough,
as the Diplomats scored one late insurance goal to take the game.
Tarr scored a game-high four goals
and had one assist, while Mavis Biss 'O2,
Liz Brainard 'O3 and Jackie Kahn 'O4
each added one for the Garnet. Jenn Hart
'O3 had a solid day in goal with 10 saves.
Hart sits on top of the Centennial Conference goalie statistics with a 58.4 percent save record. Kristen English 'Ol celebrated her birthday by making the Centennial Conference Weekly Honor Roll

for her six-goal, four-assist week.

On Tuesday, April 17, the Lady Laxers

traveled to Muhlenberg College for a
night game on the Mules' turf in the rain.
The Garnet schooled the Mules in turf
play, leading by as much as 10 points
early in the second half and ending with
a 15-10 win despite a late Mules comeback against the Garnet's second string.
Six different Swarthmore players
scored, while Hart had 15 saves.
The Lady Laxers will host Western
afternoon at 4 p.m.

Rugby wins both over Bryn Mawr-Haverford team
BY JOANNE JACOBSON

This Saturday, April 14, the women's rugby team played its final home game of
the season against the Horned Toads, Bryn Mawr and Haverford's joint team. It
sunshine, warm weather and two
was a picture perfect farewell to the seniors
Swarthmore victories.
Captain Nancy Craig 'Ol scored the first three points of the game off a penalty
kick and then just couldn't be stopped, scoring all 18 of the Quakers' points. After
the first kick, she went on to send the ball sailing through the uprights again for
another three points at the end of the first half. She kept going strong in the second half, scoring each of Swarthmore's two tries. Craig earned Swat seven more
points on a quick penalty play on the try line followed by a successful conversion
kick.

Phil Meehan 'Ol kept the action going, racing the ball up the center of the field
through many gawking BiCo players. When they finally caught up with her,
Meehan popped the ball off to Craig for another try. The BiCo team was only able
to score one try, at the very end, leaving a final score of 18-5 for the Quakers.
B-side trounced the BiCo team in a 19-0 shutout. The first try was by rookie
sensation Abigail Frost 'O4 off a forward play. Minutes later, flyhalf Kirsten Vannice
'O4 faked the ball wide and brought it back into the center of play, passing it to
inside center Joanne Jacobson 'O3. She ran it halfway upfield within inches of the
tryline, posting into the defender to form a ruck. The forwards maintained possession of the ball, and prop Julie George 'O2 ran it into the try zone. On both tries,
Vannice's golden foot racked up a Swarthmore conversion. Eight-man Dani HoltLyman 'O3 ended the game on a sweet note, earning Swarthmore yet another try
to bring the final score to 19-0.
The Horned Toads departed unsatisfied, but it was a fitting final home game
for the class of 200

Worms prep for sectionals

Undermanned team visits Yale, returns with 2-4 record

B-team goes winless at
Spring Fling tournament

BY ANNA MASILELA

Eight members of the men's frisbee team arrived
in New Haven, Ct, last weekend for the Yale Cup, the
last big tournament before the team faces single-elimination games at Sectionals. They brought back a 2-4
record to members of the team who were waylaid by
illness or injury and opted not to make the journey to
the home of the Bulldogs.
The biggest win, however, came on Sunday night,
where the Earthworms were judged best partiers
among the 20 teams that attended the tournament.
"We knew we couldn't win the tournament with eight
guys, so we did what we could," said Evan Gregory

'OL

Even when only eight members of the Earthworms
show up for a tournament, the team can have a good
time, said tri-captain Brandon Silverman 'O2. "The
eight of us took it with a grain of salt," he said of competing with about half the usual number of teammates. "We tried, but we also had fun." The Earthworms beat Vassar and Boston University and fell to
Tufts, Middlebury, Brandeis and MIT.
With such small numbers, the players had to be
adventurous and risky with their throws. The Earthworms threw six thumbers for points during the tour-

nament. The throw is particularly well respected in
the ultimate community because of its difficulty. It
allows a thrower to pass to the dark side, the side
where the defender is applying the most pressure.

Unlike the forehand and the backhand, which involve
a side-to-side motion, the thumber allows the thrower
to execute a back-to-front overhead motion. In the
Vassar game, the Earthworms showed off some stellar moves, including two thumbers and a P-play. During a turnover near the endline, the handler put the
frisbee right through the legs of the mark and to the
front of the stack for a point.
When the Earthworms weren't entrenched in their
own turf, they were supporting other teams. "When
we came to watch the Bucknell women play, they were
losing 12-9," said Silverman. "But after we cheered
them on, they ended up winning 14-12."
The Metro-East Sectionals begin in two weeks,
with the top two teams moving on to Regionals. According to Earthworm lore, the team advanced to
Regionals sometime in the 19705, but Silverman could
not confirm the validity of the story. The Earthworms
have not competed in Regionals in more recent history.

Although Cornell has taken the lead in the MetroEast section and is a sure bet for Regionals, the Earthworms are among the five other competitive teams,
including Princeton, George Washington, University
of Maryland and University of Delaware, that are
hoping to advance on the other bid.
This Saturday, the Earthworms will be hosting an
alumni game. Many of the alumni who played frisbee
during their years at Swarthmore are still playing,
this time in the more competitive club circuit.

Ruggers fall to Vassar; close out season vs. Widener Saturday
BY DAVID THOMAS
On Saturday, the men's rugby team awoke early
to travel to Vassar for a noon game. The team slept
most of the way there and it showed, as they came out
flat and got behind early, never to gain the lead.
The game began well enough, with Vassar converting a penalty on their first drive down the field,
then following it up with a try in the corner to make
the score 8-0 at the half— a half which came 10 minutes before it should have, thanks to refereeing which
resulted in a 30-minutefirst half and a 45-minute second half. In addition, Swarthmore had its lineout
incorrectly ruled illegal and were off-balance the rest

of the game.
There were some bright spots for Swarthmore, how-

ever. Charlie Brubaker 'O2 made some excellent tackles as well as going almost all the way on a run towards the end of the first half. In addition, with captain Kyung Lee 'O2 out because of injury, Les Fox 'O2
got his first start of the season and showed Vassar he
deserved it with a couple of strong runs and quite a
few punishing tackles.
Swarthmore will now look forward to its last home
game this Saturday against Widener at 1 p.m. on
DuPont Field. This will also mark the last game Dupont
before the field gets turned into a parking lot, so come
out to see the end of an era.

BY ANDREW GREGORY
This weekend the Swarthmore Earthworms sent their B-team to
Pennsylvania State University to compete in the ludicrously competitive Spring Fling tournament. Despite being matched up against
nationally renowned Ultimate teams such as Juniataand Lehigh and
having a depleted roster (largely because of the Ken Zuckerman concert on campus Friday night), the Earthworms were very positive
reflecting back on their 0-5 record. "It was raw," said Dan Marrin, 'OL
"We went out and played tough, but sometimes the other team just
deserves it." The weather played a huge factor; rain and wind affected throws and the fields were quickly churned into mud pits.
The 'Worms tough luck started early with a 13-0 shutout against
regional powerhouse Bucknell, but they managed to keep their chins
up for the second game of the day against Lehigh. Matt Rubin 'O4 caught
the first Swarthmore score of the day, a hammer in the corner of the
endzone, after which there was much celebration. Unfortunately, the
brilliant score only enraged Lehigh, who proceeded to score 10 consecutive points before Dave Berger 'O4 brought Swarthmore back into
the game, sprinting end line to end line for the score on a huck. Captain Ari Houser 'Ol scored the very next drive on a similar play, but
the late game heroics were not enough. Swat went down 12-3.
In the next game versus Juniata, Swarthmore finally hit their groove.
Berger, Houser and Danny Loss 'O4 all broke long for scores, whileRoban
Kramer 'O3 laid out in his once immaculate clothes for spectacular
catches. Juniata's offense was slowedby defensive plays from Suor Kim

'O3 and Dave "The Metro" Urban 'O4, but Swat couldn't contain one of
the country's top club players, Ed Shelby. Shelby, 6'5" and 400 pounds of
sleek muscle, laid out for the winning point, wiping the disc down the
back of defender Andrew Gregory 'O4. The game finished at 13-5.
Swat B decided to play through the next two games with neither
breaks between games nor breaks for the half. Vassar and Penn State
Alumni threw huck, smoked marijuana and laid out on their way to
rout the Earthworms. The one opportunity for a score in the two
games was squandered when Berger laid out to block a pass clearly
intended for Rubin in the endzone. The team strife escalated after
this botched play, culminating in the PSU Alumni having to separate
the two 'Worms players. Without their team cohesion, Swat was collectively downed 26-0 by Vassarand the PSU Alums in the two games.
Despite this seemingly large margin of defeat, the 'Worms still kept
their spirits high enough to compete in the annual Spring Fling Water Chug and upset the reigning champs Penn State on their home
field by draining their gallon of water in under two minutes. Loss
cryptically reported, "Oh, we'll be back next year. We'll be back."

BEING THE BALL
with Joe Gerlitz
Failure and redemption;
a haircut, toothpaste and
a pack of baseball cards

Lady Laxers hit Centennial

homestretch, now 7-5

Will all the wild and crazy sports fans out there stand
up and give a cheer?
Major League Baseball season is finally here.

And we're loving it so far. Go Mariners!
So anyways, I wanted to get a haircut yesterday, but
no one was around to do the deed. So I got Sean
Brandveen 'o3's car keys and went to look for his car,
which he claims was parked on the street by Willets.
Of course I get there and the Poop-mobile is nowhere in
sight. So I walk to Cunningham, thento Bond
still no
sign ofhis car. I'm starting to mumble under my breath.
I think maybe he left it in the Ville and forgot to tell me,
so I walk down, cross the tracks, talk to Joe Policeman
handing out his daily allowance of parking tickets
just to find what I'm sure you're all guessing, that Sean's
...

spot is empty.
Well, I'm pretty bitter at this point.
All I wanted was a frickin' $5 haircut! I'm a busy
man! I can't wander around for half an hour looking for

a car!

So I walk into the Ville, and go into the drugstore to
get some toothpaste, because I'm all out. As I'm grabbing some Tom's, I look in my wallet and there's only
seven bucks inside. This sucks, I think to myself. I can't
afford toothpaste and still have enough money left over
for the haircut I'm still holding out in hope of getting.
So I go over to the candy section to try to spend my
two dollars. As I turn to the cashier, there on the
counter is nothing other than a pack of Topps baseball
cards for 99 cents. Topps was always my favorite brand.
I pick one up and grab a strawberry-flavored Charles-

ton Chew.
As I'm walking out the door with my pack of cards
and my Charleston Chew, a feeling ofexcitementwashes
over me. It is a feeling I haven't had in a long time.
There's nothing like the excitement that comes from an
unopened pack ofbaseball cards. Lots of my childhood
memories are closely tied to the excitement of an unopened pack of baseball cards.
I think of my cousin Willie, and Lake Chelan, and
walking up to "The Store" to buy a few packs on a hot
summer day with our shirts off and tucked into the back

of our shorts.
I think of the redheaded kid who lived across the
street from me, Ross McMeekin, who I loved to trade
with 'cause he'd give up anything for Mark McGwire
cards. We'd sit on the grass and line out our cards, the
best in sheets of plastic in notebooks, the rest in stacks,
and trade for heroes. Mark McGwire and Roger Clemens
for Barry Bonds and Jack McDowell.
As I walk back up to Parrish, I look at the cards I got
this time.The first is Albert Belle, which kinda makes
me sad, because he was a helluva player and it sucks to
lose your career to injury when you're still near the top
of your game. The pack is a good one, though. I get two
of the best shortstops in the game, Barry Larkin and
Derek Jeter. I get Troy Glaus and Ben Grieve. I get Brad
Penny, the youngster on the Marlins, and Bobby Jones,
a Mets pitcher who's started the season on the DL. Four
all-stars in a pack of seven!
No, I didn't get a haircut. And I'll have to stealtoothpaste from my hallmates for a while.
But that's a small price to pay for capturing a special moment from my childhood and getting to feel like
a kid again, even if only for a little while.
And now that I get to listen to Mariners games every
night via the sweet voice ofDave Niehaus on the radio/
internet, life is beautiful. The great pastime is back
again, just in step with great spring weather.
Go play some catch with Dad.

Men's lacrosse loses heartbreaker
BY MIKE LLOYD

The men's lacrosse team traveled to Carlisle, Pa. last Saturday, hoping to continue the success of last year's 17-6 triumph over Centennial Conference foe Dickinson College.
Unfortunately, the Garnet (3-7) could not hold a 7-6 fourth-quarter lead against the Red Devils (3-5), and ultimately lost 10-7.
Co-captain Mark Dingfield 'Ol opened the scoring against
Dickinson, netting the only goal of the first quarter after beating his defender off a nice roll dodge. In the second quarter,
Dickinson countered by scoring four goals, to take a 4-3 halftime lead. The Garnet came out in the third quarter scoring
four goals with a strong offensive push, while the Swat defense only allowed two goals. At one point Swarthmore held a
7-5 lead over the Red Devils, but the third quarter would be
the end of the offensive output for Swarthmore. Dickinson

rattled offfour fourth-quarter goals and stopped the Garnet offense from getting quality shots to take the victory.
Dingfield finished the game with two goals and one assist. John Murphy 'O3 added two goals, and co-captain Blake
Atkins 'O2 helped the Swarthmore cause by scoring one
goal, picking up 13 ground balls and winning 11 of 15 faceoffs. Defenseman Charles Fischette 'Ol was named to the
Centennial Conference Weekly HonorRoll after picking up
six ground balls and causing three turnovers.
After Saturday's performance, Dingfield has moved into
eleventh place on the Centennial Conference's All Time
Scoring Leaders chart, with 174 points, and eighth place on
the Career Goal Leaders list, with 119 tallies. Dingfield
needs just nine points in the next three games to move into
a tie with former Washington College star JohnFuller (183)
