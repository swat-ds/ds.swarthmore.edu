Judge Stephanie Klein speaks to students about what she has learned as a judge of many alcohol-related cases.

BY JACQUELINE SMALL

jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Students generally do not see Judge
Stephanie Klein under pleasant cir-

cumstances, but on Monday night several students went to hear her speak
about alcohol and drug use among college students. DART hosted the event
in Science Center 199, in order to help
serve as a resource for Swatties to
learn about possible penalties for
drinking and using drugs. DART
intends on bringing several speakers
to discuss similar topics over the
course of the year.
Klein oversees the trials of people
from this court district who are arrested or given citations for violations
such as underage drinking, public
indecency and disturbing the peace.
She pointed out that public indecency
and disturbing the peace are just two
of many crimes which may occur as a
result of binge drinking, even if the
accused is of legal age, and warned
that violence and sexual assault may
also be consequences of intoxication.
The judge frequently referred to her
two daughters, who are pursuing
undergraduate and graduate degrees,
and said that they would want her to
tell Swarthmore students just to drink
responsibly.
"I can't tell you to drink responsibly because if you are under 21, drinking is against the law, so telling you
that would be violating my oath of
office," Klein said.
Klein expressed concern over
increasing rates of binge drinking and
related tragedies. "You kids, you
worry me something fierce," she said,
mentioning several statistics. She told
the audience that 1,825 college students

died last year from alcohol related
incidents, including drunk driving.
"I'm asking you to think about the consequences of your actions," she said.
She said that she believes binge
drinking has become much worse over
the course of the last generation. She
said that during her own college years,
drinking was legal for her and her
classmates, but "[she has] no recollection of classmates being senseless or
passed out from alcohol."
Klein told students she had no idea
about what caused the change in the
drinking culture, but said it might be
related to the increased pressure on
students, due to the economy and
changing nature of the workforce. She
said that while it is important to "blow
off steam," being safe and making good
decisions is more important.
About 30 people attended the question and answer session, which Tom
Elverson '75, alcohol education and
intervention specialist, said was somewhat disappointing. I
had hoped
for 50 [students to attend], but there
was a fireside chat about Strategic
Planning at the same time
I was
very impressed that DU's entire pledge
class came, though, and there were
also members of Phi Psi there."
Isaac Epstein 'l4, a DU pledge, said
in an e-mail that it was '"strongly recommended'" that pledges attend the
talk, and noted that several members
of the fraternity are DART members as
well. Epstein, though, did not attend
the lecture because he had a class at
the time.
Elverson, who oversees the DART
Team since Kelly Wilcox left for NYU
Abu Dhabi, said that this year, they
plan to bring speakers from "all over

world." Upcoming lecturers include a
drug and alcohol counselor at the
University of Pennsylvania, a detective who deals with alcohol and drug
related crime, a social worker and a
chief of police. "I think it's good to
bring people from all sides to campus,"
Elverson said.
Elverson knows many of these
potential speakers through his contacts as the interventionist and counselor here. "I've really wanted the
DART Team members to be leaders in
and of themselves and they really
have, Claire Almand ['ll] and Phoebe
Hansen ['l2] especially are doing a
great job, but what I do help them with
is getting speakers."
Elverson said he enjoyed the talk
and thought it was well done. "My personal goal was that it be informative,
educational, and a different perspective, and all those things were met. It
was a beginning,, and we could
absolutely enhance it in the future, but
I thought it went well."
Almand, a coordinator of DART,
said in an e-mail, "Judge Klein's lecture had a lot of great information in
it, and we learned a lot about how the
legal system works. Unfortunately,
[she used] the law as a scare tactic to
prevent underage drinking. This, in
my opinion, is not an effective way to
help Swarthmore students make intelligent decisions about alcohol. But
Judge Klein did give students good
advice when she said to think [for]
more than a few seconds about choices
they make."
The lecture was scheduled for
shortly before Halloween, because historically, Halloween parties have the
largest numbers of students hospitalized or cited for drinking.

Chopp compared Swarthmore's
Quaker traditions to other communities around the world and their
morphing traditions.
"Even though sometimes the

NEWS IN BRIEF

Five cars broken into in the Ville
and on campus, valuables gone
On the morning of
October 21, between six and
seven thirty, five cars on
and near campus were broken into, and several items
that were inside the vehicles were stolen.
Three of the cars were in
Bond parking lot, one was
located in Cunningham lot,
which is near the arboretum's office, and one vehicle
was located near the business district in the borough
of Swarthmore.
Three of the cars belong
to Swarthmore students,
one belongs to a Public
Safety staff member, and the
one in the Ville belongs to a
borough resident.
Expensive coats, a calculator, books, a shoulder bag
and a small amount of
money, totalling about three
dollars, were taken from the
cars. For the victims of the
crime, most of the cost will
be replacing their broken
windows.
Because there was no
attempt to start the cars,
Public Safety does not suspect that there was any
intention to steal the vehicles themselves.
Owen Redgrave, director
of Public Safety, said that
people should hide their
valuables. If they must be
left in cars, and close their

windows and lock their
doors.
There are no known witnesses, but in an announcement in the Reserved
Students Digest, Public
Safety urged anyone who
has information about the
crimes to come forward.
Redgrave,' however, is
not optimistic about successfully catching the thief.
"Very, very few people are
caught in these kinds of situations where we don't
have any witnesses," he
said.
Redgrave also said that
when cases like this are
solved, it is usually through
other means, such as catching the criminal in the act of
another crime, or someone
turning in the thief in order
to receive more lenient sentencing for his or her own
crimes.
Public Safety and the
local police are working on
the case together, and they
believe that one individual
or group is responsible for
the break-ins.
Redgrave said that this is
very out of the ordinary and
that usually there are five
or fewer events like this per
year, including in the summer.

Deer culls will reoccur during winter break
BY LAUREN KIM
lkiml@swarthmore.edu

The college, in its second consecutive process of deer
population management, will host a public archery hunt
and cull in the Cram Woods during the winter break.
The Pennsylvania Game Commission approved the cull
last winter. Factors influencing the decision were such
instances as the 2003 Natural Lands Conservation and
Stewardship Plan for the Trust and Continental
Conservation filing a report detailing the overabundance
of deer. A research-based monitoring program by Roger
Latham, former biology professor, will help inform the
needs for further population control measures in future
years.
"The monitoring program

will be long term and will
monitor the effects of deer population management on
indicators of forest ecosystem response. Indicators include
key plant and animal populations, plant functional groups,
native plant species diversity and forest vertical structure," said Jeff Jabco, co-chair of the Cram Woods stewardship committee and director of grounds and coordinator of horticulture at the Scott Arboretum.
The annual deer cull is to be a continued project. The
continually increasing number of deer in the Crum
Woods, along with increasing damage to plants, makes
deer population regulation necessary to maintain the balanced ecosystem.
"Given current conditions it is likely that the deer will
have to be culled continuously over the next several years
with some likely breaks along the way, depending on what
the monitoring tells us," said Maurice Eldridge '6l vice
president of college and community relations and executive assistant to the president, in an e-mail.
Ethan Bogdan 'l3, however, questioned the effectiveness of the culls and the humaneness of the practice.
"If there were ever a question of the "humaneness" of
hiring sharpshooters to "harvest" our campus deer, the

Hunters will be able to enter Crum Woods as a part of
the deer cull this winter.
fact that we are now inviting local bowhunters to fire on
the creatures recreationally should raise a definite alert,"
Bogdan said in an e-mail. "It's only around half the time
that these arrows actually kill their targets; the rest of the
deer must endure lasting wounds that are aggravated
every time a protruding shaft snags on some bush or
branch."
The CWSC looked into alternative options for maintaining the deer population. Some of the other possibilities
discussed included introducing natural predators, con-

trolled hunting and contraceptives, but each of these alternatives entailed health or safety concerns.
"It is commendable that the Crum Woods Stewardship
Committee has nominally taken the time to consider alternative options, but it has yet to take a serious look at the
valid science proving tnat immunocontraceptive vaccines
can significantly reduce deer populations in habitats not
unlike the Crum Woods," Bogdan said in an e-mail.
Bryon P. Shissler, president of Natural Resource
Consultants, said that neither the Food and Drug
Administration nor the Environmental Protection
Administration approved contraceptive techniques.
The CWSC also looked into implementing mitigation
techniques such as using fencing and repellent to narrow
down the deer's space.
However, it was decided in 2009 that the cull would be
the most effective method to maintain a balanced ecosystem, or an "effective localized tool for reducing deer populations," according to Shissler.
Licensed professional sharpshooters from preapproved
deer hunting sites will participate in this procedure.
There should be minimum traffic in the Crum Woods
during this time.
Regulators have taken care to ensure that participators
shoot only when they are standing on a relatively elevated
point compared to the target, and whenthere is a clearline
of vision.
Shooters will also be required to hunt from tree stands,
away from trails, and at least 50 yards from inhabited
buildings. The hunt will also be in the early morning and
later night hours.
"Safety is of the utmost concern and many precautions
will be taken to ensure a safe cull if the college's application is approved," Jabco said in an e-mail. "Human safety
is ensured by shooting only when there is a clear line of
vision and by using a backstop that is provided by the
shooter's relative elevation."

Students experimenting with dumpster diving
BY MARK PRICE

THETRIANGLE.ORG OCT. 22, 2010
CHARLOTTE, N.C. Dumpster diving is far from a fad with UNC

Charlotte students, but 20-year-old

Kaitlyn Tokay and her friends say it's

catching on.
self-described
community
A
activist, she began digging through
grocery store trash bins in May and
blogging on Facebook about the "perfectly good" food she found, cooked
and ate.
It was meant to be a month long
experiment, to expose society's continued wastefulness, even in a recession.
But five months later, Tokay is still
at it, only now she's part of a team.
And as for her blog, readership is at
1,600 and growing.
"It has been an eye-opening experience to see not only what we throw
away as a society, but how it can be
used, with some imagination," says
Tokay, a junior majoring in communication studies.
"I decided to make it a lifestyle
habit, and to perpetuate it. A lot of
friends were amazingly grossed when
I told them about it, but others say
they admire it."
Tokay and many other Dumpster
divers consider themselves freegans,
practicing a form of environmentalism based on minimal use of
resources. Rescued food, hand-medown clothes and found furniture are
all part of the lifestyle.
Volunteerism is big, too, and Tokay
does that by sharing her found food
with the homeless, sometimes working with a program that serves meals
on the streets of Charlotte.
Freegan or not, grocery stores
maintain that Dumpster diving is a
form of trespassing.
Food Lion, for example, not only
"strongly discourages" digging in
Dumpsters, but says it will "take
appropriate action as necessary to prevent this activity."
Grocery stores note that there are
compelling reasons food is deemed
unfit, including damage, exposure and
being past its "sell by" date. Some
store chains solve this dilemma by
donating whatever they can save. Last
year, Harris Teeter gave 539,000
pounds of food to Second Harvest Food
Bank, rather than see it go to waste,
store officials said.
Tokay and her peers realize they're
considered a nuisance, which is why
they only come out at night, between
midnight and 4 a.m. Most work in
teams, with one in the trash bin, handing out the loot to someone waiting on
the outside.
Tokay typically works with several
people, including Stephanie Braun, 23,
a social work major who is also president of the UNCC Earth Club. Braun
considers Dumpster diving a form of
recycling, and has been on outings
with as many as four people.
"We're college students, so we're
already up at midnight, at coffee shops
or doing our homework," says Braun.
"It's really like going on a scavenger
hunt, and it's exciting, because you
THE PHOENIX

never know what you'll find."
Or whom you'll meet.
Tokay once had the wits scared out
of her when she stumbled onto a
homeless man who was already in a
Dumpster, looking for a meal.
And another time, she and Braun
were diving and heard that dreaded
"beep, beep, beep" sound that garbage
trucks make when they're backing up

to something.

"I was terrified that I was about to
be dumped into a garbage truck,"
Tokay says. "Then, we realized that it
was someone who was going to dump
trash into the Dumpster."
Awkward, indeed.
"I didn't know what to do, so I got
out of the Dumpster holding a bunch
of bananas and offered the driver one.
They didn't know what to think."
Jacob Hanks, 22, is a recent UNCC
grad who is among Tokay's partners.
He's been at it longer, though, having
started last year after hearing about it
from a friend who had been Dumpster
diving in Portland, Ore..
There have been occasions when
he's gone with as many as seven people, creating a kind of party atmosphere. And at least once, he ran into
another team of students who were
complete strangers.
"They came up after we were
already there and joined in. We split
everything," says Hanks. He says he
gets most of his meals these days from
trash bins.
"There is an abundance of stuff.
We've had times where we found
enough food to fill up the entire
kitchen floor, including pastries, packaged cakes, shrink-wrapped barbecue
ribs and a lot of bread."
Among Hanks' observations is that
Dumpster divers tend to be more
active in the fall and winter, because
the colder weather is "natural refrigeration."
He says they also tend to eat better,
because they find fruits, vegetables
and meats that struggling college students can seldom afford. He and other
Dumpster divers contend that much of
this food was tossed out unnecessarily
due to health regulations.
The USDA concurs, noting the
country has no universally accepted
system for food dating. In fact, it says
on its website that many products
should still be safe after the sell-by
date, if handled properly and kept at
the recommended storage temperature
of 40 degrees or below.
Tokay says she's living proof, having never gotten sick from eating
items found in the trash. "Just
because a product says it's out of date
on June 2, or whatever, doesn't mean
it's gone bad exactly on June 2. A lot of
times, they're still good."
Tokay says she learned frugality
from her mom, Edna, who homeschooled all seven of her kids. "We
grew up eating discounted food from
various stores, and my mom grew a lot
of our vegetables."
Edna never Dumpster
dived,
though, and doesn't plan to. However,
she is not going to pass judgment on
her oldest child's new passion.

"That's a tricky question for a
mother," she says. "Kaitlyn is exuberant and high energy. She makes people
tired just talking to them. My only
advice to her is not to be alone, late at
night. I want her to be safe."
Kaitlyn acknowledges that she did
go out alone the first couple of weeks.
"The first time was really gross,"
she says. "It smells like rotten food
and jumping into a big metal container is scary: broken glass and all. A lot
of emotions were running through my
head, but I guess I was more excited
than scared."
Tokay says she now goes four times
a week, and has gotten used to the feeling of watermelon and cottage cheese
sliding down her pants legs, and rotten vegetables in her shoes.
She also has gotten used to a new
way of cooking that depends on what-

ever was found that week in a trash
bin.
Lately, she's been cooking a lot with
flax oil, after finding an entire case.
"One bottle was broken, so the store
just threw out the whole case."
Her refrigerator is brimming,
including 2 pounds of kosher beef, 8
ounces of organic pea shoots, and 5
pounds of strawberries that she's turning into smoothies using a blender
found in a trash bin.
"I have no idea what this is," she
says, holding a can with the label torn
off. "It will be a total surprise when we
open it."
To date, only one failure has resulted from these experiments.
"Fruit and rice," she says. "I cut up
apples and put in white rice. It didn't
taste horrible, but it wasn't my
favorite."

STUCO BRIEF

StuCo plans Sharpies initiatives
StuCo received suggestions from
students about using meal points in the
Ville, more diversity in bagged lunches
and more local foods. StuCo will look
into contacting the Vice President of
Finance, Suzanne Welsh, to find more
information on the possibility of using
meal points in the Ville.
They will also look into seeing if
Sharpies can be more transparent in
the content of their food and give percentages of the local and organic foods
served.
Phoenix access to student e-mails
Editor in Chief JeffDavidson 'l2 and
Managing Editor Amelia Possanza 'l2
visited StuCo asking for a re-vote on
the decision that refused the Phoenix's
request to send weekly digests to all the
students.
Davidson and Possanza noted that
the digest would spread news faster
and further and allow students to opt
out of the weekly e-mails. StuCo voted
to not recommend to Dean Liz Braun to
give the Phoenix e-mail access to all
students. They did vote to send out a
campus wide email promoting the
Phoenix's website.
Breakfast update
Sunday breakfast will begin at 10
a.m. as opposed to 11 a.m. next semester! Based on survey results, many people are interested in being student
workers at that time.
Bike Share
The Bike Share program has been
halted for the past month but will start
up again on Nov. L StuCo Vice
President Deivid Rojas 'l2 said that he
will try to bring someone in to repair
the bikes.
Television repairs
StuCo plans on following up with
contacts to get cable to televisions in
dorms as soon as they can.
Meeting with President Chopp

StuCo addressed a future meeting

October 28, 2010

with the Board of Managers in
December possibly with globalization
as its theme. A fireside chat with Chopp
will be held Monday at 7:30 p.m. in
Scheuer room.
Academic support, faculty and course
diversity meeting

The council will co-host the meeting
with the IC/BCC coalition and will
allow students to give feedback on what
factors of academic support needs to be
addressed. The meeting will take place
on Friday at 7 p.m. They hope to gain
more opinions from students to present
to the deans at an upcoming meeting.
Bathroom update
StuCo will post bi-monthly updates
about their agenda in bathroom stalls.
They will outline short-term and longterm goals of the council to continue
their transparency to the student body.
Halloween study break with Dean
Braun
Dean Liz Braun is hosting a
Halloween-themed study break at her
home on Friday from 3-6 p.m.. The
Swarthmore Mariachi Band and a
capella groups will perform. Various
treats will also be served.
Alumni Council
Alumni council members will hold
an event in Sharpies to talk to students.
Suggestions for the topic of conversation may be geared towards StuCo's
current goals and their own experiences at Swarthmore to enter conversation on academic support and course
diversity.

Haverford forum for Swarthmore
Haverford has offered to create an
online forum for Swarthmore. It would
be a place for the student body to participate in discussion boards. Members
of StuCo will find out more information
about the forum and form an opinion
before any decision is made.

Experiencing culture shock in Parisian paradise
"Paris is overrated!"
screamed the T-shirt slogan
splayed across the chest of
a hip Paris denizen who
had just walked past me in
the street. My first month
the honeymoon
in Paris
period
was decidedly
over.
Paris is perpetually
stereotyped as a pictureperfect study abroad destination. Set against a cineMaki Somosot
matic backdrop of cenSmall But Classe
turies-old architecture and
culture, the stereotype of
Paris is no less than that of
a paradise, with all its lights, cafes and roaming lovers. In
pop culture, the city exists as the ultimate urban symbol
of sophistication and cosmopolitanism, a global fashion
and gastronomic capital always on the cutting edge.
Endless hordes of tourists arrive every year in order to
actualize the Paris of their dreams and imagination.
For Francophiles like me, there seemed to be nowhere
else better in France than Paris to spend my semester
abroad. It was the pinnacle of French culture, wherein the
majority of intellectual life and artistic output was concentrated. Committed to my perfect Parisian dream, I was
willing to swallow even the deadliest of inconveniences
just for the sake of living it up in the City of Lights.
Upon my arrival, I was immediately enchanted by
Paris for all the stereotypical reasons. I embraced the cafe
culture, the buzzing nightlife and all the new cultural discoveries that presented themselves for the taking. The
fashion and food was impossible not to catch on to: I
increasingly wore neutral colors in accordance with the
Parisian color palette, on top of consuming croissants and
baguettes with real coffee everyday. People-watching
while strolling along the banks of the Seine quickly
became one of my new favorite activities. Because I considered myself a Francophile, more or less familiar with
French culture, I scoffed at the possibility of serious culture shock ever interfering with my experience.
As my first month in Paris ambled on, the steady avalanche of inconveniences and grievances forced me to
reconsider my glorified first impression. Case in point:
the less-than-ideal living situation. The first hurdle for a
student living on a budget in Paris is the sometimes dubious nature of lodging.
Touted as the world's most expensive city for real
estate, 500 Euros per month in Paris pays for a room in a

French foyer, a hostel for students and "young profession-

als." The description made me anticipate wireless
Internet access, a private bathroom and at the very least
hangers in the closet.
There was none of the above to be found in the unfurnished room wherein I was supposed to reside for four
months in the glamorous French capital. My foyer was
apparently at the bottommost echelon of the cheap housing hierarchy in Paris. In other foyers, residents could
access the Internet and use the toilet in the comfort and
privacy of their own room.
Instead, a sorry little sink in the corner of my room
stood for the semblance of a bathroom. The actual public bathroom and shower itself is little
more than a single industrial, windowless cell
shared by both genders. Once when the shower
light had stopped working, maintenance's homeopathic remedy consisted of wrenching out the
bathroom light to replace the one in the shower, judging from the wires hanging from the
ceiling.

In our foyer, Internet access is only available in the common room and its functionality
is completely unpredictable. Otherwise two
PCs of similar Internet capacity are available,
which also carry sluggish operating systems
derived from a bygone era. There is a single mouse
shared between these two technological relics. These
days, the mouse has vanished into thin air, just like
our last hopes for contact with the rest
the world through the Internet.
Our foyer also has a magnetic tendency to attract the presence of various broken objects outside the
entrance every other week. The first
time was a broken television set, followed by a dismantled computer
hard drive and then a smashed mirror.
An ever-observant friend noted the positive correlation between the passage of time and the degree of
destruction incurred by each respective object. "It's a
form of catharsis," he commented. "I can imagine sexually frustrated Frenchmen passing by and launching them-

selves at [insert-object-of-the-week-here] every day."
Apart from the usual housing woes, the dirtiness of
Paris never ceases to amaze in its full grimy grandeur. It
sends me reeling how much animal excretion, litter and

used cigarette butts have flooded all the otherwise pleasant streets in this city. Concessions have inevitably been
made for its status as a big city, but having visited my fair

share of cities all over the world, the sheer density of dog
litter here is so far beyond compare. A rule for survival in
Parisian streets is to watch the ground like a hawk, a preventive measure against taking any embarrassing steps
in the wrong direction. So far, I have luckily managed to
avoid this mishap by developing a strategy of smooth sidestepping and swerving while going about my daily business.
In terms of spatial dimensions, Paris seems to be a relatively miniature city, at least smaller -than other global
capitals. Natives swear to have walked from the farthest
point of the west to the east end of the city in no more than
three hours. With a population of over 9 million
(and growing), Paris's land area is approximately
2700 square kilometers, yet has a density of 3550
people per square kilometer. The city feels disproportionately over-populated based on its
size, lending it an air of mild claustrophobia that I can never quite shake.
Paris also lures impressionable
ingenues looking for le fun with a neverending and debilitating schedule of con-

certs, parties, raves, gallery openings,
exhibitions and plays. While initially I
2. had been energized by the countless
nightlife choices at my disposal, soon I
could no longer keep track of all the bons
plans for the weekend and couldn't figure
out how I could possibly pencil them all
into my planner, much less finance most
n
of them. Overwhelmed by too many possibilities and missed opportunities, going
out with friends had become both a chore
and an obligation in Paris, which only
worsened my cultural impasse further.
■hbJ Living in Paris is not the same as visiting it. Just like every veteran of culture
shock, I have had to reconcile these quotidian disappointments with the city's more stereotypical enchantments.
There are occasional culture shocks that grate on my
nerves, but no longer as electrifying as before. Sitting outside a cafe while grumbling to a friend one day, I arrived
at the realization that all the best
and the worst
stereotypes of Paris are true to some extent. There we
were, enjoying our espresso shots and croissants while
serenely watching passersby, with the sun warming our
faces but with endless complaints about Paris clouding
our minds. The beauty of Paris could never be more para-

Life and death converge in Eastwood's 'Hereafter'
BY ISAAC HAN
ihanl@swarthmore.edu
Even as we live, we think about our
deaths. Perhaps it is because death is the
inevitable conclusion of our days. Or
maybe death compels us by its mystery
because, in taking those around us, we are
left in a state of emptiness that we seek to
refill. This very theme of death and what
happens
in the afterlife is what
"Hereafter," the most recent movie by
Clint Eastwood that is generating Oscar
buzz as the awards season slowly creeps
toward the center stage, examines.
The movie follows three characters
haunted by the grasp that death and the
afterlife have on our present world. The
first story is about a Parisian news
reporter, Marie Lelay (Cecile de France),
who during a vacation on a tropical island,
gets swept up by the sudden tidal waves of
a tsunami and has a near-death experience
in which she experiences the place of the
"hereafter," the place where you go when
you die. After the incident, she becomes

death, the film suffers from too many
forced circumstances that lack the subtlety that would enhance the emotional
impact of such a movie. For example,
Jason tracks down George after the death
of his brother, but in a way that lacks credibility; Jason, without clear emotional
motives or enticement, is compelled to
explore the world of clairvoyants through
random Google and Youtube searches.
These searches introduce him to George,
but this turn of events just seems too circumstantial and therefore less genuine.
Such instances that lack clarity or seem
random are interspersed throughout the
film. As a result, the film is less effective
than Eastwood's other films.
Nevertheless, Eastwood directs a powerful film about death and the importance
of moving past it for the sake of living a
full life. In spite of situational errors, the
movie adequately captures the very
morose, sentimental quality experienced
by personal loss. The movie still succeeds
in being a manifestationof that age-old lesson that even in the face of death, life must
go on.

Alleviating the awkward encounters at doorways
swarthmorephoenix.com

Ariel Swyer
Let's Be
Serious

§

I

There is a lot of politeness at Swarthmore; politeness floats through the air
around campus, mixing on
occasion with the delicate
whiffs of intellect and congealing
into
rabbits.
Rabbits, however, are not
what today's column is
about. Rabbits are quiet,
keep to themselves, and on
the whole present very little trouble of any kind.
They're really not at all
worth talking about and
ought to be immediately
dropped from this discussion. I've already forgotten
why anyone brought them

in the first place. Today's column will henceforth be
completely free of rabbits and retain a clear focus on its
mission to coherently, logically and in a refreshingly
straightforward manner comment upon a very serious
problem that affects the school at large.
The problem is one of doorways. Swarthmore students
have an extremely difficult time with them. This, of
course, has nothing to do with the widely propagated
myth that we at Swarthmore are in the habit of being
awkward.' We at Swarthmore are ridiculously functional,
normal people; it just happens that, as was mentioned
once, we are also very polite. This quality often manifests
itself in an almost fanatic tendency to hold doors open for
one another. This leads to a variety of complications, parup

ticularly when two people arrive at the same time. Here
there is, inevitably, uncertainty about who will be allowed
to hold the door open for whom. The process begins with
both players standing two feet away from the door and
staring at it uncomfortably. This is followed by a short
period of staring at each other uncomfortably; and then
back at the door uncomfortably at which point there will
be an exchange of "oh," "er," "urn", "hmm," etc.
Eventually someone will dive forward assertively and
open the door, creating a fork at which it must be decided
whether the door-opener or door open-ee will enter first. If
the door opener allows the other person to go through
first, that person has to apologize, and then sometimes the
door holder apologizes vaguely in reply, and then they
both apologize to the door and thank various unassociated people on the other side.

And then of course there is the situation in which one
person arrives at a door and must decide whether the per-

son behind them is close enough that the door ought to be
held open for the second person to catch. If the second person is too far away and the first person holds the door,
then the second person has to walk more quickly which
causes the first person to apologize, fdrcing the second
person to provide simultaneously gratitude, reassurance
and sheepishness. When more than two people meet at a
doorway, there's no hope. In those cases someone has to
take the mature approach and simply climb through a
window.
This situation is clearly due in part to our excessive
politeness, but even more so to there being something
strange about the magnetic fields around our doorways.
This is a definitive and rational conclusion, which I have
just made up. Regardless of the causes, however, things

are in a desperate state and the doorway issue must be
addressed. A bit of thought will render it apparent that
there is only one sensible solution: the immediate installation of traffic lights in every entryway.
In this same spirit of making life less vague and more
maneuverable, perhaps there could be arranged a general
increase in signage around campus. It is an oft commented upon fact that the trees are labeled and the buildings
are not, and we could certainly begin by moving all the
labels on the trees to the buildings so that people would
often make comments such as, "I'll meet you in
Chamecpris Pisifera (False cypress) 107." This would
undoubtedly serve to simplify things substantially.
However it would only be a start. There could further
be instated a system of arrows telling baffled Swarthmore
students exactly which direction they should walk to find
the solution to a variety of problems. Can't, decide your
major? An arrow would point you to first floor of
Crataegus Veridis (Green Hawthorn). Need a working
printer? Magnolia Grandiflora (Southern Magnolia) is
fairly reliable. General existential collapse? Go to Acer
Palmatum (Japanese Maple).
As an extra convenience, people could be labeled with
their name, dorm and a list of places in which passersby
might potentially have met them. (Joe: Wharton
French class, mariachi band, fencing, knitting club,
young polka aficionados, tennis.)
All of these proposed changes would make life monumentally less complex and I move to set up a committee
for this purpose without delay. First meeting to be held at
the top of Quercus Bicolor (Swamp White Oak).

Media and Philadelphia. The Players Club
has featured seven main stage productions
and additional avant-garde productions,
but for their 100 th season, the Club
debuted their rendition of Mel Brooks'
hilarious and famous musical, "The

with dreams of Broadway. After absentmindedly devising a theory that an unsuccessful play could make more money than
a hit one, Bialystock and Bloom embark
on a hilarious adventure to create the
worst play ever written. In their attempts
to write a bad play and find the absolute
worst directors and actors, the duo ends
up with a beautiful Swedish actress looking for fame, a Neo-Nazi with an obsession
with his pet birds, an outrageously flamboyant director and his children and a
Broadway hit "Springtime for Hitler."
Players Club director Darrin Peters'
version of "The Producers" was comedic,
light-hearted yet touching, and riotous.
Watching the play with no concept of the
storyline, I thought the character parts
were overdone and exaggerated. But as the
play continued, I realized that the comedy
stemmed from the character's overly exaggerated, quirky traits.
Pianist and conductor Richard Lewis
did an excellent job in keeping the music
together and matching it with the musical.
Considering the size of the orchestra and
the availability of instrumentalists, the
music was well played and synchronized.

"I really enjoy playing the music with
everyone. It's also extremely entertaining

to be watching the musical happen alongside the music," Joanne Cheng, a trumpet
player, said. Most of the orchestra mem-

bers are volunteers and their rehearsals
began only two weeks before the plays
debut on Friday, Oct. 22.
Wills' characterization of Bialystock
was spot-on and what he lacked in technical singing ability, he made up for with
enthusiasm and energy. Sheehan had a terrific voice and great versatility on stage as
is demanded by a character such as
Bloom.
"I have played this part before, but the
second time around with Peters is better
and more explosive," Sheehan said.
"Everything lined up perfectly as well; the
connection between David's part and my
part have meshed, not to say the least for
our relationship as friends." Sheehan has
been involved with music since his junior
year of high school. For both Wills and
Sheehan, it is their second time playing
their respective roles.
The beautiful Ulla, played by Carie
Sharre, also had an excellent voice, which
was masked early on in the play by how
well she interpreted and portrayed the
innocence of the. naive woman from
Sweden. The connection made between
Ulla and Leo Bloom played a large part in
the comedy of the entire play.
Roger Deßris, played by Sean Murray,
was a hit on stage both as his character
and as Hitler in Bialystock and Bloom's
production of "Springtime for Hitler."
One of the greatest moments of the play
was when Deßris and the rest ofhis boys,
other ensemble members, came down and
samba'ed around the whole auditorium.
It was an engaging way to interact with
the entire audience and throw in more

Overall, I applaud the work and effort
put into the musical resulting in a phenomenal production. Despite its long history, the Players Club of Swarthmore is a
small community theater and "The
Producers" is a broadway hit. Given that
it's difficult to perform a famous musical,
Darrin Peters did an excellent job.

Exploring language through Russian science fiction
BY SERA JEONG
sjeongl@swarthmore.edu
Russian Science Fiction is an atypical literary genre that is not generally
seen on the New York Times Bestseller
list. However, contemporary Russian literature is garnering much attention and
has become a main part of distinguished
translator Marian Schwartz's work.
On Monday, Oct. 25, Schwartz read
from her translation of "2017," a science
fiction novel by Olga Slavnikova. The
Russian Section of the Department of
Modern Languages sponsored the event.
Schwartz studied Russian at Harvard
and Middlebury College's Russian
School. "Russian literature got its hooks
in me at a very early stage," Schwartz
said and while she gained fluency after
three or four years, she is adamant that
she is "not bilingual".
Schwartz began the event by reading
two passages from "2017." The first passage was partially read in Russian,
which allowed listeners to hear
Schwartz's proficiency in the language.
Throughout the evening, she gave information on the details of literary translation of Russian writing.
"2017" is a literary science fiction
novel set in a dystopian future. Writer
and critic Slavnikova won the Russian
Booker Prize for her novel in 2006. The

novel is set a century after the 1917
Russian Revolution and the plot follows
a gem cutter, Krylov. "2017" is one of
Schwartz's most recent translations, but
she describes the contemporary novel as
"densely plotted, densely written" and
"puzzling."

These aspects of "2017" are some of
the reasons why Schwartz had a challenging time translating the novel.
Schwartz cited problems she faced with
2017, such as Slavnikova's use of condensed grammatical forms of Russian

language.
A single word in Russian may have
to be replaced with a whole clause in
English. The opposite can also be true.
Schwartz explained English has specific
words due to its Latinate, Germanic and
Anglo-Saxon origins. She gave an example of a phrase literally taken from
Russian, "eye looking as if [it had been]
paralyzed." A more logical English
translation would be "glazed eye."
However, the greatest issue lies in being
able to know and recall these specific

words.
But Russian is an intrinsically difficult language to translate into English.

While Russian is highly inflected,
English is not.
"English depends on proximity to
hold concepts together...[in Russian]
you know if there was a feminine noun

[previously]

and there hasn't been
another feminine noun since, and then
it says "she" that's the [noun] itrefers to.
But in English we don't have that, it
requires
much more proximity,"
Schwartz said.
Schwartz's explanations on linguistics gave attendees greater understanding about the process of translation. "As
a linguistics major, I found the ideas
about Russian and its differences to
English really fascinating," Benjamin

Schwartz 'l3 said.
Structural
differences between
Russian and English novels are another
challenge translators face. Schwartz
observed that Russian and English "aesthetics are diametrically opposed."
While Russian has the aesthetic of
excess and high drama, English has the
aesthetic of understatement. Hence,
Schwartz advocates that Russian novelists trim their writing of description for
the purposes of English translation.
Schwartz herself did not translate 2017
from the original Russian version, but
from an edition Slavnikova cut down by
15% for the Western sensibility.
Schwartz felt that the English translated version of "2017" "improved it
tremendously...l liked the book before
and I love the book now." She also feels
these modifications are necessary for
translations to stand independently,

rather than shadow the original text.
Her approach is trying to recreate, not
literally translate, the original text.
Sound and other aesthetic qualities
must be emulated. "If it is funny in
Russian, it should be funny in English,"
Schwartz said about maintaining similar emotions and qualities in her translations. "If you think the narrator is
smart in Russian, they should be smart
in English."
Despite the difficulties, translated
texts appear to be important in shaping
the English language with "new words,
new structures, new approaches" said

Schwartz. Host Professor
Sibelan
Forrester said it was pragmatic to invite
Texas-based Schwartz to Swarthmore as
the translator was in Philadelphia for
the American Literary Translator
Association Conference. Forrester also
intended to stimulate interest in a
course, "Russian and Eastern European
Science Fiction in Translation," to be
offered in the spring.
While some Swarthmore students
have had an introduction to Russian literature through reading works by
Fyodor Dostoyevsky, many have not
dabbled in contemporary Russian novels. "We don't know that much about
contemporary Russian literature...here
was a chance to look at something really
contemporary," Forrester said.

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Tayler Tucker
Year: 2013
From: Phoenix, AZ
Current Residence: Dana
What She's Wearing:
"I'm wearing an Urban Outfitters top, my jeans are
from the Gap, and both my shoes and my belt are vintage," Tucker said. Tucker's belt is actually her mother's that she "stole" and her lavender knitted scarf and
green peacoat are from Gap. "The shoes are vintage
Cole Haan that I got off Etsy," she said.
Tucker's style is impeccably polished with a vintage
edge, and this outfit is the perfect example. From her
classic peacoat with its vibrant green, hue to the
leather loafers, lavender scarf and polka-dot blouse,
Tucker plays with color and proportion well.
How She Describes Her Personal Style:
"I would describe my personal style as pretty simple, pretty comfortable and a lot about lines," Tucker
said. She's less interested- in how patterns mesh or
flashiness, as she puts it, but rather focuses on the
"overall fit and line" of the clothes she buys. "I look for
quality materials," she said. "I'm actually allergic to
100% polyester."
Tucker also looks for investment pieces. "I look for
things that I think will build my wardrobe after college," she said. "Definitely now I'm starting to think
about that and the fact that I'm going to be so poor
when I leave here."

Fashion Influences / Inspiration:

"I just kind of see people around campus and pick
up on different things that are great," Tucker said of
her affinity for "street" style or fashion. While there
isn't a celebrity or anyone who she tries to mimic in
his or her style, she does find her dad as a source of
inspiration
a common thread in recent Style
Snapshots. "[My dad's] definitely become much more
preppy with his style, so I definitely sort of look to
him for [inspiration]," Tucker said.
...

THE PHOENIX

Though Tucker doesn't follow ■
designers now, she used to enjoy
checking out designers like
Chloe, Burberry and Helmut
Lang. She also occasionally

browses The Sartorialist.
Where She Shops:
Tucker mainly shops at Zara,
Gap and Urban Outfitters. If she
does dabble in some online shopping, she visits Etsy, the website that
sells mainly handmade or vintage
items that include clothing, accessories and arts and crafts. Tucker
loves finding vintage items on Etsy, as
she hasn't found many good vintage
stores in Center City, Philadelphia, but
she also loves the handmade clothes
and accessories people sell on the website. "I have a lot of handmade scarves
because one of my friends sells [them]
on Etsy," she said.
Favorite Items in Her Closet:
"I would say my black wool sweater ■
[and] my black trench coat are my
favorite items," Tucker said. "They're just
perfectly modern, nice lines, nice fit and
perfectly utilitarian." Fall is in full swing,
and the perfect item for this season is the
trench coat. Whether it's khaki or black
like Tucker's, it's become a quintessential
item for cooler weather. Besides the trench
coat, Tucker also recommends that her
wardrobe staples include "a good pair ofdark
wash blue jeans and a good pair of brown
leather shoes."
Never Leaves the House Without:
"I never leave the house without my phone and
blue pen," Tucker said. "I always have a pen on me."

well as 8.5 acres of corn to lose yourself in. To the
north, The Bates Motel at Arasapha Farms in Glen
Mills (1835 Middletown Rd.) offers a haunted house, a
corn maze and hayrides.
Other upcoming events of note, on theme or not,
include Michelangelo Pistoletto's restaging of his

original staging of this modern art installment,
Pistoletto unfurled a giant ball of newspaper through
the streets of Turin, Italy. If you are near the

the event is free and open to the public, and begins at
1 p.m. If you will be driving near the Philadelphia
Museum of Art on Saturday, you may want to check
the museum's website to avoid unexpected detours.
Also inhabiting the performance art realm (though
in a more typical Halloween way) are The Martha
Graham Cracker Cabaret Halloween Extravaganza on
Saturday, Oct. 30 from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. at Marßar (40th
and Walnut) and BRAT Productions' production of
"Carrie" at Underground Arts at the Wolf Building
(340 North 12th Street, entrance on Callowhill), which
runs until Nov. 7. Tickets for "Carrie" are available
through bratproductions.org or at the door, and ticket
prices vary depending on the show. Only individuals
21 years and older will be admitted to Martha Graham
Cracker's cabaret; tickets are available online at
brownpapertickets.com and cost between $l2-20.
In the world of gastronomy, next Tuesday, Nov. 2,
upscale Philadelphia Mexican restaurant Xochitl (408
S. 2nd St.) will offer a five-course Day of the Dead
menu with a "Heart and Soul" theme. The main
course is beef heart tacos. The fixed-price menu costs
$45; reservations are recommended and available
through OpenTable.com. (This particular meal is not
recommended for vegetarians.) On the same day, in
University City, Jose Garces' Distrito (3945 Chestnut
St.) will be having its own Dia de los Muertos celebration, offering DJ-ed music, face painting, and
street food-style snacks from 2:30 p.m. until dinner,
when a special tequila dinner will also be available.
Also celebrating more in the style of El Dia de los
Muertos are the Mutter Museum and Philadelphia's
Mexican Cultural Center. The former will be serving
traditional fare and offering sugar skulls for decoration, in addition to providing an artist's talk and
other entertainment. The museum is located at 19 S.
22nd Street, between Market and Chestnut Streets.
The latter will be displaying an altar in the Bourse
Building (111 S. Independence Mall East
the location of the Ritz at Bourse Cinema where the Philly
Shuttle stops) from Friday the 29 through Nov. 10,
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. This year, the altar is the
product of four prominent local artists; drop by if
you're in Old City.
The main Halloween event every year in
Philadelphia
undeniably
is
Eastern
State
Penitentiary's haunted prison tour, "Terror Behind
the Walls." Opened in 1829 by the Quakers, the
Eastern State Penitentiary became a model for 19th
century prisons around the country, and even garnered a visit from French political philosopher Alexis
de Tocqueville. As its title suggests, the penitentiary
was designed with the goal of reforming criminals,
instead of merely punishing them with incarceration.
Unfortunately, the prison model's heavily stressed
technique of solitary confinement drove more than a

12

few prisoners mad. The penitentiary was finally
closed in 1970, and reopened in 1994 as a museum.
Decay not threatening, the structure has been left to
time and the elements, creating a haunted house setting that's hard to beat.
To get to the Eastern State Penitentiary (2124
Fairmount Ave.) via SEPTA, take the Media-Elwyn
train to Suburban Station. From there, you can walk
the mile up to Eastern State by turning north/right on
20th or 21st Streets, or, pick up the 33 Bus (the direction should say "Venango Loop") at JFK Boulevard
and 17th Street, get off at 20th and Fairmount, and
walk one block west to 21st Street. Keep in mind that,
while the event is open from 7 p.m. until midnight on
Saturdays, the last train back to Swarthmore leaves
Suburban Station at 11:10 p.m. on Saturdays. If you
find yourself with no car and no train to bring you
back to Swat, your best public option is to pick up the
48 Bus at 23rd and Fairmount heading in the Front
Street & Market Street direction, get off at Market &
15th, and take the Market-Frankford Line from 15th
Street Station to 69th Street Terminal. At the terminal, transfer to the 109 Bus, which will bring you back
to campus; If you do find yourself at 69th Street
Terminal late at night, be prudent. If you drive, know
that parking at the prison is tight; Park & Ride information can be found on the museum's event website,
Halloween.easternstate.org. Tickets cost $2O-$3O and
should be purchased ahead of time on the website.

last student nights of this year's season. Admitted
wimps of all ages should consider themselves forewarned. Little known fact: Because the Eastern State
Pen is a 501(c)(3) organization, you can write off half
of the price of your ticket on your income taxes.

Turn to journalism, not skewed news, for information
At first, it may not seem a likely
occasion: Two men famous for making
fun of politicians along the campaign
trail are the very ones holding rallies
in Washington D.C. this weekend. But
that is precisely the point for Jon
Stewart and Stephen Colbert, hosts of
"The Daily Show" and "The Colbert
Report."
This Saturday at the National Mall,

Stewart will hold "The Rally to
Restore Sanity"
playing off conservative pundit Glenn Beck's recent
"Rally for America"
"countered" by
Colbert's "The March to Keep Fear
Alive." Already, the rallies have created a national and international buzz.
About 150,000 people are expected to
show up to the actual event, while
other places in the country will have
satellite viewings; internationally, in
fact, over 800 places in 67 countries are
planning to screen the event.
Ostensibly,

as much as network news anchors and
reporters, according to The Pew
Research Center for the People & the
Press.
In a similar vein, newspapers have
drastically lost profits and circulation
in recent years, most precipitously
since the recession, just as the blogosphere and Internet have exploded. At a
point with over 500 million Facebook
users, roughly 50 million tweets per
day, and an ever-increasing growth of
blogs, it's clear people want information immediately. People are turning
to skewed blogs of "citizen journalists"
instead of informed political analysis;
140-character tweets over 800-word
articles; Facebook posts rather than
in-depth investigative pieces; one
rumor instead of three reputable
sources.

In turn, watching "The O'Reilly

crystallize conservative tendencies.
This reinforcement of polarization
can be found, too, in the skewed, often
inaccurate gathering of information
on blogs written by citizen journalists
without a code of ethics (who, of
course, could never write blogs if it
weren't traditional publications cover-

ing them).
Real journalism is meant to be a
watchdog on government power and
corporate corruption, a voice for the

silenced people, an objective presenter
of the facts that we as citizens should
know and need to know. A journalist's
strength is defined by not offering an
opinion because it forces him to clearly present to the public all facts, all
perspectives of a story.
This strength shouldn't be read as
weakness, just as loaded commentary
shouldn't be confused with journalism. Yes, it is a positive that news is
not dying. But we desperately need to
recognize that if future journalists fail
to remove personal opinions from
their reporting, there is little hope the
public will be able to distinguish fact
from fiction.

Parliamentary democracy offers better representation
swarthmorephoenix.com

With the midterm elections coming up next
week, now is a good time
to reflect on the role of the
presumed star of the elections, the Tea Party movement and how it compares
to extreme political movements and parties in
European countries.
In most European countries, extreme parties
exist and have much more

Social Thoughts
than the Tea Party does
and will in the US because
the Tea Party is not an
official party. Precisely because the Tea Party is not
an official party, in practice its appearance does not
offer voters with a broader choice of political views
but rather a more polarized one between strongly
conservative and "other views." In most European
countries, on the other hand, extreme political movements have the ability to officially become political
parties and therefore enrich the political spectrum
rather than diluting it, as in the United States.
Almost all European states
with the exceptions
of France, Switzerland and some of Europe's
microstates
use a parliamentary system of government rather than a presidential system that countries such as the United States and France use. Since
parliamentary systems tend to be more proportional
and less likely to feature winner-take-all elections
with the U.K. as an exception

the

tary systems in practice have a wider choice of parties and political views.
While the Tea Party is a relatively recent phenomenon in the United States, there have been similar
fringe movements in Denmark, Belgium and The
Netherlands since at least the beginning of the
decade
and they've had representation in parlia-

ment.

In Belgium the separationist New Flemish alliance
has a plurality in parliament. While the most
extreme party has been boycotted by most other parties, it nevertheless has seats in parliament and
therefore some political power. (Sadly, as a result of
these shifts of power Belgium has not succeeded in
creating a government since mid-June, leaving the
previous government in charge for the time being.)
The Danish and Dutch right-wing anti-immigration parties now "tolerate" the government, meaning
that they will support it on key issues and will not
vote in favor of early re-elections on issues where the
tolerating party and the ruling parties disagree. The
concerns of supporters of these extreme European
parties now dominate the political agenda.
Because of the parliamentary systems in most
European countries, fringe movements have been
able to register as formal political parties, whereas in
a presidential system such as in the United States
this is almost impossible to do. It's unlikely that an
official Tea Party would win enough of the winnertake-all races to get much representation in the
Senate, let alone win a presidential election in two
years' time.
Regardless of whether one disagrees that the concerns of the extreme parties in Denmark and The

recorded such a
one-sided ideology through the Opinion
Board's political endorsements.
Let's focus specifically on the
endorsement of Joe Sestak, the
Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in
Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, this wasn't so much a cheerleading for Sestak's
accomplishments as a smear of the
"other guy," Republican nominee Pat
Toomey.

and I strongly disagree
at least
the supporters of these parties have been able, in
practice, to vote for a party they identify with. In contrast, in the United States Tea Party voters risk being
heard but not officially represented.
The result of the differences between, roughly
speaking, presidential and parliamentary systems is
that in most of Europe extreme parties enrich the
political spectrum and allow voters to choose a party
that represents their views on a much broader set of
policy questions. In the United States, on the other
hand, the choice for some midterm elections is now
between a moderate Democrat and a strongly conservative Republican backed by the Tea Party.
It's important to emphasize that I do not endorse
or support any of the extreme parties that I have
mentioned; in fact, I consider many of their ideas
repulsive. Yet it is in the democratic interest of us all
that such movements exist and that voters have a
real choice between different political views, rather
than a forced choice between two parties of which
neither one comes close to representing one's vision
for the country's future.
In the end it remains painfully obvious that the
winner-takes-all system with its flaws is not going
anywhere. But when you vote on Tuesday, keep in
mind that if you lived in a country with a parliamentary democracy, chances are that the green
Republican or the anti-immigration Democrat in you
would be represented much more accurately than in
the polarized U.S. Congress.

can tap-dance around "Bush era trickledown-economics" in the hopes that the
ghost of Reagan will be enough to keep
some Swatties in ideological lockstep,
but is this wise given that half of
Americans see Obama as responsible for
the gasping economy?
If The Phoenix wishes to argue tax
cuts drove the train-wreck, it must substantiate such claims. Using George W.
Bush as a perpetual punching bag isn't
enough. Apparently voting for Toomey

is a bad idea because he would exacerbate a "fragmented Congress." But with
Democrats gripping a stronghold, who is
logically responsible for the fragmentation?
The last zinger is the accusation
Toomey is a "hard-right conservative."
Perhaps at Swarthmore "conservative"
is synonymous with "wrong," but what
about the recent Gallop poll in which 40
percent of respondents identify as conservative, compared to 20 percent who
identify as liberal?
Let's engage in facts and economics.
Such are the nuclei of a healthy debate.
Conservatives here are more than some
bizarre adaption of the Swarthmore
species, some evolutionary oversight.
Jin was right
it is fun to be a conservative at Swarthmore, mostly because
current Democrats are making the discussion much too elementary.

the Chargers from being a

So that's the angle I had going into the game against

game allowed) into third place. Sure, stats won't

all the better for the Jets—and some optimism. Like I
said, the story of the Chargers goes coast to coast; they
start slow every year, then rip off some massive winning streak that puts them in the driver's seat of their
terrible division. More than that, it seemed like the
stats and the record couldn't stay this far apart for
much longer—offense and defense are important,
right?
To say that the Chargers' offense made "mental
lapses" in the first half would be like saying that the
Gulf had a little oil in it. I'm not talking about the
usual blown assignment or drop by a receiver who
took his eye off the ball; they had plenty of those, too.
I'm talking about the sorts of things that you see every
three or four years, like the fake-to-third-then-throw16

to-first play in baseball that fools a base runner just
often enough for pitchers to keep trying them. In the
first half alone, there were two of the "It's been three
weeks, and this still pops up in my nightmares" variety. The first one occurred when the Chargers got the
ball back following a Patriots touchdown (scored following a Chargers fumble) and faced a 3rd-and-2 from
their own 28. Quarterback Philip Rivers play-faked,
then completed a pass over the middle of the field to
undrafted rookie Richard Goodman, who slid down
with the ball in New England territory, got up, and
tossed it to the ground in exuberance. There was just
one problem: nobody touched him. In college, going to
the ground with the ball means the play is over. In the
NFL, going to the ground untouched means that the
play is still going. Patriots safety James Sanders
immediately dove onto the ball and recovered it while
Rivers made the first of many passive-aggressive parent "I'm not angry, I just want you to know that what
you did was wrong" faces that would be featured
throughout the game.
The second one occurred on San Diego's next drive.
Rivers had brought the team to the New England 32.
On first down, he threw a screen pass to fullback Jacob
Hester near the right sideline, but the ball bounced off
of Hester's hands for an apparent incomplete pass.
There was just one problem: since Hester had been
behind Rivers when he attempted to make the catch,
the pass was considered a lateral and, when it hit the
ground, a fumble. For a split second, everybody stood
watching the ball until linebacker Rob Ninkovich dove
on the ball and remained on the ground for several seconds...without being touched. After realizing that San
Diego had completely lost interest in him, Ninkovich
stood up and began to run until he was finally pushed
out ofbounds at the San Diego 8-yard line. Head coach
Norv Turner then made one of many "You'd think I
would be pissed right now, but my face is made of wax"
expressions that he's featured during his career.
Yet Tom Brady, even with his team receiving gifts
from the Chargers like they were being courted for
marriage in the antebellum South, was unable to put
this game out reach by halftime, and New England
only led 13-3 with a total of 38 yards on offense. San
Diego's defense, the best in the NFL, was living up to
its reputation: they neutralized the run, got after
Brady, and bottled up the deep threats. So, for that
matter, was the offense, which had racked up about 170
yards in the first half (in keeping with the theme of
this game, both of San Diego's lines destroyed the
Patriots'). The paradox was starting to make sense.
When the second half started, the Patriots began to
find a rhythm, scoring ten points on consecutive
drives. This is how, with a little over 11 minutes
remaining, Philip Rivers was sacked at his own
28-yard-line to make it 2nd-and-15, and the Chargers,
who hadn't lost a game by more than one score all
year, found themselves in danger of suffering a
blowout that might make the San Diego fans sound
like they actually cared about what was going on in
the game. 23-6 Patriots.
Except that isn't how the paradox works; San Diego
does not get blown out. At 2-4, they're simply too good,
or maybe just good enough, to look like they came up
just a little bit short. If the East Coast Bias has kept
you from following the Chargers, consider what happened next to be the Cliffs Notes. Facing 3rd-and-15
from the 28, Rivers decided that now would be an
appropriate time to take control of the game. In eight
plays, he gave San Diego their first touchdown when
he found Antonio Gates in the end zone for his first
catch all day. When their onside kick attempt was
touched inches ahead of the necessary ten yards it
needed to travel, they scored again in about three minutes. Now it was 23-20 New England with about four
minutes left.
On fourth-and-inches, Bill Belichick elected to try
to pick up the yard, which would effectively win the
game, by running the ball over the left side. You might
remember that Belichick made a similar decision late
in a game against the Indianapolis Colts last year to
pass on fourth-and-two, a decision that backfired, cost
his team the gameand created a minor Armageddon in
the greater New England area. Leading up to that play,
the Patriots had already passed for 360 yards and were
facing a pass defense ranked 14th. On Sunday, the
Patriots had rushed for a little more than 50 yards and
October 28, 2010

were facing a run defense ranked 4th. Factor in that
the Chargers could more or less count on a run and
yeah. Loss of one. Chargers get the ball back with a
chance to win or tie. They don't get blown out.
So on 3rd-and-10, Rivers hits Antonio Gates for
eight yards, they call timeout with 28 seconds left, and
now the story is going to have a new ending. Kris
Brown comes out for a very makeable field goal, the

Luis Vasquez, a second-year guard who has started

Off the right crossbar. No Good. Game over.
"I don't think we gave ourselves a chance in this
football game," said Norv Turner, but that wasn't quite
right. His team had given itself every chance in the
world, with a few from the Patriots thrown in for good
measure, and had thrown them all away. With Turner,
it is always hard to tell whether a burning frustration,
an intolerant rage at the way his team is playing, lies
concealed or is simply nonexistent. San Diego
well
newspapers will once again call for him to show more
anger, to show some fight, and one bad columnist
might even suggest that he try to put a "charge" into
the Chargers.
He won't, of course, and maybe that will be okay;
there's no telling how few wins will be needed to win
the AFC West, and 10-6 still isn't out of the question, as
crazy as that might sound. With the Chargers, there
always seems to be just enough time.
Not that things didn't get a little easier to understand, once I had seen it for myself. The Chargers
gained twice as many yards as the Patriots, their
defense played mostly lights-out, and they brought it
down to the last play. On Monday morning, I checked
the updated rankings. First in Total Offense. First in
Total Defense. Record: 2-5. The paradox lives.

Garnet bounces back, to host Centennial tourney

describe as strong despite the result.

BY VICTOR BRADY

vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

Last year's 1-1 tie at McDaniel left a
bitter taste in the Garnet mouths. It was the
first time that McDaniel had earned a point
against Swarthmore since 2005 and the
game was played in heavy rainfall.
By the 78th minute, the field conditions
were unplayable and the game was called,
leaving the cold, wet and muddy
Swarthmore players to shower and make
the long trip back from Westminster.
On Saturday, in the men's soccer team's
Garnet Weekend match, Swarthmore dominated McDaniel from start to finish, blowing away the Green Terror by a final score
of 4-0.
Saturday's win was Swarthmore's first
victory with a No. 1 national ranking. The

rankings for the first time in program history last week the day before last
Wednesday's loss at Richard Stockton.
"We need to not get distracted by anything," David D'Annunzio 'l2 said. "I think
that we were very caught up in the rankings and how everyone else was doing
before we lost. Now that we've lost and
have that monkey off of our back, we can
just focus on the next game. At this point,
there is nothing
bigger than our
next game."
Coming off its

"Stockton had a rare combination of
size on set pieces and speed on the counterattack," said Contreras. "Given that we
dominated the whole game this meant that
we had to stay switched on at all times, we
just happened to fall asleep and we just didn't have the best luck. The loss to Richard
Stockton was actually some of the best
team ball we have played all year."
Wagner noted that despite the disappointment after the first loss of the season,
there was renewed commitment among the
players toward the big picture, the
Centennial Conference and the season as a
whole.
"The team realized that we have a job to
do and we are a good team, and now we
know that we can be exposed and can't take
anything for granted," Wagner said.
"Even the next day in training, the attitude was really, really positive and energetic and definitely recommitted to the season," Wagner added.

"People have been underestimating us a

to be the underdog. And that's been happening every series." Now they find
themselves in the World Series in a
