Vans will run to and from three pick-up points in Philadelphia, providing a ride home later into the night on
weekends than the last SEPTA train. Students can book a shuttle ride by signing up outside the Dean's Office.

Philly shuttle starts Friday
Vans will stop the Electric Factory, the Ritz at the Bourse and South Street
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@Swarthmore.edu

Weekends in Philadelphia are
now $7.50 cheaper for Swarthmore
students.
Starting on Friday night, a van
sponsored by Student Council and
Public Safety will serve as a free
shuttle for Swarthmore students
from the Rose Garden to three
stops throughout Center City
Philadelphia. The 10-passenger van
will operate on a set schedule with
the
last
van returning to
Swarthmore on Saturday night
more than two hours after the last
SEPTA train.
"The start of the van service
marks over a semester's worth of
work on the part of SC. I'm really
excited about this," SC co-president Ryan Budish 'O4 said. "I think
it's going to be great. We all know
how SEPTA stops running early,
and with vans running later than
the trains, people will be able to
stay in Philly later."
Budish has been working closely with Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave
and
Vice
President for Administration
Larry Schall '75 to develop the current system. "It will be great if the
students use it," Schall said.
"We've tried van services before,
and for one reason or another, it's
never really worked."
The vans will start running
Friday and Saturday evenings at

THE PHOENIX

6:15 p.m. Vans will drop off and
pick up students at the Electric
Factory at 6:45, the Ritz at the
Bourse at 7:00 p.m., and near South
Street at 7:15 p.m. Subsequent vans
will leave Swarthmore at 8:30 p.m.,
10:45 p.m., and 12:30 a.m. and the
schedule will follow a similar pattern. The last stops in Philadelphia
will be at 1:00 a.m. at the Electric
Factory, 1:15 a.m. at the Ritz, and
1:30 a.m. This final run will arrive
back on campus at 2:00 a.m.
In order to secure a seat on the
vans, students must make reservations during the week. "Students
have to sign up for the both the
shuttle they want to take into
Philly and out," Budish said. "You
can go in or out on any shuttle, but
you just have to sign up for it."
Students will have the option,
though, to take SEPTA in during

the afternoon and still sign up for a

seat on the van for a ride back to
campus.
The signup sheet will be available by Pat Coyne's desk in the
Dean's Office in Parrish.
The van will be a driven by the
current driver of the Strath Haven
shuttle, who has spent much of his
life in and around the Philadelphia
area. "We found someone who has
worked in Philly for years and'-ts*
very familiar with the area,"
Redgrave said. "He's the perfect
staff person for the job."
Currently, the organizers are

addressing a few minor concerns

and bugs that may come up with
the van service. "We're still trying
to figure out issues such as what to
do if, on one of the trips, too many

people want to come back at the

second stop, but everyone on the
van is not getting off until the third
stop," Redgrave said. "We have to
be very specific about who has
signed up and for what time and
stop they signed up for."
Traffic, Redgrave believes, will

not be a problem. "Traffic is
always unpredictable, but I think
we've built in enough of a buffer to
make sure we stay on schedule,"

he said.

Although Public Safety is heavily involved in this project, the
department cannot run emergency
pickups. "The thing we can't stress
enough," Budish said, "is that if
you miss the shuttle, there's just
nothing we can do for you. Public
Safety cannot go out and get you."
Although students have been
expressing interest in utilizing
these vans, the coordinators caution that the program will remain
on an interim basis throughout
this semester.
"I hope that an overwhelming
response

would encourage the
administration to do this again
next year," Budish said.
"The vans ought to be more full
than empty," Schall said. "If it's
going in with only two people, it
doesn't make a lot of sense to spend
money on this project."
October 33, 2002

Campaign, have loudly voiced a desire for large increases in staff
wages. But the group with the power to make policy recommendations to the college's Board of Managers has been closed to students until now.
It was a departure for the President's Office to mandate an adhoc committee of staff, faculty and students in order to look into
implementing a living wage for staff. Student Council appointed
the four student representatives to the committee Wednesday.
"The committee is charged to see what a living wage means for
Swarthmore and how it should be implemented, not what it
means for the rest of the country but what it means for
Swarthmore, what responsibility the school has to its employees," Student Council co-president Ryan Budish 'O4 said.
The four students, along with three or four staff members
selected by the Staff Advisory Committee, psychology professor
Barry Schwartz, Vice President for Human Resources Melanie
Young and three other faculty members, will be developing a proposal on how a living wage can be realized at Swarthmore.
The new members have high expectations for the committee.
"I hope that the committee will provide an opportunity for hammering out what a feasible number from the school's perspective
that will generate enough income for a family to actually support
itself," Burstein said.
Student Council looked to appoint ideologically diverse students to the committee.
Neither Burstein nor Brown is a member of the Living Wage
Campaign on campus, though both have some experience working with issues pertinent to low-wage workers.
"I don't think that Swat operates as a market and that the
result of paying people more is that they won't work as hard or
that you'll have to lay people off," Burstein said. "While there
aren't unlimited funds, there are ways to pay for things at a college."
Brown did not believe she had enough knowledge of the numbers involved to have a definitive opinion on the subject, but she
said she "definitely wants to make sure that there aren't cuts in
benefits so that it doesn't make a wage increase meaningless."
Bradbury and Zuppann, the other two students appointed to
the committee were not available for comment.
Bradbury is an active member member in Swarthmore's
Living Wage Campaign.
Budish described Zuppann as an "economist" with "reservations" about the living wage.
To ensure that the committee would not remain focused on ideological debate, interviews were conducted to find if people were
going to be able to compromise, Budish said.
Budish looked to pick a group of students that reflects the
diversity of opinion in student body. "We've been looking for people who will bring a range of opinions to this committee, both people who believe very strongly in the living wage and people who
are more skeptical of it," he said.
Out of 22 applicants he felt there was a "good mix." As expected applicants were "mostly students who were in favor of the living wage with several students who weren't sure where they
stood about the issue and a few people who were against it," he
said.
The council particularly encouraged students not involved
with the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign to apply for the
committee positions.
Living Wage Campaign Co-President Mariah Montgomery 'O4
was optimistic about the potential of the new committee. "To me,
what's really relevant is that the mandate of the committee is how
a living wage can be done at Swarthmore, not if."
Concerning the appointees to the committee, Montgomery
said that "in the name of expediency and having the committee
run smoothly, I don't think it will be helpful to have someone who
opposes the living wage because I don't think that's the mandate
of the committee."

Phi Psi, CIVIC form unlikely fundraising team
BY PREETY SIDHU
ssidhul@swarthmore.edu

Hoping to ease the money crunch facing
community service groups this semester,
the Phi Psi fraternity is sponsoring two
fundraisers this weekend. Proceeds from
these events will go to Cooperative
Involvement of Volunteers in Community,
also know as CIVIC, the umbrella organization for community service groups on
campus.
On Thursday night at 6:00 PM in
Sharpies, about ten Phi Psi brothers and
other volunteers will be auctioned off as
dates or servants, in an event similar to the
annual SAO Valentine auction. Then, on
Saturday night from 10:00 PM to 2:00 AM,
Phi Psi will host a 70s-themed party and
charge an entrance fee of $3 for singles or
$5 for couples.

The unlikely joint venture between Phi

Psi and CIVIC was first conceived earlier
this year by Greg Lok 'O4, a Phi Psi brother
and co-coordinator of the CIVIC Dare to
Soar program and Chinatown tutorial. He
approached Phi Psi, which had been look-

ing for a community service project, and
met with an enthusiastic response. The
group found the idea of helping CIVIC particularly appealing because it focuses on
improving the campus community first, in
order to do better community service
beyond the college, Lok said. Phi Psi then
took the idea to Daryl Smaw, Dean of
Multicultural Affairs, who agreed to provide advice and support for the project.
Members of CIVIC feel that the organization was not given a sufficient budget by
the SBC for the fall semester, and the monetary constraints have forced cutbacks in
activity.
Ranmal Samarasinghe 'O3, coordinator
of Serving Homeless Individuals in
Philadelphia (SHIP), said that his group
has had to reduce the number of trips it
makes to the city. "The money is out there
and community service groups shouldn't

be in this position," he said
"The CIVIC coordinators feel that we

are lacking in financial support," Lok said.
"They are trying to help the underprivileged and they are being restricted in trying to achieve their goals. If we are to consider ourselves the best of the elite universities that emphasizes social responsibility,
instead of projected us, back it up. Then,
why aren't these groups getting proper support?"
Lok also hopes to raise awareness
regarding SBC policies that prevent groups
from using student activities' money to
fund field trips with the students they mentor. "The innate goal of community service
organizations is to extend a hand to less
privileged communities," Lok said. "This
encompasses doing these activities."
Last Friday, about twenty Phi Psi and
CIVIC members met over dinner in the
BCC to plan the party. "Since this is the
first time we are doing something like this,
I'd be happy just to get a few hundred dollars," said Phi Psi president Josh Loeffler
'O3. Samarasinghe agreed. "Even if we
don't make much money, word will get out
that we're having funding problems," he

said.
Phi Psi and CIVIC have not formed any
concrete plans for the money they hope to
generate from the fundraisers. Lok hopes
that the money could be saved for a year
and eventually become part of a CIVIC
endowment that would cover the expenses
that cannot currently be covered by SBC

funds. The groups may also seek outside
donors who are willing to match every dollar raised by Phi Psi to build this endow-

ment.

Each group is excited to be working
with the other for a common cause. "I'm
really grateful that they're doing this. They
are the ones organizing and putting everything together," Samarasinghe said. Phi
Psi is holding the party in their frat house
and handling the advertising, decorations,

music, drinks and cleanup.

Members of the Phi Psi fraternity and CIVIC are collaborating on fundraising projects.

"Phi Psi is really putting out the effort
here," Lok said. "It's not just symbolic." He
noted that there is also general campus
participation, in the form of students
donating meal numbers so that Phi Psi can
get party supplies from Sharpies.
"I think it's great that we're bringing
together groups who can benefit from each
other, who have never talked before,"
Loeffler said. "I would like to see the relationship with CIVIC and the fundraising
continue into the future. Hopefully years
from now Phi Psi will have a more active
part in the community service aspect of
CIVIC, like tutoring."
"I wouldn't mind working with Phi Psi
in the future, but hopefully the circumstances will be different and we'll have the
money we need," said Samarasinghe.
Lok hopes that this coalition is not a
one-stop deal. "We are a diverse campus,
but we are also segregated in many ways,"
he said. "I hope this will encourage more

people on campus to come -together for
common events. A lot of people complain
about Swarthmore, and I want to show
that, instead of complaining, you can go
out and do something positive."
In addition to setting a model for cooperation on campus, Lok hopes that this
event will raise campus awareness about
the problems that CIVIC is facing. "This
coalition is good, but we need to look at
why CIVIC needs to fundraise separately to
finance community service activities and
what we can do to elevate this to the next

level," he said.
If all goes well, these fundraisers will be
the first step in encouraging cooperation
among campus groups, generating interest
in community service, increasing awareness and campus dialogue about the financial problems faced by CIVIC and hopefully alleviating some of these problems.
I
really do want to leave this campus a better
"

place," Lok

said.

Professor urges applying lessons of Buddhism for peace
Sivaraksa: Americans must not equate justice with physical punishment
BY MANU PRADHAN
mpradhal@swarthmore.edu

Before a packed Kirby lecture hall last Thursday, Lang
Professor of Social Change Sulak Sivaraksa took the podium and explained how Buddhism can be interpreted to formulate a coherent response to acts of violence.
Speaking in reference to the events of Sept. 11,
Sivaraksa began with a strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks. While he decried the attacks as "shocking in
their nature and their magnitude," he was quick to question the similarly violent nature of the United States'
response, which he said "risks escalating and perpetuating
the cycle of violence."
Over the course of the talk, Sivaraksa explained his reasoning. As co-founder of both the Asian Cultural Forum on
Development and the International Network of Engaged
Buddhists, he has devoted his entire career to effecting

change by applying the lessons of spirituality to politics.

Rather than maintain a division between the individual
and the rest of the world, Sivaraksa insisted that the transformation of society must begin at the micro level with a
period of critical self-reflection.

Sivaraksa explained that one of the lessons to be
learned from Buddhism is that "our preconceptions are
often biased" and that whether the goal is personal salvation or collective action, it is essential for people to resist
"their fixed conceptions" of the world.
As a result Sivaraksa levied a harsh critique on the
response of the Bush administration to the terrorist

injustice of the attacks, he said, would only be
“compounded by violence in retaliation,” whereas the most
holistic approach would have been for the Bush administration to lead Americans in a search of “compassion and
forgiveness.”

attacks. The

“Hopefully the tragedy of 9-11 will
not breed seeds of hate
but will teach.”
Sulak Sivaraksa
Sivaraksa explained that a large part of the problem
resulted from most people’s preconceptions of what comprises violence. He repeatedly stressed that nonviolence
does not equate to doing nothing but instead an active
strategy of protest, defiance, and courage. “Peace is not
merely an absence of war,” he reminded the audience, but
the result of active processes and “a manifestation of our
actions.”
Creating a “culture of peace” depends on our willingness to learn about other cultures and peoples, Sivaraksa
stressed, and our desire to “sow the seeds of peace.” Bush’s
declaration of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an ‘Axis of
Evil,’ however, comprises an obstacle to this goal in

October 33, 2002

Sivaraksa's view, since dualistic thinking ultimately stifles critical evaluation. He likened Bush to Hitler and
Stalin in this regard, arguing that the declaration of the
'Axis of Evil,' Hitler's 'Final Solution,' and Stalin's extermination of independent peasants were similar attempts
"to perfect the world by destroying its [perceived] impurities."
Sivaraksa asked thatAmericans and policymakers alike
not allow themselves to fall prey to such human flaws as
greed, ignorance and hatred but instead work "to disarm
anger in our own hearts." He pointed out that Buddhism
teaches the value of meditation and self-introspection,
which results in the freeing of oneself from irrational emotions and impulses. Sivaraksa then argued that society's
goal should be the attainment of a "mindful detachment
that allows us to help others" and asserted that upon reaching such a plateau "we must investigate deeply the causes
and conditions" that help shape the world.
Continuing in this vein, Sivaraksa said that American
society must engage in a "re-examination of our concept of
justice," implying that the Bush administration runs a
danger in equating justice with punishment. He put for-

ward the idea that a truer form of justice could be reached
if America tapped into the real source of its power, which
he said lies not in its military forces "but in its constitution, its crucial leadership in the U.N., democracy, and its
tradition of compassion in human rights." He ended his
lecture with an optimistic but pleading tone: "Hopefully
the tragedy of 9-11 will not breed seeds of hate but will
teach."

SC passes new bylaw after Chotalia resigns
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

Student Council once again faces an unexpected mid'O3 resigned his
position as Appointments Chair this week.
Citing a recent decision to graduate a year ahead of
schedule, Chotalia stepped down after serving three
quarters of his one-year term on council.
"It's my last semester at Swat, and I didn't know that
when I originally ran for council," he said. "Next semester, I'm going to be traveling and writing my thesis.
There are more pressing and urgent things I want to
accomplish during my last semester on campus."
Chotalia's resignation goes into effect this week after
SC appoints the student members of the Ad Hoc
Committee on a Living Wage. These appointments are
the last facing the council until the fall appointments
toward the end of November. "One of the things I was
concerned about was to make sure I finished any pressing business before resigning," he said.
SC co-president Ryan Budish 'O4 expressed frustration
over Chotalia's resignation. "I can understand that he
has a lot of things going on, but it's obviously disappointing to have someone resign, especially in the middle of the semester," he said. "It's just going to be an
added hurdle as we face fall appointments."
But Budish said council was hardly surprised by
Chotalia's decision to step down. "I think there were
some tensions among various members of the council,
and in that respect, I'm not surprised that this happened," he said. "Some members of the council felt that

semester opening, after Chirag Chotalia

Chotalia was not doing enough for the council."
Co-president Matt Rubin 'O3 noted that Chotalia's

departure was not necessarily a hindrance to the council. "While we always regret losing members, I think
Chirag made a good decision since it's been clear from

his performance this semester that he does not have the
time to adequately discharge his duties," Rubin said.
"We wish him the best of luck in his other endeavors and
hope that he will have adequate time to commit to them."
At this point in the semester, according to Budish, it
would be impractical for the council to call a special election to fill the empty position. Budish will assume the
duties of Appointments Chair until a permanent replacement can be found.
"Hopefully, we can find someone with enough council
experience to replace Chirag," Rubin said.
Since the council routinely faces the problem of elected members resigning with their terms unfulfilled,
Budish introduced at this Monday's council meeting a
proposal for a bylaw to the Student Council Constitution.
The purpose of this bylaw, Budish explained, is to establish a set way for the council to fill an empty council seat
in a timely manner. "We want to have a system in place
to make it easier to deal with vacancies," he said.
The new bylaw states that in the event of a midterm
resignation, the council co-presidents can "jointly nominate a student to fill the vacated spot as an interim member until a special election may be held." Additionally,
the appointed member cannot be a current council member and must be approved by two thirds of the existing
council members. The bylaw grants the co-presidents the
power to administer the duties of the vacated member
until an interim member is secured.
""I think that the bylaw will avoid us having to elect
people to position for which their entire tenure will consist
of training," said Rubin. "Certain positions such as
appointments committee require a lot of complicated
work. Generally the first half of the first semester of that
position is just training and acclimation."
In addition, Budish announced a new attendance policy for council meetings. "Given how we almost didn't
have enough members to have a quorum, we are going to

Student Council as the Appointments Chair.

institute a new attendance policy," he said. "If a member
has three unexcused absences, we will ask for your resignation first, and if you don't resign, we will move to
impeach you."

A successful impeachment of a council member,
according to the Constitution, requires a two-thirds vote
by other council members.

Swat students join thousands at D.C. protest
BY KELSEY HOLLENBACK
khollenl@swarthmore.edu

More than 100,000 people from across the
nation, including a group of about forty
Swarthmore College students, gathered by
the Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C.
last Saturday to protest military action
against Iraq.
Student Progressive Action Committee
(SPAC) and Why-War, two Swarthmore student organizations, coordinated sign-ups
and transportation to the protest. The two
groups also worked together earlier this
year, arranging transportation to a similar
protest in New York City.
"We are constantly in touch with each

other, and it's almost a division of laborkind
of thing," explained Pete Mohanty 'O5 of
Why-War. "People are involved in the different groups for different reasons, but really it's the same spirit of things. There would
really be no point in being like, 'Well, you
going with the protest with Why-War or with
SPAC?'"
"It's logistical stuff like vans," added Kim
Bussey 'O4 from SPAC. "Going to a protest,
obviously we're not the ones planning the
protest in D.C, so it's just about getting people down there. So we work together."
Despite concerns that the weather and
the Washington sniper would discourage
people from going, protest organizers said
that an estimated 200,000 attended the event,
which was sponsored by the International
ANSWER Coalition.
"I think that it was a really great rally.
You had a tremendous amount of people

biggest march and rally that I have ever
been to," said Al Bradbury 'O5, 'and it was
people from all walks of life, not only radicals and not only students, but all kind of
people coming out to protest the war."
"I think it did succeed in making it very
clear that there is a large amount of dissent,
that Bush does not speak for all Americans
like he claims to," agreed Andrew Main 'O5.

Added Bussey, "It was this mix of people,
and I think that was really effective in showing that the antiwar movement is not just a

fringe thing."
Speakers also represented a broad range
of interests and backgrounds. They included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al
Sharpton, recently defeated Rep. Cynthia A.
McKinney of Georgia, former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark, and actress Susan

Sarandon.
Several students noted that the speakers
at the rally could have been better organized. "I think they made a mistake putting
the stronger, more famous and inspirational
speakers in the middle instead of the end,"
said Jesse O'Brien 'O3. "They got people all
riled up and the rally ended on kind of a
weak note."
"Sometimes they got off topic," said
Main, adding, "but it didn't bother me that

much." He said that because there are a
large variety of people who go to such
events, there is a tendency for a lot of other
issues to be mentioned. Also, he said, there
is an obligation to be as inclusive as possible.
"One of the really nice things about the
speakers was there was a balance between
politics and religious figures like Al
Sharpton and Jesse Jackson," said Mohanty.
He said that he especially liked Jackson's
comments regarding a preemptive strike

against Iraq.

"If we launch a preemptive strike on

we lose all moral authority," Jackson
said during his speech. "How will we say no
to India, to Pakistan, to China when they
consider preemptive strikes?
Saddam
Hussein should be held accountable for his
crimes. That's a good argument for the
International Criminal Court, not a good
argument for bombing Baghdad."
Also a strong presence at the rally was
U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, who was killed in a
plane crash last Friday. Wellstone was the
only senator in a re-election battle who
voted against the resolution granting the
administration the ability to use force
Iraq,

...

against Iraq.
Protesters carried signs proclaiming that

"Paul Will Rest in the Peace We Make," and
Jackson began his speech by calling on the

crowd to remember Wellstone.
"His seat may be filled; his principles and
commitment to integrity and passion and
purpose will not be so easily filled," Jackson
said. "Let us rededicate ourselves to the
cause of peace and justice that Paul always
fought for."
Jackson also acknowledged the large

amount of students in the crowd, who had
arrived on buses from as far as Dartmouth
and the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill.
"People often say the young are our
future, but I beg to differ. You are our present, you are our right now," said Jackson.
"When young America moves, the whole
world moves."
The march began and ended at the
Vietnam Memorial, and throughout the
protest, the specter of that war was prevalent, appearing in speeches, on protest signs,
and echoed in the chants of protesters as
they marched past the White House.
"If there's this many people against the
war before it even starts, it sends a message
to the people in power that if the war happens, there's going to be a lot of people who
are going to resist it in every way they can,
and that number will only grow as the war
goes on as with the Vietnam War." O'Brien
agreed. "If it follows the same pattern,
which it seems there would, it's a warning to
the administration that it will be resisted on
every level."

A LOOK AT SWAT'S QUEER CULTURE
Yes, Coming Out Week was last
week. But the queer community thrives all
year, and the college continues to boast one
of the most queer-friendly campuses in

America as part of its image. The Phoenix
looks at queer culture, in the classroom and
on the sidewalk, and at how coming out happens just as often as homophobia.

ON COMING OUT QUEER PROFESSORS HOMOPHOBIA AND SQU WHY THE CHALKINGS

ON COMING OUT
BY MATTHEW FITTING

Rebecca

Weinberger 'O3 doesn't remember who
said it first but she remembers being in the
room that afternoon when she was 12, with her
best friend, talking about boys and crushes.
Before she knew the world bisexual, before she had
kissed a girl or even thought about it, she and her
friend realized their crushes were not gender-specific,
that they could just as easily be attracted to the girls
they knew as to the boys.
In the decade since, Weinberger has had
boyfriends and girlfriends, and come out to her sister
(in a letter), to her mother (on a car ride back home to
Vermont from a college visit to Wesleyan
"not the
best time," she said), and to friends, faculty and staff
countless times here at Swarthmore. The experience,
she said, never fails to intimidate.
it
"I really thought coming out was over then
isn't," she said, referring to the time when everyone in
her immediately family knew of her bisexuality. "It is
continual," and the best way to go about it has proved
elusive. Around people she doesn't know very well or
might be uncomfortable with, Weinberger sometimes
finds it difficult talking about a current girlfriend or
girl she's dated in the past. "I use 'they' a lot incorrectly, in the singular when I'm talking to a new person," she said, instead of simply "she."
Students who come out face such a continual
process, one where they reveal their sexual orientaand sometimes
tion to new people all the time
reveal changing self-perceptions about their orientation to their closest friends, deciding now to be bisexual, or queer, or straight, when the previous day those
friends thought of them as something different, or
even the complete opposite.

AN ENVIRONMENT OF ALLIES
Many students, staff and faculty agree that the
allies and atmosphere needed to make coming out as
comfortable a process as possible are found at
Swarthmore; the college's well-known image of queerfriendliness, said Assistant Dean of Gender Education
Karen Henry, is deserved.
Though Henry acknowledged that there are still
those at Swarthmore who might be uncomfortable living side by side with queer students, for the most part,
she said, the community is open and accepting. For
Henry, who came out while working at a gay and lesbian agency, Swarthmore shows its support for queer
employees in many ways, some small but meaningful
like by providing domestic partnership insurance,
something the agency Henry worked at failed to offer.
Aside from such tangible support, the community,
Henry said, is one filled with people who are not only

understanding and non-judgmental, but accepting and
embracing of those who come out. "Like any other
I want to say experience of self-exploration
you
need some friends to support the process," she said.
"You need allies to speak for you in times when you
can't stand up for yourself."
Henry and other openly queer staff and faculty

show their support for students, she said, by staying purposefully open. Students look to those staffand faculty members for an adult's perspective. "Sometimes we forget that
students view us as role models," she said, but added that
she's often reminded, as with last week's queer staff and faculty panel. Adults will ask questions peers won't, added
Multicultural Dean Darryl Smaw, though peers are usually
more relied on for emotional support.
The college's administration, Henry said, also does a
good job of making sure the issue of sexual orientation doesn't get brushed aside or trivialized. "Swarthmore's commitment to diversity and sexual orientation as part of that
diversity is very important," she said. Henry expressed
approval of those administrators who work with diversity
issues to keep sexual orientation as part of what diversity

means.

For William Tran 'O3, the Swarthmore Queer Union
is an important part of the college's effort to present
itself as accepting ofits queer community. The organization
is part of the Intercultural Center, and the center in turn is
included in the Dean's Office. This structure, according to
Tran, shows that the administration is serious about its
commitment to a queer-friendly campus. "The administration says outside, 'We don't tolerate homophobia.'"
But an administration that takes such steps to support its
queer community isn't enough, Smaw said. He believes
Swarthmore is closer than most colleges to reaching what
would be an ideal setting for those who are coming out, one
"that is tolerant and accepting of difference at any level,"
where a student "should be able to be or come out and
acknowledge it is who they are, and would feel safe in this
community." But there is still room for improvement, and it
will fall mainly, he said, to members of the campus community, who shape the immediate environment that surrounds
queer students.
"I think Swarthmore as a community is probably more
open and accepting of the discourse needed to move it
toward the ideal," he said, "that is more open to engaging the
dialogue needed."
Such dialogue and thought should take place both "formally inside the classroom and informally outside the classroom," Smaw said. "It happens in the dorms, it happens in
the dining halls, in classrooms with course discourse," he
said. In "all these various venues," the understanding is cul(SQU)

tivated.

For some, an atmosphere conducive to coming out is a
non-issue. "As far as for me, I never came out, I was just out,"
Katie Davenport 'O5 said. "At this point there's no announcement, I am who I am."
This view of queerness, she said, has been liberating, and
makes her feel more accepted. "Most people I know don't feel
the need to announce they're straight," she said. "I don't feel
the need to announce I'm gay." Davenport added that she has

never attended a SQU meeting, and doesn't intend to,

because the organization tries to create one queer community, and she doesn't believe such a community can encompass every queer view.
And, in the end, she sees no need to make her queerness
an issue, political or otherwise. "I don't think me talking
about my girlfriend is different than you talking about your
girlfriend," she said. "I don't think my sexuality makes a difference unless you want to go out with me."

DIFFERENT WAYS OF COMING OUT

Tran said that "a majority" of Swarthmore students are accepting to those who come out.
Weinberger said she's been lucky: Rarely has she
encountered a negative reaction when she's come out
to someone, here or otherwise. "All of the people I
interact with [at Swarthmore] are queer friendly,"
she said, "whether they're straight or queer." She
emphasized, however, that this might be because she
chooses to be friends with people who are queer
friendly.

Intercultural (IC) Director Rafael Zapata sees in
Swarthmore a very different world from the one he's

from
New York City's Chelsea district, "perhaps at
this time the most visible gay community," he said.
Zapata remembers seeing sights there like "people
drunk and swinging on gay men holding hands," a
stark contrast to what he sees now. "The students I've
come across, they do feel comfortable being out at
Swarthmore," he said. "I saw homophobia, I saw violence," and the college, he added, provides an atmosphere where the community rejects such practices.
So with an atmosphere mutually agreed on as
accepting, how do different students come out differently?
For Stephanie Fox 'O4 and Elizabeth Holman 'O4,
being a couple makes the coming out process easier.
"People are like, 'They're very affectionate friends
...

maybe not,'" Holman said, and usually being together allows both to forego any sort of formal declaration. "You don't have to say, 'l'm queer,' you can just
say, 'My girlfriend,' and that doesn't make people

uncomfortable."
Both said the lack of homophobia at Swarthmore
is essential to the queer-friendly atmosphere, but
added that the constant questioning many students
go through can lead to a sense of continuing fluidity.
"Your sexuality is more up for grabs because the community's not necessarily homophobic," Holman said.
Though this fluidity allows many to change their selfperception of sexuality everyday if they like, "I feel
like the jury's out on what so many people are," she
added.
While Holman couldn't remember a single person
who has formally come out to her, for Fox, "it was
actually really important to come out to my closest
friends," she said. "The fears I had were certainly not
reflective of what reaction of what my friends would
have or what I thought I'd have," but the internal
questioning process leading up to her coming out was
so affecting that she felt the need sit down those closest to her and formally tell them.
Holman said their differing experiences were a
good example of how "Coming out here is really
charged with people's homes." For those, like Tran,
who weren't openly out before they came to
Swarthmore, the methods for coming out can vary.
For Holman, who describes her mother as very liberal and understanding, she still could just say she was
in SQU for a while
she found herself unable

HOMOPHOBIA AND SQU
BY GREG NELSON
Flirting was the topic at the Queer
Straight Alliance (QSA) panel discussion Monday. The conversation was
more light-hearted than is usual for the
subjects of discussion included
group
differences between flirting among
friends and strangers, being caught
flirting, methods of withdrawing from a
flirting-based relationship and post
hook-up flirting.
The seemingly illogical subject of
flirting among straight men was also
covered. "I always see guys beating
each other up in this very affectionate
way, even though some of those guys
would have immediate strong reactions
against the idea of a relationship with
another guy," one person noted.
"Just because they beat each other
up doesn't mean they want to get with
each other," another responded.
"Even if they don't want to get with
each other definitely a sexual subtext,"
someone else pointed out.
No one identifying himself as a
straight male took part in the debate.
This light-hearted conversation is representative of a deeper socio-political
debate within Swarthmore's queer community, one that includes not only how
queer students should be perceived by
others, but how they themselves perceive
members of the straight community.
Whatever homophobia exists at
Swarthmore manifests itself differently
than it does at other schools. Brian

Nolan 'O5 is one of six students on the
board of the Swarthmore Queer Union
(SQU), a student organization open only to
students who define themselves as queer or
questioning. Swarthmore's community is
an "implicit support situation," he said.
This is "in contrast to a school like
Villanova where it is assumed that the
environment is hostile." Villanova, as an
institution, is generally considered to be
far more socially conservative than
Swarthmore; because Villanova is a
Catholic school, its governing philosophy
views homosexuality as immoral. At
Swarthmore, Nolan said, queer students
"don't have to worry as much about being
misunderstood or judged."
This, however, does not mean that
Swarthmore's queer students are not in
need of support, Nolan pointed out. Many
freshmen, he said, have trouble "adjusting
to the openness. They're not used to being
able to talk about sexuality in general, or
queer sexuality in particular."
Another part of the adjustment, Nolan
explained, is "finding yourself within the
political spectrum" of the queer community. One side of this spectrum is "integrationist," which is how he defines himself.
He used the analogy of two houses on
either side of a white picket fence, one
occupied by a queer couple, and one occupied by a straight couple, who have more
their humanity, the fact that
in common
than they have
they are sexual beings
keeping them apart.
Others, Nolan says, do not see it this
way, and feel that a more confrontational

Elisabeth Oppenheimer 'O5 traced the disagreements

over the content of the chalkings to disagreements about
their purpose. "I think there isn't a general campus consensus or a queer community consensus about what
Coming Out Week or the chalkings are all about," she said.
"Some people see [the chalkings] as just reminding people

See HOMOPHOBIA, pg. 9

that there are queer people in the world. Other people
see it as a way of getting to say things [that otherwise
can't be said] or of saying that queer people have to deal
with this all the time."
Tran said chalkings were "purely just fun," as well
as an effort to create dialogue, and "a show of support
for queer people."
Brian Nolan 'O5 mentioned those and other ideas.
"From a pride standpoint, chalking's a very strong
show of queer pride," he said. "It's also a way to politicize issues
if people aren't as aware of issues, it's a
way of making them aware." Nolan stressed the point
that the chalkings were partly to support queer students. "The chalkings are a very visible way of communicating that this campus is a queer friendly place," he
said. "Each day they are on the sidewalk shows tolerance."
Last year's chalkings sent a strong message to
Quincey Winston 'O6, who said at Thursday night's Ring
discussion that he decided to come to Swarthmore partly because of his visit during Coming Out Week.
Sometimes, though, the chalkings spark antipathy.
Last year, in what some considered an act of homophobic harassment, Jeffrey Rogg 'O5 confronted SQU representatives tabling at Sharpies and angrily condemned
the more graphic chalkings.
The non-graphic chalking "10% is not enough
recruit, recruit, recruit," has also proved controversial.
"We see it as a joke," Nolan said, "turning something
around, akin to the chalking 'some of my best friends
are straight.' But it's hard for people to understand that
if they haven't had the relevant experience."
Students stressed that negative responses to chalkings are rare. Tran remembers past chalkings as positive experiences. "Two years ago, the most negative
which
response we got was a letter to the Phoenix
was at least a good outcome in terms of dialogue."
Nolan agreed. "From what I've heard, last year was
the most controversial year," he said.
Still, last year's events raised questions within the

queer profs
One of last week's Coming
Out Week events, a faculty
panel on Monday night, gave
professors a chance to voice
what it means to them to be
queer at Swarthmore. "I wasn't invited to be on the panel,
but I attended and ended up
sitting on the panel anyway,"
psychology professor Edward
Kako said. "It was a very pro-

ductive panel."

Students asked the faculty
about their coming out stories

student experiences are like
today, and I can see that the
process of coming out is generally good," said Kako, who par-

ticipated in an organization
similar to SQU when he came
out in college thirteen years
ago.
Aside from this panel,
queer professors generally

supported, but had little direct
involvement with, Coming Out
Week. As for the other events,

and what life is like after coming out. Some students who
had grown up outside the
United States puzzled over the
status of coming out as a major
life event. Faculty panelists
took the opportunity to ask
students questions as well. "It
was good to get a sense of what

feel uncomfortable going as a
faculty member," said Kako.
"These are student spaces."
"I like walking out and seeing the in-your-face chalkings
on the ground," English professor Edmund Campos said.
"I think all schools need to
remind the general population

BY PREETY SIDHU
that there is a contingent of gay
students. It is absolutely necessary to create this coming out
environment. I have worked at
schools where only three or four
students were out and it was real-

ly sad."

Most queer professors see
their sexual orientation as irrelevant to their roles as Swarthmore
professors. Kako said that sexual

orientation never factors into
normal interactions with faculty
or students and has little to do
with his day-to-day job. While
Campos agreed that most of the
time at work he doesn't need to be
aware of his sexual orientation,
he believes that being queer
affected his decision to become a
in the first place.
"Growing up as a queer Latino
boy, I saw academia as a safe
space," he said. "When I was in
college I discovered that colleges
are welcoming and open enough
that there one can avoid persecution. Academia has always been
so nice to gay people, not unconditionally, but historically."
In the classroom, professors
usually don't come across opportunities, or see the need, to disclose their sexual orientation.
Students, however, often know
anyway. "The material I teach has
nothing to do with sexuality, sexual orientation or politics so I
don't have to confront teaching
these issues," Kako said.
Campos,
who
teaches
Shakespeare, does approach his
subject differently than a straight
professor might, and has brought
up many queer issues in the classroom. "126 of Shakespeare's 152
love sonnets are dedicated to a
'fair youth' and have very homoerotic undertones," he pointed
out.
While some students enjoy the
fact that this approach undermines their high-school knowledge of Shakespeare, Campos has

assignments and believes that

other students may be uncomfortable with these ideas.
Kako's relationship to students in the classroom is no
different than that of a straight
professor, but he finds it "easy
to talk to queer and questioning students and easier to
establish more personal contacts than with straight stu-

dents." While he believes that
some students find the fact
that he is out comforting,
queer students don't generally
look to queer professors for
support. "When I was coming
out, I looked to older people as
role models and for advice,"
Campos said. "Swarthmore
students appreciate gay faculty, but aren't dependent on

them. They are coming out
earlier and into a highly developed support network of their

peers."
In terms of their relationships with other professors,
queer faculty members are
essentially no different from
straight professors. "My part-

ner is treated as a spouse no
different from any other
spouse in the department,"

Kako said. There is an infor-

mal network of gay professors,
but the extent of their socializing really depends on whether
or not they live close to each
other,
in the town of
Swarthmore.
"The
situation
at
Swarthmore is great. It's
exactly the way I want it," said
Kako. "I would not want to
work at a place where I had to
conceal my sexual orientation,
modify pronouns, and so on.
This a like a gift, a perk of
working here."
Campos, who has worked at
schools that were what he calls
deeply homophobic, agrees. He
also thinks that office spaces
and the corporate world would
be much more hostile to gay
employees. At similar institutions of higher learning, however, being gay is usually not
an issue, and the atmosphere
for gay faculty is like that at

Swarthmore.
"The liberal atmosphere at
Swarthmore is fantastic," said

Campos. "The danger, however, is that one can become less
vigilant about gay rights. It is
important to go through yearly
rituals, such as Coming Out
Week, so as not to become complacent."

Some SQU members question method for chalkings

queer community and led some students to wonder
whether the chalkings helped create a supportive environment for queer students when they raised feelings
of antagonism towards the queer community.
Responding to these and other concerns, SQU hosted a
discussion on Wednesday, October 9 to determine what
members wanted from this year's chalkings.
Oppenheimer, who facilitated the discussion, noted
that a variety of suggestions were considered. For
example, "some people wanted to chalk quotes from
right-wing hate groups and attribute them [to those
who said them] but we didn't want to do that because
we didn't think that would make people feel very comfortable coming out."

Many participants in the SQU meeting favored
avoiding especially graphic chalkings. "The overwhelming consensus [at the meeting] was that people
didn't want to antagonize
with highly sexually
explicit chalkings," said Oppenheimer. But as Tran
noted, participants "decided we are not pro-censor...

ship. We want it to be a fun event; we didn't want to
tell people what words they could use." The decision
made was to communicate two points to chalkers:
first, that they should keep in mind the objective of
creating a safe atmosphere for people who want to
come out, and second, that they should remember that
anything they wrote would inevitably be associated
with the queer community as a whole.
The problem, according to some participants in the
SQU discussion, was that those who would have
favored more graphic chalkings did not attend the
meeting. "People who would have expressed a different view didn't show up," Nolan observed.
Oppenheimer said that when the discussion group's
conclusions were reported to those participating in the
Sunday night chalking, they were not taken seriously.
"[Our conclusions] were communicated
but
briefly," she said. "We probably should have talked
there was no discussion."

While no major objections were voiced to this
year's chalkings, someone erased parts of graphic
chalkings. "Some time in the early morning after the

first night someone erased all the words like 'fuck,'
'dick,' and *pussy' ..." Elinore Kaufman 'O4 recounted.
Kaufman and a few other SQU members restored the
erased words to all chalkings.
Members of SQU cautioned against regarding the
selective erasures as homophobic. "It's unclear exactly what happened," Nolan pointed out. "I would not
call it an anti-gay thing at a 11... It could well have been
people within the queer community." Tran and
Kaufman both condemned the erasures as suppressing
the speech of the chalkers. But Tran pointed out that
some members of the queer community might also feel
that writers of graphic chalkings were at fault for
refusing to participate in the dialogue at the SQU
meeting.
For Tran, it all comes back to the issue of diversity.
"Just in general I want people to know that SQU is in
an incredibly difficult position
more diverse now
than it's ever been and trying to represent all those
viewpoints," he concluded. "People should just try
their best to understand that these are individuals
writing [the chalkings], not SQU."

Tran said, "I guess you could say it
[Swarthmore] helped, but a better way
to put it was forced," though, he insisted,
not in a bad way. Iran began living out
during his freshman orientation,
because he knew the Swarthmore
atmosphere would be for the most part
friendly. "It wasn't even about telling
people I was gay," he said, "but just saying, 'That boy is cute' or something."

A SHELTERING EXPERIENCE?
But as much as Holman appreciates
the

open,

accepting

community

Swarthmore offers, there are times she
looks ahead to life after college and
gets nervous.
Most of the worries center on the
need, in places where constant questioning isn't as accepted as it is at
Swarthmore, to make a declaration

in the workplace, in circles of friends,
when trying to adopt a child. "I feel
like I'll have to officially come out and
say this is what I am and choose a category for people," she said.
Fox added that it's always a big
relief coming back to Swarthmore
after breaks or summer, or to get off a
particularly stressful phone call with
her parents, and appreciate all over
again the accepting environment in
which she lives.
But such a community, in Holman's
view, takes away the defense mechanisms so many in the queer community find necessary in life. "I really
haven't been challenged," she said of
her time at Swarthmore.
But while many can't claim they
have experienced homophobic encoun-

weeks, to come out to her roommate.

Weinberger said that, after a conference with the hall RA, her roommate

Weinberger's roommate, though the
roommate herself said she wanted to

move.

Weinberger said, "I grew up in a community where I was only one like me. I
totally, purposefully chose a school
where I was going t be accepted,"
where classes use feminist analysis
and queer theory.
Still, "In some ways I feel you're
never going to be prepared for how
people are going to react," she added.
"I understand that it's difficult, but I
feel that most people will put themselves in an accepting community
again," usually in a large, coastal metropolitan area, like New York City or

Such locations, she said, were as
similar to Swarthmore as any to be
found in the U.S., and would most likely continue to provide as welcoming an
atmosphere to those who are coming
out as they found here.

Straight male antagonism?
From HOMOPHOBIA, pg. 7
some found these chalkings antagonistic and evert offensive.

Jeff Rogg 'O4 was among those who
found chalkings during last year's Coming
Out week to be in bad taste. "There was a
rampant use of swear words last year,"
Rogg said. "They did not make me want to
support this cause." He added that the
authors of last year's chalkings seemed to

be looking to antagonize him, rather than
"encouraging him to support their cause."

"They use this opportunity, in some
ways, to elicit a reaction that can be con-

strued as homophobic." Rogg said. "Who
the hell wants to advance a cause by eliciting negative reactions?"

"They use this opportunity,
in some ways, to elicit a
reaction that can be construed as homophobic."
Jeff Rogg 'O5
The chalkings that accompanied this
year's Coming Out Week reflected a debate
within the queer community about what
the purpose of the chalkings should be.

Though far from resolved, the debate left
at least some members of the queer community determined to keep the chalkings
this year less graphic, and more positive.
At least in Rogg's view, they appear to
have been successful. "I think Coming Out

Week was a lot more colorful, a lot more
visible than last year, and the chalkings
weren't offensive. I saw a lot of people
showing their affection to one another. I'd
rather have them showing their affection

for each other than antagonizing me.”
“I perceive a difference in the queer
community at Swat and the queer community at other schools,” Nolan said. “We
tend to be more politically active.” But
within that activity is a conflict among the

community itself. Some of the possibly
offensive vocabulary in a few of the chalkings was erased last week, and Nolan says
it is possible that it members of the queer
community did the erasing.
In an environment like Swarthmore’s,
where liberal thinking can become an
assumption, the relationship between the
queer and straight communities exists in a

more advanced form than it does elsewhere, Nolan said. “For a straight person
to be to be considered an ally to the queer
community here, they have to be politically active,” he explained. “At another
school just being a friend would be
enough.”
This does not mean homophobia does
not exist on Swarthmore’s campus, nor
does it mean that it is not sometimes
blown out of proportion. “A lot of it is confronting institutionalized heteronormativity,” Nolan said. “The application form
still has you fill out the blanks for a mother and a father. ‘Gay’ is still used unnecessarily as a meaningless adjective, and ‘fag’

is still used as a diminutive.”
However, he said, “There are people
here who think everyone is homophobic,”
and, “a certain amount of straight male
antagonism that still exists. There is that
caricature of a big football-like guy flirting
with cheerleaders in grunts and groans.”
Nolan believes this kind of straight
male stereotyping is “unfair” and “unconstructive” and that it is likely generated by
people lumping all straight males with
those “they have had negative experiences
in the past.”
“It’s a good subject for a meeting sometime,” he said.

A diverse crowd rallies against war on Iraq
KRISNA DUONG-LY
kduongll@swarthmore.edu
"I ain't gonna study war no more" and "I'm gonna lay
down my sword and shield" were two lyrics of a song performed by a new a cappella group, the Octavists, last
Thursday on Parrish steps. The performance expressed the
sentiments of a number of speakers who voiced their concerns about the proposed military action against Iraq to more
than a hundred students, faculty, staff and local residents.
Student, faculty and community speakers drew on past
international conflicts as well as future consequences to
argue their anti-war positions. Kim Bussey 'O4 introduced
the purpose of the rally. "It is imperative that people who
believe that this proposed force is not only unjust but
uncomfortable must do everything in their individual
power to express their dissent and allow the world and our
government to know that we will organize in every way
possible against this war," she said.
History professor Marjorie Murphy was one of many
speakers who argued that the United States has no right to
use military action because Iraq is only "believed to have
weapons of mass destruction." She proposed alternatives
to violence, such as sending diplomats and inspectors.
Murphy also spoke about the negative response she
received when she wrote to her congressman and urged
him to vote against military action. "I think it's time for
our House of Representatives to go back to school and
study the Constitution of the United States," she said.
"That Constitution recognizes their responsibility as our
representatives to at least voice our concerns."
Anthropology professor Farha Ghannam added to
Murphy's comments by pointing out that "the war will only

breed hatred." Though Ghannam disapproves of Saddam
Hussein's policies, she opposes the war because ofher concern for the Iraqi people. She commented that many countries throughout the world, even Kuwait, oppose the war.
Ghannam stated that the United States is "a. privileged but
small minority of the [the world's] population."
Sue Edwards of Delaware County Wage Peace and
Justice expressed hope. "We can just as well see this as a
time of, if not victory yet, at least of success," she said. IRS
urged students to band together and to show their support
in a variety of ways. . She noted that the number of votes
against military action was much higher than expected,
that the president had to "soften" the bill in order to get it
passed and that many citizens are protesting the war.
Spanish professor Aurora Camacho de Schmidt further
encouraged the audience. "We are powerful together," she
said.
Throughout the rally, speakers informed the audience of

upcoming protests in Washington and Philadelphia. They
asked students to write to their congressmen and to use
nonviolent forms of civil disobedience to protest the war in
Iraq. Listeners were invited to sign an anti-war petition
that had been circulated throughout Tri-Co. Spencer Witt of
Pin for Peace reminded the audience, "It doesn't take a special person to use the voice [he/she is] given."
Bob Smith, a representative of Brandywine Peace
Community, urged students to sign the "Iraq Pledge of
Resistance," a document being signed by people nationwide to express their commitment to protesting the war.
"In signing the Iraq Pledge of Resistance, we are saying
that over our bodies, over our dreams, over our lives, over
our hopes will this war proceed!" Smith said. "You are the
law. You are the power. You are the democracy."

October 3% 2002

The speeches were interspersed with songs from the
Octavists, a progressive a cappella group, as well as cheers
from the Swarthmore Radical Cheerleaders. In their songs,
the Octavists used lyrics such as "We're going to stand up
for liberty" and "We're going to stop war before it starts."
The acappella group even engaged the audience in a singalong of an anti-war version of "Down by the Riverside."
The Radical Cheerleaders, a group formed last year,
performed cheers such as "Sanctions in Iraq, we ain't
down with that" and "Hell no, we won't go, we won't fight

for Texaco."
The Swarthmore Progressive Action Coalition (SPAC)
organized the rally, which coincided with a nationwide
week of action against military action in Iraq. Bussey, a
member of SPAC, shared her feelings concerning the war.
"Unilateral military action is absolutely unacceptable and
unprecedented for the U.5.," she said. "I don't see how
we're helping. It has more to do with oil interests than
with the welfare of the Iraqi people."
Another organizer, Al Bradbury 'O5, believed that the
rally helped to "build anti-war energy on campus" and that
it was a "good tool for inspiring people and reminding
them that they're not alone."
Registrar Martin Warner, who attended the rally, sympathized with the speakers. "Not only is war simply
wrong," he said, "I'm very concerned that making war
against Iraq would cause them to react with extreme defensiveness, including the use of weapons of mass destruction
and setting fire to the oil wells, etc. Even if somehow we
could win overnight without firing a shot, such a victory
would still destabilize the region in a terrible way, almost
certainly bringing more danger to Israel and the U.S. The
entire project is loaded with potential failure."

Earthlust and ITS join to fight paper waste from printers

for each printout. Although large
schools have seen 20-40 percent reductions in printing
after implementing these systems, ITS believes it is not
appropriate for a small school like Swarthmore.
One reason for this is that the mixed Macintosh/PC
environment is Hot compatible with most of the printer
control systems. Also, the systems are very expensive.
Last year, ITS spent around $23,500 to stock the printers.
Jacobsen explained that the hardware and software
required to implement a printer control system alone
would cost over $47,000. "[These systems] are very expensive for the amount of solution you're getting," she said.
Swarthmore, however, is not alone in its struggle to

On an average day, the public printers on campus consume over 2,100 pages of paper. Many of those printouts
are never picked up and end up in the trash.
In the coming weeks, Information Technology
Services (ITS) is planning to launch a resource conservation campaign in collaboration with Earthlust. As
Manager of Client Services, Robin Jacobsen said, "We
want to make students more aware about paper waste on
campus and thus decrease the amount of waste and print-

ing."
The centerpiece of this campaign is an online printer
tracker, located at http://printers.swarthmore.edu. The
tracke" tells how many pages are printed from all
Swarthmore campus printers, with the exception of two
Apple Laser Writer printers located in Woolman and
Parrish. The tracker program is a modified version of the
script Whitman College in Washington state uses to
track its printers.
According.to Jacobsen, ITS looked into various printer control systems over the past spring and summer.
These systems help control printer usage by either allocating a specific amount of printouts per person or

reduce rising paper and toner usage. Many smaller institutions have not implemented printer control systems
but are looking for ways to reduce waste.
As Whitman College has found out, one inexpensive
way to do so is to simply educate the students about
resource conservation. Also, in light of the success of
their less expensive printer-tracker system, Whitman

officials chose to share the technology with other institutions at a conference. Now, Swarthmore is trying make
use of this technology.
Carr Everbach, advisor for Earthlust, offered some
encouraging data on how raised student awareness can

truly effect change. Swarthmore is currently participating in a "Rush to Recycle" contest sponsored by the
Department of Environmental Protection, she said.
Beginning on October 7, Earthlust put up signs around
campus to encourage and educate people about recycling. In the two weeks following October 7, there was an
increase of 40 percent in the amount of recycled
paper/cardboard. The amount of glass, plastic and aluminum dropped into recycling bins on campus in those
two weeks was nearly double the figure for the two preceding weeks. This news is encouraging to ITS, which is
hoping to achieve a 20 percent decrease in resource
waste through education.
Over the next few weeks, Earthlust will launch their
campaign against printer paper waste with posters that
encourage double-sided printing and raise general
awareness about paper waste.
As Jacobsen admitted, a campaign to raise student
awareness is generally not as effective at reducing waste
as a stricter control system. Everbach, however, noted
we're
that "it's not only about the amount of waste
training students to be good citizens. The most important
thing is that when [students] go off into society, they can

have the heightened environmental awareness and
their power to make an impact."

Beer is healthier than milk, PETA says
BY JENNIFER SMALL
The Daily Free Press (Boston U.)
(U-WIRE) BOSTON Regardless of what
People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals claims, beer does not "Do a body
good," according to Boston University
Clinical Assistant Professor Joan SalgeBlake.
Salge-Blake said low-fat milk or skim
milk provides an excellent source of calcium and vitamin D, which are especially
important for college students to consume
as their bones continue to grow. She said
while milk is a good source of protein and
rich in nutrients, the same cannot be said
about beer.
"There are no ways in which beer is
healthier than milk," Salge-Blake said.
Although PETA pulled their "Got
Beer?" campaign two years ago, after
groups such as Mothers Against Drunk
-

Driving said the ads were irresponsible,
they have re-instituted it on college cam-

puses across the nation. Dan Shannon, the
Vegan Outreach Coordinator for PETA,

said PETA does not mean to anger MADD,
but said he believes the organization mis-

interprets the advertisements.
"We respect MADD very

much,"

Shannon said. "We just don't think they
understand our message. It isn't a proalcohol campaign, we are simply using
beer as a metaphor to inform people to
how bad milk is."
However, Salge-Blake disagreed with
even having the two beverages in the
same sentence.
"[Milk and beer] shouldn't even be
compared," said Salge-Blake, who is also
the Dietetic Internship Director. "They
have nothing in common except that they
are both liquids."
However, Shannon said beer and milk
made an "interesting comparison."
"We hope that this campaign will make
people think 'Wait a minute, that can't be
right. Beer is better for you than milk?'
and then research it, and realize that it
really is true," Shannon said.
However, Salge-Blake responded to the
statement, saying PETA was only compar-

ing it using facts that were beneficial to
their claim.
"PETA seems to be saying that because

milk has some fat and beer has none
means beer is better than milk," SalgeBlake said. "But beer is full of calories,
and all calories in excess will make you
gain weight; any time you consume more
calories than you burn off, you will gain

weight."
Though PETA is not yet running ads at
BU, Shannon said he was sure they would
soon, as the goal of the campaign is to
reach all of the major universities.
"We think particularly college students
need to understand that milk is dangerous, to health, cows and the environment," Shannon said. "Obviously we are
not saying that people should replace milk
with beer. We don't think that people are
going to start drinking beer with breakfast as a result of our campaign."
"Beer in moderation is good for you,
while even one glass of milk supports animal abuse and harms your health,"
according to Bruce Friedrich, PETA's

responsibly," he said. "The same can't be
said of milk."
Shannon admitted beer did not have

some of the nutrients that were available
to students in milk.
"Of course, milk does have things that
beer doesn't, but milk doesn't have anything in it that you can't get elsewhere,"
Shannon said.
He suggested fortified soy milk, which
he said has all of the protein and calcium
of dairy milk, as a substitute for cow's

milk.
PETA said they used this information
in order to aid their initiative to get people to stop consuming animal products.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans,
set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
said one of the most important elements of
a healthy diet is calcium. By consuming
enough calcium now, children and
teenagers can lower their risk of developing osteoporosis and fragile bones later in
life, according to the USDA.

Study says sperm fights depression among college women
"Archives of Sexual Behavior," has received mixed reac-

BY ANDY MCKIM
Washington Square News (New York U.)

tions.

(U-WIRE) NEW YORK-Semen may be a natural
"upper" and its effect may be addictive, according to a
recent study of sexually active college women.
The study, conducted at the State University of New
York at Albany, found that women having sex without
condoms were less depressed than those using them.
Researchers asked 293 undergraduate females how
often they had sex, the type of contraception used and the
number of days since they last had sex. Results revealed
that depression levels increased with the frequency of
the subjects' condom use.
"I wouldn't use the word 'addictive,' but sex without a
condom is definitely better," said Paula, a New York
University graduate student who declined to give her
last name. "You feel much more connected to the person
you're with emotionally. Skin on skin just feels so much

smoother."
Professor Gordon Gallup, who headed the research
project, said although the exact cause of the antidepressant effect was not clear, it has been proven that semen
is absorbed through the vaginal walls.
Semen contains testosterone, estrogen and other hormones with the potential to affect mood and sexual
behavior, he said.
"If the results could be proven, I suppose some
attempt should be made to try to isolate and simulate the
antidepressant effect," Gallup said, but added later that
he was not concerned with practical applications of the
study.
The study, published in the June issue of the

Dr. Ira Sharlip, a urologist in San Francisco and president of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America,
criticized the study in an article published on Salon.com.

"This is the kind of junk science that
smears the name of honest science."
Dr. Ira Sharlip
"This is the kind of junk science that smears the name
of honest science," Sharlip wrote.

Student critics were quick to point out the dangers of
unprotected sex.
"We were raised watching after-school specials
informing us about the dangers of AIDS and the importance of wearing a condom, not to mention STDs and
unwanted pregnancies," said Sarah, a performing arts
major at NYU who declined to give her last name. "I'm
not saying I've never done it, but the fact that there are
so many students having sex without condoms is scary."
Gallup said it was not his intention to promote sex
without a condom.
"Condom use was the only way we could isolate the
effect of semen. I have no control over the media. I just
try to represent the facts," Gallup said. "My general
impression is that students today think having unprotected sex is like driving a car. Everybody thinks car
accidents happen to other people until they're in one."

Although few NYU students questioned the uplifting
effects of sex, some questioned the cause.
"I feel noticeably better about life after having sex,
with or without condoms," Paula said. "I attribute this to
the release of sexual tension between my boyfriend and
I. And the pleasure of orgasm, of course."
Gallup said the study did not measure the positive
effects of sex, but isolated the presence and effect of

semen.
Results of the survey also linked the effects of semen
and depression to suicide rates among sexually active
females. The study reported that while 28.9 percent of

women who "usually" use condoms have attempted suicide, only 7.4 percent who use them "sometimes" and 4.5
percent of sexually active women who never use condoms have attempted suicide.
But only 13.2 percent of those who said they always
used condoms said they have attempted suicide.
The authors said the study also provides indirect evidence suggesting that the antidepressant effect of semen
may be addictive.
Subjects who said they never used condoms reported
having sex almost twice as frequently as those who
always wore condoms and were likely to have "rebound

sex" sooner than women who used condoms.
"Sex is my drug, and it's definitely addictive," said an
undergraduate student who would identify herself only
as Amy. "This [study] just proves it."
Researchers are currently preparing an intensive follow-up study using a larger group of students.
"I would be troubled and surprised if we received different results after conducting the same study using
NYU students," Gallup said.

Swarthmore police report
•On Saturday, Oct. 26 at 10:37 p.m., Officer Kline
observed numerous juveniles in the vicinity of College

Avenue and North Chester Road blocking the roadway on '
College Avenue. He advised them to clear the roadway and
stayed on location to keep the roadway clear. While there
he was approached by a person who stated there was a
juvenile in the social hall causing a disturbance. As Officer
Kline entered the hall he observed the juvenile acting disorderly and screaming profanities. Upon approaching the
individual he detected a strong odor of intoxicants. Officer
Kline instructed the individual to calm down and he
attempted to get her identification at which time she
attempted to leave the area. Officer Kline instructed her to
stop. She refused, and as he attempted to restrain her she
turned and punched the officer in the left shoulder. She
was instructed to go back inside the hall and the officer
grasped both her wrists, at which time she bit the officer's
right ring finger. The officer requested assistance from several chaperones on location. Other officers arrived and the
offender was led to the police car still screaming profanities. As they approached the police vehicle the juvenile
bent over and bit Officer Kline's right wrist. She was then
placed on the ground, handcuffed, placed in the vehicle
and transported to the police station. While at the station
she removed the handcuffs twice, kicked and again bit the
officer. Her identity was established and parents contacted. A parent arrived and the juvenile was released to the
parent's custody at 12:11 a.m. The juvenile is being
charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly
endangering another person, resisting arrest, underage
drinking, and disorderly conduct. The officer did not require
medical treatment.

DUDE, WHERE'S

From the sound of it, cell phones are

on the other end of the line. That's happened to him before, several times.
Smith carries his phone with him
everywhere and typifies the bold style of
cell phone use brought to campus this year,
primarily by freshmen.
He keeps his phone on while he eats in
Sharpies, and he will drop a dinner conversation to take a call. Before finishing his
food, he will pick up the phone again to see
which of his friends are back in their
rooms. "Why would I walk all the way up
there when I can call them from Sharpies?"
He can't think of any place he wouldn't
take his cell. "Maybe if I were in a meeting
with a professor I'd turn it off," he said.
While studying in McCabe, Smith sets
his ringer to vibrate. Somehow, even that
soft noise grabs his attention. "It's some
special connection I have with my cell
phone," Smith suggested. Last week, a call
woke him while napping under a desk on
the top floor of the library, ending his
break from art history reading.
Some people tell him his attachment to

his phone is unnecessary, but Smith disagrees. He calls his phone a tool. "It's not a
status symbol or anything else," he said.

Gigone,

Pennsylvania, doesn't own a cell phone,
and is surprised to see how common they
have become. "No one had cell phones in
my high school." she said. "No one."
Yet Christina Procacci 'O6 didn't even
consider going without a cell phone at college. It's all about convenience, she said.
She'll need a cell phone to go into Philly.
And she wouldn't want her high school
friends to have to learn a new phone number for her. Almost everyone had a cell
phone at Procacci's South Jersey high
school. She's had hers for over two years,
and spends about three hours a week using

it.
Nationwide, cell phone ownership is at
69 percent among college students, according to a Harris Interactive market research
study conducted this spring.
Many from the class of 'O6 grew accustomed to carrying a cell phone during high
school. "It was part of the culture. Probably
everyone had one," Rachel Clark 'O6 said.
"I wouldn't call my friends at their house. I
would just call their cell phones."
Yet a number of students used to being
surrounded by cell phones abandoned
theirs before heading to campus, including
Clark. "I know I don't need one here. For
the most part we stay on campus during

SPEAKING VOLUMES:
Noise/music excursions
As a strong believer in hearing protection and someone whose
ears are among his most prized possessions, I am often frustrated by the prevailing trends in the performance of popular
music with regards to volume.
It's rare that I'll feel comfortable staying long
at a concert without wearing my earplugs, and
even then I sometimes find that the noisiness of
the performance as a whole will obscure some of
its more nyanced elements. Most distressing is
the knowledge that the vast majority of concertgoers, and even many musicians, use no hearing
protection at all. It's an issue I've debated with
many people, especially my own bandmates my
conviction that rock concerts, as a whole, are
unnecessarily loud.

That said, it's true that everything has its

place, and there's no getting around the fact that
some music just needs to be loud, especially

when it's live. Recent releases of albums by two
of the noisiest live bands I've witnessed have
given me an opportunity to reflect on the curious
relationship between recording and live per-

formance, specifically the role that volume plays
in that relationship. A simpie example is the case of

fully delivers that sonic onslaught, when played

begins with the first track, "Spiritual Healing" a few seconds of some pleasant Debussy-esque
piano playing, and then the assault: screeches

Even as your eardrums cry out in anguish, it's
hard to miss the fact that this tune is damn
catchy, like that "My Bloody Valentine" song. A
fantastic way to open an album.

Skeleton Key are a violent band. They do have
a mellower side (the goofy "Roost in Peace" and
semi-sweet "Candy"), but their strengths are
most evident on angular crunchers like
"Kerosene" and "One Way, My Way." Their
uniqueness, which is sadly underemphasized on
this record, is most apparent in performance:
their judicious employment of found-object percussion in the production of their meticulous
funk. In the context of performance, the music on
"Obtanium" is far more fully realized, but even
on the album it offers a substantial array of tuneful noise for those willing to listen past some of
the big guitars and inanities. Ultimately, if this
is a record about noise, it's something more subtle than just volume.
When it comes to volume in live performance,
few can rival the lately-feted experimental hiphop outfit Dalek. As many of you who have seen

As Senior Company prepares to perform "Mineola Twins" later this semester, cast members explain what it takes to put together a production, from casting to costumes.

A portrait of a production as a young play
With two twins named Myra and Myrna, sno-cones and buddies, and costumes out of
the pages of Vogue this year's Senior Company production should be an interesting one.
The capstone. The end. For theater majors, the required Senior Company class is the
culmination of years of work in the theatre department.
It occurs first semester of the senior year and involves the production of a play to be

BY ELIZABETH COLLINS

ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

The spring of junior year is when the grueling process
begins. Everyone involved in Senior Company, including
both theater majors and minors, meets to look at plays
together. The company begins production at the beginning
of the fall semester. This year the company decided to hold
open auditions to fill the roles not occupied by Senior
Company actors.
While their task is difficult, they are provided with a certain amount of help: theatre professor Lee Devin is the faculty advisor for the company this year.
This year's Senior Company includes Kate Nelson-Lee,
Jessica Nakamura, Elizabeth Nolte, Elizabeth Zimmerman,
Petar Lazarevic, Emine Fisek and Erica Cartmill. The show
the company members are producing is Paula Vogel's
"Mineola Twins." The show follows two twin sisters, Myra
and Myrna, through three decades of the 20th century and is
ablaze with political substance. Using the issues of the
Eisenhower, Nixon, and Bush, Sr. administrations, the play
examines the twins' relationship as they diverge to opposite
sides of the political spectrum.
"We chose this play because it was different from the
other works we had reviewed." Nolte said. "It provided a
great challenge, not only in the acting, but in every facet of
the show's production. It was funny, over-the-top and dis-

tinct."
The directors emphasize that "Mineola Twins" is more
than a play; it's a social commentary. "It talks about how our
society functions, each decade talks about the politics relevant in that particular period of time," co-director NelsonLee said. "One of the reasons we chose it is because of all the
politics: conservative versus liberal, abortion, lesbianism,

performed at the end of the semester. All theatre majors must participate, while theatre
minors may petition to be a part of the class.
This article is the first in a series that will examine what goes into the production of a
Senior Company show. It will focus on that frightening, tentative time at the beginning of
the process: from selecting a play to auditions to the first shaky week of rehearsal.

the gay lifestyle
even drugs are briefly discussed."
With three actresses and only one actor in the company
and a campus that tends to produce more female auditioners
than male, the strong female roles in "Mineola Twins" were
also a factor in its selection.
After picking the play, company members began the
process of auditioning, difficult considering the complex
structure of the play. "In each decade there are two scenes,
one with Myra and one with Myrna, as well as a dream
sequence that follows each decade," Nelson-Lee said. "There

were no set rules about each character. The characters exist

both in reality and in the dream sequences, so their roles are
'fuzzy.' This made it especially hard to cast a particular person for a part whose boundaries were blurred."
In the end, only four parts were to be cast, and the company chose four able Swatties to fill them. Kate Hurster 'O3,
Sam Dingman 'O4, Ben Camp 'O5 and Hannah Harvester 'O5
will join fellow "outsider" Cyndi Leger 'O3, the production's
stage manager, and the members of the Senior Company in
producing "Mineola Twins."
However, Senior Company does not like to call the additional actors "outsiders," preferring the affectionate term
"buddies." The members of the Senior Company are therefore called, logically, "sno-cones." (Nelson-Lee says that
Senior Company, when shortened to SN CO, well, "looked
like sno-cone" to her.)
The first rehearsal consisted of the actors reading "the
entire play in their characters, as directors and designers

watched.

"Nervousness turned into excitement as we were reading
through the play at the first rehearsal," Nolte said. "We got
to know the outside actors and their performing style as well
as the challenges we would have to face together."
Following the first rehearsal, the rest of the first week

October 31, 2002

consisted of table work, getting to know the characters the
actors would have to become for the next semester through
discussion and readings. This helped the actors, buddies and
sno-cones together, to grasp the nature of the play and what
it would require of them. The cast spent about an hour on
each of the three dream sequences. Forty-five minutes of
that hour consisted of tearing apart the meaning of the characters.
A particularly difficult aspect of this show is the design
for both costume and set. Designer Erica Cartmill found the
show to be challenging but also quite exciting.
"Design was certainly one aspect of the play-selecting
process," Cartmill said. "We knew we didn't have the budget to do a huge 'cast of thousands' Egyptian epic play, but we
also wanted to make the design interesting and challenging.
It is a fun show, particularly in its costume design. The halfreal, half-dream premise of the show allowed me room to
explore my costume-designing creativity."
After the company picked the show, Cartmill began
research on costumes and sets during the summer.
"I looked at a lot of old Vogues from each time period to
determine what people were 'supposed' to wear," she said.
"From the pictures, I extrapolated what I thought normal
people of the time would actually wear. I also studied the
architecture of the time period, getting a sense of what a normal setting of the time period would look like. The Internet
certainly provided a wide range of research opportunities
for both costume and set design. I was able to find old family photos from the time periods and other personal docu-

ments."

They've chosen the play. They've cast the actors. They've
met and begun rehearsal. They've researched design. Now

all that's left are months and months of arduous rehearsal
and a few performances on Dec. 6, 7 and 8.

It's 40 degrees and raining outside.
You've been killed by your "ASSassin,"
and you've watched your copy of "The
Princess Bride" so many times that
your roommate has threatened to
throw it out the window if you jump on

Montoyo revenge sequence once
more.
You know that your only hope lies in
the flood of terrific movies that
Hollywood guarantees us every fall to

that is their summer selection.
But how to pick from among them,

Note: neither of Leonardo

there is no reason to make a big deal
about them.

frenetic "Run Lola Run" and its surreal, lyrical follow-up "The Princess and
the Warrior." Starring Cate Blanchett,
and it's out in theaters now.

9) "Frida"
Starring Selma Hayek. A biopic
about who else? Frida Kahlo, for
which the lead actress apparently
grew a unibrow and even a faint mustache, a risk on par with the 20 lbs.
Renee Zellweger gained for "Bridget
Jones."
8) "Harry Potter and the Chamber
of Secrets"
So the first movie was less than
thrilling and "Chamber of Secrets" is
the weakest book of the series. That's
no reason not to see the sequel to the
second most successful movie of all
time. You'd see "Titanic II" wouldn't
you? (see Note, above.)

7) "Love in the Time of Money"
Undistinguished by big-name stars

or a well-known director, it looks like
an intriguing character drama featuring reliables Steve Buscemi, Carol
Kane, and Michael Imperioli from "The
Sopranos."

6) "8 Mile"
Otherwise known as "The Eminem
Movie." Director Curtis Hanson's ("LA.
Confidential," "Wonder Boys") film
about the rough life of a rough young
rapper starring the roughest of young
white rappers is the definition of meta.
What kind of Swatties would you be if
you missed it?
5) "Analyze That"
Another sequel, and one that could
easily flop. But the original was funny,
and this one's penned and directed by

the man who made "Ghostbusters II" fly,
4) "About Schmidt"

Jack Nicholson's latest project, which
won raves at Cannes. There's no love
interest half his age, just a story crafted
by the writer of "Citizen Ruth" and
"Election" and co-star support in the
form of Kathy Bates.
3) "Adaptation"
"Being John Malkovich" geniuses
Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman
reunite on another surreal postmodern
head-trip, this time starring Nicholas
Cage and Meryl Streep. Veterans John

Cusack and Catharine Keener assist.
2) "25th Hour"
Spike Lee's latest, the story of white,
rich New Yorker Edward Norton's last
night of freedom before a seven-year jail
term.
1) "Lord of the Rings: The Two
Towers"
Come on, if you're only going to buy
into one franchise, which deserves your
support more? The first LOTR film warranted 13 Oscar nods. This one continues under the watchful eye of the brilliant Peter Jackson.

Honorable mentions: Denzel
Washington's directorial debut, "The
Antwone Fisher Story;" Rebecca Miller's
character drama "Personal Velocity;"
and "Treasure Planet," the huge-budget

animated take on "Treasure Island," fea-

turing the voices of Emma Thompson

The day the
live music died
Several days ago, Swatties were greeted with
a surprise reserved-students e-mail entitled,
"OLDE CLUB'S LAST SHOW OF THE SEMESTER." We checked our planners. We racked our
brains. Unless daylight-savings time had carried
us two months forward instead of one hour back,
it was still October: almost exactly mid-semester. Was it possible that our one campus venue
for off-campus live music was shutting down for
the duration?
This unusual predicament presents a couple
of issues. First of all, the problem is not that
there were not enough Olde Club shows this
semester; throughout the first two months, the
shows were packed in, sometimes with more
than one show in a week.
Apparently, the organizers of Olde Club
thought they could squeeze in all the entertainment in the first few weeks of the semester, leaving the final stretch of paper-writing time free
from the temptations to procrastinate that live
music offers.

Not only is such a schedule ridiculous on a
strict attendance level (most people are not
going to attend more than one Olde Club concert
in one week), it goes against the way Swat operates. Since this campus is not exactly Live Music
Central, we need to space out what "celebrities"
we get, maximizing the chances of people actually going to see them. Besides, the crazy second
halfof the semester necessitates more in the way
of entertaining distraction, not less.
Maybe we would have opted to go to more
Olde Club concerts in September if we knew
that, come November, the opportunity would
vanish. Or, even better, we could have expressed
our irritation with Olde Club's crazy schedule
before it was too late to change.

Mailing the votes
As Swarthmore students, an amazing mosaic
of different national and regional identities who
take politics seriously, we respectfully submit
that those of you who happen to hail from
Delaware County, Pennsylvania don't know how
lucky you are.
Election season is a very irritating time to
come from out of state. Not even touching the
issue of elections in other countries, the absentee ballot system within our own great country
is the most annoyingly tangled ball of bureaucratic red tape most of us have had to deal with

since writing college applications.
Frankly, we're all busy people, and the majority of us have decided to take on the challenge of
attending school out-of-state. The deadline to

apply for an absentee ballot is usually quite
early, and whenever there's some sort of election
snafu (Toricelli's resignation, Wellstone's death)
we're the ones who have to scramble to fill out
new ballots or else lose our votes. Frustrated students often give up and just don't vote.
In an electronic age where local ballot and
registration information is available nation-

wide, there's no reason there can't be a national
absentee ballot system. We could make blank
ballots available at local polling places that
could be coded in to stand for local ballots across
the nation or even an electronic voting system
over the Web. Since so many commercial, legal
and private personal interactions already take

place over long distances, it's hard to maintain
that it would be, impossible to implement a sensible, secure and convenient absentee voting
system that doesn't make us do all the work.

When recycling, go for Chalkings may deter coming out
efficiency, not quantity
BY KATIE DAVENPORT
kdavenpl@swarthmore.edu

A recent Phoenix opinions column claimed that "recycling is
something all of us can do every day
to make the world a better place."
Though this statement is well-intentioned, it would be foolish to take it
at face value without considering a
very serious question: Why are we
recycling?
Any good Swattie will tell you
that recycling helps to save the
planet by decreasing pollution, preserving natural resources and stimulating the economy. While there is
RANDY GOLDSTEIN
some truth to these arguments, it
must be noted that simply encourBursting the Bubble aging people to recycle more may
actually be counter-productive.
In fact, the premier challenge set
forth by recycling advocates should not be more recycling. It
should be more efficient recycling.
Economist A. Clark Wiseman has calculated that America's
garbage output for the next 1000 years would fill a square landfill
35 miles long on each side and 100 yards deep. In his influential
work "Recycling is Garbage," John Tierney notes that this is less
than one-tenth of one percent of the current open space used for
grazing in the United States.
While I by no means advocate reckless wastefulness in order
to see this monstrous trash heap become a reality, it must be
realized that there is plenty of room in this country for waste
that is not recycled.
As with any endeavor, the benefits of recycling are only relevant when its costs are also taken into account. One could make
the simple argument that recycling paper saves trees.
Superficially, it might seem that producing a given amount of
recycled paper would save the trees otherwise needed to produce
that paper. This line of reasoning neglects the fact that the vast
majority of trees used in paper manufacturing are planted for
exactly that purpose.
Producers harvest and replant trees only to fulfill paper
demand. Were the demand for new paper made of raw wood pulp
to drop, as might be a result of a surge in paper recycling, the
incentives for those producers to harvest and replant could
diminish to a point where the aggregate number of trees in the
United States actually declines.
It is also interesting to note the corollary of this concept: an
increase in demand for new, non-recycled paper would entice
paper producers to increase the size of their tree crops and new
producers to plant new forests altogether.
In a free market, beneficial recycling will occur if its implementation offers economic incentives. That is, producers will
use recycled inputs if they are less costly than new ones. One of
the most recycled materials in the United States is steel, yet one
rarely sees an environmentalist making a fuss over the number
of cars wasting our valuable junkyard space.
Rather, the steel industry itself, through secondhand dealers
and factories that produce solely recycled steel, ensures a constant cycle of steel renewal. This process occurs because it is economically feasible for all parties and can occur naturally and
efficiently without dangerous outside intervention.
Another example is the recycling of aluminum cans. Half of
the United States' aluminum cans are recycled every year because
that process uses only a tiny fraction of the energy necessary to
produce new cans. Steel and aluminum recycling are well integrated into our economy because they make good economic sense.
As recycling technology continues to improve, recycled
inputs will become cheaper and manufacturers will have greater
incentives to implement them in favor of new raw materials. It
would thus be more prudent for environmentalists to work to
improve the recycling industry's efficiency than to aggrandize
its scale.
Instead of ignoring basic economic truths, a better approach
on their part would recognize the realities of the free market and
work within its context to promote the ecological goals in which
they believe. The supposed problem of recycling should spawn
ethical and philosophical debate.
In its current state, however, it is prone to criticism from logical rather than moral grounds. For environmentalists to repair
these economic fallacies and steer their efforts in a more sensible direction would be in the best interest of all parties, including our planet.

Most of the Swarthmore community is dedicated,
at least nominally, to acceptance and support of all
people. Coming Out Week is one such demonstration
of that commitment. We reach out to those questioning their sexual and/or gender identity and let them
know that they will be accepted and celebrated for
who they are.
I am concerned, however, by the fact that many of
the outward manifestations of Coming Out Week,
specifically the chalk-

ings,

seem

what being queer is all about, so to speak
largely
through these chalkings.
It is important that their first experience with the
queer community be as welcoming and supportive as
possible. I fear that the large number of sexually
explicit chalkings and the relatively small number
relating to the experiences of people coming out may

result in the alienation of those whom we most need
to support.

There is also the unfortunate fact that some Of the

chalkings have created a backlash. Some people
offended by the chalkings are applying their disgust
to the entire queer community. Anyone

more

acceptance,

tion or even coming

freedom is an impor-

tant and worthy goal,

and one that may well
deserve a day or week
of its own. However, I
question the wisdom of presenting it as equivalent to

coming out.
Coming out can be about fearlessly celebrating
who you are, whom you love, and, for some, what
you like to do with them. I wholeheartedly support
those who celebrate; we are truly fortunate to live in

a time and place where we can do this.
However, there are those who are not yet ready to
celebrate. Sadly, coming out can also mean losing
the love of a family member, facing physical violence
from classmates, or dealing with fear and selfhatred. This side of coming out is harder to express
in a succinct and witty chalking.
Because they are so visible, the chalkings are the
only exposure many people have to the queer community on campus.
Young people who have never met another queer
person may learn what the queer community is

happening on campus.
This too may make

closeted kids more reluctant to come out. A young

a hostile community.
I do not advocate the abolition of sexually explicit chalkings or suggest that queer people should
present a "cleaned-up" image of themselves to avoid
offending anyone.
However, I would like to ask those involved in
organizing Coming Out Week to think hard about
the effects their actions have on those who do not yet
feel comfortable joining them.
to straight
In addition, I want to emphasize
allies and to homophobes, to the queer community
and to kids still in the closet
that the sexually
explicit chalkings do not represent all queer people.
It is possible to be queer without identifying as a pervert, a deviant or a butt pirate.
As we celebrate our pride, we must make sure we
remain supportive of those still struggling to feel
proud.

What hurt me were not the expressions of sexual

Nonviolence meant respecting and embracing all
those who would oppress them, let alone those who
already supported them. To alienate their supporters
by acts of insensitivity would have quickly dissolved
their movements, not to mention any hopes offuture
support.
Some of the activism surrounding Coming Out

As a student activist myself, I support the need
for a Coming Out Week here on campus. Yet, when
reading some of the writings on the walkways

Jesus is disrespected.
The second statement damages the college's
image by giving visitors a poor impression of the
"ethical intelligence" Al Bloom often proposes as one
of the outstanding features of a Swarthmore education. Both statements, like many etched along the
walkways, make me ashamed to be a student here.
More importantly, both statements give Swat a
bad name: one for its insensitivity to the beliefs of
others, the other for its sexual forcefulness. In light

of such statements, we would do well to reevaluate
our activism in terms of its sensitivity, bearing in

mind the nonviolent, sensitive activism practiced by
Parks, King and Gandhi.

Questioning objectives
behind "regime change"
Our nation has gradually
been acquiring a new vocabulary, one that includes words
like
"misunderestimated"
and "war on terror." One
phrase that is being tossed
around with increased frequency is "regime change."
Our government wants to see
regime change everywhere
from Iraq to Palestine to

Venezuela. It has now become
our official policy to "change"
every leader that annoys us. I
say "annoys" because that
appears to be the extent of
our consistent criteria.
Our government is trying
to get rid of Saddam Hussein,

allegedly because he poses a
threat to the United States.
Oh yeah, and because he's evil. It is true that

with our help
Saddam Hussein has killed many Kurds. He apparently didn't
get the memo that only our ally Turkey is allowed to kill
Kurds.
If we went to war every time our government helped a foreign leader massacre civilians, however, we wouldn't have
the time or resources to pursue anything else. Another argument is that Saddam Hussein is a dictator (an evil one). As
opposed to whom? Our pal Musharraf? Our authoritarian

A story of deceit, love, and

In honor of the fact
that we don't do homework, Tuesday nights
are officially bowling
nights. Last Tuesday,

JONATHAN FOMBONNE
EMILIANO RODRIGUEZ
Sobering Thoughts

after bowling our usual
250+, we decided it was
time to visit the infamous
establishment
that provides so many
Swatties with the added
calories we need to keep
us warm during the
winter:
Acapulco's.
Now as we all know,
Acapulco is in Mexico,

so it is beyond us why
anyone would ever call
a pizza place that, espewith
cially
Italian
sounding competition like Renato's and Appetito's.
However, after our visit, we soon realized that there is
more to marketing than just a name. The tale of
Acapulco Pizza is one of dramatic proportions.
It was a rainy night. Actually, it wasn't, but it
sounds cooler that way. So yeah, we pulled up to
Acapulco Pizza at about midnight and were surprised
at how small it looked. We entered and were greeted by
two cops waiting for their orders and three delivery
guys. Soon enough, the owner, seeing the size of
Emiliano's belly, emerged from behind the counter and
turned on the charm. Seeing that we were from Swat,
one of his two biggest centers of business (along with
Widener), he allowed us to get a student special even
though it was after 11 p.m. While we waited, he ran us
through a brief history of Acapulco's, and it was one of
the most fascinating tales of David and Goliath that we
had ever heard. Even though we have only had the
privilege to be on the Acapulco delivery circle for
about a year, it has actually been open for 18 years. The
owner, who is a talkative Arabic middle-aged man, had
the idea of expanding to Swarthmore after hearing of
the success of Appetito's on our campus. In fact, the
owner of Appetito's delivered pizzas for Acapulco for 8

years, until his uncle gave him some money and he
opened up his own pizza place. However our new friend
has no qualms about the competition. For years, he has
been shutting them out with his low prices. Our friend
gains satisfaction out of the fact that the he crushed
four pizza places within his vicinity, including multinational conglomerates like Pizza Hut and Domino's.
The best story was of his battle with a local pizza
joint across the street. Competitors were a bit frightened when Acapulco's advertised its $4.99 special, but
all assumed it was only a temporary thing. Eighteen
years later, the sign is still up. We were told that the
owner of the pizza joint across the street came over on
the last night he would be open and cursed the bastard
for keeping his prices so low. With the heart of a good
businessman, the owner of Acapulco's got his delivery
boys and went across the street to buy the tables from
his competitor's old restaurant. The tables stand proudly in Acapulco's today.
After this we were given the opportunity to see the
oven, and what an oven it was. His gas-powered, superbig pizza oven could cook a pizza in five minutes at 500
degrees Fahrenheit. Our roommate Dave tried to say it
was a lot like the ovens at Papa John's, where he
worked this summer. This insulted the Acapulco staff,
and Dave was escorted from the premises by the police
officers. On a typical Saturday night, Acapulco Pizza
delivers 600 pizzas. For Swarthmore alone, the establishment has hired 4 delivery people. They described
Willets and Wharton as the highest consumers of pizza
in other words, the fat asses on campus. As for all
you guys in Parrish, you really should try to get your
money together a little faster; they can't wait for you
all day. And by the way, our homies at Acapulco asked
us to tell you all that Parrish circle, as it stands on the
map, is the one where the VANS COME, idiots.
Acapulco Pizza saved small business. Good quality,
low prices and cutthroat business ethics kept Acapulco
alive, and its larger, more powerful competitors in the
red. It is a victory not just for Acapulco, but for every
American who aspires to live the American dream. Wow.

friends in Saudi Arabia? When Venezuelan president Hugo
Chavez was ousted by a military coup, the initial White
House reaction was: "he deserved it." It was only after being
elbowed in the ribs by international organizations that we
grudgingly condemned the coup as anti-democratic.
So in the end, it comes down to reasons like "this is the
man who tried to kill my dad," although the motives of those
who actually control foreign policy are less clear. These people may be annoyed by the fact that after all our governmentsponsored coup attempts against him (three between 1993 and
1996) Saddam is still as securely in power as he ever was.
After all, what could be more irritating than a foreign leader
who doesn't allow himself to be killed at the proper time?
There is also the question of weapons of mass destruction.
As many people have pointed out recently, we're going to war
with the country that says it has no weapons of mass destruction and is willing to allow weapons inspectors, instead of the
country that says it has lots of weapons of mass destruction
and won't allow inspectors.

Don't like the new government of

The concept of regime change is not new. In fact, it is probone of the oldest tenets of our foreign policy. Don't like
the new government of (fill in the Latin American country)?
Send in the marines. Don't want the American people to know
about it? Send in the CIA instead. What is new about our policy of regime change is that fact that our government is not
even bothering to lie about it anymore. In the past, presidents
ably

like these secret for a reason, namely that those
plans violated international law. So either international law
has changed, or we no longer care what it has to say.
Our government may be hoping that, by bringing its strategy into the open, it can convince people that regime change
through unilateral force has always been a legitimate option
under international law. Kind of like last night
I walked

into my dorm room and slammed straight into a giant fivefoot stuffed tiger that was planted squarely in front of the
doorway. "Oh, that's just Tiger," one of my roommates said
calmly, raising her eyes from her psychology reading. "You
remember Tiger." No, I did not remember Tiger. I wasn't even
aware they made stuffed animals that large. But I am sure
that I will eventually grow accustomed to this stuffed monstrosity, and cease to find it odd. In the same way, our government hopes that Americans will eventually get used to the
idea and stop asking pesky questions. And this is where the
danger lies. So if you return to your room and discover a large
jungle animal, don't let your roommates convince you that it
has always been there. Ask the questions.

Final week of play holds key to CC playoffs

With four remaining conference games, field hockey controls its postseason destiny
Unfortunately, Centennial Conference
teams have not been the Garnet Tide's

only opponent

Four games, six days, a few rainstorms,
and a season on the brink. After two
months of heated competition, the regular
season boils down to the final week of

play. Thus far, the Swarthmore Garnet
Tide have garnered a 3-2 Centennial

Conference record and an honest chance
of returning to the Centennial Conference
playoffs for the second time since the
inception of the conference playoffs in
2000. To get there, the Tide must not only
defeat their remaining opponents, including playoff-bubble teams Washington (4-1
CC) Gettysburg (2-3 CC), and Franklin &
Marshall (3-3 CC), but also hope rough
weather does not dash their hopes to qualify for the NCAA tournament.
"We have four conference games left,
and every single one of them is important," Val Marone 'O5 said. "Each win
brings us closer to the Centennial
Conference tournament."

-

inclement weather has

postponed several of their matches to late
in the season, leading to a frantic schedule
in the final week of play. In addition to
regular season matches scheduled on
Saturday and Tuesday of this week, the
Tide will likely make up two postponed
matches on Sunday and Thursday.
"We're now in the unfortunate position
of having to play back-to-back conference
games when every game counts," Kate
Nelson-Lee 'O3 said. "Luckily, we're not the
only conference team in that situation."
"[Centennial Conference's Executive
Secretary] Steve Ulrich has, for obvious
reasons, mandated that all conference
games be completed by Wednesday,"
Nelson-Lee said. "He has to get the playoff
picture settled in time for next weekend's
competition."

The final week should clear up the
muddled playoff picture. As of October
28th, eight teams are still technically in

contention for the four playoff bids. "It
comes down for everyone to these last few
games," Marone said.
Swarthmore lies squarely in the middle
of the heap, currently sitting on the final
playoff spot with a 3-2 conference record
behind frontrunners Johns Hopkins (6-1
CC) and McDaniel (5-2 CC).
If the Centennial Conference tourna-

ment cannot be completed by November
10, the regular-season top seed will represent the conference as its automatic qualifier to the NCAA tournament according to
Centennial Conference guidelines.
"We have playoffs to determine who
gets the NCAA tournament bid," Nelson-

said. "So there is a time limit
involved."
If time does expire, the Tide are out of
luck. After Saturday's 7-2 loss to topranked Johns Hopkins, the Garnet Tide
are hoping to pick up their play in the
final week of the season and surge into the
postseason. "We have been really focused
at practice. We've had a great time playing
Lee

field hockey and being a part of the team
because it's really an amazing bunch of
girls," Marone said.
Helen Leitner 'O4, who was named to
the Centennial Conference Honor Roll on
October 28th, scored the first goal of the
game on Saturday, finding the back of the
goal from an assist by fellow attacker Meg
Woodworth 'O3 eight minutes into the
game. The Blue Jays, however, responded
with four straight goals before Chelsea
Ferrell 'O5 stemmed the tide by finishing
off a corner from Katie Cloonan 'O3 and
Marone 28 minutes after Swat's first goal.
The potent JHU offense finished off Swat
in the second half, converting three goals
off of 24 shots on goal.
Despite the loss, players remained optimistic after the game. "Our offense has
been clicking lately," Marone said. "Our
defense has carried us throughout the season, and Kate [Nelson-Lee] has been amaz-

ing as well."

Swat's last stand begins this Thursday
at home against Gettysburg.

The education of a Football Expert
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

is imperative that a piece of profanity
occupies every second word when discussing football. I, as a Football Expert,

News alert: Emmitt Smith has broken
the NFL's rushing record. As a Football
Expert I can assure you that a guy running 16,728 yards over the course of
twelve years is a big deal.
How do you know, Football Expert,
you ask? Well, let's go through the numbers. We Football Experts are quantitatively oriented, after all. If you figure
there are 1,760 yards in a mile, Smith's
record is equivalent to approximately 9.5
miles, which translates to 0.002 miles a
day. 0.002 miles a day is a long way for a
NFL player to run over the course of his
career. These guys are big, after all.
Come on, it's not like you, the lowly
Football Fan, have ever run 0.002 miles in

a day.
Did I mention that it is a big deal? It's
so big a deal that I must attach my elbows
to my torso and wave my hands wildly.
As a Football Expert I have very short
arms.

Wink. You Football Fans know what
I'm talking about. The rest of you may as
well stop reading this article now. This is
a conversation between the Football
Expert and other scholars of the game.
And I am an Expert. I have been educated by some of the best in the business,
tutored in the structure of the game (4 15minute quarters yielding a total game
time of 7 hours), counseled in the complexities of the division realignment (2
conferences, 16 regions, and the use of 740
letters to name them), and alerted to the
fact that it is simply unacceptable to
taunt the opposition. Taunt is a technical

term.
I know all the technical terms. I know
the positions, too. All of them. Even the
tight end. Don't get me wrong; my education wasn't easy. I had to shop around for
teachers, true students of the game willing to impart their knowledge. Dedicated
fans who reserved Monday night for discussing offensive lines and fumbles and
challenges. Instead I settled for a bunch
of guys in Mertz who could burp really
loudly. But they were nice enough and I
was on deadline, so I figured it'd have to

do.
Between bouts with an unresponsive
pizza delivery man who insisted that the
Mertz dwellers had pulled "a goofy" the
night before and were therefore ineligible to order pizza, the burpers were at
least marginally useful in helping me
secure my position as Football Expert.
the Monday night matchup
between the Philadelphia Eagles and the
New York Giants was also only "marginBut

ally exciting" as Bobby Berman 'O4
described it, so my education was not set
back by the lack of football conversation.
In fact, I learned a lot about how to
analyze the game. First, a note on form: it

not permitted

to

use anything

stronger than "damn" to describe the
plays, but you, as a Football Fan, must
intersperse four letter words with your

slugs of beer.
Thus, if you were Tom Madore 'O6, you
would say, "Fuck that Duce. He's a piece

of shit." Then you would get up in order

to pee outside since the trip to the bathroom would exceed your 0.002 mile limit
for the day. I, as the Football Expert, with
a vested personal interest in not getting

banned from the airwaves would say,
"That was a damn fine play by the Giants
defense to intercept Duce."
Actually, I'm kidding. As a Football
Expert I know that no one would ever
describe any Giants play as "damn fine."
And, as the Football Expert, I would not
pee outside.
But please note that neither the
Football Expert nor the Football Fan com-

ments on the name Duce. Or Donovan, or
Tiki for that matter. These are taken for
granted in football.
Now that we have established the

appropriate protocol for providing game
commentary, it is necessary to address
game behavior. I am not talking about the
players. Their on-field antics are actually
completely irrelevant to the game of football, according to the members of Mertz's
Monday Night Football club.
Yes, sure, there has to be at least a little trash talk so that it seems like there's

some larger point to putting off the
physics problem set in order to watch the
game. You might hear Adam Schlossman
'O6 say, "This is the worst game, ever"
when, after three quarters neither team
has made a touchdown. You might then
hear Schlossman use the opportunity to
demonstrate the superiority of his
Pittsburgh Steelers. You might see people
throw things at Schlossman.
But as the Football Expert, I know this
is just for show. The real point of football
has nothing to do with finely executed
plays and the criticism of sloppy formations. The Mertz crew actually had very
little to say about the game itself, save
explaining to me why it was acceptable to
clip a guy out at his feet but not to call
him names afterwards ("Hyperagressive
movement is a form of affection," Jesse
Taylor 'O3 says). No, it is the human
dimensionof the game that intrigues this
lot.
It is my fellow Football Expert, ABC's
football analyst John Madden, who draws
the most attention. As more beer, "of the
highest alcohol content possible," according to Mike Pieropan 'O6, is consumed,
the crowd becomes less patient with
Madden. "He's already not making sense.
Maybe he hasn't had enough to eat,"
Scott Birney 'O6 says to a chorus of vigor-

ous head-nodding. When a football is
brought out and the guys use the ensuing

game of catch to demonstrate that machoism often overrules common sense, I
begin to slip down into my seat. As a
Football Expert, I feel a strange affinity
with John Madden, who, I am sure,
would never deliberately aim at the
sprinklers of his dorm. He wouldn't want
to waste the energy, after all.
Eventually the group tires of their

imitation of the pro-ballers, and attention
is turned to the commercials. I am
informed that advertisements are a central component of the football experience.
It is important that ads be as stupid as
possible. It is also important that they
involve scantily clad women, alcohol and
heavy machinery. The commercials that
do not include any of these components

are failures. Zach Rodd 'O6 explains the
particularly egregious example of Pepsi
Blue as a scenario involving "sucky rockers for a shitty drink."
In addition to making fun of stupid
commercials, it is important that

I, of course, am much more concerned

with the mechanics of the game than
with such trivial matters as which advertised reality series is the best, though I'm

Turf wars
Let me let you in on a little secret: I'm glad the new
turf field isn't done yet. After losing my third field
hockey game on Johns Hopkins' Homewood Field, I've
come to the realization that I'm not a turf
player. There's a little

nagging voice in my
head

aren't turf players,

either.

eight shutouts. Of the

up by the field hockey teams, two were played into
overtime or penalty strokes, while the third was over
a grass-based team in the playoffs at Homewood.
While both Hop and Muhlenberg are formidable foes,
I find it hard to believe that the surface didn't play a
partial role in our performances in the Tide's turf
games.
So we can't play on turf now, but won't having a
synthetic surface give us an edge in the conference?
That's debatable. We're not installing a "carpet turf"
but rather a "synthetic grass." It plays truer to grass
than the Astroturf does, so hopefully our teams won't
have difficulty playing
in the grass-oriented
Centennial Conference. Unfortunately, that also
means it will be easier for grass-based teams to adjust
to our home field. Also, not all of the teams will have
the new field as their designated home field, and as a
result will continue to struggle with our less-than-stellar grass fields.
Since the long-term goal for the Garnet Tide is "to
be competitive," I wonder whether the move towards a
synthetic surface is in the program's best interest.
Yes, we'll have a showcase facility with a highly flexible game field. And yes, we'll have a much-needed new
track. But considering the horrific state of our grass
field maintenance over the past two years, I fear that
other much-neglected athletic facilities will be left
neglected once the new facility is completed. As the
other athletic facilities continue to degrade, the showcase facility will become more and more stressed.
I'm also a bit disturbed that every possible recruit
for any sport has been told about the new facility, as if
in some way it shows that we're better than the
Amhersts or Gettysburgs of the Div. 11l world. Like it's
the only thing that makes Swarthmore special. I don't
think prospective students should be seduced by a

new field when choosing their future college.
But despite the downsides, the most important
aspect of the facility is that the college is now willing to
invest $2 million in the athletics program without
falling into a tit-for-tat hierarchy of athletics and academics. No longer is the emphasis on academic facilities before athletic facilities, a la Kohlberg being asked
to build an academic building before the new tennis
center. With the new facility comes newfound faith in
the words "renewed commitment to athletics."
After Saturday's turf loss at Homewood, I overheard a rookie in the locker room say "Wait until
we're on turf next year!" I'm glad for her, because
she'll be part of the next chapter of the tradition of
Swarthmore field hockey. The team will most likely
shift from the run-and-gun grass team that we are now

to an even more highly-skilled, precision team. They'll
finally have the surface that a field hockey team needs
to be really successful. I know that they'll get Hopkins
in two years when they return to Homewood field.
And while I'll miss being a part of it all, I'm still glad
that I'm not playing on the turf this year.

NBA preview: The good, the bad and the Knicks
I figure that by now, there are two kinds of people who
are reading this article. There are those who are pleasantly
surprised to see my byline in the paper for consecutive
weeks, and there are those who simply wish that I would
die. Either way, all of you
readers are probably wondering who screwed up and
gave me the great idea to
churn out an article with
only one week to prepare.
Well, the credit for that
idea would have to go to my
editor, Marky Mark, who is

apparently one of only
three people on campus not
related to me or dating me
who thought my last article

JOSH LOEFFLER
Riding the Pine

was worth a damn. And it's
a good thing that he gave
me the option to write more
frequently, too, because
this is the time of year

when my opinions start flying around like Sharpies
food near Justin Ryder. That's right, sweethearts, it's NBA
time.
I have more than enough stupid drivel to fill up two
columns previewing the upcoming pro basketball season. It
only took me a few hours to decide, then, that this preview
should be broken up into two sections: teams and players. It
only took me a little while longer to realize that I did not
have any good formats for my preview. I quickly decided to
structure this article like one of those SI deals, where the
journalist asks questions to himself. I thought that I would
answer my own questions rather well. So, without further
ado, I present Part One of my NBA Season Preview.

"Will the Knicks ever be any good again?"
No, the Knicks will never, ever, ever be any good ever
again. Ever. This is what happens when you take a legend,
a Hall-of-Famer, a top-50 performer, and trade him in the
waning stages of his career. Karma that's what happens.
The spirit of Patrick E wing will haunt this team for all eternity, and the players that this squad brings in to win games
will blow out knees, refuse to play defense and break
appendages on yachts. Karma, baby. That's what I'm talking
about.
"Will the Eastern Conference have a new champion?"
No. While the New Jersey Nets retooled this summer, the
rest of the Eastern Conference fumbled their collective
ways through the off-season, picking up marginal players
and in general not really improving. We'll start right at
home. The Sixers gave a divisional rival the only center in
the East who can even come close to guarding Shaq and in
return got two players who at their best are solid and at
their worst are very marginal. (I still think this is a good
move for the Sixers, though. More on this later.) In Boston,
an owner dismantled a team before he prepared to sell them.
The Celtics traded their starting point guard, Kenny
Anderson, and a handful of others for the whopping contract and body fat percentage of chronic underachiever Vin
Baker. OnlyPenny Hardaway has fallenfarther than Baker,
who is the kiss of death for a talented, contending team. Just
ask George Karl. On other fronts, the Hornets stayed put
and are hoping for Jamal Mashburn to play better when
healthy. The Pacers are coached by Isiah Thomas, who I
simply think is dumb. The only real contender to the
Eastern throne, in my mind, resides in Washington. The
Wizards made a tremendous upgrade by trading for Jerry
Stackhouse and grabbing Larry Hughes, and they brought
in experience with Charles Oakley and Bryon Russell.
Rookies Jared Jeffries and Juan Dixon look good, and
Kwame Brown seems to be developing the way Jordan once
-

thought he would. Speaking of which, they have Jordan,
and you can never bet against the greatest of all time.
"Did the Sixers make a good trade?"
Apart from what I said earlier, yes. I know, you're asking
how I can feel both ways. Mutombo simply could not flourish in the Sixers offense. He needs a point guard to create
shots for him, which will happen in Jersey with Jason Kidd.
It certainly will not happen with Allen Iverson. The Sixers
saw that Mutombo was getting old, felt that in the long run
he could not help, and got what they could. MacCulloch is a
solid center, and Van Horn can shoot. These are things that
the Sixers desperately needed. So, while the trade made a
rival better, it also prepares the Sixers for better success in
the future.
And last but not least; "Will the Lakers be
dethroned?"
Yes, they will. The Sacramento Kings will finally get
their heads on straight and take down Shaq and Kobe. Look,
part of this is me talking as a man who hates theLakers. But
part of it is me just thinking that this team is too talented to
not win it all this year. Say what you will about this team's
performance in clutch time, but ifPeja Stojakovic is healthy
in the Lakers series this year, I think that the Kings are
reigning world champs come next year. No one annoys
Shaq like Vlade. No team has a better bench. No point guard
has emerged as a prime time performer like Mike Bibby.
And no one shoots or moves without the ball as well as this
team. The Kings have been to the gates and been rejected.
They have the fire in their bellies, and they will not choke
again. Unless of course, Shaq decides that he wants to really play, and then no one, and I mean no one, has any chance

at all.
Stay tuned for next week, when Josh discusses Kobe, AI,
CWebb, and the worst player in the NBA.

Despite losses, Tide challenge Gettysburg, Muhlenberg
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

Although their record might indicate
otherwise, the Garnet Tide have been playing their best soccer of the season as oflate.
With an aggressive style of play, the Tide
have been able to dominate in stretches of
games against quality opponents, only to
fall after an unlucky play, a missed scoring
opportunity, or an untimely defensive lapse.
Rolling into this weekend, the team knew it
would have its hands full against the likes of

national powerhouse Gettysburg, ranked
No. 3 in NCAA Division 111 by the National
Soccer Coaches Association of America, and
conference rival Muhlenberg. But unlike in
years past, this weekend was a much-anticipated one, with the Tide eager to take on
both title-contending teams.
Against Muhlenberg on Saturday, the
Tide fell 2-0 in a game that could have gone
either way. The Tide's offense was able to
create scoring opportunities early on and
assert itself physically. However, the
Garnet found themselves in an early 1-0
hole after Muhlenberg's Tim Sparta scored
just 5:23 into the match. With a game scheduled for the following day, the Garnet had
to go deep into their roster in order to conserve energy, stretching themselves thin at
times. The Mules added an insurance goal
at 66:28, as David Vassilaros sprinted by
two Garnet defenders and put the ball past
an outstretched Reuben Heyman-Kantor
'O6 for the score.
The following day, amidst slightly sloppy
playing conditions, the Tide hosted the
nationally ranked Gettysburg Bullets. The
Bullets came into the match off of a surprising two-game losing skid, another small
advantage that the Tide had to work with.
The Tide didn't show any signs of intimidation against the explosive Bullets,

team throughout. And with Nate Shupe 'O5
in the net, Swarthmore was able to keep the
game tied going into the half.
Shupe

approach heading into the game. "As the
goalkeeper, I obviously wanted to prevent
Gettysburg from scoring," he said. "I knew
that as long as the game was 0-0, we had just
as much of a chance to win as they did.
Fortunately, I was able to keep Gettysburg
out of the net for the first half, but ultimately their determination took advantage of
our inexperience, and they were able to
score."
The scrappy Garnet were able to hang
with the Bullets until Chris Borcik picked
up a clear that deflected off of his teammate,
James Bealer, and put the ball past a diving
Nate Shupe at 68:43. Gettysburg scored
again just 7:52 later when Bullet midfielder
James Miller found Borcik near the goal for
the score, his second of the game. The goals
sealed the victory for the Bullets, and the
Garnet Tide fell to 5-11-1 overall and 0-7 in
the Centennial Conference with the loss.

Despite the loss, however, as Captain
Brendan R. Moriarty 'O4 explained, "it all
came together" on Sunday.
"That game was without a doubt our best
performance I've ever seen our program
produce," he said. "Everyone who played
put everything they had onto the field in
terms of effort and skill. We applied high
pressure on their possession game all 90
minutes, our defense was able to neutralize
their attack and we produced many [scoring] chances against them. I don't think it is
a stretch at all to say that we dominated
most of that game. And that against a team
that is supposed to be one of the hottest in
all of Division 111right now."
Shupe, who recorded seven saves in
goal for the Garnet, added, "At this point,

the success of our season is not dependent
on our record but rather on the way we
play each game.
"Though we lost to Gettysburg, we
showed that we have the potential to be a
top team in the country, despite what our
record seems to indicate. Certainly, that
made the match against Gettysburg a success."
"While our results haven't been showing
it, there is a lot going on here," Moriarty

said. "For two weeks now, this team has
shown that it can match up with any team.
That never used to be the case in years past.
And compared to the beginning of the season, it is like night and day the way we are
playing. We are finally playing to our potential, which is high. It' s too bad our record
isn't reflecting that."

Buzzards devour Ursinus 26-5
Munroe, Pradhan and
Goldstein all score
tries as Swarthmore
dominates offensively
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
The men's rugby club gave Ursinus a
thorough beating last Saturday in the
squad's final home game of the season.
With the 26-5 victory, the Evil Buzzards
improved their record to 2-3 on the season,
which wraps up this Saturday at Lehigh.
Swarthmore was paced by flanker Erik
Munroe 'O4, who used his lightning-quick
speed to burn the Ursinus defense for tries
on two separate occasions.
"We had a surprisingly large crowd, so
everybody could see the albino firepower
that is Erik Munroe," said Jon Fombonne
'O5.
Unfortunately for the Buzzards, Munroe

will not be active for next week's game,
leaving a gaping, hole in the Swarthmore

attack. "He'll be impossible to replace, but
we have some guys that look good," Randy
Goldstein 'O5 said.
"It's a real tough loss offensively
because he's such a tough player," Dan
Chamberlain 'O4 added. "The other backs
are just going to have to step it up."
One player who may be called upon to
shoulder more of the offensive burden is
Chamberlain himself, a back who plays the
that
Munroe
opposite side
plays.
Chamberlain returned
to action on
Saturday after being sidelined for over five
weeks with an injury he suffered during the
first game of the season. In that match,
which was also Chamberlain's first, he took
a cleat to his right hand and suffered a
quarter-inch deep gash. He returned to full
form on Saturday, however, setting up a
Manu Pradhan 'O3 try with a spirited run
along the sideline.
"I just busted through a couple of tackles, and when I was tackled Manu was there
to pick it up," Chamberlain said.
Pradhan has his own version of the
events. "[Chamberlain] broke off on a run on
the weak side," he said. "He broke two tackles and barely managed to stay inbounds.
When he was tackled, I was there to pick it
up, and Kenny [Oh 'o4] gave me a push."
Goldstein scored the final try for the
Evil Buzzards as the game came to a close.
"The try was really the result of hard work
by our whole forward pack, especially John
Turcik ['os], who really pushed it through
for me," he said.
Fombonne contributed three conversions for the Buzzards, and the game ended
26-5 in Swarthmore's favor, though the referee claimed it was only a 24-5 win. "The
referee didn't count the last [conversion],"
Fombonne said. "He forgot about it."

Andrew Steel Phoenix Staff

The men's rugby club has reason to be enthusiastic, having already improved two games in the win column from last fall season.
The win was the second for Swarthmore
against Ursinus in as many games. Last
spring, the Buzzards won a hard-fought
defensive battle 10-6. It was the first rugby
game for Ursinus since they returned to the
scene after being defunct for several years.
"It was their first game, so they came out
with some pretty incredible intensity,"
Pradhan said.

Depsite winning last year's match,
Swarthmore did not expect easy pickings
this time around. "We had only just beaten
them last year, so we knew it was going to
be a close game," Fombonne said. "But after
the first half, when we completely outplayed them, we knew we were going to

kick their asses."
Chamberlain thought the defense was
an integral part of the win this time around.
"I just thought the team really played well
versus Ursinus," he said. "A lot of guys hit
hard, and we were tackling very well.
There really were not too many missed
tackles."
Next week's game against Lehigh should
be challenging for the Buzzards. Lehigh,
last year's Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby
Union (EPRU) Division 111 champions, are
currently second in the division and have
already clinched the right to face Franklin
and Marshall for the division championship in a few weeks.

"Lehigh is definitely a strong team,"
Goldstein admitted, "but we've been

improving all semester."
Regardless of the outcome on Saturday,
the Buzzards' two wins this fall season are
already a great improvement over last fall,
when the squad went 0-3.
Though Swarthmore has not yet settled
on a spring schedule, match coordinator
Randy Goldstein has promised

an exciting

slate, possibly including another game
against archrival Albright. The team will
also benefit from players returning from
abroad in the spring, such as Brandon
Carver 'O4, as it seeks to build upon the success of the fall season.
