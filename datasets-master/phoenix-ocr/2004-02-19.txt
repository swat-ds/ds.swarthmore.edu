Dorm construction

Students returning to campus early in fall may be required to find their own housing

BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

The record-setting low temperatures of
the past few months have delayed the construction of the college's newest residence

hall. It is now uncertain whether the new
dorm will be ready for occupants in midAugust as originally planned.
Project Manager Larry Briggs of W.S.
Cumby and Son said the cold weather has
set back construction by making the neces-

sary masonry work impossible.
"We've probably lost four to six weeks
because of weather conditions," he said.
"We've had months where it never got
above freezing."
Briggs and his team said they are confident that they will be able to make up for
some of the lost time this spring by working on multiple floors simultaneously. But,
there is no way for them to know if the
dorm will be completed by mid-August.
"We're not sure how many more days we'll
lose because of cold weather," Briggs said.
Because of this, Director of Residential
Life Myrt Westphal and Housing Committee
have recently been discussing possible scenarios for the beginning of next semester.
Since Westphal is not completely confident
that the new dorm will be ready in time for
Orientation Week, she has decided that no
first-years will be placed there.
The last thing freshmen need to be told
upon arriving on campus is that their
rooms are not ready, Westphal said.
"Coming to college is unsettling enough.
Freshmen don't need anything else thrown
at them."
Housing Committee also decided that
the college would not take responsibility
for housing new dorm residents such as
fall athletes and campus advisers who need
to return to campus early. If their rooms

are not ready by August, they will have to
make their own living arrangements.

"It's not the college's responsibility to

deal with this," Westphal said. "If I had to
take on that task, it would just be over-

whelming."
According to Westphal, the possibility
the new dorm will not be completed by the
time classes begin in September is remote.
She noted that if this were to occur, the 75
students would be provided with temporary housing. "If that kind of thing would
really rock your boat, you should not pick
into the new dorm," Westphal said.
If there were not enough temporary housing available on campus, students might be
placed in a motel in Media. Westphal and
Housing Committee do not consider this an
attractive option due to the expense, transportation requirements and telecommunication limitations. They also do not expect this
scenario to actually occur, but want students
to be aware that it is a possibility. "We are
being up front

and open about what could

happen," Westphal said.

Jessica Zagory 'O5, a member of the soccer team, has no plans to live in the new
dorm but was dismayed to learn that fall
athletes were being discouraged from
choosing rooms there. She also said she
believed the college should guarantee housing somewhere on campus for all students

returning early.
"I think that's irresponsible of the
school, because they're supposed to take
care of the students, regardless of whether
they are athletes, CAs, or other orientation-involved groups," she said.
Since many athletes begin practice early
in the morning, Zagory said she felt it was
unreasonable to ask them to commute to
campus.

College plans to cancel long-distance service
BY CHRISTINA TEMES

ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

Information Technology Services announced Monday
that direct long-distance dialing from campus phones and
monthly billing would not be provided after this semester.
The decision, disclosed in a reserved-students e-mail by
ITS Director Judy Downing, said increased student use of
cell phones and calling cards for long-distance calls had
caused the college to lose money.
"The cost we were paying to have the bills produced is
more thanwhat we were collecting from students," Downing
said.

STC Student Services, Inc. acts as a billing agent for students. After students get a bill from STC and send payment
to the company, the payment is processed and put into a college account whichpays for phone service, maintenance and
for local technicians to come in and investigate any problems, ITS Networking and Systems Manager Mark Dumic
said.

The college pays $55,000 annually to produce and process
the monthly phone bills. Only $21,000 has been coUected so
far this academic year. In comparison, the college received
$370,000 from students during the 1995-96 school year,
according to Downing.
"If the college starts picking up the tab for long distance,
it all filters back into your tuition," she said.
The problem is affecting other colleges, many of which
are taking similar actions. Bates, Colby, Macalester, Reed,
Grinnelland Trinity University have all canceled direct dialing long-distance. Franklin and Marshall, Kenyon and

THE PHOENIX

Carleton are considering taking

similar measures, Downing

said.

Bryn Mawr and Haverford have also recognized the problem but do not yet plan to terminate their long-distance
plans. "Is there a long-term possibility? Sure, given the climate of the telephone industry," Haverford Business
Manager Alan Crosman said. "At the moment, we don't have
a plan for [canceling long-distance], but we are experiencing
the same problems."

"If the college starts picking up the
tab for long distance, it all

final decision of this semester, according to Dumic.
The students on the committee said discontinuing direct
long-distance dialing would not be an issue and that they
and their hallmates were more likely to use calling cards or
cell phones, Dumic said. He said a wide variety of calling
cards were available at the bookstore and other venues.
Bookstore Director Kathy Grace said the bookstore
would continue providing calling cards for students. But, the
company that currently supplies the bookstore with calling
cards has stopped making them.
"I suspect the reason that company stopped making them
was the same reason the college cancelled long-distance
the proliferation of cell phones," Grace said. She is planning
to find a new calling card supplier. "As long as there is a
need, we'll make sure we have something," she said.
Dumic said no one had called or e-mailed him with concerns in response to ITS's e-mail and that he was "not really

expecting anything."

Most students are unaffected by the changes. "I don't

cell phone anyway," Shanna Caines 'O7 said.
Kristy Simmons 'O7, who uses the direct dialing, shared
similar sentiments. "It's an annoyance, but I can get a calling card or something," she said.
But some students are upset by the decision. "I was mad
when I found out the system won't be used next semester. I
use it to keep in touch with my family and friends," Lauren
lanuzzi 'O7 said.
Despite the changes, the college will still provide phones
that will allow students to dial to local areas, Dumic said.
Voice mail service will also continue.

Battle agreed. "All colleges seem to be losing money on longBryn Mawr's Telephone

distance services," she said. Bryn Mawr is "trying to figure

At Swarthmore, the decision was made by a committee of
students and staff that was created in the fall to discuss
changes to the phone system, according to Downing.
Downing addressed the long-distance issue after realizing
"there was a possibility that we would not break even." After
the committee met, ITS brought the issue to the attention of

Wage campaigners disappointed by student turnout
BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM
pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu
Despite the efforts of the Swarthmore

Living Wage and Democracy Campaign,
the turnout of students has remained
lower than expected at educational sessions and discussion forums about the
new wage recommendation from the Ad
Hoc Committee on a Living Wage.

"Turnout was a little poor,
but we had an excellent
discussion nonetheless."
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5
At the Tuesday Student Council-run
discussion, around 18 students showed up,
many of whom were members of the living
wage campaign and Student Council. The
number of students who participated at
the ad hoc committee's Sunday discussion, while better than Student Council's
meeting, was also less than expected.
"Turnout was a little poor, but we had
an excellent discussion nonetheless,"
Student

Council Co-President Emiliano

Rodriguez 'O5 said. Rodriguez said that,
while it was not possible to force students
to come to these discussions, it was an
important time now for discourse on a living wage. In the end, "silence is compliance," Rodriguez said.
Campaign member Alix Gould-Werth
'O7 said students had been "very receptive" to the information given out regarding the campaign.
"I think there is a high level of student
interest," Gould-Werth said. She cited
busy schedules as the main reason students have not come to the events, saying
"students will put it at a higher priority"

Students read over the living wage recommendation at a forum the Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage hosted Sunday.
as the issue comes to a head.
Julia Smith 'O6, another living wage
campaign member, agreed.
"The student body isn't as engaged as it
will become," she said. Enthusiasm and
interest in the implementation of a living
wage will grow as people realize the
importance of the issue, according to

Smith.
When asked why they had not attended
living wage events, most students said they
were too busy to attend or felt they were
not a necessary part of the process.
The living wage campaign does a significantly better job than most in informing the community about the process,

Nash Adamson 'O7 said. Still, Adamson

does not plan on going to the meetings. "I
support the idea, but I just don't know if
it's possible," Adamson said.

Other students, like Tanya Aydelott 'O5,

a high level academic workload and many
responsibilities, it was unlikely that students would attend extra meetings.

Elizabeth Buckner
said the
Swarthmore lifestyle should not be an

informed and educated in order to discuss

"Students can't say what they think

about living wage without knowing what's
going on," Buckner said.

But some students said they felt the

process did not require their participation. "I figure [the living wage] is going to
be a decision made by some committee,"
Benjamin Firestone 'O7 said.
Given the low attendance at Tuesday's
discussion, the campaign and Student

PPR will no longer house first-years
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

The members of the class of 2008 will not
have to trek to a dorm room in Pittenger
next year, but an unusually large proportion
will find themselves climbing up to Parrish
fourth.
Housing Committee decided at its Feb. 2
meeting that first-years would no longer live
in Pittenger due to complaints from first-year
residents this year, according to Director of
Residential Life Myrt Westphal.
"People who lived there, RAs found it was
a hard place for freshmen to become part of
the Swarthmore community," Westphal said.
Jacob Wallace 'O5, a RA in Hallowell and a
member of Housing Committee, said the committee had found that many people reacted
negatively to living in Pittenger.
"For the most part, the freshmen were not
particularly happy because of a lack of a critical mass of fellow freshmen. They tended to
migrate to campus and saw PPR as a place to
sleep and avoid on the weekend," Wallace

said.

Andrew Gregory 'O4, a Pittenger RA who
lived there his first year, agreed with the
committee's decision. He said there was "a
good community in Pitt, but it's easy to feel
disconnected from campus."
Jon Stott 'O7 agreed. "You're really isolated from the rest of the campus, living with
not that many freshmen. People aren't here.

There's not much student life."

This year, six doubles will
become triples, with the new addition of
loft beds to provide greater living space.
The remaining four doubles will be open to
sophomores, in the housing lottery, according to Alice Balbierer of Facilities
more space.

Kristin Leitzel 'O7 said she only regretted
living in Pittenger "when I'm walking to
class, it's 8:20, and it's an 8:30 class and I'm
not going to make it." But she said it took "a
certain kind of person to enjoy living in a setting that's a little more secluded. I hope
[Housing Committee] isn't going to make that
decision because they think people aren't
going to be able to handle it."
The rooms in Pittenger formerly occupied
by first-years will be available to sophomores
next year, which will create "a great sophomore enclave, more fun for all the secondyears," Westphal said.
Palmer and Roberts, the other two dorms
of the PPR complex, do not currently house
first-years.
Because first-years will not be placed in the
new dorm or Pittenger, housing in other
dorms will be affected, particularly in Parrish.
The incoming first-year students who
would have been placed in Pittenger will
instead live in Parrish, Mertz, Dana and
Hallowell. Every Dana and Hallowell floor
will have an additional first-year double.
The overflow of first-years into Mertz doubles means no sophomores will live in the

dorm.

Parrish fourth will undergo changes on
the women's side to accommodate housing
changes.

Last year, seven doubles on the hall
were transformed into triples to open up

Management.
According to Housing Committee minutes, it was originally planned that all

Parrish fourth doubles would be converted
into triples. Westphal decided this was not
feasible because of the pressure put on RAs
and the limited bathroom space available.
One Whittier Place, first used as housing
this year, may be used as overflow housing or
may be in the lottery next year. The Woolman
RA will take on expanded responsibilities if
the space is needed and a specific Whittier
RA has not been assigned.
Housing Committee minutes originally
said the school had obtained a housing permit and planned to install a new fire escape,
opening up the third floor, so that up to 20
students can live in the dorm.

With huge banners in Sharpies, reserved-students e-mails, notices pinned to doors, signs plastered on every available space, rallies, meetings
and referendums, the Swarthmore Living Wage
and Democracy Campaign has made a name for
itself on the Swarthmore campus.
But compared to the tactics of other college
wage campaigns, the movement at Swarthmore has
been tame.
On the Wesleyan campus, students occupied the
admissions office for 33 hours last April, refusing
to leave until the school agreed to pay its janitors a
living wage, according to the Wesleyan United
Student Labor Coalition's Web site. They ultimately succeeded.
Strikes occurred earlier this year at Yale, which

has yet to adopt a living wage. The strikes took
place as students were coming back for the start of
the term during first-year orientation.
"Basically, their clerical union, dining services
union, nurses union and grounds union went on
strike because their contracts had expired, and
they wanted improved contracts, a better pension
plan and job security," said Harris Kornstein 'O6, a
member of the Swarthmore living wage campaign
who attended the strikes. "It represented a big
moment for labor in terms of universities. The
unions put in work for a good resolution," he said.
Unlike the workers at Harvard, Yale and
Wesleyan, who are part of unions, Swarthmore
workers are not unionized.
"There was an attempt to unionize in the 'Bos,
but it didn't work," living wage campaign member

She noticed, however, that there

Alix Gould-Werth 'O7 said. This may make it more
difficult for them to negotiate for a living wage.
Harvard, Wesleyan and Colorado College pay
their employees a living wage, but it is less than
the $10.72 per hour offered as a majority recommendation by Swarthmore's Ad Hoc Committee on
February 19, 2004

a Living Wage, let alone the minority recommendation of $13.89.
Harvard's living wage was set at $10.25.

Originally, the living wage campaign at Colorado
College set the wage standard at $13.05 an hour, but
it settled for $9.64, according to Gregory PiescoPutnam, a member of the CC Living Wage

Coalition.

Kornstein said that, while "other campaigns
have only asked for a $9 wage, this is an expensive
area to live in."
The ad hoc committee determined its recommendations using statistics compiled by the
Woman's Association for Woman's Alternatives,
the Economic Policy Institute and other organizations that try to calculate the cost of living in
Delaware County, according to Gould-Werth.
While the Swarthmore campaign assumes that
employees live in Delaware County, the Harvard
living wage standard assumed that employees lived
in the greater Boston area. Members of the
Harvard campaign want to raise the living wage

standard to 'at least $l2 per hour plus benefits
at
the very minimum, [it] should exceed the wage
standard set by the Cambridge living wage ordinance: currently $llll per hour," according to the
Substantive Platform of the Harvard Living Wage
Campaign.
Campaigns at many other colleges are still in
their infancy. Living wage campaigns rarely exist
at state schools.
"I think we are doing fairly well," Kornstein
said. "The fact of the $9 wage is above market
value, and that is a big step, but not a living wage.
Programs like Learning for Life and staff affairs
committees are a step in the right direction, but
Learning for Life doesn't pay the bills."
Peisco-Putnam agreed with Kornstein's assessment. "Our two schools are an elite group. Out of
the hundredsof campus living wage campaigns, we
are the only schools who have gotten this far," he
said.

"It's hard to recruit counselors
when you're telling them that
they'll be spending a lot of time
fundraising instead of being with
the girls," organizer Sarah
Cohodes 'O5 said.
Because it is a Swarthmore
organization working on the
Swarthmore campus, Co/Motion
has trouble attracting any outside

donors.

"We were told we'd be put at
the bottom of the pile because
we're coming from an institution

For service organizations oper-

ating on Swarthmore's own campus, however, the process is
entirely different.
Cobbling together a budget
Learning for Life, an organization that pairs Swarthmore students and staff in a partnership
program, also began with funding
from the Lang Center. But, over
the years, this financial support
has dried up. While the Student
Budget Committee can support
the day-to-day operations during
the year, funding for the summer
learning program is hard to find.

But Co/Motion, like many
service groups after their first few
years of operation, can no longer
apply for Lang Center funding.
The Swarthmore Foundation, for

instance, "normally gives priority
to first-time undergraduate applicants," according to its guidelines.
Summer of Service Internships
are intended to be one-time grants
only, and they are usually
designed for work with existing
nonprofit organizations. Lang
Opportunity Grants,
another
source of funding for service
groups, are similarly designed for
new "entrepreneurial" projects.
"After generous support from
the Swarthmore Foundation and
SO SI grants for the last two years,
we were told that they could not
continue to support a project
every year," Cohodes said in an email.
Pat James, associate director
for student programs and training
at the Lang Center, said these
requirements were under review
but declined to elaborate.
Service grants from the college
are currently designed as seed
money, allowing an organization
to set up shop in a community like
North Philadelphia or Chester.

Over the course of their first few
years, successful organizations
are expected to create connections

with local communities and eventually wean themselves off
Swarthmore funding.

"We shouldn't be expecting to

leech off of Swarthmore forever,"
said Morgan Simon 'O4, a past vol-

semesters in which education pro-

Co/Motion asked the college to
support their program in nonfinancial ways, such as donating
Sharpies lunches during the
week-long camp, but they were
told this would not be possible.
"We're also talking to community organizations like Rotary and
the Co-Op to see if they would be
interested in donations or challenge grants," Cohodes said. She
also intends to continue planning
on-campus sales in order to help
eke out the group's budget.
While members of Co/Motion
and Learning for Life emphasized
the college's philosophical support of their programs, they said
that did not always translate into
funding.
Because the service funding
system is designed to support "offcampus" programs, groups operating on the Swarthmore campus
have no clear process once they
establish themselves.
One option would be to file as a
nonprofit organization separate
from the Swarthmore umbrella.
But for Friedler, this would introduce
false
separation.

and we want to have it on the
Swarthmore campus," she said.
Charting a new path
The problem is most acute for
Co/Motion and Learning for Life,
because they organize summer
programs within the Swarthmore
community. Other groups, such as
Girls Action Initiative and
Positive Alternatives in Chester,
can survive with support from the
Student Budget Committee and
outside donors. For summer service programs operating on campus, neither avenue is available.
The college administration has
been interested in discussion on
the issue. "They seemed very
responsive to having the conversation about sustainability after
Swarthmore grants," Cohodes
said. "They recognized that there
was no clear path for groups to
take after the funding has run

out."

"This has been discussed in
small ad hoc settings with respect

to specific program efforts," Vice

President Maurice Eldridge '6l
said in an e-mail. The Lang Center
"is going to convene a conversation that looks at the issue more
broadly and, we hope, begin to
evolve some directions and solutions."
In addition to codifying the
process, part of the solution may
be to rely less on financial sup-

Viruses, spam now

from a long-time friend that said,
"Osama bin Laden has been captured! Click here for more info."

New Co-Op under construction
The property next to the Co-Op in Swarthmore was recently demolished to make way for a new CoOp building. The new Co-Op will feature double the retail space and a patio area with tables in the
front. The store will have more organic produce, foods and fish as well as more local produce. The
building currently used as the Co-Op will come down, and Lafayette Court, which passes in front of
the borough fire station, will extend to Myers Avenue. The Co-Op plans to close for one weekend
during the construction process to move items from the old store into the new.

"I think we have the resources to solve this type of
problem," she said. Zagory suggested that athletes kept
from their rooms be allowed to live together for the duration of preseason on an empty upperclassman hall, such
as those in Wharton.
Valerie Marone 'O5, a member of Housing Committee,
argued that, although Zagory's solution seemd good in
theory, it would be a logistical nightmare.

She said it would put an added strain on
Environmental Services staff, who would be forced to
thoroughly clean some rooms multiple times. "It's not
fair to put somebody in a room that hasn't really been
cleaned for them," she said.
"It's disappointing that students are going to have to
think of the limitations inherent to picking their housing
for next year," Marone said. "At the same time, the fact
that we [Housing Committee] are being up front about it
should alleviate some problems that we might face in the
fall."
Stephanie Koskowich 'O7, a volleyball player, will
attempt to pick into the new dorm at the housing lottery
in April despite the risks involved.
She is not worried about the possibility of having no
room of her own for two weeks.
"If a problem were to arise I'd just deal with it then,"
she said, adding that she could always stay with teammates living in other dorms.
Housing Committee member Katie Schlesinger 'O5,
agreed that those picking into the new dorm in April
would be taking a chance. But she said the gamble comes
with a huge payoff.
"It's going to be a great dorm with a chance of incredible inconvenience," Schelsinger said. "The inconvenience will be tempered by the fact it is going to be a pretty sweet living situation."

From student to super freak: a primer
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Sometimes you just
gotta get a little freaky.

SIDURI HASLERIG
AMIR JAIMA
Sexual Healing

In-out-up-down
missionary sex gets
old, doesn't it? This
will probably be a rare
column in that it will
be more applicable to
those of you in longerterm, trusting relationships. That being said,
trust and comfort are of
the utmost importance.
If you aren't comfortable, there is very little
chance
that you'll

share your fantasies,
enjoy the
experience if you get
there. Once that is established, communicate. Remember
that you don't need to actually do everything you or your
partner are curious about, but being able to discuss it
in
a non-judgmental way
is crucial. Good. So we're here to
offer a few starting suggestions. You may not feel comfortable jumping straight into hard-core S&M, but there are
still a lot of ways to broaden your relationship sexually.
First and foremost, play with as many positions as
possible. Don't know any? There are myriad resources
available, ranging from classics like the Kama Sutra to
the varied experiences of your freaky friends. Inform
yourself and try them. You may not like them all, but
most angles can be quite pleasurable. If you are trying a

much less

position that requires a particularly erect penis, experiment in the morning before he pees. The phenomenon

known as "morning wood" can work wonders.
Food. OK, so it isn't the most adventurous form of
experimentation, but it can still be fun. We recommend
that you don't start with whipped cream: It's overrated.
Not only is it insanely sweet, it is so fluffy that it makes it
hard for you to actually reach the skin under it. It's

intimidating, and mouth to skin is the real point, anyway,
right? Be wary of foods that detract from your partner and
your shared sexuality. If it's just about food, go out for a
nice meal and forgo sex altogether. But, if your priority is
sex, ice is the simplest starting point. Do be careful about
getting any sugar near vaginal openings. There is no reason why your good, clean, experimental fun should leave
her with a yeast infection.
Handcuffs require a lot of trust, especially as you
venture to include things like blindfolding, gagging or
even just being tied more "creatively" in your handcuffed
soirees. Our favorite approach is to use something that is
like a scarf
as a
already a part of your ensemble
makeshift binding. Since this line of experimentation can
potentially progress into almost complete powerlessness,
it's important to make sure you have a signal for each
party to say they want out
and that you won't be offended if they use it.

The Big Chair on Parrish Beach
might be thrilling, but Public Safety
can be a pain in the ass.
Biting and scratching are simple v ways to step up your
sex life. You will quickly learn what level of pain you
like, are comfortable with and are willing to inflict.

Therefore, less explicit communication is needed for
these forays. The added bonus is that marks from these
activities are less common than hickeys, so if you happen to incur a visible "reminder," it will probably not be
identified as a sex injury.
If you want to role-play, our advice is to begin with a
stereotyped role, as opposed to a specific person, because
it is a lot less intimidating. Otherwise it can feel like one
partner would rather replace the other with someone
else. If you combine your first role-plays with an unusu-

it can heighten
al setting
like an office, for example
your experience because it becomes easier to see
yourself in a different situation. We need to reiterate
how key communication is. It is more than likely that, in
many role-plays, "no" will not mean "no."

Many people find public places exciting. Starting on
private property where you could potentially be seen,
but not prosecuted for anything, is probably a good idea.
The Big Chair on Parrish Beach might be thrilling, but
Public Safety can be a pain in the ass. If the thought of
doing the nasty in the middle of the beach turns you on,
examine what exactly it is that arouses you. Is it the possibility of getting caught? Is it that you aren't supposed
to be there and are, therefore, skilled for breaking the
rules? Or are you a full-out exhibitionist? Figuring out
the source of your arousal will help you to find the best
ways for you to expand upon your initial experiments.
Throwing a toy into any sexual act can be a fantastic
way to up the ante without breaking too much new
ground. When we first took this column, we vowed not to
touch on the topic of masturbation or vibrators.
However, there are a lot of other kinds of sex toys, and
they are certainly useful for much more than solo sex.
Threesomes and orgies are a different kind of
experimentation altogether. They still push the envelope
and offer excitement, but unlike our other suggestions
we do not recommend them in the context of a
committed relationship. No matter how beneficial
spicing up your sex life is to your union, adding a third
or fourth party is a guaranteed complication.
We don't think you necessarily need to systematically
test each of our tips or even form your own litany of
experiments. Instead, we hope you will dabble in whatever strikes your sexual fancy when the time seems
right. And if it never does, OK. Informed conservatism is
a viable, legitimate option. Our job is just to niake sure
that y'all are informed.

opinion, this wardrobe malfunction/accident/publicity stunt should have long been
stored in our memories along with other
Jackson family travesties, such as Michael

Marie Presley at the Video Music Awards.
However, it has sparked a controversy that
has turned into a witch-hunt of indecency

Skinny Hos devour competition, 130 slices
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

When the evening of Thursday, Feb. 12 had come to an
end, the competitors in Pinocchio's first Pizzathon
returned to Swarthmore victorious, sick or some combination of the two. "This was an event for the ages!" Nick
Martin 'O4 said. Very few would dare to dispute his claim
after all, when was the last time 48 Swatties devoured 58
pizzas within a span of 90 minutes? Judge Sachin Kale 'O4
translated the figure into 484 slices.
Along with fellow judges Audrey Chan 'O4, Renuka
Nayak 'O4 and Tina Stancheva 'O4, Kale packed into a small
back room in Pinocchio's late Thursday night. "The rules
were pretty straightforward: Show up and eat," participant Joe Raciti 'O5 said. Four teams of 12 raced to demolish
as many slices as possible in 90 minutes. Napkin blotting
of the pizza was allowed, but judges inspected each napkin
for pieces of cheese. Throwing up during the competition
or within 30 minutes afterwards would result in a fourslice penalty for the team, and the vomiter would not be
allowed to continue any further. Only one person, identified by Kale as G. Hall, threw up at the restaurant after
consuming 10 slices. Many vomited later that night. "I
threw up three times," Jeremy Cristol 'O5 said.
Another important rule: Though the team was required
to finish each slice, it did not have to be eaten by the same
person. Several teams had designated "crusters, or antiAtkins eaters," as Cristol put it, to eat only pizza crusts.
The students organized into four teams
the Skinny
Bitches, the Skinny Hos/the Red Team, the Wet Farts and
Big Girls, Watch Out For The.
Captain Mac Carlson 'O4 led the Skinny Hos to victory
at 130 slices total. His team members included Nick
Borunda 'O6, Edwin Nam 'O4, Jake Beckman 'O4, Nick Lum
'O4, Gerrit Hall 'O4, Nick Martin 'O4, Justin Crosby 'O4,
Mark Hanis 'O4, Mark Janoff 'O4, Alan Smith 'O5 and Nate
Wessler 'O4. Borunda, Beckman and Smith led their team
with 14 slices each.
The Wet Farts, led by Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, were in
second place with 122 slices. The team consisted of Raciti,
Jon Fombonne 'O5, Hunter Bandy 'O7, Ryan "Guam"
Hammond 'O7, Dan Reinganum 'O6, Joey Matthews 'O6,
Becket Flannery 'O7, Andrew Sniderman 'O6, David Gentry

Each team had a group chant, and participants used
their most cunning and efficient strategies to get through
all the pizza. These ranged from the innocuous dunking of

crusts in Sprite for easier swallowing, taking breaks to
walk around and piling slices on top of one another to
more sinister plans.
"There was the occasional dirty tactic, like a crust
thrown at another team," Cristol said. "Many attempted
vomit-inducing stomach punches to adversaries, none successful
Some performance-enhancing, munchie-inducing drugs were used by many participants beforehand."
The pizzathon began energetically. "It was hectic," Kale
said. "People were going crazy and being noisy and
screaming, chanting. At the end, people were quiet
It
was pretty disgusting. But it was impressive" to see people
eat that much, he said.
At the end of the night, organizer Nick Martin received
a trophy that Jake Beckman had created. "It looked like a
pizza cutter, a pizza and a gear all at the same time,"
Cristol said. Other awards were also given to Lorpu Jones
for Best Game Face and to Jacob Anguiano, who consumed
15 full slices, for Rookie of the Year. The award for Most
Valuable Player was fraught with controversy, as Rajaa
Shakir had consumed a massive 19 slices
but only seven
crusts. According to the rules, only full slices could count
toward individual award totals. "Jacob Anguiano
should have been MVP," Emiliano Rodriguez said. "Rajaa
was not eating all of her crusts, thus disqualifying her
from being an MVP."
Martin organized the event with the cooperation of
Pinocchio's Restaurant. "A group of about 12 of us go to
Pinocchio's on a regular basis," Martin said in an e-mail.
"I got the idea to do a competitive eating competition after
our last visit, when two eaters squared off to have the
other pay the $4.69 for the meal. It grew beyond my wildest
[dreams]."
About a dozen outside diners came in to witness the
spectacle and cheer the eaters on. "The other people in the
restaurant were taking bets on how many pizzas we could
eat," Raciti said. "They were upset when we only ate 58 piz...

zas. But they were very supportive."
"The Pinocchio's staff was also surprisingly into it, as
the cooks and waiters frequently came to the room and
looked on with giant grins on their faces," Cristol said in
an e-mail. "At the end of the competition, we all streamed
outside for fresh air, and everyone's faces were either
beaming with pride or queasy disgust as we compared bellies to see who looked most pregnant."
Martin plans to make this an annual event and may
hold another pizzathon at the end of the semester. When
asked if he'd participate, Raciti hesitated. "I'd think about
it this time. It doesn't leave you with the best feeling. But
yeah, I'd probably do it again," he said.
"I don't think anyone is going back to Pinocchio's for a

'Hosting Naked': radio gone wild
BY EMILY GASSER

egasserl@swarthmore.edu

Wednesday night is naked on WSRN
this semester. With the sexy British
"Naked Chef" and Canadian "ISJaked
News" becoming so popular on television,

Swarthmore radio is following suit with
its own brand of broadcast nudity,
"Hosting Naked," hosted au naturel every
Wednesday from 10 to 11 p.m. by Carla

Heelan 'O6 and Ariana Nash 'O6.
What can you expect to hear from these
unclad disc jockeys? "Hosting Naked"

plays all 'Bos music. Nash cites the Smiths,
Joy Division, Meatloaf, Prince and New
Order as some of her favorite bands.
They came up with the idea last year as

fully-clothed first-years.
"First semester freshman year, we
planned to have an 'Bos radio show together in the spring," Nash said. "One night, a
bunch of girls on our hall had a 'ladies
night,' and we were joking about having a
naked party sometime. We never had the
naked party, but Carla and I decided that
nakedness was a great idea for a show."
But with all the possible angles they
could have taken, why naked? "Because
Ariana is crazy," Heelan said.
"I love being naked," Nash said. "I
think people should do more things
naked."
Campus response so far has been enthusiastic, they said.
"People come up to us to tell us how
much they enjoy the show and to ask us if
we're really naked," Nash said.
So, are they really naked? "Yes, we are
naked," Nash said. "We have a lot of fun
stripping at the beginning of the show; we
dance around the studio naked." But,
according to Heelan, "There is no physical
nudity at all. Any nudity is merely
metaphorical." Hmm.
If all naked isn't enough for you, the
next show after "Naked" is all live. "Live
Bait," hosted by Matt Tyler 'O6 and Kyle
Broaders 'O6, plays entirely live music by
student groups from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m.

The "Naked" hosts provided a bit of a
shock to Broaders before their first show.
"We went in to do the show, and we
were all nervous going to do this thing. So
I walked into the booth and I looked up and
there was this naked girl standing up fiddling with some knobs," he said. "It was
like 'lmagine your audience naked,' except
I can attest
they weren't the audience
that at least one of them is definitely naked
during the show. I don't go in there before
our show anymore."
"Live Bait" welcomes performers in
any genre.

The hosts wanted their show to be somethe other radio

violin, guitar and vocals and plays mostly

The how-to of writing columns for The Phoenix
It's amazing how many people have asked us how we
actually go about writing our column. We just don't understand how three people can ask the exact same question

over the course of a year and a half. In honor of those three
people (Dave's mom, Alex Elkins 'O6 and Bob Gross '62), this
column is dedicated to the intricacies of our genial collabo-

rations.

Our hard work begins some time around 6 p.m. Monday,
at the earliest. We begin
by fighting about what
time we ought to write
the column. This, of
course, is mere formality, because neither of us
has anything to do. Once
a set time has been
agreed upon, we start 15
minutes
later.
Sometimes we drink,
sometimes we don't, but
r
it seems to be funnier

when we do, so cheers.
Then come the ideas.
EMILIANO RODRIGUEZ
may have
As you
Sobering Thoughts
noticed by the diversity
and richness of our topics, including this gem,
we have a limitless pool
of column ideas. The hard part is choosing exactly which
one to use. For example, just tonight, we were debating
between "Wouldn't it be cool ...," "Top 10 Stupidest Things

1

THE PHOENIX

Ever Witnessed in Our Lifetimes" and an expose on discriminatory hiring practices at Swarthmore entitled "What
the Hell Happened to Gerrit and Mac?" Clearly, this idea
won out, so here we are. The first sentence is always the
hardest, except for this one, which flowed like melted butter
on Jon's pecs. ("Fire the missiles!" in French accent.) We
would love to say that we map out the structure of our
columns, but our approach is more post-modern than classical. Right about now, some of our silly friends stop by to
distract us, but being that we are very much in the zone, we
dismiss them promptly.

We would love to say that we map
out the structure of our columns, but
our approach is more post-modern
than classical.
After the intro paragraph, we get to the meat, which is
generally as unsubstantial as the first sentence of the column. We pride ourselves on the fact that if you were to get
rid of all the unnecessary sentences, words, punctuation,
asides, curse words, gentrysmoms and other unnecessary
verbiage, we actuaUy produce about 150 words of content
(much like a SOAN paper). The typing is usually done by
Emiliano, as Jon's foreign status leaves him relatively unaccustomed to the complexities of American keyboards (and

February 19, 2004

he has fat fingers). However, Emiliano's control of the keyboard usually results in tangential sentences (read: really
stupid ideas), which are dismissed by Jon's towering presence with a quick "You suck," or "Um no." The process of
insulting potential sentences is the heart of our collective
writing efforts. Whoever said criticism should be constructive was full of shit. If we were nice to each other while we
wrote, our columns would surely be big loads of dung.
The process also usually includes plenty of self-censorship. We usually have to cut out the really, really, reaUy
good jokes because they offend just about everyone except
for us, and maybe Stobo, booauoo ho io a hoartlooo bitoh.
Usually, we cut out about 90 percent of our toilet humor,
leaving only the juiciest of farts in for reader consumption.
Right around 500 words, we almost always check the word
count. We consider ourselves to be congenial; always making sure The Phoenix doesn't have to make additional space
for our columns. Then we take a break.
Eventually we get to a conclusion. We usually give some
wonderfully sappy sentence to make you feel better about
yourself, like, "We hope you've gained some insight as to
how we go about writing our columns. It sure was fun
telling you." Really, though, we are laughing on the inside.
You just wasted five minutes of your life, and we will never
give it back. We end with some witty remark or some selfdeprecating insult. If we are feeling poor, we send a shout
out to Kohlberg so that we don't have to pay for coffee the
next morning, so, with that in mind, go Kohlberg!

Prison experiment. Students dressed as prisoners and
guards, living in a makeshift "jail" in the psych department's basement, began to believe their assigned roles to
such an extent that the proposed two-week experiment was

Opinions

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

■editorial

Sorting first-years
Dissatisfaction with campus life, especially among
first-years, is hard to analyze, being largely
subjective and dependent on a huge number of unpredictable personal factors. Even so, we feel that there
are many problems that can be traced to Housing
Committee's decisions this year.
This sort of problem seems to continually pop up,
given the competing goals Housing Committee juggles.
After all, first-years should be encouraged to meet and
interact with students different from themselves so
they can grow as students and as people. But they also
need to be able to spend most of their time around people with whom they're comfortable and can get along
with. Do you put partiers next to bookworms in order
to get the former to work harder and the latter to get
out more? Or do you create sets of matching roommates, knowing they'll be happier but that some rooms
might turn into hermitages while others become party
lounges?
For the fall of 2002, housing decisions definitely
erred on the side of the latter, letting Willets be Willets
and ML be ML to an unusual degree. This proved to be
a problem, as complaints mounted about the spiraling
explosion of late-night Willets partying and a generally
increasingly segregated campus.
Unfortunately, as with many delicate balances, we
worry that the deans have stepped too far in the other
direction this year. Yes, it's a good idea not to load
Willets with all the party animals among the incoming
first-years, but doing the opposite is a recipe for campus unrest. Forcing quiet, studious first-years to share
a hall with returning students who picked into Willets
while putting the socialites in the off-campus dorms
does not lead to many happy residents.
Dorm cultures exist, for better or for worse, and trying to change or even moderate them by brute force can
only lead to conflict. And many aspects of dorm culture
are simply unchangeable; those who want to wander
campus freely and mix with many different social
scenes will always find an ML or PPR room an impairment. Using first-years as dorm-life social engineering
tools, moreover, leads to first-years concentrating in
certain dorms and creating more homogeneous halls of
upperclassmen, hurting campus social life in general.
No first-year housing plan can be perfect, but in the
quest to juggle competing factors to create the perfect
campus, the deans should remember that the first priority in picking rooms for first-years is the first-years'
own statedpreferences on their survey forms. There are
broader considerations to take into account, but no
first-years should be forced to live in a situation opposite to the one they prefer simply for the good of the
hall.

Staying active: SC's political role
Dear Editor:
We are writing to respond to the staff editorial entitled
"Staying Neutral" (Feb. 12, p. 18). While we appreciate your
recognition of the successes that Student Council has worked
hard for over the past few years, we feel that the editorial
lacked a necessary understanding of the role of the council.

Together, we have nine semesters of experience on the
council, and now, with the ability to look back, we have the
knowledge and perspective to add to this discussion. We
believe the council should not necessarily always remain
neutral, and should be more rather than less active in taking
a stand on issues that are important to this campus.
The council exists to serve the students of the college
and to support them before the administration. In order to
fulfill this charge, it is necessary not only for the council to
neutrally support students by opening the lines of communication to the administration, but also to actively support
specific views

as it deems necessary. The council is often

too hesitant in approaching the latter, particularly on
controversial issues.
Over the past two years, the council has neutrally assisted the Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign,
primarily because it requested our support. We strongly
encourage more groups to approach Student Council and

take advantage of its resources and ability to communicate

with the administration. The campaign was not assisted
because the council was officially in support of the campaign
but only because they asked.
The council generally acts in a very neutral manner,
doing its best to represent all student views, avoid unnecessary conflicts with the.administration and continue to
work toward improving student life. However, there are
times when this is type of action is insufficient. While

politicizing issues should not be done lightly, there are
occasions when the issues are so important or so urgent
that surveys, petitions and fireside chats must be supplemented by decisive action.
The editorial board of The Phoenix seems to think that
the council lacks the authority to shape school policy on

controversial issues. We disagree. Members of the council
are elected by the entire student body to represent students
on all matters, large and small. While each member of
Council is elected to fulfill a specific position, they serve
primarily as members of a larger representative body. The
editorial staff writes that they "trust [Student Council's]
judgment in devising proposals to benefit the community."

While we appreciate their confidence, we feel that the editorial board ignores the fact that every time the council
implements these types of initiatives, it must first decide
that a program will benefit the majority of students. This is
exactly the type of decision The Phoenix criticizes, but it is
also the kind of decision that takes place every day.
Representation of student opinion is not something the

council should avoid
it's the council's job.
While we believe the council should take a more active
political role in our community, it must always work to forge
consensus. Taking a stand on important issues should not
preclude the council from acting in an unbiased manner. It
should continue to appoint a broad cross-section of the
student community to committees and help forge an all-

inclusive community.
We do not agree with the editorial's assertion that students blindly elect their student representatives. However, if
the editorial is correct, then students should know that the
council speaks for them, in their voice, to the administration
and the community. Students should pick their representatives with this in mind and ask questions about relevant
issues before voting. A larger and more intensive question-

ing of candidates would be beneficial to all.
We encourage the current the council to actively voice

an opinion on the issue of the living wage. The council

must take stands on issues that are important to all students and help convey student opinion to the administration. That is what representation is about, and that is the
duty of Student Council.

Opposition to living wage elitist
Dear Editor:
As an alum, I was moved by Garth SheldonCoulson's "Think before signing living wage pledge"
or "Living Wage: Me,
opinion piece (Feb. 12, pg. 20)
Myself and I." This first-year student's perfectly satirical piece touched upon the key arguments against a
living wage: "Will giving
others what they deserve t
hinder my access to wealth

and privilege? In addition
to having a Swarthmore
degree, will I have enough
tools to succeed in this
world?" To these important questions, I respond,
"Rest assured, people: We

this writer's depiction, a living wage is neither a
handout nor a magical passport to social mobility. A
living wage would allow people to work and care for
their families, have time to meet their educational
goals and have access to health care at a very basic
level.
And contrary to the
remarks, the

denying our staff a living
wage says to them, "Your
work is not important
enough to grant you the
basic rights and privi-

leges

will be OK."

Joking aside, I'd like to move on to one of SheldonCoulson's remarks about the terrifying consequences
of a living wage at Swarthmore:
"Our current staff would, over time, be replaced by
more skilled or experienced workers
not a bad
thing for us students, but a very bad thing for our current staff and others from their socioeconomic level.
Isn't it them we're trying to help?"

Sheldon-Coulson's remarks smack of the elitism
that underlies criticism of a living wage. Contrary to

that most of us

enjoy."
As a student, I witnessed a mighty snowstorm at
Swarthmore. With over two feet of snow on the

ground, all offices were closed and classes were
"optional." Most of the staff went home. The coffee bar
was closed, and the snack bar was closed. It was dinnertime. I walked down to Sharpies and was touched
to see the staff: They had driven out from their homes
just to feed us.

Give us time to consider campaign pledge
Most signers not fully informed about complex living wage issue
Dear Editor:

I'd like to thank Garth SheldonCoulson 'O7 for his opinion piece

regarding the issue of a living
wage here at Swarthmore ("Think
before signing living wage pledge,"
Feb. 12, pg. 20). We absolutely do
have a responsibility to more thoroughly investigate all aspects of
this issue, especially given the
huge impact this decision will have
on the college. The way in which
student support was gathered (i.e.,
the distribution of pledges in
Sharpies) was not the best way to
have gone about gauging student
support, as many of the signers
(myself included) may not have

been as informed as they (we)
should have been before making

such a commitment.
I think a better way of gauging
student support for or opposition
to such a measure would be to
redistribute such pledges after a
large discussion or debate of the
issue (as in, ignore those already
signed), so that there is at least
some way to reasonably expect that
those signing have heard the pros
and cons of the proposal rather
than just the arguments of their
friends tabling in Sharpies.
Otherwise, the pledges are virtualmeaningless. Additionally, I
urge all members of the college
ly

community to inform themselves
about this issue before weighing

in. It would be highly irresponsible

for us to try to force the administration into adopting or rejecting a
policy whose possible effects we
have failed to adequately consider.
I personally cannot say that I

am definitely for or against the
proposal, as I do not yet know

enough about it to decide. I thus
regret having signed something
without being properly informed
beforehand and would like the
opportunity to withdraw my pledge
of support until I am in a better
position to make such a decision.

Living wage campaigners too aggressive
Pushy advertising waste of resources, disrespectful to dissenting opinions
Dear Editor:
I came home to Dana this weekend to find a statement from the Swarthmore Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign, along with a reminder of meeting times, pushed under my door and into my room. I
nearly stepped on it.
Putting the issue of the living wage aside for a
moment, I would like to address the inappropriateness
of the campaign. The

Conscious chocoholic
I like chocolate
I also like to consider myself a
conscious consumer. I drink fairtrade coffee, try to avoid sweatshop sweaters and think at least
twice before buying those sixpacks of underwear from WalMart. If I had a car, I swear I'd
trade Genuardi's for Trader Joe's.
Yet recently, my affinity for
chocolate and my affinity for
thinking of myself as a good person came to heads. Right in time
for the V-Day binge, Co-op
America published an expose:
MAYA SCHENWAR
Apparently, 70 percent of the
world's chocolate comes from
Swat Meets World
plantations in the Ivory Coast,
Nigeria and Cameroon that traffic in large-scale child labor.
Monitoring is practically impossible. When inspectors
from the International Labour Organization and other international organizations arrive to inspect the plantations, owners can always pretend that the enslaved children are members of their own family. And even when slavery is discovered, it's not a piece of (devil's food) cake to regulate: Farmers
blame big-name suppliers who keep cocoa at unnaturally low
prices; middlemen blame corrupt government officials; government officials blame foreigners for bringing slaves into
the state.
Much of the chocolate that isn't linked with slavery is still
produced at the cost of perpetuating a devastating cycle of
poverty in West Africa. The average cocoa farmer earns only
$6O-$lOB per year from cocoa. This way, chocolate corporations like M&M/Mars can afford to keep prices low and still
rake in huge profits. Yum?
So what to do? Some say buying fair-trade chocolate is the
way to go. Companies that display the Fair Trade Certified
label are bound to provide a fair price for their goods, main
tain healthy working conditions and lend financial and educa
tional support to their communities. Sweet.
Or not. We tried to make the switch to fair trade hot choco
late in my house last month. It was a noble gesture, a concert
ed effort to foster social responsibility in our everyday choic
es that in the end make the most difference toward creating
more just society. It lasted about three days.
"I don't know," my dad said. "The slave hot chocolate jus
tastes better." And you know what? It does.
It brings up that age-old dilemma
what happens when
what you want to do and what you should do aren't the same
thing? Sleep or study? Steal the dry-erase marker from across
the hall or schlep to the bookstore to buy your own? Rent
"Schindler's List" or "Legally Blonde 2"? Get a tissue or pick
your nose? Yep, I thought so.
Maybe part of the problem is the concept of choice. In his
recent book, "The Paradox of Choice," Swat psychology professor Barry Schwartz points out that American society is
flooded with more product choices than we could ever possibly
want or need. This phenomenon is multiplied by a zillion on
the chocolate front. When I got back from Italy in January, I
discovered that there were now black-white-gray M&M minis,
peanut-butter Twix bars, Midnight Milky Ways and a suspicious new vitamin-filled Snickers bar dubbed "Marathon."
And people at CVS were buying all of them.
As I struggled to reconcile myself with my preference for
"slave hot chocolate" over the one brand of Fair Trade cocoa
offered at Whole Foods, I was staring at a drugstore shelf full
of 75 different species of chocolate-covered nougat.
It seems that if there are going to be more choices, it
shouldn't just be about inventing Reese's bars that taste like
Twix and Butterfingers that are just another version of
Snickers. Choice should be about production, not just product.
If I want a decent-tasting cup of non-slave cocoa, I should be
able to get it, damn it.
Also, I should be able to get it without driving to
Northampton, Mass., or even to Trader Joe's. Swarthmore
might do well to incorporate its old "ethical intelligence"
motto into the economic decisions offered to us every day ...
like what Sharpies, Tarble and Kohlberg fare we pop into our
bodies. If fair trade products were offered in the coffee bars on
campus, we'd have the option to forego fueling the international slave trade, at least sometimes.
After all, I never liked Coke until my taste buds self-adapted after being forced to tolerate it at enough McDonald's birthday parties. Maybe, non-slave hot chocolate-drinking could
work the same way. Come on, Dining Services. Give it a shot.

Popping those pop-ups

It's been a banner week
news about unwanted

annoyances.

Microsoft vowed to remove
all pop-up ads from its MSN
Web sites this week, the latest
in a growing trend shying away
from these, the kings of
Internet irritations.

instead getting a monitor full of
"Hot naked babes! XXX! Click

What always mystified me about the pop-ups, though, was
that respectable, legitimate sites use them, too. While The
New York Times typically goes for airline ticket purveyors
instead of hardcore porn, the pop-ups are equally irritating.
What possessed marketers at The New York Times or

Pop-up blockers are growing in popularity.
Download.com suggests that well over 5 million copies of popup blockers have been downloaded from its servers. While
Google Toolbar is certainly the most common, Download.com
lists over 100 such applications, of varying utility. Even programs that do nothing but block pop-ups show download
totals in the range of 500,000.
If you don't have a pop-up blocker, Google Toolbar is a
good one; unsurprisingly, it also lets you search Google. If
you're using any browser other than Internet Explorer, of
course, your browser has a pop-up blocker built in. If you
want my recommendations, Mac users, try Safari; Windows
users, get Mozilla Firefox.
Being a natural pessimist, though, I wonder what's around
the corner for online advertisements. Somewhat surprisingly,
online advertising is the fastest-growing sector of the ad biz,
despite declining sales from such ads. There is clearly an
enormous group of people to be marketed to on the Internet,
but the best way of doing it still evidently eludes advertising
firms. The latest trend is toward Flash ads (now that
Macromedia Flash is installed on 97 percent of computers on
the Internet), which move, interact and, occasionally, make
noise.
This, I fear, is going to be the next trend of pop-ups.
work.

Instead of ads that get your attention by blocking the screen,
the next generation of advertisements will call to you from
the speakers, using sound effects, music or voice. Some of
them exist already, advertising anything from hairdryers to
printers. Some even have small (often very jerky) movies.
There are more insidious things, too, like ads that cover
the screen and slide out of the way after a few moments
(Amazon.com has been known to use these, but they're not
Safari-compatible, so I don't know if they still do.) Expect
these sorts of things to grow more common and more irritating if online advertisements continue their striking rise.
They're expected to double in volume by 2007.
What can we do?
First of all, never click on one. Companies do listen to
their profit lines, and if the ads don't move profit, they will go
away. As they grow more annoying, tools (like pop-up blockers) will no doubt arise to stop them, too. Use them. Get your
friends to use them. If you feel more active about it, complain

to webmasters.

But until the rise of the Internet audio ad, we should take
comfort. There will always be spam. If you're lucky, you
might even get a voice-mail.

Iraq: separate sharia and state
Having liberated the

Iraqi

people

from
Saddam Hussein, the

RANDY GOLDSTEIN

United States now has
the obligation of ensuring the creation of a
solid foundation for sustainable Iraqi civil law.
Mohsen Abdel-Hamid,
the president of the
Governing Council of
Iraq and hard-line Sunni
Muslim, wishes to make
Islamic law the "principal basis" of future Iraqi
legislation.
Fortunately,

Bursting the Bubble

the
United States administrator of Iraq, L. Paul
Bremer, declared this week that he would not permit an
interim Iraqi Constitution to be structured around
Islamic law.
Iraqi democracy need not be identical to American
democracy. American and Iraqi cultures are fundamentally different, and such differences will naturally
be reflected in the creation of Iraqi law. That said, it
would behoove Iraqi lawmakers to take a cue from the
American founders regarding an appropriate and sustainable level of religious undertones in the creation of
i^hh^

a constitution.
There is no

question that the American
Constitution is predicated on Christian values. The
notion of our nation's place under God is deeply
ingrained in our system of government. It is not the
case, however, that American law recognizes that
those who are not Christians are damned to hell for

eternity. While the spirit of Christianity seeped into

our Constitution as it was written by founders who
were overwhelmingly Christian, Christianity did not
become the law of the land.
So too must Islam not become the law of Iraq. The
Iraqi people have been freed of a ruthless tyrant. That
tyrant's rule must not be replaced with an Islamic sysFebruary 19, 2004

tern of government that could ultimately be even more
detrimental to individual freedoms.

Sharia, the Islamic law upon which certain members of the Governing Council of Iraq wish to base the
interim constitution, is not in the best interest of the
Iraqi people. Under sharia-based systems in other
countries, women have been denied freedoms that are
taken for granted elsewhere in the world. They may
not learn to read or write, are limited in their ability
to own property and are not permitted to divorce without the consent of their husbands.
Lest one brush off sharia as ancient law that has
succumbed to modern times, take the immediately relevant example of the Taliban. When the Taliban ruled
Afghanistan under sharia, women were publicly tortured and their bodies mutilated for being accused of
crimes so heinous as painting their fingernails or
revealing their faces in public. This is nothing, however, compared to the women who were beheaded in
crowded soccer stadiums for committing adultery.
Beyond simply proposing a sharia backbone for the
interim constitution, the Governing Council of Iraq
has attempted to enact de facto Islamic rule. In
December, the council passed legislation that would
effectively nullify Iraq's 1959 Law of Personal Status,
which granted Iraqi women many freedoms regarding
divorce, inheritance and child support. Had Bremer
approved the council's legislation, it would have given
religious groups in Iraq the power to apply their own
tradition as law. To allow the historically warring factions of Iraq to each impose its own religious law
would be counterproductive, at best.
The United States must ensure that fundamentalist
Islam does not become law in Iraq. It is in no one's
interest for Iraq to resemble most other Arab nations
in the region. The future success of Iraq hinges on its
ability to transcend its neighbors and seize this opportunity for a new beginning. If Islam is truly a religion
of peace, then one hopes that this peace becomes
apparent in the Iraqi Constitution. That constitution,
however, must not become an image of sharia.

Snorts
Stuck in the middle

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Last week was a bad one for sports. To be honest, this
whole month is a bad month for sports. The time
between the Super Bowl and March Madness is a veritable sports wasteland. Sports-related phenomena during the month of February fall into two categories: the
boring and the miserable. In the boring we have the grueling NBA and NHL seasons. Playoff basketball is great
and playoff hockey is transcendent, but the regular sea
sons just seem malicious. How many more games do th
Atlanta Hawks really have to play, anyway? Thei

under the weight of the

Speaking of the miserable, the rest of the
February sports world
pretty much fits into it.
In baseball, we have two
evils competing to ruin
the sport fastest: steroids
and the Yankees. It
doesn't take a genius to
BEN WHARTON
notice that baseball's

Half Mental
problem for years. Now,
however, baseball has a
genuine scandal going.
Barry Bonds, who could simply be the best offensive
baseball player of the last decade, seems to have this
personal trainer who's helped him bulk up to the point
where he can hit 73 home runs in a season. And this personal trainer seems to have been indicted for running
an "illegal drug distribution operation." This is all the
fallout of the investigation into the Bay Area Lab
Cooperative, or BALCO, after an unidentified track
coach turned over a syringe of the new designer steroid
THG to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. All this obviously
looks bad for baseball, but hopefully it'll help shed light
on the mysterious second growth spurt that helped so
many lean lead-off hitter types hit, uh, 73 home runs.
And now, on to the Yankees. The bad news is that
they now have Alex Rodriguez. As we write this, there
are preliminary reports that they may be picking up
Greg Maddux as well. Our last few days have been spent
doing three things: 1) cussing a lot, 2) whining how it's
not fair, 3) wishing to the utmost for that greatest of
fairies, the Athlete Motorcycle Accident Fairy, to pay a
certain short
er, third baseman a visit. Oh, whatever,
while we're feeling generous, how 'bout a visit for Jeter,
too? But seriously, folks, this sort of thing is not fair. It
threatens to turn baseball into a big business. Oh,
whoops. We mean it threatens to turn us into a serial
killer. But all is not lost. To restate the cliche, there are
still 162 games to go, and a lot of screeching, burning
and amputating can still happen.
Now, where, you ask us, does college basketball fall
into all of this boredom and misery? To be honest, it
doesn't. Not in the general sense. This year's college
basketball season has been consistently exciting and
fulfilling. Which is to say it's been supremely frustrating. You see, we're a University of North Carolina
Tarheel fan who lives in Maryland. Yes, we know it's
not right, but not everything about us fits into a convenient little package. Anyway, living in the State of
Pleasant Living concurs the benefit of an ACC television broadcast package. To be blunt, back in high school
we were watching four or five ACC games a week. Now
we're lucky to see that many in a season. So, while the
current college basketball season is neither boring nor
miserable, it is still irritating.
We'll close by mentioning the strongest evidence that
February is the most miserable of sports month. Last
week we turned to the sports section of our favored
news rag only to find a column written about the
Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. For some reason,
stories about the dog show consistently run in the
sports pages. Please, please keep the dog show off our
sports pages. We don't know how much more we can
take.

Badminton takes second at Northeast Collegiate Championships
Ay Jy Phoun 'O4 attacks the net during a badminton rally. On Sunday, the Garnet hosted the Northeast Collegiate
Championships in Tarble Pavilion. The team finished second in the tournament with 34 total points. Howard prevailed with 100 team points to take the team title. UPenn, Princeton, BrynMawr and Albright finished in that
order behind Howard and the Garnet. Although Howard dominated the day, winning all five events (men's and
women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles), the Garnet had a good showing by many
team members. In the women's singles event, four Tide women, Laurel Beesemyer 'O4, Surbhi Gupta 'O4, Ay Jy
Phoun 'O4 and Jessica Larson 'O6, all finished in the quaterfinals. Teammates Anjali Aggarwal 'O6 and Candice
Cherk 'O7 performed well in the doubles bracket, earning a spot in the semi-final round. Their sucess qualifies
them for the National Badminton Tournament this spring. Andrew Sniderman 'O6 fell in the finals of men's singles but also earned a trip to Nationals. The team is 2-0 in season play and will travel to Bryn Mawr tonight to

take on the rival Owls.

the win, even though we've shot over 40 percent only once

Gustafson said he believed the team played up to its
potential. "We have been able to beat the teams we shouk
beat this year," he said. "One key factor in our recent sue

the stretch. This stems from veteran leadership and confi

The Garnet have three regular season games left, the
next of which is an away game at Washington. "Given the
teams currently in the playoff hunt, I feel that we have the

Women sink, men swim into conferences
BY MATT SCHILLER

mschilll@swarthmore.edu

In the final meet leading up to this year's Centennial
Conference Championships, the Garnet Tide swim teams
brought home mixed results. The men fared well, riding
five double winners to a 127-76 victory over the Shoremen
of Washington College. The women had less success,
falling to Washington 122-83.
After two straight losses, the men's team turned things
around early on Wednesday night, winning six of its first
seven races. The men began by taking first in the 200-medley relay with a time of 1:44.66, thanks to the first-year
foursome of Jon Augat, Jason Horwitz, Andrew Koczo and
Anders Taylor.
The men stayed strong in the freestyle events, sweeping the top three positions in the 1,000 and capturing wins
in the 200 and 50, as well. In the 1,000, Ben Morgan 'O5 blew
away the competition, finishing first with a time of
10:46.29, followed by Rob McKeon 'O7 at 11:09.98 and Seth
Jacobsen 'O4 at 11:30.86. The shorter distances were far
more competitive. In the 200, Horwitz squeezed out a win
by seven-hundredths of a second, touching the wall at
1:49.55, and Koczo and Augat finished one-two in the 50 at
23.23 and 23.3
L
"Jason Horwitz was a big-time standout. He's been
very consistent all year, but this was an excellent swim
for him," coach Sue Davis said.

The Garnet men cemented their win by dominating the
100 freestyle with another sweep of the podium. Mike
Auerbach 'O5 breezed to the finish in a time of 49.56, followed by Andrew McKay 'O7 at 53.75 and Darshan Patel 'O5
at 54.58. Taylor added to the win total, crossing the pool
fastest in the 100 butterfly at 58.32 with Aaron Modic 'O4
right behind him to snatch second at 58.75. To round
things off, Swarthmore's 200 freestyle relay team of Augat,
McKay, Morgan and Auerbach swam away with the race,
winning in 1:33.93.
Augat, Koczo, Horwitz, Morgan and Taylor were all
double winners to move the Garnet (4-6, 3-3 CC) into
fourth place.
"We went in knowing we would win because of
Washington's lack of depth. Washington's men swam an
excellent meet; they just don't have a lot of guys.
Everyone's been swimming excellently against us. I was
quite pleased with the way everyone swam," coach Davis
said. "It was cool to end the season with a win."
The women had more trouble with their opponent, as
only one swimmer garnered double-winner status.
Melanie Johncilla 'O5 won the 200 freestyle in 2:00.65, and
teammates Katherine Reid 'O5 and Patricia Funk 'O6
rounded out the top three at 2:02.43 and 2:04.32. Johncilla
emerged victorious a second time as she led the 400
freestyle relay team with Funk, Reid and Martyna
Pospieszalska 'O6 to first place at 3:48.20.
The loss dropped the women to 6-4 overall and 3-4 in

Centennial Conference, putting them in fifth place heading into conferences. Coach Davis attributed the team's

three straight losses to the tough competition. "Three
weeks ago, I said, 'The last three duel meets are going to
be the hardest of the season.' Dickinson swam outstanding

us. Washington was outstanding, too. They like to
beat us," she said. "We had a good meet; they were just
against

better and faster."
The conference meet is shaping up to be an interesting
one. The women will try to sneak into the top three
against swimmers from Gettysburg, Dickinson, Franklin
and Marshall and Washington, who all defeated the Tide
earlier this year.
"I think we're in pretty good shape right now as far as
our expectations," Tara Finley 'O6 said. "We put up a good
fight against Gettysburg and Franklin and Marshall earlier this season. We definitely have a chance of beating

them."

The men face similar challenges from conference powers Dickinson, Franklin and Marshall and Gettysburg. As
long as they swim well and avoid sickness, they have a
good shot at finishing the season as one of the three best

in the conference.
"Hopefully, we can just swim faster than we've been
doing. Everyone usually drops their times, so we need to
step up and swim well," Auerbach said.
Conference Championships are Feb. 19-22 at Franklin
and Marshall.

Junior distance runner breaks 3,000-meter record set by more than a second
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Competing against runners from Division I
universities, the men's and women's indoor track
teams emerged with several notable victories on
Saturday, including personal bests and one
smashing of a school record.
At the Boston University Valentine Invite,
Garrett Ash 'O5 not only placed 35th in the men's
3K, running against some of the top runners in the
country, but he also broke the school record set in
2001. The previous record time for the men's
indoor 3K was 8:45.41, set by runner Marc Jeuland
'Ol, who also held records in events including the
5K and 10K.
Ash sped around the Boston University indoor
track to set the new record at 8:43.91. Ash was running on pace for a 4:40 mile for 3,000 meters, or
about LB6 miles.
Ash didn't approach the race any differently
than he had in the past. "The only thing unique
about Saturday was the pace [Coach Pete Carroll]
told me to run happened to be fast enough to set a
school record," Ash said.
Keefe Keeley 'O6, who also ran the 3K, said it
was "a real treat to be in the same race with
Garrett breaking the school record."
"I think many people hold the misconception
that heralded athletic performances sort of come
'out of the blue,' like they are divinely inspired or
something," Ash said. "I think the reality is that
major acheivements come the same way as small
ones do: as a result of the athlete having focused
training and good coaching."
Vernon Chaplin 'O7 and Keeley also had outstanding weekends at the Boston meet. In his first
year of collegiate racing, Chaplin earned a personal best in the men's 800 meter, decreasing his
previous personal best time by about a second and
a half, to 1:58.06. This time placed Chaplin at 46th
among other skilled runners.
"It was really cool to be at the meet competing
against some incredibly fast runners from
Division I and from around the world. One runner
from Jamaica who came to compete [not attached
to a school] ran a 400 about a second off the world
record," Chaplin said.

later, at Boston, Keeley ran this event in 9:03.15.
"I had a personal goal to break into the top 10
of the school record for the 3K at the Boston meet.
I knew that I needed to shave about 12 seconds off
my time to do that. Fortunately, I did it, with a
couple more seconds than expected," Keeley said.
"We've been building a good solid distance base
all through the winter, picking up the intensity of
workouts throughout the season, so, as we get
near the end, our work is all paying off."
"The distance combined with speed work
makes for very good preparation," he added. "I
trained more intensely through the winter this
approximately 17

year. Also, some of the fitness from cross-country

helped."
Keeley's new time places him in the top 10 for
the school record. Four of Swarthmore's top 10
runners in the 3K are on the current team: Ash
tops that list, and his teammates James Golden
'O5, Lang Reynolds 'O5 and now Keeley are on the
list as well. This bodes well for next year's track
and cross-country teams, since none of these four

runners are seniors this year.
On the women's side, Carrie Ritter 'O6 placed
27th in the IK with a personal best time of 3:17.66.
Sarah Hobbs 'O6 earned a personal best in the
mile, with a time of 5:20.94, placing 48th overall.
"The Boston meet is always great, because we
have top runners to race against and push us in
our events so that we can prepare for conferences.
Usually, if we are going to earn a personal best, we
will do it here," Hobbs said.
Pam Davis 'O7 ran a personalbest in the mile,
with a time of 5:47.07, as did Emily Wistar 'O6 in
the 800, with a time of 2:28.22.
The runners feel confident about their upcoming meet at Haverford's home track on Sunday,
Feb. 22.
"I am in the best shape of my life, and I am
very excited for the final meets of the season,"
Chaplin said. "The distance team is very strong,
and although the sprint team is coming back from
injuries, hopefully they will come back and be
able to place in conferences."

Rounding Third
mmmmmm^^^^^^^m

misses a free throw and rolling his eyes
at every turnover, Wimberly deserves
much credit for coaching the team into
surprising playoff contention this year.
And for giving Passmore more minutes.
Wimbo also has two smelly dogs who
roam the field house at their leisure,
stinking up the carpets and anybody who

happens to walk by.
7. Renee Clarke. Renee is the new and
energetic coach of the softball team who

is very enthusiastic about the upcoming
season and has nothing but praise for her
players. Earlier this week, I was watching video of my baseball swing
when Renee casually walked in the office and started point out things ]
was doing wrong. Anybody willing to give me crap deserves some sort of
praise, so nice job, Renee. The only bad thing I have to say about Renee is
that she didn't accept my IM soccer team's roster because "supposedly" it
was submitted too late. I think she was just scared we'd run the table,
crush the faculty team and win the league.
6. Adrienne Shibles. Adrienne deserves to be higher on the list, but
I've lost touch with her over the last two years. Nevertheless, she has
built the girl's basketball team into a perennial conference powerhouse
and her team's strong defense has instilled fear in opposing coaches
minds. The best thing about Adrienne is that her team loves her to death
and for the second time in three years she has remained on the sideline
while many months pregnant. There's nothing better than watching her
yell at the refs over a call then go sit down on the bench and pat her round
stomach, making sure the baby is OK.
4(T)
Eric Wagner and Amy Brunner. The soccer coaches tie for
fourth on the list. Amy is a sports fanatic who plays ice hockey, among
other sports, in her spare time. Growing up, she played everything anc
was an All-America goalie in college. Since she's a huge Red Sox fan, it's
easy to feel sorry for Amy as the Sox continue to lose year in and year out
If you like sports, it's very hard to find fault with Amy. Eric is only in his
second year as the men's coach, but started producing major results
toward the end of last season. With a strong recruiting class for next year
watch for the team to make waves in the conference. If you aren't famil
iar with Eric, you might recognize him from the "Child's Play" movies
where he starred at a young age as Chucky. And though he may deny the
accusation, he is clearly a clone of Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden. Most
importantly, Eric likes baseball.
2(T)
Mark Duzenski and Karen Borbee. At first thought, one
might feel bad for Karen having to share the second spot with Mark, but
the two are both great people and great coaches. Mark is the legendary
lefty golf coach and the school's SID who lurks around the field house late
at night sending out e-mails reporting the school's (lack of) athletic sue
cesses. His knowledge of sports is vast, and his dry humor coincides nice
ly with mine. Mark is so good on the golf course, in fact, that he holds as
many Major titles as Phil Mickelson. Karen is the women's lacrosse coach
who likes to have outside practices when the thermometer is in single
digits. She's also the assistant AD and incredibly down to earth. Most
importantly, Karen has two great kids. Anyone who has met the ram
bunctious Jessica or the quiet Jack knows that life in the Borbee house
hold should serve as a model to most families. If Karen were still in col
lege, I think I would ask her on a date.
1. Pete Carroll. Pete is the running coach, whether it's track, cross
country or any of the other assorted boring events that I would never, ever
participate in. If you've ever heard Pete talk, you know he's by far the fun
niest coach here, and if you've ever seen him play pickup basketball, you
know it's quite evident why he never latched on to that sport. Pete is also
the baldest coach at Swarthmore. This led him two years ago to buy a gold
en retriever so that the amount of hair in his house would be equivalent
to the amount of hair in the houses of other Swarthmore coaches.
As Kornheiser would say, that's it. That's the list.
Carlton
Davis is a senior. You can reach him a
