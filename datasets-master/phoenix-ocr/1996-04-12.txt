Coffee Bar in Kohlberg Drawing Many Customers, Including Some Regulars
By

Fred Bush

Business is good at the coffee bar.
"Mondays are slow," said Joe
Henderson, who works the bar with
Cherie Breischaft, "Tuesdays and
Thursdays are busy, and Wednes-

days and Fridays are about average."
The coffee bar does about $3OO worth
of business on a good day.
As for who's been drinking coffee,
"V ve seen maybe 1/4of the campus,"
and it's been "about 60/40" students
to professors at thecoffee bar. There' s
more to come: "as soon as they finish
up the landscaping, I think we'll see
a lot more business," said Henderson.

For professors and administrators,
the coffee bar has become a place to
hang out. Henderson overheard a professor say that the coffeebar was "the
first chance he got to socialize with
students." Though only a few weeks
old, the coffee bar already has its
share of staff and faculty regulars.
Some students have already become regulars as well. Brantley
Bryant '99 and Rachel Buurma '99
said they came down "three or four
times a week."
Buurma said, "It keeps me from
wanting to commit suicide in the

morning."
But is the coffee bar fun? "Friday

was pretty bustling, with the opening
of the Language Resource Center;
we had a lot of people come down for
that," said Joe. As for ordinary days,
they're "really fun; I meet lots of
different people coming through
here."
However, Buurma had one complaint: "You can't smoke in here!
You can't smoke in here!" Bryant
solemnly agreed, as he slowly tapped
a cigarette, to be smoked outside of
Kohlberg, a smoke-free building.
Tony Sturm '99 adds, "I find that
room absolutely beautiful yet I wonder how much the College spent on
those massive granite coffee tables

and fancy abstract lights."
The coffee bar continues to receive
complaints about its hours, said Joe.
To avoid competition with Paces, it
clones at 5 p.m., an unusual hour for
a place that serves coffee.
Both Buurma and Bryant agreed
that they'd visit the coffee bar were it
open at night, as long as they could
smoke. Next year, the bar plans to
expand its hours, perhaps with students doling out the Java, said
Henderson.
Student criticism has already had
an effect on the menu, when a recent
Phoenix editorial brought hot cocoa
to the menu.

Diversity is often on the minds of
members of the Swarthmore community. Students and faculty alike
anticipated thestatistics on theethnic
backgrounds of the students accepted
into the Class of 2000. The sit-in
sponsored by Student Council earlier
this semester also spawned questions
such as, "How can we make Swarthmore more diverse?" and "Is the College really committed to having a
diverse student body?" even as issues
of socioeconomic diversity were often confused with issues ofracial and
ethnic diversity. Participants at a

A Sign of Spring: Adirondacks on Parrish Beach

Panels Will Examine Ways to Enhance Academic Program and Foster Cultural Diversity
Kate Bernstein

This Spring, faculty and students
will begin working on an all College
Planning Process to take a hard look
at all areas of the school and begin
long term planning for change. PresidentBloom decided to start this process to "set several priorities which
will best enable Swarthmore to build
on its distinctive values and strengths
and to be the finest institution we can
imagine as it enters the 21st Century."
The planning process is being
launched within the academic program. Educational issues are the first
step in a variety of different areas.
Bloom hopes that the directions proposed in the academic program will
outline the overall agenda.

Later this semester, a series ofpanels will take place where faculty and
students can voice their concerns
about current educational programs.
To date, eight panels have been

planned.
One panel will consist of the Provost and Council on Educational

Policy (CEP), another, Student Council, and five panels will accommodate a diverse grouping of faculty
members. A panel will also take place
to discuss ideas raised by SASS at the
25th anniversary of the Black Cultural Center. The series will culminate in a discussion group between
faculty and students.
During the summer the CEP will
draft a proposal regarding academic
programs, drawing on this Spring's
discussions and reports submitted by

planning committees over the past
years. A separate committee will also
form to defineconcrete planning goals
and identify which areas of the educational program should be priorities. In the fall, CPC will open the
planning process to all areas of the
College by presenting its conclusions
to the community.
Provost Jennie Keith noted that
Planning groups for next Spring will
tackle issues of the role of interdisciplinary studies, education for the international world, how to sustain the
role ofteacher and scholar, education
for social responsibilities, and academic excellence for the future.
"With that proposal acting as a
pointer to possible directions for the
academic program, CPC in consultation with the Board of Managers will

design an institutional process for
considering, within a two year frame,
a wider range of institutional planning issues, including, but not limited to, financial aid, technology, the
summer facility use, thefuture size of
the College, possible new facilities,
the College's continuing commitment
to increased representation of cultural diversity in the faculty, student
body and staff, and the financial context in which all of these must be
integrated," Bloom said.
When asked if a capital campaign
is being planned, the President commented that no specific fund-raising
camDaiens have vet been developed
but "priorities are certainly likely to
emerge from the planning process for
which the College will want and need
to raise funds."

Kohlberg Courtyard to Become Horticultural Attraction
By

Ben Salter

Now that most of the construction
on Kohlberg Hallhas been completed,
the workers are beginning to add the

finishing touches, most noticeably
the work on the courtyard in front of
the Admissions Office. The courtyard will be named the Isabelle B.
Cosby Courtyard. Cosby, Swarthmore class of '2B, was the principle
donor for the project.
Director of GroundsJeff Jabco says
that the masons are currently finishing up work on the stone walls and
columns in the courtyard, and that the
soil needs to be graded and irrigated.
Jabco hopes that the project will be
mostly completed by commencement,
but that work will continue on through
next fall.
The current muddy

holes will soon

be filled with trees, shrubs and perennials, Jabco says. Planting has been
delayed because the late spring affected many nurseries, as well as delaying the construction. The side of
Kohlberg facing DuPont will be
planted last, says Jabco, since that
side is the only remaining access for
construction vehicles.
"People are really anxious to see
whatit looks like," says Jabco. "Many
people are wondering whether there
will be benches in the courtyard." He
assures students that there will be

plenty ofbenches for people to sit on.
Claire Sawyers, Director of the
Scott Arboretum, says that the walls
and walkways that are now being
built in the courtyard were originally
going to be done in the fall, but weren't
completed because of bad weather.
"Some of the horticultural features
of the courtyard," Sawyers says, "will
be plants in containers, including large
earth-colored 'jardinieres,' gray metal
barrels known as French dyeing barrels, and an old copper kettle found at
an antique show." There will also be
a collection of vines that will climb
the columns.Several varieties ofvines
with different flowering seasons will
be planted to "give a sense of change
from year to year, and a sense of
color. The columns give a chance to
display different kinds of vines in a

the Arboretum to bring a new variety
of landscape plants to campus." She
describes the style of design as "intense horticulture."

kind of dramatic way."
According to Sawyers, the combination of trees, shrubs, and ground
cover will "seem very lively." The
courtyard will include a bamboo
patch, a plant Sawyers says is very
underrepresented on campus, as well
as Japanese umbrella pines and threeflowered maples. There will also be a
lawn panel close to Parrish, and arow
of trees along the edge to enclose the
courtyard, planted with a mosaic of

perennials.
"I think it's very exciting," said
Sawyers. "It's a great opportunity for

A Phoenix investigation has revealed that the College telephone
system is in violation ofFederal rules
regarding access to long-distance
carriers and to rate schedules.
According to Kurt Schroeder of
the Federal Communications Commission, telephone service providers
like Swarthmore, known as
"aggregators," are required to provide access to long-distance carriers—known as operator service providers, or OSPs—through so-called
lOxxx access codes. But according to
Mark Dumic, Manager of Networking and Systems, the College recently
discontinued lOxxx service due to
difficulties with billing the calls and
the possibility that the system would

The coffee itself is provided by a
Philadelphia company, La Colombe,
that supplies several of the finer restaurants in the Philly downtown. No
one yet has complained of the coffee;
the prices, on the other hand, have
drawn some criticism.
Henderson defends the prices as
comparable to those in nearby cafes
and Borders. Buurma and Bryant both
agreed that the coffee was "better
than Tarble coffee, and comparable
to gourmet restaurants in the area."In
any case, whether it's the coffee, the

lege could live up to its commitment
made in the early seventies to ensure
that at least ten percent of the student
population would be composed of
African-Americans.
Since this is an issue of such importance, The Phoenix will be running a series of articles exploring the
differences of opinion which exist
about the College's commitment to
diversity, both in the Admissions
Office and the institution as a whole.
According to Director of Admissions Susan Untereker, 202 students
who identified themselves as African-Americans applied for a place in
the Class of 2000 and 131 students, or
65 percent, were accepted. Among
those who identified themselves as
Latino, 128 students, or 76 percent,
were accepted from a pool of 168. Of
455 Asian-Americans who applied,
144, or 32 percent, were accepted.
These figures do not necessarily incorporate students who have chosen
to identify themselves as being of
mixed race or who have selected the
"other" category to designate their
{Continued on page 2}

Dining Services, in charge of the
coffee bar, is considering all the comments it receives. "Things might not
be acted on this year, but maybe next
year," said Henderson. "Everything
is heard; if you have keen ideas, suggest them."
The coffee bar showsother signs of
being in the midst of change. Shiny
brass shelves line one entire wall;
they are currently empty, awaiting
flavor bottles, perhaps, or an expanded role for next year. "I'd like to
expand things, but I don't have room
back here," laughed Henderson. Between the shelves and the machinery,
it is fairly cramped.

Isabelle Cosby Courtyard
"We want it to teel very inviting,"
Sawyers said. "It's a chance to make
a great first impression to people com-

ing to visit the school. The whole
staff has been involved in designing
the courtyard, and choosing plants.
It's kept us occupied most of the
winter." Sawyers hopes to
have much of the work completed this spring, but says
that there will most likely be
modifications and refinements. "As they say," she concluded, "a garden is never finished."
"Personally, I am really
pleased with the whole
project," says Associate Vice
President Larry Schall, "and I
think it will be a great addition to life here."
JodiFurr' 97, looks forward
to the courtyard: "Right now
it doesn't really looklike anything," she says. "I heard that
those big wooden beams are
really expensive, so I hope
they put them to good use.
I'm really curious to see what
they do with it, because right
now it's an eyesore. It looks
like Stonehenge, except it's
not round!"
Joseph Goodman '97 also
looks forward to the results of
the planting. "They spent
enough money on it that it ought to
look good! It doesn't look like much
now, but hopefully it will improve."

However, Schroeder said that "unless aparty [aggregator] has received
a waiver" from the FCC, lOxxx access must be provided. He also confirmed, when provided with a description of Swarthmore's telephone
system, that the College is considered an aggregator. Dumic maintained
that the question of the College's
status under FCC regulations is "still
being contested" and that, in any case,
the final deadline for unblocking
lOxxx codes is not until 1997. Furthermore, Dumic said he "is not aware
ofany college or universitycurrently
providing lOxxx access" but that the
College "will provide access to lOxxx
when required to do so."
Responding to the issue of access
to OSPs, Dumic pointed out that carriers can also be accessed by 1-800
numbers. However, STC policy is
that students whose PIN numbers
have been suspended because they
have unpaid bills cannot dial outgoing calls to 1-800 numbers. This
policy, combined with the denial of
access to OSPs via lOxxx codes,
means that some students—includ-

ing those whose bills are in dispute
cannot access any long-distance providers.
Dumic said thathe is "not sure why
800 calls would be blocked for anyone but perhaps a few PIN codes
were mistakenly not disabled correctly.... It definitely should not be
happening and we'd be happy to correct it if the affected individuals would
let us know who they are."
STC's rate-quoting system also
appears to be in violation of FCC
guidelines. STC, the operator service
provider for Swarthmore College, is
required to quote exact rates for toll
calls upon request. STC will give out
the interstate rate during business
hours only, and has published the
—

distance-independent interstate rate.
STC will not, however, give outrates
for in-state toll calls on demand. At
best, they will take down the number
to be called and will respond later to
the request. Rate information is not
available after business hours.
STC employee Phillip Gallina said
thatthe "rates are found on [only] one
computer"and the availability of that
computer dictates when rates can be
disclosed to callers.
However, STC tries, Gallina said,
to respond "within the same day" to
requests for rate information. When a
Phoenix reporter called STC and requested rate information, an STC
employee responded that he would
not be able to process the request for
five hours.
According to SchroederoftheFCC,
this policy is a clear violation ofFCC
regulations. Rates must be available
at all times—not just during business
hours—and must be disclosed "at the
time you are requesting [the] rates."
The Phoenix investigation ofSwarthmore telecommunication policies
was prompted by questions raised by
Samuel Weiler '96 who questioned
STC and College telecommunication
policies on a computer newsgroup.

Budget Committee Behind
Schedule; Commitment Low
By

Aarti Iyer

The student Budget Committee has
had to reschedule two ofits six meetings this spring due to insufficient
attendance. The committee, headed
by treasurer Tanisha Little '97, needs
to have at least seven of its ten members present in order to hold a meeting and make decisions. "Anytime
you have to get ten people together
for a couple of hours, you're going to
run into some difficulties," said Little.
The committee meets for about 25
to 30 hours in the spring; its role is to
allocate funds from the Student Activities Fund to the various clubs and
organizations that request it. "In the
spring, all the organizations submit

budget proposals for the following
year—a guideline as to how much
money they want, what they will be
spending it on, etc.."explained Little.
"We are now meeting with them to
review these proposals."
The committee is currently behind
schedule in terms of how much has
been accomplished, but Little insists
that this is due to some unforeseen
budget problems concerning the College, not the sporadic attendance of
members. Moreover, no student organization has complained to Little
about the trouble of rescheduling of
meeting times to discuss their budget
proposals. "The situation is not out of
control at this point. We can expect

College Searches for New Assistant Dean and Intercultural Center Director
By

Jonathan Reed

The Dean's Office announced this
week that it is conducting a national
search to fill the position ofAssistant
Dean and Director of the Intercultural Center. The position will have
half-time responsibilities in the
Dean's Office, and half-time responsibilities in the Intercultural Center.
The portion of this position in the
Dean's Office, according to the job
description, will include serving "on
the academic support and advising
team, providing academic advising
and personal counselling, as well as
other support and programming, for
all students." In the other half of the
job, the new person will "direct the

Intercultural Center serving as the
Dean's Office liaison and providing
academic advising and personal counselling to Asian Pacific Islander,
Latino, and Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual students and alumni; and ensuring strong ties between the Intercultural Center and the academic life
of the College through planning and
implementing cultural programs."
This new position of Assistant Dean
and Director of the IC parallels exactly the position currently held by
Maxine Proctor, assistant dean and
director of the BCC.
The new position grew from the
combination of two vacant half-time
positions. The first of these positions
was the Associate Dean of the Col-

lege, formerly held by Joe Mason. In
a written statement, Dean of the College Ngina Lythcott commented,
"Thisperson would do several things:
would lead the effort on campus to
create the vision for multicultural
education in the dean's office, would
convene the multicultural education
team for the dean's area,
[and]
would also oversee the Tri-College
programs and oversee the work that
emerges from the remaining year and
a half of the Hewlett Grant."

Director of the IC—is one of the jobs
currently held by Fernando ChangMuy in addition to his half-time commitment in the Provost's Office and

as a Night ofCreative Expression in
the B lack Cultural Center on Friday
night and a party in Tarble Social

Phonathon Held for
Accepted Students
By

Aarti Iyer

The Phonathon was held this
week for three nights in an attempt
to contact all the students accepted
through regular decision. All the
callers who participated were volunteers, and most were first-years
and sophomores. "I put an ad in the
Weekly News," said Jim Bock of
the Admissions Office, who was in
charge of the Phonathon, "It asked
any interested students who are enthusiastic about Swarthmore to
come in and help out ifthey could."
The callers congratulated the stu-

people have come from all over the
East Coast and the country to see the
art gallery. Taking away this opportunity from them is a bad feeling,"
said Mary Kordak, YUAG Museum
Education Liaison.
None of the gallery's 14 guards
have reported to work since Local
35's strike began. Currently, the University and its unions are involved in
a National Labor Relations Board
dispute over whether the guards belong to Local 35.
The YUAG is considered one of
the best, if not the best, university art
gallery in the nation. The gallery's
collection includes more than 100,000
works of art, including paintings, silver, sculpture, and furniture.
"I'm deeply saddened by the fact
that most of the gallery has been
closed. The art gallery is an incomparable resource to students and to the
Yale community. It's regrettable that
it is not as accessible anymore,"
School of Art Dean David Pease said.
Museum officials said they are trying their best to accommodate Yale
faculty and students, and the gallery' s
security department has coordinated
with art history classes to schedule

visits.
"We have designated [managerial
and professional] staff members responsible for back-up each week to

way to extend a welcome," explained
Bock, "A lot of schools do this." On

Empty the Shelters will be hosting
the regional conference of Students
Together Ending Poverty (STEP) on
Sunday from 12:00 to 4:00 p.m. on
the second floor of Kohlberg.
Beth Green '97, an organizer of the
conference, expects that at least 30
students from five Philadelphia-area
colleges will attend. She envisions
the conference as a follow-up to a
national conference held last fall by
STEP. Green says that participants
will explore "how students can be
supportive of community efforts and
link up with other students...[in order] to support the leadership of the

poor."
Presentations will include The Historical Role of Students in Social
Change, Community Service and
Social Action, Intersections of Race
and Class, and Spirituality and
Struggle. Green hopes that "in sharing ideas and experiences, we hope to
strengthen the work we do in communities in Philly."

accommodate classes who meet on
Wednesdays and Thursdays," said
Liz Owen GRD '9B, head teaching
assistant for History ofArt 115. "But
Friday classes have no options. Art is

and this is a real loss to students."
Students said they are disappointed
about the closing of the art gallery,
which has restricted their ability to
visit for both art projects and pleasure.
"I miss it because I can just go there
to get out of the madness at Yale,"
Sarah Baker '99 said. "It's a fabulous
art gallery and especially for art, it's
important to look at what influences
you. Books just aren't as good as
actual art pieces."
"With pre-frosh coming soon, it's
a shame they won't get to see how
great the art gallery is," she added.On
a typiqal day, YUAG can receive up
to 600 guests from around the nation,
Weltzien said.
Since only the first floor special
exhibitions remain open, the gallery
has pushed many school groups and
adult tours to later dates, she added.
"During a usual week at this time
of the year, we would' ve had about
15 groups of school children, averaging 25 kids per group, visiting the art

WSRN Resumes

Broadcast
By

Kate

Zyla

On Monday, April 15, Swarthmore College Radio WSRN will
resume broadcasting after almost a
month of dead air. The station shut
down in March after the Board of
Directors decided that the time had
come to replace their old and overworked control board.
WSRN, the second oldest college radio station in the United
States, had been broadcasting with
a board purchased in the 19605,
and much of the aging equipment
had been experiencing technical
difficulties.
WSRN Technical Crew Justin
Paulson '96 and Neilu Naini '96
compared pricing options, and
Treasurer Jessica Howington '9B
hashed out a plan with College
Budget Committee to purchase the
necessary equipment.
In addition to the control board,
the station's turntables, CD players and tape decks have also been
replaced. "The whole studio is
brand new," says Programming
Director Jonathan Evans '96. "It
won't have to be replaced or rewired for another twenty years."
Productions/Non-Music Director
Charlie Mayer '9B installed the
equipment with the help of an outside consultant.
The new board, which consists
ofmodular components, has a technical advantage over the old design. Now if one component breaks,
that particular module can be repaired or replaced without requiring that the entire board be removed. This should eliminate sporadic station shutdowns due to
mechanical difficulties.
Station DJs have been trained on
all of the new equipment, and
WSRN 91.5 FM, now passing FCC
specifications with flying colors,
will be on the air as of 7:00 a.m. this

Monday morning. Programming

Officer.
After Chang-Muy's resignation,
Dean Lythcott decided to combine
these two positions so that the College could conduct a national search
that would attract strong candidates
for this full-time position.
A search committee headed by
Associate Dean Bob Gross has already been formed. Faculty members
Donald Swearer, Amy Vollmer,
Charles James, and Allen Kuharski
are on the search committee in addition to David Ramirez, director of
psychological services, and Marialuz
Castro '9B, Ken Munroe '99, Ben
Maulbeck '99, andNazimaKadir '97.
Students were generally supportive about the new definition of the

position. Laura Christian '96 says,
"I'm really happy with the decision
[to restrict the position to Director of
IC rather than merging it with the
Associate Dean position]. It means
that the person who takes over
Fernando's position will focus primarily on the IC rather than on administrative concerns. It ensures that
there won't be a strange power dynamic involving a person with one
foot in the IC and the other in a
position of power above SASS and
othergroups. The decisionalso means
that people qualified for the IC position who don't happen to have the
years and years of experience required for Associate Dean will be
considered." Commented Paul Wong

'97, "I'm disappointed about loosing
the associate dean position but also
happy about the renewed emphasis
on the director of the IC."
President Al Bloom noted in a statement, "However the position is defined, its purpose is twofold: on the
one hand, to support students of diverse cultural backgrounds and sexual
orientations so that they feel fully at
home at Swarthmore and thrive on its
educational program; on the other, to
strengthen this community's ability
to educate students to appreciate cultural differences while at the same
time recognizing and building upon
the rich array of fundamental human
commonalities that cut across those
differences."

Students' Perspectives Vary on How to Enhance Diversity at Swarthmore
{Continuedfrom page! J
For the Class of 1999,203AfricanAmerican students applied, 81, or 40
percent, were accepted, and 17 chose

of whom 147, or 30 percent, were

Untereker notes that "diversity

of this size. We have to make it happen, and we are trying to the best of

are all kinds of reasons why Swarthmore is not a match for each student,
[but] it makes me mad when I think
they're the right match, but they decide not to go to Swarthmore. A lot of
kids will listen to their parents or
guidance counselors and choose to
go to another school, even if [the
student] thinks that Swarthmore is
the match for them."
Students' opinions vary as to why
Swarthmore might be having difficulty in convincing more students of
color to matriculate. Vincent Jones
'9B, a history and economics major
with a concentration in public policy
who is also a Lang scholar and vicepresident of SASS, said, "The AdEnvironmental Justice Week, 4/15each of the following nightsMon. 4/15 (Kirov), Tues.,W., and Thurs.

job but the College itself is.. .not as
devoted to multiculturalism and diversity as they say they are." In reference to University of Pennsylvania
law professor Lani Guinier's words
at a recent speech on campus, Jones
believes that, '"Add blacks and stir'
is what they're doing here."
Jones feels as if the College, especially in the past but to some extent
today, "puts the burden [of creating
diversity] on students of color." He
notes that "being black is like being a
major" at Swarthmore.
Amy Albert '9B, a political science
and economics major who is also cocoordinator of the race and ethnicity
journal OurStory and co-creator of a
student-led course about race and
ethnicity to be offered this fall, also
believes that "the Admissions Office
is really trying. I think a lot of it has
to do with what's going on on campus. It's a small predominantly white
campus that has some screwy issues
about race, and this comes out. I
don't think it is just an admissions
problem."
Tanisha Little '97, a political science major who serves as co-president of SASS, SAC co-director, and
Budget Committee treasurer, pointed
out other factors that might deter accepted African-American students
from choosing to attend Swarthmore:
"When black students come to a certain level, they want [a college with]
name recognition. They want to go to
a place that there parents and friends
have heard of. They [also] want a
place where there are people who
look like them."
Thanh Hoang '97, who is majoring
in English, psychology, and educa-

tion and serves as co-president of
SAO along with Paul Wong '97, an
economics/Asian studies major, noted
that "initially, there existed a lack of
communication between Admissions
and SAO where we were disregarded
in the admissions process. It was only
due to our own initiative that SAO
became an active participant in admissions by aggressively recruiting
students through letter-writing and
phone campaigns. In the future, we
hope to have greater input and involvement with the Admissions Office in recruiting minority students."
Jones said, "Wehave found through
minority weekend and talking to
people that the biggest issue [in deciding whether or not to come] is
financial aid, then the kind of classes
offered."
Members of the administration,
including President Al Bloom, believethat financial aid is not a significant factor, alluding to a survey of
accepted students which indicates that
financial aid is not the reason why
students decline admission to Swarthmore.
Ultimately, Untereker thinks that
"the kid who's the best match—it has
nothing to do with their socioeconomic, ethnic, religious or national
background—is a student who truly
gets turned on by ideas."

Rosenbergs' Son to Debate Parents' Fate
By

Jessica Harbour

The case of Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg, one of the greatest judicial controversies of the twentieth
century, will be argued on Saturday
at 1 p.m. in the Performing Arts Center cinema. Michael Meeropol '64,
the son ofJulius and Ethel Rosenberg,
will argue for his parents' innocence,
while Joyce Milton '67 will argue for
their guilt. Victor Navasky '54, publisher of The Nation, will provide
response and commentary, while
Meta Mendel-Reyes, assistant professor of political science, will moderate the debate and the subsequent
question-and-answer session.
In the February 1995 issue of the
Alumni Bulletin, Meeropol laid out a
challenge for Milton to debate. Her
acceptance led to this event.
Meeropol, a professor of economics
at Western New England College,
co-wrote We Are Your Sons: The
Legacy of Juliusand Ethel Rosenberg
with his brother Robert. He has also
edited and published a collection of
his parents' prison letters. Milton cowrote The Rosenberg File: A Search
for the Truth with Ronald Radosh in
1983; she is also the author of a
biography ofCharlesand Anne Morrow Lindbergh and a study of yellow
journalism.
In 1950 the Rosenbergs, along with
Ethel Rosenberg's brother, David
Greenglass, and several other alleged
conspirators, were arrested and accused of selling information about
the United States' atomic program to
the Soviet Union in 1944 and 1945.
According to the prosecution,
Greenglass, while an Army lieutenant in Los Alamos, New Mexico,
passed on secrets to his sister and
brother-in-law, who funneled them
to a New Yorker named Harry Gold,
who then gave them to a Soviet vice
consul in New York City. While
Greenglass, Gold, and fellow conspirator Morton Soboul received
prison sentences, in 1951 the
Rosenbergs were both sentenced to
death under the 1917 Espionage Act.
They appealed the verdict unsuccess-

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg

fully for two years before being executed in 1953.
At the time, there were worldwide
protests against the execution of the
Rosenbergs, and many still feel they
were innocent, convicted on flimsy
evidence. It is often alleged that
Greenglass and Gold were encouraged by theFBI to match their stories
so the prosecution wouldhave a stronger case. The political climate at the
time of the Rosenbergs' trial is also
an issue. According to a 1993 edition
of the Encyclopedia Americana, the
trial tookplace "during the bloodiest
stages of the Korean War and at the
peak of Senator Joseph McCarthy's
anti-Communist campaign." Julius
Rosenberg had been a Communist
Party member since 1940.
In his request for funding for the

debate, lan Bricke '9B wrote, "This is
a one-of-a-kind and genuinely historical event, offering an opportunity
for a re-examination and re-evaluation of a crucial event inrecent American history. [lt] should be an exciting
event, touching not only on historical
issues, but on current issues of the
death penalty, anti-Semitism, due
process, and civil liberties."
The debate is sponsored by Student Publications, AlumniRelations,
Ruach, the Peaslee Debate Society,
the Swarthmore Civil Liberties Society, and the Socialist Political Action
Collective, as well as the departments
of History, Economics, Political Science, Sociology/Anthropology, Education, and English Literature. A reception will follow immediately the

debate.

Multiculturalism at Swat: a

guide for specs.

For several months now there has
been an ongoing battle over Soc/Anth
15, "Wisdom and the Healing Arts."
Originally a temporary course set to
expire at the end of this year, "Wisdom" gained a potential second life
after students demanded that the
course be reinstated. The following
article is about the systemic and administrative inadequacies and hidden agendas which have made it unlikely that the course will continue.
Let me first share with you the
history of the course's battle for selfpreservation, in chronological order:
Students complain about plans to
discontinue "Wisdom."
The Administration regrets there
are no funds to teach the class, (problem #1)
Dr. Posner volunteers to teach
without pay. (solution #1)
Provost JennieKeith states this is
problematic because ofproblems with
"authority" over volunteer teachers,
(problem #2)
Adequate funding is found for the
course from both a gracious alumni
donation and President Bloom's discretionary stash, (solution #2)
Actually, says the Administration, the REAL problem is that Soc/
Anth has no more credits, and allowing "Wisdom" to be taught there
would cause interdepartmental favoritism (given they have no more credits), (problem #3)
The Linguistics Department, having extra credits, volunteers to house
"Wisdom." (solution #3)
Acting on behalf of the integrity
of our institution, Provost Jennie
Keith and the Council on Educational
Policy (CEP) decide it is unethical
for Linguistics to host this course,
(problem #4)
The direction I am going should be
obvious: the administrationand Soc/
Anth department are toying with us.
There is a hidden agenda beneath all
of these obstacles they keep putting
in front us. The bottom line is this:
Despite being an M.D. with a highly
successful private practice, despite
•

As hundreds of specs congregate here to consider attending Swarthmore,
they must assess many aspects of the campus environment in a visit lasting
only a few days. Among the most important aspects of the campus environment are multiculturalism and diversity.
Swarthmore frequently presents itself as committed to multiculturalism
and diversity. But how authentic is this commitment and how much does it
permeate daily campus life?
The Swarthmore community definitely leans to the left. Compared to
people at more conservative campuses, Swatties tend to be more concerned,
or at least claim to be more concerned, with multiculturalism. Issues ofrace,
class, gender, and sexual orientation are discussed inside and outside of class
with great frequency, by students ofall backgrounds. The importance of these
issues is at least acknowledged. In many ways, Swarthmore is a safe space.
It's probably fair to say that it's safer than most other places.
But it ain't perfect. It remains 78 percent white. It remains fairly wealthy
and largely straight. Even withthe heightened awareness of pluralism issues,
if you are queer, of color, female, a religious minority, or from a lower income
bracket, you must still cope with a disempowering environment.
You're not likely to find a person ofcolor or a queer person who feels their
identity is not in some way a burden. Too often, such identities become an
obligation. Other students—and even faculty—expect queer students, students of color and less wealthy students to "speak for their people" or
represent their interests to "bring multiculturalism" to the institution.
And aside from that, Swarthmore is certainly not free from racism,
homophobia, sexism, and classism. There is wider discourse, there is more
sensitivity, but often that only serves to make these problems more covert, and
more complex. And in some ways that's even more difficult to deal with than
the good old-fashioned beatings.

Diversity, relevance, and our staff.
Like most Swarthmore students, we on The Phoenix are concerned about
diversity, on this campus and off. This week we're printing the first article in
a series investigating the Admissions Office's efforts to recruit a more diverse
student body; we hope the series will bring into sharper focus the reasons why
Swarthmore fails almost every year to meet its own targets for minority
representation on the campus.
But it's ironic that this newspaper is even less diverse than the college it
writes about. Of the 25 names listed in the staff box at the top of this column,
only four belong to students of color. That's 16percent, six percentage points
less than the 22 percent of Swarthmore students who are people of color.
Racial diversity is not the only kind of diversity, to be sure. Diversity results
from many factors, not all of them quantifiable. But by almost any standard,
this newspaper does not have a diverse staff.
Unfortunately, we're not sure why that is. We hope the environment in our
newsroom is one in which anyone can feel comfortable; we hope our articles
are relevant to readers of all backgrounds; we hope we do not exhibit bias in
our interactions with others. Students of color have even served as editors-inchief withinrecent memory. Despite all this, our staffhas traditionally been
and remains—almost all white, non-religious, and straight.
This makes our attempts to write about diversity somewhat hypocritical.
Until our staff is as diverse or more diverse than the campus as a whole, what
right do we have to criticize the general homogeneity of the student body?
A publication that seeks to cover a wide range of people, events and ideas
needs a staff from a widerange of backgrounds. If our staffdoes not become
more representative of the student body, this newspaper will become increasingly irrelevant to many of the people we like to count as readers.
In a recent staff meeting, we briefly discussed what we can do to remedy
this problem. We're planning greater efforts to reach out to currently
underrepresented groups, but beyond that, we're not sure what to do. If you
have any ideas, please contact us; we think of The Phoenix as an all-campus
publication, but unless things change, it may not be one for long.

A message from the management.
WSRN has been off the airfor several weeks. The student Budget Committhe midst of Spring Budgeting, a process in which it hands out more
than $200,000 to dozens of student groups. On April 3, Student Council held
an open meeting for students to share their concerns with the President and
Dean of the College. Many students returned home last weekend to celebrate
Easter or Passover with their families, while others found ways to celebrate
the holidays on campus. Daylight saving time began at 2 a.m. Sunday.
Unfortunately, you wouldn'tknow any of this from last week' s Phoenix. In
fact, dozens of stories have gone unnoticed or ignored, or have simply slipped
through the administrative cracks, this semester; the list above includes only
a few relatively minor examples from one edition of the newspaper.
Perhaps the biggest story we've missedinvolves a recently abandoned plan
to combine the positions ofDirector of the InterculturalCenter and Associate
Dean for Multicultural Affairs. Until this week, we did not print a single
article about the proposal, even though it was extremely controversial and
upset many people on this campus community. And this week's article does
not even come close to giving a complete account of the controversy.
The reasons we mishandled this story, and others, are many. Among them:
our staffs lack of diversity means we sometimes fail to see the importance of
a story; our staffs small size means we sometimes don'thave enough people
to cover even the most pressing issues; some members of our staff sometimes
put other commitments ahead of their responsibilities to The Phoenix. In
short, various organizational and communication problems have made our
news coverage sorely deficient.
We wish we had a plan in place to prevent further slip-ups during the
semester's few remaining weeks. Sadly, we don't. Just this week, we failed
for the umpteenth time to write about developments in the room-choosing
process; we still can't tell you how students are reacting to changes in
substance-free housing and waiting list policies. We've also ignored numerous ongoing searches for new faculty members. And you wouldn't know it
from this newspaper, but the faculty is in the process of deciding whether to
renew Jennie Keith's appointment as provost.

studying with a Sufi master eight
hours a day for 12 years, despite 5
semesters of teaching and a book due
to be published, Dr. Howard Posner
is not a Ph.D. That's basically it. You
see, because he studied Islam daily
for 12 years with a master instead of
taking 2 or 3 courses at grad school,
Howard Posner is not "scholarly" in
his approach to the subject matter. It
should be noted that the CEP (which
never allowed Dr. Posner to defend
himself) made this decision on the
basis of Dr. Posner's syllabus, which
presumably explains both the books
he teaches and how he teaches them.
This whole rigmarole is about competing epistemological and methodological frameworks. Unlike theother
courses in our Soc/Anth department,
which ostensibly teach on wholly rational, objective grounds (and certainly without any Western assumptions!), Dr. Posner acknowledges his
personal experience in.class. Because
he does not deny the subjectivism
inherent in any course, Dr. Posner is
a threat to our Swattie construct of
academic knowledge.
The irony is obvious. Think about
it, the Soc/Anth Department, the department committed to the study and
understanding of culture and the diversity of the epistemologies of
knowledge and learning is itself so
entrenched within one epistemology
that it is completely threatened by a
different way of teaching. The Soc/
Anth Department is so consumedwith
its own paradigm of studying human
understanding that it can accept no
other. Mustn't we necessarily question the efficacy of a Soc/Anth department so fixated on its own construct of what objectivity is that it
can't be diverse itself? Certainly we
are aware of the dangers of granting
one construct qualitative supremacy.
Not only are the philosophical underpinnings of this brouhaha dubious, but the structural aspect of this
course's terminationis full of contradictions. We like to think that students have a lot of power. Wrong. I
repeat, wrong. We can provide "input" which President Bloom will as-

Letters

sure you is taken very seriously, but
we have no actual power in determining which classesand professors stay.
None. Nada. Zip. (Remember Alex
Juhasz in the English Department?)
Which brings me to the first major
contradiction. Why should students
have no power in choosing which
courses come and go? Apparently,
our academic departments, as experts
with the liberty to set their agenda
(known in many circles as elitism, by
the way), can uphold the highest standards of academic excellence. This is
why there is nothing we students can
do to make S&A take "Wisdom"back.
BUT WAIT! Remember 'Problem
#4', our current quandary? Basically,
the academic departments are completely autonomous unless Provost
Keith feels they've acted inappropriately and thus need to be taken to
CEP to be told what's really in our
best interest. Alas, Donna Jo Napoli,
because ofher superlative qualifications, has the proverbial carte blanche
to set the Linguistics Department
agenda, yet, at the same time, according to the Provost and CEP, it seems
that her decision to offer her credits
to "Wisdom" was ill-advised and obviously foolish. Quite frankly, this
glaring contradiction insults the intelligence of Linguistics and makes
the students' status as the only powerless group (in respects to academic
agenda) official.
But a second contradiction also
looms. Assuming that the Provost
and company are right, and that this
system does guarantee such high standards of excellence, how did Howard
Posner sneak this supposedly subpar
course through for five consecutive
semesters? How could they possibly
argue that we should not order the
Soc/Anth department into taking a
course that they feel is inadequate
when THEY THEMSELVES were
the ones who took it in the first place!
Sure, they offered it only temporarily
(for three years), but if the course is
so bad that it's not worth extending
for free, how can we accept the system which allowed it to linger for
75% of my Swat career? My point

Editor

Response to Neena Shenai: NEA serves valuable function as protector
To the editor:
Neena Shenai's argument in the
Point-Counterpoint debate of the
March 29th Phoenix presents several
points that characterize Republican
reasoning. Ms. Shenai argues that
because the NEA funds art inappropriate for the viewing ofchildren and
contrary to our "cultural values," and
because the common citizen doesn't
have a say in where his money is
going, it should be abolished. I will
show that her arguments are ill-informed, and talk about some of the
cultural benefits art provides.
Ms. Shenaiand some other modern
advocates of "family values" claim
that, because the NEA has funded
some questionable art, the public sector should stay out of art funding
entirely. One would hope that such a
strong statement would have some
reasoning behind it. However, even
assuming this is a reasonable stance,
it is inconsistent and irresponsible to
end arts funding, as the budget for the
miliary bands ofthe Dept. ofDefense
is higher than that of the entire NEA.
I wonder what possible rationalization they could come up with to explain cutting funding for national treasures such as those at the MET, but
retaining DOD's brass. Maybe they
want to cut the NEA's budget so that
the schoolchildren supplied with its
money ($90,000 to the Pennsylvania
Council on the Arts in '96, for example) won't have to worry about
getting paint on their clothes, but I
certainly hope artistic expression is
valued more highly than an extra load
of laundry.
Even if they were consistent with
their idea that the public sector
shouldn't fund the arts, the private
sector isn't up to the task. A July '95
study by the Rockefeller Foundation
polled 40 major private foundations,
and an overwhelming majority said
that they cannot increase their funding for the arts now, and could not
were the NEA abolished; indeed,
many were planning to reduce funding, so that there is now more need
for the NEA than ever.
Just how many people belong to
that group of "certain artists" that
Ms. Shenai and others have provided
as a reason for cutting (and even
eliminating) the NEA's budget? Just
how many Mapplethorpes and
Serranos are there that produce this
"unsuitable" art, anyway? Because
there are different standards of obscenity, it is not possible to arrive at
an exact percentage of obscene artists of the more than 10,000 artists

funded since the NEA's inception.
However, the percentage of artists
that has been publicized or otherwise
publicly contested as "obscene" or
"unsuitable" is less than 0.4%.
Ms. Shenai and others argue that
funding art deemed objectionable by
the majority "clashes with the values
of our culture," but just which values
are they talking about? America was
founded by men and women who
were escaping authoritarian rule in
England. In our current global climate, there simply isn't any place
where one exclusive, dominantgroup
(as the Puritans were, by many accounts) can go and be all by themselves and not have to deal with dissenting opinions. Through the medium of art, or any other form of
expression, ideas are discussed and
debated; people thereby gain new
perspectives and information on how
they would like to live their lives. A
large variety of people from many
different backgrounds, and a wide
body of art, necessarily yields ideas
and practices that we find revolting
and inappropriate. But it is both the
disagreeable as well as the agreeable
ideas that shape who we are and inform our lives. People of different
origins need to cooperate peacefully,
not only to live happily together in

here is not that the system should be
torn down, but that something is
clearly wrong. Why did Jennie Keith
take this to CEP? Why, if they were
simply determining whether Linguistics should be allowed to house the
course, did CEP spend a significant
amount of time talking about Dr.
Posner' s character? And why are students kept completely in the dark
about this entire process (never mind
that we're not a part)?
Besides being just a little too progressive for our Swattie elite, "Wisdom" suffers from the terrible condition of being multi-disciplinary. Instead of looking at healing and spirituality though just one lens, "Wisdom" looks at it from the point of
view of religion, soc/anth, biology,
philosophy, and, yes (ironically
enough), linguistics. This turns outto
be a problem because no one department finds the course wholly suitable
for its own agenda. The solution is
therefore not to force the class into a
department that doesn't want it, but
to find some multi-disciplinary place
for the class to exist. I think this
solution would not only help the students, since we naive and unsophisticated folks would have what we want,
but would also protect the long-term
interests of the departments.
Finally, a word to the students.
Analyze what our role has been in
this entire process. First of all, we
have been kept informed of absolutely nothing. The only information
ever released by the administration
was one slim Phoenix article many,
many weeks back. Meanwhile, we
can' t attend the meetings or hear what
goes on behind closed doors. Indeed,
four trips to JennieKeith's office got
me nothing (not even the promised
courtesy call back) except a "sorry,
Jennie's too busy to ever meet with
you" on the fourth and final attempt.
Furthermore, even when involved,
we are just advisors. We have no
vote. The best we can do is hope they
look fondly upon our little petitions
and colorful signs and quaint Phoenix articles. I ask, is this the same
school we like to think we attend?

the U.S., but also to further the communication and exchange of ideas
that will enrich the lives of the individuals and the culture they live in.
This country's founding principles
include the free exchange of ideas.
However, there are certainly some
times and places where certain ideas
shouldn't be discussed (terrorism in
the airport for example), and there
are certain ideas that some people
(including children) are really not
prepared to deal with. Ms. Shenai
argues that "obscene" art shouldn't
be seen by children and I agree, but
the field of art should not be forced to
adhere to G-rated standards. Though
there are many artistic subjects that
are acceptable for children's viewing, it is necessary in art, as in most
disciplines, to explore the boundaries
of what is acceptable and comment
on the taboo in order to avoid stagnation. Art therefore can open people's
minds to the world, and lead them to
question and rethink things in a way
that puts their reason to good use.
Finally, in calling for the participation of the common citizen in the
decision on what works should be
funded, Ms. Shenai forgets the foundation of our democratic system, in
light of which the NEA's board of
directors seems entirely appropriate.

of artistic

expression.

Our political system functions by the
citizens voting on representatives in
Congress, who then vote in a manner
that represents the opinions of their
constituents. In this way a few people
debate and decide issues after being
briefed by the specialist in their office in that particular area. In much
the same way, the group of people
deciding on grants for the NEA are
professionals in the field of the artist
underconsideration. Furthermore, the
American public has as muchauthority over the funding decision as over
the appointment of an attorney general or a Supreme Court justice. The
"peer review" system of the NEA is
suitable to the process, and is in keeping with our democratic processes.
The NEA, given the benefits it provides, should be reformed, not eliminated. The arts can be seen as a form
of education, continuing even after
graduate school. Art enriches our lives
by exposing us to different ideas and
cultures that broaden our mind and
inform our intellect. As the private
sector simply cannot afford to support the arts, they must be publicly
funded. If we decide that the government shouldn't encourage questioning and educating, we will be in danger of entering a new Middle Ages.

"Neanderthals" respond: in defense of camerawork at the Sager party.
To the editor:
We are writing this letter in response to the letter in last week's
Phoenix in which several students
condemned the behavior of other students at Genderf***. Since we were
among a very few people taking pictures at this party, we feel that the
letter was directed towards us and our
actions. We would like to take this
opportunity to address some of the
points made in their letter and also to
make a few things clear to them
First and foremost, please be certain that when we go to sleep at night,
you do not appear in our dreams. You
are not our fantasy or the object of our
desires. We do not care if you are
straight, homosexual, or bisexual, you
just aren't our type. We did not take
these pictures to provide hours of
future sexual gratification. Don' t you
wish! No, these pictures were taken
because we find naked people painted
silver and guys in prom dresses funny.
It makes us laugh; we find it amusing.
This world is just as much ours as it is
yours. You are not special and neither are we. You are not above those
who choose not to "f***" their gen-

der, so quit acting like you are.
Secondly, we were a little disturbed
by the comment that if we take more
pictures of you, you will "scratch our
eyes out." Isn't that a little extreme?
If a homosexual male asks one of us
out on a date, should we beat him
within an inch of his life? According
to you, the answer appears to be yes;
people who do not do exactly as told
should be physically punished. Why
are we "Neanderthals"? Because we
took pictures at aparty ? That is just as
ridiculous as saying all of you are
"faggots" for cross-dressing. Both
labels are stupid and childish, and
you should know better than to label
people. In the future you might want
to think before you make such unintelligent and threatening remarks.
Certainly, you would not want those
types of remarks made about you.
It is also disturbing that a number
of you who signed the letter actually
posed for some of these pictures. We
find this extremely hypocritical. You
have no right to condemn us for taking pictures for which you volunteered to pose. Those who signed the
letter and posed for pictures discred-

ited the letter and made themselves
and the other signers look foolish.
Lastly, we pose this question to all
of you. Why did our taking pictures
upset you so greatly? People take
pictures at parties all tfie time; there
was nothing abnormal about our behavior. So, obviously, the abnormality was on your end. In other words,
if being photographed cross dressing

Forum on Financial Aid: Thoughts From Students, Faculty and the Administration
Question: Is the present financial aid policy need-blind, or blind
By

Peter Schmidt

How well are Swarthmore's students who need aid being served by
our current financial aid policies?
Has the average amount of money
given in scholarships per student
shrunken while the loan and work
requirements have increased?
What percentage of students now
admitted can pay their way through
Swarthmore without any aid, or very
little aid? Is it true (as rumors have
suggested) that the percentage of students whose families can pay their
own way is steadily rising and is now
or will soon be over half of the student population?
Instead, why not increase the scholarship amounts for all admitted students who need aid and shrink the
number of students who can pay in
full? In fact, I think Swarthmore
should set the goal of having approximately 75 percent of its stuSchmidt is a professor

dents on substantial aid, while also
increasing the amount that most students receive in scholarships and decreasing what they receive as loans
and work-study requirements.
Even more importantly, I think we
also ought to do more to recruit strong
first-generation college students from
U.S. high schools (i.e., students with
no parent who has graduated from a
four-year college or university). Why
not choose to have Swarthmore be
known as having the outstanding aid
program in the country for strong
first-generation college students?
Want to bet that such a program
would have a greater effect on "diversifying" our student body in terms
of race and class while keeping academic standards high than any other
policy we could put in place?
How about creating 30 full scholarships per class to the best admitted
students ofany race or ethnicity from
U.S. high schools who are first-generation college students. Yes, I know
it's expensive; I can dothe math. I' ve

to need? More

also seen the figures on the growth of
our endowment over the last decade.
This new program would not be
meant to compete with other aid policies but to be in addition to them.
Let's run it for 10 years and see what
effect it has. Let's also give extra
focus to having Admissions folks visit
high schools with high percentages
of students who will become firstgeneration college students. If we
find that the program works we could
then see if we shouldn't get an similarly ambitious aid program for admitted foreign students.
Finally, what is a better way than
current practice for students to influence—not dictate —financial aid
policy? Perhaps a student committee
on financial aid policy that meets
regularly with all the faculty and staff
involved in Admissions and Aid policies and an increase in students who
serve on the relevant faculty-staff
committees? Perhaps an annual Collection devoted to Admissions and
Aid performance and policies?

Level the playing field by replacing tuition costs with community service.
By

Donna Jo Napoli

Every Swarthmore student deserves respect. It's hard to earn admission—even if you never had to
share a bed with a sibling, even if you
had a desk to work at, even if you
never went to bed hungry, even if you
attended an outstanding high school,
even if you haven't worked part time
for years. Once you step on this campus, you are among equals. You have
a right to be treated that way.
Right now our college does not do
that. We constrain financial-aid students in how they spend their time
outside class, and we handicap them
with debt. Certainly, other factors
(their ideas of responsibility, their
parents) command the time of other
students who also may be burdened
with a debt (perhaps to parents).
Thefirst question is not how people
should spend their time outside class
Napoli is a professor of linguistics.

or whether they should take a debt,
but who has the right to determine
that. The college assumes this right
for some students based solely on
their family financial status.
This is not a level playing field; it's
not respect. If it's riot our business
how the non-financial-aid student
spends time, it's not our business
how the aid recipient does. Furthermore, many ways to spend time that
aren't financially remunerated are appreciated more by graduate schools,
medical schools, law schools. (Compare the students who do community
service or have a role in a musical or
write for The Phoenix to students
who shelve books in the library for
four years. Let me give you a context:
The medical school interviewer leans
back with a smile and says, "So tell
me about your extracurriculars.")
We also shouldn't be surprised if
people who graduate with a debt decide to pass up much-yearned-for
opportunities that pay little or noth-

ing. An aspiring novelist might abandon that aspiration for several years
to repay loans. And maybe after those
years, this person will no longer have
the heart to reach for that dream.
We're hurting our students. As a
faculty member, I am treating my
students unequally. I'm ashamed.
It would cost a lot to befair. So what?
Valuable things sometimes cost a lot.
Indeed, what I'd love to see is expensive. But we can do it—Swarthmore manages to do whatever it decides is right. Right would be for all
students to have no financial obligation to the college—rich and poor
alike. No tuition costs. No room and
board costs. And every student should
do service work to the college or the
larger community. We are a community of scholars dedicated to sharing
responsibility for our world. This is
still a Quaker school in many ways.
We should live the best of that tradition. We should start a massive capital fund drive. Now.

student input on decisions will ensure that sit-in was not in vain.
Nancy

Benson-Nicol

What good was the protest? For
starters, the sit-in led to an open meet-

ing with members of the administration not only to discuss issues of
inadequate studentrepresentation, but
also to discuss methods of improving
the current system. Recently, Student Council, along with President
Bloom and Provost Jennie Keith, formulated a plan and presented it to the
Committee on Faculty Procedures.
Benson-Nicol is SC co-coordinator
and a member of the College Planning Committee.

The plan increases the number of
students on various committees, and,
in some cases, provides a student
presence on committees currently
devoid of students. Along with increased studentpresence, parameters
for the nature and amount ofinformation studentrepresentatives can share
with the student body during decision-making processes are under deliberation.These are steps in the right
direction. Ensuring that student input
is considered and implemented within
committee deliberations will, we
hope, dispel the confusion and disgust that surrounded the issue of financial aid this semester, and prevent

similar problems in the future.
Specifically, on the issue of diversity in the scope offinancial aid planning and beyond, the protest and sitin expressed on a grand scale the
value students place on maintaining
the diversity of this campus. As a
result, the College (including the
Board of Managers) reaffirmed its
goals to maintain and increase diversity at Swarthmore. When concerned
students around campus engage in
dialogue with administrative bodies
regarding aspects of diversity, their
concerns cannot be downplayed or
minimized. Real dialogue and concrete action must follow.

What it all means: hard spending choices that no one wants to make.
By Andy Feldman

My contribution is for those who,
like me, asked "WHAT IS THIS FINANCIAL AID DISCUSSION
ABOUT?" I will share with you what
I've learned. The issue centers on a
financial fact of life. As the percentage of students on financial aid increases, the College has two options.
The first option is to limit the perFeldman is president of the senior
class, a member of theBoard ofManagers Student Life Committee, and a
former SC co-coordinator.

centage of the College budget dedicated to financial aid and therefore
give less aid to each student in need.
The second option is to continue increasing the percentage of the budget
devoted to financial aid. Prima facie,
the second option sounds better. However, increasing financial aid involves
either cutting spending elsewhere,
raising tuition, or raising outside
funds. No solution is clear or easy.
The focus of the College Budget
Committee (CBC), I have been told,
had been on the first option (limiting
the percentage of the budget devoted
to financial aid) rather than the sec-

ond (working to find ways to fund an
increase in this percentage). Some
Student Council members felt this
was wrong, so they gathered student
support to change the CBC's focus.
I believe a campus-wide discussion about financial aid would be
most useful if it focused on the ramifications of implementing each of the
budgetary options available. After all,
these policy decisions do not involve
conspiracies or mean people who
want to cut aid to students. Instead,
they involve groups of people with
different visions of how to deal with
increasing demand for financial aid.

Achieving true diversity means more than tinkering with financial aid.
By Seth Harvey

As a black student interested in
achieving better ethnic representation, and as a former Student Council
co-coordinator, I am disappointed by
the Student Council' s misguided tactics. None of the student constituencies were consulted about their views
on the diversity issue, nor were any
included in planning the so called sitin for diversity via financial aid. Instead, there was misconfiguration and
distortion of the efforts of groups like

a

SASS to make Swarthmore a more
representative environment.
The Council waspresumptuous and
factually incorrect in arrogating the
responsibility of promoting diversity
by linking it solely to the financial aid
policies of the college. This not only
undermined the group efforts of students and administrators alike, but
also painted a one-sided face on the
ways to achieve such an important
end. Diversity is a multidimensional
issue that embraces class, race, and
gender, and the means of achieving
diversecampusrepresentation are just
as complex as the issue itself. Simple
conclusions of smaller financial aid

leading to decreased diversity are

flawed, considering that many of the
students across racial lines who consider Swarthmore are not underprivileged. Campus groups interested in
this issue are attempting to solve it by
working with the admissions office.
If Student Council really wants to
look at diversity, why doesn't it get
the facts straight by listening to and
understanding the administration's
view, challenging the administration
to create better solutions, and then
getting students involved in the diversity challenge through reasoned
debate? Unfortunately, the long-term
approach promises no quickrewards.

The College is working to maintain its aid policy despite rising costs. More student activism and dissent might accelerate the pace of change.
By

Al Bloom

I am writing to reaffirm, particularly in light of the unwarranted anxieties that surfaced several weeksago,
that there has been no change whatsoever in theCollege's continued vigorous commitment to need-blind admissions and to meeting full demonstrated financial need. Need-blind
admission ensures that admissions
decisions are made without regard
to—in fact, without knowledge of
an applicant's financial circumstances
and, therefore, that financial considerations do not constrain theCollege' s
selection of the very best candidates
in its applicant pool. (The policy does
not apply to international students,
where at the margin some students
are not admitted because meeting their
full demonstrated need would require
overspending a set aid budget for this
group.) Meeting full demonstrated
need ensures that all students who are
admittedand enroll can afford to come
here. Both policies spring from the
College's deeply felt dual responsibilities to fairness and excellence.
These same core responsibilities
come into play in the construction of
the annual budget and in the annual
decision over allocation to financial
aid. The cost of the finest undergraduate education is extremely
high—of attracting and facilitating
the creative work of an extraordinary
faculty and staff, of maintaining the
College's exceptional 8.5:1 facultystudent ratio, of providing supports
and opportunities within and outside

the academic program which foster
the kind of educational engagement
that best prepares students for leadership of a diverse and complex world.
Moreover, and unfortunately, the cost
of thateducationalexcellence is likely
to continue to rise at a rate which is
faster than inflation, for the reason
alone that Swarthmore is committed
to, and should, continue to define the
leading edge of academic pursuit and
educational practice and that we depend on the talents of a great many
individuals to achieve that goal.
The consequence is that, although
the College has a very healthy endowment, if it is to remain as excellent as it has been, tuition must continue to rise and so must the amount
students on financial aid will be asked
to borrow against those rising costs.
Yet to be fair to full-paying students
the College has a responsibility to
constrain the' rate of increase in tuition, as it has over the past few years.
(The increase in tuition and fees at
Swarthmore last year and this year
was 4.5 percent, a rate below those of
our comparative institutions, and next
year the increase will be only 4.3
percent.) And to be fair to students on
financial aid, the College has a responsibility to make sure that they
are not asked to borrow more than are
students at comparable colleges (so
that financial considerations do not

constitute inducements to choose
against or leave Swarthmore), and that
they are not asked to accumulate what
we believe is excessive debt, no matter what other institutions do.
Presently, the amount Swarthmore
actually spends for each student for

the four year period is approximately
$165,000 (net of financial aid). Using next year's rate of tuitionand fees
as a base, the cost charged to each
full-paying student is approximately
$ 108,000; while against these costs a
current senior can expect to accumulate only about $13,000 in debt.
Each year, being fair to both fullpaying students and financial aid students, while sustaining the excellence
of the educational program, the reason why students are here, requires a
difficultbalance, but I can assure you
that the College will not forsake any
side of that balance. We lookforward
to continuing dialogue with students,
staff and faculty to make sure that the
guidelines we set for achieving these
balances over the long term are as
wise and as just as they can be.

Jude Uzonwanne

The recent Student Council sit-in
took place for many reasons. One
that has stuck in my mind ever since
that event is this: the need to have
more students participate in the
College's decision making process.
Never in my life have I participated
in a sit-in. I recall from my time in
Nigeria that university students and
faculty would riot or strike when they
came up against an obstinate administration, or federal government as
the case tended to be. In Nigeria,
students are highly politicized because the intellectual environment

Board of Managers.

demands that they be so to thrive.
In theUnited States, you don'thave
the same level of tension between
academia and government, or
academia and students; hence, the
patterns and style of protest are radically different. In Nigeria, I became
used to demonstrations; since I came
to this country, I have learned that
Americans are more comfortable with
remonstration. This knowledge
played a part in many of the strategy
sessions we had while planning the
sit-in. In addition, the sit-in and the
series of events that led to it mostly
followed this pattern —polite appeals
to students in Sharpies asking for
their support and eventually, a polite
deposition to the Board of Managers.
While I thoroughly enjoyed the
challenge presenting the proposal to

the Board was, I did not feel very
comfortable with the way the sit-in
divided the campus. However being
a pragmatic moralist (at least in politics), one has to recognize that, on
occasion, the legendary Quaker consensus must be given the boot.
Finally, I hope that Swatties, faculty and the administration, will not
draw negative conclusions about the
sit-in. Dissent is vital to promote a
democratic culture. It is even better
when such dissent is accompanied by
solid proposals for change. At the sitin and in the series ofpost-sit-in meetings, Student Council and other interested parties presented such proposals. We believe that, if acted upon
with a genuine spirit, these ideas will
help heal the wounds opened that
cold, damp Saturday morning.

Controversy highlights need for better communication between student body and representatives.
By

Frank Kuo-Hui Yu

The controversy, panic, and misunderstanding over financial aid have
exposed the imperfect communication between students, faculty and
administration.While students might
have justifiably protested the apparent decrease in funding allocated to
financial aid packages, the issue was
shrouded in confusion and misunderstanding. Who is the culprit? The SC
representatives who couldn't reveal
everything they knew? The Phoenix,
which perpetuated misconceptions?
The administration, which insists on
confidentiality during committees'
decision-making processes? The students who reacted too impulsively
without information? A Student
Council overly dependent on word of
mouth for communication?
There are many problems to address, but changing communication
structures should be the first emphasis, because it could address immediate and longstanding problems
through fundamental structural
change. Let me use a problem I encounter on the Council on Educational Policy to illustrate my point.
As a student representative on CEP,
I strive to represent students to the
best of my ability. Yet I don't feel
empowered. The administration does
not limitmy voice in the meeting, and
I feel perfectly comfortable setting
an agenda. Other committee members are good listeners, but I'm not a
confident speaker. The problem is
that I don't feel legitimate. I try to
talk to at least three to four students
Yu sits on the Council on Educational
Policy and is a former SC member.

beforehand on the issues which will
be discussed in the meeting. Yet, in
the meeting, I feel I am representing
myself or a select group of students,
but not the entire student body. The
traditional structure that asks representatives to talk to SC and to students is inadequate. I ask for a system
which would allow more students to
actively participate in the decision
process, so student representatives
are not seen as simultaneously allknowing (when the administration
attempts to demonstrate that it takes
students into account) and illegitimate (when student representatives'
lack ofknowledge prevents them from
arguing persuasively).

A new system on educational policy
might look like this: each department
would have student liaisons (many
already have); students liaisons from
each department would meet monthly
with administrators to discuss academic issues; specific liaisons would
be invited to CEP meeting when pertinent issues are discussed.
On the "micro" level, student liaisons would enable departments to
become more aware of shifting student interests, to adjust their offerings accordingly, and to improve their
teaching methods and offerings with
student feedback; on the "macro"
scale, CEP would be well-informed
by both SC representatives and stu-

dent liaisons who are up to date on
specific issues. Furthermore, the
monthly meeting of liaisons will allow students to identify broader educational issues which may not arise
in regular CEP meetings.
The system described above is not
unattainable. It will encourage active
student participation and lead to more
extensive communication about educational policy. Of course, there is
room for innovation in other areas as
well. In light of the recent controversy, I ask that we all avoid becoming confrontational or defensive; I
suggest a new structure which will
result in active participation and vigilant and sincere listening.

Questions remain on the Colleges commitment to preserving aid policy.

Sean Barney

The cultural and economic state in
which Americafinds itself as it moves
into the 21 st century makes it more
important than ever that Swarthmore
College commit to upholding its traditional ideals. Swarthmore's values
and commitment to them are unique
in higher education, and the success
of its enterprise cannot always be
measured by simplistic comparisons
to the mean performance of"the COFI
schools" or the schools that U.S. News
& World Report deems our rivals. As
the College declares in its mission
statement, "Each [college] must select those tasks it can do best. By such
selection it contributes to the diversity and richness of educational opportunity which is part of the American heritage."

Barney is the SC Charter Chair.

Never before in America's history
has educational opportunity been
more vital to society's future. The
country has failed to invest in its
youth and has salved its conscience
by condescending to them as Generation X. If it is true that Student Council made a fuss over nothing—if the
College'scommitment to opening the
doors ofSwarthmore to all who work
hard and make the grade is unwavering—l am glad to hear it. But it is still
significant thatPresident B loom made
the explicit promise to students, at
the Monday open meeting following
the sit-in, that the financial aid cap
would be removed if it became an
obstacle to the College's commitment to meeting all demonstrated
need while keeping loan burdens low.
Three days earlier he had informed
the Board of Managers Student Life
Committee that, assuming the cap
remained in place, it would be impos-

sible to finance financial aid in the
future without raising loans higher
than the College has said it would.
If only in opening the dialogue to a
wider community and encouraging
some explicit reaffirmation of the
ideological commitment of the College to meeting need, the student action in appealing to the Board of
Managers was a success. But the most
important issue was left unresolved,
and fundamental questions still remain. Such as: What does it mean to
"meet all demonstrated need?" Do
higher loans actually represent, as
many students feel, "negative aid"
and a real failure to "meet need?"It is
through their participation in the process by which the College undertakes
to answer questions like these that
the additional student representatives
to the major College committees will
have an opportunity to make a telling
difference over the coming years.

"Pippin" Impressive Despite Flaws
Jonathan Seitz

By

What

do Charlemagne, the Holy
Roman Empire and steel cone
bras have in common? I'm not
sure, either, but it makes for an interesting
show. When the curtain rose on the opening scene of "Pippin," Swarthmore's latest
musical drama, it was clear that the director
had taken on a huge task. The cast is large,
the space is large, and the play is, well, a bit
on the longish side.
Directed by Steven Svoboda '9B and
choreographed by Svoboda and a host of
assistants, the story of Pippin's search for
"perfection and fulfillment" has bright spots
and not so bright spots. The vocals are
generally strong, though sometimes washed
out by the somewhat wind-heavy pit orchestra. Courtney Clark '9B is impressive
as the Leading Player; Dan Barnes '99 is
strong as Pippin, if he occasionally lacks
spark; and VanessaCarter '99 is quite good
as grandmother Berthe. (Note that your

performance may vary as several parts are
double-cast.)
Despite the rather thin instrumentation,
the orchestra does well, though the songs
occasionally drag on a bit long. The entire
production, in fact, suffers from a slight
sluggishness, which could be attributed to
long hours in the run-up to opening night as
well as thesmall and none-too-lively crowd
that attended Wednesday night's performance.

The choreography is, in general, nothing
particularly creative, but there are occasional flashes of originality—generally
when the sado-masochistic theme is developed. You thought I was joking about the
steel cone bras, didn't you? As far as I
know, "Pippin" is only the second show in
the past four years which has had a sex
scene on stage. And the first to be accompanied by scantily-clad dancers.
The set is well-done, but fails to keep the
cavern that is the LP AC main stage from
dwarfing the cast. The costuming and light-

ing are also generally well-done. There
were several technical hitches during
Wednesday's performance, from botched
cues to false starts by singers, but hopefully
the adage that "opening night is the night
before the play is ready to open" holds true
for "Pippin," and all will be smooth for the
remainder of the run.
Svoboda clearly took on a momentous
task in staging a show of this magnitude—no one has dared to produce a major musical here since "Jesus Christ Superstar" three
years ago. Svoboda also had a harder time
than most in producing this show, which
started out as "A Chorus Line" but was
changed after a royalty dispute.
So, if the opening performance was a
little bit rough around the edges, that does
not detract from the intense work put in by
Svoboda, the cast, and the crew, who manage to produce a massive show about the
relentless quest for a perfect and fulfilling
life— something to which all of us idealistic Swatties can surely relate.

A Theme Weekend of Unnecessary Violence
By

Jonathan Evans and Jessica Keith

Jessica: This weekend is...
Jonathan: Kathryn Bigelow weekend.
Jessica: Yes. Both movies were directed by
Kathryn Bigelow, one of Hollywood's leading female writers/directors and ex-wife of
producer James Cameron ("Aliens," "Terminator," etc.)
Jonathan: Ms. Bigelow should also beknown
as Ms. Unnecessary Violence.
Jessica: Although I don't usually like to pan
movies outright, there is no way around it.
"Point Break" is a bad movie. I don'trecommend it—unless you have a deep interest in
pain or you can be interested for over two
hours by Keanu Reeves' half-naked body.
Keanu is "Johnny Utah," a rookie FBI
agent in L.A. who goes undercover as a surfer
in order to catch an infamous gang of bank
robbers known as the "Ex-Presidents." He
learns to surf in about a week and becomes
part of a group of surf-bums led by Bodhi
(Patrick Swayze ). Bodhi teaches Johnny to
search for the ultimate thrills. Being a clever
Swattie, I bet you can guess what happens
next...Bodhi is leader of the Ex-Presidents.

There are some other parts of the plot, such
as Johnny's relationships with his veteran
FBI partner Pappas (Gary Busey) and a random surf chick (Lori Petty). These parts,
however, are completely underdeveloped—a
shame, since Busey and Petty are the only
decent actors. The movie focuses on various
chases, fights, action sequences, and general
unnecessary violence; I watched the last
twenty minutes in fast forward. Trust me—don't waste your precious Swarthmore time.
Jonathan: Okay, "Strange Days"...lt's
been months now since I saw this movie, and
I still don'tknow whetherI liked it or not. I do
know one thing: if you are at all unsettled by
rape scenes, stay away from this movie.
What Bigelow does with the visual stimulus is still incredible, and makes the movie
worth seeing. Unfortunately, where she goes
wrong is in some of the visual scenes. Hell,
filming Juliette Lewis is generally a mistake.
The plot: the year is 1999, and the end of
the millennium is coming and ex-cop Lenny
Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is dealing in a new
form of virtual reality—data discs of other
people's memories. One day, Lenny gets a
disc that contains a murderer killing a prosti-

tute. He gets dragged into a conspiracy that

could overthrow society as they know it. This
conspiracy reflects stuff in today's headlines, so it strikes fairly close to home.
That's the main plot. The subplots are that
Lenny is obsessed with his ex-girlfriend,Faith
Justin (Juliette Lewis), to a point that goes
way beyond any form of pathetic that I've
had the pleasure of experiencing. Lornette
"Mace" Mason (Angela Bassett) and Max
Peltier (Tom Sizemore) are Lenny's friends,
and get dragged into the mess. The casting
director must have wanted two good actors to
balance outtwo bad ones. Lewis and Sizemore
are awful, but Fiennes ("Schindler's List,"
"Quiz Show") and Bassett ("What's Love
Got to Do with It?") rock the world.
Bigelow, combined with Cameron who
produces and writes this flick, likes to throw
a lot at the audience. Cameron in particular
seems slightly obsessed with post-apocalyptic dystopias, and his influence is quite obvious in this film. However, they do an excellent job of giving an audience their money's
worth, and "Strange Days" is no exception.
Jessica: Okay. We're done.
Jonathan: Buh-bye.

Off-Campus Movie

Richard Gere's Talented Arrogance Makes "Primal Fear" Worthwhile Film
By

Richard

lan Bricke

Gere plays arrogant jerks bet

ter than just about anyone in Holly

wood. He crinkles up the crow's feet
around his eyes and flashes a coy little grin,
and somehow manages to be both utterly
slimy and utterly charming. Martin Vail, the
hotshot defense lawyer that Gere portrays in
"Primal Fear," is a perfect fit. The character,
as written, is magnificently shallow, but
Gere's persona lends him a swagger and a
cocksure self-consciousness that keeps you
watching, even when the rest of the films
seems to be going through the usual paces.
Ten minutes into "Primal Fear," the Archbishop of Chicago is brutally murdered,
stabbed 78 times, his corpse horribly muti-

lated. The police find one of the Archbishop's
altar boys, cherub-faced Aaron Stampler
(newcomer Edward Norton), cowering under
a train track, soaked in the Archbishop's
blood and clutching the murder weapon.
It looks like an open and shut case. Which
means that Martin Vail, drawn to the case by
the prospect of free publicity, has his work
cut out for him if he's going to save Aaron.
Particularly since his former lover, Janet
Venable (Laura Linney), has been assigned
to the prosecution and his former boss, the
District Attorney (John Mahoney), has all but
ordered him to keep his nose out of the late
Archbishop's business dealings.
Assisted by a private investigator (Andre
Braugher) and a psychiatrist (Frances
McDormand), Vail sets out to unravel a de-

ceptively simple case and, in the process,
unearths a lot of dirty laundry that the assorted powers-that-be would rather not have

publicly displayed.
As the plot winds through twist after twist,
it becomes pretty apparent that the mystery is
a lot less complicated than it looks. The
screenwriters, Ann Biderman and Steve
Shagan, adapting WilliamDiehl' s 1993 bestseller, do their best to pad out the running
time, beefing up several more or less superfluous subplots. The scenes involving the
District Attorney and his shady business connections go absolutely nowhere. Ditto for the
tired romantic banter that Linney and Gere
toss back and forth (although the film, thankfully, spares us the usual passionate romantic
reconciliation).

After trudging through the overly-familiar
for two hours, "Primal Fear" pulls off a genuine surprise in its last ten minutes, although it
lingers a little too long over its final revelations. Directed with gritty craftsmanship by
first-timer Gregory Hoblit (the veteran of
innumerable TV cop shows), "Primal Fear"
looks good, but it lacks dramatic oomph,
despite James Newton Howard's overly emphatic score. The result is a slightly better
than average thriller, helped immeasurably
by a first-rate cast and by Michael Chapman' s
brooding cinematography.
Gere is a treat to watch, putting his trademark spin on otherwise unremarkable dialogue. Laura Linney can't quite match him—her thin little speaking voice doesn't carry
much weight in the heat of their courtroom

sparring. Frances McDormand (who gives
the best performance of her career, and of the
year, in "Fargo") could probably play the
psychiatrist in her sleep, but her performance
suggests human dimensions to this character
far beyond what the screenplay allows. Andre
Braugher, John Mahoney, and Alfre
Woodward (as the no-nonsense judge presiding over Aaron's trial) do good work, considering the limitations of their roles.
But the movie belongs to Edward Norton,
a New York stage actor in his first film role,
whose performance as Aaron is simultaneously cunning and endearing. Norton's
scenes with Gere and McDormand have a
kick that the rest of the film, to its detriment,
lacks. He's one to watch, even if "Primal
Fear" isn't.

was April of 1941. Europe was at war,
and most of the discussion in The Phoenix
revolved around matters of international
politics—when it wasn't about the proper
role of fraternities on campus or whether
male and female students should be permitted to sit at mixed table in the Dining Hall.
And then Edwin R. Embree gave a lecture
on"The Place of the American Negro in Democracy Today."
Embree talked about the history of blacks
in America. The Phoenix quoted him as saying, "The Negro is denied equal rights and
opportunities in a nation theoretically a democracy of equals." He talked about the
treatment of opera singer Marian Anderson.
And he pointed out that no Negro student had
ever been admitted to Swarthmore.
It certainly wasn't true that no black student had ever applied to Swarthmore.
Walton's Swarthmore College: An Informal
History tells the story of a successful applicant around the turn of the century whose
acceptance was withdrawn after the college
realized his race.
Again, in 1932, an otherwise qualified
Negro student applied to Swarthmore. Dean
Hunt related, "The admission of colored students had never been approved by the Board
of Managers, and so the Admissions Committee referred the application to the Board.
After a long discussion it was decided by a
large majority that Negro students could not
yet be admitted to a coeducational college

Over the next few years,77ie Phoenix carried many stories of SCRR sponsored lectures, art exhibits, and other events. In April
of 1942, they arranged forPeaslee debaters to
face debaters from Lincoln University (a black
college), in Bond, "on the question of forming an international military body to enforce
peace at war's end." In September, they sponsored a picnic and softball game against a
"group of Negro college students at present

"The real victors were the mosquitoes, which
showed equal impartiality and lack of prejudice in their warm-up for the coming
picnic...after having vanquished hunger and
thirst, there was an informal singing under
the leadership of Dean Hunt, ending with an
enthusiastic 'God Bless America.'" A Phoenix editorial in September of 1943 noted that
the last lecturer brought to campus by the
SCRR taught a large number of students that
many Negroes were, in fact, unsatisfied with
the status quo!
By this time, Walton's Swarthmore College: An Informal History reports that Negro
students were attending the college as members of the Naval V-12 unit stationed here. By
1945, an SCRR memorandum on the admission of Negro students had been approved by
the Board of Managers; students were now to
be admitted regardless ofrace, color, or creed.

SPORTS
Men's Ultimate Strong at Tournament Swat Rugby Teams Sweep Millersville
By

Dave Sacker

and

Dave Lewis

The Swarthmore College Men's
UltimateFrisbee Team battledits way
to a solid 3-1 record last weekend at
the Queen's Cup Tournament at
Rutgers University. The team entered
the tournament seeded second in their
pool, reinforcing the high expectations of the players and tournament
coordinators. However, few could
have predicted the kind of day
Swarthmore would have.
In the opening game against a
scrappy Brown team, theEarthworms
lived up to their reputation as slow
starters, losing the contest 4-9. The
team appeared sluggish and lethargic
after their trip and reacted slowly to
the quick Brown offense. The Brown
team played an uncommon style of
defensethatadded to their early morning woes of the Swarthmore squad.
Though all agreed that Swarthmore
was the more talented of the teams, it
was Brown who prevailed in this contest. The lone bright spot for
Swarthmore came in the postgame
cheer, where the team awed Brown
by rhyming "Naragansett" in the final stanza.
Success on the field came soon
after as the Swarthmore team faced a
outlandish collection of players from
SUNY-Purchase. "They're like the
Bad News Bears!" commented Rob
Eberhardt '9B. Despite their appearance, however, the Purchase team
played with a lot of heart but succumbed to the more experienced
Swarthmore squad 13-1.
Ali Momeni '97, co-captain Robin
Mandel '97, and Seth Murray '9B led
the Earthworm's early morning
charge, scoring 11 of the teams 17
points over the two contests. Momeni
also contributed 10 assists after a
slow start. The Earthworms were
hoping that thePurchase game would
serve as an indicator of things to
come as Swarthmore's next contest
was against perennial powerhouse
Princeton, who had been shredding
their opponents all day.
From the start, the PrincetonSwarthmore match proved to be a

as did Murray and Eberhardt.
In the last match of the day, the
Earthworms battled fatigue, cold, and
increasing darkness in shortened contest with a tough Maryland team.
Swarthmore again prevailed, this time
9-7, as Momeni and Clayton led the
way. Eight different Swarthmore
players scored points in this game, as
the Earthworms tried to spread the
wealth around, resting many starters
for long stretches of time. Mandel

The match lasted over two hours,
with each side completing its share of
fantastic plays. Robin Mandel '97
and Ali Momeni '97 were the key
duo, combining for nine points and
nine assists. However, after Mandel
went down with an injury late in the
contest, the team showed true heart.
With Princeton threatening game

outscoring Princeton 4-1 in the final
twenty minutes for a thrilling 14-13

Evil Buzzard's Forwards Dominant on Both Sides of the Ball

Sturm

Swarthmore Men's Rugby dominated Millersville on both sides of
the ball Saturday in cruising to a 3610 victory. Millersville had trouble
grasping some of the basic rules of
the game, which led to numerous
penalties. "I think their game plan
was to injure as many of us as possible to try to get us below 15 players," said Bryce Walker '97.
Swarthmore controlled the ball
from the start, allowing Millersville
across midfield only twice in the first
half. Chaz Teplin '96 scored the first
try, taking a quick penalty and diving
into the tryzone. His conversionmade
it 7-0.
For the whole game, the Evil Buzzards were nearly unstoppable from
their lineouts, scoring three times in
the first half, off of impressive drives
by the forward pack. Jason Dougal
'96 scored two of these tries after

Women's Ultimate Frisbee at Rutgers

On Saturday April 6, the
Warmothers traveled to Rutgers for
the Queens' Tournament. They
started off the day by arriving an hour
late (not their fault) for a tough game
against host Shakti from Rutgers and
then quickly moving on to rumble
with UPenn' s Venus. During the second half of the UPenn game, the
Warmothers picked up their level of
play a notch and scored a quick three

points.
Cathy Wirth '99 claims the reason

for this tremendous offensive spurt to
be "the female energy of the wind."
Becca Neff '97 showed fast thinking
when after a failed attempt by the
team at a play affectionately called
"matzah," Neff recovered with a
stealth cut to the corner to receive a
sharp toss-off from Gabi KruksWisner '99.

Princeton was their next opponent.
Although fond ofPrinceton's Clockwork Orange, Neff pondered, "Why
would anyone wear orange voluntarily?" The Warmofhers soon learned
that when you play as smoothly as
Princeton, you could wear whatever
color you wanted, and no one would
laugh. Feeling the pressure of"
Princeton's tough defense in one particularplay, Wirth was forced to throw
her specialty, a banking forehand,
along the sideline to captain Erika
Baumgartner '9B in the endzone.
Baumgartner caught the disk with
grace and ease in a remarkable layout.

The day ended for the Warmothers
against ColumbiaUniversity. Besides
the extreme drop in temperature, the
one thing the women remember most
vividly about the game against Columbia was the point when the
Warmothers showed a beautiful flow

ending with a pass from Lena
Loewenthal '97 to a surprised Neff in
the endzone.
During Saturday's play, the
Warmothers did not focus solely on
scoring, they also worked on refining
their playing ability. Baumgartner
reminded her teammates, when on
defense, they should watch their opponents' hips, not their eyes. Everyone agreed with her advice and saw
as they implemented it, their defense
was more intense and harder to break.
As biology major Georgine Yorgey
'9B pointed out, "we are creatures of
habit." The Queens' Tournament was
a successful day for all who went.
The Warmothers spent thehours frolicking in central Jersey with frisbees
and friends. The women had fun while
working hard to improve their game
so bless the matzah and pass the
disk.

especially long drives, with Matt
Miller '96 supplying the third try.
Walker was, as ever, an instrumental
part of these lineouts. He and Eric
"Duke" Ellingson '96 powered the
drives, often carrying theball 20yards
up the field. With these tries and
Teplin's two conversions, Swarthmore entered the second half with a
comfortable lead of 24-0.
The backs played a fine game, although they played a primarily defensive role due to the dominance of
the forward pack. One of their back
lines early in the second half led to
Dougal's third try, after some fine
play by Adam Blescia '97.
Swarthmore enjoyed good field
position as a result of frequent

Millersville penalties, with Teplin's
kicks keeping them on their back
heels throughout the game.
Millersville then finally got on the
scoreboard, converting a penalty kick
to make the score 31-3. Swarthmore
responded with a quick Teplin try off
a ruck, and Millersville scored a late
try to finish the scoring. Overall, this
game showcased Swarthmore's ability to outclass an opponent through
skill and clean play, despite
Millersville's frequent attempts to
degenerate the game into a brawl.
Swarthmore's B-side fell 12-7, although there were many signs of improvement in the young team. The
lone Swarthmore try was scored by
visiting Lafayette player Rob Tufts.

Women Ruggers Shut Out Opponents 22-0
By

Annie Bacon

The women's team trounced
Millersville last Saturday by a lopsided score of 22-0. The B-side was
also victorious. "One of the strong
points in both of Saturday's games
was the continual support the forwards and backs each gave each
other," said co-captain Kelly Shannon '96.
It was clear that the forwards were
playing smart; they anticipated where
they were needed and didn't go into
every ruck. In addition/the back lines
were ready to run a play the second
the scrum-half got the ball out of the
ruck.
The scrums in Saturday's game
were one-sided. Swarthmore plowed
over the Millersville forwards time
after time, as they not only won almost every ball, but pushed
Millersville backwards on every engage.
Swarthmore remained true to its

game plan despite the fact that
Millersville was playing a different
style of game. "Although we still
need to work on it a little more, we
managed to closely maintain our level
of play against Millersville" said cocaptain Rebecca Cole '96.
The first A-side try was scored by
Hanan Hussein '97. Shannon scored
a try from a strong advance off a
quick penalty play in a move similar
to the one she made last weekend.
Andrea Barnett '97 dominated the
second half of the game and scored
the remaining 12 points with two
tries and a conversion. Barnett played
an exceptional game. She made the
conversion kick after Shannon's try
and then proceeded to score two consecutive tries in the last five minutes
of the game.
The B-side game looked very good
as well. The gamewas scoreless until
the last few minutes, when Charity
Miller' 98 scored her first try to claim
the 5-0 victory.

New Women's Hoops Coach Hired
Former Bates College Star Adrienne Shibles Replaces Donna Davis
By

Anne Frankenfield

Thereis no better way than to start
a new season with a new coach.
Adrienne Shibles, an accomplished
player and experienced coach recently joined Swarthmore athletics
by taking over the reigns as the new
women's head basketball coach.
Shibles graduated from a small
high school in the "sticks" of Maine
where, she commented, about the
only thing to do to keep oneselfbusy
was to play sports. While there, she
played several sports including softball and soccer, and began her career in basketball. Her Mount View
high school team was pretty good,

traveling to the state championships
a couple times but never bringing
home the crown.
After graduation, Coach Shibles
attended Bates College, also in
Maine, where she pursued a history
degree with a concentration in
American studies. She played both
softball and basketball, and worked
as a student athletic trainer, but it

was in basketball where she left her
mark as the Bobcats 1,000 point
scorer and all-time leading
rebounder.
Finishing her undergraduate studies, Shibles went to Boston where
she worked for a law firm and contemplated law school. During this
time, she took a part-time job as
assistant women' s basketball coach
at nearby Babson College. She
coached for a year, decided she
wanted a career in coaching and
leftthe law firm.taking a new job as
the assistant women's basketball
and soccer coach at Colby College
in Maine. Shealso accepted a position as the head softball coach at
her old high school.
Shibles coached at Colby for two
years, then moved on to Smith College in Massachusetts, where she is
presently finishing up her graduate
studies in Exercise and Sports Studies with an emphasis in collegiate
coaching. At Smith, she has a teaching fellowship which allows her to
teach, coach, and attend classes. In

The men's lacrosse team entered

Centennial Conference play this past
week travelling to two schools that
will likely enter the national playoffs: Western Maryland, and Franklin
and Marshall. While someday the
Garnet hope to be on the same level
as these teams, the men were blown
out in both contests, losing 16-4 and
17-7, respectively.
The Garnet came out strong against
Western Maryland, withBen Seigel
'96 scoring the first goal ofthe game.
The Green Terror were stunned at
first, but then scored four straight
goals to end the first quarter.
The Garnet had a chance to climb
back into the game when the Green
Terror picked up a three minute penalty for an illegal stick, but the manup offense threw the ball away, and
Western Maryland controlled the ball
until the penalty ran out. This momentum swing was too much for the
Garnet to handle, as they needed to
capitalize on such a great opportunity. Western Maryland ended up
controlling the rest of the game, running away with a big victory. Garnet
goals were scored by Seigel (2), Pat
Donaghy '9B, and Will Craig '96.
On Wednesday, the Garnet travelled to Lancaster to face number
seven Franklin & Marshall. The game
was a reunion of sorts for Coach Pat
Gress, who coached the last two seasons there. While the odds were

heavily on F&M to win, the Garnet
were geared to improve upon their
last loss. However, because of class
conflicts, the Garnet were only able
to muster up 15players, compared to
the 45 on the opponent's sideline.
The lack of players would hurt the
Garnet, as they couldn'tkeep up with
the fresh legs of the Diplomats.
The high powered F&M offense
scored early and often, leading to an
8-2 first quarter deficit that was too
much to overcome. But Gress wasn't
ready to give up, and neither was the
team. For the next two quarters, the
Garnet outplayed the nationalpower,
scoring five goals and playing excellentthirdquarterdefense. "lamproud
ofyou guys for not giving up," Coach
Gress said to the team after the game.
"They are a very solid team and you
fought with them until the end."
Craig played his best game of the
year, finishing withthree goals. Adam
Macßeth '99 also played a strong
game, adding two goals of his own.
Erik Griffin '96 and Andy Place '96
closed out the scoring for the Garnet.
Dickinson is next on the bill for the
Garnet, a game which will be played
at home on Saturday. The conference
schedule continues when the Garnet
hosts Washington Wednesday. Presently at 2-6, the Garnet hopes to go
above .500 in their last five games of
the season.

Frank Amar

After one of their most successful
stretches in recent memory, the Garnet Tide hit the skids, losing three in
a row before notching a win on
Wednesday.
Last Thursday, neighboring Widener paid a visit to Clothier Field.
The visiting Pioneers brought out the
heavy artillery, blasting their way to
a 23-7 victory. Sam Voolich '96 was
the first victim for theWidener lineup,
surrendering five hits and five earned
runs over 2.1 innings.
The Widener hit parade continued,
as they wound up producing 19 hits
and 23 runs, season highs for the
Garnet Tide pitching staff.
The Garnet Tide looked to put the
drubbing behind them and get themselves back on course with a doubleheader at Washington. But instead of
reestablishing themselves in the conference race, the Garnet Tide suffered what might have been the low
point of their season, dropping both
games, 8-5 and 10-3. After Swarthmore staked an early 2-0 lead, the
Shoremen countered with two runs in
the second, third, fourth, and fifth
innings, putting the game out ofreach.
The Tide added three in the seventh,
but could get no further.
Game two began with a promising
start. Craig Rodner '96 singled to
lead off the game and scored on a
Matt Wiggins '96 ground out. The
Tide added two more, making the
score 3-0. The lead, however, was
very short-lived. Starter Chuck
Hudson '96 had a very short afternoon. One third of an inning, seven
hits and nine runs later, Hudson was
done. Ben Sousa '9B and Bonder
pitched well over the last 5.7 innings,

Salisbury State, Ursinus, Allentown,

Despite the behemouth Ursinus
throwers, Heather Mateyak '97, with
a little bit of skinny-girl intimidation
and a few grunts on the side, threw a
hefty 94'5" in the discus to cinch
third place. "Miss" Lucy Hunt '96
spun to 4th right behind Mateyak
while spunky Amy Cuthrell '97
scared the competition stiffless with
solid throws and barbaric yalps. In
the shot, Mateyak improved to 4th,
followed by Hunt putting in at sth.
Shifting gears from stand and spin
to run and jump, Swarthmore went
horizontal with Catherine Laine '9B
and Stephanie Herring '99, who captured 1 st in the triple jumpand 2nd in
the long jump, respectively.

addition to her job as assistant
women's soccer coach at Smith for
the past two seasons, she coached
women's basketball at Elms College, holding the head coach position this past season.
So what brought this successful
woman to Swarthmore? Coach
Shibles said that when she saw the
ad for the job, it spoke to her. She
liked the philosophy of a college
that puts academics first but has
dedicated athletes as well. She enjoys dealing withthe type ofathlete
Swarthmore attracts, and she is
looking forward to the upcoming
season. She feels that the women
are ready and want to improve and
is confident that the program is
going to go places.
One of the main things that impressed her about the school was
the people. She commented, "Everyone at Swat has been amazingly
friendly and helpful. That really
attracted me and I'm looking forward to getting down there and
jumping into [the job]."

Schirmer '97 drummed out a third
place finish while the West-coast
sweetheart Danielle Wall '9B (the
"Other" Danielle) hot-rodded across
the finish line in the 1500. The 800 m
race showcased the talent of Donna
Griffin '99, who placed 7th in a personal record of 2:34.8.
Leaping like fleas off Maggie the
fieldhouse mascot, Betsy Davis '96,
Herring, and Laine bounded to 4-3-2
finishes in the 100high hurdles. Leading off the co-ed 4Xjavelin, Mateyak
successfully speared Noah Daniels
'9B in the hand-off. Unfortunately,
the third leg was disqualified. Widener pulled through to finish first,
breaking their goose egg point total.
In the 400 hurdles Herring and Davis
placed 2-3, respectively.
In the 400m, the dynamic duo of
Wildonger and Duffy spanked the
competition, and both speedsters finished in under a minute to finish 1-2
with times of 59.5 and 59.9, respectively. Continuing her sucess, Laine
placed 2nd in the 100. Duffy then
sped to victory on winged-sandals aflame with speed with Wildonger
hobbling into 2nd. Debra Junilla '97
ran a passionate 3000, placing third
on the track. Spying the next place,
Ingrid Spies '96 finished fourth, returning to the oval after injuries.
Topping off the meet was the
4X400 relay, in which the
Swarthmore quartet of Duffy, Herring, Laine and Wildonger smoked
the competition. Laine ran a P.R. of
61.7 in her lead-off leg, and Davis'
P.R. of 64.0 guaranteed the women a
cushy lead to finish the race in a first
place with a time of 4:10.49.

Men Take Solid First
in Six-Way Meet
By

Nevin Katz

and

Eric Pakurar

The meet this past Saturday ended
on a note that had been resonating the
entire day: the men's 4x400m 'B'
relay squad of Tim Sibley '9B, Al
Molnar '97, Shan Sutherland '97,
and Wyn Strodtbeck '9B beat all five
opposing teams, coming second only
to Swat's 'A' squad of Eric Pakurar
'97, SamPaschel '96, Reuben Canada
'99, and Mike Turner '96.
The team had made statements like
this throughout the meet, showing
the competition that the depth and
strength of the Swarthmore track and
field team is nothing to be scoffed at.
The men's team schooled Salisbury
State, F & M, Allentown, Ursinus,
and Widener on their home Skallerup
track, leaving second place Salisbury
State a distant 44 points behind.
In the 1500m, Scott Reents '96
beat everybody with a time of 4:02,
and Phil Jones '99, running his swiftest yet, placed sth at a P.R of 4:11.
Brian Baird '99, Sutherland, and
Nate Mason' 99 epitomized the depth
and talent of the team, taking the top
three spots in the pole vault. Eric
Walton '97 and Mason Tootel '99
followed close behind with a onetwo in the javelin against paltry com-

petition.
Walton also took second in the
discus and fifth in the shot put, while
Ben Heuston '96 took fourth in the
high jump and Eric Pakurar '97 went

but the Garnet Tide did not recover.
The team hit the road and headed to
the Pennsylvania Dutch Country to
take on Franklin & Marshall, last
year's conference champion. The
Garnet Tide scored four runs in the
second inning, only to have the Diplomats tie the score in the bottom of
the frame. The Garnet Tide took the
lead for good with one in the third.
The Garnet Tide bats put the Diplomats out of their misery with six runs
in the seventh, putting the finishing

touches on a 14-4 rout. Pat Straub '97
led the way withthree hits, and Sousa,
Bonder, Matt Grossman '96, and
Wiggins added two hits.
Garnet Notes: The Garnet Tide
hosts Franklin & Marshall today at
3:30. The game is Matt Wiggins

Men's Tennis In Boston
By

Eddie Ernst

Last weekend the men's tennis
team, led by Marsha Mullen and her
husband Mike, headed to Boston for

matches with Harvard and M.I.T.
Coming off two tight losses at Williams and Amherst, the senior cocaptains demanded that their young
squad "raise a little hell." As the
weather all weekend was very cold,
both matches were played indoors
despite the pleadings of the newly
inspired Swarthmore players.
In a move that can only be described as ingenious, Coach Mullen
arranged for his team's match with
Harvard to begin within minutes of
their plane's landing in Boston.
The team managed to pull out a
couple of nice wins against the highcaliber ivy leaguers, but lost the
match. John Derderian '97 kept his
unbeaten streak alive while simply
ruining his opponent, and Barry Mook
second in the triple jump to round out
the field events.
The 400 m hurdle crew continued
their dominance of the event with a
first, third andfifth place, by Pakurar,
Tootel, and Molnar, respectively. In
the fast section of the 800, Strodtbeck
engaged in a highly strategic threeway battle, in which he came in at a
strong second at a time of 2:00. Before you could say "Liperschneitzel,"
John Freeman '96 had careened into
fifth at a time of 2:04, followed by a
gutsy Gordon Roble '99. Next came
Nevin Katz '99, winning his section
with a P.R. of 2:09.
In the 5000, Duncan Kirkpatrick
'99 brought in some serious cash
amidst fierce competition, placing
second with a time of 15:41, with Jeff
Lockman '9B coming through in a
P.R. of 18:28. Graham Lucks '9B
charged into 4th place with a time of
10:17 in the 3000 steeplechase.
This meet showed the mettle of
Swat track and field, putting them in
a good position coming into the
later—and tougher—portion of the
season.

m

'96 pulled out his first victory of the
year while showing why he is the
number one player. In doubles, Eddie
Ernst '9B and Nicholas Slimack '99,
proving that they aren't as bad as
they' ve looked, won a brilliant match
at the number two slot.
The real drama of the weekend
came on Saturday against M.I.T. in
what was a do-or-die situation for the
Swarthmore team. They needed a win
if they were to have any hope of
advancing on to the prestigious regional tournament in May... and win
they did!
After dropping the often decisive
doubles point, the Garnet singles lineup summarily slammed the hardpressed M.I.T. troopers, losing only
two matches. In one of those losses,
Roger Werner '9B played one of the
gutsiest, hard fought matches this eyewitness has ever seen.

Softball
Swings
into Action
By Mary

Beth Alvarez

These past weeks havebeen a tough
for Women's Softball. Two weeks
ago when the baseball team was putting up the good fight against Johns
Hopkins on a sunny Saturday afternoon, softball had a cancellation
against Gettysburg because the field
was still underwater. Luckily, Western Maryland managed to provide a
well-drained field last Thursday for
the team's first conference games on
the road.
The Green Terror women were
ready with the bats for the entire
doubleheader as they, tested the
boundaries of their field of rolling
hills. Swarthmore was clearly overpowered as both games were won
handily within five innings (16-0 and
16-2).
Amidst all that gloom and doom,
offensive honors go Michelle Walsh
'9B and Mary Beth Alvarez '9B for
both going two for three in the second
game. Walsh took one for a ride into
right field for a triple, and Alvarez
recorded the sole two runs batted in.
The first game saw an inexcusable
nine errors, but in the second game a
cleaner defense gave up only three
errors.
This past Saturday was another gray
one as the Garnet lost again to
Dickinson in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
Hopefully, we'll see a continuedtrend
toward more consistent defense as
they recorded only four errors in each
game and both were played out the
full seven innings.
The Garnet held Dickinson to five
runs in the first game, mostly due to
the amazing chemistry of their battery with AprylLehman '99 catching
and captain Dana Lehman '9B pitching.
Again, the offense did not kick in
until the second game when Lurah
Hess '99, Walsh, and Dunning batted
two for three withDunning recording
an aggressive double and two RBIs.
They had a super performance from
rookie Nette Wittgert '97 both in
right field and at the plate. Bad calls
all around from the guy dressed in
blue wearing thick glasses that someone called umpire once. Coach Cheri
Goetchus was heard "I got the number forPearle Vision, fella!" from the
bench more than once.
The Garnetalso experienced some
potential excitement as Dickinson's

catcher-with-an-attitude contemplated storming the mound after being too slow to get out of the way of
an inside pitch gone awry. Walsh's
response was, "Don't worry, Dana, I
won't let her get close enough to be a
problem." Despite a dental mishap
and adeathly ill captain, Swarthmore
came away with renewed hopes for
stronger bats and errorless defense in
the future.
Unfortunately those hopes were
squashed when it snowed on Tuesday, the day of the Muhlenberg game.
Regardless, the game must be played,
and it will be made up Friday under
the lights at Muhlenberg. Assuming
the marsh will drain by tomorrow
afternoon, the Garnet will face the
Franklin & Marshall here at 1 p.m.
That's four games in 24 hours. It
should be sunny and warm, so come
out and watch Swat come into their
own in whatlooks to be agreat matchup.

Women's Tennis Update
By Hilary

Gehlbach

The women's tennis team had a
mixed week as of press time, having
defeating Bryn Mawr solidly on
Monday, and then losing to
Gettysburg on Wednesday. With two
more matches on Thursday and Saturday, however, the Garnet tide anxiously anticipates the opportunity for
more wins.
The match against Bryn Mawr
brought few challenges, as
Swarthmore brought their neighbors
down 8-1. At first doubles, the duo of
Hilary Gehlbach '96 and Michelle
Martinez '97 won decisively 8-4,
while Elena Rosenbaum '9B and Nga
Lai '97 defeated their opponents 8-5
at third doubles. In singles, all six
Swarthmore women won in straight
sets. Martinez and Gehlbach won at
#1 and #2singles, respectively, while
Rani Shankar '9B and Neena Shenai
'9B took their opponents down at the
next two singles spots. At #5 singles,
Lai won 7-6 (6-3), 6-3; Rosenbaum
beat her Mawrter 6-1, 6-4 at sixth
singles.

Wednesday's journey to the battlefields of Gettysburg, by contrast, resulted in significant casualties for the
Garnet. With unpredictable Mother
Nature taking the upper hand, the
umpire decided to move the match
indoors, giving the home team a distinct advantage over the Garnet with
their superior experience on the fast
indoor surface.
Commenting on the unfortunate
surface after the team's 8-1 loss,
Shankar explained, "It's like playing
ice hockey, except you're using
racquets." Rosenbaum similarly remarked, "It would have been easier
to play on peanut butter."While most
Garnet players fell quickly to their
opponents with balls whizzing by
them, Neena "Animal"Shenai proved
her determination by pulling out the
lone win of the day at #4 singles.
Shenai battled in three sets, finally
bringing her opponent down in a gruelling third set tiebreaker, with a final
score of 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(10-8).
The Garnet faced Trenton State
yesterday and will play Dickinson at
home on Saturday at 1 p.m.
