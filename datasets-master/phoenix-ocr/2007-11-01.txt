Campus Camp Wellstone teaches activism tactics
BY MELISSA CRUZ

mcruzl@swarthmore.edu

This past weekend, 45 Swarthmore students participated in the Campus Camp
Wellstone training and leadership development program for progressive politicalactivism. Started in 2002, this nonprofit
grassroots campaign was constructed in
honor of Senator Paul Wellstone andvhis
wife, Sheila, who were killed in a plane
crash on Oct. 22,2002.
During his time in office, Senator
Wellstone won important victories in the
areas of environmental preservation, health
care reform, economic security and children's issues. He developed a widespread
reputation for his work with veterans as
well as mental health advocates and was
regarded as one of the most effective members of Congress. His wife, Sheila, in addition to being active in her husband's campaign, was actively involved in work around
domestic violence, and promoted raising
awareness of international human rights
abuses, namely the sex trafficking of young
women and girls in the US.
The one-and-a-half day Campus Camp
Wellstone training program was party-neutral and welcomed both experienced
activists and newcomers to progressive
activism. According to the program's Web
site, the focus of the curriculum was on very
concrete skills, like campaign planning,
coalition building and message development. In addition, it provided students with
hands-on teaching experience ofhow to successfully recruit and retain volunteers, as
well as how to develop new leadership patterns. Each workshop or session was led by
young trainers, including Swarthmore alum

Mattie Weiss 'Ol Some of the lessons that
were taught in sessions included how to
develop an effective message, work with the
media, motivate and mobilize people for
action and build inclusive coalitions.
Ruth Schultz 'O9, responsible for arranging for CCW to come to the college, described
the trainers as being "very dynamic and
energetic," and also went on to describe the
ambiance of the sessions. "In the beginning,
the trainers asked everyone what makes
them angry or passionate. It was very interesting to hear peoples' answers because,
even though their interests were different,
everyone had similar values," Schultz said.

She described the format of the typical session as consisting of an informational lecture, followed by discussion time and finally
action. "In the session on effective messaging, we actually got to break into groups and
had to create an actual message for a campaign, based on a fake case-study," Schultz
said.
Molly Weston 10, a participant in the
event, commented on the importance of
these workshops and how they play into the
bigger picture of socio-political change. "It
was a tremendous experience to be able to
witness and be a part of the movement from
the great idea
of creating a plan for
reform—to the actual change," Weston said.
Weston also described a technique she
learned called the "message box," in which
one learns how to anticipate and respond to
those who oppose you. The technique
includes listing your own views, as well as
what your counterpart's views are, followed
by reasoning, in a very orderly and clean-cut
manner. "It's important to acknowledge
groups who disagree with you and who have
the power to make decisions," Weston said.

Eric Loui Phoenix Staff

A trainer in Campus Camp Wellstone shows a student positive activism techniques.
"When trying to persuade a decision-maker
and be persuasive and effective you need to
know why it's going to matter to [the audience]. Knowing the audience is highly
important in [the process of] persuasion,"

she added.
Sarah Ifft 'O9, another CCW participant
this weekend, reiterated the need for this
sort of training, specifically for students at
Swarthmore. "On campus, there's a lot of
discussion about the need for change, but
very little effective planning or action," Ifft
said. "This program provided students with
just this opportunity to grasp how to make
those changes."
Campus Camp Wellstone claims to have
held 54 camp in 29 states, with over 9,324 peo-

ple trainedand 35 graduates elected to office.
"This is a very unique opportunity," Schultz
said, who anticipated the possibility of program returning to Swarthmore in two or

three years if students take the proper initiative.
Weston said the program was a powerful
experience. "It's a lot of information and
skill-building in a short time, f was amazed
that Ruth actually created most of the curriculum herself, but she won't tell you that."
This year's CCW training at Swat was
funded by the Lang Center, the President's
Office, the Swarthmore Foundation, the
Peace and Conflict studies program and the
Democracy Project, which deals with civic
engagement.

College passes sustainability test but not with flying colors
BY ROSA KIM
rkiml@swarthmore.edu

Earlier this month the Sustainable Endowments
Institute released its assessments of the environmental sustainability and endowment practices of 200 colleges and universities with the largest endowments in the United States
and Canada. Swarthmore's overall grade was a B minus.
The Sustainable Endowments Institute, a nonprofit
organization, aims to advance environmental sustainability
and endowment operations in institutions of higher learn-

ing.
According to Ella Cho, a public relations officer representing the Institute, this is the only independent assessment ofhow the 200 wealthiest U.S. and Canadian universities conduct themselves in the areas of campus and endowment sustainability.
Schools were reviewed in eight areas: administration
initiatives, climate change and energy, food and recycling,
green building projects, transportation, endowment transparency, investment priorities and shareholder engagement. The overall average grade for the institutions
reviewed was a C plus. Schools collectively did the best in
the area offood and recycling and the worst in endowment
transparency. Six schools were recognized as leaders ofcollege sustainability in the most recent report. Carleton
College, Dartmouth College, Harvard University,
Middlebury College, University of Vermont and University
of Washington received an overall grade of an A minus.
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l said that while the
college continues to work towards improving its sustainability independent of this kind of evaluation, these findings can serve as resource tools for informing the campus
community of how other schools are working towards the
same goal. In addition to launching the Greening of
Swarthmore Web site, a planning committee was recently
established to focus on setting both short and long term
goals to improve the college's sustainability practices.

THE PHOENIX

"We are taking the matter seriously, paying attention
and planning so that ultimately we can approach our solutions systematically and be at the same time responsive to
concerts and discoveries made by Earthlust and others
here," Eldridge said in an e-mail.
Mark Orlowski, Executive Director of the Sustainable
Endowments Institute said the reports are meant to spark
discussion and indicate areas where nationally recognized
schools are taking positives steps in the right direction, and
to encourage schools to make improvements in other areas.
"The grades serve as a guide to say which schools are in the
leading edge," Orlowski said.

"I would say that we have good
things happening but we lack the
overall direction that the schools
that received the higher grades from
this report have."
Ethan Deyle 'OB
...

...

Orlowski said that while

Swarthmore's

sustainability

grade did not improve from last year's assessment, it is
worthwhile to note that it did not drop. He said the institute
did recognize the college's progress, but that it was not substantial enough to merit a grade improvement.
Ethan Deyle 'OB, a member of Earthlust, said that while
various sustainability projects have moved the college in
the right direction, Swarthmore lacks an institutionalized
commitment to generate a long-term sustainability plan. "I
think there's been some really good movement in the past
couple of years. But I think it's allbeen kind of piecemeal...
in general, there's sort of a lack of cohesiveness, without

November X 2007

this broader vision that a lot of other liberal arts schools
have now," Deyle said. "I would say that we have good
things happening ... but we lack the overall direction or the
overall drive that the schools that received the higher
grades from this report have."
Claudia Seixas 'lO, a member of the Good Food Project, a
campus sustainability group with a focus in the areas of
food and food waste, said that the college has made improvements in food sustainability over the past year, with the
GoodFood Sharpies take-overs featuring local food products
and the project's organic garden. However, there is still
much work to be done.
"I think we did a lot better than even last year because of
Dining Services making a definite commitment to purchasing local foods. If there's an option that is economically
viable within the Dining Services' budget, they'll opt for
local items," Seixas said. "So it's a more of a conscious decision than I think it might have been in the past. But there's
also a lot more we could do." Seixas said while Good Food
will continue to do take-overs with a completely local menu,
major institutionalized changes need to be made to do that
on a daily basis.
According to Jamie Hansen-Lewis, a member of Good
Food, the percentage of locally grown food is still relatively
small, though Sharpies features more local products now
than in the past. "It's really a potent way to start practicing
sustainability because you can make changes like buying
food that's closer to you and it makes a big difference,"
Hansen-Lewis said.
Hansen-Lewis said student feedback to Sharpies carries
weight in its purchasing decisions. "I think giving [feedback] to Sharpies when we do take-overs and when they feature local food dishes
it's really important to them. If
they're going out of their way to provide something and
they don't see students reacting to it, then they don't consider it particularly successful," she said.

Class Awareness Month kicks off
BY KAITLIN KYI
kkyil@swarthmore.edu

An opening panel of students and alumni
will kick off Class Awareness Month today.
This year's Class Awareness Month has been
in its planning stages since last semester,
though much of the planning was led by organizers this fall.
Class Awareness Month will have 10 events

in all, spanning the month of November.
The theme of this year's Class Awareness
Month is "Social Class and Education,"
according to organizer Madeleine Case 'O9.
"All of our events are trying to revolve
around class and academics," Case said.
The opening panel will feature two alumni,
Roer Hawrylac '77 and Valeria Jokisch 'Ol,
who will discuss their own experiences of
dealing with social class issues while they
were attending the college.

"I really hope [the Month]
improves dialogue on campus
about the class divides our
society creates. I really want to
bring awareness."
Kate Aizpuru 'ID

"This year it's going to be really interesting
because we're having two alumni talk about

social class at Swarthmore when they were
here," Case said. "It'll be a historical look at

how social class factors into academics over
the years. That'll be a highlight."
The panel, which is sponsored by the Class
Activists, the Inter cultural Center, the Lang
Center and the linguistics department, will
also include current students, Susannah Gund

Other events, in addition to the opening
panel, include a spoken word performance and
a movie screening of "Educating Rita," a film
about a working class woman striving to fin-

"We're also having a speaker coming to talk
about working class students adjusting to academic culture," Case said.
The lecture will feature speaker Robert
Granfield, professor of sociology at University
of Buffalo.
Ruth Schultz 'O9 looks forward to attending
several of Class Awareness Month's events.
"With Swarthmore's Quaker values, everyone is supposed to be equal and have the same
access to opportunites, but that is not always
true," Schultz said.
Schultz also feels that class is something
that is important to be discussed in
Swarthmore. "Class is not something that can
be brushed over or ignored, and I am glad
there is a month dedicated to talking and
learning about how class plays out on
Swarthmore's campus and in the real world,"
Schultz said.
The opening panel for the month will be
held in the Scheuer Room today from 4:30 p.m.

Behrens worked
on developing the college's first
website in 1994 and was a project leader of Blackboard,

describing himself as a "spark
plug
in the adoption [of
Blackboard] on campus." He also
negotiated a significant contract
with Blackboard, which currently
treats and charges the Tri-College
community as a single institution.
Behrens emphasized that his
planning and leadership abilities
are evident in the intricacies
involved in the recent re-launching of the college Web site.

Behrens identified the issues of
communication, mobility and privacy as possible areas in which
ITS may face challenges in the
near future. Behrens would like to
see the college implement technology tools to improve the college
community's cohesiveness, but
also recognizes that technology is
a "rapidly evolving legal landscape," in terms of privacy and
security issues.
Questions posed to Behrens
concerned his projection of ITS'
future in community communications and social networking.
Behrens said that he wanted to
make ITS' project progression

Registrar and search committee member Martin Warner said
that the position was posted and
advertised nationally, resulting in
over 100 applications for the position.

before choosing the two final candidates. "We have been working

According to Warner, "fabulous leadership, excellent communication and keen awareness of

McCabe Foundation presents Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist
BY MARIA KHIM AND MATT BLEIMAN
mkhiml@swarthmore.edu and
mbleimal@swarthmore. edu
Nobel Laureate for Physics John Mather '6B visited campus last Thursday, Oct. 25 to address the student body in the
McCabe lecture titled "From the Big Bang to the Nobel Prize
and on to James Webb Space Telescope." In his lecture,
Mather explained the history of the universe, discussed past
accomplishments and shared some information about his
current projects. Mather made his presentation in Science
Center 101, which was packed, with people standing in the
back, sitting on the window sills and crowding the aisles.
After an introduction by McCabe scholar Aaron
Schwartz 'O9, John Mather took the floor. Mather's research
strongly supports the Big Bang Theory in observing the
presence of cosmic microwave background radiation and
provides the strongest evidence supporting an initial, massive explosion, that he referred to as 'la horrendous space
kablooie," to speak in Calvin and Hobbes terms. Throughout
the lecture, Mather not only made an effort to explain the
multiple concepts in much simpler terms, but also was very
accessible to the audience, as students who attended the lecture noted.
"I went because I wanted to meet someone who was really passionate about his work to the point that he would dedicate his whole career towards a single scientific discovery,"
Dan Yoon 'OB said. "It was very interesting and he tried to
explain the complicated concepts such that a general audience could understand."
He began with a brief background of his life and then
started off a discussion of the universe by telling the audience that their chins used to be stars. With this introduction,
he started explaining the beginning of the universe. Mather
discussed the subject with scientific terminology, but
explained his statements thoroughly. He progressed through
the history of modern astronomy and then began talking
about his own work.

"At one point, I just talked to
him about if all astrophysicists
wanted to be astronauts and he
told me no; but they all probaby
wished to go to Mars someday."
Aaron Schwartz 'O9
Mather worked as a Project Scientist for NASA's Cosmic
Background Explorer satellite. He specifically described his
research on the cosmic background radiation that won him
the Nobel Prize.
Currently, as the project scientist for the James Webb
Space Telescope, Mather is leading a team of scientists at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to build a telescope to
replace the Hubble telescope. It is planned to launch in 2013.

After the lecture, Mather took questions. He answered questions about his work, his guesses about the universe's
unknowns and about his Swarthmore experience.
Jonathan Jaquette 11 was impressed by Mather's lecture. "John Mather seemed really humble for all the awards
he won," he said. "He was a good, engaging lecturer and
whathe said fit right in to what I have been learning in class

and expanded it further."
Prior to the lecture, Mather joined the McCabe student
scholars for dinner in the Scheuer room in Kohlberg. They
were also joined by various faculty members including
President Al Bloom and professors from the astronomy and
physics department such as Michael Brown and Professor
Eric Jensen. Several alumni McCabe scholars were also
present.

...not only was he entertaining and
knowledgeable, but he explained it
in a way that everyone could
understand. You didn't have to be a
physicist to understand."

"

John Boucard 'ID
"Professor Michael Brown introduced me to John
Mather before the lecture and I asked him if he would sign
the poster of him with the inscription 'Dear Xiaoxia, In my
heart you're the next Nobel Prize winner,' and he did,"
McCabe scholar Xiaoxia Zhuang 'lO said.
Aaron Schwartz 'O9, another McCabe scholar who
attended the dinner, commented on his encounter with the
Nobel Laureate. "I was really intimidated meeting the guy
and did a lot of research
about him beforehand. Just
realizing the incredible
importance of his discoveries was somewhat intimidating but he couldn't have

no; but they all probably wished that they could go to Mars
someday," Schwartz said.
John Boucard 10, also a McCabe scholar, was very
impressed with not only the work that Mather discussed
during the lecture but his approachability and effort to
explain the complicated theories in simple terms for the
greater audience. "I didn't really know the magnitude of
who he was and the work that he had done. I really liked the
lecture because not only was he entertaining and knowledgeable but he explained it in a way that everyone could
understand. You didn't have to be a physicist to understand.

country of their choice, has garnered special interest this year on the Swarthmore
campus, both in terms of a number of
increased applicants from the college and

the activities of Fulbright
abroad.

Scholars

One recent Fulbright Scholar, Emily

Robbins 'O7 is currently abroad in Syria.
Robbins' time in the Middle East recently
included a visit to the Nahar al-Bared
refugee camp in Lebanon, which has been
the site of combat between the Lebanese
Army and the radical group Fatah alIslam.
According to Fellowships and Prizes
Advisor Melissa Mandos, last year the
college saw approximately 24 applicants
for the scholarship while this year that
number has risen to 43 applicants.

"[Robbins] was very
interested in the larger
social implications of the
gendered world in the
Middle East."

On average, around eight students
the scholarship each year,
although Swarthmore has had as many as
11 winners in one year.
The Fulbright Web site specifies that
the award gives recipients grants to fund
study, conduct independent research or
perform teaching assistantships for a full
academic year in 140 countries around the
world. "Another emphasis of the
Fulbright is the international fellowship.
You are not going over only to do
receive

research, but to act as an ambassador for
the U. 5.," Mandos said.
Robbins' interest in the Middle East
grew out of tragedy. In 2003 her cousin
Rachel Corrie was in the Gaza Strip acting as a peaceful protestor against the
Israeli occupation when she was run over
and killed by an Israeli bulldozer.
Corrie had been trying to prevent the
demolition of a house by standing in front

"The incident threw my family into the
conflict between Israel and Palestine.
That was also when I started college, and
I decided someone in the family needed to
learn Arabic," Robbins said.
Fortunately for Robbins, Swarthmore
began sending students to the University
of Damascus in Syria for semester-long
intensive Arabic language instruction
while she was at Swarthmore, and during
her junior year, Robbins took advantage
of the opportunity to study in Syria. She
thenreceived a grant from Swarthmore to
return to Syria for the summer to continue the thesis research that she had

already begun.
Robbins' passion for the Middle East
was apparent to many around her. "I
knew her in a capacity as a student and as
someone who had a really profound and
enduring interest in Syria and Lebanon
in particular. She was very interested in
the larger social implications of the gendered world in the Middle East," religion
professor Tariq al-Jamil said.
Robbins is living in Damascus once
again this year. In addition to continuing
her study in Arabic, she is also interning

with the United Nations Relief and Works

Agency and working with a women's
rights magazine.
One of the focal points of
experience in Damascus thus far, however, falls outside of these activities.

Robbins, Fatah al-lslam was defeated in

Robbins said that the camp has been

"Because it was U.S. money that was

needs to check up and follow up on the

"I'm not sure how much money [the]
US gives to Lebanon, but UNRWA has
made pleas to rebuild, and the U.S. has
only given $5.5 million dollars for the
rebuilding of the camp, and apparently it
was very hard for them to give up this
money," Robbins said. "When you think
of a camp of 40,000-45,000 people, that
money does not go that far."
As the Fulbright Scholarship was key
to enabling Robbins' unique experiences,
the increased number of Fulbright applicants comes as an indication of the hopes
of many other students to have similar

opportunities.

Third bi-annual trip to Ghana scheduled for January
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MATT BLEI MAN

mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

This winter, the Black Cultural Center
will lead its third bi-annual trip to Ghana.
The 10-day trip is open to faculty, students
and alumni from the Tri-College community and will take place this January.
The Ghana trip has evolved since students first made the journey in 2002. "The
original purpose of the trip was to give
black students an opportunity to go to
Africa
students who wouldn't otherwise go
as a way to introduce them to a
place that is associated with their identity," said BCC Director and Assistant Dean
Timothy Sams.
This year, however, the trip was open
to all interested students.
Sams explained that while the main
aim of the trip remains true to the original goal, the BCC wanted to give other
students, who are interested in doing
social justice work in Africa, a chance to
go.

Opening the trip to all students has led
to an increase in the number of applicants. With 31 people attending, the trip
this year will be the biggest yet.
The travel group is composed of eight
Swarthmore students, seven Haverford
students, six Bryn Mawr students, one
chaperone from each school, and six other
people affiliated with the consortium and

Sams.
Due to significant interest, the BCC
had to select travelers from an applicant

pool. Having already picked students, the

trip coordinators have had to manage all
of the travel plans. The BCC has arranged
for student travelers to return to
Swarthmore in early January, when the
dorms are officially closed.
In addition to passports, the travelers

need visas as well as immunizations. The
coordinators will spend the time from
now until the departure date making sure
everyone is prepared and has everything
they need before the trip.
For trip coordinator Stephanie Appiah
'lO, the trip is a return to her home country.

"I was inspired to go to Ghana to work
on the service component of this trip, to
work with friends on going to a beautiful
country, to reconnect to my people and to
add my Swarthmore experience to how
people in Ghana are living their lives,"
she explained.
The trip will be a new experience for
Sherri Lee 'lO.
"I am really excited to go on this trip
because I have never left the continent of
North America before. I have always
wanted to travel abroad and this is the
perfect opportunity," Lee said. "I think
it's important for me personally and educationally to get more of an international
perspective, to see another society firsthand instead of just getting information
through books or hearing from other people."
Lee has a second reason for going to
Ghana. As a member of the Global Health
Forum, she has been actively involved in
the campaign against the malaria epidem-

ic. Because the disease is prevalent in
Africa, Lee hopes to see the continent
firsthand to get a better understanding of
the conditions that affect population
health there.
While in Ghana, the travelers will visit
culturally significant locations in the
southern half of the country. These sites
include the Enslaved Castles and the
African American museum. The castles
were historically used as dungeons to
hold Africans before they were shipped to
the Americas as slaves, and the African
American museum was built by a
Philadelphia-based group which bought
the land that had once been used to hold
and chain slaves.

"I have always wanted to
travel abroad and this is
the perfect opportunity to
get more of an
international perspective."
Sherri Lee 'lO
...

Another highlight of the trip is a visit
to the Kente weaving villages, where
Ashanti Kente, one of the most historically and culturally significant cloths in
Africa, is made. They will also visit an
Ashanti castle and other historical landmarks.

The trip also includes several
Swarthmore-related stops. The attendees
will go to NOYAM, a Contemporary
African Dance Research Project. The
director of the project, Professor Nii
Yartey, was a visiting professor of dance
at Swarthmore last year. Sams hopes to
explore the possibility of working with
NOYAM to create a K-12 dance school as a
project involving Swarthmore students.
He hopes that if students see the needs of
young Ghanaian children, they will take
action.
While the project's logistics are still
being discussed, Sams hopes the school
will be successful, possibly even leading
to a summer program there.
One of the other stops in Ghana is
Ashesi University College, located in
Accra. The university was founded by
Patrick Awuah 'BB.
After graduation, Awuah worked for
Microsoft and then received an MBA from
Haas School of Business at the University
of California, Berkeley.
Ashesi University College opened in
2002 and maintains close ties with
Swarthmore. While there has been no formal contact between Awuah and the BCC
for this trip, travelers will visit the school
to see the fruits of Awuah's labor.
Overall, the goal of the trip is to give
students an inside view of Ghana. Sams
hopes that it will encourage more students to study abroad in Africa. "The trip
will be educative and we hope [the students] will see a place for themselves and
a place to do good work," Sams said.

Career Services launches week about public sector
Public Service Careers Week exposes students to different opportunities in non-profits
BY MARY PRAGER

mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

For students who are unsure of where

they are headed in life or students who are
already interested in a career in public
service, Career Services will be hosting

Public Service Careers Week for the third
year in a row from Nov. 5 to Nov. 8.
According to the official pamphlet, "Public
service work is work that matters, has
impact on others, addresses issues of public concern and is motivated more by mission than by money."

"We've seen a lot of students become
aware of opportunities and take advantage
of spring opportunities," Deitch said, noting that the purpose of the week is not to
connect students to potential internships.
That, Deitch says, takes place more
often in the spring, when students can
attend career fairs, which are useful for
obtaining internships in the non-profit sector.

Tiedemann said. "The idea that you're
never going to make money, financial insecurity, things like that
that it might be a
career dead end," he said.
The Public Service Career Initiatives
Committee, which includes students and
faculty, worked with Marissa Deitch on
planning for the week. "We discussed what
students would potentially be interested in
hearing or participating in, so out of that
we decided whom we wanted to get in
touch with," said Marissa Davis 'OB, a
career peer advisor and one of five students nominated to be on the committee.
Her interest in public service runs deep,
having had significant experience serving
others in New Orleans.
Davis is in charge of a visual exhibit
that will be showcased in Shane Lounge
starting Monday. "Here you have a week

full of people who've graduated from
Swarthmore or other places, who've finished their undergrad time and now have
actual careers," she said.
In planning the exhibit, Davis and other
members of the committee considered how
to bring public service to a more tangible
and real level of understanding of public
service for current students.
The exhibit will feature photos by five
or six students who participated in some
form of public service work over the summer, as well as a brief description of what
they did.
"The general idea (of public service) is
to help a couple folks or a community, but
people definitely, out of this week, should
understand that public service is far more

As a result of its focus on providing
information, Public Service Careers Week
is relevant for students of all classes, not
just graduating seniors.

From SUSTAINABIILITY, p. 3
Good Food recently received a
Swarthmore Foundation Grant to start a
compost pile on campus. Hansen-Lewis said
food waste has the potential to be turned into
soil to grow more food and can be used
repeatedly. She said it's important for the
campus community to be mindful of its
waste and to think about where that waste
goes and for what it could be used. Right
now, Deyle said the campus' waste is sent to
a bio-waste trash plant in Chester where the
county community's air and water quality is
greatly affected. Earthlust is working with a
group called Environmental Justice, a U.S.

Environmental Protection Agency to take
steps to ensure that the Chester community
doesn't bear the burden of other communities' wastes.
Hansen-Lewis said making more environmentally conscious decisions is not
something that we are at liberty to put off
and is something that needs both the college's and other communities' immediate
attention. "I think this is stuffthat needs to
get done now," Hansen-Lewis said. "I think
sustainability in general should be a huge
priority for Swarthmore. I think it's also in
a way a livelihood of the school and the
human race." Eldridge said that although
sustainability is a priority for Swarthmore,

it is still working on defining what sustainability means to the campus community, in
order to fulfill its goals within that definition. "I think we need a common, campus
community-wide understanding of what we
mean by it and I don't think we are there
yet," he said.
Deyle said that as an institution that values ethical intelligence and the knowledge of
the scientific community, it is critical to not
only say the college supports sustainability,

but to make long-term changes to make
Swarthmore a more sustainable place.
"From a more practical aspect, I think that
right now Swarthmore is falling behind. If
the school wants to continue to be competitive as a place to draw young bright minds,
we're going to have to show prospective students that we are a school and institution
dedicated to sustainability," Deyle said.
"I also think that college campuses have

the position to lead America and the rest of
the world in the reforms that are absolutely
critical. At a place like Swarthmore with as
big an endowment as we have, with as many
energized and bright people, both faculty,
students and staff if we can't get it together
to take responsibility for our carbon input,
our waste generation, then how are we going
to expect the industrial corporations or private homes to do the same thing?" Deyle
said.

Halloween party results in medical emergency, police involvement
BY JACK KEEFE AND KAITLIN KYI
jkeefel@swarthmore.edu and kkyil@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore borough police responded to a medical

emergency at the SAC-funded

Halloween party

in

Clothier Hall during the early morning hours on Sunday.
A male student fell down a flight of stairs in Tarble and
had been reported as unconscious. The Swarthmore
Police arrived at Clothier Hall at 12:20 a.m. and the student was promptly transported to Crozer-Chester Medical
Center by an ambulance. The college, police and party
associates worked in conjunction in response to the incident, which resulted in a citation. No other students were
cited.
Public Safety was notified soon after the accident happened and acted right away. "We immediately summoned
an ambulance," Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave
said. "[Public Safety] officers responded directly to the
scene. Shortly thereafter, the ambulance arrived and the
Swarthmore police arrived, as custom, after the ambulance arrived." Public Safety also cordoned off the area of
the accident until traces of blood could be cleaned up. The
usual number of Public Safety officers were present at the
time of the accident, and no additional officers were
called in.
Swarthmore Borough Police Chief Brian Craig said
that when the dispatched police officer arrived at the
scene he found the male student to be semi-conscious,
after some difficulty locating the injured student within
Clothier Hall. The student had a laceration on his chin.
"I have a few scrapes and bruises, and I have a cut on
my chin," the student said a few days after the incident.
He said that he fell unconscious as a result of the accident
and later awoke in the hospital.
Organizers and on-duty party associates quickly
attended to the situation that arose as a result of the accident. "Me and [SAC Co-Chair Kim Watson 'o9] asked the
PAs to keep everyone in Upper Tarble and everyone in
Paces so that nobody was outside and so nobody would
disturb the kid that fell
to my knowledge, [the situation] went fine," said Anna Mello 'OB, Social Affairs
Committee Co-Chair.
Reports from partygoers indicated that the PAs
worked to keep a perimeter around the injured student
before and after paramedics arrived on the scene, and
that they worked to both clear the Tarble hallway to facilitate safe transport of the students, and to direct partygoers away from areas where police might have been present or investigating. "We wanted the students to be aware
that there were authorities who could detain them if they

had reason to, so they should be careful... [the police are]
not within the college's power," attending PA Cathy Ng
'lO said.
Craig was unable to release the police report to The
Phoenix, due to the pending investigation of the incident,
but said that the injured student will be cited for underage drinking. "[He] had a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his person," Craig said. The police report of the
incident will be sent to Delaware County District
Attorney, and the student will later receive a summons,
which will determine the severity of the citation.
"[The student] will be given an option to
do 32 hours
of community service and do some counseling, and when
the time is up [the citation] changed to 'disorderly conduct,'" Craig said.
In spite of rumors that police officers were patrolling
the campus after the incident occurred, only the one dispatched officer was present on campus for the rest of the
Halloween party, according to Craig. "We only had one
officer there," Craig said. "He maintained a presence outside [of Clothier Hall]."
...

"The students at the college are
treated as residents of Swarthmore.
We treat them the same as
someone in town who would
be of the same age."
Brian Craig
Swarthmore Borough Police Chief
"The students at the college are treated as residents of
Swarthmore," Craig continued. "We treat them the same
as someone in town who would be of the same age."
Ng said that, to her knowledge, the police were not targeting any students. No other citations or arrests
occurred at the party. In comparison, no citations or
arrests were reported at the Halloween party last year,
also hosted in Upper Tarble, while at the Mary Lyonshosted party during the 2004-2005 school year, two students were arrested and charged with drug and alcoholrelated offenses and two students were picked up by borough police to be sent to either Taylor Hospital or Worth.
In Mello's eyes, the on-campus location of the party has

helped contribute to the increased safety of the party.
"[The party] was five feet away from my dorm, I didn't
have to catch a bus, I didn't have to get caught by police,"
Mello said. "It's safer to have it in Upper Tarble than to
have it in ML
ML's really tight, and [the party] probably destroys their breakfast room."
Both Mello and Ng, however, acknowledge the safety
issue of having potentially inebriated people walk up and
down the Tarble stairs. Noting that SAC has not yet discussed the party with the college administration, Mello
said, "It's one incident that night, and I don't think we're
going to extrapolate to a larger issue."
Watson addressed the issue as well. "It's really a pity
that Tarble has so many stairs and people might be intoxicated and fa11... but that's the only space here where we
can have the Halloween party," she said.
Additionally, both said that they would have preferred
a larger PA presence, though they reflected positively on
the work of the PAs on duty that night. "[The party] was
really hectic, because we were really short on workers.
It's the Halloween Party, so obviously it's going to be a
big, inebriated event. We were positioned [one PA] to each
entrance, but obviously that's not enough, because the
more manpower we have, the better," Ng said, adding
that she estimated there were about five PAs present at
any given time. Twelve PA slots were potentially open for
the event, with PA organizers attempting to increase PA
attendance to the event by offering pizza and "time-and-ahalf" pay for hours spent at the party. However, Watson
noted that the number of PAs shifted during the night
while the party was more understaffed at its inception,
SAC members served to handle security and crowd flow.
According to Ng, PAs attended a meeting prior to the
event to brief them on the specific rules of the party, at
which time a representative from Public Safety came to
give them an extra "heads up."
The college has long had a unique relationship with
the Swarthmore borough police, which continues to
evolve as time goes on. Craig described the relationship
as "excellent." The borough police and college representatives meet monthly to discuss incidents and to improve
interactions. The topic of the meeting varies from month
to month, depending on the events in the previous month.
Craig said the main topic of last month's meeting was
public safety on and around campus. The borough police
also try to interact with students in more positive ways

Students wore red shirts yesterday
to support the global movement to
denounce violence against women of
color. Though yesterday's series of
events included the litany reading and
an open meeting in the evening,
Women of Color has begun to raise
awareness about racism and violence
targeting women of color in particular.
The group hopes to provide an environment for women of color to share
their experiences and foster the contin-

ued discussion of such issues.
"I think it's really important for
everyone to condemn violence in all

forms, but I see violence against
women of color as [a particularly]

oppressive issue. It's important for
everyone to stand and support women
of color and as a woman, I support [this
campaign] because this is a women's
issue as well," said Susannah Gund 'OB.
This event was part of a larger international campaign, "Stop the Violence
Against Women of Color." For this campaign, people in various parts of the
world were encouraged to wear red and
participate in rallies as part of a large
scale international demonstration to
break the silence surrounding these

On the morning of the event, trifolds

with various statistics and additional
information about recent incidences of
violence. The trifold also listed information about the two other related events

that took place Wednesday evening, the
collective litany reading and Women of

At 5:45 p.m. yesterday, several students who volunteered to represent the
community of colored women and other
students present during the event were
invited to stand up where they were, at
various places in the Sharpies Dining

Hall, and read the litany together as a
collective event. The litany that was

Off-campus shuttle extends morning hours
BY RAMYA GOPAL
rgopall@swarthmore.edu

Students who live in off-campus dorms
may have the opportunity to sleep an extra
half hour two days a week due to the later
hours of the morning Tuesday/Thursday
shuttles to campus. The last shuttle will stop
running at 10 a.m. instead of the current 9:30
a.m. time to accommodate students who do
have class until 9:55 a.m. on Tuesdays and
Thursdays.

The new initiative was spearheaded by
student council and administered by student
van coordinator Samuel Garcia 'OB.
Furthermore, the move for longer hours is
the first administrative change to the program Since the initiation of the off-campus
dorm shuttles in 2000.
The expansion of the program has not yet
received financial approval from the
Student Budget Committee. Although the
drivers have been driving more since the
week before October break, Garcia has not
officially proposed the changes to SBC and
currently does not have the funding to pay
the student drivers for additional driving
time.

"My drivers are going to get
paid one way or the other."
Samuel Garcia 'OB
Student Council led the initiative to
respond to requests from students who left
comments in the Student Council suggestion
box. Previously, the Tuesday and Thursday
shuttles only ran from 7:45 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.,
making it difficult for students with 9:55 a.m.

classes to use the shuttles. Alyssa Work 'OB emailed Garcia asking if the change was possible. Within a few days, the change was executed.

"With the longer hours the
number of people waiting
for 9:30 has definitely
decreased."
Patrick Tiedemann 'OB
"I was surprised how quickly and easily
the change was made, and also surprised
that the issue hadn't been brought up before
this semester," Work said.
Lauren Mcßride 10 said she is happy
that she does not need to catch the 9:15 a.m.
shuttle anymore to reach her 9:55 a.m.
microeconomics class on time. Even Grace
Kaissal 10, a Strath Haven resident who has
class on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:20
a.m., said she finds the longer shuttle hours
"more helpful, especially when I need to get
to campus early."

The possibility of longer shuttle runs was
on the schedules of the shuttle
drivers and the funding to compensate them.
Luckily, both Patrick Tiedemann 'OB, the
Tuesday driver, and Vincent Choi 'OB, the
Thursday driver, were available for the
extra halfhour. More than just a convenient
change, the longer hours helped resolve the

contingent

problem of overcrowding in the morning
shuttles. "There was the problem of overcrowding for the 9:30 shuttle for students
who had a 9:55 class. With the longer hours,
the number of people waiting for 9:30 has
definitely decreased," Tiedemann said.

However at this point, the change to the
shuttle's hours of operation does not yet
have financial backing. The morning campus shuttle has budgeted $3,500.20 for this
year 'as an estimate for student hours,"
SBC Budget Manager Giannina Esquivel

'OB said. Garcia would need supplemental
funding of approximately $4OO for 23 weeks
for the full year. The $4OO would pay for two
more hours of pay rather than just one. "I
plan to pay them an hour for every extra
half an hour," Garcia said. Paying for an

extra half hour, "is the only way to find people to drive that early in the morning," he
said.
In the situation that the funding is not

approved, Garcia said "I will have SBC take
it out of my paycheck. My drivers are going
to get paid one way or the other." He plans
to submit a proposal to SBC this Sunday.
"We'll see what happens then," Garcia said.

Russian Club revived, reformed, revitalized
BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu

Throughout the years, Russian Club has not had a consistent presence on campus, but students are working to stabilize and reform the club to celebrate Russian culture and
language. Last week, the Russian Club organized a study
break to once again launch the club and spread awareness
about it across campus.
Lesley McNiesh 'OB, co-tsar of the Russian club with
Annie Burke 'OB, explained that at the beginning of this
semester Burke approached her with the idea of starting up
the club again. "[Burke] actually came up to me one day and
she was like 'I was reading Bowling Alone and thinking
about how our society's disintegrating and I'm not helping
anything and we're all going to die in lonely little pits of
despair, and I was thinking that maybe we should re-start
Russian Club.' And I was like, 'That's a great idea, let's do
that,'" McNiesh said.
The launch took place last Thursday and, as McNiesh
explained, was a way to present the club to the campus. "It's
a way to hang out with people who are also interested in
Russia, Russian culture and Russian literature," said
Alexander Frye 'll, a recent member who attended the
study break. He explained that there was a lot of food, music
and Scrabble-playing at the event, all things Russian, of
course. "It was really exciting actually," McNiesh said. "We
thought we had more food than anybody could possibly eat
and it was practically gone in the first half hour."
Burke reported that there was also a genuine interest in
the club's goal at the study break and that the study break
was not just a scramble for food. "They didn't just come and
eat the snacks. They asked things about it, and they wanted
to know what everything was and how you eat everything
and what Russian Club does. People were actually expressing interest in what was going on, and that was really cool
and kind of a beacon of hope for success in the future,"
Burke said.

THE PHOENIX

Part of the reason for the club's existence was to show

aspects of Russian culture of which people are not aware.
"My personal reason for wanting to do it is that I think that

Russian culture is really cooland really varied and has a lot
more depth and history than people realize; it's a lot more
than vodka and dancing bears," Burke said.

Russian culture is really cool and
really varied and has a lot more
depth and history than people

Annie Burke 'O9
"...

McNiesh also explained that the close proximity
between the students and their Russian professors contributed to creating a small community. "The department
is so small, and we love the professors so much that it
became a really important part of our lives here. We
wanted to sort of help other Russian students to have the
same experience," McNiesh said.
Another one of the club's goals, though the group is
open to all students and does not require any Russianspeaking abilities, is to provide beginning students with
help from more advanced students with their homework.
"We're going to try to help people with homework, and
set up opportunities to practice Russian," McNiesh said.
However, none of the meetings is conducted in Russian,
and all students are invited to partake in the club's meetings on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. in Kohlberg 228.
Furthermore, due to a lack of interested students,

there was no second year Russian class this year.

By

forming this group and hosting campus wide events, the
Russian club hopes to attract more students and also to
provide those who cannot continue studying Russian
with another way of keeping in touch with the language.
"It's mostly just supposed to be a fun thing, not too serious," McNiesh said.
Burke explained that her goal was to make this
Russian club more permanent and stable and not let it
disappear like the previous clubs. "We're trying to make
it a more lasting thing this time, by making it more official," Burke said. The club already has SAC funding but
is waiting to be chartered. "Ifwe're not chartered now, we
will be in the next few days," Burke said. Burke also
explained that another way the club is working on its
future stability is through closer interactions with the
Russian department.
The Russian club will try to host more campus-wide
events in the future, beginning with a Paces cafe takeover
and a Paces party, which, according to Burke, should take
place this semester.
To check future events hosted by the Russian club, it
is possible to access their public calendar on the Google
calendar application, by typing "Swarthmore College
Russian Club."
"We would love for anybody who's at all interested in
Russian culture or Russian history of anything to come to
our meetings," McNiesh said.
Burke said that currently the nine people who regularly attend the meetings are mostly people who are
involved in the Russian language part of the department.
She remains optimistic that more people will start attending in response to the rise in advertisement for the group.
The group is also working on t-shirts that can be preordered by e-mailing aburkel@swarthmore.edu. The tshirts will be red with white lettering and will have
Parrish on the back, with onions instead of domes and

with "Kremlin on the Crum" written on it. The shirts will

cost between $lO and $l5.

Bright side of 'Life'

BY NICK GAW

ngawl@swarthmore.edu

Side projects are strange things. There is a unique set of
stresses that plagues artists as they write music for multiple
acts. Paramount among those difficulties is finding that line
that separates the acts, necessitating the existence of the side
project. For many, the line is easily drawn between musical
genres. For Tim Kasher, the songwriter behind Cursive and
his side project, The Good Life, the line is trickier to pinpoint.

Cursive, Kasher's main effort, has a history of rocking a
bit harder than The Good Life, but in many places the lines
blur. The Good Life has long been seen as a vehicle for
Kasher to dump any material that refused to fit on a Cursive
album. But in 2004, with the release of The Good Life's third
full length, "Album of the Year," it became clear that The
Good Life wasn't kidding around. "Album of the Year" had a
great gimmick a song for each month of the year.
Each of the tracks was intensely narrative, dominated by
stories of broken relationships and alcohol. "Album of the
Year" also took the band in a very different direction away
from pseudo-electronica and towards a folk pop sound. It has
been three years and one Cursive record since that album,
and now, The Good Life has returned with a new record.
"Help Wanted Nights" is The Good Life's latest record.
This one, like the last, is a concept album. "Help Wanted
Nights" takes much of its material from a screenplay Kasher
wrote about a stranger in a small town who quickly finds
himself involved in the lives of local bar-goers.
The album is less personal and less narrative than "Album
of the Year." Kasher makes a deliberate attempt to leave
space for the listener's own experiences on the record. All of
these songs evoke familiar emotions and the true talent of
this album is in making any unfamiliar sentiments uniquely
personal to anyone who gives the record a spin.
As a whole, "Help Wanted Nights" moves a little quicker
than much of Kasher's work. Tracks like "Keely Aimee" and
"Playing Dumb" deftly truck the album through familiar pop
sounds. Sweeping guitars and drum brushes unite therecord
under an unassuming simplicity.

-

All of these songs evoke familiar
emotions and the true talent of this
album is in making any unfamiliar
sentiments uniquely personal to
anyone who gives the record a spin.
"Heartbroke," the album's first single, clocks in at just
under two minutes and is a prime example ofThe Good Life's
current direction. Within a few seconds, the band sets a mood

that can only be called "jaunty." Over the boogie, Kasher

laments about heartbreak and a guitar wails. As quickly as it
started, the song is over. This is some of the tidiest songwriting in Tim Kasher's career, and it works really well.

At nearly 11 minutes, the last track on the record comes
from a distinctly opposite logic. "Rest Your Head" takes a
while to get going, but around minute five, The Good Life
breaks out. The back half of this track really rocks. Then,
unexpected ambient synths wash out the band and return the
track to its minimalist beginnings.
As a big fan of "Album of the Year," I feel pushed to make
comparisons between that record and "Help Wanted Nights."
The Good Life has certainly changed direction a bit since
2004 and Kasher has certainly sharpened his songwriting.
Both records are great, but here on "Help Wanted Nights,"
The Good Life is focused more than ever before. There are
also parts of the record that call out to Kasher's last project,
Cursive's album "Happy Hollow"
notable religious
imagery, for one.
"Help Wanted Nights" is deliberate, a carefully constructed piece of work that stands alongside Kasher's best work.
Together with the band's past successes, "Help Wanted
Nights" is pushing The Good Life out of Cursive's shadow.
It's clear that from now on, this band is just a side project no

'Group' lights up the stage
BY SUNNY COWELL
scowelll@swarthmore.edu
Last Friday, Oct. 19, the David Parsons Dance
Company performed in the Pearson-Hall Theater in
the Lang Performing Ats Center. Sponsored by the
William J. Cooper Foundation and the Department of
Music and Dance, the performance highlighted the
work of the company under founder and artistic
director David Parsons.
Parsons Dance Company, which tours both
nationally and internationally, consists of 10 fulltime dancers hailing from all over the world. The
company is dedicated to building new audiences for
contemporary
dance through extraordinary
American works. Aside from the company's outstanding reputation for choreography and performance, Parsons Dance provides student performances,
lecture demonstrations, master classes, post-show
discussions and many other events to positively
impact children, students and communities.

[The piece] "Caught" featured a
solo dancer perfoming leaps
across the stage and impressive
choreography interspersed by
strobe lighting.
The show opened with "Closure", a piece commissioned by the Repertory Dance Theater in honor of
the State of Utah's centennial celebration. Originally
by Tony Powell, the music score featured fast-paced
synthesizer and organ sounds. Highlighted by spotlights, the dancers moved in circles and unified routines to the harmonious and occasionally dissonant
music. The piece ended with several blinding flashes
of light. The second piece, "Hand Dance," featured
five company members and a musical arrangement
by Kenji Bunch consisting of a piano and strings. On
the completely darkened stage, the dancer's hands
were the only thing visible to the audience and were
illuminated by front spotlights. Eliciting "oohs" and
"ahhs" and appreciative applause from the audience,
November % 2007

the dancers' hands replicated piano fingers as well as
other shapes and forms.
A much longer piece, "Nascimento Novo" concluded the first half of the performance. With music
by Brazilian composer Milton Nascimento, Parsons
Dance Vice President Stephen Morris commissioned
the piece in honor of his wife on her 60th birthday.
"Nascimento Novo" had several sections characterized by sunset yellow, orange, fuscia, dark blue and
green lighting with each color symbolizing a different concept. This exciting and innovative piece
ended with the dancers clapping and sitting on the
floor one by one.
In the last half of the performance, the dancers
dazzled the audience with "Kind of Blue," "Caught"
and "In The End".

Choreographed to "So What" by Miles Davis,
"Kind of Blue" was commissioned by the Umbria
Jazz Festival in Perugia," Italy where it premiered in
2001. This piece is a tribute to jazz great Miles Davis
and features music from "Kind of Blue", the best-selling jazz album of all time.
With music by Robert Fripp, "Caught" featured a
solo dancer performing leaps across the stage and

impressive choreography interspersed by strobe
lighting. The lighting gave the impression that the
dancer was walking through the air and leaping
without touching the ground.
Jessica Barajas 'lO said, "I was impressed by the
performance, especially the solo piece that gave the
illusion of the dancer flying through the air."
Finally, Parsons Dance performed the fast-paced
and high-energy piece, "In The End." With music by
the popular Dave Matthews Band, "In The End" consisted of solos, duets, small groups, lifts, jumps and
turns. This intense piece highlighted the virtuosity
and talents of all of the company's dancers.
Eva Amesse 'll, currently enrolled in the Modern
Dance II class and also a member of Rhythm 'N
Motion, said, "I was truly inspired by the energy of

the company members."
Amesse said she was glad that Swarthmore

invites such talented professionals to perform.
Erin Floyd 'lO said, "The performance was amazing. The dancers had so much energy; you could see
their passion for dance in every movement."
That was a sentiment that was echoed by the audience, which gave the dance group a standing ovation.

LSE Opening Act Hezekiah talks to The Phoenix about his childhood, inspirations and defying labels
I'm not always uplifted, I'm not always
down I'm everything. I could talk about
deep issues, but I could also talk about
strip clubs. A lot of people have problems
with me because they can't put me in a box
they say, "Is he street, is he conscious, is
he this, is he that?" I just want people to
know me, straight up and down. I grew up
in Chester, PA and then I moved to
Delaware so I experienced extremes of
both aspects of life to the fullest. Some kids
from the city might not relate to how I
view things or some kids from the suburbs
might not relate to how I view things and
so they have a problem with me and try to
put me in a box.

I got the chance to talk to Hezekiah, an

up, it can be a blessing in disguise if you
get the music out there and someone
comes to you and they tell you that they
have a similar experience. What I love
about making music is the therapeutic
process and the therapeutic outcome.
What do you want people to get out of
your music?
First of all, to get to know me. I'm not
always positive, I'm not always negative,

Musically too, it seems
not just lyrically. You mix a lot of genres together

could you tell me a little about your musical

influences?

Well, I grew up with my uncle, who had
a band when I was growing up so I was
always around my uncle and his band.
Musically, I was inspired by him and by
the way he went about his music. From
when I was 12, I had a lot of instruments,
even a digital keyboard. I still do today,
and my performances are half live and half
digital. A lot of people just started doing it,
but I've been doing it since I was 12. My
father from Kentucky influenced me too.
He listened to bluegrass and straight country. My mom focused on rock. I wasn't
raised on a lot of soul music like most people. I grew up on rock, funk and country

there's going to be a problem. It's going to

Or you could read it politically, like with the Gulf War

DIYA

WEEK

Deshi celebrates a week of cultural awareness
BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

Clare Kobas Phoenix Staff

On Tuesday, D.R.U.M. member Monami Maulik spoke on
the deportation of low-income South Asian immigrants.

Complete with movie screenings, lectures and a game
of cricket, Deshi's Diya Week is in full swing. For this
entire week, Deshi, Swarthmore's South Asian organization, has planned diverse and exciting events culminating
in a Diya Explosion party this Saturday night in Paces.
Diya Week's overall goal is to familiarize the
Swarthmore community with South Asian culture and
issues. According to Deshi co-president Parth Lakhani 10,
Deshi itself serves as a "safe space" for South Asian students to discuss and explore their differences. Lakhani
hopes that Diya Week will increase Deshi's visibility on
campus and bring the 'different voices" of Swarthmore's
South Asian students to light.
Earlier this week, Deshi brought Stalin K., the director
of"India Untouched: Stories of a People Apart," to discuss
his movie about India's "untouchables." Shaila Chhibba
'lO enjoyed the film because it presented a wide array of
perspectives on India's caste system. The director traveled to eight different regions in India and interviewed
people of all ages and walks of life. "Because each state's
cultural practices are different," Chhibba said, "It was
interesting to see that all still follow a caste system."
Deshi also screened two movies, "Dev" and
"Kandahar," both of which touched upon issues important to the South Asian community. In addition, Monami
Maulik from the New York-based social justice organization D.R.U.M spoke on Tuesday evening, detailing the
deportation of low-income South Asian immigrants without reason in the post 9/11 world. English professor
Bakirathi Mani held a talk followed by a workshop exploring "gender and sexuality in the South Asian diaspora."

If you missed out on the first half of the week's events,
there are still plenty more activities planned.
Today, Nov. 1: Come to Kohlberg 115 at 7 p.m. for Diya
Week's second movie screening, "Lage Raho Munna
Bhai." This film humorously follows one ex-gangster's
adoption of a Ghandian outlook on life to win over a girl.
Following the screening, let out your inner Bollywood
star and sing your favorite Hindi songs. Come to
Mephistos Lounge at 10 p.m. for karaoke. There will also
be Indian food and the chance to get a mehndi tattoo.
Mehndi is a traditional body art that uses henna paste to
create intricate designs on hands and feet.
Frida, Nov. 2: Do you long to engage in a tradition that
dates back to the 13th century? Or perhaps you crave to
know what exactly a "wicket-keeper" is. Either way, come
to Mertz Lawn at 2 p.m. for a rousing game of cricket.
Don't worry about having a total lack of skills, as everybody will be on the same amateur page!
A catered Indian dinner will be held in Upper Tarble
at 6 p.m. followed by Garba and Dandiya Raas. Garba is a
traditional circle dance where increasingly difficult patterns are repeated to music. As Chhibba explained, Garba
is usually associated with the lead up to the Hindu holiday, Diwali. This Garba, however, will have no religious
implications. Dandiya is an active dance involving sticks
and once represented a fight between a goddess and
demon king. "Dandiya is a very communal dance because
you end up dancing with everybody," Chhibba said.
Saturday, Nov. 3: Sofia Saiyed, Deshi co-president, is
very excited for Saturday's Paces party, closing up Diya
Week. The event will continue to celebrate South Asian
culture. The music, selected by WSRN's Bollywood
Badshahs and Humzah Soofi 10, will mix South Asianand
English selections.

us a complacent attitude may explain why
the issue has gone unnoticed. "In America,
if you're a white male, you wouldn't think
there's a problem," Stalin K. said.
Stalin's strategy is to give as much representation as possible to this untouched
and unheard group. Although Stalin interacts with his camera's subjects, he remains
unseen, allowing his film to adopt the voice
of the Dalits. "The fact that they are talking
...is their resistance, and I feel that it
needs to be legitimized," Stalin said. One
such voice is a Dalit woman, who was beaten and raped before a mob. She tells her
story, unabashedly crying, and then calmly says she will take revenge on the man
who raped her. Stalin said, "That's as powerful as someone saying I'm going to start
free elections."
Stalin feels his film doesn't have much
marketability, especially with Western
audiences. Stalin said television companies are much more interested in narrative-based documentaries that follow a single character. Instead, Stalin is mostly distributing his film himself, visiting various
universities in the U.S. and in India where
he has already sold over 500 copies. "The
academic institution is a big circuit,"
Stalin said. "NYU Law has already introduced this film as a course." The film is
also making its rounds in festivals, like the
Berlin International Film Festival.

"How come you are making a film on

question, but one that speaks volumes to
how obvious, yet unacknowledged the
problem of Untouchability remains in
today's India. On Sunday, Deshi,
Swarthmore's South Asian organization,
and Swarthmore's Amnesty International
Chapter invited activist filmmaker Stalin
K. to screen and talk about his latest documentary, "India Untouched." Stalin hopes
his film will increase awareness of the continuing
discrimination against the
Untouchables of the traditional Hindu
caste system, known today as Dalits.
"India Untouched" is vast in scope,
looking at how Untouchability has manifested itself in all different communities in
India, from Hindu to Muslim to Christian,
both impoverished and well-to-do. In every
one of its countless anecdotes, the film
makes a stinging case for the persistence of
Dalit persecution. We meet a Dalit mason
who is not allowed to step foot in the house
he has completed. Later, we meet a Dalit
physician, whose boss forces him to take
commands from a junior colleague. A wellpaid, educated Dalit, he says, "My existence is not being accepted both at the conscious and subconscious level."
Much of India seems unable to face this
reality. In the film, we see "Youth for
Equality" protests against reservation programs that give Untouchables positions in

government and academic institutions.

FANTASY FASHION
rather delightful walking companions.
Maintaining the idea of a caricatured take on reality,
last year United Colors of Benetton came out with a knitted chain-link scarf in conjunction withtheir 40th anniver-

sary celebration (Figure 3). The chain is wildly oversized

and comes in a selection of vivid colors. The utility of the
scarf is immediately called into question because a massive chain worn around the neck does not do much by way
of warding off the cold, even if it is composed of yarn. But
the visual result of wearing one of these scarves is quite
spectacular, effectively miniaturizing the wearer and giving her a sort of Jessica Rabbit-like animated presence in

'Shape' takes a new look at Adam and Eve
BY JOAN KIM
jkim3@swarthmore.edu

This weekend, the Drama Board will produce Neil
Laßute's seductive drama "The Shape of Things" in Olde
Club. The piece, directed by Sean Nesselrode 'O9, Tally
Sharma 'O9 and Melanie Spaulding 'O9, follows the transformation of college student Adam (Daniel Putnam '08)
as he ventures into the definitions of art and love.
Awkward and insecure, Adam meets and forms a relationship with a confident, commanding art student,
Evelyn (Jessie Bear 'O9), who is demanding of Adam and
asks him to make many changes to himself. He "undergoes a Frankenstein-esque transformation" Sharma said.
His engaged friends, Phillip (Dustin Trabert '10) and
Jenny (Isa St. Clair '11), react to Adam's changes as he
morphs under Evelyn's influence. The play "touches on
weighty issues such as love and art in a mundane setting," Nesselrode said. It explores "the blurry divide
between cruelty and aesthetics," Co-director Spaulding
added. The allusion to Adam and Eve may be a bit
stretched, but that is for audiences to determine.
The entire cast represents students of all class years
and different levels of experience. However, the chemistry between the directors and actors bodes well for the
production of the play.
Adam is "probably like a lot of Swarthmore students
awkward, sweet-spirited and not particularly world
experienced," Nesselrode said. According to Nesselrode,
Putnam has to play "in a sense, two characters the preEvelyn Adam and the post-Evelyn Adam. The biggest
challenge was to convey that transformation convincing-

-

ly."
Evelyn, on the other hand, is "appealing in a dark and
controllable type of way," Bear said. "There's always a
dark draw to a character that is in charge." Bear based

her interpretation of Evelyn off of someone she had met
in the past. One of the difficulties is that the character of
Evelyn is "such an opposite of the person that I am,"
Bear said. But, she said, she is accustomed to playing different types characters; her varied past roles are a testament to that.
Nesselrode, Sharma and Spaulding first discovered
this play when Spaulding saw the play at her high
school. She gave the script to Sharma to read, and
Sharma then sent it to Nesselrode. Sharma and
Spaulding had worked together previously in the Night
of Scenes production.

"[The play] touches on weighty
issues such as love and art in a
mundane setting."
Sean Nesselrode 'O9
Director
The play is especially appealing because of the college
setting and the ease with which the actors and the audience can relate to the characters' situations. According
to Bear, Laßute's skillfully written dialogue reflected
how college students actually speak. St. Clair found that
"the text gave a lot of room for interpretation" and since
her character was not "set in stone," she had the freedom
and flexibility to work around what the other actors
brought to the stage.
"The Shape of Things" will be showing in Olde Club
this Friday, Nov. 2 at 7 p.m., Saturday, Nov. 3 at 3 p.m.
and Sunday, Nov. 4 at 7 p.m.

Museums turn art into a stale commodity
RORY SYKES
Visually Stimulating
Leo Steinberg is a god. For those not in
attendance at his lecture last week, you
missed out on a public chastisement of all
pretenders in the field of art history and criticism for their frequent betrayal of the fundamental visual image in their devotion to
the text as authority. Notorious for his
championing of crazy close visual analysis
check out "Eve's Idle Hand" to
(seriously
see his fascination with detail taken to an
extreme), I've long admired Steinberg's ability to LOOK and genuinely SEE. With
renewed admiration, I decided that this
week's column would be an exercise in just
that kind of sustained and careful looking.
Secluding myself in a gallery to concentrate solely on the art seemed as if it would
work well with my mood. I was teetering on
the raspy edge of a sore throat which a ten
minute walk in the rain did nothing to help,
so I was more than happy to forgo making
merry with the masses. Instead, I made my
rain-drenched way past the music and tittering laughter and went deep into the complex
of galleries to engage in that other privilege
afforded by Friday's late hours private,
silent viewing amongst the works them-

answers. It differs from person to person and
work to work and by what exactly is meant
by 'absorb" and "beheld" but I guess what
I'm getting at is that going to an art museum
and gallery is ultimately a performance of
looking and a social display of consuming
these privileged visual cultural artifacts and
I do feel the pressure to distinguish myself
from the artistically dismissive plebes (and
oh how I hate myself as I see in print that
blatant confession of elitism). Yet even as
part of my insecurity stems from those
ingrained social prejudices and a desire for
myself to be seen as truly seeing, there is
another very legitimate reason to seriously
ask the question about duration: Steinberg's
crusade against superficial viewing. If we
are to follow his command to look closer and
deeper, we must consider the time we spend
physically viewing art as a factor in the
quality of our engagement.

I'm an ART HISTORY major

selves.

I wound up in the big Duchamp room,
due in no small part to the fact that it has a
bench. Comfortably seated, I scanned the
walls waiting for a work to emotionally grab
me. Well, there was a bride being stripped
bare, a woman descending and a urinal all
well-establishedand ample fodder for visual
mastication. But no, my eyes couldn't quite
stop. I kept looking, kept twisting about on
that large slab of wood, kept dismissing
works after about five seconds of consideration. The longer this went on, the more worried I got. I simply couldn't look at a single
piece long enough to get into it
each one
confronted me as a closed object, repelling
my vision which in turn left me with
absolutely no connection of any kind to the
things surrounding me. I'm an ART HISTORY major that couldn't find a SINGLE
THING to say about ANY of the Duchamp
works in front of me. Fuck.

[To] look closer and deeper,
we must consider the time
we spend physically viewing
art as a factor in the quality
of our engagement.
This brings me to a problem I have more
generally when viewing works in museums
and galleries: I feel like it's a competition as
to who gets the most out of the experience,
and even given the socially recognized
advantages of my educational background
and sheer time spent thinking about and discussing art, I'm still failing to prove myself
to the works. Just because I can (typically)
encase a visual work in verbiage, does that
mean I'm truly getting something out of it?
All too frequently, I enter the museum in a

state

of

self-consciousness about

how

intensely and productively I'm engaging the
art, and the measurement of such engagement tends to be tied with how long I stand
before a given work. Really now, what is the
required time in which to absorb a painting?
How long until I can properly say I beheld
the sculpture? Obviously, there are no clear

THE PHOENIX

As Steinberg demonstrated, there is a
clear trend of privileging text above image
that has resulted in impatience with visual
contemplation that leads to misperceived
vie wings. Given that some of his examples
predated the modern institutions for art, it
would be inaccurate to solely blame museums and galleries for spoiling my ability to
simply sit still and look. Still, I think there
is something very particular about how
these institutions are structured that contributes to and exacerbates that tendency to
glance briefly at the art and then go back to
some form of text for explanation or description of just what it was that you skimmed
over in under ten seconds. In a previous
paragraph I used the word
quite deliberately. Museums participate in
our capitalist system and are dependent on
as many people as possible purchasing an
experience of the wares they have to offer:
the more people walking in and out of their
doors, the better it is for them. In addition to
their permanent collections, museums are
also constantly putting on special exhibitions that typically come at an additional
cost to the regular entrance fee. In correspondence with these permanently and temporarily displayed works, museums are also
always equipped with both permanent gift
shops featuring a slew ofbooks that explicate the art just twenty feet away
and visiting exhibition gift shops, which again
always provide an exhibition catalog for
sale. So how does this relate to my conditioning as a fast-paced viewer?
First there is the hype surrounding special exhibitions. With a constant rotation of
temporary works, the viewing of art
becomes obsessed with newness, but framed
in the way of seeing an object that is new,
rather than seeing the same object in a new
way. Next we can consider all the text available for purchase as an encouraged substitute for the works themselves. If we're
already predisposed to read as a way to gain
knowledge, so long as we are still able to
legitimate our knowledge with the basic
claim that we did, in fact, pass in front of
that Duchamp work, it is still perfectly
acceptable for the ideas that we express
about that work to be derived from what we
read as opposed to what we "saw."

"Just because I can encase a visual work in verbiage,
does that mean I'm truly getting something out of it?"
Meghan Downie Phoenix Staff

Then there is the issue of the physical
space that the works (traditionally) reside
in. The art is presented as objects of display

in a honeycomb of rooms around which we
perambulate. Benches tend to be infrequent
and are almost always found in the center of
the room. This provides a great way to get a
sense of the works together, but is not so
great a way to sit and contemplate an individual work up close. Even operating under
the assumption that walking and standing is
feasible for the viewer without a large
degree of discomfort, it still remains a bit
unreasonable to expect that viewer to stand
in front of a work for longer than five minutes, maybe ten if you're dedicated (or feel
like you have something to prove). Not only
does it get uncomfortable, but because
everyone else is walking around and moving
from piece to piece, there is an established
flow that the still viewer interrupts.
Additionally, in order for you to stand
close enough to the work to get a good,
detailed view, you simultaneously obstruct
the ability of others to get that same privileged vantage point, which can be quite an
annoyance if you are one of the viewers just
trying to get a glimpse before moving on. It's
simply not in the interest of the museum to
structurally encourage its visitors to have
that sort of intimacy with the works and so
there has been developed a culture of selfregulating museumgoers who understand
the etiquette in taking up space and time in

the viewing of a work.
Lastly, there are the gallery guards.
While not there explicitly to time your viewing, their own watching and monitoring
does increase one's self-consciousness. Try
standing in front of a popular work for an

November X 2007

extended period of time under the gaze of a
guard, and I really do mean just standing,
not taking notes or discussing it with a
friend, but engaging with the work through
unmediatedlooking, and see if you don't feel
uncomfortable, or guilty, or pressured to

move on.
To go back to last Friday, I sat there and
simply couldn't look. I couldn't force myself
to take the time to visually read the hallowed works in front of me: I would skip
parts, fill in the blanks, get a sense of the
whole and move on. I would gut the painting, the ready-made, the giant glass object
and be done with it, not at all able to say a
significant thing about how those works
were impacting me, how I was experiencing

them.
With Leo Steinberg haunting my conscience and my frustration mounting, I realized that I was past the point of productivity
and that leaving might be for the best.
Sullenly stomping out of the room, I set off at
a rushed pace through the galleries when, in
an entirely cliched manner, something
caught my eye. It was a work by Antonio
Mancini of a young boy, back pressed
against the wall as he beholds a bloody white
shirt. There was something about that
depicted boy's intense expression in his own
act of viewing that genuinely caught me,
that made me want to look more not only at
him, but at the shirt, at the shadows, at the
sword visually slicing across his knees
it
was thrilling. But on that faint note of hope,
I realized I couldn't afford a longer look if I
wanted to make the next train and so, like
the other visitors around me, I kept walking.

Jazz Symposium pays tribute to Ellington

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ALEX ISRAEL
aisraell@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday, Oct. 27, the Music Department held a Jazz
Symposium in Lang Concert Hall. The symposium consisted of three parts: a performance by five student jazz
combos, two short lectures by Dan Perelstein 'O9 and
Director of the Jazz Ensemble Drew Shanefield and a
keynote address by Mercedes Ellington, granddaughter of
jazz legend Duke Ellington. Ellington's speech focused on
her grandfather's "Such Sweet Thunder" suite, a 12-part
piece inspired by the plays of William Shakespeare. The
symposium spanned three hours, during which time the
audience had the opportunity to learn a little about the history of jazz, as well as to hear some swingin' jazz music
performed by talented Swarthmore students.

The spoken-word really brought
Ellington's plans to life and added
a new and exciting dimension to an
already excellent piece- of music.
The first part of the program featured five student combos. The show opened with a rhythm section and tenor sax
combo (jokingly referred to by bassist Perelstein as the
"Hannah Epstein Jazz Experience," named after lead sax
player Epstein '10), which played "Broadway," a standard
from the Big Band Era. They were followed by the aforementioned piano-and-vocals duo, featuring Alicia Lemke
'O9 singing the Cole Porter tune "You'd Be So Nice to Come
Home To," a slow ballad that, given the two-person
arrangement, had a bit of a torch-singer feel. Ben
Rachbach 'll, Yaeir Heber 'll and Jacob Socolar 'll broke
the mold and played Rachbach's original composition "On
the Floe," in lieu of a standard. They were followed by
Anna Grant 'lO singing the Rodgers and Hart tune "My
Romance." The student combo section of the show ended
with a Dixieland version of"When the Saints Go Marching
In," a tune that injected a sense of messy, chaotic fun into
an otherwise highly polished show.

The Swarthmore Jazz Ensemble played Duke Ellington's Shakespeare-inspired suite at Saturday's Jazz Symposium.
The student combo section was followed by a lecture by opening movement based on Othello; "Star-Crossed
Perelstein on Thelonious Monk, a jazz pianist of the 1950'5, Lovers," a ballad based, not surprisingly, on Romeo and
Juliet; and the last movement of the suite, "Half the Fun,"
and Monk's connection with Duke Ellington's music, parwhich is based on Antony and Cleopatra.

What is Delicious?
Shyness: that tightening of the throat
when someone new walks by. The efficiency that keeps you locked in your room
with homework that could be done publicly. The laziness that keeps you from following up with acquaintances. The contentedness that keeps you from wandering
around and meeting new people.
Many of us identify as shy, or introverted. Yes, I am aware that there is a distinction: drawn between those who fear social
interactions and those who long for solitude. But I'm talking about the impact this

has on socialization with others. Some of
us feel that this is something to be worked

social connections. If connections are a
means of gaining power this appears as a
mal-adaptation, but this is not the whole
story. Shyness does not, in general, preclude the formation of any deep relations,
but it restricts their number. This, when
combined with a system that makes it far
more likely that the privileged will interact with each other than that they will
with the dispossessed and you have a sys-

tem for almost guaranteeing that the
oppressed will be unable to form relationships with the powerful.
It is through people that power relations run and shyness is a means of
restricting access to individuals. Shyness
is a defense mechanism, one of many, that
cuts off all but a favored few from power.

The loss to those already imbued with status is minimal, while severely hindering
the advancement of those less fortunate.
My theory of social fitness is testable: it
predicts that among successful people shyness will be correlated with privilege as a
child. For example, it predicts at
Swarthmore (a successful place to be) that

students will be more outgoing. I
haven't yet gathered the data on this (on
minority

account of near pathological shyness) but
even my small sample suggests that this
could be true.

It is through people that
power relations run and
shyness is a means of
restricting access to
individuals.
This means that in addition to needing
to recognize the differences of our backgrounds in a broader socioeconomic sense
it is necessary to realize that we have been
socialized differently. The way that we
expect and desire to interact with human
beings is different, and this difference is a
self-defense mechanism of the dominant
power structure. Thus even while recognizing that the shyness is real, that this is
not a faked condition, we must also work
against it.
This is indicative of what is required
for modern liberation. Patterns of thought
that make no reference to a class can still
lead to the oppression of that class. We

must look at the foundations of our beings,
of our existence. They evolved to support
us, to perpetuate our domination. It is time

we did away with them.

November X 2007

This is a painful process of introspection that must be matched in deed. It might

not be possible, psychologically, for this to
be done by one man by himself. Just as the
patriarchy is a social pathology so it
imparts a psychic pathology to those it
touches. By being here, students of historically oppressed groups have shown a
capacity for self-liberation and I assume
that they are less likely to be emotionally
conditioned to perpetuate their own
oppression.
Back to the main point, we must consider the real possibility that after 20years
we have been socially conditioned to interact with others in a way that perpetuates
our dominance, and we must act to treat

this as the mental illness that it is: the psychic manifestation of deeply ingrained big-

otry.
So we have a revelation: the path to liberation and social justice requires a
rethinking of psychiatry and psychology,
of healthy and unhealthy. In many ways,
psychiatry is practiced under the assumption that a mind capable of functioning

within the context of our modern society is
healthy. This must change. Instead, the liberated mind, the revolutionary and radical
mind must be seen as the healthy mind. Go
out and revolutionize your mind. It could
take years of psychotherapy, cognitive,
pharmacological or other, but it is essential to the freedom of mankind.

To the Editor:

As survivors of sexual assault and as members of

the queer community, we need to publicly respond
"Silencing
to the
column
of
Chalkings
Problematic" in last week's edition of The Phoenix.
This year's Coming Out Week chalkings should
be considered a great success for the entire
Swarthmore community. The Coming Out Week
Planning Committee took significant and welcome
steps to ensure the effectiveness of the chalkings,

while taking into consideration the realities that
survivors face.
We wish to emphasize that these groups and

their allies are not mutually exclusive. We thank
the Planning Committee for explicitly acknowledging this in separate e-mails to Swarthmore Queer
Union and Swat Survivors. We thank each chalker
for respecting the encouraged placement of sexually explicit chalkings outlined in the e-mail to SQU.
We thus object to Ms. Mendoza's implication that
the chalkings were censored. The concentrated
placement of the sexually explicit chalkings was
encouraged, not prescribed, and it was made clear
in the e-mail to Swat Survivors that the Committee
could not and would not control chalkers' actions.
The placement of the chalkings was a choice of each
chalker, and they overwhelmingly came out in support of survivors.

The Coming Out Week Planning
Committee took significant and
welcome steps to ensure the
effectiveness of the chalkings,
while taking into consideration
the realities that survivors face.
We recognize that to promote discussion and
normalization of queer identity, it is important for
some of the chalkings to cause discomfort.
However, in the past, the sexually explicit chalkings have been more than "uncomfortable" or "both-

ersome."
The reality of survivors' experiences with these
chalkings is much more disturbing and often symptomatic of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, including flashbacks in which a survivor relives his or
her trauma, severe panic attacks and detachment
from normal activities and relationships.
Ms. Mendoza wrote, "during the Clothesline
Project, few students objected to offering their support" for survivors. For survivors to offer equal
support for these expressions of the chalkers, there
must be, as with the Clothesline Project, a concentrated placement of the most triggering images.
Ms. Mendoza asks that "all students try to be

aware of the needs of the other individuals
involved." As queer students, we appreciate that
she is an ally of our queer community.
As survivors, we need and demand respect for
our experiences. The Coming Out Week Planning
Committee and the chalkers respected our needs
and created a safer and more effective space for a
broader range of identities. This year we can celebrate the chalkings and Coming Out Week as queer
survivors.

that we could tell
him about our
day, that he liked us just the way we
were, and that was that. For children, the message of individuality was as vital during the last show
of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" in 2001 as it was in 1969,
when it first aired. In the classical sense, Fred Rogers' gentle
spirit made him without a doubt one of the most Jesus-like
figures of the last century, and the kindest neighbor any of us
ever had. After his death in 2003, most eulogies credited him
with raising several generations of confident, positive chil-

for the self-absorbed. Mark
Zuckerberg, father of Facebook,
is starting to seem like an unnec-

save for one.

But the complaint that has gone
generally unsaid is beginning to look
like the most grievous: social
networking sites create a haven for
the self-absorbed.
In a polemical ploy for ratings not quite foreign to FOX
News, commentators on Rupert Murdoch's station recently
called Rogers an "evil, evil man," claiming that his legacy was
in birthing "a narcissistic society" and "ruining a generation
of kids." From all available indications, America and the
Internet convulsed in outrage at this blasphemy of Rogers'
memory, which was based almost solely on the ramblings of
a Louisiana State finance professor, and nobody else. And it's
worth saying
the kind of wild extrapolations that FOX
News commentators made were just that, and certainly not
legitimate sociological examinations of our generation's
youth. But the "narcissistic society" that they railed against

college students, telling us that we're
special, special, special, making us in the
end too special for our own good.
We're invited to publicize our favorite
movies, TV shows, books, and musical
tastes. We're asked to tag ourselves in hundreds of flattering pictures, tell the world where
in the world we've been, and post notes detailing our
personal thoughts. We're forced to be presumptuous, not
given the choice. Everyone has to have a profile, and everybody has to care. What if there were a Facebook where our
profiles were written by our peers?
The tendency toward vanity and self-promotion may be
stronger online, considering that it's really only the user
alone with his or her computer and conscience at a given
time. But narcissism has a way of leaking out. A study by a
San Diego State University psychologist concluded that signs
of narcissism have been on the upswing in college for 25
years.
On television, reality television makes stars out of nobodies like you and me. On the road, everybody wants to pimp

their ride, customizing mass-manufactured cars so they'll

William Hung-wannabes go platinum without an iota of talent. And even at Swarthmore, you can always hear the
muted dismay of your roommate when she asks, "You didn't

No, we didn't. But not because Palahnuik was right and
"You're not special." And it's not because FOX News was
right and Mister Rogers' focus on individuality turned us
into self-promoting brats.

only concerned with paying "to educate students that are
easy to educate." In my first column I also referenced this
tendency in passing as tokenism. The key idea here, of
course, is the token gesture, extended by a privileged party
to the marginalized; it is, on the surface, a gracious and
magnanimous act. There is, however, a lack of substantive
effort to be inclusive, hence the term "token." How does this
play out in institutional policies on and attitudes about
socioeconomic class?

elite institution as a
black male of working
class background. The
author emphatically
underscored
how
Amherst had provided
him with exceptional
income student, help-

ing him to be successful during his time there. For example, Jack had received a
$4OO Amherst startup grant for his first semester to purchase things like a winter coat, dorm supplies and class
materials. He had been provided access to special science
and math programs during the summer. Amherst had even
paid his plane fare home at the end of the year.
At first, I fell for the shameless Amherst plug hook, line,
and sinker it all sounded so lemon drops and lollipops to
me. Helping him buy his winter coat and flying him home
at the end of the year? Sheesh, the grass really is greener!
Granted, I soon perused the article more critically and
dredged up some facts, which tempered my view of
Amherst's programs a bit.
Still, reflecting on my own experience at Swarthmore
and comparing it to what I read about Anthony's, I can't
help but frame the whole thing as a pissing contest between
Swat and Amherst
one which ends with lil' Johnny
Swarthmore walking home in defeat, his eyes lowered in
dejection and fixed on his shamefully damp shoes.
You see, I expect that in some ways Mr. Jack and I have
a lot in common. For most of my life, for example, my family has subsisted at or below the federally established poverty threshold in the U.S. Some of my friends, similarly, are
low-income students of color. Yes, we get the amazing privilege of scholarships to come here, but where is our Swatsubsidized yearly plane ticket back home? Where is my
warm winter coat?
In my column last week, I commented on the fact that
colleges with "great power"
in concrete terms, gross
hoards of wealth shirk the corresponding "great responsibilities" that accompany such power. This is a short column, mind you, so in the small space that I have, I can't
develop the sort of statistically vetted comparisons that are
ideal for illuminating these issues. Nonetheless, with Class
Awareness Month now officially upon us, I thought it was
important to use the example of Amherst's commendable
efforts to begin including low-income and under-resourced
students as a frame for examining the policies and attitudes
about socioeconomic diversity here at Swat. Revisiting a
point I made in last week's column, I wrote that Swat was

Amherst buys into ideals like greater
access, diversity, and inclusion in a
substantive way; Amherst doesn't
just pay lip service to them, they
champion these ideals.
Well, going back to the experiences of people like
Anthony on our respective campuses, Amherst would be a
genuine supporter of socioeconomic diversity and

Swarthmore would be the tokenizer. Amherst doesn't sim-

ply commit its resources to providing "people like us" (and
I generalize lightly here) with a good education. It goes further, furnishing them with the additional tools that a very
different life experience demands. Why? Because on some
level, Amherst buys into ideals like greater access, diversity, and inclusion in a substantive way; Amherst doesn't just
pay lip service to them, they champion these ideals. There
are attendant moral obligations that dovetail with these
ideas, and if you're going to talk the talk, you've got to walk

the walk.
Swarthmore the tokenizer, on the other hand, brings
people like us here and then leaves us dazed and confused,
with the expectation that we'll assimilate. If they care so
much about us, then where are the programs demonstrating
this savvy compassion? Apparently, there is no exercise in
serious, critical self-reflection that comes along with all of
the glib about these ideals in institutional literature. If
there's a commitment here, it's of the most stunted and limited kind. No matter that low-income and working class students face a very different experience, particularly at elite
schools. "We're not interested in disturbing the peace of the
sorry if you read too much into those
'class status quo'
brochures."
Swarthmore's want of formally mandated and institutionalized commitments to ameliorating issues of socioeconomic class, here at Swat and in the larger world, is worrisome. Schools like Princeton, Davidson and Amherst have
eliminated the loan component in their financial aid packages and replaced it with grants. (There is a Swat corollary
to this program, but the funds have not been committed so
that it can extend to all students who demonstrate financial
need. See my last column.) Other schools like Harvard, Yale

and Stanford have eliminated contributions from families
below a certain income level (varying from $40,000 to
$60,000). But let me put the pom-poms and megaphone away,
because none of these schools
not even Amherst
are

the

where they could and should be in truly promoting these
ideals of inclusion, substantive or otherwise.
The basic point is still that, sure, Swat can be lauded
along with this select echelon of schools because it both
admits on a need-blindbasis and guarantees 100 percent of
a student's demonstrated need. But that's not enough if
there's no support once low-income students get here. If
you're going to be our cheerleader and champion to get us
to come here, you've got to stand behind us for the long
haul. Comandante Bloom, where are our public decrees
announcing Swarthmore's new commitments to no-loan
policies, or textbook funds for low-income students? Hell,
where's my winter coat??
As a prospective student, I was almost exclusively choosing from schools that would meet my demonstrated need.
My need was great, and I needed to go to the places that
were rich enough to pay for me. In choosing what schools
were at the top of my list, the knowledge that I would not
have to borrow made me seriously consider Princeton.
(Believe me, given my inclinations, that's saying a lot.)
From my own experience, then, I can see how important it
is to send these clear and highly visible messages that we
care. I heard those messages when I was looking at schools
so did Anthony, most likely
and it made me feel
Swarthmore cared about changing this screwed up world.
And yes, you may be asking why I would want to knock
my alma-mater-to-be, or introduce the potentially destructive prospect of "the grass being greener" into your oh so
hyper-analytical minds. Well, as I said in my last column, it
really is because I love this place. I know that there are
plenty of people here, administrators included, who truly
care about class, and more generally, diversity. And to its
credit, there are good things that I don't have the space to
arguably more tellingly good
mention here about Swat
things than the limited programs at, say, Amherst. But I
really want Swat to realize its potential, and that requires
administering a little TLC sometimes, right?
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for Swarthmore
enabling my presence here, and I don't want or need a winter coat right now. Still, I want to see Swat live up to its
ideals, especially when the means to do so are already within our grasp. (Not to mention that I always hear so much
self-congratulation on how we supposedly already do.) As I
see it, if it's true that for a given goal, where there's a will
there's a way, and we already have "the way," then we obviously need to get on ourselves about mustering the will.
There has, of course, been a lot of buzz lately about the
particulars of establishing and adhering to donor intent, a
problem which I'm sure gives the administration good reason to pause. However, maybe we should rediscover a
meaningful institutional mandate around socioeconomic
diversity today and worry about rich old ladies who don't
want to buy me a winter jacket later.
President Bloom said in his 2004 commencement address
on inclusion that "the resources are already at hand to fund
an inclusive world. And the responsibility becomes all the
greater to marshal the vision and the will to accomplish the
rest." Well I'm glad we agree on that one. So let's hop to it
already.

Puerto Ricans deserve better than a
status that grants them US citizenship but denies them the right to full
representation in Congress.
The way Puerto Rican political parties have dealt with
the issue has contributed to perception of deadlock and
irrelevance prevalent abroad. Until recently, there were
only three political parties on the island. The New
Progressive Party supports statehood, the Puerto Rican
Independence Party seeks independence, and the Popular
Democratic Party supports the current status or a more
"autonomous" variation. The recently registered Puerto

Ricans for Puerto Rico Party is the only party that supports
no single solution, but rather advocates a sustainable development agenda and the depolitization of the issue. Its innovative platform is a testament ofhow the debate around the
Puerto Rican status issue, not the status issue itself, has
been the major obstacle to the island's welfare.
Yes, the solution of the status issue is necessary for
Puerto Rico's full development, but the extreme emphasis
on its solution has even reversed some of the necessary
development achieved under the current status. If US and
Puerto Rican leaders want the island to move out of the
deadlock, they should either depoliticize the issue and focus
on the island's welfare, or work with Congress towards a
resolution.
The neglect of the issue, however, would be a disservice
to the Puerto Rican people. Puerto Ricans deserve better
than a status that grants them US citizenship but denies
them the right to full representation in Congress. They
deserve better than a status that preserves their national
culture but thwarts their sovereignty by excluding the
island from membership in important international bodies
such as the UN. In this context, a referendum that allows
them to reject the colonial status in which they live would

be a step forward towards the fulfillment of Puerto Rico's
right to self-determination under UN resolution 1514. This
would also let Puerto Rican parties know that the time has
come to work for the island's development, and not for the
realization of a particular status option.
In addition, the resolution of the status issue would send
a message to the developing world that the US is willing to
support its development while respecting national sovereignty. It could appease anti-Americanism in Latin
America, promote integration and cooperation and contribute to our ideological war against the enemies of the
open society. Inaction, however, could eventually provoke
anti-Americanism on the island and further its economy's
fall into bankruptcy.
Puerto Rico is at a crossroads. If Congress solves the status issue once and for all, Puerto Rico could move forward
towards its full political, economic and social development.
This is unlikely, given the lack of political will on the Hill.
But even if the status issue remains unresolved, the current
impasse between the opposing political parties must end
before it takes its toll on the island's welfare. Depolitization,
though equally unlikely, could break the deadlock. Either
way, let us hope that necessity will press for change before

Anyone who is
willing
to
spend
hun-

dreds of bilSound and Fury B lions of dollars
on a war, but
vetoed a fraction of that spending on healthcare for poor children, can't be a good guy. But at least if he were
more evil, his refusal to support a Congressional
resolution officially recognizing the Armenian
genocide would be less hypocritical, if not laudable.

The Armenian genocide, which occurred from
1915 until 1917, involved the Turkish government's deportation and massacre of hundreds of
thousands of innocent Armenian civilians. The
atrocity is considered, by many scholars, to be
one of the first modern genocides, due to its massive scale and its attempt to wipe out an entire
ethnic group. Despite the extensive historical
documentation for this event, the contemporary
Turkish government still officially refers to the
crime as a "relocation" and rejects the term
"genocide." Justificationfor this stance has varied; at times, the Turkish government insists
that any killings were not reflective of official
government policy, while at other times it claims
that Armenians were a legitimate political threat
due to their perceived closeness with Russia,
while still other times it argues that Armenian
ethnic "gangs" were attacking Turks. The reason
is ultimately irrelevant; the genocide occurred,
and no denial will change this. This has not
stopped Turkey from utilizing a law prohibiting
"insulting Turkishness" to prosecute intellectuals such as Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk who
has publicly acknowledged the genocide.
Despite Turkey's denials, 22 countries have
passed resolutions acknowledging that the
events that occurred between 1915 and 1917 fit the
modern definition of genocide. Recently,
Congressman George Radanovich (R-CA) introduced H.R. 316, which would have made the U.S.
the twenty-third country to officially recognize
the atrocity as a genocide. President Bush
opposed the resolution on the grounds that it
would damage relations between the U.S. and
Turkey, a crucial ally in the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan. The mere proposal of the resolution
was sufficient to cause Turkey to recall its
ambassador to the U.S., and the Turkish government threatened to withdraw its logistical support for the war effort if the resolution passed.
The chance of the resolution ever passing now is
virtually nil.
To be sure, there are legitimate reasons to
oppose the resolution. Anyone operating from a
pragmatic, non-idealistic realpolitik framework
could make the argument that it is pointless to
pass a largely ceremonial resolution with few
real-life benefits if this resolution would cause
real-life harm to the U.S. in the form of losing a
key ally. But Bush was never practical and nonidealistic. On the contrary, in the run-up to the
war in Iraq, his rhetoric was always ideological,
at least in public. His narrative framed the U.S.
as the bold, gallant liberator, intent only on freeing the poor innocent Iraqis from the yoke of
their evil oppressor Saddam Hussein.
And this is why I almost wish Bush had been
more openly evil the entire time. He wasn't fooling anyone with the feigned nobility of the Iraq
war; if anything, such rhetoric only made the

U.S. seem more sanctimonious. Bush never really cared much about any ideal; he wanted only to
secure his sweetheart private deals for oil and
security companies. No one ever believed in his
supposedly idealistic goals; his failure to do anything at all about the crisis in Darfur belies all of
his supposed humanitarianism. If he had explicitly said this, and openly adopted a mantra of
"Fuck you, we're America, we don't give a damn
what you think unless it's in our interest" to the
rest of the world, at least his current rhetoric on
Turkey would be intellectually consistent.

You can't claim the moral high
ground by opposing an
admittedly horrific regime, and
then cozy up with a
government that denies a
genocide.
But Bush never said any of this. Instead, we
had to listen to years of this cowboy prattling on
and on about the big bad Saddam and how we
were going to liberate the Iraqi people. You can't
claim the moral high ground by opposing an
admittedly horrific regime, and then cozy up
with a government that denies a genocide, as
Bush is doing with Turkey. After all, aren't we all
supposed to be terrified of the evil Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at least partially
because he denies the Holocaust?
I'm left almost wishing that Bush had just
sold the Iraq war by bringing out Dick Cheney in
a Darth Vader mask, breathing heavily, intoning,
"Never underestimate the power of American
self-interest."
But of course Bush would never do this. He's
far too wedded to his fairy tale hero narrative.
Indeed, it's almost surprising that he's so openly
basing his opposition to the Armenian genocide
resolution on such practical considerations as
not offending Turkey, rather than trying to claim
that this stance too is part of some larger ideal. If
Karl Rove were still around, and not under federal investigation for potentially leaking the
identity of a classified CIA agent, then we would
likely see all sorts of talking points about how
Bush is boldly defending the memories of the
innocent Turks who had no choice but to protect
themselves from the marauding gangs of
Armenians. Administration officials would
appear on Bill O'Reilly to call those who
acknowledge the Armenian genocide "alarmists"
and accuse them of "hating the Turks." Bush
would fly to Turkey and stage a photo-op of him
with his arm around the shoulders of Turkish
president Abdullah Gul, who he would praise as
a "bold leader for our troubled times" who
"stands up to those Armenian terrorists." Some
Democrat might suggest meekly that the
Armenian genocide might have actually happened, but conservative talk show host Sean
Hannity would proudly announce that Bush wasn't forced by circumstance to pander to genocide
deniers, but rather that Bush's stance shows
"bold leadership" against "those terrorist-coddling Democrats," who "care too much about the
rights of Armenians to take the steps needed to
protect our troops and our country." Fox News's
ratings would soar.
But Karl Rove is gone, and Bush's approval
ratings are far too low for him to attempt such a
bold-faced public relations coup. So he's been
reduced to a shell of his former self, too chastened to claim heroism anymore. Perhaps it's
better this way though. If he hadn't fooled the
American people with his false narrative for so
long, maybe we wouldn't be stuck in this unending quagmire in Iraq.

Understanding Islam
BYAILYA VAJiD
avajidl@swarthmore.edu

With the end of Islamo-Fascism
Week, I'm so thrilled to know that
our campus was above that. There

was no hatred
■ ip
T)M snown towards
Muslims, and neither
David
Horowitz nor Nonie Darwish, who
have both been traveling around
the country giving talks on
"Islamo-Fascism", was present.
They have both made appearances
on our campus before, one through
his jihad ad, and the latter during
her talk last spring, and though I
can't speak for other Muslims on
campus, I must say that this year
I'm feeling much more comfortable
as
a
Muslim student at
Swarthmore. In fact, this week,
instead of attending events for
Islamo-Fascism Week, I was called
by my old hallmate informing me
of events of an Islam Awareness
Week at the University of
Pennsylvania, one of which I was
able to attend, I was also contacted
about inter-faith dialogue.
These occurrences alone give
me so much hope for this country's
(maybe slowly) growing acceptance
or at least understanding of Islam,
even though throughout the country this week's goal was to spread
propaganda against Muslims. I
don't deny anyone's right to free
speech, but I think creating a week

like this is not based around discussing issues and determining
even the beginnings of solutions.
Instead it is based on singling out
one religious group and projecting
the actions of the minority fundamentalists and others who commit
actions that, though maybe in the
name of the religion, do not at all
adhere to the religion's principles.
I don't feel that my words can
adequately express the many problems with this week, so below is
link to an article written by a Rabbi
Arthur Waskow on his views of the
week and what it truly means. It
was sent to the Muslim Students
Association listserv by Humzah
Soofi 'lO, and I hope that you'll take
time to give it a quick read.

Most importantly I really want
to thank the campus for being so
much more open-minded than all
the universities that hosted events
for Islamo-Fascism Week. I was so
worried because my brother who is
just a freshman had to experience
the agony of it at the University of
California, Los Angeles this year. I
think it's also Muslims' responsibility to help increase understanding and satiate this newfound
curiosity about Islam, and hopefully next semester we'll be able to
bring our own awareness week to

Mourning the loss of 'the Zimbabwe before'
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

What I loved most

«

CHENGE MAHOMVA

Wawona
m^H mmmmmmmm

about my mother's stories of "The Zimbabwe
Before" were the rays of
warmth that would
stream out of her eyes
when describing the
Zimbabwean community. The community that
she portrayed had the
friendliness of Noddy's
town, Toyland, of Enid
Blyton's magical children's novels. As a
child, every grown-up
you met was an uncle
or aunt whom you simply had not had the

pleasure of meeting before. The other children on the
streets were siblings with whom you did not have the
convenience of living in the same house. For adults,
other adults were the people who you could pop over to
and borrow hupfu (maize meal) from or leave your front
door open to, so that they could watch your pot of sadza
on the stove while you went shopping.

Are we as guilty as our political
leaders of the crime of greedy
self-interest if we leave Zimbabwe
and concern ourselves solely with
our own survival?
The Zimbabweans had pride and strong resilience
born from the versatility in their interactions with each
other. I think what made the Zimbabwean community
prosperous was that there was an unwritten understanding that if the situation was going to get better, it had to
get better for everyone. There was an idea that all the
bellies in the community had to be full before one could
say that he or she was no longer hungry. Whether this
mentality is reminiscent of a cultural ethos that is finally catching up to the 21st century or not is irrelevant.
What is relevant is that today, this mentality is simply a

fading watermark conveyed only in the stories that parents tell their children when describing "The Zimbabwe

Before."

Arguably, the current conditions in Zimbabwe have
made it difficult for people to maintain this concept of
"collective improvement." A large percentage of the educated professionals, nurses, doctors, teachers, economists, journalists and the like have left Zimbabwe in
order to fill the bellies of their families and themselves.
This is because the professionals have realized that with
the skills that they have, they can emigrate and provide
a better standard of living for their families. The desire
to think not only of themselves can be suicidal. The
desire to want to stay in Zimbabwe and impart their
skills into the community is suicidal because of the current standard of living. The current standard of Hiving is
exemplified by the fact that the aisles of the majority of
supermarkets are bare. "Individual improvement"
means survival, "collective improvement" means agony

or death.
If we focus only on the Zimbabwean public health sector, the side effects of the current Zimbabwean community's inability to think of "collective improvement" are
the most painful. Almost all specialist doctors in
Zimbabwe have had to emigrate in order to survive. As a
result, it is not uncommon for people to die of curable
conditions or to be misdiagnosed in the miraculous event
that they are tended to by a doctor. In the early months
of 2005, a vehicle struck my great-grandmother and her
leg was badly injured. She was taken to Parirenyatwa
Hospital, the main hospital in Harare, the capital, and
the first things that my family members were told even
before the routine questions of "Name? Address? Is she
allergic to anything?" was that my family wouldhave to
find the bandages and medication needed to treat my
grandmother. The nurse, who kindly went a step further
than required, hinted that if my family wanted her to be
attended to within the week, it would be a good idea for
us to try to supply our own doctor because not only was
there only one plastic surgeon in Zimbabwe,
Parirenyatwa is almost solely run by junior doctors.
Maybe this headline from the British newspaper The
Telegraph exemplifies the situation better: "Welcome to
Zimbabwe's NHS: where the hospital curtains are used
for bandages and Anadin is often the only drug left."
My question to the 1.2 million members of the
Zimbabwean community living in South Africa, the professors and lecturers at various academic institutions,
the teachers working as maids in foreign countries and
-

-

perhaps even students like myself at foreign universities, is this: Are we as guilty as our political leaders of

the crime of greedy self-interest if we leave Zimbabwe
and concern ourselves solely with our own survival?
I think the majority of Zimbabwean expatriates do
think of themselves as being guilty of this crime and you
see it in the methods we use to cleanse our consciences.
Just as Lady Macbeth washed her hand persistently,
Zimbabwean expats try to cleanse their conscience continually. You see it in the courageous articles written by
the community in The Zimbabwean (www.thezimbabwean.co.uk notice the 'co.uk' at the end), you see it in
the articles posted on www.zimbabwesituation.com and
you see the desire to rekindle a sense of community on
the numerous blogs about "the good old days."
-

I think the majority of Zimbabwean
expatriates do think of themselves

Zimbabwean expats also show that they have not forgotten those who have been left behind. Studies conduct-

ed by the United Nations have shown that expats
throughout Africa send an obscene amount of money
back to their extended family remaining in their home
countries. In fact, many families in Zimbabwe survive
only because their family members in outside countries
send money and food home. In South Africa and the
United Kingdom, there are companies that are making
deliciously obese profits by accepting money from expats
and then delivering the goods to the family members
back in Zimbabwe.
Who would ever have guessed that the Noddy days
would end and that a sense of community, or just wanting to stay in your home country, could be synonymous
with a desire to commit suicide?
Perhaps my question should be directed to the ruling
elite in Zimbabwe and that is: "What have you done to
Zimbabwe?"

Being a queer ally calls for self-evaluation
BY ANDREW

PETZINGER

apetzinl@swarthmore.edu

I

Last week was Coming Out Week; for
many, it was a time to stake a claim to
thpir sAYiifll
and gender self-identity. For
those of us who are allies,
or hope to be allies, it also
brought clearly to mind

OP-ED

I

the

ongoing

effort to constitute a real

collective

community of
support, of solidarity and of compassion.
We are reminded of the imperative to be
more than just passive observers in the
collective endeavor of queer empower-

ment.

Certainly, being an ally
means having a conception of what sexual and
gender liberation is.
Certainly, being an ally means having a
conception of what sexual and gender lib-

eration is. It means being aware of how
our various privileges play out in our daily
life and interactions. It means rejecting
the forced and enforced definitions of "nor24

mal" human beings and human love. It
means upending the persistent efforts of
an alienating culture that attempts to
make discrete and clear what is robust and
complex beyond reduction.

We must desire an
education rooted in real
conversation and
negotiation with those we
hope to support..
I was recently reminded of one of the
basic characteristics of a queer ally. An
ally is not one who obeys a set of predetermined rules for "ally" behavior or reads a
basic rubric onto every situation. It is a
person who is eternally in the process of
becoming a better ally. Because if we are
serious about collective liberation, serious
about granting ourselves and the communities we support the agency of self-identification, then I believe we must realize that
our real work is to constantly be comingto-be with the communities we support. We
must constitute a space in which our conception of good alliance is evolving and
anti-essential, precisely insofar as we are

supporting the power to reject

cal

violence

that

the historiessentialism has

wrought.

This means that those of us who wish to
be allies must desire education. We must
desire an education rooted in real conversation and negotiation with those we hope
to support, not to construct for ourselves a
conception of the "proper view," but to
train ourselves to constantly reconsider
our convictions in the interest of understanding and consensus.
I do not care to discover the abstractions by which I can calculate "what a good
ally does." I want my education to be inthe-world and informed by the disparate
and distinct voices of others. For these reasons I want an ally community that resists
the tendency to tokenize, as much as they
must resist the artificial effort to construct
an essential, monolithic "queer voice."
The political and social community I
hope to participate in is one of mutual
empowerment, where one's personal evolution is informed by constant negotiation
and collective self-education. If queer
allies are concerned with constituting a
space for sexual expression and self-identity, I believe we are already in the business

of building this community. I, for one, hope
that all of my mistakes and necessary
reassessments as an ally are in the name of
bringing about such a community.

Men's soccer downs Fords, plays waiting game
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

For the Garnet men's soccer team, all that's left to do is
sit and wait. And keep practicing, of course. After a 3-2 win
over rival Haverford College on Sunday, Swarthmore anticipates the announcement of the ECAC tournament bracket
on Monday to see whether its season will continue into the
playoffs.

While the possibility to play in the regional ECAC's still
exists, the Garnet fell out of contention for Centennial
Conference postseason competition after a tough 1-0 overtime loss to Muhlenberg College on Oct. 24. Swarthmore
played with intensity to defend its home turf against the
Mules, and the teams battled to a 10-9 scoreless shot differential in favor of the Garnet after 90 minutes of regulation
and one penalty period. But Muhlenberg had the one and
only shot of the second overtime, as three and half minutes
in JonathanKliewer put a beautiful ball from 30 yards out
past Swarthmore's Ryan Sutcliffe 'OB.
"Obviously losing to Muhlenberg was really heartbreaking," Coach Eric Wagner said, "because it was senior
night and I thought for the last 30 minutes of the game that
we were really controlling the match
had we won that,
we'd be in the conference playoffs."
After drenching rains forced the postponement of its
match at Haverford on Saturday, Swarthmore faced off
against the Fords for its last regular season game on
Sunday afternoon. Though the Fords were witness in the
conference at 0-7-1, the Garnet did not take its opponents
lightly. Because of Swarthmore's superior record, "you
could expect us to win," JeffKushner 'O9 said, "but I think
that just because of the circumstances and the rivalry it
made it that much more competitive. Their whole season
comes down to playing us."
Haverford drew first blood in the eighth minute on forward Matt Stossel's fourth goal of the season, but the
...

Garnet never showed signs of defeat. "I never really felt
like we weren't going to score some goals," Wagner said.
"We'd already created a lot of chances. And sure enough, a
minute later, Yoi [Tibbetts 'o9] tied it up." Tibbetts' goal
came off an assist from Evan Nesterak 'O9 and was one of
Swarthmore's 20 shots in the game to just eight for the
Fords.

"No one on our roster this year
has ever lost to Haverford. We
want to continue that legacy
for many years to come."
Jeff Kushner 'O9
After 18 minutes of scoreless play, Haverford broke the
1-1 tie with another goal, this one from Dominique
Debucquoy-Dodley, who headed a free kick from John
Valantassis into the back of the net. Haverford retained its
advantage until the half. "Both times it was just laziness on
our part," Wagner said of the Haverford goals. "[lt was] not
marking properly and not attacking the ball in our own
box."
Swarthmore came out of the halftime period withoutletting up its energy, and Kushner tied the game in the 63rd
minute off one of Swarthmore's 15 corner kicks. Though it
didn't give Swarthmore the deciding advantage on the
scoreboard, according to Wagner, Kushner's goal was the
difference in the match.
"From then on, I knew we were going to win," he said.
Nesterak proved Wagner correct with his fifth goal in six
games and his second game winner, as he recorded an
unassisted tally in the 83rd minute.

"It was clear we were the better team the entire time,"
Nesterak said. "It was just a matter of really showing them
that we were the better team, and I think in the second half
we really showed them. I don't think they crossed the halffield line really at all." Swarthmore's dominating play in
the second period assured the seniors their fourth win in
four years over the Fords.
"No one on our roster this year has ever lost to
Haverford," Kushner said. "We want to continue that legacy
for many years to come."

Although Swarthmore went 11-3-3 on the season, tied for
its best record since 1966, the three losses were all to conference opponents, putting the Garnet at sixth place in the
standings. With 16 points, Swarthmore is just one behind
fifth-place Dickinson College, who finished the season with
a 5-2-2 record to the Garnet's 5-3-1 For now, it will hope to be
one of the eight teams in the region chosen for a bid in the
ECAC playoffs. Though the squad apparently knew after
Saturday's conference games that it had missed out on the
conference playoffs prior to its match against Haverford, the
ECAC tournament became another motivator against its

rivals. "We knew regardless of what had happened the day
before that we just needed to come out and get a 'W to get
our bid for ECAC's really validated," Kushner said.
And while Wagner said the team's chances of getting
picked are high, what it really wants is to be able to play the
first game of the tournament at home on Clothier field. "I
think we owe our fans an opportunity to give [them] another win at home," he said. "Our fans have been the best in the
conference without question." And while the team is still
working hard, it's not above having a little fun while it waits
for the big news.
"Right now we're going to practice, we're going to
assume we'll be in," Nesterak said. "We have this little
intera-squad scrimmage this Saturday. I think we're going to
just have some fun practices before we get to ECAC's and try
to win that tournament."

money,

mediocre results. Ironically,
however, both Mourinho and Jol have won more trophies and
achieved higher winning percentages than any of their predecessors in the last two decades! Mourinho brought Chelsea the
Premier League title in two consecutive years, while Martin Jol
spectacularly outperformed pundit expectations by leading

Tottenham to two fifth-place finishes, agonizingly short of a top
four finish on one occasion.
Expectations accordingly rose following Tottenham's success, which led the management to arm Jol with a massive
transfer kit, to the tune of 40 million pounds. Jol was entrusted
with a new season objective: achieve a top-four finish. There
was a problematic caveat, however, as Chairman Daniel Levy
and Director of Football Damien Comolli provided Jol with
guidance" on the usage of the club funds! This
led to the purchase of Darren Bent at 17 million pounds. Bent,
mind you, is a great striker. He is not, however, worth his price
tag, especially to a Tottenham side that already possessed a formidable strike force in Robbie Keane, Jermain Defoe, Dimitar
Berbatov and Hossam Mido. Also, just to put the ridiculous
nature of this purchase into perspective, Thierry Henry, one of
the greatest footballers in history, commanded a 16 million
pound transfer fee from Barcelona this past summer. Why did
Jol ask the board to purchase Bent, when he already has four
world-class strikers? He didn't; Comolli conveniently made the
decision for him. To make matters worse, Comolli denied Jol
one of his top transfer targets, Martin Petrov of Atletico
Madrid. This, in turn, upset fellow countryman Dimitar
Berbatov, who reportedly asked for a move to Manchester
United.
The rest of the story is rather self-explanatory: Tottenham
failed to gel as a team, and produced a string of poor results, culminating in a 2-1 defeat at home to Getafe in the UEFA Cup. The
Board then sacked him during the match, and Jol was made
unaware of this fact until after the final whistle was blown
when his nephew spread the word. Tottenham fans, during the
half-time break, had sung heart-warming chants exemplifying
their support for the best manager they've had in 20 years. To
their chagrin, however, Jol was sacked.
The Tottenham management's handling of this saga is a disgrace to football. Much like the Mourinho-Abramovich feud, Jol
was not given enough autonomy to purchase his own players!
How could the board have expected him to achieve a top-four
finish with players selected for him? Dressing room camaraderie is of the utmost importance in producing excellent
results. When Jol was forced to incorporate unanticipated players into his squad, the consequences were disastrous. Add to
that the arduous task of achieving a top-four finish in a Premier
League dominated by Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool
and Chelsea, and the ridiculousness of the situation becomes
apparent. The board should have either given or withdrawn all
of its support for him, instead of putting Jol in limbo. Or perhaps it just wanted to oust Jol from the beginning. It is no secret
that Daniel Levy has had his hidden love affair with former
Sevilla coach Juande Ramos, who has recently replaced Jol as
manager ofTottenham. If so, why didn't the board fire Jol in the
summer? Please, give the poor manager his dignity. He may
have produced "mediocre" results with an abundance of cash,
but he still is the best manager Tottenham has had in two
decades. Face the facts: Jol deserves praise.

Swat cruises into playoffs
BY CONOR CASEY

ccasey2@swarthmore.edu

The women's soccer team enters the Centennial
Conference playoffs this weekend as the conference's
number three seed after winning its final game of the
regular season over Franklin & Marshall College on
Saturday, 2-0.
Swarthmore dominated the match, frustrating the
Diplomats, who, with a win, could have clinched the
fifth and final playoff spot. The Garnet, however, only
faced one shot on goal the entire game and out-shot
the Dips 24-6.
Kirsten Peterson 11 had arguably the best game of
her young college career, as she scored both of
Swarthmore's goals, the first coming just under 27
minutes into the first half off of an assist from fellow
first-year Hannah Purkey 'IL The second came unassisted 11 minutes into the second half. Peterson is second on Swarthmore's points leaders list with 15, trailing only Megan Colombo 'll, who is credited with 18
points this season. Peterson's two goals on Saturday
doubled her season total, giving her four to go along
with her team-leading seven assists, three more than
anyone else on the team.
Peterson's efforts on Saturday, along with her
assist in the previous Tuesday's match against
Haverford College earned her Centennial Conference
Offensive Player of the Week honors for the second
time this season, the first time being the week of Oct.
15 when she notched a goal and two assists over two
games.

Other notables for the Garnet in the game were
Purkey, who, in addition to her assist, kept the pressure on Dip defenders with four shots, and Maggie
DeLorme 'lO, who contributed three shots, two of
which were on goal.
Prior to the game, the team's two seniors, goalkeeper Kristen Traband 'OB and forward Danielle Tocchet
'OB were honored as part of Senior Day festivities, an

annual tradition where seniors are commemorated for
their play and personalities on and off the field. After
the festivities had ended, however, the Garnet spared
no time in getting right down to business.

The victory solidified Swarthmore's third seed in
the playoffs, behind the top two finishers in the conference, Johns Hopkins University and Ursinus
College, who played each other to a 0-0 tie in their
final game of the regular season. Rounding out the
fourth and fifth playoff spots are Haverford and
Gettysburg College, respectively, who played last
night to determine which of them would face number
one seed Johns Hopkins in Saturday's semifinals.The
Garnet meanwhile will be facing off against Ursinus
in its semifinal, also on Saturday, at postseason tournament host Johns Hopkins. Swarthmore won the
regular season match-up between the two teams, 4-0,
but can expect the Bears, who led the conference for
much of the season, to put up more of a fight this time
around.
"We need to focus on keeping our head in it," goalkeeper Lauren Walker 'O9 said. "We can't take Ursinus
for granted. We can't take the game on Saturday lightly. We're just going to take it one game at a time."
With that said, Swarthmore players and coaches
appear to be very positive in regards to the upcoming
playoff game.
"We're feeling really confident,
Tocchet said.
"We're looking forward to meeting up with Ursinus
again."
Head coach Todd Anckaitis expressed a similar
"

confidence.

"We're feeling really good," he said. "We played
them well during the season, so we know we're capable
of that. At the same time we know they're a good team."
Anckaitis said that no changes will be necessary in
terms of strategy or play now that the Garnet are entering the postseason. Swarthmore will just play its game.
"We're continuing on the same path, so we're not
going to change a whole lot. We're here for a reason."
Over this coming weekend, the Garnet hopes to
take what eluded it by one victory last season.
"We're looking for that conference championship,"

Tocchet said.

Both semifinals matches will be played this
Saturday at Johns Hopkins, with the winners advancing to the championship match on Sunday to determine the conference champion.

Field hockey ends on high note with win over F&M
BY ANDY EISENLOHR AND
PHILIPPE CELESTIN

pcelestl@swarthmore.edu
The women's field hockey team finished
the season this weekend with a welldeserved victory of 3-1 over Franklin &
Marshall College. The victory over
Franklin & Marshall offered the fans and
members of the field hockey team a bright

ending to a somewhat disappointing season. The win was made even more enjoyable by the fact that it came only a week
after losing to rival Haverford College 4-0.
The Haverford game two weekends ago
was a heartbreaker for the Garnet to say
the least. Haverford scored once in the first
halfof play, only outshooting the Garnet by
a single shot. The second half saw another
three goals for the Haverford team despite
six saves from freshman goalie Katie
Ashmore. With that result Haverford was
able to break the tie between the two teams
in the standings and move three points
ahead of the Garnet who at that point sat at
9th in the table.
The Franklin and Marshall game promised to be a tough one. The Diplomats had
an overall record of 11 wins and 5 losses on
the season preceding Saturday's game.
This didn't seem to bother the Garnet, who
went on to score after only 17 minutes of
play with a goal from midfielder Ashley

dominate the women's and men's Centennial Conference

Garnet say goodbye to seniors with five-set loss
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

Don't let the ultimate result, a five-set loss to Franklin
and Marshall College, fool you
the Garnet volleyball
team's final match of the year on Saturday was a fine sendoff for its three seniors and a positive finish to what has
been a challenging season for the squad. After battling
through injuries and sickness in the past few weeks,
Swarthmore had its full team back on the court to face off
against the Diplomats last weekend. F&M entered the
game one spot above the Garnet in the conference rankings, with a 5-4 record to Swarthmore's 4-5. But from the
initial whistle, Swarthmore made itself look like the superior team in the matchup.

"The level of play was much higher
than we've seen for a lot of the
season and I think we really
rose to the occasion."
Karen Berk 'OB
"Going into the game F&M was really not expecting us
to be much of a challenge for them and we really shocked
them in the first game," Karen Berk 'OB said. "Throughout
the entire match it was really, really competitive. The level
of play was much higher than we've seen for a lot of the
season and I think we really rose to the occasion."
The Garnet took an early 11-3 lead in the first game
and never looked back, cruising to a quick 30-22 win to
take over the energy and momentum of the match. F&M
bounced back in the second game, going up 6-2 before

Swarthmore clawed back into the game with big kills
from Jen Wang 'O9 to earn a 11-11 tie. The game remained
tense throughout, as the Garnet never let up on the offensive front, recording a match-high 17 kills in the game.
With the game coming down to the wire, a double hit was
called on Swarthmore to tie the game at 29-29. Wang
recorded another kill to give the ball back to the Garnet,
but F&M responded with an attack tokeep the game knotted at 30-30. Katie Gold 'OB earned a side-out for
Swarthmore with another kill, but the Garnet suffered
from another double hit call, and Wang missed a kill to
give F&M the win and tie up the match at one game
apiece.

The loss was also a momentum shift, and the Garnet
struggled to reclaim its initial energy as the Diplomats
opened up another quick lead, 7-2, in the third game. Once
again Swarthmore came back to earn a 15-15 tie midway
through the game, but F&M snapped out of its daze and
went on to get a convincing 30-22 win in the game and put
the Garnet one game away from a loss.
But Swarthmore would not go down so easily. In a
fourth game during which it recorded 14 kills and just
five errors, the Garnet battled the Diplomats to the very
end, keeping the game close throughout and getting a big
kill from Berk on a 29-28 point to tie the match up again
at 2-2. In the fifth and final game, the two teams battled
early on to a 9-9 tie, with F&M earning a slight lead but
Swarthmore using an ace by Wang and a kill by Johanna
Bond 'lO, recently returned from a wrist injury, to tie the
score. The Diplomats scored the next three points to take
control of the match, as they won the fifth game, 15-10.
Despite the loss, Swarthmore did not leave the match feeling defeated.
"At the end we felt like we had played the best we
could and that's all that I asked of the team really,"
Coach Harleigh Leach said. "I'm very proud of them for

that."

"That was probably, [of] the four years that the seniors
have been here, the best we've played against them, so
even thought it would have been nice to end the season
.500,1 kind of feel like I'm at peace with the way the season
ended still," Vanessa Wells 'OB said.
All three of the team's seniors, Berk, Gold and Wells
had kills in the double-digits for the Garnet, and Wang
added a team-high 15 kills of her own. Those 15 were
enough to give Wang a share of the team's season kill

record (319), and Erin Heaney 'O9 had 19 digs to earn her
sole possession of the season dig record in Swarthmore
history with 492. Earning her own place in the history
books, Berk has moved up to third on the all-time conference list for blocks with 448.

"At the end we felt like we had
played the best we could and that's
all that I asked of the team really."
Coach Harleigh Leach
"This is my first senior class that every member was a
significant member [of the team]," Leach said. "Karen
Berk is the third-best blocker in conference history.
Vanessa has grown so much as a player ... [and] Katie Gold
is just a great athlete, she's such a team competitor. We're
really going to miss them."
November % 2007

With the loss of three of its most powerful players, all
of whom provide a dominating presence at the net,
Swarthmore will no doubt have a difficult time replacing
the seniors next season. Still, the younger players have
shown that they can step up when the team needs them, as
was the case when both Bond and Gold were out earlier in
the season. Wells especially praised the play of Monica
Joshi 'lO, Sarah Lambert 'll and Serra Kornfilt 'IL
"Even though we had unfortunate injuries or illness,
during those times when we didn't have Jo on the court
all three of them really stepped
or Katie on the court
up to the plate, they really impressed the rest of the

team."
As the team reflected on its season, which ended with
a 9-18 record, 4-6 in the conference, Leach can see
improvement in the way the squad has faced off against
top-level competition this year. "This is really our toughest schedule we've played," she said. "[The season] went
by so fast. It's just sad because I'm not ready for the season to be over and I know the team's not ready for the season to be over."
