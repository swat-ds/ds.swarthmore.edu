Matsuda Asks if Hate Speech and Academic Freedom Can Co-Exist
By

Rachel Dornhelm

Mari Matsuda, the final speaker of
this year's Intercultural Center series, gave a provocative talk Monday
on the controversies surrounding hate
speech.
It was a timely message, coming
on the third anniversary of a hate
speech incident on campus.
Matsuda, of the Georgetown University Law Center, began by expressing sorrow, but not surprise, at
the Swarthmore community's firsthand experience with hate speech.
"This is commonplace," she said.
"It happens all across the country." It
is our responsibility to probe for answers, she continued, and to find the

reasons for the polarization.
Her interest in the subject began
with her work on sexual harassment
five years ago. As a public figure in
this area, she began to hear more and
more personal stories from women
who had been affected by sexual harassment. What she had been tempted
to disregard as isolated incidents in
research, she no longer could. Instead, the stories pointed "to some-

thing epidemiological, something
systemic.. .institutionalized sexism."
Matsuda began to focus on to racial
hate speech, a subset of a group that
includes misogynistic, anti-semitic
and homophobic language.
While there are certain similarities
between all of these, she said, each

has a unique
psychosocial
motivation. For
instance, she
considered
homophobia to
be an outgrowth
of our society's
general problems dealing
with sexuality.
Racial hate

Anti-Subordination Theory.
Paraphrased, it
suggests that
"since all situations surrounding hate speech
are
unequal,
power relations
must be taken
into consideration."
Matsuda conceded that contextual analysis

sell in law because "we're

tioned critical

looking for easy all-purpose rules."
But, in fact, judgesfrequently ask for
the context of the cases they deliberate.

Of course, in the classic civil libertarian view, she said, all speech must
be allowed and protected. However,
she pointed out a contradiction. Libel, fraud and a long list of other
forms of speech are illegal. Why is it,
she asks, that we make some exceptions but not others? How can libel be
prosecuted and racial slurs be protected?
The origins of this discrepancy,
she said, lie with the pragmatists,
who believe that an enriching discourse is one in which everyone is
allowed to participate.

But Matsuda said that this generalization ignores the significance of
assaultive language. In her experience, hate speech limits classroom
dynamism.
"Try to have a hard discussion of
affirmative action where there's been
racial hate speech," she said. Try to
have a hard discussion about gay and
lesbian issues where there's a history
of homophobic remarks."
She closed by saying that we are
confused about free speech and academic freedom.
"We need a place for new ideas to
develop," Matsuda said, "but it disparages this academic freedom to put
racial hate speech in the same cat-

egory."

Lang Scholars Create Community Betterment;
Possible Changes in Scholarships May Occur
By Abigail Salerno

The Lang Opportunity Scholarships for Social Action present an
admirable challenge to which a handful of students rise each year. Applying to Swarthmore, students with a
deep interest in community service
and motivation to initiate social
change are invited to write an additional one page essay describing their
interests.
These students, along with others,
independently nominated, then visit
campus in the spring to learn about
the expectations that accompany their
Scholarship. Usually 6-10 students
are awarded this scholarship which
covers the work-study and loan portions of their financial aid package.
The scholarship is designed to relive these students of financial burdens in order to give them time to
concentrate on planning and executing their projects. These projects,

according to Lang Scholar Advisor
Myrt Westphal, require a lot of"time
and energy." The projects must be
designed with a mentor, possibly a
faculty member, a CIVIC leader, or
an employer at an internship or other
social agency. Westphal said that the
mentor could be anyone from "field
or faculty" that could "lend the wisdom of experience to [the] project."
Westphal added that projects
should show originality, defined as
"a new approach to either a new or
old problem...bringing a successful
solution to a new site...[or] improving a solution to a problem by changing certain elements to fit the site or
population better."
The project should also be able to
be applied beyond the setting it was
designed for and able to sustain itself
after the student has begun it. The
student should also be qualified to
enter the community, having an "understanding of the community needs

and characteristics" with the "languageand expertise" to be trulyhelpful.
Westphal explained that many
projects require a semester off, a summer spent working or a semester
where the student was taking a "lighter
load" of college course work.
Emily Bobrow's '96 REMEDY
project and Jeremy Weinstein's '97
Democracy Project in South Africa
were both described in the Phoenix
and show the enormous amount of
creative energy it takes to create a
meaningful social project.
According to Elizabeth Green '97,
her own project has been "an incredible opportunity [that] really adds to
my Swarthmore experience." Other
students currently considering
projects are Johanna Peters-Burton
'97, Vincent Jones '9B and Alyssa
Rayman-Read '99.
Beyond covering the financial aid
burdens, project Scholars can also

apply for a $ 10,000 Opportunity Grant
to help carry out the project and a
$ 1,000Academic Enrichment Grant
to pay for travel, books or additional
study need for the social action
project.
Recently, changes have been suggested that might open up this opportunity to a broaderpool ofSwarthmore
students. Although discussions of
change are still in the preliminary
stage, Westphal assured that these
changes would help students "do a
better job of [their] project." Elizabeth Green, already enthusiastic about
the program, added, "the proposed
changes seem like they will make the
opportunity more effective and more

accessible."
Any changes would be to improve
the
at
unique opportunity
Swarthmore, as described Eugene
Lang, to "fulfill a destiny, a responsibility that a human being has purely
because he is a human being."

Matt Robison

In an effort to showcase its activities and inconjunction with Women's
History Month, the Swarthmore
Aikido Club held a two-day seminar
this past weekend.
The event marked the first time in
the club's five year existence that it
has invited a guest instructor to teach
an official Swarthmore event. The
seminar was taught by Jane Ozeki, a
prominent teacher from therenowned
New York Aikikai, home to the leadership of the United States Aikido
Federation.
Ms. Ozeki holds the rank
of Shidoin, is a fifth degree black
belt, and has taught in New York and
in numerous venues around the coun&y-

The three Saturday classes were
held in the Tarble Gymnasium and
were attended by amix ofclub memstudents of Ms. Ozeki's from

New York, and Aikido practitioners
from around the region, including
high-ranking members of the nearby
Renaissance Aikikai and Turkshead
Aikikai.
The first class featured a range of
techniques, but focused most heavily
on moves related to an attack called
Katatetori, in which an assailant grabs
one arm at the wrist. Ms. Ozeki taught
a standardrange ofAikido responses,
which include pins, pain-compliance
wristlocks, and throws.
The second class shifted focus to a
different attack —a strike called
Shomenuchi—and included a scenario in which the attacked individual
(referred to as the Nage) has to apply
the defensive technique from his/her
knees. This type of practice is used to
teach movement and timing, and grew
out of the Japanese tradition of sitting
with the legs folded underneath the
body.

The day's final session featured a
wider range of movements, and included some of the more spectacularlooking throwing techniques of the
weekend. Students had an opportunity to practice several types of
Ukemi—methods for protecting oneself during a fall.
The second day's events were held
at the Turkshead Aikikai in West
Chester, a dojo affiliated with the
Swarthmore program and run by
James Walsh, the Swarthmore
Aikikai's head instructor.
The Aikido Club's leaders hailed
the seminar as a great success. "For
me it was the culmination of four
years of studying Aikido here," said
Sarah Guroff '96, one of the most
senior students, "and I think it was an
important step for the Swarthmore

program."
The seminar was planned to coincide with Women's History Month

and Ms. Ozeki was chosen as
instructor in part to highlight the success of a highly ranked woman in
Aikido. Half of the attendees to
Saturday's classes were women.
"Jane [Ozeki] is not just a terrific
teacher," commented NeiluNaini '96,
who met Ms. Ozeki while training at
the New York dojo this past summer,
"she is a terrific role model for anyone who does Aikido, both men and
women."
In its five years ofexistence, Aikido
has grown into both a well-attended
gym class and a popular club, fluctuating between twenty-five and thirty
members.
The leaders of the group hope that
events such as the seminar will help
to increase both the visibility and
popularity of the martial art at
Swarthmore and recognition of the
Swarthmore program in the Aikido
community.

After two years of research and
close examination of delicate issues,
the Task Force on Speech and Community is ready to present a report on
hate speech at Swarthmore to the
president. Two years ago this spring,
a racist epitaph was scrawled on
Magill Walk, and concerned students
approached the president to ask that
serious attention be paid to hate
speech at Swarthmore. The president
appealed to the College Planning
Committee and the Task Force was
formed.
With Hans Oberdiek, professor of
philosophy, as theTask Force's Chair,
they began the difficult process of
deciding what might be considered
hate speech and how the Swarthmore
community could respond to intimidating, demeaning or harassing
speech. The Task Force includes
Braulio Munoz, Nora Johnson, Tedd
Goundie, Karen Henry, Ngina
Lythcott and Larry Westphal, along
withstudents Robert Harris '96, Seth
Harvey '97, Curtis Trimble '96 and
Mark Friedberg '9B.
According to Oberdiek, the mission of the Task Force was "to brainstorm creative solutions... [for] addressing demeaning expression [that
would be] consistent
with
Swarthmore's tradition of academic
freedom."
The task force researched and reviewed the speech codes of many
other institutions and found that a
strict code was not appropriate to
Swarthmore, Oberdiek said. Instead
of trying to define standards for hate
speech that could be universally applied Oberdiek and the Task Force
tried to find regulations that could
deal with a range of situations.
Central to their proposal was the
idea that demeaning speech could, in
certain circumstances, be understood
as harassment, which is already defined by the Swarthmore Student
Handbook as "behavior directed at a
particular person that may reason-

ably be considered to be demeaning,
threatening or creating a hostile environment, defined as one that interferes with the ability to learn, exist in
living conditions, work or have access and opportunity to participate in
all or any aspect of student life." In

defining hate speech, Oberdiek focused on the "reasonable person"
standard used to measure the harm of
a statement, as opposed to only the
view ofthe aggrieved party. Oberdiek
also said that repetition identified behavior as dangerous hate speech as
well.
Trying to define hate speech and
legislate the punishment of it,
Oberdiek explained, is fraught with
complications. He explained that
vague legislation can be applied too
assiduously and interfere with academic freedom, while at the same
time a seriously presented but "less
than civil" and possible misguided
argument can cause the most pain. In
such situations a dean, acting to bring
conversation between the two parties, could try to educate rather than
punish the offender.
Anonymous offenders, whom
Oberdiek estimated by Oberdiek to
be the vast majority ofall hate speech
offenders, cannot be confronted in
this way, nor are they able to be
identified as harassers. Oberdiek reported that many people use email to
achieve an anonymous communication with their victim. Swarthmore,
Oberdiek explained, was not a place
that would call in "police force" to
ferret out perpetrators, could a "Response Team" could created to deal
with individual cases.
A group of students, faculty and
staffwould act as a sounding board to
make an appropriate decision to address wrongs. They would define inappropriate behavior and take suitable action. Rather than legislating
across the boardabsolutes for behavior, the Task Force has created a
system which will hopefully be able
to adapt to any circumstance accordingly.

On-Campus Movies Show Val Kilmer As Bad As He Can Be
By

Jonathan Evans
Jessica Keith

These are "Manly Men." No timefor women,
we must be obsessive about grunting.
The story develops as Hanna discovers
McCauley's gang, and begins to become
obsessed with taking him down. McCauley,
on the other hand, is on the verge ofretiring,
after just one more big heist.. .not a complex
plot. But the subplots are what this movie is
really about. You get to see the struggle of
living with an obsessed cop, what it's like to
love a professional criminal, etc.
This movie IS character development, with
some cool action scenes. Refreshing, you
might think. And so do I, reflecting. The
problem is, the movie tries to develop all of
the minor characters. Why they get all
wrapped up in Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer),
I'll never know. And the cook (Tone Loc) is
a totally useless character that just makes you
feel bad for rooting for him. If they eliminated half the characters they try to develop,
they'd reduce the movie by an hour, and it'd
be incredible. As is, though, you'll feel the
three hours.
What does make it worth seeing is the
scenes withPacino and DeNiro. If this movie
had just the action scenes (amazing beginning), the cafe confrontation between the
crookand the cop, and the final showdown, it
would be an amazing flick. With some good
lines, too...Pacino delivers his always great
"hoo-ah!" along with lines like, "I need my
angst. It gives me the edge I need." The man
had to have been a Swattie.
See it if you need something to do, and like
Pacino/DeNiro. If you have something better
to do, you won't cry over missing this.
Jessica: Nothing against the movie, but
I'm just not a DeNiro/Pacino kind of chick.
Jonathan: Well, I am. Especially when
I'm wearing that pink dress from Sager. And

and

Jessica: I was trying to figure out the
theme of this weekend's movies and the best
I could come up with was: "movies I haven't
seen and really don't want to see."
Jonathan: No, no, Jessica. The theme for
this week is movies about which you say,
"Oh yeah, Val Kilmer's in that."
Jessica: Val Kilmer's in these movies?
Jonathan: Ummm...yes.
Jessica: Interesting. I may have to see one
of them, especially since I hear that Val has
long blond hair in "Heat." Yum. But for now,
I admit to being a deficient movie
reviewer.. Jon, you're on your own.
Jonathan: Okay, it's all me this week as to
the reviews because... well, Jessica has more
of a social life than I do, I guess.
I'll start with "Heat," which will be on
Saturday. This moyie, as I found, is a remake
of a 1989 movie, "LA Takedown," also by
Michael Mann. "The heat is on...it's on the
street..." Yes, Michael Mann, the producer
of "Miami Vice." Given, I liked "Miami
Vice," but this movie just bothered me.
This is the first movie where Robert DeNiro
and Al Pacino perform on the screen at the
same time. And they are amazing...but the
movie is an hour longer than it needs to be.
Let me tell you the plot before I start dissin'
the movie. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is the
obsessed cop, who is on his third marriage,
and it is once again failing because ofhis job.
Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) is the adversary. His life philosophy is to not become
attached to anything you can't walk away
from if the "heat" comes around the corner.
He gives new definition to the term "professional criminal." Yes, you can grunt now.

cret!"

Jessica: Jon, I'm
sure you know all
about this movie, after all, you have the
time to watch bad
movies from 1984.

H

Jonathan: Well,
being that I'm stuck
in the Orwellian
world, society's already dead, so what
does it matter? Gosh, that was a Swattie

Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge), who is one of
the leaders of the movement. But another
leader of the movement is Hillary's old Blue
Lagoon lover, Nigel (Christopher Villier),
and the tensions build as Nickand Nigel rival
for Hillary's love. To do this, they try to
rescue her famous scientist father locked up
by the nasty East Germans. Geez, this plot is
more complicated than "Heat."
The jokes are as bad/good as they come.
The token black man, Chocolate Mousse
(Eddie Tagoe), Latrine (Dimitri Andreas)
who always dies, and the leader, Deja Vu.
"Haven't we met before, Deja?" "I don't
think so." This is not P.C., and it's dumb
humor. Which is why you have to love it.
So there you are. Val weekend. One good,
one bad. Both questionable.
Jessica: Well, yes, there you go. A random
movie weekend at Swat. If you're into the big
screen and you don't have a car (sorry), then
give one of them a try. But don't say I didn't
warn you (I didn't actually, but I just don't
want to hear you say it).
Jonathan: Right. It's all me this time, as
it should be. No, no. Down ego. Go to the
LPAC. It's a right-nice place, and you can
drool over Val. Peace, love and angst.

statement.

Okay, "Top Secret" from the makers of the
infamous "Airplane," "Naked Gun," and "Hot
Shots" series: Abrahamsand the Zuckerbrothers. They are the Weird Al of movie makers.
This one is a takeoff of spy movies, with a
western scene, and a bit of those classic Elvis
flicks. I love parodies.
But this one has VAL KILMER! Back
when he was doing odd comedies like "Real
Genius." Val is the hero, and he gives me a
warm fuzzy. Yet we can't forget that people
like Omar Sharif are in this as well. Makes it
a true classic.
This was made during the time of the Cold
War crisis movies, and is definitely reflective
of the era. East Germany wants to fly in a
musician, and since they can't get Leonard
Bernstein, they get Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer).
Nick is a combo between the Beach Boys and
Elvis—Mr. America with the poofed blonde
hair, leather jacket with the upturned collar,
etc. Does a great dance scene to impress a
woman in a diner, just like Elvis! Woo-hoo!
While in East Germany, Nick gets all involved with the underground movement, because he falls for the woman, Hillary

PART I: It's a Small World

Last week my friend Jui-wen (who is from Taiwan,
which is not, as she insists repeatedly, part of China) and I
were in the local Gasthaus, Weißbrau, waiting somewhat
anxiously for the Fasching celebration to begin. Who
should happen to walk in but Herr Schwarz and his wife!
Suddenly, it really seemed like Carnival. There was
dancing and people in silly costumes and German music,
including the famous chicken dance, "Frau Meyer is wearing yellow underwear," and "Resi, I'll pick ya up on my
tractor." (All of these are loosely translated by the author.)
Herr Schwarz, although over 70, was an excellent dancer.
Frau Schwarz had a lovely time playing matchmaker. One
of the dances entailed a "Damenwahl," or Ladies' Choice,
so she insisted that Jui-wen and I ask men whom we did not
know to dance.
Halfway through the evening there was a "show." The
Fasching Prince and Princess danced a waltz, and then the
German equivalent of cheerleaders came and did what I
guess you could call a cheer to "Stars and Stripes Forever."
Finally, there were two guys in boxer shorts and trench
coats standing on two chairs. They were serenaded by
another guy in drag, who was doing strange things with
kitchen ladles which I will not describe so as not to offend
the sensibilities of more sensitive readers.
Near the end of the evening Herr Schwarz asked me to
dance one more time.When the dance was over he said, "A
long time ago I was 18 and in a trench with a machine gun
shooting at American planes that were shooting at me.
Luckily, we didn't hit each other. Who would have thought
that 50 years later I'd be dancing with an American girl."

Respect for everyone.
Being part of a community means respecting others and taking responsibility for our own actions.
In class discussions, Swarthmore students tend to take this concept for
granted. Intellectually, we know not to leave messes for others to clean up, not
to trash public spaces, not to create work for others needlessly.
But in practice, we don't always remember our responsibilities to others.
Every day, students rush through their dorms, Sharpies and Essie Mae's,
leaving a mess without thinking twice. Housekeepers have to clean up dirty
dishes, strewn newspapers and vomit when students don't takeresponsibility
for the messes that they and their guests make. Dining hall workers have to
clean up the messes that result from food fights, sloppiness and plain old
laziness. The same is true in the Tarble lounge.
It should go without saying that students should clean up their own vomit
and spilled milk. And Student Council shouldn't have to send all-campus email telling students to bus their trays in Sharpies even when there are special
events like Screw Your Roommate. There is no justification for leaving
hundreds of trays smeared with food—not to mention other things that we
can't write about in a family newspaper—all over Sharpies for the staff to
clean up.
Many altruistic, liberal, and high-minded Swatties speak of the importance
ofconsidering other viewpoints and respecting people ofall backgrounds and
in all positions.
Yet when given a chance to act according to these ideals in the simplest of
ways—by cleaning up after their own messes—we act like children. Too
often we fail to consider how our actions-or lack of actions-affect the lives
of college staff members. To put it harshly: Practice what you preach.

Maurisa

Thompson

Traveling to South Africa was in
some ways like taking a journey into
a photo negative of the country I had
left. Everything seemed reversed, and
I recalled a childhood fantasy in which
I believed that if I stood on the other
side of the world, blood wouldrush to
my head. It was similar to the feelings
I experienced in seeing hundreds of
thousands of people, all around, every day, who looked like me. For the
first time in my life, I was in the
majority.
While I couldn't speak any other
languages and knew only a little about
the cultures I encountered (and indeed, within South Africa I appear to
fall under the apartheid category of
"colored"), just seeing other African
faces was reaffirming. Being in the
majority also meant finally celebrating the political empowerment of a
people whose history in many ways
parallels that of African-Americans.
I found incredible inspiration in
watching the "transformation" into a
"new South Africa" take place, and it
made me think about my work here,
and what South Africa's experience
has to say to the world in terms ofrace
relations and changes in racial policy
as we head into the twenty-first century.
Never before have I heard race
relations discussed so explicitly orso
candidly by both blacks and especially whites, together or separately,
as in South Africa. Ironically, I think
this happened because the history of
apartheid itself is so recent and so
explicitly brutal. No one I listened to
argued or disagreed that the oppression existed to the extent that it did,
no one tried to rationalize it: it was
public, common knowledge, and now,
under the new government, publicly

condemned.
This was significantly different
from the experiences I have in my
classes and conversations here in
Swarthmore and in other places,
where I constantly find myself having to weed through liberal rhetoric
and theory to explain my position and
show people, most often white, how
racist realities play themselves out in

American society.
This is not, by any means, to say
that both liberal theory and racist
realities are no longer present in South
African society. I read an intriguing
editorial in the Johannesburg Mail &
Guardian which spoke of a white
woman having "survived" the painful experience of realizing the shortcomings of South African liberal
thought, how naive and offensive it is
to be "color blind" to the point of
ignoring (in her case) black South
Africans' history and experiences,
and the reality that white liberals in
South Africa no longer can nor should
be the representatives or organizers
for Africans.
I had a run-in with the white secretary of the now all-African Student
Resource Center at a historically white
university, who was not only extremely rude to me but also, as I
witnessed later, to the black students
she was supposedly hired to help.
"Kick out racist administration,"
carved on the wall, testifies to the fact
that even though there is now political majority rule on the highest levels
of South African government, lesser

institutions in government, education,
and other areas still harbor much of
the same racist bureaucracy thatruled
under apartheid.
The latter situation is not unique:
similar circumstances occur in obvious and not so obvious forms in the
U.S., and, I am sure, elsewhere in the
world. The difference lies in actions
such as new requirements for school
children to learnthree to four ofSouth
Africa's eleven national languages—and things like that give me hope.
The constitutionalassembly is debating how to phrase the hate speech
clause in its new constitution. Eradicating race hatred and discrimination, and somehow building a country that includes all South Africans,
have become institutionalized, national priorities.
I find these actions exciting. At
least on this level, I'd like to see
South Africa make the United States
look bad.
Nevertheless, some liken this period in South Africa's history to a
kind of "honeymoon" at the beginning of a very arduous process. I
heard this term in discussions and

read it in some South African newspapers, and I also talked to people
who thought that it was painfully
true. In some ways, Mandela is the
one figure who maintains stability in
the country. There is a significant
amount of anxiety over who
Mandela's successor will be when he
steps down in 1999,and even now the
value of the rand fluctuates with his
health. Some foresee racial and economic conflicts returning within ten
years: the end of institutional apartheid did not change the economic
apartheid that went with it, in that
whites and white-owned businesses
still control most of the nation's
wealth.
I don't believe the policymakers
have any illusions about the ease of
transformation. One can only hope
that in the end it will be the concerted
effort of people who are dedicated to
a complete transformation of their
country that will make the new South
Africa possible. I said when I returned, and still say, that I'm a little
homesick. It's nice to be, at least for
a time, on the winning end of a
struggle.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
To all you neanderthals who gawked, stared, and took pictures while the rest of us—both queer and
straight—f***** our gender and enjoyed the Sager Party, transvestism, and the carnivalesque:
We understand that we possess your dreams and fantasies, and we have sympathy for your desire
to stare and worship. We even sympathize with your need have pictures of us for your future, more
personal moments of pleasure and satisfaction. And we know that you recognize that the world is
our runway, while you can only sit by the sidelines taking pictures of those more fabulous than

youselves.
But honey, if you flash that camera in our faces ever again we'll scratch your eyes out. Paparazzi
comes before the party, not during! Who raised you, anyway?
Until you get it together, get out of our way.

SPORTS
Baseball Team Wins,
Gains Some Respect
Split with Hopkins, Beat Montgomery CC
By

Frank Amar

Last Saturday afternoon, the Garlooking for two things:
theirfirst Centennial Conference win
of the season and a measure of respect. By 5:00 p.m. Saturday afternoon, they had gained both.
After getting swept by Gettysburg
the previous Saturday, it was very
important for the GarnetTide to get a
win in conference play, with the meat
of the conference schedule coming
up soon. Also, having won two games
during the week.the GarnetTide was
looking to keep the momentum going. All that stood in their way was
the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, one of
the better teams in the Centennial
net Tide was

Conference.

The gamebegan with the Blue Jays
launching an artillery barrage on the
outfield fence, smacking three home
runs off of starter Sam Voolich '96.
All told, Voolich would get scorched
foreightruns, seven earned, andeight
hits in 3.1 innings. Reliever Dave
Lischer worked the last 3.7 innings,
surrendering three runs courtesy of a
round tripper. The Garnet Tide offense produced four runs on six hits,
led by Matt Wiggins' '96 with three
hits, but it wasn't enough as the Blue
Jays won 11-4.
In game 2, the Garnet Tide looked
to crank the offense up. Craig Rodner
'96 led the game off with a walk.
Rodner's persistence on thebase paths
caused Hopkins' pitcher to throw two
balls away, advancing Rodner to third
where he scored on a Frank Santora
'96 double, who extended his hitting
streak to nine games. TheTide added
three more in he third, making the
score 4-0.
Starter Chuck Hudson '96 was unable to hold the lead, giving up four
runs in the tOD half of the fifth The

Tide notched two runs in the bottom
of the fifth, giving them a 6-4 lead.
Once again, Rodner advanced at will
around the bases, stealing secondand
third after being hit by a pitch. He
scored on a Santora sacrifice fly, and
Pat Straub '97 scored on a Bob Mascia
'96 groundout.
Ben Sousa '9B, in relief of Hudson,
picked up the win, throwing hitless
baseball over the last 2.7 innings. "It
was decent to get a win, but we can't
be content with winning one out of
two even against a good team like
Hopkins," said manager Brad
Hoffman. "It's good that we got a
little respect from them.... It's just
good to win a game from them. We
still have a lot of improving to do, and
I think we're going to get better. As
this league season goes on, if we get
some breaks, I think we can make
some things happen."
Yesterday, the Tide played host to
the Montgomery County Community
College Mustangs. Early on, the game
threatened to be a rout. The Garnet
Tide exploited the Mustang pitching
staff for eleven runs on nine hits in
the first three innings. Chuck Hudson
was cruising along just fine, until he
encountered some difficulties in the
fourth inning.
With an eleven run lead, it seems as
though the Garnet Tide forgot how to
field the ball. Two errors and a badly
misplayed infield pop-up later, the
Mustangs were back in the game,
only trailing 11-8. That was all for the
offensive fireworks, as Jeremy
Bonder '97 worked the last two innings to pick up his second save of
the season.
This afternoon, the Garnet Tide
plays host to Widener and they travel
to Chestertown, MD to play a double
header against the Washington
Shoremen.

Club Sports

Buzzards Top Lafayette
By Tony Sturm

Swarthmore men's rugby defeated Lafayette last weekend in a
sloppy game, 5-0. After the two
teams played a scoreless first half,
Jason Dougal '96 scored in the
corner of the try zone off a ruck for
the game's only points.
The Evil Buzzards had numerous opportunities to score but shot
themselves in the foot each time
they drove deep into Lafayette's
end. "We played poorly and won,"
said Dougal. "But that is a sign of
a good team—one that can still win
even when they play badly."
Swarthmore was hit with numer-

ous penalties in a game in which

the referee was quick with teh
whistle.
Each penalty seemed to come
right when they were on the verge
of scoring another try, which was
very frustrating for the team. The
Buzzards felt they were the better
team that day, and the team in better shape. After most rucks and
scrums, Lafayette players were on
the ground catching their breath
while Swat players were up and in
pursuit of the ball.
In B-side action, despite the fact
that Swarthmore was a ble to run
some strong back lines, the
Buzzardlings lost 10-0.

Women's Rugby Ties
By

Annie Bacon

Despite the beautiful weather at
Rutgers University last Saturday,
the Swarthmore Women's Rugby
team was a little disappointed after
it tied one gameand lost the next to
Rutgers. Although Swarthmore
played well in both the A- and Bside games, the overall level of
play was not as high as it had been
in the Bryn Mawr/Haverford game.
In the A-side game Rutgers
scored thefirst try, but it was closely
followed by Kelly Shannon's '96
try for Swarthmore. That was all
the scoring that wither team could
muster that day, as they wound up

tying 5-5. In the B-side game, although it was a tough fight, Rutgers
shut Swarthmore out 20-0.
Following the referee's statement: "I don't like to blow the
whistle, I'm just going to talk to
you as you play," both games were
allowed to proceed with relatively
little interruption. As a result the
game was quite sloppy. In addition, it was to Swarthmore's disadvantage to play only 20 minute
halves.
However the team hopes to crush
Millersville in its next home game
Saturday on the DuPont field. The
A-side plays at 11:00and B-side at
12:30.

Swat V-Ball takes 1 of 3
By George

Matula

Swat V-ball had two close
matches last week against Eastern
and Haverford Colleges that could
have gone either way.
And on Tuesday,
Swarthmore beat La
Salle in four sets.

After losing in three
sets to Eastern College

last

Tuesday,

Swarthmore took on rival Haverford last
■■
Thursday. It was an exciting match,
as it came down to a fifth set to
determine the winner. Haverford
edged Swarthmore in the last frame,

winning 14-16. Great fan support
kept the Garnet in the game.
Fresh from those disappointing
defeats, the Garnet was set to exact
revenge. La Salle was Swat's unfortunate victim. . The
team came out with great
intensity and blew La
Salle out in the first two
sets 15-3, 15-3.
Swarthmore lost their
concentration and the
third set 5-15. But, they
came back strong in the
fourth led by outstanding hitting
by Dave O'Brien '96. They won
the set 15-5, and consequently, the
match.

The Swarthmore women's tennis

Ursinus College by a score of 8-0.
The match began with doubles, consisting of eight game pro-sets. The #1
doubles team of Hillary Gehlbach

pounded their opponents, 8-1, as did
the #2 doubles of Rani Shankar '9B
and Neena Shenai '9B.
Nga Lai '97 andElena Rosenbaum

Women's Lacrosse Falls
Team fails to tie up game in waning seconds
By

Helen Oliver

Coming off an early season winning streak, the momentum of
women's lacrosse team slowed this
week with losses to Dickinson College and Johns Hopkins University.
Although ahead at the half,
Dickinson's impressive finish on
Saturday gave the Lady Garnet their
first loss of the season, with a score of
9-8. The team played tough until the
end, but the conference rival simply
proved to be too much.
Though the game was a close contest, the final minutes proved crucial.

Down by two with 14 minutes to
play, the team scored one more goal
to bring the score within one. In the
last five seconds, Swarthmore was in
control of the ball, and Lia Ernst '97
was fouled in front of the goal. With
two seconds remaining on the clock,
Ernst had an eight meter penalty shot
and a perfect opportunity to tie up the
game. However, the keeper prevented
the score and the gameended quietly.
Although they were disappointed
with the loss, Coach Karen Borbee
reminded the women that the game
was just one of many, and that "the

This past weekend proved to be a
tough one for the men's tennis team
as they traveled to Williams and
Amherst. After a long trip and good
night's rest in a Williamstown beadand-breakfast, the Garnet were up
bright and early Saturday morning
for the big match against Williams.
While the sky was bright and the
temperature just right, so was the
Garnet Tide. Barry Mook '96 and
Roger Werner '9B captured the first
doubles match against the number
seven nationally ranked players from
Williams. To secure the point for the
Garnet, Greg Emkey '99 and John
Derdarian '97 showed what team
work is all about.
After close to an hour of tennis, the
dynamic duo pulled out the victory
for the Garnet, giving them a 1 -0 lead
over the boys from Williams. Then,
at number two singles, George "hear
me roar" Khalaf '96 pulled out a huge
victory, Contributing to the Garnet's
third victory for the day was
Derdarian, winning in three hard
fought sets.
Unfortunately, the Garnet went on
to drop four points to Williams, as Ed
"you're dead" Ernst '9B, Nicholas
Slimack '99, Werner, and Mook fell
to the Williams players. The Garnet
played a tough match as they lost 4-3
to Williams, currently ranked fifth in
the nation.
Saturday night they traveled to
Amherst, where they encountered a
frenzied town in midst of the Final
Four. Staying in the heart of the

In Swarthmore's second varsity
loss of the week the Lady Garnet fell
to Johns Hopkins, a team which has
dominatedthe CentennialConference
for the past two seasons. Although at
the outset the team was optimistic
about beating the opposition with a
passing offense and a tight defensive
game, Hopkins was able to control
the play and prevail by a score of 144.
Despite limitedshots on goal, Ernst
and Ewens each scored, and Baker
accounted for two. The defense, led
by Nancy Rosenbaum '96 and Sarah

although Hopkins' speed made defending the field difficult.

preparing to come back strong at
Ursinus college this coming Tuesday. In another conference contest,
the Lady Garnet seeks to reestablish
the winning combination of talent
and team unity that they hope will
carry them through the season.

Sunday morning got off to a good
start as the Garnet captured the
doubles point from theLord Jefferies
of Amherst. Emkey and Derdarian
stomped on their opponents while
Ernst and Slimack made meat out of
theLord Jeff s. After a brief dispute
between coaches and mindless strategy by the Amherst team, the Garnet
were firedup for the singles matches.
Unfortunately, the Lord Jeffs
proved to be slightly better than the
Garnet on Sunday afternoon. At numbers two and three singles, respectively, Khalaf and Ernst each lost in
three tough sets. At number five
singles, Slimack fell in three sets as
well. Mook, The Garnet's number
one player, lost a close match.
Derdarian and Werner did come out
victorious to contribute two more
points but Amherst came out on top
with a 4-3 victory.
"Everyone played well and fought
hard," said Ernst. "We lost two very
close matches —a heartbreaker. But,
that's not the end of us, baby. We'll

be back. If and when we play those
guys in regionals, we are going to
take 'em down. It will all be over
then."

Highlights of the distance events
included Scott Reents '96 winning
the 5000, Wyn Strodtbeck '9B placing second in that event after an intense battle between him and several
fiery 'Fords, andTimSibley '9B busting out a three-second personal record
of 2:02.
In the 1500, Duncan Kirkpatrick
'99 ripped through the race while
setting a personal record with a time
of 4:07, while Fred Gerson '99 broke
his personal record that he had set the
week before by 13 seconds, winning
his section with a time of 4:22.
In the field events, Brian Baird '99,
Shan Sutherland '97, and Nate Mason '99 dominated the pole vault,
placing 1-2-3. In the sprints, fans
watched in awe as Turner sliced
through some thick competition to
capture first in the 200.
Although Swarthmore did not have
a chance at capturing the team title in
the final events, the meet ended in a
thrilling climax for several Swat athletes. The men's 4x4 team, with Eric

Pakurar'97,SamPaschel '96, Reuben
Canada '99, and Mike Turner '96,
edged past Haverford by five meters
to capture a shining first place.
Looking ahead, theathletes ofSwat
Track will keep to the home field for
yet another weekend, using the momentum from this past meet to cut
deeper into the competition around
the conference.
