Men's center added

day, Student Council will present
the top two options to the student
body again in a runoff.
Kopeikin's proposal for the
center said it would include,
among other things, a television
and VCR, video games, a sound
system and a "sexile/conference
room." The center would host
speakers on male gender issues,
"workshops on things guys need
to know in the real world," and
evenings of Monday Night Football.
"With much of the focus on
minority clubs and support
groups at Swat," the proposal
said, "many times funding and
support for males is overlooked
in favor of a more Politically
Correct cause. We hope to correct that."
Kopeikin came up with hisproposal after the deadline Student
Council had originally set for
plans for the student space in
Sharpies 111, which will be renovated this summer once Student
Council finds a plan to support.
He saidhe asked the council's cochair, Matt Schwartz 'Ol, if there
was any constitutional way to
add it to the ballot.
Schwartz, who said when he
first heard of the idea's content
he "laughed," told him he knew
of no other way than a petition
for a referendum, which requires about 140 signatures.
Swarthmore's student body is
officially listed as 1,375 students.

A "men's resource center" is
now one of four proposals in a
referendum to decide the fate of
student space in Sharpies 111.
The late-entry proposal joins one
for a 24-hour computer lab, another for additional student art
space and a third for the status
quo.
Student Council voted to add
the late proposal to the balloting,
which is continuing through today, after Carey Kopeikin 'O3
gathered 146 signatures in favor
of it. The council's constitution
states that referendamay be initiated with signatures of at least
10 percent of the student body.
"I figured that at Swat the
men's resource center would not
go over very well," said
Kopeikin, who gathered the signatures quickly. "It turned out to
be no problem," he said.
But the proposal has quickly
aroused the ire ofothers on campus. In a letter to the editor and
an op-ed piece in The Phoenix

Committee, listens as Student Council co-chairs Jared Solomon, right, and Matt Schwartz praise his work.

Bess to resign at end of semester
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Josh Bess 'OO, for three semesters the Student Budget Committee treasurer, submitted
his resignation to Student Council Tuesday.
The resignation is effective at the end of this
semester.

Bess, who became the SBC treasurer in June
1998 after three semesters as an assistant treasurer for the committee, maintained the student activities accounts through a time of repeated budget controversy while still managing to help create several new student programs.
"This was a difficult decision," Bess said,
reading a written letter of resignation to Student Council, and "my reasons are relatively

complex and mostly personal."
Bess saidthat through the "momentum of
forming the tasks associated with this job" he
was "losing touch with the people that I was
once close to."
As he entered the last semester of his senior
year, Bess said he also wanted a chance tqr"remember my last months at Swarthmore for the
good times I had, not the budget crisis I was in '
the middle of."
Bess said he would find and train a replacement and serve as adviser to that individual
next semester. Currently Laura Farra 'Ol and
Marvin Barron 'O2 are the committee's assistant treasurers.

"I know this comes at a time that is logistically and politically awkward," Bess said to the

temporary Liberalism."
The Harvard professor's remarks began with a flurry of statistics highlighting the increasing divide between society's
haves and have-nots, both in
terms of wages and political
power. Since the early seventies,
said Wilson, the lowest-paid
quintile of workers experienced
a substantial decrease in real
wages; over the same time period, wages for the top five percent of the population have risen.
As aresult, the 1990s have found
much of America working
harder, for longer hours, and

with less job security than ever.
With therecession of the early
nineties, Wilson continued,
workers became even less secure in their work and thus more
prone to what he referred to as
"political demagoguery." He
suggested that the early nineties
represented the perfect time for
the rise of anti-affirmative action messages.
In the burgeoning late-nineties
economy, however, these tensions have subsided and presented America with a chance to

SAC appeals budget allocation for spring semester
By Deirdre Conner

Phoenix Staff

After deciding that it had not been
given enough funding, the Social Affairs
Committee has decided to appeal to Student Council for money it claims is
needed for special events.
In the meeting of the Student Budget
Committee on Oct. 31, SAC's funding for
parties was raised from $BOO to $lOOO per
weekend. However, the group's special
project budget for next semester was cut
from $9OOO to $5OOO. SAC appealed the
decision, and was granted $l5OO more.

It is now planning to go over SBC's head
and appeal to Student Council for the full
$9OOO this week, saying that $6500 is not
enough to cover events planned for the
spring semester.
"SAC feels likes it's being treated as a
subsidiary of SBC, when it's not [under
SBC's jurisdiction]," said Dave Thomas
'O2, secretary of SAC. "It's a direct subsidiary of SC. We don't feel we should
have to get SBC's approval for everything."
Thomas said that the cut in the special
events budget would preclude such
planned events as Worthstock, the

fling weekend.

It was the feeling of SBC that $6500 is
more than enough," said SBC member
Gus Alberelli 'OO. "I think SAC does an
excellent job, and even if SC doesn't grant
their appeal, I trust them to use the money
in an effective manner."
"It's very objective," said Josh Bess 'OO,
SBC treasurer. "They [SAC members]
made to the committee a compelling argument for why the $5OOO wasn't enough.
So then somebody said, '56500 makes
more sense'...and [SBC's] opinion is that
this large-scale events committee, if it ac-

tually works, is going to take care of some
of this stuff, and so they thought SAC
wasn't the body students would need to
come to ifthey wanted to throw a Waylon
or a George Clinton or something."
"SC will listen to both sides and make a
prudent decision," said Jared Solomon
'Ol, co-chair of Student Council.
According to Thomas, the $3OOO budgeted for this semester went toward
events such as Singled Out, Twister and
the Mary Lyon Halloween party, and was
also used occasionally on weekends
where there were more parties than
usual.

he submitted his resignation.

members of the council to add
the proposal to the ballot. "This
is a referendum that we are obligated to put before the student
body," he said.
But other members of the
council disagreed. "They're not
initiating a referendum," said
non-voting Social Affairs Committee representative DaveThomas 'O2. "They want to be added
to a Student Council referendum."
Thomas opposed the proposal
on principle, not because of its
substance. "I think the content
is a great idea," he said.
In other business Tuesday
night, the council unanimously
decided against refunding the
booting fees for students who
had parked illegally on campus
earlierthis semester. Refunding
the 11 booting fees of $5O each
would have cost $550.

assistant treasurer Marvin
Barron 'O2 argued strongly
against refunding the fees. "It's
not our money," he said, explaining that it would come from the
student activities accounts. "It's

establish a broad, multi-racial
coalition to address the expanding problem of inequality. Because various racial groups
largely agree on an exceedingly
broad range of social policy issues, Wilson suggested minority
groups should unite to form a
broad, politically powerful minority constituency.
"I am not naive," Wilson continued. He acknowledged that
building such a coalition would
be exceedingly difficultand specifically blamed the media for
highlighting and even inflaming
racial differences, especially
through their coverage of prominent events like the Los Angeles
race riots and the O.J. Simpson
trial.
In spite of this, Wilson cited
socialpsychological research on
interdependence indicating that
when people believe they must
rely on each other, they can effectively unite to build coalitions. Moreover, this effect increases in situations where community groups are able to focus
on issues that are framed in nonracial, nonpartisan terms.
Wilson suggested that in order
to be effective, the new multiracial coalition must focus on
issues that are framed in general

than ever.
rather than racial or partisan
terms to build the broadest base
of support possible.
He discussed affirmative action specifically. By shifting
emphasis away from numerical
quotas for minority groups, a
practice commonly viewed as
unfair, and toward increasing
"procedural fairness" in hiring
practices, the multi-racial coalition could be successful in mobilizing wide public support. In
general, Wilson's argument indicated that by avoiding divisiveness and working to promote
fairness and equality, concepts
that enjoy broad public support,
the coalition could be politically
successful and help to alleviate
the widening inequality in
America.
In the question-and-answer
period following Wilson's remarks, several students expressed strong doubts that such
a coalition could survive today's
bitterly contentious political climate. In answering these con-

thinking and suggested that the
booming economy, and its tendency to decrease racial tensions, would make progress
easier.
After hearing the lecture, Professor of Psychology Andrew
Ward commented that Wilson's
remarks were "terrific." Ward
also agreed with Wilson's social
psychology arguments, citing
his own research on "false polarization" suggesting that people
tend to overestimate the differences between racial groups.
Once these stereotypes are removed, said Wilson, people can
focus on their similarities and
more effectively work together
politically.
Professor of Political Science
Richard Valelly agreed with
Ward in describing the lecture as
"terrific," and added that his
"coalitional analysis was right
on." Valelly also predicted that
Wilson might play a leading role
in shaping policy if Bill Bradley
were elected president, and
hinted that the importance of
Wilson's remarks might not be
fully realized for a matter of
years. "He's certainly trying to
provide the broad intellectual
foundation for a progressive administration," said Valelly.

Bess also oversaw the addition
of several new clubs to the student activities budget and helped
to create a new funding procedure for large events in the wake
oflast semester's "Waylon Experience."
Last year, Bess resolved the
budgeting controversy over a
$3,000 Social Affairs Committeefunded Halloween party. The
party coordinators had asked
Bess for an advance of more
than SAC had approved, withthe
understanding that coordinator
of student activities Davirah
Timm-Dinkins wouldreimburse
the extra amount. Timm-Dinkins
had not approved that beforehand, but she and Bess arranged
to resolve the problem afterward.
And last semester, Bess was
involved in another controversy,
after the Delta Upsilon
fraternity's annual "Margaritaville" party.
Bess initially refused to honor
receipts from the party, which
was busted for underage drinking. He reversed his decision
earlier this semester, absolving
the fraternity of the bill for the
non-event.

"I think I have donea good job,
in terms of making budgeting as
easy as possible, keeping the
campus as informed as possible,
and helping Student Council institute and maintain several
popular programs," he told the
council members Tuesday.
"I would like to leave on that
good note instead of waiting until my effectiveness declines so
much as the result of unhappiness that I reach a breaking
point."

Judiciary Committee candidates' platforms
Patrick Hagan
Hello, my name is Patrick! I'm running for a position on the College Judiciary Committee, which convenes in a circumstance in which, for instance, you
may be in danger of being expelled from Swarthmore
(but only if you were caught doing something bad).
To be honest, I have trouble imagining anybody I've
met here guilty of anything that terrible, but I suppose that is the whole point. I don't indulge in any
idyllic dreams about this place; I'm positive that
Swarthmore is one of the most uniquely friendly and
understanding places on the planet. I grew up in Ridley (right next door to Swarthmore) and have chilled
here since I was a wee lad, before the whole skateboarding thing made even my non-threatening ambulatory visits occasionally uncomfortable. I've met,
during my walks, throngs and herds of Swarthmore
students past and present, and I've loved each one of
them because they've all been super nice to me. I
could not help but to form a deep attachment to this
place and the love I feel surging through it.
As a result, I hold the community of students, staff,
and local children here in the highest esteem, and
take the protection of our environment more seriously
than my 8:30 class, which is nonetheless dear to my
heart. I promise, that, if elected, I will continue to
love Swarthmore as much as I do now and channel
those feelings of love towards a serious preservation
of an open-minded, academically responsible, and
safe environment in which to grow, learn, and skateboard.

My name is Adrienne Fowler, and I hope to be a

mandator/ student fees case

(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON
The Supreme Court
heard debate Tuesday on whether mandatory student
fees at state universities can support student organizations promoting political beliefs.
The case, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin vs. Southworth, stems from a University of Wisconsin-Madison complaint that student fees are used to
promote liberal organizations; and students who do not
support these groups are required to pay nonetheless.
"We really felt the university engaged in unconstitutional policy by forcing students to fund activities of
private student organizations not directly associated
with the university," said Scott Southworth, one of the
three original plaintiffs.
The court is expected to reach a decision sometime
next year. The case could impact state institutions across
the country who use mandatory student fees as a way
of funding student organizations.
The University and its Board of Regents said the mandatory student fees help provide educational experiences for students.
"The basic mission of the university is to provide a
forum for all kinds of ideas," said Katharine Lyall, president of the University of Wisconsin system. "We provide the resources that enable many more viewpoints
to be expressed on campus."
Lower courts have sided with Southworth, saying the
mandatory fee violates students' constitutional rights.
The high court Tuesday challenged the university's
claim that the school is providing both services to student groups and promoting a forum for ideas.
"You could call any speech service to students, helping them learn things," Justice Antonin Scalia said.
But other members of the court, particularly Justice
Stephen Breyer, said minority opinions would not be
represented without distribution of funds in a "viewpoint-neutral" fashion, as the school describes its procedure.
"The first amendment supports the funding of speech
that is unpopular," Breyer said.
"No group was discriminated," said Susan Ullman,
assistant attorney general in Madison, representing the
Board of Regents. "There is no evidence a group was
denied funding for their event."
Other justices argued that utilizing student funds for
partisan means was akin to using the auditorium for the
same purpose, which would not be contested.
"Universities have been places where ideas were debated," Justice Anthony Kennedy said. "You're asking
us to do something against tradition."
Justices were concerned that funds could be used for
directly partisan activities, such as lobbying. Ullman
said all requests for funding go through administrative
checks.

I have no Swarthmore credentials. I believe, however, my qualifications lie within my personality, not
my resume. I am a good listener, wait to place judgement untilI have heard all the facts, and have a knack
for objectivity. I believe that any person brought
before the committee deserves to be treated with fairness. I also believe that Swarthmore should be maintained as an honest, safe community for all its members. A committee member must balance these two
aspects of justice. I want to be on this committee
because I believe I can achieve such a balance, which

Men's center proposal disappointing
Student Council misused referendum process
By Tim Stewart-Winter

SWARTHMORE

For The Phoenix

This week, Student Council offered students the opportunity to vote to convert
Sharpies 111 into a "men's resource center." The proposal was submitted to the
Council after the deadline for Sharpies
111 renovation proposals had passed.
However, the students making the proposal apparently got 10% of the student
body that's about 140 ofyou, by my count
to sign a petition, using the referendum
clause of the SC Constitution to ask that
the late proposal be added to the slate of
proposals on the ballot.
There are three reasons why this process was troubling. First, Student Council made a special exception to allow this
late proposal onto the ballot, without consulting students through its Constitutional
referendum process. Second, the actual
proposal is offensive; it would not empower men, but rather would reinforce
the demands of dominant ideals of masculinity. Third, it is clearly made in a
spirit of resentment over the "special
treatment" that women and racial/sexual
minorities supposedly receive on this
campus. I will address these three problems in sequence.
1. According to the referendum clause
of the SC Constitution, "A petition with a
number of signatures equal to ten percent
of the studentbody is required to initiate
a referendum." Student Council members, after some discussion, decided that
this provision required them to add this
late proposal to the ballot.
In this case, the students' petition simply stated, rather vaguely, that they supported the proposal for a men's resource
center. Given that the slate of proposals
had already been established, Council interpreted (rightly) that the intention of
the petitioners was to add the MRC to the
slate of proposals that had already been
established and published in The Phoenix. Thus, by my understanding, the petitioners had met the requirements to initiate a referendum; the Constitution requires that SC then put to the student body
the question of whether the late proposal
-

-

The MRC proposal is not about
supporting men, but rather
about policing the boundaries of
traditional masculinity, just as
fraternities that exclude women
have done throughout the
history of higher education.
should be added to the slate of Sharpies
111 proposals. The student body would
then get to decide on the petitioners' request.
Instead, theCouncil voted to circumvent
the democratic referendum process, and
add the "men's resource center" to the
ballot without consulting students. An SC
member told me that therationale for this
unusual interpretation of the referendum
clause was as follows: "Presumably, people
who would vote to add the MRC to the ballot would also vote for it on the ballot and
people who would vote against adding it
would simply vote against it."
In other words, Council allowed their
own guesses as to how students would
vote in a campus-wide referendum to substitute for actual votes. What democratic
system could countenance this kind of
referendum by presumption? No doubt
the same one that spent $6OOO of student
activities fees on pinball machines that
93 percent of students later said they
wouldrather see spent on something else.
2. I'm certainly in favor of Swarthmore
offering programs to help meet the particular needs of male students, who are
emerging into a world full of conflicting
expectations. However, I'd like to point
out that, based on the resources listed in
this proposal, the "men's resource center"
would serve not to support students in
developing their own complicated range
of responses to dominant ideals of masculinity, but rather to reinforce those oppressive demands. It is, thus, not at all
some sort of analogous or parallel insti-

tution to the WRC.
The proposal features video games and
electronic equipment, a dart board, movie
nights featuring "Rocky" and "Indiana
Jones," and regular Monday night football. In addition, there wouldbe a "sexile"
room for those male students whose
roommates kick them out for the night.
In the meeting to discuss the Sharpies 111
proposals, an advocate for the "men's resource center" joked (at least I hope it was
a joke) that the sexile room would only
apply to heterosexual sex, as sex between
men would somehow fall under the IC's
purview.
The center would offer workshops on
"things guys need to know in the real
world" like car repair and woodworking.
In effect, the proposal reproduced our
culture's usual discourses about what constitutes a man discourses that always
operate by exclusion of those who don't
measure up. The MRC proposal is not
about supporting men, but rather about
policing the boundaries of traditional
masculinity, just as fraternities that exclude women have done throughout the
history of higher education.
3. The proposal stated that its purpose
was to "correct" the notion that resources for men are often overlooked
because of Swarthmore's "focus" on
"minority clubs and support groups."
Thus, it was made in a spirit of resentment over the special treatment that
women and racial and sexual minorities
supposedly receive on this campus. That
140 students would sign a petition in this
spirit is disturbing to me; the logic behind it is the same logic that's being used
in efforts to dismantle affirmative action
at public institutiohs all over the country. The fact that 10 percent of the students endorse such logic even at this
supposedly most progressive of schools
makes me want to give up the fight for
equality and justice. I feel that my fellow students have let me down.
There can be no doubt that in this case,
Student Council afforded special treatment to a proposal made by male students
with an agenda contrary to the Council's
and the College's inclusive vision.

Prostitution and drugs: judge with consistency
SIMON KAUFMAN

sil

SBjk

I think students at Swarthmore are too

hard on people who visit prostitutes (yes,

you heard me right). I am not defending
myself here and I am not saying that I
think prostitution is particularly positive
for any party involved. However, I do
think that given students' general attitude
toward society, their attitudes toward
people who visit prostitutes are contradictory.
In particular, I think students are hard
on people who visit prostitutes, but easy
on prostitutes, while being easy on people
who use drugs, but hard on drug dealers.
Of course, prostitution and drug use are
not identical, but there are numerous
similarities stemming from the fact that
both are considered criminal activities
that people are, to some extent, addicted

But at the same time some students
hold this view, they berate drug dealers
for harming society. Drug dealers are not
forcing drugs on anyone. Rather, they are
providing a service. Many of them probably feel like they have no other choices
in life and it's not as if they are actively
injuring anyone by engaging in a life of
violent crime. Further, outlawing the sale
of drugs increases the price of drugs, virtually necessitating a life of crime for
low-income drug users.
Some might argue that drug dealers
deserve more blame because they are
injuring others, whether it's directly or
indirectly. That's certainly true in many
cases. Drug addiction has ruined countless lives, and I do not mean to make light
of that fact. However, people who visit
prostitutes are injured as well, admittedly
to a lesser extent, by engaging in an act
not accepted by society. People consider
sex with a prostitute either a morally reprehensible act or the act of a loser who
cannot get sex any other way.
If someone thinks paying for a prostitute is morally reprehensible, I cannot
understand why being a prostitute is accepted. Surely selling a morally reprehensible product is no better than using it. In

In particular, I think students are
hard on people who visit
prostitutes, but easy on
prostitutes, while being easy on
people who use drugs, but hard
on drug dealers.
fact, in the case of drug sales people take
the opposite view. Also, if someone cannot get sex without paying for it, why look

down on him? I feel sorry for the person,
and think that most people feel sorry for
others in similar situations who are
forced to compensate for something that
comes naturally to others. For example,
I am sure that medicinal use of marijuana
is widely accepted at Swarthmore as a
reasonable alternative to living with pain.
I don't know whether students should
be harder on prostitutes, or easier on drug
dealers, or harder on drug users and
easier on people that visit prostitutes. I
do think that ideas about judging what is
right and what is wrong should be internally consistent when it comes to sex,
drugs or anything else, though.

to.

Most of the students at Swat seem to

think thatprostitutes are given a bad rap.

I can understand this. I'm sure a lot of
prostitutes have their jobs because they
don't feel like society has left them with
any other options. Besides, it is a woman's
right to choose what she does with her
body, and what place does society have
to tell her whether she can or cannot
charge money for sex? In a way, outlawing prostitution criminalizes sex, and contributes to the view of sexual activity as
morally wrong.

Walking through the Ville today it felt
as though I could have been passing
through any number of those economically anemic towns that you see along the
R3 coming back from Philadelphia to
Swarthmore. Like consumptive women
in a Victorian novel, these towns
Landsdowne, Gladstone, Primos are
slowly dying, being bled of their commerce.
There is a trend ofbusiness leaving the
Delaware County area and moving towards PlymouthLanding developers are
expanding into new undeveloped sprawls,
and old suburbs are being left by the wayside. Unless the Ville is resuscitated and
revitalized now, Swarthmore might become the next Landsdowne.
The town Task Force, comprised of 16

members, including our own Maurice
Eldridge, Vice President for College and
Community Relations and Assistant to the
President, intends to accomplish just this.
To achieve this end, they have compiled,
with the help of the developers Urban
Partners, a 34-point Swarthmore Town
Center Revitalization Strategy. The report outlines, in broad terms, how the
town, with or without some help from the
College, can pump life back into the Ville.
What is missing from this report is how
the Task Force intends to refocus their
consumer base and cater more to us; we
are, after all, 1,400students who live five
minutes away and who seem to avoid the
town like the plague, and with good reason. The Task Force and the Borough
Council need to more actively recruit
businesses that can better target
Swarthmore students as their customer
base. SC recently instituted the highly
popular Genuardi's shuttle, and students
are happily turning their backs on the Coop, which carries less merchandise and
closes earlier. If the Co-op cannot retain
our business, then certainly none of the
other stores in the Ville can do so.
We as students need to express to the
Borough Council how exactly we want the
town to be revitalized. The Ville and the
students will both benefit if stores begin
carrying merchandise that students will
want to buy. T. Bumbles, Finlandia, The
Studio at Swarthmore
all of these are
charming stores, but not only do they not
market themselves well with good promotional packages or gifts to entice students at the beginning of the school year,
they do not carry a sufficient number of
goods that Swarthmore College students
want to buy.
I have a wish list of the types of stores
I would like to see in the Ville that aren't
articulated in the Task Force Report
an athletic goods store, a Brueger's-type
bagel shop, a larger pharmacy, a health
foods store.
We need not make Swarthmore into a
mini Princeton, although I find that idea
delightful. The Borough Council, from
what I understand through the Task Force
report, wants to maintain the small-town
character of Swarthmore. So be it —if
the Borough Council is opposed to chain
stores like Starbucks and CVS, they
should at least try to cater to student
needs.
The fireside chat with Larry Schall,
Vice President for Facilities and Services,
and Maurice Eldridge held last week was
a convenient opportunity for students to
give the College their wish lists, which
should then be conveyed to the Borough
Council. Just tell the Borough Council
what you want
if you ask for it, they
just might build it.

Josh Bess

It is not our custom to write in praise of individuals, but on a campus where
complaints of students' apathy run rampant, Josh Bess is a refreshing change.
This is why it is bittersweet to see Bess step down from his position as
Student Budget Committee treasurer. For three years Bess has been SBC
treasurer and assistant treasurer. No
he has not merely been SBC treasurer,
he (along with his predecessor Vincent Jones) has redefined therole ofStudent
Budget Committee and the treasurer position.
Under Bess's direction Student Budget Committee has become more
professional, less politicized and more streamlined. The treasurer, once merely
some guy who handed out money to students, is now Swarthmore's equivalent
ofAlan Greenspan an economic trendsetter and someone who determines
the philosophy behind how we spend our dollars.
This is not something that just happened. Bess has taken care to implement
these changes slowly and methodically so as not to shock the student body into
an economic stupor. And what's more, each change has been made with a
semblance of grace, something rarely seen at Swarthmore, where sublety and
continuity come together slightly more than never.
Let's face it SBC treasurer is not a position students are clamoring to hold.
It requires long weeks, incredible patience and a fuse long enough not to erupt
when the Russian Club comes in with receipts for beets. It is the highest paid
job on campus for a reason, and Bess earns every cent of it and far more.
Call him a bureaucrat if you like, but Bess is the finest bureacrat we know.
He has been fair and rational throughout his time as treasurer, and he does his
job without complaining. He's efficient in his own duties, and he's made
Student Budget Committee more efficient.
Even in resignation Bess has acted with class. He had legitimate reasons to
resign and has given the student body advance notice, leaving Student Budget
Committee sufficient time to find a worthy successor. We only hope his
successor truly will be worthy.
So, Josh thanks for showing us what it means to be dedicated. Have a fun
spring semester.

Speech not free anymore
If the United States Supreme Court sides with previous rulings, student
groups across the country could have to scramble for funding.
Plaintiffs at the University of Wisconsin sued the school because they
objected to their mandatory student fees being used to support groups they
did not. Specifically, they objected to 18 liberal organizations, including the
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Campus Center, UW Greens and the International
Socialist Organization.
The court heard arguments on Tuesday from both sides in the case. A decision
is not expected until next year, but if the court rules in the plaintiffs' favor, it
would set a precedent for state schools everywhere a bad precedent.
Allowing people to opt out of public funding for things with which they do
not agree is absurd. The students do have due process for eliminating the
funding
they can either choose not to attend the university or they can
exercise their right in the university's biannual election to vote against the
funding for those groups.
If the court ruled that the university did have to allow the students to
fund only the groups they chose, it would open the floodgates to a host of
unrelated problems. Although Swarthmore, as a private institution, would
probably not be affected by an unfavorable ruling, the situation at the
University of Wisconsin would be akin to some students who do not attend
parties refusing to fund the Social Affairs Committee, those who do not
listen to the radio refusing to fund WSRN and those who do not read student
publications refusing to fund them. It could also lead to students making
absurd requests in the pages of The Phoenix, demanding that the Student
Budget Committee treasurer buy them personal golf carts.
The plaintiffs at the university are supporting their argument with theFirst
Amendment contention that speech is free. But in this modern world with high
costs for mass communications, speech is decidedly not free. It costs money.
This is why the university wants to distribute money collected from all
students among groups with many opinions. Rather than limiting speech,
this process protects speech from groups who might not otherwise be
heard. Apparently the plaintiffs do not take issue with speech from other
groups on campus
presumably the more conservative ones. Withdrawing
funding from groups with which they disagree is a political move, while
choosing to spend money in what the university officials say is a "viewpoint-neutral," nondiscriminatory fashion is political.
It is also indefensible pedagogically. At institutions of higher learning,
which exist to allow debate and discussion of ideas, it is inconceivable that
students themselves would seek to limit them. Maybe the plaintiffs seek to
limit others' speech because they realize that their own ideas are being
judged inferior. Censorship, in this case through financial starvation, has
always been the last resort of those with weak ideas.

Base threatens Puerto Rico
To the Editor:
I am writing in response to an opinion ("U.S.
military poses no threat to Puerto Rico," Nov.
5, pg. 5) which spoke about the situation concerning the naval base in Vieques, a small island that is part of Puerto Rico. The writer of
the opinion presented in this article seems to
be misinformed on a few points and I would
like to set the record straight.
First of all, the naval base located on
Vieques is much larger than the one thousand
acres which was stated in the article. In fact,
it actually takes up seventy-five percent of
the island, or twenty-seven thousand miles.
This means that the inhabitants of Vieques
are crowded together on a six-mile strip of
the island. As for the strategic importance
of the base, a sworn statement by retired Vice
Adm. John J. Shanahan, a consultant to the
government ofPuerto Rico, all but collapsed
the Navy's insistence that Vieques offers a
critical and unique place for practicing amphibious landings. The Marine Corps doesn't
do amphibious landings anymore and hasn't
since Inchon in Korea.
Also, contrary to what was stated in the
article, the naval base does in fact endanger
the lives of the inhabitants of Vieques, as well
as destroys much of the wildlife. Navy officials admit to the fact that the Navy uses ra-

diation-dangerous bullets made from depleted uranium in maneuvers. According to
environmentalist Jorge Fernandez Porto, a
particle that is one quarter the diameter of a
human hair emits eight hundred times the
amount ofradiation that can be tolerated during an entire lifetime. Each shell fired by the
army over Vieques contains a thirdof a pound
of depleted uranium. This most likely accounts for the cancer rate in Vieques, which
is much higher than anywhere else in Puerto
Rico. Also, when a suggestion was made to
move the base to Florida, the naval commandant, Mark McDonald, responded that any
land area for maneuvers in Florida would
endanger human populations. So it is dangerous in Florida, but not Vieques. Why is that?
The naval base in Vieques should be removed. There is no strategic advantage in it,
some people have already been killed and
injured, and the numbers will continue to rise.
Whetherthe deaths are directly related to the
base, as with the naval employee who was a
civilian, and the four other injuries, or indirectly, like the deaths due to cancer, they are
still the fault of the naval base. Their irresponsibility has poisoned every man, woman
and child on Vieques and needs to be stopped.

Gangster, Compton labels wrong
To the Editor:
I found Jenny Yang's recent column on pop
music ("Pop music aids cultural, family bonding for immigrant," Nov. 5, pg. 7) to be a good
read. It does, however, contain some factual
errors.
Despite their scary name, Public Enemy
was not a part of the "gangster rap" genre,
let alone its "hardcore" strain, as Ms. Yang
seems to imply. Revolutionary yes, perhaps
even militant. But PE's unflagging positivism and refusal to see themselves as the products, as opposed to the masters of the social
conditions into which they were born kept
them from being labeled "gangsters" by all
but the most reactionary media organs.
Second, A Tribe Called Quest, whose "I left
my wallet in El Segundo" track Ms. Yang calls
"Compton-style," do not reside in Compton,
or California, or even on the West Coast.
They're from Queens. Almost all early 1990s
Compton rap or hip-hop music is, in part, an

imperfect copy of the Native Tongues sound

One of those wonderful facts I was

greeted with last week was that
McDonald's had just celebrated opening

its 8000th establishment... in Germany. I
don't mind saying this scares me, and not
because I'm particularly worried about
Burger King's sales. No, what I'm worried about is the phenomenon that the
political science brethren like to call
"McWorld": global homogenization under
the fjag and the culture of the United
States of America.
Is that really that bad? Frankly, yes.
Why? Because the most valuableaspects
of America the ones I personally chercannot be exported. One
ish the most
of the major ones I can think of is this
college. Swarthmore is a college deeply
rooted in American traditions (putting
aside for a minute the more fringe Quaker
strain) that lead to a real sense of social
responsibility and intellectual rigor. We
do have a tradition of being detractors
from the government: there was a point
in the 1960s when close to half of the male
population was in jail from protesting
Vietnam or economic slavery. We've been

Our World vs. McWorld
called the "Kremlin on the Crum" by
everyone's favorite Vice President, Spiro
Agnew, for precisely what made us different from the Soviet Union: for all our
leftism, we were demonstrating our
rights and responsibilities for non-violent
opposition to undemocratic government
practices.
This is not what the United States exports, simply because it can't. What it can
export, and does through American foreign and trade policy, is McWorld: a soulless, consumerist, dog-eat-dogphilosophy
that represents absolutely the worst that
American culture has to offer. And that
destroys the equivalent of the
Swarthmores in other countries: those
indigenous institutions that are responsible for countering materialism and
alienating individualism. I'm not talking
about anything radical here, just
churches, mosques, hospitals, schools,
social security, labor unions, youth groups
all of which are feeling like they are
under the axe in the name of neo-liberalism. There is something scary about the
assumption in economics that something
only has value if a price or cost isascribed
to it. While McWorld is not the fault of
the economists, it is the intense preoccupation on resource allocation and thus
resource hoarding that leads to a slow
moral death.

far from universal in their successful
applicability. In fact, I don't think they are
suited to America itself either, and I feel
that America is being hurt by a monster
of its own creation. McWorld is breeding
a culture of indifference all over the
globe, but this is especially true in the U.S.
Everyone's becoming far too preoccupied
with winning the pole position in the rat
race to worry about therules of the game.
When was the last time you heard anyone saying "I'm genuinely afraid of the
state of modern society" outside of Trotter or Papazian? When did we stop havingphilosophers out there, not just in here
in the academy?
In some senses, I think that is one of
the central problems in American foreign
policy. When did we stop caring enough
to discuss sanctions on Iraq or the abuses
of the School of the Americas? When did
we cede all moral authority to people only
marginally more knowledgeable than ourselves and probably a lot less concerned?
When did we last give a shit?
I feel it is our responsibility to care,
because we have to create the spiritual
impetus to counter McWorld. Don't let the
bastards get us down.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

tioning the importance and legitimacy of

the safe space that the Women's Resource
Center provides for women on campus.
Saying men need a space in the same way
women do ignores a long history of sexism, marginalization, and silencing that
women have faced in academia and the
greater world. This proposal is mocking
women's efforts to organize and support
each other in a world that is often intolerant of their views and perspective.
Second, the men proposing this use of
space blatantly ignore their own privilege
and power here at Swarthmore and in the
world. As a friend remarked, "The world
is the men's resource center." If Swarthmore espouses building community and
working toward the equity of all groups,
giving a dominant group an exclusive
space would be a step in the wrong direction.

Finally, in response to this group's blind
claim that somehow male interests are being underfundedbecause of the needs of
the many minority and support groups on
campus, I would point out the $6,000 Student Council invested in pinball machines
this semester, or the $3,000 SAC allotted
to DU for the Halloween party last fall.
My anger at this proposal is not about
the need for a space to watch football or
play Nintendo. I do think students need
more space and entertainment on campus. What angers me is the insolent and
ignorant tone this group took toward the
College's marginalized communities.
These men need to get over themselves
and start thinking about what their proposal implies about who they are and what
they believe. What's next? The White Cultural Center?

Students' enthusiasm goes far with Soly Canto
To the Editor:
I wanted to share an aspect of performance at Swarthmore that we rarely see:
the performers' reactions to Swarthmore.
The Latin ensemble Sol y Canto justfinished an extraordinary residency at Swarthmore. A residency was relatively new
to them and they were somewhat uncertain about how to interact with students
outside the performance venue. They
started with a coffeehouse at the Intercultural Center. The Sol y Canto trio was
to play a set with some students joining
in on some pieces, and the Swarthmore
Latin band Los Cueros was to do a few of
their numbers. The IC was packed, the
trio immediately warmed to the audience
and the songs with student musicians joining the band went well. Then Los Cueros
blew us away with four powerful arrangements which brought everyone to their
feetfor dancing. The Sol y Canto trio was
impressed at the level of professionalism
of Los Cueros and invited not one or two
students join themfor the second set. but
they invited the whole band to join. The
evening ended with a spontaneous jam
session with both bands together. Afterwards Rosi and Brian Amador, Sol y
Canto's musical directors, told me they
had never done anything like this before
at any of the many colleges and universities they have visited in 15 years. They

A TV in my
room, a TV
in my head
I address you today, loyal readers, with
a heavy heart. Deep within my chest I feel
a great sadness for you, and, alas, for me,
as well. This is because, though I am
ashamed to admit it, I am at a complete
and total loss for ideas. And for this, I
would like to blame TV.
This year I got a TV in my room, and,
upon further review, I think it was a bad
idea. Yes, the warm, comforting glow of
the picture tube is some solace on those
cold suburban nights, where it seems not
so much like you're the only person in the
world but that no one would care even if
you were. And yes, without it I would miss

The world is a men's resource center
To the Editor:
The proposal for the Men's Resource
Center in Sharpies 111 is not just about
having a space for men on campus, it's
an open attack on the college
community's work to make Swarthmore
a place for everyone, where everyone is
supported and feels safe. Specifically,
the proposers wrote: "With much of the
focus on minority clubs and support
groups at Swat many times funding and
support for males is overlooked in favor
of a more Politically Correct cause. We
hope to correct that." In citing this reason as support for their proposal, they
made their claim for resources not just
about having a fun space for guys, but
an attack on all marginalized groups at
Swarthmore.
First, by calling their space the "Men's
Resource Center," they are directly ques-

After an intermission that resembled a
fiesta, something extraordinary happened. As Rosi Amador, the lead singer,
told me, "Some students stood up and
started dancing at their seats. I was so
scared that others would make them sit
down, but they didn't. I motioned them to
come down and dance in front of the stage
and all of a sudden people were coming
from everywhere in the hall to dance. Not
all these students were Latinos, I could
tellby their dancing, but their excitement
just took hold of us." During a few extra
choruses of that piece the band communicated by gestures and decided to change
the program on the spot to allow another
dance number. About 150 people were up
dancing by this point. As Rosi told me,
"At this point we did not know what to do.
We have often had audiences get up and
dance; the hard thing is to get them to sit
down afterwards! Here they not only sat
down right away for our quiet numbers

but they were silent, they listened to us."
One of these pieces, La Tonada del Luna,
a trio with guitar, was stunning as the
complex harmonies of three voices echoed around the huge theater space pulsing with emotion. For the rest of the
evening, performers and audience responded to each other with more and
more enthusiasm. I remember looking
back at the hall from the stage apron and
seeing people dancing in the balconies,
the isles and the level areas all around the
theater. Afterwards the performers sat
around in Ashton House winding down
and agreed it was one of those memorable
performances where they really connected with the audience. As they all left
Sunday morning for their next performance Rosi said to me "You know, Tim, I
want to try more residencies, this was
really great."

the periodic and violent idiocy that is the
local FOX news, but is that enough to justify the damage this quaint, unassuming,
yet deadly box has caused?
Just today, I couldn't think of anything
to write about. What did I do? Watch TV
(that'll help). Yes, becoming more passive
was definitely the solution to my problem. Thinking less should short-circuit
that creativity problem I was having.
Once, I even started to watch Ally Mcßeal
before the internal height/weight gauge
in my head hurt so much by trying to figure out the absolute minimum that girl
could weigh without her skeletal structure collapsing under her.
The other thing is that I don't even have
a VCR, so if I want to watch something, I
better be there. It's controlling my life.
My entire week is scheduled around the
WB on Wednesdays and FOX on Sundays.
I have to figure out how much I have to

I stop watching? Of course not. I'm more
concerned with a bunch of 24 year-olds
with $lO,OOO-dollar dental work and more
revealing clothing than a Victoria Secrets
pajama party.
And Chris Carter isn't much better. I
still understand what's going on in his
head about as well as a hyperactive gerbil in a speed lab. You need a fricking
primer just to watch the show. Who was
that guy Mulder asked for last week, with
the silly Ghostbusters ESP experiment?
I'm hoping it all turns out to be a dream
like that season of "Dallas." I will rest
much more easily then. Plus, I've always
looked at it this way
if what the "X~
Files" says is going on was really going
on, would they (the big, conspiratorial
they) let it be on network TV? No, FOX
still counts.
Then they tease me. I try to go to bed,
but they put News Radio reruns on at
midnight. The most underrated show on
television right before I could or could
not go to sleep. It's too much to resist,
people. I'm not made of stone.
I think I'm one of the lucky ones. Only
two required hours of TV a week. I know
people who eat lunch at a certain time so
they don't miss "The Simpsons." Perhaps
TV is our one release—a place wherethe
radical politics and the multitude of neon

Maybe I will give Ally one more shot.

The downtime was also an opportunity to brace herself for the battle
that lay ahead. "I had nine months of no symptoms outside of the blood
pressure where I sort of psychologically prepared myself for whatever
was to come," she recalls.
Despite all the groundwork, Laurie would lapse into bouts of depression from time to time, especially when her physical condition slipped.
Her mood would fluctuate according to her health status. And there was
nothing that anyone could do about it, not even Bob.
"I wasn't even allowed to try," says Bob, only half-jokingly, much to the
amusement of his wife. "She would just get out of it when she got better."
Laurie's pessimism stood in stark contrast to Bob's uncompromising
optimism. From the very get-go, Bob was hopeful. "I always was saying
when we first talked to the doctors in 1985:'transplants are getting better
and better, the success rates better and better,'" says Bob. "And I was just
thinking, if it was better in 1985 than in 1975, who knows what it will be
like in 1995 or the year 2000?"
"And sure enough," he says, "the techniques and medications have just
improved every year."
When Laurie gingerly recounts Bob's brief stint in the Intensive Care
Unit (ICU) after the transplant—he was constantly coughing up his breathing tube and doctors were concerned that he might lose an airway Bob
was quick to dismiss the whole incident. "It was potentially dangerous,"
he says matter-of-factly, with an emphasis on "potentially," "but since they
were intensive in their care, everything was okay."

Fortunately,

Laurie's pre-operation depression never became
chronic. She eventuallymanaged to "snap out of it," in large part
due to an enlightening weekend at a cousin's house on Long Island. The cousin's mother, Laurie's aunt, had been run down by a car several years ago and had spent a full month in ICU. Her cousin herself had
suffered a debilitating leg injury that never fully healed. Laurie's problems paled in comparison.
"I thought, what do I have to complain about?" she recalls, "Look at me,
I'm running around."
She resolved to "appreciate what I've got." But despite all the progress
she was making, her doubts lingered. It took a painstaking, step-by-step
process to move her in the right direction.
First, she had to venture beyond her mother's shadow, a crucial step.
"It took me a long time to move beyond the mindframe of 'dialysis and
death awaits me' to
'transplant awaits me,'" she recalls. Then, with the help of a friend, bit
by bit, she began to contemplate life after the transplant.
Today, the days of struggle are a thing of the past. Laurie is in the best
shape she has ever been in, and expects things to go only up from here.
The overriding mood in their household is celebratory, yet reflective. Both
Bob and Laurie are still slowly coming to emotional terms with this episode of their lives.
For one thing, the mobilization of support around the family has been
simply overwhelming. A group of 17 neighbors signed up to cook 34 meals
for the family after the surgery. On the day of the surgery, the History
Department was inundated with well over 100 e-mails inquiring about the
couple's situation. Bob and Laurie have found themselves resorting to a
mass newsletter because of the sheer size of their mailing list, which includes around 90 people right now. "There are 90 people all over the world
who really care about what happens to Bob and I," a misty-eyed Laurie
reflects in disbelief. "It makes me feel really happy."
Some friends and family dropped whatever they were doing to spend
time with the two. A good friend from California, mother of three and Director of Elementary Education in Palo Alto, flew in for the weekend after
the surgery. Bob, who tried to keep the surgery under wraps, was "flabbergasted" to receive cards from concerned people that he barely knew.
"The outpouring of love and support from our friends has simply been
unbelievable," Laurie says.
Even though the surgery went smoothly and both she and Bob emerged

finds Bob's gift a little hard to swallow.
"It's a hard sacrifice to accept from someone," she says. "I tell myself I
would do the same thing but there's a differencebetween telling yourself
about it and actually going through with it."
An exchange with a friend helped somewhat to dispel her qualms. Bruce
Grant, a colleague in the Sociology/Anthropology Department, had volunteered to get tested when he learned ofLaurie's need for a transplant. He
•encouraged her to accept Bob's generosity wholeheartedly. "This is the
one thing that Bob can do to make you better," he said. "Give Bob that
chance."
In retrospect, it made total sense to Laurie. "He is the one who has to
deal with the sick me, watch me helpless, watch me in pain, watch me
anxious, watch me feel tired," she says, "but how can he help, what can he
do to make me feel better?"
"This is the one thing he can do," she says, close to tears.
Bob agrees with their friend on an intellectual level but is still stubbornly modest. "Bruce's take on it certainly makes sense," he acknowledges, but insists, "I didn't really consider it a sacrifice."
Eventually he grudgingly indulges in a bit of self-flattery. "I get a lot of
points," he conceded, "but I think I'd get a lot more points if I was really
cut up in the hospital."

"He is the one who has to
deal with the sick me,
watch me helpless, watch
me in pain, watch me
anxious, watch me feel
tired," Laurie says,"but how
can he help, what can he do
to make me feel better?'

can do," she says, close to

Tibetan exhibits incorporate history, religion, art
By Gabe Hankins
Phoenix Staff

*

Swarthmore College is hosting two special exhibitions on Tibetan art and culture this month, "The Mystical Arts of
Tibet" at the List Gallery and "The Tibetan Book of the Dead" in McCabe Library. In conjunction with the exhibits are
a number of lectures, most notably the
one on Monday, Nov. 15, when Professor
Daniel Cozort of Dickinson College will
explore "How To Have A Good Death."
There are three main components in
this exhibit, all of which are interrelated
and none of which is easily separated
from the others. The first area is history.
The objects on display here are sacred
religious works carried out by the refugee monks of Tibet as they fled the Chinese invasion which destroyed their
temples; some objects are from the personal collection of the present Dalai
Lama. The sacred paintings, clothing,
sculptures, and other objects are on a
five-year tour of the country supporting
the exiled Drepung Loseling Monastery
in India and Atlanta.
The second subject is religion. These
objects contain holiness in the way that
saints' relics are holy, physically as opposed to the more figurative tradition of
Western religious art. As Valrae
Reynolds, the first lecturer in the series,
made clear in her talk, Tibetan Buddhism
has a very physical sense of sacredness,
to the extent that the mountain on which
Llahsa is placed is considered to be the
left breast of a demon ogress magically
pinned in place.
The third subject matter in this exhibit
is art. Art is a religious tool and a religious activity here, and though the beautiful thangka (cloth paintings) from the
last three centuries show interesting
changes in composition, chromatic arrangement, and perspective comparable
to Western painting, these factors are always secondary to the religious nature of
the piece. As Art History Professor
Marybeth Graybill writes, "In Tibetan
Buddhism, the most profound truths are
held to be beyond verbal expression."
These artistic works are meant as aids to
enlightenment beyond any aesthetic appreciation.
On the most basic visual level, these
works are sometimes shockingly violent
and lustful. The conqueror of death,
Vajrabhairava, is awesomely figured in
the form of Death, as a wrathfulblue bulldemonframed by flames and wearing the
skin of an elephant. One female Buddha
has flayed her own son for unbeliefand
used the skin as a saddle; another painting shows the graphic multi-limbed mat-

ing of the female avatar of Wisdom and
the male avatar of Compassion.
"What's so interesting here is that imagery that would be frightening in other
traditions lust, anger, hate— is substantively transformed into prayerful or purifying forms," Graybill said. In this figuration evil must be fought with the guise
of evil.
For further information about the exhibits please the Art Department's web
—

page on the exhibit at <http://
www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/art/
Gallery/lgcurrent.html>.
Professor Graybill's students in the
"Approaches to Tibet" class will be conducting gallery tours especially for fellow students at times outsideregular gallery hours. Student guides will speak for
about half an hour, and be on hand to answer questions for another half hour. No
reservations are necessary; just come to

'Girls' Guide' a long, gossipy conversation with your best friend
Unlike 'Bridget Jones/dysfunctionality not fashionable in 'Girls Guide'

By Samira Mehta
Phoenix Staff
This summer I read both "The Bridget
Jones Diary" and "A Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing."
Judging from the relative amounts of
noise both books made when they hit the
street, I may be the only person in the
world
or at least in New York City
who liked "A Girls' Guide to Hunting and
Fishing" more than "The Bridget Jones
Diary."
"A Girls' Guide" is written in the first
person as a string of remembrances in
chronological order over a nebulous period of time, ranging from adolescence
to somewhere in the late twenties to mid
thirties. Jane, the heroine, begins with

MARK LOTTO

si %£

vacation

stories about being a teenager at her
family's summer beach house, sharing a
room with the girlfriend her brother
brought home and watching her sneak
into his room at night.
As an editor in New York, she takes you
through the men in her life: Jamie, who
takes her on vacation to visit an ex-girlfriend, and her French lover, Archie, an
alcoholic old enough to be her father, who
corrects her grammar in an attempt to
"make her better."
In the final and perhaps funniest section of this adventure, Jane buys herself
a self-help book on how to catch a man,
and the authors sit like little cheerleading
devils on her shoulder, giving her advice
on how to catch a man by not being herself.
I really enjoyed "The Girls' Guide to
Hunting and Fishing." It was fun, it was
light, it was about being young in New
York. The author, Melissa Banks, herself
a young woman living alone in New York,
has managed to create a fun and interesting picture of the life of a young,
single, free-spirited career woman who,
perhaps because she's read too many issues of Cosmo, still feels a tad like a failure.
The book dealt with the modern dissatisfaction with life without depressing me

BOOK REVIEW

as I read it. It had good lines like, "No
wonder I'm single. Even I don't want to
get intobed with these thighs," and morechic-than-thou lesbians with names like

Appolinnaire.
"The Girls' Guide," in short, is brain
candy. It is girly summer reading for the
beach; it is escapist reading for the train
ride home after finals. (I myself read it
drunk on a commuter train out of New
York on a Friday afternoon.) It is a bit
weak on characterization because it is
told strictly from the main character's
point of view.
No one else gets a chance to explain
much motivation, so manycharacters end
up lacking depth, which could be a good
or bad thing.
Reading "The Girls' Guide" is like a
long, gossipy conversation
you don't
hear anyone's voice but that of your
friend, but because she is your friend, you
don't really care.
Unlike "The Bridget Jones Diary,"
which treats dysfunctionality as something fashionable, for all "The Girls'
Guide's" flippancy it never comes across
as anti-feminist. Jane does foolish things
for and because of men, but she is aware
of it and clearly doesn't approve of her

own behavior, making her more familiar

to those of us who derive guilty pleasure

from reading women's magazines. This
is another one of those books that might
not be worth paying for in the hardcover
edition, but by all means, buy it in paperback.

Countless hours of practice and
repetition are over, and the ensembles are ready to perform
for the Swarthmore community.
The fall series will include performances that will explore a
variety of genres, including jazz,
choral and orchestral music.
The Swarthmore College Wind
Ensemble will perform under
the direction ofMichael Johns in
Lang Concert Hall today at 8
p.m.
The program will include
works by Bach, Wagner, Dello
Joio and Messiaen and will include a renditionof the hallmark
composition, "Et exspecto
resurrectionem mortuorum," a
piece commissioned to commemorate the costs of war.
"We are excited to be presenting this major work," said Johns.
"It should be a memorable
event."
The performance will include
a number of student solos and
will feature an exotic range of
percussion uses.
The College Jazz Ensemble
will take their turn with a performance under the direction of
music professor John Alston on
Saturday, Nov. 13, at 8 p.m. The
concert promises to be fun and
creative while staying true to its
blues heritage. Highlights of the
concert will include the playing
of a jazz piano duet.
"The concert promises to be
swinging," said trumpet player
Kevin Schlotmann 'OO.
The Swarthmore College
Early Music Ensemble will serenade you as they perform
scores under the directionof Richard Stone in Lang Performance Center on Sunday, Nov.
14,at 7:30 p.m. Scheduled for the

Handel's "Tre la fiamme" will

"Ire la fiamme" will feature
soloist Laurie Helmes, who will
be accompanied by the Chamber
Orchestra. "Tre la fiamme" retells the myth of Icarus, who as
a mortal flies and realizes all too
late the limitations of being human.
"Very rarely do we hear a period orchestra play an early,

Spider was once a famous journalist
who made a name for himself covering

Orchestra 2001 will perform

Freeman in Lang Concert Hall at
3 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 20. The
concert will include Stott Fund
recipient Nicholas Brooke's new
composition "Double," which
features the pairing of musical
instruments and Balinese influences to create music and ambiance reminiscent of the past century.
In its inaugural year, the Stott

promising composers and is believed to be the first known
scholarship of its kind in the nation.
The Orchestra 2001 will also

Futuristic 'Transmet' humanizes chaos

how much fun hating everything really
is and he starts to throw himself into
crazy babblings once again.
"Transmetropolitan" is a shocking
book, a little extravagant, as any book
about the future must be. There are headless baby assassins, bastard farms that
grow political candidates with no past, illegal bowel disrupters, and mutant sex
cults. Itis also a humorous book, dark and
bitter in that way that makes it seem almost like a horrid, subtle joke someone
is playing on you. Like this once when
someone duplicated my car keys and everyday moved my car three parking
spaces down in the parking lot. You know
in the back of your head that this could
be viewed as a humorous thing, and
maybe you should have even seen it coming, but really you don't quite believe that
a joke is being played on you.
And yet the book is so terribly human.

The book is so terribly human. It
surrounds you in these absurd
situations, in this crazy world
where everyone has metal
wiring and is pregnant with
•lizards and then dwells on the
mundane.
It surrounds you in these absurd situations, in this crazy world where everyone
has metal wiring and is pregnant with lizards and then dwells on the mundane.
There's an entire comic on Spider's assistant Channon and her Gaian-biasBuddhist boyfriend Ziang. Ziang has decided

to have his brain downloaded out of his
body and strung across a billion tiny machines. There are pages of pseudo-explanation on the concept, but what is really
central to the story is Channon's reaction
to seeing Ziang as a foglet and her utter
helplessness in the whole situation.
"Transmetropolitan" isn't as much about
the future as itis about humanity and how
sometimes life is fragile and sometimes
it mocks you and kicks you in the balls
and runs away laughing.
But here is an important note: Spider
Jerusalem never cries. No one in the book
ever cries. It is not a melodramatic
preachy deal at all. In fact the vice, the
hurt, the hopelessness all sort of build
until Spider very satisfyingly does something crude and violent and then I sit back
and chuckle and want to marry him.
Yep, this column is a love letter of sorts
to Spider Jerusalem, and let me play silly,
pathetic girlfriend/therapist and make
excuses, but really, inside Spider is just
another lonely, misunderstood guy. Sure,
he beats up old ladies and defecates on
t.v. cameras. It has been said that "there
is no one he won't fuck over to get the
story." But it is only because he cares.
Yeah, Spider Jerusalem loves me. That's
why he's an asshole.
There are currently three trade paperbacks of "Transmetropolitan" stories, and
the series is published monthly by Vertigo. And in case anyone is wondering, a
"Transmetropolitan" movie is in the
works. I know, 'in the works' really doesn't
mean squat, and the movie will probably
be 'in the works' for another two or three
years at least.
But I really don't even know how I feel
about this hypothetical movie. On one

hand I don't want to be dissappointed and
like the comic less because of some
vaguely attached commercial enterprise,
but on the other hand, I'm curious to see
how Spider Jerusalem and his world is
presented in another visual medium. I
think a movie version of "Transmet"
might make me a little seasick, but in a
good way, if that makes any sense. I hope
that it sounds pathetic or giddy enough
to pique your curiosity.

Denzel maintains usual sex appeal in intriguing 'Bone Collector'
By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff
Who other than Denzel could play a quadriplegic and
still maintain such an intense degree of fuckability? Not
many guys could pull it off.
In his latest movie, "The Bone Collector," Washington
a cop who is paralyzed, with the
plays
surprise
exception of his shoulders and one finger, from the neck
down. He does an outstanding job, working the script
for all it's worth and tactfully portraying a crippled, seizure-prone, lonely man.
For the most part, the movie is pretty well done. Although the dialogue lags at times, the pieces flow together with great ease. "The Bone Collector" moves
quickly and holds the audience's attention. In spite of a
couple instances of generic serial-killer scenes, the film
is relatively original and well presented. As long as it is
not compared tQ either "The Silence of the Lambs" or
"Seven," the movie is great.
Starring alongside Angelina Jolie, who could have
done without a few of those large-lipped close-ups, Washington (as Lincoln Rhyme) is an expert homicide detective who, while investigating a murder, is hit in the back
with a large metal bar and crippled. No longer an official member of the NYPD, Lincoln spends his days in
bed, relying entirely on the care of Thelma, his live-in
nurse, played by Queen Latifah. Having decided that

his life has lost all meaning, that it would be preferable
to choose his time to go, Lincoln asks his physician about
assisted suicide.
Then, one day his pal and ex-co-worker, Paul, played
dopily by Ed O'Neil, drops by to request his help in the
latest bizarre New York homicide. He meets Angelina
Jolie's super sexy, but not very well-developed Emilia,
and he finds new meaning in his life.

Together, Emilia and Lincoln decipher the evidence

The gripping suspense and unraveling mystery would
make the movie worthwhile even if Denzel didn't.
The only terrible disappointment in "The Bone Collector" is that director Phillip Noyce tries to do too much
with the story. While the movie is definitely on par with
his previous thrillers "Patriot Games" and "Clear &
Present Danger," it could have been much better. Had
the movie focused more on Emilia and Lincoln's relationship or just on Emilia's quirkiness itself, and better
developed that aspect of the film, it would have had a
drastically more intense effect.
As is, the audience gets a brief sampling of Emilia
and her newfound relationship with Lincoln, and I felt
only vaguely connected to her as she stumbledupon each
new cadaver.
Still, this was a decent show. I was on the edge of my
seat, trying to discern the killer and his motives, watching Jolie enter the creepy crime scenes alone, and witnessing the victims' abductions and tortures. "The Bone

Supposedly a horror story about the illicit, unexplained deaths that occurred in a 1950s

gruesome than frightening. If you're in the mood for a true sense of terror with the
added bonus of a possibly plausible storyline, try "The Bone Collector" instead.

7:20,9:35

For kids, you say? Nah ..."Pokemon" has an appeal all its own.Well-done Japanese

If you've heard about"The Sixth Sense," you already know the premise. If you haven't,
suffice it to say,"l see dead people." If you go, you'll see more than just dead people; you'll
see a tantalizing, confusing, intelligent, overloaded horror film with a killer ending. This
one's been in theatres forever.

"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are

"[Stoppard] adds a third and
even a fourth dimension to his
trademark intellectual wit with
'Arcadia,'" said Osborne. "The
play... unfolds as the audience
watches characters in the early
nineteenth century act out their
own drama, while in alternating
scenes modern-day researchers
try to discover 'what really happened.' Gradually, the two time periods begin to intersect and overlap, and as they do we see how far
the present is from the past and
how close it will always be."
The show's strong mix of young
and experienced cast members,
along with the two-story, 20-foot
high set, promise to make
"Arcadia" a piece of theatre well
worth seeing.

Men's ultimate
Women's rugby tramples
goes 5-4 in CFCC UPenn in season-ending game
Earthworms stay competitive in the Ultimate scene
By Matt Murphy
For The Phoenix
The Swarthmore men's Ulti-

mate team traveled south to

North Carolina this past weekend to participate in a 16-team
tournament featuring some of
the best teams in the country,
including National Champions
North Carolina State University.
The Earthworms played nine
games and finished 5-4, making
it to the finals of the consolation
bracket before finally losing to
an experienced University of
Georgia team.
The first 6 games of the tournament were round-robin
games, which led to the men procuring the fourth seed in the consolation bracket (also known as
the CHUMPionship bracket, for
obvious reasons). The Earthworms lost to the University of
North Carolina, Eastern Carolina
University and the University of
Delaware, and scored wins over
Richmond University, William
and Mary and the University of
Florida.
The entire weekend finally
came down to the single-elimination tournament which paired up
Swarthmore and Appalachian
State University in the first
round. Earlier in the fall season,
Appalachian State had met up
with N.C. State and become the
only team so far this year to hand
the national champs a loss, but
they must have left their best
game at home because they only
won one game all weekend.
Swarthmore helped continue
that trend by slaughtering them
13-3.
That win created a match-up
between the Swarming Earthworms and the top-ranked
Princeton Clockwork Orange,
who have been a thorn in
Swarthmore's side for years. The
Earthworms have spent the past
threeyears being manhandledby
Princeton, with scores ranging
from 13-0 to 13-6.
But the men knew that this
year would be different: the
match against the Clockwork
Orange was going to be a dogfight. The game started off close,

with the score 3-3 after 6 points.
Princeton then opened up a 6-3
lead before Swarthmore ran off
4 straight points to go up 7-6.
Four points later, Princeton, still
holding to a one-point lead, had
the disc 10 yards away from
scoring and putting the game
away.
Collin Peng-Sue 'O3 was playing defense on the Princeton
player with the disc and forced
a turnover, after which Brandon
Silverman 'O2 put up a perfect
pass and found a sprinting Matt
Murphy 'Ol7O yards away in the
end zone to tie the game up at 99. With the game capped at 10,
the winner of the next point
would go to the finals, and the
loser would begin the 10-plushour trip home. So when Jeremy
"Badger" Slezak 'O2 matched up
on Princeton's star player and
saw the disc coming towards his
man, he stretched out to knock
it away and give the Earthworms
a chance to take the game.
After a Swarthmore turnover,
the Earthworms had to rely
again on Slezak to come through
in the clutch and force another
Princeton turnover, which he
promptly did, garnering a huge
cheer from the Swarthmore
faithful. The Earthworms, not
about to squander another precious opportunity, worked the
disc up the field before defensive hero Slezak found Murphy
in the endzone for the final point.
With one point, Swarthmore had
advanced to the finals and beat
rival Princeton for the first time
in recent memory.
The final game of the day was
against the University of Georgia, which had lost two surprising games the first day to wind
up in the CHUMPionship
bracket. Georgia, playing their
best ultimate of the entire tournament, outdid the determined
Earthworms, and the finals
ended with a score of 13-5. Georgia took the trophy back south
with them, but Swarthmore returned home with a winning
record, a second-place finish in
the consolation bracket, and
some newfound respect on the
national Ultimate scene.

By Katie Harper, Meredith Hegg, Rhiana
Swartz
For The Phoenix
The women's rugby team ended their season
on an exceptionally high note on Saturday, defeating their archrivals, the University ofPennsylvania Quakers, 31-10. The win was a culmination of effort from both the forwards and
backs. Right from the kick-off, Swarthmore ran
an intense offense with the strongest rucking
they had shown all semester. The UPenn forwards were overpowered in play after play, as
Swarthmore pulled them into countless rucks
and mauls. Scrumhalf Meghan Brennan 'OO
took advantage of this overload with beautiful
long passes out to the backs.
The first back to receive one of these highflying passes was Abigail Stewart-Teitelbaum
'Ol. After receiving the ballfrom Rhiana Swartz
'OO, Stewart-Teitelbaum dodged multiple defenders and touched the ball down in the first
ten minutes of the game. Stewart-Teitelbaum's
speed and strength at wing have proven to be
an asset on many occasions thanks to her excellent reading of the play, and Saturday was
just one more demonstration of that skill.
Center Lisa Jenkins 'O2 came through with
stunning agility to blow past UPenn's backs,
gaining precious yardage. Rookie Katie Harper
'O2 showed what a season of experience coupled
with speed and power can really do. Off a Cathy
Vaughan 'Ol one-handed pass, Harper plucked
the ball out of the air and scored the second
try of the game.
UPenn would not go down easily, however.
With a few well-placed kicks and a strong mauling sequence, the Quakers pulled off a questionable put-down in retaliation. They then
scored a second try, but gained only 10 total
points as they failed to make both conversions.
Perhaps the most beautiful play of the day
came out of a fast-paced forward offensive at
the 50-yard line. Alexa Miller 'OO ripped the ball
out of a maul before UPenn knew what hap-

pened and began dodging opponents. Blasting
past the Ail-American fly-half and through at
least three other tackle attempts. Miller blew
down the field to place the ball right between
the uprights, perfectly set up for a conversion
by Swartz.
Meredith Hegg 'OO made yet another play to
finish off the beautifulwork of the forward line
during the first half. Plowing through the majority of Penn's forward pack, Hegg managed
to find the grass and give Swarthmore another
five points.
Fly-half Vaughan scored the last try of the
game off a beautifully placed grub kick. Going
head to head with a Quaker player, Vaughan
showed greater speed, better ball handling, and
quicker reaction time. Swartz kicked three conversions total and gave the team an extra six
points.
Emily Sigalow 'O2 and Nancy Craig 'Ol, both
flankers, made sure that UPenn's momentum
died by repeatedly tackling players. Both have
contributed enormously this season with their
talent at playing different positions when
needed. Rookie Adrienne Fowler 'O3 joined the
forward pack this season, and has proven herself to be all-star material.
Perhaps the most exciting thing on Saturday
was the fact that B-side got their first taste of
victory. They shut out UPenn to win the game
7-0. The first win was due to the first B-side try
of the season, awarded to Josey Hastings 'O2,
who in Miller style broke numerous tackles and
then had a beautifulbreakaway downfield. Sara
Cole 'O3 put the icing on the cake with a beautiful conversion.
Defensively, big contributors to the B-side
effort were Rachel Kane 'O2, EmilianaBean 'O2
and Payal Shah 'O3. Each demonstrated intensity and great tackling ability. Offensively,
Esther Kim 'O3, Vanessa Askot 'O3 and Lynn
DeSilva-Johnson 'Ol excelled at passing and
catching.
These two wins marked the end of a 6-2 season for women's rugby.

Garnet Tide faces Washington
& Lee in final
game of season
By Justin Kane
Phoenix Staff
The Swarthmore GarnetTide will get one final
chance to add a second win to its season tally Saturdayagainst Washington & Lee in Lexington, Va.,
at 1 p.m.
Despite his team's inability to end its Centennial Conference losing streak, Garnet Tide head
coach Pete Alvanos said the pressure is off his
team and he expects them to come out ready to
play.
"Everybody certainly wants a win, but there's
no extra pressure," Alvanos said. "For the seniors,
it's hitting home that this is the last time they will
be putting their pads on. We don't want to leave
anything on the field in Lexington."
Alvanos expects a tough contest from Washington & Lee, the holders of a deceiving 4-5 record.
The Generals count among their four wins two
late-game, come-from-behind wins.
"We have to play aggressively for four quarters," Alvanos said. "If we don't, they'll know how
to come back."
Last year Washington & Lee defeated the Garnet Tide 37-7.
Swarthmore comes into the game as the victim
of a 28-point third-quarter explosion by Western
Maryland that ended in a 41-14 defeat. The Garnet Tide had fought to a 7-7 tie in the first half
against the Green Terror, the No. 7 ranked team
in Div. 111. With the loss the Garnet Tide dropped
to 0-7 in the Centennial Conference and 1-7 overall.
Alvanos attributed the second-half collapse to
exhaustion but thought the performance was on
the whole positive.
"We felt we could play with them, and we came
out, played with a lot of emotion and showed we
could hang with a top team in the first half," said

Alvanos. "But the emotion drained us. We just need
more bodies at the end of the game."
The Garnet Tide picked up its first points on a
four-yard toss from quarterback Scott Murray 'Ol
to tight end Robert Melick 'O3 in the second quarter. Despite gaining 285 yards on the game, the
team wasn't able to put together another scoring
drive until the fourth quarter, when running back
Ken Clark 'O3 connected with wide receiver Keith
McManimen 'O2 on a halfback option for a 15-yard
touchdown.
On defense the Tide was unable to stifle Western Maryland quarterback Ron Sermarini, who ran
14 times for 98 yards and three touchdowns and
went 19 of 23 in the air for 169 yards and another
touchdown. Individually, linebacker Joe Corso 'O2
recorded 13 tackles and an interception, and linebacker Axel Neff 'O2 had nine tackles with 2.5 tackles-for-a-loss. Defensive end Nick Loiacono 'O3
added two sacks.
Alvanos said that the loss was, as always, disappointing, but that he has been pleased with the
team's improvement.
"I'm disappointed that we have to carry this conference losing streak on our backs into next year,"
Alvanos said, "but when I look back at the season
I'm not disappointed. In our last three games, we
have won three out of the four quarters."

Swim team suiting up for a season to rival last year's
Both Swarthmore swim teams swept Ursinus at home on Wednesday in the first meet of the season
By Becca Howes-Mischel
For the Phoenix
The weather has turned cold,
and once again you can see the
familiar sight of people running

up the hill to Sharpies withpuffy
eyes and bags of ice, hoping that
all the food is not yet gone. Yes,
it's swim season again.
The whiteboard at the pool
reads "Please save us," although
the Swarthmore swim team has
officially only been in the water
for five weeks. Swarthmore
swimmers have been pushing
themselves in the water and in
the weight room until their
muscles are tired and sore in
order to be ready for the competitive season, whichbegan this
week. Goaded on by head coach
Sue Davis and assistant coaches
Lee Bowers and Charlie
Kennedy, the swimmers are
ready to face their conference
foes.
Starting this week with conference meets against Ursinus and
Franklin and Marshall, the swim
season will continue until the end
of February for most of the
swimmers and until March for
those who make Nationals. In
January, the swimmers will
travel to Florida for some midseason intensive training to
boost them to new levels of
speed for the conference meet.
After last year's phenomenal
season, ending with a dual meet
record of 6-1 in the conference
and 10-4 total for the women's
team and 5-1 in the conference
and 9-4 total for the men's team
as well as second place in the
conference for both teams, the
swim team is looking forward to
another fast season. According
to JoDe Hendrick 'OO, this year's
team shows a lot of promise. "I'm
looking forward to a season with
a lot of wins," said Hendrick.
"From what we've done so far, it
looks like a really fast team."
Although several fast seniors
graduated last spring, the men's
team has gained a stellar freshmen class of Chris Bussard
(free), Michael Dudley (breast,
IM), Jason Kerensky (breast,

If you build it,
we might win
With your hand shading your eyes, you
squint into the distance, only to see the sun
staring right back at you. The bunker cannot be too far ahead, so you decide to make
a run for it. The wind pushes against your
every step to the point that you feel as
though you are running in place. The long,
brownish-green weeds take a firm grasp
on your toes. You try to run, but your foot
gets caught in one of the many invisible
little mine-holes, causing you to fall to the
ground with a painfully twisted ankle.
You pull yourself up and hobble as best
you can until you reach the desert wasteland. Your mouth is parched and your feet
ache as you cross the dry, granite-like sand.
Finally, you reach the safety of the bunker, so you drop your gear at your feet, then
sit down to rest your weary body. "INCOMING!" someone yells. You try to take cover,
but it is too late
the grenade hits you
squarely in the eye, exploding upon impact.
"Foul ball," says the umpire. As the trainer
nurses your swollen eye with an icepack,
you exclaim, "I hate our damn baseball
field!"
Perhaps it is a slight exaggeration. The
Swarthmore baseball fieldis not a war-torn
jungle in Southeast Asia, nor is it a barren
wasteland in the Middle East, but it is not
far off from either. It is the only field in
the Centennial Conference that does not
have dugouts. The last time I saw a baseball field without dugouts, I was playing
for Murphy's Auto Body Shop and hitting
ragballs with a plastic bat off a rubber tee.
It is embarrassing when other teams
come to our field and scoff at its appearance. Even more embarrassing is when our
team takesthe field and stands by helplessly
as grounders take physically impossible
hops off the uneven infield, turning routine
outs into extra base hits. The "dirt" infield
is as soft as asphalt, making every slide or
dive a painful adventure. The outfieldis not
much better, considering the grass is rarely
cut and there are no legitimate fences. Of
course, it would be difficult to have fences
because the outfield also doubles as the soccer teams' home field.
Baseball and soccer are not the only
Swarthmore team to suffer from inadequate fields. The mutual destruction of
playing fields also takes place between
football and softball as well as lacrosse and
football. The football practice field is situated on the softball field, which is afflicted
by the same problems as the baseball field.
Lacrosse plays its entire season on the football game field, which has more dirt than
grass on it after the football season.
The situation would not be so appalling
if the extent of the problems stopped at unsightliness, but it goes much further than
this. Every time a recruit comes to
Swarthmore, he or she sees a school that
dedicates little or no energy to maintaining its fields. Do you think any athlete
would choose Swarthmore as his or her
home field? Of course not; he or she is
going to go to Johns Hopkins instead,
where they care about athletics. Why do
you think their teams are so good and ours
struggle just to get enough players? Hint:
"academic integrity" is not the answer.
I do not understand why Swarthmore can
have pride in everything it does ... except
when it involves athletics. We are able to
boast ourselves as the No. 1 school in the
nation and we are commended for the
beauty of the campus. Obviously, U.S. News
and World Report has not taken a look at
our athletic facilities. Our entire campus is
an arboretum kept in immaculate shape, yet
we have trouble making sure our lawn is
mowed and we have good dirt on our playing fields. One would think that with all the
great groundskeepers we employ, we might
have fields that are not eyesores. But until
that day, watch your step when you are
walking through the outfield.

Experience shows in All-Centennial
Conference winner Agunloye
The seasoned cross-country runner is ready for the next step: Regionals
By Patty Barrientos
Phoenix Staff
When you are attending a jock school
in Warrensville Heights, Ohio, and your
friends are always going to practice after school, playing sports can be contagious. So without prior athletic experience, Joko Agunloye 'Ol decided to
join her high school's track team.
She was completely unaware that
five years later, she would be running
cross country; would have broken the
Swarthmore women's 5K record twice
(1998
18:43 at Salisbury State and
1999 —18:41 at Fort Frederick); would
have been named All-Centennial Conference Honor Roll (1997-1999) and
would have competed in the All-MidEast Regionals and NCAA Nationals
(1998). In addition, Agunloye also became the first Swarthmore runner to
capture the Seven Sisters Championship, covering the Wellesley course in
a time of 19:36.
The latest honor has been the Centennial Conference title just two weeks
ago in her season's best race.
"She ran an amazing race," said cross
country coach Luci Rosalia. "It was
very exciting. It was one of the most
exciting Conference races and championship races I have seen."
"It was really nice to run calculated
and determined and keep going," said
Agunloye of her 18:41.67 finish after
trailing JillKrebs ofWestern Maryland
(18:45.02) for much of the race. "Even
though I went in thinking, I'm not going to chase [Krebs] down in the beginning because then I'm going to
spend myself and that's not how I run
my best," she added.
The slender, s'B", Nigerian-born
woman admitted that doing her best is
not dependent on a healthy dose of
sleep and nutritionalintake. "I'm don't
consider myself a disciplined runner,"
confessed Agunloye. "I remember my
RA last yearmade fun of me and said I
was the laziest disciplined person he
had ever seen in his life, just because I
do just what I have to do."
What she has been doing is running
fast and breaking her own records.
"I'm not that much faster than I was
last season," she said, "[but] I'm a lot
more consistent. I'm a lot more discipline with my racing." Her 1999 success is due to her developing strength
and confidence, which comes with experience.
Debuting at nationals last year has
reduced the butterflies and the fear of
failure. "Like any first anything, it can
be overwhelming," said Rosalia of
Agunloye's first appearance. "Joko
didn't have her best race at nationals,
but very few runners get the opportunity to go to a national meet," she
added. "For her, it was an experience
to take it in, to learn and to compete in
a meet where there are runners who
are very aggressive who are just as talented as you are."
To help strengthen Agunloye's determination and talent, Rosalia has individualpractice schedules. "I have Joko
run with the men," she said. "I think
that has made her a stronger runner
because she can keep up with some of
them but not all of them so she's constantly pushing herself and working
harder. That helps her in the races."
At the conference meet, Agunloye
ran her race at her pace. The Western
Maryland runner, Krebs, who hadbeat
Agunloye and had lost to her as well,
took an early lead. An experienced
Agunloye set up her strategy for the
race. "The time I beat her I realized
what she does is she goes out really fast
and then she maintains," said
Agunloye. "I didn't think I could run
with her."
Despite the distance she needed to
cover, Agunloye stayed focused. "A lot

of runners would have given up. It's a lot
harder to catch up to someone than to stay
at the same pace as that person," explained Rosalia.
Agunloye, however, recalled, "As soon

"I will run, and just put one foot
in front of the other. If I can see
someone that I can take I
definitely want to do better and
run faster that I have before."
as I looked up I noticed that she was right
there, I thought I could go after her... as
soon as I was beside her I realized that
she was tired." As Agunloye's vision
blurred and her joints ached, all she could
think was 'keep going' and 'hold her off.'
Once she passed Krebs, her running
groove kicked in, she didn't look back as
the finish line was within grasp. Thoughts
of coming in second place disappeared.
"She ran a very smart race and that
comes from experience and being able
to say T don't care about everybody
else,'" said Rosalia. "She ran it the way
she wanted to run it.
Throughout the season, Agunloye has
faced very few athletes who run withability like hers. However, conferences,
regionals, and nationals offer aggressive
athletes who run at her times and better.
Rosalia is confident that Agunloye will be
a contender. "I have high aspirations," she

said. "Joko is very talented and driven."
The second time around, Agunloye hopes
to take advantage of her experience. "She
knows what she wants and she goes after
it. I think that has been the difference
from last year," added Rosalia.
Despite Agunloye's personal accomplishments, she does not want to be
viewed as a superstar within the team.
"I need [my teammates] as much as they
need me because we are a team," she
said. "The thing that would make me the
happiest with my running is if as a team,
we went to nationals," she added, because "they're a wonderful group of
people who work hard every day."
Although she does not want to cause
additional pressure on the team in the
coming weekend, she cannot help admitting that "if I go [to nationals], great
but if we go [as a team], that would be so
the ultimate."Agunloye and her cross
country teammates head for the MidEast Regional Championships Nov. 14 in
Frostburg, Md., where they will face
strong competition.
For the upcoming meet, Agunloye will
have a simple approach: "I will run, and
just put one foot in front of the other. If I
can see someone that I can take I definitely want to do better and run faster
that I have before."
It is the same approach she takes before all her races. "But this year, as long
as I can leave there knowing that I did
that best I could, that's all I want to do,"
said Agunloye, and no one can ask for
more.
