"I think a school that has an endowment like this
school does, that does not pay a respectable wage, is a disgrace," she said. "There's a huge disparity here" between
faculty and staff salaries.
"Students couldn't go here and get grades wijthout us,
much less the people who keep the grounds and serve
meals," she said. "We may not have Ph.D.s, but you
couldn't the run the college without us."
And even though CRC members cited recent increases
in health and retirement benefits as a show of their concern for staff welfare, Sloman said she recently had to stop
using the college's plan because it was costing her $660 a
month.
Talking, Sloman received nods from political science
professors collecting their morning mail while she spoke.

When Sloman said how almost no one makes use of the college's dental and vision plan—a plan that is the same for
both faculty and staff—a professor agreed. "It's a joke,"
they said.
Still, that wage disparity is "in any field, in any business," Sloman added. "Unfortunately, I think that disparity exists everywhere. But that doesn't make it right."
Tom Ermel, a retiree and bookstore worker, started at
the college about six years ago. After an interview with
Bookstore Director Kathy Grace, Ermel was told he got the

Then Grace called after him. Didn't he want to know his

Students use public computers, like the Mac and Windows machines in Beardsley, to communicate via e-mail.

New committee tackles
electronic privacy issues
BY REIKO TESHIBA
rteshibl@swarthmore.edu

The newly formed Electronic
Privacy Committee met for the first
timelast Thursday, charged with formulating a coherent privacy policy
covering electronic transmissions
and communication involving students, faculty and staff.
The faculty handbook states that
"the communications systems.of the
college, including the telephone,
mail, e-mail and computing facilities,
may not be used for surveillance."
The-paragraph also says that messages sent to and from college community members cannot be intercepted or monitored.
Branen Salmon 'O3, the committee's only student member, said that
the members want to write the new

policy by the end of this semester but
that this was only tentative and the

process could take longer. He added
that the new policy should not
change much from the old one.
"We're not so much looking to
change the spirit of any policy,"
Salmon said. "But I think more to
kind of codify the general sentiment
that's already existing in the community, since there's not anything
codified now."
Math professor Steve Maurer '67,

who currently serves as associate
provost for information technology,
created the Electronic Privacy
Committee because he felt that the
current policy was inadequate given
today's modern technology and did
not properly express the community's widely held belief in personal
privacy.
"I think that the sentiment is not
uniform here, [but] I think that gen-

eral sentiment is that the communications of students and faculty ought

to be afforded a highest level of pripossible,"
vacy
Salmon said.
"Basically meaning that there are
times when the privacy could be
breached without external compul-

sion," but that these times should
only be "student-initiated," for example when a student is threatened via
e-mail or voice'mail and needs outside help to find out the source of the
threats.

Though later amended to include
e-mail, the current statement in the
faculty handbook first appeared in

Robert Cross, wrote it in response to
an incident in which a college operator was found listening in on student
phone calls for the FBI during the

The Privacy of Student Records
The student handbook currently stipulates students' responsibilities regarding access to their academic records and directory information, but it does
not include information on privacy of electronic student records.
According to Registrar Martin Warner, between
Sept. 11 and the passage of the U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act,
the government temporarily expanded its powers to
gain information about students by using loopholes
in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act,
also known as the Buckley Amendment. While the
U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act has caused ambiguities for electronic information such as e-mail and library
records, it reined in the government in regard to stu-

Yesterday was the first she heard about the wage
increase, and immediately one question came to mind.
"How is somebody going to come in here at nine, and
I'm here at $9.14?" she wondered. "I don't understand why
they didn't bump us up first."
Some staff members met the news of the wage increase'
Avith disinterest. Most, like Jefferson, had questions or
concerns for the Compensation Review Committee (CRC),
the group responsible for proposing the increase in the
minimum staff wage from $6.66 to $9.
Though Jefferson called the new minimum wage "fair,"
those who have already given several years of hard work
to the college, either in an office at a computer or in a dorm
with a vacuum, deserve more money too, she said. The $9
that will be given to new employees is not right, considering how hard it is for her to make ends meet now, after
over six years of working at Swarthmore.
"To work here, and pay your bills, and put something in
the bank?" she asked. "That doesn't work for me." She
added that many of her friends and fellow employees, even
those who are married, find it difficult to get by. Some
work two jobs.
"I still feel like I need to work two jobs," she admitted.
I can't."

response to the increase: not enough. Sloman works as an

dent records.
"The act basically says that the Justice
Department cannot just walk in and ask for student
records. It must provide a court order," Warner said.
"Only the people empowered to do so are those with
the standing of Assistant Attorney General or higher." Short of that, Warner said that the online student records are secure because they are on a separate server with an encrypted connection.
"The college takes precautions, but there are no
absolute guarantees when it comes to electronic
communication," said Mark Dumic, manager of networking and systems. "As general wisdom, don't
expect total confidentiality."

Professor pushes for Chester educational center
BY IVAN BOOTH E
iboothel@swarthmore.edu

One of every nine people in the city of Chester was
unemployed in 1992. This city of about 35,000 had seen its
industrial companies relocate and its middle class disappear. The sprawling, 10-school Chester-Upland district
was one of the worst in the state; dropout rates hovered
around 40 percent.
Last fall, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania handed
over nine Chester schools to a private, for-profit firm,
Edison Schools, Inc. Initial praise for improving the
appearance of the schools has given way to criticism of
the company. A report the school district administration'
recently published stated that, with the company in control, there would likely be nearly 3,000 suspensions this
year, or approximately one for every other student
enrolled. In elementary and middle schools, serious disciplinary incidents have risen 61 percent since last year.

Searching for a site
For the past two years, the group of organizations has
been working to secure a site for the educational and
recreational facility. Until a few months ago, they thought
they had just about done it.
"We had plans to develop a four-acre site in a newly
developed neighborhood in Chester, called the Chatham
Estates community," Reeves said. A two-acre plot of land
Chatham had donated and the adjacent two-acre site of
the former Booker T. Washington Elementary School
would have composed the site.
"The goal was to have a four-acre site in which we
would have a combination of educational family
resources with an academic, for-profit athletic component to it," Reeves said. In addition to the benefits from
the center, the project itself would generate a significant
number of jobs.
After attempts to negotiate, however, the school district ultimately put the site up for public sale. "The district offered it up for sale outside of the Chester Housing
Authority, and so [the project] got derailed," said
Lawrence Hamm, president of the Chester High School
Parent-Teacher Organization.
The Frederick Douglass Christian School, located
nearby, placed a winning bid of $275,000 on the property.
The coalition of groups including Swarthmore bid $lO,OOO

In addition, Reeves said, there was a "very explicit
design [for the project] to make sure that we are not drawing on the college's resources."
Erica Kaufman 'O3, a student member of CSPS, has?
been working closely with Reeves, and the two hope to
publish a report on the project in Chester shortly.
The purpose of the project, Reeves said, is "not simply
to develop ourselves into a national model that can be
replicated across the country. [lt is] also to really give
some additional meaning to Al [Bloom]'s notion of ethical
intelligence and social responsibility." Bloom, college
president, has been an advocate of the CSPS and its relationship with Chester since its inception.
Though the CSPS has existed for some time, "the college has never really done anything systemic" in Chester,
Reeves said. "The goal is to help residents take charge of

intended to help students choose classes,
not to incite professors to change their
teaching methods.
Recognizing a concern that evaluations
could have an effect on the careers of professors without tenure, Rice described the
forms as "very generic," and said the
Council "did not design the forms to determine tenure decisions."
Provost Connie Hungerford agreed
that "the recommendations will not play
any part in reappointment or tenure
reviews."
Student Council is now looking to
fund the publication of the booklets and
to ensure distribution of class recommendations every semester. Student
Budget Committee will fund the publishing, but cannot pay to employ an individual to collect and compile the data. The
council intends to find a separate funding source, although that source is not
yet known, in order to employ "people to
compile data each semester," Rice said.

The topics of race and sexuality will surface throughout the week. There
will be a discussion panel on March 26 involving queer people of color from

They never really discuss the intersection between those issues," Flores
said. "This week is going to focus on the intersections," such as people of
color who are also queer or questioning. Students who have to deal with
these intersections in their own lives founded COLORS in the fall of 2000,
hoping that it would address their specific concerns. The group has
grown, and it blossomed in the fall of 2001, according to Flores.
COLORS will host a coffee house whose program will include poetry
and music. The night will feature D'lo, a Sri Lankan slam poet from New
York City, and may showcase The Thesbians, a group based in
Philadelphia. Flores is "excited about the coffeehouse. D'lo is a good slam
poet, and she is funny," he said. An open mic will allow anyone to participate in the festivities.
"Don't Tell Anyone," a Peruvian

ITS prepares for full-scale arrival of Mac OS X
All public space computers to support OS X by fall of 2003; shared software to be available this fall
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@Swarthmore.edu
Starting this January, Apple
Computers announced that all
new Macintosh computers would
be shipped with the new UNlXbased operating system, Mac OS
X, as the default operating system. With differences in software
compatibility between OS X and
OX 9, Swarthmore's Information
Technology Services has been
exploring ways to upgrade its
computer resources to adopt to
the OS change.
"Officially, we don't yet support OS X on campus," User
Services

Coordinator

Seth

Frisbie-Fulton said. "We are running and testing it, and we will be
ready to support it when we get
people who are running it."
ITS is engaged in efforts to
stay on top of this new operating
system. "We have to be ready to
provide training and support for
faculty
computer
users,"
Computing
Academic
Coordinator Doug Willen said.
"We're constantly in touch with

software developers, and we've
done training from Apple on
using and solving problems with
OS X."
Currently, all
Macintosh
users on campus own machines
that came with OS 9 or earlier as
the operating system. ITS is
anticipating a rush on OS X during the beginning of the fall
semester this year. Any new
Macintosh bought over the summer will run OS X as the default
system.
"We expect that, this fall, we
will be doing a lot of work to

ensure that students are success-

fully running OS X," Willen said.
Currently, ITS believes that its
biggest problems with OS X
involve computer security and
privacy. "We don't really have
the virus protection nailed down
yet," Willen said. "There hasn't
been a response from virus protection developers yet."
According to Frisbie-Fulton,
Network Associates has recently
released a fully supported version of their virus protection software Virex native to Mac OS X,

and Symantec, Inc. reported on
its Web
site that Norton
Antivirus for OS X is available.
Frisbie-Fulton said the college is
looking into acquiring software
licenses that would allow for
these programs to be available on
the shared student software server.
Another issue facing ITS is the
process of making software
native to Mac OS X available on
the software servers. "If we're
supporting both software systems, we'll have to buy [key server] licenses for both," FrisbieFulton explained. "A big issue
has been the Adobe products
such as Acrobat and Photo Shop.
We do not have licenses for them
yet." Many companies have
released software that runs on
both operating systems.
Willen estimated that all of the
college's public computers will be
running Mac OS X beginning in
the fall of 2003. "Before we can
switch over, we have to make
sure that public computers will

remain clean and that students'
individual work will remain pri-

vate," he said.
ITS has to ensure a better level
of security and software compatibility before the public switch to
OS X can occur, according to
Willen. "When we do move to OS
X in public areas, students are
going to have to expect a higher
level of security than they currently do on OS 9," he said.
"Students should expect to log in
to public Macs using their server
passwords."
Although much work has to be

done before a full switch can
occur, ITS does not anticipate
many problems in the fall when
more OS X users arrive on campus. "From a fresh start, Mac OS
X is not any harder than learning
OS 9," dorm computer consultant
Nicholas Lum 'O4 said.
Some experienced Mac users,
however, may find adjusting to a
brand new operating system a bit
of a challenge. "Mac users who
are very familiar with the old
Macintosh environment may find
the switch over to X a little difficult," Frisbie-Fulton said. "It's
not as out-of-the-box as other Mac

The new iMac will feature OS X
as the standard operating system.
operating systems have been."

ITS

encourages

students i

already using Mac OS X to contribute their opinions. "We want
to hear back from users about OS
X," Willen said. "We need to hear

back from students about their
experiences. This is one area
where student input is really
going to help us develop the best
technical responses that we can."

Phillies, newspapers respond to pervasive e-mail hoax
After year-long, anti-Phillies e-mail campaign, Phillies, Inquirer, Daily News conduct
joint fraud investigation; Swatties swamped by messages since May of 2001
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

Someone out there in cyberspace wants
you to know how the Philadelphia Phillies'
front office is running the team into the
ground.
For months, Swarthmore students have
been bombarded with e-mails criticizing
those in charge of the team's operations
that appear to be from writers at The

Philadelphia Inquirer and from Phillies
employees. These e-mails, which officials
say are not affiliated in any way with either
the Philadelphia newspaper or the Phillies,
are part of a hoax that has been plaguing
the Inquirer's and the Phillies' e-mail systems and has resulted in an Internet hacker
investigation.
Since the beginning of Major League
Baseball's 2001 season, an anonymous
Phillies fan has sent numerous e-mails
about the team's third baseman Scott
Rolen, his future in Philadelphia and the
financial condition of the Phillies. Through
February, these e-mails had return addresses within the domain of phillynews.com,
which the Inquirer and The Philadelphia
Daily News use. Over the past few weeks, emails have arrived carrying the domain of
the Phillies themselves, phillies.com.
These e-mails have bashed many established Philadelphia icons. They represent
an adamant attack against the actions of
the PhiUies. But a more pressing concern to
those directly affected through the illicit
use of their domain names is the way in
which these e-mails are adversely affecting
the reputations of the city's news organizations and baseball team.
For example, in an e-mail sent out on

the
amoore@phillynews.com,
responsible for the hoax attacked the
Phillies for the team's lack of effort to
retain their star third baseman. "We don't
need to go back and look at all the articles
dozens of them in which the trash at
the Daily News and Inquirer urged the
Phillies not to go into the free agent market
and buy studs but to trade last year's World
Series MVP Curt Schilling," the person
wrote.
"This hoax has covered a number of
months," Phillies Vice President for
Operations and Administration Michael
Stiles said. "I've spoken a number of times
with people at the Inquirer about the investigation. It is a matter that we and the
Inquirer take very seriously. The nature of
the e-mails is offensive, and the fact that the
e-mail sender is purporting to having a connection with the Phillies is also of concern."
The Phillies are making every effort to
maintain a solid public image. "We are taking steps to put an end to this," Stiles said.
"We have been responding individually to
recipients of the offensive e-mail and even
though our name and address appears on
these e-mails, they do not come from the
Phillies."
According to those running the two
Philadelphia newspapers, the e-mails have
not originated from within their computer

systems. The Inquirer's Deputy Managing
Editor for Operations Sandra H. Long
issued a prepared statement explaining the
Inquirer's position on these e-mails.
"We are victims of a computer hoax,"
Long said in her statement. "Someone is
maliciously impersonating the names of
our sportswriters and newspapers and
sending spam e-mail."
The Inquirer, Daily News and

phillynews.com have experienced network problems due to responses to these
false e-mails. They are also suffering from
a public relations nightmare due to this
hoax.
"Not only are these acts of criminal mischief causing people like you to think badly
of us, they are also jamming our system

March 21 2002

and hindering our operations," Long's
statement read.
In order to handle the inordinate number of response to these e-mails,
phillynews.com now sends an automatic

reply with Long's prepared statement to
those who reply to the fake e-emails.

those perpetuating the hoax were able to
gain access to the Swarthmore e-mail
accounts. Due to the nature of the investigation, officials from phillynews.com and
the Phillies were unable to provide details
about the scope of the e-mail hoax. "The situation is under intensive investigation,
and we hope to put a stop to this soon,"
Long wrote.

Emotional backup
In 2000, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology sophomore named Elizabeth Shin committed suicide. Normally,
her death would have served as a tragic reminder of the
consequences of serious mental illness, but now Shin's
parents are suing the university for $27 million. They
claim that the school should have notified them that their
daughter had revealed in counseling that she had attempted suicide more than once.
The suit has raised issues about the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which prevents colleges and universities from disclosing any personal information about students. The only exception to the law is a
life-threatening emergency. Shin's parents call repeated
suicide attempts a life-threatening situation, and we
couldn't agree more.

Improving the mental and
emotional health of college
students is not an impossible task.
Emotional and mental health has become a big issue
for college students. Since 1985, the percentage of college
first-years who report less than average emotional health
has been rising markedly, according to an annual nationwide survey by University of California at Los Angeles.
Since 1950, suicide rates among college-age women has
more than doubled, and the rate among college-age men
has tripled. College is a time of personal development and
change
many students are away from home for the first
time, and most come to college without any kind of social
support network. The onset of many serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder frequently
takes place in young adulthood. The stressful environment at a place like Swarthmore doesn't help alleviate
potential problems.
But improving the mental and emotional health of college students is not an impossible task. Most schools,
including Swarthmore, offer free or low-cost counseling.
But some colleges have begun limiting the number of
therapy sessions to which students are entitled.
Fortunately, Swarthmore has no such policy. Though students have complained in the past that Psychological
Services is not always able to adequately address mental
health issues, reaching out to them is a good first step.
But the availability of counseling services shouldn't be
where the effort to help those in need ends it certainly
didn't save Elizabeth Shin. It was easy for her to get lost
in the system at MIT, a large university. According to the

Web site of Suicide Awareness Voices for Education
(SAVE), it is estimated that 80 percent of people who die of
suicide mention it to a friend or relative before dying. We
should embrace our small community here; no one should
slip through the cracks in a college of 1,400 students. In
many ways, Swarthmore is like a family. Relatives may
not all like each other, but they look out for each other in
times of need. Swarthmore should be no different.

EPC deserves attention
It is easy to forget that what comes up on our Web
browsers is not for our eyes only. The sites we browse, the
e-mails we send, the flashing prompts we respond to automatically, the long-lost friends whose names we might
casually type into Google, and many of our other online
actions are trackable by anyone with sufficient curiosity

and skill.
Information Technology Services (ITS) already protects
the online activity of the college network through a firewall, a device that examines every network datum that
passes through it. The recent formation of the Electronic
Privacy Committee (EPC) is a positive next step toward
safeguarding the privacy of personal electronic communication among members of the Swarthmore community. By
taking the pre-existing policy that the college's communication systems "may not be used for surveillance" and
"codifying it," as the EPC's sole student member Branen
Salmon 'O3 put it, the college is taking an active and necessary position on privacy concerns.

Registrar statement protects civil liberties
Dear Editor:
I would like to commend Martin
Warner for his recent clarification in
The Weekly News and on the registrar's Web site of the registrar's policy concerning the privacy of student
records, in light of the U.S.A-PATRIOT Act. It is reassuring to see that

our registrar is committed to notifying students if their records are
requested, since such notification is
no longer required by law. The
U.S.A-PATRIOT Act, like other governmental actions since Sept. 11, has
eroded legal protection of our civil
liberties. Those who are interested

in learning more are invited to work

Swat conflicts reveal disturbing theme
Dear Editor:

Another controversy, another dialogue, another nonresolution. After four years at Swarthmore as an instigator, I see the common theme amongst the questions I
asked myself after every community eruption.
Why is it always men at Swarthmore (two men,
according to an 'O2 who relayed recent events) who try to
"move us beyond" conversations about rape after an incident prompts dialogue on campus?
Why is it always white people at Swarthmore who

"are fed up with talking" about race?
Why is it always non-athletes at Swarthmore who say
that varsity athletes should "quit whining about the
treatment of athletes and athletic cuts"?
Why is it always straight people at Swarthmore who
argue the queer community "should stop being so out" or
"not ruin (last year's) Sager"?
Why is that, Swarthmore?

Haverford is a
little bit salty
Every Monday and Wednesday I take a class titled "Th
Letters ofPaul" at Haverford. Although I am a second-semeste

senior, this is the first collegiate course I have taken at any
institution other than Swarthmore. Without getting all sappy
about how taking a class at a different school broadens your
horizons, opens your eyes, and all that nonsense, I will say tha
it is a good experience. And it all starts with the drive.
For the first week of the class, I took the shuttle, which wa
comforting in that it reminded me of riding the bus when
was little. Ever since that first week, though, my new frienc
Pat picks me up behind Wharton and drives me to the Main
Line in his trusty baby blue Lumina. I am usually a few min
utes late, and, if I happen to
come on time, he arrives a tad

tardy.
Nothing too formal. Maybe a

we grumble about the fact tha
we have a class to which we
have to go. But after a minute

Pat drives, changes stations on
his radio as if it was a turntable
and snaps his fingers twice
when we narrowly make it pas
a long yellow light. I sit in the
FRANK MARTINEZ passenger seat, learn abou
classic popular music like
Street Performer
Springsteen and the Stones, and
reprimand Pat when he chick
ens out on a yellow.
Mostly, we talk. I learn a ton about politics by asking ques
tions galore. We plan future campaigns together, and he ha
already signed on to manage "Martinez for Mayor" in
Milwaukee 2012. Just a few days ago, we saw former Sixer
owner Pat Croce while at a stoplight and got a big, friendly
wave from him. We wonder if all the restaurants we pass are
any good.

"I now better understand the merits of
being a commuter student. There Is a
joy In having school there' and everything else at home."
We get to Haverford for Professor McGuire's religion
class, and we eventually arrive at our classroom on time. It
really is refreshing to be taking a class on a different campus
with different students in a different building. It is amazing
how many Bryn Mawr students take classes at Haverford,
and now I know that they have a really nice bookstore over
there. I do like getting to see and meet a few new people, and
Haverford's Magill Library really has some great study
nooks.
Every Monday and Wednesday after our class together,
Pat and I walk back to the visitor's parking lot and drive back
to Swarthmore. We usually spend at least the first five minutes talking about the class, what we thought was interesting, and what we didn't understand. We make the comments
that we were too cautious or just too polite to say in front of
the rest of the class. We maybe even try to work through a
particular sticking point from one of the Pauline letters of
the New Testament.
The drive back is a lot like the drive there, only in reverse
from Haverford to Swarthmore rather than vice versa,
done with class rather than about to start it. We do some
more talking about politics or bad drivers on the Lancaster
Pike. When Pat drops me off, I thank him for the ride, and I
am done with Haverford for a while. I now better understand
the merits of being a commuter student. There is a joy in having school "there" and everything else at home. It keeps
things more organized and maybe even allows for better concentration when you are "there" and focusing on studies and
class discussion. Either way, I enjoy my class at Haverford,
as much of an abroad experience as I'll get, at least while an
undergraduate. So if variety is the spice of life, there is no
doubt that I have had a bland collegiate diet. A little salt, to
carry the analogy, is better than none at all.

Living wage must take priority
staff members in substantive dialogue on the recommendations. In addition, no hard copies of the recommendations have been made available to date, making
it very difficult to communicate the recommendations
clearly and accurately.
The aforementioned recommendations from the
CRC represent a step toward better compensation for
Swarthmore staff. Certain CRC members have
explained theirrecommendation choices by saying that
compensation can take a number of forms, including
improved benefits as opposed to higher wages. Our
stance is that both are important, and while a living
wage is the least restrictive form of improved compensation, staff members should ultimately not have to
choose between good benefits and fair wages.
Crucially, despite the importance of the issue, the
CRC has not had the power to make a living wage a
reality. Whether or not committee members were committed to a market-based compensation philosophy ora
needs-based philosophy of economic justice, the committee was working within the constraints of
Swarthmore's current budget and planned financial
commitments. As CRC committee member Jeff Lott told
campaign members in a meeting on Feb. 28, "If [the
Living Wage and Democracy Campaign has] a quarrel
with the College, it shouldn't be with this committee
but with the overall spending priorities of the College."
We are in agreement on this point.
The economic realities experienced by many staff
members here those who clean our dorms, cook our
food, and essentially keep our college running

difficult, and we recognize this. In order to achieve our
goals, we must now, as Lott said, go to the decision makers: the Board of Managers and senior administrators:
Their commitment is what can make a living wage a
reality. Years ago, decision-makers at Swarthmore
decided that excellent financial aid was of utmost
importance, and found the money to offer outstanding
aid packages. Today, the College remains firmly committed to its financial aid practices. We feel a similar
commitment is necessary in this case. The living wage
should not be a matter of sacrifice or tradeoffs between
the different core needs of Swarthmore staff. While we
understand the restrictions of our economy and the
College's numerous financial commitments, instituting
a living wage is an absolute necessity. It must be treated as such.

BY CHELA DELGADO

A living wage is a wage that enables people to meet
basic living needs: housing, childcare, food, transportation and subsidized health care. It varies based on the
cost of living in a given area. The Swarthmore Living
Wage and Democracy Campaign is recommending a living wage for all College employees of $l3 per hour,

based on data collected by the Women's Association for
Women's Alternatives (WAWA), a local organization
that compiles self-sufficiency standards for local areas
across Pennsylvania.
A living wage is something that must happen at
Swarthmore. As student members of the campaign, we
have spent the last year and a half speaking with staff
members from Environmental Services, Dining
Services and Facilities about the difficulties of living
on Swarthmore's low wages. In the Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign's worker ballot done last fall, 83
percent of Dining Services respondents considered
wages to be a "very important" issue. The struggle to
meet needs is very pressing, which is why we hoped
that the Compensation Review Committee (CRC) would
adequately address the needs of low-wage staff.
We applaud the progress, but not the process, of the
CRC. Their recommendations include instituting a $9
per hour Swarthmore minimum wage, increasing the
College's contributions to employee retirement
accounts, and attempting to minimize the gap between
health care costs for single workers and workers with
families. These are very important and positive
changes for some low-waged staff members.
Initially, the campaign was assured that the CRC
would take measures to seek the input of the entire
College community. Indeed, several advisory groups to
the central committee, each representing a different
campus constituency, were instituted. Open meetings
and central committee representation were to be the
main forums for low-wage
staff concerns.
Unfortunately, however, many low-wage staff remain
unfamiliar with the committee's workings and recommendations. In October, the CRC held meetings to present their draft recommendations. Hourly-paid staff
were not well-represented at these meetings, which
were mostly spent clarifying details of the recommendations rather than soliciting staff input and engaging

Swarthmore is that, in a lot of the dorms, the rooms are
totally different from one another. One room might look
tiny on the floor plan, but it could have high ceilings, a
big window and a nice closet, while a bigger-looking
one might be cut off. This is especially true in Parrish.
And in Scott Kushner's room this year, haha!

6. It's good exercise.

1 Block.

Blocking is the best way to get this all done with and
be sure that you'll be living in a place you like with
some people you can stand. Remember: Blocking as a
rising sophomore uses up your top cohort. But maybe
that's the time when you most want to use up that high

Really, stairs aren't so bad. They're good for you,
and you'll get used to them. Don't just cross a nice

tends to be.

2. Read the packet carefully.
OK, if you're blocking, make sure you know the

rules. I'd agreed to live with a bunch of people for sophomore year, but I hadn't read the rules at all. So we
ended up putting down a quad in Mertz as our first
choice, and, ugh, a block in Willets as our third or
fourth, thinking it was better than going into the lotto
and getting ML. So we used our top cohort pick to live
on Willets first south for a second straight year. I still
kick myself for that.

7. Think not what a room can do for you, but what you

can do for a room.
Ultimately, there are very few perfect rooms on this
campus. Decide what your priorities are, base your
choice on those, and then work to remedy the room's
other features. For instance, location was the most
important thing for me last year. I ended up with a relatively small room floor space-wise, but a futon sofa and
shelves have allowed me to make the most of it. Think
what a loft might do for a room with little floor space
but high ceilings, or a sarong for those terrible Mertz
walls.

3. Speak now or forever hold your peace.
If you have a medical problem, get a doctor's note
and tell Myrt. You're not imposing on anyone. They try
hard to make your life easier, but they can't do it unless
they know about it. And don't bitch about it when
someone who does have a problem does get things taken
care of.

4. Hook up with an upperclassman.

8. Live off campus.
If you don't mind walking, it's a good option. It's
cheaper, there are a variety of options, and you don't
have to be on the meal plan, which means you can cook
for yourself or eat at Cheng Hing. And you get parking.
If you've seen how many times my car has been booted
in Tarble Circle, you can see just how big a plus that is.
I would've done it, but I'm just too lazy.

Terrible advice for Paces on Saturday night, a clever
strategy for room draw, as a friend of mine calls it, if
you have a close friend in the class above you. Every
once in awhile, there will be that odd upperclassman
who wants to live with sophomores or doesn't mind the
single in a two-room triple (there are some really nice
ones on campus). Seek him or her out if you're a rising
sophomore and both you and your roommate draw really bad numbers. A rising junior or senior cannot pick
below the first person picking in the class under them.

9. Be prepared and flexible.
First off, know what you want and go for it, but if
you don't get it, RAs will tell you about other appealing
options at the lottery. The more flexible you are, thebetter your chances of finding something are. Some will be
triples or quads or quints. If you've talked about it with
other pairs or triplets of roommates, you'll be more
ready to pounce on a sweeeet quad if your plans for that
double in Mertz go awry.

5. Scout.
Don't just look at the little dorm plans. If you're
blocking, get your group together and look at the rooms.
If you're in the lottery, ask some upperclassmen what
your number might buy you, and check out some of
those rooms. One of the things I really like about

10. Talk to your elders.
We've weathered the storm and endured all the hardships of Swarthmore housing. Most of us are glad to
pass on our wisdom. Upperclassmen can tell you where
the hidden gem rooms are and what to avoid. Good
luck, and don't let it stress you out too much.

Carly Hammond worked with Sharon Pierce, right, to produce photographs that will be the focus of a Learning for Life exhibit in the Kaori Kitao Student Art Gallery starting Friday.

Learning partnerships culminate in art show
Staff member to exhibit photographs of faces and flowers in Kaori Kitao Gallery

BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
On Tuesday morning, Carly Hammond
'O2 and her Learning for Life partner,
Environmental Services worker Sharon
Pierce, set up for the upcoming photography exhibit and program presentation in
the Kaori Kitao Gallery. In a moment of
candor, Pierce and Hammond talked about

upcoming graduation and
departure from Swarthmore.
Pierce was evidently disappointed that
this art gallery will be her last big project
with Hammond, with whom she has
worked on photography for almost two
years. "I'm going to miss this girl," she
said. "She's a very special person to me. I
feel as though she's sort of like a daughter
to me because I can talk to her so easily."
Hammond, visibly touched by these
words of praise, responded, "If I could stay
here just to work with you next year, I
would. Of course, I'm going to miss you."
It is exchanges like these that characterHammond's

ize the Learning for Life program and these
feelings of friendship that transcend the
barriers between the students and staff
here at Swarthmore that the upcoming
exhibit in the student art gaUery will try to
capture. The gallery will host an opening
reception Friday at 4 p.m., featuring the

THE PHOENIX

works of Pierce along with a presentation
of staff- and student-designed Web sites, a
creative writing sample from the program,
and a presentation discussing the goals and
motives behind Learning for Life. The
gallery will be open on Sundays and
Mondays between 2 and 4 p.m.
Pierce, a Learning for Life staff coordinator and Hammond have formed a close
bond through the Learning for Life program.
This initiative,
to
unique
Swarthmore, pairs a staff member with a
student. The partnership is supposed to
have mutual benefits. The student instructs
the staff member in a skill he or she has
developed while the staff member does the
same in a different area. "Figuring out how
to do things together is what's important to
both people in this partnership," Diane
Anderson, the faculty member who aids in
the administration of the program, said.
Pierce and Hammond began working
together during the fall of 2000 when Pierce
expressed her interests in learning more
about photography. "I've been taking pictures since my grown children were small,"
she said. "When I heard about Learning for
Life almost four years ago, I thought it was
very exciting. I knew I could do photography and go further with it."
Hammond has done serious photography and film development since her sopho-

more year in high school. Currently a
member of the student photography club,
she heard about the Learning for Life from
a friend who had participated in it. "I
thought it would be great to break down the
waU between staff and students," she said.
"We see Environmental Services workers
every day, but we never really get to know
them or talk to them."
Now, after 18 months together, the partnership is realizing its greatest goal. "I'm
so thrilled we are ending on this high note,"
Hammond said. "I really wanted Sharon to
have this experience before I graduated."
Pierce's part of the exhibit contains 30 of
her photographs, which she took with her
Canon Rebel 2000 camera. She has chosen
15 black and white close-ups of children and
15 color photos from the 2001 Philadelphia
Flower Show. Pierce and Hammond have
worked closely in developing Pierce's pho-

tography style.
Pierce's photography revolves around
keeping pictures as lasting impressions and
memories. One of her biggest regrets, she
said, is that when she was a child, "my parents did not take any pictures."
Now, children. are one of Pierce's
favorite subjects. In the exhibit, it is evi-

dent that Pierce loves children and their
facial expressions. "I really like doing close
-ups because you can see everything more,"

March 2% 2002

she explained. "I chose children because
their facial reactions really mean a lot to
me. I have a big family, and I'm always
around children in my daily life."
Her color photographs focus on the contrast of colors she noticed at the flower
show. Pierce explained that she chose those
photographs for the representation of color.
Some of them provide a stark contrast
between the colors of the flowers and the
model placed in the display. Others show
the multitude of colors present in certain
floral arrangements.
Pierce and Hammond are both really
excited about this exhibit. For Pierce, the
exhibit is the culmination of one of her
greatest

working

experiences

at

Swarthmore. "We've had this planned out
since last year. Carly's been encouraging
me to do this for a while," she said.
She is happy to have been a part of
Learning for Life since almost the beginning, and it is this attitude that the gallery
exhibit will reveal to the rest of the college.
"Most of the time," Pierce said, "my job is
really just cleaning. But when I found out
about this program and started my partnership, it made me happier to come to work.
I've found that it changes people's attitudes
at work. The three hours a week working
together with a student makes everyone a
little more relaxed when they work."

An encounter with the Maiden of Spring

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY JOEY SPADOLA
jspadoll@swarthmore.edu
"Spring," proclaimed some poetic soul of yore, at a time
of year not unsimilar, presumably, to that at which we find
ourselves, "has sprung." It is a curious fact that it has never
struck the human fancy, by obvious analogy, to say, on the
advent of autumn, that fall has fallen. Just as flowers and
plants spring up during the one season, giving the wordplay
a very natural justification, so leaves and foliage fall during
the other, making the suggested catch phrase no less sub-

lime.

But why we do not, in the fall, say the fall has fallen, or
any other such lyrical thing, is not difficult to comprehend.
The spring is a poetic, the fall a dull, season. The vernal
breezes breathe into the soul that miraculous afflatus which
gives life to poesy and to creation, whereas the leaves of
autumn, however various their colors, cannot but make us
yawn. During spring, some cord is struck in the rhythm
center of the spirit, so that we are more inclined
we
indeed are compelled not only to stand eggs on end at the
equinox, but to frolic, to create, to live.
But however fit the spring may be for frolicking and creating, it is, for work and industry, the worst of the tri-month
intervals. Who can read of the cardio-vascular capacity of
the hummingbird in a dusty biology text while that happy
creature chirps animatedly outside a nearby window? Who
can trace, by stuffy mathematical calculation, the galactic
course of the stars, while these divine lights illuminate the
noctes amoenae and shed a mystical glow on the splendid
scene of growth and proliferation which is just now taking
place on this orb everywhere one bends his gaze?
I may surprise those who know me by expressing such
sentiments; for it has always been my custom to scorn those
who cannot
put from mind the wonders of
or will not
nature in order that their thoughts might not roam from the
studious path. But a profound and strange occurrence of
recent issue has forever struck from me all traces of my

former puritanical creed.
I was in my room, perusing the pages of a mathematical
text, or some such ponderous volume, when my mind,
unusually but not unnaturally, began to wonder. A warm
wind ruffled the curtains of my window, and the sun rays,
as if by invitation, alighted gently upon my face. I was put
in a fanciful mood, and the idea took me to climb out upon
the balcony onto which my window opens, and which rises
above the courtyard of my dormitory.
There I lay down and, from the height of three stories, I

surveyed with a lazy eye the concourse of students below.
The hypnotizing regularity of their movement, the desultory breeze that wafted to my nose, the ambrosial scents of the
blooming flowers, the sweet accents in which a nearby dove
sang his lay, the continuous radiance with which the sun
all concerted to produce an atmosdisplayed his beams
phere of an extremely soporific character. My eyelids, growing heavier by rapid degrees, resisted all effort to impede
their downward career. I nodded once, twice, thrice and
then, with the added help of a spotless conscience, I fell precipitously into that strange but familiar realm of which

Sleep is sovereign.
The spring air began without delay to operate upon my
sleeping fancy, and I found myself suddenly plunged into a
profound dream state. There opened before my mind's eye
as my body lay in peaceful slumber on the balcony
a
world of magnificent beauty and splendor. Every detail,
every last particular of the dreamt scene had about it something of the divine, such as no canvas or quill could ever
reproduce. Perhaps only the prophet Isaiah, in describing
the perfection of the terram novum which awaits believers,
has come tolerably close to displaying adequate powers of
description. But even what he had of eloquence he owed
solely to the Lord.
I found myself, I say, in a strangely beautiful world.
Draped about me in grand profusion was a velvety cloth
marvelous to behold and still more so to touch. A melody of
the richest tenor hovered, as on a cloud, above the golden
structures which in every direction, as far as the sight could
distinguish, abounded gorgeously. The pervasive scent of
delicious incense stole upon me and put my senses in thrall.
The principal color of the scene was white a white of the
such white as can be associated only with
purest shade
the angelic. And the light, emanating as it seemed from
every quarter, was so radiant and candid that it would have
done harm to the eyes, if harm could be done in such a
world.
I felt in this wondrous place that I was every inch a god
and reveled like Apollo in the splendor which involved me.
But I had not been too long occupied in this pleasant diversion, when there sprang into my purview a creature whose
supernal loveliness I gasp merely to recall. Her mere gaze
arrested the operation of my every limb. The poet experienced sentiments of a very similar kind who wrote:
"Her presence was as lofty as her state; / her beauty of
that overpowering kind, / Whose force description only
would abate: / I'd rather leave it much to your own mind, /
Than lessen it by what I could relate / Offorms and features;

Audrey Chan Phoenix Staff

it would strike you blind / Could I do justice to the full
detail; / So luckily for both my phrases fail."
She addressed herself as the Maiden of Spring. She spoke
in a tongue resembling none I know or have heard; yet I
could comprehend without difficulty the euphonious
cadences that composed her speech, the substance of which
was, as best as I can remember it, the following.
She asked me what business I had in ensconcing myself
in the library and studying, while she took so much trouble
to give mortals a taste of the divine, while she orchestrated
the budding of velvety roses and the sunsets of ruddy hue,
while she awoke in every ardent youth "la poesia nascente
del cuerpo"
the nascent poetry of the body
and invested each midday scene, each feature of a lover's countenance, each savory scent borne by the passing zephyr, with
a beauty unrivalled by all that Adam's brood may know. In
the hills and valleys, in the rills and brooks, in the ardent
there, and not in
sunshine and the soothing moonlight,
libraries or in lecture halls, lies happiness.
"It is spring," concluded the fiery-eyed maid. "To be
nineteen, to have a poetic soul, to be in love: Is there anything more sublime? Leave your dull study, and follow the
ambrosial path to bliss which I have wrought for you."
Hereupon she gave me a chaste kiss, right upon the
brow; and I awoke to the warbling of birds.

In theaters and in films, time travel is truly tedious
BY MORGHAN HOLT

mholtl@swarthmore.edu

"•■

I spent spring break in Podunk Havre,
Montana, a very rural, very isolated town of
approximately 6,000. Things are a little
backwoods in my hometown, not terribly
technologically advanced and not yet overrun by franchise establishments. Usually, I
think this is a good thing. I prefer supporting small, independently owned and operated businesses over, say, shopping at WalMart. Be that as it may, I still cringed at the
thought of seeing a movie at home.
The theater is independently owned and
operated, but it's also a trip back in time,
technologically. The only aspect of the
theater that allows it a semblance of modernity is its adherence to, and outrageous
increase on, today's inflation rates.
"I'm sorry. I gave you a twenty. You have
my student I.D. I should have $14.50 in
change."
"Oh, student 1.D., huh? Never did see one
uh them there things. Ain't no student rates
in these parts. All seats, all shows $7.25. Can
I git ya any candy or popcorn or pop today,

ma'am?"
OK. $7.25 is ridiculous. I know I said I
liked supporting small businesses, but not
when they rob me blind. Give me the bracefaced, acne-ridden aloof teenager in the
hugely overwhelming multiplex swarming
with giggling gaggles of hotpants-wearing,
glittery-faced preteen females and baggie-

and total lack of wall-mounted hand driers.
As Guy Pearce's Alexander Hartdegen, the
epitome of the absent-minded professor,
scribbled physics equations on his blackboard, circa 1900, in his attempt to build a
time machine that would allow him to travel back in time and erase the death of his
beloved, I fantasized that I had traveled
back in time. Only I hadn't managed, as he
did, to end up where I'd intended. Through
some glitch of my imaginary time machine,
I had landed in this prehistoric cinema,
circa about the same time.
My personal fantasy was about as likely
as half the garbage presented in "The Time

Courtesy Dreamworks

I made my way down the aisle of the
small theater (seats, um, maybe 65) and
plopped down into a threadbare seat in the
back, issuing a surprising billow of dust and

discovering that the springs that at one time
acted to support audience asses had all but
deteriorated in not one, but two, three, four,
the entire row of seats. Grand.
It was terribly fitting for me to watch
Simon Wells' "The Time Machine" in this
rundown excuse for a movie theater with its

Machine" and was vastly more cohesive and
explicable. Not unlike my personal leastfavorite too-hyped-up film of all time, "The
Matrix," "The Time Machine" started with
the fagade ofa decent, captivating plot. Once
the time machine was built, however, the
whole thing went to hell. With no explanation ofhow or when or with what resources
the thing was built, this masterful ball of
gadgets and contraptions emerged from
behind a blood-red velvet curtain, only
slightly less ancient than that I had pushed
past on my way into the theater. And then it
was all special effects and computer animation and way too much investment in eye
candy, at the expense of brain candy, or
even anything tying one clip of the plot to
the next.
Thrust into the future, Alexander found
that the moon had fallen to pieces, leaving

March 21, 2002

the whole earth essentially in flames. Even
farther ahead, the human race branched,
mutated on one end of the spectrum into a
strange, cannibalistic hellbeast that lurked
in caves shaped like dinosaur skulls, morphed through the sand on the beaches and
gobbled up, at random, the other end of the
spectrum, a primitive people who lived in
bamboo houses strapped to the sides of
mountains with some fibrous lashes and
hunted and gathered their food.
This anti-technology paradigm could
have been good, I guess, if it were actually a
focus of the film. Instead, it sat, full of
potential, wasted while images of fireballs
and man-eating beast-things barreling
through underground tunnels filled the
screen, no comment on or statement about
anything other than the fact that the folks
behind the film knew that hot effects are
really all it takes to draw a good-sized, $7.25a-seat-paying crowd. That's a statement in
itself.
I was still waiting for an answer to the
question, "Why can't we change the past?"
posited at the beginning of the movie and
obsessed over throughout. Depressed by the

anticlimax of the ridiculous bloodbath of an
ending, I slunk from the antediluvian caverns of the theater back into the semi-contemporary world of microchips, Big Macs
and neon signs advertising all-nite casinos

To be perfectly honest, although the music on this record is
certainly evocative and at timesbeautiful, I have this sneak-

"Is A Woman" is a collection of intricately crafted
nuggets of jazz-pop and lounge-balladry, slowed down to a

Anyway, this is great. We get to

months ago, but have you heard a single thing about it? I certainly haven't.
I suppose what's actually in is not
Prince himself, but nostalgia for the
Prince of yesteryear. Well, fine. But
the record industry must be reaping
some sort of sales benefit from all of
this retro-purple hoopla, besides just
back-catalog sales. Sure enough, there
is a poorly thought out, newly repackaged hits collection, "The Very Best of
Prince," out on Warner Brothers last
summer, that seems completely superfluous next to the excellently produced
Hits/B-Sides package (which was
released ten years ago, about the time
Prince more or less dropped off the
contemporary pop-culture map). But
somewhat more notable, in the interests of achieving (to borrow a phrase

from anthropological theorist Jacques
Fabian) "intersubjective time" with
Prince, are a brace of "tribute" records
that have come out recently.

For the unfamiliar, these often suspect releases feature "up-and-coming"
(read: unknown) artists offering their
own renditions of selections from the

oeuvre of a "legend" in hopes of both
increasing their own recognition and
furthering the legacy of the original
artist. There are probably all sorts of
interesting things we could say about
THE PHOENIX

ture, to be sure, but it's almost perfunctory: The chords
gradually sidle by, but the listener is so rapt or wrapped in
the exquisite details
a sonic palette somehow both lush
and sparse
as to barely notice them.
This temporal warping creates an appropriate underscore for the true focus of the album: head 'chopper Kurt
Wagner's clipped, thoughtful, spoken-sung delivery of his
abstruse, mod-poetic free verse. "A Siamese is lonely also /
and I've been waiting all my life / in spite of this arrangement / moderation on vacation / it's time we all settled
down," he intones on the lovely "I Can Hardly Spell My
Name." Now, those words just don't make a lot of concrete
sense, even though they somehow manage to form an excellent complement to the "music." Wagner sings them so slowly that, by the time one line comes around, you've already
had plenty of time to forget the previous one, so there's no
need for a logical connection. Although it all hovers around
a lyrical and sonic locus, each of the elements approaching
a similar sense of calm, pensive, bemused reflection, everything fails to cohere. You can put it on and just sort of revel
and lose yourself in the haze, but only specific, discrete,
individual elements ever manage form a connection.
For instance, the textural centerpiece for the album
could be something as simple as the plosion of the final "p"
in an utterance of the word "periscope" (in the song
"Flick"). And then there's the sublimely surreal moment,
the album's final incongruity, which comes a few minutes
into the closing title track. After a piano-based introduction
in keeping with style of the rest of the album, an unexpected timbale fill leads into a lilting reggae shuffle. And the
words: "is a woman, write this down / put the paper over
there / more than it is / no more than it is," turn into an
anthemic sing-along chorus in the grand tradition of "Hey
Jude" and "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye." Only, what
were those words again? I thought so. Odd, odd, odd.

By

tribute records from an anthropological standpoint. From a musical standpoint, though, they are more often than
not disappointing.
Apparently, somebody or something
called sexykinkyjazzysmooth put out a
"Tribute 2 Prince" last September, featuring some versions by Solomon
Burke Jr. Yo La Tengo bassist James
McNew, working under his side-project
pseudonym
Dump,
dropped
an
absolutely fabulous album of tres 10-fi
Prince covers on Shrimper last year,
entitled "That Skinny Motherfucker
with the High Voice" (seriously, if this
at all interests you, I highly recommend
it). And now this
"If I Was Prince:
The Tribute Album," on the completely
unheard-of imprint Rex Records.
What have we here? The first track,
if this gives you any indication, is

Dancer" as rendered by "7 Hurtz
with Peaches and Bitch Lap Lap." No,
you really don't want to hear that
it's just some cheap disco beatbox overlaid with a pointless, embarrassing
dialogue
between
incorrigible
sleazepot Peaches and somebody else,
presumably Miss Lap Lap. Later on, we
have such treats as Simian's dirge-like,
twisted-circus ballad reading of
"Under the Cherry Moon" and an elec"Sexy

tro-burble-bump-cum-Finnish-whiteboy-spoken-word take on "If I Was Your
Girlfriend" by Op:l Bastards, which
manages to be even more bizarre than
the original. Right. That one's actually
a good song. Never mind, it only used
to be a good song.
That's the problem with a lot of

these tracks and with tribute albums
in general. They only remind you how
good the
original tunes were.
Unsurprisingly, then, the best cuts
here are those which don't stray far
from Prince's versions, like Misty
Dixon's "The Beautiful Ones"
she
lets the gorgeous melody stand essentially on its own, with minimal glock-

Ahoy, matey!

The romance of the ocean, the salty air well, figure it
this way: At least you don't have to swab the deck. Watch
history come alive at the Independence Seaport Museum
...

at Penn's Landing.

The museum features exhibits such as "Selections from
the Collection: Something for Everyone," which has interesting and unusual seaworthy pieces from the museum's
collection.
Also at the museum are the Cruiser Olympia (CA-6) and
Submarine Becuna (SS-319). Olympia served in the
Spanish-American War (that's right, in 1898!) and was
under the command of Commodore George Dewey during
the Olympia's battle with the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay,
Philippines. If you recognize the quote, "You may fire
when you are ready, Gridley," you should try out for

"Jeopardy!"
If not, you'll still be interested to know that Commodore
Dewey said this to the ship's captain during that battle. At
the other edge of the spectrum, we find Submarine Becuna,
which served in World War II and the Cold War. Becuna
was active in both the Pacific and Atlantic throughout
both wars.

211 S. Columbus Blvd., Philadelphia, (215) 925-5439.
Admission for museum exhibitions, Cruiser Olympia and

News
Committee will codify college's privacy beliefs
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

From PRIVACY, pg. 3
Services, has added a short clause to say that messages
cannot be intercepted or monitored "except by information services professionals in the normal course of maintaining the college's networks and systems."
The area in which the committee will work includes

communication among members of the Swarthmore community, presently defined as telephone calls, voice mail
messages and e-mail. Student records, transcripts and file
servers are beyond the present scope of the committee,
though it may recommend that subsequent committees
explore these areas. It will also gather information about
how the college handles the transmission of network data
other than e-mail.

"We want to ensure the community
that personal communication is as
private as can be."
Judy Downing, ITS director
Salmon said he believes all network traffic should be
protected, including all e-mail messaging, not just
Swatmail. Right now, any Web-based e-mail system other
than Swatmail is not protected by the current policy.
"I'd really like to see all Web traffic, including Web
surfing and instant messaging, fall under one cohesive
privacy policy," he said.

The committee also made the important distinction
between monitoring and surveillance. "We monitor systems, not individuals," said Mark Dumic, manager of networking and systems.
The passage of the U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act in Oct. 2001
also contributed to Maurer's desire for the committee's
formation. The act, whose name is an acronym for
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism, is intended to increase the amount of investigation and the range oflaw enforcement techniques available to prevent and punish terrorist activity in the United
States.

According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, some
of the provisions of the U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act have a direct

request for student e-mail.
"The issue is how best

to hold to our usual
Swarthmore standards of protecting privacy given the
technology," Maurer said.
Downing said that a firewall sets the college campus
off from the rest of the Internet. The device examines
every network datum that passes through it according to
a set ofrules. "We want to ensure the community that personal communication is as private as can be," she said.
Some internal monitoring does occur. "We actively
monitor in real time," Systems Administrator Adam
Preset said. In the course of monitoring, he watches for
logging in to the mail server, login time-out problems and
students exceeding the quota for file server space. Several,
failed logins in a row can indicate someone deliberately
trying to access an e-mail account that is not his or her
own. Present does sometimes decode passwords as part of
the regular process of logging. He also maintains logs of
computer viruses in the system and tries to prevent junk
e-mail from entering the network.

impact on college information technology.
For instance, federal agents can use a "trap and trace"
mechanism to obtain data sent by wire or electronic communication. They can also implement tools to intercept
and gather information from Internet transfers.
"Given that it's a law, we are
required to follow it," Maurer said.
"The issue is how much leeway there
is. Colleges can have their own inter4 bedroom apartment in a
pretation, and the committee might be

Staff hold different
views on wage increase
From WAGE, pg. 3
'"No, not really," he said. "That's not why I got this job." Ermel
works from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and from
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays. He gets weekends, breaks and summers off,
and after 33 years working for the Boeing Corporation, his job at the
bookstore was for "fun," a "fill-in."
When asked about the wage increase, Ermel said that, from his
he "can't complain about it. But I don't have to put the
food on the table. That's not why I have this job."
Joyce Watson's job as a Tarble cashier also is not meant to support a family on its own. Her husband, fortunately, works at the post
office, making well above what Watson makes. The five-year
employee is among the about 50 staffers whose wage will increase to
$9, since it's presently below that.
"I think it's pretty fair," she said of the increase. "I don't know if
it's practical. It's hard to run a house on that." She stopped then, and
a look of contemplation crossed her face. "It would be a plus," she
then she
said of
9 hourly wage. "But with the market now
stopped again, and said, "Oh, God, don't I sound like I'm with the
administration." Then, grinning, she repeated a word she had used
at least five times to describe the increase. "It's fair," she said.
Several staffers accepted other forms of compensation, such as
free college classes and the popular Learning for Life, as viable
alternatives to monetary wages and various forms of benefits. Still,
Kathy Grace, the same bookstore director who hired Ermel, did not
think it should be a substitute.
"I think the majority of people on campus would certainly benefit from these programs," she said. "But if you're making $9 and try
to keep a household—Learning for Life might help you get a better
job down the line, but it's not going to put dinner on the table
tonight."
Grace had words of praise for the compensation at the college
more generally.
"Compared to the outside world, I think that Swarthmore is better or equal," she said. For 10 years, Grace held the same position at
Philadelphia University, and before that she worked at
Elizabethtown College. She gave one word in response to the wage
increase: "Wow."
But not all shared that sentiment.
Sloman took a long look around the political science office,
thinking. "I love working here. Don't get me wrong. It's a great
atmosphere," she said at last. "But do I think we're justly compensated? No, I do not."

Earthworms advance to First Wave finals
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
The men's ultimate Frisbee team kicked
off its spring break trip with yet another
loss to the eventual tournament-winning
team. This time, however, the team lost in
the final game, dropping a 13-12 nail-biter

to the University of Virginia at the First

Wave Tournament in Savannah, Ga.
The Earthworms had several chances to
break the 12-12 tie themselves, but they fell
short. "We got a couple of turnovers from
them, but couldn't quite put it in," Misha
Horowitz 'O3 said. "We also dropped one
pass in the end zone." That pass was a
potential game winner.

Final matches usually require teams to
win by two points. But this game required
only a one-point cushion, because it began
at 4 p.m. and the teams did not want the
looming darkness to be a factor in the outcome.

The highlight of the match was a gamesaving defensive play by Paul Wulfsberg
'O3, which Horowitz termed "one of the best
D's I've ever seen." Wulfsberg sprinted to
catch up with his man and then jumped for
the incoming disc, using his height to
knock it down at its peak. Wulfsberg was
also consistent throughout the tournament. He "had several outstanding defen-

sive plays on hucks into the end zone,"
Slezak 'O2 said. Hucks are long,
downfield passes.
Both Horowitz and Slezak added that the
team was happy with its performance at the
tournament. The Earthworms were 7-1 overall, notching victories against talented

to play Emory for a chance to advance to

the upper bracket. The Earthworms found
themselves in a 12-8 hole but managed to tie
the game at 12, thanks to the defense of
John Anderson 'O3. "He kept us in the
game," Slezak said. "He guarded the best

player we've seen all year." Anderson
could not carry the team to victory, and the
squad lost 13-12.

The Earthworms will be idle this weekend, but they will participate in the Layout
Pigout Tournament at Haverford the following weekend. The tournament will feature top teams and a Saturday afternoon
all-star game.
The team hopes to carry its momentum
from spring break to Layout Pigout and
beyond. Horowitz thinks the Garnet have a
solid chance of qualifying for nationals,
given that they nearly qualified last year.
The team finished third in the region last
year, failing to secure one of the region's
two bids for nationals. This year, however,
the region will have a third nationals bid.
"Having a third bid this year is definitely an advantage," Slezak said. "But the
teams in the region are stronger than
they've been in the past. I'm somewhat optimistic that we can put in a good showing"
at regionals.

BY KATHRYN JANTZ
kjantzl@swarthmore.edu
The women's lacrosse team returned from Roanoke,
Va., with a win under its belt and a long weekend at
Smith College on the horizon. The game versus the
College of Notre Dame of Maryland yesterday was postponed due to weather. The lacrosse season is under way,
and players' excitement for a good season is undeniable.
The Garnet routed Hollins University 17-3.
According to tri-captain Katie Tarr 'O2, the Hollins
team was not very good, but they had five "or six decent
players. Tarr scored seven goals and had two assists. This
marked her career achievement of 201 goals "and has put
her in a tie for second on the Garnet's career scoring list
with Holly Baker '99. The senior needs just 17 goals to
eclipse the Centennial Conference record of 217 career
goals set by Haverford's Lindsey Carey in 2000. Tarr was
named to the Centennial Conference Honor Roll for her
performance.
The rounded Garnet offense had six players tickle the
twine, while tri-captain Mavis Biss 'O2 added four goals

and one assist.

On the other end of the field, the defense limited
Hollins to just 18 shots compared with the Tide's 43.
Heather Kile 'O2 let the effort with four pass interceptions
and four ground balls.
Returning Centennial Conference First Team goalie
Jenn Hart 'O3 had 11 saves, good for a 78 save percentage.
She leads the conference in goalkeeping this week and is
the main reason behind Swarthmore's leading the conference in scoring defense.
The 2002 squad boasts an unusually large 30 players.
The Hollins game was an opportunity for the entire

improved, working together better and building confidence as a team.
This weekend, the six beginners on .the team are facing their first tournament, the annual Seven Sisters
Tournament at Smith. "I am really excited about the
tournament, because there is already a healthy rivalry
between the teams," Biss said. "This tournament is particularly special, because our team has established rituals that make it a more fun and competitive environment."
The annual tournament includes Haverford, Bryn
Mawr, Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, Mt. Holyoke and
Swarthmore. This, year, Smith invited an eighth team,
Western New England, to participate. The Garnet will
play three games, two on Saturday and one on Sunday.
First up for the Tide is Western New England at 11 a.m.
on Saturday. Depending out the outcomes of the first
round game, Swat will face either Haverford or Smith in

the afternoon.

The team hopes the off-the-field experiences this
weekend will add to its cohesion from Roanoke. On
Saturday night, the women will attend the annual banquet where all the players from the different teams intermix. The six-hour bus ride and skit activities will allow

the team to pull together.
The team hopes its size and skill will add to the
amount of excitement and energy it pours into the games.
It is difficult to make 30 women work in cohesive unit,
but through teamwork and individual sacrifice, the
Swarthmore team is working toward its goal. According
to Tarr, "It's a great group of people, so you don't have to
work to get to like each other."

After facing a difficult schedule over spring break, the
reigning Centennial. Conference Champions return to the
tennis court focused and prepared for the 2002 season.
The Garnet Tide faced the stiffest 'competition of the
year on their South Atlantic road trip, falling to four
nationally ranked Division 111 opponents, including the
No. 2 team in the nation, the Emory Eagles.
"The team really came together over spring break," cocaptain Anjani Reddy 'O4 said. "We played the toughest
teams we'll play all season."
Reddy, Swarthmore's top seed, led the Tide and finished
with three of their five individual victories. The AllAmerican from Ogden, UT, defeated Mary Washington's
top seed Steff Slaughter, 6-4, 6-1, and Salisbury State's No. 1
player, 6-2, 6-3. She also teamed with fellow co-captain
Kristina Pao 'O4 to defeat Mary Washington's No. 1 doubles
team of Slaughter and Karli Schneider 8-3.
The two remaining victories came from newcomer
Katie Berry 'O5, who defeated her fourth-seeded Methodist
opponent Christie Noble, 6-45> 6-2, and second-seeded Pao,
who defeated her Salisbury State opponent in a dramatic
tiebreaker, 6-2, 7-6 (7-s)."Kristina Pao conies through in big

moments,"

Berry

said.

Despite opening the 2002 season with a 0-4 record, the
Garnet Tide appear unaffected by the lack of wins. "I don't
think the losses got us down much," Berry said. "We
played a lot of great teams and we enjoyed the challenge."
Swarthmore will begin its conference schedule this'
week with only two upperclassmen on its roster, co-captain Laura Swerdlow 'O2 and three-year veteran Katherine
Voll 'O3. "We're a young team," Reddy said, "but we have
gained a lot of good freshmen this year."
The squad expects talented newcomer Megan Speare 'O5
to fill in for the injured Caroline Celano 'O4, who finished
her rookie season with an 11-1 record but decided not to play
this season. Celano is one of several players not returning
for the Tide, including former co-captain Fran Simonds 'O2.
"I think it's better for me to sit out the season and come
back next year when I'm healthy," said Celano. "I think
school work is a big factor for myself and several of the.
other players not returning this year."
In fact, the Tide's biggest opponent may be
Swarthmore's overwhelming academic workload.
"Obviously, academics comes first," Reddy said. Because
of academic scheduling conflicts, she said, "rarely have we
had all our players at a match."
Despite the team's youth, loss of players and academic
commitments, the team aims to open its regular season

focused and

prepared.'Anjani Reddy and Kristina Pao are
great leaders, and they inspire us to work hard," Berry said.
Nine-year head coach Dan Sears and first-year assistant
coach Mike Goldsmith are also instilling a hard work ethic
into the team. "We're a lot more disciplined this year,"
Reddy said. "Coach Mike makes sure everyone comes to
practice on time, and we do footwork drills at the end of
every practice."

The team takes on Centennial Conference rival
Marshall this Friday in Lancaster, Pa.

Men's lax finding offense, just in time
Tide explodes for
17 goals in victory
over Elizabethtown
BY JUSTIN KANE
ikanel@swarthmore.edu
With the start of the Centennial
Conference season looming on the horizon,
the Garnet Tide's offense has finally hit its
stride.

John Murphy 'O3 and Joseph DeSimone
led Swarthmore with five goals apiece,
pacing the Tide to a 17-10 victory over nonElizabethtown

Wednesday.

Despite

sloppy

weather,

Swarthmore's offense controlled the flow of
the game, putting up enough points to keep
the Blue Jays at a distance.
The third quarter proved the turning
point for the Tide, as they broke open a
tight 6-4 halftime lead with a seven-goal
period. The offense opened up, moving the
ball better and retaining possession longer.
By the end of the quarter, the Tide had

built a seven-goal lead.
"The weather was a bit of a problem at
first," said midfielder John Cleaver 'O4,
who notched two goals. "Biit we had a lead,
and we wanted to bury them at the beginning of the second hah*."
And bury the Blue Jays the Tide did,
relying on the goals from Murphy and
DeSimone as well as a balanced midfield
attack. Captain Blake Atkins 'O2 recorded
two goals and an assist, and midfield
teammates Than Court 'O3 and Tim
Chryssikos 'O5 each contributed a goal and
an assist. Freshman attacker Jeff Donlea

Women ruggers take down Bryn Mawr-Haverford
Despite a roster filled with rookies, the women's rugby team
easily recorded a 24-5 victory with its athleticism and speed
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
Women's rugby launched its spring season with a
blowout win over the Bryn Mawr-Haverford Horned Toads
on Saturday, March 9.
Swarthmore's A-side won 24-5, notching four tries and
two extra points. The teams decided not to play a B-side
game because many Garnet players were away for spring
break.
"We only had half of the team that would normally
start," flyhalf Sarah Nusser 'O2 said. "We missed lots of key

forwards." Among those who could not attend were

THE PHOENIX

Adrienne Fowler 'O3 and Aja Peters- Mason 'O4.
Because the team was short-handed at that position and
because the Horned Toads have a talented crop of forwards, Swarthmore tried to dominate the game with the
speed and athleticism of its backline.
The plan succeeded, as outside center Katie Harper 'O2
scored two tries. On the first play of the game, she cut back
and broke away from a handful of Horned Toad defenders.
She then outran Bryn Mawr-Haverford's entire backline,
covering over half the field on her trip to the endzone.
"Kate is really the MVP of the backs," Nusser said.
Scrum half Rabi Whitaker 'O3 also chipped in with a try,

breaking through the forwards on a push at the goal line.

March 2% 2002

Because the Garnet were short-handed, all of their
rookies got extensive playing time and important experience. "We have a number of rookies this spring season and
a lot of good ones" Nusser said. "So we're really excited

about that."
Swarthmore has dominated Bryn Mawr-Haverford in
recent years, but the win was impressive nevertheless.
The rookies' play exceeded expectations, especially at the
forward position, where the newcomers held their own
against a solid Horned Toad front line.
"Even though it wasn't the stiffest competition, I'm
pretty impressed with how we played," Nusser said.
"Often, at the beginning of the season, it's hard to play
well, because it's such a physical sport."
The team hosts the College of New Jersey this Saturday
at 11 a.m. Though the squad has a light schedule this
spring season, it should face a big challenge at the always
competitive Westchester Tournament in a few weeks.

Men's tennis splits 4 on Calif, break
Garnet defeat Foothill,
Sonoma St., but fall to
UC Davis and Berkeley
BY FRANK VISCIAIMO
*

fviscial@swarthmore.edu

Sure. Sun, sand and tans would be nice, or a midnight rendezvous with a few beer bottles and a nameless coed on some tropical beach. Yeah, that'd be all
right. But you know what we'd really like? Some
serious competition.
After dismantling six of its first seven NCAA
Division I opponents this spring, the Swarthmore
men's tennis team hopped a jet to northern Cal.,
where they were more likely to get a slight windburn
than a tan. But they found exactly what they wanted
stiff competition.
The Garnet found their first task up in the hills,
where Foothill College, a nationally-ranked junior
college, hosted them. Swarthmore humbly returned
the favor by handing the Owls a 7-2 loss. Led by
strong doubles play as well as impressive and timely
wins by Justin Singer 'O3, Frank Visciano 'O4 and
Joey Spadola 'O4, the Garnet made quick work of their
formidable opponent.
Swarthmore's next challenge was the UC Berkeley
B squad. Despite close matches at all six singles positions and an 8-5 doubles win by Mike Noreika 'O4 and
Ben Rae 'O4, the Garnet felt the other side of a beat-

down, ultimately succumbing 7-0.
But there was no time to mope. Fueled by innumerable bagels and chaperoned by the M and M
coaching squad of Mike and Marsha Mullan, the
Garnet took to wine country to avenge last year's loss
to NCAA Division II foe Sonoma State University.
With a last year's 9-0 loss fresh in mind, the team
stepped on the court prepared to do some damage.
After all three Swat doubles teams came up big
and jumped out to a 3-0 lead, the Garnet thought they
might just have a chance. But when Rae stepped off
the court no more than 20 minutes after he had started, taking with him an impressive 6-0, 6-0 rout and
leaving a stunned Sonoma opponent, the Garnet
knew it was their day. Despite an injured Justin
Singer 'O3 and close losses at the top and bottom of the
lineup by JohnThomas 'O2 and Aaron Rubin 'O4, wins
by Jayson Yost 'O3, Justin Durand 'O5 and Visciano
locked it up. The Garnet strolled away with another
decisive 7-2 win. Did somebody say booyah?
Swarthmore faced UC Davis in its final match,
eventually falling to a strong Davis team 8-L The lone
highlight once again came from "The Ben Rae Show,"
as he eked out a win, edging his opponent 10-8 in the
third set breaker. "Rae makes me happy," Noreika
said after Rae's victory.
Finishing with a couple wins and maybe even the
slightest hint of a tan, the Tide headed home to prepare for the start of their NCAA Division 111 schedule.
With firm confidence and must-win matches en route,
the squad looks to flex its muscles against the Div. 11l
field, starting this week against Salisbury State and
Mary Washington.

The team hosted the former at 5 p.m. last night.
Results were unavailable at press time. Swarthmore
will head to Mary Washington for a 1:30 p.m start on
Saturday.

Frank Visciano serves against his UC Berkeley B team opponent. Berkeley handily defeated Swarthmore, but the Garnet
handed out losses to top junior college Foothill College and Div. II Sonoma State.
