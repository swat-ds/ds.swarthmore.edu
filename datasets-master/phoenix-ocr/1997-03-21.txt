Chang-Muy Visits, Speaks on Gay Rights
By

Toki Rehder

On Tuesday, Fernando Chang-Muy, former Assistant
Dean of the College, returned to the Swarthmore campus
to give a lecture entitled "Gay Rights are Human Rights."
He described how the rights of gays and lesbians are
violated, and expressed the hope that learning about
such violations will not be just "an intellectual exercise," but will propel students to take action. "Some of
the things you take for granted as heterosexuals," he
said, "may not be taken for granted by gays and
lesbians."
Chang-Muy began by giving a brief history of the
concept of human rights. Although some scholars believe that the term originated as long ago as the 17th or
18th centuries, he began with the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which was signed by 78 countries
shortly after World War 11, and which became "the
standard against which we measure human rights."
Chang-Muy systematically examined how the rights
outlined in each of the 30 articles of the document are
violated with regard to gays and lesbians. He described
how the political, economic, social, and cultural rights of

gays and lesbians are violated throughout the world, with
emphasis on the United States.
In most parts of the U.S., the rights of gays and
lesbians are not protected unless the law directly states
that protection applies. Since gays and lesbians are not
considered a suspect class, they are often subject to
discrimination in housing and employment. Because
of legal precedents, especially the case Bowers v.
Hardwick, the courts do not even recognize the privacy
rights of gays and lesbians.
In a personal anecdote, Chang-Muy described how
difficult it was for him and his partner to adopt a girl, who
is now five years old, because of the obstacles placed in
the way of gay and lesbian couples. Also, even though
Article 16 of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights
states that "women and men offull age...have the right to
marry and found a family. They are entitled to equal
rights as to marriage, during marriage and its dissolution," this article is not applied to gay and lesbian adults.
Before coming to Swarthmore, Chang-Muy worked as
a Legal Officer with two United Nations agencies, where
he was responsible for the protection of refugees in
various countries and providing assistance to countries to

ensure non-discrimination of people with HIV/AIDS. He
also has served as consultant to a number of governmental and non-government organizations. He is the author
of a number of articles dealing with human rights, public
health, and refugees.
Last year, Chang-Muy left his position as Assistant
Dean of the College and is currently an Adjunct Professor
ofLaw at the University of Pennsylvania School ofLaw
where he teaches Immigration, Refugee Law and International Human Rights. Next year, Chang-Muy intends to
teach a class at Swarthmore on human rights as part of the
Peace and Conflict Studies program.
In two weeks, Chang-Muy intends to go on a mission
with Amnesty International to see how the U.S. naturalization service treats foreign deportees. His particular
interest is how gay and lesbian prisoners are treated.
The next lecture of the "Human Rights in Theory and
Practice" series will be on April 8. Entitled "Who Is the
'Human' in Human Rights? The Tensions between
International Standards and Cultural Diversity: The Case
ofWomen in Islam," the event will feature presentations
and discussions with two renowned scholars with contrasting views on the subject.

SQU Discusses Brochure, Queer Spec
Weekend with Admissions Office
By

Jess Roney

The Swarthmore Queer
Union (SQU) has been talking with the Deans of Admissions and of Housing to
work out policies to increase
awareness for potential students about the queer community on campus, in an attempt to match incoming queer students with
a roommate who will be "queer friendly."
These efforts are being led by the co-coordinators Becca Hover '99 and JoshFreker '99.
SQU has been working on the issue of
housing for some time now. They want to add
two new questions to the housing questionnaire sent out to all first-year students. One
question would essentially ask if the student
wanted to room with someone who was "queer
friendly"— that is, accepting of gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transsexual lifestyles. The second question would ask if the person considered themself to be queer friendly. They are
talking to Dean of Housing Myrt Westphal
and Dean of the College Ngina Lythcott to
try and implement these new questions.
SQU hopes to have these questions added
in timefor the class of 2001, but there are still
some problems left to work out. One is the
exact wording of the questions; the other is
what priority level these questions will have

in matching people up for
their rooms if other factors
are at odds. The proposal
came up last year but was
not put into action.
The objective in talking to
Admissions is to raise the
availability of information
about queer life at
Swarthmore for interested
students. SQU also discussed what measures
can be implemented with Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet. It has been agreed that
Mamlet will be sure to put a queer student on
panels and committees concerning student
life.
Mamlet has also agreed to e-mail all tourguides and hosts and ask them to mention
SQU to prospective students and to refer any
questions they may have to Hover or Freker;
she also will help organize a SQU informational lunch over Spec Weekend.
Other plans include looking over the contents of the viewbook to update any information that may be of use to queer students, and
to eventually produce a brochure on queer
life at Swarthmore. Until the brochure can be
printed up, copies of a letter written by SQU
with the same content as the brochure will be
displayed in the Admissions Office. The
brochure will include informationabout queer
life on campus and SQU's activities.

Faculty Leave
Options to
Benefit Students

Swarthmore's faculty leaveofabsenceprogram creates concern for students, especially
senior majors in smaller departments. The
Provost's Office and the administration are
currently using three types of faculty leave
systems in order to accommodate students
and to also maintain Swarthmore'scomparatively generous leave program as an incentive for prospective faculty.
Provost JennieKeith summed up the goals
of the College with regard to leave: "We try
to have a faculty that are both scholars and
teachers," says Keith. Swarthmore grants one
semester with full pay (or two semesters on
half pay) to faculty members once every four
years. In addition, many faculty members
receive grants from outside sources to pay for
the second semester of the year off, and the
College itself offers eight grants up for competition among the faculty. Keith said that
"the number of people who take the full year
varies a lot depending on outside funding."
Many other schools work on a seven year
cycle; Keith feels that the four-year plan
provides a strong incentive for applicants for
our faculty systems. Other advantages of
frequent leaves of absence include keeping
professors up to date within their field and
allowing them timefor independent research.
The College also "tries hard to encourage
research that students can be involved in,"
added Keith.
One of the major problems with the leave
program occurs when the number of leave
applicants becomes too unbalancedfrom year
to year, though this is naturally more pronounced when many applicants come from
smaller departments. In order to combat this
difficulty, Keith oversees leave implementation and helps to "smooth out unbalanced

departments."

actor EdWasser from television's

and Nat Anderson spoke on panels, and members of the Society
for Creative Anachronism
roamed campus giving armed
combat demonstrations.
While SWIL raised enough
money to cover its debts to the
college, there were some disappointments. Organizers had
hoped for 300-400 guests. Additionally, of those attending, approximately 50 were members of
Tri-Co and subsequently did not
pay for admission.This meant that

'95 will not be reimbursed for
the time being. However, Quale
hopes to cover the cost through
either later SWIL fund-raisers
or at next year's SWILcon.
Fortunately, Project Literacy
U.S. (PLUS) and the Comic
Book Legal Defense Fund, the
charities aided by the convention
will each receive about $2OO. Joel
McNary '9B, SWlLcon's other coordinator, says that the charities
benefited from the convention's
auction and cookbook sales, and
the income from these two events
had solely been reserved for the
two groups.
The largest expense for the
convention was Wasser, who
Quale say, accounted for "about
two thirds of the total budget."
At SWILcon '9B Quale andfellow
members hope to avoid similar expenses through omitting a media
personality and inviting "just a bigname writer and a big-name artist." Quale also hopes next year to

avoid conflicts with Lunacon, a
larger, more established convention which took place this
year on the same weekend as
SWILcon.
In the interim, SWTL members
will preparefor next year and "step
up both advertising to the college
and off-campus networking," says
Quale. He also wants to cement
more firmly SWTLcon's relationship with PhilCon, the Philadel-

phia science fiction/ fantasy convention. Even though the two have
not been officially linked, SWILcon
distributed over 200 fliers pertaining to Phil Con's bid to host the
penultimate Sci-Fi convention,
WorldCon in 2001.
Quale said that the most important factor was the fun the guests
had at SWILcon: "SWILcon was
in just about everybody's eyes a
success."

Sucheng Chan, professor and director
ofAsian AmericanStudies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, will
give a speech and conduct two workshops next Thursday, March 27, in the
Scheuer Room, Kohlberg Hall.
The first workshop, from 1 to 2:30
p.m., will discuss the challenges that
universities and colleges face when trying to institute an Asian American Studies program. Then, her lecture entitled
"Researching Asian American Women's
History: Pitfalls and Challenges," will
follow at 4:15 p.m. Finally from 7:30 to
9:30 p.m., Chan will conduct her second
workshop on ways students can study
Asian American subjects without formal

faculty direction.
Chan's lecture is the second in the
Genevieve Ching-wen Lee '96 Memorial Lecture series. The series was established by Lee's parents after her death in
August 1994. The memorial fund was
designed to help current students explore
Asian and Asian American studies. The
fund also provides two grants of $6OO

Former Swat Professor Speaks on Hong Kong
By

Jessica Harbour

On Wednesday evening, Professor Ming Chan of Hong
Kong University gave a talk titled "Hong Kong's Reintegration with China: The Challenge of 1997 and Beyond."
Professor Chan, who was the Cornell Visiting Professor at
Swarthmore during the 1993-94 academic year, spoke eloquently and informally about the history of Hong Kong up to
its expected July Ist transition from British colony to Chinese city and the potential problems of that transition.
Professor Chan, in the area for an internationallaw symposium at the University of Pennsylvania, was happy to see
former students in the crowd. He began his talk with a few
jokes, referring to Britain's Prince Charles, who will formally hand Hong Kong over to China, as "that no-good exhusband of Princess Di." But Professor Chan was quite
serious when he outlined the changes in Hong Kong since
Britain and China formally opened talks about the island's
future in 1982. Hong Kong, he explained, has been transformed through five different processes: decolonization,
localization, internationalization, democratization, and the
formation of a unique political identity. Hong Kong's economic growth has at times outpaced Britain's; Cantonese
Chinese became one of the official language; the residents no
longer think of themselves as subjects of Her Majesty's
Empire. Chan noted that July Ist will be about "not just

getting the British out ofHong Kong, but closing the big book on
foreign imperialism... once and for all, Hong Kong could belong
to the world and the world could come to Hong Kong without
being filtered through a British prism."
But tensions remain, he explained, between Hong Kong and
China. For one, Hong Kong residents supported the protesters of
Tiananmen Square in 1989, to the point of emptying out stores to
send the students camping gear. Moreover, any mishandling of
Hong Kong on China's part would only further alienate Taiwan.
He predicted that a successful reintegration would have to
depend on the "one country, two systems" formula articulatedby
the late Deng Xiaoping. "Chinese Communism could never be
the winner" no matter what happens to Hong Kong, he said. "It
is doomed to be the loser." After noting the tensions between
Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders, such as politician Martin
Lee, and Chinese officials, Professor Chan warned, "Beijing had
better be prepared to deal with the offspring—social freedom,
political democracy—of economic prosperity."
After his talk, Professor Chan answered questions from the
floor on related topics, such as the impact of Deng's death on
China-Hong Kong relations and the status of Vietnamese refugees hoping to enter Hong Kong. During the reception, he took
the opportunity to socialize with former students and promote his
new book, The Hong Kong Reader: Passage to Chinese Sovereignty, which he co-edited with Gerard A. Postiglione.

which is much more prevalent. Feelings are
more of an issue when dealing with academic
mediation. "It isn't so cut and dry as business
mediation. Here it is more that you are dealing with the humanistic aspect," said Cobo.
The goals of the program are not yet entirely clear. They do not yet know in what
capacity the newly trained mediators will be
used. "We trained faculty, students and staff,"
said Westphal. "Ideally, we would like to be
able to settle disputes from any of those three
groups." But Westphal is not sure if that will
ever become practice. "We have to figure out
what will work within this community, its
culture and its rules and regulations."
One definite goal is to extend the program
to students. Cobo envisions a phone line
which students would contact to deal with
conflicts. Two mediators will be assigned to
each case, and between them will attempt to
settle the dispute, making both sides happy.
The program is still in its infancy, but there
are plans of grandeur for mediation on campus. "We are doing some cases now, but our
goal is to really get going next fall," said
Cobo.
"Right now our main objective is to build a
foundation for this program," said Hanson.
"In order for it to be a well-founded and
permanent program, we need to get the community aware of the possibility of mediation." This will be done, according to Hanson,
by distributing brochures to the entire campus, then going to dorms and departmental
meetings, making everyone aware that this
service is available. Eventually, they would
like to incorporate it into RA training and

While much of the College was off for a
little rest and relaxation over spring break, a
handful of students, staff, and faculty were
learning a new skill on campus. Several members of the Swarthmore community received
mediation training over spring break.
The program, headedbyAssistantDean Anna
Maria Cobo, Director ofResidentialLife Myrt
Westphal,Registrar Martin Warner, and Coordinator of Student Activities Jen Leigh, spent
three days educating its participants about how
to help setde disputes amongst members of the
College community.
Swarthmore has had some sort of a mediation program for some time, according to
Westphal. She noted that there had been no
official training for "two or three years," so
until break, of thosewho had received mediation training, only a few staff were still at the
College.
This year, the program was changed to
better suit Swarthmore's atmosphere, said
Cobo. Professors Joe Folger and Trisha Jones
from Temple University led workshops dealing with many aspects of academic mediation. Folger and Jones are from Temple's
Communication Sciences department, and
maintain a mediation program at Temple that
Swarthmore is trying to emulate.
Seventeen students and 28 total would-be
mediators participated in the program. "This
is not just a student group," said Cobo. They
participated in workshops such as mediating
strategies, third party mediations, the nature
of mediation, the mediator's duty, phases of
successful mediation, dealing with anger,
and co-mediation.

UC Colorado Students Lie to Appear on TV Talk Shows
By Laura

Baker

(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo.—Emerging from a limousine, he made his way backstage to rehearse his dance
moves, inflate his ego and polish a story made of lies.
Steve-O, as his friends call him, prepared to talk the talk
with former talk show host Carnie Wilson.
Talk shows have been criticized for inviting guests on
their shows under false pretenses.
Some courageous people, however, have turned the
tables on talk shows by creating their own lies to get on
national TV.
Steve Blincoe, a sophomore kinesiology maj or [at U. of
Colorado], is part of a rising number of college students
who make up controversial stories to appear on national
TV. "I was just going to talk smack to my friend on stage,"
Blincoe said. "They told us to catfight."
CU students have lied to
appear on talk shows in exchange for trips to New York
City. Other students think the
idea of lying is absolutely
fascinating and are willing to
try it out themselves.
Students and experts think
that talk shows are designed
to fit the trend. Janice Peck, a
professor in the School of
Journalism and Mass Communication who has written
scholarly articles about the
talk show phenomenon, said
it has become fairly common for people to lie to get on
talk shows.
"You get your 15 minutes of fame," Peck said. "That's
why people scam. For some people, it's a chance for
others to pay attention to them. Blincoe, who appeared on
an episode of the Carnie Wilson Show called "Believe It
Or Not...You're Not That Hot," said his motive was only
to have agood time. Blincoe made up a story about having
such a huge ego that he stole all of his best friend's
girlfriends. He said he thought it was a fun lie that
wouldn't hurt anybody.
TV talk has come under criticism for encouraging such
things as cat-fighting between guests and audience members, something known in the business as "controversial
warfare."
Certain events have contributed to this criticism, such
as the $614,000 lawsuit against the Montel Williams
show. The Santa Fe woman filing the suit said production
assistants lied to encourage her to come to the show.

Now guests are giving talk show hosts a taste of their

kept asking about things like

homosexuality."
According to a 1995study
"Chief Culprits ofTasteless
Talk" by Broadcasting and
Cable magazine, Ricki Lake
ranked second as the show
with the sleaziest topics—
the same year the anonymous CU student was in
New York for the taping. Nearly every story consists of
lies, so she did not think she and her best friend were
doing anything out of the ordinary, she said. "Who knows
if they really believed us or cared," she said. "They just
wanted a show. They just wanted the ratings."
A production assistant from the Ricki Lake Show
seemed to support this hypothesis. The woman, who
wished to remain anonymous, said potential guests can
write to the producers to ask ifthey can embellish a story
to fit the theme of a show. She said the spiced-up tales are
considered, and the producers simply pick the guests that
will make the best show.
The Ricki Lake Show paid for the student's flight to
New York and a two-night stay in a luxurious hotel. The
student also was given $ 100 in spending money. She said
that this really isn't much compared to the amount of
money the show must make.
The average cost to tape a show is $50,000. Each show
usually averages a $400,000 profit.

Rhodes College student and his friend of lying, although
he thinks they probably suspected it. "They know,"
Cohoon said. "How many true stories can really fit one
topic?"
The recent trend of students lying in exchange for an
appearance on national television has many wondering
whether it is the talk shows or the guests themselves who
are responsible for this critique.
Peck said that, no matter who is responsible for the
manipulation of America's talk show audience, TV
viewers are being shortchanged.
The 1995 survey by Broadcasting and Cable magazine reported that 83 percent of general managers find
the topics introduced by talk show producers and hosts
to be sleazy and tasteless. But many talk show hosts
say it is students such as Blincoe and Hooker who cast
dishonor on talk TV.
Whether guests or hosts are at fault, Peck said the
lying phenomenon poses many issues for television
talk shows. "Itraises questions about if any guests are
truly authentic," Peck said.

More diversity for student life needed in Ville
Most of us should remember reading the entries in hundreds of college
guides before selecting Swarthmore. Among the categories of criteria was
"Town-Gown relations." Some colleges provide urban anonymity in which
college students are barely recognized or separated from a poor community
by thick walls; others have true college towns which cater primarily to the
needs of the students by offering discounts at many local businesses and
staying open until all hours of the night.
Here at Swarthmore, there isn't much noticeable tension between the
students and the residents of the Ville (after all, we do a little better than, say,
New Haven). But on the other hand, they haven't bent over backwards to take
our needs into consideration.
The Bean Bag, which opens this week, is a good example. It could
potentially be a nearby place (but still "off-campus") where students can go
for a snack or cup ofcoffee. Except that it's not so wonderful. The Bean Bag,
like the Jumping Cow, will be closing early, sometimes as early as midafternoon. Which means that, once again, the only social gathering place in
the ville that is open past 10 p.m. even on weekends will be Renato's. There
is no cafe within walking distance that is open at night, when college students
need it most as a break from their studies or to provide an alternative
environment for reading. It would be great if there were a coffee bar that stays
open past 5 p.m. Most students don't have cars, so it would be nice to have
something that is close enough so that we can walkthere even in bad weather.
After all, students would be willing to pay for whatever we could gain from
this increased service.
It's interesting that not many businesses in the Ville have sought to take
advantage of the 1,400potential customers in the immediate area. Students
could also provide the necessary employment for the later hours that will
accommodate us. We are not suggesting that the students of the College are
the only residents of the borough ofSwarthmore who matter. Rather, because
the College community is a significant component of the population, there
should be some consideration of our needs.
We're thrilled that the Jumping Cow space won't remain empty, and very
pleased that the owners of the Bean Bag plan to continue the Cow's policy of
hiring students, We'd just like to recommend that, well, people take advantage of us more, and use us to make a little money (not unfairly, of course).
This will do some good for students as well: we will have more to choose from,
and the likely increase in competition will keep prices fair.
Just imagine how many more students wouldrather go off-campus to buy
a cup ofcoffee rather than get a bottle ofcaffeinated water at Tarble—and yet
these are the measures we're driven to take. So if you're listening, Mr. Bean
Bag: coffee is meant to be had at 2 a.m.

Student health concerns need College attention
Healthis a particular concern for many Swatties. We are often under stress
and deprived of sleep, and health is sometimes pushed to theback of our minds
when we have a paper due or a midterm the next morning. We need a health
center that makes us feel confident that our health is in good hands. There are
several suggestions that we would like to make regarding Worth's policies
towards health care for students.
One frequent concern of students is the lack of available doctor's hours.
Doctors are not at the health center to see patients at all on the weekends.
Students who become seriously ill on late Friday afternoon need to wait
almost three days before they can be examined and helped. We all know that,
when a person's health is in danger, three days is too long. We think that one
improvement would be for doctors to be available on the weekends. We
understand that it is difficult to find doctors who are willing to work on the
weekends, but surely the health of students is worth a more concerted effort.
A second concern is the training ofcertain employees in the health center.
Recently, many students have complained of being guinea pigs of a sort, in
which they are the first patients to be given a certain medical technique by an
employee. There have also been cases of incorrect diagnoses or diagnoses
made according to a picture in a medical book. Students have been sent home
with medicine that is not appropriate for their condition.
In addition, students are sometimes given medicine by employees who are
not certified for nursing. We would like to suggest that the College fully
review the qualifications of the health center employees, including certifications and adequate training.
A final concern is the resources available at the health center, particularly
in terms of testing. Tests mailed to a nearby laboratory on a Friday do not
return to the health center until Monday. This is a serious danger for students
in terms of receiving appropriate care and treatment. As with doctors'
appointments, students often cannot afford to wait three days for a diagnosis.
There have also been several instances in which all of the beds in the health
center have been filledand students in need are not able to receive the roundthe-clock care they need.
We understand that the health center does a reasonably good job providing
consultations and treatments for Swarthmore students. But we also know that
there are several important aspects of the health center that need improvement. Many students and parents have expressed continual concern about the
health center. The health of the student body cannot be overlooked.
We all know that Swarthmore thinks carefully when planning its annual
budget. Overall, money is allocated where appropriate, and we have some of
the best faculty, courses, and facilities in the country. We don't want to say
that Swarthmore has deliberately neglected adequate funding for our medical
facilities. At the same time, there seem to be important elements of the health
center that need further attention and care.
College students often like to make jokes about different parts of their
schools, but underneath the endless jokes and horror stories about Worth are
some sobering realities.

SAC Apathy Threatens Dance Party Diversity
By Failing to Support On-Campus Musicians
To the Editor:
This past week, I went to Student
Activities Committee on behalf of
my band, Soma, and the party we're
planning on having Saturday, March
22nd, at the Olde Club.
After waiting for an hour, I received word that SAC granted us NO
money. Their reasons: there are other
parties happening on campus that
night and all their money goes there.
What parties? A Tarble party and
a Paces party. Now, this is not about
the fact that SAC didn't give us
money, but about a more fundamental issue for the social life of this
campus.
We are still having the party, because we want to throw a dance party
in Olde Club, complete with an opening band, our band, and a dance DJ,
allS watties. This is not some random
off-campus band coming to play the
Olde Club. Yet, SAC nonetheless felt
that people would not go see a band
or go to a dance party in Olde Club
(which hasn't happened since November) and wouldrather go to Tarble
and Paces, the same two places where
just about every party has been this
year.
What's the point?The point is twofold: SAC is neither promoting diversity on campus nor showing support for on-campus bands. Plenty of
off-campus bands come to the Olde
Club and are free to the Swat campus.
Nonetheless, the school and SAC
in particular have done little to show
support for on-campus bands. Playing in a band is as legitimate a social
activity as acting in a play or playing
a sport
it is another way for Swarthmore students to use their talents
and express themselves, and can be
immensely rewarding.
So, when I went to SAC, I would
have understood, "Well, we can'tgive
you much, but we knocked off a few
dollars from other parties and gave
them to you." Even if it were just for

the principle of it, I would have
rathered a few measly bucks. Instead,
SAC decided thatpeople will not go
to our party and gave their money
instead to the same-old DeeJayed
parties.
Well, there are people out there
who like dancing to bands. Remember Doctor Booty? Soma has played
a bunch of shows, including the ML
Halloween party. My first two years
at Swat were filled withdance bands,
from Captain Corduroy to Scrappy
Buddha. This tradition should not
die. People like seeing their friends
and classmates play in a band and
dancing to them.
Yet, when was the last timeyou've
seen your friends play at an all-campus party?
When was the last time there was
an Olde Club dance party?
There is a real danger of losing
diversity at Swat parties if SAC remains so close minded in who it
gives its money to. If they have a
limitedbudget, then they should give
less to each party, but not dictate
what parties Swatties can go to or
not.

Diversity in parties doesn't just
mean more non-drinking options, but
more variety within the existing parties. There can be no such thing as
too many parties or types ofparties,
particularly at such a school as Swarthmore.
In the end, we're going to pay for
our own party, because we want to
play for Swarthmore and throw a
good party at the Olde Club Saturday
night. In the future, students need to
make it clear to SAC that they want
more variety of parties at Swarthmore, and this includes the bands
whose members are Swarthmore students who work hard at their music
and, like the athletes, actors, and artists ofthe College, excel at what they
do.

Simple Science Overlooked in Argument
Against the Safety of Some Tampon Brands
To the Editor:
I read with interest Jessica Carew
Kraft's piece on the tampon industry
(The Phoenix, March 6, 1997). Ms
Kraft names several sources for allcotton tampons (I had heard of only
one of the companies before) and
cites research to support their use
instead ofrayon tampons.
Unfortunately, a mistake in the essay makes Ms Kraft sound like a
crazy radical instead of an informed
activist, much less a student from a
top liberal arts college.
She cites a 1994 study by the New
York University School ofMedicine
as suggesting that "rayon...produces

that meat does not produce maggots
and grain does not produce mice.
As a science teacher, I often read
about the sad lack of scientific literacy in the United States. I am horrified that The Phoenix should publish an article that makes Swarthmore look as if its student body is as
scientifically illiterate as the general
public is purported to be. This is an
elitist view, but Swarthmore is an
elite intitution. I felt embarrassed by
Ms. Kraft's mistake. I hope that as
editors, you will prevent similar errors from going to press in the future.

Black Racism Is a Social

One day this past summer, I found
myself engaged in a long discussion
with some people (who happened not

about whether or not Black people

question is, why would the federal
government do this? Shouldn't voters have the right to decide what the
law will be? Isn't that kind of the
point of a democracy?
There's a simple reason why the
federal government responded so violently to the medical marijuana laws.
Put simply, it couldn't afford to let
them stand.
Drug cartels and the heavier drugs
like cocaine and heroin get all of the
publicity, but 75 percent of all drugrelated arrests are for simple possession, usually for marijuana. Nationally, over 50 percent of all trials are
for drug-related offenses.
The laws passed in California and
Arizona are so dangerous to the War
on Drugs because it is largely a war
against marijuana use. Cocaine and
heroin are glamorous and make the
news, but marijuana is the reality of
drug use in this country. Every year,
35 to 40 millionAmericans use marijuana. That's close to one out of every five Americans. There are a lot of
drug-crazed criminals running
around, huh?
For 50 years, there has been a campaign to demonize marijuana, but it
has met with little success. Lies can
only be pushed so far. Marijuana does
not cause physical addiction, nor does
it have any permanent effect on
memory or intelligence. It's true that
it's not the best thing you can do for
your lungs, but neither is smoking
tobacco, which kills 400,000 Americans a year. Tobacco is legal.
The only argument drug warriors
have been able to produce against
marijuana is that it is a "gateway"
drug. It would be a compliment to
call this argument asinine. Most
people have taken a drink before trying marijuana. Why isn't alcohol demonized as a "gateway" to marijuana
use and all of the perils that lie beyond? Furthermore, alcohol kills
thousands of people every year, and
is often the cause of violence and
domestic abuse. This is not a problem
with marijuana.
Whatever your attitude may be toward marijuana, it should be clear by

Swarthmore History

More Signal Strength Than a Brightly Glowing Lightbulb?
By

Elizabeth Weber

"We called it the 'Swarthmore Network,'
or 'SN,'" said Howard Tompkins '42. "Our
first studio was up in the dome of Parrish,
right next to the math department office.
That's where we first plugged our plug into
the wall and didn't get electrocuted."
In its early days, WSRN was not a licensed
radio station. It had no antenna on top of
Parrish. Instead, in early 1940, Tompkins,
Donald Stix '4l and Eugene Ackerman '4l
built their own AM radio equipment and
plugged their signal into the college power
supply. As The Phoenix wrote nearly ten
years later, in March of 1948, "The net result
is that promptly every lampcord, desk lamp,
lightbulb, razor, and, for all we know, pants
presser, becomes part ofSN's antenna. Wherever there's electricity, there's SN."
The network first existed only in Parrish,
but it was soon extended to Wharton, to
Bond, and, by Tompkins' senior year, to PPR
(then known as "The Preps"). Adding more
dorms to the network was a matter ofworking
around the shielding in the power transformers in each building, not of stringing cable, he
said.
JoeRutledge' 50 explained that after Swarthmore purchased the Mary Lyon buildings,
"The idea was to have a transmitter down
there. I don't remember if we ever did...l
lived in ML and got the signal directly off the
feed as audio."
Since SN's actual broadcasting power was
extremely weak, it wasn't subject to FCC
regulations. However, Tompkins explained,
"There was a small problem in that when we

plugged the signal into the 110-volt line, it
would sometimes go out through the town of
Swarthmore as well. You see, we got our
power from the Philadelphia Electric Company part of the time, and the campus generated its own power some of the time, as an
economy measure, and they would switch
back and forth...that made a difference as to
where the signal went. I don't think it was a
problem at that time. It's quite possible we
weren'talways totally legal, but nobody called
us on it."

He said that the station probably switched
to FM broadcasting with an antenna sometime in the 1950's, at the same timethat many

other college radio stations made the same
switch.
Of the three station founders, Tompkins
recalled, he was the one most responsible for
the actual broadcasts. SN operated for a few
hours in the evenings, "to provide a background for study," mostly playing music from
the College collection of classical music
records. However, the station did broadcast

When

we asked Francis Negron to
tell us what she had been doing
before she came to Swarthmore,
we didn't know what we were getting into.
Francis began reeling off an awesome list of
projects. During the past ten years, living in
Philadelphia, she has created "half a dozen
films": a one-hour experimental movie on
Puerto Rican identity...a documentary on
AIDS in the black community...community
media endeavors, including a public service
announcement for the Gay and Lesbian Task
Force...a program on the effects of the Spanish-American War in all the regions involved,
such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and Cuba. Besides this fdm work she's collaborating on a
series offeature fiction novels called Pickup.
When we acted impressed, Francis said,
"Well, that's some of what I do." If one

reach on the phone.
Francis says she is publicly recognized in
three capacities: as a filmmaker, as a writer,
and as a "presence in Puerto Rican debates."
We asked how Francis herself, having grown
up on Puerto Rico, had come to make socially-conscious documentaries in Philadelphia and this year to join us at Swarthmore. In
replying, she ascribed her skills and interests
almost entirely to circumstance."l began making images from very very young," she said,
because her grandfather, a "frustrated filmmaker himself," gave her the equipment.
As for her socially-conscious stance, she
explained that "being born andraised in Puerto
Rico" makes aperson "extremelypoliticized."
She described the University of Puerto Rico,
where she pursued her undergraduate education, as a "hub of political activity."
She came to Philadelphia for graduate work
at Temple University. Having obtained a degree in Visual Anthropology and a Master of
Fine Arts, Francis is now working on a dissertation in the Rutgers Comparative Literature
program. She describes her dissertation topic

as a "theoretical look at the concept of assimilation."
This year at Swarthmore has been Francis's
first year teaching. In her self-effacing way,

Francis says she is publicly recognized in three
capacities: as a filmmaker,
as a writer, and as a
"presence in Puerto Rican
debates."
she said that "I wanted to start teaching, and
this seemed like the place to start." It's obvious that this isn't just a sort of default job,
however; to be offered a position here is an
honor bestowed on a remarkable educator.
Education has always been her field; she is
simply pursuing it in a new venue—the classroom. "The experience of sharing with an
audience is not unfamiliar," she says.

Francis sees her teaching role as extending
beyond her position as a professor, though.
She is continuing her social activism. From
her point of view, "the thought that you are
academic isalien." In Latin America,
only
she points out, academics are very involved
in politics. "Teaching doesn't obscure other
roles." Her goal in all her endeavors is the
same: to find to the most viable way to reach
a desired audience using the available resources.
Francis's currently viewable project is
Homeless Diaries, a documentary of the
Puerto Rican tent city which currently exists
on 4th and Lehigh in Philadelphia. This semijournalistic expose" reflects Francis's view
that her work is "a fine line between history
and memory." Photographs from this project
are on display in McCabe Library; the film
itself is being shown free at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art every day until April 2, and at
the Museum of American Art until April 9.
Take the trip to Philly, or at least take the time
to glance at the photo exhibit. It's an opportunity to see the work of an outstanding
activist and a dedicated communicator.

Rutledge said. The station broadcast campus
speakers, chorus performances, homegames,
occasional concerts in Philadelphia, and more.
"We went even further than Philadelphia," he
said. "We followed the football team wherever it went: Johns Hopkins, wherever. We'd
do it overa telephone line i nto the studio.. .that
was standard radio broadcast practice at the
time. A couple of people with a remote box
would drive out with the cable."
Rutledge said that the WSRN commentary
at home football games also went over the
public address system into the football stands.
"Not everything was put on the field that was
on the air, but the same announcer would do'
both.. .[the announcer] learned to control his
language; he'd been a marine in the island
campaign in the Pacific!"
The 1943 Halcyon noted that SN "saw the
opening ofits new and much-needed Trotter
studio" that year. "It was on the first floor, in
thesouthwest corner," Rutledge remembered.
"There was a music department room with a
grandpiano. We had a booth in the northwest
corner of the room. That was Studio A. There
was also a sound insulated control room for
the announcer, or the disk jockey, or whomever."
I asked Rutledge if he'd ever heard the
legends about the FCC shutting WSRN down
after the station used the railroad tracks as a
giant, powerful antenna. He said he'd never
heard the story, and doubted it was true. "The
railroad tracks are pretty thoroughly
grounded," he said. "I don't know how feasible that would be. It was enough trouble to
get the signal through to all of the dorms."

is a really unique experience, a bonding experience because you have lots of people in a
small room for a long time. A really intense
experience, but it was worth it."
Friesen estimates Sixteen Feet has sold
over 500 of the original 1000 copies of its
most recent recording. At least 100 copies
have been sold off-campus. "Almost every
time we go to another school, we sell some,"

Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition

Jedi Returns In Slightly Altered New Version
By

Patrick "Tubular" Runklk

The middle of Return Of The Jedi ties up
some loose ends and sets up the climax. The
Emperor and Darth Vader, in the midst of
building a new, more powerful Death Star,
plot to control Luke's new-found Jedi powers, as Luke visits wise old Yoda one last
time. Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance plans
an assault on the new Death Star.
The climax of the film, as Luke battles the
Emperor and the Ewoks battle the Empire
forces on the planet below, has always been
criticized. Everyone seems to think the lovably furry Ewoks, who aid Han and Leia in
their attempts to disable the Death Star's
shield, are ridiculously out of place in the
movie.
I've always liked the Ewoks, though, and
so I got a kick out of seeing them on the big
screen again. And Luke's climactic battle
with the Emperor and Darth was surprisingly
more effective than I thought it would be.
Seeing it in full sound in a theater makes it all
seem so much more powerful.
The very end of Return Of The Jedi, however, falls prey to the most meddling ofany of
the Special Edition films. Lucas, intent on
fiddling with the Ewok Celebration finale,
took out all of the great Ewok music and
replaced it with some watery world-style
music, composed by John Williams just for
theSpecial Edition. As if that weren't enough,
the film now cuts from the celebration of the
Alliance victory on the moon of Endor to
celebrations on three other planets in the Star
Wars universe. The shots of the other planets
are computer-rendered special effects. They
look okay, but they're terribly, terribly out of
place in the movie. I guess it's a small point,
but the Ewok Celebration brought our heroes
full circle and was a satisfying end. The new
special effects shots ruin the intimate-yetepic feeling of the original.
These small glitches notwithstanding, it
was like a return to childhood to see this

I

remember the first time I saw the extended preview for the Special Edition
releases of the Star Wars trilogy. The
audience, which had talked loudly through
the other previews, was completely silent,
and, after the trailer played, there was a
reverant cry of excitement echoing throughout the theater. With a built-in market like
that, who needs critics?
That's why reviewing the first two installments in the series is a useless endeavor,
because they're pretty much modern cinematic gospel. But Return Of The Jedi has
always been regarded as the weakest of the
trilogy, so I was really interested in what
George Lucas would do to 'improve' this
one, and, as the preview so accurately pointed
out, video is not the way to experience epics.
As I'm sure you'll recall, as Return Of The
Jedi opens, Han has been frozen in carbonite
and is now decorating the palace of gigantic,
slimy intergalactic thug JabbaTheHutt. Han's
friends, including Princess Leia, Lando, the
Droids, and, finally, Luke Skywalker, come
to his rescue.
I've always loved the beginning of this
movie, and, indeed, the sail barge battle is one
of the most exciting parts of the whole trilogy. However, Lucas has made some alterations for the Special Edition release. In the

Go Ahead, Be a Jerk. But Wear Your Shades.
By Jeremy

Mathias

&

Julia Sable

On

Saturday night, Steve Martin
will light up the screen in The
Jerk, directed by Carl Reiner.
This slap-stickcomedy has little to recommend it except a few truly funny
moments and some rather cheap
jokes...made even cheaper when juxtaposed with the quality humor of The
Blues Brothers. In fact, if we didn't
personally know who had made this
selection for the movie committee, we
would be very tempted to say they have
an awful taste in movies.

Steve Martin stars as Naven Johnson,
an orphan brought up by a poor black
family in Mississippi. The movie follows his wacky adventures from rags to
riches and hack to rags, as he makes his
debutinto the real world. He finds works
in a circus, and is seduced by a truculent,
motorcycle-riding co-worker; he is
stalked by a psycho killer, and then falls
in love with a ditzy blond (Bernadette
Peters); on the side, he manages to invent
the Optigrab for a business tycoon who
markets the invention and makes them
both rich.
The plot has little continuity; follow-

ing in true slap-stick tradition, it just goes from
one ridiculous skit to another. The humoris...well,
Steve Martin. When, early on in the movie,
Naven finds out that he was adopted, he exclaims
petulantly "You mean I'm not ""ing to turn
black like you when I get older?." This is one of
his better lines —admittedly, jokes like this do
elicit laughs, but they don't tend to keep the
viewer's interest. We won't deny that there are
some genuinely funny moments, particularly
when Naven finds his "special purpose," and
then writes home to tell his family...
However, the soundtrack is very cool —again,
it pales in comparison to The Blues Brothers, but
Naven's family provide some rocking soul tunes
at the beginning and the end of the movie. Peters
and Martin also sing a rather cheesy little duet
for those of you who don't know, Peters is an
amazing Broadway performer and singer, but
this movie doesn't showcase that talent at all.
Peters does play the ingenuous blond pretty well,
though.
Take our rather bad opinion with a grain of
salt—we will freely admit that we don't generally enjoy this type ofhumor. We have talked to
other people who loved this move, so if you like
Steve Martin's brand of humor, you will get a
large and undiluted dose of it in The Jerk.
"We're on a mission from God," Jake Blues
exclaims several times in The Blues Brothers,
the hilarious 1981 comedy via John Landis.
Landis, who had a hand at Michael Jackson's
"Thriller" video and Animal House, has created
another instant classic in The Blues Brothers,
and it should be your mission to see it this
Saturday night if you've never seen it before.
The film, which stars the late JohnBelushi and
Dan Aykroyd as brothers Jake and Elwood Blues,
is based on a Saturday Night Live skit (and is the
only skit to actually become a good movie—i.e.
remember It's Pat and The Coneheads). One
reason why the film works so well is because of
its simple, yet entertaining story line, where
absolutely no thinking is necessary. You can just
sit back and enjoy the movie!
The brothers, after Jakeis parolled from prison,
discover that the Chicago Catholic boarding
school where they once dwelled as child delin—

quents is in dire need of five grand to stay open;
so they head out on the road, in search of their
band which once made such great blues music.
Besides the task of finding their "soul"-mates
and getting a gig which will make them money,
Jake and Elwood must dodge huge police forces,
Nazis, Carrie Fisher and her flame-thrower and
machine gun, and a country & western group.
This results in some of the largest car-crashes,
number of extras, and public destruction this
reviewer has ever witnessed in any movie to
date.
The Blues Brothers has many other assets on
its side. While the film is truly funny throughout,
there are certain scenes that will make your sides
split; watch out for the dancing at Triple Rock
Church, the crowd at Bob' s Country Bunker, and
the wealth of quality stores at the Chicago mall.
The film is also packed with star cameos,
especially blues artists, usually with the performers mocking themselves. On the musical
front, there's Cab Calloway, James Brown, John
Lee Hooker, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles.
On the acting side, there's John Candy, Paul
Rubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman), Twiggy, and
Carrie Fisher.
The soundtrack to the movie is, according to
most blues fans, one of the best around; beside
the performances in the film by Ray Charles,
James Brown, and Aretha Franklin, there are
also recordings by Peter Gunn, Sam and Dave,
and JohnBelushi and Dan Aykroyd.
Moreover, it is the dead-pan humor of the two
stars that truly makes the movie a classic. So
intent on putting "The Band" back together, they
ignore everything else in their way, like explod-

ing buildings, detonating phone booths, and,
even the law, with a calm coolness. The two
men, withtheirsignature black sun-glasses, suits,
and hats, fashion one of the most endearing duos
in modern film.
For those who never really got to see the
wacky comic gifts of John Belushi, this film is a
great forum for their presentation. Because the
picture is so lovable as a whole, it also celebrates
the joys of music, especially the "blues," as a
mode of enjoyment and relaxation for anyone.
The Blues Brothers guarantees both.

Swatties on

Job
Interviewing
For Beginners

Well,

it's that time of year again
when young Swatties' fancies turn
to thoughts of summer employment. Yeah, even you will start to get sick of
reruns of The Partridge Family and WKRP in
Cincinnatti after a month and a half, so you'd
better get started thinking about how you plan
to spend your summer solstice.
Yes, the wide, wide world of work awaits
you and you need to be prepared. This means
that unless you intend to serve the Rooty
Tooty Fresh N' Fruity plate to career insomniacs at 3 o'clock in the morning at your local
InternationalHouse of Pancakes, you're probably going to have to interview for your
desired employment position.
Interviews, as a rule, are stressful. This
might even be your first encounter with THE
MAN, so you're probably going to be nervous. After all, you know that you can only
impress HIM with stories ofyour high school
quiz bowl victories for so long. Inevitably,
you're gonna need something else.
And that something else should be a joke.
THE MAN loves a little humor. And a joke is
a good way to show HIM you're a spunky,
well rounded youth who is wise beyond the
knowledge found in your Swarthmorean
books. HE knows you can recite all 95 of
Martin Luther's theses; show him you're a
wild and crazy guy who knows a little about
Steve Martin, too.
Of course, we all know that you are a
student ofSwarthmore college which means
you are not, in fact, a spunky, well rounded
youth. You are a harried, badly dressed, malnourished nourished geek who has had every
last morsel of humor beaten out of you by the
powers that be. The only joke you know is
why the chicken crossed theroad and that one
is getting a wee bit old.
So as a public service to you, my loyal
minions, I will now relate to you a few tasteful and refined jokes that can be used in a
myriad of interview situations.
So say you're interviewing for an exciting
and rewarding job as a medical technician.
Try this joke: This guy walks into his doctor's
office. He has a carrot in one ear, a banana in
the other, and a cucumber up his nose. He
says to the doctor, "Hey, doc, I haven't been
feeling well lately. What do you think is
wrong with me?" "Well," responds the doctor, "for starters, you're not eating right."
Or maybe if you're looking forajobatyour
neighborhood Mattress Giant, you could try
this. You say, "Hey, haveyou heard about the
new corduroy pillows." Whenyour would-be
boss answers no, you say, "Hmm, that's surprising 'cause they're making headlines!"
This next joke will work well if you're
vying for a position as a Republican senator
or, perhaps, the groundskeeper at a nearby
cemetery.

Bill Clinton is walking beside a lake in
Washington. Suddenly his knee buckles beneath him (no, he isn't drunk, I swear it) and
he goes tumbling into the lake. Three adolescent males see Mr. Clinton fall and they jump
in to save him. They arduously pull him out
and recessitate him. Bill is so grateful that
they saved his life, he asks them if there is
anything he, as the President of the United
States of America, can do for them. The first
guy says he wants to sleep for a night in the
Lincoln bedroom of the White House. Bill
says, "Sure, that's doable!" and, then, turns to
the next man. The second guy asks for an
appointment to West Point and again, Bill
answers in the affirmative. Finally, Bill turns
to the third guy and says, "Now, what can I do
for you, young man?" The guy hesitates,
shuffling his feet and looking embarrassed,
and after a long pause says, "Well, Mr. President, I wonder if you could get me a grave
plot at Arlington National Cemetery?" Mr.
Clinton looks at him and says, "I sure can, but
you're such a young fella, why do you need a
cemetery plot now?" The boyresponds, "Well,
you see, both my parents are doctors, and if
they find out I saved your life, they'll kill
me.
This final joke is a religious one, but you
can substitute in any deity you wish, be it
God, Buddha, or the Lord Host of the Hoary
Netherworld, depending upon the circumstances ofyour interview.
So this guy named Bob walks into achurch,
kneels down, and starts to pray. He asks God
to let him win the lottery because he's really
down on his luck and he needs the money.
Bob then leaves. He comes back the next day,
though, kneels, and again starts to pray to win
the lottery. Again he leaves. On the third day,
Bob walks into the church, kneels, and prays,
"God, look. I still haven't won the lottery.
You've given me no signs, and I badly need
your help. I'm beginning to lose my faith."
God then reaches down from the heavens,
lifts the roof off of the church, looks down at
the kneeling Bob and says, "Give me a break,
Bob! At least buy a lottery ticket!"
Thank you! You've been a great audience.
Be careful driving home now.

Women's Ultimate Frisbee

Warmothers Burnt at Frostbreaker, On Fire at UNC
By

The Warmothers

Like the caterpillars that infested
their Sarasota campground, the

women's ultimate frisbee team un-

derwent a metamorphosis over the

course of their spring training.
The Warmothers started the week
at the 15th annual Frostbreaker tournament in Gainesville, playing against
Southern club teams. They lost all

five games during the weekend, a
tough but important learning experience for the 14 Warmothers. The
team then traveled down to Sarasota
where they sharedtheircampsite with
thousands of swarming caterpillars
and precocious raccoons with a misplaced sense of entitlement.
During the week, the Warmothers
practiced laying out in the waves and

throwing on windy beaches, and they
trespassed onto a beautiful soccer
field adjoining the Baltimore Orioles
spring training camp.
The team shrunk in size as some
players could not resist the temptation to return to life in McCabe. The
remaining Warmothers headed up to
South Carolina, where they perfected
their zone strategy in an eternal point
against Haverford and hooked up with
the Swarthmore men's team for an
evening of entertaining talent.
Once again, the gray van was repacked for the drive to the next destination, the tournament at the University of North Carolina. After a luxurious lasagna dinner at the mansion
ofLena Loewenthal '97 and an inspirational showing ofALeague ofTheir
Own, the Warmothers were psyched

to play ultimate the next day.

Having lost a strong thrower in
Carrie Bader '99 to sickness, the remaining eight players fought to a 3-1
record at the tournament. In their first
warm-up game, they lost to UNC 110 but soon shook off their rustiness.
The Warmothers whipped out their
zone against A Team Called Wanda
from RPI. Ironwomen Jen Lee '9B,
Emily Stewart '99, and Margaret
Parker 'OO played an intimidating,
impermeable defensive cup, leading
Swarthmore to a 13-2 victory.
During the third game against
Guilford, the Warmothers rocked on
with awesome hucks by Loewenthal
and SimoneBrant '99. The layouts of
Katy Harrod '97 caused the resurrection of the layout skirt, which was
passed among teammates who made

exceptional plays despite their fatigue. Aggressive endzone cuts by
Stewart and Parker left Guilford's
defense flatfooted and helped bring
the score to 13-2.
The Warmothers continued their
winning streak into their final game
against Smith College's Luna Disc.
Smith started strong, but S warthmore
fought hard and squelched their
opponent's budding momentum.
Captain Mandy Hourihan '9B and
Brant wowed the few fans with their
ferocious defensive blocks, contributing to a win of 10-2.
Every Warmother scored at least
once during the course of the tournament. After the final game, the teams
exchanged discs and pleasantries,
proving thatthe Warmothers can both
make friends and win games.

Women Ruggers Conquer Mud and UPenn
By

Jen Philpott

Amber

&

Halsey

Saturday, March 1 marked the beginning of a promising season for
Swarthmore's women ruggers. Despite the inclement weather conditions, including rain, mud, and freezing temperatures, the A-side squad
defeated the University of Pennsylvania 7-5.
In Swarthmore's last encounter
with UPenn last year, there were similar horrid conditions, but Swarthmore
lost and was prevented from advancing to the playoffs. This victory was
the Garnet's revenge.
Swarthmore's ruggers had been
practicing for a mere two weeks prior
to this game, and several players had
to make a rapid transition from winter sports to rugby. Despite these
hurdles, Swarthmore played a clean,
skilled game against a very competitive opponent.
The forward pack continued its
successful game strategy from last
season in which they advance the ball
for several successive plays before
the scrum half passes the ball to the
back line.
This forward pack has only returning players, and only two who did not
play last season, Bridget Arbour '9B
at flanker and Pia Houseal '97 at
second row. Arbour said, "I was incredibly nervous before the game

started, but once we were playing,
there wasn't anywhere else I would
rather have been."

Phenom fullback, Meghan Brennan
'OO, made the conversion to add two
points to Swarthmore's score, the

Thefront row consisted of a formidable trio, Becky Snyder '9B at tighthead prop, Sarah Cross '99 at loosehead prop, and our favorite hooker,
Amber Halsey '9B. With Joan
Hoffman '9B at second row, this fab
"tight five" was completed.
Alexa Miller 'OO started her second season at the eight-man position
where she excelled in the fall but
struggled to control (find) the ball in
the scrum given the muddy conditions.
Forward captain, Hanan Hussein
'97, along with Arbour, rounded out
the forward scrum at strong side
flanker. Hussein not only provided
leadership and advice to the team but
also helped to advance the ball with
her aggressive mauling technique.
Swarthmore's one try was scored
by veteran scrum half, Jen Philpott

winning difference.
Philpott also provided the necessary link between the forwards and
backs which permitted the team to
dominate UPenn for the entire first
half. Courtney Clark '9B made her
debut at fly half and, despite her
"opening night jitters," played an
outstanding game against a highly
skilled UPenn fly half.Back captain,
Andrea Barnett '97 would normally
have played at inside center, but was
unfortunately sidelined due to illness.
Giovanna Giuliani '97 started at
inside center and played well until
receiving a brutal blow to the left eye
and retreated from the field cradled
in the arms of Barnett. Giuliani was
capably replaced by rookie Kira
Cochran-Bond 'OO who finished the
second half with style.
Beth Vose '99 was at outside center and adapted well to this new position. Christina Costas '99 and Lynn
Matthews '9B completed the back
line at the wing positions.
Clark and Brennan provided the
crucial kicking power which helped
Swarthmore to gain better field positions on many occasions.
Although Swarthmore was thrilled
with their A-side victory, they recognize that there is much room for improvement in the weeks to come.

'97, whose drive and determination

to score were not hampered by the

opposition nor the squalid weather

conditions.
Swarthmore had advanced the ball
to 10 meters outside of UPenn's try
zone when Swarthmore was awarded
a penalty. UPenn did not retreat
quickly enough, and Philpott decided
to capitalize on their mistake by rushing the ball in to score the first five
points of the game.

After the game, Hussein told her
team, "UPenn wasn't expecting to
face such a tough team today, and I
am proud of us, but what they don't
know is that we could still be a lot
tougher. I am pumped for the rest of

the season."
The B-side game did not result in a
win in terms of score (0-5), however,
it was obvious to every spectator that
Swarthmore was playing with an unusually high level of skill for their
first game and that their hearts were
completely committed to the sport.
One returning senior player commented, "I have never seen a better
first B-side game, orso many rookies
with so much promise. I'm glad I'm
graduating, or I might lose my position."
The one blot on an otherwise perfect rugby day for Swarthmore was
the injury to Julia Kernochan's '9B
right knee. Kernochan fell victim to
the mud as she gruesomely twisted
her knee tearing her ACL and MCL
in the process.
All in all, Swarthmore's women
ruggers proved on Saturday that they
have improved significantly from
theirdismal 0-6 fall season. This Saturday, Swarthmore will play Lehigh
University at home with hopes of
creating a winning streak. The Aside game will start at 11:00a.m., and
the B-side match will follow immediately after.

the ECAC Buzzards Fly Again
By Tony

David Lischer

In the first round of the ECAC South regional tournament on March 8,
Swarthmore traveled to the raucous home court of the tournament's host
Lincoln University.
Against Lincoln, the Garnet played with a lot of heart, coming back from
a 20 point second half deficit to within just a couple points at game's end.
With the buzzer, Swarthmore's comeback was cut just short at 74-68.
Aaron Bond '97 led the Garnet with a game-high 22 points on 10-13
shooting. Bond also grabbed 12 rebounds, seven on the offensive end of
the court. Likewise, Ben Schall '97 recorded a double-double in scoring
20 points and grabbing 11 boards.
Swarthmore managed to hold Lincoln's top-scorer, who was averaging
close to 30 points a game, to a mere 20, including an 0-7 from three-point
range. Lincoln's center threw in 19points and 17 rebounds in the winning
effort. Lincoln played up-tempo and took some 80 shots, compared to
Swarthmore's 57. Lincoln's pressure defense notched 17 steals, and the
Garnet turned the ball over 21 times. However, the Lincoln players
struggled from the field. The team connected on only 39% ofits field goal
attempts. Swarthmore was shooting at a 47% clip.
Both teams had trouble from behind the three-point line. Lincoln made
only three of 23 attempts, and Swarthmore made only six of 21. Colin
Convey '97 made five of his 13 attempts in totaling 17 points.
Swarthmore was without the services of Tim Schofield '9B, a strong
three-point shooter who suffered an ankle injury in the Centennial
Conference finals against Dickinson.
Swarthmore finished the season with a 16-12 record, overall a fine
performance for CoachLee Wimberly' s squad and a great final season for
the five departing seniors.

The men's rugby team was humbled at home on the first Saturday of
spring break by a much bigger and more experienced Philadelphia
School of Osteopathic Medicine.
The score was not accurately recorded by the hosts, but it was generally
agreed that the visitors scored a lot more points than the home team Evil
Buzzards.
Swarthmore did a lot of things right, showing that they have come a
long way, but they were simply out-played by the veteran medical
students. Despite great effort, Swarthmore managed only a single try in
the game, scored by Sid Ganesan 'OO, which was aided by the rest of the

The Swarming Earthworms,

Swarthmore' s men's ultimate frisbee
team, travelled south during spring
break for tournaments, practice, and
the promise of better weather.
On the first weekend, the squad
traveled to Gainesville, Florida, for
the Frostbreaker Tournament. The
Earthworms split 4 games on Saturday, beating UPenn and Bryant College and losing to Clemson and the
University ofFlorida. On Sunday, in
the secondround, the team dropped a
close game to Georgia Tech. During
that game, Roger Bock '99 dramatically injured his nose, treating the
crowd to a fountain of blood. "We
beat all the teams we should have
beaten," said veteran handler Mike
Morton '97.
OnSunday evening, the team drove
north to Isle of Palms, South Carolina, just outside of Charleston, where

Florida in round-robin play. In the
opening round of the single elimination tournament on Sunday, the team

narrowly lost to Clemson. Bock,
Matt Menendez '99 and Vincent
Pallaver 'OO all had solid contributions to the team effort.

"Just getting invited to Easterns
shows that Swarthmore Ultimate is
now gaining recognition," said
Clayton, who added that the team is
busy preparing for tournaments in
the next month, and is hoping for a
strong performance in the national
series in late April. "With better
coming, we will step up our practices
to move our game to a higher level."

'97 dared to take on the offensive
tactics of Evan Dorn '97 and Molly
Jacobs '97, who, joined by Peter
Sollins '97.5, scored their fair share
of goals. This is not to say that C-line
went without a senior or two; here my
favorite for the most improved player
of the year: Brian Schwartz '97 always managed to get his stick on the
puck, often to pass it to long term
puckers devotee JeremyDilatush '97.
Just discussing the seniors, however, does not do the organization
justice. Unfortunately, the constraints
of space (and my fear of forgetting a
name or two) make it impossible to
mention the long list ofother players.
Suffice it to say that a strong freshman contingent was also seen, particularly towards the middle of the
season, and that both the sophomore
and junior class were also well represented. Two names that must be mentioned, however, are those of Matt
Menendez '99 and Erik Rosolowsky
'9B. Motherpuckers would like to
thank Erik for his two and a half years
as honcho and particularly for his
willingness to drive the puckers van,
and we look forward to Matt's continued leadership in the 28th season.
Although the descriptions above
might lead you to believe that puckers is about competition, it is really
about sharing a fun evening on the ice
at the school's expense. Like any
well-likedSwarthmoreactivity, puckers is completely free. The season
runs approximately from fall to spring
break, and new members are welcome.

teams held their third annual Talent

frisbee by Sibley.
On Saturday morning the team
drove to Wilmington, North Carolina, for the invitation-only Easterns
Tournament. The team went 1-3 on

to Yale, East Carolina University and
a close match to the University of

Rodger

Last night marked the end of the
27th season of Motherpuckers; with
its close, I feel compelled to reflect
on some of the highlights.
Thursday night was all about sorting out you mere mortals from the
rest of us; while you mortals cowered
in fear at the thought of that micro
problem set, that stats assignment, or
that 8:30 engine class, or tried to
forget them assisted by a pint of beer,
the proud puckers squeezed themselves into an SC van or assembled
their fleet of cars and sped on their
way to the Springfield Ice Rink. Here
they set aside thoughts of work as
they donned the skates and the helmets. As the adrenaline started to
flow, they grabbed a stick and headed
for the ice. After a brief warm up, the
players engaged in a competition
where speed and reflexes, or a sense
of humor, characterized the survivors. Each night the players enjoyed
about 20 minutes of ice time, and
watched as fellow students and the
occasional professor waged their own
battles.
In all seriousness, however, it was
a great season for Motherpuckers. A
dedicated crowd of seniors were the
backbone of the organization. You
could always count on Tony
Cheesebrough '97 to lead the A-line.
Joined by David Lewis '97 and Alec
Zimmer '97, the group posed a real
threat to the strong defense of Ross
Dickson '97 and Anne Richards '97.
Seniors also proved a force on B-line.
Andrew Brown '97, Nick Lehmann

The try came on a line out three meters from the try line, when the ball
was fielded cleanly by Swarthmore's forwards, and mauled in, with
Ganesan ultimately touching the ball down.
Adam Booth 'OO was impressive in his first ever rugby game, playing
with experience beyond his years. And in the forward pack, Dan Schwan
'97 and Pete Zustovitch '99 played solidly for the overmatched Swarthmore club.
In B-side action, it was uncertain who exactly won, but Swarthmore put
up a great game, either tying the Med schooler's B-side or winning by a
conversion. Tries were scored by Tony Sturm '99 off of a Lou Basenese
'OO kick, and Basenese made a strong case for A-side consideration by
scoring a try himself, picking off a pass by the opposition's back line and
taking it 20 meters in for the score.
This weekend, Swarthmore will try to avenge last season's loss to the
University of Pennsylvania. Penn will visit the Buzzards this Saturday at
1:00 p.m on DuPont Fields.

The Phoenix

Sports
Softball Catches A Few Rays in Florida
By

Jean Quinn

The softball team, 1-6 overall, had
a successful stay in Fort Pierce,
Florida over Spring Break and returned from the trip with an unprecedented win. The team is off to a
promising start, and, if everyone remains healthy, should record a lot
more victories this season than in
years past.
Coach Cheri Goetcheussaid of the
excursion, "It was definitely a great
jump-start to our northern schedule. I
feel the team has gained confidence
and some savvy in their play."
Goetcheus was able to experiment
with different lineups and to try players in a number of positions.
The team lost its two games against
Bryant butboth contests went thefull
seven innings. "The pitching was realistic to what we'll face in our conference games. We were aggressive
and we looked ready to play," said

Goetcheus.
In the first game, Michelle Walsh
'9B had two RBIs and went 3-4, including a home run on the first pitch
she faced. Catcher Apryl Dunning
'99 also went 3-4.
In the second game, the rest of the
team improved their hitting as well.

and knocked a run in. Marybeth

Quinn '99 who had

two RBIs and a

stolen base.
Husson was the team's next opponent, and the Garnet did not fare well
against them. "We defeated ourselves.
We let them intimidate us with their
trash talk, and we were intimidated
by their pitcher. We weren't aggressive offensively or focused," said
Goetcheus. Alvarez went 3-4 in the
two games and had two stolen bases.
Dana Lehman '9B aptly noted that
the team recovered from a difficult
outing and faced Blackburn with a
fierce intensity. Offensively, the team

did a great job and laid down many
successful bunts.
Lehman, the Garnet's fearless
leader and starting pitcher, picked up
her first win of the season but sprained
her MCL in the second game while
playing third base. Out for at least a
week, she is working hard in the
training room doing rehabilitation
already.
Lehman led the team in the first
Blackburn game in going 3-4, driving a pair of runs in, and stealing a
base. Walsh and Alvarez each went
2-3 and combined for five RBIs. In

upcoming games

the second game, Walsh knocked
three runs in, doubled, and stole a
base.
Wendy Lawrence '99 has taken
over the pitching helm in Lehman's
absence and has made nice strides.
She and Walsh split the pitching duties in the team's 15-7 loss Monday
against Neumann.
Lurah Hess '99 stole two bases en
route to scoring two runs. Dunning
had a three-run homer, and Walsh
had three RBIs on a pair of fine hits
including a long triple into left field.
Overall, the team committed only
five errors over break. Consistency
and not giving up one killer inning to
theother team are goals for this year's
squad. Giving way to mental lapses is
also something the team must overcome if it is to be successful.
"Getting to know each other outside ofa game-setting helped us work
better together when we got back on
the field. Sometimes, games in cars
and hours in the ocean can be just as
important as batting practice," said
Lawrence, nicely summarizing the
Spring Break experience. Hopefully,
the team's new-found camaraderie
will quickly translate into victory.
The team takes on the squad from
Drew on Saturday.

ton State team to Cunningham Field.
After spotting Stockton an early two
goal lead, two quick goals by senior
co-captains Donaghy and Pete
Hamilton ended the first quarter in a
2-2 deadlock and brought the momentum to Swarthmore.
However, a second quarter injury
to Donaghy, the team's leading scorer,
momentarily stalled the offense as
the Garnet faced a 7-2 deficit at the
beginning of the third quarter.
With just 17 available players, the
Garnet could not afford to miss any
player, and the injury forced Gress to
move Erik Johnson '9B to defensive
middie and Chris Rockmore '9B to
the first midfield unit.
Halfway through third quarter, the
offense finally struck. Nimish Dave
'99 led a fast break in which Adam

Dickinson 'OO picked up a loose ball
and scored. Minutes later, Matt
Halpern '9B beat a double team and
cranked a left handed shot in the
upper corner to close the gap to 7-4.
After two more Stockton goals, the
Garnetrefused to quit, withHamilton
and Dickinson each adding their second goals to close the gap to 9-6 with
five minutes remaining. At this point,
the exhausted Garnet could not reduce the deficit any further and
dropped the 11-6 decision.
After playing three games in eight
days, the Garnethas enjoyed the week
offand look forward to this weekend's
tournament. With all aspects of the
team coming together, Swarthmore
looks to turn their season around by
capturing the tournament, which includes Tufts, Drew and Goucher.

On the first day of spring break, the women's tennis team piled onto a van at 6:00 a.m. in the morning and
started on their annual trip to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.
The team played five matches during the course of the week, against Peace, Averett, Methodist, Mary
Washington and Vassar. The majority of the scrimmages were lost, but
the team was hurt by the loss of two of their top three players, who were
not able to make the trip.
Playing number one singles for the first time was Neena Shenai '9B,
giving her opponents a tough battle no matter how good they were.
Nga Lai '97, who usually plays fourth singles, was boosted up two
spots because of the missing players, taking up the number two slot
a hard jump, but Lai rallied hardand played strong throughout theweek.
Along with Lai, the rest of the singles players played two spots
higher. At number three singles was Elena Rosenbaum '9B and at
number four was Wendy Kemp '99. Numbers five and six were taken
up by newcomers Laura Brow 'OO and Sara Coe 'OO, with Michaela De
Soucey 'OO at the number seven slot.
All three doubles teams were newly formed, they all managed to pull
in some wins and a lot of points. Shenai and Lai played number one,
Rosenbaum and Kemp played number two, and Brown and Coe played
number three
Yet although the overall win-loss record was not impressive, the team
played well and is looking forward to the start of the season, especially
now that the normal first and third seeds, Michelle Martinez '97 and
Rani Shankar '9B, are ready to play.
The team's first match is this afternoon against Ursinus College at
3:30 p.m. on the Wharton tennis courts.

The high scoring could not have
occurred without the help of a sturdy
defense. Anchored by first-year goalies, Jane Kendall and Kate Doty, the
Garnetremained confident in the defensive zone. Aside from their nettending abilities, the two goalies are
known for theircheerfulness and their
antics: Kendall with her dance moves
cultivated during the field hockey
season and Doty with her arachnid
mutilation skills carried over from
past camp experiences.
In the game against the College of
Maryland, several players collected

Maryland goalkeeper.
The most excitingplay ofthe game
came, however, from a defensive
player. Kelly Wilcox '97, the accompli shed goalie on this year's field
hockey team, put on a one woman
show against College of Maryland.
Playing line defense which is the
farthest position from the opposing
goalie, she stole the ball off of a
drawl and raced down the field and
scored her first goal of the season.
Wilcox, who has averaged about
one goal per season so far, may end
the trend and become a real scoring
threat if she continues to make trips
down the field in every game.
The win against College of Maryland was only the beginning of a
tough season in a competitive conference. Swarthmore will face its
next two opponents on home turf
Saturday and Tuesday against
Lynchburg and Washington Colleges, respectively.

Over spring break, the men's and
women's outdoor track teams started
training for their season in sunny
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. For
many of the team members, runs along
the shore and warm weather made the
strenuous two practices a day at Coastal
Carolina and plenty of mileage well
worth the effort.
"It was fun to hang out withthe team
for a week. The hotel was fabulous,"
said Steve Dawson 'OO.
This past Friday and Saturday the
Swarthmore track team ran in an extremely competitive meet at the University of North Carolina in the
Wilmington Seahawk Invitational
against 29 Division I teams. Despite
the competition, both the men's and
women's team performed well.

Swarthmore has gotten off to a
slow start thus far, losing hs first
three games of the season. However,
in each contest there were dramatic
improvements and hopes are high for
the Drew Tournament this weekend.
With only six players returning
from last year's squad, the lack of
experience was prevalent in the
Garnet's first game against Virginia
Wesleyan. Though hopes were high,
Swarthmore would fall by a final
score of 16-4. Throughout the game,
the Garnet made many mistakes and
accumulated too many penalties to
be competitive.
Goalie Ben Hen wood '97 (21
saves) played a terrific game and
gave hopes for solidifying the defense in the future. Freshmen goalie
Sygßydquistand defensemanTucker
Zengerle also impressed in their first
bit of collegiate action.
On offense, Steve Shin '9B finished with two goals to lead the attack. Midfielders Marcus Shin 'OO
and Pat Donaghy '9B each added a
goal and an assist.
The second contest was against a
strong Drexel squad, a Division I
school. From the outset, it was clear
that the Dragons, with a roster that
more than doubled the Garnet's, had
far superior stick skills. Though the
final score was 13-oinfavorofDrexel,
it was clear that the Garnet had made
a big improvement in comparison
with the first game.
Coach Pat Gress commented, "I'm
proud of the effort our guys gave. We
limited the amount of mistakes and
overall played a solid game."
With two games under their belt,
the Garnet were finally ready for a
victory, welcoming a physical Stock-
