Seniors brave cold job market Sager refocuses aims
to prioritize activism

BY ALEXANDER ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore seniors looking for employment after graduation are facing a job market
much less friendly than those of years past,
due to the economic downturn. According to
Erin Massey, Associate Director of Career
Services, "there are less positions available
out there." However, Massey emphasized that
her office "doesn't have a pessimistic outlook."
"It's not a catastrophe. People are going to
be employed," said Dianne Seo 'O9, a Career
Peer Advisor

in the Career Services office.

Echoing her tone, Massey explained that finding a job in the current economy is certainly
possible, but that the process is more time consuming than in previous years. "We usually
say that looking for a full-time job as a senior
is like taking another credit. This year it might
be like taking another credit and a half," she

said.
"If you're a senior, you'd like to be a sophomore," said Mark Kuperberg, professor of economics, who thought that the job market will
likely have improved by the time the class of
2011 graduates. Calling unemployment a "lagging indicator," he pointed out that the unemployment rate might continue to increase even
after the economy as a whole begins to
rebound. This means that, even if the March 15
prediction of Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of
the Federal Reserve, that the current recession
will come to an end this year proves accurate,
finding a job will probably remain difficult for
some time into the future.
Cristian Nunez 'O9, a Career Peer Advisor,
recognized the need for students to cover all
the bases in their job search. While saying that
students shouldn'tbe scaredoff by the difficult
market, he emphasized the need to recognize
that hard times make careful preparation,
important in any economic climate, essential.
Students "shouldn't get anxious, but they

should be better prepared than they might
have been in years past," Nunez said.
Programs offered by Career Services, such as
mock interviews and resume help, could be a
part of this preparation.
"The economy is in bad shape," Nunez said.
But students can hurt their prospects further
by not spending enough time preparing their
resume, practicing their interview skills, and
networking to find job opportunities. Many
open positions are never advertised, according
to Nunez, and companies find potential applicants by asking their current employees for

recommendations.
In a down economy, with less positions
being offered and companies hiring more slowly, it is increasingly important to find these
positions through contacts inside a particular
profession. Nunez pointed to the online
Alumni Directory, operated by Alumni
Relations, as a good way to find people within
a certain profession that can give advice about
open positions, application strategy, and general career advice, "because they know more
than we do," he said.
Other resources offered by Career Services
can help students become more appealing
applicants, and the Swarthmore community
has been using them on a more frequent basis.
Mock interviews are particularly important,
according to Nunez, because many students
find that it takes a few tries to become comfortable in the interview setting, and a real job
interview, which often takes a substantial
amount of work to find, is no place to work out
beginner mistakes. According to Massey, students are attending conferences and help sessions "in record numbers."
Some students were able to find employment before the true seriousness of the economic crisis had sunk in. Alison Flamm 'O9
was offered a position with a consulting firm

Educational Leadership

BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore. edu
Refraining the notion of a monolithic lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community with a single set of concerns, Sager Symposium
2009 focused on the interconnectedness of queer experiences within and
across marginalized communities.
The
symposium,
entitled
"Intersections of Queer: Coalition
Building Across Our Communities,"
featured a film screening, workshops,
lectures and a panel, and ended with a
banquet and closing party.

According to Sager Symposium

Committee Co-Chair Sasha Raskin 'O9,
the symposium not only informed participants of these issues, but also created a space for students, specifically
activists within the LGBTQ community, to strengthen to discuss coalitionbuilding on campus.
"There was space in the symposium in a way there hasn't been in the
past to really build a coalition around
it and to enjoy each other's company
and to get to know each other in a
whole new way," Raskin said.
"[That's] really what we're going for
because it's pointless to talk about
coalitions and not do that work."
Further, in a departure from past
symposia, this year's was less academically oriented, and more pragmatic.
"[The Symposia] have been academically focused in the past," Raskin
said. "I don't think the activism and
the academic parts of anything we do
are separate. We were looking to talk
about our role as activists and academics."
The
Symposium opened on
Thursday, March 26 with a screening
of "A Jihad for Love" by Parvez
Sharma, a documentary that illuminates how queer experiences intersect
with Islam around the globe.
The next day, a queer storytelling
workshop run by author Sassafras
Lowrey created a space for expressing
their personal experiences, often
silenced in the mainstream media,
through the vehicle of the spoken
word. A lecture given by Juan Battle
entitled "Race, Sexuality, & Social
Justice: A View of the Future
Through the Lens of a Public
Sociologist" dealt with politics and
race relations with a focus on

Proposition 8.
"We were seeing the ways in which
Prop 8 was being defined as a gay
issue but the campaign in general
were
issues of race, issues of class
not being defined as gay issues, and
we really wanted to interrogate that,"

Friday's events.
On Saturday, a workshop held by
Colin Kennedy Donovan called "AntiRacism For (Dis)abled Folks: An
Interactive Workshop" linked white
privilege, the queer communities and

For Cecilia Marquez 'll, a member
of the Sager Symposium Planning
Committee, the workshop highlighted

lecture,
Hollibaugh's
Amber
"Claiming Age: Creating a LGBT
Movement We Can Afford to Grow Old
In," was for many the most interesting
event. "The talk on queer aging was
really meaningful because it's not a
topic that's talked about in terms of
queer activism ever," Dina Kopansky
'll said. "She made the conversation
really relevant to all the young
activists in the room."

Jessica Holler 'lO agreed. "Amber
made apparent the issue of consider-

ing the intergenerational perspective.
It was looking at aging and invisibility in a compelling way," she said.
A panel entitled "Activism at the
Intersections" brought the theme of
the symposium home. Reina Gossett
from Queers for Economic Justice,

Yasmeen Perez of FIERCE and Caitlin
Breedlove from Southerners on New
Ground (SONG) spoke of their experiences as activists in different queer
communities.
"We saw [it] as our capstone
event," Raskin said. "It really tookthe
themes of the symposium and tried to
really discuss what activism at the
intersections looks like for people who
are really doing that work."
According to Marquez, the panel
was particularly useful because while
activists at Swarthmore discuss theories of activism, the panelists illuminated the kinds of tactics activists are
actually using to promote solidarity
across various LGBTQ communities.
"It let us see what folks are actually doing," Marquez said, 'and what
strategies and tools are successful."
The Symposium closed with a banquet and a party. "The banquet was a
great culminating event," Marquez
said. "It was nice to have a space to

decompress."
According to attendees and organizers, the diverse slate of events
brought out large groups of varied stu-

dents. "We had wonderful attendance

at all these events," Raskin said. "We

filled all the rooms we had."
The particular issues that the symposium addressed were also relevant
for many on campus. "It made me
want to incorporate all of these different parts of what they were talking
about into my own activism," Dina
Kopansky 'll said.
Alex Weintraub 'll, who was not
involved with organizing the
Symposium but is a member of the
Genderfuck party planning committee, agreed. "I think there was a
large breadth of topics that were covered so I think everyone found something they could engage with,"
Weintraub said.
This diversity also may have
marked a departure from previous
years' symposiums. "The focus this
year was much more around activist
work in intersections of the queer
community
intersections with
people of color, the elderly, the disabled and other communities. It's a
perspective you don't usually hear,"
said Leah Rethy 'lO, who was not
involved in planning the symposium.

GREENMarch strives to
stimulate sustainability

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY SARAH POZGAY
slong6@swarthmore.edu

At the end of Tuesday, March 31,
Swarthmore's first ever GREENMarch
campaign came to a close. A project of
Earthlust, the campaign aimed to
increase campus awareness of environmental sustainability issues. The effort
involved a variety of other activist and
green groups on campus as well.
Dividing GREENMarch into themed
weeks, organizers addressed issues of
energy-saving, transportation, food and

SBC shaves pun/ctum, equestrian budgets
BY DANTE FUOCO
dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

This month the Student Budget
Committee cut the budgets for the
recently chartered photography magazine pun/ctum and the Swarthmore
Equestrian Association. The SBC also
decided to grant a less than requested
budget amount for the writing and arts
magazine Night Cafe.
Student Groups Adviser Chris Green
'O9 said that these groups' funding last
year didn't come from SBC's normal
operating budget. When groups don't
spend all their money their "rollover"
goes to a "capital replacement fund,"
which is used when SBC-owned capital
breaks and needs to be replaced, such as
the Student Council vans and the
Swarthmore College Computer Society
video and computing equipment.
According to Green, Paul Apollo, last
year's Student Groups Adviser, suggested that with an already tight budget,
SBC could for one year only fund these
three groups through the capital
replacement fund. It would be fiscally
irresponsible to do this each year, however, because rollover money is variable and used in a good way already,
Green said.
Student Council President Yongjun
Heo 'O9 agreed.
"[Last year's Chartering Committee]

chartered them with the understanding
that it's not going to be sustainable to
keep all three groups because their
budgets were so large," Heo said. "[This
year] we had to evaluate which groups
contributed more, how they contributed, how they can continue contributing more without additional funding, and how they can contribute more
if their funding was cut."
This past year, pun/ctum, which
published one issue each semester, had
a budget of about $12,000 while the
Swarthmore Equestrian Association
had a budget of approximately $9,000.
The budgets were reduced to roughly
$B,OOO and $6,000, respectively. Night
Cafe's budget stayed at around $6,000.
Green, who serves as Student
Groups Adviser on SBC, Student
Council and the Chartering Committee,
said that at the beginning of spring
budgeting each year SBC sets a "benchmark" of money that they decide to allocate to groups.
"By the end of spring budgeting, SBC
had over-allocated approximately
$20,000 and had to make cuts to bring
the budget back to our benchmark,"
Green said in an e-mail. "The budget
cuts for those three groups happened in
the course of spring budgeting; they
came in, proposed budgets, and were
approved or denied just like all the
other 100+ groups. Consequently, the
20K over the benchmark happened after
initial funding decisions were made for
those [groups]."
The Chartering Committee met with
these three clubs on March 2. Heo and
Green said that while Night Cafe and
Equestrian
Swarthmore
the

Association
were
"flexible"
budgets,

or

pun/ctum was not open to the idea of
having one publication each year
instead of one each semester.
The Chartering Committee renewed
Night Cafe and the Swarthmore
Equestrian Association's one-year
charters, but chose not to review
pun/ctum's. Though the committee can

THE PHOENIX

make these decisions, SBC decides all
groups' final budgets.
After Green told pun/ctum through
an e-mail that they were not re-chartered, pun/ctum appealed to Student
Council and were rechartered. This was
under the condition that they would
work under a smaller budget, however.
Pun/ctum Editor-in-Chief Cheryl Tse
'O9 said that the magazine was originally perceived to be inflexible because it
"wanted to keep true to the original
vision and values of the magazine."
Managing Editor Linda Wang 'O9
agreed.

"We felt like we should be defensive,"

she said. "We wanted to maintain a

semesterly magazine because we felt
that was the whole point of having
pun/ctum magazine
to support the
printed publication."
Since the baseline printing cost for
one issue is $4,000, Wang didn't find it
"unreasonable" for the magazine to
have roughly $12,000 for two issues, she
...

said.

Though Green said that the most
important reason to cut pun/ctum's
budget was because it was high, he

added that there were other reasons.
"The Chartering Committee had gotten the impression
that members of
the Swarthmore community were not as
pleased with the publication as
we had hoped," said Green.
There were concerns that the
layout and quality of photos
were poor, that there were not
many photos presented and
there were not many students
who were participating, he
added.
Wang said that there was a
misunderstanding
between
Chartering
what
the
Committee saw and pun/ctum's
vision for the magazine. For
example, the "intentionally
minimalist" layout explained
why photos seemed spread-out
through the magazine: "We're
not going for a catalogue of
photos. We're going for a photo
magazine that gives respect,"
she said.
Wang also disagreed with
the claim that pun/ctum was
not connected to the college
...

community.
"We've always stressed that
this magazine is about community and collaborationand having everyone working together
to make it as good as possible,"
she said. In addition to submissions from photography students, pun/ctum also received

work from alumni, some of
whom had completed MFA programs. The magazine was
always open to feedback, soliciting comments from faculty
and students, Wang added.
After the magazine's charter
was not renewed, however, its
members became more flexible
when appealing to Student
Council. Next year, pun/ctum
will only have one magazine,
but Wang said that it will be
bigger and have a higher quality than either of the semesterly
magazines this year.
Though she expressed concern that "not everyone is
going to be aware that we're
only accepting submissions for

one publication," Wang said that she is
relieved the group has funding for the
future.
Not renewing a group's charter is
not as harsh as it sounds, Heo said.
"It's not just this slap in the face
it's not to close down an organization or
a community. [With pun/ctum] it wasn't
that we were saying
we don't want a
photography community," he said. "One
thing that's beneficial with [not renewing a charter] is that it allows for new
people who are interested in the same
things to restructure their organization
in a new way."
Green added that even though "it
sacriwas a really difficult decision
fices had to be made."
Green and Heo said that they were
concerned with the Equestrian Club
that they were only partially subsidizing the $4O hourly cost for riding.
This year students had to pay half of
the riding cost for the roughly 10 rides.
Now with the budget cuts, Heo said that
the first four or five outings will be paid
for by the budget, and students will pay
the rest.
Co-captains Kim Comer 'O9 and
Esther Burson 'lO are, however, still
concerned about these budget cuts.
Comer said that though the first four
lessons are now free, students still have
...

...

...

to pay because they have to commit to a
full semester. Burson, who is taking
over leadership when Comer leaves,
said in an e-mail that she's concerned
that "we'll be hard pressed to fund
everyone."

"It's scary to think that all our efforts
might come to nothing and the club
might fall apart because oflack offinancial support," said Burson, who is
abroad this semester. "My plan for the
future is to hope that the numbers work
out and we pull through the hard times."
Since the budget is expensive, however, Heo said that part of the stipulation
with the budget cut was that the participants would be capped at around 30.
Founder of Night Cafe Eli EpsteinDeutsch said that though there weren't
really major cuts this year, the magazine's $6,000 budget isn't enough to fund
the hoped-for four issues per year. The

magazine asked for around $9,000 as a
high-end request likely for revision, he
said. Epstein-Deutsch added, however,
that the magazine is getting a website
and may post some content online only.
This year the magazine published
two larger issues; treasurer Emma
Ferguson 'lO said that there will likely
be three issues next year.
Ferguson added that artwork will
probably not be printed in color.

FROM WAR NEWS RADIO

Persistent uncertainty threatens Pakistani politics
BY TARINI KUMAR
WAR NEWS RADIO
The following report aired on last
week's War News Radio program
"Outside the Lines." To hear the report
and the rest of the show, visit War News
Radio's website at www.warnewsradio.org.

Who's in charge in Pakistan is a complicated issue. The current president,
Asif Ali Zardari, took the place of his

wife, Benazir Bhutto, after she was
assassinated in December 2007. That
year, the military dictator Pervez
Musharraf, who came to power in 1999,
resigned, and democratic elections were
held in Pakistan. President Zardari and
former prime minister and current
opposition leader Nawaz Sharif formed
a coalition government. On March 15,
President Zardari placed Nawaz Sharif
under house arrest, leading to political
turmoil.
The power balance now lies between
President Zardari, Nawaz Sharif and
General Asfaq Kiyani, who heads the
Pakistani army.
But the country seems to be moving
toward political chaos, and security in
Pakistan is weak. The March 3 attacks
on the Sri Lankan cricket team during
their visit to Lahore questioned the

effectiveness of Pakistan's counter terrorism strategies.
The situation can be viewed both positively and negatively, says Rajdeep
Sardesai, Editor-in-Chief of the India
Broadcast News, one of the top TV news
channels in India. According to Rajdeep,
"It is, in a positive sense, a second war of
independence where Pakistani democracy is finally trying to assert itself. On
the negative side, it is a recipe for chaos
because there is fear that no one [in
Pakistan] is fully in control, and whenever no one is in control, the army steps
in to take charge."
Military rule is nothing new to
Pakistanis, who have lived through four
coups in a span of six decades. The last
coup brought Pervez Musharraf to
power, with U.S. support contingent on
Musharrafs changing the previous
regime's
fundamentalist
ideals.
Journalist Jawed Naqvi, who writes for
Pakistani newspaper Dawn, said that
U.S. expectations for change were unrealistic. "Musharrafs agenda brought in
a completely new equation. After 9/11, he
was told to do an about turn, and bring
the Pakistani military and its other
allies on the lunatic fringe
like the
to heel, and also change
Mujahiddeen
possible,
their course. Which is not*
it's like uncorking the genie."
...

...

With Musharraf out of power, General
Kiyani seems to be the man to initiate a
military coup; however, both Sardesai
and Naqvi think it is unlikely. Naqvi
adds that the Pakistani military will be
unwilling to compromise its relationship
with the American administration. The
U.S. has, as recently as 2008, sold arms to
the Pakistani military. During the Bush
administration, Pakistan received significant funding from the U.S.
Now that the Obama administration
has come into power, this relationship
will be re-evaluated and the Pakistani
military, according to Naqvi, will be
unwilling to jeopardize its alliance with
the U.S. "General Kiyani will not do anything to embarrass a new presidency in
the U.S. And for [the Obama administration] to suddenly face the prospect of a
military coup, in a country where elections were prompted by the Bush administration, would be a serious embarrassment," says Naqvi.
Sardesai believes that elections would
be the best course ofaction. But Naqvi is
skeptical of democracy's effectiveness in
Pakistan.
"Democracy is certainly no panacea
and no guarantee that there will be no
religious fanaticism.
If there can be a
promise of free and fair elections then
everybody has the business to have their
...

is
democracy
Unfortunately,
denounced as satanic by the Taliban and
the Al Qaeda, so what are we talking
about?" says Naqvi.
The future for Pakistani politics
seems uncertain at best. Jawed Naqvi,
taking a pragmatic stance, notes, "It is
Islamic terrorism that worries the
world, and unless that is resolved, it is
difficult to see how the army can be sent
back to the barracks. Can the civilian
government take on a militarily armed
and sophisticated adversary in the
Taliban and the al-Qaeda? Obviously not.
So the military has an increased role in
Pakistan for the foreseeable future."
According to Sardesai, Pakistani citizens are eager for change and stability.
He adds, "If this democratic urging is
able to triumph over the terror and radicalization, then Pakistan has hope. If not,
then I'm afraid Pakistan is slipping into
an abyss. And it will be very difficult...
to look at that situation."
Control of Pakistan is contested, and
it's unclear who will hold power. The
Pakistani people have endured over four
decades of military rule in sixty-two
years of independence. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto put an end to the
hopes that came with the last election.
Now, the region hinges on Pakistan's totsay.

tering democracy.

APIA month celebrates heritage Seniors feel wrath
of harsh economy
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY KATHERINE ERNST
kemstl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's Asian and
Pacific
Islander
American
(APIA) Month kicked off Friday,
March 20 with the Traffic Light
Party hosted by the Swarthmore

Asian Organization. Over the
next few weeks, SAO and other

Asian student groups such as
Friends of Taiwan, Deshi, Han
and PersuAsian will host a wide
variety of performances, lectures
and social events designed to foster awareness, appreciation and

understanding of APIA cultures,

communities.
Although
other institutions
nationwide celebrate their APIA
communities in April and May,
Swarthmore's month is somewhat earlier due to scheduling
difficulties with final exams.
issues

and

Upcoming speaker and performer events include a panel on
"APIAs in Academia" featuring
five Tri-Co professors of Asian or

Pacific Islander descent, a lecture
by author and New York Times
journalist Jennifer 8. Lee, spoken
word performances by female
artists Leah Lakshmi PiepznaSamarasinha, Sham-e-Ali AlJamil and Heesun Lee, and an
urban hip-hop music performance by the Stone Forest

Ensemble in Olde Club.
In an event sponsored by the
Friends of Taiwain, Jennifer 8. Lee
will describe the history of
Chinese food in America as
explained in her book "The
Fortune
Cookie Chronicles."
According to Karen Shen 'll, FOTs'
intercollegiate liaison, Lee will be
the first speaker the group is
bringing in for APIA month. "We
heard her speak last year at the

Taiwanese Student Association
National Conference," said Annie
Ning, president of FOT. "She was

really funny, worth listening to."
A hot-button issue incorporated
into this year's heritage month is
Development
Foxwoods
Company's plan to build a casino
in The Gallery at Market East, less

than a block away from
Chinatown. "Asian American
United Anti-Casino Petitioning in
Chinatown" is listed as an official
APIA event, and took place on the
Saturday after the Traffic Light
Party. "Gambling is a big problem
for Asian communities, and hopefully we can be a part of the effort
to prevent this from happening in
our community in the same way
that other communities have prevented Foxwoods from building in
theirs," said Ivana Ng 'l2, SAO's

First-Year Intern.
Although this is an APIA her-

itage month, SAO co-president

Vivienne Layne 'll hopes that,
despite the fact that the events "are
specifically advertised as cultural," they will reach students of all
backgrounds. "I always really
appreciate different events hosted,
by different cultural groups that I
may not necessarily be a part of,"
said fellow co-president Cathy Ng

'lO.
In addition to satisfying the
non-APIA community's interest in
a culture not necessarily their
own, SAO is also making sure to

provide APIA students and other
students

of multicultural back-

grounds with closed events to discuss issues unique to their community. On April 14, there will be a

discussion on exotification open
members of the IC and BCC
communities. "We don't want people to be uncomfortable during the
only to

discussion when we're talking
about exotification, because it's a
sensitive issue and making it semiexclusive will hopefully prevent

discussion from being anything
less than it could be," Ivana Ng
said.
"Hopefully, these events will let

them know that SAO is here for
them whenever they want to use
our resources," Ivana Ng said
regarding Swarthmore's APIA

community.

Continued from p. 3

in November. "The offer thankfully still stands, although I won't
be expecting to start work until January," she said in an e-mail.
While Flamm said that she was "fortunate in that I found
something more or less like what I was looking for," she said that
she had to be "more flexible on my start date" than she had anticipated.

Many job-seekers are also expanding their search field, looking for jobs in all areas that their talents can be applied, even if
this requires abandoning a "narrow" view of a student's career
options, according to Massey. "We've found that students might
have an interest... but that field isn't working out for them, so
they've broadened their scope a little bit more, which is great,
not necessarily that they're giving up on opportunities that
haven't come around yet, but they're saying 'l'm really interested in making sure I use these skills that I have, what other areas
can I use them in,'" she said. In Massey's opinion, "Swarthmore
students in general are open to different things," a quality that
helps give them greater flexibility when looking for employment.
On their part, Career Services is increasing attempts to find
job opportunities for students. "We're doing more in terms of
reaching out and contacting employers [about jobs]
in that
sense there's been an effect on what we're doing," Seo said.
While the pressure of looking for employment has certainly
been compounded by the increased competition in the current
job market, in Seo's experience, most seniors have been able to
find something. "I haven't heard many complaints from students
that they can't get a job," she said.
For students of any year, uncertainty about the economy and
the job market abounds. "The great depression lasted ten.years,
so who knows?" Kuperberg said.

Seniors come together to 'rescript' Swarthmore
BY MAKI SOMOSOT

msomosol@swarthmore.edu

The great unknown looms ahead for
the graduating class of 'O9. That which is
known as the outside, the actual "real"
world beyond the comfortable college bubble, awaits. So it is only reasonable that
these Swarthmore veterans would want to
preserve their fondest college memories
and remember the best, the worst and the
ugliest of times.
Enter "Swarthmore Rescripted," the
newest "Fun Fun'd" film project.
Essentially a video yearbook that will
serve as a remembrance for seniors about
their collective Swarthmore experiences
and personal journeys throughout college,
"Swarthmore Rescripted" is spearheaded
by Senior Class Officers Loretta Gary 'O9,
Martha Marrazza 'O9, Armando Leon 'O9,
Juliana Macri 'O9 and Christopher
Compton 'O9. The project is roughly based
on the iconic Admissions video
"Swarthmore Unscripted," in which a
film crew chronicles the life and daily
experiences of five Swarthmore students
for three days.
Like its predecessor, "Swarthmore
Rescripted" will largely be built around
confessional-style segments of senior stu-

dents recalling their most memorable
experiences, but it will also feature iconic
scenes and happenings that characterize
Swarthmore, such as Pub Nite and the
typical daily Sharpies hubbub. "It will
basically be a hodgepodge of Swarthmore
life," Gary said, "but it will also provide a
forum and venue for seniors to make their
own memories, a space where they can
remember Swarthmore and look back."

Filming this will be organic and
unplanned in the sense that it will entail
going to certain hangout hubs and loca-

tions around campus, where students can
feel more inclined to talk naturally in
front of the camera as opposed to compelling them to give a personal confessional in an enclosed space, as was the
case in "Swarthmore Unscripted."
The nature of the project, while it will
be focusing mostly on the diverse experiences of Swarthmore seniors, is also openended and flexible to the involvement of
underclassmen who want to convey their
own unique impressions of Swarthmore.
Isaac Han 'l2 and Lauren Ramanathan
'll are both currently involved in making
a music video that encapsulates the quintessential Swarthmore experience, aiming to spoof T-Pain's SNL skit "I'm On A
Boat" by rewriting the lyrics to fit the

more-than-idiosyncratic Swarthmore context. Han's plans for the music video
include filming a dance sequence of stu-

dents atop the roof ofParrish.
Marie Rousseau 12, who recently
signed herself up for the project, reasons
that she is "so happy with [her] first year
and [her] discovery of wonderful people at
Swarthmore that [she] wants to share that
experience with other people."
But "Swarthmore Rescripted" will not
attempt to be a free-for-all and sundry
video about Swarthmore. It will also provide a unique factor that defines it separately as a senior-based project. Ideally,
most of the confessionals will be coming
from Swarthmore seniors, and there are
also plans of including a "Superlatives"
segment which is visibly absent in The
Halcyon, Swarthmore's traditional yearbook publication.
The original concept for "Swarthmore
Rescripted" came about after the election
of Senior Class Officers, where the five
officers were able to brainstorm different
ways and activities of "uniting the senior
class." Thus, the project was conceived.
"We just ran with it and had fun," Gary
said. Gary added that, after the preliminary interest meeting on Feb. 24, the senior officers came to the open-ended con-

elusion that "the students involved can
choose to do whatever they want, and
[that] anyone can basically produce their
own segments."
This assurance and support for improvisatory individual work will hopefully
encourage campus entertainment groups
and other interested students to become
actively involved in the project. Of course
there is ample time to foster more interest
and involvement among the student community. "[Swarthmore Rescripted] is still
in progress," Marrazza said. "We're going
to do most of the filming in April and then
plan to do the final editing in May."
The senior class officers hope that the
project will not only be an entertaining
production, but also a long-lasting
memento for posterity. "Imagine someone
finding this random DVD in his or her
office one day; it'll make themremember
what Swarthmore and college life used to
be all about," Gary said.
Anyone who is interested in signing up
for "Swarthmore Rescripted", please contact Loretta Gary at lgaryl@swarthmore.edu.
Disclosure note: Isaac Han and Lauren
Ramanathan both write for The Phoenix,
but had no role in the production of this

Richardson mixes media to unite past and future
BY DAISY SCHMITT
dschmitl@swarthmore.edu

This past Thursday, the
Senior Art Major exhibits began
with a bang with Crystal
Richardson's ('O9) mixed media
presentation. Her colorful, personal and simple creations filled
the Kitao Gallery with various
Swarthmorean art-enthusiasts.
Lining the clean white walls,
each image, sewed to a frame of
fabric, had a story to tell, be it a
portrait, a flower, or dead fish.
In her artist's statement,
Richardson explores her earliest
memories and the people and
events which touched her. "I
remember tootsie rolls," she
writes. "Dad would buy me
penny candies (back when they
actually cost a penny).
He'd
reach his hand into the plastic
bucket as I watched expectantly
from behind the confines of the
turquoise stroller straps that
kept me from floating away with
excitement." She muses about
her mother's conception of traditional, and remembers her Uncle
Henry's "beautiful, wonderful,
spectacular, shiny, shiny beads."
Richardson's art, it seems, centers around bringing the past to
the present to the future, and
intensely valuing the personal
and intimate.
It is appropriate, then, that
many of her family members
were there at the event.
Genevieve Woodhead 'l2, a member of the Kitao Gallery who
helped set up the event, said, "We
didn't really have to help much,
Crystal's family helped her display her art." Richardson's fam-

8

ily members' deication to her art
was nearly as moving as the
works themselves. "It was right
to have [my family] here to see
my work. I couldn't have imagined it any other way," said

Richardson.
"Her art is very simple, and
yet every piece seems to have
much more depth behind it,"
potential art major Emily Leach
'l2 commented. Other exhibitattenders expressed a certain
amount of dismay at not being
able to access Richardson's art
immediately. Despite the palpable sense of intimacy in each
piece, it felt unreachable to
some. "The images were really
moving, but the connections
between them weren't clear,"
Avery Davis 'l2 said. "I wish
there had been some more explication of the motives behind
them, so the exhibit seemed to be
a more cohesive whole." This
certainly speaks to the nature of
Richardson's art. In the last
paragraph of her artist's statement, Richardson says: "If you
want to know where my art
comes from, you're asking the
wrong question. It's not about
where my art is coming from; it's
about where it's going. Every
picture, every piece of regalia,
every prayer chanted into clay,
every weaving, every carving,
every plaster cast piece of my
heart is a letter home."
Inspired by her grandmother's quilts, these "letters home"
are mixed media comprised of
photographs, some of which had
been edited, sewn onto large fabric backgrounds. Of her process,
Richardson said that she "revert-

be "cute and pretty" and that represented important people in her
life. "The intuitive part involved
looking at a basket full of colors
and knowing what ones to put
back. Sometimes an artist just
knows things instinctively, at a
gut level
and I believe that is
what style is," said Richardson.
Speaking of her overall experience with art and existence at
Swarthmore, said Richardson,
"This show was the first time my
happy, playful, love of my work
was simply allowed to exist.

Hedgerow builds theater around community
boomers, we have the (Gen) Xers,
and we have the 'Millennials.'
It's a wonderful cross section of
different generations working
together. The important thing is
valuing each other's values." She
generated a list called "the good
heart principles" to guide the
community in that task, and
those principles have done more
than simply improve the sense of
togetherness.

The Hedgerow Theatre, located in Rose Valley near Media, emphasizes
community outreach along with its stage production.

BY ANNE COLEMAN
acolemal@swarthmore.edu

Nestled among quiet, towering pines of the Main Line, #64
Rose Valley Road is unremarkable to those hurrying by. With
its unassuming entry arch and
unadorned facade, the only hint
that this building is a theater is a
small hand-painted sign at the
of the road that says, quite
simply, "Shaw," as in George
Bernard Shaw, the playwright of
the current production.
The Hedgerow Theatre makes
its home in this former gristmill
and

station

way

on

the

Underground Railroad. The
Theatre Company has held court
there since 1923, but the atmosphere preceding a show may not
conjure up the sensations that
most people associate with arriving at the theater. There is no
hustle and bustle; no one has to

wait outside; and there isn't a
large concession stand or an
usher hawking souvenirs. No
matter, however, because once
you take your seat, you will be
transported. The rough old
stones that fill so much of the
view towards the stage transcend
time and spur even the most constrained imaginations to action.
It is by no small amount of
effort, however, that the building
retains its magical qualities.
Producing
Artistic Director
Penelope Reed recalled, "this
place, the theater, burned down
to its stone walls, and in 1990,
while I was at Lawrenceville
[School], they [the board] asked
me to come and try to save it
There was a roof, there was no

people."

After 14 years spent with the
Milwaukee Repertory Theater
while simultaneously teaching at
two universities, and nine years
at the McCarter Theatre while
teaching at the Lawrenceville
School, Reed was well positioned
to lend a hand. Nevertheless, the
prospect was daunting. As she
related, "One of my dear friends,
Paul Kuhn, who had put a lot of
blood, sweat and tears into [the
said 'the theater is
Hedgerow]
dying.' Those people [Janet
Kelsey, Jasper Deeter, Paul
...

THE PHOENIX

Kuhn, Susan Wefel and others]
worked so hard in those five
years to just keep it alive. They
did kids' shows; they did shows
in the living room; they did anything they could to just save the
theatre. So when he said that... I
couldn't say no."
Reed was a natural choice for
the job, having studied with
Hedgerow founder Jasper Deeter
and kept up many continuing
bonds to the theater. Her mother,
Janet Kelsey, has been the business manager since 1972, when
the two relocated to Rose Valley.
At 86, she is still going strong,
and sees no end in sight for her
work at Hedgerow. Her commitment to Hedgerow is by no
means unique to her
even for
those who aren't kin, there is
something very familial about
the company. As Kelsey put it,
"for me it's just like home
even better."
Perhaps she has in mind the
very Swarthmorean way in
which the company highlights
community values and respect in
all of their programs. Managing
Director Tom Burke, a relatively
new addition to the team, captures the essence of this thinking, when he says that everyone
at the Hedgerow is a student.
"There's a sharing of ideas, or
experiences, at all levels in the
acting classes. We're educating
in the world of theater, so it's
hard for us to think of just the
people who go to the classes as
the students," Burke said.
If it sounds implausible, then
consider the way in which
Hedgerow has managed to eliminate any sense of ageism from
their company. A common concern in the theater, age is not an
issue at Hedgerow, in either
direction. Hedgerow can boast
accomplished
child actors,
including Andrew Nad Kami,
who has done over 40 productions and whom Reed counts as a
member of the company, and the
immortal energy of Kelsey
makes for a strong showing at
the other end of the age spectrum.

Reed explained, "We have
four different generations that
work
We
together.
have
Depression Era, which would be
my mother, we have the baby

Under Reed's leadership and
an excellent board, the Hedgerow
has blossomed in recent years as
a beacon to neighboring communities. Although it grew out of
the unusual thinking of Will
Price's arts-and-crafts community, Rose Valley, the Hedgerow
Theatre's emphasis on values
has made it easy for neighboring
communities, not founded on the
same ethic, not only to accept but
also to appreciate it.
Two years ago, having earned
widespread recognition for the
quality of its productions, the
Hedgerow achieved a major
milestone, classification as a
"Professional Theatre," and the

right to grant Actors' Equity
Membership. Prior to the fire,
the Hedgerow had always been
classified as "semi-professional."
Reed is no longer playing catchup.

Reed has also made advances
with community initiatives.
These include numerous touring
productions and two very special
school programs. One, with the
Walden School, allows fifth
through eighth graders to work
on a play with Hedgerow artists
and stage it in the theater. Even
more remarkable is the collaboration with Strathhaven Middle
School. "It is a thing called
Haven at Hedgerow, where the
middle school kids work all year
long with Susan Wefel. [Wefel is
the Programming Director and a
member of the Board of
Directors, as well as a muchloved member of the company]
They work with their plays and
then they bring them here to
Hedgerow to put them on. They
elect into that as an English
major and they spend the whole
year on it," Reed said.

What is perhaps most notable
about the Hedgerow is the
Company's determination to
broaden community outreach.
Reed and her team are excited
about opportunities to connect
with the Swarthmore College
community, and have a wide
range of ideas to make it happen.
With a volunteer corps of 150 people, internships ranging from
one to three months, and yearlong fellowships, the Hedgerow
Theatre has perfected opportunities for professional mentorship
in theatre.
With mentors in everything
from acting and design to development and marketing, one
would think they'd done enough
to entice students, but just like a
real family, they won't hesitate to
offer you a ride, as well. When
Reed mentioned being willing to
pick people up from the Rose
Valley train station (a very brief
walk away from the theater), her
assistant

FILMGOING IN PHILLY: WEEK ONE
Film Festival is currently running until April 6. Which films made
the cut for our writers and which didn't? The Phoenix reviews a selection of the festival's
features, some of which you should look out for and some of which you should avoid.

The two-week Philadelphia

-

ized by Stevens' insistence on portraying as
generic and candy-colored a small Midwest
town as possible. Except for Grace's insanity,
the town apparently suffers from no problems
whatsoever. One of our first looks at the town is
an eerily irony-free sequence of Landy's wife.
Bea Bretthouse (Penelope Ann Miller), cheerily
executing her homemaker duties. The town is
even perfect to the point of unintentional
anachronism when a thoroughly modern rock
song plays on the soundtrack to signify Carrie's
fun time at a military school dance. The film
simply lacks a sense of a real, living, breathing
1950s town.
As is to be expected from many a directorial
debut. "Saving Grace B. Jones" has a consistently rough time telling its story. Long expositional dialogue often doesn't adequately narrate
the back-story. The film swings awkwardly
between blissful experiences for Carrie and
incredibly dark moments. Dramatic beats are
for the most part badly executed, which is unfortunate, since the actors put great effort into portraying palpably loving relations between their
characters. Part of the problem is the distractingly ADHD editing, which would be more at
home in a Michael Bay feature and blocks out
any possible glimpse of shrewd acting from the
performances. What should be the show-stopping performance of the film by Tatum O'Neal
as Grace is only passable, through no fault of
O'Neal, but because of the character's nebulous
nature. But the role is much more satisfying in
the context of O'Neal's own persona as the once
Academy-award winning child actor, who both
is playing an individual attempting to restart
her life and is actually attempting to restart her
career in this histrionic role. If O'Neal's final
outrageous appearance in the film doesn't qualify as camp, I don't know what does.
In retrospect, the overall muddled feel of tinfilm is probably not unlike Stevens' own recollection of that summer. Still, the film could have
been much better served with a clearer story
and a less eliched depiction of small town
Americana. Like the character Grace -Jones herself, there seems to be no saving this film.

Premiering in the first week of the Philadelphia
Film Festival. "Rumba" is a Belgian film about two
married teachers. Dominique (Dominique Abel) and
Fiona (Fiona Gordon), who double as dance champions. On the way back from a dance competition, the
duo gets involved in a car accident that pints an end
to their days of dancing glory. A brain injury causes
Dominique to suffer from short-term memory loss:
Fiona loses one of her legs. Though they can no
longer dance competitively, this tragic loss doesn't
prevent them from living brightly; their love for life
and for each other carry them through the tough

Hispanic woman who illegally entered
the United States through Canada and
made her way down to Philadelphia to
start anew while living with her
cousin. Both characters came to the
United States equipped with near-fluent English, but while the film does

should be committed to paper and pen. or perhaps, in my wildest dreams, on celluloid.
Veteran actress and singer Connie Stevens' fictional feature debut. "'Saving Grace B. Jones."
which premiered at the Philadelphia Film
Festival on Saturday March 28. seems to largely
operate with that same kind of nostalgia for a
bygone time. The film's quixotically anecdotal
opening sequence begins at the entrance to a
movie theater in Brooklyn, and the narration,
spoken by Stevens herself, locates the film's setting as "smack dab in the middle of an America
only seen in movies." If these moments are any
indication, Stevens' nostalgia for her childhood
memories is downright cinematic in her mind.
Sadly. "Saving Grace B. Jones" privileges this
overpowering nostalgia, which audiences will
likely find hard to access themselves, over any
kind of coherent story with a point.
The most fascinatingaspect of "Saving Grace
B. Jones'" comes up early in the film, when tenyear old Carrie (Rylee Fansler), the stand-in for
Stevens' childhood self, is told by a new friend
that she suffers from a trauma. Trauma abounds
in the film. When Carrie witnesses a brutal murder on the streets of her hometown. Brooklyn,
she is brought to a small Missouri town to recover with a relative for the summer of 1951. Yet,
when Carrie arrives, she finds that her host.
Landy Bretthorse (Michael Biehn). has his
share of problems as well, namely in his sister
Grace Jones (Tatum O'Neal). Grace has suffered
a traumatic accident that has left her insane in
an asylum in Oklahoma City. When Landy. ever
the loving brother, makes the controversial
decision to bring Grace back to the town, her
mysterious ailment compounded with a Hooding disaster along the banks of the Mississippi
bring even more traumatic tragedy to the story.
This frighteningly unclear and convoluted
cycle of trauma seems to be the plot thread that
will give the film its true weight. The town's
weather, a constant rollercoaster between
sunny and stormy, is a greal reflection of the
characters' precarious efforts to rehabilitate the
tempestuous Grace. But any potential in this
storyline is ultimately squandered and trivial-

represents an important subset.

This immigration scenario, of course,
shares the limelight with a personal
drama. Isabel's relationship with
Christopher. While the idea of a film

parts of the world reflect different influences
depending on the prominent mode of expression that
rules the area. European films, especially those from
Central to Eastern Europe, tend to be like filmed
pieces of theatre. "Rumba" reflects this tradition,
including a theatre-like use of set space. In one
scene. Dominique and Fiona move between the bathroom and the bedroom in a shoebox cutout set. The
two rooms are shown simultaneously with the wall
between the two as a divider as if you had made a set
in a shoebox and were looking in on it. When
Dominique and Fiona are in the separate parts of the
house in this set, they can be seen as divided both
figuratively and literally as a result of their disabilities. Rather than just: interacting with their surroundings as people do in their daily lives, the actors
here use the space to express the tone of the scene.
It was a pleasure to see "Rumba." and hopefully
there are more gems like it in the festival circuit that
have yet to be discovered.

On Monday, April 30, the winners of the annual William Plumer Potter student fiction
contest, organized by the English Literature department were announced. The contest
was judged by novelist Elizabeth Strout, who was at the event to present the awards
with her own commentary as well as a reading from her novel "Olive Kitteridge."
Krystyn Mcllraith 'O9 received first place for her story "Rita Ann Lawrence, You Don't
Know Nothing about Nothing." Will Glovinsky 'l2 received second place for his story
"Taketh Away." Blanca Gamez 'O9 received third place for her story "Voice of Ghosts."
Here are excerpts from the winning stories.

Dominique and Fiona's love keeps their lives from
being fully negative, make this film very touching
and inspirational.
"Rumba" is a heartwarming film with a clear theatre influence. It is not a film in its truest sense as an
expression through cinematography. Rather, it is a
piece of theatre captured on film. This is not to say
that the film is lacking, but that films from different

ering the film's low budget, successfully utilizing techniques like flashbacks
and rapidly-shifting camera angles
(forgive my utter ignorance of film jargon) to create drama and tension.
However, these glossy film techniques

smack of those utilized more
fully in higher-budget mainstream
film. Overall, the film can be described

by a lackluster "decent." The most disappointing and frustrating aspect of
the viewing experience is that, in the
context of a film festival meant to foster innovation and experimentation.
"No Boundaries" adheres dogmatically to age-old Hollywood tropes.

From Krystyn Mcllraith's "Rita Ann Lawrence, You
Don't Know Nothing about Nothing:"

The past three days after school I've come home to sit
on my stoop and look for Loretta Anderson for the hour
before I have to leave for work. Her brothers, gangly,
short thirteen year old twins, walk five blocks home from
the junior high every day, their low-hanging, overfilled
backpacks jumping up and down against their butts.
I haven't seen her. Neither has Octavia, or anyone at
school. Nobody knows where she is. People say maybe
she's just been cutting every day. Other people say she
spends all her time in the nurse's office, or talking to the
guidance counselor. I imagine her in a corner of our
library, among stacks of outdated almanacs and dictionaries. Maybe she's sitting in the corner reading and reading but not really taking any of it in. Words blurring,
everything meaning the same thing. Maybe she's reading
books in Spanish, the language she and her brothers
speak with her father at home. Loretta Anderson doesn't
have a Mom anymore. She left when Letta was five,
walked down the street with gray duffel bags and that
was that.
I want to see if her chin doesn't point up at people's

foreheads anymore, if she doesn't put together the best
outfits out of any girl in the sophomore class at Hughes.
If anything is out of place. If she stopped wearing jewelry or straightening her hair. Or if she's walking around

seeds on Friday nights when he got off work selling
snacks at baseball games. On Saturdays we'd sit on my
stoop and spit the shells into buckets we'd set on the
stairs. The Neighborhood Buckets, we called them. We
took buckets from garages, basements, painters' trucks,
anywhere we could find them. I took them home and
painted numbers on them, and then we sat around spitting and tallying points. Four points for bucket four. Six
for bucket six. Crack, chew, spit.
Loretta's crazy grandma says she's a liar. Always has.
We were six and seven and the woman would stand on
the stoop in her housedress shaking a steel wire whisk
and saying, Ay, Letta, your Papi don't know what to do

to face Bill, and pointed to a sheet of
paper fixed by a magnet to the
refrigerator.
"I'm only on step four."
Bill Walked over to the paper.
On it there was a carefully written
list of Pat's morning ritual, like an
agenda that teachers write for
young students. Number one was
'let the cat in.' Pat had had a cat,
but it had gone missing, presumably due to his failure to comply

with number one.
"I'll make coffee," Bill offered.
Pat considered the idea for a
moment and agreed by disappearing into his bedroom.
Bill stepped toward the cupboard. Friday sniffed from a seated
position, slowly angling her blackbrown nose around the room.

backs; the old ones who did see her and moved away
together for her quick feet; the lone ones who watched her
furtively with sideward eyes and glances. I watched her
until she disappeared up the hill, out of the valley, past the
church where I used to sing.
I was glad to watch Regina alone. I wondered if before
becoming Regina Shore, Voice of Ghosts, before ever
imagining herself living in the Old Tammary Mansion
beside a lagoon of still herons and cranes, if she once had
to sing hymns as well. I wondered if she had a mother who
adjusted herself from day to day as if she were a paper doll
with detachable clothing and moods. She seemed like the
type of woman whose father was still alive. He probably
listened to her records with friends over dinnerand muttered quickly, a cigar close to his lips, that's my girl.
I wanted to meet her. To hear her voice when she wasn't singing.

Her voice was low. She's an alto like me.

April 2, 2009

Well,
I

have

to

admit, I
failed
you

this
week.
While I
d i d
complete

one
bucket
list
item of
p a n
ning a campus-wide event, I do not
want to bore you with the sleepless
details of an activity that made it
into The Phoenix last week, and
anything else I accomplished last
week is not worthy of your time. So,
instead of completing another bucket list item, I thought I'd relive a
legendary moment from freshman
year; a moment that, if I had not
already completed it, would definitely be on the top of my bucket
list now: the day I wore a towel to
class.
It's freshman year, we're playing
Assassins in Willets, and yes, I
eventually won. I'm having a fun
time with this strange, new game,
when I find out my new assassinator is the sophomore girl, let's call
her "Sheila", who left bruises on my
friend's arms during a Parrish
beach brawl, tricked another friend
into a situation of which he could
only escape by pulling down his
pants in the middle of Kohlberg,
and had been obsessed with winning Assassins for the past year. I
have never seen her, but I am determined to rectify these unjust acts
against my friends by preventing
this girl from assassinating me at
all costs: I shift into Hardcore
Defense Mode.
Hardcore Defense Mode forced
me to undergo numerous prank
phone calls, late night knocks on
my door, a 20-yard dash down the
science corridor to class followed
by a 5-minute "glue my butt to my
seat until my professor arrives or
prepare to take my pants off if all
else fails" panic, unnecessary extra
classes to prevent my assassinator
from knowing I ever went to or left
my classes, strange meals at
strange hours, early wakeups to
avoid an obsessed Sheila sitting
outside of the girls' bathroom, and a
constant thudding of the heart.
After a few days of this madness,
I finally decided that "enough was
enough!" This girl did not play nice
and my heart and I needed a day of
respite. The rule "You cannot assassinate someone while they're 'indecent'" came to mind. So, I woke up
early on the last day of her "death
squad-free" reign, walked to the
field house in my pajamas, with my
school bag, soccer equipment and a
handy-dandy towel.
I took a little nap, ate my breakfast in the locker room, and then
changed into my fabulous green
towel. I put on my snazzy sequin
hat to top off the outfit, slipped on
my shoes and headed off to class. I
then proceeded to sit through
Spanish, receiving a quiet, "I'm not

"

sure what I'm supposed to say, so I
won't say much" response from el
querido Professor Machuca, went
to Sharpies for a stress-free lunch
and went to a Soc/Anth class with
Professor Sheller who also politely
accepted my strange attire. My
most gratifying moment was when
Sheila came over to me at lunch
and, recognizing her defeat on this
particular day, said, "That was a
really cool idea." (Although I swear,
evidenced by her roaming eyes and
fidgety hands, she was searching
for a way to rip the towel off of me
right then and there.)
Sadly, my victory was not so
simply won there. I had soccer practice later that day, and I knew that
Sheila would not miss the opportunity to catch me out of my towel.
Proving my insanity to the team, I
wore my towel to Cunningham
Field and changed into my uniform
there. Lo and behold, we are not
even a few minutes into practice
when Sheila decides to be a 'spectator.' My teammates are ready to
form a circle around me if necessary, and although I informed my
coach of the situation, he still
thinks this is all a joke (he's new to
Swarthmore).
Next thing I know, Sheila runs
onto the field and after me during
warm-ups. I run away (like lightning!) and get my coach's attention.
He finally understands the seriousness behind my words and tells her

that she is allowed to stay at our

practice but that she cannot come
onto the field (a.k.a. she has to wait
until I step off of the field to get me).
Of course, I somehow "accidentally" get a little too close to her while
chasing a ball (call me stupid or
'ballsy,' your call).
Not wanting to miss the opportunity, Sheila charges after me. Like a
little kid on the playground, I dash
toward my coach (who for me is
'base') and he sees the "rule-break-

er." With my luck, this violation of

policy had Coach sending her off of
Cunningham and back to her little
Willets hole. After practice, I
changed back into my towel, while
the girls surrounded me, certain
that my assassinator was probably
waiting in the woods, and my won-

derful assistant coach, amused that
I was going cuckoo, agreed to drive
me to the back of Willets (bless
her!).

The rest of the story is history.
The next day the Death Squad
caught her, and I cleverly proceeded to climb to victory, hiding
behind classroom doors, staking
out behind trees, and circling
around Professor Tierney with a
fellow freshman in a full-out, physical duel (Forget the gym, just play
Assassins for a week). Since then,
I've published the book, "ASSassins
for Dummies" and have a strong
Facebook following. "2005 Willets
ASSassins Champ" is also on my
resume (is that why I can't find a
job?). Anyone out there in need of a
Hardcore Defense Mode ASSassins
training session, make sure you
contact me before this invaluable
resource graduates. I'll be waiting
to meet you in a green towel.

There was a song my father would sing for my sister
and I when we were children, a novelty song from the
19605. They're coming to take me away, ha ha, he he, ho
ho. To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time.
Oh I'll be glad to see those nice young men in those clean
white suits. They're coming to take me away, ha ha.
They're coming to take me away. He gave a great performance, eyes bulging, his voice modulating and breaking, and my sister and I would crack up and beg him to
sing it again. One day he refused, and when we asked
him why, he said the song was disrespectful to the mentally ill.
I remember leaving the emergency room that day. I
was being taken to McLean Hospital in Belmont. The
hospital was twenty-five minutes from my home, but in
compliance with insurance regulations I was strapped to
a wheeled stretcher and driven over in an ambulance. I
remember my father crouching there next to me as we
drove, genially conversing with the two attendants and
sporadically squeezing my hand. I attempted to contribute to the discussion, but I could not sit up or move,
and try as I might I could not prevent myself from thinking: They're coming to take me away, ha ha. They're coming to take me away.
I arrived at McLean Hospital late that night and was
taken to a diagnostic unit, where I was told I would stay
for two days or so while I completed some tests.
Unfortunately, I made the mistake of having my psychological breakdown on a federal holiday, and the McLean
staff had been given a four-day weekend; it makes sense,
I think, that those who attend to the insane and the suicidal receive the same professional benefits as custodians and garbage collectors. As it happened, I would
spend almost a week there.
There were four wings on the diagnostic ward, with a
large panopticon in the center. The windows had cordless blinds and were reinforced with iron grating. There
were no corners, no closets, no places one could go ifone
desired privacy. I stayed in my room most of the time. I
listened to my music player, although I had to go out to
the panopticon to charge it, because they had confiscated my power cord so that I couldn't hang myself. I read
and drew. I had blood drawn at least once a day. I played
a game, almost entirely out of spite, where I looked for
ways to circumvent their precautions and kill myself:
smother myself with a shower curtain, stab a plastic
knife into my eye, shatter a lamp in the bathroom and

slit my throat with the pieces. I took naps whenever possible, which was mercifully often because they kept me
drugged to the gills. I was put on anti-psychotics for several days, and one morning I awoke to find my hands

shaking uncontrollably.
Eventually I met with professional psychiatrists for
an official diagnosis. I was told my condition was severe
enough to warrant consideration for treatment at the
McLean OCD Institute. However, my social worker
expressed concern as to my willingness to cooperate,
and observed that I had not attended any socialization
groups since admission. I said that I was here to be diagnosed and that I had no interest in participating, but she
glared at me, barely restraining her contempt, and then
my neurosis around authority kicked in. I winced as if
struck and profusely apologized. Later my parents told
me that they understood my desire for isolation, but that
it might improve my chances for actual treatment if I
cooperated. So it was settled. I had to make friends.
I stayed for breakfast meeting the next morning. We

sat around at small circular tables, and were told to state
for the group our goals for the day. Gunter was first.
Gunter was a bald, middle-aged German man, and when
asked he stood up on the

informed the rest of us with
tremendous enthusiasm that he would
today live up to his name, Gunter, Gunter, glorious
name of God Gunter, and that he would be flying home
tonight on the Frankenfurter. The rest of us stated our
own goals, somewhat anticlimactically, and we settled
back to breakfast. Someone turned on the television. The
channel was set to VHI and, I swear to God I wouldn't
make something like this up, they were playing the
video for Gnarls Barkley's "Crazy."
I laughed, and I laughed and laughed. No one else
seemed to find it funny.
I began to get to know the other patients. There was
an obese woman with a piled-up hairdo who wheedled
me to set her up with my father. There was a small
Russian woman who wandered the halls silently,
always staring forward, like a ghost; a man who I
think was her husband would visit and walk with her,
holding her hand, neither of them speaking. There
was a young poet with bandages down his arms. There
was a bulky Middle Eastern guy in his twenties, so
thoroughly medicated that he could only stomp
around and drool. I remember once he emitted an
approving growl and began to stumble towards a
young female patient, hands reaching for her breasts.

..April 2,2009

She squealed in horror and he was quickly restrained.
There was a plump Jewish woman in her early fifties.
She skip-walked like a child, teetering on too-small high
heels; she always wore a short purple dress, stretched
tight over her swollen stomach, so she looked like an
overripe plum. I encountered her once eating a box of
Nilla Wafers in a chair by the panopticon. She asked me
to take the box from her, and when I declined she
snarled at me. "Take it." I gingerly lifted the box from
her hands, and she explained surreptitiously that she
didn't want the patients to take the cookies. I nodded and
paused for a moment, and then handed the box back to
her. Another time I encountered her in the same lounge,
moaning and sighing, hands rubbing over her body and
head tiltedback in ecstasy. "Harold," she groaned. That
time I was careful not to attract attention.
I also met Lacey. Lacey was an elderly, compact
woman with a strong Boston accent. Lacey spoke to God.
She brought it up casually in conversation; "I went into
the house," she said, "because God told me to, and then
the police came and took me to the hospital." She would
gather together other patients, the Russian woman and
others, and they would sing dissonant hymns together
and beg God to heal their afflictions often directly outside my room. Lacey took a liking to me, and told me
that Jesus could save me from my illness. I politely
declined. But it occurred to me, more than once, that my
symptoms might represent some kind of demonic influence, that God was punishing me. The rational part of
my mindtried to dismiss this. Yet I could not claim with
absolute certainty that it was not true.
I was brought to the diagnostic unit largely as a formality, so that the hospital could confirm my disorder
for its records, and I could later receive specialized treatment. The actual diagnosis might have been completed
in less than a day. Yet there I was, in the immediate aftermath of a psychological breakdown, urged to engage in
inane social performance with deeply troubled people. I
was vulnerable, my perverse and religious obsessions
were triggered continuously; and had I been determined
to hurt myself, I am certain I could have done so without
difficulty. I was kidnapped and blackmailed, and if I did
not comply my best chance at sanity was forfeit. In a lifetime of dodgy psychological treatment, of countless
moments of absurdity and incompetence, this was the
weirdest and the most utterly senseless thing to happen
to me. It was purgatory, an in-between place, a joke that
seemed obvious and trite on every comprehensible level.
Apparently the alcoholics got their own diagnostic
unit. Lucky bastards.
I did what was asked of me. I attended a gardening
session, and talked to a young mother with postpartum
depression; I went to fitness group and watched Lacey
lob around a deflated basketball. I visited a seminar in
the hospital's outpatient program, a few hours after they
changed my medication, and struggled to maintain consciousness. I met again with the treatment team and
expressed utter contrition for my previous unenlightened attitude and the bulky woman decided I was
redeemable. In any case, they let me go. The real work
could begin.

'Kings' loses the sandals, keeps the story intact

swarthmorephoenix.com

Pop culture

scriptural

stories for
contemporary times.
Greek
myths,

Shakes-

Alex Israel
Pencils Down,
Pass the Remote

peare plays

and
Jane
Austen nove^s have all
been transplanted

to

the 20th (or 21st) century, but when it
comes to stories from scripture we seem
to prefer robes, sandals and archaic (even
Aramaic) dialogue. Even Monty Python's
loopy, revisionist "Life of Brian" took
place in the original historical epoch.
The creators of the new NBC show
"Kings" then, took a risk by transplanting
the story of King David to a hypothetical
near-future (or alternate universe, or
something) where bows and swords nave
become tanks and guns and palaces have
been replaced with steel-and-glass skyscrapers. The cast of characters, however,
has remained largely the same, which
allows for the basic Biblical story of corruption, power and purity triumphing
over depravity (for a while, anyway) to
play out in much the same way as the
original.
And play out they do, in a power struggle between two men that is fascinating
despite the fact that the source material is

several thousand years old and the conclusion has, therefore, already been
decided. (Say what you will about the
Bible and those who thump it, but the stories have stuck around for so long
because they're really, really good.) In the
world of "Kings," theBiblical Saul is Silas
Benjamin, King of Gilboa ("Deadwood'"s
master of depravity lan McShane), a slick
power player whose impeccable suits
hide a soul that is rotting from the inside.
Silas' foil is David Shepherd

(Christopher Egan, an Australian who
belongs to the Heath Ledger school of gorgeous), a naively good-looking soldier in
the Gilboanarmy who rockets to national
prominence after single-handedly facing

down an enemy tank, known as a Goliath.

(Minus points for lack of subtlety here,
but I can totally see an army naming a
tank after a Biblical giant). During the

course of this heroic action, David saves
the life of Silas' son, Jack Benjamin (occasional "Gossip Girl" player and real-life
Leighton Meester beau Sebastian Stan),
which earns him the King's recognition
and a cushy post in the new, shiny
Gilboan capital, Shiloh (a digitized,
bizarrely
new
and shiny-looking
Manhattan). Well, it seems cushy, at least
until David's star begins to outshine
those of Jack and Silas, a development
that puts his life into no small danger.
Also, he has a thing for Silas' daughter
Michelle (Allison Miller), which probably
doesn't help his safety. (You know how
dads are).
"Kings" has a compelling story going
for it, and it dramatizes that story with
some beautifully shot set pieces, the most
intriguing of which is David's encounter
with the Goliath. The scene plays out in
the sickly shade of night-vision green
made familiar in coverage of the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, and the action is
shown in large part through the camera
of an astonished Gilboan soldier, whose
photographs bring David to the attention
of King and country. The device of shooting through the camera is evocative,
bringing to mind both the Biblical confrontation between David and Goliath
and the famed photo of the Tiananmen
Square protester standing up to a line of
tanks. The camera also adds some nice
commentary about the world of YouTube
and 24-hour news (a theme that resurfaces in later episodes) and shows just
enough action to allow for a twist later in
the episode. To put it simply, it's a hell of
a scene.
The technical aspects of the show are
impressive (except for one scene that
involved some very fake-looking CGI butterflies), but technical prowess means

nothing without strong performances.
Luckily for "Kings," the cast has talent in
spades. (Well, except for Miller, who plays
Michelle with so little personality that I
keep forgetting she even exists). The star
of the show is McShane, an actor so

beloved for his role on "Deadwood" that
critics would probably endorse a choice
to emcee "Paris Hilton's My New BFF."
Luckily for the rest of us, he declined that
invitation in order to deliver another
great performance; his Silas is dangerously charismatic, a decadent, corrupt
monarch who survives on his ability to
manipulate everyone around him. The
genius of McShane's performance, however, is that he allows Silas an occasional
flash of humanity, a glimpse at who the
man could have been had he not been corrupted by the power that he claims as his
destiny.
As fascinating as Silas is, however, the
show does not belong solely to McShane.
Emerson is convincing and likeable as
David, a farm boy and soldier whose experience has not prepared him for the political intrigue of Shiloh. Susanna
Thompson is a picture of WASP-y perfection as Queen Rose, an icy figure whose

ambitions may exceed her husband's,
while Dylan Baker is appropriately
sleazy as her brother, the power behind a
Halliburton-esque corporation know as
CrossGen. And another HBO alumnus,
Eamonn Walker of "Oz," plays the
Reverend Samuels (as in the prophet
Samuel) as a powerful man who can be a
source of wisdom and strength, but whose
conviction that he is the mouthpiece of
God often leads him to be cold, if not
downright cruel.
The most compelling story, however
(aside from the central conflict between
David and Silas), is that of Jack. As
played by Stan, Jack is a character whose
pouty lips and party-boy ways cover both
his extreme selfishness and an obsessive
desire to please his father. Silas, however,
will never be pleased with Jack because
the prince, no matter how he hides it, is
gay, a fact that the king cannot accept.
Jack's predicament makes one thing
clear: the buildings may be shinier and
the crown might have been exchanged for
a three-piece suit, but prejudices haven't
changed.

New 'Tale' falls faster than the French monarchy
BY ANNE COLEMAN

acolemal@swarthmore.edu

Transforming a book into a
play can be just as risky as turning it into a screenplay. Where
film adaptations are at the
mercy of the fans, play adaptations not only risk accusations
of straying from the text, but
also of being too much like the
book. We go to the theater to see
a play, not to hear a book, but
adaptations, particularly those

of classical literature, often fail
to function as stand-alone
works.
Take the new adaptation of
Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two
Cities," currently playing at The
People's
Light &
Theatre
Company, as an example. The
production's greatest shortcoming may well be the fact that it is
based on a famous book.
The story of good people
caught in the crossfire of the
French Revolution, "A Tale of
Two Cities" should be anything

14

but dull. After removing her
father (Stephen Novelli) from
Paris, where he had spent eighteen years in the Bastille Prison
for defying nobles, to a quiet life
in London, Lucie Manette
(Julianna Zinkel) becomes the
object of affection for two very
different, nearly identical men.
The first, a Frenchman in selfimposed exile, goes by the name
Darnay
(Michael
Charles
Stewart Allen) to conceal his
status as a member of the
French nobility. When Darnay
is accused of stealing British
secrets, it is his doppelganger,
Syndey Carton (Kevin Bergen),
who saves the day by casting
doubt on the accuracy of an eyewitness' testimony. Carton is no
match for Darnay's cheery disposition when it comes to winning Lucie's affection, but when
Darnay is dragged into prison in
France to answer for his family's crimes, Carton is once again
in the position to save the day
and prove his loyalty to Lucie.

The narrative has all of the

ingredients of a drama, requiring none of the action enhancement that similar classics need,

but it nonetheless falls flat. Too
often, characters tell, rather
than show, the story, leaving the
few truly engaged characters to
flounder. It is a failing both of
the adaptation, for which this
production is the East Coast premiere, and of the direction.
The raw material is there,
with an obviously talented
ensemble of actors and designers, but adaptor Dwayne
Hartford and director Ken
Marini are held back by their
focus on Dickens. "A Tale of Two
Cities" is a timely and powerful
story which explores the politics
of fear and the struggle to
remain faithful in the face of
atrocities. It is a story about surviving and finding something or
someone worth living and dying
for, but if it weren't for the characters telling everyone who will
listen that they have done just

April 2, 2009

that, then it would be possible to
miss that fact until the very last
scene of the play, when Sydney
Carton does that "far, far better
thing
than [he has] ever
done."
There are some performances, however, worth mention.
Mary Elizabeth Scallen, as the
revolutionary Madame Defarge,
gives a fiery, impassioned performance that feels more Lady
Macbeth than Dickensian in the
context of this production. She
is fierce and imposing, but
entirely accessible; even when
...

Mme. Defarge's revolutionary

spirit begins to look more like

pure bloodlust, the audience's

connection with her is tangible.
As Miss Pross, the comedic
force of the play, Marcia
Saunders is engaging. Pross'

English superiority complex,
very pronounced upon her
arrival in Paris, gives voice to

the audience's concerns on occasion, and Saunders does an
admirable job with the chal-

lenge.

Another effort worth men-

tioning is that of the multimedia
designer, Anton Marini. Marini
designed black and white
synched projections and recordings that allow live actors to

conduct conversations with
their recorded selves and to
emerge from within old film
clips. His projections bridge the
divide between the demands of
Dickens' text and the nature of
live performance in a way that
Marini's direction alone could
not have done. The number of
projections is limited, however,
and the device is not enough to
relieve the adaptation of its limitations.
This production is more of a
Cliff Notes version of the
Dickens' tale than it is a new
take on the classic. It is true to
the text and visually interesting
they use the space quite well
but it provides no new insight
into Dickens' work, and fails to
realize its dramatic potential.

Sony media: Pope is right Transitioning from
an American world

BY LAURA WOLK
lwolkl@swarthmore.edu

As a cradle Catholic, I'm
hardly surprised that the
mmmmm H°ly Father's
comments last

TI%

week generated such controversy in the liberal
media. Sadly, I found little
more than the same rehashing of misrepresented APsound bites in the Phoenix's
staff editorial on March 19
entitled "The Pope courts a
contraception controversy."
I want to clarify some of the
misconceptions reported in
this and like-minded articles.
The Phoenix ridicules
Benedict's comments by
saying that "nearly every
study" contradicts his claim
that condoms alone cannot
solve the AIDS problem, and
might even aggravate it.
They cite a source (the infallible New York Times),
which reports that "condoms, when used consistently and correctly," reduce
AIDS. There are three interesting words here: "nearly,"
"correctly" and "consistently." Though it may be true
that the consistent and correct use of condoms reduces
AIDS rates, how often is this
the case?
Let's look at one of the
studies which corroborates
the Pope's claims. Two
researchers at the AIDS
at
Project
Prevention
Harvard agree that condom
use has reduced the rate of
AIDS in certain high-risk
populations
(Thai
and
Cambodian brothels, for
instance). The researchers

contest generalizing this
finding to the population
level, instead citing evi-

dence that illustrates the
failure of programs to
engender consistent, correct
condom use. A 2001 rural
Ugandan study found that
4.4 percent of participants
reported consistent condom
use in 2000. A more recent
controlled,
randomized
study in Zimbabwe, which
combined condom use with
other preventative practices, showed no reduction
in the spread of AIDS at the
population level, and a
slight increase of infections
in the prevention group
compared to controls.
The researchers also
point out that condoms can
lead to "risk compensation"
engaging in more promisactivity
cuous
sexual
because of the sense of security provided by condoms.
To understand this, one
need only think of the analogous situation in which the
legally mandated incorporation of seatbelts in cars has,
in part, contributed to higher speed limits, reckless
driving and accident rates.
Additionally, in the nine
African countries where
AIDS rates have dropped,
researchers
have
also
observed a correlated drop
in extramarital sex or multiple sex partners. Swaziland
and Botswana have since
adapted MCP programs, in
apparent recognition of the
validity behind the promotion of sexual integrity to
reduce AIDS rates.
This evidence indicates
that solely promoting condom use does not necessari-

ly lead to a reduction in
AIDS, and could potentially
raise it. Though the Pope
understands this, selective
quoting obfuscates his message. The Phoenix extracts
one sentence from the interview, labeling it "simplistic"
and "counterfactual."
What is the Church's condom-free solution? Let's put
it back in context. "[lt] can
only be a double one: first, a
humanization of sexuality
a new way of behaving
with one another. Second, a
true friendship even and
especially with those who
suffer, a willingness to be
with those who are suffer...

ing."

Thus, the Pope proposes
that this epidemic cannot be
curbed with quick fixes
such as convincing individuals to use contraceptives,
for such an approach does
not recognize the inherent
dignity of those in need;
love,
without
mutual
respect and long suffering,
true understanding and
progress cannot occur.
Before we label his views
as close-minded and ignorant, we must put away our
biases concerning conservative religious groups and
thoroughly examine the evidence, determine the effectiveness of preventative
solutions compared to longterm sexual integrity programs, and rethink our
myopic obsession with condoms as a panacea. The Pope
is not courting a contraceptive controversy; the controversy comes from the media
who finds divisive partyline dogma more important
than seeking the truth.

The Cold War, and more specifically the
post-WWII economic boom that jetted the
United States far ahead of the rest of the
world, did strange things to the American
psyche. The baby boomers and their immediate successors the forty-, fifty- and sixtysomethings who lived through an era of
can be
unprecedented unilateral power
forgiven (maybe) for developing something

of an ego. The fall of the Soviet Union and yet
a further economic boom in the 1990s
cemented vague notions of supremacy and
arrogance firmly in place: American power
David Sterngold
and hegemony became the unchallenged staPragmatism Not Idealism
tus quo a pleasant mantra of the past and
present, and an implicit conviction for the
future.
Two body blows suffered in the past six years have knocked the wind
out of this collective illusion. First came the failed war in Iraq, rebuffing
the idea that the United States could go it alone on pure military might.
Still, a small hiccup in the Middle East could not totally shake the nation's
faith
there was still our overwhelming economic and cultural "soft"
power to fall back on. That thought lasted until the beginning of the current financial crisis, which has many questioning the longevity or feasibility of our role as the economic leader, given the concomitant rise of
competitive economic blocs in Asia and in Europe. Now, on the eve of the
G-20 London Summit, which will host 20 of the world's largest economies,
it's time for Americans to think seriously about what a post-American
world order might look like.
For one, it will be diverse. Expanding economic blocs like China, India,
Brazil, Russia and the E.U. ultimately want more of a share in the international economic system, and the increased leverage and autonomy that
this entails. In the short term, this struggle is manifest in China and
India's claims for a greater voice in global financial institutions like the
1.M.F., which is controlled primarily by the United States and Europe.
When the head of China's central bank called for supplanting the U.S. dollar
which functions as the world's "default reserve currency"
with a
synthetic form of money known as SDR's, the suggestion wasn't taken
very seriously, but its sentiment was. The Chinese feel they have a right
to participate in organizing the new international system, and they are
not alone.
Unfortunately, the new players do not share the American leadership's
vision of what this international system might look like, or how best to
accomplish it. London should offer them an excellent forum to voice their
respective interests Americans should take notice as the ideas, tensions
and influences of the future world economy sound their nascent cries.
A particularly salient and contentious issue is how to most effectively
boost the international economy out of recession. American economists,
notably columnist Paul Krugman, are pushing hard for foreign countries
to adopt their own versions of the recently passed U.S. stimulus package.
The idea is that jump-starting our domestic economy is less effective if
trading partners are still bogged down and can't buy exported American
goods, or are forced to raise prices on their own exports.
Many European nations counter that their extensive social safety nets
have cushioned the blow of the recession, and are opting for less stimulus
spending. A priority for the American G-20 representatives will be trying
to convince Europe to pledge as much money as possible, both for their
own European stimulus efforts, and for contributions to the 1.M.F., which
acts a supranational stimulus spender.
There are other divisive issues. For example, how should the new system address the problem of climate change? Since being exempted from
the major provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, China and India's emissions
have risen by 150 and 103 percent (in the period 1992-2007). The European
economic bloc, which has showcased the most initiative on this issue, will
have a hell of a time convincing countries with such stupendous economic growth rates to slow down for the sake of posterity.
So, having more nations involved in developing an international system will surely lead to fresh conflicts. But from the American perspective,
fear of a multi-polar economic world stems from the astute recognition
that, if myriad nations are consuming a greater percentage of the international economic pie, someone (guess who?) will have to consume less.
The idea that the United States might not remain the dominant player
in world affairs until the end of time really shouldn't be so surprising. It
also shouldn't be that scary. Is a nation only great because of the magnitude of its G.D.P? Are we patriots merely because our nation has the ability to push its agenda so forcefully throughout the world? The United
States can still occupy a good seat at the table, and can still be its most
illustrious guest. It's just that, come dessert, we won't be able to eat as
much pie.

A letter to China Reviving the collection tradition
Staff Editorial

To the People's Republic of
China:
Recently, the RR.C. has been
embroiled in more dictatorial,
freedom-squelching controversies, at least according to the

Western media. Two of these
controversies have occurred in
the last month, both having to
do with the ever-troublesome
region of Tibet.
First, YouTube.com access
was blocked within China for
James Mao
the umpteenth time after some
Over InternationalBorders
jokers in the Tibetan governm ment in exile decided to compile
fabricated video of Chinese
police brutalizing Tibetan rioters last year. While this blocking of YouTube was hilarious to me, mostly because ofthe frustration that my friends still living in Beijing must be feeling,
the second controversy the ruling Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) got involved in has me questioning whether the government had to resort to the measures it did.
The second controversy occurred last week, when the Dalai
Lama and the Tibetan government in exile insinuated that the
CCP had hacked into its server and accessed classified documents. In fact, an electronic network that researchers dubbed
"Ghost Net" had targeted over 103 countries. The internet
researchers pointed out that there was "no conclusive evidence" that the hacking was in fact the wor.k of the Chinese
government, but there was enough hinting from Tibet and the
Western media that the CCP felt compelled to deny involvement in the spying.
I am sure, however, that there are plenty of people who are
prepared to believe that the Chinese government was in fact
hacking the Dalai Lama's computer (it sounds like a bad
Keanu Reeves movie to me too), and I don't blame them. When
has the P.R.C. shown any qualms about violating privacies?
If Fox News decided to say tomorrow that China had quarantined every ex-pat in Beijing for background checks, I am
willing to bet that most of the Western worldwould believe the
allegation's credibility without pausing to wonder about the
ridiculousness of such a measure. And that, I think, is the
whole problem: the measures taken by the Chinese government, now and in the past, have been such prime targets for
accusations of totalitarianism and undemocratic processes
that almost anything can be expected from them. So I looked
at those two controversies again and I thought, there are many
more and often better options available to China than the
ones that tamper with citizen rights.
For example, when those clowns in the exiled Tibetan government decided to libel the world's newest superpower, it
probably wasn't necessary to deny YouTube access from the
world's largest amount of Internet users. Instead, how about
issuing a disapproving statement directed at the felonious
Tibetan government? (While we're at it, how about issuing a
statement expressing disappointment with the Western
media, which somehow overlooked the fact that one government had made up complete lies about another one, and instead
chose to wet its pants over the YouTube "scandal?) There's no
need to reinforce the world's negative perception of China.
Don't get me wrong; I don't have a problem with the blocking of YouTube itself, at least not at this juncture. After all, the
P.R.C. is still developing both economically and politically. As
our very own Yu Hua, author of the internationally acclaimed
novel "To Live," noted last week at Swarthmore College,
China is a country that has in three decades developed to a
point that took Western civilization 300 years to get to.
But at the same time, it's undeniable that China manages
to find some way to shoot itself in the foot even in a good situation. A few months ago, The Economist ran a revealing piece
about China's relaxing of Internet censorship for foreign journalists during the Olympics, which went south once the journalists logged onto other computers and found many sites
blocked that were not barred from their own computers. It's
these types of public relations blunders that allow China to be
so easily condemned. The maddening thing is that they are so
easily avoidable.
It hasn't been the greatest few months for the P.R.C.
Between the poisoned milk and the toy scandal, not to mention
the latest Tibet-related fiascos, it is getting hard to justify
China's actions even to myself. And after watching Michigan
State and Missouri completely eviscerate my March Madness
bracket, I could definitely use some good news. So do me
proud, China. One well-thought-out step at a time.

THE PHOENIX

Earlier this week, the administration sent out an e-mail notifying students of a new page on the
Swarthmore website designed to
inform the community about
changes in the college's budget.
Today, however, we would like
to propose an entirely different
forum for student opinions and
concerns about college finances
and any other issues that arise.
We propose the revival of the
Swarthmore collection, which is a
Quaker tradition dating back to
the founding of the College that
has been continued only intermittently since.
A Quaker collection is a public
meeting where members of the
community come to gather and
discuss spiritual and secular concerns. Those attending remain
silent until they are moved to
speak, at which point they rise
and give voice to their concerns.
We propose a modified version
of the Quaker practice. The meetings should be formatted the same
way, with attendees sitting silently and listening until they are
ready to speak, but we propose
that the meetings remain entirely

secular, and, in the interests of
ensuring that the meetings are
productive and that the most
urgent concerns are aired, that the
central issues of the collection are
decided upon in advance.
The issue, orissues, that will be
discussed should pertain to the
Swarthmore College and community, and will be decided by student vote. Student-suggested topics can be posted on the college
Dashboard, and, as we anticipate
the collection occurring once a
month, students should have adequate time to brainstorm and vote
on the best discussion topics. By
holding the collection once a
month, as opposed to the weekly
formula attempted earlier in the
college's history, topics for discussion will more easily accumulate,
and busier students will have easier times participating and contributing to the tradition. No classes, clubs or sports practices should
be scheduled during the time set
aside for collection, for while the
meetings ought to be perfectly voluntary, it is imperative that every
student who wants to attend has
the opportunity to do so.

It is crucial that the discussion

are
student
led.
Administrators should be invited
to attend and participate, but only
in their capacity as individuals
and members of the Swarthmore
topics

community.

Our school has a proud history
of activism that continues to this
day. We believe the proposed
monthly collection will enhance
this tradition. We would like there
to be a meeting place where students can discuss a multiplicity of
issues that affect the campus,
under the auspices ofneither club
nor administration. The meeting
will serve no one's agenda, and
will merely be a place for students
to announce their thoughts and
participate in public discussion.
We welcome every additional
channel that is opened between
administration and student. But it
is only through public meetings,
where students can hear each
other's thoughts, publicly formulate new ideas, and, potentially,
form coalitions to change administration policy, that real, studentdriven change will occur and a
true community can be built.

Students should pay for their paper
BY SOREN LARSON
slarsonl@swarthmore. edu

For a bunch of tree huggers, we sure use a lot of

paper. Lisa Brunner Bireley of ITS said on Monday

that ITS has purchased L7B million

pages of paper for library use thus far
this school year, and ITS might have to

buy more. Paper consumption is out of
control here and it doesn't seem like the Green March
initiative will change much. Unfortunately, our printing privileges are the problem.
By making printing free on campus, the college
implicitly tells students that paper has no value and
that treating it like it has no value isn't bad.
Accordingly, students print excessively and have few
qualms about not collecting their printouts. But who
paper is worthless, right? To reduce paper
cares
consumption on campus, the college should charge
students some penalty for printing excessively.
While we all appreciate free printing, few of us
appreciate its costs. Free printing changes student
consumption behavior by distorting the true costs of
products we consume. Instead of buying a used textbook online, I'll download a free or heavily discounted version and print it for free. I don't want to buy
paper fill, so I'll just use the free paper the college
offers us. By giving away printing products, the college generates artificially high consumption, which
siphons funds from valuable programs.
It gets worse. In addition to the college creating
incentives for students to consume unnecessarily, students have no compelling reason to conserve. We recognize that waste is bad, but the consequences of our
excessive paper consumption aren't clear.
Students need a direct incentive to save paper
students need to pay for it. I propose a point-based system that allocates some number of pages based on a
formula that should account for class load, paper
demands of certain academic areas and W-course designation. Any printing beyond this amount should
add some fee to student library accounts (say five
cents), which, after students have passed some threshold, should restrict or limit borrowing until students
pay librarians, who can re-enable students' accounts.
The system must include some leeway, so I propose if
students or professors find the predetermined printout allocation to be inadequate, they fill out an application that should require students and/or professors

April 2, 2009

to explain why they need more paper. This application process should be bothersome enough to discourage all but the most legitimately paper-hungry students from applying. The college should not be
lenient about this additional process. Groups might
also need printing privileges, which they can attain
via some application process. To reduce the time students spend printing materials and the number of
pages left unclaimed at printers, professors should
print and bind reading materials before semesters
begin and sell such pamphlets in the bookstore for the
price of the pamphlets' production. This will reduce
student printing in general, assign real value to the
paper products we consume and simplify my plan.
If this isn't appealing, there is another, though less
effective solution. Given the college's Quaker heritage, Swarthmore may want to continue to give students unlimited printing privileges. In this case, the
college should aim to reduce the paper students print
but never pick up. It could do so by requiring students to, after having sent their desired documents to
the printer, sign in at computers stationed by printers
to command printers to actually print their documents. In this scenario, printers will only print documents relayed from adjacent computers. This solution seems the best because printing remains free and
we diminish unclaimed, wasted paper at printers.
But this system imposes costs as well. Instead of paying monetarily, students must pay with their time.
Given the lines that will undoubtedly form at these
relay computers, this time will be considerable. But
with time's opportunity cost varying widely among
students, this solution isn't perfect because some students would be better off by paying for printing with
cash and using their timefor other things.
All students should have access to the same
resources on campus, but current paper usage policy
isn't forcing students to internalize their consumption and waste. I doubt this idea will be popular, but
far too many of our actions carry costs that don't
appear in current pricing structures. Global warming
justmight be the consequence of such a phenomenon.
As famous economist Ronald Coase argued, society
can resolve externalities by inserting them into the
market. In our process of learning, wasted paper is a
negative externality whose cost we, as students, don't
internalize. However, if the college demands students
pay for paper even if no money is exchanged we
will see a dramatic reduction in paper consumption.

Women serve against ranked opponents on court
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

Seven matches into the 2009 season, Swarthmore
women's tennis has a 3-4 overall record, including wins
over its first two Centennial Conference opponents,
Gettysburg and Bryn Mawr. Despite its three early
losses, the Garnet still hold the number eight spot in
the Intercollegiate Tennis Associates Division 111
Women's Atlantic South Regional Rankings.
The team retained the rank after its shaky start
partly because all three losses came against nationally
ranked opponents during the team's spring break trip
to the South. Fifth ranked Emory, #2O University of the
South, and #3O Rhodes defeated the Garnet with scores
of 8-1, 7-2, and 7-2, respectively.
While his team came out of spring break winless,
head coach Jeremy Loomis still viewed the trip as a
positive experience. "[Nationally ranked teams] give
us good competition for playing people that give you no
free points, and that toughens you up," he said. "We
don't want to be behind the ball as far as playing tough
points."

In other words, the Garnet had to work hard for

every success, and they did see some. "Team-wise we
didn't come away with any wins, but there were defi-

nitely some bright spots," Loomis said. "We just couldn't pull it all together." He did, however, commend a
number of individual performances.
Swarthmore's No. 1 singles player Rachel Wallwork
'lO, last year's Centennial Conference Player of the
Year, defeated Emory's Loren McManigle, currently
the top-ranked singles player in the Atlantic South

region. After the victory, Wallwork's Atlantic South
ranking shot up to #lO.
Against University of the South, Luann Cignavitch
'll also beat a ranked player, #25 Devin Tellatin. As a
doubles team, co-captain Jennie Park 'O9 and Wallwork
beat the University of the South's top doubles pair,
ranked #ll nationally. As a result, Park and Wallwork
received the #5 regional ranking in the subsequent
poll.
Loomis recognized, however, that individual success does not translate into winning. "We can't rely on
just a few individual performances," he said. He then
noted how, after break, the Garnet put in a team effort
against conference opponents. His squad handled
Gettysburg easily on the road on March 21, only dropping one of the nine matches.
The Garnet put in another strong effort at home
against Bryn Mawr on March 26, winning by a score of
6-3.
For the rest of the season, Loomis has set some goals
for his players. He seeks to give the women the opportunity to "keep improving each match, stay healthy,
compete and get into the conference playoffs."
Staying healthy is particularly important. The 2009
roster is a little thin after two players who started the
season with the team are now unable to play. The
remaining seven players are picking up the pieces and
moving on.
"My personal goal," Loomis added, "is for the team
to be peaking at the end of the season so we can make

the conference tournament." He added that if
Swarthmore can gain a postseason berth, anything
could happen.

Softball strikes out in first pair of
Centennial Conf. doubleheaders
BY EMILY BRYANT

ebryantl@swarthmore.edu

Garnet Softball (9-14, 0-4 CC) opened up 2009
Centennial Conference action against Dickinson last
weekend. The women were swept in the doubleheader
by the Devils in a weekend full of wet weather.
The first contest was pushed back due to inclement
weather. The team sprang out to a 3-1 lead over the
Devils, with doubles from Melissa Emerson 'll and Zoe
Hendrickson 'IL Catcher Kira Kern 'll added an RBI
single to increase the Garnet lead.
However, Swarthmore could not keep the lead alive,
as the Devils tallied three runs over the next three
innings. Shortstop Liz Cushing 'l2 kept the team's
hopes going by adding an RBI in the seventh, but it was
not enough for a comeback.
Dickinson pitcher Liz Barry struck out five batters
and had no walks to seal the win. Alexandra Zelaski 'O9
fell to 3-6 in pitching for the Garnet.
During the second contest, the Garnet continued to
push on. The Devils were up by one for most of the contest, but Hendrickson added an RBI single to keep the
Garnet in the running in the bottom of the fourth.
At the top of the seventh inning, Dickinson launched
an offensive rally resulting in seven runs for the Devils
to secure the win, and pitcher Alex Brody earned her
fourth win of the season.
"We knew we were playing a good team," outfielder
Kristin Caspar 'O9 noted. "I think that we let them get
into our heads. We got really pumped for the Ursinus
game, and we are trying to maintain a positive attitude
[even after the losses]."
Things were not much easier for the Garnet on
Tuesday. The women were swept by defending conference champion Ursinus in doubleheader action.
The Bears went up 1-0 in the third inning after a sacrifice RBI from their catcher. However, the Garnet
gained a two run lead after a three-run home run from
Krista Scheier 'll with two outs in the top of the sixth.
In the seventh inning, Ursinus gained two runs from a
fielding error and would seal the win with an RBI single.
In the second game, the women were simply shut
down. Ursinus's pitcher had a three-hit win, with 11
strikeouts.

18

In the fourth inning, Ursinus put two more on the
board with an RBI double. A pinch runner would later
score on a sacrifice bunt. In the sixth, an RBI single
for the Bears drove in another run.
Caspar also described the importance of mental
fortitude. "At this in the season, we need to focus
more on mental toughness. We definitely have the
skill to succeed, we just need to work on being focused
and mentally prepared for the rest of the season," she
said.
The Garnet will travel to Gettysburg this Saturday
to face the Bullets in a doubleheader at 3 p.m.

SCORES FROM THE CONFERENCE
TUESDAY, MARCH 31

Championship.
Additionally, Wallwork was one of 32 players
nationally to be invited to compete in the 2008 NCAA
Division 111 singles tournament.
In the meantime, consistency is key if the Garnet
wants to return to the conference championship
match. "There's a lot of ups and downs in a match, and
if we can limit the valleys when we lose focus, that's
the biggest thing," Loomis said. "Dealing with adversity and dealing with pressure."
He added that the team has been working on this
aspect of the game in practice, but match situations
deliver the best practice.
The Garnet faced a worthy opponent in Muhlenberg
at home on Tuesday. The Mules beat Swarthmore 6-3
on the strength of depth behind the top players.
Swarthmore scored victories from Wallwork at No. 1
singles and from Park at No. 2 singles. The pair also
won at No. 1 doubles, but the three top-level victories
were not enough to overcome Muhlenberg's victories
in the minor matches.
The Mules improved to 3-3 with the win and rose to
match Swarthmore at a record of 2-1 in the conference.
On Saturday, Swarthmore will face a non-confer-

ence opponent for the last time this season when it

hosts the University of Mary Washington. The Eagles
currently hold the #9 ranking in the country, but the
Garnet will look to put together a team effort and find

success against a nationally ranked opponent. The
matches will begin at 9:30 a.m.

games left
in the regular season, the race for playoff positions and jockeying for home ice
has reached its peak.
The brackets are coming out; teams
are resting their starters and already
lying about the extent of players'
injuries to avoid looking weak.
Along with these precious playoff

essentials come the memories of the
San Jose Sharks' past playoff records, a
thought I would as soon forget.
The Sharks have been a dominant
team in the West for years and have
won the Pacific Division title on several occasions, including this year.
Yet, much to their fans' dismay, they
have never reached the Stanley Cup
finals.
In fact, in the history of the franchise, they have only made, it to the
Western Conference Finals once.
In the past two years, even when
many had the Sharks picked to win it
all, the team has embarrassingly exited
the postseason in the second round,
perfectly described by columnist Jim
Adams as the "Stanley Cup Playoff
Fizzle."
With the critiques by so many
announcers and sports fans of the
Sharks playoff record and the dominance of the Sharks
in the regular season, one has to

McDaniel earns lopsided win in lacrosse
Women's lacrosse falls short in late
rally against Green Terror
It was too little too late for Garnet
women's lacrosse on Saturday afternoon. Swarthmore (6-2,0-2 CC) fell 1513 to conference rival McDaniel (6-3,21 CC) on Clothier Field.
After a balanced first half that left
the Garnet with a 7-6 advantage at
halftirae, the Green Terror kicked off
the second period with a 7-0 run that
left the Garnet down by a score of 13-7
with seven minutes to play.
The Garnet found a spark when
Emily Evans 11 scored her seventh
hat trick of the season by connecting
a free position penalty shot at 6:52.
After McDaniel answered the Evans
goal at 6:01, Swarthmore took off on a
5-0 run to bring the score to 14-13 in
favor of the Green Terror with just
under a minute and a half to play.
The rally ended prematurely however, as the McDaniel defense kept
the scoring frenzy at bay. The visitors added an exclamation point on
the victory with a buzzer-beater by
junior attacker Sarah Mintz that left
the contest with a final result of 15-13.
Evans went on to score four goals
on the day, as did classmate Amy
Vachal 11, whose season total of 31
goals is a team-high. Ally Grein 10

The sheer length and intensity levei

travel across multiple time zones in

an extensive psychological and physical toll on players that can negatively

Yet hockey analysts and fans still

much a competition of mental toughness as of skating ability.
This fact has not escaped the notice
of general managers and coaches, who
have had sports psychologists work
with their teams in order to prepare for
the psychological aspect of the postseason.
But what coaches still seem to rely
on most is their veteran players keeping a cool head under pressure and
helping the younger players who might

competition.

The Swarthmore men's lacrosse

team fell just short of victory this
Saturday in an exciting match against
the Muhlenberg College Mules, finishing with a score of 4-3 after two overtime periods.
However, the Garnet men put up a
valiant fight, with an inspiring comeback beginning in the third quarter to
match Muhlenberg's 3-0 lead.
The victory was Muhlenberg's first
of the season after having played six
ranked teams already this season. The
Mules improved to 1-6 (1-3 CC). with
the win.
In the first half, Swarthmore outshot Muhlenberg 12-10. However, the
Swarthmore offense could not find the
back of the net, while three different
Muhlenberg attackers scored three
unassisted goals.
"Our defense was playing great, so
we knew it was just a matter of time
before the offense began to click,"
Anthony Phalen 10 said of the first
half.
He proved to be right, receiving an
assist from classmate Tyler Bradshaw
'lO in the third quarter and securing a
spot for his team on the scoreboard.

After a scoreless first overtime period, the second overtime began unfavorably for Swarthmore when Muhlenberg

Despite the comeback and building

momentum from the home team, a
Muhlenberg midfielder managed to
score another unassisted goal in the
second overtime period, ending the
game. It seems to be one of those situations in which the final score does not
truly reflect the solid play and effort put
in by the players.
"Overall, our entire defense played

with six saves and four ground balls.

Swarthmore stats in ground balls,
scooping up five.

Looking ahead, the team has to
brush this game off and come ready
to play for every conference game. In
Phalen's words, "the team goal for
the rest of the season is to try and
win every [remaining] conference
game, so that we can have a shot at
making the Centennial Conference

playoffs."
Right now, Swarthmore has a 2-2
record in the Centennial Conference
and overall record of 3-4.
Hungry for another Centennial

men will take on the McDaniel
