Keith Named Finalist in Search for New Haverford President
By

Arun Mohan

Swarthmore College Provost Jennie Keith
is one of four possible candidates for the
presidency of Haverford College.
"I spent two and a half days being interviewed there at the beginning of the week.
Their Board of Managers expects to reach a
decision in mid to late November and if they
offer me the position I expect to accept it,"

Keith said.
As provost, Keith is the chief academic
officer of the College, in charge of the philosophy and practice of the school's academic program.Keith serves on several committees including the Council on Educational
Policy (CEP), which she chairs; the Committee on Faculty Procedures; the Curriculum
Committee, which she also chairs; College
Planning Committee; and the Promotion and
Tenure Committee.
The CEP recently released a preliminary
draft of an academic planning study which
Keith oversaw. Although tentative, the study
called for, among other things, the elimina-

tion of primary distribution courses and the
evaluation of faculty members who have obtained tenure.
Keith's departure could cause a problem
for the College, especially because of her
work on the CEP and the planning study in
which it is now engaged. However, said Associate Provost Barry Schwartz said, "Because ofhow Jennie does things, members of
committees are sufficiently involved in things
that they shouldbe able to carry on their work
without major disruption...There's never a
good time for a central person to leave an
institution, and because I think Jennie has the
confidence and respect of the faculty, we
would be quite sorry to see her go. But.. .the
planning process has been the work of CEP
with Jennie as leader, not of Jennie alone.
CEP should be able to continue that work
effectively."
According to a memo sent to the Haverford
college community from John Hurford of the
Haverford Board of Managers, there were
222 nominationsand candidatesfor the presidential search.

There are now four finalists who are to
have visited Haverford's campus by early
November. The other three candidates for the
Haverford presidency are Robert L. Jaffe, a
professor of physics at the Massachusetts
Institute ofTechnology; Thomas Tritton, the
vice provost at the University of Vermont;
and Patricia Schroeder, the Congresswoman
for the Ist District of Colorado.
Haverford College's Board of Managers
will make the final decision after hearing a
recommendation from a search committee
composed of various persons from Haverford
College, including six members of the Board.
The decision will be a complex one, involving a number of factors. Mat Kendall,
one of the two students at Haverford on the
Presidential Search Committee, said that,
"The President should be able to bring us into
the 20th century." In addition, Mat stated that
the new President would have to deal with
"financial problems especially the question
of financial aid as the cost of college increases," oversee the day-to-day operations
of the college, and be able to serve as a

"capital agent," as Haverford College is beginning the process of building a new science
building, for which it will need to raise $26
million dollars.
Keith has worked at Swarthmore for 25
years, working as a member of the faculty
before being appointed provost of the college.
Said Professor Donald Swearer, a member
ofthe Committee on Faculty Procedures, "As
provost, Jennie works very effectively with
faculty committees and her leadership in this
area has been important to the college."
Currently, Robert Gavin Jr. is the interim
president of Haverford. Gavin, who assumed
the presidency on July 1, will relinquish his
position on June 30, 1997. Gavin is temporarily replacing Tom Kessinger, who left to
be General manager of Aga Khan Trust for
Culture in Geneva, Switzerland. In his new
position Kessinger oversees projects concerned with the "built environment" in the
Muslim world from Mindanao to Morocco,
Aga Khan University in Pakistan, and Aga
Khan Research Facility in London.

Local Man Dies on Train Tracks
By

Toki Rehder

|

A SEPTA commuter train struck and killed
a man on campus October 11. The incident
occurred just west of the Fieldhouse Lane
bridge over the tracks. This bridge is located
between Dana and Ware Pool.
Police Officer William Thomas found the
victim lying on the side of the track bed,
fatally injured with severe trauma to the head,
reported The Swarthmorean on October 18.
The victim, 36-year-old Anthony S. Moore,
was pronounced dead by the Delaware County
Medical Examiner's Office at about 3:15
p.m. according to The Philadelphia Inquirer
on October 12.
As the engineer rounded the curve heading
into Swarthmore, she observed the man and
"laid on the horn." She also applied the emer-

gency brakes, but there was not enough disfor the train to stop, according to The
Swarthmorean. SEPTA officials have not yet
released the analysis of the "black box,"
which records the details of the accident. The
train was heading eastbound into Philadelphia on the R3 Media/Elwyn line. The incident, which occurred around 1:18 p.m.,
stopped SEPTA service on this line until
about 3:30 p.m. that afternoon, reported The
Inquirer.
Moore was unmarried and lived with his
parents, reported The Swarthmorean. He was
walking towards Swarthmore from
Wallingford on the westbound tracks when
he was struck from behind. According to
Barbara Siegel, spokesperson for SEPTA,
the eastbound train was using the westbound
tracks because routine maintenance crews
were cutting back bush near the opposite
track. She was unsure of the location of the
crew at the time of the incident.
According to Siegel, the trains run in both
directions on the same railroad tracks and the
track is exclusively for trains, reported The
tance

Election ’96

Delaware County Daily Times on October
13. "This is extremely tragic," she said, "And
this is why SEPTA repeatedly appeals to the
public not to cross tracks. Tracks can only be
crossed where there's a permissible underpass or overpass."
SEPTA policy required a drug and alcohol
test of the engineer. According to Thomas,
the tests were negative. The victimalso tested
negative for both drugs and alcohol.
The tracks are often used by town and
campus residents as a shortcut between
Swarthmore and Nether Providence, according to The Daily Times. A meeting had been
held in the past with SEPTA regarding people
trespassing on the tracks, but Police Chief
Donald Lee said the problem is difficult to
solve without installing fences along thewhole
area. "We do the best we can and people keep
on making the same mistakes over and over,"
Lee told The Daily Times.
At the Swarthmore borough council meeting on October 14, Swarthmore Mayor Guy
Smith said he will contact the College and
SEPTA personnel about improving safety,
reported The Daily Times on October 20.

Lecturer Looks at Congressional Races
By Sylvia

Weedman

Last night, Charles O. Jones of the University of Wisconsin at
Madison gave the annual Charles Gilbert lecture on "President
Clinton and the Separated System."
Jones spoke at length on the divisionofboth power and accountability between the president and Congress. A renowned political
scientist and scholar of the presidency, Jones emphasized that
within such a system of separation, a political party which is
capable of winning both Congress and the presidency in a popular
"mandate" can, in theory, provide much needed accountability in
government. However, recently, parties haven't.
Criticizing both President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich, Jones
noted that "100-day miracles in our government are mirages."
After their respective self-proclaimed "mandates," Clinton in
1992 and Gingrich in 1994 misread their elections and promised
much more than they could possibly achieve. Because congressmen, senators and presidents face different election cycles, a
president, much like a Speaker of the House, "must negotiate from
the first day of even a mandated presidency, which is rare." They
must both devise "separation strategies" by building enduring
cross-party coalitions in order to achieve their ends, even if they do
have significant majorities.
His theme was timely. The presidential election is now a
foregone conclusion, so the talking heads of Washington have

turned their attention to the congressional races, predicting which
party will control the House, and how Clinton will deal with it.
According to a recent article in The New York Times, Clinton is
not lending much support to Democratic candidates as he tours the
country; he may actually, as Jones pointed out, expect that a
Democratic Congress would be "more problematic" for him than
a Republican one. Seemingly further to the left than Clinton,
ranking members ofCongress could conceivably make the passage
of his key reforms more difficult.
Though Clinton surely does not want a Republican Congress, he
may not fear it all that much. If the Republicans retain the House,
Jones predicted that the 105th Congress could tackle major issues
like Medicare and Medicaid in a bipartisan manner because "Republicans have come to understand that Clinton is not going away."
Looking toward 1998, Republicans may try to work with Clinton
because they realize that he has a genuine, and marketable, connection with the public.
According to Jones, both Clinton and Gingrich have shirked
their accountability so far—both sidestried to blame each other for
the budget impasse last year, and neither side wants to be seen as
'the government' when critics refer to "big government." Before
they can get to the issues, Jones suggested, they (and we) need to
recognize that the president is not the government, and that
Congress is not the government. Neither can claim to govern alone
for long.

Those students who left campus for Fall
break on October 10 were able to choose, to
some degree, where they would go and how
long they would stay there. Cars illegally
parked on campus weren't quite as fortunate.
On that day, the Department ofPublic Safety
began towing cars parked without permits or
parked illegally for the third time by students
with permits.
A total of eleven cars have been toWed
from parking spaces throughout campus.
Towed vehicles were brought to Lyons Towing in Chester/The towing place is about
twenty-five minutes down theroad in Chester
and it is really inconvenient," said Naveen
Nirgudkar '99, whose car was towed on October 8.
Nirgudkar had to pay $l5O to retrieve his
car. He was charged $75 for the towing.
Nirgudkar, who was taking finals on the final
days before October break, was also charged
a $25 car storage fee for each of the two days
that passed before he realized that his car had
been towed.
"I was most upset that there was no ticket
issued first," Nirgudkar said. According to
Nirgudkar, a ticket would have been less
expensive, more convenient, and would have
served as a warning.
Leon Francis, assistant director of Public
Safety, said that students have already been
warned about the dangers of parking illegally
on campus. "When a student is denied a
parking permit, they receive a letter stating
that their request has been denied, and also
that they should move their vehicle off campus immediately," said Francis. He pointed
out that the letter states that illegally parked
cars will be "subject to ticketing and/or towing WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE." Students received this notice by September 20,
twenty days before the towing began.
Students with permits receive various warnings before their permits are revoked and
they become susceptible to the tow trucks.
When a student obtains two traffic citations,
a letter is sent to that student stating that the
student has "received two unappealed or unsuccessfully-appealed traffic citations" and
thatacquiring one more will lead to the parking permit being rescinded.
There are two other forms of warning issued before cars are susceptible to ticketing
or towing. The first is a seven-day notice.
This is issued when a certain pattern of illegal

parking persists, such as a car parked illegally
three times a week. The notice requests the
owner to confirm whether they are a visitor to
the campus. If so, the charges are forgotten.
The letter stresses that "All students, faculty
and staff must have a current permit to park,"
and that if no response is forthcoming within
a week, the next time the car is illegally
parked, it will be towed at the owner's expense.
The other warning issued is a 24-hour notice, often given to students who "try to buck
the system," said Francis. These students do
not apply for a permit, and therefore do not
receive the first notice notifying them that
their cars are susceptible to towing. The subsequent warning gives them 24 hours to get
the car off campus, or else it will be towed.
Yet, this parking policy has not been applied consistently in particular situations or
overtime.Many cars that were illegally parked
on October 10 were not ticketed according to
Nirgudkar. "Other people parking illegally
on campus [when he was] were not towed. It
should be all or nothing," said Nirgudkar.
Cars parked illegally since October 10 have
not been towed either.
Students are not the only ones with problems: the staff has complained about the lack
of parking as well. Construction workers
have been parking in the wrong places, leading to fewer available parking spaces and
greater confusion.
Requests for parking permits are allowed
year-round. So far, 175 students have applied
for parking permits; of these, 110 were approved, 25 for students living off campus.
When the student-run authorization committeedecides which students should receive
parking permits, they consider students with
special needs first, such as medical reasons,
disabilities, or an off-campus residence.
After that, the primary factor is the
applicant's class. Much like the room lottery
in May, seniors are given first priority, followed by juniors. Sophomores and freshmen
rarely are awarded permits.
Students start with a clean slate every year:
even those withbad records the previous year
are not discriminated against. "One student's
car was towed seven times last year," said
Francis. "But everyone starts with a clean
slate every year."
Various empty spots remain on campus,
and students argue that more permits should
be issued because of the fact. "Students point
out that there are always empty spaces, but
they are there for areason," said Francis. "We
need them for visitors and for other people
who come to Swarthmore. We need some
empty spaces, and can't have every one occupied. We try to accommodate all those students who bring their cars to school."

Mary Lyon Shuttle Struck on Chester Road
On Thursday, October 11, the Mary Lyon Shuttle was involved in
an accident. The Shuttle was attempting a left turn onto College
Avenue from Chester Road (Route 320) when it was struck by a
southbound vehicle. The van suffered significant damage, while the
car was totaled. The van was making a turn on a yellow light, when
the driver of the southbound car, trying to make the light, broadsided
it. Nick Gisonda ’97 was treated and released from Crozer-Chester
Medical Center. The other two passengers and the drivers were
unharmed. A Student Council van has temporarily replaced the
Shuttle, which is undergoing repairs.

Survey Reveals Students’ Sexual Habits
To find out how much students know about HIV, the Swarthmore
Civil Liberties Society’s HIV/AIDS task force conducted a survey
during lunch at Sharpies and Tarble on September
The purpose
of the survey was to gather information on “student practices on
campus” and then to publish to inform the students of the results. 549
people responded to the survey, answering six questions about the
nature of their sexual activity.

31.

Many of the questions dealt with behaviors that were risk factors
for contracting HIV. 26.4 percent of the respondents said that they
have had vaginal or anal sex without a condom. 17.9 percent of
respondents said they had been tested for HIV. No one responded that
they had ever shared a needle during intravenous drug use. Of those
who answered that they had had unprotected intercourse, 16.8
percent had not been tested for HIV.
The survey also asked about HIV awareness at Swarthmore. 64.3
percent of respondents knew that Swarthmore offers HIV testing,
though only 6.2 percent answered that they had been tested here. 90.2
percent of students said they were comfortable with their knowledge
of HIV and AIDS.
“We did not expect to see as much of a connection between those
who were not tested [for HIV] and engaged in unprotected sex,” said
Amy Albert ’98, co-chair of the task force. “We initially did the
survey because we were concerned about availability of testing
services on campus and how few people were tested.”

Students Voice Concerns to CEP
The Council on Educational Policy (CEP) held a meeting Thursday, October 10 to give students a chance to respond to the first draft

of a CEP planning report which was distributed in an October 4
Phoenix supplement. About twenty students showed up with questions and concerns about how curriculum would reflect students’
changing desires. There was also discussion of student workload and
ways to determine the threshold of work at which students can still
maintain quality.

Essie Mae’s Enforces/Revokes 8:00 Deadline
After Fall break, Essie Mae’s instituted a new policy ofrigorously
enforcing their 8;00 p.m. deadline for dinner credit, refusing to allow
students to drop their meal cards off before 8:00 and then wait in line.

After four days, student outcry caused Essie Mae’s to return to their
previous policy of allowing every student who has run their card
through by 8:00 to receive the $3.75 early dinner credit from their
meal plan.
The new policy caused long lines at Essie Mae’s, as well as several
upset students, who ordered food under the assumption they’d be
given full credit, only to find their credit reduced. “Even if we got in
line well before 8:00 p.m., we were not guaranteed full credit,” said
Chris DiLeo ’99. “lam glad they decided to change back to the old
system.”

of Color Wall unveiled quietly.

With all the construction and mayhem on campus, the College
community missed the unveiling of a new, beautiful, and rather permanent piece of Swarthmore College. It isn’t a plant, either.
Yesterday, Syd Carpenter, assistant professor of studio arts, presented the Women of Color Self-Portrait Wall to a small gathering.
Recently mounted in theLang Performing Arts Center adjacent to the
List Art Gallery, the wall represents the creative work of over forty
students, staff, and faculty members. The wall consists of the visual
self-presentations of women of color realized in ceramic tiles.
The tiles are like patchwork quilt pieces bound together by lattice
twists, rosettes, and hands. Many of the women of color not only shared
and recorded their thoughts and feelings of self in the clay, but also lent
Professor Carpenter their hands, feet, and faces for ceramic castings.
Each hand is distinct, separate, and highly individualistic—a wedding
band, arthritic finger joints, and delicately shaped finger nails all lend
their personality to the wall.
The tiles themselves must also be examined. They are almost deceptively simple, but each one represents values, family, and experience:
a story of a life. Some tiles are truly symbolic, just shapes and form.
Others silently state their message, such as the Asian face being peeled
away to reveal a Caucasian center.
With such a phenomenal testimony and affirmation to diversity on
campus, it is a shame that more people did not know of the project and
of its unveiling yesterday. The completion of the wall took over two
semesters. Professor Carpenter eloquently, professionally, and beautifully gave her time and talents for the College’s benefit.
Yet why was the unveiling not publicized to the College at large?
While there is a plaque explaining the basic idea behind the wall, this
seems a rather silent way of conveying what is now such an articulate
expression for women of color in the College community.
The wall now stands clearly in view ofall thosewho pass, but it seems
odd that such an amazing and powerful statement was not made more
clearly. How many people will pass the wall without recognizing its
true meaning?
We would like to thank Professor Carpenter and everyone else who
contributed such integral parts of themselves to the self-portraits and
encourage students to look at them not only as the beautiful creations
of artwork that they are, but also as the voice for typically unspoken
histories. Please study the wall; if not, like some ofthe artists, the stories
will remain unknown.

A plea for safety.
We’ve heard stories about shuttle drivers skipping stop signs and
driving at ludicrous speeds. Whether or not these stories are true, in light
of the recent crash of a van to ML, we’d prefer to see drivers a little
better trained.
Students are currently trained for about 15 minutes. They drive their
route, and practice pulling into a parking space. That’s it. With the new
minivan running at night, the College needed more drivers than initially
applied for the job this year. Since it didn’t have much choice in
selecting experienced drivers, the College should take the time to make
sure the drivers it does have are used to driving the van before they start
their shifts. More precautions can never hurt. Accidents can.

Clarifications on SC Appointments.
Due to editorial oversight, the article entitled “Appointment Procedure Questioned” on page 1 of the October 4 issue of The Phoenix did
not convey a balanced portrayal of Student Council’s actions in appointing students to College committees.
The article did not identify those who had raised concerns about the
application process, which made it appear to present the allegations as
bald fact. There was no mention that Giridhar Srinivasan ’98 had been
contacted and that he decided to have the Appointments Committee
statement issued by Andrew Lund speak on his behalf.
There was also no clear sense of the larger context of the appointment
process. For example, another student was also recruited after the
deadline to apply for a position. There was no independent investigation to determine whetherStudentCouncil had extended the application
without explicit advertising in the past, or whether this practice constituted a violation of Student Council’s rules—which it does not. Although there were some references to the ratio of the gender of
applicants to various College committees, there was no clear, comprehensive summary of these statistics for all of the available positions.
The intent of this article was to inform our readers, not to slander the
reputations of any individual or group. Unfortunately, these omissions
and misrepresentations caused us to fall short of meeting the journalistic standards we would like to uphold.

the "snob factor." People will pay a
higher price for something just
becausethose with lower incomes
can't afford it. Yet the consumer
doesn't pay for quality in the product,
or even for its production costs. She
pays for more luxury goods for the
CEOs.
But it is not only Guess that uses
exploited labor. Clothing manufacturers and retailers as well as large
department stores frequently contract
out to the thousands of sweatshops in
big cities across the country, and
sweatshop labor is standard practice
in underdeveloped countries. Many
outcries against unfair labor practices have recently been voiced by
caring consumers and public figures.
When it was exposed a year ago that
the Gap Inc. was contracting a shop
in El Salvador that employed children and paid unconscionably low
wages, consumers and activists protested. Soon, the Gap responded and
improved its production plant conditions. Media coverage ofKathie Lee
Gifford's tirade against the use of
sweatshops to produce her Wal-Mart
clothing line has helped to raise public awareness as well. Secretary of
Labor Robert Reich has launched a
campaign to holdretailers and manufacturers responsible for their production conditions, and he has initiated congressional hearings on sweatshops. In the future, responsible consumers may be able to look for a "No
Sweat" clothing label that guarantees
non-sweatshop garments.
The Guess factory workers are also
fighting back against their employer
with a recently-filed class action suit
against Guess and 16 of its contracting shops. They are claiming systematic violations of basic labor laws, as
well as a violation of a compliance
agreement Guess made with the
Department ofLabor in 1995 when it
had prior problems with unfair labor
practices. Many supporters and workers have been holding protests and
picket-lines outside of Guess boutiques to inform consumers of Guess's
practices and to persuade them to
boycott Guess products.
The Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Workers,
UNITE!, has launched a counter-advertising campaign against Guess
using posters that parody the
company's sleazy advertising aesthetic. The black, white and red posters state, "Nobody Should Be a Slave
To Fashion", playing on the double
meaning of the words. One poster
depicts a sweatshop worker at a sewing machine, the other portrays a
young couple on the beach, an image
of resistance to Guess's manipulative and degrading advertising tactics. Look for these in coffee shops,
restaurants, and shopping centers.
And as always, the consumer plays
a major role in compelling Guess to
clean up its ads and its workplace.

Letters to the Editor
Student Council Member Challenges Portrayal
of His Participation in Appointment Process
To the Editor,
I am writing in response to your
article on October 4,1996 whichquestioned the procedures of the Appointments Committee of Student Council. I was quite shocked to find that
your article seemed to pQint at a lack
of personal integrity on my part as a
member of the Appointments Com-

mittee.
I first wantto set the record straight
and clearly explain the events which
have led to widespread rumor-mongering, name calling and image tarnishing. Last semester, Douglas
Berger '9B had expressed an interest
to me in becoming a more active
participant in the College's decision
making process. At the time, I encouraged him to seek a position on
the CPC, which was actively involved
in the College's long term planning
process. In fact, we on Student Council had resolved to go and try to reach
out to students who might be interested in such positions, and ask them
to apply, because we were worried
about a lack of participation on these
committees.
This semester, around September
18 or 19,1 happened to see Doug in
the Parrish corridor and casually
asked him if he was still interested in
applying. He said thathe was, but had
said that he.had forgotten all about it.
So I told him that even though the
deadline had officially ended a couple
of days before, he could still ask
Andrew Lund (SC Appointments
Chair) if it was still okay to apply.
Andrew in fact did accept Doug's
application, and I in no way pressured him to make any decisions about

it.
Subsequently, the Appointments
Committee also accepted another
person's application for the CPC.
(This applicant happened to be a
woman, and I find it interesting that
you neglected to mention this, despite the fact that Andrew Lunds'
memo to you did clearly state this).
The next weekend during the interviews, I absented myself from Doug's
interview (just to avoid any conflict
of interest) and when Doug's name
later came up for discussion, I did not
participate in the discussion. I thought
that this was in keeping with the
ethics required to be as unbiased as
possible when making decisions on
such an important committee.
Although you did not make any
direct allegations, you seemed to hint
at my being biased and favoring
Doug's application. I fail to understand what was unethical or scandalous about my practices. As anyone
can clearly see, I took all the steps
that I could possibly take to avoid any
dubious or questionable situations.
What I further I do not understand is
why even though you had all this
information, you still decided to publish your article on the front page.

I can only think two reasons why
you went ahead and published it —1.
Poor journalistic standards and ethics. 2. You sought to ruin my credibility in the eyes of the community.
Several of my friends have thought
that it was the former, and I wish I
could believe that that is the only
reason, but given that I know all of
you to be extremely intelligentpeople,
I am increasingly being left with no
option but to believe that it was the
latter.
Whatever your intentions were,
you have succeeded in casting a
shadow of doubt over my integrity in
the eyes of this community. People
whom I know-administrators, deans,
professors and most shockingly, some
ofmy friends, have actually given me
strange looks over the past couple of
days and have asked me what happened, or what I "did". I can only say
time and time again, I did not "do"
anything wrong. To say the least, it
has all been very saddening.
The only saving grace has been
that most of them have been very
sympathetic. Members of Student
Council and members of the Appointments Committee who have known
the truth all along, have tried to reassure me by telling me that they know
the truth, and that is what is most
important. However, nothing I say,
do or write is going to remove from
the minds of the other members of
this community for whom I have so
much care and respect, the thought
that I have beenaccused of nepotism.
Anyone who knows me well,
knows that I am extremely committed to Student Council, and that I put
it ahead of everything else in my lifeoften even ahead of academics. I am
pained to see that The Phoenix would
rather try to dig up some "dirt" on
Student Council members, often blatantly disregarding the truth, rather
than to try to report any of our other
achievements.
I also regret your inability to fathom
the near monopolistic power that you
have over information on this campus. You have egregiously misused
this power, sadly at my expense. But
what has pained me the most about
all of this is that I have realized that
this is how you express gratitude for
my service, and our service to the
student body.
I must add that I was initially overcome by waves of anger and frustration, but was later plagued by the
quesfion "Why?...l know that I behaved in a very ethical, professional
and responsible manner. So why are
they trying to tarnish my name?"
To all the editors-in-chief, publisher, news editors, reporters and
staff of The Phoenix, I say, "Thank
you, and well done. You have succeeded in spoiling someone's reputation."

Opinions

A First-Year
Homecoming
By Katalyn

Vidal

I had to admit to myself, when the bus
pulled into the Port Authority Bus Terminal
in lower Manhattan, that I had somewhat
missed the exciting city terrain. Yes, New
York City again lay before me like some
incredible buffet; all its unique elements in
abundance. I had left the small, family-like
environment ofSwat to return to the jungle of
stampeding business suits, waif-like models,
and some incredibly quick-working squeegee men. Was I really prepared to face up to
the maddening pace I had tried so hard to
avoid by attending semi-rural school? Of
course I could; it was just a matter of adjustment. Ten days at home! The things I could
do, the people I could see... my sense of
optimism grew as I planned my itinerary .
God, did I miss my mother's cooking! I was
almost salivating as I unlocked the front door
to my house. What had changed? Would I
look different? Did they miss me? Well, after
saying things I guess most parents would say:
"Are they feeding you down there?" and
"How's the roommate?," I got the impression
that my parents had indeed missed me. For
the first time, I noticed that our refrigerator
was full. Did I really eat that much when I was
living at home?
I happily volunteered information on the
"college experience" as my parents and I
bonded by shopping for winter clothing. My
church youth group welcomed me back and I
was glad to feel their warmth. An Indian
Summer had arrived, and the pleasant attitude of New Yorkers when the weather is
nice is an experience not to be missed. I had
Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village, and my
home borough of Queens again. I should
have been happy, right?
I began Fall Break feeling that going home
was a vacation of sorts and ended it yearning
for the place where I was forced to do homework and term papers to survive. After living
with other people and bonding with my hall,
I felt lonely very quickly (I am an only child).
Fortunately, three of my best friends go to
school in Manhattan and took time away
from their studies (I pity those who have no
pass/fail) to catch up on lost time.
My friends from my old high school
seemed to have blossomed into seniors overnight and looked quite different but they had
really missed me; it is nice to be hugged the
instant one walks through the doors of a
familiar place.
My best night was spent at the NYU dorm
room ofmy best friend of 11 years. Just being
around someone with whom I had shared so
much of my life adventures and experiences
was enough to ease some of my loneliness.
We laughed and danced the night away as we
looked at ourselves in a whole new light; we
were college women now. What a reality
check that was for me!
From her balcony overlooking Union
Square I realized what a long and challenging
future I had ahead of me. I was at an incredible school filled with brilliant and fun-loving people, with more than three years to take
advantage of what it had to offer and family
and friends at home who loved me too much
to forget me.
By the end of the week, I was refreshed and
ready to leave that cosmopolitan grind I call
my permanent residence and return to Swarthmore. There I had the chance to open my
door to the future I had briefly glimpsed
while gazing from my friend's large balcony.

Letters to the Editor
Give the WRC the Respect It Deserves
To the Editor,
Before the official restructuring of the
Women's Resource Center in 1993, the
Women's Center, as it was then called, was
predominantly used for social purposes by a
very limited, and exclusive, group of
Swarthmore's women. As the goals and priorities of the WRC have changed, and the
new Board ofDirectors look to create an even
more active role for the center, the question of
whether or not to make the WRC an official
part of thecampus becomes even more heated.
The general management of the WRC,
with its present status as an unrecognized part
of the campus, is facilitated by a Board of
Directors consisting ofnine students, elected
by the women of Swarthmore—three ofwhom
function as paid 'coordinators'—andadvised
by a very part-time faculty member.
Disadvantages associated with not being a
recognized part of the College community
include limited financial resources,
deprioritization of the care of the space by
Public Safety and Environmental Services
and limited faculty advising. The issue of
finances greatly influences the kinds of
projects and events the Women's Resource
Center can sponsor. Since it is not a part of
Swarthmore's campus, and therefore does
not receive a generous allocation of funds,
the WRC cannot improve upon its resources
nor can it fully take advantage of the ones it
has. This means that the board cannot invite
speakers to the college, nor can it organize
events such as open mikes, coffee houses or
movie nights without the assistance of SAC
funds. In addition, without campus support
the space must be constantly supervised,
thereby relying upon the members of the
board and numerous volunteers to "housesit"
on weeknights from 7-12p.m.. The limited

Fred writes that "Swarthmore's chief attraction is its natural beauty. People come

how he arrived at Swarthmore, "walked down

on Parrish Beach, sat in the Amphitheater,
smelled the flowers blooming, and fell in

To the Editor,
In answer to Brian Schwartz's conjecture
that "Taxation Is Simply Legal
Pickpocketing," published in last week's issue of The Phoenix, I must confess that I
disagree with portions of the arguments he
makes. I believe that Mr. Schwartz's premises can be summarized as "Protection of
private property is a proper function of government" and "Taxation is illegitimate due to
the threat of force that underlies it." Few
would disagree with the first (and I among the
many in that case), but I will address the
second.
Due to the unusual nature of these premises
(not often must we question what most of us
accept as a given), I suspect much of this
article may be my own obfuscated political
theory, but I entertain the vague hope that it
will culminate in a flash of lucidity in the
minds of all who read this. I postulate that the
government exists solely as institutionalized
force.
Regardless of what a society values, the
formation of government provides a legitimate backing for some or all of those values.
It is not important for this argument to know
whether a society values taxation, or no taxation; military protection, or no military protection; or education for its children, or no
education for its children.
Independent of what a society places value
on, a society chooses to achieve those values
by enforcing them with the power of the
government. The government is nothing more
than as much force as the society can muster
in the direction of its values.
As a practical example, this means the
modern United States places value on a drugfree lifestyle. In defense of this value, the
government implements the threat of force

Manufacture Magill Walk

walk, Adirondack chairs, Parrish Beach, the
Amphitheater, and the blooming flowers have
in common? None of them are "natural."
They are all the product of human effort. At
one time, there were construction crews building Magill walk and the Amphitheater. The
trees lining the walk did not conveniently
grow along the sides of Magill walk, and
those people at Scott Arboretum put much
effort into their flower gardens. The beauty
Fred speaks of would not exist without human action.
All of the above, like Trotter, will at one
time or another need renovation. Should we
complain that values not only need be created, but also sustained? By the nature of
reality, we can not have the results ofhuman
effort without the process. We can not expect

to live by exerting effort once and surviving
on inertia. As Ayn Rand wrote, life is a

process of self-sustaining and self-generated
action. I more than agree with Joe Tucker,
that the process ofconstruction is beautiful. I
love watching it—because it represents the
humans, by their nature, must live: by changing their environment to suit their needs and
desires. If it is repulsive that work must be put
into Trotter to use it, then what of the notion
that work must be put one's own life in order
to live? Gosh, what a horrid concept—that
we are responsible for our own lives! People
who reject this fact believe that we have
rights to the product of other people's efforts:
that "society" owes us what we need to live,
that we are our brother's keeper.

had absorbed more of her policies, he may
have had more scope to win.
Mainstream America holds the votes required to win the presidential and congressional elections. Along with General Colin
Powell, Mrs. Whitman is one of the most
mainstream Republicans, giving her broad
appeal. With her conservative fiscal policies,
she has promoted liberal social policies. She
is pro-choice, opposes voluntary prayer in
public schools, and is a self-proclaimed environmentalist. Many of these stances, though,
are at odds with the heart of the
Republican platform. She, however, is a great strength to the GOP
because she portrays that one can
be a moderate and still be a Republican.
Governor Whitman understands
that a majority of Americans do
support abortion rights and even a
majority of Republicans are prochoice. Hence, she is especially
opposed to the pro-life Republican
policy. During the convention in
San Diego, she wanted to have the
anti-abortion clauseremoved from
the platform in order to capture
some of the traditionally Demo-

cratic female vote.
Bob Dole, we can see by his firm pro-life
stance, has a weakness among female voters.
On the one hand, we can see that by disregarding the pro-life platform of the GOP he
might have gained votes from the middle, on
the other hand, he would have risked alienating a large constituency such as the Christian
Coalition. Governor Whitman would not
agree with me. She would say that Dolecould
have removed abortion from the platform to
assert that the GOP encompasses many different views.
Putting aside abortion, Roger Stone, now a
campaign advisor to Dole, said in 1994 that
the Senator needed to represent the Republican party as compassionate and caring toward the average citizen in order to win the
1996 election. Again, by being more like
ChristineTodd Whitman, SenatorDole would
have appeared more attractive to the voter
because his social policies would not have
been so rigid. He, along with most of the
Republican party, has not realized that
America is mainstream. Voluntary prayer in
schools and pro-life propaganda are not what
Americans want to hear. Repeatedly, we run
into the same conclusion that the GOP has to
make itself more appealing by showing that it

(i.e. jail terms and fines).
The same is true oftaxation: don't pay your
taxes and you go to jail (or move to Montana,
but that's another issue) .The government may
target any end, but force is always its means.
While the end varies, the mechanism, force or
the threat of force, does not.
And thus I disagree with Mr. Schwartz's
argument, that taxation is illegitimate because it is backed by the threat of force. If
that argument is maintained, all government
functions are illegitimate. The nature of government is'that its functions are backed by

force.
Without the threat of force, there is nothing
to inhibitthe absolute free will of a constitu-

ency, and thus no government. The argument
incorrectly criticizes the government program based on its means (force) rather than
its ends (taxation). Taxation may be illegitimate for many reasons, but the threat offorce
supporting it is not one of those reasons.
At this point you may be considering the
obvious lack of morality in my stance. I will
not specify what principles form the bounds
of legitimate government force; I leave that
to others, as I think it will be a difficult and
lengthy task. I am, however, essentially arguing that you can never criticize a government
solely for using force.
But the ethical void is not quite so empty as
it appears. There is still room for morality in
the aims: taxation, war, drug use, abortion,
gay marriage, free speech, or whatever else
the government defends or offends through
its use of force. You can criticize a government for using force towards the wrong ends
in which case you are actually criticizing
the end itself, and that brings us back to the
issue at hand.
And now for a random burst ofeditorializing: I must question the efficacy of a government without taxes. I am sure that many, if
not most, of a government's functions could
be successfully implementedby private firms.
But what of education and large-scale infrastructure?
I believe each of these necessitates a government role. And I still speak on the assumption that any government would maintain the
role of arbiter, policeman, and soldier. Would
anyone go so far as to dispense with these
functions of a government, which must be
severed if there is no taxation?
I am not trying to provide a solid justification for taxation. There may be some strong
arguments against the idea. But "illegitimate
use offorce" as an argument against taxation
is, I believe, a difficult argument to support,
lest you support the complete abolition of all
government.

budget not only requires that the volunteer
women on this campus provide, without compensation, the same service for which
desksitters in Parrish, Tarble and the Field
House are paid, but it also limits the accessibility of the space to individuals or groups.
For a campus with a steadily growing student
body and a corresponding decrease in student-allocated space, increased accessibility
of the WRC to the student body is not only
advantageous but increasingly necessary.
This increased use of the space associated
with the 'collegizing' of the WRC, however,
demands some necessary changes in its security management. This would require that
Public Safety improve the overall security of
the area as well as increase their surveillance
of the WRC. The WRC has had a number of
security issues in the past, the worst of which
include a stolen television and a loss ofbooks
from the library. At present, Public Safety
not responsible for securing the space because the unofficial status of the center does
not warrant such prioritization. This means
that broken locks go unfixed and dark pathways go unlighted, putting in jeopardy not
only the resources of the center, but the safety
of the housesitters and the women who go
there. For a space which claims to provide,
among other things, a safe environment for
Swarthmore women, the lack of security severely compromises this claim and threatens
the reputation of the Women's Resource Center as a whole.
The Women's Resource Center would be
able to make much better use ofits resources
if it were an official part of the college!

has a wider base of support. The Governor of
New Jersey has already conceptualized this.
So if she has the qualities, why didn't she
want to be Vice President? Many believe that
her lack of experience was a factor. I have a
different perspective. I think that she did not
want to be "second in line," and rather that
she has her eye on the presidency in 2000. Is
the country ready for a woman president?
If she maintains her conservative views on
economic policies and liberal outlooks on
social issues, she definitely has a chance.
According to an article in The New York
Times Magazine on May 5, friends of
Whitman say that she intends to be the savior
of the Republican party in 2000 after it has
seen its errors—primarily in being too conservative for the times. So it appears that
Christine Todd Whitman would want no other
position but to be "top dog."
If she does decide to run for president in
four years, I will be the first one to support
her. I hold many of the same political views
that she does. I am conservative when it
comes to fiscal policies. But, social policies
are a different "ball-game." I am pro-choice,
oppose voluntary prayer in public schools,
value harmonious existence between the environment and businesses, and feel that the
Republican party should be moderate withits
social policies.
At Swarthmore, I am comparatively more
on the right than most, however, in comparison to the rest of America I am very mainstream. I await the year 2000 when hopefully
the GOP will emerge victorious under a new
banner and with a progressive leader.

Class stones like these are embedded in the walls ofParrish, Worth, and Martin.
The notes for the Class of 1909 mention a
stone which was placed in "the library," which
has since been demolished. The stones then
appear with fair regularity until 1938. However, the style is noticeably different. The
stones are now polished, rectangular blocks
of granite with no carvings or ornamentation

except for the date and the inscription. The
inscriptions on this later group are split between Latin and English. These include "non
nobis, sed omnibus" (not for us, but for everyone), "Dare to be wise", and "Courage and
patience." The final two years, 1937 and
1938, have the year only, with no inscription.

A Day in the Life of...President Bloom Himself
By
"

Min Lee

r

I lhe President must be responsive to
many constituencies, including stuJL dents, parents, alumni, staff, other
leaders in higher education, as well as the
broader public." Such is the main task of Al
Bloom as described by Maurice Eldridge
'6l, associate vice president and executive
assistant to the president. If your idea of
being a President of a college is round-theclock socializing, then you are mistaken.
Those routine appearances the President
makes at College events and alumni functions only account for a token part of his
duties. "It is my obligation to make sure that
the school runs well, and that Swarthmore
remains the finest undergraduate college in
the country, and this requires staying on top
of issues that arise in every area of the
College," said Al Bloom. Fundraising is
another major responsibility. The President
must also oversee the balancing of the College budget, and ensure that arrangements in
the budget best serve the educational goals
of the school. Heading one of the top educational institutions in the nation, Bloom must
naturally also take appropriate leadership in
larger issues of U.S. education.
Bloom said, "The job requires constant
thinking about what will keep us at the leading edge: education and academics, the
strength of the community and institution,
and how to make sure that the institution acts
in terms of its educational and ethical values."
This translates into a ten-hour day, sevendays-a-week routine. Not only is the
President's schedule fully packed, but it is
also subject to constant changes.
President Bloom sits on the CPC (College
Planning Committee), CBC (College Budget Committee), COFP (Committee of Faculty Procedures), CEP (Council on Educational Policy) and CPT (Committee on Promotion and Tenure), all of which meet regularly over the course of the year. On top of
Board meetings—which occur twice each
semester on campus—the President also
meets with several committees off campus,
namely the Development Committee, the
Investment Committee, both in New York,
and the Finance and Trust Committee in

Philadelphia.
The President has standing meetings with
administrators overseeing the following aspects of the College: admissions, public relations, development, finances, academic program, student life and facilities.
Bloom's week of September 29th began
with a late-morning meeting with Harry
Gotwals, vice president overseeing alumni,
development, and public relations, and
Eldridge. They
discussed the
progress of arecent program
aimed at raising
funds for several scholarships and the
Honors Program. Towards
the end of the
meeting, they
talked about the
possibility of
meeting with the
editorial boards
of several national newspapers as part ofthe
College's ongoing efforts to further increase its

visibility.
Between 1 and
1:30 p.m., PresidentBloom met
with
Mark
Boulos '9B of
SQU to go over
details for Coming Out Week,
after which he made several calls regarding
potential faculty appointments.
In the evening, the President attended the
Pierson Lecture sponsored by the Economics
Department given by Doug Blair '7O. Afterwards he hosted a reception for Blair in the
Scheuer Room.
What about the rest of the day? To begin
with, at least once a week, the President has a
meal with a donor or a Board Member to
discuss College-related issues. "The job requires so much correspondence....there are a

lot of people to stay in contact with that very
little free time is left," Bloom remarks. To
get a glimpse of the S warthmore work ethic
we need to look no further than its President;
every second of his time is fully utilized.
The President deals with most of his correspondence in between meetings—part of
it is relegated to his administrative assistant
Janet Kazio—as I left from our interview he
was just about to reply to a professor from
Chinawho was interested in meeting the President
during an upcoming U.S. visit.
President Bloom
also managed to
invite an Irish
Seamus
poet,
Heaney, to campus this fall. (The
original plan was
to have him read
his poetry at a memorial service for
late head librarian
Michael Durkan
this semester.)

"A
[Bloom's] work is
done in an informal manner as

said
Eldridge, "by talking to students on

random moPhoto by Diana Hunt ments, etc..."
Tuesday started
out with a three-hour-long President's Staff
Meeting, attended by the heads of each administrative department, in which they discussed both issues arising within their respective departments and larger issues concerning the school as a whole. At 1 p.m.
President Bloom met with the director of
public relations Tom Krattenmaker to devise apian to publicize the President's recent
visit to North Korea along with the AFSC
(American Friends Service Committee) delegation. Shortly after his meeting with

Krattenmaker, Bloom met with Dean Ngina
Lythcott to address student life concerns.
The entire Thursday afternoon was devoted to writing a speech for a keynote address to be given at nearby West Chester
University the following day. "This is an
opportunity to develop a better relationship
with neighboring institutions... to speak publicly about the need in higher education to
prepare students to engage in a pluralistic
world," remarked Bloom.
Bloom thenattended a CPT meeting, where
"we discussed faculty appointments and tenure. I was asked during the afternoon to write
recommendations for several associates and
graduates at other colleges seeking positions.
At a separate meeting with interested students, we sorted out details for developing a
committee of students, staff, and likely faculty to facilitate discussion on different approaches to recycling." From 7:30 p.m. to
8:30 p.m. the President attended an informal
gathering sponsored by the Student Council,
giving students an opportunity to express
their views on the future of the College.
After returning from West Chester on Friday, the President proceeded to work on the
annual President's Report, due to be released
in the near future. Over the weekend, Bloom
attended the Homecoming football gameand
met with several faculty members, as well as
two donors to the College, over dinner.
The week before break, the President was
scheduled to travel to Washington for an
American Friends Service Committee meeting. Towards the end of the month he will
head up to New York for the annual meeting
of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, where he will meet with other college
presidents to discuss financial aid.
During his free time, President Bloom tries
to explore his personal interests, including
travel, international food (as you might have
noticed by now, the President rarely dines at
Sharpies), art, and foreign languages. "My
wife and I try to take a trip to New York once
every few weeks without a business purpose," the President adds.
So is it worthit? "This is... the best possible
purpose I could work f0r...1 am working with
the best community I could imagine working
with," explains President Bloom, beaming
with satisfaction.

Conscious Consumers: The People Behind the Posters

Why

Elizabeth Weber
is a campus consumer organi-

zation bringing in speakers on

Burmese Politics? "We want to

apply our philosophy to everyday decisions,
since these are where we have the most
power," said Mark Charette '99, co-founder
of Conscious Consumers. "To change anything, that's where we have to
start. So much injustice is perpetrated by consumers...if we
don't apply what we know to
everyday life, we oppress un-

consciously."
Conditions in Burma are "indicative of present conditions
with multi-national corporations," said Carew Kraft '99, the
group's other co-founder.
"There's so much exploitation,
murder, rapes, and so forth going on there, all represented in
goods we consume. Our consumption is involved in this."
Charette and Kraft began Conscious Consumers last spring, and the group has been
interested in Burma ever since. Charette
found out about conditions in Burma, and
the related efforts of othercampus consumer
groups "from the Web." However, Kraft
said she had "a personal interest" in the

issue—she participated in an Ohio student
group before coming to Swarthmore. "The
group worked on environmental and human
rights issues, held discussions, showed films,
the usual educational stuff... But we became
very influential as a Burmese human rights
activist group when citizens in our insular
suburb started reacting negatively to our boycotts and protests at local gas stations and
restaurants," she
said.
Conscious Consumers' activities
concerning Burma
have focused on education . They' ve been
responsible for posters and chalkings
around campus, and
have brought speakers to campus, such
—■"■"■"as Rutgers University Professor Emeritus Silverstein on
Tuesday, October 1. Most of their posters and
chalkings have targeted PepsiCo and its products. "Pepsi can reasonably be targeted on this
campus," said Charette, "but Texaco is really
the biggest offender. They're building a pipeline to Thailand with forced labor."
Meredith Hegg 'OO, a member ofConscious
Consumers, explained the group's long term

plans in a short speech before Silverstein
spoke on Tuesday evening. "The organization is working on a buying guide for Swarthmore students which would recommend
companies to support and companies to boycott," she said. In addition, they plan to study
the College's investment and buying practices. They are interested in examining such
things as Scott Paper's involvement with
Chester incinerators and Swarthmore, the
source of thecoffee served in Sharpies, Tarble,
and Kohlberg, and the products sold in the
Bookstore. "We're interested in educating
each other, so that we consume less...and so
that we consume less that's problematic," she
said.
"We have begun discussion with administrators and board members about the creation
of a Student Council-appointed advisory
board to the Board to investigate socially
responible investments for our endowment;
we have done several educational and letterwriting campaigns and have petitioned on
behalfof Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate," said Kraft. "We have also
begun discussion with other campus groups
as to how we can augment their concerns
through our educational efforts. We plan on
working with the Feminist Majority, SPEEC,
Earthlust, SQU, and Amnesty International
because our interests span all of these groups'
concerns."

Conscious Consumers is currently a member of the Civil Liberties Society. They plan
to apply for a charter in the spring in order to
have more influence on campus. "Our political consciousness gets muddled when we
start thinking philosophically, and we think
we have no power. We need to think about
what we do every day, and see how it connects to things around the world," said
Charette.

Open All-Queer Meeting
Sunday, October 27,1p.m.
IC Big Room
Facilitated by Karen Henry
**How can SQU better serve the
interests of queer students,

including those who don't
attend SQU?
**What should the queer
community be doing politically
and socially on campus for the rest
of this year and into the future?
The All-Queer meeting is intended
to give those who don'tregularly
attend SQU meetings a chance to
voice their concerns and

opinions.

City has Batman. Metropolis
has Superman. Eternia has He-Man.
What'da we got? Squat!We got nothing. Zip. Zilch. Nada. What if something
really bad was to happen? What if some
mutant, radioactive spider escapes from the
bio lab, bites Al Bloom on the butt, and
transforms him into some hideous, miceeating, slime-oozing monster? What would
we do? It could happen! I have no idea what
they're doing in Martin! We don't have anyone to protect us!
Swarthmore needs a superhero.
Some ofyou upperclassman might remember the olden days when Swarthmore was
protected from mutant spiders, power hungry presidents, and other such imminent catastrophes by the amazing adhesive powers
of Swarthmore's own super hero, Duct Tape
Man. But those days are long gone. Duct
Tape Man (not to be confused with Duck
Tape Man, who is NOT a superhero, in my
opinion; he's more like a menace to poor
defenseless waterfowl everywhere) has now
graduated and we are forced to fend for ourselves against the powers ofevil that emanate
from the Biology Department.
Something must be done! I don't know if
my bug spray repels mutant, radioactive spiders. We must have a new superhero.
And, if you haven't yet guessed, I have
taken it upon myself to find Swarthmore a
new superhero. We obviously can't depend
on the administration anymore to help us.
They might have all been bitten already.
So lam now taking applications. But you
probably want to know more about the positions that are available, so listen up.
The first post open is for the position of
Laundry Man. Laundry Man, of course, has
very specific and amazing powers. Laundry
Man has a never-ending supply of quarters.
Laundry Man separates whites from colors
and never forgets the fabric softener. But
most importantly, Laundry Man will gladly
beat the living crap out ofanyone who takes
your clothes out of the dryer before you can
retrieve them.
The next opening is for Pick Up HairFrom
The Floor of The Shower Man. This superhero will, whenever beckoned, immediately
come to the bathroom and remove the nasty,
moldy, soggy hair from the drain in your

shower.
Swarthmore also needs a Reserve Binder
Man. Reserve Binder Man has the amazing
ability to return reserve binders that have
been checked out over night to the library
before 9 a.m. the next day so you don't have
to get up early. It is also within the powers of
Reserve Binder Man to enforce punishment
upon those who do not return reserve binders
on time and those who damage, maul, or
remove them.
Swipe Your Card Through the Tarble
Checker Machine Before 8 p.m. Man. Need I
say more?
Next we need a Mail Man. This superhero
will separate your mail from your post office
box buddy's mail, regulate traffic in the mail
room, and retrieve your packages after 3:45
p.m. Disgruntled post office employees need
not apply.
The position for Prozac Man needs to be
filled by a sensitive, caring superhero with a
medical degree and a penchant for therapy.
Physical Education Man. P.E. Man will
fulfill all your physical education requirements, take your swimming test, and always
has time to shower after class.
Lastly, Car Man. All you need is a car.
Of course, none of these positions are gender-specific. Reserve Binder Woman would
do just as well as Reserve Binder Man; it's
just that ReserveBinder Man is easier to type.
Now, if you have a pre-existing superpower
that doesn't seem to fit into any of the offices
available, feel free to create your own position and submit it to me. I am, naturally, an
equal opportunity superhero employer.

ARTS & LEISURE
The Stage Wizards Behind Mathew
Gabriel CumMing

By

When

The New York Times reviewed
Mathew in the School of Life, the
"dazzling science-fiction techno
opera" showing this weekend at S warthmore,
they went so far as to call it a "phantasmagoric music box," complete with "carnival humor and funhouse imagery." Thus it was with
awe and some trepidation that I prepared to
interview Bob McGrath and John Moran,
"two stage wizards," according to The New
Republic, "who work as a single-cell unit."
McGrath is the Artistic Director of the
Ridge Theater, the Manhattan-based, cutting-edge theater company performing
Mathew. He is directing the play, which
Moran conceived of and composed.
Does their jointeffort live up to the Times'
description? Bob thinks so. Viewing Mathew,
which he describes as epic, is "fantastical,
surreal, psychedelic—almost spiritual."
What about the "single-cell" partnership
that spawned this and several previous performances? McGrath and Moran's backgrounds seem strikingly disparate. The mideighties found McGrath and friends acting in
rock-n-roll nightclubs. It was "theater in a
non-theater setting," where the act had to be
the length of the set of a band. The troupe
wanted to do larger, more full-scale pieces,
so, in 1987, a group of them founded the
Ridge Theater.
Moran, meanwhile, lived in small-town
Nebraska. As boys do, he loved music, but
there was a problem: "I didn't have any
instruments." He did, however, have a tape
recorder. Exploring the underground music
scene, he encountered tape-loop experimentation: playing a spoken phrase over and over
until it became absurd, for example. In these
circumstances Moran arrived at his fundamental belief that "any sound [is] a piece of
music."
The two met in 1988; as McGrath puts it,
"John and I...really meshed." Moran's unusual ambition—to "make music out of the

sounds of life" —evidently went along well
with the "non-psychological...non-realistic
acting style" that Ridge Theater was exploring.
McGrath and Moran described to me the
process of creating and producing a piece
such as Mathew in the School of Life. First,
said McGrath, "John has an idea." Moran was
a bit more verbose on this topic. "When
virtual reality is a reality," he dreamily began, "I think that composers will be composing very complex situations and environments, and people will think of that as
music..or composition." Moran spoke as if
of the future, but his goal is to do this sort of
composing now, and he does. The score for
Mathew is no mere soundtrack; it is, as Moran
suggests, a sound environment, including the
plot, setting, and characters in different layers of programming.
For the setting layer, Moran makes an
"overhead map" of the place in which he
imagines the performance taking place, taking into account every tiny detail. Then he
pieces together each part of the total sound
that such a place would make, using "hundreds of sound effects." If the setting were a
field, for instance, every cricket, every passing jet, every rustling grass blade would be
recorded separately, then placed into the
framework of the whole.
To record the linesfor the characters—yes,
the play's dialogue is prerecorded—each actor reads each line many times, in many
different styles, into the recorder. All the
various versions of the line are then melded
into a distorted composite product. Finally,
the whole thing is underscored by music in
the more traditional, instrumental sense.
"Someday people won't need that" Moran
says of the orchestral music, but in the meantime he makes it as meticulously as the rest.
"John doesn't record a violin section,"
McGrath chimes in, "he creates it note by
note" and combines it digitally.
What does McGrath do with this monumental product? It's his job to "bat it

around...bring in the designers...talk to
designers...castit...do therehearsals." In short,
he makes the script into a production. As
Moran puts it, "I do a complete thing and then
[McGrath and The Ridge Theater] redo it, or
they do another complete thing." They begin
with Moran's score and "they texture it...they
make it look like it looks."
The visual aspect of the production is comprised of definite objects that correspond to
the sounds. No sound is actually made on
stage; the actors lip-synch, and any action
that might cause a noise has been incorporated into the score.
Since the McGrath's visual creation is as
complex as Moran's auditory one, each show
becomes a gigantic project. Is it worth it?The
duo admits that it's really difficult. It's "so
exhaustive...so big." But "we just love big
things!" McGrath rejoins, perking up. "It's
just what we do."
"The effect is magical," insist McGrath
and Moran, their proverbial eyes gleaming.
With the music alone creating a complete
world, there is something of a sensory overload whenthe production is viewed, stunning
visuals and all. Moran's comparison to a "3D movie" seems apt; an "effect of being
swept away" is created.
What sort of audience do Moran and
McGrath see as being ready for this experience? McGrath supposes perhaps a younger
audience; "heavy-metal heads?" Moran ventures. Also, Moran likes to describe himself
as a composer's composer. More traditional
opera fans haven't been terribly enthusiastic
about Ridge's operas, but Moran asserts that
it's the "definition of music, not opera, being
stretched."
Are there any after-effects to witnessing a
Ridge Theater spectacle? Moran suggests
that "after you leave you might find that you
see environments in a different way and hear
sounds in a different way." If you don't mind
some alterations to your sense ofreality, then
experience Mathew in the School ofLife this
weekend at theLang Performing Arts Center.

Off-Campus Movie

Shakespeare Revisited An ActionBy

lan Bricke

This

weekend's Drama Board produc
tion of A Midsummer Night's Dream is
ruthlessly pared down, clocking in at
one hour and fifteen minutes. There aren't
any extraneous fairies. And Shakespeare's
comedy has been reinvented as a three-ringcircus of "power and pain." With lots of sex.
It's funny, of course, but the comedy has
bite. In tackling Shakespeare, director Erin
Watson '9B wanted to reinvent what she saw
as an overly familiar, complacentlyinterpreted text.
Having directed scenes from Dre
previously in two consecutiv
Shakespeares-in-the-Crum, Watsoi
was intrigued by the play's dark,
nasty underbelly—the unconventional play papered over by routine insistence on "sweetness an<
light." What if the devious Pucl
were malicious, not the usual happy
little sprite? What if the romantic
adventures and misadventures ofth
play's motley collection of heroes and heroines had real
emotional impact? How
does Shakespeare toy with f~
the aforementioned dy- \.
namics of "power and
it
****
pain?"
Sophomore Erika Johansen's set, placed in
the amphitheater against the backdrop of the
Crum Woods, is made up of roughly-constructed wooden platforms, lit by bamboo
Tiki torches and harsh, unyielding floodlights. It seems appropriate. The production
is simultaneously stark and playful, as straightforward as the wooden platforms and as magical as the flickering Tiki torches.
Puck (Brantley Bryant '99), looking dis-

concertingly like Robert Smith of The Cure,
begins the play, ghostly pale features illuminated by the light of a single flickering torch.
His invitation to the audience is unsettling,
promising things both strange and wonderful. Costumed in lavish capes, tights, and
Venetian masks, the actors dart in and out of
shadows to the accompaniment of live per-

cussion.
Watson acknowledges that this production
of Dream is exaggerated: more sex, more
violence, more of the raunchy humor for
which the Bard is
justly famous. The

love-besotted
Helen (Erica Rauer
'97) throws the object of her
desire, Demetrius (Jonathan
Hauze '9B), to the ground,
threatening to (literally) seize
his affections. Dream's clowns
(Sean Brennan 'OO and Neal
DiMaio, '00), wander in and
out, biting off great chunks of
the scenery.
The cast, which also features
Paula loanide '99, Joel Schultz
'97, Chris Foley '9B, and Andrea
Meller '99, is terrific. As the stage
manager, Kim Gallup '9B,
puts it: My ac
xmm&mx*
BK
B BWBSKH® tors are amazing!"
This production doesShakespeare the honor
of disrespect: it's fast, fresh, funny, and refreshingly nasty.
A Midsummer Night's Dream will be performed in the amphitheater this Friday and
Saturday at 6:30p.m. and this Sunday at 5:30
p.m. If it rains, it will be relocated to the Frear
theater in the Lang Performing Arts Center.
Libations will be poured following the performances.

Packed Kiss
By

Alla Brukman

T%eLong

Kiss Goodnightis Geena Davis'
follow-up to last year's flop Cutthroat
Island. Davis is Samantha Caine, a
schoolteacher who woke up eight years ago

two months pregnant and with amnesia.

Though she is satisfied with her small-town
life with her daughter and boyfriend, she has
hired a disreputable private detective, played
by Samuel L. Jackson, to uncover her past.
It then turns out that Samantha is actually
Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for
the CIA. When her past is revealed, Charly
awakens, and so do the enemies who thought
she was dead.
Davis' female action hero is a rarity in a
field dominated by male actors. She proves
that she can kill and maim with as much ease
as they do, but she also gives an intriguing
performance of a woman with two conflicting personalities. Since Charly doesn't care
much about Samantha's domestic attachments, Samantha has to take over when her
daughter is kidnapped by terrorists. By the
end of the movie, Charly and Sam seem to
coexist peacefully in the same body.
Another enjoyable element ofLong Kiss is
the humor. Jackson's banter with Davis is
one of the high points of the movie. His
indignation at being drawn into a situation
where he constantly has guns pointed at him
is truly hilarious. The ending has some completely absurd moments as people survive
after crashing into trucks, being shot, and
being pushed off bridges. On the whole, however, Long Kiss is one of those enjoyable
movies thatdoesn'trequire too much thought.

Rumble with Jackie Chan; Roll with Kid ’n Play
By Emily Shartin
&

killing

him.
Needless to say,
Chan's character

Andy Murray

The

disappointment that follows watch
ing Jackie Chan' s Rumble in the Bronx
is not a result of its shallowness. It
stems from an unavoidable suspicion that, as
a movie, Rumble was much more fun to make
than it ever could be to watch. Just before the
closing credits roll, there is a series of outtakes that show what it was like on the movie' s
set. There are full takes of highly choreographed fight sequences with Chan squeezing through a shopping cart or sliding through
a car's sunroof, an up-close view of a
stuntwoman as she crashes her motorbike
racing over a line of parked cars, even Chan's
bungled jump onto a moving hovercraft that
left him with a broken foot for the completion
of filming. In each out-take, the film crew
rushes in after the scene is completed to
congratulate the successful or to give first-aid
to the injured. Watching it happen on screen,
anyone still left in the theater can't help
feeling a little bit like a younger sibling left
behind when the older kids go off to do
something daring and exciting.
For anyone who missed the media blitz
surrounding his American debut, JackieChan

spends his vacation running, hiding, taunting, escaping and fighting.
This frantic
motion is the
only thing worth
in
watching
Rumble. The
fight sequences

between Chan
and the New
York
street
punks are eyepopping and impressive. Refrigerators and hovercrafts have an odd way of
popping up in unusual places, but it is easy to
forgive their appearance when they are so
inventively incorporated into the stunts or
fight choreography. Like any Chan flick,
there is also the added element of intrigue in
knowing that the main actor is performing his
own stunts. Once one begins to identify with
Chan and to like his personality, each of his
Photo by Fang Cai

is the HongKong movie star known for doing
all his own stunts. Rumble In the Bronx was
the first of Chan's films that was intended to
have a major run in American theaters. It is a
story of a young Chinese man visiting New
York City for his uncle's wedding (the movie
was obviously filmed in Vancouver). Like
any tourist visiting the Big Apple, he faces
hundreds of thugs and syndicates bent on

becomes a breathtaking moment of
suspense. The twist on what is real and what
is staged in the process of filmmaking may
even leave audiences slightly disturbed.
Rumble falls flat with every pause in the
action. Woefully uninteresting as a story,
Rumble amounts to nothing more than fantastic action scenes, ruined by the adjoining
filler. After defending himself from a group
of young attackers, Chan pauses to say, "I
hope the next time we meet, we can sit down
together over tea." The idea is intriguing
because it is unimaginable that such a moral
would be inserted into an American action
flick, but in all truth, the moment is as shallow
as the film's plot. If Chan were to sit down
and seriously sip his tea in any one of his
movies, he would be rewarded by theater
audiences angrily walking out and demanding their money back.

Though many of us have probably forgotten them, the movie House Party endures as
a testament to Kid 'n Play's always groovy
hip-hop and terpsichorean capabilities.
The plot is anything but profound, but its
framework provides for plenty of amusement: Play is throwing a huge bash for his
stunts

high school buddies that Kid wants to attend,
but can't because his strict dad (played by
Robin Harris) has grounded him.
Kid sneaks out, only to be confronted by
the gang of school bullies he keeps accidentally offending. He also has a run-in with two
foolishly stereotypical white cops who seem
to think they are the shining beacons oflaw in
the midst of an urban gang war.
Silliness ensues. Kid eventually ends up at
Play' s party, dancing his ass offand macking
on all the girls. Some of the best scenes of the
movie ensue: the flirtatious dance-challenge
scene and the freestyle rap scene. HereKid 'n
Play really get to show off theirtalents and let
us (and the girls they are trying to impress)
see why, although the hip-hop world has
evolved a lot since then, they were certainly
worthy of carrying their own movie in 1990.
Keep an eye out for cameos by Martin
Lawrence and the inimitable George Clinton.
And fun it is. House Party is certainly not
recommended for those film-goers who prefer all things weighty, but it leaves us to
wonder what it might be like if Kid 'n' Play
(wherever they might be now) were to show
up at Paces on a Saturday night.
House Party plays Saturday night at 7:30

"We learned an incredible amount by playing Princeton. We played with class and kept

stronger team. We never lost our confidence

The B-side Swarthmore team also had a
chance to face this strong opponent. They
played for threefifteen-minute periods against
a Princeton team which constantly substituted rested athletes onto the field. However,

the Swarthmore players, without having the
liberty to take breaks due to their small numbers, improved during each period. Princeton
scored four times in the first period, two in the
second, and not at all in the third.
The Princeton coach marveled at the
strength and perseverance of the Swarthmore
women's rugby team. He praised the team
highly, observing to one of the players that
Swarthmore had a good game strategy and
should have a very good chance of winning
their last two games of the season.
Barnett and Philpott echoed these remarks.
Both feel that their team learned a lot from
playing such a strong team and can take this
experience and use it to their advantage to
finish the season. They play at Bryn Mawr

Men's Rugby Tries But Fails
Sturm

The Swarthmore men's rugby team suf-

fered a couple of losses over Fall Break to
evenly matched foes who were able to execute the little things necessary to win a
rugby match. The Evil Buzzards lost to divisional foe Temple on October 12, and to the
University of Delaware team a week later in
the playoffs.
Temple took advantage of a depleted
Swarthmore back line and sprinted to several
easy tries in the second half, putting the game
out of reach early in the second period. But
the Swarthmore forward pack performed well,
doing a solid job of winning most of the rucks
and scrums.
Swarthmore was down by less than a try at
half time, thanks to a couple of tries by the
backs. Adam Blescia '97 continued his scoring binge this year, intercepting a pass early
and streaking halfway down the field for the
try. Dan Green '99 scored his first try of the
season, breaking through with a nice run off
a back line and touching down the ball for the

score.
The next week, Swarthmore travelled to
the home of DuPont, sponsors of their field,
to face Delaware, who handed the Buzzards
their only loss oflast season. However, in this
case the Buzzards were hoping thatDelaware
would become their first win of the cam-

paign. The postage-stamp field was halfsubmerged after an extended downpour all
the day before and much of the morning,

stopping just before game time. A monstrous
puddle, as wide as Crum Creek and as deep in
places, occupied much of one try zone.
Swat started strong, as Blescia scored yet

Lady Garnet advance
in standings.
By

Jean Quinn

The Swarthmore women's field
hockey team had a successful October Break and extended their win
streak against CentennialConference
rivals. The Garnet'soverall record is
now 12-4, and at 6-0 in the conference, and they retain their lock on
first place along with Gettysburg who
is also undefeated. The highly anticipated match that will decide first
place between the top teams in the
conference will take place here this
Saturday at 1 p.m. on Cunningham
Fields.
Over break, the Garnet had only
two games. The squad traveled to
New York for a day of practice before taking on Ithaca. Swarthmore
defeated Ithaca, who was ranked #4
nationally, 2-1. The gamewas a close
one, every minute of play. As it was
very competitive, it madethe victory
even more enjoyable. Jen Hagan '99
and Becca Stites 'OO each knocked
one into the cage for the Garnet. In
the words of Captain Lia Ernst '97,
"TheIthaca game was a great win
the whole team played extremely
well, and it showed that we are capable of playing against any team."
Once the team returned to Pennsylvania, they practiced for a day
before journeying to Susquehanna.
Danielle Duffy '9B scored the only
goal of the gameto propel the Garnet
to victory. Some players have reported that they were unhappy with
the team's performance because they

thought they should have beaten
Susquehanna by a greater margin.
The team had the latter half of

season last Sunday. Against Bryn
Mawr on Tuesday, Swarthmore dominated the game. Goals by Samantha
Peltz '97 and Kristen Osborne '97
gavethe team a 2-0 win. The Garnet's
win streak against Centennial Conference opponents covers two seasons. Last year, the team did not drop
any match to a conference rival, and
they stand poised to repeat that triumph if they can get past Gettysburg
and Haverford next week.
Kelly Wilcox '97 earned a spot on
the Conference Honor Roll for stopping 11 solid shots by Ithaca and for
picking up another shutout against
Susquehanna.
Despite the team's success this season, it is possible that they might not
advance into post-season action. The
regional ranking this week placed
Swarthmore eighth. The top three,
possibly four, teams usually go on to
the NCAA tournament. Swarthmore
could move up in the ranking if they
beat #4 Gettysburgand #6 Rowan this

week, but how high they can move up
the ladder is unknown.
The team will try to bring home
another victory and win a Hood Point
against Haverford next Tuesday. The
Garnet welcome fans to cheer them
on at their last two games against
Gettysburg and Haverford and promise they willboth be exciting matches.
Improving theirchances ofadvancing into playoffs, the team picked up
a 2-1 overtime win against Rowan
Thursday. Rowan scored in the first
half of the game and kept the lead
midway through the second half.
Osborne scored for the Garnet to tie
the game and sent it into overtime.
With only seven players on the field
in the extra period, Duffy broke away
from the field and scored the winning
goal, shooting the ball over Rowan's
goalkeeper who had fallen on the
ground. The victory will give the
team extra confidence and spirit in
preparation for the big Gettysburg
game tomorrow.

Over the two weekends that bracketed October break, the Garnet Tide
continued their losing skid against
Muhlenberg and Pomona-PitzerColleges. The Tide began their break
with traveling to Allentown to meet
the Muhlenberg Mules where they
lost a heartbreaker of a game 40-27.
The Mules jumped out to an early
lead with a touchdown reception. The
Tide countered when Pat Straub '97
found Brian Bell '99 in the endzone
on a fourth and goal play. Then,
shortly following that, Charlie
Parlapanides '99 forced a fumble
which Tony Skiadas '99 picked up
and returned for a touchdown. The
Mules answered with a pair of touchdowns just before halftime, but not
before Eddie Shin '97 could pound
into the endzone for the Tide's lone
rushing touchdown of the game.
S warthmoreheld a2l -19 lead at halftime.
At the opening of the second half,
it looked as though the Garnet might
be able to carry over their momentum
of thefirst half. Tight end Tom Forstik
'OO reeled in his third touchdown
pass in three games. However, this
was thelast time during the game that
the Tide would find themselves celebrating in the endzone.
Muhlenberg answered back with
two touchdown passes and one rushing touchdown to take the game into
their hands. S warthmoreleft the field
with a 40-27 loss on their record.
Last weekend, the Garnet opened
up theirfour-year series withPomonaPitzerCollegeofCalifornia.The Tide
went into the game not knowing exactly what to expect from a team that
was remarkably similar to themselves
in terms of numbers, talent, and even
academics.
Fans at the game who braved the
weather witnessed the complete
breakdown of most of the Tide's
teams. The Garnet were only able to
muster one score: a 78-yard touchdown reception from Straub to Lou
Basenese 'OO. In the meantime, the
Tide's defense did not play up to the
level it has been in past games, allowing 48 points to Pomona's offense.
This week, the Tide hope to start
anew with another upset win over
Dickinson College, a perennial Conference title contender. Recall that
last year the Tide pulled off a huge
upset over the Red Devils beating
them in the last minutes of the game
19-18. Dickinson's thoughts will
surely be towards revenge, while the

Mike Schall, the centerback on the men's soccer team, has garnered
quite a few impressive stats for himselfthis past week. Having started as
a freshman, Mike continues to excel instead ofexperiencing the so-called
"sophomore slump." In the game against NYU, he assisted on the lone
goal of the game by David Lane '97. Then, in the game against Eastern
College, Schall tallied yet another assist on senior Amber Thompson's
goal in the first half. Solid on defense as well, Mike is known for his ability
to catch up with any opponent's breakaways. Most importantly, as Kyle
Barnett '97 said, "No matter what the score ofthe game is, you know that
Mike will do his best."

Women's Soccer Team
Tastes Sweet Revenge

Beth Wiles

On the first Saturday of October
Break, the women' s soccer team again
suffered the misfortune of traveling
in a school bus. This time, the destination was downtown Manhattan,
where the team took on New York

on top and defeated Bryn Mawr by
the score of 3-1.
Though Swarthmore controlled the
flow of the game the entire first half
and was obviously the superior team,
the players still touna themselves
down 1-0 at halftime.
Coach Alex Ely exhorted his team
to pull themselves together with a
powerful half time speech. "You
know, girls, all you need is one goal
and this team... they will fall apart.
You get one goal, you win this game."

which combined to hamper
the team's ability to play.
NYU tookadvantage and pounced on the disorientatedSwarthmore players early in the
first half, scoring twice and completely confounding the players ability to put any plays together. Jennifer
Vander Veer '99 played extremely
well in the midfield and Janice
Gallagher '99 anchored the defense,
yet Swarthmore was unable to group
themselves together and put together
a string of strong scoring opportunities until late in the second half, ending the frustration.
Down 3-0, the Swarthmore offense
finally began clicking and generated
an excellent scoring opportunity in
the form of a direct kick 25 yards out
from the goal. Kirstin Knox '99
launched a powerful shot that sailed
into the upper right corner ofthe goal
for the team's only score of the game.
After the game, several of the players with New York connections stayed
to enjoy the city, whiletherest trooped
home in the big yellow bus and
mourned the fact that NYU did not
have showers.
Swarthmore then encountered perennial rival Bryn Mawr in a Centennial Conferencematch. Conditions at
Bryn Mawr were similar to NYU, the
field was extremely small and the
weather was cold and blustery. However, this timeSwarthmore came out

Roughly

into the second half, Knox did so by

Those who had connections to
make on their trip home sweated nervously about the possibility of overtime, until Amy Markey '99 assured
herself of catching her train by sailing through the air on the way to
volleying home another goal. Vander
Veer sealed the victory when she
deflected a cross into the net. Swarthmorerose to fifth place in the Conference with this win.
Swarthmore's final game of break
was Saturday whenthe team traveled
to Johns Hopkins University to face
the number one team in the conference. Game conditions were poor, a
combination of cold, wind and wet
turf. The players were once again
discombobulated by the bouncy turf
playing surface, and Hopkins dominated the game.
In addition, several key players like
Sarah Jaquette '9B and Laura Starita
'97 were unavailable to play in the
game. Though captain Claire Baxter
'9B and Betsy Rosenbaum '9B both
turned in solidperformances, the team
again had difficulty stringing together
passes to create legitimate scoring
opportunities. The game ended with
a 7-0 Hopkins victory.

Men's Cross-Country
Stellar Performance
By

Nevin Katz

The leaves are changing colors,
the weather is becoming cool and
crisp, and the pace is picking up for
SwarthmoreCross Country. The turning point occurred the weekend before October break, when the men's
team mixed it up at the Dickinson
Invite, where they finished eighth
out of thirty teams.
Despite Coach Ted Dixon's absence, there was enough leadership
on the men's team to keep their spirits high. The pack of 230-plus runners went out like a herd of buffalo,
but the Garnet team hung tough.
As the runners moved into smaller
clusters, each runnerremembered the
words of Wyn Strodtbeck '97 "It is
time to be serious. If you feel yourselfslowing down, push harder. This
is a flat course, there's no reason why
you should be saving anything."
Towards the end of the race, Liam
O'Neill 'OO was actually able to smell
success in the air. "As I rounded the
crest of the final hill, I smelled the
victory. It smelled like the fragrance
of pine and potpourri. That's when I
knew everything would fall into
place," he said.

O'Neill placed fourth overall with
a time of 24:58.4. The next Garnet
runner to finish was the illustriously

speedy Phil Jones '99 in 20th at
26:37.4. Graham Lucks '9B careening into a strong 72nd at 27:50. Other
top finishers included Strodtbeck in
80th at 27:50.8, Gordon Roble '99 in
98th at 28:12.3, Cameron Warner '97
in 119th, Josh Bloom 'OO in 141st,
and Nevin Katz '99 in 178th.

Swarthmore also made a strong
showing in the Junior Varsity race, in
which junior JeffLockman captured
a personal best record of 30:47, followed by senior Eric Pakurar (a
sprinter)) at 30:57,and Dave Phillips
'99 at 31:14.
In the grand scheme, the meet was
a rousing success. The Garnet placed
eighth out of 30 teams, finishing ahead
of conference rivals Dickinson and
Allentown among others and nearly
toppling Franklin and Marshall and
Gettysburg. All this was achieved
without the help the help of top runners Kerry Boeye '97 and Jeremy
Weinstein '97.
This Saturday, the full crew will
take on the competition at the prestigious Centennial Conference meet,
hosted by Gettysburg.
