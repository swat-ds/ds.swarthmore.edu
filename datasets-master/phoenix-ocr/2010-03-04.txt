Braun discusses future during visit

Dean of Students-Designate Liz Braun came
to the college Sunday to meet students at a
special StuCo meeting. Among other issues,
Braun discussed the search for a new BCC
director, the possibility of a student senate
and future collaboration with StuCo. Page 3

Board contributions fill $1
million budget gap

Members of the Board of Managers have
decided to personally provide $1 million
each year for the next three years. The idea
was proposed by Eugene Lang '3B, who will
contribute $700,000 each year himself.
Although this will provide a short-term solution, the college must reevaluate the budget
for the long-term. Page 4

Indie director highlights

Actor Ben Stiller makes his first major
venture into serious film in the upcoming
film, "Greenberg." Directed by Noah
Baumbach, "Greenberg" looks into the
life of a single 40-year-old with no direction and his awkward interactions with
old and new acquaintances. While Stiller
succeeded in understanding Greenberg's
character, the real standout performance
is from actress Greta Garwig. Page 9

features artists Simon Shaheen, A.J.

In Media, a warm, delightful taste of France invites

Alliedßarton's labor policies are questionable and worry that subcontracting from
the company might violate the college's
commitment to a "living wage." The college has said, however, that the positions
are paid competitive wages and, given the
difficulty of hiring workers for late night
shifts, are necessary. Page 5

Dean of Students-Designate Liz Braun speaks with Student Council Vice President Deivid Rojas during her visit on Sunday.

BY LINDA HOU
rhoul@swarthmore.edu
Dean of Students-Designate Liz Braun
opened Sunday's special Student Council
meeting with stories of her son recently
singing Swarthmore chants and planning
a teddy bear picnic in the Crum Woods.
After this humor, Braun launched into

a discussion of more serious issues, such
as the upcoming search process for a BCC
director, student wellness and the potential implementation of a student senate.
She stressed that these kinds of meetings with the student body were important because she needs to learn more
about Swarthmore before she can make
concrete decisions.
"I think I need to learn Swarthmore,
and Swarthmore needs to learn me,"
Braun said. "By doing that, I can know
groups like StuCo and can know how I
can help you."
Involvement in dean replacements
As the position of Black Cultural
Center Director has been vacant since
Tim Sams' departure for NYU Abu Dhabi
in January, the college is planning to
form a group of students, faculty mem-

bers and administrators later this semester to gather information for a "sculpting
document" that the search committee can
use to write a job description. Acting
Dean of Students Garikai Campbell '9O
said that it's still undecided how members of the group will be chosen.
Next year, the college would not fill
Kelly Wilcox '97 recently vacated position
of assistant director of student life and
academic advisor, according to Braun.
Instead, Braun said that she would like to
see the whole department take on the
wellness initiatives that Wilcox was
involved in.
Campbell said that he is uncertain of
his future plans after Braun takes over
on July L Before temporarily filling in for
former Dean of Students Jim Larimore's
absence last year, Campbell served as
associate dean for academic affairs.

At the Sunday meeting with Braun,
Appointments Chair Sonja Spoo 'l3
brought up these replacements. Spoo said
•

that there was an urgent need for a BCC
director. Campus Life Representative
Watufani Poe 13 agreed, adding that the
lack of a Swarthmore African American
Student Society president makes the matter even more pressing.
"SASS doesn't have a president... and
Dean Sams helped them with that, and
it's a really shaky time for them not to
have a dean," Poe said.
Braun said that she, President
Rebecca Chopp and Campbell recently
discussed these positions over the phone.
"After consultation, we'll put up a
search committee and they'll put together
a job description," Chopp said in an interview. "As always, when a position that
comes out, we have to ask the students
what they wanted and the faculty."

Mount Holyoke's student senate worked

"It really became a venue
to engage a large group of students on pol-

issues," Braun said.
At Mount Holyoke, issues regarding
the allowance of smoking in dorms and
24-hour-access cards to all dorms were
settled by the senate.

Board contributions fill

the Swarthmore

College Board of Managers came forward to announce that it- will contribute $1 million to the college each
year over the course of the next three
years to make up part of the $l.l million in cuts that was left unidentified
by the board in December.
"The initiative to raise the million
dollars was started by Gene Lang ['3B]
to address the gap that we had not
defined in our adjustment process,"
President Rebecca Chopp said.

Tri-Co community members dance to live music performed by Crowfoot in a contra
dance session in Upper Tarble Saturday night.

The decision came out of the
board's first meeting of the spring
2010 semester, during which they
passed the college's operating budget
for the 2010-2011 school year. The
budget has increased by L 5 percent
from slightly over $lO7 million to
$108.6 million, including an 11 percent
increase in financial aid.
In December, the board adopted a
plan to adjust the budget, which
included the goal of cutting $8 million
for the next academic year. The Ad
Hoc Financial Planning Group was
able to identify places to cut all but
the last $l.l million and decided to
wait another year or two to make
these final cuts.
In an e-mail to the community,
Chopp explained that the money is
only a short-term solution. "Although
the Board's generosity does not eliminate the deeper, longer-term budget
issues, their donations provide us the
time we need to think strategically
about resolving the issues in the context of the strategic direction-setting
process that will begin in the fall,"
Chopp said in her e-mail.
According to Sue Welsh, vice president for finance and treasurer, the
remaining tenth of a million dollars
that remains unaccounted for will
likely come from job attrition. No one
will be laid off, but when positions
become open, they may not be filled.
"After three years, we can only
hope that the endowment will be in
better shape and our operating budget
will not have to be cut more," said student council president Rachel Bell 'lO
in an e-mail. She added that she was
very pleased and grateful for the
board's contributions.
Samuel Hayes '57, a member of the
board and the former chairman of the
investment committee, said, "It was a
rather spontaneous decision on the
part of the board.... Gene Lang offered
to direct some of his charitable giving
to the college and said he would like
to see the rest of the board of trustees
step up to contribute the rest so they
could better assess where the endowment would be in another year."
Lang, a former chair of the board,
will contribute $700,000 of his own
money each year for the next three
years. Giles Kemp '72, who Chopp said
was particularly concerned about the
future of financial aid, has pledged to
contribute $150,000 each year for the
next three years, and several other
members of the board have agreed to
donate the rest of the money.
"I think this is extraordinarily generous on the parts of these board

members, especially because we all
already contribute yearly, and we are
looking forward to a new capital campaign in the next year," Hayes said.
He has also donated to the fund.
Lang allocated another $lOO,OOO per
year over the next three years to constitute a fund that the president can
use for faculty or students who were
affected by the budget- cuts.
For example, it may be used to pay
for summer research opportunities

for students.

Lang's $700,000 donation will also
help protect the college's current
financial aid policy of need-blind
admission, the ability to meet all

demonstrated need and the loan-free
initiative. According to Welsh, all of
these policies enable students from all
socioeconomic backgrounds to attend
Swarthmore.
"Part of Mr. Lang's desire to contribute all this money was the possibility that if [the college] had to come
up with this additional money, we
might have to change the loan-free
initiative, and he wanted to prevent
that from happening. So at this point,
barring any change in our financial
situation, we don't see that changing
at least not for the next year, or several years," Welsh said.
Welsh added, however, that the
scholarships awarded by the college
are growing at a rate that is equal to
the demand, and that financial aid
will be among several issues reviewed
by the board over the next two years.
Hayes stressed the importance of
financial aid's evaluation in the
future.
"It's my personal opinion that our
current need-blind policy is not sustainable in the future, given the likely
trends in the future for financial aid
from applicants
and we have to
come to grips with the fact that the
requests for financial aid will
increase beyond what we can afford,"
he said.
Welsh said that, no matter what
happens, the college remains committed to maintaining its policies for students who are already enrolled and
that any changes will be phased in for
new students. "But I think we're protected now for several years," she
added.
The new budget allows for salary
increases between two and three percent for faculty.
"We made no raises last year so
we're very thankful to be able give
them this year," Chopp said of this
decision.
Students will be expected to contribute more from summer earnings
to their tuition.
First year students are supposed to
pay $2OOO, up from $1450, and other
students will see an increase from
$lB9O to $2500. Welsh said that these
increases already occurred periodically, but that this was the first time
in nine years.
She added that students still have

Activists angered over subcontracted security jobs
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ALLISON GANTT

aganttl@swarthmore.edu

Recent reports of subcontracted
Alliedßarton security officers on the
Swarthmore campus have outraged
and concerned labor activists and students alike this past week due to accusations about the company's labor
practices. According to Director of
Public Safety. Owen Redgrave and
Director of Human Resources Melanie
Young, however, the employees are

being paid fairly.
The two Alliedßarton security officers currently employed part-time on
campus receive a salary between $11.82
and $20.80 an hour, above the college's
minimum wage, set at $11.31.
Alliedßarton employees at the
Philadelphia Museum ofArt have been
the center of an ongoing national

debate about both the worker's
salaries and the company's labor policy. The company has been accused of
anti-union actions, and Philadelphia
activists are gathering to protest this

Friday.

Dani Noble 'l2, a member of the
Swarthmore Labor Action Project, said
that the combination of Alliedßarton's
labor rights history and the very idea
of subcontracting at the college warrants attention.
"It's of a concern that these changes
will eventually lead to more subcontracting, and that can be really harmful to the institution's commitment to
right to bargain collectively and fair
wages," Noble said.
Other students fear business with

Swarthmore set a standard for what
those worker-employer relationships
should look like," England said.
The college's minimum wage is
based on the "living wage standards"
set by the Ad Hoc Committee on Living
Wage in 2004, which came in response
to concerns raised by the Living Wage
and Democracy Campaign. The committee calculated the costs of living in
Delaware County, and the majority of
the group recommended that the college increase the minimum wage to the
salary necessary to sustain a household supported by a single employee.
According to Young, the figure is
reevaluated each school year to
account for inflation. For the 2010-2011
school year, this amount is expected to

County set the self-sufficiency hourly
wage at $10.73 for a single adult. The
rate is higher for adults with children.
"In speaking to a living wage, one

in the 19905. The group, originally
called the Garnet Patrol, was supported
by StuCo and the dean's office. Students
served as the auxiliary officers at the
time.
Students, however, were often called
off when the weather was poor or when
exams were approaching. "We ended up
with a lot of periods of time when no
one was walking around," Redgrave
said.
To ensure student safety, the college
began contracting the position themselves. However, the part-time and
weather-dependent nature of the job led
to periods when the college would be

Redgrave said. "The turnover was
always much higher than we were comfortable with," Redgrave added.

Lilly Ledbetter, an equal pay activist
and inspiration for the 2009 Equal Pay
Act, will speak at Bryn Mawr on March
22. Her trip is sponsored by the X
Factor, a student-run lecture series.
As the only female manager for
Goodyear Tire Company in the 19705,
Ledbetter realized that she was getting
paid about $l,OOO to $2,000 less than her
male counterparts. In 1998, after she
retired, Ledbetter sued Goodyear for
discrimination and her case eventually
went to the Supreme Court. The Court
ruled that Ledbetter and other employees can't sue their employers over pay
discrimination more than 180 days after
receiving discriminatory paychecks.
Most recently, Ledbetter has worked
with lawmakers to introduce the Fair
Pay Act in 2009, which became the first
bill President Barack Obama signed
upon entering office.

The lecture, called "Discrimination
in the Workplace: An Evening with
Lilly Ledbetter," will be held in Thomas
Great Hall.
The night will open with Ledbetter
and then continue with Jocelyn
Samuels, an expert on discrimination
who previously worked with Ledbetter
on her legislation and now works for the
National Woman's Law Center. Samuels
is also the mother of Abigail Olson 'lO,
who worked with the X-Factor to bring
Ledbetter to campus.
The X-Factor lecture series is run by
Sophomores Clare Amari, Yong Jung
Cho, and Brittany Sampson. The XFactor is part of L.E.A.P., or the
Leadership
Empowerment
and
Advancement Program.

"There's this great test that you do

Worn by professors and Sherlock Holmes (though his

eclectic. While some would consider tweed to be more
casual and not for evening wear, it is a style that returns
to the runways every fall. Hattem's outfit looks more like
a well-groomed and dapper man than a disheveled professor. While keeping it simple with the sweater, pants and
.shoes, Hattem livens up the look with a purple tie and
shirt. The timelessness of the tweed jacket makes
Hattem's style stand out even more amongst the range of
styles of college men.

Where He Shops:
Hattem enjoys shopping for cheap

most of his shopping back home at mainly

Wardrobe Staples:
"I'd say a lot of my stuff ends up being
wardrobe staples," Hattem said. "I'm sort of
boring in that I wear the same things over and
over again." His de la Renta sweater is something that he enjoys wearing all of the time.

How He Describes His Style:
"It's sort of like, disco-professory maybe," Hattem said.
"I think I favor tight clothes, light colors." He has a fondness for suit jackets, usually in either tweed or corduroy.
His combination of the quirky professional look with
accents of color produce a style that he calls "very sort of
70s professor." Hattem also added that most of his outfits
have aspects of Florentine fashion. While many think of
Milan as an Italian fashion capital, Florence is one of the
main producers of menswear. It hosts one of the biggest
men's fashion event, Pitti Uomo, which features clothing
from Italian and international designers.

In Media, a warm, delightful taste of France invites
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

Among the many treasures

that one can find as they venture
out of The Bubble and into the
small town of Media is La Belle
Epoque. The restaurant offers traditionalFrench cuisine in a menu
that seeks to delight with wellknown favorites from France, a
country synonymous with good
food. This French wine bistro,
located in the middle of downtown Media at the intersection of
State Street and Olive Street, is a
great find for those looking for
good food in a place with a friendly ambiance as well as those
yearning for a little taste of

France.
The bistro boasts a trendy
decor, mixing warm colors of purple and brown and effectively uti-

lizing a red brick wall and a glass

window that allows for a beauti-

ful view of downtown Media. The
chandeliers blend well with the
famous old posters of the Moulin
Rouge by Toulouse-Lautrec that
are now the staple depiction of
Montmartre, the once bohemian
capital of Paris.
La Belle Epoque is a product of
its owner and head chef Loic
Barnieu. Barnieu grew up in a
small village in Burgundy,
France in a family familiar with
the food business. One of his
grandfathers owned a bakery,
while his other grandfather was a
chef and also owned a restaurant.
Barnieu moved to Philadelphia to
pursue his passion for theater
and opened up La Belle Epoque
and Picasso, a restaurant in
Media serving Mediterranean
fusion cuisine.
Drawing
from Barnieu's
French roots, La Belle Epoque
offers a menu packed with many
traditional French dishes. For me

personally, the menu is reminiscent of those that I had seen during my semester abroad in Paris.
The appetizers, which are fairly
priced at $5-13, include a good
french onion soup (soupe a
l'oignon), escargots (snails in butter and garlic) and meat and
cheese plates (charcuterie and
plateau de fromages) that complement the generous variety of

white and red wines offered.
There are also classic French salads like Nicoise and Verte and
crepes that cost $lO on average.
For the entree portion of the meal,
ranging from $lB-32, there are
choices of steak, lamb, chicken
and duck. The dessert menu
includes the typical creme brulee
and crepes with Nutella and fruit
jams.

Among the four of us that
dined at La Belle Epoque, we tried
a wide variety of food, finding
everything to be well-prepared,

delicious and satisfying, although
not flawless. We started with the
soupe a l'oignon and the escar-

gots. The soup was overall adequate in taste, but compared to
my experiences in France, lack-

ing in heartiness. The escargots
were magnificent, but I was troubled by the fact that the snails
were pre-extracted. For me, the
true experience of these two dish-

es is the heartiness of the cheese
that is so sticky that it is almost
impossible to eat cleanly, and the
adventure of picking out the
escargot from its shell.
Apart from these concerns, the
rest of the meal went smoothly.
My friends tried and liked the
boeuf bourguignon (beef braised
in a red Burgundy wine), the
roast chicken (poulet roti) with a
side of vegetables, and the chicken and pork stew special. I thoroughly enjoyed my tangy Canard
a l'orange (duck in an orange

marmalade sauce). As for dessert,
which is often the hardest part of
the meal to mess up, the creme
brulee and crepes with Nutella
filling were delicious. However,

the chocolate cake was surprisingly flat and lacking in taste,
unfortunately awakening me to
the treacherous possibility that

one could mess up chocolate cake.
La Belle Epoque offers an
authentic French experience of
good food, good wine and good
conversation. It is a great place to
relax on any given evening and to
escape the worries of The Bubble
and oflife in general. I highly recommend La Belle Epoque but
with one final caveat: Go with
people you're comfortable with.
Like I said, it offers an
French experience" which, for
those who have been to France
already know, means slow service
that is meant to create a relaxed
and conversational atmosphere.

Finding time for sleep can remedy midterm stress
swarthmorephoenix.com

Katie Becker
Well, Well, We 11...

It's nearly the end.
One more
day, and a
glorious
break will
be upon us.
Thank God
I'll finally be able
to get some
sleep.
I
hope that's
what

you're
thinking
too. And I
hope that you'll sincerely follow through
on that desire to get more sleep during
break. Chances are that you need to
catch up on sleep more than you need to
hang out until 4 a.m. with your friends
t^m—

from home or catch up on all the seasons
of Lost. Yet, we sometimes don't follow
through with our intention to sleep
more once we have the opportunity,
which probably has to do with our habit
of placing little value on sleep during the
semester. Spring break is a chance to
change those sleeping habits, however,
and that can transform the rest of your

semester.

of my professors recently mentioned that whenever you talk to students about sleeping more, the usual
rolling.
eye
involves
response
Understandably so. If we thought we
could afford to sleep more, we probably
would. Sadly, we all too often feel that
we don't have enough time to get all of
our work done and sleep as much as we
need to, let alone as much as we'd like.
Then there's the old scenario I first
heard as a first-semester freshman:
pick two of
sleep, work or friends
these options. When we're not working
and still not sleeping, it's probably
because we want to retain some semOne

blance of humanity by at least maintaining' old friendships and maybe even
building new ones. It gets tiring in a
non-physical sense to work all day and
then just go to sleep once everything's
done. I'm not a robot, and I don't enjoy
behaving like an academic work
machine. That's where friends come in.
So I'm not going to begrudge anyone for
missing out on some sleep due to social
time; that's important as well. But, that
gets us back to where we started and I
still haven't offered any solutions.
What follows may seem like radical,
daring or simply reckless advice from a
second-semester senior finished with
her major requirements with the added
bonus of being able to pass-fail every
course this semester if necessary, but I
assure you, there's some sense to it. Go
-to sleep. Do not finish that problem set,
or

just go to sleep. Simple
right?
No, not really, and I won't
lie to you. The above advice actually involves a decent amount of planning and organization. For example, to
take that advice, you actually have to
start your paper, problem set, lab report,
Phoenix column, etc., more than a day

in advance. When you don't leave yourself any time for your assignments, of
course it feels like sleep isn't an option.

and task completion sounds like the perfect recipe for successfully taking a
midterm, which means that sleep holistically benefits your exam experience.
Not only that, but memory consolidation
also occurs during sleep. Sure, you
might have stayed up two nights in a
row studying for your midterm, but
that'll all be a waste if you don't give

your brain a chance to biologically
process those memories and make that
information available to you during
your exam. Sleep also boosts your
immune system, so that your body will
be equipped to avoid whatever Swat
plague is going around—which will
clearly enable you to stay productive
during those times, such as midterms,
when you can't afford to slow down.
If you're still hard-pressed to dedicate
another hour or two to sleep a night,
there are at least some excellent benefits
of napping that may be of interest to
you. Short naps—preferably 10 to 20
minutes long, but certainly no longer
than 30 minutes—can significantly
increase alertness and performance and
reduce mistakes and accidents in the
period immediately following and up to
several hours after the nap. Here's the
catch: Napping cannot replace normal
nighttime sleep and you are still vulnerable to the negative effects of sleep deprivation, even if you are a committed
napper. One such negative effect of sleep
deprivation that is especially relevant to
those devout nap-takers among you: You
are more likely to be affected by sleep
inertia, a period of grogginess and disorientation, for a longer period of time
after awakening from your nap than
someone who gets enough sleep at night.
So naps aren't a cure-all. They shouldn't
be considered a substitute for continuous nighttime sleep.
Now that you're armed with information, go on break and get some sleepnot because you need to take midterms
when you're on break, but because you
probably have a massive sleep debt. So
take the next week to get rid of all that
excessive sleepiness hanging around
from the days of your poor sleep habits
and then come back to Swat ready to
sleep some more.

Future hiring must be

We respect the argument that coverage of a high-profile hiring process
must not harm the relations of candidates with their current home institutions. But the administration moist
respect the role of The Phoenix in disseminating
information to the
Swarthmore College community.
In addition to allowing reporters
access to candidates in future hiring
processes, we believe that the administration should arrange several
events to facilitate students' interest
in candidates. While fireside chats are
good venues for first impressions,
they do not provide students with
opportunities to judge how approachable each candidate is or how he or
she will fill the specific responsibilities of a dean, which should be top
considerations in hiring deans.
First, there must be an opportunity
for those students who-cannot make it
to the fireside chats to get an impression of each candidate. We would be
interested in seeing, for instance, an
introductory video by a candidate

With four high-profile administrators leaving the college to pursue
careers at NYU Abu Dhabi in the last
year, the campus has been forced to
deal with a succession of long, slow
and difficult hiring processes. While
the president position has already
been filled and the new dean of students Liz Braun will take over in July,
the question remains if, how and
when the vacated assistant director of
student life & academic advisor and
the assistant dean & director of the
Black Cultural Center positions will
be filled.
Of the two remaining spots, the
administration has decided not to fill
the position for assistant director of
student life until at least the start of
the 2011-2012 academic year, while discussion on the hiring of a director of
the Black Cultural Center will soon
start. Using our knowledge of the past
processes, the campus is in a unique
position to critique and prepare for
these and all future administrative
hiring decisions.
Although we are happy with the
work of President Chopp so far and
are excited to welcome Dean of

The Phoenix and the Daily Gazette
each agreed to a set of guidelines for
covering fireside chats that would
protect the integrity of the search
process. These included not soliciting
student opinions and limiting circulation to the campus community. But
after both student news sources printed articles on the fireside chat with
Liz Braun, the administration decided
that the media should not cover the
remaining three chats.
Members of the Dean Search
Committee explained that candidates
should feel free to be honest without
fear that their comments would enter
the public record. Since the fireside
chats were the only opportunities for
the vast majority of students to meet
each candidate, many students effectively had no say in the hiring
process. At a time when the administration had made it clear that they
appreciated student input, we believe
telling the press not to cover the fireside chats was a mistake.
Leaders of select student groups

such as dean of students. We are disappointed that The Phoenix and the

POLL OF THE WEEK
If you had the opportunity to design the next hiring process for an
administrator, what would be the first thing you would change?
I would...
A. hold more fireside chats.
B. encourage each candidate to create an introductory video.
C. ask each candidate to host an informal meet and greet.
D. not ask for any student input.
E. not change anything.
F. not be interested in the hiring process.

there isn't a right answer to that question,

None of us saw it the same way, taking

team could only keep one of them. Both of
them would have to be tremendously popular with their home bases, both relatively

Gun to My Head: As "Sophie's Choice"
scenarios go, this one is about as close to a
no-brainer as possible: While Howard has
accumulated unrivaled power numbers in
recent years and has quietly turned into a

solid first baseman, Utley offers the total
package in terms ofpower, average, getting
on base, scoring runs, all while providing
the best defense at second base in the game
by a huge margin.
Another knock against Howard, exposed
to brutal effect in last year's World Series,
is his weakness against the breaking ball.
No one has seen more breaking balls in the
past three years than Ryan Howard, and
after watching him flail on sliders from
C.C. Sabathia and Andy Pettitte en route to
13 strikeouts and a 174 average, that is

unlikely to change anytime soon. While
Phillies fans would be devastated to see
either player go, one of the two has been
mentioned in possible trade scenarios in an
effort to hang on to center fielder Jayson
Werth, and it isn't Utley. If you absolutely
had to keep one, the second baseman is the
clear choice

New York Mets SS Jose Reyes (26) vs. 3B
David Wright (27)

2006-08 Performance Comparison:
Reyes: .292/.355/.461, 47 HR, 354 R, 206 RBI,
10.3 UZR, 117 WAR
Wright: .312/.396/.537, 89 HR, 324 R, 347 RBI,
-11 UZR, 20.4 WAR
Gun To My Head: Just like any argument involving Derek Jeter, this is one
where intangibles have to enter the debate.
In that respect, advantage Reyes. As much
as the Mets missed his offense and speed at
the top of the lineup in 2009 (though not so
much, apparently, that they're not entertaining the idiotic notion of batting him
third this year) when he missed four
months with a calf injury, Reyes's boundless enthusiasm had made him the Mets'
most prominent clubhouse presence from
2006-8, and the team missed that as much as
any measurable value Reyes broughtto the

table. However, there have been those in
the Mets organization who have become
frustrated with what they perceive as a
reluctance on Reyes's part to move away
from the "theatrics"
such as the post
home-run dances he would often lead
and focus more on improving as a player.
While this is all part of the Enthusiasm
Factor that Reyes offers, it also implies that
the Mets should become Wright's team
going forward, and seek to emulate the
third baseman both in his on-field focus as
well as his handling of the media. Wright
saw his power number drop precipitously
in 2009 to the point where the season
seemed aberrational enough to be discounted entirely, which is why I looked at the
2006 2008 performance for both players. In
addition to being the team's de facto leader,
-

Wright has outperformed Reyes offensively,
and although Reyes has proved himself to

the superior defender, does not close the
overall gap in value to the point where he
should be prioritized over his fellow infielder. The 2010 Mets will be lead by David
Wright, and it should stay that way, even at
the (completely hypothetical) cost of Jose
Reyes.

Boston Red Sox IB Kevin Youkilis (31)
vs. 2B Dustin Pedroia (26)

2007-2009 Performance Comparison:
Youkilis: .302/.397/.523, 72 HR, 275 R, 292

RBI, 16.8 UZR (at IB), 15.3 WAR

Pedroia: .313/.375/..462, 40 HR, 319 R, 205 RBI,

23.9 UZR, 15.7WAR

Gun to My Head: This was the toughest
call, even more so than Jeter/Rivera. A phenomenal case can be made for either of
them as both the "soul" of the Red Sox as
well as the team's best player. Pedroia has
hit for a higher average, scored a ton of
runs, played excellent defense at second
base, and goes into 2010 as the best player at
that position not named Utley.
He is also five years younger than
Youkilis, and guarantees Boston elite performance at that position for a long time.
However, in the three full seasons he has
played, his performance has seen its share
of peaks and valleys; there was the horrendous start to his rookie season in 'O7 (from
which he rebounded to win Rookie of the
Year honors) and while his MVP 2008 was
obviously not sustainable, the drop-off in
2009 was a little steeper than some may
have liked (as a Yankee fan, I happened to
be fine with it, but that's just me). Youkilis,
for his part, has lived up to his advance
billing as an on-base force since he joined
the team (his nickname in the minor
leagues was "Greek God of Walks," but has
added a power component to his game that
no one saw coming. In a Boston lineup that
may be lacking in firepower, Youkilis provides middle-of-the-order stability and,
should Boston elect to trade for a big bat a
la Adrian Gonzalez, his defensive versatility (he plays third base nearly as well as
first) makes such a move viable without the
team having to pay a price defensively.
With both players under contract through
at least 2013, this move might actually have
to involve a gun to go through, but if doomsday were to somehow strike
Youkilis has

AROUND COLLEGIATE SPORTS JOURNALISM WM

How the Olympics allow us to flex our patriotism
BY CHARLES LEINEWEBER
THE DAILY BAROMETER, MAR.
3,2010

This weekend marked the
end of the Games of the 21st
Winter Olympiad. Or, as we all
know it, the Winter Olympics
in Vancouver.
The Winter Olympics is a
special time for the snowbound
sports. It's the only time when
figure skating is actually
acceptable,
curling
when
becomes more than just a
drunken Canadian lawn game
and when the majority of the
American population pretends
to care about hockey.
. And with the end of
the 16
day journey through the world
of Scandinavian leisure activities, Americans can go back to
basketball and ignoring the

THE PHOENIX

rest of the NHL season.
But it is bittersweet to see the
Olympics go. Seeing Apolo Ohno
skate past a couple colliding
Koreans for a medal, witnessing
those lovable lugs on the bobsled
team give the U.S. its first gold in

the four man bobsled since the
1940s and sitting down and
watching a whole hockey game
(something I'd never done) stand
as some of the highlights of the
games.

I learned that our neighbors
to the north are little bit different. Maybe it's all the ice or the
socialist health care, but
Canadians seem to be the politest
people in the world.
And they know it.
The Olympics are a time to

flex your nation's power in the
realm of sports, and the host
Canadians wanted to show they

are a player on the world stage.
Adopting the slogan "Own the
Podium" ("pwndium" would be
better), the friendly Canucks
were bent on proving they were
no pushovers.
While they didn't win the
most
overall
medals (go
America), team Canada did collect the most gold medals. And
depending on whom you ask,
winning the most golds is "owning the podium."
Nationalism and patriotism
aren't what they used to be. Back
in the day, ifyou wanted to prove
you were the toughest nation on
the block, you would just pick
some tiny country and beat it up.
I'm looking at you, Prussia. That

method
is
understandably
frowned upon these days. Now,
countries fight for dominance in
athletic contests.

That's
why I
applaud
Canada's efforts to be the best at
their own Olympics. They are
often the butt of jokes (quite
funny ones) and naturally want
to shed that image through
changing their national identity
into that of a country of winners.
Instead of rallying around the
nationalist war cries of centuries
ago, countries of the world rally
around their representative athletes as they aim to bring a medal
home.
In our current state of bitter
partisanship across the country,
it's refreshing to know that we
can all agree to cheer on the
Americans at the Olympics.
Every other year, when the
Summer or Winter Games occur,
beating up on the Swedes and
shaking our fists at the Chinese
brings Americans closer than

any other time throughout the
year. It's hard to find a greater
concentration ofAmerican flags

than at the United States contingent at the Olympics.

We want to be the best there
is, no matter how you feel politically. It's easy to disagree about
domestic issues, but when it
comes to who you want to win in
ice dancing, curling or the fight
in the line for the port-a-potties,
you want your countrymen.
The Olympics is the best time
for patriotism and national pride
in our society. It's the time where
being patriotically hockey is perfectly acceptable and uniting to
be the best in the world is the
goal.

So thank you, Olympics, for
providing a healthy release for
our pent up urge to whoop the
rest of the world in sports.

playing hurt. There are also athletes who
choose to take a leave of absence for family
or personal matters (like Philadelphia's
own Allen Iverson). No athlete in his or her
right mind prefers to miss games, but sometimes, when things like personal health and
the well-being of one's family are at stake,
priority shifts and sports become less
important. Other times, athletes choose not
to play knowing that the missed time will
actually do them good. Think ofKansas City
Royals pitcher Zack Greinke, who took two
months off during the season as a personal
reprieve while he was in the minor leagues.
Think of Serena Williams, who played only
4 tournaments in the entire 2006 season, or
Michael Jordan, who took a break to play
minor league baseball. Think of Andrew
Greenblatt, who's going abroad next semester and will miss the first 7 games ofhis junior season.
When it comes to studying abroad as a
winter sport athlete, the choice is more
complicated than yo'u might think. Since
the winter season spans both the fall and
spring semesters, it is tough to study abroad
without missing a crucial chunk of ths season. Minus rare circumstances and summer
programs, winter sport athletes hitting the
books overseas will either miss their fall
training and non-conference schedule, or
their conference games and potential playoff matchups. I've chosen the former, so I
can play when Swat basketball makes a triumphant run to the playoffs next season.
But this still begs the question, why even
bother going abroad if you consider yourself a serious athlete? Sure, it's a once in a
lifetime experience but so is playing college
hoops, right? I would generally agree, but
from my perspective, I'm not leaving at the
expense of my basketball career, but for the

benefit.
While at Swarthmore the athletes compete at the Division 111 level, and we all compete at the academic genius level so as
Swatties, we're prone to burnout in just the
same way as Zack Greinke or Serena
Williams are. Whether it's a five month long
basketball season wearing you down, or seeing the same one hundred people every day,
or the never ending cycle of problem sets
due Monday, seminar Wednesday, Pub Nite
on Thursday, DU on Saturday, we're all
prone to getting worn out. This week when
I spoke to a bunch of Swatties about their
choice to go abroad some were more subtle
than others that as incredible of an opportunity their program provided them, the
chance to get the hell out of here for a couple of months was more than enough motivation for them to pack their bags.
Here's where Zack Greinke comes in.
Right now, I'm not particularly low on Swat,
or my teammates (who I'll miss terribly) or
my coach, or basketball. However, in
January, with 10 games and 30 practices to
go in the basketball season, when the team
needed me at my best while I felt like crap
and was counting the days until our final

THE PHOENIX

game, I was rock bottom low on everything.
For me, burnout always hits me dead
smack in the middle of the season. Each of
the last two Januaries, I contemplated hanging up the sneakers. Not only does burnout
create a miserable existence, but it doesn't
serve me or my team when we're trying to
get better everyday and win games.
I've decided that the root of the problem
has nothing to do with Swat basketball or
even Swarthmore College. The problem is
Andrew Greenblatt.
When it comes to playing sports, I
believe ignorance is bliss. Unfortunately, I
do not possess ignorance, so you can kiss
the bliss goodbye. I suffer from "think-toomuch" disease. A prognosis that results
from two things: a ridiculous desire to
improve and a tenacious work ethic to provide me with every opportunity to so do.
Put simply, I put everything at stake when
it comes to my sport. Basketball has been
my life, so this season, when I worked twice
as hard over the summer to play half the
minutes, it crushed me. I'm talking some
serious despair here, like world crumbling
around me, taking basketball way too seriously despair where doing homework and
learning in class became impossible and my
family would get off the phone with me worried about my misery.
It took two seasons of this kind of disappointment for me to realize that not only
was basketball slowly killing me, and that
at this rate there was literally zero chance
of me playing for four years, but that my

college basketball experience was not a
healthy one and I was missing a ton of
opportunities while my life was consumed
by hoops.
Enter study abroad: the great escape, the
calculated break. Each of the past two years
I've entered the season in the best shape of
my life, both physically and mentally. I'd
leave the season out of shape from sitting on
the bench with a seriously bruised ego and
feeling that I had to go back to square one.
This year, when I come back from abroad,
during the meat of our conference schedule,
it will be as ifI came back from summer. I'll
be in the best shape of my life, both physically and mentally, re-energized about the
game of basketball, burnout free and ready
to contribute.
No one says I have to come back out of
shape; I argue that I'll come back in even
better shape. I'll be mentally refreshed, with
a newfound appreciation for what
Swarthmore has to offer after a seven
month hiatus. Instead of holding the team
back with a bad attitude (as much as I tried
to hide it), I'll be pushing our team to the
limits, infusing our practices with endless
hustle and ridiculous spirit that can only
come from someone so fresh and so ready to
play, someone hungry from being away
from the game. Yes, I'll have to fight off
freshmen for playing time, even though I'll
be an upperclassmen. But so what? When
have I not had to fight for every minute of
playing time I've received? Yes, I won't be in
touch with all of the team's inside jokes. But

so what? If you haven't noticed, I'm a pretty
funny guy, I think being late on a few jokes
won't kill me. Yes, I'll miss seven games.
But so what? Zack Greinke came back and
won the AL Cy Young award, Serena
Williams, deemed "out of shape" won the
Australian Open in her first tournament
back, and MJ won three more championships after his break. For Andrew
Greenblatt? Only time will tell, but never
underestimate the power of some well spent
time away and the undying will of a committed athlete.

Travis Pollen recently set the American Paralympic record in the 100-year freestyle
with a time of 54.80 seconds.
Casmera Wick described the moment:
"I just looked over at [head coach Sue
Davis] and said 'He did it! He did it!' I
was jumping up and down and was
pretty pumped, and all of his teammates were giving him a big hug and
lifting him up the ground."
Throughout his first two years at
Swarthmore, Pollen has made a strong
impact on all of his teammates and
coaches through his love of swimming.
"His contributions in practice and in
terms of team chemistry are pretty
much unmatched. He always has a
positive attitude and is never slacking.
He's a teammate that really knows how
to push his teammates and bring the
best out of everyone," Satterfield said.
"Seeing him here every day, always

the team," said Wick. "As far as outside of the pool, he's really a great guy.
He's always positive and never complaining. I think that really spreads
around to everyone else."
When Pollen broke the 100-free
record, his teammates couldn't have
been happier for him. "It had to mean
the world to him and the team was 100
percent behind him. I've never seen a
team cheer so loud for a single swimmer in all of my life," Satterfield
added.
Having broken the six-year-old
record, Travis Pollen will next compete at the United States Spring
