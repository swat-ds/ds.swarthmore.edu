"75% of Americans do not know their neighbors..."

McKibben gives second
all-campus Collection
By Eli Rubin

Bill McKibben, a well known
environmentalist and writer, lectured on "Desire and Nature" at the
first Collection of the year, Tuesday, September 21, in the Lang
Performing Arts Center. The lecture was the second in what the
college hopes will become an annual tradition of "all-campus Collections." Bill Cosby's talk last
year in the Scott Outdoor Auditorium was the first such event in
recent years.
McKibben's address was centered on his belief that, due to the
advent of televisionand the information age, humans are losing
touch withtheirtrue desires and are
instead engaged in the pursuit of
"false desires."
"What is it that we really
want?" McKibben asked the audience. He explained that the reason
that the television sitcom Cheers
has been so popular is that it offers
viewers a sense of community.
"Where everybody knows your
name," said McKibben. "But in
reality, nobody on Cheers really
does know your name...we don't
go out to bars now; we just watch
them on TV."
AnotherfocusofMcKibben's
speech was the human obsession
with the mass media and technologyand theresulting "humanocentric" view of the world, which has
furthered an impending ecological
crisis. "We tend to focus only on
our own human stories, and forget
about nature," McKibben said after the lecture.
McKibben, who wrote for the
New Yorker magazine for 5 years,
became well known for his 1987
book, The End ofNature, in which
he drew attention to the gravedanger whichhefeltfaced the environment. His latest book, The Age of
Missing Information, which was
published last year, focuses on the
issue of how the information age
ignores crucial pieces of our lives
and draws us towards certain false
desires which cannot make us truly
happy.
Focusing on this theme, he
cited a University ofChicago study
from the 1970's in which several
people were fitted withbeepers and
then beeped at random times of the
day, at which point they were to
write down what they were doing
and how they feIL Most of thetime
when the subjects were watching
TV they reported not feeling particularly happy.
"Our search for happiness is
oftenparadoxical," saidMcKibben
to a group of students later in the
evening. "Oftentimes, the things
we think make us happiest don't,
and what we would not think we
wouldenjoy doing oftendoes make
ushappy." McKibbenrecalledrunning a homeless shelter, and the
very disagreeable duties associated
withsuch a task, but then explained
how, surprisingly, he found the job
deeply satisfying.
McKibben expressed great
concern over the fact that technol-

ogy has reduced our reliance on
neighbors and has eroded oursense
of traditionand community. "75%
of Americans do not know their
neighbors...and one of the reasons
suburbs are all made the same is so
people can easily move from one
place to another and never miss the
place they left." McKibben also
mentioned the pleasure ofknowing
"one spot real well" and how it is a
vanishing trend for many.
McKibben believes that the
trends of "false desires" threaten
other nations as well as our own.
"Our idea oflife as represented in
movies and TV goes out every day
around the world with incredible
impact," said McKibben. He feels
that other countries desire the same
kind of luxury that they see on
American TV and in American
movies and magazines, and do not
realize that in doing so, they are
losing touch with theirenvironment
and the customs which held their
culture together for so long.
"There was recently a community on the Ivory Coast, which had
always drunk alcohol during rituals, as a communal event, from the
same bowl. Once Heineken began
advertising and selling to these
people, eachperson wantedto have
their own bottle, and soon the community began to disintegrate."
Although his newest book focuses on the theme of the mass media and diminishing cultureand community, and not as much on the
subject of ecological disaster, he
reserved someroom in his lecture to
speak on the topic of the environment.

"Global warming is the greatest threat to earth," he said, following this statement with a discussion

of themany grim consequences that
a rise in the global temperature
would produce. Linking global
warming to the significant rise in
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,
he went back to the topic of other
cultures.
"Chinaholdshalfof theworld's
coal reserves. Ifthey choose to start
burning that coal, they can double
the amount of carbon dioxide in the
air by themselves. It won't matter if
every American rides a bike everywhere and keeps the thermostat at
40 degrees. We won't be able to
stop it. And the thing is, the Chinese
economy is growing by ten percent
a year, and soon it will be consuming that coal in large quantities."
Later that night at an informal
discussion with seven to ten students and Associate Provost Mark
Jacobs, who invited and introduced
McKibben, McKibben further explained the link between finding
one's true desires and getting further in touch with nature. "If one
looks for the divine in the world, it
is best to look at the natural world
and unselfishhuman love. Not everyone is in a position to get both or
one or the other. But onereason we
have suchpoor information in this
society is that we have so little contact with the natural world. We
forget there is something beyond us
and our stories."

Kuttner urges renewed activism
By Mark Kernighan
Robert Kuttner, a well-known
political journalist,greeted a packed
audience on Thursday night with
the first of six lectures in a series,
"The Politics of Possibility," sponsored by the Political Science Department Kuttner gave a mixed review ofClinton's Presidency, lauding him as "as smart as we've ever
had in the Oval Office," but also
attacking his administration as "incoherent" and "schizophrenic" for
making too many concessions to
conservatives and special interests.
Kuttner argued that Clinton
should start by concentrating on his
"core values" instead of making
deals. He added, "He can ring our
chimes when he talks about ideo-

logical themes, but he has to deliver
the goods."
Kuttner implied that Clinton,
who won the election mainly by
addressing voters' fears about the

economy, would stand or fall on
"whether he is or is not the pocketbook champion of people living
from paycheck to paycheck." He

Rebuilding the polity

A Phoenix interview with Robert Kuttner
By Andy Pen-in
Robert Kuttner and some colleagues startedTheAmerican Prospect, the policy journal that some
have called the intellectual background for the Clinton administration, in the middle of the Bush administration.
"I felt that conservatives were
winning thebattle of ideas," he told

The Phoenix afterhis lecture. "And
I think ideas matter."
The very founding of the journal, according to Kuttner, was a
political event. The founding editors were trying to "reclaim the idea

Vuksan, Nichols awarded
Wallenberg scholarship
By Erik Huneke
For the first time since the award was created in 1986, two Swarthmore students have succeeded in
receiving theprestigious Wallenberg scholarship, which isawarded to only ten American college graduates each
year. Mario Vuksan '93 and Catherine Ann Nichols '93, therecipients of the award, are now participating in
a special graduate program at theHebrew University in Jerusalem. They are joinedby Sara Koplik '93 of Bryn
Mawr and JonathanLawrence '93 ofHaverford as well as six other students from Harvard, Yale, Georgetown,
and SUNY Albany and two Israeli graduate students.
This scholarship was created in honor ofRaoul Wallenberg, a Christian Swedish diplomat who risked his
own life to rescue Jews from the Nazis. The scholarship covers the cost of tuitionfor one year as well as such
incidental expenses as airfare.
The program begins with an orientation in this country and then an intensive seven-week course in Hebrew
called Ulpan that takes place in Israel. The actual course of study is unique; it consists of a variety of English
seminars on such topics as "Democracy and Leadership" and "IsraeliSociety" and a tutorial in thestudent'sfield
of concentration.
The students also continue to study Hebrew while meeting with Israeli leaders, completing an internship,
and culminating the year with a group project (such as organizing a conference).
The committee seeks scholars from a wide variety of backgrounds who have achieved high standards of
academic excellence and who are also, in the words ofPublic Relations Office directorLorna Shurkin, "socially
responsible, interested in social and political change" and capable of leadership.
Nichols, a Eugene M. Lang Scholar, received a B. A. with a major in sociology and anthropology, a minor
inpolitical science, and a concentration in women's studies. Among her many community service activities was
a project in which she used her Spanish and other skills to monitor health and environmental organizations
located near the border between the United States and Mexico. She was also co-founder of a club designed to
increase the level of cross-cultural understanding among students at Swarthmore.
Vuksan graduated with a B.A. in mathematics and art history. While at Swarthmore, he was very active in
raising awareness of the crisis taking place in the region of the former Yugoslavia. He wrote a particularly
compelling article that appeared in the alumni magazine and organized a music group called the Croatian
Liberation Front, which donated the proceeds of its numerous performances to help refugees and others in his
native Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. His group's name appeared on the Top 10 lists of Croatian radio
stations and his music did much to lift the morale of a besieged nation.

Bill McKibben, the biologist who spoke
in the PAC on Tuesday, represents the beginning of what Swarthmore hopes will be a
tradition of annual, all-campus collections.
As one professor described the idea, these
lectures would form a unifying themearound
which much of the campus's debate and discussion would focus.
In this week's column I want to talk
about some of the issues surrounding theidea
of a unifying theme defined by the administration, and I also want to discuss McKibben's
lecture itself. As I hope will become clear, I
think the ideas behind the collection in general and McKibben's lecture inparticular are
similar and possibly similarly misguided.
Ever since I've been at Swarthmore,
various people have decried the decline of a
sense of community here. It has always
seemed to me that the search for community
was both chimerical and conservative.
Swarthmore's idea of community is chimerical because community
at least as it's
assumes
usually defined at Swarthmore
that the interests, backgrounds, and identities
ofcommunity members are more similar than
different Itis conservativebecause theactive
search for community specifically tries to
force an increasingly diverse population to
look for similarity.
What is the alternative? There are two
sides to it. The fust is the trend that some
administrators have decried: multiple small
events and groups meeting and discussing
issues on their own rather than in connection
withothers. By themselves, these groupsand
events are not a problem; it is a mistake to try
to define in what issues and what lectures the
entirecampus shouldbe interested. I fear that
the annual collection has been conceived in
such a restrictive spirit
The second part of my alternative to
community happens when those small groups
get together and compare notes on issues and
ideasof common interest Itis in thatveinthat
an annual, "all-college" event can be useful.
Discussing what will likely be wildly different approaches to speakers and other events
will buildthekind of intellectualand personal
without the
exchange we are looking for
homogenizing effects of the search for community.
That said, let me move to McKibben's
talk itself. For those who were not there, I
will give my (admittedly biased) summary
.

The lecture started with a discussion of
modern life to be fair, we 'll have to define
it as modern American life in the middle and
upper classesâ€”and, in particular, television.
Television, said McKibben, alienatesits viewers because it is not "deeply satisfying." It is
less culturally validbecause the single artistic
creator is replaced by a team of writers and
scores ofaudience members judging thecopy
before it gets filmed.
McKibben connects the alienating effects of our TV culture with humanity's (as he
sees it) damaging effects on "nature." He
called on theaudience to help changepeople's
desires
which have been, for him, artificially redirected by television so they are
less hostile to the environment.
Managing desire? Excuse me, but that's
areally dangerous concept. The management
of people's desire has been the goal ofevery
totalitarianmovementand government in history. To entrust anyone with the ability to
define the acceptable boundaries of human
desire is to engage in the worst kind of imperialism: "my wayis appropriate, yours is not'
is simply not the path to a responsible politics,
For Bill McKibben to be "deeply dissatisfied" when watching television is of course
no problem; for him to deign to assess the
level of satisfaction of therest of humanity is
arrogant and dangerous.
Now, McKibben'sresponse is clear: the
impending destruction of the planet is such a
serious concern that it justifiesotherwise unacceptable breaches of human freedom and
diversity. But it is always the case that those
who woulddefine the appropriate boundaries
of human action do so in the name of what
appears to be an overwhelming need: order,
peace, stability, economic growth, and now
the health of the planet.
My point is this: a convincing argument
that global warming is bad need not lead to a
conclusion that totalitarian tendencies are
acceptable in the circumstances. A solution
to the environmental crisis must be found that
does not compromise the full diversity and
desire of the world's population.
So how are these two issues related? In
both cases, experts (Swarthmore's administration and Bill McKibben) have constructed
a unifying, all-encompassingproblem (building community and averting an environmental crisis, respectively). And in both cases, the
solutions they propose seek to boost homogeneity by unifying theirpopulations for a common goal. Both cases, in theirstandard forms,
shouldbe regarded with extreme suspicion.

Follow up

I hope issues I bring up in this column get addressed through various channels and that
people respond. Long, specific responses belong in the Opinion section but simple
clarifications will be printed in this space. The following came from outgoing Dean of
Admissions Robert Barn
"I agree with you about the importance of wide-ranging input into searches for
significant appointments. The Director of Minority Recruitment (Gloria Thomas Walker's
former position) is such an appointment.... When Gloriaannounced last spring that she would
be leaving, I was anxious to make a temporary appointment thatwould leaveCarl Wartenburg,
as theDean designate, free to makehis own decision about the futureof theposition.... Yvette
[Dennis] may or may not decide to become a candidate for continuation but I am confident
that there will be an opensearchprocess in theSpring that will follow our normal practice...."

continued to say that social issues and alliances with left-wing activists are often forgotten as mild conservatives judge a President by his economic success: "Ifunemployment is 3 percent, nobody cares much if you
have a few strange friends.'*
Kuttner said that Clinton needs a single
"emblematic issue of the administration," and
that thehealthcare program might well"make
or break the Clinton Presidency," as well as
the larger movement to restore the social
contract system.
Clinton's address on health careWednesday night left him
optimistic: "If I had
given this lecture a
week ago, it would
have been much
more downbeat"As
for Clinton's overall performance,
"the jury is still out."
Despite
Clinton's heroic
ability to "come
back from the dead"
(he has been compared to a Ferris wheel), he took heavy criticism forvacillating. "Clintonis not quite sure
what he is,"Kuttner said twice. He explained
that after being unseated as Governor for
being too liberal, Clinton learnedhow to trade
consistency for popularity. He used Clinton's
attempts to keep both the "NAFTA coalition"
(mainly a Republican invention) and the
"health-care coalition" as an example of this
trade. Kuttner said he admired Richard
Gephardt'sspeech againstNAFTA last week,
and that there is still time to dump the costly
NAFTA alliance.
Kuttner ridiculed the incongruous mix
of left-wingers such as Laura D. Tyson and
people like Lloyd Bentsen ("the most conservativeDemocrat in the Senate") in the Cabinet. Healso said that Clinton rightly suffered
for giving "populism a back seat to symbolism" in theZoe Baird incident The choice of
Baird instead of a more ardent feminist left

the administration unable to rally support
when conflicts arose.
Kuttner also said Clinton had changed
since the campaign. After winning the election by promising job growth without a tax
burden on the middle class, Clinton was set
back by a filibuster against his original budget
and was then "born again as a deficit hawk."
Kuttner claimed that deficit relief was becoming a black hole, and encouraged Clinton
to focus on social programs instead, such as
child care and urban reconstruction.
According to Kuttner, the Democratic
Leadership Council, the more conservative
branch of the party, advised Clinton to win

Safer Sex dorm workshops
reach all first-year students
By Elizabeth Bramson

Already this year, thecollege's SaferSex Workshops havebeen conductedfor allfirstyear students. Co-coordinators Sarah Adams '94 and Petra Janopaul *94 planned the
workshops for the first two weeks of the semester, rather than in the spring, when the
workshops have taken place in past years. "We felt that conducting [the workshops] in the
spring was too late," Janopaul explained. "After all, students come to college, andboom!
[they] start having sex. So while it might bealot to handleat once, wefelt it was necessary."
The Safer Sex Workshops are run by students who have gone through extensive
training in both facilitation skills and the facts of safer sex. This year, according to Seth
Brenzel '94, in his second semester of Safer Sex facilitating, there was "a stronger core of
facilitators and a lot more enthusiasm."
Together with their hallmates, first-year students were taught the relative risks
involved in a continuum of sexual acts, andâ€”emphasized in the movieâ€”how to use a
condom, how to make and usea dental dam, and which lubricants are safe. In addition, they
learned how to negotiate and communicate with a partner through role-playing, something
thefacilitators feel cannot be overemphasized. "They need to be able to communicatewith
the person they are having sex with, or everything else they've learned is pointless," said
Janopaul. Finally, they left with 'party bags* full of safe-sex accessories.
New in theprogram is the Safer Sex video, completed last year under the guidance of
Professor Alex Juhasz. "We had been using clips from other people's videos," said
Janopaul, "but this video is really good because it's specific to Swarthraore. We deal with
things like drinking on campus and the whole hook-up scene." Many first-year students
found the nudity and forthright discussionsof homosexuality "explicit and graphic," citing
sections showing a man's penis and a woman putting on a dental dam. To those students
shocked by the video, Brenzel responded that the facilitators are often corning
a
different perspective," one which has become accustomed to frank discussions of both
heterosexuality and homosexualityâ€”often not the case for first-year students.
Adams added, in defense ofthe explicit nature of the video, "If people are going to be
comfortable with sex, they need to be comfortable with all of those body parts." At least
one first-year student recognized the film's relevance; "Well, it's reality, right?" Another
first-year student added: "It hit hard but seemed like something freshmen need."
The workshops revolve around an underlying core philosophy which is, according to
Adams and Janopaul, "fundamentally anti-scare and sex-positive." Neither the workshop
nor thevideo offers adjust say no* approach. "We assume sex and encourage you to take
the informationand create your own safer sex philosophy."
To many first-yearstudents, thismay be an overwhelming introduction to college, which
is something thecoordinatorsrealize: "We're giving them a lotofknowledge and no shelves
to put it on." Still, while it might seem like trial by fire for many first-years, Adams and
Janopaul are satisfied with the lessons thathave been taught. "Now we know that the entire
freshman class has learned about safer sex. That's not common at other schools."

Assault investigation continues
Administration is working on charges against student
By Andy Perrin
Swarthmore's investigation into an alleged sexual assault the first weekend of
classes continues, and Dean Ngina Lythcott
is pleased that "students are coming forward" with information.
So far, saidLythcott, students who have
come forward have largely confirmed information of which the dean's office was already aware.
Asked why previous allegations of
sexual assault on campus had received less
administrative attention than this one,
Lythcott explained, "I don't think I was
here" when the other cases came up. "I take
thisform ofmisbehavior as being extremely
serious."
Lythcott sent an e-mail message to all
students last Thursday, informing them of
the investigation and thefacts ofthe case that
could be released. Some students found the
message helpful, while, for others, it confirmed the fears of personal attack on campus.
Some students, Lythcott found, have
been startled to find that"sexual misconduct
can happen at Swarthmore too."
An open meeting Lythcott held with
interested students attracted more students
than she expected. The gender breakdownof
the attendance also surprised her; "I think
there were more men than women there."
President Al Bloom told The Phoenix
that"it is imperative that if there is evidence
of sexualmisconduct the college take action
in order to be a community that livesup to its
core principle of mutual human respect....

however, in the absence of a complaint, and
as long as we do not have substantive evidence that misconduct took place, the college
cannot

act"

Still, "even in the absence of an accusation from an individual who may have been
the victim of sexual misconduct, if the college has substantial reason to believe that the
event took place the college must act to
defend the values of its community. But in
this case as yet we do not have... the evidence
that we would need to take action on our

own."
Lythcott, however, remained optimistic
that the necessary evidence would be collected. She suggested that the rare college
action of bringing a charge against its own
student would say to the student, "Evidence
suggests that youhave violateda major value"
ofSwarthmore and the college feels the evidence merits a formal charge.
Although the alleged victim has elected
not to bring her own charges against the
assailant, Lythcott said she has "not offered
the option" of having the college's own investigation stopped.
"I don't think that we would feel comfortable stopping" the case, she said. She
added that every measure has been taken to
ensure the victim's privacy.
The rumors on campus about the case
have largely died down, and Lythcott expressed the hope that future information will
come from thedean's office and not through
the rumor mill. She again urged any students
with information about the case to come to
herorDeanTedd Goundie, or to Bryn Mawr's
Dean, Karen Tidmarsh.

Clinton must rebuild confidence

Kuttner maintains that the journal has not
lost its critical bent.
TheAmerican Prospect has always valuedopen debate, he said, and thatbasic tenet
has not changed with the change in administrations. Kuttner felt that "the currency of
discourse [during the Reagan and Bush administrations] was cynicism" and the journal
wanted to get beyond that The goal of the

American Prospect is central are high, says
Kuttner. He points to declining voter turnout; "society is healthier when people participate in politics," and the low turnout
signals a danger to American democracy.

"There are things that only the public
do," claimedKuttner. And public
confidence in government is necessary to do
those things. "Even if those services are contractedout,"he pointed out, "somebody needs
to keep the contractors honest."
The United States faces an interesting
challenge, he said, because in the 19th century the electorate was relatively homogeneous: "a nation of free farmers." It was

The new challenge is to reform that

"It's not very comfortable to live in a society

is to meet that challenge.

Was there anything more polarizingfor American society than the 1980s? Consider a decade
without any middle orcommon ground; where differences were accentuated, if only so that the rich
could get richer and the poor...well, you know how
thatgoes. This, ofcourse, does not apply strictly to
America's political climate. In fact, almostallfacets
ofAmerican life during the Reagan/Bush era adhered to this same philosophy of separationâ€”even
music.
It is amazing how much the music we listen to
can reflect upon the general mood of our country.
Consider,for instance, thepolarizing attitudes many
Americans have concerning contemporaryforms of
rock and rap music. In one corner there is rock (namely alternative and heavy metal), a
grudgingly accepted symbol ofyoung,rebellious, and definitely white America. And in the
other corner there is rap, the equally rebellious and, at times, destructive music stylizec
predominantly by young black males. Never, it has been said, could these two forms of
imaginative, yet troubledmusic come together. The soundtrackfor thesoon-to-bereleasee
movie JudgmentNight, however, exposes these claims for the myths they are.
Imagine an album in which PearlJam collaborates with Cypress Hill, and Teenage
Fanclub mixes itup withDeLaSoul.Sounds odd? Perhaps even like trespassing? Actually,
it's transcending the stigmas andfalse borders we asAmericans have constructed arounc
nearly allfacets of our cultural identity.
These stigmas are merely another form ofAmerican (and cultural) disunity. Black
music, white music, and so on. I [lhsan] too subscribed to these categories ofmusical (one
again, cultural) division and separatism not long ago-most ofthe 80's in fact. Like rock &
roll whichpreceded it, alternative rock andrap cannot claimcreative or cultural autonomy.
On the contrary, rock and rap artistsand the like shouldstrive to avoid creative isolation.
Itwos not relative isolation that led to the birth ofrock & roll, jazz, and othermusic forms.
The more cultural variation in our reality we are exposed to, the greater our capacity
for compassion and understanding. Toput it more scientifically, the amount and variety of
stimulationwe receive is "instrumental" in determining our ability to adapt. Like it or not,
the realization (and hopefully embracing) ofAmericas cultural hybridity is underway.
Multiculturalmusic?
Okay, so polarized cultures collide indeed. What does this all mean? What is the
product? Some might say thatthe result is something new a much needed redefinition of
sorts. If this is gained, then what is lost? Is loss, in fact, inevitable? Rap,for example, is
said to posit the voice ofthe black youth. Can rap maintain thisfunction when integrated,
orrather infiltrated, some might argue, with variousforms ofrock music? We believe it can

Article uses sexist double-standard
To the Editor
We would like to express our alarm and
regret over the article "Get some hygiene,
men!"which was printed in theSeptember 17
issue ofThePhoenix. The article is sexist and
irresponsible, and asserts a double standard
which has arisen in reaction to stereotypes
against women. There is a belief that antiwomanstereotypes are sexist, whileanti-man
stereotypes are empowering. In no context
does "anti-man" equate with "pro-woman."
And that's exactly what we have hereâ€” an
anti-manarticle that gets twisted in an attempt
at dark humor and political profundity.
The seriousnessof thisarticle was brought
to our attention when we met a man who was
infuriated to the point of publicly screaming
obscenities about women. When we confronted him, his angry response was, "Did
you read the Phoenix article this morning?!"
Though this is not a valid justificationfor his
offensive language, it indicates the possible

consequences of the abuse of free speech.
Inflammatory writings only serve to increase the alienation between women and
men on this campus, which is already so
intense that the administration is currently
seeking a Gender Concerns Advocate to
handle it Incidents like this demonstrate that
whentheright offree speech is used irresponsibly, people get hurt. And when people get
hurt, people get angry.The Swarthmore community is already burdened with misunderstanding and animosity. Material like this is
justfuel for the fire.Leave it at the door, okay?
We feel the need, as women, to apologize for what has been written. And the fact
that we have been falsely represented makes
us resentful. We and other women do not
share the opinions expressed.

Alas, the strange element of this anger is
that one article in a fish-rap of a school paper,
which ordinarily provides neither insight nor

deceit, theft, sexual assault (ahem), and nervous breakdowns run rampant Still, our
commentary has drawnup high tensions and
emotions worthy of a Swat B+. (Although not

The fact remainsâ€” there is only one
reason for this: Swatties love to complain.

We've made an art form out ofit. Just look at

s/he's too boring, if the party had a good DJ,
there wasn't enough beer, and we can go on.
We only fill a void in the dinnerconversation.
Where elsehaveyou heard the term "bitter" as

first time you ever used "bitter" to describe
yourself. It was probably at Swat and in
reference to a member of the opposite sex.

What's this? Swarthmore College is
now a non-smoking campus? Are there no
protests beyond a smoke-in? Let us take a
deeper look and see what sort of tyranny this
forebodes.
I was goinghappily along withmy deathfilled life and cancer-filled lungs and just

for my lifestyle.
An overweight man who begins each
day with a cup of cappuccino has now forbidden smoking because he's concerned about
my health! You know, I didmy eighth grade

and cappuccino, respectively) on the heart

you know what the results were? In individual test groups, small doses of both substances caused their microscopic little hearts
to beat faster and faster until they just exploded. That's right, exploded. Al Bloom,
whose name anagrams so easily to All Boom,
is concerned about my health? I think white

have done much better to pass this non-smoking law under the guise of safety concerns:

Swarthmore is one of the most flammable
campuses in America and smoking is more of
a fire hazard than anything else. The college
owns its buildings; it does not own its students.
Is this guy multicultural at all? Does he

tradition? He claims to have traveled extensively in the East; did he never come across

he unaware of Latin and South American

elitism he's foisted on usâ€” even European

NAFTA: No Americans For Trade Anymore?
By Andrew Feldman
The North American Free Trade Agree-

ment (NAFTA) seems as popular these days
as the movement to outlaw weekends. Its

prospects for passage in Congress dwindled
last week when Ross Perot tookhis tirade on
free trade to prime time. One of the highlights
of his Tonight Show appearance was the
picture he showed ofMexican villagers living
in cardboard shacks. That would be us if
NAFTA passes, he said. After hearing that, I
could understand why Perot devotees are
against the trade agreement. After all,
Hallowell ain't the top of the Hyatt, but I sure
don't want to move into something cardboard. Perot's argument sounds convincing,
but I wonder is there any evidence that the
Boss is wrong?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Every major economic
study on NAFTA disagrees with Perot'sprotectionist demagoguery. And this week 300
economistsranging from MiltonFriedman to
Paul Samuelson signed a letter to Clinton
supporting the agreement. As The New York
Times writes, "When economists of every
stripe agree on anything, itis noteworthy." It's
also noteworthy, however, that these economists are among arare breed who support the
agreement. There are two questions which I
think are crucial to the NAFTA debate but
have been overshadowed by political hyperbole. First and most importantly, what do the
credible economic studies on NAFTA conclude? Second, why are so many people in the
U.S. against freer trade? I would like to conclude with my own calculation: will NAFTA
pass?
The consensus among economists is that
NAFTA will have a small positive impact on
the U.S. withmuch larger benefitsfor Mexico.
(Because we already have a trade agreement
with Canada, I would like to focus on
NAFTA's effects on the U.S. and Mexico.)
The main reason NAFTA's impact on the
U.S. will be small is that Mexico's economy
is small. Their gross domestic product is
about 4% thesize of ours, or equivalent to the
G.D.P. of Los Angeles. In other words,
NAFTA causing economic collapse in this
country is as unlikely as it being a panacea for
our weak economy. But it is a positive start
Economists differ in theircalculations of
exact net gains or losses in employment for
each country, but they agree the numbers will
be small. This is because razing tradebarriers,
in the long run, redistributes jobs rather than
creating or destroying them. Inefficient and
uncompetitive industries in the U.S. (mostly
manual labor jobs) now kept alive by tariffs
and subsidies would not be able to stay in
business. Even without NAFTA, however,

concern about Ihe recent appointment of a

Dean ofMulticultural Affairsandabout the
future of multiculturalism at Swarthmore
College.

We, as members of the Asian American,
Black,LatirKVa,Gay,Lesbian,andÃŸisexual
communities, are angry that we were not at

least consulted or notified in a formal way.
In addition, we feel that the creation of a
position without a coherent job description
isridiculous. The continuous absence of a
description, compounded with our feelings
of exclusion, leaves us angry and confused
about thedirectionthat theadmimstrationis
taking inregards toraultiadturalisrxfc
The lack of communicationbetween

derscores much of our frustration with the
advocacy of multiculturalism at
Swarthmore. At present there is still no

rangementisinherently disempowering and serves

groups have been excluded We believe that
multiculturalism should work to empower,pre-

venting this type ofexclusion.
No formal definition for multiculturalism
has been developed, but already, we see dangerous patterns fbnning in the way the Dean's position is being structured. According to conversations with individual administrators, we understandthatanyone whoisnot a whiteheterosexual
male will be underthe direction ofthis Dean We

beÃŸevethatwiththisdefinition

which excludes white straight males, the college
is creating a non-white, non-heterosexual,
milkshake to be consumedby the largercommunity. This definitiontherefore has disturbing implications and is unacceptable.
We define multiculturalism as a political
process which considers the way factors ofculture, for instance differences inracial and ethnic
background, gender, sexual orientation, or class,
relate within a white male heterosexual power
structure. In order to change this power structure,
we mustdismiss the notion mat ihewhite, straight
maleis not involved intheprocess ofdefining and
executing raultiadturalism. We refuse to continuetakingon theburdenofcreatingccoifbrtable
spaces for educating the straight white community. Everyone must be equally invested in this
dialogue; at the same time, wemustnotreproduce
present power dynamics.

In the same way, there arc dialogues within
our groups dial are not acknowledged by the
milkshake model. Although it is ridiculous to
create a hierarchy of oppressions, we do realize
and emphasize that in different contexts, with
different people, some aspects of our culture are
more prominent thanothers. In other words, we,
as "marginalized peoples," continuously deal
withissues ofoUfference with
within our coalitions.
The milkshake model, supported by the
Dean's position, simplifies powerand difference
into a binary of White Straight Male versus
Others. Here, differences within groups are ignored Moreover, individual groupslose separate
identities in the minds of the larger community,
becoming some homogeneous, "multicultural"
endty.Thisbpardculatiy dangerous whenawareness ofdifferences andattention to groups' needs
and resources are reallocated to reflect this homogenization. Multiculturalism is not about us
fighting for small pieces of the dominant power
structure'spie. Instead, itis aboutrecognizing and
fulfilling our individual needs as distinctgroups.
We therefore reject this model and call for the
administration to redirect its resources towards
the understanding of the different relationsrups
between various groups in this community.
It is time for S warthmoreto commit itself to
a definitionof multiculturalism which addresses
issues of power. The Dean ofMulticultural Af-

fairs position, if supported by a sincere
commitment for change, is one of many
possible arenas for this new direction.
Multieulfliralism has been discussed on
levels of abstractionfor too long. It is time
toacknowledge thereality ofreal peoplestudents, staff, and facultyâ€”and real actions.
We propose that a committee, including students from SASS, SASA, SAO,

training session geared to the specific needs
of its volunteers. To provide continued support throughout the semester, there will be on
going follow-up training sessions that will
cover a wide variety of topics and forms.
These on-going sessions will address the
concerns or needs of the volunteers.
4) The final change this year is the new
policy that first-year students begin volunteering through CIVIC in the Spring semester rather than the Fall. Burnout and overcommitment have been large problems in
past years. We hope that in allowing firstyear students to accustom themselves to the
time requirements of college before they
commit to volunteering, we can avoid these
problems. We also want students to know a
little about the programs before they commit
to volunteering. Therefore, we will have
tours of the programs towards the endof this
semester. CIVIC will provide training for
first-year students at the beginning of next

Gergen: re-writing education
By Stacy Nakell
When Kenneth Gergen describes his

courses, he uses two important words: unusual and non-traditional. Gergen has been
a psychology professor at Swarthmore for
twenty-five years, and he is now working to
usher thecollege into a new age, introducing
new and provocative ways of learning.
His modern wayof looking at the world
is classified as constructivism. It breaks
from a more traditional view, whichlooks at
knowledge of an individual, to view knowledge as a product ofhuman beings in communication, which is created by communities. The new focus shifts from an outlook
of one right way of looking at the world to
one of multiple ways ofknowledge, which
are all intertwined.
Work under this theory is occurring in
many departments of the college. Gergen is
focusing on implementing the new ideas in
hisclassroom and through his teaching methods. Because he believes that all types of
knowledge are related, Gergentries to break
down barriers between the departments. "I
try to interweave different texts... my students will read some history, some anthropology, some psychology books. It doesn't
have to be a certain kind of book to be
taught"
In addition, Gergen is critical of the
high language form which has developed at
colleges such as Swarthmore, which sets the
college up as an academic institution far
removedfrom therealities oflife. "At school
we teach you to write like us, but we are
incapable of speaking to anyone but ourselves. This abstract, formal language worries me; we set our language up as 'the
finest' but it reduces the possibility that we
can affect the society." Gergen attempts to
break down this language, through encouraging students to write in different modes

than those they have been trained in, as well as
stressing the importance of visual media to
cross communication borders.
Gergen works on these ideas outside of
the classroom as well. His mostnotable recent
activity was a trip to Argentina on a Fulbright
Fellowship, where he attempted to start dialogues between various groups, focusing on
family therapy, community organizing, and on
forging connections between businesses and
the communities surrounding them. He found
that once people tried to find a common language, they began to work out differences.
Gergenfinds that the openness to different modesof expression in the classroom helps
students to express themselves. "Insteadof me
saying 'Here, I*ll show you what I read in a
book,' we have dialogues in which neither of
us can predict the outcome," Gergen notes.
Some students take the

with Russian composers and to lecture on
contemporary American music. Two
Swarthmore musicians will also be accompanying the orchestra on the trip. Darren Gage
'94 andZach Maupin '93 will contribute their
talents to the music making.
To finance this trip, there will be a benefit concert for the orchestra held at

Swarthmore on Thursday, September 30, at
8 p.m. in Lang Concert Hall. President
Bloom will give an introduction to the program which includes works by Thomas

Texans of the

Why Texans are Texans
By Katie Menzer
A fellow first-year aptly asked me the
other day as we sat watching the cinematic
version of every vegetarian's worst nightmare, The Fly, if all my articles were going to
continue to be so pro-Texan and anti-Pennsylvanian. Well, after confronting the two
greatest shocks ofmy life in that one moment
of time, that of seeing a vomitous mass of
writhing baboon body on the movie screen
and also realizing that someone is actually
reading my articles, I was not immediately
able to answer my inquisitor. However, now
that several days have passed, I will proudly,
determinedly, and assuredly respond to her
question: ahh...sort of.
I did not at first realize that my discourses were so emphatically anti-PA. In
fact, I don't think that I really have any
specific complaints against the state...except
for one: Pennsylvania isn't Texas.
Now, I can imagine y'all (HA!) are
probably getting a bit huffy at this point.
After all, you might ask, what makes Texas
so wonderful? It's a state like any other state
in the union, right?
WRONG! Texas is, in fact, the only
state that retains the right to split into 5
different states at any point in time, and grab
ten, count 'em, ten seats in the Senate. Pretty
impressive, huh? Just think of the political
ramifications there!
If I were you, I'd start learning the
words to "The Yellow Rose of Texas" right

Hell,

hockey rink
Uncultured

while no one else I've ever met does. I have
managed to pick up a few of the basics, however, which I am more than happy to share with
you.
A) The Object of the Game: The object of
hockey is to skate around the rink several
times, until you're traveling faster than most
cars I've owned could even dream of, then
crash head-first into the wall. Those fans on
break from the general brawl in the stands then
judge players' facial expressions, which are
visible through the Plexiglas. Extra points are
awarded for getting spit, sweat, blood, or
mouthpieces into the fourth row of seats or
higher. If anyone manages to maim a fan by
shooting the puck over the Plexiglas, his team
automatically wins. This is the only reason for
the puck, as far as I can tell.
B) Penalties: It is against the rules to use
the sharp side of your stick to kill anybody, if
intent can be proven in a court of law. For this,
rape, grand theft auto or embezzlement, the
offending hockey player must endure the public humiliation of sitting in a glass box for two
minutes.
C) OtherPenalties: Whenever the moon
is in the proper alignment with the North Star,
Saturn, or downtown Buffalo, thereferee gets
to blow his whistle and call icing. No one
knows why.
D) Time of Game: The game lasts for
three periods of an equal number of minutes
each, the exact number to be determined by
how high the goalie on the visiting team can
count.

That's about it for ice hockey. Now you
can go to any of the Flyers preseason games
and see them get beaten by a bunch ofCanadians. One warning, though; as you are basking
in the glow of appreciating such a unique
cultural event, don't even look at the guy
sitting next to you. He'llknock your lights out.

you're going to rush downstream;

Garnet humbled by Hopkins, 41-17
Swat comes up short to Blue Jays for third year in a row
By Shawn Beckett
The undefeated GarnetTide of
Swarthmore College (1-0) traveled
to the wonderful city ofBaltimore,
Maryland, to play the undefeated
Blue Jays of The Johns Hopkins
University on September 17. The
Blue Jays were favored because of
their evident size advantage over
theTide. However, theTidearrived
with a high level of emotion and
intensity whichmade them feel that
they could overcome disadvantage.
This emotionpowered the Garnet to
an early 17-0 lead. Unfortunately,
the Blue Jays came back to defeat
Swat 41-17 for their third win over
the Garnet in as many years.
"We had it going so well in the
early going and had an emotional
letdown,** said linebacker Tavis
Tindall, one offour senior captains
on the team.
When the two football teams
came out ofthe tunnels and onto the
field, they were caught in an unforgiving downpour. That did not stop

the two combatants from stepping
onto the battlefield.
The GarnetTide received the
ball first and mounted a solid drive
until they were stopped near the
middleofthefield. Theypunted the
ball to the Blue Jays, but the Tide's
offense came off the field with the
feeling that they could move the
football against the Blue Jays. After the Blue Jays were stopped and
forced to punt, the offense used
their speed and strength to drive the
ball down the field to theBlue Jays'
one-yard line. Fullback KurkSelverian '97 then ran the ball in to put
the GarnetTide up 7-0,but they did
not stop there. The defense came
out later on in the half and scored
for the Tide. Selverian picked up a
fumble, caused by Nick Milligan
96, and ran it about ten yards for the
touchdown which made it 14-0.
MattManeiro '96 thenkicked a 43yard field goal in the second quarter
to put the GarnetTide up 17-0. The
Blue Jays mounted a forceful drive

and scored as thehalf ended to cut
thescoreto 17-7 at the half. "Everything was justrunning so smoothly.
We went into the locker room very
confident," said Tindall.
The cockiness of the Tide took
away their edge. The Blue Jays began to use their strength and
athleticism to overpower both the
offensiveand defensivelines ofthe
Tide, and the GarnetTide's offense
stalled in the second half. Conversely, theBlue Jays' offense began to click as they scored thirtyfour unanswered points in the second half. Both teams played hard
and showed some positive aspects
to their games. However, Johns
Hopkins came to thefestivities with
a little more to give.
The Tide went to (1-1) and
the Blue Jays went to (2-0). The
Tide's next game is September 25
at home against the strong Wing-T
offensive running game of
Gettysburg. Ipredict a GarnetTide
victory.

this week with victories over
Notre Dame of Maryland and
Albright and a loss to Bryn Mawr.
"We have won and played
well but we could be playing
better. We'll have to step up our
play to win some tough games
coming up. We are doing really
well in terms of quality of players. We have some really strong
first years and a lot of support
from our coach," said Emily
Smith '94, the left link tri-captain.
Last Saturday the team
started out with a strong 2-0 victory over the College of Notre
Dame. Both goals were scored
by Melissa Bonder '95 in the
beginning of the second half.
Swat dominated for most of
the Bryn Mawr game on Tuesday. Bryn Mawr, however, got a
lucky break in the second overtime and scored in the last minutes of the game.
Both Swarthmore's goals
duringregulation play wereagain
scored by Bonder. Ch'uya
Hornberger '97 played a strong
game on the offensive end at her
position at right link while Kelly
Wilcox '97 added strong defense
to Swat as a center halfback.
Coach Richard Kentwell
was ejected from the second
game because he was not coaching to the referee's satisfaction.
He left for the two overtimes and
was not allowed to be in sight of
the field for the hard-fought remainder of the game.
Swat bounced back on
Thursday with a victory over
Albright. The first naif of the
game concentrated on the fiftyyard line, balancing each side
with breakaways and good defensive
tactics
slowing
Albright's attack. Bonder ag-

gressively demonstrated great
dribbling skills to reach
Albright's goal and earn a stroke
as result of a penalty. A strong
'flick' stroke past the goalie by
Bonder was the first and only
goal of the game.
This goal gave the Swat
women a burst of energy and
they made strong offensive attacks. Lia Ernst '97 used skilled
dribbling and dodge moves to
start many of these offensive attacks. Strong defense on the part
of Susan Rivera '96 and great
saves by Liza Dadone '96
rounded out the first half.
TheSwat women dominated
the entire field in the secondhalf. Powerful defense by
Wilcox and Jane Grabias '94
stopped Albright's offense cold.
So, Albright called a time-out to
develop a plan to penetrate the
Swarthmore defense; however,
after the time out the Swatties
only came on stronger.
Bonder kept up the offensive attack by harassing the
Albright goalie with a plethora
of shots. She was joined by
Smith, Hornberger and SamPeltz
'97, who also powered crosses
from the left wing. Dadone
stepped up in the last few minutes to save a few Albright shots
and Swat came out on top, 1-0.
"It was a really good win
(against Albright) considering
we had such a tough loss to Bryn
Mawr earlier this week. The
victory got us back on track and
now we are clicking again as a
team," said Bonder.
The team looks forward to a
busy weekend on the field at the
Seven Sisters Tournament at
Mount Holyoke.
"We are looking forward to
theSeven SisterTournament this
weekend. We are really planning on doing welland shouldbe
very competitive in our league,"
said Bonder.

Women encounter tough matches
But team's fall "warm-up" season has encouraging signs for the spring
By Joseph Leahy
The Swarthmore women's
tennis team opened up its fall
season with losses to the University of Pennsylvania and to
Millersville University. U.Penn,
a tough Division I team, defeated
the women soundly, winning all
ninematches instraight sets. The
match against Division II
Millersville was, however, a bit
more encouraging.
Though Millersville won 72, both Swat's wins were important for the team's spirit. Kim
Crusey '95, playing first singles,
and Michelle Martinez '97, playing third singles, both showed
true grit by coming back to win
split-set matches. Moreover,
though Crusey'sfirst-set loss was
a mere 5-7, Martinez overcame a
huge 2-6 loss in the first set to
take her victory.
Defeating Millersville in two
of the top three spots also says a
lot for Swat's overall competitiveness; other Division 111 teams
shouldn't have Millersville's
depth, since D-3 rules prohibit
teams from recruiting players.
Though Swat lost all three
doubles matches at Millersville,
Coach Dan Sears believes that
the team showed promise andsimply lacked match experience.
Such experience might help the
team eke out close victories in
future matches. Disappointing
losses today, like the thirddoubles

match that Swat lost in a third set
tiebreaker, might be inspirational
victories tomorrow.
Though the team has showed
some promise, no one knows what
to expect from the upcoming
season-for some good reasons.
The fall season is merely a warmup for the spring season, before
which anything could happen. For
instance, Crusey says several top
players are on leave this fall. Swat
had five underclass players at the
1992Nationals Tournament, and
only two-Crusey and Ruth Lieu
'94-are currently on campus. "I
think that if we are all back, we
have a good chance of being competitive this year," says Crusey.
On the other hand, Coach
Sears believes that several top
players might also go on leave in
the spring. "It's not completely
clear who will be playing for us
this spring. I have nine good
players out for practiceright now,
but among the top six we might
see some leaving and a couple
returning. And it's hard to tell
who will be playing well at that
time. So, it's difficult to to say
right now how we will look,
said Sears.
Coach Sears has big plans
for the year, though. "I want to
establish a viable and successful
women's tennis program here.
It's not that that hasn't been the
case in the past-it's just that the
coaching situation wasn't that
stable," he said.

"

More uncertainty lies in the
team's scheduling, according to
Sears. Some teams have changed
their major schedule to the fall,
and Sears hopes that his conference won't do the same thing.
"It's hard to build a team at the
beginning of a school year-especially whenthe weather starts out
nice and gets gradually worse on
you as you are trying to improve
over the course of a season."
But for right now,a little uncertainty is okay; it might even be
helpful. After all, if none of the
women are certain as to who will
be in the top six this spring, everyone has an incentive to work
their hardest over the fall season.
According to Crusey, "the
warm-up season gives the coach
a chance to see just whatkind of
talent he has. It also gives the
players a chance to know their
weaknesses so that they can work
on their weaknesses before the
spring season starts."
In sum, thefall season is short
on matches and long on practice.
As for match experience, the
next big challenge for the women
will be the Eastern Rolex Tournament at Trenton State, on October 1-3. Not all the women will
attend, but Martinez and Crusey
will both be playing and Crusey
will be seeded. A victory at the
tournament would give either
woman a chance to attend the
National Rolex Tournament in
Oklahoma, October 22-24.

Women's volleyball'
defeat is unde-served

After wins against Haverford and Cabrini,
team lets match against Washington slip away

Men's soccer gets all tied up
By Chris Marin
Nature and technology combined to give the men's soccer
team a week of frustration. After
winning two straight, the Garnet
tied at Western Maryland's joke
of a mud field on Saturday and
were turfed to death at Trenton
State on Monday night. The team
thenreturned home to face a very
stubborn goalie in their tie with
Washington College.
Last week'smonsoon not only
affected the health of most of the
Northeast, it also turned Western
Maryland's fieldinto a marsh. Slip
and slide was definitely the theme
of the day. However, the adverse
field conditions didn't stop Westem Maryland from drawing first
blood, less than 3 minutes in to the
game.
Swat was quick to strike back
as junior forward Nate Fairman
knocked in a goal off a deflection
by juniorforward Jay Rose. After
that goal the Swarthmore defense
controlled the tempo of the game
by constantly clearing the ball up
the field for the forwards and midfielders. Swat's ball control led to
a second goal by Rose, shortly
after halftime, on a beautiful cross
by junior mid-fielderBen Cook.
With the Garnet up 2-1, the
ball control game took over and
prevented Western Maryland from
threatening offensively.
When asked about his goal,
Rose grinned and said, "I felt like
I was out there, like, really out
there....The defense played effectively, limiting Western Maryland
to 7 shots going into the last ten
minutes. Unfortunately, the last
shot by Western Maryland sailed
into the goal with 7:27 left on the
game clock. It was a goal that
barely got by a leaping Shawn
Bundy, yet sent thegameinto over-

time as Swat failed to score in the
time remaining.
Western Maryland scored
with 6:30 gone by in the first overtime period, sending the home
crowd into a frenzy. Sensing an
upset, thefans began to growlouder
and more annoying. As the time
passed by and repeated Swat drives
went unrewarded, the team redoubled its efforts. Still nothing.
With less than 2 minutes left to
play, the last Swat drive of the day
paid off. Defender Ashee Bhan
'94 cleared the ballup the fieldand
passed to sophomore forwardLen
Cuello, whohad a one-on-one with
the opposing goalie. With a quick
dribble to his right, Cuello left the
Western Maryland goalie stumbling as he pushed the ball into the
empty net, saving the day forS waL
After the closecall withWestern Maryland, the Garnet hit the
road against 17th-ranked Trenton
State. Unfortunately, the field at
Trenton is made of artificial turf.
The men's team have only
played one other game on turfthis
year (September 3 against Kean),
and thus didn't have the expertise
to match up on turf. Trenton State
got off to an early 3-0 lead. Then
the Garnet stepped up to their
opposition's level and the starting
defense stifled the opposing offense and allowed one more goal.
The lone highlight of thegame
came from junior Jesse Murphy
and seniorPeter Jacobs, who both
contributed outstanding defense.
The final score of 5-0 remains deceptive, though; had the game had
been played on natural turf, it is
without doubt that Swat would
have played Trenton much closer.
The Garnet returned last
Wednesday to face Washington.
In their second Centennial Conference game of the week (Western Maryland being the other),
Swat endured a feisty opponent

who tested the limits of Swat's
offensive patience.
For the fourth time in the last
four games, the Swat opponent
scored first, leaving thehome team
with an immediate hole to climb
out of. The offense was led by
seniormid-fielders JeffNebelsieck
and Ken Cato. Swat advanced the
ball down into the Washington
backfield, a ball over the end-line
set upa cornerkick for Nebelsieck.
Operating from the far left
corner of the field, Nebelsieck
placed a perfect ball to Cato, who
laid in a beautiful header past a
dumbfoundedWashington goalie.
Despiterepeated attacks down
the field, which left Swat with
most of their 17 shots, the Garnet
could not capitalize and finished
regulation tied with a Washington
team whose offense was also shut
down. Unfortunately, overtime
did not treat the Garnet well as
they let 4 of their shots on goal sail
outside the net.
The offense's bad luck thus
made for the second tie within the
week. The lone highlight in the
game came from Bundy who had 9
saves-6 in the second half.
Since theserecent disappointments, the men's soccer team has
taken a new approach to their season. Before, after a pre-season
win against Villanovaand relative
success against #1 Kean College,
the Garnethad high hopes for their
season. Now, though ithasn't lost
its hope, the team added a new,
more central focus.
Says freshman Amber
Thompson, "As a team we've
agreed to focus on each game individually, as opposed to just looking ahead to the season as a whole."
That said, there is no doubt
that the Garnet will come out firing against arch-nemesis Johns
Hopkins in this Saturday's home
game.
