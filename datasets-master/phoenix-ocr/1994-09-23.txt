Swat Alumna Receives
MacArthur Fellowship
By Lisa Hibler

among the first colleges to convene teach-

ins

Heidi Hartmann '67, directorof the Institute
for Women's Policy Research in Washington,
D.C., has been awarded aMacArthur "genius"
fellowshipof $295,000 for her work on women's
issues such as welfare reform, family and medical leave, temporary and contingent work, and
women in the labor force.
The MacArthur fellowship allows its recipients to use the funds which they
receive for any purpose.
Hartmann intends to take advantage of her fellowship for
her family's economic security.
The program was established in
1981 by the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur foundation, in order to "free exceptionally gifted individualsfrom
money cares." Twenty awards
were madethis year—seven to
women and eight to persons of
color. Director Catharine
Stimpson said, "These greatly giftedpeople are
as diverse as the United States itself. However,
their talents have a common thread. They renew our hope in human possibility."
Hartmann describes the fellowship as "compensation for the money you lost doing what
you are doing" and adds with a laugh that the
award reminded her of the difficultiesof being
a radical feminist economist "Itis worth it!"she
added with emphasis. She feels linked to a

political struggle in which she has made considerable progress since leaving Swarthmore
College in 1967.

The transition from a single-parent, working-class household in southern New Jersey to
Swarthmore was rough for Hartmann. She entered an elite institution which "has difficulty
diversifying its value system or incorporating
you into it," particularly if you do not stem from
that same system. She and her brother were the
first members of her family to go to college.
Before coming to Swarthmore, the notions of
academia or of training to be a college professor were foreign to her. At the same time,
Hartmann feels that Swarthmore, though elite,
worked tocreate an environment of equality on
campus, which made her comfortable. Differences in class background were minimized,
because all campus events were free and no
students had telephones.
Hartmann became politically active at
Swarthmore as a member of SPAC (Student
Political Action Committee) and through involvement in Chester where she worked to
have a bond issue passed. Swarthmore was

the Vietnam War, which also opened
political issues. Yet her
political involvement waned during her last
two years at Swarthmore, since she spent
most ofher time in the library writing papers
for her Honors Economics seminars. This
made her become less active in promoting
social change and come to consider teaching
as the only job for which she was qualified.
It was not until she started
graduate school at Yale in
1969, and became active in
leftist groups supporting
radical economics, that she
realized she could "use education for social change."
Hartmann emphasizes the
luxury of attending elite institutions, such as Swarthmore and Yale, which can
foster intellectual development that can be applied to
on

her eyes to larger

Hartmann, who entered graduate school
thinking she might end up teaching at a
community college, went from Yale to a
two-year position at The New School for
Social Research in New York City. In 1976
she wentto Washington D.C. to work for the
Federal Civil Rights Commission and raise
her four-year old son as a single parent. She

soon switched to a position with the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1988 she
cofounded the Institute for Women's Policy
Research with Teresa Odendahl.
Hartmann's advice to women interested
in infiltrating the field of public policy is,
"Don't give up! ..Women are still a minority
in the field," but she emphasized that they
"need to get in there." One way is to use your
expertise to influence policy decisions, as
she has done.There are also, she says, many
other paths to follow.
Hartmann's fellowship marks her struggle
to find a voice for women's issues in a maledominatedfield. The first check was shared
with her staff at the Institute because
Hartmann believes that feminist policy research is "a collective endeavor." Some of
the money will also be used to pay for a
special assistant this year and to ensure "my
ability to send my children to college."
Hartmann's story may encourage women
interested in public policy, as well as all
Swatties who dredge through the academic
work here. It serves to show us that our
education really can function as a vehicle of
social change.

Students and Staff Reflect
on Summer Use of Campus
By Kathleen Law ton
While most Swarthmore students hurry off
campus at the end of the school year, some
choose to live in Swarthmore for the summer
in order to take up a job or help professors with
research. They have the opportunity to expand
their learning, to study aspects of their majors
which expand beyond the curriculum, or simply to take in the campus while no one's
around. By and large, they rave about the

experience.
The campus is relatively deserted from May
until September. The main groups on campus
are Upward Bound, a campus outreach program which offers academic programs to high
school students in the area, and Future Stars
International, an athletic camp for children
from ages nine to eighteen. Funds collected
from organizations that use college facilities
are placed into the "general budget to pay for
things like financial aid [and] faculty salaries,"
according to Larry Schall, Associate VicePresident for Facilities and Services.
Students who stay for the summer may pay
to live in Roberts dormitoryfor the summer, or
they may live with some professors who offer

their houses for the summers. They may not,
however, enroll in classes, since Swarthmore
has never offered a summer session as far as
Schall can recall. "I believe the College Plan-

ning Committee will be exploring whatkinds
of programs we will run in the future and I
suspect they will look at this as one possibility," Schall remarks.
Students may work for individual departments, or they may work in some of
Swarthmore's administrative offices. Some of
them have received grants from the College or
from other organizations to research, to begin
their theses, or to work on special projects not
possible during the year. Many international
students stay on campus because of difficulties
returning home, or because they could get
higher-paying jobs in the U.S.
Adam Koplan '95 received a Swarthmore
Foundation grant for the summer of 1993 to
work on a two-fold film project in which he
made a fund-raising video for the United Way
of Western Delaware County, and then taught
a film class for teenagers at theChester YWCA.
He lived in Roberts, and says that "everyone
should stay on campus for the summer." The

meeting of Black students in which
they decided to make issues of curriculum, pedagogy in the classroom,
and multicultur alism the focus of the
movement.

More visible to the campus at large
were two silentsit-in demonstrations,
a march through campus, and a campus-wide "intellectual inquiry," organized by SASS and SPAC, to examine hate speech and multicultural
representation. Student organizations, individuals, faculty, and administration members were invited
to this forum, which was "a way for
white, left-wing students to do a structural critique of Swarthmore and
themselves," according to Michael
Murphy, '95, member of SPAC.
The main purpose of the intellectual inquiry was to consider whether
a hate speech policy and mandatory
multicultural courses should be es-

tablished in reaction to these incidents. Both of these ideas were highly
controversial.
Views ofahate speech code varied
among student organizations. SASS
and the Socialist Political Action
Committee (SPAC) presented proposals for the limitation of allowed
speech forms on campus.On theother
hand, the Swarthmore Conservative
Union (SCU) opposed it as an issue
of First Amendment rights.
Bradley believes that "the manner
in which we interact in a non-insulated context should be very different
from the way we interact in an insulated environment like Swarthmore.
A policy should [express] a spirit of
how students, faculty, and staffshould
interact in a constructive way, in a
way that doesn't violate anyone's

space."
In response, Matthew Schenk, '95,

During lunch and dinner on Monday, outside of Sharpies, a non-binding vote will bw
held to gauge the general feeling of students
towards theraising of the American Rag. Last
spring, a debatearose over whether toraise the
flag on theroof of Parrish. A flag raising was
proposed by the Swarthmore Conservative
Union (SCU) during ConservativeWeek. But,
the Socialist Political Action Committee
(SPAC) protested theproposal, on the grounds
that the flag would represent only Conservative interests, instead of those of the entire
school.
The flag was eventually raised, but was
taken down again before Alumni Weekend.
Now, in an effort to settle the debate over the
flag, Matt Schenk '96, a member of SCU, and
publisher ofCommon Sense, the campus conservative newspaper, wants to hold the vote.
Schenk said that SCU "honestly thought
that [raising the flag] would be a good way to

bring the campus together. It is not a conservative thing, it is an American thing. The vote
would not be official or scientific, but just to
get a general feeling of what the campus
feels. The decision is ultimately [President]
Al Bloom's. I'd like to take theresults to him
and ask him to base his decision on them."
Michael Murphy '96, a member of SPAC,
the SocialistPolitical Action Committee, said
that "the original protest was not to stop the
flag flying above die campus, but against the
way in which it was raised, which completely
ignored democratic process. The flag could
mean different things to different people
across racial and class lines. A lot of people
had their own personal reasons for not wanting the flag raised. SPAC was involved in
making sure that everyone was heard and that
there was a consensus."
Schenk saidhe wants members of SPAC to
sit at the voting table with him, because "we
don't want it to look like a Conservative issue
again. I want it to be evenly represented."

Norma Nangju '97 agrees. She
spent the summer of 1994 working
on computer programming for the
Engineering department, and lived
withProf. John Gaustad'sfamily and
six other students. They lived as a

We really became open and trusting

Nangju was able to visit friends
who lived in nearby states, and also
get to know many members of the
Swarthmore community who were
still on campus. Spending a summer
away from her family was hard for
Nangju, and she says that she was
often homesick. However, she adds
that she gained confidence in a summer here that she could not have

"It was nice for me to be able to stay

Rolling Dice with U.S. News NASA's Big Bust

Grumbles on the magnitude of

around campus last week as the
Swarthmore ego took another hit
from the folks at U.S.News. Twenty
five thousand dollars and a couple
years off the good end of 1300
budding lives ought to get the college over the third place hump,
right? Wrong. Before we get carried away and organize a
firebombing of the perennial powerhouses of the norm, let us examine some of the principles that go
into the ranking of an education.
First, U.S. News assumes that
one consumes a liberalarts education rather than experiences it. Society has commercialized everything from books to our bodies so
why should we think twice at the
summing up of our college experience in a single statistic? As the
total cost of college creeps towards
the Lexus ES3OO price range, we
must know how fast a Swarthmore
diplomacan take us from 0-$50,000
and whether it will have a good
resale value from interview to interview. And, as it turnsout, Swarthmore comes through in flying col-

ors; while not first, theranking gives
us students something to show the
folks at home who are always asking: "Is that a girls* school?"
Yet surely there is more to a lib-

Not every student interested in a
liberal arts education wouldbenefit
from an Amherst or Grinnel experience. By ranking schools in a concrete order, U.S. News implies that
schools higher on the list are automatically better for students simply
because of their position. As we
know, however, Swarthmore is not
for everyone. Although Swarthmore
might appear ideal on paper, there
are a million other factors that must

Flag Controversy is No Controversy

By Ben Thomases

This coming Monday, when members of the SwarthmoreConservative
Union (SCU) and perhaps theSocialist Political Action Committee confront you as you enter Sharpies, you
may actually want to
take a minute out of

when it was carried by our soldiers as
they drove Native Americans and
Mexicans away in quest for our current boundaries, or whenit was burned
to protest the unjust actions of our
government. But what did the flag

represent as it was laid across the
coffins of the heroes who died in
World War II? What does it represent as it flies over the buildings that
house our duly elected representatives in national state and local gov-

across the country?
Considering all of the different
contexts in which our flag has been
seen and interpreted, how should we
interpret it if it flies over Parrish? The
most sensible answer is that without
such a specific context the flag should
represent America, with all of the
good things—the democratic ideas
we have struggled for, the prosperity
many have enjoyed; and all the injustices—the impoverished who have
enjoyed no prosperity, and the oppressed whohave seen little evidence

you to vote as to
whether or not the
American flag should
be allowed to fly over
Parrish. To First-Year
students and those of
you who were away last
semester, this may seem
like a rather odd question, but I assure you it
is not a joke. Last
spring, when SCU
planned toraise the flag,
it generated a significant amount of
controversy. A vocal group of students strenuously objected to theflag
being raised, and while they only
managed to delay the process, the
flag went up and came back down.
We are left with the same controversy.
The argument of those who don't
want the flag to fly over Parrish is
based on the question of what theflag
symbolizes. They claim that it symbolizes theAmerican military, American imperialism, and the suffering of
minorities oppressed throughout
much of American history.
This appears to be a rather onesided view. Like most symbols, the
flag can represent a wide variety of
things depending upon the context in
which it is seen. The flag might have

In DC, the Return of Marion Barry
By Lindsay Koval
Last week, voters in Washington, DC sent former
mayor Marion Barry to the front line of the mayoral race
with a huge victory over his opponents in the primary
election. This is the same Marion Barry who was ex-

posed for cocaine possession and use in a 1990 scandal
that rivaled Watergate and Whitewater, at least in the
small jurisdiction that we call
the District of Columbia.
Forty-seven percent of the
voting public was able to forgive Barry for his transgressions and, in a manner, forget
them. He seems the sure
winner in November, with an
"I'm-back-and-better" platformand an absence ofheated
competition from the Republican party.
But should Barry have been
permitted to run again, in view
of his past drug use and recorded felony? And what
comment does his victory make on a society that has
seemingly effaced his tainted record? Two sides of an
argument develop. One is in direct accordance with the
moral we learned in childhood: forgive and forget
Barry and othercrooked politicians like him served time
for crime, went through rehab, and have staged a comeback. The secondsideis theposition thatpoliticians are
figures of public scrutiny and are by naturerole models,

and should virtually be on a higher echelon than we lowly
voters who chose them to govern us. Such is the beauty of
democracy.
How can we, as the voting public, consciously reelect
a tainted man or woman for a position of supreme power?
For example, could you—or should you—elect a fellow
student to the student council if the student had been
brought in front of the council for say, plagiarism, cheating, or hiding an arsenalofrifles
in his dorm room? Similarly,
in view of his alleged arms
sales, how can Oliver North be
a Senate candidate?
These
situations bring a monumental
question to light: are politicians
above the law?
The whole issue of politics
and the sanctity of both professionaland would-bepoliticians
foments a moral dilemma that
pits our childhood values
against our burgeoning adult
rationality. Is it not man' s tragic flaw to fail at his job and
fallfromhis position, only to desireand struggle toreturn?
For Barry and scores of second-chance politicians, the
struggle to return on high has been too effortless a task.
When we consider these cases, we realize that our
confusionand dichotomous view ofthe situation isrooted
in our childhood, for, when we were taught to forgive and
forget, our molders themselves forgot the principles and
boundaries of right and wrong.

Linda MacDougal, Director of Dining Services, speculates thatthe credit difference provides an incentive for students toeatat Sharpies.
Sharpies spends money on each student regardless of whether or not he uses the dining commons. When more students visit the dining hall,
the College spends less money feeding them
elsewhere. But it seems ridiculous that a 50

dinner, a little less at breakfast) is necessary to
provide thatincentive. Students should pay for
the convenience of using the snack bar over

One Year Later: Rethinking Hate Speech
By Alice Stillman

The issue of how responsible, educated, socially conscious persons
should respond to hate speech will never be resolved to universal
satisfaction because of the extreme complexity of the definitions involved. Terms such as "offensive," "uncomfortable," and "threatening"
which arise in any discussion of how to identify "hate speech" seem
simply too arbitrary, since the inherent nature of these words makes
people interpret them in different ways. However, I still struggle to find a balance between
protecting the freedom of speech and ideas so
vital to intellectual diversity and addressing the
real pain of those people whose identities have
been attacked. I believe that written speech codes
will only suppress certain symptoms of the disease known as hate, causing them to resurface in
other—possibly more covert and/or volatile
ways.
Discussing this issue with other Swarthmore
students uncovered more intricacies: Where
should one draw the line between sick humor and
hate speech? Should hateful speech said within
the privacy of someone's room be treated differently from hateful speech yelled across the public
space ofParrishbeach? Should premeditated hate
speech be viewed in a different manner from hate speech said in a fit o:
impulsive anger? Should hate speech directed towards specific groups
ofpeople be treated differentlyfrom hate speech directed towards certain
individuals? Should hate speech be addressed only when it is directed
towards minority groups? Should the administration become involved
or should the community itself handle the problem? These questions,
among others, make it almost impossible to codify a general policy on
speech regulation. Doing so would indeed damage the environment of
—

Student Handbook 1994-1995 gives the updated school policy on
violence, assault, intimidation, and harassment on
pages 23-24. For those incidents which do not fi
the stated definitions of intimidation or harass
ment, the handbook proposes the following:
"Members of the Swarthmore College commu
nity may find it appropriate, in cases of speech or
other actions they find offensive, wrong, or objectionable, to respond with further discussion, exchange of views, and reasoned argument However, whether or not they decide to exchange
views (and in the most serious cases, this approach
might not be desirable) students have the right to
request mediation or to initiate judicialprocedures
and are urged to consult with a dean, the Gender
Education Advisor, or other entry person into the
process for support and to help clarify informa
and formal options for resolution."
Although any institution has room for improvement, the administration of this one at least listens to the voices of its student body and seeks
change where there is sufficient cause. This is a unique and admirable
situation within a society which certainly does not seek to make its
individualmembers comfortable. Given these conditions, we are able to
respond »o these incidents of hate speech on an individual basis, and to
take advantage of student options such as mediation and judicial proce-

Third, College Avenue is not regulated by
Swarthmore College, but belongs to the Borough of Swarthmore. The Borough decided to
prohibit overnight parking on College Ave., a
rule in effect in many parts of the Ville. Finally, the parking behind Wharton has never,
in my three years here, been available for
student parking permits. Wharton has always
been faculty parking 7:3oam to spm, Monday

implies that aggregate parking permits have
been curtailed significantly.
The following sentence, however, really reminded me I was at Swarthmore:

place in regulating these extracurricular activities by withholding parking permits to nonSeniors." Of course! How could I forget. At
Swarthmore, not extending aprivilege is "regulating." Is the College "regulating" my ability
to fly by not giving me a plane? The College
has no absolute responsibility for supporting
my own personal activities. While the College
does help support many extracurriculars, this
function is purely discretionary, and certainly
not regulatory. After displaying such a cocksure and self-indulgent attitude, Mr. Hourigan

While admitting that a reassessment of the
parking situation on campus is needed, I object
to several references in Chris Hourigan's "Is
Parking for Seniors Only."
Mr. Hourigan states that "spaces in Bond,
Cunningham,College Ave, and Wharton were
deemed no longer suitable for student use."
First, there have never been any specific Bond
permits; the "S" permit allowed students to
park anywhere in student parking, including
Bond lot. Second, while the Cunningham lot
hasbecome faculty parking, the new lot by the

Swarthmore College
Ivory Towers and the LPAC
A brief'overview of Swarthmore's

unique architectural style.
By MeHssa L. Jacobs
Picture a campus not me students or the activities they post on a central kiosk*
community, not the facuhy, or groundspeople-~-ptcture the ivory tower
itself. Are the walls grey and Gothic? Red brick with ivy crawling? Spanish style
with tiled roofs?
Now picture Swarthrnore, as campus; Parrish with its 19tb century French
style, the meticulously labeled trees which dot the campus, Tarble in Clothier in
its Medieval garb, the ski lodge that is Sharpies, the Cruru woods, dilapidated
Trotter... what sort of campus is this? : .
It is as easy as it is accurate to describe Swarthmore as eclectic, Swarthmore
prides itself on being an institution which accepts and encourages diversity. How
appropriate is it in this case thai the campus itself, its buildings, its trees, its pathways, reflect this dedication to difference?
During his 1902 inauguration speech, Swarthmore's president Joseph Swain
declared* *A college cannot in any high sense belong, exclusively to a class, sector, creed, nor have a geographical or other similar limitations. It cannot be confined to a country, generation or time. It must be conducted that while best serving
each generation in its turn, it will ever adapt itself to the new and larger wants of
the rising one He could have just as easily been Ascribing the corning proliferation of buildings on campus.
Swarthmore was not always the strange gathering of structures that we find
today. Parrish Hall stood as the campus' original building. It housed therefractory, classrooms, administrative offices; essentially, it was the campus.
J. St. toe Strachey in his Swarthmore Colkge, a Comparison and an Opinion.
(1927) describes *the sysna and wood used in the construction are all, as might be
expected in a Quaker foundation, sound honest, durable, and without pretense. In a
word, the building exactly suits the institution.**
Clothier Half was built 50 years afterward, as our campus* tribute to the
Gotiuc/Academic tradition. The Sproul Observatory stood as the first president's
house. Trotter, now home to nearly every humanities class offered on carapus.was
once Science Hall, which neatly explains the words 'Chemistry and Engineering*'
which sit imposingly above me front entrance, Worth and Lodges were intended to
be more homelike in feel than collegiate.
; hx 196&, the original library become Tarble Social Center; Following the fire
there on Sept 16, 1982* Tarble in Clothier was designed by renowned Robert
Venturi to salvage the building's architectural features. More recently, the Lang
Music Hall and the Lang Performing Arts Center (LPAC) have been built with fine
attention to the Crura woods on whkh they border.
Professor T. Kaori Kitao of the Art History Department described the challenges
facing a small campus to maintain a sense of cohesion. Oft a Swartiunore-scale
carnpus, a "lack of unity becomes more visible.... Mixing styles doesn't necessarily break cohestoa/' she explains.
Should all styles be imitations of Parrish? Prof. Kitao sees greenery as the greatest asset of the SwaTthmore campus, which she sees as a framework hx which the
various building styles arc set.
In fact, until the 1960*s when the campus experienced an explosion of new
buildings whh the construction of Dupont {1959), Worth Health Center and
Sharpies (1965), and McCabe (1967), the abundance of trees meant that a "cohesive plan was nnneeded.** With these buildings added, the campus looked like "an
accidental gathering
She hopes that the Trotter conscrucfions will give the campus a much-needed
focus, for in the past, buildings were "built in isolation with very little concern for
shapes. The new building is very conscious of this to create a vital and viable space,
to defme the mtadrangle lof Beardsley, Dupont and Martin], offering a counterpart
with a courtyard.,, a small outdoor social area, for at the moment, people tend to
stand on the paths to chat"
Nowhere on campus does the tie to nature show itself more perfectly than the
Amphitheater. The tradition of carrying on Commencement there, rain or shine,
was established after a rainy graduation day sent the audience to the fieldhouse for
protection, while the students and president continued the procession.

A Spelunker's Guide to Swat
By Fred Bush
Swarthmore's tunnel system is toe often taken for
granted. From Parrish to Sharpies to the physical plant,
tunnels span nearly a quarter mile of darkness and steam
pipes. Most students fail to realize these sightseeing opportunities! So now, let us present you
with a guide to the tunnels for
your visiting pleasure.
If you want to see this scenic
it's a
part of Swarthmore,
leisurely climb down rusty
rungs to the dusty floor.
Anticipating darkness, I
thought ahead and brought a
light source. Though the light
bulbs near the grates are left on
(presumably to keep prowlers
away), the rest of the tunnels are
unlit.
I dressed lightly, remembering one of the main purposes of

the tunnels is to carry steam and

heat throughout campus. The
steam pipes are uncomfortably
hot in places and can make
heavy clothes very uncomfortable. The tunnels themselves
are about 7' tall and 6' wide,
though they narrow and shorten
in places.
I learned to love the pipes, though they seem a
plumber's worst nightmare. There are small, well-behaved
pipes lined up in neat rows along the wall, larger, fierce
pipes that hiss and clank as you approach, and even frightening pipes that cross the passage at beheading level.
The tunnels are home to a variety of noises as well.
There is the nasty hissing from the smaller steam pipes,
clanking and growling from the larger, and even the
dreaded "clank that moves," a disconcerting phenomenon
where a noise travels along a steam pipe and seems to follow as you walk.
Those looking for a dungeon will not be disappointed;
besides rusty chains, there are vicious-looking sharp metal
pointy things sticking out of the walls at regular intervals.
Some of the pipes are red-hot and the tunnel gets narrow

enough at times that traveling through it is like torture.
The most interesting part of the tour is the stuff found
lying around. I found several hundred-foot-long
nected extension cords lying like coiled snakes on the
ground, piles of cardboard boxes, even a shopping cart:
the tunnel has many wonders.
Animal lovers will not find
much to enjoy on the trip—the
"Centrac Rat and MouseKiller"
used in the tunnels has done its
work well. The only animals
here are the cockroaches hanging out in the damp spots, the
giant crickets near the grates,
and the occasional moth.
I noticed the Sharpies
mechanical room in passing by;*
it's a little alcove blocked from
the main runnel by pipes. In it
are many mighty machines,
thermostats, and bright lights.
From there you can shut off
Sharpies' heat or just monitor
the temperature of the building*
on a green LCD display
(Temperature: Low!).

s

Of course, every good trip
must come to an end—and one*r.
end of the tunnel is at the phys-

ical plant. The physical plant
boasts a wide variety of squar-

ish green and yellow machines
working busily, racks of chemicals, and many steam
gauges.

Parrish, at the other end of the tunnel, offers a locked
peephole offering a glimpse into a room of
unused desks and wooden trash, as well as an acetylene
torch and an arc welder.
Fortunately, I remembered to bring back souvenirs so r
could remember my trip into the bowels of Swat. Such
treasures as empty cans of WD-40, Centrac Rat and*
Mouse Killer, *important maintenance instructions* left
lying about on the floor, and even the cryptic 15D2128
3@46"SSL tag were mine for the taking.
This concludes your tour of the tunnels. Thank you for
taking Swarthmore tunnel tours, and please return your
grate to the upright and closed position before leaving.

at

Swarthmore, and on top of an education and a
potato bar at Sharpies, the College offers superstitions, ghost stories, and mysteries spawned

from our very own student body. Some may be
true, whereas others might just be hearsay students have passed down from one class to the
next. It is up to you the reader to decide which
H*** are facts and which are fiction.
Dr. Jesse Herman Holmes, a Swarthmore religion professor in the 1900's,died and later came
back through a telepathic channel to dictate a
book called As We See It From Here (found in
McCabe). He communicated through psychic
Sarah Gran to write about the experiences of life
after death.
A sophomore recalls having heard in her first
year the rumor that, "If your roommate commits
suicide, you'll get a 4.0 GPA for the semester."
Whether this is true or not is uncertain, but it
has spawned certain jokes about throwing one's
roommate out the window come exam time and
tossing an engineering book along to make it
look like a suicide.
This is not the only suicide story floating
around, however. A junior heard the rumor that
a student committed suicide by jumping off the
bridge by Dana that overlooks the train tracks.
Another suicide rumor gives a possible explanation for why Swat doesn't have any sororities.
According to Circulation Librarian Libby
Amann, it's because "a woman once committed
suicide by jumping off theBell Tower when she
didn't get accepted into the sorority she wanted." As a result, the school banned all sororities

Terr ill Johnston '97 heard from Jason
Zengarle '96 that if you walk backward with
your eyes shut between these two standing
stones in Crum Meadow (not the Stonehenge
rocks), you'll be transported back to the time of
the Druids sometime in your life.
It's also been heard by John Ackerman '95
that a Swattie couple used to live down in the
Crum near the woods because they couldn't
afford to pay for the housing on campus. He
says if you know the spot, yov can still see the
indentation in the earth where their home used
to be.
A member of the faculty here remembers that
about a dozen or so years ago, group of students were very much into witchcraft. They
would hold nightly meetings and one of the student even dressed like a witch.
Librarian Steve Sowards tells us that, at least
once a year, he used to receive calls from people
asking about a collection of giant nude statues
Swarthmore supposedly possessed. As far as he
and any of the librarians knew, no such collection existed.
Libby Amann recalls somebody bringing a
horse into Parrish, and then later leading it into
McCabe for a tour. Though he hadn't seen any
horse chips, another librarian, Ed Fuller, heard
that the ground floor of McCabe might collapse
because of an architectural error.
Of course these stories may or may not be
true. These legends and mysteries are, however,
part of Swarthmore. After all, there's nothing
wrong in believing, as Terrill Johnston '97 does,
that if you kiss a person under the Bell Tower at
the stroke of midnight, you will eventually
marry them.

The promised land of Mead and Honey
You must be getting pretty sick of the meaningless, fluffy banter I call my column.
So, after lengthy debate with my editors, the
administration, and you, the public at large, I
have decided to transform my column into an
open forum in which you, the public at large,
and I can voice our opinions on the issues
affecting the lives of the common man.
However, I have been extremely busy with
my other socially and environmentally conscious pursuits this week, meaning I've talked
to (that's the social part) at least four people
while sitting outside (the environmental part)
on the Beach and I was awake (the conscious
part) for at least half of the time. Therefore, the
only opportunity I've had to talk to you, the
public at large, about the issues of society that
seem tomost concern you, was this morning at
breakfast while I shoved a mangled bagel
down my throat, studied the perfect passive
participle, and attempted to dry the milk from
my blouse that had splashed there when the
moo juice I had been dispensing hit that one
ornery corn flake just right so that the entire
stream of milk was deflected off the flake and
onto my shirt.
So the issue that seems to most plague the
hearts and minds of men eating com flakes at

7:45 a.m. is... Should mead be dispensed from
the beverage machines in Sharpies?
Now, before we can fully examine the complexities of this argument, we must be sure to
define all terminology and set the boundaries
of our discussion.
Mead is defined by the
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary as "a fermented beverage made of water and honey,
malt, and yeast."
However, if you, the public at
large, have never been lucky
enough to be assigned the task of
reading
that epic poem,
Beowulf, you still might not
have a clear idea what mead is.
Ah yes, Beowulf, a tale of high
adventure in which a bunch of
men sit around a mead hall getting drunk, talking about the fish
they've caught, boasting of
women they've had, exulting in
the stories of the last civilization they've plundered, and whining about some pansy-assed
monster that keeps storming the hall and eating their brethren alive. But I digress.
Let's just think of mead as a sort of pre-cold-

filtering-era Colt 45.
Okay, with all those annoying preliminaries
done, it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty of
our discussion. First, the advantages of serving
mead in Sharpies:
1. Sharpies sort of looks like a mead hall. I
mean, it's big. You've got those
stone walls. People throwing
things at each other, grunting,
and basically being barbaric.
We would be following in th
tradition of our forefathers i
we, too, served mead within our
great hall.
2. We all know the drin
machines have a little problem
with consistency of carbonation

liquid, the next it gives you

bles. But mead ain't carbonatec
lt's thick and it's supposed to be
that way! And even if the mead is warm, as a
Sharpies beverages tend to be, after a few
glasses you'd never even notice.

a boon for

the administration as well. The theft
of both food and hardware from Sharpies is a
significant problem to those who try to manage our dining experience. But think, if mead
were dispensed at meals, the students would
have enough trouble justfinding their way out
of the dining hall, much less trying to get out
with a tuna fish sandwich, three mugs, two red
trays, and a napkin holder.
4. And finally, just look at the similarities
between the words "mead" and "meal." From
a linguistic standpoint, there's something really kooky going on there.
Now, the disadvantages of serving mead at
Sharpies: Okay, there's...No, that's not one.
Umm, there's...Nope, not one, either. Well?
Oh, okay, I got it!
1. Grendel might stop by for a little snack.
So, now it's time to weigh the advantages
against the disadvantages. This is the moment
you have long been waiting for. May I have
the envelope please...Yes! Mead should be
served at Sharpies. You, the public at large,
have spoken.
Man, I knew this forum thing was going to be
great! Next week we'll discuss whether Al

e) "I like scrapple."
At Swarthmore, "dating" lemains an unrealistic term. This campus can only produce
extreme romanuc situations. Your options:
hanging out (having sex, ftudying, eating
together, or a combination of the three), or a
full-throttle, pseudo-Siamese merger.
You can't win with your friends in either

In the name of Lt. Hannah's bad Sister
Movie Love

Woody
Allen's
In
Hannah and Her Sisters
everybody's having a midlife crisis. Hannah's husband (Michael Caine) is
having an affair with her
sister (Barbara Hershey),
who's trapped in a relationship with a bitter, anti-social artist (Max
von Sydow). Meanwhile, Hannah's other sister (Diane Wiest), an ex-coke addict actress
wanna-be, decides that maybe she'd be better
off as a writer, and asks Hannah for a loan,
"just to get started." Woody Allen plays
Hannah's neurotic (surprise) ex-husband, a
hypochondriac TV producer who quits his job
to figure out the meaning of life.
Sound complicated? It is. Interesting? Not
really.
One of the problems with the film is that its
central character isn't very interesting. As the
only character not experiencing a crisis, Mia
Farrow's Hannah doesn't have much to do but
look concerned. However dull she may be,
,

though, she's preferable to

Diane Wiest's shrill and
unfunny Holly, or Michael
Caine's lugubrious and
superficial Eliot. Woody is
funny as usual, but he's not
doing anything he hasn't
done better, and in better

pictures.

The organization is similarly lacking. It's
hard to see what these subplots are doing in
the same movie; the transitions between
scenes seem almost arbitrary (the pretentious
"epigraphs" which separate each section don't
help either). Hannah is interesting as a first
look at the themes which occupy Allen's best

movies of the last ten years—the existentialist
of
Crimes
and
self-questioning
Misdemeanors, the relationships in crisis of
Husbands and Wives—but on its own, it fails
to get off the ground.
Hannah and Her Sisters plays Friday in
DuPont at 7:30 and 10:00.

Continuing the theme of family relationships
is In the Name of the Father, which reunites
My Left Foot director Jim Sheridan with
Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis gives an
astonishing performance as Gerry Conlon, a
wayward Irish youth unjustly accused of and
imprisoned for an IRA bombing.
The Guilford Five (Gerry, his father, and the
three others arrested with them) were among
the first convicted under a British law allowing those suspected of terrorist activities to be
held without being charged or permitted to see
a lawyer. Particularly in high-profile cases,
the police took this as license to coerce confessions from Irish prisoners, who had never
been well treated in the first place.
Father works best when it concentrates on
the relationship between Gerry and his father
(Pete Postlethwaite). Day-Lewis is one of the
few actors who can portray characters considerably less intelligent than himself and never
sink into condescension or caricature, and he's
in great form here. It's a truly original performance.

Unfortunately, Father wants to be a political
film as well. But by concentrating almost
exclusively on the harm 'lone Gerry and his
father, the greater political context is lost and
the film turns into "one man's story," offering
cheap catharsis and phony resolution in lieu of
a call to political action. When Gerry throws
his fist in the air and vows to "fight on"
(you've seen the commercial), we're expected
to react like audiences did at the end of Rocky
HI. I hope the Irish win in the sequel.
In the Name of the Father plays Saturday in
the PAC at 7:30 and 10:00.
Also not to be missed is Abel Ferarra's Bad
Lieutenant, which stars Harvey Keitel as
(there's no other way to say this) a cop who
fights to save his soul after his gambling debts
draw him into corruption and drugs. It sounds
corny, but it's an amazingly intense, visceral,
and morally complex film—kind of like
Reservoir Dogs with a thesis.
BadLieutenant plays Wednesday in the PAC
at 10:00.

Week In Review...

Field Hockey
Swarthmore's Varsity and Junior Varsity
Held hockey teams have been blazing a path
of destruction through their competition at
both home andaway games. After six games
in two and a half weeks of regular season
play, both teams are undefeated. Obviously,
the teams and coaches are thrilled about the
stellar start to the season.
This week, the Varsityplayed Muhlenburg
University and solidly defeated them 3-0
with goals scored by Melissa Bonder '95,
Samantha Peltz '97, and Danielle Duffy '9B.
On Saturday, a mixed Varsity and JV team
met Philadelphia Textile athomeand walked
away with 8 goals. The only goal scored
against Swarthmore this week came from
Bryn Mawr College on Tuesday, but only
after Swarthmore scored an unheard of 13
goals against their arch-rivals. This victory
was especially sweet since Swat had lost a
game in a very heated double overtime to
BrynMawrlastyear. MelissaBonder scored
six of the 13goals; Peltz, Duffy, and Michelle
Walsh '9B also contributed to the victory.
The JV squad now has a record of 3-0-1.
This week their game ended in a 0-0 tie with
the Bryn Mawr JV team.
This weekend the team will travel to
Haverford to participate in the annual Seven
Sisters Tournament. The players are anxious
to improve upon their fifth place finish last
season and, in fact, feel that they have a
strong chance of fininshing first.

kicked off a new season of league play this

More impressive, however, is the fact that
the Garnet hasn't allowed a goal in theirlast
three games. While Sophomore keeper
Shawn Bundy has put up impressive league
numbers, including a 0.00 Goals Against
average and a 1.000 Save Percentage, he
ever so modestly gives all the credit to his
smash-mouth defense, "Our D this year has
just completely shut down the other teams'

The Vassar Invitational last weekend offered the men's cross country team paltry,
albeit amusing competition. But what ten
teams of misplaced 400
and gangly little boys could not provide by way of
athletic challenge, nature did, furnishing us
with an oppressively humid day. Kerry
Boeye '97 led the victorious Garnet squad
with a second place finish. He was followed
by the critically dehydrated pack of Steve
Laubach '96, John Freeman '96, and John
Kane '95, who placed sixth, seventh, and
eighth respectively. Frosh sensation
Wyndham Strodtbeck torpedoed in as the
Garnet's fifth man. Other highlights included freshman Noah Daniels' Ben

Junior Tom Fowler's head emerging over
the rolling hills of Vassar's course.

Volleyball Takes Centennial Conference By Surprise
By David Lischer
In defeating Haverford and giving defending Centennial Conference Champions
Franklin and Marshall a good match last weekend, theWomen's Volleyball team has reached
fine mid-season form. Serving, setting, and
hitting have meshed; this week was "the first
time the team came together and played as a
unit, as opposed to separate people on the
court," said co-captain Mary Beiler '95.
In earlier losses this season to Wilmington
and Western Maryland, Swarthmore was never
consistently in sync and had trouble with
timing and communication. The turn-around
began with the systematic four set destruction
of Cabrini, a match in which Coach Larry
Perry was able to give many of his inexperienced players a chance to play.
Swarthmore used Haverford as a warm-up
for its match against Franklin and Marshall
never giving Haverford an opportunity to get
into the match. The Haverford team starred
Swarthmore player Diana Bieber's sister
Alisa, but she was not enough to stop the 155, 15-8, 15-4 Swarthmore onslaught led by
co-captain Rachel McKaig '95, who had 13
kills. Going in to the Franklin & Marshall
match, Swarthmore was at a disadvantage, as

and eventually dropping the third set
14-16 and the fourth set 8-15. Although they
lost the match, they played well, which was
not the case Wednesday against Washington
College.
Poor passing was one of the key factors in
Swat's disappointing three set loss to Washington 14-16, 13-15,10-15. Swarthmoreplays
a perimeter defense which works best against
a team with strong hitters like Franklin &
Marshall, but a team like Washington with
less confidence in its hitting can give Swat
problems. Coach Perry has focused a lot on
defending against the dink shots that often
result in an effort tocounteract this weakness.
One of the more significant changes Coach
Perry has brought with him is his "concentration on the basics, [whereas] with [former
Coach Dale] Strawbridge there was more
scrimmaging and focus on game situations,"
saidLaura Pitman '96. Another distinct difference from last year is Coach Perry's willingness to take time out "to help people who
are having skill difficulties," said Beiler.
Haverford was Swarthmore's first Centennial Conference win, to which it hopes to add
another this Tuesday at 7:00 against
Dickinson.

Women's Soccer Troubles Continue In Seven Sisters
By Matt Halpern
After winning its first two preseason games
against York College andBeaver College, the
Garnet women's soccer team has gone 0-6.
"They haven'treally overpowered us. We're
just struggling to finish," remarked Coach
Cherie Goetcheus. "At this point in the season, I had expected to be 5-1."
Coach Goetcheus had plenty of reasons to
be optimistic. Namely, co-captains Bess
O'Neill '95 and Mary Catherine Arbour '95,
Madeline Fraser '95, and Heather Maloney
'95. This talented group of seniors leads the
Garnet this season. Their work ethic and
enthusiasm for the gameserve as an example
of excellence for their fellow teammates.

Despite the seniors' play, theSwat team has
had trouble winning games. "I guess you
could say it's a rebuilding season," said
Goetcheus. The Garnet have 14 rookie players on a 24 player roster. Betsy Rosenbaum
*9B, one of this year's rookies, commented,
"With this many new players, it will definitely
take the team some time to get used to each
other's style of play."
In addition, the Garnet has been hurt by
numerous injuries. "We're pretty banged up,"
Goetcheus said. In particular, they will miss
the play of striker Rachel Johnson'95, who is
out for theremainderof the season with a torn
ACL. "We're really going to miss Rachel,"
said Goetcheus. "Shecould have really helped
us out this season."

Last weekend, the team competed in the
annualSevenSisters SoccerTournamenthosted
by Mount Holyoke College. Although the
added games were good practice for their upcoming conference games, the Garnetdid not
have much success. In its first game in the
tournament, the team lost a hard-fought match
to Vassar College by a score of 2-1. In its
second game, the Garnet lost 7-0 to an overpowering team from Smith College. "We
never really made it out of the van for that
game," Goetcheus remarked. One positive
aspect of the team's journeyto Massachusetts
was that ClaireBaxter '9B, the team's sweeper,
was voted onto the All-Tournament Team, a
prestigious distinction awarded to the 12 best
players in the tournament.

As for the remainder of the season,
Goetcheus emphasizes that"the team needs to
take more risks." The players agree.
Rosenbaum said, "We need to concentrate on
our transition from defense to offense because
our midfield needs to concentrate on scoring
goals."
"The work ethic is there, we just need to
finish," added Elizabeth Galatin '9B.
This week the team had five days off, in
which to work on their conditioning, and polish theirball skills. Their next game is at home
at 1:00 on Saturday, against Western Maryland. It will be the Garnet's first conference
game, and a perfect opportunity to get back
into a winning season.

New Swarthmore Pep and
Funk Band Sounds Out
Support At Athletic Events

Playing the theme from Star Wars in lieu of
a Garnet Tide fighting song, the new
Swarthmore Pep & Funk Brass Band exploded onto the scene last Saturday with some
talent and a lot of gusto. Currently boasting a
membership of 15players, the brass band is
the brainchild of JanineSperman '95 and Josh
Sperry '96. Both Janine and Josh hoped to
start bands last spring, but neither felt that
they were receiving the kind of interest that
was needed. This year they joined forces, and
Swat Pep & Funk was bom!

excited. And, of course, to make some noise!"
Due to different tastes among the members of
the group, the music to be performed will be
a unique blend offunk and reggae mixed with
standardpep band and marching music a truly
diverse selection, suitably appropriate for a
college such as Swarthmore.

In keeping with this theme of "diversity,"
hopes to be useful, not only for the
football team, butfor other college sports and
events as well. At some point in the year,
Swat Pep & Funk intends to host a funk/
reggae dance party in order to add another
facet to their function on campus. Basketball
games are another suggestion, and hopefully
representatives fromother teams will approach
the band if they feel that such a group would
be appreciated at their events. The band has
been received well by the athletic department, being considered "a great addition to
our football game day" by Athletic Department Chair Bob Williams. Hopes are high
that as people get used to the idea and presence of such a group, the band will cease to be
viewed as an addition, and come to be thought
of as an integral part of Swarthmore athletics.
As a step in that direction, Swat Pep &
Funk plans to begin attending away games
before the end of the season, in order to boost
team morale in foreign territory. Before expanding in that direction, however, members
of the group feel that they should concentrate

ship (anyone interested inparticipating should
contact Janine or Josh), as well as focusing
on building a solid relationship with the
team, cheerleaders, and fans.
One long-term goal of the brass band is to
start solid traditions here at Swarthmore.
Attendance at sporting events tends to be
haphazard at best, and the feeling among the
members of the band is that some spiritrelated activities will play a big part in promoting such support. One tradition that may
become a source of much recognition is the
plan to march down Magill Walk en route to
all the home games. Students arc encouraged
to join the parade into the stands, and make as
muchnoise and commotion as possible. Eventually, the band hopes to boast band t-shirts
emblazoned with a catchy slogan as part of
the group uniform. Some suggestions have
been, "Anywhere else it would be an A-flat!,
Guilt withoutsax", and in an interesting twist
on

Kindergarten Cop. "It's

not a

tuba!!"

However, the group is still open for ideas.
Obviously, the group has big plans for
expanding in several directions. They also
understand, however, the importance of taking it one step at a time. For example,
learning some more music. So far, they have
a limitedrepertoire of material, to which they
plan to add various pieces as the season
progresses. Current favorites include the

half-time selection for the Johns Hopkins
game, "Remember When", and a masterful
rendition of "Louie, Louie". But in the
future, theband plans to be "utterly serious in
all respects... well, okay, maybe not," says
Ross Dickson '97. Endeavors to obtain suitable music have been at once discouraging
and heartening, as they found the StarSpangled banner in abundance, but no fight
song. Until a fight song can be either dredged
up from past years or invented, they may just
choose a new song each week to serve as a
crowd rouser when touchdowns are scored.
Last Saturday it was Star Wars. Rumor has
it that Superman or Rocky may be next.
You'll just have to come to the games and
find out!

Reaches

Swarthmore Scuba
By Kelly Shannon and Rebecca Cole

You just have to experience scuba diving to

understand why divers are so enthusiastic

about it. There's something exhilarating about
breathing 80 feet under the surface of the
water while you weightlessly roam about,
exploring pristine reefs, shipwrecked vessels,
and eerie caves, as schools of tropical fish,
evil barracuda, and sharks swim idly about.
You soon learn of the intriguing vastness of
the underwater world
each diveis a unique
experience. Although there are many alternative ways to take a peek at what's happening
in the waters that cover more than two-thirds
of the earth, any diver will tell you that scuba
is the way to go.
Having spent the past two summers scuba
diving in the waters around Maui, we never
thought we would think about diving here at

maybe in the middle of winter
with a sense of nostalgia for sandy beaches,
warm waters and tan lines. But much to our
surprise, Self Contained UnderwaterBreathing
Apparatus diving is one of the many activities
and organizations here at Swat more comSwat, except

monly known by its acronym. Although we are

anxiously suiting ourselves up to go for a
once in a lifetime dive experience in Ware pool
(we do admit that we have been a little spoiled),
it's a little cheaper than a plane ticket to Maui.
The Athletic Department, inconjunction with
Larry Westphal and Hidden Cove Scuba in
King of Prussia, are offering a variety of scuba
courses for almostall levels ofinterests for P.E.
credit. The classes are relatively small and
meet on a weekly basis. Beginning with the
basics, Open Water I covers the fundamental
materials and skills in the classroom and in the
water that are necessary for recreational diving

anywhere in the world. The more avid diver
can take the Open Water II and Advanced
Diver courses, during the fail and spring semesters, respectively. Despite the fact that diver

certification isn't free, this program is definitely a good deal when compared with programs elsewhere. Although you need a medical examination, Worth Health Center, in a
gesture of generosity, will provide exams free
of charge through Monday, September 25th.
In addition to the scuba courses available,
Professor Westphal is in the process of organizing a scuba club that will plan interesting weekend dive trips to the lake, shore, or local rivers
during the course of the year. We are also
keeping our fingers crossed for the possibility
of a spring break trip to the Caribbean!

Looking ahead, Becca Kolasky '96 viewed the
team as "solid and having the potential to do
very well." When the snow melts this spring

tennis team will return to the courts with success on their horizon.
This weekend the women's counterpart, the

it should provide an excellent display of talent.

Evil Buzzards Attack Haverford With A Vengeance
By R. Peter Prinz
Saturday, September 17, marked
the opening of the season for the Evil
Buzzard Rugby Cult, and they came
out with a vengeance. The men's
rugby team steam-rolled Haverford
with a devastating offense and an
even more impressive defense. The
final score was Swarthmore 50,
Haverford 3.
The first half of the game was a
scorefest for the Buzzards.
Swarthmore came out strong right
from the start with a quick-paced
game that left Haverford looking for
their running shoes. The first score
came ten minutes into the game when
outside-center Ricky Phillips '96
chased and recovered a punt from
fly-half Darin Friess '95. Phillips
triumphantly marched into the tryzone to give theBuzzards a 5-0 lead.
Friess successfully attempted the
extra point and the score went to 7-0
in favor of Swarthmore. Then, only
minutes later, Swarthmore had possession of the ball once more when
wing-forward Jason Dougal '96

dished off a pass to Mark Pletcher
'96 who ran theball into the try-zone.
The score stood at 12-0.
The following kick-off to
Haverford resulted in a ruck in which
scrum-half Justin McLean '95
snatched the ball and made a run
from the 40 yard line. Swarthmore,
however, was denied the try apparently because McLean did not touch
the ball down and Haverford recovered the ball, forcing a 22-yard-line
drop kick to Swarthmore. The
referee's call did not dampen Swat's
spirit. The Buzzards came right back
with yet another try by inside-center
Guy Danilowitz '96 who received a
loose-ball-pass from Friess. With
the extra point Swarthmore lead
Haverford 19-0.
The offense, led by forward captain Mike Madden '95, relentlessly
pushed Haverford back to produce
turnovers and new possessions for
the Buzzards. On one of these possessions Friess was forced to kick the
ball away, but miraculously, Phillips
again chased the ball as he didat the
beginning of the half to score yet
%

Pletcher '96. Facing two Haverford
defenders, Pletcher grub-kicked the
ball into the ground, passed theopposition, and recovered the ball in the
try-zone. The score: 45-3.
Swarthmore, however, was not finished with Haverford. Phillips scored
his third try of the day on a pass by

another try, with Friess' kick bringing the score to 26-0. The offense
was working like a finely tuned engine, for moments later Guy
Danilowitz shifted into high gear and
outran all Haverford defenders to
score his second try of the day. Winding down the first half, physically
exhausted, thereferee let the players
take a quick water break. The team
came back onto the field and with
only about three minutes to go, Friess
set up a post which resulted in a series
of offensive Swarthmore lines. The
ball came all the way down to full
backChazTeplin '95, who scoredhis
first try of the season. Swarthmore
ended the first half humiliating
Haverford on their own turf 40-0.
The second halfbegan slowly, with
both teams showing signs of fatigue.
Haverford made slow advances into
Swarthmore territory and scored on a
penalty kick to make the score 40-3
in favor ofSwarthmore. Haverford's
penalty kick went unchallenged by
theBuzzards for about twenty minutes when Swarthmore ran a line and
gave the ball to back-line wing Mark

Athletes of the Week

Mel Bonder, a senior Field Hockey co-

captain and four year starter, is on her way to
topping her record 28 goals last season. Bonder,
an attack player, is presently leading the varsity

hockey squad in an undefeated season. Bonder
began her season with eight goals in four games.

She then went on to dominate a 13-1 victory over
conference rival Bryn Mawr with six goals, including a penalty stroke. Presently Bonder leads
the team with 14 goals and has also beennamed to
the Centennial Conference Honor Role.
A fellow teammate said Bonder is a definite
strength in a team that is going places. Her
leadership on the field has helped the team to
defeat all of their opponents and contributed to a
defense that has held opponents to three goals.

Danilowitz and the gameended in an
overwhelming score of 50 points to
Swarthmore, while Haverford mustered up only 3. The Buzzards will
try to come out on top when they face
the University of Delaware this Saturday in their home-opener at Dupont
Field at 1 p.m.

the defense and helps to lead a talentedS war thmore
team. This defense has held their opposition,
including Division II schools, to five goals scored
against Swarthmore in seven games. This includes three shutouts in their most recent games,
two of which were also conference matches.
A fellow teammate said of Cook, "he is just a
good player, one of the top in the conference."
The team's victory over Washington College can
be greatly attributed to thisdefense. 'The defense
played awesome and limited the Washington
team's shots on goal so Swat was able to dominate. No one could get past Ben," said Kyle
Barnett '97.
