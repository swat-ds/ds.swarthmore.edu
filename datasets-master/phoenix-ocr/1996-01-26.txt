Multiculturalism Institute
Sparks Strong Emotions
By Jason Albright

During the last week of winter vacation, the Offices of the Dean and the
Provost initiated a plan funded by the
Hewlett Foundation to develop educationalprograms on cultural pluralism and
unity. TheWinter Institute, a conference
on diversity at Swarthmore, brought 35
students and eightfaculty and staff members together for discussionof theleadership, trust, and action plans needed to
affect their hopes for progress in
multiculturalism. Participants discussed

sions, a course on multiculturalism, and
activities such as film festivals that aim
to promote multicultural awareness.
Becca Hover '99, who attended the
Institute, appreciated dialogues on the
dynamics of oppression. "It was really
awesome," she says of an activity which
aimed to promote healthy communication of different groups' needs. The particular activity divided participants into
identity group caucuses in which each
answered a common series of questions.
Questions covered groups' reasons for

After 16 months of construction work,
Kohlberg Hall has finally opened.
Though about two-thirds of the first
floor and the language lab are still incomplete, all the classrooms and faculty
offices have been finished, furnished,
and are now in use. Kohlberg Hall has
become the new home for the departments of Modern Languages and Literature, Sociology and Anthropology, and
Economics.
Student and faculty reactions are generally positive. Nicole Breazeale '99 was
impressed by the "beautiful, spacious
classrooms," and Lisa Hilgendorf '99
was pleasantly surprised by the "ultracomfortable chairs, the large windows,
and the attractive color scheme." Other
students, however, are finding thelack of

their hopes for community support.
Deborah Stein '99, commented "The
Institute was a really intense experience
for everyone involved. I did not necessarily learn specific lessons- that's not
what it was about. Instead, my understanding and perspective on issues of
race and diversity hasbecome incredibly
more complex. It was an amazing experience to actually witness and participate
in communication across, between, and
within cultures."

Work Fell Behind Schedule
Originally, the school had hoped to
have the entire building fully complete
by the start of this semester, but a few
months ago, builders realized this would
not be possible. Still to be opened on the
first floor are the North Campus commons and coffee bar, a faculty lounge,
and a space for lectures, department dinners and discussions to be named after
Marge Pearlman Scheuer '4B.
The building has one elevator and three
staircases. The main staircase, which Hain

describes as "architecturally elaborate,"
is still to be completed. Constructing this
staircase and the intricate ceilings of the
first floor rooms is proving to be more
time-consuming than expected.
Eventually, the outdoor area of
Kohlberg promises to be a wonder in
itself. The Scott Arboretum is choosing
carefully the plants they will use and
planting shouldbe underway through the
spring. Walls ofvarying heights are to be
used in the position of the old Parrish
Annex to suggest a ruins garden, creating
an "outdoorroom" for students.
Meanwhile, the renovation ofTrotter
Hall, right next door to Kohlberg, has
already begun. When the work is finished, Trotter will house the departments
of Classics, History, and Political Science, as well as the Writing Center.

Honors Grading Debated
By Evelina Shmukler

A crowded room full of people shouting, arguing, sighing, whispering. Perhaps a solitary paper airplane arcs over a
sleeping head. Four or five hours later,
the room empties, paper clip sculptures
and broken pencils scattered over the
desks; all that remains of the bustle are a
few scraps of paper, some obscure
graffitti, and a numberof very important
decisions: Honors grades.
Some think the annual meeting in
which visiting examiners decide on Honors grades is "cool," said Associate Provost Mark Jacobs. But the Curriculum
Committee feels the meeting is too chaotic, time-consuming, and unfair to students, and wants to replace it with a
computerized system that will average
students' grades in all of their Honors

"Currently, it's a very primitive sys-

blackboards and chalk. But we need the
opportunity for reflection and revision.
Sometimes you do change your mind
after discussion."
She proposed as an example a situation in which a studentdoes brilliantly on
the written part but then cannot say a
word during the follow-up orals. After
discussing with other examiners, a professor can get a sense of whether the
student is just shy, or whether there are
great gaps in his/her preparation. This
could make the difference between an

Sophomores Prepare to
Declare College Majors
By Jessica Harbour
The time has come for the members of

the Class of 1998 to write their Sophomore Plans of Study, unofficially known

as"sophomorepapers," in order to apply
for a major. On Wednesday, they met
with many members of the faculty and
administration in Bond for dessert and
discussion of the sophomore papers.
During the meeting, Associate Dean
Bob Gross, Registrar MartinWarner, and
Provost Jennie Keith explained the process of applying for a major and told the
sophomores what dates they should remember. Lindsay Koval '9B, found the
meeting "a worthwhile experience."
The process has left some sophomores
apprehensive. Dan Eisenbud '9B confesses he knows very little about the
process. During the meeting, the topics
of students' questions ranged from how
to choose a faculty advisor to how to
actually file the forms. 'This doesn't
determine the rest of your life," Gross
assured them. While choosing a major is
indeed an important academic decision,
he said, no one should be losing any sleep
over it, and he called the sophomore
paper itself "a modest exercise." Some
students, however, seem to disagree.
Thomasinßentley '9B, commented"The
thought of writing the sophomore paper
is really scary. I feel really clueless. Also,
the philosophical aspect of choosing a
major was not sufficiently emphasized."
Elizabeth Elliott '96 remembers
classwide panic over the writing of the
sophomore paper in 1994. "The night
before it was due, the power went out.
Our entire class was freaking; we all
thought we wouldn't be able to get it
done; people were running around saying, 'We're going to have to write it on

napkins fromTarblel' But they [the administration] did give us an extension."
More students and faculty members attended this year's meeting than was expected. After Gross's speech and a question-and-answer section, the meeting
broke up into small groups as sophomores sought out professors from their
potential major departments.
On November 20, Keith sent a fourpage memo to all sophomores detailing
the expected form and content of the
sophomore paper, with a schedule of
departmental meetings and two copies of
the Probable Major Identification Form,
which is due to individual departmental
offices by February 12.
By then, each sophomore will have
met with a faculty member from the department or program they plan to major
in, as well as attended the department's
open meeting. "The purpose of these
meetings," Keith wrote, "is to describe
therange of offerings withineachdepartment, program, and concentration and
the way they relate to other programs in
the College."
All open meetings will take place between January 29 and February 8, usually in the late afternoon or evening.
The actual sophomore paper is due
February 26, along with the major application forms, to the Registrar's office.
Sophomores will outline their plans of
study for the next two years and notify
the College of their plans to apply to the
Honors program, study abroad, and explore areas of interest outside their major. The departments will give out their
acceptances and deferrals starting around
the third week of March. However, applicants to Honors and to double majors
will not know their status untilthe end of
the semester.

and the"S ix ty- Second Preview" will give

"FromDusk Till Dawn"features some
memorablelines, afew interesting scenes,
impressive special effects, and at least
one memorableperformanceby an actor.
But this is a bad movie. Apparently,
screenwriter Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez gave up halfway through it.
Thefirst halfof the movie, like most of
Tarantino's other films, is ironic, violent,
funny, sadistic, artistic, and filled with
sharp dialogue. While not as original as
Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, the first
half of "Dusk" is very smooth and
watchable—well, as watchable as rape

and human combustion gets. The second
half is terrible.
At the start of "Dusk," we meet outlaws Seth and Richard Gecko as they
hide in a convenience store. With familiar Tarantino style, the pair creatively
threaten the storekeeper and do away
with him, an unwitting Texas Ranger,
and the store, because of psychotic
Richard's (played by
Tarantino himself) delusions. Seth (George The
Clooney) chastises his
brother as they stroll to

toward the Mexican
border, the store exploding behind them,
stolen money in the back seat andanother

quite impressive.
The administration described the basic floorplan of Kohlberg to be three
separate wings. The long wing (directly
parallel to LPAC) and the short wing
(which points to Parrish) are connected
by the buffalo wing .
While there are three floors, the long
wing staircase contains an extra flight of
stairs leading to a mysterious door. Recent speculation holds that this is where
they hold students who have broken the
strict ban on halogen lamps.
Kohlberg is scheduled to be completed
by March 1. While most students have
strolled through Kohlberg by now, few
know how the finishing touches will unfold. After attending an information session with members of the Physical Plant
and doing some dangerous field reporting (it is still a construction zone, and I
was lacking a hard hat), I feel qualified to
sketch my vision of the future.
It has often been said that the beginning is a very good place to start. Since I
usually avoid cliches like the plague, I'd
like to begin with the second floor. The
short wing of the second floor is occupied by the Sociology/Anthropology faculty offices, while the long wing is used
by the Economics department.
The buffalo wing is quite stunning; the
long hallway contains a number of seminar and class rooms which contain beau-

hooks, which are certain to
be used. Overall, the feeling is very modern and extremely impressive.
Moving up to the third
floor, you may think you
have entered the United
Nations building, but in
fact, you are on the Modern Languages floor.
Both the long and short
wings house Modern Languagefaculty offices along
with a few seminar rooms,
one of which was described
as "funky" (yes, that is a
legitimate quote).
Besides some larger offices, the Modern Language professors are most
happy about the brand new,
technologically advanced
language lab that should be
up and running soon. Now,
with the help of the new
computers and laser disc
players, you too can learn
how to say, "Where is the
shoestore?" in Spanish or
any other language.
The remaining floor is
the ground floor. However,
only the short wing is finished. Thanks to this wing,
you no longer have to trek
all the way out to Pearson
to deposit those birthday
checks from Grandma; the
Franklin Mint Federal

Credit Union is now right in the center of
campus.

Also located in the short wing are two
large seminar rooms that are truly stateof-the-art. They have an advanced audio
system (rumor is that somebody who
tested the limits of the bass caused the
power outage), projection VCRs, and dry-

erase boards.
These rooms, like most of the Kohlberj:
classrooms, are wired for computer class
room potential. The long wing will have
a forum for visiting speakers with a capacity of one hundred people.
The buffalo wing will hold the most
awaited aspect of this building the coffee bar. If the floorplan is any indication,
the buffalo wing of the first floor will
become for both students and teachers a
new hub of leisure and relaxation (if any
of these are possible at Swarthmore).
On the side nearer LPAC there will be
a faculty lounge, where faculty can relax
and discuss pertinant school issues, such
as the possibility of making McCabe
clothing optional or having Al Bloom
participate in the Dash for Cash in an
effort to lower tuition costs.
Then perhaps this stimulating conversation will float down the hall to the
Commons, or as I prefer to call them, the
Buffalo Commons. Here there will be a
number of chairs and high stools with
counters where undernourished students
can enjoy bagels, croissants, and espresso
at the Coffee Bar.
Thus ends the illustrious tour of the
new Kohlberg Hall. I can now do no more
than to leave it up to you. the reader, to
make your own judgements. I beg you to
look past the art glass and into the heart of
this building. The air conditioning, coffee bar, and overstuffed chairs are enough
to make this place a hit. On this note, I
suggest all of you go and explore for
yourself.

I was skeptical from the
very beginning. I have justbeen asked
to compose a small piece for El Phoenix about how Swat has changed and
compare it to my time away during the
last year.
"When is this due?"

"Tomorrow. Thanks." Some things
never change.
I have been studying down under at

Melbourne University for the past
year. Well, studying may be thewrong
word; let me just say that I was enrolled and 1 think the classes 1 signed
up for really did exist. The differences
between there and here are comparable to the differences between, oh
say, night and day. As in, here we
work in the night and there I slept in
the day. After Swat's enthusiasm for
having us wring every last drop of

one thing I've
found to be true is
that all of us here thrive on being

The level of commitment by the staff
and students alike is something not
found in very many places around the
world, and something to be truly ap-

preciated.
I was asked to compare my time
away at Melbourne University to life
at Swarthmore College, but that's
like trying to compare apples and
root canals. It is good to be back
though; seeing old friends and meeting new ones. I have really missed
the work involved and rewards gained
from such a great academic forum.
And while we all go through life
enjoying new experiences and reliving old ones, I don't think anything
will ever really compare to my time
here at Swarthmore.

Steve Forbes' Flat Tax: Guess Who Benefits!

17%, eliminating deductions and other
escape routes in the current system will
translate into more taxation business.
So how do we account for the revenue

similar ideas about the top tax rates? Or
that just too long ago to remember?
Forbes' campaign speeches have dwelt
primarily on the joys of simplicity; if we
can do our taxes more easily and efficiently, we'll all be happier, which will
somehow lead to more growth and more
productivity. From Forbes' particular
viewpoint, this seems immensely compelling, since sorting out taxes amid the
deductions and loopholes and exempwas

Finally, there's something to be said

about the mean-spiri tedness of a flat tax.
Low-income folks will pay little or no
income tax, as is currently the case. But
the earnedincome tax credit disappears—workincentives, anyone?—and the mortgage interest deductionmakeshome buying for the poor even harder. Moreover,
as Sloan observes, it seems noteworthy,
and not a little distasteful, that salaried
income is taxed while investment income is not, so that the
rich can live indefinitely on interest while
those ofus who didn't
that
inherit magazines continue to scrape by.
The self-serving
quality of such a tax
would seem a lotless crass if thebenefits
were spread around—but slashing benefits to thepoor, starting with the earned
income tax credit and continuing on to
Medicaid, energy assistance, subsidized
housing, and other forms ofwelfare (the
first victims when revenues fall short),
makes it all seem like an extended exercise of what-can-I-get-away-with. Pushing a tax that would bring massive financial benefits to oneself and one's friends
does not win one any credibility points.
Ironically, Forbes' proposal, bill it as
hemay as anti-Washington, is characteristic of inside-the-Beltway thought in
one particular respect: it advocates a
quick-fix solutionmat sounds neato and
allows us all to avoid hard choices. His
ascent to second place in most polls of
Republicans suggests, sadly, that people
are anxious to buy that quick fix—although probably not enough to unseat
Dole as the Republican nominee. Unfortunately, the popularity of the flat tax
among candidates (your columnistis bracing himself for a Clinton version), and,
increasingly, among voters, stamps it as
a bad idea that doesn't plan to go away.
The wishful-thinking mode that continues to characterize budget and tax policy
debates does little to prove Thurber
wrong.

SPORTS

Men's Basketball
By David Llscher
The 6-10 record is meaningless. At
this point in the season with seven of the
remaining eight contests against Centennial Conference opponents, the men's
basketball team has one thing on its mind:
the playoffs. Based on its performance in
theirlast two games, whichincludedvery
convincing victories over WestemMaryland 85-57 and Philadelphia Pharmacy
82-65, the team is capable of winning all
eight contests and competing in the
postseason for the second straight year.
While most students wererelaxing over
the holidays, the team was hard at work.
The G amet took second place at the Greyhound Converse Classic in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania losing toregionally ranked
Moravian in the finals.
First, it marked Jeff Greeson's '97
return to the lineup. Sidelined for the
majority of the last two seasons with
knee injuries, he quickly made his presence felt averaging 13points per game in
the tournament and being named to the
All-Tournament team. The experience
was even more special for him since his
father drove from Ohio to see him play.
"[Greeson's] return helps us out a lot
He gives us another scoring threat and
more rebounding. He also adds height
and an intimidationfactor in the middle,"
said Aaron Bond '97.
The team was forced to spend an extra
two days in the hotel because of the
blizzard that hit during their game with
Moravian.The team barely made it back
to the hotel afterwards and were all but
confined to the building for two days.
The players amused themselves with
cable television and snowball fights.
Over the holidays however, the team
suffered several setbacks. The loss to
Washington College 59-55 was perhaps
the most upsetting. "That was an enormous loss because we fell to 0-3 in the
conference," said co-captain Craig
Rodner '96. As a team the Garnet shot a

With one final practice in the familiar
settings ofthe Tarble Pavilion, the women
took off on a journeyto sunny California.
Arriving in Whittier on January 3, the
women immediately threw down their
bags and made their way to the hotel hottub, where they often returned after hard
practices. For two days they endured
tough double practices at Whittier College.
Friday night the team scouted Whittier,
whom they would face in two days. Traveling to Pasadena the next day, the Garnet blew away Cal Tech 70-23. Leslie
Hermsdorf '97 and Betsy Rosenbaum
'9B both had their season high scoring
nights with 10 and nine points respec-

77-71 victory.
Rodner had the best night of his
Swarthmore career. He scored a careerhigh 22 points while sinking 14 of 16
free-throw attempts. Ben Schall '97 continued to prove he is the team's most
versatile player by contributing 21 points,
seven rebounds, and five assists.
However, the turnaround appeared to
end as quickly as it had arrived. In its next
game the Garnet fell to another conference opponent, Muhlenberg. Despite
leading by 13 at one point in thefirst half
after threeconsecutiveunansweredthreepointers, two by A.J. Shanley '97 and
one by Greeson, the Garnet went cold.
They were outscored 45-28 in the second
half and shot only 23% from the field in
the second half.
Yet in their last two games, the team
has proven it can play consistently well.
Rodner credits therecent success to confidence from the victory over Ursinus on
theroad. "After [the Ursinus] gameI felt
like we were a good team," he said.
What's differentabout this team is that
there are ten players who average at least
ten minutes per game. No matter which
five are on the court at on time there is
little difference in talent or potential.
However, the two players on whom the
team's offense seems to depend are Colin
Convey '97 and Schall. They are tied for
the team lead in steals, and, along with
Rodner, do the majority of the ball handling.
Schall, who struggled with his shot
first semester, has found a groove. Hehas
connected on 30 of 52 shots (58%) this
month. He led the Garnet with 13points,
four rebounds and three assists against
Western Maryland and 23 points, six
rebounds, and five assists against Phar-

attempts.

Another player who has performed
extremely well recently is Bon, who has
elevated his game to a new level this
year. In his past three games he has
grabbed 34 rebounds, half of them on the
offensive boards. He leads the team in
field goal percentage at 49% and in
blocked shots with 16.Although he's the
tallest member of the team at 6'7", he
often faces centers two or three inches
taller. "I love it. It's the most physical
part of the game. You get to bangpeople
around and be banged around. You have
to have an attitude to be able to rebound
against those big guys," he said.

Swat Swimmers Return to Ware Pool
Team escapes "Blizzard

of the Century" with trip to Southern Florida
memory."

By MariaKaufman and
Gerry Kaufman
While the Northeast was suffering
through blizzards, theS warthmoreSwim
Team was suffering through a form of
physicalpunishment far worse thanshov
eling away drifts of melting snow: the
Training Trip.
On January 7, the team headed south
with hopes of sunbathing and dreams of
healthy tans. Instead, the swimmers received sore shoulders, dry skin, large
quantities of ibuprofin, and a dearth of
sunny days.
During the trip, they swam over seven
miles aday..jnore than the average Northeasterner was able to travel by plane,
train, or automobile during the "Blizzard
of 'o^."
During the intense training, the team
competed in an informal meet against a
top-ranked Canadian team from the University of Laval. Swimming against a
teamranked secondinCanada andbuoyed
by five Olympians. The Garnet gained
valuable experience but few victories.
Focusing within, the team assigned "challenge sets" to every member of the team.
Coach Sue Davis praised the team for
their hard work, dedication, and spirited
camaraderie on what she called, "one of
the team's most successful trips in recent
-

Much to the disappointment of the
swimmers, the team had to return to the
frozen, dreary Swarthmore campus last
weekend. As classes resumed, so did the
swim team's regular season, as they
hosted a powerful team from Johns
Hopkins University on Wednesday
evening.
The team faced the swimming powerhouse in a dual in which even the coaches
found themselves in the water. The
women (9-0) triumphed 110-95 to preserve their undefeated record. The men
(6-2) were not so fortunate falling 13261 to arguably the best team they'll face
all year. "The Johns Hopkins meet was
like baking cookies. Sometimes even the
greatest chef drops a pan of fresh-baked
on the ground and then slips on them,"
said JaimeRaich '97.
The women began the meet with an
unexpected win in the 400 medley relay
with the team of Kristen Robertson '9B,
Skye Fulkerson '96, Cathy Polinsky '99,
and Jenny Harvey '99. Harvey then impressed everyone by making the "B" cut
for NCAA Division IJJ Nationals in the
200 Breaststroke.
"Jenny put thenail in the coffin," said
Andy Robbins '9B. Many season bests
were recorded, including outstanding
swims by Ariel Behr '9B in the 50

Freestyle and 200 Backstroke and Kris
Robertson '9B in the 200 Backstroke and
anchoring the 800 Freestyle Relay. Liz
Hallworth '96 andJill Belding '99 showed
their awesome strength in the distance
freestyle events.
The men made a commendable effort,
posting many personal and season bests
as well. Chris "Dude" Seaman '99 had
three personal bests in only two races, the
1000Freestyle (setting a personal best in
the first 500 and the total 1000) and 200
Backstroke.
Raichand Julien Lartigue '97 swam in
their first meet after spending last semester abroad. Both had exceptional first
appearances in the 1000 and 500
Freestyle.

Mark Friedberg '9B had strong finishes in the 400 Individual Medley and
the 500Freestyle. TeammateKim Killeen
'97 praised Friedberg by saying, "He's
like our own version of the Energizer
Bunny!"
Andy "Shaft" Robbins '9B made a
strong showing in the 200 Backstroke,
and Gerry Kaufman '99 began to turn
around a disappointing season with season-best performances in the 500
Freestyle and 400 Individual Medley.
Both teams travel to Dickinson College
on Saturday, and the women host Bryn

streak to six games. Haverford also has a
six-game streak on the line this weekend
when they face Western Maryland. The
Garnet will travel to Haverford on
Wednesday for the first of a pair of games
against its archrivals.
"The reason you play college athletics
is for thesekinds of situations. It's all on
the line the next two weeks and some
teams step it up and some don't. I think
our team has a lotof character which is a
plus for us," said Coach Wimberly.
"This is why all of us play the game,
and we're ready to step up to the plate,"
agreed Rodner. If the impressive victory
over Pharmacy and the blowoutofWestern Maryland are any indicationof what's
to come, the Centennial Conference had
better watch out. Pharmacy had been 142 before their loss to the Garnet.

Inspired by theemotional words of the
coaches, the Garnet now face the rest of
the season with a stronger chemistry that
has increased the intensity of practices.
Despite arriving at the Ursinus College gymnasium only 20 minutes before
game time, the team was able to maintain
their drive and focus and played a stellar
first half. Ahead, at times, by as many as
10points, the Garnet entered the locker
room at the half down by only a few
baskets. In the second half they strove to
regain the lead and, despite a valiant
effort, they ended up losing only 68-60.
Erin Greeson '99 set a career high with

11 points.

The road trip continued as the team
traveled to Western Maryland. After a
slow start, the women trailedby 20 at the
half. In typical fashion the Garnet
outscored their opponent in the second
half 36-33 but could not overcome the
deficit they created in the first half and
lost 73-56. Pia Houseal '97, recently returning from a semester in Scotland, had
a "double-double" with 21 points and 13
rebounds. She was named to the Centennial Conference Honor Roll.
Juanita Wiley '97, who was unable to
accompany her teammates on the trip to
California, returned to join her teammates against Muhlenberg on Wednesday. Although the team overall had a
poor night and lost 73-40, there were
some individuals who stood out with
impressive play.
Nancy Rosenbaum '96 had a spectacular "triple-double" with 13 rebounds,
11 points, 10 steals. Houseal added nine
points and eight rebounds, while Jean
Quinn '99, shooting 80% from the free
throw line, had seven rebounds and six
points. The team continued its dominance of the boards by outrebounding
their opponent 43-37 holding the Mules
to only seven offensive boards.
Saturday the Garnet hostFranklin and
Marshall College at 3:00 in the Tarble

Pia, back at Swarthmore after spending last semester in Scotland,
played two great games last week, chalking up double-doubles in a pair
of road losses. Against Drew on January 16, she had 11 points and 11
rebounds. Four days later, at Western Maryland, Pia had 21 points and 13
rebounds—all this accomplished with a 6'4" woman guarding her!
Together with captain Nancy Rosenbaum, they form one of the best
rebounding duos in the league. Pia is a true center and a very physical
presence, thus filling two roles the team desperately needed filled. She
brings experience to a team with six first year players. "What is so
impressive about Pia is that, despite the fact that she spent last semester
abroad, she was able to step right in and led the team. She has been a
catalyst for all of us offensively," said teammate Leslie Hermsdorf '97

Athletes of the Week

The team as a whole had a career night
totaling 59 rebounds, 20 assists, and 20
steals. Many Swarthmore alumni in California supported their alma mater at the
game and generously hosted an intimate
reception afterwards.
The trip was not limited to basketball.
The Garnet made an early morning excursion to Beverly Hills and Hollywood.
Although all the stores on Rodeo Drive
were closed, they were able to see the
Regent Beverly Wilshire, made famous
in the smash hit, "Pretty Woman." The
players were able to sample a wide variety offoods fromcookiesand carrotjuice
to organically grown strawberries from a
farmer's market. Hollywood was disappointingly "touristy" but the "Walk of
Stars" and theChineseTheater were highlights of the trip.
Against Whittier College that night,
the Garnet put up a strong fight but ultimately lost 58-31. Furthermore, the next
morning after departing the Whittier
Hilton, they arrived at the airport to find
their flight canceled.
With theflight indefinitelypostponed,
the team was forced to remain at thehotel
where they stayed in shape working out
in the fitness room and relaxed by the
pool in record high 86 degree weather.
They finally made it out on the "red eye"
flight to Philadelphia on Tuesday night.
After returning safely to Swarthmore,
the women were back in action preparing
to face the Red Devils from Dickinson
College that Saturday. Falling short of
victory 66-51, the Garnet were satisfied
with a strong second half performance.
Captain Nancy Rosenbaum '96 led the
team with 22 points and 17 rebounds and

Emily Walker '96 snagged eight boards.
Rosenbaum earned a spot on the Centennial Conference Honor Roll for her efforts.
Three days later the Garnet were on
the road to Drew University where they
lost 62-46. On the long ride back to
Swarthmore, the team members talked
about how to pull together and play as a

Jeff has been sidelinedby two major knee injuries that severely limited
his first two seasons. Returning to action in January, he has made an
immediate impact, being named to the All-Tournament team of the
Greyhound Converse Classic in his first appearances of the season..
"The fact thathe was able to overcome his second knee injury andbattle
back into the line-up is a testamentto his persistance, desireand toughness.
But whathehas accomplished since his return has been truly remarkable,"
said co-captain Matt Grossman. Jeff is averaging eight points and three
rebounds per contest while shooting nearly 50% from the field and in his
three-point attempts. Jeff is both a force to be reckoned with in thepaint
and a tremendous three point shooter.

This year's Swarthmore wrestling team
seems tobefollowed by misfortune. Point
in case: Adrian Wilson '99, already
renownedfor his sleeping prowess, found
out that he really does not like to sleep
that much, but rather is just plain sick—with what, the doctors have yet to determine. Jason Sturm '97 suffers from an
elbow injury, and Alec Stall '9B, while
still wrestling, nurses a knee injury. SeniorCurtisTrimble's injuries have pulled
him off the mat for the third season in a
row. The team has also been hit by the
old-fashioned flu and will probably be
missing several members of its already
short line-up in the coming weeks.
Swarthmore's wrestlers suffered

through two tournaments and a match at
Lebanon Valley during their winter
"break." Able to fill only seven of ten
weight classes, Swarthmore lost what
would haveotherwise been a very close
match to Lebanon Valley, 30-10. Highlights of that match included a strong
performance from newcomer Noam
Unger '99. Bryce Walker '97 also continues to improve and proves the most
entertaining wrestler of the bunch. For a
detailed story of Bryce's latest escapade
contact any wrestler: it is well worth
hearing.
Both MattKahn '99 and Elijah Porter
'99 continue to make steady progress
rehabilitating knee injuries. Tirian Mink
'9B returned to the mat from a shoulder
injury incurred late last semester with his
usual fire and enthusiasm. The team
welcomed the much awaited arrival of
Aaron Hoffman '9B who hopefully will

get in shape quickly and fill the 126pound category. lowegian Pete Balvanz
'96 continues to lead the team in both
wins and team points with an 8-2 record
and 28 team points. Pete also turned in a
stellar performance over the break, losing only one match to Division I Duke
university and taking second place at the
Swarthmore Invitational. Close on his
heals, Stall posts a 6-6 record and 21
team points.
The team's normally extensive training trip was reduced to four days in
Canada, and, in its place, twice-daily
practices were held the preceding week.
The competition in Canada, while not
coming in formal matches, was fierce.
Swat grapplers had the opportunity to
whup-up on no less than three members
of the Canadian Olympic team while
training on the campus at McMaster
University in Hamilton, Ontario. Possibly more important, the team really
seemed to get in thatever-valuable bonding. The most telling example is the
mental pictureI retain of the twelve ofus
huddling outside of Tailgate Charlie's in
torrential rain trying to determine who
had the best ID for Adrian, who was
under-aged, but non-alcohol consuming.
As it turns out Tirian did. Thank goodness for bad lighting. Also of bonding
value on the trip was the time spent in the
135 degree dry-heat of the sauna at

McMaster. Though they are hotter than
Hades, saunas lend themselves to great
comradeship and great storytelling.
Swarthmore wrestlers travel to
Gettysburg this Saturday for a conference quad meet. Next Thursday the
matmen will put on their show for
Haverford and LaSalle at 4:3opm.
