Members of the college grounds staff worked yesterday to clear snow from footpaths and roads.

Record snowfall blankets campus
BY LINDA HOU

rhoul@swarthmore.edu

The second largest snowstorm in
Pennsylvania's history swept through the
region last weekend, causing Worth
Health Center to close as well as cancella-

tions and postponement of various student
events. According to the Philadelphia
Inquirer, not only was this weekend's

snowstorm the second largest snowstorm
in Pennsylvania's history but this also
marks the snowiest winter ever recorded

in Pennsylvania.

A second snowstorm began Tuesday
evening and continued yesterday. At the
time of publication, the National Weather
Service predicted that there would be at

least another foot of snow.
Several campus events were cancelled,
including an Olde Club performance, a

Dapper Dining event and a men's and
women's doubleheader basketball game
against John Hopkins University.
Despite these cancellations, the college
will keep to its policy of not cancelling
classes.

"Students live on campus and can manage coming to class in the snow. Many faculty live very close to campus and typically can also come to class in the snow,"
Registrar Martin Warner said in an e-mail
"That said, everyone should keep in mind
that shuttle vans will likely be delayed or
not run at all, so it might be best for students to stay on our beloved campus in
snowy weather."
Yesterday, however, the college was
closed for all employees classified as "nonessential," according to the college's website. The website said that "employees classified essential should report as directed
by their supervisor."
Sharpies Dining Hall and Worth Health

Center were open yesterday.
On Saturday, however, Worth was
closed because the nurse working that day
could not get to the college given the traffic conditions. Director of Student Health
Services Beth Kotarski said that this was
not a big problem and no students were

affected by the closing of Worth, noting
that no students stayed overnight.
"We felt like even if the students were
sick, we wouldn't have wanted them to go
through the snow anyways. We would've
liked them to call the nurse on call,"
Kotarski said.
During the time that Worth was closed
on Saturday night, Kotarski said that two
students went to the hospital. Kotarski
declined to comment on what they went to
the hospital for, but said, "We wouldn't
have done anything other than send those
students to the hospital as soon as possible" even if the health center had been
open.
Although Sharpies was open as usual,
the snack bar was closed on both Saturday

Wednesday, and silverware at
Sharpies was replaced with plastic over
the weekend. Dining Services Director
Linda McDougall said that although
Sharpies generally has a staff of 33 on
Saturdays, there were only 13 to 17 staff
members last Saturday, with some staff
working from 6:30 a.m. to 7:45 p.m.
McDougall said that in preparation for the
snowstorm, Sharpies bought paper backup plates in advance and tried to get 90
percent of the food deliveries a day early.
Vice President for Facilities and
Services Stuart Hain said that, in preparation for snow days, both Sharpies and
grounds staff stay overnight in various
places on campus as a part of snowstorm
plan. Although most of the Sharpies staff,
including some who live 20 miles away,
were able to come to work, there also were
many who couldn't.
"Some of the people who work in the
dining hall are from the intermediate unit,
and they're students with disabilities, and
we don't generally make them come,"

and

Hain said.
Hain added that on Tuesday night, six
Sharpies staff and six grounds staff members stayed overnight at the Ashton
House, the College guesthouse, in anticipation for the snow. Hain said that in the
past, they have stayed over at various
empty houses on campus.

February 11, 2010

The six grounds staff members plowed
the paths overnight. During overnight
snowstorms, the grounds staff cleans the
paths from student dorms to the dining
hall first. For snowstorms that occur in
the daytime, the staff clears the paths from
dorms to academic buildings first.
Nicole Lewis, a ground staff member,
said that the staff worked overtime over

the weekend and will probably continue to
work until late today.
"Today we're working until at least dinnertime," Lewis said. "Normally, we get
off at 3:30 p.m.... But today we'll stay until
we get the job done."
Both the Public Safety-run evening
campus shuttles and the Student Budget
Committee-run campus, movie and Media
shuttles were all shut down during the

snowstorms.
SBC Manager Simon Zhu said that
because the SBC shuttles are driven by
students and not professional drivers,
many request to not drive during snow
days. Further, the SBC shuttle coordinator
will also make the decision to stop driving
when the roads are dangerous.
Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Inquirer
said that Saturday's storm caused SEPTA
to implement a new policy to close routes
in bad conditions.
SEPTA was closed during both snowstorms.
The college is not alone in dealing with
the snow. Swarthmore Borough Manager
Jane Billings estimates that the borough
spent $5,000 to $6,000 in snow removal last
weekend. The snow also caused most
shops at the Ville to close. By 1 p.m. on
Wednesday, Cheng Hing was the only
restaurant open in the Ville, and it
remained open during both storms. The
only other places open were the Bryan
Lentz office, the pawn shop and the post
office, which closed at 3 p.m.
"This [snow] was significant because it
came on the weekend. Saturdays are usually important business days, so having a
storm on the weekend is really bad for the
shops," Director of Swarthmore Town
Center Marty Spiegel said.

Swarthmore inn plans
remain at a standstill

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY ALLISON GANTT

aganttl@swarthmore.edu

College representatives are still
discussing plans to build an inn for
the town, but the economic downturn
and lack of necessary project leaders
have limited the college's action.
Stuart Hain, vice president for

facilities and services, said that the
inn project will likely be a topic of discussion during the next Swarthmore
College Board of Managers meeting
on Feb. 19.
One of the board's responsibilities
is to develop and implement long-term
plans for college property construction.
"I doubt there will be any decisions
but there will be more conmade
versations about what the possibilities are," Hain said.
Janet Semler, director of planning
and construction, recently attended
meetings with SEPTA, the borough

"Regardless of how quickly the
money comes together, we feel it's
important to make sure that we are
talking to all of these different constituencies and
that the project can
work successfully as a bridge between
all these different entities," Semler
said.
The college has also been sure to
keep Swarthmore Labor Action
Project informed of the inn project's
status. Hain said that he updated a
group representative before winter
break, and that they are currently
communicating via e-mail.
"In the last conversation, we said
we really weren't going anywhere,
and there was nothing more for them
to do at that point," he said.

really putting energy to organizing
around something that at this
moment is so on the backburner,"
said Megan Long 'l2, a member of

SLAP.
SLAP plans to keep an eye on the
inn's progress, and one member, Dani
Noble 'l2, currently sits on a sub-committee within the board of managers
that is responsible for researching
feasibility and options for the inn.
SLAP wants to ensure that the
development contract, when and if it
is signed, includes provisions for
labor union rights for potential hotel
employees.
The college had a developer for the
inn project in 2007, but as of the summer of 2009 that developer is now a
developmental consultant "not working directly on the project anymore,"

Hain said.
This decision was not connected to
the summer's.budget cuts.
While still on board, the developer
recommended a hotel operator. Hain
said that discussions with the operator have continued, but no deals have
been made.Several blockades exist for the inn
project at this point. "I think the economy is the single biggest factor for
why we haven't gotten farther along,"

February 11, 2010

Hain said. "But we're not on a main
highway and we're not in a big town,
so this is a challenging project."
Mayor Rick Lowe said that some
Swarthmore community members
have also expressed concern that college entrepreneurial ventures in the
Ville could hurt existing businesses.
"I'm hopeful that it will do the
opposite, which is attract more people
to come to Swarthmore
so it will be
a benefit for everybody," Lowe said. "I
think that the future of the college
and the future of the town are tied at
the hip."
Progress on the project has depended largely upon interaction between
the college and borough in years past.
Currently, the college is responsible
for further action.
"The borough has a fairly limited
role now. They've made the provisions. They've made the opportunity
available," Hain said, referring to the
zoning ordinance approved in 2008
and the liquor license granted in 200 L
The borough, however, still has a
lot to offer when the college is ready
to move forward. Semler cited the

other public funding options as valuable resources for the construction

process.
"We really do feel fortunate that

that the project
the college is here
really benefit [community
members] and [the college itself],"
Jane Billings, Borough Manager, said.
Once the planning is complete and
the funding is found, construction
could take place in as little as 18
months, Semler said.
"We are trying to figure out what
to do next," Hain said. "We're everywhere and nowhere."
SLAP is comfortable with the inn
project's current progress. "I think
...

would

that
it really could be something
very useful for* the town and the college," Long said. "I think right now,
however, it would be a terrible mistake for the school to move forward
with it
because so many areas of
...

...

the school with budget cuts are just

suffering."
The inn project is not the only revitalizationidea for the college and borough, though it is the "most ambitious," Billings said.
Currently, there are three primary
initiatives to more closely link college
students with the community: the
construction of an inn, a restaurant

and a new bookstore.
"I hope that if the plans for the inn
don't go forward right away that they
still do something with the bookstore," Lowe said.
Though none of these projects take
priority over the others, Semler said
that "some parts of [the plan] will proceed along independent paths depending on how the funding becomes available."

Semler added that prior plans had
included additional retail space and
condominiums, but economic concerns have pared the main focuses
down to the aforementioned three.
"At this point, we're looking at a
pretty simple development," Semler
said.

College Dems support Lentz
BY LINDA HOU
rhoul@swarthmore.edu

Natalie Litton 'l2 was one of many Swarthmore
students who helped Democrat Bryan Lentz defeat a
28-year Republican incumbent to become the
Pennsylvania State House Representative for
Delaware County in 2006. Litton, now president of
College Democrats, will be working for Lentz again
this semester for his campaign to be the U.S. House
Representative for Pennsylvania's 7th congressional

district.

Lentz was on campus last Thursday to speak to
students about his campaign.
House
Joe Sestak, the current U.S.

Representative, will be leaving the seat vacant in his
efforts to overtake Arlen Specter in the upcoming
Senate primary.
"I think it's great for both Swarthmore College
Democrats and the community to have him here,
and that's something that Bryan knows because he
has an office right down in the Ville," Litton said,
referring to his office on Park Street.
Lentz, an Iraq War veteran and a graduate of
Temple University, spoke to a group of about 30
attendees last Thursday in Bond Hall on topics such
as the environment, transportation and the national
budget.
He then took questions from students about his
stance on current legislation and issues such as the
army's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which prohibits openly gay citizens from serving in the military. Lentz,said that he believes the policy should be
repealed.
One major focus of Lentz's speech was his advocacy of a high-speed rail system.
"Do we want to live in a country that has a second-rate transportation system?" Lentz said in his
speech. "Fifty percent of the' flights [from
Philadelphia] are to places within 500 miles those
50 percent of people can go on a high speed rail... yet
in China, where much of the place is rural, they
have high speed rail that goes 300 miles per hour."
Lentz also spoke in support of stopping the war
in Iraq and increasing healthcare coverage, noting
that a big problem of balancing the national budget
is the heavy cost of the war.
In addition to his comments on specific issues,
Lentz spoke of his theories on how government
should work and said that he would like to have
more progress in government.
"In your lifetimes, you have probably grown to
think of government as something that doesn't get
anything done. In your lifetimes, there's nothing big
...

that's been done in the government. And I think
that's a problem," Lentz said.
This problem, according to Lentz, is in part due
to the wish for the maintenance of the status quo by
large corporations, which are giving large sums of
money to Republican politicians.

New group to address immigrant education issues
Jusselia Molina 'l3 came to Swarthmore
because of its reputation as an ethically
conscious institution and hoped to learn
how to help others. Now in her second
semester at the college, Molina, along with
Jovanna Hernandez 'l3 and Evelyn Fraga
'l3, has already started her work in social

justice.

The three students formed the DREAM
Act Coalition, a group that plans to lobby
for the passage of the Development, Relief
and Education for Alien Minors Act.
"We're really hoping that we get support on campus," Molina said. "We're not

asking they believe in everything, just
keep an open mind."
Currently, it is difficult for many undocumented students to afford a college education because they have to pay out-of-state
tuition and are not eligible for student

The act would give legal status to the

children of illegal immigrants while they
are in college or in the military and would
allow them to take out student loans,
though not federal grants, if they meet a

certain set of criteria.
"This is not an issue of immigration; it's
an issue Of education," Molina said.
"Education is a human right, and children
who have grown up here

the country to exploit the act.
Illinois Senator Dick Durbin introduced
the bill in 2007 and again in 2009, but it
failed to pass both times.
The group's ultimate goal is for
President Rebecca Chopp to come out in
support of the act. They would like her to
write a letter to Congress as well as to

and know

America as their country shouldn'tbe punished because they didn't have a choice in
how they came here."
The bill requires that its beneficiaries
have been in the United States for at least
five years prior to the enactment of the bill,
that they were under 16 when they entered
the country and that they have never been

deported.

These criteria are intended to prevent a
flood of new illegal immigrants from enter-

Pennsylvania senators. This would add
Swarthmore to the list of colleges and universities, including Harvard, Yale, Tufts
and Notre Dame, who have publicly
endorsed the bill.

The coalition also wants student
involvement, both at the Tri-Co level and
individually.

"We would like for students to write to
their senators. We have students at Swat
from all 50 states, so we'd like to reach all
the senators," Hernandez said.
The group hopes to become a true coalition by uniting with other organizations
such as the Intercultural Center, the Black
Cultural Center, Students for a Democratic
Society and College Democrats.
"We think it's really important that the
college students can unite to show
Congress it's important to us," Hernandez
said.
Members of the DREAM Act Coalition
have not yet approached any of these

organizations.
At the group's first meeting on Tuesday,
members discussed other plans, including
possibly having a table at Ride the Tide,
bringing in lecturers, having a rally and
screening movies.
They have many ideas but few concrete
plans.
"We're seeking advice from upperclasspeople and faculty about how activism
works at Swat," Molina said.
The group's mentor is Rafael Zapata,

assistant dean and director of the
Intercultural Center. Zapata, who is also

"I'm playing more of an advisory role
for them," Zapata said. "They're bringing
an incredible amount of energy and power
to this issue. I'm just trying to support
them. I'm working to help them achieve

their goals."
Zapata is also reaching out to his con-

tacts in New York and Washington, D.C.
"I'm trying to identify people who have
some expertise about this law and the
process that's impeding this progress. As
we see with healthcare, it's really tough to
get some controversial things pass," he
said.

The students are interested in this issue
in part because of their personal connections to people who would be aided by the
passage of the bill.
"We all know someone who's suffering,"
Hernandez said.
Fraga agreed.

Student conference redefines LGBT movement
BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu

Hundreds of high school and

college students and community

organizers from all across the
nation came together last Tuesday
in Dallas, Texas to promote the
Gay Bisexual
Lesbian
and
Transgender social justice movement at the annual Creating
Change Conference. Among this
group were Anjali Jaiman 'lO,
Watufani Poe 13 and Luis Penate
'l3, all three of whom are current
members of Swarthmore's COLORS, a closed campus group for
queer students of color.
The conference started in 1988.
Sponsored

and organized by

the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, it aimed to drive the
focus of participants towards the
intersectionality between LGBT
issues and other forms of discrimination, including race, socioeconomic status, religion and disability.

*

"A lot of times, I've had to
wrangle with the fact that I feel
like sometimes my race clashes
with my sexual orientation," said
Poe, who, like Penate, was a firsttime attendee at the conference
and was introduced to this gathering by Jaiman, who participated
last year. "At the conference, I got
to learn that the intersectionality
between race and sexual orienta-

6

tion was not as clashing as I had

viewed before."
After applying

and subsequently receiving funding from
Fierce, an organization based in
New York City dedicated to' shaping young leaders in the LGBT

movement, these three students
participated in a variety of workshops at the conference aimed at
building their leadership and
organization skills.
Topics of these discussionbased
workshops
include

and 1970s consisting of AfricanAmericans who aimed to spread
Black Nationalism, said Penate.

Accessibility

Organizers of particular workshops established ground rules
before each discussion to facilitate the positive flow of ideas. For
example, in the Black Panther
workshop, there were three rules:
being open, no judging each other
or the Black Panther movement
itself, and stepping up then stepping back to allow for equal participation.

The three students said that
not once did they feel as if their
voices were suppressed by other
attendees.

"In most of the workshops I
went to, I felt very candid and felt
like there wasn't judgment
towards me because there's this
sense that these people were coming together on issues that they
cared about; they were going to
these workshops because they
care about politicizing their identities and activism," Poe said.
This year, the conference was
more diverse than in previous
years, Poe said.
This was an intentional choice

made by Fierce and the National
Task Force in order to highlight
the importance of diversity on all
levels in the LGBT movement. For

the most par£ this diversity

allowed for the free expression of
a wide range of ideas and opinions, Poe said.
"One thing that I'm always
faced with is at the conference
there are people coming from
very different backgrounds who
understand their LGBT identity
very differently and make connections with other identities,"
Jaiman said.
Instead of just identifying oneself in terms of race, class, gender
and sexuality, Jaiman realized
that there were other lines along
which LGBT people strongly identified, such as able-bodiedness and
immigrant status. The characterization of these identities sparked

discussions of disability and

immigrant reform throughout the
conference.

The diversity of the people at
the conference also exposed the
three students to new ways of
approaching the LGBT social

movement.
"I went in with pretty set ideas
of what the queer movement was
and the conference definitely
opened my eyes to the idea of
becoming more progressive and

more radical and more inclusive
of other people," Penate said.
Near the end of the conference,
Penate and his colleagues sat in
on a panel of LGBT youth of Color
that stressed the value of understanding the obscure issues that
are sometimes suppressed by the

mainstream movement. Certain
matters such as immigration
reform, homelessness, sex education and HIV/AIDS as related to
LGBT issues were brought into

focus.

"In my opinion, mainstream
LGBT organizing is pretty white
and pretty middle class and the
issues are not relevant to a lot of
people's lives, particularly young
people, because the focus is on
marriage or 'Don't ask, Don't
tell,'" Jaiman said.

Tension arose in the panel,
however, when some aggravated
members of mainstream organizations, those that are most prevalent in the media, got up and left

during the middle of a panel, said

Jaiman.

For all three Swarthmore par-

ticipants, the most memorable
part of the Creating Change
Conference took place on the last
days when they attended a workshop hosted by Vogue Evolution, a

dance group that competed on
MTV's America's Best Dance
Crew. "They come out of this
thing called 'house ball culture' in
New York City where vogueing
kind of came into being," Jaiman

said. "They were talking about
to do outreach about
HIV/AIDS to queer people of color
in New York City and how you do
that through art and dance."
Vogueing, a type of modern
dance .that incorporates model-'
like poses, is widespread in the
gay ballroom scene in major cities
across the country. On the very
last day of the conference, Vogue
Evolution treated participants of
the conference to an energy-rich
how

dance performance.
Having attended this conference, Poe and Penate, both members of Student Council, hope to
use some of the leadership and

organization skills they acquired
to promote more activism across
the campus and to encourage
more freedom of expression.
"We need to fight for what's
right," Poe said. "We need to fight
against oppression anywhere."

popular
topic recently,
starting

with
Stephenie
Meyer's

"Twilight" book series and expanding into
TV shows, movies and even clothing lines.
These fanged critters have seemingly been
everywhere, be it frolicking around southern towns in "True Blood" or dressing up
in their gothic best for the "New Moon"
opening at your local mall. Robert
Pattinson, the star of the movie incarnations of Meyer's series, apparently can't go
out in public without being groped by
hordes of young female "Twihards."
Clearly, things have gotten out of hand.
The key to the vampires' recent popularity seems to be the sexualized nature of

their representations. Vampires have been
around for awhile, in "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" and the "Blade" series to name a
few, but they didn't really seem to take off
as a trend until they started being portrayed as the good guys and played by
Hollywood heartthrobs. That's not to say
that vampires haven't been traditionally
sexualized since Dracula, but never to
quite the same extent as today. Maybe it's
just because most women don't seem to
share my love of Wesley Snipes; personally,
I think it has more to do with the fact that
they've been un-monstered, turned into figures of both compassion and sexual desire
in ways that they hadn't been before. Sure,
the vampires in Buffy or Blade were often
sexy, but the respective protagonists were
always ultimately above their seduction,
and more likely to kick their asses than
sleep with them (with some notable exceptions in Buffy's case). And while there are

still' "bad" vampires

in Twilight and the

like, they are not represented as monstrous
as much as they are superhuman, capable
of being good or bad just like any other

character.
All of this being said, the vampire
seems to have reached his heyday. We've
been entertained for a bit, we've enjoyed
making fun of people who take the trend
too seriously, and now we're ready to move
on. The real question is this: What will be
next? Vampires were preceded by many
other cultural trends, pirates and zombies
being arguably among them, so logically a
new one will foUow. The subject in question will probably be mythological in some
way. It will definitely be sexualized. So
what will it be?
An obvious option is werewolves.
Already embedded within the vampire
rhetoric, werewolves could start a craze of
their own with just an easy shift from supporting role into the spotlight. We even
have our heartthrob:-Taylor Lautner's
werewolf character from Twilight, who
comes already equipped with hordes of
"Team Jacob" supporters, who somehow
seem to think that they can retroactively
influence which guy the girl is going to
choose in a series of books that have
already been written. With more werewolf
movies and shows reportedly on the way,
these furry guys seem to already be the
shoe-in successors. The only issue? The
reality of werewolves just isn't that sexy.
Sure, Taylor Lautner looks good with his
shirt off, but he also looks distinctly hairless, too. I haven't seen how the movies
handle his man-to-wolf transitions yet, but
I can't imagine it being particularly pretty.
Werewolves are traditionally snarly and
ugly, and I don't see that changing anytime

soon.

Personally, I think that leprechauns are
some time in the spotlight. As a redhead of Irish descent, I've
always had a soft spot for the little guys,
plus there are all kinds of old Irish faerielore that could be incorporated in with
them. Leprechauns certainly haven't been
overdone; I can't remember the last time
they even appeared in popular culture,
aside from that Disney Channel made-forTV movie "The Luck of the Irish" from

leprechauns are probably not sexy enough
They are

known to be short and bearded, and current lumberjack-chic trend aside, I'm not
really seeing that aesthetic coming into
style.
So, what mythical creature is adequately sexualized to please the over stimulated
masses of today? If sex really is the key,
then a plausible option would be centaurs.
Brawny, virile and traditionally rumored
to be rapists, these guys could compete
with vampires for most active sex life any
day. There could potentially be a gender
issue here: Centaurs are typically represented as men, and this could create issues
for those who shy from interspecies intercourse, but the bikini-clad female centaurs
from Fantasia could probably cure that
pretty quickly. And while I mostly find
horse-people to be a bit creepy, there certainly seems to be a large portion of the
population who may .or may mot have a
mild horse-fetish. Another related possibility: unicorns. Do I really need to point out
why

those are sexual?

carey

February 11, 2010

My readers may stop taking me seriously after this, but I'm just going to throw one
more possibility out there: Bigfoot. Sure,
laugh away, but I think I'm onto something
here. He fits all the archetypes already set
out by the vampires in Twilight: He's a

loner, he likes romantic forest getaways
and he's probably pretty socially awkward,
which for some reason people seemed to
find endearing in Edward from Twilight.
He's tall, which solves the problem we had
with leprechauns, and his appeal to footfetishists might give him the edge that
today's over-sexed media demands. Sure,
he's hairy, but chest hair is due for a comeback anyway.
So those are some of my speculations as
to what will replace vampires in popular
culture. Like an heir-apparent, one of them
shall surely soon be ascending to the
throne of silver screen and television stardom, because the vampire's reign is up.
Skeptical of my predictions? Just you wait;
sexy-Sasquatch is going to have an HBO
series any day now.

My top is actually also from
Urban," Nairne said, "which is interesting because I usually don't wear this much Urban." She bought her jacket,
which is by Identity, at Loehmann's. "It's a really comfy
leather jacket." Her silver necklace is from one of her
trips to Ghana. "I actually got it the first time I went to
Ghana," she said, adding that most of her jewelry fs
either from Ghana or Tiffany's.
Nairne's semi-monochromatic outfit is very reminiscent of Alexander Wang's Fall 2009 collection. The prominence of black, leather, knits and form-fitting tops and
bottoms on the models can be seen in Nairne's great
leather jacket and knit skirt. It's edgy, yet sophisticated;
it's neutral in color, but strong in statement.
...

Salvation Army stores with eclectic
items, and Nairne also loves shopping
at Beacon's Closet. On the Upper East
Side, she browses through Michael's,
which is where most of the wealthy people sell their designer clothing. "It's a

really great way to get really high quality stuff, but you don't have to pay the full
price for a designer piece," she said. "You
can get [clothes] way, way cheaper, but it's
still a designer piece so it's really cool."
Favorite Item Her Closet:
"I would say my leather jacket," Nairne
said, adding that it's become a part of her
identity (funny, since the brand is Identity).
"I wear it all the time. I'm sort of obsessed
with it." she said, "People come up to me and
are like, 'Yeah, I know you by your leather
jacket.'" In addition to being very stylish, she
commented on how comfortable the jacket is.

How She Describes Her Style:
"I'd probably describe it as urban preppy," Nairne
*said. Her wardrobe consists of mainly black and neutral
clothing. "In New York, everyone wears blacks and neutrals, so it's more normal to me," she said. Nairne also
added that her style combines the classic prep with an

"updated, New York edge."

Fashion Influences, Inspirations, Style Icons:
Nairne's friend's mother is Karen Alexander, who
was a supermodel and on the Jan. 1989 cover of Vogue
magazine. "She has such amazing style," Nairne said, "so
it's sort of influenced both me and my mom's style."
Alexander modeled for Ralph Lauren, the quintessential
and classic American brand. "[Her style is] very preppy,
but she also updates it in sort of an urban way," Nairne
said, "so I think that influenced me."
Nairne definitely finds inspiration from living in New
York. "Just walking down the street, I always see people
wearing something I think is really awesome," she said.
New York also is l|gme to many flagship stores of designers and international brands. "You see outfits that you
wouldn't normally see in just one of the chain stores,"
she said. "There's a flagship J.Crew that has a New York
spin on J.Crew so it's preppy and New York-y. I love
being able to see that."

BY JOHN OH
joh2@swarthmore.edu
On Friday, Feb. 12, highly trained ninjas dressed in black
will run rampant all over the Swarthmore campus, with the
sole intent of delivering Valentine's cards to lovers, friends
and professors.
Ninja Grams are handmade Valentine's cards delivered
to students by ninjas in dramatic and comedic ways. For $3,
students can purchase a Ninja Gram from a table at the top
of Sharpies during lunch or dinner. For an additional dollar,
you can attach a chocolate truffle made by Ninja Gram
organizer Philip Chodrow 'l2 and a team of ninja student

volunteers.
Sales will run through Thursday lunch and dinner. The
deliveries range from a standard delivery, where one ninja
might run through a class room and deliver the card, or a
special delivery, which might look like a whole group of ninjas having a showdown in the middle of class before delivering the card to the recipient.

Another type of special delivery is "ninsurance," which
sells for an additional $3. Ninsurance is a special type of
delivery that was started up in 2008: One ninja starts by trying to attack the recipient of the ninja gram, while the second ninja defends and defeats the attacking ninja just in
time to save the day. All Swarthmore professors are given
free ninsurance.
In one Ninja Gram delivery, Swarthmore choir director
and music professor Charles Alston found himself the victim
of the ninjas during choir rehearsal. Alston was befuddled
by his choir's lack of attention as a group of six ninjas
stealthily crept up behind him. Alston was shocked to find
them delivering a Ninja Gram in the middle of his choir
rehearsal, but it was a great laugh for the rest of the choir.

rebuild Haiti

The ninja team is comprised of student volunteers who
are trained by G Patrick 10. For several meetings in Shane
Lounge in Parrish, Patrick teaches these ninjas to be sneaky
and stealthy; in short, the art of the successful Ninja Gram

delivery.
"The training is a vigorous trial of strenuous tests that
examine their mind, consciousness, subconscious, heart,
body and brain," Patrick said.
As much as this seems like a real-life version of "The
Karate Kid," Chodrow said that "delivering Ninja Grams is
almost like improv comedy. The ninjas need to be stealthy,
but it's all about the fun of watching a random ninja jump up
from a window or jump through a class room door yelling
'NUIINJA GRAM!'" Delivering ninja grams is a fun and
entertaining gig for both the messenger and the receiver.
The history of Ninja Grams dates back to James Mendez
Hodes 'OB, who, legend has it, was a ninja who practiced the
sacred art of ninjutsu. Hodes, who often goes by his middle
name, was a "wacky guy, but in the best sense possible,"
according to Chodrow. The tradition of Ninja Grams started
on Valentine's Day 2006, continuing throughout 2007 and
2008, but the tradition was abruptly terminated after Hodes's
graduation. It was started up again this year with the purpose of sending donations to the Haiti Community Support,

instead becomes filled with conspiracy theories. My conversations become incomprehensible to anyone without a detailed
knowledge of the Dharma Initiative and the
Widmore Corporation. I sleep less, and the
sleep I do get is riddled with feverish
dreams of polar bears and four-toed statues.
I start delving into the many-worlds theory
with a zeal that impresses even my physicist boyfriend. In short, I get totally "Lost."
The premiere of the final season of
ABC's trippy drama about a group of castaways whose plane crashes on a mysterious
island was notable both for its changed
timeslot (thank you, "Lost" gods, for hearing that I had seminar on Wednesdays from
7:00-10:00) and for a true mindfuck of a twist
in which two paraUel timelines were established after a group of castaways led by tormented doctor/wannabe messiah Jack
(Matthew Fox) detonated a hydrogen bomb
back in 1977, hoping to reboot the timeline
and prevent their plane from crashing thirty years in the future.
In one timeline, that same group of castaways wakes up on the Island in the present day, with complete memories of their

10

failed plan, and in the middle of a war
between the (seemingly) benevolent deity
Jacob and the malicious Man in Black, who
can also manifest as the Smoke Monster
and who currently occupies the body of
John Locke (and who will hereafter be
known as FLocke, short for Fake Locke, in
order to alleviate confusion). In the other
timeline, however, the castaways land in
L.A. in 2004 and go on their merry way.
Well, sort of.
The brilliant (not to mention puzzling)
aspect of the second timeline is that things
aren't the same as they were the first time
around. These changes range from small
but significant (flight-attendant-turnedOther Cindy gives Jack one extra vodka
instead of two) to large and presumably still
significant (Desmond is on the plane?
Shannon isn't?!) to holy-shit-I-can't-believethey-did-that (If you watch, you know what
I'm talking about).
These changes are, according to co-creator Damon Lindelof, a way of showing
that, in fixating solely on how their lives
would change if they rebooted the timeline,
the castaways neglected to think through
the other consequences of their actions.
According to Lindelof, "[T]hey don't stop to
think, 'lf we do this in 1977, what else is
going to be affected by this?'"
I love this explanation because it brings
all the mythology back down to the human
level, which is what has kept me coming
back to "Lost" for the last six years. If the
show were only about mythology, it wouldn't be nearly as compelling. The human
drama of "Lost" is good enough to temper
the esoteric plot devices and keep the story
grounded in relationships. The two-hour
premiere dug into many relationships, but
to my mind the two most fascinating and
heartbreaking both involved Locke, played
by the truly gifted (and Emmy-winning)
Terry O'Quinn. Well, technically only one
of the relationships involved the real John

Locke, while the other involves FLocke, bu
these are just details.
The more humorous of these two rela

Show choir sparks a fusion of music and dance
swarthmorephoenix.com

Some are gifted with the skill to dance, while others possess the ability to sing. The new campus show
choir, Spark, represents an opportunity for
Swarthmore students who are talented enough to
fuse the talents of song, dance and theatrical showmanship. Co-directors Ashley Banks 'l3 and Maya
Marzouk 'l3 chartered Spark and plan to -hold callback auditions this weekend.
"This is going to be a really exciting experience,"
Banks said. "I think it's just going to be a transitioning, because I know that we are the only current
group on campus that's trying to do this."
Both Banks and Marzouk originally tried out for a
cappella groups, and after neither made any of the
groups, they chose to
in a new direction from that
of the a capella groups in creating Spark. Although
neither Banks nor Marzouk has participated in show
choir in the past, both have found enjoyment in participating in theatrical and musical performance.
Banks has been heavily involved in musical theater
throughout her life. She participates in Drama Board
productions and anticipates the startup of the
Shakespeare company Yellow Stocking this semester. Last semester, she performed in the campus's
production of "Twelfth Night," portraying Sebastien.
Marzouk performed in musicals and operas
throughout high school, and expresses confidence in
the group's abilities. "I'm a little less nervous than I
could be because I trust that the arrangements are
good, and that the members that we will have are
going to be good, and our choreography is going to be
fine," Marzouk said.
Each director will bring her own qualities to the
table as co-director. Marzouk cited her energetic persona as a contributing quality. "I think the best thing
has been that when I get my mind stuck on something I am obnoxiously stubborn about getting it
done," Marzouk said.
Banks believes she can contribute her experience
with showmanship. "There is a difference between
just dancing and dancing for people who are in a specific spot and adding that sort of spark!"
There were initial concerns about getting enough
people to audition for the group, especially male stu
dents. "It was actually really exciting because we
ended up having more guys than we wanted to audition, but about three days before the audition we
only had three," Banks said.
"Now the challenge is having to cut people, especially for callbacks. It's hard because it's mean,"
Marzouk said.
The first round of auditions focused on individual
singing ability, whereas callbacks will showcase students' ability to learn choreography and dance with
the the rest of the group. Michael Fleischmann 'l3
expressed his confidence in his audition. "I've got a
better feeling about this than any of my prior auditions," he said.
Spencer Jones 'l3 anticipates her callback audition and expressed her passion for music. "I'm mostly excited about the singing because I miss it. so
much," she said.
Marzouk explained that the directors look for
someone with good vocal support, but also someone
"who is not afraid to get up on stage and look a little
silly sometimes."
Fourteen of 20 students were asked to return for
callbacks, of which only 10 students will become
members, since Marzouk and Banks will fill two
spots. They have decided on "12 as the magic number," with six boys and six girls, a balance they
sought for their choreography.
Spark has recruited Benjamin Kapilow 'l3 to help
organize arrangements and Abigail Starr 'l3 to help
choreograph the group.
The group will perform a wide range of music
including pieces from musicals, modern songs and
"songs from our childhood."
"It's kind of crazy, but I think [there will be]
things that we can really relate to," Banks said.
The show choir may remind some of the Fox

"method
actor." The
idea of a
"method actor," a person who puts oneself
into situations or calls upon experiences
to prepare for a role, has long been a
source of amusement for Americans. The
idea that a person would relive a personal
trauma or try "slumming it" just to prepare for a role strikes many people as
going a little bit too far.
The American Method, as it should be
more specifically labeled, is a perversion
(albeit a popular one) of its roots, which
are credited to Constantin Stanislavski of
the Moscow Art Theatre. Stanislavski's
innovations were in response to the
demands of Anton Chekhov's new "realist" plays, but he only employed psychological realism, as it is also termed, in his
late work. The version of psychological
realism that Lee Strasberg popularized as
the American Method is far more formal
and in-depth than that of Stanislavski's.
Given the visibility of method acting

and the fact that there are alternatives, it
is perhaps surprising that no other form of
acting is commonly discussed. There are
(including
numerous
alternatives
Stanislavski's earlier style) which are still
in use today,.but the humorous mental
images conjured up by method preparation have surpassed other practices in
terms of recognition. Another problem is
that most actor training styles are intended to make it look effortless, as is the case
with method acting. Finally and most
importantly, it can be quite difficult to distill the work of an actor into a single
method. There is a sharing of techniques
and ideas that naturally occurs. One
would have to look long and hard to find
an actor who only ever used one technique.
Among those other widely used techniques is improvisational theater (or
improv, as it is more commonly known),
popularized by Chicago's "Second City"
troupe and present on Swarthmore's campus in the form of Vertigo-go. Even as
improv has become a viral source of enter-

tainment through YouTube, the population often forgets that it is, in fact, a legitimate acting methodology. It is something
that can be taught, follows rules, requires
practice and can greatly enhance the work
of those actors when they are scripted.
Another approach that has been widely
incorporated into popular culture is physical theater. Jerzy Grotowski advocated
an athletic, communal yet confrontational
(by which I mean theater that disregards
the fourth wall) approach. In particular,
"paratheatrical" work,
Grotowski's.
which involved physically exhausting theatrical benders in the wilderness spanning multiple days, or even weeks, has
impacted the expectations and the perceived limitations of theater. Grotowski
can undoubtedly take some of the credit

for major marathon productions like the
Robert Wilson/Philip Glass collaboration
"Einstein on the Beach," which had a run-

ning time of five hours, and the recent hit
"Gatz," a 7-hour-long reading and performance of "The Great Gatsby."

revival on the stage.
its roots in the Italian
commedia dell'arte, has influenced and
shaped every other style of theater since
its revitalization by Jacques Lecoq in
France. Its combination of intensely physically engaged bodies and mask work
holds great appeal for those who work in
comedy, but its influence extends beyond
the general understanding of clowning.
In addition to filtering its way into the
mainstream through celebrity disciples
like actor Geoffrey Rush and director

Clowning, with

Julie Taymor, who is best known for staging Broadway's "The Lion King", Lecoq's
teachings have resulted in the establishment of full theater companies, including
Philadelphia's (and Swarthmore's) rising
star, Pig Iron Theatre Company.
In an extension of his clowning,
Lecoq's work utilizes another classic acting style, which is just as frequently mimicked as method acting, but which few
people pause to consider as an independent school of acting: mime. The word conjures up images of painted faces, Buster
Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, but it is more
common than most people realize.
Put on your helmets, ladies and gentlemen, because your minds are about to be

blown: while there are still many silent

mimes, nowadays there are quite a few
mimes that make noise and are even occasionally chatty. The taciturn but nonetheless noisy Blue Man Group is just as firmly rooted in mime as the late, great Marcel
Marceau. The San Francisco Mime
Troupe performs original musicals, which
feature the vivid social commentary and
farce elements that stem from commedia
dell'arte and employ vestiges of classical
mime. Another name that may surprise
you is Bill Irwin, who attended Clown
College, co-founded the Pickle Family
Circus and is now performing in "Bye Bye
Birdie."
If these different methodologies strike
you as too intertwined, there are still quite
a few which remain distinct. Farce and
camp, in particular, have managed to
retain independent physical vocabularies
and techniques, and are evident in their
execution, whereas method acting is invisible. The difference between the two very
physical, actively unrealistic styles is in"
their intention. Camp is exaggerated and
comedic, but it is also gaudy and vulgar in
its self-aware comedy. Camp mocks the
performance as it happens, and the skills
required to perform camp are entirely
unique and difficult to achieve.
Farce is exaggerated and comedic, but
it is both simpler and more difficult than
camp. It is simple in the sense that the
physical comedy is reduced to simple gestures and juxtapositions, like the double
take and improbable series of events (for
example, the one person enters just as
another person leaves scenario, which
made "Boeing Boeing" such a success in
2008). It is extraordinarily difficult, however, in the sense that an actor in a farce
can never acknowledge the absurdity of a
situation as a camp performer might. Both
camp and farce require a rigorous level of
training in order to be successful and are
legitimate schools of performance in their
own right.
What all of these methods have in common, however, is that they are perceived

Lee Strasberg trained actor Al Pacino, seen here in "The Godfather II," as a method

as suited to very specific types of plays,
whereas method acting is perceived as
universally applicable. The most noteworthy competition in that category is the
Brechtian school of performance. Bertolt
Brecht is famous for creating an alienation effect; he wanted to keep the audience aware of the fact that they were in a
theater, seeing a performance. What is less
well known about Brechtian performance
is that it involves its own unique school of
acting. A Brechtian actor is demonstrative
but does not internalize the emotions.
While a method actor works from the
inside out, a Brechtian actor simply
shows. The intent of this technique is to
prevent the audience from forming a
strong connection with the actor, but the
technique of creating a purely physical
demonstration of a supposed sentiment
could just as easily be used in Chekhov. In
fact, the detached quality may be an
improvement on some method actors' performances.
Many acting techniques feed into each

other, but the fact of the matter is that it is
difficult to really know what techniques
an actor is employing to prepare for a role
unless you are involved in the rehearsal
process.
Bill Irwin may be a clown, but he has
also played George in the iconic drama
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," Faye
Dunaway may have been phenomenal is
the camp hit "Mommie Dearest," but she
also made a striking Bonnie to Warren
Beatty's Clyde in the 1967 drama/thriller
"Bonnie and Clyde." The fact is that in any
given production, the cast employs a motley set of styles. There are numerous alternatives to the American Method, all of
which are at work and all of which
deserve recognition for their contributions to theater and film. Next time you
are at the theater, ask yourself whether or
not the actors or actresses really needed to
put themselves through hell to prepare for
roles.

Varying expectations impede advising process
Academic advising is an integral part of
Swarthmore culture and is expected to factor into all major academic decisions that
students make. Yet students, faculty and
the administration have different expectations about the advising process, and that
sometimes leads to unsatisfactory experiences and disappointed students. In order
for advising to work, all involved parties
must be on the same page. Students and
advisors should have a common understanding about what might be expected

from them during advising, what students
should know before and about meeting
with their advisor, and what information
students should gather on their own.
As the class of 2012 undergoes sophomore paper advising, many sophomores
are experiencing some of the problems
caused by different expectations about the
role academic advising is supposed to play.
Some expect to simply obtain a signature,
others need confirmation that they are on
track to fulfill distributional requirements,
and yet others want to discuss their postgraduation plans. And despite the current
relevance of sophomore advising concerns,
students in every stage of their four years
at Swarthmore may have frustrating advis-

ing experiences.
The

administration's web

page

on

advising recommends that advising faculty
members get to know students and develop
a personal relationship with them.
Commendably, the dean's office recognizes
that while it "does its best to make a good
match," success depends on "whether the
match
is a good one," "luck" and "a certain amount of effort by both parties." Yet
despite these efforts, too often the match is
...

less than ideal.

Students often need much more than a

simple advisor check confirming that their
plan satisfies distributional requirements.
Many departments, such as the departments of political science and philosophy,
have internal requirements that are far
from straightforward to navigate. Advisors
should be able to guide students through
such complicated scenarios. Advising ses-

sions may also revolve around such questions as which preparations are appropriate for graduate school and which challenging subjects students can explore outside their majors and minors. Many advisors assume that students do not need help
on such matters and do not offer students
the chance to bring them up.

Students must feel empowered to search
out what they want from advising. This
could involve anything from opening a dialogue with one's current academic advisor
to visiting the registrar's office to request
an entirely different professor as one's
advisor. Yet these approaches are sometimes difficult to enact, especially for firstyears who may not know many faculty

members yet. Students come in with different backgrounds and have varying levels
of comfort articulating their advising
needs to faculty. For these reasons we
strongly urge faculty advisors to ask students what they want from advising, and
we urge students to articulate their needs
regardless of whether or not they are

information but also to help them shape
their faculty advisor experience. Student
Academic Mentors, or SAMs, are a particularly helpful resource that students
should continue to turn to for support in
making the best of faculty advising.
It appears that faculty members are not
trained for either sophomore paper or general academic advising. This is unfortu-

nate because such training could prepare
faculty for a variety of student demands.
Harmonizing our various understandings
of academic advising will require both student and faculty effort. If only to alert fac-

ulty members of students' most pressing
advising demands, training faculty for aca-

demic advising could make advising less of
a hit-or-miss process.
We believe that academic advising
should be a valuable experience for all students. The administration's view of an
advising process in which the faculty member and student develop a personal rela-

tionship is worth pursuing. For that to be
the norm, however, the involved parties
must have a clearer understanding of the
possibilities and their obligations in an
advising session.

Shedding light on previous and current revenues

rosier

year's
financial
times.
Spending

just over $100,000,000 dollars requires
bringing in that much money. Where

does that money come from? There are
three major groups of sources and many
minor ones.
Before beginning, please note two cautions. First, because the 2009-2010 fiscal
year is not yet over, there are limits to the
information available on this year's
spending. Both this year's projections
and last year's released information are
used for this column. Unless otherwise
noted, estimations for this year's budget
come from the operating budget released
in May 2009. Secondly, the college's fiscal
year runs from July 1 to June 30 rather
than from September to May with the
academic year.
The largest and most familiar source
category is student charges, including
tuition, room and board and the activity
fee. Included in this category are dollars
from students and their families as well
as those from outside scholarships or
tuition benefits that students use to cover
these costs. These revenues are expected
to bring in $48.2 million and represent 45

14

percent of the college's income. This
year's overall projected revenue from student charges represents a rise in both
absolute (from $46.2 million) and relative
(from 40 percent) terms from last year.
Understanding this number requires
understanding the college's commitment
to financial aid. If every student and his
or her family paid "sticker price" every
year (for the 2009-2010 school year,
$49,600), student charges would bring in
almost $74 million per year. However, as
most students know, just under half of the
student body receives financial aid from
the college. Last year, the average financial aid award for the 49 percent of students receiving aid from Swarthmore

was just over $29,000. This aid is therealization of the college's commitment to
meeting 100 percent of demonstrated
need, as determined by the financial aid
office (a determination that often does
not match students' and families' calculations of their need). This year the college
estimated the gap between expected postfinancial aid revenue and theoretical revenue without aid to be around $26 million.
After student .charges, Swarthmore's
endowment makes the second largest
contribution. At the end of lastfiscal year
(June 30, 2009), the endowment's market
value was assessed at $1129 billion, down
over $2BO millionfrom the previous year.
The projected 2009-2010 budget has the
endowment contributing $46.9 million, 44
percent of the total. This represents a
lower percentage than in previous years;
for example, endowment spending made
up 50 percent of the college's income in
the 2008-2009 budget year, with the bulk
of the change coming from previously
noted greater student charges. In my next
column, I will explore in more depth the
endowment and its relationship to the

budget.
Grants, gifts and bequests make up the

third major source of income. Altogether,
these sources are expected to bring in
around $7.5 million this year, representing seven percent of expected income.
When the college set its budget for this
year, it expected this category to remain
roughly constant from the 2008-2009
budget year in absolute terms and therefore increased slightly relative to other
sources (from about six-and-a-half percent). The Annual Fund is the college's
main fundraising initiative each year. It
has three parts: the Alumni Fund, the
Parents Fund and the Friends Fund. The
Annual Fund is made up of donations
that are unrestricted (that is, not desig-

nated for a particular spending purpose)
and are spent within the year they are
donated. These donations pay for much of
the college's
day-to-day bperations,
including faculty salaries, library materi-

als, dorm maintenance, and financial aid.
One of the unfortunate features of the
recession is that the Annual Fund's
income has declined at the same time the
endowment is losing value. In 2008-2009,
the Annual Fund raised almost $4.4 million, down four percent from the recordsetting previous year. Participation rates,
however, remained high, with 55.5 percent of solicitable alumni donating (versus 57.0 percent the previous year). Many
decades of alums are represented among
donors in the 2008-2009 year, including
111 members of the class of 2008 and representatives from as far back as the class
of 1937.

Swarthmore has historically struggled

to match peer institutions in fundraising:

in the 2007-2008 year, our average
Alumni Fund gift was just $479, compared to $723 at Williams and $771 at
Amherst in the same year. This is not to

February 11, 2010

suggest that only big donations are
worthwhile: the average represents both

"leadership givers" (who generally gave
at least $1864) and many smaller donors.
Small donations matter both because
they add up and because foundations and
other grantors look at participation rates
in deciding among various institutions to
donate to. Many donations are also
matched either by donors' employers or
by other alumni, meaning that each dollar donated may mean two or three dollars to the college.
Revenues from government grants
fluctuate greatly. The average over the
last five years is around SLB million per
fiscal year. Similarly, capital gifts and
bequests vary from year to year.
Bequests in the wills of alumni and other
friends of the college, along with other
non-Annual Fund gifts, brought in
around $14.8 million last year.
However, not all of these gifts are
spent in full each year because these revenues are often intended for multi-year
purposes or may be restricted to funding
particular budget items. Other non-spent
gift income is invested in the endowment
so that the endowment will continue to
grow and provide income in the future.
A number of smaller sources make up
the remaining four percent of the college's yearly revenue. Among them are
rents on college-owned properties, application fees, and royalties on collegeowned works.
I would love to hear your questions,
comments or concerns about the college's
budget, the endowment, the annual fund
or any other related issues. Please come
back in two weeks when the column will
explore that billion-dollar black box, the
Swarthmore endowment.

Predictions for the sports world in 2010, part 2
prediction

One

demanded by my readers:

the New Orleans Saints
win the Super Bowl
"Hey Mark enjoyed the
column but fail to see your
prognostication for the
Super Bowl. Don't leave us
hanging! Geaux Saints!!!"
-Lindsay
Yanez,
Swarthmore Cycles
-

To all (one) of my 'ador-

Mark Chin
"Playoffs? You Kidding Me?"

ing fans": I am sorry for not
including this prediction in
my previous column. I was
strapped for space by my

m

section editor (e-mail your
complaints to mchin2), and had to delay this prediction to
this week's column. But I will withhold it from you no
longer. I predict that... *drumroll* the New Orleans Saints
will win Super Bowl XLIV! And I'll even venture a score
prediction: the final score will be 31-17 in favor of "Who
Dat" Nation.
I'm so confident in my ability to prophesize this game, I
say Drew Brees ties Tom Brady's Super Bowl completion
record of 32, Saints kicker Garrett Hartley sets a new
record of three successful field goal attempts made in a
Super Bowl from more than 40 yards out and that even
Sean Payton breaks some obscure record like being the
first coach to call an onside kick in a Super Bowl before the
fourth quarter. Throw in a prediction of a Tracy Porter
interception returned 74 yards for a TD and a horrific show-

ing by the Colts defense on the basics of tackling, and I'd

say I've given this prediction almost no chance of coming
true. Wait, are you telling me that I can't make this prediction anymore?
One prediction that forecasts recurring futility: the
St. Louis Rams draft Jimmy Clausen first overall in
this year's NFL Draft
Meet the St. Louis Rams. The've only experienced four
winning seasons since moving from Los Angeles to St.
Louis. Their defense only registered 25 sacks in 2009 (30th
in the league) and allowed 372.8 yards per game (28th).
Opposing teams gashed their run defense for 24 rushing
TDs (tied for most). The Rams need some help on defense.
Meet the current market of NFL quarterbacks. There is
a proliferation of potential short-term quarterbacks on the
market that the Rams can trade for or acquire. Derek

Anderson, Brady Quinn, Donovan McNabb, Kevin Kolb,
Chad Pennington, Jason Campbell, Kyle Orton and Tavaris
Jackson (the last three are unrestricted free agents with a

new collective bargaining agreement).
Meet this year's crop of college players in the draft.
Ndamukong Suh, one of the most dominating defensive
tackles to have ever played college ball, finished as a finalist for the Heisman Trophy (awarded to the best college
football player). Few pure defensive players have earned
that honor, and even fewer sportscasters can pronounce his
name correctly the first time.
Meet Steve Spagnuolo, former defensive coordinator of

the 2007 Superbowl victors, the Giants, whose defensive
schemes sank one of the greatest NFL offenses ever.
Current head coach of the St. Louis Rams. The stage is set.
The Rams have the top pick. Spagnuolo sees Suh and sees
oh,
the future focal point ofhis defense. He sees this and
look at all those shiny TDs Jimmy Clausen has thrown!
And the Rams take Clausen with the first pick. The team
brings back offensive guard Richie Incognito to play defensive tackle, and the Rams set a new season record for
unnecessary roughness penalties. There's a reason why
teams perpetually suck.
...

One prediction biased by hatred for the L.A. Lakers:
the Denver Nuggets win the NBA Western Conference
Championships
OK. So I bet against the Lakers with my friend two years
ago when they faced the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals.
Boston won the series and I won a free lunch of sushi. Since
then I've been biased against the Lakers.
But it's not as if I make predictions based off arbitrary
reasons! The Nuggets own a 10-5 record (as of Feb. 9)
against the current eight teams in the Western Conference
slated to head to the NBA playoffs (including a 2-0 advantage over the Lakers). Denver also owns a 4-2 record
against the only other teams with shots at getting in
(Houston, New Orleans and Memphis).
Additionally, no other team in the conference has a

clear advantage over the Nuggets, who own a balanced ros-

ter to complement their positive record. Chauncey BiUups
is an experienced point guard who is spelled by speedy
rookie Ty Lawson (and the Lakers have problems guarding
quick point guards). Carmelo Anthony is their prolific
scorer (second in the league) and go-to guy in crunch time.
The roster holds two players with great nicknames (a must
for any finals-bound team): the Birdman (defense/energyminded Chris Anderson) and KMart (washed-up power forward Kenyon Martin). But most importantly, J.R. Smith
plays for the Nuggets. Smith is from my hometown.

Represent. Oh, and the Atlanta Hawks win the East.
One prediction that I hope never conies true: Rafael
Nadal's knees prevent him from winning another ten-

nis Grand Slam

I swear I made this prediction a couple weeks ago,
before Rafa retired against Andy Murray at the Australian
Open because ofknee issues. Does anyone else besides me
think that Nadal will never win another Grand Slam?
People have widely speculated the causes of his knee problems (intense tournament scheduling, physical style of
play); whether or not he'll ever fully recover from his
injuries has yet to be seen. A group of young tennis stars
even younger than Nadal (think Del Potro, Cilic and
Querrey) are starting to rise, and he certainly seems mortal compared to his 2008 campaign. Add in the fact that the
only player to win a Grand Slam in the current ATP top 100
after reaching Nadal's current age is the Fed Express, and
we see that his window of opportunity is fast closing.
I hope I'm wrong though. I'm a Federer fan, but I have
incredible amounts of respect for a player like Nadal. He
battles for every point, performs at incredible levels of
exceUence and is as humble an athlete as they come. It
would be a shame if Nadal never reverts to his old form.
But he needs to approach tennis play differently if it's ever

going to happen.

One story (with a moral) for everyone
Rewind to Sunday night. Instead of writing a seminar
paper for class (Barry Schwartz's Psychology and
Economic Rationality), I'm watching my team play in the
Super Bowl in Mephistos. I figured I'd regret this decision
when I was awake later that night (if prospect theory didn't inspire preconstructed preference theory, I'd question
the rationality of my decision).
I took a break from the TV at halftime to spend1 some
time with my girlfriend whom I hadn't seen all week. And
I missed the first few minutes of the third quarter. Now, the
football gods should've punished my transgression. Peyton
should've driven the Colts down the field and scored a TD
because I wasn't screaming my heart out for the Saints for
a few minutes. But that didn't happen. The Saints called a
ballsy play and recovered an onside kick.
The moral of this story is this: some things are so much
more important than sports that even the sports gods will
forgive you. I guess my story suggests that these things are
your relationships with other people and not your academics. Yep. I've totally got my priorities straight.

Of course, when I say that this was longawaited, I mean that it's all just one part of
the much bigger picture ofhow football has
long been changing to better accommodate
a prerequisite for

that "chicks dig the long ball"-philosophy
which brought baseball into the Steroid
Era. Among other things, this meant that
the five-yard personal facemask penalty
was gone, yet another version of the 15yard one. It meant that receivers could

mark. The times, ladies and

each the best quarterback his conference
had to offer. Together, the two of them
threw for over 600 yards, while neither of
their teams rushed for 100. Manning completed 31 of his passes. Brees completed 32,
tying a Super Bowl record. He was named
the game's most valuable player for beating the season's most valuable player in a
year where quarterbacks were invaluable,
more so than ever before. It was the last in
a long, long string of brilliant performances given this year by himself, Manning,
Brady, Favre, Rivers and all the rest of
them. For the theme that was adopted by
this season, as well as this column, 2009
couldn't possibly have ended any better ...
and the best part of this whole thing?
There's just no real reason why the good

barely be touched after the first five yards.
Most of all, it meant that if you were a
quarterback, you weren't going to get hit
very hard without gaining 15 yards and a

first down. Formations with more
receivers and fewer running backs have
become more and more common around
the league, and with college and NFL programs alike spreading the field at an
unprecedented frequency, there's no sign
of the long ball going away anytime soon.
Still, for all of this to coalesce and at last
turn the NFL into a pass-oriented league,
unforeseen levels of talent and depth under

league is still filled with more quarterback
talent than there has been in generations,
AFC and NFC alike. In Matt Ryan, Joe
Flacco and Jay Cutler (tentatively), we see
the next generation of quarterbacks on the
cusp of joining the elite. In Mark Sanchez
and Matthew Stafford, we see glimpses of
the future and the future is good. And from
this year's draft or next year's or even the
one after that, we eagerly await the arrival
of the next future great quarterback, the
one who will endure training camps, interceptions, bone-shattering hits, soaring victories and crushing defeats on his way to
becoming the one who will take his place
as the greatest in a league filled with the
and raise the trophy over his
greatest
head at season's end.
2009 is at a close. 2010 is on deck. And
while, one hopes, there will always be
teams like this year's Jets, teams that succeed by reminding us of What Used To Be
in an age that more and more try to pass
them by, the time has come once again to
ask ourselves just who He is. He the leader
of the team that will win next year's title
and He who will, like Brees, be able to say
that he was the best quarterback when
there have never before been so many men

vying to say the same. There are seven

Captain Kramer leads badminton squad, reflects on sport
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

On Monday night, the Swarthmore Garnet badminton
squad defeated visiting Bryn Athyn 8-1, completing a sweep

of the home and home series with the Lions. With the
two victories, the Garnet improves to 3-1 on the season,

with upcoming matches against Bryn Mawr and Penn.
Leading the way for the Garnet in Monday's victory and
in last Thursday's 7-2 win at Bryn Athyn was Kim Kramer
'lO, who won both of her singles and doubles matches.
Kramer recognizes the importance of picking up the
two early wins in the winter season. "It's definitely a confidence booster At the same time, it's important that we
don't get cocky and that we stay focused during training."
Though Kramer has been a leader on the team since her
first year, she continues to improve and lead her teammates by exanlple. "In terms of my own play, I've noticed a
big improvement in my game since the semester started.
[Coach Parikh] has been focusing on squats and jumps,
[and it is] really paying off," Kramer said.
Badminton is a varsity sport at Swarthmore College,
and Coach Bahvin Parikh, now in his fourth season as
head coach for badminton at Swarthmore, has continued
the Garnet tradition of badminton excellence. Swarthmore
finished last season as the third-ranked women's team in

the nation, behind NYU and Penn.
Under intercollegiate rules, each team member is limited to one singles match and one doubles match. Teams are

ranked at the end of each season based on their overall
record with a minimum of two match results against

Intercollegiate Badminton Association teams.
Prior to entering Swarthmore, Kramer competed at a
high level in regional badminton tournaments. In 2008,
Kramer finished second in the nation in the under-22 age

group.
In her four years at Swarthmore, Kramer has watched
the badminton team become a cohesive unit, and Kramer
values the experience of being part of a collegiate varsity
team. "The time commitment has meant that I haven't
been able to try as many new activities as I would have
liked to, but I don't regret my devotion to badminton for a
second. Being part of a team has also been a fantastic expecompetitive badminton is usually an individual
rience
sport, so before coming to college I wasn't aware of the
huge impact that the support of teammates can have on
your game." Kramer's hard work at Swarthmore has led
to strong results in all four of her years competing with the

team.

The badminton team will return to action on Thursday,
Feb. 18, when it hosts Bryn Mawr. Action is scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m.

Track teams hurdle injuries at Haverford meet
BY MARCUS MELLO
mmello2@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet men's and women's indoor

track teams participated in the Haverford
Invitational at the Alumni Field House on
Sunday. The meet was originally scheduled for last Saturday but was postponed
due to the snow. Runners from Bryn Mawr,
Haverford, LaSalle, NYU, Rutgers-Camden,
Swarthmore, Temple, Villanova and
Widener were present at the meet.
"There was a nice mix of teams at the
tournament including two Division I
teams," said Head Coach Pete Carroll, who
is in his tenth straight year of coaching at
Swarthmore. "It's nice that we can have a
meet with a lot of close teams. There was
strong competition."
Despite having injured athletes on both
teams, including women's team captain
Annyika Corbett 'lO, the Garnet came out
strong. "We had some good performances
and one or two duds, but for the most part I
think we did a good job," Carroll said.
The Garnet men's indoor track team
was led by star performances from
Matthew Heck 'l3, Daniel Ly 'll and Jonnie
Tompkins 'lO.
Heck led the Garnet in the 400 meter
dash with a time of 53.57, which was good
enough for a seventh place finish in a field
of 21 competitors. Dan Kurz 'll and Gabriel
Ryan 'l3 also rounded up in the top fifteen
runners.

In the triple jump, Ly leaped 42'11",
which put him in fifth place behind three
competitors from Temple University and
one from Villanova. His jump was the ninth
best on Swarthmore's all-time list and the
fourth
Centennial
longest in the
Conference for the season.
Hopkins was also one of. the top Garnet
finishers. "Jonnie ran a great 5K and qualified for Conferences," Carroll said.
Tompkins' time of 16:05.22 put him in ninth
place out of 25 runners.
Another strong race for Swarthmore
was
the 4x400 relay team, with
Swarthmore's 'B' and A' teams finishing
seven-eight in 3:53.51 and 3:54.23. "We tried
to make the teams even instead of stacking
all of the fastest runners into one team,"
said Coach Carroll. The 'B' team, which

16

consisted of Kurz, Eric Verhasselt 'l3, Dan
Stuart 'l3 and Ryan, took seventh place.
For the women, Captain Lauren DeLuca
'lO and Margaret Lenfest 'l2 had top performances in the 800 meter run. DeLuca's
star performance of 2:22.44 earned her a second place finish out of 24 runners.
Although she was one of the highest place
finishers for both the men and women,
DeLuca wasn't completely satisfied with
her race. "Personally, I feel okay with my
race. Though I ran a season's best, I feel
like I could have run faster if I raced more
aggressively," she said. "As for the rest of
the ladies, I was impressed by everyone
who came out despite the fact that the meet
was rescheduled to Sunday. People toughed
it out and showed up on race day."
DeLuca was particularly impressed
with the underclassmen. "I am really excited about our underclassmen," she said.
"We've got some talent coming up through
the ranks as well as some returns who are
getting stronger every day. This is starting
to show in our relays, like our 4x400 which
is in the running for a medal at
Conferences."
For the invitational, the
4x400 relay included underclassmen
Kenyetta Givans 'l2, Rebecca Hammond 'l3
and Lenfest. DeLuca was the fourth mem-

ing to practice in the Lamb-Miller Field
House, which was built in 1935. The old
track has caused the teams to be plagued
with shin injuries. "The indoor track is
hard on [the runners'] shins and not a really good surface to train on. I'd like to get
outside more with the distance runners,"
Carroll said. "It's better than nothing, but
too much of it is worse than nothing."
Men's team captain Andrew Vanßuren
echoed this concern. "It's been tough not
having a regulation-size indoor track, and
with the weather not cooperating well, running inside has become more of an issue.
Both this inconvenience and the number of
injuries add to the burdens on the indoor
track team," he said.
Nevertheless, the Garnet runners have
been practicing harder in the weeks leading up the Centennial Conference
Championships, which are scheduled for
Feb. 26 at Haverford. Practices have been

that, it's always nice to see everyone give

did."
