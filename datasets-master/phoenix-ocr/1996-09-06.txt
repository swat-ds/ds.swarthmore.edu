Swarthmore First
in Annual Ranking
Students pleased,
but wonder if they
should even care
By

Tara Zahra

Swarthmore edged out Williams
and Amherst for the top spot in U.S.
News and World Report's annual
college rankings, which were released yesterday.
"Did you know that you're going
to the number one liberal arts college
in the country?" one Swarthmore
student asked another while waiting
in line at Tarble on Thursday. The
question sounds like rampant egoism or snobbery, but it was actually
just good news spreading fast.
Swarthmore has always been considered an "academic powerhouse,"
said Director of Admissions Susan
Untereker, but the rankings are expected to have a substantial effect on
admissions for the class of 2001.
"It's obvious as we recruit that parents and prospective students remember who is number one, while they
may forget numbers two and three."
This sentiment was echoed in part
by Amanda Atterbury, a prospective
student from Malvern, Pennsylvania. When asked how she thought
the new ranking would affect students' decisions she said "it probably influences parents more than
kids. Parents will encourage students
to apply."
New Dean of Admissions Robin
Mamlet predicts that "we' 11 get more
students looking at Swarthmore simply because it's number one. Some
will be right for the school, some
won't." The combination of a larger
applicant pool and iast year's unexpectedly high yield means that "we
will be approaching admittance very
cautiously."
Student reactions to the news varied from overjoyed to cynical. "I
think it's a shocking feeling to realize, wow, I'm attending the best liberal arts college in the country. Maybe
there will be more name recognition
now," said Kira Goetschius 'OO.

Although Franklin Rubinstein '97
was pleased with the news, he didn't
think the ranking reflected any real
improvements. *T m glad that Swarthmore is finally getting the respect
that it deserves, and I'll be the first to
admit that it may help a bit in terms of
job hunting, but to me thereal character of Swarthmore has not changed
much at all since my first year here
when we were number three, which
only goes to show how meaningless
it all is."
Al Bloom responded to the news in
a press statement Thursday, saying
that Swarthmore takes the ranking as
"a ringing endorsement of a liberal
arts education which develops in students the ability to tackle theoretical
and societal complexities and to use
those skills to shape a better world."
Swarthmore was also ranked tenth
in the "Best Values-Discount Prices"

The unusually large size of the
Class of 2000 has necessitated many
new changes in the use of space on
campus.
The largest challenge was finding
housing for all the first-year students.
The administration created new
rooms in Dana, Hallowell and Parrish,
and housed some sophomores and
juniors in the Strath Haven Condominiums and a house on Field House
Lane.
Janet Kassab, director of purchasing for Dining Services, and Registrar Martin Warner both report that
while sometimesunder strain with so
many students, on the whole the College is holding up well.
The problem is that the classes of
'97 and 'OO are two of Swarthmore's
largest ever. According to Myrt
Westphal, director ofresidential life,
the College has never had to deal
with two classes of this size at the
same time.
The College has dealt with this
challenge by creating new space. The
lounges in Dana and Hallowell have

ranking and twenty-second in the
"Best Values-Sticker Prices"
rankings, designed to relate the cost
of attending an institution to its quality.
The college rankings will be published in the September 16th issue of
U.S. News and World Report, which
will be on sale Monday. The best
values rankings will be published in
the September 23 issue, available September 16th. All rankings can also be
found on the World Wide Web at

fair/.
The rankings are based on data
such as SAT scores, class rank, and
student selectivity for the class of
1999, in addition to factors including
financial resources, alumni satisfaction, graduation rates, student faculty
ratios, and faculty resources. 2,730
college presidents, deans and admissions directors were surveyed to determine the rankings.
Swarthmore has been ranked
among the top three national liberal
arts colleges each year since the
rankings were first published ten years
ago. Last year, Swarthmore tied with
Williams for the number two position, and Amherst ranked first.
Swarthmore has been number one

a common lounge area and study

Westphal's goal was to be certain
that incoming Swatties would get a

"typical first-year space."
Some offices on the second floorof
Parrish were remade into dorm
rooms—mostly singles for juniors
and seniors. Swarthmorealso utilized
itsleases on a house along Field House
Lane and the Strath Haven Condominiums to house the rest of the students. It took some "major juggling
to get it all together," said Westphal,
but in the end, everyone who requested housing got it.
Therehave been some problems in
Sharpies with the increased load, but
nothing significant, said Kassab.
There was a shortage of napkins one
day and "some shortage with silverware and bowls," but Dining Services has purchased additional supplies and does not anticipate any longterm problem The dining hall is seriously strained everyone comes at once
as they do for lunch on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, but this was also the case,
albeit to a lesser extent, in the past.
However, some of the workers feel
they are understaffed to deal with the
rush, particularly the meal identification card checkers.
Registrar Martin Warner said that
first-year student registration went
smoothly, although there certainly
was some strain. Warner attributed
this to all the departments opening
new classes and expanding others.
He said the classes will stay a "typical Swarthmore size...nice and low."
He was "expecting the worst," but
this turned out "betterthan last year."
There have been some other problems. Some rooms are missing furniture and there isn't much left to give
out. Alice Balbierer, the assistant director of special projects for facilities, said many rooms had their furniture stolen and she has few replacements; all the new furniture this year
went into the new rooms.

Essie Mae's Prices Increase, Decrease in First Week
By Tony
and

Sturm

Erica Turner

After six days of student outrage
due to price increases at Essie Mae's
Snack Bar, Food Services has rescinded a 10 percent hike in the cost
of bottled beverages. To date, Food
Services has not re-instituted the
policy of offering a free medium soda
with grill items and sandwiches.
The dime increase in the price of
sodas, juices, and other drinks from
the cooler upset many students who
frequent the popular snack bar as an
alternative to Sharpies.
In response to the protests of students, Essie Mae's reinstituted the
original price for bottled beverages
on Thursday morning. But other
newly instituted policies are expected
to remain in effect.
Students are still griping about the
loss of their free fountain sodas and
the price increases for selected foods
(see chart). Marie Dalton, cash operations manager, said that one ofthe
alleged policies that had infuriated
many students was inaccurate. Some
had complained that now, in order to
get the $3.75 dinner credit, one must
be through the line instead of in the

The price changes made it impossible to buy a small breakfast of a
bagel with cream cheese and a bottle
of apple juice with the $2.00 credit
allotted to students on the standard
meal plan. Students could no longer
afford a bottled beverage with many
items from the grill, like the popular
fingers and fries.
Dalton explained why the prices
changed back, explaning, "It was just
so inconvenient because students
refuse to carry money with them. It
was just ten cents, but they still are
not willing to drink the juice out of
the dispenser. They still want their
bottled juice."
Also new at Tarble are more sophisticated registers, which now have
buttons for individualitems. "Everything is itemized now, said Dalton.
The new registers, however, have
slowed down the process of checking
out, since checkers now have to push
a button for each item, instead of one
for the meal. Early bugs in the system
and inexperience withthe equipment
also contributed to delays, particularly on Tuesday and Thursday before 9:55 a.m. classes.
The checkers are not enthusiastic

New Faces Grace Admissions and IC
By

Jessica Harbour

With the start ofevery year comes
not only a new first-year students, but
the arrival of new administrators in
old positions. This year has proven
no exception. Over the summer,
Robin Mamlet and Anna Cobo arrived to take the positions of Dean of
Admissions and Director of the Intercultural Center, respectively.
Mamlet was hiredafter a year-long
search for a Dean ofAdmissions after
the death of Carl Wartenburg in August 1995. Before coming to Swarthmore, she worked in admissions at
Pomona College, Sarah Lawrence
College, and The Lawrenceville

School in New Jersey. While she
considers this her "dream job," she
does have several concerns about liberal arts colleges in general. "We
[colleges] are frequently placed on
trial in the media, and the outcome is
not always helpful. We need to find a
way to be more clear about...why
excellence in higher education is so
vital to the future." She hopes to
increase Swarthmore's visibility
"without being too flashy or
slick...while maintaining the integrity of the place." She also wants to
keep channels of communication
open to students.
Unlike Mamlet, Cobo holds a position whichrequires daily contact with

said that although there are fewer
students frequenting the snack bar,
"there's more involved. Anything
[students] buy has to be put into the
register and it's making the line
longer." But Dalton expects that the
crowds will become more manageable when the checkers become more
familiar with the machines.
A new policy instituted in an attempt to remove some of the burden
faced by students has not yet been
publicized: students can buy a small
juice or soda for $0.50 with anything
that is considered breakfast or a meal.
"I just didn't raise the price and say,
'Well, they're all going to be over
$.lO every morning,'" said Dalton.
"They can have a juice with their
bagel or phoenix or whatever it
is...We keyed in a special key for a
breakfast juice so you could have a
breakfast juice, a fountain soda or
fountain juice with your breakfast."
Students have seen their options
diminish with this year's meal plan.
The cost of the meal plan rose $ 144,
and the prices of many snack bar
items also rose, while credit levels at
Essie Mae's have remained at the
same level they were last year.

with some of the college's more marginal housing. Overcrowding, however, seems to be something of a

tradition at Swarthmore.
The most severe overcrowding occurred shortly after World War 11.
Large numbers of students returned
from military service, and were joined
by others taking advantage of the
G.I. bill. Preliminary plans for a new
dorm were drawn up in 1946. By the
time it was actually built, 12 years
later, it had transformed from something closely resembling Worth into
the "contemporary" building we now
know as Willets.
Meanwhile, many studentsfelt that
enrollment should be reduced. The
problem was still evident in late 1949,

The college was once again overcrowded in the early 'Bos, shortly
before the construction ofMertz. Paul
A. Carnahan 'Bl wrote in a letter to
The Phoenix, "Overcrowding affects
the lives of all students, not just students who live in dorms and eat at
Sharpies. Although educational quality is not necessarily inversely related to class size, enrollment is a
significant educational factor at a
school which was set up around small
classes." Need for a new dorm had
been recognized in the early 70s, but
it took another ten years beforeMertz

opened to students.

than the classes of '97 and 'OO, was
unusually large for its time. There

was, as now, much griping among

upper classpersons. Haleh Bakhash
wrote in a September 1984 Phoenix
article, "You guys caused a few problems. First, there was a cutback in
the numberof transfer students. Second, new course sections have been
added so that you can all take the
classes you have dreamt about all
summer. Finally, Pittinger has been
reopened, after remaining unoccupied for the past few years."
Most recently, the class of '97

strained Swarthmore to capacity. According to the September 3, 1993
Phoenix, "Assistant Dean Tedd
Goundie indicated that all the lounge
and basement rooms —renamed
'lower level' —are now occupied.
Simply put, there is no more space."
The current overcrowding should
be greatly reduced next year, when
the class of '97 graduates. Until then,
we will have to deal with lotteried
classes, scarce silverware, and Grade

D housing.

It seems only fitting that Swatties
would choose to spend their precious summers in a thousand different ways. Imagine anything, from
studying wolves and moose on Isle
Royale to teaching middle school
children in Miami, and, most likely,
someone on this campus did it at
some point during the past four
months. Most Swatties chose to go
home or elsewhere in the United
States, but many traveled abroad and
some even remained right here on
campus.
Chris Flood '99 spent his summer
working with SPEEC, an environmental group on campus. "We
canvased residents of Chester and
began to develop environmentaleducation in Delaware County," he said.
"One of the most remarkable things
was the bridging of differences in
working styles between me and the
other people who I worked with."
Flood lived in Swat apartments
with Josh Silver '97, who worked for
the history department. "We learned
many things the hard way, like the
air conditioning bill," said Flood.
But they had tons of fun in the process, including the debut of their
own informal restaurant, the selfproclaimed J-C Funky Gourmet.

No Matter What You Say or Do To Me, I'm Still...

Elisabeth Newcomb

Orientation began for me while I
ordered breakfast at Denny's. I had
successfully avoided thinking about
college until I watched other firstyears (not appearing half as nervous
as I felt) downing a final meal of
pancakes and bacon with their parents.

The official beginning of orientation was not until that afternoon in
Lang Concert Hall, when 410 voices
repeatedly chanted Associate Dean
Robert Gross' traditional mantra, "No
matter what you say or do to me, I am
still a worthwhile person." This mantra concerned me a great deal. What

kind of a school needs to provide
students with a self-esteem device
before they even see a classroom?
Why did it feel that after only four
hours on campus I needed this reinforcement so badly?
The morning was very stressful
to the back as well as to the soul. My
macho parents and I declined the
assistance of the RA and hauled all
my personal belongings (did I leave
anything at home?) up to the third
floor. The furniture was shoved into
random positions along the far wall,
and it took an hour of my mother's
brilliant but failed ideas to make everything fit.
Next came the waiting. There was

Several Swatties spent their summers traipsing around Europe, basking in the freedom that summer often
brings. Stephanie Herring '99 spent

Johansen '9B traveled to Germany.
They spent three months working at a

summer delivering pizzas and
cheesesteaks for Real Pizza in
Narberth."l procured a possible career opportunity delivering. I liked
knocking on doors," he said, "but I
think I need another summer to fully
masterit." As the summer progressed,
Frazer learned how to collect larger
tips: "No socks, a white t-shirt, polite,
but modest, nothing too eager."
And, ofcourse, the newest Swatties
are no exception. Many of the firstyears spent their summers well, despite preparing for their arrival at
Swarthmore. Shalini Ayyagari 'OO
took a two week trip with a bunch of
friends to Miami and Disneyworld.
She spent the rest of her summer at
home in Maryland, ushering for Baltimore Orchestra concerts.
Laura Pomerance 'OO worked at
The National Institute of Health doing research in clinical neuroendocrinology. "I was involved in several
things, but mostly prepared the slides
ofrat brain." Pomerance also worked
part-time in a hardware store. All this,
and they still had time to prepare
themselves for Swarthmore? "Well,
that sort of happened the night before
we left," said Ayyagari and
Pomerance.
Swatties managed to cram excitement and learning into their summers,
whether they were traveling or working. One thing's for sure —we'll be
impressive and active during our fall
and winter months on campus as well.

Diversity problem isn’t solved yet

.

The new academic year has brought major changes to our campus. A trailer
is serving as the lounge for Dana and Hallowell dormitories. The Community
Resource Center, formerly the home of numerous student organizations, now
houses administrative offices that were moved to make spacefor dormrooms.
Swarthmore now has approximately 1440 students, the most ever in peacetime. Word around campus is that the lines in the bookstore, the credit union,
and, of course, Sharpies Dining Hall are longer than those at Disneyland.
The greater representation ofstudents ofcolor in the Class of 2000 is truly
exciting. More than 38 percent of the American students in the class identified
themselves as African-American, Latino, Asian-American, or multi-racial,
compared to well under 30 percent in past classes. After years of saying that
it wants a more diverse student body, the College has finally admitted one.
Yet is Swarthmore really equipped to deal with this newfound diversity?
The void left by Maxine Proctor’s departure from the directorship of the
Black Cultural Center can only partially be filled by Linda Echols, who is
serving as interim head of the BCC while continuing in her position as
director of Worth Health Center. When the number of African-American
students on campus is higher than ever before, resources such as the BCC will
be needed—not to mention appreciated —the most.
Students looking to take advantage ofthe Intercultural Center are, likewise,
arriving at a time of administrative turnover. Although we trust that the new
IC director, Anna Maria Cobo, will do a good job, Fernando Chang-Muy’s
experience with Swarthmore and its students will be sorely missed. And
nearly two years after Joe Mason’s departure, Swarthmore still hasn’t hired
a new Associate Dean of Multicultural Affairs.
Meanwhile, this year’s Orientation program included no activities addressing issues of diversity for all students. While most returning students would
agree that past activities were less than successful, we should not have
stopped trying. New students, particularly those arriving from high schools
and neighborhoods where everyone is just like them, deserve at least a little
guidance in how to live on an increasingly heterogeneous campus.
And thus an amazing class—not only do the new first-years come from a
wider range of backgrounds than ever before, but they earned outstanding
grades and test scores in high school—arrives at Swarthmore. The College
has finally done something about a long-standing need to recruit more
students of color. Now that they’re here, will Swarthmore strengthen its
commitment to supporting diversity on campus?

Election '96: A Duel Between Sellouts

space

Swarthmore’s summer storage rooms are filled.. .with problems. They are
clogged with the trash and debris of years of overcrowding, and some haven’t
been cleaned in years. There’s broken glass in Willets and mildew in Mertz,
and the wait for access to the high-security room in Roberts is often over an
hour long. Finally, the towering stacks ofboxes in every dorm constitute a fire
hazard and make it difficult for students to find their belongings. The College
should work to solve these problems; it has a responsibility to ensure that the
storage space it makes available to students is safe, clean, and accessible.
Part of the problem is that too little space is currently devoted to storage.
Granted, the campus is in use all summer, but there must be some rooms,
classrooms perhaps, whichcould be used for excess storage. The College says
it’s thinking of using more of Wharton basement for storage; that’s a step in
the right direction.
The College should also clean out the storage rooms, ALL of them, once
a year. Even something as simple as clearing debris from the aisles would be
a vast improvement. Maybe dorm RAs could organize a cleanup, with
abandoned goods going to charity. In any case, the junk has to be cleaned up.
Finally, Roberts storage needs to be made more accessible to students. It’s
popular, and safe, and a good idea; now we justneed to be able to use it without
hour-long waits. It would be simple to staff Roberts for two hours every
evening for a week at the beginning and end of the semester in order to reduce
the time spent waiting in line.

Campaign '96 has demonstrated
that both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole
are men willing to abandon theirpast
beliefs to win the upcoming presidential election. These actions were
both politically astute and morally
weak. In a broader sense, however,
the importance of these political
stratagems is how they reveal an important change in the American political landscape.
Bill Clinton signed the welfare "reform" billrecently. This was not altogether unexpected. Implicit in
Clinton's actions since the disastrous

Congressional elections of 1994 has
been an allegiance to the political
center, so signing the bill is, in fact, a
final act of separation from the rest of
the Democratic Party. Clinton, as
president, has become his own centrist party, co-opting traditional GOP
issues while supporting popular
Democratic policies. Many Democrats complain, and rightfully so, but
pragmatic liberals realize that Clinton
as president is still preferable to Dole.
Still, the implications for American
politics are stunning—Clinton, the
Democratic candidate, is not running
as a Democrat.
The reason that Clinton signed the

Letter to the Editor
Improve Storage Facilities, Swat Parents Say
A copy of this letter to President Al
Bloom was mailed to The Phoenix.
Dear President Bloom:
Our daughter is about to begin her
third year of study at your college and
in most respects we have been completely satisfied. However, every time
a school year begins or ends we witness a lack of planning and consideration for studentlives on campus. We
are specifically concerned with the
lack of usable, convenient, and secure storage space. This problem is
especially serious since students often do not follow the traditional pattern of fours years continuously in
residence. They need well-arranged
storage if they are to spend summers
working at Swarthmore and if they
broaden their studies off campus.
Our daughter spent the past summer working at the College and living
in Worth. She was required to be out
of Mary Lyons in mid-May. However, her job did not begin until June.
We found that the Worth storage area
was completely impassable as shelving had collapsed and possessions
were piled three feet high all over the
floor. She was fortunately able to
make arrangements with the person
living in the room she would soon
occupy to leave things. Leaving possessions in a dorm room before occupying it was a violation of College
policy, but she had no alternative.
The school required her to vacate
student housing again in mid-August.
When she contacted Buildings and
Grounds they told her to leave her
things in the Worth storage area because all other buildings were being
used by other groups. Eventually she
was notifiedthat some additional storage would be available in Parrish
basement, and she was advised to
leave her more valuable possessions
there as this room would be locked on
Monday, August 12.
She brought her computer and stereo there at noon on Saturday, August
10 and thenreturned to Worth to store
the rest ofher things. As usual she got
involved in a debris clearing operation entailing untangling old bed
frames, screen doors and dirty laundry labeled with the names of studentswho had graduated several years

before.
Making little headway at Worth,
she decided to carry her remaining
possessions up to Parrish. When she
returned therearound 5 p.m. she found
her stereo missing from its box and

immediately filed a report with campus security.
These conditions are not consistent with the otherwise first class
operation of Swarthmore. At best it
makes a mockery of the words we
heard from the deans about your concern for the students and at worst it is
a fire hazard with consequences far
worse than the loss of a boom box.
Perhaps from the College's perspective, students should have parents who can appear as needed with
vans and additional muscles, and students would then have no need for
usable storage facilities. But in reality, for most of us who work two full
time jobs to send our children to
schools such as Swarthmore, this is
unrealistic.We wonderwhat students
from other countries or less privileged backgrounds do in order to
cope with these seasonal pressures.
We suggest the following:
1) Visit the storage areas unannounced and look at them as would a
parent, before the students return and
at the end of the year.
2) Revisit them after the first few
weeks of sch6ol and assess the volume of unclaimed possessions.
3) Establish, with student input, a
reservation system so that students
can plan ahead and a policy on unclaimed stuff. Some will belong to
students on leavebut we suspect a lot
of it is abandoned property.
4) Install better shelving and pallets where there is space, and plan to
expand student storage facilities, including room for valuables. This is
particularly necessary as the school
continues to encourage student ownership of up-to-date computers.
5) At times ofactive student transit
within the campus, arrange for College maintenance trucks to circle the
campus to carry heavy student possessions from dorm to dorm.
Compared to the recent building
upgrades we are witnessing at
Swarthmore, these improvements
should cost a pittance.
They would enable students to
make adjustments to residential life
more easily, and wouldfacilitate staying on campus for summer employment and arranging off-campus opportunities during the academic year.
We appreciate your attending to this
situation atyourearliestconvenience.

bill is straightforward. In the absence
of targets of hatred such as the
U.S.S.R. and the Japanese, Americans have had their anger directed; by
politicians, towards welfare recipients. Clinton cannot realistically oppose draconian welfare reform because the public overwhelmingly supports it.
Bob Dole decided to try to help his
struggling campaign by proposing a
15% tax cut. Unfortunately, lower
taxes are not an economic panacea.
Moreover, they severely reduce government revenue without providing a
commensurate boost to the economy,
leaving the government with large
budget deficits (a legacy of theReagan
years). Despite Dole's claims that he
can balance the budget even with the
cut, he has also abandoned his lengthy
record of support for a policy (in this
case, the balanced budget) to attempt
to win the election.
Dole's campaign, based on character rather than personal appeal, undermines its claim to the moral high
ground with this tax cut and paints
Dole as a man desperate to become
president before he dies. He switched
his support to the tax cut for no other
reason than its popularity with the
voting public. Dole's move is, of
course, as popular as Clinton's.
This is not the first time that politicians have changed their views for
political gain. The '96 election, however, is striking because the candidates
and
drastically
so
unapologetically altered longstanding
positions during the campaign. Both
politicians probably believe that sac-

rificing their principles will ensure
that they can be elected in order to do
what is right later on.
In this age of instant polls and
single-issue lobbying, political candidates know a great deal about the
electorate. They must be responsive
to that knowledge of the views of
voters or risk defeat. Additionally,
major issues like welfare and taxes
often take precedence over the actual
candidate. These issues are sufficiently polarized that a single issue
could determine the result of the election. The upshot of all this is that
candidates like Clinton and Dole no
longer have the freedom of a conscience. They must note the will of
the people and adjust their positions
accordingly.
Presidential character as the voters would like it is now a Catch-22
people will only vote for politicians
who feel the way they do on certain
pivotal issues, yet want a candidate
conscientious enough to do the unpopular thing when necessary. Voters must accept the reality of American politics in 1996—candidates can

must have popular morals or face
defeat by a candidate who does. The
age of the interactive candidate is

Fresh Face Offers
A New Perspective
By

Andrew Bryce

So this is to be a political column.

Attention Swarthmore! Listen to
me! lam beginning a new life. And so
another journey begins. And during
this new journey, I am going to find a
new voice. I am going to become a
voice. This voice will not try to speak
for you. It will try to speak to you and
with you, so that what should be said
is said, and said with force, power,
;
and conviction.
I do not claim to know everything.
I know no more than you do; I know
less than a lot of you. But it is not
knowledge alone that I seek. I, however worthy or unworthy you judge
me, have taken the task of being a
voice that speaks of feeling and emotion, of passion inharmony withprinciples. What are we without our emotions?
So what will this column be about?
It will be about freedom. It will be
about speech. There is a blessing that
has fallen across this great nation
and that blessing is speech, a gift of
freedom given to the people. That
gift was given so that hundreds of
years later a young college freshman
could sit in his room and type out
weekly articles for a newspaper; it
was given so that the articles could
discuss what affect us most in our
daily lives—the decisions of those
who rule us.
—

Politics ofanything—ofSwarthmore,
of America, of the world, but it is not
to be a dry article filled with cold

facts; it will relate stories of opinions
and stories of passions. Politics and
news are important parts of
everyone's life, even the lives of those
who don't care. Politics helps to form
our lives, and so even though I am as
of yet powerless to stop anything
from happening in the political world,
I am not powerless to talk about it.
This article is to tell stories of voices.
That is all that I am—a voice. Not
your voice, not the voice of common
sense and wisdom, but one among
many, shouting to the world in a
singing voice that genius is wisdom
and youth; we have youth, and we are
going to wrest our genius out from
under the corners it hides in.
Take your life, Swarthmore! Take
your life and your world by the reins,
because now it is our time. It is our
turn. It is now our turn to become the
future. We are offered the world,
Swarthmore. Take it. Take it and run
with it.

Rebuilding the Garnet Tide

Women's Volleyball Getting Set

The defensive secondary, while
relatively young and inexperienced,
has shown quality play in both scrimmagesand practice. Leading the group
is cornerback Chris Fowler '97 along
withBrian Baird '99, who both saw
significantplaying timelast year. The
safeties will be manned by Michael
Turick'99andAlexLundry '99, with
freshman Adam Booth 'OO also seeing some time.
Last weekend the Tide unveiled
their lineup in a tune-up scrimmage
against the JuniorVarsity team at the
Division I United States Naval Academy. The scrimmage served as an
invaluable learning experience for
the unit, as they were up against extremely gifted players in both talent
and size. The Tide performed rather
effectively despite Navy's intense
playing style. The Tide moved the
ball well on offense, and the defense
shut out Navy in the second half.
The scrimmage also served as an
confidence builder going into this
weekend's season opener at Newport
News in Virginia, a non-conference
opponent which plays against perennial Division 111 playoff contenders.
While the Tide expects its first
opponent to be quite formidable,
many feel that the Navy scrimmage
prepped them well for this upcoming
contest. Indeed, they will welcome
all the help they can get this weekend
since the Tide may be combating two
opponents this Saturday: the Newport News Apprentices and Hurricane Fran.

Dave Lane '97, another co-captain,
is also optimistic about the coming
season.
"Last year our record was 11-9.
This year we're hoping to do a little
better than that. We'll be in the middle
to the top of the conference. In general we're hoping to have a good
season, we just got off to a bad start."
On Wednesday the team faced Holy
Family.
"We just have to start over. The
whole team will.be there, it will be an
intense game, and we'll let themknow
who we are." said Thompson.
