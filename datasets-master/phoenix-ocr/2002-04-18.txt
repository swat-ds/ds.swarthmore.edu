The search warrant, which provided
access to all servers on the college network, was the result of the ongoing investigation of the ClD's Internet Crimes
Against Children Task Force.

The Phoenix is withholding the student's name since no charges had been
filed at press time.
"The warrant was very specific in what
to search, and we were very specific in
allowing the search," said Judy Downing,
director of Information Technology
Services, who was presented with the warrant around lunchtime on Thursday.
Rumors that the entire root directory of
the SCCS server had been copied were
going around campus over the weekend.
However, no volumes of any server were
downloaded, only files used by or in some
way related to the student.

to the extent that the law allows," Tedd

the undercover officer and gave his roommate's phone number with the intent of

having phone sex.
The New Hampshire police traced the
number to Swarthmore, and McLaughlin
requested assistance from Swarthmore
Police Chief Brian Craig, who then
referred the case to task force leader Lt.
David Peifer. According to the affidavit,
the student admitted to having talking to a

mate's phone and the officers went to the
dorm room, according to the affidavit. At
that time, the student admitted to having
child pornography images on his computer and talking to and sending images to
the undercover New Hampshire officer.
It was then that the deans were notified
of the investigation, but they had not
received additional information about the
investigation's progress until April 11.
"I was surprised, because it had been
several weeks, and I hadn't heard anything," Goundie said.
The search comes at a time when electronic privacy has become a hot-button
issue on campus and around the country.
The college is currently in the process of
reviewing its electronic privacy policies.
Downing said the search would probably have some effect on the review
process. "Would we look at policies [in
light of the investigation]? The answer is
yes," she said. She stressed that the college does not monitor computers on the
network, nor does it plan to.
Gross agreed, saying that this investigation would not cause the college to monitor students' electronic activities more
closely. "We certainly don't want to be in a
position where we are monitoring what

students are doing on their computers,"
he said.
Neither Gross nor Goundie could say if
the college would seek internal disciplinary action against the student.

"Until we see what the charges are, it's
hard to say," Gross said. The college is
allowed to expel students it considers a

threat to the community, but the administration typically remains tight-lipped
about such procedures. "Our internal
processes are private
we try to maintain confidentiality," Gross said.
This case is virtually unprecedented at

the college. The only other known incident

of Internet crime,

according to

Goundie, occurred in the fall of 1999, when
a student saw another student's wallet in
the library, copied the credit card num-

bers and placed several orders to clothing
stores through the Internet. The student

whose credit card number was stolen
reported the case to the police. The
charged student left Swarthmore after
that semester.
"In my 15 years of being here, this is
the first time I had ever seen a warrant,"
Downing said. "I think this has been an
education for all of us."

Ex-employee embezzles more than $64,000
Library administrator was hired from temporary agency college officials say
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

mundal@swarthmore.edu

Former staff member Antoinette

Selby-Hobbs, the col-

lege library system's financial administrator between Nov.
2000 and May 2001, was recently arrested for her alleged
r ole in an embezzlement scheme that resulted in the theft
of more than $64,000 from the college. Reginald Abraham,
who may be Selby-Hobbs's husband, was also implicated in

the theft.
Because an investigation into Abraham's possible
Wvolvement is ongoing, officials would not comment on
the marital status of Abraham and Selby-Hobbs. According
to the Delaware County Times, the two are currently marked, and Reginald Abraham is an alias used in place of the
ttan's real name, Joseph Hobbs.
Sebly-Hobbs and Abraham have been charged with 17
counts each of theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception,
an d conspiracy, as well as 34 counts of forgery.
The college hired Selby-Hobbs through ACSys, Inc., a
National specialty professional staffing service, to serve on
temporary basis until the college could hire a permanent
according to Swarthmore Borough Police
Chief Brian Craig.
While a college employee, Selby-Hobbs oversaw many
°'the library's financial transactions, including approval
°f purchase orders for books, microfilm, videos and other
applies. She allegedly abused this responsibility to sign
j?" on more than a dozen false invoices, which resulted in

tunds for both her and Abraham.

According to Craig, college officials initially suspected
of embezzlement when review of McCabe coffee bar receipts
revealed approximately $1,200 stolen durln§ her term. As a result, the college fired her in May 2001
E PHOENIX

College budget officials discovered the extent of the
theft later in the year, when they began work on the 2002
budget. In the process of preparing the budget statement,
officials discovered a slew of false invoices to two companies, Glory Fine Books and R. Abraham's Books, which
together totaled $64,810.72. Both companies were listed as
"owned" by Reginald Abraham.
"It appears that money was paid out to these two companies through invoices, but no products were ever
received," Craig said, adding he did not know if the companies themselves were fictitious.
Officials believe Selby-Hobbs took valid library invoices and altered them, possibly through a scanner or other
computer-related technology, a process which Craig
described as "not that difficult" with today's technology.
"It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity" to manufacture such
documents, he said.
Selby-Hobbs then forwarded the false purchase orders,
which she had approved through her position, to the business office. In turn, the office cut checks to the false companies.

When the extent of the theft became apparent in Dec.
2001, public safety and the Swarthmore Borough Police
enlisted the help of the Delaware County Criminal
Investigation Division, a part of the district attorney's
office. Their investigators worked with members of the
Philadelphia Police Department and others, including
Swarthmore borough officer Leonard Poggi, to gather case

evidence.

The police issued an arrest warrant on Jan. 20 for theft
by unlawful taking, theft by deception, criminal conspiracy and forgery. Selby-Hobbs was not arrested until April 1

Restricting International Students: A threat to higher education?

Bush may restrict foreign students' majors
Interagency committee has yet to announce its decision; move is in response to Sept. 11
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu
The Bush administration is considering a policy that
would restrict international college students from majoring in subjects it believes could lead to aiding the construction of weapons of mass destruction.
Monday's Chronicle of Higher Education said the
President had formed an interagency group in October to
consider the matter. The group falls within the Office of
Homeland Security, formed after and in response to Sept.
1L Possible majors that could be restricted include nuclear

biotechnology,
engineering,
advanced computer technology and robotics.
The group does not have a specific date for when it will
technology,

chemical

release its recommendations.
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 reacted with disbelief.
"It sounds a little ridiculous to me," he said. "I don't
know what majors prepare students to build weapons of
mass destruction. I suppose physics majors, if they were
clever enough, could go on the Web to make an atom bomb.
A philosophy major could talk somebody to death. But I
think it will affect the CEP's discussion on whether to add
flight training to the curriculum."
Susan Untereker, associate dean of admissions and
coordinator of international recruitment, said she hoped
the decision, along with a new INS rule that makes obtaining student visas harder, would not discourage future
international applicants.
"I would like to think that foreign nationals would see
Swarthmore as a supportive place, despite the national

political climate," she said. "This is the kind of institution
that values who they are, without playing a political
game."
Gross saw the move as a desperate one on the part of
politicians, likening it to the federal law that denies financial aid to drug offenders.
"It's sort of the only thing they can think of," he said. "If
you're a congressman, this is the only thing you can do to
kick butt, even if it does defy logic."
Several current international students reacted similarly to Gross, with a feeling of disbelief.

"I suppose physics majors, if they were
clever enough, could go on the Web to
make an atom bomb. A philosophy
major could talk someone to death."
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62
"That's ridiculous," Begum Adalet 'O5 said. "I don't
know what else to say."
Adalet comes from Turkey and said the new rules
defeat many of the purposes of a college education.
For many of her friends back home, "they don't even
care if they get into good schools, it doesn't matter to
them," she said. "Just getting to America is the dream."
She said the new rules also defeat "the whole purpose of a

liberal arts

college and the whole goal of diversity."
Tina Stancheva 'O4 agreed that the rules made no sense.
"I'm a bio major myself," she said. "I don't think that's
the way to prevent terrorism. And some of the brightest
students are not U.S. citizens."
Many international students, she added, come to
American colleges to major in the natural sciences, espe-

cially engineering. "Very few students will come to
America to major in English or history," she said,
"because most of them come here to major in things they
can't get at home. That would really be discrimination, I

think."
Anand Vaidya 'O5, who lived in America until he was
13, then moved to India until coming back to Swarthmore,
said the move reflected "a growing xenophobia on the part
of the U.S. that scares me.
"It seems pretty obvious to me that the sort of people
who come to American colleges aren't terrorists," he said.
"I think the application process does pretty well to screen
anti-Americans."
He added that most international students who come to
the United States help stem anti-Americanism, since they
go back with 'a good understanding and sympathy of the
United States." Their views then influence others who feel
differently.
Gross said academic unions in the past "have been
effective in heading off the worst of the wrong-headed legislation." He expressed hope that would be the case this
time, adding that if the present plan came to reality, it

"would indeed have a

chilling

effect."

New INS rule will make student visas harder to obtain
Community colleges, vocational schools affected most; Swarthmore is largely untouched
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

The Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) has issued a new rule making
it harder for foreign nationals to obtain
student visas. This rule is part of "its continuing effort to enhance homeland security and strengthen and control immigration
in the United Status," the service
announced last week.
The new rule is still open to public comment and is not yet final, but it will take
effect this summer if approved. It states
that foreign nationals who wish to switch
their visa status to student must report in
person at a consulate abroad before entering the country.
The move is unlikely to have an impact
on international students at Swarthmore,
said Susan Untereker, associate dean of
admissions and coordinator of international recruitment.
"We bring in foreign nationals as
matriculated students to Swarthmore," she

said. "It's a very different playing field."
The college prepares 1-20 forms for its
international students, which guarantees
them a student visa. Untereker said
Swarthmore has never experienced problems bringing in students from overseas.
The college ensures that students have
funding for all four years of college, which
is required for them to obtain a student
visa.
According to a Philadelphia Inquirer
article, the new rule will hurt community
colleges and vocational schools the most.
"We're kind of outside of what a lot of
these issues are trying to address,"
Untereker said. "We have a very different
population here, in the sense of having 18
22-year-olds who are incredibly high
achieving kids who come from bona fide
academic institutions. They received
absolutely glowing recommendations from
the people who know them all. I think
that's a very different person than the ones
in mind. Our students are literally the
cream of the crop in their countries."
-

The move is also known as the
"Mohammed Atta rule," after one of the
Sept. 11 plane hijackers who changed his
visa to student status and received flight
training at a school in Florida. It aims to
prevent non-immigrant visitors from
extending their stay in America by pulling
off a similar switch.
"I think they're overdoing it," Gloria
Evans said. As foreign students adviser,
Evans is responsible for obtaining 1-20
forms and visas for international students.
"Up until Christmas or so, some of my colleagues were getting requests about some
of their students, especially from
Pakistan." A foreign adviser at Drexel
received roughly a request a week, she
said. Now they have slowed significantly.
Still, she added, the current system of
obtaining visas has been flawed for years,
especially considering the understaffed,
underfunded nature of the INS. "There are
a lot of so-called schools that have the
authority to issue I-205," she said. "There's
been very little checking up on whether

these students are actually coming into
school. We know who comes in, but we
don't know when they leave and where
they go when they get here."
Pennsylvania colleges had 22,279 foreign students last year, according to the
non-profit Institute for International
Education. Of the roughly 32 million foreign nationals who visit the country annually, barely two percent, or about 547,000,
are students.
More INS changes are in the works,
including the creation of an online database in which schools could record
whether foreign students show up for class,
according to the Inquirer.
Other planned government responses to
the Sept. 11 attacks have yet to take effect
A bill that prohibits granting student visas
to students from countries with governments that support terrorism was passed
in the House of Representatives, but it has
not yet reached the Senate floor.
The new rules are published in the federal register (www.nara.gov/fedreg).

INS official statement on new rules governing visitors and students
In its continuing effort to enhance homeland security and strengthen and control immigration in the United States, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) is immediately implementing rule changes governing an alien's ability to
begin a course of study and proposing significant changes to the rules governing
the period of time visitors are permitted to remain in the United States.
Additionally, INS is proposing procedures that would require an alien with a final
order of removal to surrender to the Service within 30 days of the issuance of
that order. Under the new proposed rule, aliens disregarding this duty will be pro-

4

hibited from acquiring future immigration benefits. INS is forwarding all three
rules to the Federal Register for publication and public comment.
The interim rule prohibiting non-immigrants admitted in B visitor status from

pursuing a course of study prior to obtaining approval of a change to student status takes effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register. The
change ensures that those aliens seeking to remain in the United States in student status will have received the appropriate security checks before beginning a
course of study.

The college community has responded
to news of her illness with letters of support. Sean Lanigan 'O5, an SPC steward,

He has sent an average of about 20 cards a
week.

Students in SPC described Allen as

direction and vigor in the wake of her sudden departure.
"I feel like it takes a lot of the energy out
of the group," said Diana Metrick 'O2, a
four-year member of SPC. "There's still
energy there, but it's different. I feel like
it's less centered and less intense without
her."
Because of Allen's absence, SPC had to
scale back its biannual retreat this semester, gathering on campus for an afternoon
instead of making its normal full-day
excursion to Willistown, about a half-hour
drive from Swarthmore.

make people happy," SPC
treasurer Meredith Leigh
'O4 said.
"Whenever you talk to
her, you immediately feel

'O4, another SPC steward.

As Protestant adviser,
Allen not only works
with SPC but also pro-

vides one-on-one counsel-

ing and guidance to members of the college
community, including faculty ancf*staff.
Allen is a Quaker with a graduate degree in
counseling from Harvard and is an expert
on Biblical interpretation.
For many students on campus, Allen
has been there not just as a religious advis-

but also as psychiatrist, personal mentor and surrogate mother.
"She's changed my life so much,"
Metrick said. "She's been so many things

friend, sometimes my mom, my adviser."
Although SPC is affiliated with
Protestantism, the group attracts Catholic
and non-Christian members as well.
Metrick, who is Jewish, has found the SPC
a welcoming environment for her spiritual
development the last four years, thanks in
large
part
to Allen. Like many

Swarthmore students, she feels indebted to
Allen for helping her through times of personal trial.
"I don't know how I could have gotten
through Swarthmore without her," she
said.
"She's definitely a second mother,"
Lanigan said. "She's the one adult on campus I rely on and not having her around
makes me feel less full."
Students are fond of telling stories
about Allen's kindhearted acts. She has
organized Saturday meetings where students cook for the homeless. When Leigh

According to Lanigan, Allen even took
her own hair
which had fallen out
because of chemotherapy
and crafted a
bird's nest for her backyard.
Allen, who has served as the college's
Protestant adviser since 1992, expanded her
role in recent years to encompass spiritual
issues for the entire campus. According to

Lanigan, she had been working actively to
bring together the queer and religious communities on campus.

Most recently, Allen organized a collection last Sept. 11 and a support group for
those who had suffered personal loss
because of the attacks.
Religion professor Mark Wallace
explained Allen's distinctive role in the
college community. "Pauline speaks to
students' full humanity" as no professor
can, he said. With her absence, he added,
students "lose the presence of someone
committed
to

who is
Swarthmore students' welfare and full

humanity."

by the college.

Wallace said the board has discussed

bringing in local pastors as part-time
advisers to SPC.
The group will meet later this month to
address plans for next semester, but
Wallace said the group is still too emotionally involved to come to terms with the
possibility that Allen may not be back this

fall.

"Certainly, God willing, Pauline will be
back," Frost said. "But we don't know how
long it will take."

Council elections attract numerous candidates
lege community.

BYJAREDLENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu

This week's Student Council elections will have a
number of multiple contestant races, an unusual event
considering last fall's election, when a slew of candidates coasted into positions on the council in a handful
of uncontested races.
While Ryan Budish 'O4 and Joseph Dickerson 'O4 are
running uncontested campaigns for Student Council copresident and campus life representative, respectively,
the races for the other open positions will include multiple candidates for the first time in several semesters.
Erik Munroe 'O4, Kevin Bovard 'O3 and Youssef
Soliman 'O3 are running for financial policy representative, and Doru Gavril 'O5, Neil Cavanaugh 'O3 and

Roxanne Yaghoubi

'O5 all hope to attain the position of

student groups adviser.
Two candidates, Esha Senchaudhuri 'O5 and Lester
Tran 'O3, are vying for educational policy representative.
"I've heard good things about everyone who's runping," current Student Council Co-President Liane Rice
03 said. "I'm very excited that so many people have

decided to run."

Despite the increase in candidates, one student has
already revoked his decision to run for council.
Thomas Harding 'O3 had originally filed forms to run
in the race for co-president, but he withdrew after reevaluating his commitments to other activities for the

coming year.
"I realized that I wouldn't really have the ability to
toake the time commitment," Harding said. "I'm an honors major, next year is my senior year, and it's really
just not something that I could handle."
Current council members are pleased to see that the
council is gaining more recognition throughout the col-

THE PHOENIX

"The Student Council has really done a lot this
semester, and a lot of people realized this. The more students see an active council, the more they're interested
in getting involved," said Budish, who is the current
campus life representative.
With the top position of co-president featuring an
uncontested race, however, current council members
would prefer to see more candidates in future elections.
"I think more publicity could have led to more candidates," current Co-President Matt Rubin'o3 said. "I'm
encouraged that the numbers are up from last semester.
I do think the current council should accept the blame
for lack of publicity."
This semester's batch ofcandidates includes both veteran council members and those who have never run
before.
No single issue dominates this year's platforms, but
there are a number of trends and themes.

Students debate merits of Day of Silence
BY CATHY DANH
cdanhl@swarthmore.edu
Last Thursday marked the National Day of Silence, during which certain community members did not speak as a
way to honor hate crime victims and those who must
maintain silence to avoid victimization.
During the day, well-traveled areas of the campus were
designated as "Silent Zones" in which talking was prohibited. However, the campus response to the Day of Silence
was mixed. Many who participated described it as a valuable experience, but the day was not observed as widely as
its organizers had hoped.
Five days after the National Day of Silence,
Intercultural Center Director Meghna Bhagat led a discussion in which students could reflect upon their
experience.
Students shared their thoughts on the effectiveness of
the day of silence. Pari Deshpande 'O4 remained silent for
the entire day. "It felt very successful for me and wasn't as
hard as I thought," Deshpande said. "I found myself listening more and thinking more. It was strange not to offer my
own opinions."
Deshpande added that the Day of Silence was more
about "personal success stories, rather than whole campus
success," because only a small portion of individuals was
silent for the entire day. Most people "respected it, but didn't want to do it themselves," Deshpande said.
But she added that observing silence "doesn't feel like
enough. I wanted to make a bigger difference than just
awareness."
For Dan Keyes 'O5, the day of silence "wasn't a big deal.
I didn't notice many people [being silent]," he said. "One or
two people in my history class. I wasn't exactly clear on
when they were silent and when they could speak.
"I think they could have publicized it more and better,"
he added. "They had [the day of silence] at my high school,
it seemed to be a bigger deal there." Despite the weak
response of the student body to the day of silence, Keyes

said he felt silence was "an effective tool. Silence can work.
You notice when [people] are not talking, especially when
they are wearing a sign or button explaining why they are
silent."

"It was mostly people who were
unconnected to the colored community or [queer] communities."

Reed said. "I have tons of respect for those who did it all
day. It was a good experience, I thought."
"When I was in class, I realized how difficult it was.
That kind of took away from the experience. In one of my
classes, my entire discussion group didn't speak. When I
wasn't in class, [being silent] made me think a lot more
about everything that was going on," Reed said.
The students at the meeting also noted that the campuswide silent period went virtually unobserved. Some professors, however, took a few minutes out of class time to
observe the silence.
"In my Environmental Protection class, Professor
Everbach observed a moment of silence at beginning of
class," Delgado said. Bhagat said professor Eva Travers
had brought her Urban Education class to the silent museum during the first 20 minutes of class.
The purpose of the day is "to affirm that hate crimes are

Improved fire safety, increased accessibility among committee recommendations

BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

The Parrish Hall Renovation Committee and Ayers Saint
Gross, the architectural firm hired to oversee the Parrish
renovations, have met over the past few months to gather
information and consider possibilities for the renovation of
Parrish. Students have expressed a strong desire for the
addition of a centralized student space on the first floor.
The information gathering has involved visiting administrative offices, speaking with staff about space needs,
meeting with current Parrish residents, and talking to student groups that have space in the building.
But the project is stiU in the planning stages. "No deci-

sion has been made about who will be moving in and who
will be moving to a different location," Myrt Westphal,
assistant dean of residential life, said.
Many of the ideas the committee has developed concern
the addition of a new student space in Parrish. The admissions office may move to the second floor of the North Wing;
the current admissions office area would then be open for
student use, Westphal said. The committee is considering

building a "grand staircase" leading to the admissions
office, in order to preserve its visibility and accessibility.

Alice Hershey 'O2, who represents student groups on the
Parrish Hall Renovation Committee, explained that the
committee is "interested in making [the current admissions
office area] a space that students would inhabit and use at
all hours of the day" This space would include mailboxes,
conference rooms, study areas and computer terminals.
Hershey wants to make sure that all students make use
of the student space once it is developed. "We're concerned
with getting random student use, not just formal student
groups," she said.

The committee is also considering moving the publications offices and WSRN down to the first floor or the basement. The basement would be renovated and would probably end up looking something like the bottom floors of
Trotter and Pearson, according to Westphal. The committee
hopes to better use the basement by making it into more of
a thoroughfare, like the first floor.

consolidate the Student Activities Committee office, the
Student Budget Committee office and the Student Council
meeting space. They have yet to determine which groups
would be located in Parrish. Since there is more demand
than the available space can satisfy, it is difficult to say
what will happen, Hershey said.
The committee will make a recommendation "based on
what objectively we feel needs to be in the center of campus," Hershey said.
Westphal said the renovations would reduce the number
of beds in Parrish from 160 to 90 and that there would be
only three halls, two for women and one for men. They are
uncertain whether the rooms would be all on one floor, or
all in one wing, but consider it important to "retain the single-sex character," Westphal said.
The architects met with Parrish residents on April 1 to
discuss ideas. Alexis Williams 'O4, who represents Parrish
residents on the Parrish Hall Renovation Committee, said
residents were enthusiastic about the changes. They have
many complaints, she said, including poor lighting, insufficient electrical outlets, not enough closet space, a high noise
level, too many stairs, distance from the laundry room and,

most importantly, inadequate security.
"Pretty much anybody can come up here at any time,"

Williams said.

Improvements to Parrish's internal systems are part of
the renovation plans. "We need to provide for updated
mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems," Susan Sayer,
the Parrish redesign project manager, said. They also plan
to update life safety systems by installing a state-of-the-art
fire prevention system and redesigning the staircases so
that they exit to the outside of the building.
Accessibility is another large concern, Sayer said. The
architects are working to improve vertical movement to
make getting around Parrish easier. "The fact that the center portion of the building isn't on the same level as the
wings makes it more complicated," she said. Parrish might
need to utilize multiple elevators, or at least elevators with
doors on both sides. Muller, the engineers for this project,

are presently examining the building's conditions to see
what needs to be done.
Actual construction in Parrish will not begin until the
new dorm is completed in the fall of 2004. This is due to the
fact that Parrish is going to be renovated in stages. "The
architects understand that this is a phased project. That is
what their expertise is, to make this happen with the least
amount of disruption," Westphal said.
Staggering the renovations would ensure the least possible inconvenience to the college. As offices are redone, those
staff members would have to move to the old bedrooms in

Difficulty accessing Tripod, the tri-college libraries'

online catalog, in the last three weeks resulted from a
massive hardware failure and were "completely unex-

pected," officials said.
"In the 13 years that Tripod's been up, there has
never been a problem like this," Jon Mark Bolthouse
said. Bolthouse is the systems coordinator for the tri-

college libraries.
Tammy Rabideau, the Swarthmore digital services
coordinator, said in an e-mail that she had "been here
for about three years and [didn't] recall it having been
down for more than a few hours.
"We are as frustrated as the students regarding the
down time of the system," she added. Bolthouse
described the outages as "catastrophic."
Part of the operating system for Tripod was damaged, which caused the outage, Bolthouse said. Records

were not affected, however, because of daily backups of
all the data on the system.
The first outage occurred the morning of Easter
Sunday, March 31, and the system was back up by that
afternoon. The following Sunday, Tripod was down
intermittently throughout the day. A technician from
Innovative Interfaces, the company that sold the system
to the college, flew to the college from San Francisco
and discovered that a cache was missing from the operating system.

The company, which has a maintenance agreement
with the tri-colleges in addition to selling it the hardware and software, ordered the part, which arrived the
next morning.
The system went down again Monday morning for
several hours. "We're really at a loss to figure out why,"

Bolthouse said.
Referring to other liberal arts colleges that use similar library systems, Bolthouse said that "we're the
only people I know that this has happened to."
For students, there is a Web site that provides an
alternative to using Tripod for research. The difference
between the alternative system, a national online database called Worldcat, and Tripod is "fairly slight,"
Bolthouse said. The greatest effect of Tripod's outage
was on checking and stacking books.
"I highly doubt this is going down again," Bolthouse
said.

Students work to improve Pennsylvania education
BY REIKO TESHIBA

rteshibl@swarthmore.edu

According to a report printed in the Jan. 2002 issue of
Education Week, Pennsylvania is one of the four least
equitably-funded states in terms of public education. Now,
several Swarthmore students have taken issue with the
differences between rich and poor districts through a new

branch of the organization Good Schools Pennsylvania
(GSPA).

GSPA is a non-profit, grassroots organization seeking
to improve public education. Launched in March 2001 by
a founding council composed of the Children's Defense

Fund, Public Education Network and the National
Council of Churches, GSPA focuses on lobbying in
Harrisburg, since access to public education is stipulated
by the state constitution. It is also organizes statewide rallies, holds interfaith vigils, creates college and high
school campus chapters and coordinates monthly meetings of 10-member groups in local communities.
The Swarthmore chapter is headed by Celia Paris 'O5
and Nicola Wells 'O5. They attended a campus leader training conference at Penn State University in early February.
"We learned how the solutions are implemented at
every level," Paris said. "It really galvanized me to take
action." Paris got involved with GSPA mid-semester last
fall.
According to Paris, the group's focus and style were a
big draw. GSPA is run as part of the larger group, while
most other activist groups on campus are independently

8

run.

"I liked the fact that GSPA targeted a particular issue
and had practical solutions. A lot of activism is idealistic,
but it's frustrating when it doesn't make a difference,"
Paris said.
According to the GSPA Web site, the state's share of local

education spending is decreasing. In 1974-75, the state government provided 55 percent of educational expenses for
public schools. In 2000-01, however, this number dropped to
35 percent, and the rest is made up by local districts. That
disparity creates a $227,600 difference between the richest
and poorest school district classrooms of 25 students.
Furthermore, Pennsylvania earned a D- in "resources equity" in Education Week's yearly report on public education,
making it one of the four worst states in guaranteeing educational equity for rich and poor school districts.
For this reason, GSPA focuses on advocating more
equitable funding for education, implementing methods to
improve schools and creating an accountability system of
educators to make sure that each child succeeds, according to its Web site. Pennsylvania received a B+ in
"resources adequacy" and a B- in "standards and accountability" in the Education Week special report.
Last November, Swarthmore held the first
"phonathon" for public education. Students made over 125
calls to local representative Tom Gannon (R-Holmes) to
ask him to support a proposal for the Micozzie Bill, which
would provide adequacy and equity for all Pennsylvania
students. Members also held a letter-writing campaign on
April 10 in which they wrote over 80 letters to Gannon and

April 18, 2002

Pennsylvania Governor Mark Schweiker expressing concerns for various problems with public education.
Next on GSPA's agenda is a march from Swarthmore to
Chester for educational justice, to be held April 25.
"You can walk from Swarthmore to Chester and feel
the tangible difference between the two communities,"
Paris said. GSPA will be tabling in Sharpies to get student

support for the march.
"It'll be a good way to connect Swarthmore to the com-i
munities around it," said Rob Boostrom 'O5, a member ofi

GSPA.
The organization is also planning a panel to discuss the
state of public education in Pennsylvania and possible policy changes to improve the situation. Panelists will
include education professor Eva Travers, David
Hornbeck, former superintendent of the school district of
Philadelphia, and several alumni.
In the future, Paris and Wells hope to continue letterwriting campaigns, bring outside speakers and work more
with professors and students in the education department
to make educational reform an issue on campus.
They would also like to obtain vans to rallies in
Harrisburg and organize

events with Bryn Mawr,

Haverford and the University of Pennsylvania, which all
have GSPA campus chapters.
"The purpose is for us to educate ourselves and others," Wells said. "We're constantly learning from other
groups. It's important to keep the fire alive for events that
are going on in Harrisburg. There are so many voices out
there, and we want to create a space for dialogue."

Bar no one
The new Immigration and Naturalization Services
policy for international students is a disturbing proposition at first glance. It seems to eclipse student rights, prohibiting international citizens from matriculuating at
United States institutions before the approval of their
student visas, a process that now takes many months.
However, if carried out as promised, the new policy
would have very few detrimental effects on declared
international students. Instead, it would have an impact
on international visitors who decided to study in the
United States after their arrival.
The new rule might actually help current international students. Along with tightening regulations, the INS
plans to shorten the processing time for student visas
from six months to 30 days. This is a much shorter period than the time span of the college application process;
if the INS follows up on its promise, international students should have no problem securing the necessary
documentation prior to class enrollment. In fact, the
shortened processing time would actually make life easier for these students, eliminating current visa hassles.
However, the policy mandates that would-be students
declare themselves as such upon entry, making it practically impossible for international visitors to choose to
study in the United States after their arrival. This poses
problems for international visitors who must obtain
work in the United States before attending school as well
as those who are unaware of the educational possibilities
until they arrive here. If implemented strictly, the new
INS policy could drastically reduce the number of international students, giving preference to those with the
resources to research and pay for college before arriving
in the United States.
Thus, the new visa-approval policy is indeed a disturbing one, but not for the typically assumed reasons.

The INS's new plan threatens prospective international
students, especially those coming from less developed
countries, where navigating the bureaucracy can be
extremely difficult.

Policy on criminal investigations
In line with widely accepted journalistic practice, The Phoenix does not publish the names of
those accused of criminal behavior until official
charges have been filed. After charges have been
filed or an arrest has been made in a newsworthy
investigation, The Phoenix publishes the identity of
the accused.
This week, The Phoenix has two unrelated
stories on page 3 about newsworthy investigations.
In one, two individuals who allegedly embezzled
from the college are identified, as charges have
been filed against them. The other story withheld
the name of the student investigated in a child
pornography sting, since no charges had been filed
as of press time.

Wage increase does not cause budget cuts
Dear Editor:
Last week's article on budget cuts, while accurate in
many respects, uncritically presents a misconception
which demands correction. In detailing President Bloom's
remarks, the article states, "The new staff wage, combined
with the endowment's decline, has exhausted most of the
new funds that would have been available for next year's
budget, Bloom added." As a student representative to the
College Budget Committee, I was thoroughly puzzled with
this statement. The numbers simply do not bear out the
assertion that the new staff minimum wage of $9 an hour
has been in any way substantially responsible for
"exhausting" available funds. First, the total cost to the
college of implementing the $9 minimum wage recommendation is only about $30,000. Now consider that after
decisions approved by the Board of Managers in
December (and after the endowment's decline), the money
available for new and continuing expenditures was several multiples of the cost of the new minimum wage. The $9
minimum wage policy "exhausts" available funds at the
level of less than 5.4 percent.
In fact, the staff minimum wage increase is only one
(and a small one at that) of numerous additional expenses
that have tightened this year's budgetary picture. With

unavoidable spikes in health insurance costs and ongoing
salary pressures, the overall compensation allocation for
faculty in excess of standard increases comes out to five
times the cost of the $9 minimum wage. To look at this
another way, the college saves substantial funds yearly
including this year
as a result of vacant staff positions.
The college recoups annually through staff vacancies in
the range of five to seven times the cost of the new minimum wage. Of course, some level of vacancy is natural;
however, continuing vacancies often require workers
already covering full-time duties to do more work.
April 18, 2002

Similar assertions to the one attributed to President
Bloom in last week's article have implicated the minimum
wage recommendation as a major causal factor in next
year's student fee increase (see "Tuition increase will be
higher than expected," Feb. 28). These claims perpetuate
what seems to be a clear misconception that the new minimum wage has "exhausted" budget coffers and necessi-

tated cutbacks. Actual numbers refute these as myths.

Most troubling is that such misrepresentations serve both

Academic budgets also cut
Dear Editor:
As a representative to the College Budget Committee, I

feel compelled to correct a misrepresentation in last
week's article about budget cuts. The Phoenix article gave
the impression that academic departments were somehow
exempt from the exercise of seeking ways to cut five percent from their budgets. That is simply not the case. In
fact, all academic departments were asked to find ways to
reduce their budgets by five percent. While many academic departments reported that they were unable to make
this accommodation, others were able to find creative
ways of cutting expenditures by two to five percent. On the
other hand, the article correctly indicated that no cuts
should significantly hurt the educational program.

Dear Editor:

freshman year roommate, who no longer attends
Swarthmore, suffered from a debilitating mental illness. I was
not informed of this until I asked her about her frightening and
baffling behavior. No one attempted to explain anything to me
not Myrt Westphal, not my RA, not anyone. I lived in my assigned
room for the entire year out of a misguided sense of stoic pride
and a fear of what would happen to my poor roommate if I left
and she had to live alone. Not surprisingly, I spent the spring of
my freshman year applying to transfer.
I might have been able to write my negative housing experience off as severely bad luck, but my close friend had an even
worse experience in the realm of roommate mental illness. My
friend's roommate attempted suicide during our freshman year,
waking my friend at 5 a.m. as she held a knife over her own wrist.
The combination of our two horror stories left me with the distinct impression that Swarthmore was not a healthy place to be.
Over the last four years, if any Swattie brought up roommate
nightmares in conversation, I quickly topped (or matched) everyone with one word: my roommate's official diagnosis. Despite the

anger, frustration, guilt and sadness that surrounded my freshman housing experience, I knew that no one from Psych.

Services or the college administration had been legally permitted
to inform or educate me about my roommate's diagnosis and the
severity of her disease. I also knew that I could have moved out if
I had wanted to.
Unable to figure out anyone to blame for the situation, I concluded that my protracted misery was my fault. I was wrong.
Swarthmore College failed me. Someone from the administration should have stepped in and instructed me to move. The decision about how to handle life with a mentally ill stranger was left
up to me
a naive, ill-informed 17-year-old.
Some might argue that the administration would have overstepped its bounds if it had relocated me. I firmly believe that
freshman year housing is one element of college life wherein the
principle of "in loco parentis" should vigorously apply.
The hands-off-ness of the college in my friend's case was even
more blatant and even less excusable. I met with Myrt Westphal
a few weeks ago to share my sentiments about housing and mental illness, and she let me know that the cases that I spoke about
involved two of the more seriously ill individuals at the college in
recent memory. Let's assume that my awful luck with freshman
housing and the fact that a close friend had an even worse experience than I did really was a fluke. Such an interpretation is not
very comforting, nor does it encourage anyone at the top to make
policy change. I think the administration should continue to
respect the privacy of all Swarthmore students, but I do not think
that doing so should preclude actively intervening on behalf of
the "collateral damage." Myrt Westphal informed me that this is
how the administration refers to students in my unenviable position. I think it's an apt term.
If you have had difficult/traumatic living experiences with
mentally ill students and would be willing to share your opinions
on my suggestion for a more activist administration on this
issue, please write to rwitlenl@swarthmore.edu.

played in the way that they talk
about the football players' candlelight vigil. Aside from the fact that
this has nothing to do with the rest
of the article, it seems to say that
the vigil had less value than something like the "heartfelt rally for
the living wage." The vigil was just
as, if not more, heartfelt (the protesters were actually affected by
the issues at stake) as the living
wage rally, and for them to accuse
the football players of an "innocent
idealism" is ridiculous, because
most rallies, such as the A2O
protests in Washington, are just as
idealistic.
They talk of a "more overtly
elitist world" which Swarthmore
does not belong to, and yet, by
assigning more relevance to their
causes than to the causes of others,
they partake in the elitism they so

keep talking about how "the 'values' of the A&F world are not
ours."

We feel that there is no such

thing as an "A&F world," and thus
there is no such thing as a values
system for it. We despise the fact
that you refer to Swatties as "generally less attractive." We are both
hot; very, VERY hot.

The truth is that there is nothing

they claim to despise: They stereotype Swatties just as they stereotype the A&F models. They say
that the A&F lifestyle involves
"completely vacuous" discussions.

Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to the letters concerning
the situation in Palestine-Israel that appeared in last
week's Phoenix. Ending the tragic Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza will not only benefit the
Palestinians, it will benefit the Israelis. The sooner
this happens, the sooner real peace can come to both
peoples. In his letter to the editor, Aaron Wasserman

We could express our discon-

tent about many more aspects of
the article (such as the paragraph
about self-definition: If anyone can
explain to us what that is about,
we'd love to hear it, but its coherence is invisible to us), but what is
most important for us is that the
A&F world that the authors love to
criticize so much is not real! It has
nothing to do with Swarthmore's
community. It is just an advertising campaign for a clothing brand.
The beach "lifestyle" is just for
publicity, and the models, as

shown in the article on page five of
last week's Phoenix, are normal
people like you and me. They work
and go to school. They do not
spend all their time playing beach
volleyball. We should be happy
that the A&F marketing directors
think that our campus is so beautiful that it should be in their catalogue. We are not football players,
and neither of us wears any
Abercrombie, but we resent this
attempt to protest about absolutely
everything.

There is no reason to be angry
here. There is no reason to jeer at
the Abercrombie models. There is

no reason to denigrate Ivy League

Leave the Middle East
Unbiased mediation not
possible for United States
What is happening in the Middle East right now reminds
me of a bumper sticker that a friend once told me about:
"Where am I going, and what am I doing in this handbasket?"
The intensification of the conflict is worrying, and the rapidly
increasing death toll is sickening just as it is, but the situation
is even more alarming given its links to the United States'
"war on terror." It is encouraging to hear Secretary of State
Colin Powell's statements calling for a cease-fire, as well as
President Bush's statements now that he has finally gotten
around to taking this issue seriously. And yet much worries
me about American involvement in the Middle East. The
United States is complicit in
what is going on. It must reexamine its role if the end
result of its actions is to stabi-

lize the world as opposed to
tearing it apart.

Of course, the IsraeliPalestinian issue is immensely complex and moraUy blurry. Issues and grievances have
been twisting and contorting
themselves into a real mess
over the past 50 years, and

both sides have serious moral

culpability. I would tend to put
the onus of responsibility on
the Israelis: theirs is an illegal

occupation, a fundamental
denial of the most basic
human right to self-determination, and the most grievous systematic abuse of human
rights known in the world today. By saying this, I am not for a
moment excusing militants who think that blowing up
teenagers in roadside cafes somehow guarantees them a place
with the Lord on high. One must look through the web of con
fusion, however, to those practices and policies that put in
place the spirals of violence and recrimination that we are see
ing right now. The building of illegal settlements in the occu
pied territories may be the most serious of these policies
along with the systematic destruction of all structures and net
works within peaceful Palestinian life, and it is all done in th
name ofIsraeli security.
I truly believe the above, but it is somewhat tangential to
my main argument. To finally get to the point, I wish to state
very simply that the United States is not and cannot ever be
truly neutral in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and as such is wholly inappropriate as the main mediator. The United StatesIsrael alliance is about as old as any in the world, and the military armament that Israel has including the Apache attack
helicopters used to gun down Palestinian teenagers throwing
rocks
originates in United States plants, like the Lockheec
Martin one within driving distance of this campus. On tha
fundamental level, we are all complicit, by the taxes we pa
this week, in one side of this conflict.
There are other, perhaps more disturbing, links. Israel an
the United States have both been using "war on terror" rheto
ric to define the Palestinians (and most recently Chairman
Yasser Arafat himself) as terrorists, and thus maniacal, evil
individuals bent on complete destruction, to be given no sym
pathy or quarter in the pursuit of justice. American defini
tions of terrorism are not flexible enough to include "policies
intended to strike with terror those against whom it is adopted" (according to the Oxford English Dictionary) when the
perpetrator of these policies is a state. The Israeli military has
been as responsible for such policies collective punishmen
sieges, demolitions and torture as Palestinian militants. Ye
American society, based on an age-old relationship and th
rubric of the terrorism war, portrays Israel as victim and th
Palestinians as instigators of terror.
No country is perfect, and certainly America cannot jus
drop its alliance with Israel given internal politics and skewe
national security interests. But it cannot expect to be an effec
five or impartial arbitrator. The best thing that America can
do to the Israelis and the Palestinians is to force them to dea
with one another on an equal footing through the transfer o
mediating authority to an impartial arbitrator: the European
Union, for example, or the world's moral leader Nelson
Mandela. Peace will only be achieved when the Middle East i
disentangled from America's ever-growing web of interests.

Dreaming of post-graduation fun
As a senior columnist, I almost feel as if it is my
duty to write something about the future and what it
will hold. Then something about it being unknown, followed by a wistful look back at my years at
Swarthmore. Unfortunately, I do not have any profound
words or even thoughts, but I do have desires that
relate to my future.
After years of not being an adult, graduation from
college somehow thrusts me into that role more than
any other event. With my new status comes responsibility but also the privilege of getting to do practically
anything I want. That fact is something that most college seniors come to
realize, but I am going
to propose a different
reaction to that new-

found freedom.
The

stereotype

of

most college students
about to become college
graduates is that they
are full of stress and the
frantic search for a job.

Everyone wants a job,
because that is what
one does after going to
college. You go to work
and make money and
FRANK MARTINEZ have something to show

time and tuition money.
But here's my point:
■■HMnHHaHiHi
You have your whole life
to work. Why not do something different for a little
while? The way I see it, a person's life is divided into two
main halves, School and Work, neither of which anybody really enjoys and both of which most people usually complain about. So why not add a third section in
there where you can do something that you want to do?
Ideally, everybody would be able to dividehis or her
life into School, Something I Actually Like, and Work.
But I understand that some people don't have that luxury, and I also understand that we truly are extremely
lucky, all joking aside, that we are able to prolong the
April 18, 2002

School segment as long as we all have. But that doesn't
change the fact that, if it were possible, my proposed
Something I Actually Like fragment of one's life would
really hit the spot.
In my dream world, this is how each graduating senior would find this mini-occupation. From out of the
blue, while living your normal life, you would be
approached by someone who wanted to pay you (maybe
not a lot, but enough for a year or two) to do something
for which he or she thinks you have a knack.
I came up with this scenario while attending the
Dalek and Karate show at Olde Club a week and a half
ago. As many people know, former Swattie Chang
became a member of Dalek a year or two ago. While I
don't know the details, the story goes that after spin-

ning with them at a previous Olde Club show, Chang
was offered a spot in the band. I know nothing about
Chang, but I would guess that he is thrilled to do something about which he is passionate and something that
is totally unique and off the beaten path.
My hope for a dream job for just a year or two that
would simply fall in my lap almost came to fruition
over winter break. To make what I can make into a
really long story short, Craig Counsell, the second baseman for the World Champion Arizona Diamondbacks,
coached seventh grade basketball at my former school
this off-season. And I ended throwing him a bucket full
of batting practice balls.
"You throw good BP," he told me. Unfortunately, I
was not ultimately hired as a batting practice pitcher
by the D-Backs. I'd have traveled around for a season
with the team and served up meatballs for Luis
Gonzalez and Mark Grace instead of the usual
Centennial Conference foes, making no money but having a ball and living a dream.
I hope that everyone gets a chance to live out his or
her fantasy. Perhaps you won't get to be a rock star or
part of a major league baseball organization, but maybe
the Abercrombie and Fitch agents will spot you as a
potential model. These are pipe dreams, I know, but if
we all could get our wish, just for a year, how amazing
would that be?

BY MORGHAN HOLT
mholtl@swarthmore.edu
A small red Honda Accord darts and
into one lane, barely
making it into another before a large
white semi truck cuts into my vehicular
voyeurism. The camera suddenly focused
on one of its 18 deeply grooved tires
a
shot quickly replaced by a glimpse of a
license plate accompanied by the screech
of brakes and the whoosh of passing cars.
As the credits roll casually across the
screen, wedging themselves between
bumpers and nearly touching hubcaps,
the rapid-paced sights, halting, blaring
sounds, and frantic, urgent sensation of
traffic overwhelm the theater, which is
itself bustling with traffic of a different
sort. I think all of Delaware County hit
Marple for the 7:40 p.m. opening of
"Changing Lanes."
"Swell," I thought, slumping into my
seat. If there are this many random people
dying to see Ben Affleck's latest, it's
bound to suck. The previews hadn't been
promising, paring the whole thing down
to a hokey dispute over a racially charged
traffic accident: Samuel L. Jackson as
Doyle Gibson, a poor, downtrodden black
man seeking vengeance on filthy rich,
snobby, white attorney Gavin Banick
(Affleck). Haven't I seen this a million
times before?
Sure, the Philadelphia Daily News
reviewed it well, but I know all too well
that you can't say everything's lousy, and
the competition isn't exactly stellar. The
sheer number of people filing into the theater, bumping each other's sodas, jamming elbows and stepping on my feet was
daunting. Judging from recent box office
toppers, "Changing Lanes" was destined
to be a box office hit and a total bomb in
veers, swerving

yearnings.
Optimistic as ever, I tried to shove my
misgivings out of my mind and focused
instead on how truly well Ben Affleck
filled out his Brooks Brothers' suit, only
to discover, moments into the movie, that
his character had some major personality
issues. In a mad dash to make it to court

for the review of his firm's hundred-million-dollar case, Gavin jumps into his
sleek, silvery Mercedes and speeds out
onto the freeway.
The camera cuts to clips of Samuel L.
Jackson's Doyle, adorned with coke bottle
glasses and some dated but relatively presentable digs. He is taking out a loan on a
house that redefines dilapidation; but is
perfect, he says, because it is all he can
afford. And that's after he's been
approved for the loan. But it is worth it,
we discovered, because the house is his
means of keeping his ex-wife from moving
cross-country with their sons. He only
has to get to the hearing and impart his
solution. So he hops in his early-'9os beige
Toyota four-door and pulls into a lane,
where he is almost instantly hit in
Gavin's hasty attempt to quickly change

lanes.

Doyle's car lurches forward and, out of
his control, smashes into some construction barrels. The Toyota's hood folds back
on itself, and Doyle climbs out of his car
to confront Gavin, whose Mercedes sustains only a few minor dents and scratches. Gavin rummages for his checkbook
and, as Doyle protests, hands the poor
man a blank check, gets back into his car
and speeds off, concerned only with his

punctuality

and the important trial.
"Better luck next time," he calls back to
bewildered, stranded Doyle, who fumes
and picks up the folder Gavin dropped in
his rush to shove things back into his

briefcase.

Doyle makes it to court in time to hear
the judge rule against his custody, gets
shut down by the judge's apathy and
leaves the building more furious than just
after the wreck.
Cut to a clip of Gavin in court, preparing to smother his opponents with the key
piece of evidence, the same orange folder
we watched Doyle toss idly into the trash
just moments before. He falters, scrambles for excuses and is finally dismissed
from the court with an ultimatum: Have
the folder at the courthouse by that
evening or forfeit the case.
So the two dichotomous clips merge
again as Gavin fortuitously happens upon
Doyle strolling the street in the pouring
rain. Leaning out the window of his Benz,
he hollers at Doyle, feigning apology, asking for the folder, which Doyle says he's
thrown away. Once Gavin relents and
drives angrily away, Doyle returns to the
garbage can and scrounges until he finds
the folder. He copies a page, scribbles
"Better luck next time" over the type and
faxes it to Gavin's office. How he got the
fax number we'll never know, since Gavin
didn't provide his personal or insurance
information when Doyle demanded they

handle the accident appropriately
but
this is a pervasive issue throughout the

film. I think it's assumed that all audience
members will be willing suspend their
disbelief for the sake of following the
story line.
Thus begins a full-out eight-hour war

"Changing Lanes" was not the thriller
its blurbs made it out to be. It was not
intense and riveting. At no point was I
gripping the edge of my seat, wondering
what would happen next, trying to unravel the plot's many twisting intricacies. It
was not really an intellectual pursuit, suspended disbelief aside.
Still, it was entertaining. It skimmed
the surface of some real issues, lingered
daintily on philosophical quandaries,
floated easily across racial and social
divides. It was a film about many things,
devoted more to breadth than depth. It
glossed over the more involved issues
until the very end, which nicely redeemed
most of the movie for me, proving that
light entertainment, not unlike "light" ice
cream, can be surprisingly satisfying in

the face of the obvious lack of

Come on, you know you need a break. Besides, snacks
are half-price.
The Herr's snack factory is located a little less than an
hour
away from Swarthmore
in Nottingham,

Pennsylvania. I visited not too long ago, drawn by the

enticing ads offerin a free tour (free is always good) on
the back of a potato chip bag.
Approaching the factory, I took in a breath of that

fresh country air laced with the wonderful smell of frying potatoes. Thusly, my exodus into the land of snack

foods began.

After entering the visitor's center and checking in at
the gift shop, it was time for the tour. The first stop was
a mini-theater. There was a 10-minute film about the history of the Herr Foods. Jim Herr founded the company

14

more than 50 years ago, and the Herr family still owns
and operates it today. After this brief introduction, it was
time for the long-awaited tour.

Pretzel Mania
Walking outside to an adjoining building, I found
myself looking over the mass production of pretzels.
From the gigantic dough mixers mixing more than 100
pounds of dough at a time, to the conveyor belts transporting the dough to bins to be stretched into long lines
and cut, I marveled at all the machinery, not to mention
the efficiency of the whole process. A computer controls
the entire room, and it takes only three people to keep
the room in operation.
A lesson in etiquette: Do not use the "D" Word
The next stop was tortilla chips. Large quantities of
corn meal mix were prepared and cut into the size of
chips, which were then baked and seasoned. You'll love
all the little conveyor belts and the troughs of chips
going on their way to the next room to be put into bags.
However, beware of the following faux pas: calling
these chips by the name of another popular seasoned corn
chip snack. Someone in my group jumped up to the window and said, "Wow! Look at all those Doritos!" The tour
guide then shook her head in disgust and said that Mr.
Herr would be quite offended if he had heard someone
calling his chips by the name of another company's product. So, if anything, get your social skills together as well
as your snack foods straight before going on this tour!

Curlicues
Cheese curls came next. To view their production, you
walk down a long ramp that is in a warehouse with boxes
and boxes of chips. I've never seen so many boxes, nor so
April

18, 2002

many cheese curls before at once! The curls spin around
in a cylindrical tube and are then seasoned and poured
into huge containers. After that, it was time to move on

to more root-vegetable-like snacks.
Before arriving at the potato chips, however, we made
a brief stop at packaging, where we got to watch measured amounts of chips, cheese curls and pretzels fall into
freshly made bags, which were sealed, weighed and
boxed. With all the conveyor belts, scales and people
working, you'll begin to appreciate, if not marvel at,
where your snack foods all come from.

Potato Chip Room

Walking past packing, I came upon the potato chip
room. Pounds and pounds of washed potatoes fall down
metallic chutes, where they are cut and fried in big
steaming vats. Coming out the other side, they dry quickly and go into smaller troughs, then they are carted up
into packaging. One of the highlights of the tour was eating six-minute-old chips. Pretty good.
After all the excitement, I found myself back in the
gift shop getting a free bag of, what else, pretzels. What
better way to end your visit than to stock up on mass
quantities of goodies? If you don't want food, they also
have an assortment of clothing and other sundries with
the Herr's logo on it.

Madness, musketeers, McCabe
BY JOEY SPADOLA

jspadoll@swarthmore.edu

Several nights ago, I found myself immured in the lowest,
dankest level of the library which has duly earned the title
of McCage. I was there consuming the midnight oil, with a
view to finishing some wretched assignment due on the following day. I had been at this task during several lengthy
hours, and had so long and intently worked that I had neglected to eat.
I was, as a result, famished. Intense pangs of hunger prevented me from working a minute longer. I attempted to buy
a pastry at the coffee bar, but this had already closed.
Distressed, I wandered about the library pathetically, wondering where I would procure the sustenance to complete
my impending work.
It was in this extremity of hunger that, as I was walking
back to my desk, I noticed a Three Musketeers bar perched
upon a work of Jeremy Bentham. I rubbed my eyes to assure
myself that it was no dream. Indeed, I dreamt not. Closer
inspection confirmed what appearance suggested. Yes,
before my eyes lay a full-size candy bar, uneaten and
unopened, gleaming with a hue that to my famished frame
seemed a hundred times purer than that of gold.
I of course did not delay in taking hold of the marvelous
little treasure which fortune had put in my way; and I was
on the very point of rapaciously tearing it open and consuming it, when it occurred to me that I ought in fact to
inspect the wrapper before so precipitously taking my
chances with its contents. By whom, after all, was this treat
left, I mused? And why in so strange a place? To what end?
With some criminal motives, hidden from my ingenuous
soul? These questions and more I agitated in my mind as I
examined the wrapper. And I soon discovered, or at least
believed to discover, just upon the seam, a small hole no bigger than the point of a pin or, to vary the comparison, the
point of a needle.
Or perhaps I did not see such a hole. It was difficult to be
certain about such minute estimations. It was late. My eyes
were fatigued from copious reading. I was not less weary
than hungry. A hole of these proportions can easily be mistaken for a dot of ink, or a piece of dust, or what have you.
But, whether such a hole there was is a question at the
periphery of what ensued. Fatigue and hunger urged me on;
and, neglecting all the standard motherly advice a propos
consumption of strange food, I opened and ate the bar after
which I so madly and foolishly hankered.
Eve herself, upon eating of the forbidden fruit, did not
feel such suspense and anxiety as I did in the moments
immediately foUowing my analogous deed. I stood completely still; I moved not a limb. I only tensed my muscles, as if
bracing myself for the thunderbolt of a vengeful deity. One,
two, three minutes transpired. But, the good Lord did not
strike me down. Nothing at all, in fact, happened. I felt altogether as fresh as a daisy in bloom. The candy, it seemed,
was, in the final analysis, perfectly uncontaminated and
unadulterated. I had worried myself about nothing.
Relieved, as well as satiated, I picked up the volume of
Bentham upon which the candy had reposed
as a brief
diversion to aid digestion
and returned to my desk.
"It is an acknowledged truth, that every kind of act whatever, and consequently every kind of offence, is apt to
assume a different character, and be attended with different
effects, according to the nature of the motive which gives
." Thus read the first line of the
birth to it, in so far as
great utilitarian's treatise, which I opened indiscriminately
to an arbitrary page. I followed the flowing cadence of the
sentence without the slightest difficulty, as the surfer commands the undulations of a wave, and I felt at the very summit of my acumen and sharpness.
But this state was lamentably ephemeral. The process of
digestion began to work some alchemical effect on my faculties. As I progressed down the page, my vision began to blur
by degrees. I felt intolerably dizzy. The words of the page
began to jump about and change places with one another.
Sentences bled into sentences, and paragraphs into paragraphs. I attempted to command all my powers of concentration. One sentence after another, I told myself. I strained
mightily. And suddenly the following sentence presented
itself clearly, almost imperiously, to my view: "And as for the
motives giving birth to an offence, what, Mr. Spadola, was
your motive for eating my candy bar; what, I say, gave birth
to that piece of insolency, of disrespect, and indeed of malevolence, which you have committed against my person; what
character does your act assume, in view of—
"I was very hungry, Mr. Bentham," I ejaculated impo...

Here I was cut off, for the treatise, which until that
moment had been no bigger than the average library volume, suddenly grew 100 times larger. It became, as it were,
alive. It jumped from my desk and, on the ground beside me,
drew itself up to its full height, which exceeded my own by
several feet. I immediately took to my heels, for fear of my
very life, sprinting wildly through the corridors of the
library; but this wretched book pursued me intently;
employing its front and back flaps as legs. Fear, however,
impelled my legs vigorously, and I managed to make an
escape. I hid behind a shelf of books, thinking myself, for the
moment, safe. But no sooner did I catch my breath than
another volume leapt from off the shelf behind me. This particular work, the Tragedies of Shakespeare, had the insolence to approach me closely and, with the leaves of the preface, to remove my glasses from my face.
"Give those back, you brute!" I shouted desperately.
"There is nothing I would more willing part withal,"
replied the volume in the most ghastly tone; "except my life,
except my life, except my life!"
Half dead from fright, I grabbed my glasses and again
took to flight. But, having not gone 20 feet, I was stopped in
full career by a veritable legion of human-size books. They
numbered no fewer than 20.
"

"Giants!" I screamed; "Giant books!"

"iQue gigantes?" inquired a copy ofDon Quixote.

"Why, you!" I shouted back. "From what hellish place
have you fiends sprung?"
"De I'imagination, faculte supreme et tyrannique,"
replied a volume of Baudelaire, "d'ou le raisonnement est
d'ordinaire exclu."
"And what do you want with me?" I asked.
"Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity," pronounced an oversized St. James Bible with fearful solemnity. "And ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth."
Then the phalanx of tomes began to advance toward me.
I tried again to flee, but was cornered, hemmed in on all
sides. I pleaded, I wept, I screamed; but they would not remit.
They were on the point of falling upon me, of crushing me
among their pages. And just then there sounded, as from the
heavens, the loudest siren human ears have ever heard.
Whereupon the books, all of them, in a flash, disappeared.
I found myself lying upon the red carpet of the McCabe
basement, awoken, as it seemed to me, from a lengthy stupor. Just then a student worker passed by, and let me know,
in a somewhat regretful tone, that the library was to close in
15 minutes.
At this, I packed my things, and, on hearing the self-same
siren for a second time, I quit the prison whose mere image
shall not soon desist from causing me nightmares.

Summer party music comes back in season

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Every summer needs its summer albums
sun-drenched discs that just beg to be played incessantly to become a
soundtrack for your backyard barbecues, beach-bound traffic jams, and late-August-night outdoor pontification sessions. It's been feeling a lot like summer lately, in case you haven't noticed, and I've been listening an awful lot to
these two records. Like all self-respecting summer albums, both are very accessible, incredibly catchy, more or less
danceable, upbeat, and an insane amount of fun. Coming soon to a pool party near you
...

Super Furry Animals

I used to think that the Beastie Boys probably had more
fun than anyone else in the world. Now I'm not so sure. The
Super Furry Animals are a Welsh quintet known for such
antics as riding around in blue tanks, landing a song with
over 50 utterances of the word "fuck" in the UK top 25, and
releasing the highest-selling Welsh-language album in history; they seem like they probably enjoy themselves pretty
well. More important than that, as we all know, is the ability to share that fun with the rest of us.
Without a doubt, the Animals have learned how to share.
Like the Beastie Boys, the SFAs are excellent bricoleurs. In
the way that some music geeks like to sit down with a copy
of "Paul's Boutique" and play name-that-sample, "Rings
Around the World," the Superfurries' latest opus, would
make for a lovely afternoon of reference-spotting and influence-citing. Start with a glance at some of the track titles
"Sidewalk Serfer Girl," "Happiness is a Worn Pun," "All the
Shit U Do," for instance, clearly point to a few influences,
and the lyrics contain many more (a reference to "the midnight train to Jordan"). The music is similarly referential
and eclectic. "Juxtapozed with U" is tropicalia-cheeze,
replete with vocoders. "Receptacle for the Respectable,"
which features Sir Paul McCartney on carrot-crunching
-

duties, is classic pop fare ending in a surprise self-described
"pantomime death metal" chant. "No Sympathy" starts as a
spare, folky plaint, chugs ahead and layers on the chorus
harmonies (which manage to make the line "you deserve to
die" sound utterly beautiful), and then switches gears without warning to become a Squarepusher-style bleeps-and-theblips freakout. The instrumental "[A] Touch Sensitive" is
Portishead-ish spy-movie hip-hop with strings and Stooges
samples. But this is not to suggest that the album is merely
a pastiche of pop-culture allusions and genre exercises.
Despite plenty of experimenting with technology
and a
couple instances of just plain rocking out
the predominant style of lush, melodic pop, usually with tight vocal harmonies a la the Beach Boys prevent the record from feeling
disjointed.
As for issues of originality, there is no question that
there is an incredible amount of creativity here. Unlike
other groups who draw heavily on the music of the '6os and
'7os
Spacehog, the London Suede (both of whose lead
singers share with the Superfurries' Gruff Rhys an often
uncanny similarity to David Bowie), and the Apples in
Stereo, to name a few that resonate here
the SFAs could
never be written off as simple retro-revivalists; as much for

their sheer inventiveness as for their obvious commitment

to the present day. This comes
through in their politics
the
album's title is a reference to cell
phone noise pollution, and vari-

Cornershop
For a while there, it looked like
Cornershop had arrived on the scene for
good. Not only was their indelible pop
anthem "Brimful of Asha" (a tribute to
Bollywood rather than to bosoms, though
nobody seemed to know that) in heavy rotation on MTV and, thanks to a pitch-perfect
remix by Fatboy Slim, the dance clubs, but

Halfway to Discontent," the incredibly infectious, definitely deserving 2000 release by head 'shopper Tjinder
Singh's side project Clinton, met with critical apathy. I understood
that the beat-heavy direction of that release was probably not calculated to appeal to critics who had applauded "When I Was Born'"s
amalgamation of South Asian sounds, political consciousness, and
summery pop. And I fear that the latest release from Cornershop won't
be doing them any favors in that department. But, to be honest, who
cares? The boys seem to know what they want to do, critical acclaim
be damned, and, like some other bands I could mention, they have a
ton of fun doing it. "Handcream for a Generation" trades in the marginally more comprehensible political rallying of "When I Was Born"
for a plethora of nonsense catchphrases about "making the dope dope
and the dope dope" and "the overgrown supershit." Those are quotes
from two of the record's most immediately catchy numbers: respectively, "Staging the Plaguing of the Raised Platform" and "Lessons
Learned from Rocky I to Rocky III." They also do that thing of repeating their song titles in other songs, as in the techno-stomp "Music Plus
1" and the dub reggae "Motion the 11," which reference one another so
much that it's hard to remember which is which, and also in the redhot Memphis soul of the album-opening "Heavy Soup," which includes
a Showtime-at-the-Apollo spoken welcome by Otis Clay. The most lyrically coherent track is probably a rather uninspiring reworking of the
Clinton ode to social-equality-through-dancing anthem "People Power
in the Disco Hour." Basically, these aren't the most serious lyrics ever
committed to record, and the music is nearly as silly as the words. But,
you know, that's OK. For one thing, it's danceable
the 'Bos pop and
techno cheese of "Disco and the Halfway" have left their mark, and
this disc includes collaborations with DJ Rob Swift of the X-Men for
some hip-hop fun as well. And at least they keep things interesting
even the 14-minute sitar-drenched epic "Spectral Mornings," one of the
few tracks to feature the South Asian instrumentation and Hindi
lyrics that have been a key component of past Cornershop albums,
never gets too boring. "Handcream for a Generation" is not the most
consistent album imaginable
the latter half sometimes sinks to
mere novelty and retreads of past achievements
nor the most revelatory. But it's got plenty to make me happy. Why can't those critics
just lighten up?

because her listed address was a vacant

property in Philadelphia and investigators
spent several months trying to track her
down, according to Craig.
Following her arrest, Selby-Hobbs was
released from custody on her own recognizance. A preliminary hearing before
District Justice Stephanie Kline was scheduled for April 8, but the defendant requested a delay until May.
The results of this hearing will largely
determine the extent of further investigation into Selby-Hobbs, Craig said.
"Following that, we'll know whether she

pleads guilty or not guilty and have a better idea of where we're going from there,"
he said.

Investigators are still looking into
Abraham's involvement. Neither Craig nor
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave
could offer conclusive information, but
they believe Abraham's role involved considerably less direct contact with the
Swarthmore campus. Abraham "was never
on campus that we know of," Redgrave

said.

He is currently held at Schuylkill
Correctional Institution in
Minersville, Pa., on unrelated charges.

Despite the magnitude of the theft, the
college will not lose much financially as a
result. Insurance will cover almost all the
missing funds. Redgrave noted; however,
that the insurance companies will likely

seek restitution.

Following the incident, the college has
taken steps to prevent such an occurrence
from happening again. "The library has
taken steps to close some loopholes that
were discovered since the incident
and
has already instituted different procedures
from the past," Redgrave said.
Redgrave also made it clear that,
although Selby-Hobbs worked for the college, she was a temporary employee hired
through an agency, a feature that distinguished her from much of the staff. "The
relationship between the college and the
temp agency is a fragile one," he said. In
such situations, the temporary agency
hires, conducts background checks and
often takes the responsibility for paying its
employees. A temporary employee "is
quite different from a college employee in
many ways," he said.
Following the incident, the college severed ties with the temporary agency that
provided Selby-Hobbs, Redgrave said.

STUDENT GROUPS ADVISER

EDUCATIONAL POLICY REP.

FINANCIAL POLICY REP.

Roxanne Yaghoubi 'O5

Lester Tran ’O3

Erik Munroe 'O4

I'm running for Student Groups Adviser because I think
extracurricular activities deserve better support. As a leader of
several groups this year, I have seen how even seemingly small
problems can cause a student group to become less active and
lose membership. Such problems include:
The number of spaces where groups can meet is limited. I
hope to establish an online reservation system for meeting
*

areas. Additionally, there would be an online calendar where
students could post meeting times.
Currently there are groups that receive a surplus offunding and others that do not receive enough. I hope to work with
the Student Budget Committee and the Council to ensure that
appropriate funding and a more transparent allocation process.
Many groups do not have an up-to-date charter. I would
encourage each group to constantly re-evaluate its charter if
the group's focus changes. This would make funding easier
and make each club's focus clear to potential members.
I would be honored to be Student Groups Advisor, and I
promise to try to effect these changes to the best of my ability.

Doru Gavril 'O5

Every year, you pay a $278 activity fee
that's whv it's
YOUR job to put efficiency back into the Charter Committee. As
Student Groups Adviser, it'll be MY job to keep an eye on your
money and report back. To YOU.
The Four-Point Contract
MONEY. Groups receive better funding when we cut the red

tape, eliminate the overlapping expenses of similar organizations, and free up money for student initiatives.
DIVERSITY. Squeezing every group into some umbrella
forum, "so they can get more money," is not a solution. That's like
putting the Democrats and the Republicans in the same "forumfor-political-activism." I bet that reduces the costs, but what's left
of our pluralism? Let's charter ALL worthwhile groups.
CHARTERS. The process of writing a charter and presenting
it will require no more than 10 hours' work. We value your time.
AVAILABILITY. A state-of-the-art Web site with online feedback, 24-7, will connect you to me. Want to know who's doing a
similar project and work together? It'll be just a click away.
I'm not running for political "glamour," and I won't ditch you
midstream. I'm in this game for you, and I'm playing to win.

Neil Cavanaugh 'O3

The position of Student Groups Adviser necessitates a representative with experience. The SGA works with both Student
Council and Student Budget Committee to ensure that the
Student Activities Fee is utilized in a manner that maximizes
the number of high-quality activities Swatties take part in. I am
running for this position because I have the experience and
expertise necessary to ensure that the $273 each person pays is
distributed to represent the interests of every part of this campus. My experience as the Campus Relations Representative
would serve me well as I aided Student Council in their broad
array of initiatives, and my present position on Student Budget

Committee has undoubtedly prepared me to act as the liaison
between Student Council and SBC. So vote for experience and
feel comfortable that a knowledgeable council member will be
looking out for the interests of your student group.

CAMPUS LIFE REP.
Joseph Dickerson 'O4

Since being at Swarthmore I have involved myself in several student advocacy roles. Most notably I was on the search
committee that recently hired the Multicultural Dean. As
Campus Life Representative I would seek implementation of
five specific projects:
1) I would seek better recognition of holidays.
2) I would devise a plan to give us adequate laundry facilities.
3) I would make sure students had a voice in renovation

Plans.
I would work with Dining Services to extend Sharpies dining hours.
5) I would work to increase the number of minority faculty on
campus, most specifically Latino and Asian faculty.
Please consider me for Campus Life Representative.
4)

THE PHOENIX

Education policy on this campus deserves diverse ideas
and positive input from the student body. As an individual
dedicated to his responsibilities, I would like to be your representative on the following critical issues:
Faculty advising: to reform the current system so that all
students, regardless of major or class year, receive excellent,
equitable and personalized academic advising
PDCs and First-year seminars; to create a forum by
which more students can contribute to the current debate on
how to reform the PDC system
Course-evaluation guide: to ensure that the publication
provides an accurate description of each class, supported by
diverse opinions, in the hopes of improving all courses
Having worked with students on pioneering the successful CLP program and having worked with faculty and
administrators on the Diversity Task Force and ADVICE, I
have the experience and determination to make certain each
of these issues is addressed.

Esha Senchaudhuri 'O5

Diverse and broad academic curricula are among the fundamental goals of a liberal arts education. If elected
Education Policy Representative, I would pursue the following methods to broaden and strengthen academic curricula;
First, I would work to increase the number of interdepartmental courses, allowing students who have mastered
introductory courses in different departments to interact
with each other on issues related to both academic fields.
These courses enable professors with different backgrounds
and teaching styles to collaborate, thereby yielding unique
learning experiences for both professors and students.
I would also encourage department-sponsored workshops
to give students an opportunity to learn from every department. This would give students with many major requirements the chance to explore without committing to a course.
Additionally, I plan to organize an Academic Help Center
that would provide one place where TAs, natural science
clinicians, WAs and SAMs could all be found. Such a system
would only enhance these already available programs by
making them easier to access.
These objectives would expose us to a diverse arrangement of academic fields and increase access to academic aid.

CO-PRESIDENT
Ryan Budish ’O4

As Campus Life Representative I have worked to keep the
promises I made. I created the 17-meal plan, started a review
of disability services, worked with Public Safety to place
more lights on campus, helped change financial aid policies,
and worked to improve Dining Services.
Student Council has done a lot, but too many students

don’t know what it does or don’t think it can make a difference in their lives. Student Council needs to show students
how it can help them. In order to do this, two things must
happen: First, council must continue to improve the school
for students. Second, it must do more to reach out to them.
Two of the many issues council should address:
The issue of safety needs to be addressed with more
call boxes and a task force designed to quickly resolve safety concerns.
Student wages must be fixed. Some students are paid
according to the wage rules, while others get double time
and stipends. Council needs to find a more equitable solution, even if it means raising the pay scale.
Council must be more accessible and accountable:
Council should move back to Parrish Parlours.
Members of council should table in Sharpies. Student
Council should meet occasionally at other times, because
every student should have access to council.
I want to lead Student Council in accomplishing these
goals. I have the experience and the dedication to do it right.
Over the past year, I hope I have gained your trust as a member of Student Council who gets things done. I ask for the
chance to show what Student Council can do for you. Get
More from Swarthmore.

April 18, 2002

I'm running for Financial Policy Representative for a
simple reason: I believe that a number of financial policies
of this college could be improved, and I would work to do
just that. Take meal equivalence as an example:
Board expenses/year: $3,974
Meals/year: 609
Sharpies food: Priceless
Just kidding
Price of each meal: $6.53
That's if you go to EVERY meal served from the first
day of the semester until the last day of exams. How many
people never miss a meal? Looking at the more realistic
example of 14 meals/week, it's more like this:
...

Board: $3,974
Meals attended: 423
Price of meals: $9.39
Average meal equivalence: $3.21
I know Swat needs to make money to pay its expenses,
but giving us one-third of what we pay for is ridiculous.
I would make sure your money is spent judiciously. Next
semester, SC is working on student wages and financial aid.
both part of the college budget. My past experience in similar organizations would help me jump right into these
issues and my role on the College Budget Committee. I'd
always be available to discuss any concerns you had- I
believe these characteristics make me the best person for
the job. Ask someone who knows me. And vote Erik Munroe

for Financial Policy Representative.

Kevin Bovard 'O3

Keep in mind that these are simply my ideas for the year.
I make no promises, only the guarantee that I will work
hard in trying to achieve these goals.
For a year, the college administration has been proclaiming its newfound commitment to athletics, yet students are forced to spend $50,000 to fund rugby, Frisbee, and
men's volleyball because the college refuses to pay; nearly
all of that comes from the $2BO student activities fee. If just
half of club sports' costs were paid by the administration,
there would be an extra $25,000 to pass back to student
groups that are desperate for funding. I will work to reclaim
the activities fee for it's main purpose: providing activities
for students, not subsidizing the athletic department.
Swat students pay for laundry while students at other
colleges are not charged for this necessity. Some opponents
of free laundry say it would encourage inefficiency, so I propose a balanced alternative: Eliminate the charge for using
dryers. A disincentive for wastefulness would still exist, yet
students could enjoy greater convenience and affordability.
Council should provide a photocopy code to each candidate who runs for an SC position. This would serve as an
equalizing force for less affluent candidates and encourage
reasonable spending on campaigns. It would also ensure
that good candidates aren't dissuaded from running for fear
of losing money on a lost election.

Youssef Soliman 'O3

My main interest in running for Financial Policy
Representative is to give students more input in the College
Budget Committee. This is where the major decisions about
funding for almost everything take place. I have served on
the Student Budget Committee for the past year, and it's
given me a good idea of the student body's financial priorities. In addition, as the co-president of the International
Club, I've worked to organize social events that students
have really enjoyed, and I would like to take this a step further by planning events for the whole student body.
Some of my more specific goals include sending vans to
the destinations students want
such as restaurants and
entertainment on the Baltimore Pike
and also in advertising the shuttle schedule better. I want to work to improve
and expand club sports in light of the football team cut.
Another idea is to try to add some variation to the speakers and the entertainment we bring to campus, possibly
including some more popular figures in the mix of academic speakers the school already gets.
If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.

Near-misses send
baseball into skid
Scott Kushner, swinging at left, and
the Garnet Tide have improved their
play but haven't been able to eke out
a win late in the season.
In the Tide's last two games, against
Franklin & Marshall Tuesday and in
the second game of a doubleheader
against Johns Hopkins Saturday, the
team has built a multiple-run lead
only to fall victim to a late-inning
comeback. Against the Diplomats,
Kushner's 4-for-6 offensive performance led the team to an 8-6 edge in
the seventh inning. But the Garnet
defense did not hold, giving up seven
runs in the ninth inning to send the
Tide to their ninth consecutive loss.
Earlier in the week, the Garnet Tide
had Johns Hopkins on the ropes in
the fifth inning of a seven-inning
game, scoring three runs to take a
4-1 advantage. With two outs in the
sixth, the Garnet couldn't manage to
close the inning, allowing the Blue
Jays to even up the game. In the
seventh inning, the Tide were unable
to silence the Hopkins bats, giving up
two runs to fumble away what would
have been their third victory.

Women's tennis
evens record to 8-8
Garnet rolls over Ursinus 8-1 late last
night, looks toward championships
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

Last week, the women's tennis team continued to
dominate at home, easily defeating Centennial
Conference rivals Haverford and Bryn Mawr. Although
the team's overall record is a subpar 7-8, the Tide are an
impressive 3-1 at home, with their only loss coming to
the top team in the conference, a 6-3 defeat by

Washington College.
"Our team has rebounded from a couple of very close
losses
6-3 to Washington College and 5-4 to Johns
Hopkins," head coach Dan Sears said.
"The team has been playing well recently," Megan
Speare 'O5 added. "We have won the last few matches we
have played."
On April 9, the Tide defeated Haverford 7-2. "We were
looking forward to playing Haverford this year, since
they were our toughest competition last year," co-cap-

tain Kristina Pao 'O2 said.
Pao was a double winner in the first doubles and second singles matches against the Fords. She teamed with
co-captain Anjani Reddy 'O4 to defeat Fords opponents
Alyssa Kennedy 'O2 and Anya Moyston 'O5 in the first
doubles match, 8-5. "Anjani and I had a tough doubles

Jackie Kahn, left, and Amy Dißenedetto, right, look to double the ball in Monday's overtime victory over Stevens
Tech. Kahn scored the game winner 14 seconds into the second overtime period. The team is now 8-4 overall.

Team effort key to 6-game streak
From WOMEN'S LAX, pg. 24
Widener was overshadowed by the

team's loss, her sports-

manship has set her above her competitors. After the Bryn
Mawr game, Tarr's defender said that she was impressed

by Tarr's overall sportsmanship. That little anecdote in
turn impressed Borbee a great deal.
"You can get all kinds of awards," Borbee said, "but, if
people don't respect you, it doesn't mean anything."
The team closed off the hectic week by hosting
Muhlenberg on Saturday. A showcase game for both
Family Weekend and the team's Senior Day, the game was
played in the stadium on Clothier Field. Arguably the most
competitive team the Tide had faced since Dickinson, the
Mules quickly succumbed to the Tide's scoring rampage,
trailing 8-2 at halftime. Senior Day seemed aptly named, as
the senior attackers scored all of the Tide's 10 tallies. Tarr
had four, Biss three, Cariello two and Levy one. Senior
defenders Kile and Carly Hammond anchored the defense,
combining for eight ground balls and two caused
turnovers. Tri-captain Drea Figueroa 'O2 was a key playmaker in the Tide's offense. Also honored was Amy
Dißenedetto 'O2, who was taking the foreign service exam
and was unable to return to campus in time for the game.
With five straight wins under their belts, the Garnet
hosted Stevens Tech in a late addition to their schedule on
Monday. The Ducks took advantage of an unfocused
Garnet defense to take a 5-1 lead 16 minutes into the first
half. After a timeout, Swarthmore jumped back into the
game when Levy took control of the draw, sprinted down
the field and took a quick high shot. The eight-second play
fueled a four-minute Garnet scoring run, and the Tide
evened it up at 5-5. The Ducks responded with a scoring
run of their own, leading 8-5 with 4:35 to go. The final minutes of the half were played at a frantic pace with both
teams trading goals off of fast breaks until Rebecca
Rodgers 'O4 scored right at the buzzer to bring the halftime
score to 9-7 Stevens Tech.
After the break, Tarr scored four of her seven goals as
the Tide took the lead 13-12 late in the second half. The
Ducks' Jess Soltysik scored with 1:14 left in regulation to

22

send the game into overtime.
After Steven's Tech opened the first overtime period
with a quick tally, the game looked to be a repeat of the
Widener matchup, until Tarr scored off of a free position to
even the score. The team shook off the threat of an overtime curse when Kahn rocketed a high shot past the
Ducks' keeper 14 seconds into the second overtime period.
Swarthmore ran out the clock to seal the 15-14 OT win.
"Stevens Tech was a huge mental win," Borbee said. "It
should give us a lot of confidence, not only as a team, but
individually as well."
"What makes the wining streak worthwhile is Stevens
Tech," said Tarr. "It was a huge test for the team to be able
to rally and come back in overtime and win."
The game also gave Borbee her 99th win as a lacrosse
coach at Swarthmore, although she down plays the milestone. "It's just a number." Her sucess is a reflection of the
respect that the players have for their coach.
With three games left in the season, all of them
Centennial Conference matchups, Borbee and the team's
goal is to stretch the win streak to nine.
"I'd like to finish out the season with a nine-game
streak," Borbee said. "Our priority is the Centennial
Conference, and we're going to go after the last three
games one at a time."

match against Alyssa and Anya," Pao said. "A lot of the
tough points had to do with nerves."
Reddy and Pao also picked up wins in their singles
matches, along with teammates Speare, Katherine Voll
'O3 and Katie Berry 'O5.
Voll climbed back from a 3-0 deficit in the second set
to defeat her Ford opponent 6-3, 6-4. "Katherine Voll has
been playing really well this semester. She and [assistant coach] Mike Goldsmithhave been working, and she
has stepped up her game to the next level," Pao said.
"The team played extremely well last week, particularly in the Haverford match, where a few of us were up

against some stiff competition," Voll said.

"With two matches to go, we are
playing much better than we were
early in the season."
Dan Sears, head coach
On April 11, Swarthmore defeated Bryn Mawr 6-3.
"Bryn Mawr was stronger this year down the line than
they were last year, which was a little unexpected," Pao
said.
Reddy, Speare, Voll and Sarah Fritsch 'O4 picked up
wins in their singles matches for the Tide.
Voll and co-captain Laura Swerdlow 'O2 also teamed
up for a rare opportunity to play at second doubles.
"Laura and I won 8-3, which was huge, because we don't
usually play second doubles together, and we did really
well," Voll said.
After a 0-5 start, the young and talented Tide is looking forward to the Centennial Conference championships and next season.
"Having had a tough spring break, playing the top
schools in the region, the team morale going into the
season was a little down. However, our first wins raised
our confidence," Pao said.
"With two matches to go, we are playing much better
than we were early in the season," Sears said. "We look
forward to the Centennial Conference Championships
the weekend of April 27 and 28 at Haverford, where we

expect to be competitive for both the singles and doubles
title."
The players are excited about the team's future as
well. "The team is not as united this year as I predict it
will be next year," Speare said. "The team still needs bet-

ter leadership, solidarity and organization."
"Our team is really young this year," Voll said.
"More than anything, we lack experience, which is why
I think next year we'll be much stronger. The girls have
a lot of heart and seem willing to work hard."

Garnet Tide defeated by No. 3 Shoremen
Men's lax prepares for Haverford showdown
BY JUSTIN KANE
jkanel@swarthmore.edu

Despite the searing heat on Clothier Field and
Washington College's black road uniforms, nothing could

wilt the Shoremen's defense Wednesday afternoon.
Possession after possession, the Swarthmore offense
mounted an assault on the Washington College goal. And

possession after possession, the Shoremen stymied the
Tide, forcing them into turnovers, bad shots, errant passes
and penalties.
It wasn't until midfielder John Cleaver 'O4 darted past
his defender, quickly stepped behind him and rifled a shot
past Washington College's goalie with 1:21 left in the first
half that the Garnet Tide put themselves on the scoreboard. By that time, the Shoremen had built a 6-1 lead and
had the game so firmly under control that they coasted to
a 12-3 victory.
The ferocious defense was not unexpected
Washington College is currently ranked No. 3 in the nation
in Division 111. Indeed, it was a demonstration of the kind
of effortless domination with which a national championship contender plays. Even though the Shoremen (10-1,41 Centennial Conference) were misfiring on offense and
clearly slowed down by the heat, Swarthmore (5-8, 0-5 CC)
was hard-pressed to clear the ball successfully, much less
to create offensive opportunities.
What little offense the Garnet Tide did create came
mainly from blazingly quick individual plays
all three
Garnet goals were unassisted. Like Cleaver, midfielder
Than Court 'O3 scored both his goals by capitalizing on a
quick first step; he managed to repeat the move late in the

fourth quarter after scoring in the third period.
Swarthmore's defense and goalkeeping turned in a
solid performance, keeping an explosive Washington
offense to its third-lowest scoring game of its season.
Goalkeeper Steve Isbister 'O4 frustrated the Shoremen's
attack frequently, despite being under constant pressure.
Nobody expected Swarthmore to win or even to stay
within five goals of the Shoremen. For many of the
Swarthmore players, the game served as a tune-up for
matchup with rival
Saturday's much-anticipated
Haverford. The Fords (2-10, 0-5 CC) lost 18-4 to Washington
last week. For both Swarthmore and Haverford, the game,
at Clothier Field at 1:30 p.m., is an opportunity to salvage

winless conference schedules.
By this measure, the Garnet Tide's performance
against Washington College was a success. The
Swarthmore defensemen will be well-prepared for
Haverford's sophomore duo of Eric Seideman and Mike
Fischette after dealing with the Shoremen's dominant
attacking trio of Eric Kuehn, Jon Fellows and Craig
Rentch, who combined for nine of the Shoremen's 12
goals. Seideman and Fischette have accounted for nearly
half of the Fords' goals this season, and keeping the two
in check will force Haverford to turn to less potent
weapons.

The primary questions for the Tide arise in their transition play. If Swarthmore can consistently clear the ball

from its defensive third and avoid careless turnovers
while setting up the offense, the Garnet Tide should be
able to exploit a young Haverford defense.
Head coach Pat Gress said that his own young team has
met its goals for the season even without a win against

Although the Diplomats were a young
team, they were still very physical and

Tide rebound from region losses Streaking laxers
rebound in overtime
Tarr paces Tide to 15-14 20T win over
Stevens Tech; Borbee gets No. 99
BY KATE NELSON-LEE
knelson2@swarthmore.edu
It's been two weeks of numbers for the women's lacrosse team.
Seven games in 12 days. 30 goals from Katie Tarr 'O2, breaking the
Centennial Conference career scoring record. Win No. 99 under
head coach Karen Borbee. A six-game winning streak, the first
since 1995.
For Borbee, it's not the numbers that matter, but how the team
has bounced back from the four-game losing skid the team found
themselves in after dropping a heartbreaking 15-14 overtime contest to local Widener two weeks ago.
"After the Widener game, there was the point when we decided to be a team both on and off the field," Borbee said, "and we
took control of the rest of our season."
Borbee cited the team's recent togetherness as the reason
behind the team's recent success.
The Garnet took their new attitude into their next game
against Dickinson with a vengeance, outscoring the Red Devils 110 in the first half. Tarr dominated the attack with five goals and
four assists, while Mavis Biss 'O2 and Mariam Levy 'O2 added four

and three goals, respectively. On the other end of the field, keeper
Jenn Hart 'O3 saved 70 percent of the Red Devil shots, while
Heather Kile 'O2 caused five turnovers for the solid Garnet
defense. The team paced out the second half to bring home the 155 victory and their first Centennial Conference win of the season.
After taking Sunday off, a smaller Swarthmore squad headed
to Cedar Crest College on Monday, April 8. With just 16 players
from their 29-strong roster, the Tide used the non-conference
match up to hone their individual skills. Emily Szydlowski 'O5
had her first career start as defensive wing and scooped up two
ground balls and caused a turnover in the 17-4 Swarthmore win.
Seven different players scored, with Tarr leading the charge with
five while Kim Cariello 'O2 and Jackie Kahn 'O4 each had three tallies.
The team extended its winning streak to three the next day
with a 20-8 win over Chestnut Hill. The Tide dominated the undermatched Chestnut Hill team with a 17-2 halftime score. The game
was another opportunity for the rookies, with Ele Forbes 'O5 and
Alexis Turner 'O5 each tickling the twine three times for their first
hat tricks.
Thursday saw the return of Centennial Conference play when
the team hosted cross-town rival Bryn Mawr. Bolstered by a new
coaching staff that includes Swarthmore alum Amber Adamson
'Ol, the Mawrters kept Tarr to just one goal.
"All Centennial Conference teams try to limit Katie," Borbee
said. "But Bryn Mawr's goal was to keep her from scoring com-

pletely."

No. 2 singles player Justin Singer lines up a stroke in his match against University of Rochester's
Dan Williford. Singer lost the match, 6-3, 6-2, but the Garnet Tide narrowly triumphed over Rochester,
4-3. Jayson Yost, Ben Rae and Justin Durand recorded victories in singles for Swarthmore, and wins
from John Thomas and Frank Visciano at No. 1 doubles and Rae and Mike Noreika at No. 3 doubles
secured the doubles point and the win for the Tide.
The victory broke a four-game losing skid for the Garnet, who had most recently fallen to No. 7
Washington College and to No. 5 Emory University. But the team suffered a narrow 4-3 defeat to
Bates on Tuesday despite singles wins by Thomas, Visciano and Yost. With the loss, the Garnet fell to
8-6 on the season, which closes on Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. against Haverford.

Tarr's ability to recognize the importance of taking herself out
of the offence, and therefore taking the Bryn Mawr defender with
her, opened opportunities for her teammates to create scoring
opportunities. Biss and Cariello each had five goals wile Levy and
Kahn added three and two respectively. Tarr assisted two of those

goals.
Borbee commended Tarr for her head in the game, "The way
Katie handled herself in the Bryn Mawr game when their objective was to face-guard her was impressive. Lots of scorers would
let it frustrate them, but Katie kept her composure."
