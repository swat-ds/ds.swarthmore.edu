Students organize to get out the vote
SVRC and College Democrats coordinate efforts for Swatties to get area residents out to the polls on Nov. 2
Pennsylvania.

BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu
Now that registration deadlines have passed,
Swarthmore students concerned with the voter turnout in
Delaware County are shifting their target from Chester
streets to the very homes of potential voters.
Facilitated by the Swarthmore Voter Registration
Coalition, students have been offered various "Get Out the
Vote" volunteer opportunities to go door-to-door on
Election Day to assist Delaware County residents, including Swarthmore students and staff, in getting to the polls.
"This is a very important election regardless of your
party affiliation," SVRC co-founder and co-chair Ethan
Ucker 'O7 said. "We're responsible for only the nonpartisan
opportunities, but we want to give students the choice to
get out the vote in any way they want."
The SVRC is running nonpartisan efforts both on campus and, with Delaware County Wage Peace and Justice, in
Chester and Upper Darby, to help those whom the SVRC
previously registered to get to the polls, Ucker said.
"Our task will be to remind registered voters of information about their local polling place and make sure
things run smoothly," SVRC board member Sam Berger 'O5
said. Volunteers will be needed on Election Day to phonebank from campus, go door-to-door to the homes of voters
registered by SVRC and drive voters to the polls free of
charge, he said.
"I'm hoping for 100 to 150 students to help out," Berger
said.
In addition to its voter involvement efforts, SVRC will
also compare voting rolls, obtained from the Swarthmore
Borough Community Center which list all registered vot-

ers in Delaware County, with its own database of voters
that it helped to register.
"We'll have lawyers on call in case our database doesn't
match the official list," Ucker said. "There's a history of
disenfranchised college students in Delaware County."
According to Ucker, the three partisan GOTV opportu-

nities are all Democratic efforts, though they were not
sought out by SVRC. Even though SVRC is not officially
sponsoring these efforts, they were included in an e-mail
from the coalition to those students on the SVRC e-mail list
that describes all Election Day activities available.
America Coming Together, an organization that is partisan but not working under the direction of the
Democratic Party, is conducting what spokesman Andrew
Poag has called the "largest grassroots voter registration
effort ever before." The national organization is now focusing its efforts on swing states and has 11 offices in

The group's efforts are similar to those of the SVRC
except that they target only Democrats. ACT is seeking
Swarthmore students to go door-to-door on Election Day,
asking registered Democrats in Delaware County if they
have voted and to provide information about the local
polling place.
Students who work from

noon until 8 p.m. will be paid

$6O.
Poag is expecting many workers from the Swarthmore
community because of their personal investment in local

issues, predicting their dissatisfaction with the way the
Bush Administration has dealt with them. "Among other
reasons, Pennsylvania lost 95,000 jobs in the last three
years," he said. "So this is a very important election for
many students who might be staying in the state to work
after they graduate."
ACT college recruiters Jess Work and Liza Clark have
been on campus several days this week signing students
up to work on Election Day. Although they appreciate the
nonpartisan efforts of SVRC, they stress the importance of
the Democratic vote in Delaware County.
"Election Day is not the day to be nonpartisan," Work
said. "Plus, there's a history of voter intimidation for
Democrats living in Delaware County."
Work and Clark are hoping for over 100 student workers from the college. As of dinner on Tuesday, 70 students
had signed up.
The other partisan GOTV efforts on campus will be run
by the Swarthmore College Democrats, affiliated with the
Democratic Party, and the MoveOn Leave No Voter Behind
Campaign, not affiliated with the party but dealing solely
with Democratic voters.
With help from volunteers, College Democrats will be
providing transportation to the polls for registered
Democrats in Chester and surrounding areas.
"We'll be following the campaign's direction, making
phone calls and helping with transportation to the polls,"
College Democrats treasurer Patrick Hart 'O6 said. For
those who are not comfortable working under the
Democratic Party, Hart encouraged volunteering for SVRC
or ACT. "ACT's a great organization," he said.
The MoveOn Leave No Voter Behind Campaign will
begin its "Four Days to Avoid Four Years of Bush" the
weekend before Election Day. MoveOn will be on campus
this week looking for callers, canvassers, drivers and poll
monitors to inform and assist Democratic voters in
Delaware County during these four days.

Martin Warner and individual professors to address the

macroeconomic theory.
The two papers for which they were
awarded the prize were published
between 1977 and 1982 and argued that
changes in supply and technological
advances are the primary cause for eco-

nomic variations.
"Fluctuations are

exactly what dynamic economics predicts," Prescott said.
His work went against what was previously the common wisdom that market
fluctuations are primarily caused by
changes in demand, like money supply
and investment demand, according to economics professor Philip Jefferson.
"I realized that the profession didn't
know what it was talking about," Prescott

Jefferson described this view as emerg-

ing from the theory that changes in supply
affect economic changes more than
changes in demand. "If policy-makers
have an unrealistic view of the economy's
potential then they are likely to do more
harm than good when trying to raise the

level of output," he said.

According to dynamic economic theory, pioneered by Prescott and Kydland, it
is more natural for demand to meet supply
than for supply to meet demand. If policymakers expect more production than is
actually possible they will pump too much
money into the market causing inflation,

Jefferson said.
Prescott's work caused huge waves in
the economics world after it was original-

ly released.

"Prescott's work was highly controversial and the fact that for a decade or more
the profession had to react to his work
and some even tried to refute his work
is, in itself, a testament to the work's
importance," Jefferson said.
Shortly after winning the Nobel Prize,
Prescott signed a letter released by the
George W. Bush's campaign criticizing
Democratic Presidential candidate John
Kerry's plan to roll back tax cuts for families earning $200,000 or more.

Prescott, who graduated with a major
in mathematics, was captain of the football team and a member of the Delta

release from DU.
Prescott is the fourth Swarthmore
alum to be awarded a Nobel Prize.
He is currently the Senior Monetary
Advisor to Federal Reserve Bank of
Minneapolis and an economics professor
at Arizona State University.
Previous Swarthmore alumni who
have won the Nobel Prize are Christian

Harrassing calls
prompt policy change

CAMPAIGN POSTCARD

BY IVAN BOOTHE
iboothel@swarthmore.edu

Little progress has been made in the investigation into
dozens of harassing phone calls made to female
Swarthmore students from an off-campus number. No calls

have been reported since Oct. 8, however, and Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave said they were "crossing
their fingers" that the string ofcalls had finally abated. The
incidents, however, have prompted a change in the college's process of handling harassing calls.
The calls, placed early in the morning and to female students, involved a speaker with a male voice telling the student how "beautiful" she was. No reports of any new calls
have been filed with Public Safety in the past two weeks.
Redgrave placed the total number of students who were
called at "roughly 40."
Emily Cordon 'O6, a recent recipient of a call and a
Willets RA, said many of the women on her hall had also
received calls. "I was disturbed to find out that almost half
of the girls on the hall
almost one call per room
had
received a call," she said.

Vice presidential candidate Sen. John Edwards spoke to a packed crowd at a rally at Haverford on Tuesday. Other
local politicians also gave speeches at the event.

Edwards rally rocks Haverford
BENJAMIN BRADLOW

The Tri-Co schools rarely, if ever,
get any A-list entertainment acts.
But on Monday, a true political rock
star came to Haverford College.
The event, a town hall meeting

candidate
Sen. John
drew
dozens

Edwards,
Swarthmore students and scores of
students from Haverford, Bryn
Mawr and other area schools, along
with local residents.
Though the rally was only
announced the previous Thursday,
the line of people waiting to get into
Haverford's Alumni Field House
snaked through a large part of the
Haverford campus. According to
Sam Berger 'O5, an extra Tri-Co
shuttle stopped at Haverford to
accommodate the unusually high
number of Swarthmore students

using the shuttle.
Much like a hotly anticipated concert, the headliner was preceded by
nine opening acts

singer Sam Cooke. "It's been a long
time coming. It's been a long time
coming, but a change is gonna

as the crowd rose to its feet.
After Hoeffel, a slew of soul, hiphop and rock hits blared from
portable loudspeakers. As the crowd
danced to "Love Train," "Eye of the
Tiger" and "Hey Ya," one almost
expected the spotlights to turn into
strobe lights.
Finally the man of the hour
emerged from a jet black SUV with
heavily tinted windows. Edwards
sauntered through the crowd, shaking hands with

an elderly segment
that was seated near to the front of
the stage.
Edwards took his place at the circular platform in front of a makeshift
lectern and began to attack a speech
Bush had made earlier in the day in
New Jersey about terrorism. Bush's
critique of Sen. John Kerry, the
Democratic presidential candidate,
had been scathing. "While America
does the hard work of fighting terror
and spreading freedom, he has chosen the easy path of protest and
defeatism," Bush said in the speech,
as quoted in The Washington Post.

District
Representatives, and Joe Hoeffel, the
Democratic candidate for the U.S.

aggressiveness. "The first casualty of
a desperate campaign is the truth,"

Edwards said. "If you want to know

"They had people from all over
the place and local candidates, and I
thought that was good," Chris Segal
'O5 said. "I thought that it was really
great as a regional event, and I
thought it was great that a Tri-Co
school was hosting it."
Each speaker ran through a set of
crowd-pleasing, Bush-bashing rhetoric and then quickly passed the mic
to the next performer. Iraq, national
security and health care were all
favorite topics of discussion, but anything criticizing President George W.
Bush received the most thunderous
applause.

and national security, including
advocating stiffer sanctions on Iran,
Edwards tried to focus on the
planned Kerry/Edwards message of
the day: health care.
His attack on Bush's health care
plan was a crowd-pleaser. "You can't
fix a mess unless you know there is a
mess," he said.
Edwards effortlessly spouted statistics on rising health care costs and
millions of Americans without

health care.
As the crowd

cheered

with

delight, Edwards offered the chance

for a little audience interaction.
Even though the theme of the event
was health care, Edwards said he
would field questions on any topic.
But all the questions asked gave him

an opening to steer the discussion
back to health care, and he laid out
the Democratic plan in relatively

simple terms.
"We want to make the same
health care plan that's available to
every U.S. senator available to everyone," he said. The proposal includes
giving many more children health
care, lowering the cost of prescrip-

tion drugs

and little else did not sit well with
some rally attendees. "I thought that
it would have been nice if he took a
question from a college student since
he was at a college," Katie Davenport
'O5 said. "He seemed a little low energy, but he's probably tired, so that's
not a criticism."
Others took issue with some of
the nitty-gritty of his proposals. "I'm
not sure how his foreign drug importation plan jives with [his goal of]
keeping jobs at home," Andrew
Szafran 'O2 argued. If drug prices go
down, the companies might be forced
"

to overseas."

Edwards' exit took at least 20
minutes as star-struck fans reached
to touch his hand for a few brief seconds.
After enough babies were kissed
and enough pictures taken, he strode
back to his car, entourage in tow.
If appearances are what matter

said.

October 1% 2004

Redgrave said "nothing substantial" had taken place in

the investigation, and that it was up to the phone company
"so far as how much they are willing to do." A reserved-students e-mail sent out by the Department ofPublic Safety on
Oct. 8 said the college could "attempt to influence" the decision by the phone company on the course of the investigation, but that ultimately it was not in their control.
The morning of Oct. 8 was also the last time such a call
was reported to Public Safety. Joanna Taylor 'O5, one of the
first recipients, said she was called a second time, around
3:00 a.m. that morning. Rebecca Galaski 'O5 had also

received a call the evening before.
Lissie Jacquette 'O7 and Tara Miller 'O7, both earlier
recipients, said they had not spoken with or heard from
Public Safety about the incidents in several weeks.
"The reserved-students e-mail sent out was encouraging
to see [that] Public Safety had acknowledged the calls,"
Jacquette said in an e-mail, "but still frustrating that it didn't seem like they were actually doing anything."
Phone companies "have to prioritize the requests they
get" for investigating harassing calls, Redgrave said.
"Nobody is minimizing the significance of these calls, but
compared to death threats, these are low on the list."
While it has now been more than a week since the last
reported incident, the caller may have been becoming more

persistent. Whereas in earlier instances the caller rarely
phoned the same person more than once, events in the
week before break seemed to indicate a change.
Cordon received a call fitting the pattern at 5:45 a.m. She
did not respond to "some guy ... professing his love to me,"
but simply hung up. "He called back again immediately
and I did not pick up," she said. "He proceeded to call the
next night at 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. twice." After the fifth
call, Cordon reported the incidents to Public Safety.
The Public Safety notice sent out over e-mail was
prompted by the increasing number of phone calls,
Redgrave said. "The threshold [for the notice] would have

been lower if it had been more serious."
The notice also "clarified," in his words, a new process
by which to handle such calls. Previously it was "a bit more

cumbersome" in that the student had to request ITS to look
into the phone calls themselves. "We took out that step,"
Redgrave said, and the notice identified Public Safety as
the "single point of contact" for such incidents. Because the
communication is between Public Safety and ITS, "incidents are processed often on the same day, whereas before
it might take a few days for a student to go to ITS."
Conlon said Public Safety had handled her report themselves and had not referred her to ITS. "I was told that after
a certain number of complaints, the problem would be elevated from 'annoying' status to 'harassing' and thus it
would be a much more serious offense," she said. But after
the Public Safety notice, she became confused as to why the
college "cannot or will not track any of the phone calls."
As reported in the original article ("Mystery caller targets female students," Sep. 23, pg. 4), the *57 key combination avaUable to many telephone customers, which "earmarks" a suspicious call and notifies the phone company, is
unavailable with the college's current equipment. Mark
Dumic, ITS manager of networking and systems, said in
September a new system was at least a year and a half
away.

their funding.
The committee meets on Monday nights in
Kohlberg to discuss event ideas proposed by various campus groups.
"The way people get funding for events is they
come in and they bring an itemized proposal with
what they anticipate needing funding for, the name
of the event, the location of the event, all the details
surrounding the event," SAC Co-Director Charlie
Sussman 'O5 said.
"They give a spiel to the committee, we ask any
questions [we have], then once everyone has proposed we meet, just the committee, and we go
through in chronological order which events have
come in, and we look at how much we have in the
weekly budget, the time line of when the event is,
how far in advance the group came in, how well
drawn out the proposal is. People who come in really prepared are likely to get more funding because
that shows they really want this event to happen,
and its something that's not going to be a flop on
campus," Sussman said.
SAC is comprised of 11 students: eight appointed
by the Student Council, one elected by the student
body and two co-directors hired by the college
administration.
SAC's two co-directors are hired by a committee
including the Student Employment Office directors,
the Student Council Appointments Chair, a member of the Student Budget Committee, Assistant
Director of Financial Aid Kristen Moore and
Student Activities Coordinator Jenny Yim. Yim is
then responsible for overseeing the co-directors
after the hiring decision has been made.
"We all look at their experience, their ideas,
what their plans are, how to improve the social
scene in their interview. We look at what they can
contribute to SAC," Yim said.

Council Co-President Jyotic Gupta 'O5 said.
The committee funds a wide range of events.
"We try to find things that will appeal to broad
audiences. We try to make sure that we cover lots of
different groups. For example, we don't just fund the
Friday and Saturday night parties, we have funded
the ML football-viewing study break on Sunday
afternoon." SAC member Emily Nolte 'O7 said.
"We want to find events that are interesting, and
will add to the social life on campus, and that will
appeal to a lot of people," Myra Vallianos 'O5, the

Student Council representative to SAC, said.
Sometimes, however, disputes arise when
groups feel they have been unfairly denied funding
or when students find certain activities offensive.
"I think the real question is whether the social
life, the experience on campus, meets the needs of

students. Not every party is going to appeal to
every student, but if there's enough going on, then
something will appeal to everyone," Dean of the
College Bob Gross '62 said.
When problems do arise, organizations have the
right to appeal SAC's decisions.
Once SAC rejects a proposal, the group requesting funding can revise their proposal and resubmit
their request to SAC.
"The appeal goes to SAC first. If SAC decides to
reject that appeal and [the group] still wants funding for their event, they have to go to [the Student
Budget Committee]. If SBC decides the event should
be funded, then the event is funded. If not, and the
group still wants to get funding, then the group can
appeal to Student Council. Student Council will
then have the final decision," Gupta said.
Swarthmore's appeals process, unlike those of
most colleges and universities, does not directly
involve members of the college's administration.
Yim and Myrt Westphal, the Dean of Student Life,
do receive the minutes from each SAC meeting, but
their role is advisory.
"They [receive the minutes] just so they haye a
record of what's going on. If you ask anyone in the
Dean's office ... they're not here to make decisions
or censor any different parties or promote any one
event as opposed to any other event," Sussman said.
"I think some colleges have a more staff-centered
student activities operation, some have a more
robust student center with lots ofactivities going on
and a night staff and so on. We don't," Gross said.
"I think part of it is a strong focus on student
autonomy and student responsibility and a feeling,
like if we grown-ups tried to put stuff on, you
wouldn't be interested in it anyway," he said.
A SAC member attends each party and fills out
an evaluation form, recording how many people
went to the party and whether or not funds were
spent on the items for which they were approved.
"Next time that group comes in and proposes for an
event, we look back on [the evaluation form] to see
how well their previous event went. If something
totally bombed, we're not likely to give them more
money," SAC member Emily Nolte 'O7 said.
According to Nolte, SAC does not fund alcohol,
though parties that receive funding can have alcohol if the organizing group provides it.
"Based on the meetings I've attended, SAC has
always made very thoughtful decisions and has
always asked good questions to people who propose
events," Yim said.
SAC allocates approximately $750 a week to
finance parties and study breaks, plus additional
funds for certain events such as the formals put on
by the college, Student Groups Advisor Saeed Ola
'O7 said. The funds are appropriated by SBC, which
has a budget this year of approximately $400,000,
according to Gross.
Along with tuition, room and board, every year
students pay an 'activities fee' which goes towards
SBC's budget. This year, the fee was $312 for students paying full tuition, Gross said.

Co-op moves to bigger, better location
an improvement from the old, "more
haphazard" co-op.

BY RICHARD MUI
rmuil@swarthmore.edu
Marking the first expansion since

its

establishment in 1937, the
Swarthmore Co-op moved one door

down the block to a new, larger location last week.
Adjacent to its old location on
Dartmouth Avenue, the new co-op
has now doubled in floor space and
offers a much wider variety of goods
than ever before.
Manager
General
Jack
Cavanaugh said the expansion was
"the biggest thing to hit town in 50
years," and said many improvements have been in the interests of

incorporating
the
needs
of
Swarthmore visitors, residents and

students.
The co-op now carries a larger
spectrum of produce, frozen foods,
baked goods, meats, cheeses, seafood
and prepared foods, including rotisserie chicken and sushi, which are

meant to cater especially to college
students, Cavanaugh said.
The store also supplies products
that fill a demand from the community for natural, foreign, gourmet
and
specialty
foods. Though
revamped, the co-op has maintained
its product policy that dictates "a
strong preference for the freshest
Christina Temes Phoenix Staff

The new co-op, above, has double the retail space of the
old store and features a wider range of products.

'organic' and 'natural' and 'fair-traded' products available," he said.
Mary Seymour 'O6 noticed things

in the new co-op were easier to find,

Other shoppers seemed pleased as
well. "It's wonderful...lt's very imaginatively done
it's a great asset,"
Swarthmore resident Joan Brown
said.
...

In maintaining "a commitment to
community," the co-op continues to

support local suppliers, producers
and small businesses by stocking
their products.
The new location also has a cus-

tomer service desk at which customers can submit new product
ideas, which Cavanaugh hopes will
facilitate dialogue between the co-op
and the community, particularly
with Swarthmore students.
The co-op will also now offer better student discounts this year
because of the college's financial support to the expansion project. The
college contributed $25,000 toward
co-op membership and donated
another $25,000 toward the store's
expansion, according to Cavanaugh.
"Because of financial support
from the college, students are treated
as members, and benefit from a 10percent to 15-percent member discount with student ID," Cavanaugh

said.

Cavanaugh hopes to "start a much
better dialogue with students," and
noted that few students have taken

advantage of the part-time employment opportunities available at the
co-op.

The relocation of the co-op marks

the first of several planned improvements set forth by the Town Center

Revitalization

Strategy,

a coopera-

plan by the Swarthmore
Borough Council, Ville landowners
and residents to improve traffic flow
and business in the Ville, according
to Swarthmore Mayor Elric "Eck"
tive

Gerner.
"The absolute percentage of community participation in Swarthmore
is greater than other, much larger
communities," Gerner said.
The co-op was targeted as a part
of the plan due to its importance to
the community. "A huge percentage
of the people identified the co-op as
the store they had shopped at and the
most significant store in the borough," Gerner said.
As a part of the Town Center
Revitalization Strategy, the old co-op
will be demolished, and a new road,
an extension of Lafayette Court, will
be put in its place, linking Myers and
Dartmouth Avenues. Other planned
improvements include new curbing,
new lighting and a reorganization of
parking. Construction will start in
January and will be completed by
the spring.
Gerner was pleased with the college's support of the co-op expansion
and the borough's plans for revitalization. "For the college to step forward in the way they did shows that
the college is very serious about the
whole process," he said.

Lull said his classes are different than those at Swarthmore.
"My classes are all right. It's

"This might sound sort of

Lull said he has remained in

Coming Out Week offers support, visibility
BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu
A door situated in front of Clothier
adorned with a sign proudly proclaiming,
"This way out!" accompanied by scores of
chalkings around campus, marked the
beginning of Swarthmore's annual Coming
Out Week, a week of events dedicated to support and increase the visibility of the queer
community.

The week, which is

organized primarily

by the Swarthmore Queer Union along with
the Queer-Straight Alliance; COLORS, a
group for queer and questioning students of
color; and other Intercultural Center
groups, is Swarthmore's adaptation of
National Coming Out Day, which was held
Oct. 8 this year.

"[The speakers] address
coming out on levels that
encompass far more than
just sexuality."
Sarah Langer 'O7
SQU board member
The mission of Coming Out Week states
that it is "an annual celebration that seeks
to affirm our struggles in a hetero- and gen-

der-normative society, and to celebrate our

contributions as queer artists, thinkers, cultural workers, and other leaders through
the increased visibility of queer people and
a
discussion
of queer
issues
at

Swarthmore," according to SQU board
member Sarah Langer 'O7.
The week kicked off on Tuesday with a
workshop and performance by Vicky and
Jane Jane, two performers from New
Jersey who, through discussion and a performance that combined film clips with
live action, addressed issues about pornography and feminism, and the interaction

between the two.

According to Nick Forrest 'OB, who
attended the event, the performance alternated between Vicky performing live and
clips of JaneJane's "video diary." The video
was used between different acts, and
JaneJane's pieces acted as a commentary
on class and women's role in society,
Forrest said.
"Everyone I talked to was very excited
and impressed by the performance because
of its originality and the way the film and
live acting came together so well," Langer

said.

"I really liked it... I've never really seen

anything like that," Forrest said.
Activities on Wednesday included a
closed dessert for queer students, faculty,

staff and administration, a Sharpies
takeover and an open SQU meeting that
included a "gender-free square dance."
Tomorrow, Letta Neely, an award-winning spoken word poet and the program
director for the Boston GLASS Community
Center for queer youth and young adults,
will perform her poetry and discuss her
work in the Scheuer Room at 7 p.m. At 10
p.m., the annual Coming Out Week party will
be held in Paces. This year's theme is "Gay
Olympics," and prizes will be given out.
Saturday's event is a Tri-Co movie viewing in the IC, and on Sunday, a picnic willbe
held on Parrish Beach from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Langer said this year's events differ
somewhat from those of previous years.
"I personally think that the speakers are
a little more radical this year. They address
coming out on levels that encompass far
more than just sexuality by including issues

of gender, class and race in their lectures
and performances," she said.
Coming Out Week is funded by the IC,
the film and media studies and sociology
and anthropology departments, the Forum
for Free Speech, the President's Office, the

Social Affairs Committee and SQU through
the budget that is annually allocated to
them from the Student Budget Committee
for the event.

New Dorm name submissions highlight college's mission
Popular suggestions include former Sharpies employee Andre Singleton, suffragist Alice Paul and past presidents
BY AARON WASSERMAN

Following the request of its anonymous

names its build-

The council created an e-mail account
especially for the naming, newdormname

suggestions for name candidates via e-mail
submissions. Student Council had received
nearly 50 proposals at the time of publica-

tion.
The serious suggestions indicate that
students want to change the college's naming tradition.
Initial proposals do not include the
prominent donors who already are the
namesakes of campus buildings. Instead,
they highlight the accomplishments of
women and people of color associated with
Swarthmore, as well as past college presidents who have significantly shaped the
institution's academic dynamics.

class of 1905, a suffragist and pivotal figure in the passing of the 19th amendment;

Joseph Swain, college president from 1902
to 1921, whose work markedly increased

Swarthmore's endowment and

faculty

size; and Frank Aydelotte, college president from 1921 to 1940, who created

impact on the college community and the
strength of the proposal's argument.

President Al Bloom and the anonymous donor have an influence on the final
decision, but will not intrude on the selection process. Gisselquist said the decision
would be announced by next spring's
housing lottery, based on a recommendation by Dean of the College Bob Gross '62.
"It's good that people are thinking about
what the college stands for," Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l said about the
process. Though evasive about revealing a
personal or administrative favorite, "Alice
Paul represents a set of values that reflects
the college's founding," Eldridge said.
Mark Hanis 'O5, one of the students
who nominated Paul, said her work had a

"massive" effect on women's enfranchisement, an achievement that Hanis thinks is
especially pertinent this year with the
U.S. presidential election and highlywatched elections in Afghanistan and

Student Council Co-President Andrew
Gisselquist 'O5 said that the council's tentative deadline for accepting submissions
is at the end of this semester.
Next semester, the council will select
the strongest candidates based on the
number of nominations for each name,
their connection to Swarthmore, their

Venezuela.
Hanis, who nominated several other
candidates, said that when making his
selections he wanted to identify people
who have had great impacts in large communities, but who had not been widely
recognized on campus.
Sasha Grenier 'OB, another Paul sup-

October 21, 2004

porter, also said that her choice was a conscious decision to represent a new demographic in the college's naming practices.
"Out of all campuses, we're one that
should reflect our diversity through the
names of our buildings," Grenier said.
Anand Vaidya 'O5 used a similar
approach to arrive at a more unorthodox
nomination: James Kalafus, a student who
has been on leave for two years. Although
Kalafus has received several facetious
nominations, Vaidya's proposal is serious.
"I think it's a cool opportunity: Instead
of going on tradition, we'll honor someone
who doesn't represent traditional notions
of success, but was a cool, decent guy,"
who contributed to our community in a
different way, he said.
"It's the name everyone's started to use
organically," he added.
Student Council's co-presidents believe
the honor should not be awarded to someone whose name already marks a campus
building. According to Gisselquist, it
"adds some weight to the submissions" if
students nominate a non-represented
demographic, and Co-President Jyoti
Gupta 'O5 agreed.
"I would like to see someone who is not
like the other people for whom the other
dorms are named," Gupta said.

Saving Mother Earth,
one thermos at a time
There I was, poised to take part
in a tactical strike of epic magnitude. For years I'd tolerated the
public's wasteful, profligate consumption, but now I was their
friend no longer. Those glass-trashing, dryer-using, energy-guzzling
heretics were going down. An elite
band of highly-trained operatives
had been assembled for this purpose, and today I was among them.
Their name: Earthlust. Their mission: to reduce energy use on campus. Their latest blitzkrieg undertaking: Operation Storm the
ALEX LEADER-SMITH
Dorms. This was truly embedded
The Prodigal Prodigy
journalism at its finest.
Unfortunately, academic circumstances made a timely arrival
to the pre-operation debriefing
impossible, though I dared not make excuses to Earthlust commanders
Kristy Simmons 'O7 and E.B. Fouts 'O7. Thankfully, they pardoned my
delinquency, and for good reason
judging by the ragtag group around
me, these ladies needed aU the help they could get! The dozen or so troops
had no uniforms, no camouflage, not even any all-natural non-chemicallybased war paint! Crazy, I thought; how better to appreciate the Earth than
to blend into it?
For the moment, though, I kept my concerns to myself. Jim Kreft 'O6
was designated my comrade-in-arms, and I quietly took a seat next to him
as our leaders divvied up supplies. There were informational handouts to
circulate, Earthlust thermoses to sell, and checklists for recording environmental transgressions in sordid detail. Lastly, there were Teddy
Grahams to give to those kind enough to take our survey. Jim and I immediately called dibs on the blue chocolate chip box. In war, it always helps
to be prepared, and chocolate chip Teddy Grahams are the ultimate provision.
As Jim and I headed off to storm Willets, he filled me in on the operation's details. Our job was to knock on the doors of all WiUets freshmen,
ask them a series of questions about their energy use, then distribute
information and crunchy, chocolaty bears as needed. Thermoses would be
offered to particularly interested parties. Interestingly, I noted no coercion, intimidation or forcible deployment of solar-powered recycling bins
anywhere on our agenda. Our plan of action seemed quite peaceful.
Perhaps I'd misjudged this group.
We began on First South. Trusting in his experience, I let Jim do the
questioning, while I played the role of thermos-laden packhorse. As expected, he did an excellent job uncovering our first freshman's recycling
habits. When it came time to push the thermos, though, I saw him start to
falter. I leaped in at once. "It's a great mug!" I proclaimed. "I have one
myself, and I use it all the time! It's perfect for coffee." She bought the story
hook, line and sinker. Awesome. Five George Washingtons for old Mother
Earth and one less thermos for me to carry. Truly a win-win all around.
Continuing through the halls, we completed many surveys, though
sales were slow. Meanwhile, Jim was becoming disillusioned. Every unanswered knock was met with a "Score!" or "Excellent!" from my senior partner, as he strove to finish the door-to-door as quickly as possible. It was
almost as if conserving Jim's energy was Earthlust's newest priority!
Eventually we switched roles, which went well, except for a couple
instances like the following.
Me: Do you have fluorescent or incandescent lights?
Freshman: What's the difference?
Me: Fluorescent are the ones that are ... you know ... fluorescent...
and incandescent are the other ones.
Freshman: Um
Jim: Incandescent lights are hot when you touch them.
Freshman: (who does not habitually grope burning light bulbs) Um
Jim: (peering in) They're incandescent.
Me: Right. Of course. Obviously.
Despite such obstacles, we finished our task on time and gathered useful information to boot. Returning to headquarters, we swapped war stories with other teams, and I was amazed and pleasantly surprised by the
fun, relaxed attitude the Earthlusters took to their cause. I'd feared
Earthlust would be a group of in-your-face environmentalists, a fearsome
cross between Captain Planet and Mr. T In reality, they wanted only to be
respectful surveyors, well-meaning advisors, friendly salespeople, and
generous donors of food. All in aU, I'm not sure I could join Earthlust
I
do have that academic commitment
but I'd be happy to dormstorm with
them anytime. And next time I'll know to leave the battle gear at home.

Erotic Swat magazine
revived with big bang
BY ALYSSA WORK
aworkl@swarthmore.edu

"What could be more universal than sex?"

Nothing, thought three Swarthmore students,
and so they embraced that common thread and set
out to form a new erotica magazine,! mag.
"Bang mag," as the magazine's Prince-like title
is pronounced, fills the void left several years ago
when Unmentionables, the last erotica publication
on campus, folded. Nostalgia for an erotic magazine resurfaced last year when The New York
Times ran an article about H-Bomb, Harvard's
magazine, and
erotica
mistakenly cited
Unmentionables as an existing example of sexy
campus literature.
Amanda Winters 'OB said she remembered reading about Swarthmore's erotica magazine last
year. "I think it's awesome it's coming back," she
said.

"Expect copies to pop up like
an ill-timed erection."
!

magazine founder

"The article said we had [an erotica publication]," one of !'s founders said, "which made us all
wish it was true."
The students behind !, who, along with the first
issue's contributors, prefer to remain anonymous,
said they realized last year that most campus publications have "a pretty narrow readership."
"We thought it would be nice to have a publication accessible to everyone," they said. "Especially
at Swarthmore, there's a lot of untapped sexual
tension that is usually released in the form of violent masturbation between one's soc-anth paper
and physics problem set. We provide a more creative and public outlet for this energy."
Prose, poetry, photography and art are all fair
game for the magazine, said its founders, who are
"embracing the 'DIY' ethos of the early 90s" and
publishing the first issue on their own before asking for funding from the Student Budget
Committee "if it's well-received." If no funding
appears, they said, "perhaps an erotic cake sale is

October 2% 2004

in order."
But it appears the magazine will be wellreceived so far, or at least free of the administrative resistance that H-Bomb and several other erotic college and university publications have faced
in the last few years. The founders admitted that
they "actually haven't talked to anyone in the
administration" but pointed out that "as we see it,
silence is complicity."
Students, for the most part, seem supportive of
the magazine's first issue.
"I think it's a sign of a good liberal arts institution," lan Malinowski 'OB said, "but I don't find it
that exciting myself."
Kristie LaSalle 'O5 said it was "good to have all
points of view," adding that "there are so many different forms of expression, ways of expressing
yourself
it makes campus reaUy interesting."
But she questioned distribution of the magazine: "It's not something you want to force on people," she said.
Submissions for the first issue are open until
Nov. 12; contributors can send writing and art to
BANGmag@hotmail.com or to "!" through campus
mail. Anonymity is guaranteed, !'s founders said.
"We don't want to set up specific rules until we
see what we get," they said. "Anything goes" for
now in regards to submissions of art and writing,
although as with any publication, the publishers
will use their discretion as editors to choose
what's in and what's out.
As a new publication,! has few precedents and
fewer rules. As for what makes a good erotica submission: "In the words of Louis Armstrong, 'lf
you've gotta ask, you ain't never gonna get to
know,'" one founder said. "If you think your piece
of writing or art would be a good edition to ! it
probably would be
and since we guarantee
anonymity it's not going to hurt to try."
All art and photography will be printed in black
and white for the first issue, said the founders,
"although we're confident we can make it look
awesome." They remain mysterious about the distribution policies of the magazine, revealing only
that students should "expect copies to pop up like
an iU-timed erection: When you least expect it but
you're most ready."
For now, the brains behind ! are hopeful about
the magazine's future. "If Swarthmore's not ready
now," they said, "we might as well all drop out."

Dylan writes life his way One time
BY BEN BRADLOW

bbradlol@swarthmore.edu
Bob Dylan has always
been just out of the mainstream and out of reach to
his fans. And so it is with
curiosity and anticipation
that most Dylan followers
will approach his recently
published memoir, called
"Chronicles, Volume One."
Not surprisingly, it is not
a conventional attempt at
accessibility. Without concern for chronology or customary structure, Dylan
rambles charmingly about
his life, from his arrival in
New York City in the early
60s and to his escape from the spotlight a decade later, to
the near-end of his career in the 80s.
The book does not discuss what most critics see as the
his mid-60s
most seminal artistic moments in his life
trilogy of electric albums ("Bringing It All Back Home,"
"Highway 61 Revisited," "Blonde on Blonde") and "Blood
on the Tracks" from 1975. It is not so much an attempt to
set the factual record straight
a record that has been
warped and mythologized by scores of critics
as an
attempt to clarify our general view of Dylan the person.
Dylan gives us a window into his persona at each of the
moments he chooses to discuss. Such moments are often
humorous or heartbreaking, if slightly self-indulgent.
When asked to give his biography to Billy James, head of
publicity at Columbia Records in 1962, Dylan comes across
as a Holden Caulfield phony-sniffing character. "Billy
dressed Ivy League like he could have come out of Yale
medium height, crisp black hair. He looked like he'd never
been stoned a day in his life, never in any kind of trouble."
In discussing the recording of "Oh Mercy" in 1989, a
comeback of sorts for Dylan, he reveals his frustration
with his and producer Daniel Lanois' expectations.
"[Lanois] was looking for songs that defined me as a person, but what I do in the studio doesn't define me as a per-

son. There's just too much small print in thousands of
pages for anything like that to happen."
It's with this understanding that Dylan approaches
"Chronicles." He knows he cannot sum himself up in the
300-odd pages of the book and presents his life as a sort of
picaresque novel. He often goes off on long tangents to
mention seemingly insignificant adventures that explain
and animate his life: an encounter with a mystical roadside storeowner named Sun Pie, a discussion with Frank
Sinatra Jr. ("How do you think it would make you feel to
find out that the underdog had turned out to be a son of a
bitch?" Sinatra Jr. says about his father), Woody Guthrie
at his bed in a psychiatric ward asking Dylan to bring him
lyrics he'd written that didn't have music (Billy Bragg and
Wilco would record the songs over 30 years later).
Despite, or perhaps because of, his tendency to stray
from his overarching story, he is able to better illustrate
how he thinks in a way that is endearing. Such a strategy
is refreshing in contrast to most celebrity memoirs, which
often follow an unimaginatively strict structure.
Dylan starts off on a minor tangent
an encounter in
music publisher Lou Levy's office that foreshadows his
monumental success: "Lou introduced me to Jack
Dempsey, the great boxer. Jack shook his fist at me. 'You
look too light for a heavyweight kid, you'll have to put on
a few pounds. You're gonna have to dress a little finer, look
a little sharper not that you'll need much in the way of
clothes when you're in the ring don't be afraid of hitting
somebody too hard.' 'He's not a boxer, Jack, he's a songwriter and we'll be publishing his songs.' 'Oh yeah, well I
hope to hear 'em one of these days. Good luck to you, kid.'"
In "Chronicles" Dylan tries to explain how he hears his
own songs. He doesn't need to hit too hard. After years of
having critics write every possible thing about him, he
writes about himself with captivating satisfaction and selfreflection. His decision to not focus on what most consider
the most important points in his life works as a captivating
method of forcing readers to rethink how they view
Dylan's work and life.
For years, listeners have identified with Dylan's lyrics
and music in a relatively one-sided relationship. With
"Chronicles," Dylan guides us through the workings of a
previously hidden mind in a way that is accessible, yet still
uniquely Dylan-esque.

'Africans in Space' mix it up good
BY NASH ADAMSON

tadamsol@swarthmore.edu

Trumpeter Marcus Wyatt's second Sheer Sound release,
"Africans in Space," is a striking deviation from most contemporary jazz. It is catchy without being smooth or
poppy. It is tightly arranged and slickly produced without
sounding a bit weak or commercial. It displays virtuosic
blowers but never tries to simply show off up-tempo licks
or steal double time figures that boppers mastered over 50
years ago. Marcus Wyatt's band has put out one of the
more solid jazz recordings that has been brought to my
attention over the last few years.
But describing the album as solid is much more appropriate than calling it brilliant. This is not a boundarypushing avant-garde statement. Instead, it is a sextet playing beautifully over well-written changes. Wyatt wrote
thathis inspiration for "Africans in Space" came from time
he spent in Amsterdam (I wonder how Amsterdam could
inspire a jazz musician) and his desire to reconcile contemporary European improvisational style with that of his
upbringing in South Africa. With only a few lapses, Wyatt
has succeeded in his project.
The three tracks on the album that feature vocalist
Nonthuthuzelo Puoane are the album's only low points. I
admit that I'm not a huge fan of vocal jazz in general, but
the three tunes that put Puoane up front lack the beautiful
arrangements of the sextet numbers, and the smooth quality of Puoane's voice turns the record into a more typically lame contemporary release.
Of the sidemen, pianist Andile Yenana's playing stands
out and takes a strong supporting role. Yenana's sound is
similar to Keith Jarrett's trio playing, even down to grunting and singing over his improvisations. But Yenana isn't
ripping off anybody's style. Instead, he combines his
American inspirations with his own technique and his

personal experiences as an African. In his own words, the
"young jazz musician should try and keep the legacy alive
... [but] one question that has always bothered me has been
that of translation. How does one as a jazz musician in
South Africa translate jazz into one's own reality?" It
seems that Yenana has answered this question by putting
much of the technical flair of 60s jazz in America over a
core of African rhythms and chords changes.

"How does one as a jazz musician
in South Africa translate jazz into
one's own reality?"
Andile Yenana, jazz pianist
Yenana continues his explorations on his debut album
as a leader, "We Used to Dance." This record is, in almost
all ways, weaker than "Africans in Space." With lighter
playing, a crisper production value and less innovative
compositions, much of the date blends in with the majori-

ty of contemporary American releases. But the album does

have its stronger moments. The second track, "Tembisa
The People," features Yenana's more exploratory improvisations over funky handclaps from the ensemble. On

"Tembisa
The People," Yenana's extended improvisation shows his own style more distinctly. Quiet piano features "No Lights" and "The Finale" are early examples of
what might be to come from Yenana's own compositions.
For now, Yenana seems more fit as a sideman.
To hear samples from each of the albums, tune in to
WSRN's jazz programing. Although it's unclear when the
station will get up and running, Wyatt and Yenana will be
featured on my show on Thursday.

a

sexual charm?
Until this year, I was
more or less a "slut

wannabe." I'd congratulate my friends on random sexual encounters
and encourage others to
take similar plunges.
When it came to my own
life, however, I was a
complete hypocrite. Two
years ago, when I actually attempted to navigate
a "friends with benefits"

scenario, I appeared to
be enjoying
myself.
I
Inwardly, though,
Sex and the Swattie
couldn't handle it. I didn't even possess the selfrespect to cry about it
alone and instead cried about it to said friend. Clearly, I'm
just not cool enough for random hookups.
That said, for a lot of people, a one-night stand can be the
answer, or at least an answer that seems not wholly terrible
the next day. Whether you're between relationships or not
interested in the baggage of monogamy, the appeal of this
type of sexual encounter rests on the thrill of a no-stringsattached encounter and/or the sheer partner-enhancing
power of alcohol.
Earlier this year I found myself single, drunk and pressing my sweaty body against other sweaty bodies in Paces.
When a hookup opportunity arose, I took it and had a fun
night. But I quickly realized I was completely unfamiliar
with the rules of this kind of "dating." I had no idea if I
should stay over, if I was supposed to ask him questions
about himself, or if he wanted to do it again. We did end up
sharing some personal information about ourselves, and
because it was such a nice moment and I was so unfamiliar
with this type of interaction, I made the fatal mistake of asking the question you should never, ever ask in this type of
situation. I searched his gaze and asked, "You do like me,
though, don't you?"
I don't remember the specifics of his stammered reply
(which was, I must say, kind), but what I do recall is how
desperately all I wanted him or anyone in that situation to
answer, unflinchingly, was yes, yes, yes
even if out of a
desire to get in my pants again. So as I stumbled back to
Palmer (sans panties, I would later discover), I accepted my
utter romantic nerdiness. Although I've accepted my lame
monogamist ways, my brief foray into this world has taught
me a few lessons that may help those of you who have taken
or who will at some point take the Walk of Shame.
Remember, we go to a small, and therefore incestuous,
school. When you're pondering a hookup, it's a good idea to
rate how high your honey rates on your personal Incest
Scale (1 being someone you'll never see again, 10 being your
roommate or your roommate's mom). If the person lives on
campus, chances are you'll soon find yourself reaching for
the same bagel in Sharpies. Are you laid-back enough to
chuckle and smile at the guy or girl whom you were groping
the other night? If not, make sure you choose from the low
end of the incest scale, since the higher you go the more
drama ensues. No matter whom you end up fondling, make
sure you explicitly agree to the terms of your hookup from
the outset. This limits the chance that you will be stalked by
someone whose eye patch suddenly bothers you a lot more

in the daylight.

In terms of safety, remember that random hookups are,
by nature, risky. Try to carry barrier protection with you
"just in case," since you can't always rely on the medicine
cabinets to be stocked. (My safer-sex paraphernalia once fell
out of my bag in a waiting room, but I assured the twitching
woman sitting next to me that I had left my whip at home.)
Though even these methods won't protect you against herpes or HPV, they will protect against infections transmitted
through fluids, such as those exchanged during oral sex.
The most important thing I learned from my experience,
though, is how right our grandmas were when they told us
though I personally prefer "hot"
to wear nice
underwear. You really never know where you might leave them,
and how embarrassing it may be to retrieve them.

Finding rockin' Moroccan food in Philly
BY SUSANNAH GUND

sgundl@swarthmore.edu

Got a hot date you want to impress? Celebrating a
birthday with friends? Like hookahs? I cannot recommend anything better than a Morrocan restaurant. I've
visited three of Philly's Moroccan restaurants
(Casablanca, Fez and Marrakesh) over the past few weeks,
so I can tell you where to find the dining experience that
meets your needs.
Most Moroccan restaurants have a similar setup. You sit
on couches or floor cushions at low, round tables. After
your hands are washed with rose water and your lap covered with the large towel that will be your napkin, you are

a multi-course feast of delicious platters of food
that you eat with your hands. Normally the first course is a
salad course, perhaps with hummus, definitely with carrots, Middle Eastern salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, oil and
spices) and baba ganouj, the eggplant that even eggplant
brought

haters love. This is normally eaten with either a pita-like
flatbread or French bread. On the next course transliterations vary, but whether you say chicken bastilla, pastilla,
b'stella, or something else, this chicken with almonds in a
cinnamon and powdered sugar pastry is amazing. Next,
often a choice between spicy chicken or
more chicken
chicken withlemon followed by a course ofbeef or lamb,
often beef kebab or lamb with honey and almonds. For the
vegetarians out there, all three restaurants in Philly have
substitutions available, and as you veggie people well know,
Middle Eastern food, with hummus and falafel, is not only
healthy but spicy and exciting as well. Hands are cleaned
again with a towel, and couscous, served with vegetables
and fruits, comes next. Finally a basket of fruits, baklava,
and mint tea rounds out the night. As these are billed as
$2O
seven- or eight-course meals, they will not be cheap
and up per person
and they will last for a good chunk of
your evening. But the food is more than worth it, and if the
entertainment of a two-hour meal alone is not enough for
you, Moroccan restaurants often have belly dancers performing during the course of the meal.
Fez Moroccan is a great restaurant for an evening out
on South Street with friends. While the food is not the best
in Philadelphia, it is still delicious, and the weeknight
seven-course menu is only $2O ($lB for vegetarian), which is
easier on the wallet. Inside the restaurant, with its funky
tent interior, you can boogie with the belly dancer and
smoke a hookah at your table after the meal. Also on weeknights you can order a la carte at Fez, without all the presentation and courses. If you do, the harira, the first course
of lentil soup, is tasty, and the weekend vegetarian menu
has "the best falafel" Ethan Doyle 'OB has ever tasted.
Marrakesh is the essence of the romantic restaurant:
low lighting, incense in the air, Arabic in the music and
inscribed on the walls. Though Marrakesh has fewer courses on its menu, all of the food is delicious the salad course
at the beginning, especially the carrots, was particularly
flavorful, and the baklava is folded like a samosa and sweetened with rosewater for an exciting flavor combination. A
rosewater drink with fruit juices, aptly called "the Rose

Ahh, the lush beauty of fall on
Swarthmore's campus: the blushing trees
in all their autumnal splendor, the scent of
crisp, organic apples hanging ripe from the
boughs of the Sharpies fruit alcove, the
woolen scarves thrown jauntily over collegiate peacoats, the gentle laughter of mintybreathed, pony-tailed students ambling
across the quad, and the chance to rub up
against each other in a large, sweaty multitude dressed mostly like slutty cats.
Woohoo! Halloween 2004!
Admittedly, both Lilli and Annie decided
independently to dress as slutty cats for last
year's ML party
although Annie maintains she was a "cat in heat" ("I had a thermometer!"). Thus, we cannot claim to be a
font of originality when it comes to
Halloween costumes. Nor would it be fruitful to provide such ideas; once they are

their trivial plebian concerns. Located in
the bowels of LPAC in the corridor next to
the AV office, the Costume Shop opens its
doors selectively: Mondays from 10:30 a.m.
to 12:30 p.m. and Fridays from 1:30 to 3:30
p.m. A poster near the door guides visitors
to the proper usage of their borrowed finery, sporting scrawled kudos to particularly chic Swarthmore folk and pictures of

fashion victims and victors alike. Although
the shop primarily furnishes the college's
myriad student productions and dance performances, its overflowing racks are also

available to anyone who wants a flamenco
skirt, a tutu, or a military jacket for the

weekend (role playing, anyone?).
But whoa there, Headmistress Whiplash.
There are stipulations to borrowing items
from the Costume Shop's inventory.
Clothing that is needed for an upcoming
performance cannot be removed, and you
can't borrow more than you can carry.

have to knock to get in, but once inside you are guaranteed
a wonderful evening with that special someone or a fabulous time for a celebration in the more spacious eating
areas upstairs. Note that wine is ordered by the bottle, and
tip is included on the check.
Unfortunately, Casablanca is far away. However, if you
can make the trip, dining at Casablanca is definitely worth
it. The food is amazing, with tender and succulent meats
and well-balanced spices, and each course offers more
options than at the other restaurants. For the chicken
course you can order spicy hot chicken, or chicken with
lemon and olives, with apricots, with walnuts, or with
dates. Don't be afraid to try the tender rabbit cooked in
tomato and garlic sauce with dates; the pita-like flatbread
makes the hot meal easier to attack with your fingers. The
more spacious floor layout leaves the restaurant a little less
funky and intimate than Fez and Marrakesh
great for a
trip out with the family or an evening focused on wonderful

food.

From the handwashing at the beginning of the night to
the mint tea poured, without spilling a drop, from at least
four feet in the air, dinner at a Moroccan restaurant is a
transporting experience. So don't hesitate to make a trip to
Morocco, or, if you can't afford it, to Casablanca, Fez, and
Marrakesh, all located nearby.

us. The incredible multicolored waterfall of
a chorus girl skirt was can-canned in. The
pimped-out fake fur coat was stroked, and
the new trend towards real fur regretted
earnestly. The vintage hats were paraded,
and the nostalgia dripped as we yearned for
a time when people could wear said hats
without getting strange looks from several
debate teams (as we did when, in an intoxicated dress-up haze, we wore yellow feathered creations out of LPAC). We staggered
out of the costume shop with our armfuls of
vintage swag, leaving only a foot-long list of
rented items on the sign-out poster.
If you want that electric-pink Barbie

Capogiro makes amazing(ly expensive) gelato
BY EMILY GASSER

egasserl@swarthmore.edu

At first I was skeptical. I was in Philly with friends, and
after a cheap, satisfying Chinatown dinner, Matt Dering 'O7
offered to take us for dessert to Capogiro, a gelato place he
described as "five bucks for a small, but worth every cent."
I'd gotten used to Ben & Jerry's three-dollar cones, but how
could anyone charge five, and for a small? This gelato
might be good, but there's no way it could be worth that, I

thought.
Well, Matt was right. At first bite, moans of pleasure
came from around the table. The gelato was soft, smooth
and amazingly creamy
easily the best I've had outside of
Europe. Matt and George Hang 'O7 both went back for seconds
mediums this time. When my family came down to
visit last weekend, I immediately took them there (My parents are paying? I'm getting a large!), and my mother insisted that we come back the next day. It's just that good.
Capogiro, whose name means "vertigo" in Italian,
"exudes posh," Matt said, in an obvious attempt to attract a
trendy, 30-something clientele. Accordingly, the store has a
very chic, stylish ambiance. The main room is done all in
blues
light-blue walls, blue blown-glass lamps, blue plastic chairs

and the bathroom is all oranges. The servers

are mostly attractive young guys ("He just hit on me!" Matt
exclaimed with delight). Sometimes, though, it feels like
Capogiro is trying a bit too hard to be hip and European.
For example, most of the flavor names are in Italian; it's
cioccolato, not chocolate.
But whatever issues of pretense the place may have are
more than compensated for by the gelato. Gelato differs
from American ice cream in its fat content (according to
the FDA, ice cream must contain at least 10 percent butterfat; gelato's percentage is in the single digits), is softer, and
holds much less air. Capogiro's flavors change daily, so
beyond the standby chocolate and mint I also encountered
peach, plum, goat's milk with rosemary, sweet potatocaramel-pecan, quince, Irish creme, walnut, pumpkin, and
gooseberry, to name a few. And yes, I tried all of the above.
One of the great things about Capogiro is that they'll let

you taste as many flavors as you'd like before you order,
and even then you don't have to choose just one
a small
includes up to two flavors, a medium three, and a large
four. Some flavors, including apple, pomegranate and kiwi,
show up as sorbetto rather than gelato, but their textures
were so creamy and lacking in the iciness found in typical
American sorbet that I found it hard to believe they included no dairy products. (This feat, I later discovered from my
cookbooks at home, is usually accomplished by adding
some extra sugar and a bit of alcohol, usually flavorless
vodka, to the mix, though I can't attest to Capogiro's meth-

ods.)
But while the texture was uniformly heavenly, not all
flavors are created equal. I actually found the plain chocolate to be the most disappointing of all of them; it was too
sweet and not as chocolaty as one would expect. Still, the
bitter chocolate was rich and delicious and especially
excellent when paired with the mint, which tasted like
fresh mint leaves instead of the artificial flavorings I've
come to expect from ice cream. That authenticity of flavor
carried through all the fruit flavors: the apple tasted like
biting into an apple, the pear like a (very sweet) fresh pear.
Capogiro doesn't bury the natural tartness ofits fruits with
an artificial sweetness, and it's easy to tell that they use
real fruit rather than chemical flavorings to get the taste
just right. (Sometimes, though, they don't quite make it.
Their peach tasted more like a banana, the frutti di bosco
was almost entirely lacking in frutti, and though I found it
nicely acidic and refreshing, George, a self-proclaimed citrus snob, thought the grapefruit was "not that great.")
Other non-fruit flavors measured up just as well. You'd
never expect a spicy ice cream to work, but the Mexican
chocolate, flavored with cinnamon, bitter almonds, and
fiery ancho chillies, was fantastic, especially paired with
the excellent walnut. The white chocolate was a bit too
sweet and would have benefited from a more distinct flavor
it tasted more like vanilla than anything else
but the
cappuccino was delicious enough to make even an avowed
coffee-hater like myself go back for more.
Out of all these, though, I'd have to say my favorite was
the cinnamon gelato. The spiciness of the cinnamon bal-

anced well with the sweetness of the gelato, making this flavor truly a standout.
Capogiro also serves some salads, panini, Italian, coffees, and local baked goods, in case the gelato doesn't fill
you up on its own.
So if you're looking to impress visiting relatives or just
treat yourself to some well-deserved dessert, try Capogiro's
amazing gelato and sorbetto. It may be expensive, but it's
goooood.

'Shall We Dance?' Not with this flop
BY ABBY GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu
The first rule of Miss Mitzi's School of
Dance: You do not talk about Miss Mitzi's
School of Dance. The second rule of Miss
Mitzi's School of Dance: You do not talk
about Miss Mitzi's School of Dance.
Why? Beats me. Maybe the writers
thought it would create tension or something. How sorely they were mistaken.
At first glance, John Clark, the protagonist of "Shall We Dance?", seems like prime
meat for the dark underground ruled by
Tyler Durden of 1998's "Fight Club." He's a
corporate nobody working a death-related
job (Clark helps people write wills), numb to
the blandness of existence. Cue some pounding techno music, and we've got a new member of Project Mayhem. But instead of techno, we get the twang of the world's smallest
violin, playing the world's saddest song just
for John. "Shall We Dance?" occupies a
peculiar space in the Hollywoodiverse as a
sort of polar opposite to "Fight Club." It
seems that unhappy white men with morbid
white-collar jobs have two options in the
movies: They can pound people's heads in
abandoned parking garages, or they can
morph into Fred Astaire. Unfortunately for
Richard Gere, the former is much more

interesting.

Courtesy of romanticmovies.com

Co-starring in a movie that offers few surprises and awkwardly forced plot twists,
Lopez and Gere dip to bland lows in
"Shall We Dance." Now playing in theaters.

THE PHOENIX

Luckily, "Shall We Dance?" doesn't actually attempt to interest the audience. Leave
that serious stuff for the Oscar hopefuls.
Rather, the object of "Shall We Dance?" is to
make Gere look as suavely debonair as possible and to make Jennifer Lopez look slightly uncomfortable but simultaneously as gor-

geously unattainable as possible. Here, at
least, the movie thoroughly succeeds. The
plot is more of a mechanism to achieve these
transparent ends rather than an attempt to
make the movie watchable in itself. It's so
straightforward that it deserves only monosyllabic words. Gere plays John. John is
bored. Dance looks like fun. John wants to
dance. John joins Miss Mitzi's School of
Dance. Dance, John, dance.
The dancing itself is passable, at times
(okay, once) even powerful, but not strong
enough to float an entire film, especially not
one approaching the two-hour mark. Where
the script called for strong characters to
bypass the bland plot, writer Audrey Wells
gave us Jennifer Lopez. She plays Paulina,

one of John's instructors who is still broken

up over breaking up with her boyfriend and
dance partner the previous year. Played continuously on the verge of collapse, Paulina is
snivelly and unsympathetic. She's onscreen
only when John is and never develops much
of a separate personality. The same goes for
most of the secondary characters in this
film: You learn as much about them as you
would about real-life ballroom dancers by
watching them on ESPN.
Though "Shall We Dance?" is a romance,
you may be surprised by the lovers. We are
spared a tritely adulterous liaison between
Paulina and John. Instead, the real love
affair is between John, Paulina and dance
itself, for which Wells deserves some credit.
She identifies John and Paulina as kindred
souls through their passion for their art, not
for each other. Gere's lust for ballroom, not
booty, keeps his character likable and allows
the film a margin of deviation into more

October 23, 2004

original territory than is usually cinematically explored with such simple characters.

But there ends the story's worthiness.

Instead of growing organically from the
script, problems arising in "Shall We
Dance?" are imposed upon the characters by
writers desperate to bring emotional tautness into a fairy tale. John doesn't tell his
wife (Susan Sarandon) that he's taking
dance lessons. His secrecy upsets her, and
she creates a superfluous subplot by hiring
a private investigator to spy on her husband. John's motivation for this sort of
secrecy is vague at best, but at least it makes
someone in the film conflicted, even if it's
only a secondary character. In a stunning
oh, how I wish I could finish
plot twist
this sentence and maintain journalistic
the rest of the film moves from
integrity
A to B like Elvis making a beeline for a fried
peanut-butter and
banana
sandwich.
Nothing gets in the way, and no momentary
worry stops Jennifer Lopez from looking
gorgeous or Richard Gere from looking

suave.

A show without tension in a world without problems, "Shall We Dance?" is pure
escapist fare. It exists in a lot of universes,
none of which intersect with reality. There's

the fantasyverse, where every family's kids
look like they belong in a modeling contest
and sons ask their fathers to bars to meet
their new girlfriends. There's the glitzverse,
where amateur dancers perform beautiful
routines under the stress of competition.
With neither the personal force nor the
dynamic story necessary to forge a bond
with reality, "Shall We Dance?" is dancing
on thin ice.

party and the Sager dance, both SAC-funded, directly and
openly advance a social agenda. Groups like SASS,
Enlace and SAO indirectly advance their social agendas
when they gain publicity by holding generic Paces parties. And SAC doesn't tell the Olde Club director to avoid
inviting bands whose songs have a political message.
SAC shouldn't fund events that inflame debate and
conflict on campus more than they promote social bonding, but

it's hard to see a debate viewing as such an event.

It's about politics, but rather than pushing one party's
point of view over another's or even really pushing the
two mainstream parties over alternative opinions, its
main goal was to realistically portray the actual choices
American voters will have this November and give us a
picture of the state of American politics.
While political debates are about dead serious issues,
watching them is a recreational activity for many people.
Realistically, many students in the audience weren't
watching the debate because they were still making their
decision on the election or because they had a pressing
need to educate themselves on the issues. (A television
debate is a poor way to do either, in any case.) Instead

they watched because they were simply interested in the

political game and find humor, intrigue and fascination
in studying the way politicians present themselves to the
media. Anyone who doubts that political events have the
potential to be "strictly entertainment" has never hung

out in certain social circles on our campus.
This leads us to our wider point. The most fundamental difference between the SVRC showing and, say, Sager
was not a possibly controversial political agenda it was
that people consider dancing in Paces to be a "social
event" and watching debates on TV not to be. That's an
understandable bias, but it's an unfair one, especially on
a college campus where our schedules and unconventional interests often mean we do most of our peer bonding
without the benefit of drinks, music or a dance floor.
SAC has understood this in the past, funding events
like a Super Bowl study break, but it could be doing a lot
more to break our rut of Paces party after Paces party.
Students could be doing more to bring ideas for creative
social events before SAC, but SAC could do more on its
end to encourage people to bring more creative social
event proposals in front of them. Being more active about
funding ideas from groups like SVRC would be a good
start.

Transgressions of transcript trust
Dear Editor:
Did you know that all faculty members and some select
staff have unrestrained access to your transcript? Well, they
do. While the college provides the option for students to prevent our parents from seeing our transcripts, it does not
prohibit college faculty and staff from doing so. The college
trusts that individual faculty and staff members will only
access our academic records for educational purposes, a
very ambiguous standard. They can look at our grades anytime and anywhere without anyone else knowing about it.
Just this semester, when selecting 10 out of 24 graduating
seniors who would proceed to the next round for a Watson
Fellowship, a committee of two professors and three administrators accessed students' transcripts without their knowledge. While some committee members think that the viewing of the students' grades was implied in the application, it,
unlike numerous others, never requested either an official
or unofficial transcript. This is especially inappropriate and
unethical for a college and fellowship that pride themselves

sors or extenuating circumstances (such as a tragedy involving friends and family), all of which may distort performance in a course. When explicitly requesting a transcript,
employers, graduate schools and scholarship and fellowship
committees provide the studentwith an opportunity to place
the transcript into context. Even Swarthmore's Office of
Admissions gave us that opportunity when we applied. So
how can the college justify using our transcripts in a decision-making process without our knowledge?
How can we prevent faculty and staff from viewing our
transcripts without our knowledge or permission? First, the
registrar should have sole control over our academic

on valuing more than a student's grades.
Some may say, "So what? After all, in the case of the
Watson, the national committee looks at them anyway." But
our grades are not an exact reflection of our effort in our
courses. Several education studies have shown a "halo
effect," where professors treat students differently with
knowledge of the student's academic record. For example,
professors are more likely to give an extension for a first

records. If anyone requests to view the transcripts, the registrar must be contacted and the request forwarded to the
student. Second, in keeping with its policy of looking beyond
letter grades and into the student as a whole, Swarthmore
should offer every student to submit an addendum to
explain any extenuating circumstances, so that a transcript
that is seen without the student's knowledge is automatically placed into, context. Instituting these reforms or something similar would reinforce to faculty, staff, employers,
graduate schools and fellowship committees that our academicrecords are not only confidential, but are also affected
by more than just the work produced in class.

historically disenfranchised
voters on a Saturday. But our
contributions, however significant, are only a tiny piece of
the all out effort to get minority and low-income populations
t0 the polls. The Philadelphia

county elections staff is dealing
with the highest number of new voter registrations in 21 years.
We know that polls only measure "likely voters" and are confident that on Election Day our hard work will pay off as swarms
of new voters take the polls by storm and Kerry takes the White
House.
But is our optimism naive? In 2000, a similarly intense
ground war was waged. On Election Day in the contested state
of Florida, the black vote was up 65 percent, blacks contributed
16 percent of the total turnout (up from 10 percent), and nine out
of ten voted Democratic. But that didn't keep Dubya in
Crawford, Texas. George W Bush lost the popular election by
500,000 votes in 2000, but won the electoral vote by winning
hotly contested Florida, the state where his brother Jeb is governor, by a tiny 537-vote margin. My worst nightmare this election cycle (aside from my fear that Bush has Osama and will
parade him out on Nov. 1) is that all our hard work to increase
voter participation will go up in flames in another Florida.
The biggest wholesale theft of votes in 2000 occurred inside
voting booths in black counties. In Gadsden County, which has
the highest proportion of black residents of Florida's sixtyseven counties, thousands of votes were simply thrown away.
Gadsden used paper ballots that are read by an optical reader.
Ballots with a single extra mark were considered "spoiled" and
not counted. One in eight ballots in Gadsden was voided by the
state. Identical voting machines used in wealthy, predominantly white counties had Accuvote devices attached to detect
"spoiled" ballots. When the Accuvote devices identified a
"spoiled" ballot, the voter was given a chance to get a new form
and re-vote.
Accuvote devices were not provided in Gadsden County or
in most black counties in the state, so a "spoiled" vote was just
collected like any other vote to be thrown out later, without
informing the voter.
Voter spoilage only occurs after a voter has successfully
made it into the voting booth. Widespread voter intimidation
and suppression efforts have kept many from making it that far.
During the 2003 mayoral election in Philadelphia, men with
clipboards driving a fleet of some 300 sedans with magnetic
signs designed to look like law enforcement insignia were
reported challenging prospective voters at many precincts in
black communities. And in 2002 in Louisiana, flyers were distributed in African American neighborhoods telling voters they
could go to the polls on Tuesday, Dec. 10 three days after a
Senate runoff election actually took place.
Since voter fraud and suppression are widespread and don't
just occur in Florida, perhaps the best thing we can do is know
our rights. You have the right to vote if you bring your Swat ID
to the polls. If you forget your ID or if you know you registered
to vote but your name doesn't appear on the registration rolls,
you have the right to request a provisional ballot. If you damage
or spoil your ballot, you have the right to receive a replacement.
And if you are in line at your polling place when the polls close
at 8 p.m., you have the right to vote! Perhaps the best way to prevent another Florida is to make sure our own votes aren't

stolen.
In an ideal democracy, we wouldn't have to worry about
safeguarding our elections against widespread corruption and
voter fraud. Hell, it's been almost 40 years since the passage of
the 1965 Voting Rights Act, one of the crowning achievements of
the civil rights era. But, then again, if this were a perfect democracy, we wouldn't have to spend our Saturdays convincing people that there really is a reason to vote either. So if we are going
to ensure our efforts to increase voter participation aren't for
naught and that this election will be a fair and honest one,
we've got to do our part to guarantee that every vote counts,
including our own.

Taking time out for democracy
Dear Editor:
If one of my dreams came true and we actually had a
federal holiday for voting, Swarthmore College probably wouldn't observe it. During my 3 and one-quarter
years here, Swarthmore has never cancelled class. I
went to class on Sept. 11, 200 L During the historic blizzard of 2003, I had to walk my 200-pound self from
Roberts to Martin through four feet of snow for my
macroeconomics class. As if to slap all national holidays in the face, we typically start the fall semester on
Labor Day. Still, our institution's historic commitment
to schedules should not overshadow the importance of
individual participation on Nov. 2. Numerous organizations are providing opportunities for students to volunteer on Election Day and the voter registration drive by
SVRC puts more of us in a position to vote locally than
usual. On this Nov. 2, the duties democracy imposes on
us, aside from the privileges, should command us to act.
While ideally the college would seriously scale back
its operations on Election Day, this is, of course, highly
unlikely. Still, things can be done to allow everyone the
flexibility they need to participate effectively. As a student, I would not be troubled by a reduction in college
services to allow staff to vote and volunteer on Election

Day. Reminding

staff that they can take a vacation day
is not enough. Staff should take a vacation day when
they want a vacation, but when they are fulfilling the
responsibilities of citizenship, our enlightened institution should support that endeavor. Additionally, while
all students should be comfortable asking professors for
an excused absence, faculty should also be proactive in
this regard. Professors who are in support of students
taking time on Election Day to volunteer should inform
those students ahead of time. Moreover, professors
interested in volunteering should cancel class and do
just that. Even seminars, albeit more complicated, can

be rescheduled. Extra-curricular activities (including
athletics) should not become excuses for students who
choose not to exercise and fulfill their democratic
rights and obligations.
Finally, even if you don'tbelieve in democratic duty,
or keeping to a schedule just makes you hot, no collection of people should be allowed to bitch as much as we
tend to do about politics and then not proceed to go out

and do something on this Election Day. Warm-bodied
volunteers, not debate and dialogue, will determine the
outcome of Nov. 2.

Staff shouldn't fear retaliation
Human Resources works hard to protect employees' freedom of expression
Dear Editor:
In response to the issues raised by Joe Alberti 'O6 in
his recent letter regarding mistreatment of employees
in the dining hall ("Managers mistreat Sharpies
employees," Sept. 30, pg. 10), the human resources
department would like to reassure readers of The
Phoenix and The Daily Gazette that Swarthmore
employees do not get fired for speaking their minds, nor
do they suffer retaliation for expressing their opinions
or views. Human Resources reviews all employment
actions taken by managers, and we can assert that no
employee at Swarthmore has been or ever will be dismissed for such reasons. Additionally, retaliation is

expressly prohibited by college policy.
It is HR's function to ensure a respectful workplace
for all employees. It is, of course, impossible to avoid
conflicts in the workplace, as it is in any human relationship. Conflict is a part oflife. But be assured that at
Swarthmore, the human resources stafftake their jobs
very seriously in this regard and address all employee

concerns thoroughly.

Although we cannot give you particulars regarding
the employee issues referenced in Alberti's letter and
subsequent comments in The Daily Gazette ("Joe
Alberti 'O6 questions treatment of Sharpies employees",
Oct. 6), there is obviously more to the situation than
Alberti may have been in a position to observe. Human
Resources is always alert to concerns raised by employees and works to have them positively resolved.
A visit to the HR Web site will clarify our commitment and role as expressed in our mission statement. A
review of the staff handbook, which is available online,
will also demonstrate that the college welcomes employee opinion and protects their right to express themselves vigorously.

However, budgetary constraints
are not my only grounds for concern. The fact is that the living

the way in which we currently conceive wages. Rather than wages

This is why I am confused by living wage campaign claims that

instead based on market determinants, a college living wage can
only prove effective if it induces a
more general shift to a living wage.
Apart from Swarthmore College, I

to afford a living wage. I would be
willing to cast other concerns aside
if I felt that a more extensive living

wage would form the vanguard of
reform, but this is not within the
realm of possibility.

watch each debate for entertainment, and I've had plenty of time to wrap my brain around
this Swat issue. The finer points of this fight have been beaten
with a dead horse, and some as-yet-undetermined clarifying
change to the SAC bylaws will be made in the near future, so
this week my beef is not with SAC but with all of you. Every bit
of this infuriating bickering is stemming from a fundamentally
flawed conception of the nature of politics we, Swarthmore and
America, have inexplicably, complacently accepted as truth.
We have made politics the holiest of holy land mines. We are
crippled by our belief that any mention of politics, no matter
what the context, will unfairly and harmfully marginalize some
portion of the student body. Indeed, some students will be divided over any "political issue" and some will likely feel marginalized, but this result is neither unfair nor is it unique to politics.
There are many choices people are forced to make in social
life on this campus. To drink or not to drink, to streak or hot to
streak, to smoke pot or not to smoke to pot, to support the legalization of the pot they smoke ... No, wait ... that one can't be
"social" because the TV says it's "political." Yes, it is "political,"
but in reality it is simply a choice based on a personal opinion,
just like the others.
Politics are not race and they are not sexual orientation, but
we treat them like the same animal. For years, our school and
our country have been conscious not to marginalize groups that
are born different from the "norm." On this campus we act as if
this applies to political persuasion, that every conservative was
born conservative and we must do everything we can to make
sure they are treated "equally" in every sense of the word. We
neglect the fact that American democracy by definition negates
this conception ofinherited politics, as you cannot directly participate in any political decision-making until 18 years after the
time at which your race and sexual orientation are decided.
Many would suggest it is more akin to religion, one of the
biggest social hot potatoes. The difference is that most organized religions are inextricable from ethnic and cultural ties that
are decided at birth. As a child, you can be Christian, Jewish,
Muslim or anything else your parents might be, but you have to
wait until the day you can buy cigarettes and porn, the day you
are legally accountable for every one of your decisions, to register to vote as a member of a specific political party. Politics, in
our community of legal adults, is an issue of choices and opinions reasoned and decided upon by our educated adult minds.
We decide whether or not we support privatization of Social
Security or an increase in the minimum wage with our own
minds, using our own opinions, without consulting any party
registration card grafted to our skin.
No opinion, however unpopular, should be silenced, but that
doesn't mean every opinion must be represented equally. It is in
our own best interest to hear views from all sides of any issue
to keep ourselves both honest and informed, but it is no more
the responsibility on a supremely left-leaning campus to make
sure right-wing opinions are equally represented as it is a New
York high school's responsibility to give equal support to the
Red Sox in the ALCS. The majority of us are allowed choose to
watch baseball over "Desperate Housewives" in our lounges, we
may choose to bash colonialism in our classes, and we may
decide to examine one political ideology closer than others at
our social events. While the political importance of such events
does not mandate SAC funding, it should not prevent them from
receiving that funding. This misrepresentation of politics as a
sacrosanct element of personal identity rather than a set of personal opinions on important issues distorts American democracy, and the enforcement of this bylaw is Swarthmore's institutional support of that distortion.

these postulates,

which are based on thousands
of years of accumulated wis-

dom. The Catholic Church
describes seven as the 'cige of
reason." Jewish "bar mitzvah"
and "bat mitzvah", the rites of passage into manhood and womanhood, take place at thirteen and twelve, respectively. Before
the 19th century and John Dewey, children were "little adults."
Reason pertains to the capacity to calculate cause and effect,
to finesse ethical judgment and to take moral responsibility,
regardless of cultural and religious context. The Catholic
Church defines the "age of reason" as the age when God begins
to hold every person morally responsible. Our more general definition is the age when every person is' morally responsible
because he is capable of logical thought.
Therefore, the seven-year-old is a rational agent to be debated with as with an adult, not condescended to as a kid. Every

teacher should treat his students as fellow interlocutors. School

should not be a 13- to 22-year socialization process. Teachers
should not treat students as a mass of human resources to
socially engineer into managers, technicians, mechanics and

fast food or department store clerks. School should be voluntary, for the compulsory school is a six-hour-a-day, five-day-aweek, nine-month-a-year prison. Its teachers are prison wardens engaged in classroom management. Even the elite private
schools and universities are mostly country club prisons.
Every person should be allowed to pass from grade to grade
at his own pace, but no social promotion as if in a factory. If an
eight-year-old adolescent can do calculus, why not twelfth-grade
math? If a ten-year-old adolescent can read "Hamlet" and "The
Autobiography of Malcolm X", why not twelfth grade English?
If a 16-year-old man cannot do basic arithmetic, why not firstgrade math? If a 20-year-old woman can not read a front-page
article ofThe New York Times, why not sixth-grade English?
The proper role model for every teacher is Socrates. The test
of time has proven the Socratic method as the root of democracy. The teacher who emulates Socrates sees every student as an
individual to be persuaded by careful reasoning and disciplined
inquiry. He asks good questions and encourages his students to
ask good questions and persuade him in turn. The Socratic

method teaches students to think through to their own conclusions. Current pedagogy gives students multiple-choice questions that ask them to choose among ready-made conclusions
based on propaganda and political correctness.

delightful Swatties with whom I am yet unacquainted,
refrain from randomly saying, "Hello."
Unexpected greetings plunge me into utter confusion.
Countless questions leap to mind: Do I know this person
who has inexplicably smiled or nodded in my general
direction? Were we introduced by a mutual acquaintance
over some long-forgotten pasta-bar dinner? Did we sit
next to each other in "Greece and the Barbarians" freshman fall? And on and on. By the time I get around to considering reciprocation of the goodwill gesture, its initiator is long gone, probably feeling devalued as a person by
my apparently haughty reticence.
What smacks of arrogance, however, is merely a
severe case of introversion. I am one of those individuals
who, as Atlantic Monthly columnist Jonathan Rauch so
vividly puts it in "Caring for Your Introvert" (March
2003), "growls or scowls or grunts or winces when accosted with pleasantries by people who are just trying to be
nice." Rauch paints introverts as 'among the most misunderstood and aggrieved groups" in a largely "extrovertist" America, only half-jokingly using phrases like
"come out" and "it's an orientation" to compare their
plight to that of homosexuals. So in this week dedicated
to acknowledging and accepting alternative lifestyles,
make an honest effort to understand this one.

to see why this behavior represents the height of courtesy
and thus why those who do not engage in it are throwbacks to an uncivilized age when "our ancestors were all
chilling out in caves."
A disinclination to wish every living soul a hearty
good-morning is not indicative of evolutionary retardation, nor is it symptomatic of deep-seated misanthropy;
introverts are neithr devoid of empathetic impulses nor
unwilling to aid their fellow man. They hold doors and
lend sugar and carry groceries for old ladies just like
everybody else. They just might need some alone-time

afterwards.

What I found most perplexing about Alex Ginsberg's
was the apparent desire to be deluded implicit in

op-ed

his closing appeal to readers to "pretend for five seconds
that you actually give a crap about the people you share
your planet and campus with." Does Alex really want
people to say "hello" to passersby not because they care
but out of some perverse sense of duty, because that's
what "you are supposed to do"? Wouldn't that rob the gesture of whatever meaning it still retained? And what
would prevent expressions of genuine interest and concern from getting lost amidst the glut of sham salutations? Practice indiscriminate greeting if you wish, but
kindly restrain the impulse to brand me a Neanderthal
for failing to do likewise.

for October." While entire dorms stay up
late to watch the ALCS, the men's soccer
team is bent on surviving until November.
With the Centennial Conference playoffs
only weeks away, the Swarthmore men's
soccer team maintains a tenuous hold on
fourth place. Only the top five teams
advance to the postseason.
If there's ever a bad time to have a losing

win
against
overtime
Muhlenberg on Oct. 9, the Tide has dropped
three straight. Coach Eric Wagner assessed
the situation. "We lost some focus over the

holiday," he said.
How huge was the Muhlenberg win?
Swat had not beaten the Mules in 11 years
and came from one goal behind to preserve
the Tide's perfect 6-0-1 home record.

relatively rested Bates team and came away
with a 2-1 loss. "We played extremely well

When asked about the toll that repeated
overtime games have taken, Coach Wagner
responded with confidence: "I think that the
[overtimes] are making us harder. Two games
in two days took its toll, however," he said.
The hard schedule drained the Tide as
they went south to face an undefeated and
nationally ranked Johns Hopkins squad. Well
rested, the Blue Jays had revenge on their
mind. Last year Swarthmore cost Hopkins its
national ranking and a chance at the NCAA
tournament with an upset victory. This year,
in a game where Coach Wagner explained,
"we didn't play our best," Swat lost 1-0. The
team has not lost by more than one goal all

The Hopkins game remains important in
what local fans have dubbed "The Centennial

dropped Swat to fourth place in the standings,
behind Johns Hopkins, McDaniel, and
Gettysburg. The Tide can still finish the regular season as high as second place, receiving

in a first round bye and home field advantage.

Happy Hunting

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

We wanted to cover a dead sport.
No, not Ultimate Frisbee, which was never alive, but a sport that
actually demands killing. So we went to the gun store over on
McDade to get the scoop on hunting and fishing
but all we got
was a lousy "Pennsylvania Hunting and Trapping Digest". The staff
told us less about hunting and fishing than we've told you about the
WNBA (Sue Bird, will you marry us?). Forty-five minutes in a
musty room and all we learned is that rifles are used to shoot deer
and handguns are used to shoot, uh, paper targets. Truth be told,
maybe we didn't learn that much because we couldn't shed our
Swarthmore College agenda in

favor of our journalistic integrity. At least this is true about
Sammy. On the other hand,
Dallas-native Shmu realizes that
this is "hard work" and unlike
his partner, didn't leave the store

in disgust.
But at least the eastern liberal

and the Texas cowboy can agree
on one thing: The terrorists
should die. Don't arrest them,
don't try them, just make sure
that you bring your shotguns (or
even AK's now that the ban's
up). You guys know that this is
all in good sport, right? Right?
As short as our journey into
the hunting world was, it was
only half of the investigation for

what we thought would be an
Shmu headed over to the shore and went fishing, and while he and B got skunked, they made a significant
observation. It happened to be the same observation that we made
during our foray into the world of hunting and guns a couple days
original article. So

later.
Where are the brothers at? Seriously. Are these sports really
dominated by angry white males? Is Alan Keyes not representative of black America? I think we know the answer to these questions, and we couldn't risk alienating this demographic with a full
column on hunting and fishing. So here's a little chocolate for
it's the first half of the Western Conference playoff
your milk

preview:

1) San Antonio Spurs
So the chocolate is actually white
chocolate, but don't let that throw you off. The Spurs picked up the
only Caucasian Slam Dunk champion of all time in Brent Barry.
The man is more street than Rucker, but he's also more cerebral
than Princeton
er, Swarthmore. And he's got great hair, which
happens to look exactly like Shmu's. And when Duncan holds up
the MVP trophy in June, he'll have one man to thank
himself.
Barry's solid, but this Spurs team is already loaded, and Barry's
just icing.
2) Minnesota T-Wolves All of the Wolves are back for another run, and the big roadblock is picking up birds a third of his size
down in South Beach. But they might not make it through this ride
together. Sprewell, in a contract year, will either demand the ball,
an extension, or a new locale. And while Shaq is gone, the Wolves'
frontcourt, aside from the Kid, is pretty lousy. The Kandi Man lacks
a certain hunger and the Michelin Man, Oliver Miller, is all too
hungry. That's leaves them with Mad Dog Madsen and Ervin "The
Iguanodon" Johnson. Awesome.
3) Dallas Mavericks This team is Stacked. Okay, that one was
pretty lousy. But Jerry Stackhouse as the seventh or eighth man?
The loss of Steve Nash (if you listen carefully, you can hear Shmu's
heart breaking) dealt a serious blow to the team's chemistry, but
that was never a real concern with the Mavs (paging Nick van
Exel). The last five years, Dallas had one tough guy
Eduardo
Najera. Now that he's gone, the Mavs turn soft, right? Wrong.
Nellie picked up a tough guy in Erick Dampier who can actually
play the game of basketball, and while the Latinos might not show
up at AA Arena this season, KG and Duncan won't be droppin' 50 on
the Mavs anymore.
4) Denver Nuggets Attention K-Mart... attention K-Mart. This
is not Cincinnati where you are encouraged to, well, let's say, act
up. Or Jersey where there's no one around to take notice. This is
Denver. Think Aspen. You are in the wealthy white suburbs, and
these guys aren't messing around after Kobe and the CU football
mess. So be nice and don't hit your teammates on the first day of
practice. And see if you can change that nickname to NeimanMartin.
Sorry to tease with only half the list, especially since we predict
the eventual Western Conference champs coming out of the bottom
four. But who are you to complain? Happy hunting for something
better to read than this column. We're out like Dick Cheney's
daughter.

Soccer loses OT game to McDaniel
BY TORI MARTELLO
vmartell@swarthmore.edu
The women's soccer team is hoping to keep its
spirit high as it has struggled through a trying season. The team is 3-11-1 overall and 1-5-1 in
conference play.
Over fall break, the team traveled
to Maine to compete against Bates
and the University of Maine at
Farmington. The trip involved a 10

hour ride as the women crammed

Unfortunately, the change of

both non-conference games.
"It was frustrating, especially

"We made mistakes and didn't cap

However, these women were

not ready to throw away this season
yet as their frustrations and anger boiled over last
Saturday against McDaniel. In a stunning change of
attitude that was visible through their play, the
Garnet clashed with the Green Terror during the
entire game until the scoreboard still displayed two
goose eggs at the end of regulation.
Even though McDaniel constantly forced the ball
in against the Swarthmore defense as it out-shot our

October 2% 2004

ladies 24-6, the team came together behind goalkeeper Kristen Traband 'OB as sh£ made 13 saves, a career
high. "We were winning balls out of the air and connecting all of our passes," Groom said.
Although the team seemed poised to seize this
in, the Garnet lost in the second overtime
s Terror forward Dawn Fletcher headed
he ball past the Swarthmore goalkeeper.
Nonetheless, this game has reenergized the
vomen's squad as it now looks forward to
ts three conference games which will wrap
up the season.
"For the first time in a while, everyone
played with heart," Groom said of the
McDaniel contest.
The match left the team excited and the outlook has shifted to a hopeful future as the team
believes it can win these last few games. The
Garnet's mind set this week is critical to its
chances in the final games. During practice, the
team displayed a new liveliness as they focus on
shooting and finishing. The team's inability to
score and form consistent offensive charges
has hobbled the team all season, but the ladies
will put that behind them as they prepare to
play Dickinson this Saturday on Clothier Field.
While it has been a tough season, Groom
noted constant improvement. "[The team] has
been getting better and better even though
the whole team dynamic changed with so
many new players," she said. The score

skills. The players' dedication shone
through when one observes all the visits to the
trainer's room as the players have suffered many
hits and bruises.
"A lot of people are hurt, but we want to help the
seniors end their careers on a good note," Groom
said, as she also played injured.

As anyone familiar with particle physics will tell you, the
basis of the physical world is fundamentally absurd (that is,
if you have a sense of humor). Then again, most of us know
from our own experience that life is fundamentally absurd. I
guess it should therefore come as no surprise that sports are
also fundamentally absurd.
Imagine for a second that Sir Lancelot, the greatest athlete in King Arthur's Court (and potentially, the greatest of
the Middle Ages) is beamed to the 21st century and told to

Swarthmore finished fifth in the
tournament, losing its first two
games but coming back with two
shutouts to close out the weekend.
Coach Harleigh Leach saw the
tournament as an opportunity for
her players to gel as a team and to
step up their intensity against
squads from a different region.
On Oct. 9, the Garnet squared off

against Wellesley and Smith. The

first match was a 3-0 shutout, with
Swarthmore losing to the eventual
tournament champions 18-30, 28-30,
25-30. Swarthmore managed to salvage a game in the second match,
but still fell to Smith 3-1 (22-30, 23-30,
30-26, 13-30). "We played two tough
teams," Leach said of Saturday's
matches. "We just weren't gelling
well. We weren't finishing."
Finishing has been an issue for
the Garnet all season, but on Sunday
the team decisively finished in both
matches and did not drop a single
game. Swarthmore came out strong

still saw room for
improvement over the last four
games of the season. "We need to
work on coming to play every

also put an effort into improving on
its finishing in close games.

The women's field hockey team members kept their
heads high after three straight losses against
Washington, third-ranked Ursinus, and the top-25
McDaniel team over fall break. "We played three very
strong opponents," coach Kelly Wilcox said. "We played
some great hockey, but we need to be more consistent
together. It's definitely part of a maturation process in

the program."

When the team played cohesively, strategies worked.
"We marked the leading scorer out of the game and she
never scored," Wilcox said of one game. "And with

The team maintains a positive outlook on its losses,
which Lorang said have strengthened them. "I think a
lot of the girls on the team will be motivated by what we
struggled with this week," she said. "We'll up the effort
and have a strong finish; we don't want to end the season poorly."
The Garnet scored two goals before losing to
Washington, but slipped into scoreless territory as the
week progressed. This "mental lapse," as co-captain
Joanna Hess 'O5 called it, has dropped the team conference record to 1-5.
"I don't think we were mentally prepared" she said.
The team was physically ready and unintimidated by its
opponents, but it could not find a way to play cohesive-

Lorang also said that the mental game needs to be
improved. For example, she said, there wasn't enough
"hustling to the ball," and "when we end up a goal or two
behind, people tend to give up quickly."
"I think that the team struggled with taking what we
learned and applying it to the field," Lorang said. "We
need to keep the work ethic up." Because these three
teams were so aggressive and offensive, coach Wilcox
said, the mental edge is paramount. "We need to learn

Lorang observed the effect of past performances on

how we played against teams last year and how we fared
this year," she said. "Even though we lost to Johns
Hopkins and Ursinus last year, we played very well
against them. That feeling led us to play well against
them this year."
Hess thought that the Tide had an exhilarating game
against the third-ranked Ursinus. "I thought we played

As Sir Lancelot would find out if he visited, sports have
become a spectacle, detached from the necessities of life. His
athletic prowess was (among other things) what kept him
alive and helped put food on the king's table. Our athletic
prowess lets us shoot a pumpkin-sized (and pumpkin-colored) leather ball into a hoop the size of a peach-basket.
Millions of young boys trying to be like Lancelot learned
skills that would help them, when assembled in large numbers, bring power and glory to their country. Kids in Brazil
aren't really improving the economic fortunes of their country by trying to be like Ronaldo and kick a checkered, blackand white ball into a goal the size of your mom's minivan,
but they do it anyway.
In "Pirates of the Caribbean" (apologies to all historians
for simplifying their discipline to the level of pop culture),
the blacksmith practices sword fighting every day so that
"When I meet a pirate, I can kill it!" (and eventually get the
girl). The Swarthmore Golf team, on the other hand, practices hitting a tiny white ball with an even smaller metal
club so that "When I meet a pirate, I can take him to a country club, bet him, and take all his treasure!" (and get all the

girls...)
So why do we do it? Why do we play and watch these
silly games? I don't know. I don't even know why some people prefer games that involve kicking balls, while other
people prefer games that involve hitting balls, but I intend
to find out. "Rocks with Sticks" will be a column that looks
deep into the human soul (or at least at the sole of my
shoes) and finds out what keeps us up all night thinking
about the time we failed to put our balls in the hole (or the
goal).

Hobbs wins Seven Sisters, squad beats Haverford
BY DARCY NELSON

The women's cross country
team is full of surprises.

At last weekend's Seven

Holyoke, Sarah Hobbs 'O6 took
first place with a time of 18:02.1
Once again, Hobbs achieved a

on

the soccer team in addition to
cross country. She competed
with the soccer team at Bates
over fall break before winning
Seven Sisters for the cross
country team.
"After spending about 30
hours on the bus in Maine I
think my legs were just ready
to move again," she said. "It's
easy to get fired up and try to
win the race in the first mile,
but then you get to the first
mile and realize you have two
more to go. But our whole team
went out really smart."
With a mile left to go, Hobbs
trailed the leader by 10-15 seconds. "I thought, 'man, I better
get going'," she said. With
about 400 meters to go, Hobbs
passed Bessett. "The finish line
felt like it was crawling away
but I caught it eventually. It
was the first race I've ever won,
so that was really exciting,"
Hobbs said.
In addition to Hobbs' victory, the women's cross country
team took third place behind
defending three-time champion
Wellesley and Smith. The Tide
finished ahead of Haverford,

which has a very strong running program.
"We
haven't
beaten
Haverford in a meet since I've
been here," coach Peter Carroll
said. "It's been a while." The
Fords finished in fourth place,
eight points behind the Tide.
Swarthmore was only two
points behind Smith.
The team had a day of great

races. "Everyone ran really
well," Molly Maurer 'O6 said.
"Our team had a great race
with so many people getting
[personal records]."

Five Swarthmore runners
made it inte the top 25. Carrie
Ritter 'O6 took ninth place, with
a time of 18:56.4, earning her a
spot on the All-Tournament
team along with Hobbs.
"I tried not to think of my
position during the first mile,
when I saw a huge group of
Haverford and Wellesley runners in front of me, but instead

concentrated on running a
controlled pace," Ritter said.
"I started to pick off the runners in front of me one at a
time during the second mile,
and still felt good enough to
really drop down the pace for
the third." Ritter's time, a personal best, also helped her

achieve the goals she set for
herself. "I really wanted to finish at a high place to help our
team score, and I was also aiming to finish in the top ten,

which determines the AllSeven Sisters team," Ritter
said.
Gardner

crossed the finish line at 19:10.8,
in 17th place. Next came Kavita
Hardy 'OB in 21st, with a time of
19:37.6, and Emily Wistar 'O6 in
22nd, with a time of 19:38.0. All
of the top seven runners earned
personal best times at the race.
"Kavita ran one of the
strongest races of the season,"
said Carroll. "In previous
races, she had been starting out
a little fast, so I told her to run
with Pam [Davis 'o7] and
Emily." Learning how to pace
greatly improved her time.

The team was happy to rank
higher than Haverford at the
end of the day. "We were so
excited to beat Haverford since
it's been so long," Wistar said.
"Haverford has depth, but we
are all very strong runners,
and we proved that at Seven
