Bagel virus attacks
college, infects many
BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu
Students once again found their inboxes inundated with virus-contaminated emails this week, following an attack by
the Bagel virus strain.

e-mails appeared to be from

would release the virus into computers if
opened. When the virus gets into a computer, it scans the user's address book
and sends the e-mail to others, according

Students hold rally at board meeting
While the Board of Managers met Saturday morning to discuss the living wage proposal, the Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign staged a rally. The
board met in the Scheuer Room of Kohlberg Hall. The rally featured musical performances by the a cappella group ACRONYM, Evan Greer ’O7 and a spoken-word
poetry recital by Emma Benn ’O4. The centerpiece of the rally, held in the courtyard
in front of Kohlberg, was a puppetry pageant in the style of street theater. Narrated
by Harris Kornstein ’O6, the skit was entitled, “The Meaning of Swarthmore.”
Puppets of faculty, staff and students sought to unlock the meaning of Swarthmore
using keys of justice, democracy, ethical intelligence and sustainability. The rally
ended with a procession around Kohlberg led by students carrying the puppets and
chanting. “I’m totally excited,” campaign member Al Bradbury ’O5 said. “We’re
poised on the threshold.” Over 50 students, as well as a number of faculty and
staff, attended the rally.

administrator.
The virus can also install software on
the user's computer that gives someone
else remote access to the computer. This
"adds a level of indirection," Finney said,
and allows the outside user to send spam,
install fileservers to share illegal files or
break into other computers and spread
the virus further, all without having to
reveal their identity.
The Bagel virus came out in January,
and there have been many variants since
then. The campus suffered two attacks
Tuesday, with "at least two to three different variants" emerging on the mail server in the afternoon, Finney said. ITS then
updated the virus definition on the mail
server to prevent it from further distribution. Later in the evening, Finney was
notified by his roommate, a current
Swarthmore student, that the virus had
reemerged in e-mail.
Finney then once again updated the
virus definition to include the new variant. "As soon as we update virus definitions on the mail server, no other viruses
can get through," he said.
Within the first 20 minutes of the day
on Wednesday, the ITS Help Desk had "30
voicemails, 80 e-mails and the phone ringing off the hook," with concerns about the
new virus, Finney said.
ITS also decided to no longer allow
delivery of zip files through e-mail, since
so many of the recent viruses were in the

form of a zip file. "This is not a battle we
are going to win, so we decided to block
zip files," Finney said.
If a student's computer is infected, ITS
will "most likely deactivate the machine
from the network, call them and tell them
to get in touch with their dorm consultants," ITS Client Services Manager Robin
Jacobsen said.
The dorm consultants will then run
Spyßot, AdAware, and a virus scan to try
to eradicate the problem. According to
Finney and Jacobsen, this will rid the stu-

dent's computer of the Bagel virus. But
some problems have persisted because of
hacking into some students' computers.
"A lot of student systems are being
hacked. These are very deep hacks,"
Jacobsen said. In these cases, students
must bring their computers to the Help
Desk for further assistance. There have
been nine different instances of malicious codes from hacked systems reported thus far.
The current viruses and hackers are
particularly malicious. "Now you have
new generation of viruses and virus writinstead
ers who do social engineering
of taking advantage of some technological
hole ... they're taking advantage of trick...

ing people," Finney said. "Everyone is
caught in the middle of dueling of hackers," Jacobsen said. "We need to make

sure the network is secure." She also said
other colleges and universities were dealing with similar problems.
To ensure this security, Jacobsen
announced in an e-mail on Wednesday
that students must have the latest version
of the college-provided Virus Scan software upon return from spring break.
If students did not have the update
already, she said, they would be put into a
restricted quarantine zone upon connecting to the network, which would allow
them only to view the Virus Scan installation page.
Meanwhile, ITS staff advised students
to avoid suspicious e-mails. "ITS would
never send out an attachment in an email for people to open," Finney said.

Film and history departments to hire Mellon fellows
BY TERESA KELLEY
tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu
The history department and
the film and media studies program will each hire a new faculty
member next year through the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
postdoctoral fellow program.
The fellowship is a two-year
position, through which young

professors teach part time but are
reimbursed with a full-time

stipend.

The history department hopes
to hire a professor with expertise
in modern Middle Eastern history, according to department chair
Pieter Judson '7B.
The position has been offered
to Mario Ruiz, a graduate student
at the University of Michigan. As
of press time, Ruiz has not yet
accepted the offer.

THE PHOENIX

The

Mellon

fellowship

and

similar programs allow the college to expand in a field that is
"promising or important for the
curriculum," Judson said. The
two-year fellowship also gives the
department a way to gauge student interest in a given field, and
whether it is feasible to consider

hiring a full-time tenure-track

professor with that specialty.
"Modern Middle Eastern history is a crucial area of study
because it's in the news and
there's a lot of rhetoric flying
around," Judson said. "It is
important to have serious and
reflective scholars to guide students in forming ideas rather
than the polarized media."
Honors history major Seth
Sias 'O4 said there is considerable
student interest in modern Middle
Eastern history. "The biggest gap

in [the history curriculum] is the
Middle East," Sias said.
The film and media studies program is also hiring a Mellon fellow. According to program coordinator Patricia White, 150 people
applied for the position.
In choosing a candidate,
emphasis was put on selecting
someone with a background in
film history and "new media,"
including computer-based art and

virtual reality.

There is a strong student
demand for courses in film and
media studies, according to
White. The introductory level
course is consistently filled to
capacity, and there is steady
demand for production courses.
The addition of a Mellon fellow
"will benefit the program enor-

by almost doubling
course offerings," White said.

mously

March 4, 2004

The film and media studies program was targeted by the
"Meaning of Swarthmore" capital
campaign as an area for growth.
According to the capital campaign's Web site, "At a time when
visual media are replacing print in
shaping contemporary culture and
thinking, the college must prepare
students to respond to film, television and other visual media with
the same sensitivity and critical
acumen with which they respond
to the written word."
The Mellon program is "mutually beneficial" for the fellow and
the college, according to Lisa
Smith, director of corporate, foun-

dation and government relations.
The program enables "the fellow to acquire valuable teaching
experience while also having
enough time to finish [and] develop a dissertation into publishable

research, before looking for a
tenure-track job. It also gives
them a chance to learn what a
small liberal arts college is like,
in contrast to the research university where they are probably
getting their Ph.D.," Provost
Connie Hungerford said in an

e-mail.

"The benefit for the college is
the stimulation of young faculty
who are often in emerging fields

of intellectual engagement," she
said.
According to Smith, the college received $400,000 from the
Mellon Foundation in 1996-1999,
and is currently drawing from a
four-year $500,000 grant in addition to an annual $lll,OOO distri-

bution fund from the college's
endowment to sponsor postdoctoral fellows and other academic

ventures.

Board to raise tuition,
implement new IP policy
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

The Board of Managers met this
weekend and agreed to increase next
year's tuition and establish an intellectual property rights policy.
The board approved next year's capital and operating budgets with few
increases over last years because of
continued financial restraints. Costs,
including salaries commensurate with
faculty retention, financial aid to students, and health insurance, continued
to grow at a rate greater than inflation.
The college will raise tuition by 4.5
percent next year to cover these

increasing costs.

The outlook for the school's budget
is still uncertain, but the five-year forecast shows that only next year's budget will be balanced, according to board
member Tom Spock '7B.
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l
said the coming years would be difficult
financially but that the budget gaps
were relatively small and would be easily filled. "It is important to forecast the
future and see what you can do with it.
It just becomes clear that we will always
have to raise money. Philanthropy is
key to the equation," he said.
"The meeting was very broadly
attended by the board, including some
fascinating new board members who
should have a terrific impact," Spock
said. "The board continues to be con-

cerned with balancing the budget, con-

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

cerned with the future forecasts given
the business office. We also spent a

by

lot of time on the college's visibility
and the implications for current and
future students."
The Academic Affairs Committee

reported to the board on the implementation of an official college policy

on intellectual property.
The proposed policy is unconventional in that it would allow faculty to
own the rights to their research and
publications. This is different from
most large research institutions,
where the university owns the rights
to the intellectual property.
Eldridge said the adoption of such a
policy was a way to encourage new faculty to work at the school without the
constant pressures of conducting

research.

The board hopes this policy will
increase students and faculty to produce more intellectual property. Under
the recently implemented policy, IP
created by the students and faculty
would belong to them, but IP created
by staff, such as an admissions booklet,
would belong to the college, The
Phoenix reported in October.
"There were enough concerns raised
that the board decided it necessary to
perform a more in depth and formal
conversation at their next meeting,"
Eldridge said. "Mostly members raised
questions about what other institutions
do and whether or not Swarthmore was

a new course."

Comedian Hedberg to perform
The Large-Scale Events Committee has invited comedian Mitch Hedberg to
perform at Swarthmore on May 4, according to Student Life Representative
Wee Chua ’O6. Hedberg has performed on “The David Letterman Show,” “That

’7os Show,” “ED” and “Almost Famous.”
According to a 2001 interview published in alternative Washington paper
Seattlation, “Mitch’s style is droll and understated.” Student Activities
Coordinator Jenny Yim contacted Hedberg and booked him to perform at the
college. Earlier this year, the Large-Scale Events Committee asked the rock
band the Flaming Lips to perform, but they could not because they were
recording this spring. Committee chair Jeff Traczynski ’O4 was unavailable for
comment.

Amid protesters, students escort at women's clinic
Pro-Choice Task Force volunteers deflect vocal opposition outside Planned Parenthood

BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

The first time Jenny Holm 'O7
worked as an escort at Planned
Parenthood, a man with a video
camera came up to the corner

where she was standing.
"He kept getting in our faces
with the camera, asking 'How do

Once the escorts arrive at
Planned Parenthood, they put on
bright yellow pinnies and stand at
the corners or the gate.
"We look for women of childbearing age, then we ask them if

Enjoying college life without the academics
The Phoenix presents part tvvo of its look back at the history of Swarthmore. This week, the
focus is on social life at the college, from sports to the performing arts to Greek life.
BY MEGO LIEN AND CAROLINE GRUBBS

Swarthmore through the years
1869 Parrish is built, and Swarthmore welcomes
its first class.
1881 Parrish burns down in a fire and is rebuilt
later that year. The Phoenix begins publication in
December, naming itself after the bird that rises
out of the ashes. Trotter opens to accommodate
the college’s science departments.
1903 Wharton dormitory is built.
1906 The college builds Carnegie Library.
1921-27 The fraternity lodges are built.
1927 Bond, the Lodges and Worth are built.
1928 The Friends Historical Library and Tarble
Social Center are added to Carnegie Library.
1935 Palmer, Pittenger and Roberts, which originally made up Swarthmore Preparatory School,
are handed over to the college.

1959 Willets and Dupont are built.
1964 Sharpies is constructed.
1967 McCabe, Dana and Hallowell are built.
1973 Lang Music Building opens.
1981 Mertz starts hosting students.
1982 A fire destroys most of Tarble Social
Center; Old Tarble is one-third of the original
building.

1983 The college begins construction of a “new
Tarble” inside Clothier Memorial Hall.
1993 The Lang Performing Arts Center opens.
1994 Kohiberg Hall is constructed.

mlienl@swarthmore.edu and cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu

When Swarthmore opened in 1864, its athletic facilities
included "a gym, a 10-pin bowling alley and a number of
boats."
Single-sex sports clubs for "tennis, croquet [and] other
games" existed, but athletics were not among the administration's priorities in the 1870s.
"There were no athletics except an occasional ball
game," according to Richard Walton in "Swarthmore, An
Informal History."
In 1878, Swarthmore played its first competitive football
game against the University of Pennsylvania. Football
quickly gained "a disproportionate importance on campus,"
Walton wrote, and enjoyed much debate during its 100-year

run.

In 1905, when a particularly violent game with Penn
ended with a newspaper photo of a Swarthmore player's
"mashed face," President Theodore Roosevelt threatened

to dismantle American football if the rules were not
changed.
Under President Frank Aydelotte in the 1920s and '3os,

the emphasis on football diminished as Princeton and
Haverford were dropped from the play schedule. Tensions
arose in the 1980s over hiring a coach for the nationally
renowned team, and the sport was entirely cut from
Swarthmore athletics in 2000.
Football was not the only sport to receive attention at
Swarthmore. Under President Joseph Swain, the college
saw the introduction of lacrosse, basketball, tennis, field
hockey and varsity baseball in the first few years of the 20th
century.
By the 1980s, teams in tennis, baseball, track and basketball all enjoyed national accolades.
Nancy Donaldson '46 was deeply involved with athletics
during her time at Swarthmore. She played club lacrosse
and varsity field hockey, managed the basketball team and
even performed in synchronized swimming shows.
"I came from an athletic house," Donaldson said. Her
father was a coach at Swarthmore, and she attended local
independent schools that, in contrast to other schools,
offered sports for girls. Donaldson started playing lacrosse
when she was eight and picked up her first hockey stick at
age 1L
Donaldson remembered playing local schools like Penn,
Temple and Arcadia. Because gasoline was rationed in
World War 11, sports teams could not travel far to compete.
Nevertheless, sports were "a great release" from her aca-

demic studies, she said. Donaldson made close, lasting
friends on her sports teams, including a number of men who
were sailors from the Navy's V-12 program.
Since the enrollment of men fell drastically during World
War 11, Swarthmore agreed to admit sailors in the Navy, all
of whom played sports, Donaldson said.
Vice President of Administration Larry Schall '75 also
remembered being "very focused on sports" while he was at
Swarthmore.

"I played the kazoo. We were terrible."
Laurie Trescott 79, on participating
in the Marching Society
Schall was the captain of the soccer team and recalled
winning the conference and qualifying for the finals in
Chicago. The team went out the night before to buy pantyhose to wear under their uniforms, he said.

Alumni recalled participating in sports-related antics in
their day. Max Trescott '79, who did not play a sport, was
nevertheless named Homecoming Queen. The title required
him to go on the field dressed in a gorilla suit at halftime of
a football game.
"We poked fun at everything," he said.
Trescott's wife, Laurie Trescott '79, participated in the
Marching Society. "I played the kazoo
we were terrible,"
she said. "But we were very supportive of the football team,
...

because they always lost."
When the Trescotts attended Swarthmore, the football
team was enduring a 35-game losing streak. CBS even
arrived on campus in anticipation of the team's 36th loss,
but the game ended in favor of Swarthmore resulting in a
massive party, Max Trescott said.Laurie Trescott still keeps
a piece of the goal post she took from that game.
The performing arts

Because Quakers discouraged forms of entertainment,
the performing arts did not arrive on campus until the
19405, when it became possible to major in music at

Swarthmore.
When economics professor Larry Westphal arrived to
teach in 1986, the faculty was in the process of voting for a

theater department.

Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 remembered that "the
arts had a much less visible presence on campus" than they
do today.
Carol Becker '57 described the presence of theater as
entertainment when she was a student in the 19505. "I
didn't miss a single play that students put on," she said.
Becker also described a series of lectures on the performing arts that took place in the early 19505. "They really got
us the cream of the crop," she said, mentioning Jerome
Robbins and Harold Prince as two particularly memorable

speakers.

m

Similarly, Jon Van Til '6l participated in the performing
arts "only as a viewer or listener, unless you count writing
for The Phoenix as a performing art."
A large musical event took place in the amphitheatre
every spring, said education professor Lisa Smulyan '76,
who played the French horn in the orchestra and in cham-

o.

ber groups.

Parties and pranks through the decades
BY MEGO LIEN AND CAROLINE GRUBBS
mlienl@swarthmore.edu and
cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu
Five fraternities came to Swarthmore in
1888. Their introduction to campus "demonstratedthat earlier Quaker simplicities were
gone, probably forever," Richard Walton
wrote in "Swarthmore College: An Informal
History."
Greek life quickly gained popularity
and prominence on campus until the 1920s
and '3os, when President Frank Aydelotte
reduced the number of fraternity dances
and organized non-fraternity men in order
to involve more students in social activities.

During the Great Depression, "a time of
liberalism and social concern on college
campuses," fraternities and sororities
came under increasing criticism, Walton
wrote. After a vote by the Women's Student
Government Association, sororities were
abolished from Swarthmore in 1933.

Fraternities remained, but they were never
as influential as they had been in the mid-

30s.
Nevertheless, fraternities continued to
be a dominant social presence at

Swarthmore.

The father of Nancy Donaldson '46 was a
Delta Upsilon brother, and as a student,
Donaldson said she befriended many of the
DU men. Max Trescott '79, who was a Phi Psi
brother, said fraternities played a significant part of the campus social life, frequently holding dances, parties and dinners.
In the fall of 1951, the college's five fraternities were under "full scale attack,"
and were charged with practicing discrimination and being divisive. Student
Council held a referendum to see if fraternities should be abolished, and "a substantial majority" of students voted

against

fraternities

and

discrimination, according to

Walton.
"The frats had different reputations,"
Laurie Trescott '79 said, explaining that
there were "nice frats" that catered to "the
smart sports." By the late 19705, she said,
three fraternities existed on campus: Delta
Upsilon, Phi Psi and Phi Sigma.
The party scene
"There were far fewer recreations other
than theater and music," Donaldson said of
her time at Swarthmore, "so we made our
own fun."
Popular pastimes in the 1940s included
dancing in the Parrish Commons (now the
second-floor Campus Resource Center)
after dinner every day. For half an hour
students would dance
no date was necessary
or play cards at the booths that
lined the walls.
Education professor Lisa Smulyan '76
described social life as "less organized"
when she attended. Smulyan could not
recall any all-campus parties, citing fraternities and dorm rooms as the preferred
party locations.
Jon Van Til '6l also said Greek houses
and dorms were where most parties were
held on campus.
Swarthmore traditionally had strict
drinking rules: Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l had to rake leaves on Parrish
lawn after being caught drinking wine
with his girlfriend on her birthday.
During the Vietnam War, however,
drinking rules were relaxed, Dean of the
College Bob Gross '62 said.
The administration preferred having
students drinking on campus rather than
anywhere

else. Gross remembered attend-

ing parties in Crum Woods, where students
would build a bonfire, play guitars and

drink Court bottles of beer.
"I can still feel the shape of [the bottles]
in my hand," he said.
Similarly, Carol Becker '57 described a
campus-wide party called "work day."
Everyone went down to the Crum meadow,
had a picnic and played games like tug of
war, she said.

"There were far fewer
recreations other than

During the 1960s Nixon-Kennedy election, Gross hosted a party in his Roberts
quint. He went home to Philadelphia to
borrow his mother's "little black and white
TV set." The election results were not
announced until about 7 a.m., and by that
time there were only about half a dozen
"diehards" left, Gross said.
Vice President of Administration Larry
Schall '75, who arrived at Swarthmore in
the last year of the draft, remembered that,
after the lottery that year, the person with
the lowest number had to throw a party.
"That was the first time I got drunk," he
said, "off of Andre's Cold Duck beer."

Just chillin'
Sometimes Swarthmore students just

hung out.

In Donaldson's first year, milk and
cookies
and cocoa in the winter would
be served on the third floor of Parrish.
"This of course fattened us up enormously," she said, laughing.
Sommerville, originally a women's gym
located on the current site of McCabe, was
converted into a student center in the 1950s
and was "a pleasant place to gather," Van

Til said.

Eldridge

"Capitol Steps applied to Swarthmore."

Becker remembered one Hamburg Show
called "Bottled in Bond," a takeoff of a
Charlie Chaplin film. There were silent
parts with piano accompaniment and strobe
lights, creating an old film effect. The premise, that there was a liquor distillery in
Bond, was very funny because "liquor was
completely taboo on campus," Becker said.
Becker also recalled an annual maypole
dance, followed by one of the senior women
being chosen as the Queen. On May Day,
senior women were also presented with an
anonymous bouquet of flowers outside
their door.
The McCabe Mile began during the
Trescotts' years at Swarthmore. Max
Trescott also remembered that in the 19705,
"served meals" took place every Friday and
Saturday in the smallest room in Sharpies.
Students made reservations to dine in the

them throughout the library. The library
then closed so that all the catalogs could be
found; several were not discovered until
another contest was held to locate them.
Economic professor Larry Westphal
described various April Fool's Day pranks.
One involved taking all of the Adirondack
chairs and putting them in a huge tree.
"How that was done, nobody knows," he
said. One year, all the chairs were taken
' out of Trotter.
The following year, political science
professor James Kurth spent the night in
Trotter with a camera, looking out for

potential pranksters, Westphal said.
One of Swarthmore's most popular and
provocatively titled traditions is the annu-

special dining room, with candlelight and
student waiters dressed in black and white,

Laurie Trescott said.
She also remembered a breakfast dance
held every spring in Sharpies, where students would choreograph and lip synch
rock songs.
Pranks have always played a large part
of student tradition on campus.
Max described a contest in the spring of
1975 to see who could do the most outrageous thing on campus. The winners
removed all the card catalog drawers from
their cabinets in McCabe and distributed

'

al Screw Your Roommate dance. Students
arrange a blind date for their roommates
and choose a concept for the couple
Sleeping Beauty and her Prince, for example, or peanut butter and jelly. Then, for
one Saturday each spring, Sharpies
becomes a singles bar as students rush to

find their screw-mate.
As Swarthmore traditions go, Screw is

relatively young. Dave Allegeier 'B6, who
chaired the Student Social Committee
during his time at Swarthmore, told The
Phoenix in 1996 that Screw "began in the
spring of 'B3, which would have been my
freshman year. Some members of my
class had heard about it from another
school, and decided to try it at

Swarthmore."

said that Sommerville had a

space upstairs for dancing, which was also
where the folk dance club met. There was a
snack bar in the basement that served
hamburgers and milkshakes and had a
jukebox. It was a "great snack bar," Gross

�

remembered.
Becker played bridge after every meal
in Parrish's Campus Resource Center,
which she described as "a big barn of a
place." In fact, she met her future husband
during a bridge match. Eldridge also
remembered the CRC as a popular place to
hang out on campus.
Eldridge also remembered frequently
playing a game called "stretch" on the
lawns in front of Parrish. To play, students
stood in a circle and threw a butter knife
between two people so that they had to
move their foot to reach it. Then one of
them threw the knife between two other
people. Gradually, legs stretched out, and
whoever stretched the furthest and could
still throw the knife won.

Try Harvard for erotica magazine, not Swat

Contrary to news reports, college has no regular publication devoted to sex
BY CHRISTINA TEMES

It has been more than three years

held by JulieRusso 'Ol in 200

lished erotica magazine Unmentionables
was circulated around Swarthmore, but
recently it has merited a mention in college and metropolitan newspapers across

that and share," Russo said. The students
involved in the workshop decided to publish a "zine" with their work.

The media coverage surrounding the
which featured erotic literature
and poetry, stemmed from recent publicity
surrounding a proposed sex magazine at
Harvard.
The magazine, to be titled "H Bomb,"
would feature articles about sexual
issues, humor, art and
the primary
cause of debate
nude photographs of
undergraduates, according to The
Harvard Crimson.
A story about "H Bomb" made it onto
the Associated Press newswire on Feb. 11
and was picked up by major newspapers,
according to Tom Krattenmaker, director
of news and information.
"I guess when your article contains the
word 'Harvard' and the word 'sex,' it's
going to be a big story," Krattenmaker said.
The AP article contained a reference to
Swarthmore and Vassar's "sex-themed
magazines," but this was not entirely accu-

Students were also pleased with the finished product. "I heard some good feedback

columnist Tristan
Taormino mentioned Unmentionables in
her Oct. 18, 2002 column on sexually
themed college magazines. Krattenmaker
said he thought this was probably the
source of the error in the AP article.
"[AP reporters] probably did an
Internet search and found the Village
Voice article and didn't check" to see if the
magazine was still being published, he
said.

The finished product contained four fiction stories, a poem, a "smut manifesto"
and a "round robin," an erotic story written collaboratively by 12 people via e-mail.

Newspapers from the Boston and
Hartford areas did contact the college to
check the information and consequently
did not make any reference to Swarthmore
in their articles.
When the story first came out,
Krattenmaker, who had never heard of
Unmentionables, directed some inquiries
to Phoenix Editor in Chief Benjamin
Kabak 'O5. Krattenmaker then contacted
the AP with information Kabak gathered
about Unmentionables.
The AP ran a correction on Feb. 15,
informing readers that the Swarthmore
magazine had only run once.

According to Krattenmaker, many of
the newspapers that ran the original article also ran the correction.
"My worry

He only received one e-mail from an
alumnus who was concerned about the
magazine.
"I think they were looking for some

reassurance that Swarthmore hadn't
become too crazy about sex, and when we
explained [the magazine] to them, they
were perfectly happy," Krattenmaker
said.
As of press time, the fate of the Harvard
magazine is still uncertain.
While Harvard's Committee on College
Life initially voted to approve H Bomb for
funding,
the committee announced
Monday that it had changed its decision
and would not fund the magazine.
It plans to meet with the creators of H
Bomb to be sure the magazine would not
contain pornographic material,
the
Harvard Crimson reported.
Russo expressed concern about the
Harvard sex magazine in an e-mail. "What
does disturb me is the almost exclusive
emphasis on the pornographic boundary as
the key to H Bomb's condemnation or legitimation," she said.
"When [the creators] have to defend
their project as not-porn in order for it to
be approved, it feeds back into the culture
of sexual repression that they are trying to

Geeks on the
silver screen

Arts

BY EVA HOLMAN

eholman2@swarthmore.edu

How many times has this happened to you? After spending a
little too long chatting awkwardly with your roommate's jocky
friends, or a few too many hours playing "Dungeons and
Dragons," you get an insatiable desire to rent a good geek
movie. But instead of feeling newly confident at the night's end,
you feel unfulfilled, empty even.
Before you exact revenge on Blockbuster by running up
astronomical late fees, think again. Perhaps this time the film
industry is not to blame.
Things have changed in the geek

movie genre. Due to technical advances in the field, the subcategories have expanded
beyond the cult classic "Revenge of the Nerds." Some movies
cater to geeks, some are about them, and some just have an
amorphous geek quality to them that defies explanation. The
following well-researched guide can help you learn the tricks of
the geek movie trade so you can finally have a confidence-building Friday night.

Geek makeover gone awry
This category is for the geek wary of makeovers. "The
Nutty Professor" is an archetype; it warns us of the danger of
being dissatisfied with one's self image. Eddie Murphy is
Klump, a brilliant college professor who is so self-conscious
about his body weight that he changes himself into slim
Buddy in order to win his colleague's heart. Skillfully tapping
into everyone's worst fear of being a closet jerk once shed of
geekiness, "The Nutty Professor" lets the geek who is watching realize that de-geekifying is a dangerous risk one should
never undertake. The moral of the story: Be yourself, or Jada
Pinkett will never go out with you.
The inherent cuteness that is being geeky
Nothing illustrates this category better than "What's Up,
Doc?" Ryan O'Neal is Howard Bannister, an earnest rock collector who has the misfortune of crossing paths with misfit
Judy Maxwell, played by Barbra Streisand. Howard is unmistakably geeky in his mannerisms, from his bow tie to his ability to work igneous rocks into any conversation. Yet his
earnest charm makes him irresistibly attractive to both his
female co-stars and his viewers. Films under this category let
their audience know that, in the end, nothing is more endearing than being a geek, while simultaneously lengthening

viewers' rock

vocabulary

tenfold.

Geek turned sexy
This type of movie fares well with the ideological geek, one
who nurses the hope that he or she will someday be able to infiltrate a high school cool crowd while simultaneously furthering
a career. Of the many movies that cater to this specialized geek,
"Never Been Kissed" perhaps fits most closely. Drew Barrymore
plays Josie Geller, a copy editor, who must overcome her history as "Josie Grossie" and become BFF with the most popular 18year-olds the local school has to offer. This movie confirms the
oft-researched theory that no geek is beyond help and reminds
us that, nine times out of 10, geeks have a fun-loving younger
brother who adds to the general hilarity of any situation.
Geeks in their element
This subcategory is suited for those geeks who wish others
knew the secret edginess that comes along with being a techie. If
you fit the preceding description at all, then "The Net" is the
movie for you. Sandra Bullock plays Angela Bennett, a gorgeous
yet reclusive systems analyst whose identity is erased by evil
hackers. Catering especially to computer science geeks, this
movie's major draw is that, unlike "The Matrix," "The Net" could
actually happen. Geeks who like this movie should get their
friends to watch it, too. It will keep the idea flickering in the
backs of their minds that, during your many hours in front of the
computer, you may actually be foiling terrorist plots.
So, if you're a geek looking for a good movie, it pays to know
the ropes in the genre's complicated industry. There are many
sub-categories, and each one is equally valuable. I must say,
though, when it comes down to it, I'm partial to the "compulsively grouping movies into esoteric geek categories" category.

One of the less-sequestered McCabe study spaces

Christina Procacci Phoenix Staff
-

where you can't hide your own procrastination.

Gettin' your study on
BY EMILY GASSER

egasserl@swarthmore.edu

It's that time of the semester again, that time we all
dread, when even the most social Swatties retreat into
their secluded corners to study. It's time for midterms.
So when everyone disappears to cram, where exactly
do they go?
First, let's look at the obvious choice: the
Cornell, McCabe or
libraries. But which is best
UnderhiU? Underhill, found in Lang Music Building,
is quiet, but it's also really, really small. The basement is generally pretty deserted, if slightly claustrophobic. It's not a bad spot, as long as you don't mind
the complete lack of sunlight. My verdict: Leave it for
the music majors.
Next up: Cornell. "In general, Cornell is a better
library to study in than McCabe," Emily Nolte 'O7
said.

Cornell is the friendliest of the three libraries,
with its big, purple couches and giant windows. The
little corner upstairs with all the sci-fi novels
reminds me so much of a reading corner in a firstgrade classroom, I half expect a teacher to appear and
start story time. The couches at the foot of the stairs
on the lower level make it feel more like a lounge
than a library. While there are a few little rooms
tucked in the rear of the basement, most of the study
areas are big and open and friendly, which is precisely the problem.
Cornell seems great for low-key, casual studying,
but for hard-core-day-before-the-big-exam-gotta-write-15-pages-by-tomorrow-anti-social-Swarthmore-type
studying, nothing beats McCabe.
If you've never gone into McCabe just to explore, do
so. The building is old enough, unlike ultra-modern
Cornell, and big enough, unlike Underhill, to be full of
nooks, crannies and, as I discovered, whole rooms and
even staircases you never knew existed. According to
Brian Park 'O6, the best place to study is the third
floor. I say only the faint of heart and weak of leg stop
there. Social studiers can congregate in the third-floor
lounge, but if you're looking for true seclusion, you've
gotta go all the way up.
The best carrel, in my opinion anyway, is tucked in
the far corner of the section with the art books, right
behind the shelves on Japanese painting and ancient
pottery. It's all by itself in the corner, right under a
window with a great view of Parrish Beach, and it's
absolutely silent. Some former studier etched into the
surface, "Economic life is almost as difficult as
Chaotica." Somebody else wrote "478." My question is,
478 what? Pages to go? Hours? Weeks? Years? We can
only guess.

March 4, 2004

If the thought of climbing all those stairs is a little
too much for you, try heading in the opposite direction and descend into the depths of the lower level. It
may be easier to get to, but, according to Nina
Thanawala 'O7, "it's a little frightening." Most other
people I've talked to seem to agree. "I really don't like
that spot," Shingo Murata 'O7 said. "But right before
exams I force myself to go to the basement of McCabe
and sit in one of the chairs by the window. It's so
quiet, and nobody walks by. It's just you and your

books."
If you poke around a bit, you'll find the census
room, another completely deserted spot. Why more
people don't go there I have no idea; the carrels have
comfy chairs and a ground-level view of Willets. But
apparently the place has been pretty empty for a
while; on one table, there's a typewriter.
And there are a lot more hidden spots. Across from
the BL through BJ shelves is a little room filled with
chairs, with one desk in the middle. Behind the
E3lO-E353 shelves is a desk complete with a computer
station. And somewhere in between is a locked door,
with a sign saying "Reserved for users of the Kurzweil
machine." How mysterious.
And then there's the staircase I didn't know existed. If you go into the Peace Collection (gold star if you
know where that is) and walk straight back toward the
caged-off section I told you the basement was creepy
you'll see a plain metal flight of stairs. It leads up to
the Friends Historical Library, which, incidentally, is

another good quiet study spot.
So, what if you're not into the whole library scene?
Ann Vargo 'O4 recommends the second and third floors
of Kohlberg, in the big chairs at the ends of the halls,
or the Science Center coffee bar. "The coffee bar has
just the right level of distraction," she says. "I can look
out the big window, and the sunlight streams through.
Natural lighting helps me stay awake." The easily
available caffeine doesn't hurt, either.
In fact, it seems most people prefer to stay cloistered in their rooms rather than study in a public
place, and I'm inclined to agree. It's just so much better when you've got snacks and spider solitaire for
procrastination all within arm's reach. Lisa
Spitalewitz 'O5 summed it up: "In my room, I can control the conditions; if it's loud or soft, if there's music
or not," she said. "It's not like in the library, where it
has to be quiet, or in Kohlberg, where people might be
talking."

So, for exam studying, there's a good selection of
secluded places to hide and concentrate. For the rest of
the time, there's virtual bubble wrap. Go to
fun.from.hell.pl/2003-11-24/bubblewrap.swf, and you'll
never work again.

Church

basements

have

always been dank breeding
ground for the geek. Home to local
community theater productions,

awkward middle school dances
and spaghetti dinners, it seems fitting that a church's charity
extends not only to finding and

to clothing the lost-looking,

Stylistic Devices

If you don't understand our
strained connection to Phoenix
Geek Week, the Trinity Church
basement thrift store on the corner of Chester Road and College
Avenue
incidentally, a fiveminute walk or 20-minute van
ride from McCabe
is the perfect locale for a thrift store. Like
the loser who becomes prom
queen, thrifting has recently
undergone a surge in popularity,
taken off those thick glasses, and
sold them to you for $3.50 (no
tax!). But the loser who becomes
prom queen still enjoys Star Trek
re-runs, and thrifting is still
geeky at heart. Turning the
church's selection of wide-collared '7os polyester shirts and

seasonal sweaters into couture
can be almost as hard as turning
water into wine. 1 As a public
service, we spent $l2 of the
Phoenix's money to see if we

could convert geek to chic.
Open every first and third
Friday of the month from 8:30 a.m.
to 1:30 p.m., the confusing hours
ensure that the selection is never
picked over. Just to be sure, we
arrived shortly after it opened. To
set the scene for those who have

not experienced this thrift store,
the shopper is greeted by a chorus
of very friendly older women,
whom we might venture to call
"cute." They had no reservations
about calling us cute; indeed,
when we started at the coat rack
in the front room, we had to
ignore their compliments or we
would have gone over budget (and
be the owners of several suspiciously stained fur coats). An

hour and several Episcopalians
later, we left our surrogate grandmothers and toted the large trash
bags of clothing back up the hill to
Parrish Circle.
Our purchases came to: one
manly lavender-collared shirt for
the young gentleman; also for the
gentleman,
young
two

"Swarthmore Swim Club" T-shirts
from your parents' years at Swat;
and a Frank's Nursery logo tee
that Urban Outfitters would think
was ironic enough to sell for $5O.

Geek social life: Xbox and birch beer
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu
What do geeks do for fun? At Swarthmore, where we're
pretty much all geeks, the question becomes clouded with
technicalities. In such a work-oriented, obscure hobby-dominated environment (didgeridoo, anyone?), the lines of distinction among geeky, normal and cool interests are finely
drawn. Last weekend, two very "geeky" events took place:
the SCDC LAN party and the SWIL Root Beer Kegger.
A LAN, for the uninitiated, is a local area network.
Therefore, a LAN party is "a bunch of computers hooked
together," Nelson Pavlosky 'O6 said. Pavlosky and Luke
Smith 'O6 are the co-founders of the Swarthmore Coalition
for the Digital Commons, the group that hosted the party.
Smith described the party as an "instantaneous digital
community." The LAN party, he said, is a "participatory
event

sively consuming information."
SCDC's purpose for the LAN party was twofold. One
was to have fun, but the other was part of SCDC's mission:to share an open culture, open content and open-source

software.
Smith packed several people's computers into his car
and drove them to Science Center Room 199 Friday
evening. Armed with networking equipment, approximately 50 enthusiasts arrived to share programs, files and
information.
Video games were also a significant component of the

"A lot of people brought their Xboxes," Smith said.
"We had 10 computers, four Xboxes, five TVs, a projector,
DDR [Dance Dance Revolution]
it was a lot of stuff... It
was a huge success."
Many SCDC members didn't like using the label "geek"
to describe themselves. "Computers aren't geeky anymore," Smith said. "They're not something that's used by
a small subset of the population."
"I think if you were to ask whoever went there if they
were a geek, at least a quarter of them would say "no,'
Ashley Dickinson 'O7 said. Dickinson is currently a member of SCDC. "My weekends are partying just like any
other normal person
I have no problem going to Paces

"

...

parties."
The SWIL Root Beer Kegger, in comparison, catered to
those students who were less interested in run-of-the-mill
Paces activities. Unlike normal Saturday nights at Paces,
no alcohol was served. Instead, party-goers enjoyed a quar-

ter keg of high-quality birch beer.
The music playlist was drastically different as well,
incorporating techno, video game remixes and obscure

selections, like a Cantonese version of "YMCA."
"We played the classic 'Like a Prayer' and some Britney
Spears," SWIL member Blake Setlow 'O6 said. But "we
[also] played a special remix from 'Zelda, the Ocarina of
Time' and a Super Mario Brothers remix."
Overall, the party was "less rowdy" than an average
Paces party, Setlow said. "But the kegger was very much a
party. People were dancing in the dark with loud music.

The music may have been video game-themed occasionally, but it was dance music
interesting, non-mainstream
dance music. SWIL's event was social and strange and
kind of geeky."
Swillies are apparently far more comfortable with
using the word "geek" when describing themselves.
"There is, to some extent, a separate culture," SWIL copresident Jillian Waldman 'O6 said. "People in SWIL tend
to think they're geeks, they tend to think they're slightly
out of the mainstream."
Waldman described SWIL
the Swarthmore Warders
of Imaginative Literature as "a place for people with certain interests, for them to talk about those interests."
These interests include science fiction and fantasy novels, anime and gaming which in itself encompasses roleplaying games (called RPGs), video games and an assortment of board, card and parlor games.
"There's a bit of emphasis on gaming at the moment,"
Mai Pucik 'O6 said. Many Swillies play "Quake, Halo
just your standard video games." But perhaps more
intriguing are the non-technological games Swillies play.
"Settlers of Catan" and "Carcassonne" are popular board
games, and many members have sets.
SWIL is a safe space for those with less mainstream
interests. "The majority of people in SWIL are introverts," said Waldman. "They're mostly comfortable in a
small, close group of friends, which is what SWIL provides There is definitely an amount of pride associated
with it."

The fine art
of doodling
BY CLAIRE RUUD
cruudl@swarthmore.edu

Doodling is the art of geeks, so I'm told. We all do it
in the margins of our notes, over the titles of the articles
we read, and on scratch paper while we're chatting on
the phone. Perhaps you think your doodles are worthless scribbles. Well, read these doodle-facts and think
again.

people worthy of admiration. These, of
course, are the television stars.
Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle
Carteris) was always the ugly
stepchild on "Beverly Hills 90210."
She didn't have the money, cars or
clothes like her Peach Pit gang. Her
geeky glasses and bland khaki and

desired, and she frequently saw herself as inferior to the designer studs of
her classmates.

herself as the editor-in-chief of the
school newspaper, West Beverly Blaze,
and went all the way to the top of the
class to become valedictorian. After

An article titled "When Doodling Turns Deadly," in
Time, May 2, 2002, tells the story of an 11-year-old girl
who was suspended from her school in the Pittsburgh
suburbs for doodling stick figures of her teachers with
arrows through their heads on a returned vocabulary
quiz. She was angry about the D she had received, and I
guess her teachers had never heard of art therapy.
Some therapists encourage their reticent clients to
doodle and then talk about what they've expressed on
paper. Robert Harrison, a professor of psychology at
Boston University, suggests in the Boston University
Bridge that doodles might be a form of fantasy, revealing
the wishes and worries of the doodler. Look again at
those stars and squiggles in the margin of your notebook, they might reveal your innermost desires.
The Doodle Dictionary, by Nancy Nelson, was published in 1992 and is already out of print, but you can still

you the meaning of common doodles, kind oflike a book of

in the best interest of Swatties not to
take this approach in gaining cool
points. If you are a geek, maybe the
more productive approach is to buy
your prof lunch. In addition to being
cool, you might get an A in the class.

SWIL members, here's the geek for

drastically when her usually perky

goes without saying that a goody twoshoes becoming slightly naughty is a
plus, but to the point of destroying the

not so much. Still, nerdy
Willow received cool points for fighting for what she believed in and having a great time while doing so.
Last but not least is one of the reasons geeks still exist today. It is
because of this young man that the
essence of geekiness has been perpetuated throughout our lives, and he will
forever be the poster child for geekiness turned cool. Samuel Powers
(Dustin Diamond) has warmed his way
into our hearts as the lovable Screech
on "Saved by the Bell." Screech made
the rules for any geeky male to succeed
in the hellhole that is high school.
Think about it. He single-handedly
lived the dreams of hundreds of
teenage guys out there by winning the
heart (for at least one episode) of Kelly
Kapowski. His sexy way of describing
chemical bonds with the help of his
robot Kevin created a chemistry
between him and the cheerleader, even
if for a short time usurping the role of
Zack Morris. That takes talent. He
shared an "aww"-filled romance with
fellow geek Violet, won a dance contest, rescued his friends from trouble
numerous times and, best of all, went
to prom with his obsession, Lisa
Turtle. The one woman who never gave
..him the time of day and even developed an aUergic reaction to him finally
took pity on the curly-haired cutie and
swallowed her pride to make his high

"Doodling helps me release my id."
Aaron Smith 'O4
Doodles can be incredible works of art. Check out
Etch-a-Sketch.com for an online gallery of masterful doodle art created on the king of all doodle-machines. You
can also use an online Etch-a-Sketch there, read about
the toy's history, and play kiddie games.
Doodling may help smokers quit. A number of online
organizations,
including
quittobacco.org
and
stronghealth.com, recommend doodling to resist the
smoking habit.
Doodling may reduce stress. ABCnews.com reports in
a Feb. 2001 article titled "Calm Down, Right Now!" that
research shows that the monotonous activity of doodling
releases stress. All of us Swatties could benefit from a little more stress relief.
Doodling may be a great memory aid. In fact, in a paper
she gave in 1998, psychologist Wendy S. Van Dyk suggested that doodling was as good as note-taking. Participants
in her study took notes, doodled or simply listened during
a lecture. Afterward, the note-takers and doodlers scored
the same on tests on the information in the lectures, while
the listeners scored significantly lower. This is the ultimate justification for doodling. If more of us doodled,
maybe we'd all be getting A's.
I asked around to find out what our community
Khadijah White 'O4, said,
thinks about doodling.
"Everyone doodles, not just geeks. My doodles are usually spiky." When I asked her whether she thought this
reflected something about her personality or her mood,
she laughed, "What are you insinuating?"
Katie Robinson 'O4, on the other hand, said she wasn't
a doodler, though she showed her support for the practice with an enthusiastic, "Doodling's great!" I asked her
and other non-doodlers why, and the most often cited
reason for abstaining was fear. "I'm afraid the professor
will catch me," Chinwe Nwaneshiudu, 'O4 said.
Aaron Smith 'O4, an avid doodler, said, "Doodling
helps me release my id." I didn't ask Aaron whether his
doodles involved any oedipal fantasies with his mother,
and I don't want to know.
So for better grades, to quit smoking, or just to relax,
take out a pad, and just doodle.

Emiliano and Jon are sitting in Emiliano’s room at 10:18,
the night after their column is due, and they have one thing

written on the screen:
“Be one with the squirrel.”

weeks,, you pick up The Phoenix, your pants wet with anticipation to read their column, trembling as you turn through the
pages of your college newspaper to get to their witty prose. And
yet there is much you don't know about the authors of the column you are drooling over. If you knew more about them, would
you still prance over to Kohlberg bright and early on Thursday
mornings just to get a copy that is hot off the press? Wait, we'll

Yeah, these are things that maybe should have been done

the school? We have the answer:
Us.
And now we write the column, too. But here's the thing: We
don't really want to write this column. If we had wanted to, we
would have gotten a damn column in the first place. We are

sick and tired of inheriting their responsibilities once they

have realized how stupid they were in the first place to ever
take on responsibilities. Note: The song in the background is a
really bad version of "I Think We're Alone Now" coming out
of Emiliano's computer. Please make it stop.
Shout-out to the Kohlberg ladies. Peace out, Phoenix readers. Sorry to disappoint if you actually thought this was going
to be a funny column. Sometimes the truth hurts.

or not, Kelly has been dating Emiliano steady for at least two years. Tanya
doesn't really have any credibility but she was around and had just consumed enough substances to agree to begin the typing.
2. If you are wondering why it is that Emiliano hates Baja Fresh, it
is because they don't use lard in their cooking. This "makes it not real
Mexican food," according to Emiliano.

worthy of exploration. Two years
on, Matador has
provided

an

excellent opportunity for exploring or re-exploring it in the form of this
generously priced set. The DVD doesn't contain the
album in its entirety
the sprightly cover of "Brazil"
and the loungy closer "Nowhere" are both sadly AWOL
but the bulk of it is presented in 5.1 surround format
(hence the title.) Now, I usually think that kind of thing
is silly, but, if it makes sense to quintophonize any

music, it would be this album, whose myriad clicks and
pings and bells and whistles sound ready to burst out of
your speakers.
I don't ordinarily have much truck with music
videos, but this precise, evocative music is unusually
well suited to visual forms
of expression, and the clips
presented on-this DVD don't
disappoint. Like the album
itself, they are crisp and
lucid in conception but
uncannily affecting in execution, and they form a
cohesive unit, with recurring elements

The DVD conies packaged with an audio CD, "PM"
(for "point mixes"), with reworkings of "Point" done by
"humans." That is, as with the recent Dismemberment
Plan remix album, these were produced not by established "name" musicians, but fans. Unfortunately, it
doesn't work nearly as well as the DisPlan disc.
Although the remixers are for the most part respectful of

the sonic source material
tracks do all sound pretty nice
they largely fail to add
much worthwhile, and they almost categorically do
away with the simplicity and subtlety which made
"Point" so engaging.
The (suprisingly few) tracks that do refer to specific
songs, rather than just reworking the sounds of the

album as a whole, are at least inoffensive, but they're
hardly revelatory. A couple are unexpectedly abrasive
or seem to channel "Fantasma"s frenetic, kinetic, energy with a maddening lack of focus. Others, like attention-getting "MC Cat Genius BoomßassTic Rebomb,"
which pitchshifts "I Hate Hate" guitar squalls for a little minute before giving way to a bizarro skit and laconic hip-hop, are amusing but fairly devoid of replay
value.
Still, the package as a whole works as a loving tribute
to an unfairly ignored album, and, while it doesn't quite
edge out "Point" as my go-to recommendation for
Cornelius novices, it is worth investigation by those
who want more. As a final note, allow me to mention
that the package design is ingenious: The two discs sit
on a single rosette in a deep-set tray, eliminating the
need for those confusing, easily broken hinged trays on
two-CD jewel cases. Simple; elegant; brilliant. I'm not
sure if this idea has been used before, but I hope it will
catch on. (Um, yeah, like the album.)

A flash mob is when a large number of unaffiliated people meet at a
predetermined, public place at a predetermined time, perform a random,
predetermined action, and then disperse. In other words, it's sort of like

wars before the machine gun, except with fewer casualties.
Anyway, flash mobs can be a fun, short break from mundane life,

both for the participants and for confused and surprised bystanders.
You can organize a flash mob yourself with a bewildering array of
technological methods, from basic e-mail to Web sites that will send
automated cell phone text messages to the participants at specified
times. Check out flashmobs.com, xflashmobs.com and the delightfully

named cheesebikini.com.
And, as for me, I'm trying to start my own flash mob. So: If you're
here during break, head on into Philadelphia on next Friday, March 13,
and meet around the LOVE sculpture in JFK Plaza at the end of the
Benjamin Franklin Parkway. At exactly 4 p.m., begin singing "All You
Need Is Love" by The Beatles. Disperse.
Hey, at least it'll be an excuse to go into Philly on a Friday.

But tonight, people, this is it. The blood-soaked, disturbing movie "Battle Royale" will be shown tonight, in the
SCCS Media Lounge under Paces at 7:30 p.m. Thoughtprovoking and horrifying, this wild movie will get under

Geek society
It's always a bit strange listening to alumni recount
their Swarthmore memories. When we hear stories about
marching bands, daily dances and card tournaments in
the CRC after dinner, it's tough to maintain much of a
sense of continuity with the past. The old college community is simply not our college, and while the college's face
always changes slightly with every new four-year cycle,
we feel the overall shift in the past few decades has not
necessarily been for the better.

But the obvious changes
from a religious, Quaker
institution to a secular one, changes in the relative
importance of athletic and Greek cultures
are not the
ones that worry us. Rather, the subtler, more subjective
changes are the ones that give us pause. We can't help
but wonder, when reading about traditions like the
Hamburg Show or the May Day celebration, why such
traditions have passed into history. Compared to our sister school Bryn Mawr, our first-years remain relatively
unhazed, our alma mater unsung, our Firsts of May more
or less pole-free.
Individual groups such as ML residents, SWIL and the
rugby teams have their own supply of lore and traditions,
connecting them to past. Yet, descriptions of lifestyles
among the student body at large in our predecessors' days
have an alien tone to them.
While we have Screw Your Roommate, the Pterodactyl
Hunt and Sager, there's a sense of community and fun
from the past that seems dimmed in today's Swarthmore;
the confidence that there will be impromptu card games
to join after dinner, that anyone can walk into a dance
and find someone to dance with, that students can feel
free to poke fun at professors and each other in satirical
productions all seem to be gone. It's hard to imagine such
events happening at such scales in today's Swarthmore.
Today, walking through the dormitory halls, we see
groups of first-years who cannot pull themselves away
from their GameCubes and PlayStations. We see sophomores, juniors and seniors lock themselves in their
rooms for entire weekends, surfacing only to eat. We see
the same Paces parties every weekend for the entire year
with very few entertainment options thinking outside
the box.
Perhaps the feeling of community has decreased

because there's been a growing sense of personal drive.
The one trackable change that Swarthmore has shown in
recent years has been an increase in academic
competition. The recently released first-year survey
shows that over 60 percent of Swarthmore students averaged an A or an A+ in high school. Thirty-two years ago,
this number was below 40 percent. While an increased
level ofacademic intensity is certainly not a bad thing, as
Dean Gross has said in the past, it's easy for those of us
who've spent our lives building up our test scores and
resumes to lose sight of the simpler joys in life.
Students today have many resources their parents didn't, sources of instant information and entertainment
through the Internet and mass media. No one can deny
their value, yet too often it seems that these new
resources end up displacing a social life. It's the simple,
easily overlooked yet invaluable chances to bond and connect with each other that fall to the wayside.
Granted, we are geekier than our parents' generation.
We're more driven, hungrier for that brass ring, and
we're more plugged in to the opportunities and tools for
getting that ring. But we can learn something from the
simple joys of community and friendship that our generation may be leaving behind. The fun people make on
their own, bonding with their peers and enjoying each
other as people, has a value in life that can't be replaced
by any degree of achievement or learning.
If The Phoenix's Geek Chic issue demonstrates anything, it's that being a geek
having an idiosyncratic set
of interests and talents, being a free spirit who works
hard for one's own success
is a very different thing
from being antisocial. So unplug from that Xbox and
leave the books behind for a few hours on Friday and
Saturday. Though we probably won't resurrect the traditions of the past, we can go out and build community and
culture in our own way, be it with a router and some link
cable or a keg ofbirch beer or anything else we enjoy that
enables us to enjoy each other.

Actively engage living wage issue
Dear Editor:
As a member of the Swarthmore Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign, I am deeply committed to ensuring
that Swarthmore employees receive the respect and compensation they deserve. In the past few weeks, however, I
believe that the debate has shifted from the issues themselves to the tactics of the campaign. Moreover, I am con-

cerned that a general misrepresentation of the issues in the
Swarthmore media has contributed to the spread of misconceptions among students.

First, it is essential that the student body not equate the
living wage feedback process with the living wage campaign. This debate does not center on whether you agree
with the tactics of the campaign. It just doesn’t

and dis-

cussing the issues in terms of how they are advocated by a
group of students is tangential and unproductive and undermines the entire debate.
Secondly, understand that, while SLWDC doesn’t expect
everyone to agree with us, we do demand the right to
express our beliefs adamantly and share our knowledge
openly. Most importantly however, we ask that you educate yourself. This is a decision that affects our entire community, and it requires that everyone
students, as well
as the administrators charged with assessing feedback

be responsible for ensuring active engagement. This
means that administrators advertise and students attend.
This means that, if you are reading these words in The
Phoenix and don't understand the living wage debate, then
you have the responsibility to educate yourself. Let me

articulate this more directly: Ignorance is not an excuse
for apathy. As long as injustice persists, there is never an
excuse for apathy.
If you don't know where to begin, there are many individuals who are extremely knowledgeable and more than
willing to answer any questions you might have, including
the living wage campaign and the Ad Hoc Committee on a
Living Wage. Please realize that ensuring the implementation of a living wage is not just a concern of the campaign:
While SLWDC is extremely committed to this cause, we are
only one of many constituencies on and off this campus
working hard to ensure that all members of the Swarthmore
community are educated and invested, including staff, faculty, Student Council, administration and the Board of
Managers. As a member of the committee created to design
a community-wide feedback process, I can assure you that
we are committed to making sure all concerns and opinions
are heard in an open and democratic manner.

ban on dodge ball at recess. (Hey, someone was getting hurt.)
The two other contenders were neck-and-neck. There was nice-toeveryone Lucinda (um, right, pseudonym), and then there was super-

popular, steal-your-brownie-off-your-lunch-tray-and-stick-it-in-yourunderpants Anthony.
Election day rolled around. Anthony got 10 votes. Lucinda got
nine. I got two. Alas, the dictator reigned for the rest of the school
year. (Luckily, the governmental structure in Cardboardville was a
little less executive branch-heavy than some other polities I can
think of.)
Don't get me wrong
I'm proud that I ran. For the record, I nobly
accepted the superfluous yet honorable post offire chief a week later.
And Ralph should be proud, too. He's a spunky one, to say the least
after many a defeat, he's back and kicking and raring to dig progressives out of their Howard Dean mourning holes.
The length of Ralph's career could practically hold a candle to
Strom Thurmond's
and his list of accomplishments could surely
melt Strom's to a globby blob of mucusy wax. His work on environmental issues, workers' rights, poverty and health care has been vital
to progressive politics in the past 40 years. He helped establish the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and
campaign
Health Administration. Even now, the issues he raises
finance reform and a living wage, for example
serve to motivate
other politicians and concerned citizens to strive for higher ideals or
at least provide a reality check, letting us know that at least someone
who believes in that stuff is still around.
But a fabulous progressive track record has never a president

made. The overwhelming majority of liberal voters have one goal
that tops all this year: getting Bush out of office. Most of us no longer
think the two major parties look the same, or, if we do, we're beginning to realize that tiny little cracks-of-a-difference can actually affect
our lives and the lives (and deaths) of people around the world.
Of course Ralph has a right to run. This is a democracy, or, well,
it should be. But rights don't imply certain decisions. He's got the
right not to run, too. And with Ralph's record and dedication, he's a
valuable bid to be throwing away as a failed presidential candidate.
Couldn't he (not to mention millions of campaign dollars) do a whole
lot of good doing something else?
Throughout his career, Nader has accomplished his most important goals through community-level advocacy. He helped found the
State Public Interest Research Groups, the citizen reform groups
around the country that continue to work for consumer rights, environmental regulations and renewable energy by consistently winning policy changes. His watchdog organization, Public Citizen, has
expanded to a membership of 100,000, working to keep tabs on governmental corruption, health care and trade issues nationwide. This
is where we need Nader.
The real grassroots candidate, perhaps, is the one who decides not
the one who, ultimately, gives all the time and
to be a candidate
money that would have gone into a campaign to the people that are
the subject of all those (super-duper) hypothetical campaign promises. That grassroots candidate does not exist yet. Nader? No one else
is running!
So Ralph, I implore you. Reality always wins. Most of the country
does like dodge ball.
I know you've got a dream, but don't make real life more complicated for everyone else. There are ways to make a difference that
don't involve being president of the United States. If anyone knows
that, you do.
And if all else fails, maybe you can be fire chief, too.

flowing and frequently go out of
their way to accom-

students.
The fact that we have not sold out to the likes of
Sodexho-Marriott is a testament to the college's
commitment to quality dining.
This is not to say, however, that there are no
aspects of Swarthmore's dining service policies
that could be improved. The broadest of these policies could be loosely labeled "accountability."
There exists no clear method of inquiry or complaint within Sharpies or Tarble. A few weeks ago,
the moo goo gai pan labeled "chicken" had actually
been made with the previous Sunday's leftover
turkey. When I inquired as to whether this was
actually the case, the employee behind the counter
tasted a piece, smiled, told me that "it sure does
taste like turkey" and went back to what he was
doing.

At no point was the sign changed to

"turkey."
The accountability issue is broader than reflected in this anecdote. There is a napkin board at the
top of Sharpies and supposedly a Dining Services
Committee, yet we have no way of knowing if
improvements have resulted from either. For
instance, Sharpies' early closing has historically
been an issue of contention. Though Sharpies is supposed to remain open until 7:15 on weekdays, food
begins disappearing as early as 6:30. Athletes whose
practices run past that time are thus limited in their

options and often left dissatisfied with their dinners.
This issue has been addressed in the past, yet
Sharpies seems to start cleaning up ever earlier as
the semester progresses. While one could argue
that those athletes could eat in Tarble, the Tarble
offerings could hardly be considered healthy, especially for those trying to improve and maintain
their physiques.
That said, Tarble has its own set of problems.
Foremost among these is the inability of students
to use more than two meal equivalencies in a given
meal period. If Dining Services offers students the
option of using meal credits to purchase sodas and
snacks, there is no reason to put a limit on the use
of that option. In a time in which the college is
entangled in debate about whether it is morally
obligated to pay its staff a living wage, why is it not
obligated to allow students the use of meal credits
that they have already paid for? Given that students are forced to purchase a meal plan at a price
set by the college, greater flexibility in their ability to use that meal plan is not an unreasonable
request.

If a Swattie has not skipped any meals during
the week, he may find himself at Tarble on a
Saturday night with only one meal credit left.
While this Swattie will not go hungry, he could
hardly be considered well fed. For instance, a
cheese steak, French fries and a soda seem like an
adequate dinner. It is a shame, however, that a
meal credit alone will not buy all three of these.
Should the Swattie go without beverage or side
dish? (This notion is implicitly admitted in the fact
that many varsity athletes are given allowances in
addition to their meal credits to spend at Tarble
after games. Club sport athletes are afforded no
such luxury, but that is for another column.)
Admittedly, Dining Services is tasked with using
its ever more limited resources to satisfy widely varied demands. For the most part, those resources are
used effectively and students are well nourished.
Still, the above outlined issues are ones that have an
actual impact on students. For the administration to
address them would have a truly positive effect on
the quality of life at Swarthmore.

Computers and the network are a
part of our daily existence, a
broad swathe of the fabric of our
lives. And, barring the extremely

unexpected, they're only going to

become more so. A LAN party like
the one that the Swarthmore
Coalition for the Digital Commons
put on last Friday represents a
primordial version of digital communities of the future
communities in which all of us will participate, like it or not. Even the
Internet as we know it now is only
a shadow of what's to come.
SCDC's mission is to make the

case for a freer, more open, more
participatory structure to these
communities, a structure similar

who's really, really into something obscure or technical (e.g.,
"my roommate is an indie-rock

think this is too much of a distinc-

The point is, as more and more

For a century we've been passive

we've sat staring into a long, oneway media tube simply because
there was no other way. A LAN

this is no longer has to be the case
there are no producers or consumers, only participants.
I don't want to sound too optimistic, though. Technology alone

Farewell to meaningless 'Sex'
BY KHADIJAH WHITE

kwhitel@swarthmore.edu

I should have been happy I was invited. It was the
very last episode of "Sex and the City," and, despite
my past antagonism toward the show, my friend had

decided to give me one more chance to see it with a
group of her closest friends. I was determined to
behave. I would pretend I had never seen Samantha
pull a pick out of her pocketbook to comb her afro wig
while she referred to Charlotte, Carrie and Miranda
as her "sistahs." I would act like this pseudo-feminist
show that hides under a bunch of misconstrued and
ill-contrived notions of female liberation (not to mention race) was simply not real, that millions of
Americans were not watching and appreciating this
horribly unrealistic and somewhat distressing portrayal of American life.
If you can't tell, I failed
miserably.

It might have been the

passing remark about "buy

a Guatemalan child for
$100." Or the fact that
Charlotte expected a redneck couple to give her
their child in exchange for
a free trip to New York. Her problem, of course, is
solved when she leaves the country to join the brand
new American fad of adopting Asian children.
Meanwhile, the most challenging part of Samantha’s
chemotherapy was a lack of libido, and Carrie was
realizing that giving up her friends, career and homeland for her boyfriend was not as fulfilling as she

thought it would be.
I just couldn’t handle it. Despite loving memories
of season two, I realized I could no longer enjoy this
show. It hurt to watch my extremely intelligent
friends drool over the lives of characters I would
never want to meet, much less know. How could they
not recognize the invariably oppressive images of gender, relationships and, yes, even class and ignore all

of these things solely for the sake of entertainment?
How in the world could a bunch of progressive, educated people want to live lives so obsessively selfish,
ignorant and exclusive?
Now, my friends reason, this show claims to be
a show about fun,
nothing more than what it is
fashion, lots of money and even more sex. Nothing
real, nothing substantial and definitely nothing worth
discussing. So what, there’s the occasional stereotype
it’s all about the fantasy. Yet here lies the problem.
Ultimately, as Carolyn Sha ’O4 commented, “The danger of [“Sex and the City”] lies not in the displaying of
these injustices but in our passive acceptance of them
as norms and even ideals.”
So, I say a final farewell to "Sex and the City" and
the feelings of betrayal that emerge every time I
watch the show. Perhaps Carrie and the man who has
repeatedly been emotionally abusive, dishonest and selfish toward

Technological Misfit

surprised Tuesday morning
by their computer beeping in
tune to the Netsky virus,
which (aside from spreading itself) triggered the PC speaker
to beep in random tones 6-9 a.m., March 2.
These things are a little bit inexplicable. The recent viruses don't actually do anything more than annoy. Or do they?
The recent “Cone” worm spreads itself like many other
worms and adds in a desperate plea from political dissidents
in Iran to your hard drive. The Welchia worm replaces
Windows help files with a bizarre message about Japan in
World War 11. Thrilling. The computer virus is now a form of
political expression.
Well, perhaps I’m being a little alarmist. I don’t expect to
see a living wage virus show up anytime soon. But viruses,
cleverly programmed, have certainly shown themselves to be
remarkably capable of reaching a large swath of Internet
users, often with devastating speed. In past, the most “practical” (and I use the word loosely) use of viruses was the denialof-service attack: ordering all the infected computers to make
requests on a certain Web site at a particular day and time
and thus crashing the target site. (These are almost invariably aimed at Microsoft or SCO, a company that insists it
owns the copyright on Linux.) I wonder how long it will be

until someone writes a virus that pops up “Bush for
President” or “Free Tibet” or whatever causes the author
decides to champion.
It seems only a matter of time, considering the rate at
which viruses “evolve.” The analogy to biological viruses
seems particularly apt; viruses often have a dozen or more
different forms floating about the Internet at any one time.
Symantec Corporation keeps a public list of all known viruses; according to their records, 10 variants of the Beagle worm
are now known, five of the Netsky, and four of Welchia. The

venerable MyDoom has just hit seven. It’s not precisely
known whether these varations come from the original
designer of the virus-making improvements or other programmers adding on their own variations, but the latter
seems more likely.
With viruses changing so rapidly (Symantec recorded 19
new viruses in the last week of February), it seems unlikely
that we’ll ever be able to quash them completely. On the other
hand, at the moment, viruses tend to rely on e-mail attachments (although people may remember the Blaster worm
from this summer, which exploited a security breach in
Windows to run itself without one). This limitation means
that “Internet hygiene” may be prove to be the best way to

limit viruses. Know what attachments to open, and which not

to, and you’ll keep your computer virus-free.
That said, viruses are here to stay, and we’d best get used
to them. Personally, I’m still waiting for the Bush virus.

Today is the one-week anniversary of the
destruction of the infamous Steve Bartman
baseball. It was this little ball, and not Alex
Gonzalez's fielding, the nonexistent Cubs'
bullpen, or sucking too much to close out a
3-1 series lead, that came between the Cubs

and the World Series. That means now is a
great time to take a look at some of the

sports superstitions and rituals that exist at

Swarthmore and across the nation.
We all know Yankee fans don't need to be
superstitious, because they have money. As
Babe Ruth once put it: "I have only one
superstition. I make sure I touch all the
bases when I hit a home run."
But, for the rest of us out there who can't
afford to buy every win, we need to find legitimate ways to rise above the competition.

Even some of the greatest athletes have rituals. Michael Jordan wore his Tar Heel blue
North Carolina shorts underneath his game
shorts for every game. Because no Swat athletes have access to Jordan's briefs, we find
other ways to get up for the big game.
Amy Stocker 'O7, a volleyball player, said
the team would say the same cheer before
every game when it was on a winning streak.
She said she thought superstitions and rituals helped people focus on the game at hand.
Her roommate, Zsaleh Harivandi 'O7, disagreed. "Superstitions are very stupid," she
said. "They're for the weak-minded."
But who could call someone who's a successful major-league relief pitcher, one of
the most stressful mental jobs in sports,
weak-minded? Turk Wendell, a veteran
relief pitcher for the Colorado Rockies, has
pitched in the big leagues for over 10 years
and has a career ERA of 3.85. Still, he knows
better than to rely on skill alone to win. One

March 4, 2004

of the strangest players in baseball, Wendell
hops over the first- and third-base lines
every time he runs on the field. In between
innings, he brushes his teeth, presumably
making them easier to find once Barry
Bonds knocks them out in response to
Wendell's comment last week that Bonds
obviously used steroids. Despite his occupation, you have to question the intelligence
of a guy who publicly insults a 230-pound
juiced bodybuilder.
Swarthmore athletes, however, are probably a little smarter than their counterparts
at the pro level. Take, for instance, soccer
player and distance runner Vernon
Chaplain 'O7, who follows in the footsteps of
baseball greats Jim Palmer and Wade Boggs

by insisting on the same meal before

every

one of his games and races. His choice of
bagels is probably a more high-energy
choice than Palmer's mandatory pre-game

pancakes drenched in syrup.
For students, these superstitions extend
beyond the playing field, as well. Some
think that not changing clothes possesses
you with some power to make your team
play better. Tom Madore 'O6 wore the same
thing for almost

a week when the Red Sox

Championship Series. Fellow Boston fan
Steve St. Vincent 'O7 wore a homemade
Pedro Martinez jersey for the duration of
the playoffs. They think it helped the Sox
almost beat the Yankees and make the
World Series, which is about as good as it
gets for a Boston fan. I think it just made
them smell bad. But what do I know? Maybe
if I'd worn my A's hat for a few extra days,
I wouldn't have had to hand over my $2O to

Buzzards set for season
BY COLTON BANGS
cbangsl@swarthmore.edu

The coming of spring brings
another season of rugby for
Swarthmore's Evil Buzzards. The
squad is preparing for upcoming
contests with teams from the

University
of
Pennsylvania,
Widener, Ursinus, Susquehanna
and Franklin and Marshall, as well
as a tournament in Washington,
D.C. Captain Jon Fombonne 'O5
believes that with the number of
large, athletic players available,
every game is winnable if the group
can stay in shape and play hard.
The revamped Swarthmore side
includes newcomers Aaron Strong
'O6, Jonathan Augat 'O7, Andrew
McKay 'O7, John Egan 'O6, and Aaron
Hollander 'O7. Despite losing several
great athletes to other sports, including baseball and track, the Evil
Buzzards expect to erase large losing deficits experienced in the fall
with the help of its rookies. Those
lost for the season include Matt
Williams 'O4 (track) who was expected to reunite with Erik Munroe 'O4
for the unstoppable WilliamsMunroe tandem, Dan Chamberlain
'O4 (baseball), Brandon Carver 'O4,
who was also expected to return,
and Tim Lang 'O4.
So far, preseason has been successful for the Buzzards. Fombonne
cites strong performances from
Tyler Strombom 'O6, and Kaena
Horowitz 'O6 who is expected to play
an MVP-like role for Swarthmore
after finally learning to run
straight.

This is the culminating season
for Ed
Sheldon 'O4, Michael
DeFillipo 'O4, Kenny Oh 'O4 and
Munroe, all key players for the
Swarthmore side.
The forwards are expected to

consist of the three rows as follows.

The front row will be both strong
and mobile with the likes of
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, Horowitz,
and Daniel
Sheldon,
Strong
Reinganum 'O6. Captain Randy
Goldstein 'O5 will team up with

Strombom, who has developed into
a powerful player recently, to make
up the experienced second row. In

the

back row, the maniacal
Brendan Bond ’O5, coming back
from an injury, will join DeFillipo,
Alex Black ’O4 and Peter Brennan
’O7 to complete the forward line.
Much of the backline will be
decided in the coming weeks. Those
expected to play include halfbacks
Oh and Fombonne who have played
together for several years, and fullback TeVye Kelman ’O6, who has
picked up the game of rugby very
quickly for the Buzzards. The backline will also certainly rely on the
punching
power
of Brandt

Rakowski ’O6 and the speed of
Munroe. Wings will be plentiful
with strong showings at the position so far having been made by
Augat, Egan and Dan Forman ’O7.
The team is expected to be
coached by Fred Gruhler whose
location is unknown, although
Fombonne and Kelman believe him
to be “captured by South American

paramilitaries.”
Although the team has

Because the backline relies a lot

the backs and achieving a rhythm
between them, its success will rely
mainly on the commitment of
potential backs. Black, impressed
by the success of the team in the
fall season, expects an excellent

Time to stop juicing up
Though March has come in like a lamb across most of the country, the lion
is rearing its ugly head in Florida and Arizona. A decade removed from the devastating strike in 1994, and only two years after the game came ominously close
to another work stoppage, baseball is again in the limelight of American news.
This time the issue is not money but steroids, a topic that President Bush highighted in his State of the Union several weeks ago. The President included this
issue in the speech because he, like any baseball fan, wants to know if the players whom we support have grown to massive sizes due to illegal substances.
There has been widespread speculation over the past several years that steroid
use has been a dark side of baseball and a driving factor behind the recent home
run binge. Players targeted for using the illegal drugs naturally have been those
who’ve been most successful. Ten years ago if you lined me up next to Sosa and
Bonds, I wouldhave arguably been the bulkiest of
the three, but not anymore. While I have refused
to shoot up with steroids in hopes of furthering
my career, my two professional counterparts
have seen their bodies double in size (by the way,
imagine that outfield, from left to right: Bonds,
Davis, Sosa. We could hit 130 homers a year).
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Both Bonds and
Sosa attribute their new massive biceps to hours
of hard work in the weight room, and both have
adamantly denied using steroids. Last year Sosa
showed support for steroid testing by saying he
would be the first in line to take the test, yet when
Rick Reilly pressed the slugger to actually take a
test, Sosa claimed he didn’t want to be singled
out.

On Tuesday Bonds was named, along with
Gary Sheffield, Jason Giambi and three others,
in an alleged steroid-distribution ring centering
around the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative.
Supposedly, Bonds’ personal trainer gave the
players steroids and human growth hormones, but the three players insist only
that they have never used steroids. These are the most serious accusations of
steroid use against players to date, and they represent what could only be the

Men's lacrosse fell to Stevens Institute of Technology, 14-6, during the Garnet's home opener.

Garnet fall to Stevens Tech
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND

aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team fell in
its season opener last weekend against the
Stevens Institute of Technology 14-6, inauspiciously beginning the year 0-1 as it prepares to
take on non-conference opponent, Goucher, this
Saturday in Maryland.
Against Stevens, the Garnet Tide slipped
behind early as the Ducks jumped out to a quick
five-goal lead. Tech forged ahead and took a commanding 8-2 lead by halftime. The deficit proved
to be too much for the Tide, as six more tallies
by Stevens were enough to cement the 14-6 victory.
"We played a good team; Stevens is ranked
27th in the nation," head coach Pat Gress said.
"And also, we didn't play particularly well. We
started tense, and offensively we didn't get into
our sets the way we'd like to."
Despite the loss, there were several bright
moments for Swarthmore, as captain and attacker Joe DeSimone 'O4 netted the squad's lone two
scores in the first half, while midfielders John
Cleaver 'O4, Tim Chryssikos 'O5, Matt Perez 'O6
and Jay Charles 'O7 all chipped in with second
half tallies for the Garnet Tide. Chryssikos and
midfielder Ryan McKenna 'O7 each notched an
assist in Saturday's contest as well.
"The game gave us a little perspective,"
DeSimone said. "We just need to get everyone
on the same page offensively, and we got a lot
of new guys, but I think we're on our way
there."

20

Goalkeeper Steven Isbister 'O4 also posted a
save total with 21 stops in the net for
the Garnet, allowing the 14 goals and withstanding a withering 56 total shots from the Stevens
offensive attack.
"Steve Isbister did great in net," Cleaver
said. "He played with a lot of heart and made a
lot of saves while facing a lot of pressure. We
just hope to help him out more next game
because he's been playing great back there."
Swarthmore will face off against the
Goucher Gophers Saturday in their first contest
away from home before heading to Orlando,
Fla. for spring break. The Tide will face both
Drew and Susquehanna in non-conference
action on their trip.
Despite their setbacks Saturday, the team
remains confident heading into the break. "We
made lots of little mistakes, beginning-of-theyear kind of things like failed clears, dropped
passes and other things that we can definitely
fix up this weekend," Cleaver said. "Goucher is
a good team just like Stevens, but we've learned
from first game, and I think we're ready to in
there and get the win."
The trip to Florida promises to give the team
a chance to focus on lacrosse and test itself
against similar opponents in both Drew and
Susquehanna. "It's always a fun trip, and all the
guys are excited to be playing in the warm
weather, and it's a good chance to focus on playing lacrosse," Gress said. "We also get to play
two games against teams that are at our level,
so they'll be competitive and a good challenge
for us."

tip of the iceberg on an explosive topic that is sure to linger.
Steroid use is not recent in baseball. Former National League MVP Ken
Caminiti has claimed that over half of all major leagues use steroids, while 4040 man Jose Canseco has threatened to publish a book, with names, indicating
that number is closer to 85 percent (by the way, did any of you see Jose at the
Dodgers’ open tryout on Monday? Talk about out of shape, not to mention a terrible swing. The guy hit more pop-ups during his two rounds of BP than the
entire Swarthmore baseball team hit last year!). One thing to note: Canseco’s
words come from a player who spent more than two months last summer in
prison for engaging in steroid use that violated his parole. Whether the accusations are true or not, they are still sobering to hear.
Last week Turk Wendell stated what was on everybody’s mind when, referring to Bonds, he said “I mean, obviously he did it. [His trainer] admitted to giving steroids to baseball players. He just doesn’t want to say his name. You don’t
have to. It’s clear just seeing his body.” Teammate Danny Neagle followed up by
noting that “It is a pretty good coincidence that some of the names that are linked
to them are the guys that are the big, massive, overmuscular looking guys.”
Slowly, more players are starting to come out of the shadows and say publicly
what every major leaguer has known for years: that steroid use is prominent.
With fresh accusations and evidence implicating many major leaguers, the
Commissioner’s Office and baseball need to take steps to get steroids out of the
game before America’s Pastime is further tarnished. Last year random steroid

testing, with no consequences, took place, and five to seven percent of players
tested positive. This year mandatory steroid testing is in effect (I wonder if testing will be done like it was on Playmakers. Imagine Sheffield getting his urinary tracts flushed out, a la DH, before the Piss Man pays him a visit. What if
the doctor screwed up and gave the right fielder Giambi’s old urine, which had
just been drained an hour before? Talk about bad news), but such testing is
labeled by John Smoltz as nothing more than a “smoke screen.” Will things
change because of this testing? Probably not.
Major League Baseball has also banned personal trainers from team weight
rooms, clubhouses and dugouts. The move has drawn the ire of Giambi and
Bonds, who selfishly whined, “Do they want to pay millions of dollars for a guy
like me to sit on the bench because we don’t have the right care? That’s the
question needing to be answered.” Well, I’ll answer the question for you, Barry:
yes, they do. For the integrity of the game.
Until everybody is sure that steroids have been cleansed from the game,
accusations will linger over players’ heads as they continue to hit absurd numbers of home runs. But steroids or no steroids, this fan’s love of the game has
not diminished. One can only hope that the steroid scandal that is rocking baseball will not tarnish the image of these great athletes through the eyes of Little
Leaguers and other children who look up to these stars as ambassadors of the
game the youngsters enjoy. One day these youths will be the future of baseball,
and only by setting a good example now and staying away from illegal substances can the game continue to flourish in the future, when the Little
Leaguers of today become the All-Stars of tomorrow.
