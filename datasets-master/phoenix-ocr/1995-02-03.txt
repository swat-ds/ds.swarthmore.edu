Swat to Shred "Scientific"
Posture Photos of Alums
by Elizabeth Weber

with Eric Pakurar
and Kathleen Lawton
According to the cover story in the
January 15 edition of The New York
Times Magazine, some 27,000 pic-

of nude alumni from prestigious universities, including members of Swarthmore's class of '5l,
tures

are currently

filed away in a
Smithsonian basement. Yale Univer-

sity recently negotiated the return
and subsequent shredding of the pictures of its alumni.
Swarthmore plans to take similar
action: "We're going to ask the
Smithsonian to shred them," President Al Bloom said. "[They have]
agreed with other universities..., so I
expect that they will accommodate
our request as well."
Bloom also said the College is still
unsure of the existence of the pictures of S warthmore alumni, and only
two letters have come in so far from

alumni inquiring about The New York
Times Magazine article.
The photographs originated in routine freshmen physicals, where all
incoming first-year students were
examined to see if they had problems
with posture. Swarthmore participated in the practice of photographing frosh, though only with females,
according to Eleanor K. "Pete" Hess,
whobecame director of women's athletics in 1965. "I came here in '57,
and we were definitely taking pictures then.... Every student who came
here had to have an examination."
Virginia Rath, director of women's
athletics from 1931 to 1965, also
remembers taking the pictures "All
the years I taught there
for the
benefit of judging posture and [to
decide] which people should be
singled out to receive posture training.... At first they were just silhouettes, but later they were real pic-

BCC Marks Anniversary with Art Exhibit, Festival
By Erik Huneke

In commemoration of Black His-

tory Month and the Black Cultural
Center's 25th anniversary, the

Swarthmore African-American Student Society (SASS) has organized
events including "Blacks in theArts,"
an exhibit and lecture series that
started last Friday, and Harambe, a
multicultural festival planned for
May, SASS leaders said.

exhibit will feature a slide presentation and lecture.Her exhibit will
continue until March 10. The series
will conclude with Don Camp's photography, to be shown in both the List
Gallery and the BCC from March 17
to March 31.
Seth Harvey '97, treasurer of
SASS, explained that by "using the
Black Cultural Center as a snowplace for African American art, we

SASS leaders hope to use the
BCC's 25th anniversary as an
opportunity to showcase black
culture, heritage, and traditions.
"Blacks in the Arts," which will
run until March 31, highlights the
work of three Philadelphia-area African-American artists. James
Brantley, the first artist in the show,
discussedhis paintings at the exhibit's
opening on January 27. His works
will remain on display in the BCC
until February 17. The opening on

and traditionsthat
are embodied in
the Black Cultural Center."
Maxine Proctor, Director of
the Black Cultural Center, agreed,
saying thatwhilethe center "has been
very good for students who feel they
need a safe space, so I don't thinkthat
should go away," she supports programs that will make the center "useful in educating more people about
our culture" and "helping us to understand each other better."
Harambe, a festival whose name
means "togetherness" in Swahili, will

further the goal of learning about
others' cultural, political, religious,
sexual, and gender identities, hopes
Rebeccah Bennett '96, President of
SASS. Though started by SASS, the
effort to plan Harambe involves other
students, faculty, and staff, she said.
Bennett hopes that establishing
Harambe as a yearly tradition will
contribute to communication among

people of different backgrounds.

Harambe committeemembers will
plan for the May 6
extravaganza, which will include poetry readings, musical performances,
andbooths representing interests and
activities such as health consciousness, voterregistration, and arts, crafts
and foods from many different cultures. Dorms will be encouraged to
set up booths withactivities like facepainting for children, since people of
all ages from surrounding communities will be encouraged to attend. The
festival will be held on ParrishBeach
and Mertz Lawn.
A panel discussion featuring movie
directors Spike Lee and JulieDash on
February 9 will lead into a film series
planned for March or April, said
Veronica Green '95, Vice-President
of SASS. "Some of [the films]
explore...how race is portrayed in
meet weekly to

themedia, and others deal withblackwhite relations," Green explained.

Proctor would also like to create
an exhibit "showcasing black memorabilia" owned by members of the
Swarthmore community. According
toBennett, this could form part of an
African Folklore Day, including
dancers, drummers, slide shows, and
storytelling, that is tentatively scheduled for March 25.
In an effort to promote further
dialogue among variousmembers of
theCollege community, SASS members are planning a series of workshops to facilitate informal discussions about race. The first workshop
is tentatively scheduled for Monday, February 13.

Commenting on future plans for
the BCC, Bennett said she hopes
that in coming years the BCC will
also focus on "reinstating partnerships" with outside communities.
Proctor hopes to enhance the BCC
library with a film collection and to
open more BCC events to the entire
Swarthmore community. Proctor
added that she believes "Black History Month should not just be celebrated right here at the BCC, but
elsewhere on campus" as well as
throughout the entire year.

Government May Cut Aid to College Students
By Jennifer Barager

dents] pay at market interest rates?'"
saidLaura Talbot, Director ofFinan-

Republican plans to cut back government spending may pose a threat
to federally-funded student aid pro-

cial Aid. "The loan will continue to
exist for students [including 610 at
Swarthmore], but at a less favorable
rate."
Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich has also attacked the national service program AmeriCorps,
promising to thwart upcoming attempts to increase its budget and size
in hopes of eliminating it altogether.
Talbot said that many Swarthmore
students have already participated in
the program, which helps students
earn scholarships and money to repay loans and mortgages, since its
inception in 1993.
Perhaps the most extensive proposal, submitted by the House Republican Conference in early January, would cut off most aid to legal
immigrants whohave not yet become
citizens. The affected programs

grams including Stafford Loans, Pell
Grants, and college work-study funding, according to recent reports in
The Chronicle ofHigher Education.
Though the College will likely continue its commitmentto meeting demonstrated financial need, students at
Swarthmore and around the nation
may find themselveswithfewer good
options for paying tuitionbills.
One of themain proposed changes
is an increase in the interest rate on
Stafford Loans. Currently, students
who demonstratefinancial need and
receive aid through the Stafford program enjoy a fixed, federally-subsidized interest rate of 7.3%.
"There is a group in Washington
that says, 'Why not have them [stu-

would include Pell Grants, Federal
Family Education Loans, Education
Department fellowships for graduate
students, and work-study funds,
among others.While it is anticipated
that these cuts will mostly impact
schools in states with large immigrant populations—such as California, New York, Texas, and Florida—
Talbot said many Swarthmore students will be affected as well.
"We have a diverse population,"
she explained. "We have families that
immigrated to the U.S. 10years ago,
two years ago—they are permanent

residents with all the obligations and
privileges of U.S. citizens."
Though it is clear that students
may soon be coming to Swarthmore
with fewer federal dollars, Talbot
wants to reassure them that the College will try its best to make up the
difference. "I've been here for 17
years, and I've seen federal money

increase and decrease continually.
These are trends that we will have to
budget for in the future, and we plan
to continue to do so."
She explained that in the past,
Swarthmore has increased its own
scholarship and loan funding to balance federal cuts. Talbot expects that
schools with smaller endowments
and less commitment to providing
financial aid will expect students to
bear more of the burden of the cuts.

According to Owen Redgrave, building materials which had been left in
Old Tarble caught fire.
"A small area in the floor and the
whole stairwell were on fire," said
S warthmore Fire CompanyChiefCris
Hansen. "It burned down to the floor
underlayment."
"The fire was theoretically out
within ten minutes of our arrival but
we declared it under control after
checking for extension in the stairs,
mezzanine," Hansen said. Extension
is afirefighting term for any smoldering or flames hidden in the walls,
ceilings or other enclosed areas.
Hansen said the "very dense smoke
from the floor to the cathedral ceiling" made checking for extension difficult.
Springfield, South Mediaand Garden City fire departments and an ambulance unit were dispatched to help
Swarthmore deal with the blaze.
Hansen said the other companies
mostly helped get smoke out of the
building and search for extension because "the fire was put out so quickly."
"It was not one of the great fires of

the world," said President Al Bloom.
The fire was officially classified as
"suspicious," and the Delaware
County Fire Marshall's office is actively investigating the causes of the
fire. According to Schall, a classification of "suspicious" means that the
fire "could have been set, as opposed
to starting on its own." Redgrave said
that his office could not comment on
possible causes of the fire at this time.
Good contraction and metal (instead of wooden) framing in the wall
behind the fire kept the flames somewhat boxed in, but "if we had been
called twenty minutes later, the fire
would have been considerably big-

ger."

Twelve years ago, a fire in Old
Tarble had more of a head start. Early
on the morning ofSeptember 16,1983
firefighters responded to what The
Phoenix described as "a blazing inferno." The first Old Tarble fire had
the help of a lot of gasoline (or a
similar substance) and consumed most
of what was then the student center.
The first fire was decided an arson
job three days after it happened, but
officials said they could not say when
they thought the current investigation
would conclude.
Tarble, built in 1906, had originally been used as a library and was
converted to a student center in the

late 1960'5. Ever since the first fire,
the building has remained unoccupied save for haunted houses and storing student packages at the beginning
of the fall semester.

The CollegeBowl team intimidated the competition at the University of Pennsylvania's
College Bowl Tournament last weekend.The
team showcased its knowledge of what many
people would consider useless trivia at the
year's largest college bowl tournament, competing against 64 teams from 38 schools. On
their way to winning their bracket, team members Patrick Friel '96, Elizabeth Christian '97,
Jeff Lockman '9B, and Daniel Berenberg '96
beat all their opponents, including top-ranked
Maryland, on the first day of competition.
The team members attributed their less auspicious 2-6 record on the second day ofcompetition to a series ofunfortunate travel problems
Friday night. "We didn't have as much gas as
we thought we did," recalled Friel. "We were
stranded in front of a hospital and after two
hours finally ended up at the Penguin Palace
Eatery. This led to scrapple."
After getting just a few hours' sleep, the
squad arrived at the tournament and went on to
place seventh overall in their bracket. According to Berenberg, the squad's performance at
Penn indicates favorable prospects for the
team' s future this year."We expect to be among
the top three teams in the region," he said.
TeampresidentDavid Lewis 97 said that "there

The College Bowl team is also an active
force on campus. On Sunday, Lewis organized
an intramural competition, in which six fourperson teams competed in several 30-minute
rounds. Winners Friel, Berenberg, Lockman,
and Arthur Krause '97 will be considered for
membership on the regional team, which will
compete for a spot at Nationals on February 25.
They were also awarded eight scratch-and-win
lottery tickets for their efforts.
The College Bowl format emphasizes the
ability to think fast on topics ranging from
science to history to pop culture. Thus it is
helpful for a team to have what Lewis calls
"total coverage," or a variety of people who
each have a lot of knowledge in one specific
area. In addition, teamwork and camaraderie
play an important role on successful squads.
The Swarthmore team in particular has a reputation for eccentricity, due largely to Patrick
Friel's tradition of dying his hair before every
tournament.

Anyone interested in contributing their own
store of trivia knowledge or eccentricity to
further bolster-Swat's reputation is welcome to
attend the team's weekly practice sessions,
which are held on Tuesdays at 8 P.M. in Trotter
basement.

The Swarthmore Christian Fellowship, a
non-denominationalgroup of about 60 students, wtD sponsor an outreach program of
speakers and discussion of the Christain faith
next week. The schedule features lectures focusing on racial and women's issues, as well as
testimonials by Swarthmore students. There
will be many opportunities for members ofthe
student body to react to the week's activities.

Dozens
Succumb to
Mock Flu
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

Dozens of students fell ill this week after
both a stomach virus and a flu-like virus spread
around campus, but staff members at Worth
Health Center said there was not much they
could do to help those who got sick.
"There's nothing we can do for viral infections—just give them Advil and force fluids,"
explained Carol Ronan, a nurse at Worth.
Flu shots cannot prevent the flu-like illness
because, while its symptoms resemble those of
influenza, the two diseases are not the same.

S 011 N<D.

Only thirty students suffering from the flu-

like or stomach viruses have visited Worth,
said Ronan, but she speculated that many more
probably stayed in their dorm rooms.
"I've heard from the students that whole
halls are sick. But they don't see us. Once one
[student] finds out what to do, they can all do

it."
Students who are already sick could contract
more serious illnesses if they try to keep up
with their schoolwork and don't rest, Ronan
warned.

"Some of thekids are so uptight about their
schoolwork that they don't want to go to bed
and do what they're told, and then they get a
bacterial infection on top of the virus," she said.
Courtney Clark '9B said she fell far behind
on her academic work after a high fever forced
her to spend last weekend in Worth. Fortunately, she added, professors respected her
need for time to catch up.
"There was only one class that had something that was immediately due, so I talked to
[my professor] and he gave me an extension. I
think that because so many people are sick,
they don't think you're blowing it off. They
really believe you have the flu," Clark said.
According to Ronan, the number of people
who have been sick so far this year is higher
than average, but not nearly as high as two
years ago, when all of Worth's beds were filled
with students stricken by a stomach virus.

Corrections
In an article last week on a vigil for murdered
women's health clinic workers, The Phoenix
incorrectly identified the Elizabeth Blackwell
Health Center for Women and misspelled the
name of NARAL, a national abortion rights
organization. Also, the same article erroneously reported that 10 to 15 Pro-Choice Task
Force members volunteer as escorts at Philadelphia clinics. In fact, 35 students are clinic
escorts, said Herrin Hopper, a leader of the
Task Force.

Public Radio Faces Possible Loss of Federal Dollars
By Michael Tomko

Do you spend your Saturday evenings out on
prairie with Garrison Keillor? Or do you
receive your daily dose of the outside world
when you tuneto news programs such as "Fresh
Air" or "All Things Considered"?These public
radio programs, and the listening habits of
those who enjoy them, may be altered by sweeping changes now emanating from the nation's
capital.
The new Republican-controlled Congress
has targeted funds that support public broadcasting as a potential source of budget cuts, and
public radio stations across the country now
face the possibility of losing the federally funded
portions of their budgets. In an effort to maintain the same level of broadcasting quality on
the radio dial, WHYY 90.9 FM and other public stations havereacted to the potential cuts by
launching media and lobbying campaigns and
by looking for funding alternatives.
WHYY, one of the public radio stations that
reach the stereos of Swarthmore College, currently has a budget totaling $2O million. Approximately 9% of that comes from federal
funds. If the federal funding is cut, WHYY may
have to raise more money from individual listeners (who currently provide 50% of budget)
and state and corporate contributions (40% of
budget).
Art Ellis, the Promotions Director for WHYY,
said that both government officials and advocates of public broadcasting are investigating
alternative ways of meeting stations' financial
needs. Tactics couldrange from increased comthe

underwriting of programs to a television set sales tax whose revenue would go to
public broadcasting.
Despite those potential reprieves, problems
remain for public radio. Ellis said that he was
"concerned about any increased commercialization." He worries that public radio stations
may become just like other stations in the
marketplace.
Another issue facing the stations is that federal funds may drop suddenly before alternative procedures can be developed. WHYY president Rick Breitenfeld stressed this point in an
opinion piece that appeared in The Philadelphia Inquirer on January 22. "Let's talk about
[possible changes]," he wrote, "but let's do it
before, not after, we curtail the 'interim' federal funding."
Public relations pieces such as Breitenfeld's
are only part of public radio's efforts to avoid
the budgetary axe. A station in upstate New
York has even set up a phone bank which
provides callers with information about public
broadcasting and the phone numbers and admercial

At an open meeting ofStudent Council last
night, Provost Jennie Keith explained that the
new Honors program will give students more
opportunities to gain admission to graduate
schools and to study abroad.
In the past, Keith said, Honors students were
often rejected by graduate schoolsbecause they
had no grades for theirHonors seminars. Under
the new plan, Swarthmore professors will grade
all Honors work except for theses and other
independent projects. Outside experts will still
examine Honors candidates when they complete their programs.
Honors students will now take four external
exams instead of six and the tests will not be
tied to seminars so directly. The more flexible
requirements will help juniors fit both foreign

He is currently applying to public radio stations

for jobs, but worries that "some of the stations
are not sure whether they will be able to support

the same staff, and local news coverage

because of the motivationbehind the cuts. As a
federally funded program in a time of fiscal
frugality, public broadcasting got in the wayof
politics. The stations may also be in hot water
for their involvement inpolitics. Conservatives
have leveled charges against public radio news
programs for using federal funds to report biased news. Conservative radio talk show host
G. Gordon Liddy has even suggested that NPR
stands not for National Public Radio but for

study and seminars into theirfinal two years at
Swarthmore.
Some of the 25 students at the meeting expressed concern over the rules on double and
special majorsunder the Honors program. Keith
expects the plan will be modified further as
students"testit out." The Curriculum Committee will fully review of the plan in four years.
The Honors system, started by then-President Frank Aydelotte in 1922, was last modified in the early 1980s, when Course students
were first permitted to enroll in Honors seminars. Keith said that "for many, many people,
even outside of the College, [the Honors program] became the marker of Swarthmore. It

suffer the most." He also noted that rural stationsmay be hit hard by the cuts and seconded
Ellis's concern over program. "You won't be
able to hear what you're missing," he said.
Since Congress has not yet
laws
concerning public radio funding, WHYY and
stations like it face an uncertain future. Currently the House appropriations subcommittee
is meeting to discuss de-funding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This could result
in total elimination of the $286 million CPB
now receives, a partial cut, or no change at all.
Regardless, Ellis reaffirmed the need for radio
that "provides valuable educational and
children's programming."Thequestion remains
as to whether that programming will still receive government support, or whether Congress will "sign off on public broadcasting.

National Propaganda Radio.
One program that Liddy wouldn't like was
cited by Ellis as a program that owes its existence to federal funding. While the station was
building an audience for "Fresh Air," the show
originally depended on revenue from federal
grants to make ends meet. The program is now
self-sufficient, but Ellis doubts that it could
have endured without the initial federal support. In fact, program development may be the
area most affected by funding cuts.
The funding cuts could also turn into pink
slips for public radio employees. Eugene Sonn
'95 spent last summer in Washington as an
intern with NPR's "All Things Considered."

Revised Deadlines
Ease Workload in
Admissions Office
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

Changes in application deadlines gave the Admissions Office
time to consider applicants' files more thoroughly this year, but
also made the admissions process less predictable, Dean of
Admissions Carl Wartenburg said Wednesday.
The "regular decision" deadline was moved from February 1
to January 1, and the "winter early decision" application option
was eliminated.The November 15 "fall early decision" deadline
did not change.
Wartenburg said it will be somewhat harder for his office to
predict thenumber of students who will accept admissions offers
this year because the elimination of one early decision option
reduced the total number of early applications. One quarter of the
target number of students for next year's entering class were
admitted early this year. Last year, one third of the freshman class
was accepted under the early decision plan.
More worrisome, Wartenburg added, was the possibility that
some admitted students who choose to defer enrollment might
not inform the College of their plans until late in the summer.
Last summer, 12 students who had already accepted admission
offers decided to wait a yearbefore starting college. S warthmore
has an agreement with a consortium of other prestigious colleges
and universities not to admit students from the waiting list after
July 1, and many of last year's deferrals came after that date,
leaving empty dorm beds at the beginning of last semester.
To bring enrollment to the desired level, the College admitted
14 transfer students this semester, a sharp increase from the lone
transfer admission last semester.
Ifthe number of late deferrals is too high this year, Wartenburg
plans to seek ways to encourage admitted students to make their
deferral decisions before July 1.

Firing the Canon: The PC Debate
It is "both right and necessary to place Western
Civilization and the culture to which it has given rise, at
the center ofour studies, and wefail to do so at theperil
ofour students, our country, and the hopesfor a liberal,
democratic society."
Donald Kagan, Yale University, Classics scholar
The question of the extent to which the traditional
western canon should be represented has lately come
under scrutiny throughout academia. The progress of
this debate at Yale, where Mr. Kagan made the above
statement to incoming Freshmen in 1991, has recently
come to light. This issue has serious implications for us
as students and members of American society.
The year of Mr. Kagan's speech, alumnus Lee Bass
responded to thecall. He donated $2O million to Yale for
the purpose of creating "a course of study in the ancient
thinkers, artists, and other figures who shaped the Western European culture from which modern American
society stems," reported The New York Times on Janu-

the money; "it will help Yale preserve the excellence
0f...0ur teaching," said the current Dean. If this is so,
why in four years have they come up with only one
proposal for its implementation? The argument that
their one idea was a bad one only begs the question
why have they had only one idea? It seems that the
opponents of Western Civilization studies are working
to hinder the proposal.
This issue has implications for Swarthmore. The
trend away from the Western Canon is as evident here
as it is at Yale. As an example, the 1994-95 Swarthmore
Course Catalog listings for the department of English
Literature show nontraditional and traditional courses
at a ratio of roughly two-to-one.
As Mr. Kagan indicated, such a trend has harmful
implications for us as students and for the society in
which we live. When we do not study the thinkers who
formed the basic standards upon which our society is
based, we lose understanding of our society. Without

To date, no suchprogram has been designed. For four

understanding, a society collapses.
By virtue of the fact that we are here at Swarthmore,
we are all beneficiaries of the historical figures that
shaped this culture. If we do not study them, we will lose
our grasp upon its ideals. If we deny programs dedicated
to their work, as Yale is apparently doing, we deny
ourselves a claim to our own history. And if we become
a people without a history, we may become a people

years, that money has remained untouched.

Yale administrators insist that the delay is due to
logistics rather than ideology. One program was proposed and rejected. This occurred, wrote President Richard C. Levin in The Wall Street Journal, because "it
made inefficient use of our faculty resources." However, the Yale administration-appears to be intentionally
avoiding the issue. They admit that they are eager to use

without a future as well.

laugh at the people who squeamishly
abhor such movies, pointing out that
Tarantino is incredibly artistic.

I have now seen Reservoir Dogs
five times, and the fourth time I saw
it something happened which made
me rethink my position on this. One
of my roommates was given the tape
of it over break, so on the Sunday
night before classes started we all
watched it together. The next day,
during one of my classes I started to
space out and for some reason my
mind wandered, until I recalled a
scene from many years ago when my
family was insulted by a cab driver as
he dropped us off at our house. The
details of the scene are not really
important. What is important is that
when I replayed this scene in my
head, with the cabbie screaming the

insult at us as we stood on our stoop,
and then driving away, I envisioned
myself pulling a gun from my belt
and blowing his brains out as he drove
away.
It was not really a conscious mo-

and I realized that it was definitely feedback from the viewing of
Reservoir Dogs the previous evening.
There is definitely something appealing about the swift and efficient way
that the characters in the movie deal
with people who humiliate them or
are obstacles in their path, even
though this is clearly not the message
of the movie.
ment,

On the Non-Observance

Now before everyone starts ducking for cover as I walk around campus I must assure that I am a pretty
peaceful person. I have had a reasonably good upbringing and a stable
life so that I am utterly incapable of
murdering people who insult me.

However, this is not the case for all of
America. Increasingly, it is a fact of
life in urban America that if you
insult the wrong person at the wrong
time you could very well end up
seriously injured. I am not just talking about a few heavily armed and
very sensitive gang lords who every-

body in their right mind knows not to
insult. I am talking about armies of
armed high school and junior high
school students who turn ordinary

playground scuffles into lifeand death
battles. It is hard to imagine that these

young people are notat all influenced
by the simple, violent way that so
many movie characters deal with

damaged pride.

Before every liberal on campus
off screaming I would like to
issue two disclaimers. Of course,
America would be much better off if
all of the deep rooted problems that
made young people susceptible to
the influence of these movies were
solved. And of course I am not proposing that the government should
censor movies that are too violent, I
am well aware of the dangers of such

runs

a proposition.

However, especially in light of the
of the recent elections, that

outcome

these deep rooted

problems are not
be solved any time soon.
Thus, as a society, we would probably be better of without these movies despite their significant artistic
value. So perhaps all of the writers
and directors out there should practice a little self censorship at least to
take the edge of off the incredibly
violent influence that television and
movies inject into our culture.

Kendra's Fifteen Minutes of Sexism Chorus's St. John's
Passion Anti-Semitic?
on the "first girl in a boy's
game" angle made it seem as if

By David Sobel

Kendra Wecker is an ordinary
twelve-year-old girl. When Harry
Schaffer interviewed her and her
mother on "CBS This Morning," she
was nervous and shy. Her mother did
most of the talking. You wouldn't
think from looking at her thatshe can
throw a football over 50 yards, or
kick field goals from the 40-yardline, but she can. She even won a spot
in the finals of the NFL's Punt, Pass
and Kick contest, an annual competition for children ages 8-16. During
half-time of the San Diego-Miami
playoff game, a sellout crowd at Joe
Robbe Stadium cheered as she competed against other, male, twelveyear-olds.

Each finalist had one chance to
punt, kick, and pass a football. They
were judged for distance and accuracy. Kendra did not launch a good
punt, but had a solid place kick and
won the throwing contest hands down
with a throw thatmeasured over fifty
yards.

Kendra received a second place
award. Jim Kelly, quarterback of the
Buffalo Bills, who helped officiate
the contest, said, "I wouldn't wantto
go up against her." Yet, Kendra was
not on "CBSThis Morning" because
of her throwing ability. It was due to
her gender. Besides giving her an
award on the basis of her performance, the NFL felt it necessary to
give her a special honorable mention
because she is a girl.
In their coverage of the event, NBC
went out of their way to talk with
Kendra, spotlighting her—not the
event itself. NBC was so obsessed
with her presence that the only question they asked the winner of the
event was how he felt. His answer
was, "I didn't want to get beat by a
girl." It seemed like no television
reporter covering the event could
believe Kendra was there.
Women's athletics, in fact, has
been gaining popularity and appeal
to the average sports viewer. Perhaps the most exciting game of this
young NCAA season has been the
matchup between #1 Tennessee and
#2 Connecticut in what sports casters say was a preview to the national

championship.
That Kendra Wecker made history as the first girl to be in the finals
of the NFL's Punt Pass and Kick
contest is indeed an impressive

achievement. She can out-kick and
out-throw most people twice her age.
I have no desire to take away anything her hard work has earned for
her. However, the fact that the media

Alumni Selflessness
Versus Self-Interest
By Brian Schwartz

Is altruism really a Swarthmore
tradition? People associate altruism
with gifts to the school from alumni
and friends. Altruism is acting primarily for the sake of another: choosing a lower value over a higher, more
self-serving, value. Yet self-interest
does, and should, drive people to act
inSwarthmore'stradition ofbenevolence, but without sacrifice.
Why dorational people engage in

He lives for his own sake, and expects others to live for theirs. Egoists
hold nothing above their own judgment of truth, and pursue values according to it through productive

achievement.
Nathaniel Brandenreveals the root
of sacrifice: 'To sacrifice one's happiness is to sacrifice one's desires; to
sacrifice one's desires is to sacrifice
one's values; to sacrifice one's values is to sacrifice one's judgment; to
sacrifice one's judgment is to sacrifice one's mind—and it is nothing
less than this that the creed of selfsacrifice aims at and demands."

There are also financial benefits to
gift giving. According to "1993 &94

school, by donating. Swarthmore is

proud of receiving voluntary gifts,

charity (welfare), bites the invisible

Gift giving is selfish. A truly selfish person, an egotist, does not sacrifice himself to others, nor does he
demand others to sacrifice to him.

profit organizations.
Would you want anyone to sacrifice for your well being, as the allegedly ideal Jesus Christ sacrificed for
all alleged "original sinners?" Would
you take pride in your lover sacrificing for you or selfishly deriving pleasure form your virtues? Would you
prefer to have people voluntarily fund
Swarthmore for its virtues, or a have
the government coerce them to sacrifice through taxation?
The choice is either selfishness,
laissez-faire capitalism, freedom (volunteer community service), and charity, or altruism, socialism, slavery
(forced community service), and

taxation.
Rational selfishness, not selfless
altruism, is the root of benevolence.

So, during the rest of the rehearsal
I sat quietly reading the text of 5/

I read about the Jewish soldiers
officers, and high priests who as
serted that Jesus was not the "Kinj

be taken away. For three whol<
pages, they screamed "Crucify!"

John has indeed been used by the
Nazis and others to justify their
anti-Semitic sentiment, they were
most likely misinterpreting the
original intent of the Gospel. Passion plays were performed for the
German neonle and often incited
them to anti-Semitic pogroms. But
how many violent incidents resulted
from this piece? What about the
"Passion's" weighty musical merits?
Many people have asked me to
point out the text's specific antiSemitic words. My problem
though, does not lie completely
within the text, since people can
interpret words in a thousand different ways. I am concerned tha
we will gloss over the historica
realities that haveresulted from this
story and its musical form. I cannot
let that happen. I feel it is crucial for

everyone involved in this performance—the chorus, the audience
and the director—as well as the
entire Swarthmore campus, to know

why I and several others are not
singing.
My chorus colleagues and I are
joining with other concerned students, professors, deans, and religious advisors to educate Swarthmore College about the implications of the piece. We will be collaborating on a campus-wide fo-

rum to discuss the 5/. John s Passion and its surrounding issues. We
will also be including notes in the
program guide, addressing the audience before the performance, and
creating a visual display, such as
empty chairs amidst the chorus sections to symbolize those of us who
cannot enjoy this work by Bach.
No, this is not a perfect solution.

Unfortunately, no amount of education can erase the tragedies cai ised
by anti-Semitism.

SEE ISRAEL FROM THE INSIDE

The work isn't easy. And it
takes more than just concern.
It takes motivation. Commitment. But it's a chance to stop
dreaming about a better world
and start doing something about it.

Then Jesus was crucified and
his body removed from the cross.
The piece proceeded to lament this
Crucifixion.
After I read the text, my heart
told me that I could never utter
those words. How many Jewish
babies and mothers and brothers
and grandparents and souls were
blamed for Christ's death? Isn't it
just an historical accident that I was
born in 1975 instead of during the
time of the blood libels or the Crusades or the Holocaust whenI would
have been tortured and killed along
with my ancestors? I would never
be able to live with myself as a Jew
or as a person if I dared beautify
this story.

All right. All right. I know it is the kiss of a
humor columnist's death to devote an entire
article to our sanctified eating establishment,
Sharpies. It's trite. It's overused. It's been done
a million times before...by me alone, in fact.
But hey, I'm feeling a little nostalgic today.
And Sharpies is a communal experience that
brings all Swatties together at one time or
another. It's just like male bonding, only better
because it doesn't involve males. It involves
food.
Okay, kids, so everybody gather round now and have a seat. It's
story time. Tedd, stop poking at
Bob! You don't know where he's
been. And Ngina, give me that
paper and pay attention! You and
Myrt can play M.A.S.H. at recess.
Why can't you all act like Al?
Look how he's sitting there, like
such a big little gentleman. What
a good boy he is, my little
pookins!
The book I am about to read to
you is entitled The Old Man and
the Sea by Ernest Hemingway.
Ha! Just kidding! I wonder how
many devoted Phoenix readers I
just lost for good. Not too many, I
hope. You must have known that it was just a
joke. I mean, would I really have the gall to
reiterate to you the worst story ever written in
the history of mankind just for my own sick and
twisted enjoyment? Am I that callous and
unkind? Of course not!
The actual story I am going to tell you is
about a man. An old man. An old man on a
boal. An old man on a boat in the sea with a
really big and stupid fish. Ha! ha!
ha...urn...gee...l'm so sorry. I couldn't control
myself. I'm so ashamed. Please forgive me.
Let's go on.
There once was a spear of broccoli named
Herbert. Now Herbert was an ideal specimen
of edible vegetation. He was erect, turgid, and
leafy with a bountiful head of buds. He was a
prince amongst his cauliflower kingdom.

And then they froze him.

They soaked him in
imprisoned him in a plastic, hermetically sealed baggie, and inserted him in the back
of a deep, dark, industrial sized refrigerator unit
where he sat, lonely and freezer-burned, for
weeks.
One day, however, the great chilly vault that
Herbert had finally accepted as his own death
chamber was opened, and he was againbrought
into the light. And yes, Herbert's little green
heart rejoiced. Yes, it rejoiced,
that is, until they tried to drown
him. They poured him, along
with his other broccoli brethren,
into a great vat of boiling water
where he cooked and cooked for
hours. The brilliant emerald
green of his stalk faded to a dull
kelly brown. His once erect
stature began to wilt and separate, and his proud head of florets dissolved in the scalding
water,

Vent by

water.

Soon, he was seized by the
jaws of the great metal tongs and
thrown onto a pan. He was
placed into the vegetarian line
under the heading, "Broccoli
Spears." As his neighbors, the
new recipe vegetable turnovers and the
creamed corn, were greedily abducted by the
hordes of ravenous yet completely dissatisfied
college students that marched before him,
Herbert was left sitting in the tray. At 7:00 p.m.
he was taken back to the kitchen.
The next day he found himself being mangled by the razor sharp edge of a knife. By 11
a.m. he was reheated, titled "Chopped
Broccoli," and again left to suffer the indignity
of being passed over by appetites that prefer
eating lentil loaf to his formerly majestic self.
His constitution and consistency could now
finally be described with the same word:
mushy. 1:00 p.m., back to the kitchen.
At 4:45 p.m. the same day, Herbert is horrified to find himself mixed with bourgeois,
common ingredients. He is now a part of the

'Tangy Broccoli Rice Cheese Casserole." Oh!
The injustice of it all! Yet still he sits.
At 7:01 p.m., as the Sharpies' staff begins to
close for the night, Herbert stands alone, the
last tray to be taken back to the kitchen.
Suddenly, a harried Bio lab student, smelling
fresh of formaldehyde and with fingers stained
purple by iodine, rushes into the serving area.
He picks up the spoon in the casserole that had
previously stood untouched by human hands
and pokes curiously at the concoction.
Herbert's spirit begins to rise as he dreams of
finally being freed from his metallic containment.

But, just as suddenly as the student had
is gone. His presence remembered
only by his words that still float in the air above
Herbert's flaccid head, "Maybe there's some
granola left."
The next day Herbert is scooped into a
blender, frapped, and served in the salad bar as
broccoli cheese soup. His once graceful form is
now completely camouflaged by the thin layer
of yellow film that covers the stew. A visiting
and unsuspecting grandmother breaks this skin
with the ladle and pours Herbert into her bowl.
But the broccoli cares not. His will has been
completely broken by these harshest of times.
The grandmother ambles toward the coffee
maker, unaware of the bucket of ice that has
been placed beside the soda machine that still
does not contain ice and, thus, has been dispensing warm, flat Diet Coke for the past two
weeks to the chagrin of all those people who
really need their two glasses of Coke caffeine
fix for breakfast in order to make it to Chinese
civilization class in the morning.
Her heel snags the wheel of the bucket,
destroying her balance, and sending her stumbling forward. The bowl of broccoli cheese
soup tumbles from its precarious perch on her
warped faux-wicker gray tray and shatters on
the floor.
Herbert slowly seeps under the trash can.

funnier than Allen's occasionally abysmal

They said it themselves, "There can be only one!" So
why, I say with tears in my eyes, didn't they listen to

their own words? Why after all this time, do we have
another installment in the Highlander series? I went and
saw Highlander HI on opening day because I loved the
first film. Ifigured, "Aha! Here it is, therecompense for
that awful thing called Highlander II: The QuickeningA" I knew deep in my heart that they would make it

up to all of us die-hard Highlander fans with this new
film.I mean, it looked great in the ads: it has cool special
effects, lots of swordplay, andMario Van Peebles. And
what could be worse than the second one?? Now, I sit
here typing this and weeping because I, and thousands
like me, have been betrayed by Christopher Lambert
and all the others behind this... this... franchise. Ughh,
I feel sick...
Here's the premise: the Highlander, Connor McCleod,
isback in business because, that'sright, he isn't the last
of the immortals. There's one other who he just forgot
about when he killed theKergen about ten years ago. He
forgot that he left Mario Van Peebles, a.k.a. Kane, in a
cave in the middle of Japan about 400 years ago. You
got it, Kane gets loose with his two henchmen when the
cave is undergoing archeological excavation. He sends
one of to find McCleod, and kills theother immediately
because..."there can be only one." Duh....
There was absolutely nothing redeeming about this
ridiculous piece 0f... ahhh, cough, cough. Excuse me.
The special effects were ass. In ten years we're all going
to sit around and say, "Remember the early nineties,
when all that morphing stuff was so cool in the movies?" And some of it these days is cool, but this movie
won't have any of that nonsense. The budget for this
movie obviously didn't pay for Industrial Light and
Magic. In addition, the famed swordplay of the Highlander series was reduced to one cool move that was
repeated twice in the movie, and was filmed in this ugly
(not to mention ineffective) negative view. And Mario
Van Peebles.... Never mind. I never thought a film
could sink below Highlander 11, but they did it. With
flying colors.
I didn't think I could rate movies below 1; I mean, the
scale doesn't go any lower. I spent the whole film
asking Adam to please kill me. He urged me to give it
a negative rating. I would have, but I can't think of any
clever sayings to go with them, so Highlander 111 gets
a (0), which stands for, "This movie blows chunks."

Week in Review

Swimming
As expected, the Dickinson Devils were
no match for Swarthmore's own Quicker
Quakers (...just add water). The meet was a
breeze for the men, elevating their record to
8-2, while the women moved to 10-1. After
three years of humiliating defeats at the
hands of Dickinson during the. dual meet
season, it was time for the seniors enjoy the
depth and talent on the team.
The performance of the day came from
Andy Robbins '9B who took .04 seconds off

2i)o yd backstroke record. This placed
as the Second fastest swimmer in that
event in the conference, and he looks ready
to collect many points at the Conference
meet. Also showing off their talent were the
Swat distance forces, going 1-2-3-4 in the
1000 yd. JaimeRaich '97 made the Conference cut in the 500 yd with a gutsy perforwic

mance.
The women also swam another great meet.
Molly Marino '9B had a personal best in the
200 back, as did Tricia Duncan '95. Skye
Fulkerson '96 and Sarah Werneck '96 have
become a wicked tandem in the 200 breast.
After this rousing victory the team travelled to scenic Philadelphia for the annual
meet with the Division I, U.Perm Quakers. It
was a mismatch and the lack of motivation
was evident.. Kris Robertson '9B had a
standout meet, getting personal bests in allof
the events in which she swam. Jason Devlin
'9B and MarkFriedberg '9B had season bests
in the 100 and 200 frees respectively.
The men's record stands at 8-3, while the
women slip to 10-2. This weekend the team
travels north to challenge HamiltonCollege.

Swat then faces Washington College who have
claimed all year long to be the secondbest team
in the conference, while Swarthmore has quietly won with equivalently fast times. It is the
last dual meet of the season and the last one
foreverfor the 5 senior men and 2 senior women.
With hair blazing garnet and adrenaline pumping Swat will be a sight to see, so come down to
Ware Pool next Wednesday at S:JU p.m.

Badminton
The Women's Badminton team avenged its
previous loss to Harcun College by defeating
them at home on Tuesday, January 31 by a
score of 3-2. Singles players Thanh Hoang '97,
Jovanka Tepavcevic '97, and Jen Setlow '95
were all victorious, and #1 player Hoang remainedundefeated for the season. The doubles
teams of Shilpi Chandra '97 and Aliya Esmail
'97, as well as Jen Klein '9B and Anna Dewan
'96, turned in strong performances. The team's
overall record stands at 3-2.
Coach DariSears commented that the sizable

The Swat wrestling team had a very impressive showing this weekend at their own Elite
Meet which featured the talents of several Division I schools. Although they did not have
any individual champions, five SWAT wrestlers captured a top four finish in their weight
class. Pete Balvanz (142) and co-captain Eric
Williams (167) each took second, Charles
Teplin (126) and Alec Stall placed third, and
co-captain Michael Madden(l77) captured a

fourth place finish.
Now that the tournament is over, the
Swarthmore matmen have turned their attention to archrival Haverford, who they will meet
at Haverford College this Friday. When asked
what the keys to victory will be for Swarthmore,
wrestler Pete Balvanz commented, We need

Having faced a tough batch of conference games, the Swarthmore
Women's Basketball team ends this
week with a 7-10 record. After beating Widener in a decisive 12 point
game, the women fell to Washington
College and then to Muhlenberg.
Preparing to meet Widener for the
second time this season (the first time
was in a preseason scrimmage) the
women were ready for battle. The
one point loss in the 93-94 season in
a last second shot had not been forgotten and Swarthmore pulled ahead

Lisl Cochran-Bond '97, with 13

Maloney '95,12 points, led the team
in this second half and the Garnet
went on to win 60-48. This marked
not only the team's first victory over
oldconference rival Widener in years
but also Swat's seventh victory. This
seventh victory puts Swat one up
over theirsix wins last season and the
"winningest" season Coach Karen

As Ben Schall '97 calmly sank the
second of two free throws with 15
seconds remaining, the Swarthmore
Garnet were within reach of a three
game winning streakfor the first time
since the start of last season. But this
is not a meaningless three game
streak, instead, the victories have
come against three division opponents and thrust the Garnet into sole
possession of first place in the East
Division of the Centennial Conference.

With five games left in the season,

however, the Garnet have by no means
locked up a playoff position. Three
of the five games are on the road
against East Division opponents who
still have hopes for playoff births.
Not one of the four contenders for the
two East Division playoff spots has
beaten any of the others on the road.
"The records of the four playoff
contenders in our division are inversely proportional to the difficulty
of the remainder of their schedule.

People might say [Haverford], they're
4-5. They're out of it, but that's notat
all true," said Coach Lee Wimberly.
The Garnet face Haverford on the
road this Saturday in yet another crucial division game. It's the first
Swarthmore-Haverfordgame inyears
that will have playoff implications
for both teams.
After being soundly defeated by
undefeated Franklin and Marshall,
the Garnet have reeled off victories
against Ursinus (76-66), Washing-

ton (78-71), and Muhlenberg (64-61)
and have won five of their last six
games.The victory over Muhlenberg
was only the Garnet's fourth win in
33 meetings against the Mules.
"I think we're surprising everybody including ourselves a little bit,
but there's a long way to go," said
Coach Wimberly. Against the Mules
the Garnet literally didn't get any
help off the bench. The five starters
were the only Garnet to score. This
comes as a surprise since the Garnet

usually get strong bench play.
Wednesday night the Gamer, led
by nine early points from Schall (21
pts., 8 rebounds.) jumped out to an
early lead and managed to keep the
Mules a couple baskets behind for
much of the first half. However, the
Mules began to chip away at the
Garnet lead with a steal and a couple
of three-pointers. The Mules seized

the lead 27-26 for the first time since
the opening basket with about four
minutes left in the half.

Soothsayers' Predictions Off by Slimmest of Margins
By Nathan Hegedus and
Neal Potischman
This past Sunday, the San Diego
Chargers came within a hair'sbreadth
of shocking the world and covering
the spread in Super Bowl XXDC. A
late Charger rally came tantalizingly
close to bringing the 49er margin of
victory below 21 points, but the gritty
folk hero, Stan Humprhies, was unable to rally the troops.

The Chargers lost the game by a
final score of 49 to 26, similar to the
blowout we had predicted. We also
predicted that the game would be
over in a hurry,only to be watched by
those with money in the line. Four
billion dollars was illegally bet on
the game, although none by these

authors. Perhaps that is why so many
tuned in until the end, eagerly anticipating the Chargers' last gasp (and
hoping for two point conversions).
The crucial question still on many
fans' minds is who paid off the
Charger secondary on the49ers' two

opening possessions. Either drive
registered as the fastest

would have

possessions."
touchdown in Super Bowl history, a
fact which won't be touted in the
Charger press guide next fall.
The 49ers set numerous other offensiverecords as well, including the
most touchdownpasses in one game.
Jerry Rice, the devastating 49er receiver, also managed to shatter several other SuperBowlrecords in spite
of being knocked out of the game for
a time in the second quarter. In short,
the 49er offense was every bit as
"high octane" as we predicted it would
be last week. It was this offensive
unit which gave the franchise its fifth
Super Bowl title, and as each title
earns a Super Bowl ring, this victory
has been named "Onefor the thumb."
The point of this article however,
since we assume some of you lost
money based on our predictions, is to
explain exactly what happened in
Super Bowl XXIX that caused the
Chargers not to beat the spread. (In
spite of the headline on our article
last week, we predicted a 49er blow-

out.). We look to three factors.
First, dropped passes in the end

zone at the end of the first halfkilled
the betting hopes ofCharger fans. If
Tony Martin did not have hands of
stone, the Chargers would have been
looking at eight points instead of
three. For those of you keeping score,
this would have made the final margin ofvictory eighteenpoints. (Again
refer to last week's article, where we
predicted an eighteenpoint 49er win..)
Second, the quick 49er scoring
strikes forced the Chargers out of
their running game, effectively negating thevalue ofNatrone Means as
the explosive force he is wont to be.
As Natrone was held to a paltry 31
yards on the ground, the Charger
offense stalled inkey situations. (Refer to last week's article where we
based our prediction on Natronehaving a 100+ yard game.)
Third, Stan Humphries did not have
the game he and San Diego had hoped

for. In the closing seconds of both
the first and second halves,
Humphries' vaunted thunderbolt of
an arm misfired and fell short of the
mark. His two interceptions proved
costly, especially the first since he
had a man free for a touchdown had
the ballbeen well thrown. Granting
that touchdown (which would have
removed the need for the two point
conversions seen later in the game),
the Chargers would yet again have
ended with five more points than
they did, closing with an eighteen

From thewonderful to the horrifying, the Doritos half time show presented all thatis wrong withAmerica.
Doritos, which probably paid something on the order of one billion dollars for rights to the show, provided
the world with what will now be
known as the Indiana Jones debacle.
The presentation was characterized
by some of the worst lip-synching
since Milli Vanilli and some of the
worst stage fighting since Mr. T got
out of show business. In our opinion,
Doritos would have donebetter simply by putting aDoritos bag on screen

the fortunate side, the fog and thehalf

performance of the national anthem
appear tolerable in comparison.
Gifford's nymph-like voice captivated the audience, yet her physical
appearance frightened smallchildren
across America. Although not an
unattractive woman, Gifford appeared possessed by the devil for the
song's duration.

In the final, quasi-football portion
of the game, San Diego's two twopoint conversions bestowed two hun-

anticipated Pro Bowl in Hawaii. The
authors will not venture a prediction,
suffice it to say that the AFC will
have a great deal of difficulty overcoming the presence of the many
Tampa Bay superstars on the NFC

point deficit.

In sum, we do not concede any
error in our prognostication. The
Chargers deserved to lose, but only
by eighteen points. No matter how
you cut it, a grave injustice was done
to the betting world by the Charger
collapse and failure to seek the necessary five points. Yet enough on the
betting and football; the real show
often occurred off the field.
The advertisements were true to
form as innovative and exciting as
American capitalism itself. Pepsi
was the overall winner on the day,
with three brilliant ads ranging from
the macabre: a boy slurping so hard
on a Pepsi that he was sucked into the
bottle, to the violent: a Pepsi distributor brawling withhis Coca-Cola counterpart, to the downright hilarious
and initially grating: a man in the
middle ofnowhere who spent several
hours attempting to have the Pepsi
machine accept his rumpled dollar
bill.

and quickly jumped to an 11 point
lead 46-35. A couple of defensive
lapses let the Mule point guard known
affectionately as “Emieeeee” by the
Garnet crowd score a couple of
layups. Soon the Mules had tied the
game at 50-50. Although the Mules
were cold from the field all night,
they managed to score many of their
points on second shots after grabbing
the offensive rebound.
Uncharacteristically, the Garnet
did not do a good job on the boards.
Coach Wimberly cited a statistic that
40% of Muhlenberg shots were off
misses that they rebounded. Nor did
the Garnet shoot well from the free
throw line (12-21). The Garnet were

grabbed a strong rebound. At 1:46,
Rodner was fouled with only one
second left on the shot clock. He hit
one of two free throws, but the Mules
quickly answered with a jumper of

their own to seize the lead at 61-60.
In the clutch, Voolich showed the
depth ofhis offensive arsenal and hit
his second gorgeous "baby hook" of
the night. Daulerio came up with a
steal on defense and fed Schall who
was fouled with 16 seconds left. He
hit both free throws and thanks to
intelligent Garnet strategy on defense,
the Mules were unable to get off a
good shot in the last 15 seconds.
