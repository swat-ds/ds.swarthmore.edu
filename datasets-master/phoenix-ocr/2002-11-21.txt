For ailing endowment,
some suggest socially
responsible investing
BY MATTHEW FITTING

Matthew C. Fitting Phoenix Staff

Ville resident and 12-year-old Kevin Murray describes borough residents as kind to skateboarders.

Skaters fight proposed ban
and they succeeded in postponing the
vote. It seemed that some of the council members
had changed their minds.

history

BY GREG NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
"Part of skateboarding is getting kicked out,"
said David Farrell, a 15-year-old Swarthmore resident. In the four years he's been skateboarding,
the police have kicked him out of the train station,
the college, the First Keystone Bank parking lot,
even the sidewalk and they weren't usually very
polite about it. Strath Haven High School, where
Farrell is a sophomore, prohibited his sport on

school property years ago.
But when the Borough Council tried to ban
skateboarding in the ville entirely, they had gone
too far.
Last Tuesday, when the Swarthmore Borough
Council met to vote on the ban, about 20 teenagers
and their parents showed up to voice their opposition at the best-attended council meeting in recent

Swarthmore Student Council member Anna
the meeting in opposition to
the ban, and several people involved felt her words
and presence made a significant impact.
Many of those same skateboarders and parents
are now restarting an eight-year-old campaign to
build a skate park in Swarthmore, though it seems
unlikely they will get much financial support from
Morgan 'O4 spoke at

With the college's endowment $l5O million less than it was two years
ago, some students suggest socially responsible investing as a solution
that will both reverse the endowment's fall and better meet
Swarthmore's well-publicized commitment to social justice.
The suggestion has come, partly, in response to performance data of
socially screened stock portfolios over the past several years. A socially screened portfolio excludes stocks that investors might object to for
companies that directly or indirectly help
any ofnumber of reasons
manufacture arms or that that engage in unfair labor practices are
among those excluded.
According to the Social Investment Forum (SIF), a national nonprofit group that promotes socially responsible investing, assets in professionally managed, socially screened investment portfolios rose 36
percent between 1999 and 2001 and surpassed the $2 trillion mark for
the first time in 200 L Total assets under management in portfolios
screened for one or more social issues climbed from SL49 trillion in
1999 to $2.03 triUion in 200
L
In addition, the SIF reports that the growth rate for socially
screened portfolio assets was more than L 5 times that of all professionally managed assets in America over that same period. According to
the 2001 Nelson's Directory of Investment Managers, the total universe
of professionally managed investment assets in the U.S. grew at 22 percent, from $16.3 trillion in 1999 to $19.9 trillion in 2001, during the same
period in which socially screened assets under professional management grew by 36 percent.
Kim Bussey 'O4, a member of the Swarthmore Progressive Action
Coalition (SPAC) who has researched socially responsible stocks, partly in preparation for a SPAC-led divestment campaign to take place'
later this year, said socially responsible stocks could mean even more

Where exactly the idea for the ban came from is
a bit unclear. "I'm not real sure where it came
from," said Farrell's mother, Mary, who four years

"It's important for Swarthmore because Swarthmore is certainly an
institution based on ... all these values, and it likes to hearken back to
these values," she said. "I think socially responsible investing is a way
it can actually stay committed to those values."
The college has made some effort to use its stock holdings in a
socially conscious way. The Committee on Socially Responsible

Students discuss plan to expand seminars, eliminate PDCs
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY

kduongll@swarthmore.edu

A fireside chat concerning the elimination of PDCs and the creation of more firstyear seminars was held in Kohlberg coffee
bar on Wednesday night. Erica Kaufman
'O3, representing the Council on
Educational Policy (CEP), and Lester Tran
'O3, Student Council's educational policy
representative, facilitated

the discussion.

Kaufman and Tran distributed a draft
of a proposal that they hope to present to
the faculty before spring break. The proposal calls for the institution of first-year
seminars that would focus not only on the
subject of the class, but also on improving
the "intellectual and communication skills
needed to succeed at Swarthmore."

Several departments, like history,
English, and chemistry currently offer
first-year seminars.

The enrollment for these seminars
would be limited to 12 and would be
optional for incoming freshmen during
their credit/no credit first semester.
Realizing that certain departments may

THE PHOENIX

not be able to offer first-year seminars in
the fall, CEP has also proposed that firstyear seminars in the spring be offered

under the credit/no credit system as well.
Tran and Kaufman emphasized that
these seminars would be optional. They
also hope the seminars will help form

close relationships between students and
seminar professors, who could potentially double as students' advisers. The seminar would also allow freshmen to form
close relationships with one another.
The proposal is also calling for the
elimination of PDCs. This change would
not affect either the Class of 2003 or 2004.
Since CEP has not addressed the effects
on students graduating in 2005 and 2006,

these students are being advised to continue taking their normal course loads.
Students would still be required to take
three courses in each division for graduation. Each division may also specify certain types of courses for their requirement. For example, the division of the
Natural Sciences and Engineering would
have the option of requiring students to
take one laboratory course.

Some students at the fireside chat
opposed the CEP's proposal. "The only

thing I see as beneficial with first-year
seminars is that they're smaller, but it's
not going to help if they're all going to be
full," said Roxanne Yaghoubi 'O5, who
hopes to serve on CEP in the future.
Tran and Kaufman's proposal brought
up other academic issues as well. Andrew
Gisselquist 'O5 presented a concern about
the
current writing program at
Swarthmore, specifically the interaction
between the student and his or,her writing associate (WA). "I'm not sure if the

experience with the WA forces the student to make a good first draft," he said.
Gisselquist suggested that a WA
should function as more of a grader for
the course. He noted that science courses

currently hire students to grade problem
sets and that a WA could perform a similar function by grading short papers.
Professors would then be responsible for
evaluating longer papers.
Tran
and Kaufman addressed
Gisselquist's concerns by saying that in
the place of PDCs, writing-intensive

November 21, 2002

courses called "WICs" may be offered as a
part of CEP's proposal. The council is currently collaborating with the Writing
Program Task Force to define what WICs
would entail. The four faculty members
who currently serve on this committee
are Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
Joy Charlton of sociology, Barry Schwartz
of psychology, Diane Anderson of education, and Bob Weinberg of history.
Several students asked if these proposed changes are responses to discontent among faculty concerning the quality of their students' writing. Tran denied
these statements. "Everyone has the con-

sensus that this school does more for its
students in terms of writing than any
other school," she said.
"We're not trying to address any inadequacies," Kaufman said. "We're just trying
to enhance the system."
Tran and Kaufman encourage any student who would like to make suggestions
to do so before spring break. Once the
proposal is presented to the faculty, the
proposal will no longer be open to student
input.

Library, ITS predict difficulty if asked to make budget cuts
is the central priority of the administration; any belttightening is not likely to be evident to students."

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmore.edu
As administrators of the library and computing services look ahead to tighter budgets in coming years, they predict that any deeper cuts will noticeably impact the quality of services their departments offer to students.
The late 1990s were good years for the college, and it
was easy for departments to find support for promising
new ways to spend money. If there wasn't enough in the
college operating budget, there was a fair amount of onetime money available.
Of course, there wasn't a free flow of money even when
the college endowment peaked at over $1 billion in 2000.

And a number of items the college needed, such as academic journals and software licenses, were increasing at
rates much higher than inflation. But the college was in a
very good situation financially.
That stretch of easier financial times for the college
ended last year, and a new focus on efficiency is replacing
past impressions that the college was able to spend freely.
Budgets for this year have been tightened in order to
sustain new programs, and the pressure on some departments will increase after the coming year's budget is set
this winter.
This means that departments will need to be prepared
to justify their current expenses and look for ways to save
further. The picture painted by Director of Information
Technology Services Judy Downing and College Librarian
Peggy Seiden is one in which there are few behind the
scenes cuts left to be made in their budgets.
"There are no easy answers now. Last year, the answers
were easier," Downing said.
Neither Downing or Seiden know how much money
they will have to work with next year, though. The budget
for the 2003-2004 academic year is still is still in its early
stages. At the moment, the president's staffand the College
Budget Committee are trying to weigh the consequences of
different types of cuts, and are not to the point of singling
out departments for cuts.

Since the libraries and ITS, along with all academic
programs, are under the control of the Provost's office,
these departments are not expecting to be asked to be cut
as much as some others. Provost Connie Hungerford said
in an e-mail that "the excellence of the academic program

Financial aid is considered an untouchable item in

terms of the budget, and faculty compensation and the academic programs themselves are also considered priority
items, according to a list prepared by Vice President for

Finance and Treasurer Sue Welsh.
The fact that ITS reports to the provost's office, which
also oversees academic departments and the libraries,
helps ITS when it comes to budgeting, Downing said.
Seiden said much the same is true for the libraries.
Last spring, some departments chose to save money by
putting off large expenses for a few years or by negotiating
better deals with vendors. Downing said ITS got rid of a
program for faculty software and squeezed the staff development budget.

The cuts in the spring gave departments practice shuffling money around within their budgets, taking from old
programs to make room for new ones. But now, as there is
no indication the budget constraints the college faces this
year are not likely to disappear in the next few years,
departments will face deeper, more lasting reductions.
Last spring, however, when all departments were asked
trim their budgets by five percent, the libraries were only
able cut a little over two percent, eliminating $40,000 from
their budget, Seiden said. What's unique to the libraries'
budgets is the quickly increasing costs of academic journals,
and to a lesser extent, books and other electronic databases.
A single subscription to the journal Gene costs the college $8,500 a year. Most journals cost significantly less
than that, but science and technical journals are particularly pricey, with a rate of inflation in the double digits,
Seiden said. The libraries' total periodicals budget of
$824,000. In order to hold down the library's operating
costs, the library now subscribes to 500 fewer journals
than it did in 1997.
Seiden expects that without an increase to the library's
budget for the coming year, it will have to reduce it services anyway. She predicts that for the library to maintain
its current services next year, its overall budget of close to
$2 million would need to increase by seven percent.
Swarthmore usually increases its departments' budgets
based on an inflation plus L 5 percent formula.
She said books are the only flexible item in her budget,
and "that budget is being steadily eroded." For a library

like Swarthmore that "doesn't make a pretense of being a
research library" that's okay to a point, she said. "But
much more cutting and you start to erode the quality of the
collection."
The library and ITS spend a combined $250,000 on student wages each year, but Seiden and Downing both said
their departments depend on student workers and would
not consider cutting those aspects of their budgets.
Downing said "there will be no surprises" if ITS makes
reductions in its services. She has a list ready of places she
would look to cut.
For the coming year, if there are cuts to her budget,
Downing said, "I would imagine that some of the things
would be more visible to the community." Big budget cuts
would mean she would begin to save on hardware and
reduce the number of computers in public areas. Beyond
that, "I hate to say even putting a stricter limit on Internet
bandwidth, but it is something we would look at,"
Downing said.
"We're always starting something new, so now we're
looking to see if is there is anything we can stop doing,"
Downing said. One program she has been looking into getting rid of is the automated voice recognition system. She
might also consider getting rid of the free network access
from home that is offered to faculty.
The total operating budget for ITS is SL4 million, and
the bulk of the expenses are in network infrastructure and
hardware. Bandwidth costs about $60,000 a year, and it
costs about $400,000 to replace all desktop computers

around campus. ITS has remained a fairly constant percentage of the overall college budget throughout the past

decade. It spent $425 per student in 1990-1991, and in 200020001 ITS spent $903 per student.
Software is the ITS cost that is increasing most quickly;
ITS spent about $200,000 on software licenses this year. The
two most expensive annual software license are the
Blackboard course management system and the Banner
database that does payroll and the student records. ITS
spends $30,000 a year on toner and paper.
Next year Downing said, "We'll be a little more aggressive in competitive bids, making sure vendors are giving
us the best possible pricing. We'll look at trying to delay
the replacement of something for a year or two. It could get
to the point that some of the things we are doing are a lit-

tle more visible."

Suggested cuts to dining services draw attention and opposition
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
Aarondil@swarthmore.edu
Last
week, Vice President for
Administration Larry Schall told Student

Council that the college might discontinue
dinner meal equivalencies at Essie Mae's,

and stop employing special-needs individu-

als for evening clean-up jobs in Sharpies.
While those proposals are just two of many
cost-saving measures now under discussion, they have attracted particular attention because they are the only proposals
which have so far been made public.
Currently, Swarthmore contracts the
Sharpies post dinner clean-up shift
through a company called Extra-Thorough
Cleaning (ETC), which employs specialneeds staff. The college also provides daytime training to special-needs individuals,
many of whom are later hired by ETC.
Schall suggested discontinuing the dinner
meal equivalency rate and then moving
some evening Tarble employees to
Sharpies to take over the ETC clean-up
jobs, though no one has proposed cutting
the training program.

Linda McDougall,

head of Dining

Services, helped develop the proposal
Schall shared with Student Council. "[The
proposal] wasn't a surprise to me because I

had been working with Larry on it," she
said, adding that Schall had asked managers in all facilities departments to question, "if we had to make budget cuts
especially
what would be the best way
without impacting employees. These were
some of the suggestions I and my managing
...

...

team came up with."
Dining Services has already made some
smaller budget cuts. Over October break,
Sharpies eliminated bottled water and
switched juice companies. (The bottled
water cost $12,000 per year.) Schall and
McDougall were invited to the Student
Council meeting to talk about the changes
already implemented, but Schall volunteered proposals for future cuts as well.

around $lOO,OOO per year. Using ETC for
Sharpies clean-up costs the college $BO,OOO
per year (out of a total Dining Service
budget of approximately $3 million).
Offering meal credits at Tarble is also a
sizeable expense. "The board and the catering and the summer camp is what helps the
snack bar break even," McDougall said.

Schall said he told Student Council
about proposed cuts in Dining Services
because Dining Services changes were
what he was invited to the council to discuss. "I was trying to give a context for
why we'd done those things," he said.
While Schall acknowledged that telling
council about the possible Dining Services
cuts had focused disproportionate attention on those proposals, he did not regret
sharing the information. "I don't mind

lency, and questioned how much money it
would save the college. "Given the already
existing discrepancy between the actual
meal plan and the equivalency rate we're
given at Tarble, discontinuing the dinner
meal equivalency seems like it would be
both ineffective in curbing the deficit and a

cause for backlash among students," said
Sonya Hoo 'O5, an Essie Mae's regular.
Tarble employees interviewed declined to
comment, saying that they did not yet have
enough information about the proposed

cuts would not happen."
"[ETC] is a program that we have significant ties to and that everyone feels is a
wonderful example of socially responsible
employment practices," he said. "There's a
push for the Living Wage and Democracy
Campaign which reflects an increased concern with socially responsible employment
practices, and cutting the ETC program
would not be in line with that."
Members of the Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign echoed Rubin's concerns. "The campaign heard about [the proposed cut]
and decided to do what we
could to let people know this wasn't an
acceptable cut to make," said Mariah
Montgomery 'O4, one of the campaign's two
co-coordinators. "The people in the ETC
program are staff too. This seems to suggest that when the college needs to save
money, it looks to cut staff."
Chela Delgado 'O3, who has served as
the campaign's liaison to Sharpies staff
...

members, called staff sentiment for the

changes.

ETC program overwhelmingly positive.

Neither Schall nor McDougall was willing to speculate on the likelihood of the
cuts.
"I just don't know at this point,"
McDougall said. "We've had numbers
thrown at us projecting far into the future."
Even if the cuts to the ETC program and
Tarble happen, they probably will not be
implemented immediately. "I think the
plan at this point will be to defer any major
change until after next year," Schall said.

"Generally Sharpies staff members are
really supportive of the program," she said.
"They help to train ETC folk."
McDougall emphasized she too cared
about the ETC program. "[The program]
was started by Larry and I," she noted.
"[Cutting it] is not an easy thing for Larry
and I to do." But she said the budget shortfall was forcing hard choices. "It's that or
not having juice at every meal or not having six lunchmeats," she said. "We can cut

'Colorblindness' is hotly debated at Ring
BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu

What is the definition of "colorblindness" in respect to
race? Is it a desirable aspiration in today's society? In
response to these questions raised in the Halloween costume/blackface incident, a Ring discussion was held last

Thursday at Mephistos.
Michelle Park '9B, a discussion coordinator, introduced
whatshe said should be "civil, respectful way of discussion
to disagree, to persuade each other and
to dig down
closer to the truth." Comparing the discussion to a boxing
match, Park reminded participants that "we should duke it
out, but we're not going to kill each other. After the match,
we can take off our gloves and shake hands."
Panelists, invited to the Ring discussion in response to
their posts on the Daily Jolt, each prepared and presented
...

their own views on colorblindness and how race relations
should be treated in today's society. According to board
members, this panel was not meant as a source of authority as much as a springboard or catalyst for discussion.
"I don't think colorblindness is the unawareness of a person's race or ethnicity," Arthur Chu 'O6 said. "Instead, it's a
decision to recognize that a person is black, white, Latino,
Asian
and not to judge them that way." He said he supported colorblindness as a personal aspiration and noted
that it is easy to "set up guards, create automatic barriers,"
if one doesn't ignore race in one's personal relationships.
"Sensitivity is a good thing," Chu said, "but it should
come out of your individual interactions with the person
and not with the entire race."

at "the broad range of ideologies that [all the cultures]
bring and are historically built around."
Jacob Hodes 'O3 went a step further, saying that he
thought "colorblindness is impossible." Colorblindness
would never work on the political level, he said, because
"if you don't see race, you don't see racism." On interpersonal relations, he disagreed with Chu in saying "Color
If we don't see that, there's no way
shapes our identity
to talk about these things." One should be "color conscious," he said, and "make a commitment to listen and

discuss differences."

"The hurt feelings of a few of us
privileged black Swatties are petty
when compared to the hopless
despair of blacks who are truly victimized by white oppression"
Taru Taylor 'O4

...

Joseph Dickerson 'O4 agreed in calling colorblindness
"an ideal [that] we're striving for in society, something we
hope to attain at one time." He noted, however, that "we're
at a time in history where racist ideologies still exist.
[Colorblindness] is an ideal, yes; can it work now? No." He
raised the point that different ideologies, based on different cultural and racial backgrounds, are constantly at play
in dealing with race relations. He said people should look

Taru Taylor 'O4 focused his presentation on the blackface event. "The bourgeois status of every student here," he
said, "black or white, male or female, yellow or brown or
red, shields us allfrom the need to get hysterical over petty
racism ... [and] respond to Billy Kraig coolly and calmly."
"The hurt feelings of a few of us privileged black
Swatties are petty when compared to the hopeless despair
of blacks who are truly victimized by white oppression,"
he continued, "people for whom a Swarthmore education
is a pipedream." He said he hopes that students here can
"all be colorblind relative to our fellow Swattie," "give kids
like Billy Kraig the benefit of the doubt" and "focus on the
racism that more fundamentally affects the impoverished
and downtrodden of places like Chester."

After the panelists presented their views, the participants split into groups of six to discuss the issues presented. Each group elected a representative to present a short
summary of their discussion.
Taylor's comments garnered a lot of response. Many
participants argued that people should not take any racial
issues as petty and glance over them but should instead
use incidents such as the Halloween party to educate
Swarfhmore students who are "going places and might
affect the greater world" about greater issues.
"I am offended by the idea that by being here [at
Swarfhmore], we are divorced from our backgrounds, be it
poor or working-class," Chela Delgado 'O3 noted. "Personally,
I had an emotional response to [the blackface incident]."
When Chu commented that "emotional reactions are by
definition petty" and that everyone should try to respond
to these events objectively, the discussion grew even more
heated. Katrina Clark 'O3 said "whenever you respond to

something, it is going to be emotional." The discussion
expanded to include topics like whether violence would
ever be a justifiableresponse to racial offenses. As the discussion ran nearly a half-hour over its designated time,
the board members asked all participants to take theirdiscussions beyond the Ring and into the greater community.
Many who attended considered the discussion valuable.
"I'm very glad that I went," Matt Fiedler 'O6 said. But concerns were raised at the Ring board meeting last Monday

over whether all opinions were represented.
During the discussion, Krista Marshall 'O3 said,
"Sometimes I don't speak out on these issues because I don't
feel that I'm qualified, I don't want to hurt people inadvertently, or I don't want to be seen as racist, but by trying to
prevent people from getting hurt we're actually perpetuating racism." Board members noted that this comment
seemed to have opened up the discussion considerably and
encouraged those who were less vocal to speak out. Finally,
Anna Perng 'O3 made the note that maybe the ultimate goal
of the Ring is to build relationships between people who are
different and encourage discussion between them.

Prof. studies poll data to question the death of the old racism

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Despite laws banning discrimination, referenda show Southern whites still hold racist views
BY PREETY SIDHU
ssidhul@Swarthmore.edu
Laws banning interracial marriages were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in
1967. It is widely believed that white Americans have come
a long way toward eradicating racism against black
Americans in the several decades since. Why, then, did
nearly half of white voters in the states of South Carolina
and Alabama recently vote against symbolically removing
the null and void laws from their books? Philip A.
Klinkner, a professor of government at Hamilton College,
addressed that and other issues last Thursday in this year's
Charles Gilbert lecture, entitled "Is the Old Racism Dead?"
Klinkner began his lecture by explaining why he chose to
study the issue of racism through referenda. He claimed that
while whites often express racial hostility around other
whites with whom they are comfortable, it is hard to find
such overt expressions of racism in opinion polls. Whites

withracist views are likely to lie on such polls, to seem politically correct. When examining referenda over long periods
of time, however, Klinkner discovered a "gap between rhetoric and reality," between what whites are willing to express
and what they actually do. With only a very small number of
exceptions, whites have historically voted against civil
rights legislation when put to a referendum.
Klinkner also clarified what he meant by old and new

racism. The old racism was based on notions that black people were somehow biologically inferior, while the new more
laissez-faire racism is based on stereotypes, such as that black
people are lazy and less willing to work than white people.
The example on which Klinkner focused for the rest of
the lecture was the ban on interracial marriages. When the
Supreme Court declared such bans unconstitutional in
1967, most states immediately removed the laws from their
books. South Carolina and Alabama, however, only held
referenda to remove these statutes in 2000.
There were a couple of reasons for which Klinkner felt
these particular referenda were ideal for uncovering the

actual extent of racist attitudes and for checking the validity of social opinion polls. Support for not removing these
statutes, he said, is a clear indicator of racism, reflecting
no race-neutral factors such as might be considered on
issues like affirmative action. Also, the measure is purely
symbolic and its implementation would place no burden
on the citizens.
In both states, both houses of the legislature voted
unanimously to put the issue on the ballot, except for the
South Carolina House, in which four members were
opposed. Prior to the elections, almost no public voices
were raised supporting the ban. Even the mainstream
southern heritage movement, which supports causes like
openly flying the Confederate flag, was quiet on the issue.
Only an extremist faction that believed the South should
"rise again" spoke up in favor of the ban.
The polls declared that 84 percent of white southerners

opposed the ban. When the election results came in, however, the numbers in support of the ban were much higher. In
South Carolina 40 percent of whites and 32 percent of nonwhites voted not to remove the ban, while in Alabama 50 percent of whites and 11 percent of non-whites voted this way.
As the black populations in the two states do not significantly differ in political matters, the discrepancy in their
voting might have been due to voter confusion over the
wording of the proposal, which differed on the two ballots.
Klinkner concluded that these results are a clear indicator that the old, biological racism may not be dead. He
suggested that in fact these results may underestimate the
skew, because more educated people turn out to vote in
larger numbers. Counties with higher education

levels

generally voted to remove the ban. Whites from counties
with high concentrations ofblacks tended to vote strongly
in favor of retaining the ban.
Finally, Klinkner noted that there was little commentary on this issue in the local press after the elections.
Public officials, black leaders, and others like them did not
seem surprised by the results, and were rather just glad
that the movement passed.

Room last Thursday that the old racism is based on the

Plans for a renovated McCabe begin, with still no funds
More carrels will be added to third floor; WA center may be moved from Trotter to library
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu
Even in the midst of financial difficulties, the college cannot completely halt its
plans for large renovation projects. All ren-

ovations planned for McCabe Library have

been pushed back a year, but College
Librarian Peggy Seiden refuses to let this
stop her from gathering student input for
the project. Seiden presented the master
plans to Student Council at its meeting

of a media center.
This is the issue on which Seiden particuplanning is the creation

the library planning faculty committee is
made up of "traditional library users."
They have "very specific concepts of how
they use a library," she said. "To them, the

to the collections." She then, however,
expressed her concern that this might not

production a public place to work. There
will be private editing rooms and a larger

room that can be used either as a studio or
a video classroom.
The second floor was renovated in 2000,
so only a few changes will be made. The
library staff is considering moving the
Writing Center to McCabe, from Trotter. It
would consist of a few glassed-in rooms, a
larger office for the WA intern, and an open
area that could prove useful for workshops.

The renovations will take three summers of work and cost $6.6 million. The
main reason, Seidien said, was mechanical
systems.
But although replacing plumbing and
heating systems will prove expensive, the

a great deal as well, and none of this will
come cheap.
McCabe is in urgent need of renovations, Seiden said. "We need to do this." In
three years the library should be filled to
almost 90 percent of its capacity. To gain
more space, according to Seiden, library
administrators are looking into compact
shelving options. Since compact shelving
would inhibit airflow, new ventilation systems become even more crucial, especially
for dealing with summer humidity. In addition, the bathrooms need to be made ADA

compliant, and the issue of asbestos in the
paint needs to be addressed. If left

alone,
the asbestos might become a problem as

construction further disturbs it.

"To [traditional library users], the heart of the library is
the collections and nothing should be sacrificed when it
comes to the collections."
College Librarian Peggy Seiden
Seiden said plans call for compact shelving to be installed on the first floor. "In
order to accommodate the kind of growth
we are seeing in the library in terms of
books we need to maximize our shelving,"
Seiden said. The bound periodical and government document collections will be put
in these shelves because they are not often
browsed. The video collection and current
periodicals will be relocated to the first
floor. Video viewing will also be moved
there and will be much improved. There

will be individual video and audio carrels
and more group viewing room. The video
editing equipment currently in Beardsley
and LPAC will also be moved to this floor,

It would be open even when WAs weren't
there, and students could reserve the
offices, which could provide alternative
areas for doing computer-based work. The
honors collection would be moved from this
area to the southern side of McCabe. The
offices currently located there would be
removed, making room for new group study
areas. The librarians also hope to utilize
more laptops, so there will not be as many
officially designated computer spaces.
Surveys show that students feel most
comfortable in the private carrels along the
walls, according to Seiden, so more of these
will be added to the third floor. Also, part of
the northern wall on this floor will be

installed overlooking the rose garden. The
newspaper lounge will be removed, and as a
result more natural light will be able to
flow in from the window, since the stone
walls will no longer block it. The two existing group study rooms will be merged, and

walls installed to improve lighting,
along with two more group study rooms
that will be added. Since the large study
areas in the corners of this floor seem to be
underutilized, they will be removed.
The two group study rooms on the
fourth floor will also be merged and this
study area will be extended to the west
wall. The shelving currently in this area
will be relocated. The current video area
will also be renovated into a seating area.
Also, the Treasure Room will be turned
into an open reading room, providing students with even more studying area
options. The best pieces in the collection
will be displayed in glass cases, while the
less impressive items will be stored in condensed stacks. The computer center will
remain, but will be reconfigured into a "U"

design plans, Seiden added, would appreciate student input. "[We are going] to get
[plans] up on easels around the library so
people can look at them," she said. These
renovations will not become a reality in
the near future, but preparing for it is
something the staff of McCabe can't help
doing, and they are eager to do it right.

Blackboard usage grows, along with ways to use it
BY MANU PRADHAN

apradhal@swarthmore.edu

Perhaps surprising to many who are already familiar
with it, Blackboard has only been available at Swarthmore
for about three years. In that time, Blackboard has made
progress toward establishing itself as one of the school's
most important support services.
So what is Blackboard? A Web-based program that students and faculty use in a number of ways, on one level the
program simply works to help users stay organized; it
includes an online calendar, an address book and other
similar tools.
But Blackboard also offers tools to help people communicate. Matthew Wallaert 'O5, a computer science major
who has kept track of Blackboard's progress since he started working for Information Technology Services (ITS),
noted that the Dorm Support Technicians have their own
discussion hoard on Blackboard which they use "quite
extensively." This forum allows the technicians to report
problems such as virus outbreaks and to provide each
other with solutions.
Although some professors are only beginning to learn

about the capabilities of Blackboard, others have already
been using the program for some time now. When English
professor Elizabeth Bolton last offered her course on
Literature and the Grotesque, she attempted to enhance
classroom discussions by getting her students to talk about
readings on their own, using a discussion board created on
Blackboard. Bolton encouraged her students to post questions and thoughts and to respond to each other. Blackboard
automatically registers who makes any given post, so Bolton
said that she was able to keep track of who was posting and
make online participation a part of the overall grade.
Bolton commented that she found Blackboard extremely useful in getting students "revved up and thinking about

their work," saying that she also posted on the forum occasionally, making an effort not to dominate a discussion but
often "challenging individual points" or encouraging students to pursue specific ideas.
At the same time, however, her success was in some
ways limited. Bolton said it was often difficult for her to
find a way to incorporate ideas from the discussion board
into class discussions. Furthermore, Bolton noticed that
although students were excited at the beginning of the
semester, the number of posts per week tended to drop off
as time passed. Perhaps as a result of this experience,
Bolton suggested that the discussion forums could work
for larger classes of 25 or more, but that they would not
easily sustain themselves in classes with fewer people.
Despite Blackboard's limitations, more and more professors are acquainting themselves with the system, and

some
are using it in rather novel ways. History professor Marjorie

Murphy has been using Blackboard, in conjunction with the
software Dreamweaver, to organize a "nationally based primary source project" with students from her course on
Women, Society and Politics. The students from her class are
researching documents mostly found in the Peace
Collection. In addition to the work for the course, Murphy's
students have the option of writing special introductions
and footnotes for the documents. When all the documents

have been compiled, they will be published along with the
introductions and footnotes written by her students.
Murphy said the discussion boards have been useful in
encouraging her students to interact outside the classroom.
She addedd that "it gives me a chance to
help my students
do a more thorough research job."
Wallaert affirmed that an increasing number of professors are using Blackboard for their classes. Wallaert said
that the statistics on professors using Blackboard for their
...

classes are "quite positive" given how recently the program
was introduced at Swarthmore. He stated that trends indi-

History professor Marjorie Murphy has been using the

Blackboard system to create a primary source database
for her class, "Women, Society and Politics."
cate professors will be using the program "more and more."
Wallaert also suggested that ITS has been pleased with
usage so far, and said that one reason why Blackboard is not
as popular as it could be is a possible "generational gap."
"Some professors approach [new technologies] with

timidity because of their own reservations," he said, pointing out that for ITS, the next step is to ensure professors
attain their "maximal comfort level" with the program so
its usage can become even more widespread. "It won't be
long until most classes are on Blackboard," he continued,
and put forward that the program could soon phase out EReserves, an earlier program which also allows professors
to post readings online.

Students join 10,000 to protest 'terror' school
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu
Thirty-three hours in a cramped bus is not
the way mostpeople would choose to spend a
weekend. But each year a group of about 30
students from Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr and
Haverford do just that to attend the School of
the Americas (SOA) protest in Georgia.
These students joined the estimated
6,000 to 10,000 protestors on Sunday, where
the scene was part carnival, part funeral.
People dressed up in bright colors, as suns
and doves, glided above the crowd on stilts.
Others lay motionless on the ground covered in red-stained black cloths to represent those tortured and killed under
repressive regimes in Latin America.
According to SOA Watch, the human
rights organization which organizes the
protest, the SOA is a school located on the
property of Ft. Benning, Ga., that trains
Latin American leaders and military personnel in methods of oppression and torture. They cite the school's graduates as
responsible for many massacres and disappearances of people in countries from

Guatemala to Argentina.
"A bill was brought before the House of
Representatives in the mid-'9os to try to
eliminate [the SOA], but the bill failed by
about 10-20 votes," explained Harris
Kornstein 'O6, who attended the protest.
"They later changed the name to the
Western Hemispheric Institute for Security
Cooperation (WHINSEC)" in order to try to
divert attention from the issue.
The majority of Swarthmore students
attending the protest had never protested
at the SOA before. Most were glad they had
made the trip. "I'm really glad that I finally got to go to the SOA protest and to have
the opportunity to publicly oppose the
school and the destructive United States
foreign policy that it represents," Maria
Alvarez 'O4 said. "The United States thinks

THE PHOENIX

that it can control the governments and

actions of Latin American nations, and in
this process, has been complicit in the torture, rape and murder of countless people."
But Alvarez's opinion is not universally
shared; others, even at Swarthmore, find
compelling reasons to support the SOA.

"The United States
has
been complicit in the torture, rape and murder of
countless people."
Maria Alvarez 'O4
...

Olivia Toro 'O5 is critical of SOA Watch's

opinion of the school. "I have always compared WHINSEC to the United States
Command and General Staff College (CGSC),
located in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas," she
said. "The purpose of CGSC is to provide
officers in the United States military with
specialized leadership training; these are the
men and women who will go on to take command positions at military bases."
She sees the school as a place "to pro-

vide Latin American officers who excel
with the opportunity to observe the workings of the United States military. These
officers are educated in the proper treatment of soldiers, counterintelligence, logistical and tactical intelligence, and the
humane treatment of civilians and prisoners, etc. Human rights education has
always been a component of the curriculum at the school now more than ever."
-

The protest's organizers, out of respect
for the weight of this issue, take time to
carefully plan the protest. All of Saturday is
spent orienting people to the issue and making sure the crowd understands the logistics
of the march: "It's a two-day shebang," said

Komstein, "The first day had tons of political speakers discussing a whole range of
aspects of the SOA & troubles in Latin
America: FTAA, trade, personal stories
about the death of family members."
Kornstein was struck by the emotional
visual pageantry. "People carry crosses
with the names of people who have been
killed or 'disappeared' while the organizers
chant the names of all those people and
everyone replies chanting 'presente'. This
was a huge procession that led past the
fence that was put up at the base last year.
People hung their crosses and other banners all along the fence creating this beautiful memorial. The whole procession probably took about 4 hours."
Most protesters choose to show their
willingness to commit civil disobedience
by stepping over the white painted line
that marks Fort Benning's property, technically trespassing. But military guards
take no action against protesters until they
cross the barbed wire fence a few yards further on; this year about 90 people climbed
over the fence. They were calmly arrested
by the guards while other protesters looked
on and cheered. Those arrested will spend

Joanna Taylor 'O5, who helped organize

the trip, is enthusiastic about the protest

precisely because she believes it promotes
real understanding. The protestors even
communicated with the
citizens of
Columbus, Ga. who support the SOA. "There
was genuine listening and trying to understand going on between the two sides," she
said. "I think that the ability of people from
the demonstration to go and try to engage
the Columbus residents in dialogue really
speaks to the nature of the movement people really believe in what they're protesting
and know enough to try to convince someone else of their point. Also, when we engage
in dialogue with people who disagree with
us, we break down the barriers and stereotypes between the parties."
Despite current debate at Swarthmore
over social activism and its efficacy, and a
lack of media coverage at the protest, most
who attended this protest came away with
the feeling that real communication about
the SOA had occurred.

Divestment campaigns targeting Israel grow in popularity

consideration. "The conditions of widespread campus support and extensive review have not been realized in this
case," he said.

The Democratic Solidarity Committee at University of
Illinois may only have eight core members, but they have a
big goal: to end Israel's occupation of Palestine. Their strategy: laying on economic pressure by convincing their
administration to end investment in Israel. Lauren Ray, a
junior who signed onto the campaign last year, spends her

Administrators at University of Illinois have likewise
ignored the Democratic Solidarity Committee's efforts
thus far, Ray said.
Yet lack of administrative support has not dampened
divestment efforts; more and more campuses are signing onto
the cause. Students at the University of Pennsylvania kicked
off their campaign earlier this semester, when Noam
Chomsky spoke on campus and became the first signer of
their petition. Angela Migally, a law student and a coordinator of the campaign, hopes the University's administration
will break the trend.
"We're not doing anything radical," Migally said. "We
just don't want the university to profit off human rights

Thursday afternoons on the quad handing out fliers and carrying signs for a "silent picket" of campus financial policy.
"Our goal is to get the university to divest from corporations doing business in Israel," said Ray, a political science major. "We would hope that they would continue to
divest until the end of the occupation."
Ray and her U of I co-picketers are not alone. As the situation in Israel/Palestine heats up, students across the
country are tackling the issue with a close-to-home spin—as close as the campus financial investment office. College
divestment campaigns, popularized in the 'Bos, when hundreds of campuses cut off their investments in apartheidladen South Africa, are now mostly targeting investments
in Israel.
Divest-from-Israel campaigns like U of I's have started
up at Harvard, MIT, Princeton, University of Michigan and
the university system in California. Some, like University
of Illinois', are entirely student-run, others, like Tufts',
were started by professors. The campaigns share similar
goals and similar rhetoric, comparing the situation in
Israel to the South African apartheid regime. And so far,
they have shared a similar fate: no administration has yet
agreed to divest from Israel, and several—such as those at
Harvard and University of Michigan—have spoken out
publicly against the divestment campaigns.
"Harvard is first and foremost a center of learning, not
an institutional organ for advocacy on such a complex and

controversial international conflict, Harvard President
Lawrence H. Summers said recently, in a statement
responding to the Harvard-MIT divestment petition.
Gary Krenz, special counsel to the president at
University of Michigan, says that the university does not
plan to take steps toward divestment any time soon. "The
process by which divestment decisions have been reached
in the past has set a very high bar for this sort of decision,"
Krenz said. The University has divested only twice in its
history: from South Africa in the 1980s and from tobacco
stocks in 2000. According to Krenz, the divest-from-Israel
campaign has not reached the proportions necessary for

'Spanglish' moves into
mainstream U.S. culture
(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, Texas
You may
have heard words like "troca," "lipisticiado"
and "watchando," and while they may sound
like Spanish words, they are actually not.
Considered by some to be a dialect,
Spanglish is now spoken by more than 35
million Hispanics in the United States and
characterizes the language style of Spanish
radio stations on the border.
Historically, Spanglish has mainly been
spoken within Spanish-speaking communities. However, its expansion is indicated by
President Bush's reference to "Reverendo
Dios" in an Oct. 31 speech in Miami.
Spanglish is now being utilized by politicians across the nation to reach the growing Spanish-speaking population, the
Associated Press reports.
Joel F. Sherzer, an anthropology professor, said Spanglish refers to the varieties of
Spanish spoken in the United States, which
include borrowed words from English. It can

also refer to the systematic exchange
between Spanish and English in conversation, known in linguistics as code switching.
While language experts and Spanish
speakers said they recognized Spanglish as

Many divestment campaigns have met with strong campus opposition from opposite-minded students. At Harvard
and MIT, pro-Israel students campaigned against divestment and created an anti-divestment Web site. The

Harvard Crimson ran an anti-divestment editorial. And
many campus Hillel groups are organizing full-scale

invest-in-Israel campaigns.
Samantha Rollinger, a senior at University of Michigan
and two-year chair of the American Movement for Israel,
recently coordinated a Hillel rally around the oft-quoted slogan, "Wherever we stand, we stand with Israel."
"The push for divestment on my campus and around the
country is nothing more than a racist attempt to delegitimize
Israel," Rollinger said. "I stand with Hillel in support of
investment in Israel." Pro-Israel groups at University of
Pennsylvania and University of Illinois have also linked
divestment with anti-Semitism, Amigally and Ray said.

With formidable student opposition and most administrators turning a blind eye, campus divestment campaigns are up
against the odds—that is, if divestment is actually their goal.

Walters, however, said the reaction

High self-esteem can be
deadly, study says
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK, Md.
Low
self-esteem is not an excuse for personal
and social problems, and high self-esteem
could actually lead to dangerous behavior,
according to a new study by psychologists.
Contrary to popular modern teaching
methods, which have driven teachers in all
grade levels to reinforce self-confidence in
students, grades and other behavior are
not directly correlated to self-esteem.
High self-esteem is not directly linked to
good behavior and the reverse is also true,
said professors Brad J. Bushman of lowa
State University and Roy F. Baumeister of
Case Western Reserve University.

The researchers performed two experiments earlier this year to determine the
effects

of

self-esteem

on

behavior.

For some campaign leaders, like physics professor Ken Olum
at Tufts, garnering attention for the issue is the main objective.
"The goal is to keep the issue in the public eye," Olum

said. "It's to call attention to the fact that what Israel is
doing is wrong, and very much like what the white rulers
of South Africa were doing." Olum does not see divestment
in Tufts' future, but this has not stopped him from starting
up a divestment petition, as well as www.israeldivest.org,
a Web site for campus divestment campaigns.
Clearly, different campuses put different spins on the issue
of divestment. In fact, some 'tiivest-from-Israel" campaigns
are not just about Israel. At University of Pennsylvania, the
focus is both narrower and broader.
"We're not calling for the divestment of companies that
do any business with Israel," Amigally said. "We're calling
for divestment from companies that promote the occupation: arms dealers, for example." In addition, the Penn
campaign will address investments in human rights abuses worldwide, in countries like Columbia, Turkey and
Egypt. Amigally stressed that the campaign's objective is
to stop Penn from investing in companies with a record of
human rights abuses. The group's short-term goal is to
establish a committee to review investment in these cor-

porations.

Other campuses are putting the focus on investment,
rather than divestment. At Williams College, a coalition of
students recently negotiated an agreement with their
administration, allowing for a Social Choice fund to which
alumni can choose to contribute when they give to the college. Ninety percent of the fund's money will be invested in
socially screened funds
those that block out certain corporations that manufacture something considered controversial, like arms manufacturers, or those that have unfair
labor policies, etc., in favor of more socially responsible
investments with the remainder going toward community investment. Mike Levein, a Williams graduate who
helped spearhead the campaign, stresses the advantages of
their campaign over the divestment-oriented approach.
"Divestment is piecemeal," he said. "I'm not saying it's
bad—but how do you pick when there's so many corporations
that should be targeted? We wanted to have the college proactively pick its investments in a socially responsible way"
Whatever the focus, investment-targeted movements are
gaining popularity on college campuses. Ray, like many student divestment activists, hopes that this is just the beginning. "I don't think divestment will happen any time soon,"
she said. "But it's a good platform from which to bring attention to this issue, and, in a few years who knows?"

Participants were asked to write essays,

From INVESTING, pg. 3
in the words of Vice President for
Finance and Treasurer Sue
Welsh, "to be active, responsible
shareholders where and when we

can." She added that the committee decides to be more or less
active based largely on student
involvement. Such involvement,
however, usually requires a great

deal of outside research on the
part of interested students.
The Lockheed Martin shareholder resolution the college
introduced last year, calling for a
company policy banning discrimination on the basis of same-sex
relationships, is an example of the
CSRI attempting to meet its goals.
Though the resolution was defeated at the end of last spring, Welsh
said Swarthmore resubmitted the
resolution just last week. "Our
intention is to keep pressing with
this," she added. "Winning is the
goal, or getting them to adopt [the
resolution's objectives] as policy."
But while shareholder resolutions can make some progress,
Bussey said they were not an adequate solution.
"What do you do when the
company you're invested in
makes arms?" she asked. "Do you
really think you can present a resolution to get them to stop doing
that? Shareholderresolutions can
have some effect, but they don't

make as large a statement and
they don't have the power to
make the statement that this is
not the kind of thing we want to
be making our money from."
The college's endowment has
fallen nearly $l5O million since
September 2000, when it inched
above $1 billion for the first time.
The national recession and turbulent stock market are mainly to

blame for the decline. Gifts by
donors, funds allocated by the college, and accumulated interest,
dividends and capital appreciation all contribute to the endowment's total.
Last year was a financially disappointing one for the college. The
college aims for a 5.75 percent annual rate of return (excluding inflation) from the endowment. But during the 2000-2001 fiscal year, the
endowment declined by 3.4 percent.
The year before, it increased by 31
percent, and 8.3 percent the year
before. Over the last 30 years, the
return has been 7.2 percent.
Despite the recent drop, Welsh

insisted Swarthmore's endowment is fairing better than other,
similar endowments, largely due

to

its diverse holdings. "Even

though the stock market is going
down, we are doing better than if
we were just invested in an indi-

vidual fund," she said.

In 1979, the college further
decided to adopt a multi-manager
structure, to diversify its holdings even further. As of June 30 of
this year, the college's endowment had 47 percent of its holdings invested in publicly traded

(domestic

the skateboarders had a "negative impact
on customers" and that some were worried
about lawsuits resulting from skateboarders injuring themselves on their properties.
Jacobs also said pedestrians had complained that the skateboarders were "not
yielding the right of way," and that some
were unsure whether the skateboarders
were capable of stopping. Some residents,
she said, had complained about the noise.
There was also concern about damages
resulting from "tricks done on town infrastructure," and the railing at the
Swarthmore public library skateboarders
used had to be repaired several times.
But Farrell said the town engineer disagreed that skateboarding caused damage,

resident, told a different story. "Nobody is
ever negative," he said. "Just yesterday I
was skating by the bank, and this old man
asked me to show him some tricks. I almost

Murray was a little baffled by the complaints about the noise. "I thought that was

Ville resident and 12-year-old Kevin Murray
David Farrell wasn't as positive. He said
it didn't surprise him that the Council wanted to ban skateboarding. "It kind of seemed
like something they would have done," he
said, noting an "intolerant attitude" he feels
prevailing in the town. "One time I was
skating on this bench and some guy started
yelling at me to get off the bench." Farrell
said he yelled back, '"I live in this town too.
Why don't you mind your own business?'"
David was also skeptical about the proposed compromise of putting the same
restrictions on skateboarding as bicycles,
which means he has to stay off the sidewalk
and skate on the right side of the road. "On
the right side of the road you can't see what's
behind you," he said. "It's dangerous."
Barbara Porcelli, another mother of a
15-year-old skateboarder who spoke at the
meeting, agreed. "It's much better if
they're in the center of town where we can
see them.... I just want to create a nice
environment," she said. "I know that 15-

the skateboarders took their stand, the
town raised property taxes by six percent
to cover increasing municipal costs. Jacobs
said that the Borough has historically
spent very little on recreation. "I don't
think there would be much popular support for a skate park."
But Farrell and others disagreed. "We
don't really know what it costs yet," Mary
Farrell said.
One Council member, Alice Willits, has

been working on it for years. "We have a
basketball court for basketball and a football
field for football. These kids should have
something," she said. At one point Willits
tried to block off a short street for every
weekend for the skateboarders, but "not one
parent would supervise," she said. Now
she's talking to local contractors, trying to
get them to volunteer to do some of the work.
"I have a lead," she said. "You can't keep
kids out of this town."

Willie Nelson take on "Willow Weep

Fishman and Billy Martin and sometime Bjork-harpist Zeena Parkins also
stop by for a track or two. The difficulty with a "melting pot" ensemble like
this, apart from the question of its
audience, is finding a vocabulary to
discuss it. Some of the most immediate points of reference are film music.
Consider the album opener "Bill,"
in which a series of spare, raspy guitar noodles, straight out of a drygulch execution scene in a spaghetti
western, give way to a lovely accordion-driven waltz that would fit right
in on the "Amelie" soundtrack. This is
certainly cinematic music. But it's
much more than that, and it deserves
to stand on its own terms, with as
large an audience as it can find.

7.5/10

Two years after Daft Punk dropped the 1997
minimalist bombastic-house manifesto
"Homework," Cassius refined that record's primitivist energy and puristic four-on-the-floor-isms into
a sophisticated disco of endless variation, with the
anonymous masterpiece "1999."
It took even less time for this other French
house duo to respond to last year's Daft Punk
resurgence, "Discovery"— only a year and a half
later, and now we have "Au Reve."
Now, I'm not trying to suggest that Cassius are
tagging along on the Punkers' robotic coat-tails; I'm
just noting a pattern in the timing of their album
releases, which may explain D.P.'s greater notoriety. Following the prevailing current (also evinced
on the most recent outings by Basement Jaxx and
The Chemical Brothers), the new record has the
treble turned up way higher than its predecessor,
and it offers an embarrassment of vocals (all but
six of these tracks feature guest vocalists), harkening back more than ever to the sheen and shimmer of the original disco era, but also persistently
reflecting the more sophisticated dance-pop of the
1980s, with walls and walls of synth burbles.
Trendspotting notwithstanding, the Cassius hallmarks are still here: dense layering, experimentation, sheer quality and plentitude of original beats,
and of course unabashed danceability.
The entire disc is fantastic dance-floor fodder,
but check especially lead singles "I'm A Woman"
(which riffs on the Temptations' "Get Ready") and
"The Sound of Violence," infectious slabs of highNRG house that for some reason both open with
inexplicable hair-metal guitar blasts a la "When
Doves Cry." Elsewhere (the gospel-tinged "Till We
Got You and Me," the percolator-hop of "Thrilla"
featuring Ghostface Killah) Cassius seem to be
feeling the brunt of the recent "electro-clash" fad,
but their takes are far more complex and melodic
than the too-often tedious excuse for a genre. The
funk into the punk, indeed.

Contrary to the Sony Classical publicity tagline for this
release, the "one classical album everyone should own"
is, as everyone knows, that London Weekend Classics
cassette of the Carnival of the Animals and Pictures at
an Exhibition. If you have room for more than one classical record in your collection, however, this is indeed a
faultless second choice. J.S. Bach's piano music, for all
its incontestable genius, is often stigmatized as mechanical and drily intellectual, its rigorous counterpoint as stifling all emotion. The Goldberg Variations, a set of thirty
variations on a simple aria, certainly has its share of
technically mindblowing compositional intricacies, but it
also affords great opportunity for interpretive expression,
and in the right hands can be truly transcendent. Glenn
Gould is legendary for his interpretation of Bach, and
this piece, more than any other, truly belongs to him.

their running time: the vibrantly virtuousic early recording

Troubadour protests war, eats pizza
BY KATE DUFFY

kduffyl@swarthmore.edu

Joseph Camuglia doesn't march in rallies, call politicians or hand out pamphlets to protest the war. He sings
about pizza, as he has been doing in pizza parlors around
the world for nearly 20 years.
Camuglia, 45, a soft-spoken man with long hair and an
acoustic guitar, first decided to become a pizza troubadour because he "was hungry." His flagship tune, "The
Pizza Song," conveys a simple yet earnest message: "let's
make pizza, not nuclear bombs." That sentiment has
earned him free slices all over the country for the last 20
years.

Despite technical hindrances, an album featuring
"The Pizza Song" is nearing completion; when
Camuglia's own recording equipment malfunctions, he
records tracks on his answering machine message
instead. Other current projects include a web page
(www.letsmakepizza.com) and a documentary chronicling
pizza emporium stints.
I iiiljjimipted a recording session in Camuglia's
Kentudirhome to pose a few questions.

What exacHy is your pizza parlor project?
It's
ifeally a project. I sing "The Pizza Song" and all
my soQjflfe wherever I can, and pizza places seem to be a
good pjjtjfe to do that. What better place to sing "The Pizza

How does it go?
"There's an easy solution to the problems of this world
I think it may have been mentioned once before
Instead of making cruise missiles and bombs
Let's start making pizza for everyone.
I'm sure if you compare the cost
You'll say it's a whole lot better investment
To buy a bunch offlour and sauce

And let's make pizza, not nuclear bombs."
It has a couple names. It's called "Let's Make Pizza," but
it is also known as "The Pizza Song." The interesting thing
about that is I met someone recently in New Hampshire
who told me there's another song called "The Pizza Song,"
but it's totally different than mine.

Why did you start singing "The Pizza Song"?
I was in New York City, and I heard about a group called
Food Not Bombs, so it just took a little twist from there to
get Pizza Not Bombs. Then I happened to be in Boston. I
was learning about being a subway singer. It was around
December of 1982. And there are a lot of pizza shops in
Boston, and pizza seemed like a good idea.

In how many parlors have you played?
I would say close to 100. That doesn't sound like a lot. I
haven't played a lot in the last five years, but from 1982
until 1997,1 was a troubadour. So I went into a lot of restaurants to barter for my food. I'd say that a third of the time,

BAD CREDIT IS LIKE A BAD NICKNAME.
IT WILL STICK WITH YOU FOR YEARS.

the restaurants were hip to having me play music for a
meal. So a lot of times, if I found a restaurant or pizza shop
that was cool, I might go back another time in the week, so
I didn't have to hit any others. I'm just getting back to gigging again, because for the last five years I've been a stayat-home dad.
What's your favorite pizza parlor?
Hmm. Probably my favorite pizza shop would be Pizza
Town in Marlboro, New York, my hometown. I've known
the pizza guy there for almost 30 years. He makes a good

pizza.

What has been your best experience?
That's a hard one, because I've had a lot of great experiences. [One] was when I was in Colorado this year,
recording "The Pizza Song." Me and the producer and the
co-producer, we went to a pizza shop. I went up to the fellow making pizza, and I said, "Hey, you want to hear 'The

Pizza Song'?" He said, "Sure." So I took out my guitar and
played it for this fellow. Then he said, "How about I make
you a pie?" So he made me and the fellows there a whole
pizza pie, and it was a great experience.
Have you had any terrible experiences?
One thing comes to my mind. I was singing at an Italian
restaurant during the Gulf War in '9L I don't know if the
war had started then or not, but it was right around that
time. After I played "The Pizza Song" for about 100 people
who were enjoying the music, a friend of mine stood up
and said, "Doesn't he look like an Iraqi?" The atmosphere
totally changed. Totally.
Other than that, there have been no bad experiences.
Well, I was in a bar in Chicago, and there was someone
who was pretty upset that I played "The Pizza Song." He
was actually more upset because I had this T shirt that
said "Let's make pizza," and it has an eagle on it eating a
pizza. He thought it was unpatriotic to have an eagle eating pizza on there. He probably had too many drinks.

Do you play in every pizza parlor you come across,' or
do you have a more discerning method?
If I see a neon light that says "Open," then I feel like
maybe they're open
hearted, that is. Then I go in. You
get a gut-level feel. I go into most, but sometimes you sense
that one isn't right.
...

How far have you traveled?
I've played "The Pizza Song" in India. I've been to Nepal
and Mexico. And I've been to just about every state east of
Colorado.
How did the reactions of people in India compare with
in the United States?
The people in India loved "The Pizza Song." I played at
a Domino's in Bombay, and they loved it.

Do you ever play with a band?
My group is called Average American Dreamers.
Everybody can join. So when people ask how many members are in my band, I'll say thousands. It's a trip, you
know. It's a good thing. It's a sing-along kind of thing

Ghost of Nirvana comes back with trademark anger in unreleased 'You Know You're Right'
BY AARON WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu

It's only one song at three minutes and
35 seconds, it's not even that long. But somehow Nirvana's new track has caused the
biggest musical controversy sincethe band's
1991 song "Smells Like Teen Spirit." The
band itself has not existed since lead singer
Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994; the song, "You
Know You're Right," was released for the
first time three weeks ago as part of the
band's greatest-hits collection, simply titled
"Nirvana."
Originally, the song was to be released in
August 2001 as part of a career-spanning box
set to commemorate the 10th anniversary of
the release of "Nevermind." The retrospective would have featured many unheard
tracks, approximately two CDs worth (and
there are still about three more CDs worth of
songs lying around in the vaults). Most are
rough sketches and demos, but "You Know
You're Right" is the trump card. It was
recorded during the group's final recording
session with Adam Kasper in the last week
of January 1994, shortly before Kurt Cobain

committed suicide. It's the centerpiece for a
reason.
If the "MTV Unplugged" session is now
interpreted as an overt chronicle of Cobain's
death wish (all the cover songs selected contemplated suicide), "You Know You're
Right" moves into even grimmer territory.
The song takes its time, beginning with a
faint introduction and then moving into an
almost gothic bass line that gives way to
drumming that tempts you to think David

Grohl is the main source of Nirvana's raw

energy. The tone indicates that this song
alone could comprise the band's black
album.
And then there are Cobain's vocals; rock
'n' roll has never had a more imitated voice.
For the past 10 years, every "modern rock"
lead singer has tried to copy its textures and
cadences, but all have failed. The way his
voice wraps itself around words and then
chooses to seethingly release them or let
them fly away unpronounced is chilling.
The lyrics begin, "I will never follow you.
I will never promise to. I will never follow
you. I will never bother you." This is suicide
and social isolation at its bleakest. It ends

with Cobain singing, "Things have never
been so swell, I've never failed to fail," then
wailing "Pain" three times and finally grimacing through 17 recitations of "You know
you're right." His slip into the second person
is intriguing. It could be Cobain giving in to

12

Courtney Love, then his wife, or to his fans
or it could be an omniscient narrator
whispering nothings into Cobain's ear, urging him to pull the trigger. Unfortunately,
Cobain leaves himself no time to contemplate as he rides his guitar along an expressway to your skull, creating a sonic maelstrom that leaves everything in shambles.
Be thankful such tortured beauty is available at all; Courtney Love tried her hardest
to prevent this song's release.
After Cobain's death, Nirvana's remaining members, bassist Krist Novoselic and
Grohl, and Love formed an LLC to manage
Nirvana's legacy. Novoselic and Grohl, with-

from the haunting "MTV Unplugged" session and three tracks from "Bleach" and

"Incesticide."

Although it's easy to complain that the

"new" album only has one "new" track and
the trump card is played to open the album,
at the very least the new release provides an
excuse to listen to Nirvana's older material
again and to remind yourself of how bril-

liant it was. There is no greater musical
moment in history than when the stutterstep guitar of "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
opens up into a full bombast as Cobain turns
his amp way up and Grohl comes crashing
down into his drum set. Yes, it sounds like
every Pixies song ever written, but when
Cobain disturbingly swallows "Hello" after
"Hello" and rails through the chorus with
such reckless abandon, he infuses it with a
level of emotion that neither Black Francis
nor any other musician in history could

accomplish.

Nirvana

"Nirvana" (Universal 2002)
out Love's input, proved they were up to the
task with the underrated release of the 1997
live disc "From the Muddy Banks of the

Wishkah."
But when the retrospective was about to
be released, Love objected, saying the contract was null and void because she was too
strung out on heroin at the time she signed
it. She also argued that as the widow ofKurt
Cobain, the band's primary songwriter, she
should have more say in the selection
process than the former band members

themselves. She thought a best-of collection
with the one new song would be more profitable than a box set and would carry on the
legacy more effectively.
The album was originally scheduled for
release during the holiday gift-giving season, but then "You Know You're Right" was
leaked to the Internet on September 23rd and
all label hell broke loose. A month later,
unsurprisingly, the album is here. In addition to "You Know You're Right," it features
four tracks each from the renowned albums
"Nevermind" and "In TJtero," two tracks

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" may have been
the touchstone cultural moment, but every
other track is still nearly as fantastic. "Come
As You Are" has a surprisingly slinky bass
line; "All Apologies" is heartfelt longing at
its finest; "The Man Who Sold the World" is
quite possibly the finest cover performance
ever; and "About a Girl" has the same chord
changes and teenage lust of any Beatles song
written prior to 1966, it's just wearing a flannel shirt. When it came to songwriting,
Cobain had "it."
And then there's "Rape Me," which is a
fairly disturbing number but provides a
great example of how Nirvana embodied the
entire punk aesthetic. At the 1993 MTV
Video Music Awards, the group was set to
perform; Cobain had just written this song,
which would appear a year later on "In
Utero," and wanted to perform it. However,
considering the title and that "Lithium" was
the hit single at the time, the executives
balked and Cobain acquiesced.
Nevertheless, the performance began
with the three opening measures of "Rape
Me" before the band ferociously launched
into "Lithium." It gets better; to conclude,
Novoliselic threw his bass 20 feet into the
air, but failed to catch it. It smacked him
square in the forehead and he started to
stagger around the stage clutching his face.
Shockingly enough, this actually fit within
the performance's context, but really he'd
opened a huge gash that needed stitches
after the show. Simultaneously, Cobain was
feeding his guitar through every monitor he
could find and left the stage by climbing over
the speaker system. Grohl completely

November 21^2002

trashed his drum kit and then wandered out
to the front of the stage, grabbed the microphone and in an eerie voice said, "Hi Axl. Hi
Axl," which was directed at Guns Roses'
lead singer Axl Rose, who supposedly, before
the show, had a bizarre backstage confrontation with Cobain, Love and their daughter
&

Frances Bean.
Find a tape of this; no better live performance exists. It shows how the band's
members, particularly Cobain, could infuse
their songs with such urgent and priceless
energy and then totalize it in every aspect of
their lives. It was magnetic; it proved how
music could be an inspirational, commanding, serious force.
And now it's all gone; yes, the best-of has
reintroduced Nirvana into the public's conscience again, but for how long will the band
remain there? In 1994, Cobain had 15 million
15-40-year-olds sincerely adoring him, and he
chose to throw it all away by putting a gun
in his mouth because he couldn't deal with

success.

Ever

wonder

how

Justin

Timberlake is allowed to parade a solo
"album" around town? Look at Cobain and

then remember that he's dead. Thenlisten to
"You Know You're Right." If he had decided
to stick around for even just one more album
with that song, Timberlake would still be
working in an "Aladdin" stage show at
Disneyland.

Nowadays, Cobain is always cited as the
second most influential force in rock 'n' roll
(next to John Lennon or Elvis Presley, take
your pick). But look around the current
musical landscape and ask whom has
Cobain really influenced.
The Strokes and The White Stripes
proved that leather and slumming through
the '7os are cooler pursuits than championing 'Bos Northwest indie-rock bands, Avril

Lavigne spells "skater" as "skBr" and "boy"
as "boi" and Christina Aguliera and Britney
Spears prove that sexy equals skanky. The
only band that sounds moderately influenced by Nirvana is The Vines, which sullies the name, considering that their lead
singer Craig Nicholls carries a bong around
like it's Linus' blanket and that they finished their performance on the "Late Show
with David Letterman" rolling around the
set at the Ed Sullivan Theater.

Just think about that for a second.
Cobain could still be permanently changing
modern culture on a daily basis, and now he
can only be remembered through fleeting,

posthumous glimpses.
This is tragedy in one of its highest

forms.

Have some cawfee. we'll tawk, no big whoop
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollinsl@swarthmore.edu

"Oh my God! We're being interviewed! We just had a cartoon in last week's edition, too! Ah, publicity!"
"It's like that show, Katie! You know
actor's something
the one with the guy with the beard! That's us!"
"Are we gonna be on the front page?"
"Urn..." I said."... I don't th..."
"That's okay, hon. Ask away!"

Meet Katie and Michelle. The Kohlberg coffee bar ladies.
Like the all the greats: Prince, Madonna, Sting and Osama,
they don't have last names. So don't ask.
Katie and Michelle have been at Swarthmore as long as
liberalism. WeU, maybe not quite that long. Katie's been in
Dining Services at Swarthmore for 10 years and has worked
at Kohlberg for three years. Michelle has put in nine years
at Swarthmore in Dining Services and has been brewing at
Kohlberg for five years.
So what's a day in the life of a Kohlberg lady like?
"BUSY!" Katie says. "I can barely breathe between the
hours of 8:30 and 1:30
SHOW ME THE CARD, HON! The
usual?" Between 1:30 and 2:15, the Kohlberg ladies stock the
bar for the nightly caffeine frenzy. "We breathe then.
Sometimes we even talk to each other! Could you imagine!"
And the most popular drink?
Must I ask? Give you a hint. Begins with "C" and ends
with "hai."
Which brings me to the question that has been itching at
...

"Oh my God, I just revealed our
secret! Don't publish this! Katie!!!
I revealed our secret!"
my brain since September: What makes their chai the
absolute best in the world? It's been called "ethereal," "the
mother of all chais" (Which leads a person to ask: how does
one pluralize "chai"?), "a hug in a cardboard cup," "better
than sex." People flock from around the globe to Kohlberg for
their morning chai.
Being the sparkling incarnation of Woodward and
Bernstein's love child, only more talented (okay, the sum of
my journalistic experience has been three months at The
Phoenix, but hey, it's Swarthmore three months here is at
least 30 years anywhere else, right?), I followed my journalistic instinct and asked to see what in the world goes into
chai. Michelle plopped a huge tub of sweet smelling powder
labeled "East India Spice" in front of me.

revealed our secret!"
"The Swarthmore community is great," Katie says with a
smirk. "No, really! They're fun and friendly, casual people.
We occasionally get a pushy kid, but I guess you get that anywhere."
Yes, even the coffee bar operators uphold Quaker values
here. "Everybody over there is equal," says Michelle, pointing to the other side of the counter. "No one takes priority
here, well, except for him, he called me beautiful."
"I can't tell who's who anyway, so administration gets no
preference over students," says Michelle. Step aside, Mr.
Bloom, this chai's for me. "I mean, I guess we always have
those special people that we see every day and that we consider special. We have the Kohlberg Council (a group of faculty that meet every morning in Kohlberg for coffee),
Shirley, and of course Perry. He gives us a shoutout on the
radio every Wednesday."
"Don't forget Motorcycle Ruth!" Katie screams over the
latte machine.
"Oh yeah, Motorcycle Ruth. She's a hoot, but we love 'em

all."

By 2:30 every day, Michelle and Katie have gone home,
and caffeine-injecting Swatties take over once again. The
sounds of "Keep the line moving!" and "Show me the card!"
are gone, and soft rock takes over for the night.
Katie and Michelle have become Swarthmore legends in
their short time here.

They even have Swarthmore traditions of their own:

"The best part of my job is definitely the fact that I can see
Dash for Cash every year," says Katie, smiling. "I love that

tradition."

Column: Sex and the Swattie

Beyond vanilla
Thisis the second in a series of columns by various Swarthmore voices
about the subject of sex. One or more of the columnists featured in this
section may be hired to write this column next semester, so let us
know what you think at phoenix@swarthmore.edu.

swalshl@swarthmore.edu

In one of my favorite movies of all time, Woody Allen once said, "Don't
knock masturbation, it's sex with someone I love." Right then I knew I

Su Wu's Style
Fashion is a misshapen, malforming disease. It
inevitably makes hypocrites of otherwise astutely
self-reflective people.
It is, as someone with just as much misplaced

conviction as myself once claimed, "all pseudoinnovative ineptitude, imitation, neurotic regres-

sion and hypocrisy."
That being said, it also constitutes my most
pronounced obsession with the tragically banal.
I'm not going to pretend like I have any fucking
answers on how to fix your fucking ugly face, or
on how to solve your love problems or anything
like that. I'm just going to make up some questions that I think someone at a school where I
might actually have friends would ask, and then
answer them. Self-reference may be the lowest of
all the writer's cliches, but this isn't journalism.
These are just my thoughts: the flickers that preoccupy me when I'm having sex with my
boyfriend, and I look over his shoulder into my
closet and congratu- a^^HßaaHHaaaM
late myself for not

khaki is not a color (no matter what the strict definitions say). Khaki is fabric of a certain color, it
is clothes made of this fabric, it was, originally,
the material of the military uniforms and now
just of uniforms, yuppie and otherwise. It should
be stricken from your wardrobe, or, at the very

least, please, please only wear one item of it at a
time. Khaki never matches khaki.
Let's just say, however, that you are an individual who prefers his pragmatism with pizzazz,
and thus would desire a head-warmer that's not a
beanie. In that case, you could look into 'sosinspired winter hats and should consider how
this particular hat will fit into the rest of your stylistic decisions. 'sos-inspired men's hats look good
with almost everything,
but
'sos-

I look ridiculous when I wear a
beanie, and I suspect that most
everyone does as well

me from getting to
class on time; the thought I store away for later
when someone whom I run across wearing an
item of my discarded clothing gets all sheepish
and bizarrely offers the preemptive explanation,
"It's not like I'm poor."

What's the best way to keep my head warm
and be stylish at the same time?
I look ridiculous when I wear a beanie, and I
suspect that most everyone does as well, though if
this question only concerned staying warm with
no regards as to looking like a penis, then well, a
beanie would be your simplest option. (Wearing a
loose fitting beanie does not make you look any
less like a penis. It just makes you look like an
uncircumcised penis.) As with most of my fashion
decisions, I only endorse two directions in choosing the right beanie: if you're planning on wearing this beanie everyday, I say to keep it simple
and make it luxe. If not, if this beanie is to be part
of a specific ensemble, then make sure it matches
your outfit exactly, or that your outfit is one color
and the beanie contains, or is in its entirety, a dif-

14

ferent, purposefully contrasting color. By the
way, and this is one of my recurring annoyances,

women's
inspired
hats require an outfit
that correlates, at
least in part, to the

slim silhouette of that
era. Or, you could
look into those ugly polar fleece head wraps, in
which case you should consider never leaving
your room.
There is, however, an option that I endorse in
every situation. Earmuffs, of which my best
friend and I have been slowly amassing a formidable collection. Your hair won't get matted,
you'll stay warm, and you'll look adorable.
They're timeless, they work with every outfit,
and they're cheap (sl-$3 at thrift stores). Done.
Look, I feel like I'm special, and if fashion is all
about revealing the inner me, then how do I
make sure I look special for a special night?
There's no material that someone hasn't used
in art, including all bodily fluids, byproducts, etc.

But if you need my help in determining how to
look special for someone whom you obviously
know much better than I, then sucks to be you.
Wear an outfit made of raspberry jelly. With
seeds. You're toast.

had found a kindred spirit.
At one point in my life, I thought I was the only person on the planet
who got down with herself on a regular basis, but thankfully, our level of
honesty about the subject has changed. Although my conversation topics
of choice are not necessarily representative of those of most Swatties,
("So, I bought a new vibrator today ..."), I have noticed that most people
here, ofboth genders, seem to feel pretty comfortable admitting that they
do it. Beyond this level of information, though, people tend to get rather
embarrassed. Why is this? After all, it's so much fun!
So in this, the first of what I hope will be many sex-related columns (if
the wonderful staff of the Phoenix decides that I generate the best
response
wink wink nudge nudge), I'm going to explore a few methods
and tricks that have helped me to deal with midterm stress, times when
the boy or girl I'm been with just couldn't seem to find "the spot," and
have generally helped to shape me into the more or less satisfied, if not
always stable, person I am today. (Hey, I'm still a Swattie.)
...

Naturally, we all have a favorite bundle of
nerve endings, but that Is no excuse not to
explore the pleasure potential of other spots
Vanilla Masturbation. By this label I refer to the more or less simple,
toy-free variety the kind that you can easily perform without any fancy
equipment. Even when it's just you and your trusty hand, there many
ways to spice things up. For example, if you are someone who views masturbation as a series of jerks/rubs/etc. designed only to lead up to the
quickest possible orgasm, then you may want to first try changing your
outlook toward the ritual. Whether you are in any type of relationship or
not, masturbating can be fun and fulfilling. It's a great way to learn exactly what turns you on, which your honey will greatly appreciate when you
are working really hard to get him/her off and they look like they're
watching CNN. (Damn it, you had too much to drink).
Although it can be especially difficult for underclassmen, what with
the limited privacy of dorm life, try to allocate more than a few measly
minutes to playing with yourself. Using lubes, delaying orgasm by letting
yourself come close to climaxing and then stopping for a few seconds
before repeating, putting your legs in different positions, rubbing parts of
your body other than your genitals, using sexy imagery, letting water
from a faucet or showerhead give your tired hand a rest, or fantasizing
really vividly are all ways to turn a so-so experience into one that will
cause your RA to start complaining about your frequent violations of
quiet hours.
Thinking Outside the Box. So many people I know allow their masturbation routines to be defined by the stimulation of only one area (usually the clit or the penis). Naturally, we all have a favorite bundle of nerve
endings, but that is no excuse not to explore the pleasure potential of
other spots. Anal (for everyone) and vaginal (for those of us who have
them) stimulation with your fingers or a vibrator/dildo/plug/whatever
can immensely heighten orgasm. (Safer sex tip
there is bacteria in the
anus that can cause yeast infections and UTIs if it gets into the vagina, so
it's best to wear a latex glove or a condom on your fingers when you touch
your anus. Also, keep nails short and clean. I'm serious!)
Whether you try these techniques with a partner(s), on your partners), or by yourself, I say there is no reason that "Guilt without sex"
need define any Swattie with some lube and creativity (having a roommate who likes to study in McCabe doesn't hurt either). Be sure to read
my next column, tentatively on the joy of sex toys, which are just far too
important to include as a side note. Now, where's my "Rabbit?"
Think you can top this? Submit to phoenix@swarthmore.edu.
Here are the results of a survey of 30 Swatties:
Where do you most frequently masturbate?
I don't remember how. Chem consumes my thoughts 10%
McCabe bathrooms 12%
In my bed when my roommate is gone 20%
In my bed when my roommate is (hopefully) asleep 28%
In front of my computer while looking at Anime porn 30%

A substancefree proposal
The mysterious survey stuffed in your mailboxes last week was not just an administrative whim:
the housing committee is indeed considering creating substance-free housing for next year.

While it sounds like a decent idea, it's a bad fit

for the Swarthmore campus; it carries far more
costs than benefits and would ultimately exacerbate
the problem it tries to address.
First of all, the idea is unenforceable. Those of us

who live on one of Willets' choice nonsmoking halls
know by the constant lingering odor of pot that the
label is just that
a label. Nonsmoking halls,
frankly, usually aren't.
RAs are neither babysitters nor police officers,
and no one wants real police officers (or public safety officers, for that matter) lurking around dorms to
snare a few deviants drinking wine coolers.
Substance-free housing would most likely not create
a truly substance-free space on campus; it would, at
most, only help bring together a few of the students
who choose a substance-free lifestyle.
This segregation would feed negative stereotypes
about the college lifestyle by implying that the only
way students can live substance-free is to cut themselves offfrom those who choose differently.
Students living in substance-free housing might
feel alienated from their friends who drink; the
pressure on students who choose to live substancefree to withdraw from those with differing lifestyle
choices would only serve to further encourage our
unfortunate self-segregation habit.
Swarthmore tries to make a point of treating us
as adults. Rather than following a "War on Drugs"
mentality, the college expects us to make our own
decisions about substance use and to take responsibility if we screw up. It's a good policy, and for the
most part it works. Substance-free housing would
undermine it by giving the college responsibility for
defending a small section of campus as "safe space,"
singling out one lifestyle choice as meriting special
protection.
Peer pressure is a reality, yes, but there are more
effective and more meaningful ways to combat it
than segregating minorities, of any kind.

Good drag no justification for blackface
practice, and the mainstream never embraced drag perform-

Dear Editor:
In her letter of last week, Sam Crane suggested that blackface, along with this year's other racialized Halloween costumes, has the transgressive potential of "good drag" to
"challenge stereotypes and provoke serious thought." This
argument rests upon a dangerous conflation of racism and
sexism. It fails to account for the fact that while both are
undeniably oppressive structures, they have very different
histories and function differently in our society.
Blackface does not simply perpetuate stereotypes that
"have historically led to racism and violence." Stereotypes
alone do not lead to violence. To the contrary, blackface
emerged as a direct tool of white supremacy. It became popular in the U.S. as part of post-Civil-War efforts to cement the
social, political and economic status quo. While drag, as
practiced in the United States, can (like most things) be
inflected by misogyny, it did not specifically develop to

maintain male dominance. Drag

originated as

a subcultural

ance the way it did blackface.
Constructs of both race and gender have been critiqued
successfully

through

the

medium

of

performance.

Halloween costumes rarely do that. Dressing as a "prostitute" is not "good" (subversive) drag, either. Though these
costumes have not caused organized outrage, they are
indeed offensive. They are not offensive because they "perpetuate negative stereotypes about women," however, but
because they appropriate, trivialize and exploit the real
experience of a marginalized group.

The Halloween costumes in question did not "cross
racial boundaries" in a "fun, progressive way." We should
neither "accept" nor "celebrate" crossing oppressive
boundaries in ways which invoke power and perpetuate
historical oppression.

Iraq resolution airs student opinions
Dear Editor:
In last week's article "SC Approves Referendum on
Possible War in Iraq," there are a few points that those of us
who wrote and presented the resolution to the Student
Council would like to clarify.
First, we'd like to say that we believe a simple majority of
votes would be adequate to demonstrate that there is a significant opposition to this proposed war in Iraq amongst the
student body. Of course a 2/3 or more majority would make
an even stronger statement against this war, but even a sim-

vote for this resolution, we are not attempting to silence dissident voices on this issue. We recognize that no matter the
content of the resolution there will always be someone on
campus who believes differently, and we do not wish for our
resolution to be taken as evidence that the student body
speaks with one voice. Since the recent Congressional vote,
many of us who oppose war against Iraq have felt that our

editor

Even at Swat, racism persists
Dear Editor:
I would like to address the question that Randy
Goldstein put forth in his column last week. Goldstein
asked, "Is there really a racism problem at Swarthmore
College?"
Although his column asserts that Swarthmore is a
special place where equality is unparalleled and racism
does not exist, Goldstein forgets that Swarthmore does
not exist in a vacuum and is subject to the same forms
of structural racism as any other institution. More
importantly, most people who attend Swarthmore were
once part of the larger U.S. society, in which he admits
racism exists. We are products of and influenced by a
society that perpetuates racism and inequality.
Goldstein argued there is "a difference between blatant racism with violent consequences and the innocent intentions of a small group of party goers." Both

are examples

of racism,

however, and help create

inequality of opportunity.
In saying that the "antics" of partygoers such as

himself were "harmless" and "innocent," Goldstein
fails to acknowledge that they exploited that inequality
for their "humor." Such examples of subtle racism indicate a community that is not free of racism.
Incidents such as those at the Halloween party have
the potential to promote a dialogue that is anything but
"meaningless" and that goes beyond people simply feeling bad about themselves. Instead, such incidents and
the dialogue that should follow have the potential to

make us all more aware of the racism that exists in both
subtle and more obvious forms throughout our community and the world at large. This awareness will allow us
to actively fight racism on a personal and global level.

Phoenix thrives on cheap controversy
Dear Editor:
Once again in an attempt to create news on a campus
where there is none, The Phoenix has built controversy
out of thin air. Ever since I picked up my first copy of
your paper, I've seen an interesting pattern at work. The
Phoenix prints articles, columns or letters which invariably stir up controversy over what should be a non-issue.
These pieces then set off rounds of letter writing which
become more and more bitter as the weeks pass. In the
papers of the last two weeks this pattern was evident:
L The Phoenix has labeled the "Arab" costume worn
by a student as a "Palestinian terrorist" costume, a
name which is as troublemaking as it is inaccurate.
2. The Phoenix has included no less than six letters
about "queer chalkings." Does anyone remember similar letters appearing in the Phoenix last year? Perhaps
the authors searched through their files, updated their
letters, and sent them in again. I remember Jeff Rogg
being mentioned in a lot of those letters too.
3. Last week, Rachel Burstein, a Phoenix columnist,
made several thinly veiled attacks against frat guys
and beer drinkers alike. She said that a student "of the
J. Crew-wearing-fraternity-belonging-jock

THE PHOENIX

variety"

becomes a jackass when he drinks beer "if he isn't one
already." She also made a poor joke about the scarcity
of DU pledges in McCabe. Perhaps Ms. Burstein is
unaware that McCabe himself was a DU brother.
The editors of this paper should ask themselves an
important question: Is The Phoenix an example of
responsible journalism or another Daily Jolt? Is this
paper trying to make people angry? I ask that you let
well enough alone. I think I speak for a large number of
students when I say this: I don't care about chalkings. I
don't care about costumes. I want to go out on the week-

ends and have a good time without being called a jackass. And, most importantly, I don't believe there is any
real room for controversy on this campus.
The people who write about these supposed major
issues should instead consider themselves lucky to be
able to go to a school where all races, religions, sexual
orientations and points of view are accepted. The
Phoenix needs to either stop being a forum for malcontents to complain about the "hot" topic of the week, or
it should stop printing before it does more damage to
the Swarthmore community.

other lobbies know when to stop. If farmers or steelworkers or
record industry representatives succeed in picking the consumer's pocket, they're content. That's not true for the health
lobby. Not only do they want to impose punitive taxes every
chance they get, but they use the proceeds to annoy people
with obnoxious, heavy-handed propaganda. The "Daily Dose
of Truth" ads are the worst, for they present the politically
correct, establishment point of view as if it was somehow
"edgy." They make me want to enrich the coffers of Philip
Morris and place laurel wreaths on the heads of tobacco company executives.
And as bad as the ads are, the authoritarian philosophy
they stand for is worse. The basic premise of the health crusaders seems to be that it is unacceptable for any individual
to make a lifestyle choice that they disapprove of. Cigarettes
are their most prominent target, but they don't like alcohol,
red meat, sugar or firearms either, and I suspect that they're
not too fond of violent entertainment. It never fails to amaze
me that liberals, who supposedly believe in the right to control one's own body, are so copacetic about a movement that
seeks to regulate what Americans can eat, drink and smoke.
Although the health crusaders would never admit it, they
share some of the characteristics of the Christian right.
They've got the same desire to see their moral and aesthetic
preferences made into law and the same distrust for individual choice. Basically, the health lobby is a secularized, scientific version of the Puritans. They are what you'd get if you
raised Cotton Mather from the dead, replaced his Bible with a
folder full of obesity and cancer statistics and set him loose
on CNN.
But while the Moral Majority has been fading away, I feel
like the Anti-Fun Brigades have been getting stronger over

the past few years.
Not only have they been finding powerful allies like Dr.
Bloomberg, but they have discovered the tactic of using lawsuits to punish industries they don't like. This keeps them
from having to put up with the long, arduous process of having to change the minds of elected legislators, or, worse yet,
the American public, and puts everything in the hands of a 12-

man jury.
It's cynical and undemocratic, but it works. The tobacco
companies have had to cough up billions, a handgun manufacturer was recently made to pay $1.2 million because a murderer stole a pistol it had made and a fat guy in the Bronx is
currently suing all of the major fast-food franchises in his
neighborhood.

Frivolous, ideologically based lawsuits are so common
nowadays, I'm surprised that Al Bloom's not using them to
solve Swarthmore's budget deficit. Maybe we can bilk
Amherst out of a few million for vague, unspecified damages.
It's perfectly all right to publicly disapprove of smoking,
drinking and gorging. But there's a huge difference between
persuading people not to do something and forcing them to
obey you. The health lobby crossed that line a long time ago.
The sooner that Bloomberg and his ilk are reined in, the

better.

Swarthmore and the
color culture wars

op-art

by

annie

ronan

Race issues are, as they
have been for ages, rampant.
At the moment, however,
attention from the mainstream

media, underground organizations and members of the college community suggest the
issues could do with a slight
rehashing.
From

Marshall Mathers'

looming face on the Marple big
screen to the misunderstood
satire

MORGHAN HOLT
Ruminations

of

www.blackpeo-

pleloveus.com to the inflammatory incident at the ML
Halloween party, multifarious
color-based confrontations are
forcing us to rethink our
notions of what it means to be

black, what it means to be white and what happens when
the two spheres collide.
Eminem, in life as much as in scripted character, is a
problem. He's a white rapper and is thus thrust into a category that includes such horrors as Vanilla Ice and Marky
Mark, but he's mastered the music with unprecedented proficiency, which automatically distinguishes him.
Embraced by black and white fan bases alike, Eminem's
persona and his lyrics have incited a heated debate about
black culture and white culture ... either he's a phony white
boy who doesn't know his place, or he's bridging cultural
gaps by illustrating the fact that the two worlds aren't nearly as incongruous as they were once thought.
"8 Mile," it seems, favors the triumph of the latter, as it
attempts to demonstrate the ways in which Eminem's character's life transcends the distinct boundaries of the traditional white and black cultures (something that has in past
say, Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever"
films
been deemed
absurd to the point of offensive obscenity); he's very into
and very good at creating traditionally black music, yet his
life in a trailer with his floozy of a mother epitomizes the
stereotyped white-trash existence. At the end of the movie,
Eminem's character, Jimmy, finds himself embraced by the
black community for having effectively exhibited his
remarkable talent; at the end of the day, Marshall Mathers
checks his sales stats and finds that just as many AfricanAmericans are buying his albums and tickets for his movie

as Caucasians.
While the black community whose art has been adapted
ultimately accepts white Eminem and the fictional Jimmy,
such instances remain very much the exception to the rule.
White folk who attempt to mimic black culture are generally received as ignorant, racist apes, and usually with good
reason.
The website www.blackpeopleloveus.com is the brainchild of a white brother-sister duo who are offended by
instances in which white people try to "relate" to black people by assuming aspects of their culture. The website provides some rather poignant examples
couched in testimonials by black "friends" of the white people who claim
that black people love them
of white blunders in awkwardly assuming black culture.

The difference between these fictional but not unrealistic white people and Eminem is that Eminem manages to
convincingly synthesize the aspects of black culture that he
hopes to adopt; he doesn't come out sounding like a
wannabe desperately trying to crush boundaries because
he's aware and capable enough to hold his own.
As for the kid who inspired the hoopla of the Halloween
fiasco, his adaptation of a particularly sensitive aspect of
black culture, however ignorantly well-intentioned, was not
well-received because it was neither tactful nor artful, the
way Eminem, for all his perceived odious nature, manages

to be.
On a campus that boasts high diversification, it should
come as no surprise that color does not necessarily preclude compatibility, or even understanding. By now, we
should all be aware that culturally distinct worlds can collide and coalesce, that disaster does not necessarily ensue.
Still, it's worth noting, for everyone involved, that such
synchrony hinges on unrefined and honest interaction, and

is swiftly squelched by ignorant interpretations and/or
forced and phony efforts to "relate" on a cultural basis using

pop-culture-provided paraphernalia.

When Shakespeare gets PC
BY TARU TAYLOR
ttaylorl@swarthmore.edu
In the fall semester of 2001 I signed up for
"Shakespeare." I looked forward to studying Shakespeare
as well as famous critics both past and present.
I was excited to get further insight into the playwright who inspired John Keats to invent one of my
favorite terms, "negative capability," which he defined
as "when man is capable of being in uncertainties,/
Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after
fact and reason." Keats' point was that Shakespeare's
was the cosmic open-mind, defiant of all theory, not
that to read him and really
closed to any system
engage him is to open one's own mind, whether as a
reader or as patron of the theater. That's the
Shakespeare I looked forward to, the exemplar of "negative capability." What I got instead was an exemplar of
identity politics. I was a victim of false advertising, for
Shakespeare wasn't studied on his own terms, but as a
tool for approaching questions of gender and racial identity. Every play had to do with either "marginalized others" or gender, or the type of romance that appeals to the
feminine sensibility. No history plays, no tragedies
focusing on the theme that power tends to corrupt and
absolute power corrupts absolutely. No hard-core power
politics. It was all about identity politics and romance.
The course should have been called "Identity Politics
(featuring Shakespeare)."
We read "The Tempest," "The Winter's Tale," "The
Merchant of Venice," "Twelfth Night," "Othello," "A
Midsummer Night's Dream," "Measure for Measure,"
"Romeo & Juliet," and "Antony and Cleopatra." We studied Othello the Moor and Shylock the Jew as
Shakespeare's great "marginalized others," not to mention poor Caliban. Gender-bending was a big deal in

November 2% 2002

"Twelfth Night" and "Measure for Measure." The rest
were romances, basically the Shakespearean equivalent
of modern chick flicks. God forbid actually tackling a
politically incorrect play such as "The Taming of the
Shrew," which totally explodes the feminist thrust of
identity politics, or "Julius Caesar," which happens to
foreground white men. No, we read a kinder, gentler,
more politically correct Shakespeare, more in tune with
identity politics and the feminine sensibility (all those
romances!).
Once, during a lull in class discussion, we were
asked by our professor (I forget which play) "How can
we see this in terms of gender?" That question could
have framed the whole course. It's not that I'm against

identity politics. I just resent missing out on the little
bit Shakespeare had to say about power politics. All I'm
saying is that since our Shakespeare course virtually
ignored power politics and history plays, Shakespeare's
equivalent to modern action movies, it wasn't a balanced survey of Shakespeare. It wasn't yin and yang,
romance and action. It was all yin. A proper cross-section of plays, a proper balance of identity politics and
power politics, and it would have deserved the title
"Shakespeare."
Because it so narrowly focused on identity politics
(and romance), our course did not deserve the title
"Shakespeare." It was guilty of false advertising. Our
politically correct course, so obsessed with the bard of
identity politics, ignored the bard of power politics, i.e.
the deepest explorer of the psychology behind
Realpolitik that the world has ever known. It reduced
that exemplar of Negative Capability to fodder for identity politics.
Thus, for future reference, so as not to mislead, it
should be called "Identity Politics (featuring
Shakespeare)."

On November 5, voters

flocked to the polls in numbers not wita 2-vote

"The good news is that never before have so many people been

The bad news is that so many of them didn't mean it," answers Carl
Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club,
which is the oldest environmental lobbying organization in the country, predicts that the 108th Congress will want to make anti-environmental moves early in the Congress, rather than closer to next elections, since they know most Americans do consider themselves proenvironment. The key issues environmentalists are concerned about

following:

Weakening the Clean Air Act: Jim Jeffords (I-VT), the current
Senate Environment and Public Works Chair and Democrats opposed
Bush's "clear skies" initiative because it didn't include carbon dioxide reductions or significantly reduce mercury emissions. Jeffords is
likely to be replaced by Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), who is a pro-market advocate of industry self-policing and has received a score of zero
from the League of Conservation Voters every year since 1997.
Drilling in the Arctic Refuge: It is anticipated that Republicans
will introduce another bill to open the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to drilling.
Accelerated logging in National Forests, as part of Bush's plan
to reduce wildfires through selective logging.
$3O billion in tax breaks for the oil, gas, coal and nuclear power
industries was the biggest controversy between Senate Democrats and
House Republicans last term, and the major energy bill expected in this
Congress will probably include this measure, do less to promote renewable energy, and include an increase in the use of corn-based ethanol as
well as pipeline safety measures.
Urban sprawl might increase if business lobbies, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and other advocates of greater federal spending on road building win over advocates of "smart growth," which
includes more aid for mass transit.
Weakening of the Endangered Species Act, such as the weakening of protections for wild salmon, which is especially worrying
for the Northwest.

These are the platforms for candidates for Student Council as submitted to The Phoenix. The following
positions are up for election: Co-President, Appointments Chair, Student Events Advisor, Secretary/
Treasurer, Campus Life Representative and Campus Relations Representative. These platforms were
submitted by the candidates and represent their views, not the views of The Phoenix.
Student Council hopes to hold online voting from Friday, November 22 through Sunday, November 24,
and Sharpies voting will take place Monday, November 25 through Wednesday, November 27. The results
will be announced Wednesday night.

Responsibility
Few people really know what the Secretary is supposed
to do. That's because few of the past secretaries actually
finished their terms. I intend to stick to this job and attend
to the duties you entrust to me. I won't abandon ship and I
promise you won't have to vote again in two weeks.

Accountability
Besides facilitating a smoother functioning of the
Student Council itself, I see the Secretary position as an
opportunity to bring the Council closer to the student
body. Track records of the actual votes and minutes of
meetings will be available in a periodic newsletter to the
campus. You vote for us, so you better keep an eye on your
representatives. Let's keep in touch.
Interaction
As Secretary I will promote better and faster communication between the Council and our constituents. I will
implement a state of the art Web site providing you with
all the information you will ever need. Getting a charter,
funding for your group or starting a small revolution will
be just a click away. Well, that was just a campaign promise forget the revolution part.

Andrew Gisselquist 'O5

I am running for Student Council Secretary/Treasurer
because it is the best way for me to give back to
Swarthmore. I will make SC minutes and initiatives accessible, and I will apply knowledge gained from being a
member of such financially disparate activities as the

Peaslee debate society, Positive Alternatives in Chester
and the Cricket Club so that SC money may be used as
effectively as possible. Initiatives that you find important
will become my priority. For instance, I will work towards
increasing meal options, including a small meal plan for
off-campus students and allowing points to be used at the
McCabe coffee bar.
I also support the idea that has recently been proposed
regarding revamping SAC scheduling practices so that no
weekend is empty while some overflow with parties and
events. Moreover, I am already working to bring a network
search program like that which exists at other colleges
here to Swarthmore to increase the ease of use and functionality of the network. Finally, I will ensure that the
game room becomes, and stays, fully operational. This
includes getting new pool cues and fixing the pinball
machines and foosball table.

STUDENT EVENTS ADVISOR
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5

As Student Events Advisor, I plan to accomplish a few
things directly related to my job. The first is a more organized SAC schedule. It is a shame that we can have nights

where nothing is going on, and then suddenly have nights
with four and five events that cannot all be attended. I also
plan on implementing an online voting site so that students may vote on large-scale events proposals. This would
cause large-scale events to be more representative of the
whole student body.
I would also like to create a few fun activities for students including a bowling league, more opportunities in
the Crum (possibly bonfires etc.) and inter-dorm Olympics.
As a general Student Council member, I support and hope
to work closely with Jon in his efforts to increase club
sport funding, create an outdoor orientation activity, allow
the use of points at McCabe, examine the feasibility of
cooperative housing, and look into the development of a
student work project system.
Lastly, I also hope to misappropriate funds, appoint
friends and family to positions of power, and abuse my
power in ways Swarthmore has never seen before.

20

I am the current Student Council Secretary/Treasurer.
Last year I was Student Council's Educational Policy
Representative, and therefore served on Curriculum
Committee and Council on Educational Policy and
worked on the Class Recommendation Books. Over the
past two years I have also participated in several other
campus organizations including ADVICE, the Diversity
Taskforce, Swarthmore Young Friends and the search
committee for the Associate Dean for Multicultural
Affairs. I feel confident that I have gained the knowledge
and skills that will enable me to successfully work with
both students and administrators as Co-President.
During the next year I hope to increase the efficiency of
Council. I feel that Council has great potential, and just
needs to be properly motivated and directed in order to
achieve that potential.
Rather than working on my own specific agenda items,
I will try to help other members of Council achieve their
goals by running meetings more efficiently, keeping tabs
on the work of Council members, and improving relations
with faculty and administration, which would make
Council's plans more feasible. I look forward to the possibility of serving as your Co-President, and I would greatly
appreciate your vote.

CAMPUS RELATIONS REP.
Wee Chua 'O6

Dear Fellow Students,
This is Wee Chua, and I am running for Campus
Relations Representative. In fulfilling the role of Campus
Relations Representative, I will ensure that Student
Council is not just a group of students, instead a group of

students intent on helping the college community. In an
attempt to further communication between Student
Council and the Swarthmore community, I will establish
an e-mail list that summarizes the meetings of Student
Council. The Phoenix and the Daily Gazette will also
receive news on the actions of Student Council. Working
as a liaison between the people and the Student Council,
I will bring the college back to the people. Thank you,
VOTE WEE. If there are any questions or suggestions
contact me.

As Campus Life Representative, I plan to develop the
campus community and enhance campus life through a

more realistic and pragmatic implementation of change.
There are many feasible goals to be accomplished that
would benefit campus life. For example, I would start a
Student Community Initiative Project where students
could volunteer to help build, clean or do things to make
our campus life better without affecting our budget concerns. A walkway to PPR and cleanup of the Crum are
ideas for the first projects.
Another plan is to develop a working cooperative
housing option, which seems long overdue at Swat. I
would also try to create more flexible eating options,
such as a 5-meal lunch plan for students who live offcampus.
I am concerned with all aspects of campus life, and
some of my other suggestions would be to install picnic
tables outside Sharpies, to realize the campaign to use
points at McCabe, to bring back that cool big chair on
Parrish beach, to push for a keycard access system for
the campus, and to create and outdoor orientation

option.

As a Council member, I hope to work closely with
Emiliano and fully support his efforts to improve SAC, to
create a more democratic campus with online voting, to
have a more fun campus, and to improve club sport funding.

Patrick Hart 'O6

I want to be your Campus Life Rep. because I feel that I
can do a good job of talking with Swatties, getting their
views on how various aspects of campus life can be
improved, and work in the Student Council to make those

changes happen.
We all know Swat is a great school; at the same time,
don't we all constantly think of ways in which we wish it
were different? If I'm elected, that'llbe my job: listening to
your opinions on how student life could be better and
working to implement those changes in the student council., In short, if I'm elected, I will listen to all Swatties' concerns about life on campus and do my best to address those

concerns in the Student Council. So remember to vote for

Patrick Hart for Campus Life Rep!

Anton Voinov 'O4

Mark Hanis 'O4

Why should you vote for me? I am motivated, accountable, and qualified. My leadership experience includes: a
CA, a counselor, a teacher, an Eagle Scout, a L4L mentor,
and an EMT. I am also ready to learn and work with oth-

ers in SC, the administration, and the student body. What
can I do? As CRR, it's my job to keep you informed on SC's
activities and I'll be damn good at it too. I had the opportunity to teach a marketing class this summer to 6th and
7th graders. Thus, I know the importance in the delivery/presentation of a certain good. Currently abroad in
Rome, I can see Swarthmore with a fresh perspective.
With a new drive and inspiration I will ensure that you
are up to date on all SC activities. Why am I special? I am
the only Ecuadorian-Scottish-Austrian-American student
at Swat. Please feel free to contact me at mhanisl with any
questions, comments, or concerns. I would appreciate
your vote.

Even though I have not yet had the opportunity to serve
on the Student Council at Swarthmore, I come into this
race with substantial experience in the field of student
government. Having served as both class and school president during my high school years, I possess the skills
needed to carry out my duties, should I be elected for this
position, in an efficient and effective fashion.
My having been affiliated with various organizations
on campus ensures my familiarity with pressing campus
issues and the diverse needs of various students and student groups.
I am a very communicative person, and given the position of Campus Life Representative I will ensure the exis-

tence of reliable channels of communication between the
student body and the administration. I will strive towards
the development of student body consensus, and act as a
perpetual advocate of the student voice before the admin-

istrative body.

After month of practice, Garnet men geared up for season
DEBBIE FARRELLY
dfarrell@swarthmore.edu

This weekend marks the beginning of
the 2002-2003 men’s basketball season. The
Swarthmore men have been practicing
hard for the past month, playing in two
scrimmages thus far, all in focused preparation for what they hope will be a highly
successful season.
Last winter, in what could be characterized as a “rebuilding year,” the
Swarthmore men finished with a record of
6-19 overall and 2-11 in the extremely competitive Centennial Conference. However,
last year’s team was young and fairly inexperienced, with six first-years and only
two seniors. The team gains three freshmen this season, who replace the two graduated seniors and 6’6” Bayne Heersink,
who transferred to Division I University of
Alabama after last year.
Coming into his 16th season as Garnet
head coach, Lee Wimberly is eager to get the
season started. “I have been demanding
more than I ever have before,” Wimberly
said. “Our players need to be much tougher

physically and mentally. The effort level has
been exceptional in the preseason."
Coach Wimberly will look to the leadership of co-captains Dave Pearce 'O3, Eran
Ganot 'O3 and Jacob Letendre 'O4 to guide
the team to a successful season. Pearce, a
6'3" guard, has a chance to break the 1000
point mark this season, with 767 points
under his belt already.
Ganot, who has been plagued by injuries
over the past two years, is eager to be back
on the court: "I worked intensely hard during the off-season to ensure a healthier senior year, knowing well that the odds were
not exactly in my favor," he said. "Just
being able to play again regularly has been
an incredible feeling."
Point guard Jacob Letendre looks to
improve upon a tremendous sophomore season, during which he established himself as
the league leader in both assists and steals.
Letendre has an optimistic outlook on the
season. "The team this year has a lot of
potential. We return a majority of our
starters from last year along with three new
freshmen," he said. "If we play well as a
team, work the ball around, play defense

and play with confidence I think we can
have a very successful season and make it
to the playoffs."
In the frontcourt, Swarthmore will
depend heavily upon last season's leading
scorer, 6'4" Forward Matt Gustafson 'OS.
Gustafson averaged 14.2 points per game in
his freshman season and aims to be a strong
force in the paint again this year. "Matt is
clearly our best returning player. He's a
pure shooter who can hit from almost anywhere," Letendre said.
Ganot sees the team's major strength to
be its well-rounded pool of talent. "I'd like to
think that basketball is a game of mismatches and taking advantage of those mismatchesand certainly we have some we can
take advantage of," he said. "Our big men
are fairly agile and could cause slower big
men some trouble. Also, we tend to use wing
players with the ability to play both inside
and outside and there aren't too many
defenders who can cover both."
The Centennial Conference will again be
very competitive in the 2002-2003 season.
Swarthmore's toughest games will likely be
against the teams with more height and

strength in the forward positions. As
also looks forward to the
games against rivals like Haverford. For
now, however, the team is preparing for the
start of the season this weekend. "We have
worked extremely hard in the preseason
with the main goal of improving every day.
I think that has been the case and [we] hope
to continue this as the season progresses,"
always, Swat

Ganot said.

Tomorrow, the Garnet Tide will travel
to be play in the Equinox Classic, a fourteam tournament hosted by Haverford and
also including the University of the
Redlands and Connecticut College.
Swarthmore will face off against Division
111 powerhouse Connecticut on Saturday at
3 p.m. The Camels rely on the accuracy of
their outside shot, which will provide a
comparable match-up for the strength of
Swarthmore's guards.
Following Friday's game, the team will
play at Drew University on Monday, followed by a game against Division I Lehigh
University on Wednesday
a rigorous start
to what promises to be another exciting
Swarthmore men's basketball season.

Earthworms play host to weekend tournament
For the first time in several years,
the men's ultimate Frisbee team hosted a tournament here at Swarthmore.
The Earthworms were originally
slated to host three other squads, but
the University of Pennsylvania
dropped out of the tournament. As a
result, Swarthmore split its team in
two and played a round robin with visitng Haverford and George
Washington.

Since it was a home tournament,
the Earthworms had enough players

Andrew Steel Phoenix Staff

to form two talented squads, but the
B team fell to both George
Washington and Haverford.
The A team also struggled against
George Washington, who took home
tournament bragging rights by beating
both Earthworm squads. But
Swarthmore's A team managed to salvage the tournament for the
Earthworms by beating Haverford in a
hard-fought match.

Garnet women hope to secure
third consecutive CC finals berth
BY KATE NELSON-LEE
knelson2@swarthmore.edu
The last time a reigning Centennial
Conference Player of the Year stepped into
Tarble Pavilion for her junior season, the
Garnet went to the NCAA Division 111
Women's BasketbaU Championships. The
2002-2003 Swarthmore women's basketball
team isn't making any predictions, but
after earning a solid 104 points in the
Centennial Conference preseason coaches
poll for second place in the East Division,
the conference is looking for some tough
competition from the young squad.
"It's hard to forecast in any definitive
way what our record will be or how we'll
finish in the conference," co-captain Ali
Furman 'O3 said, "But I have no doubt that
we can achieve the same level of success
that we have experienced in the past."

Co-captain Katie Robinson 'O4, the 2002
Centennial Conference Player of the Year,
is the high-profile Garnet player of the
moment. As the preseason predictions
come rolling out this week, the forward
already has a Preseason Second Team AllAmerican nod from D3hoops.com. With a
laundry list of accolades from last year,
including WBCA/Kodak All-America honors, the 5'9" junior will be expected to provide a scoring spark after leading the team
and conference with 19.4 points per game.
"If Ro's on we have as good of a chance
to win anything as any other team,"
Furman said.
With the graduation of Heather Kile 'O2,
who was just behind Robinson with 18.6
ppg, many worried that Robinson would
feel added pressure to repeat of last year's
spectacular season performance. However,
she seems to be taking her new role in

stride.
"I think we were worried that she'd feel
more pressure," associate head coach Kira
Cochran-Bond 'OO said. "But she's been
doing a good job of focusing on just playing
the game and having fun."
With head coach Adrienne Shibles on
leave this semester after having her first

22

child this summer, Cochran-Bond, along
with fellow alumnae Heather Marandola
'Ol, is the official person in charge. "I think
Kira and Heather are going a great job with
the team," Furman said.
However, Shibles' new family has not
kept her from being a highly visible part of
her team's preseason.
"Adrienne has been great," Robinson
said. "She has a really relaxed attitude and

hasn't been stressed when she's been with
us."
One stabilizing factor for the team has
been Furman, who last season set the
school record for 3-pointers in a season
with 68 total treys. The lone senior on the
team, this local from Haverford averaged
8.3 points and 2.9 assists per game.

"Ali is someone we've been able to count
on," Cochran-Bond said. "She's gotten very

little credit for what she's given to the program over her career."
Furman is consistently looked to by her
teammates for her experience and leadership as well as her on-the-court skills.
"Ali's a great player," Robinson said.
"She's really good at running the show
because of her experience."

"Without a doubt, Ali is the leader of
this team," Cochran-Bond agreed. "We're
going to be relying on her leadership at

point guard."

The Garnet will officially open their season with a 6 p.m. game against Juniata in
Tip-Off
the
annual
Swarthmore
Tournament. As for who will be joining
Furman and Robinson in the starting lineup, the coaches have yet to decide. "It's
three days before tip-off, and we still don't
know who will be in the starting lineup,"
Cochran-Bond said. "There are lots of players who have gotten things done for us in

preseason."
Though reluctant to name individual
players as particularly talented, all three
point to the team's increased athletic ability and enthusiasm.

"The team works hard in practice,"

Furman said. "They all have great attitudes."

Katie Robinson, last year's leading scorer in the Centennial Conference with 19.4
points per game, shoots a floater over a Delaware Valley defender in a game last year.
"This is definitely the most athletic team
we've ever had," Robinson added.
The increased speed will change the
nature of the Garnet's game. With a deep
bench, Robinson and Furman expect that
the team will run and press more, getting
more points in the transition game.
"We're a smaller team but quicker. We'd
like to run a lot more and do some things to
make up for our size," Cochran-Bond said.
With two consecutive trips to the
Centennial Conference finals, the team is a
traditional powerhouse within the East
Division, and this year looks to be no exception. However, with arch-rival Muhlenberg

November 21, 2002

heading the preseason poll in the East and
in the conference overall, Swarthmore will
face some stiff competition as it looks to
capture its third consecutive appearance in

the finals.
After this weekend's tourney, the Garnet
jump right into conference play, with a
tough road trip to reigning Centennial
Champion McDaniel on Tuesday. Last year,
the Green Terror rolled over the Tide 66-38
in the championship game.
"We're a new team and we don't know
what to expect," Robinson said. "We're
looking to have a good season and I know
we have the talent and ability to win."

F&M women edge Garnet by two points
From SWIMMING, pg. 24
cinched the meet right there," Dudley said.
"This year the sophomores, Mikey Auerbach and Ben
Morgan, have really broken out," Whitehead said. "Last
year, we were lacking depth; this year, guys are stepping it
up. It's really surprising how well we're swimming. We're
ranked first in a lot of events in the conference. It puts us in
a good position."
Although the Tide are ecstatic about their early success,
they also realize that their ultimate goal, winning the conference championship, is still months away. "Since I've been
here, I've never seen the team come off to such a good start.,"
Whitehead said. "But the question is, can we keep it up? Can
we keep the focus?"
The men's team has only won one conference title, and
that was 15 years ago. "What I want to see is if people
improve their times, stay the same, or get slower. If we continue to drop times, we have a genuine chance at winning
the conference championships," Whitehead said.
Although it is still very early in the season, the men's
team's chances are only looking better and better. Besides
F&M, Gettysburg and Dickinson will also present a challenge for the Tide at the championships. "This is our best
shot," Auerbach said. "This is the year because we have
such a good senior class."
The women's team lost by only two points to F&M, 103.510L5. "We lost the women's meet by 0.03 seconds," Davis said.
"Overall we tried really hard," co-captain Denise Finley
'O3 said. "A few places it could've gone either way."
"We could've won the meet if we had longerfinger nails,"
Davis said jokingly.
Despite the loss, the Tide were happy with their effort.
For example, twenty-three women qualified for ECACs at
the meet, and fourteen individuals had personal bests. "It
was the best meet we ever lost," Davis said.
Davis cited many outstanding performances from her
swimmers, including those by Patricia Funk 'O6, Tara Trout
'O4, and Meredith Leigh 'O4. "Lots of people had really amazing swims," Leigh said.
Leigh, for example, swam the fastest in-season 200 breast
time in the last three years. "Meredith Leigh surprised us,
herself, and the world," Davis said.

Although Leigh came just millimeters short of escaping

with a first place finish, she was proud of her huge effort.
"Sue told me to get second," Leigh said. "It wasn't expected
for me to compete for first."
Leigh gives credit to an energized home crowd for her
time. "I felt all of the energy from the crowd," Leigh said. As
a result, she swam a faster split in the last half of the event
to nearly overcome an early lead by F&M's Elizabeth

Kraljic.

Davis was proud of Leigh and her teammates' efforts. "I
couldn't ask for anything more from anybody on this weekend," Davis said.

As for repeating the women’s conference championship
success, the team is looking upbeat. “It’s always tough to tell
how we’ll do at the conference championships,” Finley said.
“We tend to taper really well, so we’re often the most competitive team at conferences.”

“It’s really encouraging, and we’re looking forward to
conference championships,” Leigh said. “The women’s
team is really motivated. We want to keep up the tradition,
and keep the title,” Leigh said. “We’re all working hard in

practices.”

Reynolds, Young pace harriers at regionals

The Garnet Tide men's and women's cross-country
teams headed to Salisbury University in Maryland this
past Saturday, Nov. 16, to compete in the much-anticipated Mideast Regional meet.
The pancake-like surface at Salisbury, with its tight
turns and a narrow opening straightaway, provided a
challenge for the Garnet runners, who were geared for
hillier courses by their training.
After fighting an injury epidemic to finish fifth at the
Centennial Conference Championships at Ursinus on
Nov. 2, the men's team was psyched heading into regionals, knowing that health would not be as much of a factor
in the meet.
The women's team was also confident it could place
high after a strong fourth-place showing at the conference championships. For Lang Reynolds 'O5 and MariaElena

Young 'O4, both of

whom earned All-Mideast

Region honors last year, the meet served as an opportunity to get into the exclusive NCAA Division 111
Nationals meet on Nov. 23 in St. Olaf, Minn.
Led by Young, the Garnet women finished seventh out
of a field of 34 teams at the meet. Young's 31st place fin-

ish on the 6000-meter pancake course at 22:22.90 earned
her All-Mideast Region honors for the third consecutive
year. Young was followed by Njideka Akunyili 'O4, who

placed 49th in 22:53.76, Lauren Fety 'O3, who placed 60th
in 23:07.98, Carrie Ritter 'O3, who finished 65th in 23:12.17,
and Molly Maurer, who rounded out the Tide's scoring
with a 81st placed finish in 23:29.57.
Unfortunately, Young's finish did not qualify her for
the nationals, which had been a goal ofhers heading into
the meet.
"I should point out here that Saturday was not a successful day for me," she said. "The top 35 make AllRegional and this is my third year accomplishing that;
however, my coaches and I had much higher expectations
of what I would be able to do." Young also put the meet
into perspective, concluding that her failure to realize her
goal "doesn't mean that it was an unsuccessful season."
Paced by Lang Reynolds' 27th-place finish, the men
finished 12th out of 34 squads at the Regional. Reynolds'
25:40.93 time on the flat 8000-meter course earned him
All-Mideast Region honors for the second consecutive
year. He was followed by James Golden 'O5, who finished
54th in 25:24.04, Joe Makin 'O3, who placed 65th in
26:36.79, Garret Ash 'O5, who finished in 92nd place in
27:03.26, and Adam Hunt 'O6, who concluded the Garnet

scoring with a 108th place finish in 27:19.99.
"I finished in 25:40, what I wanted to run, but 27th
place, a bit worse than I was hoping," Reynolds said. "I
was happy to have met my goal pace, but rather disappointed that I did not make nationals. All things considered, though, I don't think I could have run much faster."
The regional meet is considered the most important of
the season, with the exception of the national, which is
extremely difficult to qualify for. Head coach Peter
Carroll designed the teams' workouts so that the Garnet
harriers would be in their top condition on race day.
With his "tapering" training, the weekly volume of
mileage is reduced and the emphasis of workouts shifts
from endurance to speed. More importantly, the Garnet
runners were, for the most part, able to regain their
health and be ready for the big race.
"Our team result does not properly reflect how well
we ran as a team. It was the first time all season that we
had all four of our top four running in the same race (due
to injuries), and everyone ran very hard," Reynolds
added. "The regional competition has improved a lot
since last year. Special thanks to our coach Pete Carroll
and assistant coach John Noon for all of their hard work,
and thanks as well to those fans who made the trip to
Maryland to cheer us on."

Examining Beirut Men's swim team defeats

Certain things have become quite apparent to me in my time here at Swarthmore.
this college is chock full of diverse individuals, said individuals
rarely interact, preferring instead to sit at their own separate lunch tables and in
their own separate meeting rooms. The Phoenix has covered this phenomenon ad
nauseam, and pretty well, too. The second thing I
have discovered is that the one thing that generally
pulls people of all races, creeds, and clothing styles
together is a simple game that we here like to call
Beirut. The Phoenix's coverage of this phenomenon
has been very bad.
It seemed to me that covering the extremely popular game of Beirut on the Swarthmore campus was
a terrific idea. A journalist could talk to frat boys,
residents of Wharton (they play a decent brand
down in the basement, you know), the Lodges, and
hell, the students in Religion Cafe. Once the journalist had taken a cross-section of the campus
Beirut scene, the focus could shift to the national
picture. A simple Internet investigation would
reveal a national Beirut championship tournament,
a Web site, and memorabilia that sell like hot cakes.

As I said before, this seemed like a good idea.

Instead, the article that The Phoenix delivered
focused solely on the frat boys, or at least one half of
them. More specifically, the articlefocused on mocking these Beirut participants, under the guise of a
straightforward news piece. I will not dwell on the article for too long. In short, let
me say that reading the piece was like having a journalist pee on my leg and tell me
that it is raining. But I digress. I feel it is my turn to sound off on the great sport of
Beirut. It is my opportunity to expound on why this game attracts such a wide array
of Swarthmore students; why the clanging of pingpong balls on plastic cups sounds
like a symphony, and why it is every Swarthmorean's right to occasionally act like a

Riding the Pine

jackass.

The name of the game does not matter. Beirut is a nationwide term, and though
the title can apply to a great variety of ping-pong-ball shooting contests, the general
spirit of the sport is always the same. The game itself is what we must concern ourselves with. Beirut is the purest of sports, unsullied by the greedy hand of American
corporate athletics. Those who play the game of Beirut play for the love of the game
(and the beer). Witness the Beirut shrines that exist on this campus. I submit to you
that you will not find two greater venues for Beirut play than DU and Phi Psi. Both
sites have been almost wholly given over as arenas for the sport. Were it not for pure,
unadulterated, dogmatic love, these temples would never have been constructed.
Comparing the two is like comparing Wrigley to Fenway; both are cathedrals of the
game, and preference is simply a matter of personal taste.
These two cathedrals are home to Beirut play at least four nights of the week. The
other nights, one need only venture across campus to eventually find a game taking
place in some dorm or student space. I defy any Swarthmore student to find a night
of the year that does not play host to some version of Beirut being played by some faction of the school. This means that every night, as sure as there is someone sweating
over a textbook in McCabe, there is someone flicking a pingpong ball high in the air,
with beautiful arc, and rejoicing as that ball finds its way home to a pool ofbeer resting inside a plastic cup.
The wide appeal of this great game makes perfect sense. At a college where everyone thinks too much, Beirut calls out to us for its base stupidity. Whatever Beirut
may be, it is not a thinking game. There is strategy, yes, but the sport comes down to
two basic facts. The team that can hit more cups and drink more beer will win.
Beirut, then is the perfect haven for any Swarthmore student who must be cleansed
of the suffocating academic nature of this school. For the game of Beirut is the great
equalizer. Sure, your opponent may have scored 14 points higher than you on the
LSAT, but does anyone care about that if you are able to hit 12 cups before him and
his partner? Of course not.
Beirut is a game that teaches us to live in the moment. Swatties plan and plan and
then make contingency plans. Beirut has no time for such silliness. Beirut shows us
that we must live for every last second, for every last shot, for every last drop of beer.
It teaches us that not every endeavor at this place must be academic, or even intrinsically valuable. It shows us that we can come together over activities that do not
make our brains hurt (at least not until the following morning, that is). It shows us
that every once in a while, we all owe it to ourselves to let our hair down, get a little
stupid, and maybe, God forbid, act like a jackass.

In front of one of the largest, most rambunctious Swarthmore crowds in recent
memory, the men's swim team produced a
stunning upset last Saturday, easily defeating reigning conference champion Franklin
&
Marshall 126-79. "They're our biggest
rivals in the dual meet season," David
Whitehead 'O3 said. "We've never beaten
them in my previous three years at
Swarthmore."
Whitehead helped lead the team to victory, placing first in three events. His 1:46.61
time in the 200 free was an in-season record
at Swarthmore. "The men are swimming
like Olympians every single meet," head
coach Sue Davis said.
Davis cited many of her swimmers for

Mike Dudley 'O3, John Lillvis 'O3, Eric
Shang 'O4, and Mikey Auerbach 'O5 as well
as other swimmers who performed well but
did not finish first. "People had outstanding
swims right across the board," Davis said.
This year, the men's team clinched the
win after only nine events, when Auerbach
captured a first-place finish in the 500 free.
"We won much earlier in the meet then
usual," Whitehead said. "We wanted to end
it really fast, so we didn't have to feel the

pressure."

Auerbach threw up his hands in celebration after finishing the 500 free in
4:58.36, the fastest first semester in-season
time in Coach Davis' nineteen-year tenure
at Swarthmore. "Auerbach winning 500 free
