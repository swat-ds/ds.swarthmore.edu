This year, the Genderfuck party will be held for the first time in Sharpies. Fifteen Party Associates and two Public Safety officers will
be in attendance the entire night to ensure the safety of those in attendance.
BY PATRICK AMMERMAN
pammerml@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's largest party of the
year, "Genderfuck," will be enforced by
new security measures this year to
ensure the safety of everyone in attendance. Student safety at the party has
been a growing issue and, just last year,
resulted in a formal disassociation
between the party and the Sager
Symposium
for
issues.
Queer
According to Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, last year's party resulted in seven alcohol related incidents
that required ambulances and hospital

treatment.
This year's Genderfuck will take

place in Sharpies, which will provide a
more centralized party and allow a better monitoring of students leaving and
entering the building. In years past, the
party has taken place at three locations
concurrently: Delta Upsilon, Olde Club
and the Women's Resource Center. This
year's Genderfuck will also be closed to

non-Tri-Co students, but students from
other schools can still attend if invited
by Tri-Co students.
One of Genderfuck's planners, Alex
Weintraub 11, said that conversations
between the party's planners, Sexual
Health Counselors, ASAP and Party
Associates (PAs) prompted this decision
to move the party to Sharpies.
"There will be areas in this party on
the ground floor where" you can get a
drink of water and food ... where attendees can have a break from the party,"
Weintraub said.
He also added that the top area will
be completely dry, giving students "a
totally dry place where people can come
and celebrate
so more members of
the campus can contribute."
There will also be more PAs and public safety officers present at this year's
party. "There will be 10 [PAs] at least at
any given time," David Hill 'l3, one of
the two PA Coordinators, said.
PAs will work in shifts throughout
the night with a total of 15 individuals

acting as PAs over the entire course of

the party.

According to Redgrave, two Public
Safety officers will be positioned outside Sharpies and will work overlapping shifts throughout the night.
PAs will be provided with additional

support from members of the DART
team, who will be putting up posters in
Sharpies and will be available throughout the night of Genderfuck to provide
additional assistance to those in need.
Dean Liz Braun and Hill both feel
confident in the security measures the
college has put in place. "We've had a
very well-thought-out plan and security
strategy for months now," Hill said.
Braun agrees that the party doesn't
require added concern because "we
already had put in plans to increase the
security of [the party]."
Even in the wake of last weekend's
assault, Hill believes security for the
party has already been aptly addressed.
"Safety has always been the number
one priority," he said.

Student assaulted by
teens on Mertz field

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY PATRICK AMMERMAN
pammerml@swarthmore.edu

Last Sunday morning just after
midnight, a group of teenagers violently assaulted a Swarthmore student
and a University of Pennsylvania student. The incident took place on Mertz
field. The two students were then
taken to Worth Health Center by a
Public Safety officer who responded to
the scene to receive first aid from the
nurses on duty there. They were then
transported to Springfield Hospital

Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave has been involved with the

[Public Safety] came from Worth
Health Center at 12:30 a.m... Our corporal in charge of that shift happened
to be in [David] Kemp and so he was
on the scene at or before 12:32,"
Redgrave said.

Safety officers could not find any sign
of the perpetrators. The Borough

Poet Kate Northrop read from several of her works and announced student prizes in poetry on Tuesday in the Scheuer room.

Police were called as well and assisted
in the search. "We had a fairly large
number of law enforcement types
combing the area," Redgrave said.
Reports filed by Public Safety and
the police indicate that the assailants
were a group of five to seven
teenagers, one of whom was female
and one who was possibly Asian. The
two students were walking through
Mertz field when they were
approached by the group of teenagers.
The teenagers then asked the two students to procure alcohol for them.
"[The students] asked the kids if they
were 'Ville rats' and if they were of
high school age. That's the only indication we have of any comments that
were made between the groups,"
Swarthmore Chief of Police Brian
to the
Craig said. According
Swarthmore Police Report, the students first asked if the group of
teenagers were "Ville rats" and they
responded "No." The students then
asked if they were in high school.
Immediately after this question, the
perpetrators attacked the two students, knocking them to the ground
and kicking and punching them
repeatedly.

An e-mail from Public Safety was
sent out to the student body on
Monday around 5 p.m. The e-mail provided a brief description of the incident, but

included vague details
the actual conversation
between the two students and the perpetrators; it also had discrepancies
involving the location of the attack.
The e-mail prompted concern from
many students. "Students saw [that]
the response from Public Safety
which is typically how they do things,
you know, just the facts
was not
what a lot of people on campus expected was needed at the time," Dean
Rafael Zapata said. Zapata, who was
the dean on call when the assault took
place, received several questioning emails from students who read Public
Safety's e-mail.
Michael Duffy 'll, a Swarthmore
Resident Assistant, sent another email to his hall on Monday, which

regarding

quickly circulated to other RAs and
students around campus. In it, Duffy
expressed frustration with Public
Safety's initial notification e-mail,
including details missing from Public
Safety's notification such as the students' overnight hospital stay and that
both identify as queer and were showing signs ofaffection at the moment of

confrontation.
"I find it indefensible that the
administrationfailed to report to all of
you
that there is some possibility
that they were targeted due to public
expression of their sexual orientation.
Issues such as these are always important and alarming, particularly in a
community such as ours that places
an emphasis on progressive and inclusive values," Duffy wrote.
"The primary purpose of that email was to inform my hall and others
of what had happened, and to ensure
that they be proactive and alert about
safety," Duffy explained later.
According to Dean Liz Braun, the
Public Safety message "was based on
the best information we had at that
time."
Both Braun and Zapata were aware
that a follow up e-mail with more
information would need to be issued to
further inform the student body, but
waited to consult with the victim
before doing so. "We knew all along
that a follow up was going to happen,
but clearly the campus didn't know
we wanted to make sure that
that
what we shared was something that
the student was okay with," Zapata
said.
Details about the student's sexual
orientation also were not brought up
on the night of the assault or mentioned in the initial police report.
However, in speaking with the
deans, the Swarthmore student affected stated that he feared his sexuality
was a reason behind the attack and
asked that the student body be
informed about it. "I really appreciated that he was willing to share that
sort of information with me and really
felt that it was important to relay that
aspect of it to the community as well,"
Braun said.
Whether or not the assault constituted a hate crime is still unclear.
"Our experience has been that, if
they're attacking with [sexuality] in
mind, they make some comments
related to that and there was nothing
about that reported," Craig said. Still,
the victims have expressed to the
deans that they thought their sexuality may have been a factor in what happened. "While there were no epithets
hurled at them during that, [the victims] felt that that was the reason.
They couldn't think of anything else,"
Zapata said.
An investigation is still ongoing to
find the assailants. There have been
no promising leads yet and, as
Redgrave pointed out, the absence of
good descriptions of the attackers and
lack of witnesses make the investigation much harder. "Those are typically the two leads that law enforcement
can run with
or run fastest with,"
Redgrave said.
Public Safety and the Borough
Police will continue to work together
on the investigation.

SusCom pushes to hire full-time director
BY AARON KRAMER
akramer2@swarthmore.edu

As a part of the ongoing Strategic Planning
process, Swarthmore's Sustainability Committee
(SusCom) has been preparing a formal recommendation of sustainability initiatives. The key
components of the recommendation include a list
of. action item recommendations, a permanent
budget line of $lOO,OOO for energy conservation
projects and a full time staff position of
Sustainability Director.
The action item list suggests broad measures
to make the college more sustainable, including
proposals like maximizing the use of locallygrown and humanely-produced food on campus,
as well as installing more resource monitoring
systems.
Also included in the list is performing a costbenefit analysis of possible sustainability projects
on campus. According to Nadine Kolowrat,
Associate Director in the office of Corporate,
Foundation and Government Relations, this is a
big
task best suited for the proposed
Sustainability Director. The college recently
hired Mckinstry, an environmental consultant
firm, to perform a sustainability audit of the college.
Mckinstry's report mainly reduces to recommended changes in Swarthmore's infrastructure
and ways in which the college can make sustainability a more integral part of its culture, some of

which are included in SusCom's recommendations. Mckinstry noted that several straightforward capital projects could reduce Swarthmore's
energy expenditures by as much as 15 percent.
Like SusCom, Mckinstry concluded that a
Sustainability Director would be vital to.
Swarthmore's continued sustainability efforts, in
part by offering expertise and guidance to a fragmented environmental movement on campus.
The Mckinstry audit is an example of the kind
of detailed sustainability analysis that environmentalists on campus are looking for. According
to Kolowrat, this needs to become a job for
Swarthmore's administration.
"SusCom discussions have led us to conclude
that a quick infusion of outside expertise would
have less benefit to the college than hiring someone who is charged with prioritizing this work
full-time," Kolowrat said.
A Sustainability Director would play an
administrative role in SusCom and the Climate
Action Committee. According to Camille
Robertson 'l3, a member of SusCom and
Earthlust, a Sustainability Director would be
most effective as a full-time position.
"When Swarthmore commits itself to achieving excellence and dedicates the resources and
staff to do that, we are incredibly successful,"
Robertson said. "I would love Swarthmore to
begin building an institutional cornerstone of
sustainability starting with a full time position
that could be a liaison among all the diverse sustainability groups but are restricted by time and
...

expertise."
According to therecommendations of SusCom,
"the most emphatic recommendation of the SPC
was to create the full time staff position of

The

Sustainability Director would support, coordinate
and provide expertise for college "greening" initiatives and communicate with the wider environmental action community. According to their
recommendation, SusCom is unable to perform
these tasks. SusCom believes that a Sustainability

its tradition of social responsibility and excellence in education.

are not sufficiently institutionalized. "A lot of the
sustainability efforts on campus are fragmented,"
said Jacob Phillips 'l3, a member of
Swarthmore's Green Advisory.
Services,
Maintenance,
Environmental
Facilities and other departments carry out sustainability projects. The problem, according to
Phillips, is that there is little coordination among

them.

According to Phillips, the best example of sustainability inefficiency is Swarthmore's composting efforts. The problem is that there are just too
many composting facilities and not enough collection. "Some of them are run by students, some
by the administration
As a result not enough
bins are being emptied. This has led to creating
smells and turning people away from composting," Phillips said.
In addition Phillips said that the "cost efficiency of bringing everything together is worth a single paycheck, especially when much of what sustainability does is save the college money."
Recently, colleges like Haverford, Bryn Mawr,
Middlebury and Dickinson have established similar positions. Neil Leary, Director of Dickinson's
Center for Sustainability Education, has led a
campaign of integrating sustainability issues into
the college curriculum and has been coordinating
student initiatives. According to Leary,

Many involved in the discusADVERTISEMENT
sion conveyed that, though
important, efficiency should be a
secondary concern. For one
thing, there is practical limitation to considering efficiency.
"SusCom is finding that monetizing the cost-saving effects of hiring a sustainability director is
difficult, if not downright impossible," Kolowrat said.
According to Kolowrat, the
college should consider that a

Danish photographer discusses art as tool for activism
BYSERAJEONG
sjeongX@swarthmore.edu

To introduce his lecture on social integration, Danish
social activist Jacob Holdt boldly said, "On the first day
arriving in America I was held at gun point and then raped
by a black homosexual." On Friday April X Holdt, a photographer, writer and lecturer, gave his fifth lecture at
Swarthmore, though it was his first in over a decade.
His introduction laid the foundation for his the lecture,
which covered several contemporary racial issues and a
inside glimpse of the violence that characterized life in
underclass America during the 1970s and 'Bos.
Alexander Hollander 'l2, organizer of the event, discovered Holdt's photography on the Internet and admired the
works' artistic quality and their capacity to promote
activism. Griffin Dowdy 13, interested in the academic
dimensions of Holdt's work, assisted Hollender in bringing
the artist to campus. Even though the the studio art and art
history departments primarily funded the lecture, Holdt
does not consider himself an artist. "I simply cannot see
myself as an artist. I've always seen myself as what the
Americans call it, a 'social activist.'" Even the term "social
activist" sits uneasily with Holdt, so he asked to be introduced as "just a vagabond from Denmark."
The lecture highlighted the importance of integration
with others in society, and brought to the forefront the
issue of ghettoization, which is the isolation of both social
and ethnic minorities. Focusing on the discrimination
against Muslims in Europe, Holdt compared the Muslims'
predicament to that of blacks in America. Also, he highlighted the issue of gay rights and argued that values ofheteronormativity remain the norm in many European countries.
For his message of social activism to appeal to students,
Holdt relied on his humor, as he attempted to emphasize
the life of glamour and adventure that is apparently attainable in social work. He considers a number of well-known
figures to be his friends including Sapphire, author of the
novel "Push," which inspired the film "Precious," and the
late Anita Roddick, who is the founder of the Body Shop.
Also, Elton John purchased one of Holdt's photos taken in
1973. Humorously, Holdt said, "See, there's money to be
made in social activism!"
Following his introduction, Holdt shared thoughts on
his most well-known collection entitled "American
Pictures," which is a four-hour photographic documentation of racism, particularly the oppression of America's
underclass during the '7os and 'Bos. In 1971, Holdt arrived in

America with just $4O, and the physical and sexual assault
inflicted on him upon his arrival inspired him to go on a
journey through the ghettos to explore where pain and
anger on the streets ofAmerica came from. Holdt explained
that his parents sent him a camera with the hopes of receiving proof ofhis experiences that he vividly described in letters sent home. Thus, he returned to Denmark with the
15,000 pictures that would come to form "American
Pictures," which became means of non-violent communication to help create social change.
In addition, Holdt shared stories on how he became the
first 'anti-racist" member and webmaster of the Klu Klux
Klan. He believes that members ofhate groups such as the
KKK are actually victims since many come from backgrounds of troubled childhoods. Thus, he feels these individuals are deserving of friendship and help. "I've only met
damaged people, not hateful people. They just need a little
help. If you treat oppressors with hate they will retaliate
with more hate," he said.
Holdt helped the KKK financially by allowing members
to sell his book, "American Pictures," the printed version of
his photographical documentary. Looking back, Holdt
acknowledges the irony of the KKK supporting anti-racism
artwork. "Life is just a joke! I got the leader of the KKK to
sell my anti-racism book," he said. In this light, Holdt
believes the KKK are misunderstood, not as racist as they
present themselves and should be considered a source of
identity and community rather than a representation of the
members' abject racism.
However, for some members of the audience the content
of the photographs Holdt presented in his lecture were
provocative and offensive. "He utilizes the content of sexuality, violence, substance abuse and other destructive acts
of marginalized people to make a profit while never truly
addressing and listening to those people he attempts to capture," Taylor Tucker 'l3 said, member of MULTi, the campus multiple heritage group.
Moreover, in Tucker's opinion, Holdt's lecture on the
continuing marginalization ofethnic groups, most specifically African-Americans, was unsubstantiated. "To literally see the 'shock doctor' tactics, PC Paint graphs that had
no statistical analysis and support, and lack of understanding about the historical and systemic issues that perpetuate racism, classism and injustice in our society was disgusting," she said.
Moreover, Tucker feels due to Holdt's perspective is
inherently biased and lacking critical thought."Jacob

any sense of his advantageous subjectivity that informs

what he sees, how people act around him and what is available to him," Tucker said.
In his lecture, Holdt also noted the current dormancy of
social activism as rallies that were once commonplace on
college campuses have yielded to the largely passive and
apathetic attitudes displayed by a large population of college students of this generation. Thus, Holdt argued in
favor of regenerating social activism since he believes the
activist mentality displayed especially during the 1980s can
be applied to the marginalization of certain racial groups
that still takes place today.
Ironically, the last time Holdt visited Swarthmore he
delivered his lecture to an audience of over 700 students.
Last week, however, the audience included about 20 members, which supports Holdt's belief that social activism has
waned. "I didn't realize that in the eighties he was big on
the college circuit. [Holdt] was very surprised that I found
out about him as a student at Swarthmore who had never
seen his work [in person]," Hollender said.
The lecture highlighted the need for different means of
presenting social issues to college students in a generation
where the youth are not necessarily inclined to rally and
protest as Holdt once did two decades ago. "The word of
mouth is dead. [Holdt] is kind of arcane at this point,"
Hollender said.

Professor to discuss Islamic religious dissimulation
BY STEVEN HAZEL
shazell@swarthmore.edu

Professor of religion Tariq al Jamil
will give a lecture titled "Hiding in Plain
Sight: Shi'i Islam, Secrecy and Religious
Dissimulation" today at 4:30 p.m. in the
Scheuer Room. Provost Constance
Hungerford asked al Jamil to share his
sabbatical research on Twelver Shi'ism,
the largest branch of Shi'a Islam, from a
new methodological perspective for the
benefit of his colleagues and students.
Al Jamil specializes in medieval
Islamic law within society, with a special
focus on Shi'ism. Unlike other Muslims,
Shi'ites believe that the Prophet
Muhammad's family and descendants
have special spiritual authority over the
entire Muslim community. Al Jamil has
studied relations between Shi'ites and
Sunnis, the largest Muslim denomination, as well as the social histories of
Iraq, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia. He
received his B.A. from Oberlin College
and later, his Masters and Ph.D. in religion from Princeton University before
teaching at Swarthmore as an assistant
professor of religion and the coordinator
of the program ofIslamic studies.
At Oberlin, al Jamil struggled with

nje .phoenix

choosing a major, and although he took a
variety of classes that he found fascinating, religion continued to turn up in his
path. "I was interested in religion

because I had taken a lot of different
courses and I kept seeing religion as a
subject matter that intersected many different interests of mine. I was interesting
even in physics. I
in many subjects
saw religion everywhere I turned," al
Jamil said.
Swarthmore's religion department
considers the discipline as a cornerstone
of the liberal arts education. Professor of
religion Mark Wallace said, "Religious
studies enables the development of crucial aptitudes
critical thinking, communication competence, interpersonal
awareness and intercultural literacy
necessary for success in a global socie...

ty."
During this semester, al Jamil is
teaching "The Religion of Islam: The
Islamic Humanities" and "Holy War,
Martyrdom and Suicide in Christianity,
Judaism and Islam" and he has pursued
his passion with research, as well."My
interest in pre-modern Islam was

because I had an interest in contempo-

rary Islam and a genealogical impulse to
trace the sources of contemporary issues

and to think in complex terms about how
Islam ended up where it did in terms of
social groups and politics," al Jamil said.
"I wanted to think deeper." Specifically,
his research focuses on pre-modern religious identity, the transmission of
knowledge in Islam and women in
Islamic law.
The lecture will discuss the application of new methodological approaches
to Twelver Shi'ism's practice ofreligious
dissimulation, or "taqiyya." The majority of Shi'ites are Twelver Shi'ites, who
believe in 12 divinely ordained leaders
called "Imams." Religious dissimulation,
which is called "taqiyya," is a Shi'ite
practice where a Shi'ite can lie about
their faith in order to save a life. Al
Jamil challenges the traditional legal
and theological frameworks used to discuss this religious dissimulation in
Islamic societies and believes that the
methods used fail to properly explain the
practice of taqiyya in real social situations. "[I hope] to create a new way of
thinking about these issues. Rather than
go to conventional literature, I hope [students and scholars] think differently
about religious dissimulation and think
critically about the existing sources," al
Jamil said.

ApriJ7,2Qll

In particular, al Jamil will speak on
religious dissimulation during the 13th
and 14th centuries in Iraq. Much of the
lecture will cover the four historiographical problems in a new methodological
light. These problems include a severe
lack of information available about the

practice of religious dissimulation, and
the existing information through the perspectives of different medieval authors is
difficult to interpret. Additionally, al
Jamil will examine the complex relationship between religious dissimulation
and heresy. "I think what is most interesting is that when you think about
secrecy you don't think about secrecy as
a strategy for both the safeguarding of

information that can be damaging and
the cultivation of power by withholding
the secret from others," al Jamil said.
Along with updating colleagues on al
Jamil's work, the lecture will introduce a
new topic to explore for students interested in Islamic or religious studies.
"[Shi'ite Islam] is not a subject that I
come into contact with very often in my
courses, but [because] I am interested in
world events, I hope that the lecture will
both inform me and maybe even inspire
me to study religion," Claire Graham 'l4
said.

Conference hosts college humor publications
BY SUSANA MEDEIROS AND DINA ZINGARO
smedeirl@swarthmore.edu, dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

This past weekend, Princeton University's "The
Princeton Tiger" hosted the first National Intercollegiate
Humor Conference. The conference included 14 colleges
and university humor publications, who gathered to listen
to guest speakers and comedians, compete in write-a-thons
and explore the future of comedy and humor publications.
College publications in attendance included, among others, Brown University's "The Brown Noser," Cornell's
"Cornell Lunatic," University of North Carolina's
"BoUNCe," Vanderbilt University's "The Slant" and
Swarthmore's "Spike Magazine."
"The Princeton Tiger," Princeton's humor magazine,
organized the conference largely through the efforts of
Tim Matchen 'l2, chief operating officer, and Jim Valcourt
'l2, President. "The major goal of the conference,"
Valcourt said, "is to create a college humor community, to
network and have people from other colleges get to know
each other, to expose people to the idea of doing humor as
a career
and to have fun." Editor-in-chief Myra Gupta
'l2, commented on the competitive nature of the conference, where schools worked in separate and mixed groups
to workshop articles. "It's the Model UN of funny," she
...

said.

In preparation, Matchen and Valcourt contacted dozens
of colleges to participate in the conference. Once they discovered there was interest, they began to contact both publications in print and on the web, such as The Onion and
CollegeHumor that might be interested in participating in
the event. Immediately, CollegeHumor was keen on sending their Executive Editor Streeter Siedell to make a presentation and potentially recruit students. As the Executive
Editor of CollegeHumor since 2005, Siedell joined the weba
site when there were only seven or eight writers
decade later it is a profitable company that rakes in 10 million in ad sales per month (by comparison, The Onion or
Funny or Die rake in 3 or 4 million).
At the conference, Siedell spoke about his struggle to
find a steady-paying job in the humor industry, and offered
advice to the conference delegates. "If you can deal with
being weird, ruining your relationships and making no
money, then comedy is the thing for you," Siedell said.
Also, Siedell shed light on the business side of humor
and in particular, emphasized the precarious relations
between comedians and their advertisers. "Yes, someone's
giving you money to make dick jokes, and it's excellent,
but at the same time you have to deal with the bad stuff...
there are people [marketing execs, advertisers] who like to
work with comedy but aren't really funny," Siedell said.
Working with advertisers who often say they want to
target the profitable 18-22 year old market, but don't want
to put faith in comedians to do their job
is a challenge.
The purse strings that come with getting ad revenue often
prove problematic; for example, only recently was
CollegeHumor allowed to use the word "shit" on the website's homepage. "You need them to get your paycheck,"
Siedell said, "but you also need to stand up for your jokes."
As SiedeU addressed the business side of humor in a
post-college world, the rest of the conference sought to
solve some of the financial problems that college humor
magazines are facing now. In a meeting among representatives of the magazines at the conference, "The Princeton
Tiger" introduced the idea of forming a humor coalition of
college humor magazines to generate ad sales.
Several humor magazines, though they receive funding
from their respective college, also rely on print and web
advertisement to stay afloat. Thus, the coalition would
hope to convince advertisers to buy packaged placement
in a variety of humor magazines rather than dealing with
each separately. "We want to generate revenue for the
coalition [and] spread awareness on college humor magazines," Matchen said.
Though many of the kinks still need to be ironed out,
the hope is that the 14 conference delegates could serve as
a test drive for what in a few years could be a national
coalition for college humor publications. Many of the delegates expressed enthusiasm about "The Princeton Tiger's"
proposal. "[For] the complexities involved to get this thing
started, the benefits far outweigh the challenges," David
Faulkner 'll, the editor in chief of University of Michigan's
"Gargoyle," said. Editor of Yale University's "The Yale
Record" Dana Zhu said that if college humor publications
"band together," they'll be "far more attractive to adver...

8

tisers." She commended the promise of the coalition and
the bonds formed during the conference. "The idea of
being a greater associationand working together as a larger unit... is really cool on a college level," she said. Also,
the coalition is considering creating a RSS feed that will
compile the latest articles for display on individual publications' websites in order to increase the traffic flow
amongst the coalition members. "There is an audience for
college humor magazines and we want to try to reach that
market," Matchen said.
Currently, "Spike Magazine" does not feature advertisements, but plans to consider making a change with the
hope that the decision would increase its operating budget. In light of this, Peter Liebenson 'll, co-editor of "Spike
Magazine," said, "We put out every copy of our latest issue
and I'm still hearing from people who never got one, so
we're exploring how we might increase our circulation for
next semester."
With the chance at the conference to compare "Spike"
to other publications, the magazine is currently debating
how it can incorporate more artwork and advertisements
within its pages, as well as how it can increase campus
awareness. "Aside from meeting some cool peeps, the
chance to learn about how other magazines were put

together will keep us thinking about how we can improve
[Spike]," Liebenson said. Timothy Bernstein 'l3, co-editor,
agreed. "It was a great opportunity to look at how other
magazines were doing things and to see the comic sensibilities behind all of them." Though he is graduating this
spring, Liebenson feels optimistic about the conference's
future and its potential to "forge a community among college magazines." Considering the future of the conference,
Liebenson believes that two full days of events and workshopping would greatly improve the quality of the event.
Sunday's closing ceremony acknowledged both the
struggles and triumphs humor publications currently
face. "There's still a place for print media ancHhe existence of a magazine and there's something nice about a
magazine you can distribute on campus," Matchen said.
Even though many of the publication delegates maintain
their own website, each distributed copies of their work at
the conference with pride. In his lecture, Streeter underlined print's promising and distinguishing feature:
"Quality," he said. "That's what's going to keep print

media alive."

decisions as to where to put away some
of our saved money and the best
recourse is to have our nest egg grow
and expand. We may think it's early, but
saving smart now enables us later to
have enough for a down payment on a
house, a rainy day fund, our wedding,
our kids' college funds and even retirement!
In terms of retirement funds, the two
most common options are Individual
Retirement Accounts, more commonly
known as IRAs, and 401(k)s. If you are a
college student, self-employed or work
for a company that does not offer 401(k)s,
a Roth IRA would be your best option. It
someone told you there was a way to
earn tax free money for retirement
beginning in college, would you turn it
down? Any money you put into a Roth
IRA grows completely tax free, which

f

means you won't owe the government a

single penny when you cash it out in
retirement. Start saving while in college,
because the earlier you start, the less
money you will have to initially invest to
reach the same goal. Why? It's the power
of compounding.
401(k) retirement plans are a better

choice than IRAs because the contribution to a 401(k) is so much greater. The
only drawback is that your employer
needs to offer this plan, and you must be
21 or older. Unlike 401(k) plans that are
offered by employers, you would individually choose an IRA program with a brokerage account that presented suitable
annual fees and trading commissions.
Setting up an IRA takes a little research,
but simply requires downloading and
signing application forms sent with a
check to fund your account. Under the
IRA program, you are only allowed to
add $5,000 annually. The limit imposed
upon 401(k)s is $10,500. When you also
consider the potential for matching
funds from employers as well as profit
sharing contributions, the number can
rise to $25,000.
Conventional thinking is to put the
money into an investment account, and
have a fund manager "manage". our
money since, of course, they are the
money professionals who advertise
exponential growth. Mutual fund managers are financial intermediaries who
are set up to receive your money and
then make investments with your
money.
However, according to Justin Fox
from TIME, 66.21 percent of mutual

funds underperformed the average
return of the stock market from 20042008. When I visited an esteemed financial institution in Boston as a high
school junior during the college admis-

sions process, I talked with one of the
managers who proudly elucidated how
his passive tax strategy group was
linked to the performance of the S&P 500
index (index of the top 500 best companies), and how his goal was to stay within 0.2-0.4 percent of the performance of
that index. I was shocked that their goal
and mandate was not to handily beat but
to stay averagely linked to the index. In
simplest terms, you can't afford to pay
for fund managers that don't earn their
fees. If a fund has fees of two percent and
only matches the market with
its stock picks before paying
those fees, then you'll enc
up with a return that's

the market's, year

if you subtract the 2 percent fee from the
performance of their fund, which is +/0.2-0.4 percent of the index, you are guaranteed to underperform the index to
which their fund is pegged. I wouldn't
mind paying a 2 percent fee for superior
performance to double or triple the average, but to pay for underperformance is
preposterous.

email due to a 12-hour time difference in Indonesia.
However incredulous such a situation may seem, it is a
reality in Indonesia where the new continues to deny that
500,000 to a million people were killed in 1965-1966, and
another one million detainedfor 10 years or more without

Challenges ofher work:
Transformations to peace, reconciliation and democracy in some cases happen suddenly, but in others, they
make take place over many decades. "If you want to work
in the area of human rights and justice, I think you need
to be prepared for long distance runs and not short
sprints!" Soedjatmako said.
After working alongside victims of the 1965 atrocities,
who are now in their late 80s, and even victims' children
who continue to campaign for justice, Soedjatmako feels
inspired by their determination and commitment. "[The
victims] have had to learn to pace themselves because the
barriers to justice are many," she said.
Since human rights courts in Indonesia have produced
a 100 percent acquittal rate for perpetrators of serious
crimes ever brought to trial, the biggest challenge is confronting impunity. "For victims this is a deep disappointment, sort of an insult on top of the suffering they have
experienced," Soedjatmako said.
Thus, the team learned to be creative and find other
ways to continue to press for truth and justice. In light of
the challenges of her work, she quoted Martin Luther
King Jr., "The arc of the moral universe is long but it
bends towards justice."

Path to her career choice:
Soedjatmako was first exposed to human rights issues
in Indonesia as a young woman when she worked on
social justice issues in places that were often in the midst

Domestic Abuse Project in Media, and later wrote her thesis on the general violence against women. Following
graduation, Soedjatmako worked on reproductive health

When she moved back to Indonesia, she worked as a

gender officer for Oxfam, which is an international con
federation that works to find lasting solutions to poverty {&
and injustice. Soedjatmako said, "I am not sure there was j[3

Richmond Comedy Swatdown, a
stand-up comedy night fundraiser
featuring six professional comedians
as well as Swarthmore's own Tarit

Coach Eric Wagner first thought of
the idea after hearing stories of assistant coach Ciaran Dalton's brother
Pat Dalton. Though he grew up in
Swarthmore, Dalton currently lives
in the Richmond area and is just getting started in the stand-up comedy
business.
In 1989, Wagner remembers the
head coach he was working With had
a friend who was a professional
comedian. He invited him to campus
for a fundraiser, and now Wagner has
decided to do a similar fundraiser

Schools must lead campuses away from sexual violence
Though there have been a few incidents of sexual harassment and
assault made high profile on the
national level in the past decade, these
stories were not accompanied by a
larger discussion of the culture surdiscrimination,

harassment and assault on college
campuses.
Now, following the issuance of new
guidelines under Title IX for the
receipt of federal funding, announced
Monday by Vice President Joe Biden
and Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan, and the Title IX complaint
filed against Yale last week, the country seems poised to begin a broad,
much needed discussion about campus
attitudes and procedures regarding
sexual discrimination, harassment
and assault.
Sixteen Yale students
12 women
and four men
filed a formal complaint with the Office for Civil Rights
at the Department of Education on
March 15 following attempts to address
their grievances within Yale's system.
The students' allegations of Title IX
violations primarily cite the university's inadequate management of many
incidents of sexual misconduct,
including anonymous testimony about
Yale's unsatisfactory responses to specific cases of sexual harassment and
assault.
Currently, the Office for Civil
Rights is conducting an investigation
of the university, and no litigation is
underway. Representatives will come
to campus and speak to students and

If a college, university or school district fails to comply with the new
guidelines, they could lose their federal funding. For many colleges and universities, this funding makes up at
least a majority of theirresearch fund-

But schools should have more than
just a monetary incentive to comply
with and go above and beyond the new
guidelines
they have a moral obligation to provide students with a safe
place to learn, and this means that the
responsibility of addressing sexual
violence lies with the college or university.
"Schools have a responsibility to
bring justice to victims," Vice
President Biden said Wednesday in a
conference call with college and university presidents and the press. In the
same call, Secretary Duncan emphasized the importance of education as a
deterrent to sexual violence both within schools and outside their reach.
The guidelines put forth are a much
needed step forward in institutionalizing norms of prevention and adequate
treatment of sexual harassment and
assault, but, as Biden and Duncan
emphasized, more than compliance is
needed to make changes in the culture
of discrimination and violence.
In addition to ending their practices
of hushing up incidents that could
prove to be bad publicity, colleges and
universities must change the environment of tolerance of discrimination
and harassment based on gender
and/or sexuality.

The right reasons for intervention overcome doubts

Not too long ago I considered myself an absolute
pacifist. Influenced by my
mother, whose Quaker heritage informed a principled

opposition to killing, regard-

Jon Erwin-Frank
Sensible Socialist
mmmm^

less of context, I wholly
rejected the notion of just
war, going as far as to
rationalize the superiority
of a pacifist response to the
Second World War. Inspired
by Gandhi, Martin Luther
King and late 20th century
social movements, I imagined near limitless possibilities for radical or militant
nonviolence. The words of

King, that "hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence," became more of an unbending doctrine than wisdom
applied to nonviolent protest in a specific democratic context.
I had always retained some ambivalence. My father,
whose firm faith in just war was rooted in his experience as
a Jewish man growing up in the postwar period, consistently cited the Holocaust as an example of an ongoing
atrocity of epic proportion, bound up in war, that not only
merited but demanded a military response. Usually halfheartedly, I sometimes parroted arguments I had read about
fascism's internal rot and potential non-violent responses
such as bombing transportation lines.
Ironically, it was at nominally Quaker Swarthmore
College that I came to question the merits of absolute pacifism. From discussions with an opinionated first-year
roommate who rightly called my position naive to reading
about the terrible consequences of the world's inaction in
Rwanda, Cambodia and other locations of genocide, my college experience pushed me towards a better-informed
endorsement of a relatively new doctrine in international
affairs, the "responsibility to protect." While I maintain that
violent revolution is rarely an arbiter of peace or progres-

sive change, and political or economic interests almost
never serve as legitimate justification for war, I have
become thoroughly convinced by the arguments for the use

of force to prevent genocide.
The main idea is relatively simple: if peoples' lives are
imminently threatened by violence and outside forces have
the capacity to protect them withoutrisking commensurate
or even significant loss of life, then those outside forces
have a duty to protect. Context matters. Violent protest in a
stable democracy might accomplish little more than begetting chaos and more violence, but protection of people at
risk of genocide both saves lives in the short-term and contributes to the building of a moral world order. Conflating
these situations under the umbrella of "violence" is perhaps
the most serious error of an essentialist, absolute pacifism.
In reality, the application of responsibility to protect
almost inevitably poses daunting challenges to those with
the force to carry it out. Slaughter ofcivilians may occur in
a slow, diffuse and unpredictable manner. Both sides of a
civil war might target significant numbers of civilians,
requiring a costly, large and not necessarily effective peace
keeping force to successfully protect people. In peacekeeping and genocide prevention, as in all international endeavors, leaders must employ careful cost-benefit analyses. Yet
when effective protection is feasible and intervention poses
minimal or insignificant risk to foreign armed forces, there
is a moral imperative for action.
Many critics of the great power intervention in Libya
have dismissed the notion that the purpose of military
action was to protect Libyan citizens from potential mass
killings. They forget or downplay the fact that Qaddafi did
not hesitate to use snipers and deadly force to crack down
on protesters, even those attending the funerals of fellow
dissidents. The few reports coming from those re-conquered
and besieged cities in western Libya suggest a pattern of
brutal and deadly crackdown. Ultimately, it may have been
Qaddafi's threat that he would show "no mercy, no pity" in
retaking the rebetheld city of Benghazi that pushed world
leaders to adopt the UN resolution that quickly brought the
allied strikes that relieved the threat to that city.
Like supporters of TARP and fiscal stimulus at home,

those who support intervention in Libya face the difficult
reality that preventing catastrophe is often costly and
unpopular but rarely pays political dividends. We will
never know how Qaddafi's forces would have carried out
the capture of Benghazi and eastern Libya. Given the likely
possibilities, that is almost certainly a good thing.
Another common criticism claims that even if Qaddafi
was likely to kill thousands of Libyans, nothing distinguishes the situation in Libya from that in numerous other
countries throughout the world. Without the will or the
resources to police the world, we cannot arbitrarily choose
to intervene in Libya simply because unrest in the Middle
East has become a salient issue in the media and in politics.
While it may be true that recent events and media attention
catalyzed action in Libya, it is not true that nothing distinguishes it from other countries with leaders prone to violent oppression.
In Libya, protesters seized the eastern half of the country with relatively little fighting. The geography of the conflict has been relatively straightforward. The threat to
Libyan people was not from marauding gangs of thugs or
small bands of soldiers dispersed over a wide area, but form
an approaching army. Coalition forces could relatively easily prevent the capture of rebel-head Benghazi by Qaddafi's
forces approaching from the west and south.
Furthermore, the distinction between the government
and the rebels is less ambiguous than in many cases. While
they are certainly not a homogenous group and have no
clear political orientation, the rebels almost assuredly do
not pose any kind of large-scale threat to civilians in areas
they control.

Decisive international action to protect civilians in
Libya and, as of Monday, in the Ivory Coast may represent
a significant break from the excessive caution and inaction
that allowed atrocities like those in Rwanda to take place. I
believe this intervention was about more than just a great
power grudge against a defiant strongman. As new crises
emerge around the world, I hope world leaders will prove
me right.

and

founder of the American Federation of
Labor, I am skeptical of collective bargaining in the public sector. Throughout

the Wisconsin budget blitz, many on the
Left, including our POTUS himself, demonized Governor Scott Walker for his decision to halt bargaining-power for state
employees.
deficit-reducing
Under
Walker's
scheme, public workers will be forced to
contribute 5.8 percent of their salaries to

pensions and 12.6 to healthcare premiums. Despite the rush to liken Governor
Walker to Darth Vader and bemoan a

of progressive legend Fightin' Bob La
Follette, I considered ordering one of
those "I stand with Scott Walker" T-shirts.
One, because I like online shopping. Two,
because I agree with the 43-year-old
Republican rookie.
To be clear, I find provisions for private union rights first outlined in the 1935
Wagner Act to be staples of the American
workforce. This stems from the well-docu-

mented clash between management and

14

labor in the wake of the Industrial Wave.
A sad saying left over from WWI is that
young men had a better chance surviving
the frontline than they did the West
Virginia coalmines.
For the private factory worker, the
contracted carpenter, or the outsourced
electrician, the employer serves to make a
profit from his labor. If the employer's
wages or benefits are miserly, the workers
have a right, under Labor Board policy, to
bargain for a fairer share. This is the risk
Mr. Scrooge takes when he decides to
scrounge a living business. Regardless of
the hoopla in the heartland though, the
taxpayer is no Rockefeller.
As Los Angeles Times columnist Jonah
Goldberg chides, "Do you recall the Great
DMV cave-in of 1959? How about the travails of second-grade teachers recounted
in Upton Sinclair's famous schoolhouse
sequel to 'The Jungle?' No? Don't feel bad,

because no such horror stories exist."
Unlike the contentious, sometimes
tragic events that launched bargaining
rights in industry, President Kennedy's
1962 executive order to lift the bargaining
ban on government workers was purely
political. Political scientist Daniel
DiSalvo highlights that Kennedy's maneuver on public unions was motivated to
solidify liberal bastions in Wisconsin and
New York. It worked. For 50 years.
Aware that Republican majorities in
both the Senate and general assembly
would override their objections and strive
to balance the state budget once and for
all, the Democratic caucus did what any
law-abiding posse would do: they fled the
state. For those of us following the
Midwestern mayhem, this prolonged
road-trip felt a bit like a month-long viewing of "Little Miss Sunshine," but without
all the catharsis.

In the interim, undergraduates, labor
ringleaders and liberal heavyweights like
Jesse Jackson and Michael Moore flocked

to Madison. Despite the "Era of Civility"
that was supposed to dawn after the
Tucson shootings, Obama titled Walker's
attempts at fiscal accountability "an

assault on unions." Mind you, Obama's
spending freeze on federal employees is
more rigid than Walker's plan. At the
same time, the Madison mob dispersed
effigies of Walker, daintily adorned with a
Hitler mustache. I guess respectful words
and political dignity make occupying a
state capital a whole lot less fun.
As the plague of protests caught fire
from Kenosha to Superior, school teachers organized a string of "sick-outs,"
reneging on their classrooms in order to
shout in the streets, "We teach the children! We are the mighty teachers!" This
sounds more like a Little League catcall
than the wisdom of America's educators.
I've heard multiple pundits assert that
the right to collective bargaining in the
public sector is what separates modern
man from slavery. This has an emotional
ring to it, so few have paused for want of
logic. In actuality, what separates police
officers, teachers, and firemen from slavery is that they collect a paycheck that,
in the Lockian sense, their efforts are
their property. Generally, public positions
have been somewhat lower-paying, in
return for heightened job security. Indeed,
24 U.S States have never legislated publicbargaining rights.
Yet in the economic plunge, Wisconsin,
which became the first in the nation to
grant collective bargaining powers in
1959, found itself in a quandary.
Wisconsin was bound to unionized workers who not only held assured positions
but also the assurance of escalating pay-

checks
buffered by taxpayers without
any such say.
I am indebted to the many public
school teachers who taught me about fractions, the French Revolution and filibusters. I am not suggesting that public
workers dance in economic bliss. But
under slavery, upward mobility wasn't
just hard, it was illegal. Comparing a reasonable healthcare contribution to forced
labor is an insult to those whose lives
were dictated by the crudest institution
this nation has ever known.
Some Huffington Post commentators,
obviously inspired by the Middle Eastern
meltdown occurring a hemisphere away,
commented on the remarkably "peaceful"
nature of the protests, as if fanfare over
budget cuts and firepower against bloody
old tyrants are much the same thing.
Other commentators insisted "Democracy
is at work" in Madison. If this is democracy, James Madison himself must be
experiencing some restless eternal slumber.
My understanding of a republic is that
votes matter. Elections matter. Elected
officials matter. Should Gov. Walker be as
dimwitted as the professors at University
of Wisconsin-Madison say he is, he'll surely be removed from office next cycle, his
policies will be repealed, and the rest of
America can go back to thinking that all
Badger State citizens wear cheese-hats.
In the meantime, though, Democratic
state senators have an obligation to show
up for work, not cost their constituents
$400,000 for funding a legislature that wasn't allowed to vote. Judges have a duty to
read the letter of the law, not the astrology leaves that whisper delay tactics, rhetoric and snarky protest slogans.

with me.
According to Eva B
Fortunately, due to the
lnternet, I have a plethora
of alternative options. In
recent years, through blogs and social networking
sites, I have discovered artists like Jupiter Sunrise,
James Vincent McMorrow, Regina Spektor, Kate
Nash, Ida Maria, The National, Band of Horses and
Wale. Most of the music I listen to is not hip-hop,
pop or R&B but instead soft rock and indie acoustic.
I connect with the raw vulnerability, the heavy use
of string instruments and the authentic unaltered
voice.
Last weekend, I was unexpectedly introduced to
Seattle rapper Macklemore, by way of one wrong
click. While he doesn't label himself as aware, he
recognizes others might. "If you want to you can go
and label me conscious but remember there's a kid
at a bus stop beat boxing whose life is going to be
affected by what's inside of his walkman," he raps
on his 2005 song "I Said Hey" off the album "The
Language of My World."
A Feb. 9 article in the Seattle Times describes
him as a "3-minute storyteller" with "conceptual
songs that hook an audience by shock or heartstrings, and concentrate on a specific topic." This is
evidenced in the track "White Privilege," where

Macklemore challenges his situated reality as a
white MC. He believes while cultural appropriation
is distinctly American, it doesn't automatically
absolve him of what he describes as "claiming" a
culture that does not belong to him.
Throughout the song he sheds light on the
hypocrisy of white privilege arguing, "White rappers albums really get the most spins," "Hip-hop is
gentrified and where will all the people live," and
"We still owe 'em 40 acres, now we've stolen their 16
bars." The song, like many of his others, is quite
reflective and self-critical but even the rapper
admits the very injustice of his popularity, "If a
black MC examined race, there goes half their fan
base."
Wellesley professor Michael P. Jeffries 'O2, author
of "Thug Life: Race, Gender and the Meaning of HipHop" makes mention of this double standard
between white and black rappers. In a Guardian
article "Grammys 2011: Eminem's Rage is Towering
but is it Righteous?" Jeffries noted that Eminem has
been disproportionately rewarded by the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. He
argued, "No black artist who is as publicly and consistently angry as Eminem" has attained nearly as
much success at the long-established award show or
in the industry in general.
However, when thinking of the greatness of
Macklemore, I wouldn't exactly call him an appropriator. As Jeffries articulates in his book, "the narrative of black purity in hip-hop is a myth" that
"thrives in the commercial sphere in large part
because representations of spectacular, oppositional
ghetto blackness are captivating and salable to consumers in a range of social milieus."
My attraction to Macklemore and a lot of white
indie artists does not come without an awareness
that many artists of color are not supported when
they want to make similar music. One of
Macklemore's most compelling songs, "Otherside,"
grapples with overcoming his serious drug addic-

tion, one that kept him dormant and unproductive
for five years during the peak ofhis career. Assisted
by the extraordinary production of Ryan Lewis, the
confessional song is deeply moving.
Macklemore warns his audience that "we live on
the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us" before
testifying to his own battle with Syrup and Percocet.
He even shares the grim reality of moving back into
his parents' home at the age of 25. "Otherside," critically praised for its content and substance, is an
impressive song but it is also a tremendous privilege.
We live in a society that constructs and upholds a
black masculinity not conducive to vulnerable
expressions. Furthermore, the white corporate ownership of the mainstream music industry does not
think it profitable to invest in black artists who
refuse to dumb it down. Rather than cultural appropriation, this is perhaps the greater cause for concern
the homogeneous ownership of commercial
artistic content. With the rising influence of the
Internet, it will be interesting to see how much that
power and control diversifies, if at all.
When Macklemore was asked about the changing
racial landscape of hip-hop, he revealed that 80 percent of the crowd at his shows are white. "My
friends of color feel alienated from their own scene,"
he explained of the growing reality of the Seattle rap
community.
Macklemore ultimately concludes this majority
white audience is not necessarily a problem but
instead something to watch and have a consistent
dialogue about. I believe his reasoning is far too
simplistic and does not engage the invisible privilege he claims to understand. This is not to say
Macklemore must make constant apology for his
race or his fan base but he certainly has the platform to engage and problematize the double standards that keep his friends at a distance.

U.S. should send more non-military support abroad

DYLAN R. MATTHEWS
thecrimson.harvard.eclu, Apr. 5, 2011

The United States government
should be spending more money—a lot
more money—helping people in other
countries. On this much I agree with
advocates of the war in Libya.
Compared to other government spending, the Libya war costs a pittance. The
operation required $6OO million in its
first week, a mere 0.016 percent of a
budget totaling $3.8 trillion this fiscal
year.
But when compared to the $8.7 billion Obama's budget sets aside for global health programs at the State
Department and USAID, or the SLI billion total budget of the Millennium
Challenge Corporation, it starts to look
like a significant foreign aid program.
Given that, it is worth asking
whether airstrikes in Libya are an
effective foreign aid program and, if
they are, whether they're cost-effective
as well. If that $6OO million isn't actually producing results, then we shouldn't
be spending it. If there are other interventions that could do more good for
the same money, we should spend the
money on them instead.
It's hard to say, at this point,
whether the Libya intervention is
doing good in humanitarian terms.
There is no doubt that Muammar
Gaddafi was attacking his own people,
and, as British Prime Minister David

THE PHOENIX

W. D. Cameron has said, there was reason to fear a massacre as Gaddafi closed
in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi.
But we have to balance this averted
catastrophe against the human cost of
continuing Libya's civil war. It is possible that by preventing the rebels from
being crushed, the allied intervention
will produce more casualties than a
quick Gaddafi victory would have.
The intervention's long-term aftershocks also give reason to doubt its
effectiveness as a humanitarian measure. Some political scientists, most
notably the University of Texas at
Austin's Alan J. Kuperman, have
argued that humanitarian interventions create a moral hazard problem.
Rebels in other countries may take
the Libya war as a sign that the US and
NATO will support them ifthey launch
an insurrection. It hardly seems like a
win, in humanitarian terms, to encour-

likely-to-be-crushed
age
violent,
revolts, rather than nonviolent civil
resistance of the kind that succeeded in
Tunisia and Egypt.
This is not to say that the Libya
intervention will be a net loss for
human welfare. It could well end up
helping more than it hurts. The point is
that we are radically uncertain as to
whether it will work. This is especially
concerning given that the $6OO plus million being spent in Libya could be
devoted instead to interventions we
know can work.

Over the past decade, a group of
economists, centered at MlT's Poverty
Action Lab, have taken to using randomized controlled experiments to
determine, with social scientific rigor,
what bang-for-the-buck certain foreign
aid programs get.
The results are encouraging. PAL
studies have shown, for example, that
spending $lOO on chlorine treatment for
water sources in Kenya can prevent
hundreds of potentially deadly diarrheal incidents. Meanwhile, $lOO spent
informing families in Madagascar
about the benefits of education results
in students attending school for a total
of 40 additional years.
The takeaway is that there are very
cost-effective ways to help a lot of people in the developing world. Obviously,
scaling this up would take work, but
spending $6OO million and knowing that
one is producing 240 million more years
of school attendance in Africa seems
like a better choice than spending it to
get whatever the results of the Libya
intervention will be.
More to the point, existing, largescale government foreign aid programs
are showing results. To give just one
example, AIDS research groups have
noted that the GOP's proposed $1 billion in global health cuts could stop
AIDS treatment for a half million people, eliminate education and housing
for 300,000 orphans, and keep 3.9 million people from receiving malaria

flpft T, 2ftf1

treatments.

And there's the rub. While a $6OO
million intervention in Libya can be
launched without a hitch, the White
House and Congressional Democrats
will have to fight tooth and nail to preserve a similar level of funding for global health programs. The American
political climate, it would appear, only
allows humanitarian assistance when
it's pursued at gunpoint.
This cycle is self-perpetuating. The
intervention has reversed
Libya
momentum within Congress for
defense cuts, meaning that debt reduction efforts will likely focus on programs for the poor at home and abroad
rather than on waste at the Pentagon.
So next time a choice like the one
presented by Libya arises, we will have
a well-financed Pentagon and emaciated aid programs, and once again the
military option will look more attractive.
The U.S. government should start
taking the welfare of people abroad
more seriously across the board. The
fact that the world's richest country
spends so little of its resources preventing people abroad from sickness and
death is a moral travesty of the first
order.
But taking the interests of people
abroad seriously means investing in
humanitarian endeavors that we know
will work. We just do not know that
about the Libya war.

Men's, women's tennis breeze past Gettysburg

Penn Park should have AstroTurf for field hockey
BY ARI SEIFTER
dailypennsylvanian.com, Apr. 5, 2011

Ever since my elementary school
years, my mother has often implored
me to follow an old family adage:
"Take pride in everything you put
your name on."
While pondering the potential addition of an AstroTurf field for the varsity field hockey team, the Penn
administration should consider the
same advice.
If the AstroTurf isn't part of Penn
Park when it's unveiled this summer,
it realistically won't be built any time
in the near future. It's timefor Penn to
either step up in support of field hockey or step aside.
In 2004, Penn replaced Franklin
Field's AstroTurf with the softer, safer
and more grass-like Sprinturf. That
decision was a no-brainer because
Sprinturf is now preferred for almost

16

every sport.

The notable exception is field hockey, where the faster-paced AstroTurf
carpet surface is the overwhelming
standard.
It's no coincidence Penn field hockey has struggled to compete in the Ivy
League since winning the title in 2004.
Penn coach Colleen Fink told The
Daily Pennsylvanian that eight of the
11 Division I field hockey teams without an AstroTurf field are somewhere
in the bottom 20 programs in the
league. North Carolina coach Karen
Shelton added that "nobody with a
serious program plays on anything
but AstroTurf or a carpet surface."
An AstroTurf field was part of the
original plans for Penn Park, and
while it's still under consideration,
Penn is leaning toward adding two
Sprinturf fields instead.
The utilitarian advantages of
Sprinturf are compelling enough that

Penn might be entirely justified in
scrapping the AstroTurf project.
The two surfaces should have similar costs, and while Sprinturf fields
are preferable for a wide array of campus activities
including varsity,
club and intramural teams and student recreational use
AstroTurf
would mostly be advantageous for just
the 22 women on the field hockey

team.

Investing in field hockey won't provide a financial return, and it won't
have any palpable impact on school
spirit or alumni donations
but
those aren't the principal goals of Ivy
League athletic departments anyway.
As Athletic Director Steve Bilsky
put it last fall, "You primarily have an
athletic program for the educational
value for the people who are participating."
But what kind of experience will
the field hockey team have when it is

April 7, 201

perennially struggling to compete in
the Ivy League or even convince other

Division I schools to play road games
on the wrong surface?
Until now, Penn hasn't had a realistic alternative for an AstroTurf venue,
but the final allocation of Penn Park
will be a barometer of the University's
commitment to providing the program
with an even playing field in Ivy

League competition.
Penn might be right to consider the
bigger picture rather than cater to the

needs of a few.
But if the administration isn't even
prepared to provide a single specialized surface amidst the perfect storm
of eastward expansion, then maybe
Penn field hockey should go the way of
ice hockey and be dropped from varsity to club team status.
Ultimately, Penn should either take
pride in the field hockey program or
not put its name on it at all.

2011 Major League Baseball season predictions
BY NICK HARBIST

nharbil@swarthmore.edu

Tis the season for baseball predictions and having read
about a dozen online, I feel compelled to give my own rendition. I also want to see if I can do better than my roommate from last year, who wrote a few articles like this for
The Phoenix. He famously predicted that trading for Cliff
Lee instead of Roy Halladay would cost the Phillies the
2009 Worlds Series (quality call). But the Yankees did beat
the Phillies so I suppose he had the last laugh. What are
my qualifications for this endeavor? Well, I played baseball and I have an impeccable fantasy baseball record
(fourth to last and second
to last in my 2010 leagues,
baby!). So without further
adieu, here we go.
Disclaimer: I am a huge
Phillies fan. Does that mean I'm biased? Yes. Does that bother me? Have you ever met a Phillies fan before?

GUEST COLUMN

AL West: Texas Rangers
The Rangers won the division handily last year and
moved on to The Series before falling to the Giants. Their
offense is top of the line with Josh Hamilton, lan Kinsler,
Nelson Cruz and off-season addition Adrian Beltre, while
their pitching is acceptable, particularly in the far end of
the bullpen. But the loss of CliffLee will sting, Colby Lewis
and C.J. Wilson are in line for a bit of a regression and
there is always the looming risk of Hamilton hurting himself. Still, that may be enough. The A's have promising
young starters and Brian Fuentes and Andrew Bailey
make up perhaps the most formidable one-two finisher in
baseball. They have no offense though, so there's that. But
having read "Moneyball: the art of winning an unfair
game" by Michael M. Lewis, I have faith in Billy Beane to
work some magic. The Angels were ten games behind the
Rangers last year and they really didn't do anything in the
off-season to make me believe that they're ten games better. Vernon Wells is a good addition and maybe Dan Haren
or Scott Kazmir reclaim their old stuff. But I don't see it
happening. Since I only have so many words, I won't waste
them on the Mariners.
Prediction: I like the A's but the Rangers' offense is too
good.
AL Central: Chicago White Sox
The Twins won the division by six last year and everyone always seems to forget that they're good. I did until I
started writing this. Their starting pitching is somewhat
forgettable with Francisco Liriano being the only one to
jump out and their closer Joe Nathan is returning from
Tommy John surgery. The offense is good with Joe Mauer
at the lead, and Jim Thome, like the Twins themselves,
gets no respect. But Justin Morneau is a big question mark
and they may need him with the White Sox and Tigers nipping at their heels. I'm a huge fan of the White Sox signing
Adam Dunn, especially since he no longer has to put on
that charade he called being a fielder. His average on-base
percentage differential dropped last year, which is disappointing since it means he is less underrated. But you
can't have it all, I suppose. The rest of the offense is good
and the rotation is passable, with John Danks often being
overlooked. The Tigers aren't bad with Justin Verlander at
the helm of the rotation and Victor Martinez returning
behind the plate. Miguel Cabrera can rake and could win
the AL MVP despite his off-season problems (legal issues
aren't funny, but taking a shot of scotch while being
detained for a DUI definitely is). As one Tigers' fan put it,
"If everything goes right, we could win the division." And
that is more than the Royals and Indians can say.
Prediction: The Twins get no respect and the White Sox
win it by a couple.

AL East: Boston Red Sox
The AL East is stacked with the Orioles and Blue Jays
being the worst, but still not that bad. In fact, they would
make a run at the wild card if they played in the NL. But
let's move on to teams that have a shot. Manny Ramirez
and Johnny Damon are decent acquisitions and Ben
Zobrist is my pick for biggest bounce back player. That
being said, David Price is the only starter that really catches my eye and their bullpen has more holes than Barry
Bonds' perjury defense. Plus no one in Florida goes to
their games despite the fact that their team is fun to watch,
and that makes me not want to pick them. The Red Sox
played well last year even though they were decimated by
THE PHOENIX

injuries. Adrian Beltre and Victor Martinez are gone, but
Carl Crawford andAdrian Gonzalez outweigh their loss by
a lot. In fact, the Red Sox could have a historically good
offensive season if they all stay healthy. This is a shame
because if they do, that is all that will be talked about on
"Sportscenter." Their starting pitching seems iffy, but
their bullpen is top-notch and you can still win it all with
ok pitching and an insane offense (try the 2008 PhiUies).
Then there are the Yankees. They missed on every real
free agent, including Cliff Lee to the Phillies, which couldn't make me happier. C.C. Sabathia is a stud but the success of their rotation will depend on how well their recently signed veterans do. Of course by that I mean their rotation's success will depend on what ace they buy offanother team before the July 31st trade deadline. The Yanks'
offense is dirty, as always, but they will need Derek Jeter
to rebound after a dreadful 2010. My guess is that he will,
but not back to 2009 levels. If he doesn't, the Yankees will
have signed someone who can't hit (.370 SLG) and can't
field to a minimum three-year deal. I already can hear a
chorus of New Yorkers screaming incoherently at me for
that last comment so I will just say this: Jeter is a hall of
fame hitter, an extremely intelligent player, a great leader
and an objectively poor fielder. Deal with it.
Prediction: There is no way I can pick against Boston's
offense (looking good already at 0-4), but the Yankees will
win the wild card over the Twins by a game.
NL West: San Francisco Giants
The Giants won it all last year and being the angry, bitter Phillies fan that I am, their success particularly infuriated me. The sound of the DU leprechaun shouting "Cody
Ross: Best. Hitter. Ever." now permanently is scarred into
my brain. For the record, Cody
Ross is a sub-par hitter and a bad
human being for impersonating a
good baseball player (joking). I
gave the Giants much less credit
than they deserved and now that
I've had about five months to

Not much has changed for the
Giants, but if they were good

Wainwright's ulnar collateral ligament exploded. Without
their best pitcher, prospects suddenly seem less good for
the Cardinals; Everyone's favorite vegetarian Prince
Fielder and Ryan Braun provide the Brewers with a potent
combination in the middle of their offense. The signing of
former Cy Young winner Zack Greinke will bolster the
starting rotation, but will it be enough to turn the Brewers
from below .500 to division winners? Probably not. Once
again, the Cubs are at the upper end in terms of total
salary and once again will be at the bottom end in terms of
success. That used to be funny, but now it's just sad. The
Astros are comprised offormerPhillies rejects who played
well together last year after a terrible start. I think they
will finish in the middle of the pack. And the Pirates are
the Pirates. At least you have the Steelers, Pittsburgh.
Prediction: Dusty Baker boldly leads the Reds to another division title.
NL East: Atlanta Braves
Finally, we arrive at the NL East. The Phillies won the
most games in the MLB last year and in the off-season and
transformed theirrotation from filthy to legendary. If Roy
Halladay, CliffLee, Roy Oswalt and Cole Hamels each have
the same statistical season as they did last year (and
there's no reason they can't), the Phillies starting four will
have one of the top ten seasons in the history of baseball in
terms ofWins Above Replacement Player (WARP). On the
other hand, the Phillies offense became old, hurt and gone
in a hurry. Ryan Howard's peripheral numbers are steadily declining; Jimmy Rollins and Raul Ibanez are aging and
dealing with chronic injuries; Chase Utley is out for the

foreseeable future and Jason
Werth fled to the Nationals (of
course having written this, they
immediately contradict me by
starting off hot). But perhaps the
greatest rotation ever should be
enough to carry them to the playoffs.
The Braves are one of the least
talked about contenders in all of
baseball. Tommy Hanson, Tim
Hudson, Jair Jurrjens and Derek
Lowe provide the Braves with a

Softball team looks to get back on winning track
BY RENEE FLORES

rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Softball team continued Centennial
Conference play this weekend, hosting Gettysburg for the
inaugural StrikeOut Cancer game. The Garnet fell in the
doubleheader 15-5 and 8-2.
The StrikeOut Cancer game came about in collaboration with the American Cancer Society and the National
Fastpitch Coaches Association to raise money and awareness for cancer research. The players sought pledges per
offensive hit and defensive strikeout in the games on
Saturday. The team was happy for the opportunity to raise
awareness for an illness that affects so many people, joining colleges and universities across the United States in
raising money to strikeout cancer.
In Game One, the Garnet women managed to shut out
the Bullets in the first two innings, blocking all runs.
Outfielder Kate Smayda 13 made the first move for the
Garnet, with a lead-off single followed by a stolen base
which put her in the position to score. Outfielder Kira
Kern 'll made the hit that scored Smayda on a Gettysburg
error.
However, Gettysburg made a strong comeback with two
runs from three hits in the bottom of the second inning.
Infielder Rose Pitkin 'l3 and first-baser Danielle Seltzer 'l3
teamed up to put two runners on base with no outs, and
infielder Zoe Hendrickson 11 scored Pitkin with an RBI
single. Smayda recorded her second hit of the game, scoring Seltzer and restoring the Garnet to lead the Bullets 3-2.
"We definitely could have been better at the plate, but
we did play solid defense," outfielder Nicole Aaron 14 said.
But the Bullets' defense was even more dominating, as
Gettysburg pitcher Lanie Parr would record eight strikeouts of Garnet batters.
It was a back-and-forth game, as the Bullets managed
eight runs from six hits in the third inning. And, despite
starting the sixth inning strong with a homerun from
infielder Krista Scheirer 'll, the Garnet posted only two
more runs in the remainder of the game, while Gettysburg
managed five more, taking the win 15-5.

Going two-for-two at the plate, Smayda led the Garnet
women, recording an RBI and a run scored, while infielder Erin Curtis 'l3 went two-for-three and recorded an RBI.
"Although the outcome wasn't what I had hoped for, the
number of hits we got was great for raising money for the
StrikeOut Cancer event. We came together as a team to
support the cause, our friends, family and each other
through sharing how cancer has had an effect on our
lives," pitcher Melissa O'Connor 'l4 said.
Game Two saw a defensive spike as O'Connor 'l4 kept
the Bullets from scoring until the third inning, when
Gettysburg took the lead 2-0 with a two-RBI single.
. Aaron recorded a two-out double and run scoring on
the next batter on a Gettysburg error in the fourth inning
to bring the Garnet back into the game. Despite a turnaround in Garnet play, the final run in the bottom of the
seventh was not enough compared to the two Bullets
homeruns in the six and seventh innings, dropping the
game 8-2.

O'Connor pitched Game Two, keeping Swarthmore
close to the Bullets, until late in the game when the Bullets

April 7, 2011

blasted the game wide open. O'Connor now holds a 3-5
record for the season in pitching. Aaron went three-forthree at bat, recording two doubles and a run scored.
"We're still coming together as a team, but we have a lot
of talent and I think good things are going to start happening. I'm looking forward to everything coming together
and having a strong end to the season," O'Connor said.
Due to inclement weather, the games against McDaniel
were rescheduled for today. "I'm expecting the team to
come out ready to fight hard against McDaniel so that we
can win. I'm ready for our team to gain momentum and
come out of the games on a positive note," O'Connor said.
In terms of the rest of the season, the team is hoping to
make a return to winning play. "I am expecting to prove to
our opponents this week that we are competitors.
Although our record doesn't look like much, we are going
to fight for the playoff spot that we deserve," Aaron said.
"We are better than our box scores seem to show."
The Swarthmore softball team is set to travel to
McDaniel today to play in a Centennial Conference
doubleheader.
