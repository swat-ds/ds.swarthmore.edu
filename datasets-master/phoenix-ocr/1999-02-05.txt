Wettberg
awarded
Rotary
fellowship
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer

After he graduates, Eric von
Wettberg '99 will spend a year
for
free
studying
in
Copenhagen. The biology major won a Rotary International
fellowship to do agricultural research at a Danish university.
Von Wettberg will be studying at the Royal Veterinary and
Agricultural University with
Jacob Weiner, a former Swarthmore ecology professor. One
part of their research will be
studying the effects ofcrop density on herbicide application.
Von Wettberg said the goal is to
find crop densities where there
is no room for weeds to grow,
but not so dense that the useful
plants compete with each other.
"Denmark is a great place to
study," said von Wettberg. "The
whole country is interested in
sustainable agriculture."
His fellowship covers room,
board, transportation and tuition
for the year, but receiving it required surviving a lengthy application process. First, von
Wettberg applied to his home
Rotary Club in Hamilton, N.Y.
Approved by that club, his application made its way through
successive levels of competition
before he won. He is one of several hundred students this year
nationally.
Von Wettberg said the fellowship applications are judged on
social impact, feasibility, and
their contribution to the
individual's career. American
students with Rotary scholarships travel around the world,
and many foreign winners travel
to the United States. College
graduates or soon-to-be graduates may apply.
Von Wettberg was overjoyed
on New Year's Eve when he
found out he had won. Denmark
has a high cost of living, and so
studying overseas was an otherwise impossible educational
opportunity for him. "It's beyond my personal means," he
said, "to live in Copenhagen for
a year without employment."

Despite the escalating turmoil
of the ongoing impeachment
trail, last week Resident Clinton
resubmitted to the Senate his
nomination of JamesC. Hormel
'55 as ambassador to Luxembourg. If Hormel is confirmed
by a majority vote in the Senate, he would be the first openly
gay American envoy.
President Clinton first nominated the 66-year-old Hormel,
a San Francisco philanthropist,
as ambassador to Luxembourg
in October 1997. Although
Hormel's nomination was approved with a large majority by
the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which is led by
Senator Jesse A. Helms, a conservative North Carolina Republican, the vote was never
brought to the Senate floor to
receive the necessary confirmation. After his approval by the
Committee Hormel received
strong bipartisan support in the
Senate and probably would have
been confirmed in a full Senate
vote had his nomination reached
the floor. .
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Mo, justified the fact
that Hormel's nomination never
reached by Senate floor by stating that there was insufficient
time on the legislative calendar
to confirm the nomination.

Lott's statement is contrary to
fact, however, as the Senate recently, confirmed scores of foreign service nominations.
Winnie Stachelberg, political
director of the Human Rights
Campaign, the largest gay advocacy group in the United States,
stated, "It is not so much a matter of timing, but a clear indication of Trent Lott's anti-gay
bias."
Lott, whose homophobia is
well-documented, is widely acknowledged as the Republican
who singlehandedly prevented
the confirmation vote from
reaching the Senate floor. In
1998 Lott described homosexuality as a "sin" akin to
alchoholism, kleptomania, and
sex addiction, and expressed
concern that Hormel would use
the envoy position to promote
his "homosexual agenda." The
Luxembourg government outlaws discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and
stated that it would welcome
Hormel's confimation.
Organizations ofthe Christian
right, such as The Traditional
Values Coalition, sided with
Lott in their objection to
Hormel's nomination. The Traditional Values Coalition cited
material kept in the James
Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center, a collection of gay and lesbian literature owned by the San
Francisco Public Library, as
sexually explicit and claimed
that it promoted "incest and pedophilia."
A well-known philanthropist,
Hormel donated $500,000 to
establish the center, which contains materials pertaining to gay

and lesbian issues, much of
which is also kept in the Library
of Congress. Hormel has stated
that he has little knowledge of
the specific materials purchased
with his donation, and has "no
input or control" on the content
of the materials housed in his
collection.
While
some
criticise
Hormel's so-called "gay
agenda," his superb qualifications have never been questioned. Hormel served in the US
Coast Guard Reserve from
1951-1957 and graduated from
Swarthmore College in 1955
with a B.A. in History and then
proceeded to receive his J.D.
from the University of Chicago
Law School in 1958. Hormel
maintained his association with
the University of Chicago and
subsequently served as Assistant
Dean, Dean of Students and as
the Chairman of the Law School
Visiting Committee.
Hormel completed his term as
Alternate Representative of the
US Delegation to the 51st Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1997 after
serving as a member of the US
Delegation to the 51st UN Human Rights Commission in
1995. In both 1995 and 1997,
Hormel served on the Western
States Regional Selection Panel
for the President's Commission
on White House Fellowships. In
1995 Hormel participated in the
President's Conference on the
Pacific Rim and in 1996 was a
member of Mayor Willie
Brown's Economic Summit in
San Francisco.

Tennis center delayed till next year
by Arun Mohan
Contributing Writer

Students expecting a new tennis and fitness center on campus this spring will have to wait
a littlebit longer. The new, $2.5
million tennis center, advertised
in a June press release to be built
by early spring '99 will not be
ready until the beginning of the
next school year, says Larry
Schall, Vice President for Facilities and Services.
According to Schall, the facility was never slotted to be ready
by now.
We thought it might have
moved up to April or May, but
it's taking a little longer than
expected."
While no plans have been solidified, Schall expects that
ground for the center will be
broken sometime in the spring
and that construction could take
as long as 7 months.
Why the delay? Schall said
that the college is currently in
negotiations with contractors,
ensuring that "the building is designed well and that the price is
appropriate."
The center, to be named after
men's tennis coach Mike Mullan,
is a gift from alumnus Jerome
Kohlberg. The facility, to be built

in the area behind Warepool, will
house three indoor tennis courts
as well as well as a 4,000-squarefoot fitness area, including cardiovascular and resistance
weight machine.
Students had mixed reaction
to the news that the facility
would not be completed until
next semester. While most were
ambivalent, some expressed
frustration.
Kevin O'Neil 'Ol, who
doesn't play an organized sport,
said, "The athletic facilities right
now are thoroughly inadequate.
It pisses me off that there are
three bikes that aren't working
and the weight room is overcrowded. I think they should
make it a priority."
Currently the demand for use
of the fieldhouse for athletic
practices exceeds space available, making it difficult for
teams, both club and varsity, to
maintain a consistent practice
time or have practice at all on
any given day.
This sentiment was echoed by
John Thomas 'O2, a member of
the men's tennis team. "It's a
little disappointing but it's really
not a big deal. It's disappointing because it's an inconvenience. We can't practice at the
same time, sometimes I have

CBORD stolen from Sharples

Weekend
Saturday

Editor in Chief

A CBORD card reader valued
at $3,500 was stolen from the
rear entrance of Sharpies dining
hall last Saturday in the early
morning.
Alarms sounded at approximately 12:10 a.m., summoning
public safety officers. The officers discovered that the rear door
and the door at the loading dock
had been opened, said Director
of Dining Services Linda
McDougall.
McDougall sent two all-campus emails requesting the return
of the CBORD unit. If the scanner is not returned today at 5
p.m., she says that there is a possibility ofending the popular bag
lunch program. The stolen scanner was used by the program, and
its loss has forced Sharpies workers to write down ID numbers by
hand at the back door.

The CBORD scanner stolen from Sharpies was identical to one
pictured above, photo by Nick Attanasio

Said McDougall, "At lunchtime it's a major inconvenience,
and it's not just an inconvenience for us but for students,
too."
McDougall said that the decision to end the bag lunch program would not be hers alone,
but would be made in conjunction with Facilities Vice-Presi-

dent Larry Schall.
McDougall expressed surprise at the theft and pointed out
that since the power cords for
the terminal were not removed,
the CBORD unit would be "useless." She also related that the
CBORD scanners have been
stolen before but have always
been returned.

Support necessary for
SC to change policies
A strange thing happens to
every Swattie after they graduate—you suddenly start getting
more mail from the College than
you ever have. And the correspondence inevitably revolves
around the same topic: giving.
In his at times elegantly formulated and on the other hand,
sometimes simply downright incomprehensible soliloquies that
grace the fine Strathmore parchment of the Alumni Development Office, Al Bloom explains
the importance of alumni giving
to the continual growth of the
College. Evoking the examples
of Jerry Kohlberg and Gene
Lang, he impresses upon you
the urgency and profound meaning of your individual contribution.
The feeling is of a beggar who
was knighted by the Queen.
Yet it is curious to observe that
on average, every current student contributes more to the
College financially than most
alumni, perhaps with the exception of the lone Kohlberg or
Lang. Al, with his impressive
mastery of Swarthmore vital statistics, would retort that College
spending per student exceeds
tuition and room and board.
In other words, Al would argue, the College subsidizes us
not vice versa—to receive a
first-class education, not to mention the generous amount of financial aid the College doles out
every year.
But never mind where our
money goes. The bottom line is,
the money we contribute is what
keeps the College running. We
are an important part of what
makes the Swarthmore experience what it is. And therefore,
we should have a say in deciding how we live at Swarthmore.
A college community is not
exactly a democracy. In deciding to join the Swarthmore community and agreeing to shoulder the cost of membership, we
are in essence entering into a
commercial contract with the
College. But the contract is not
totally binding—if we are
disastisfied with the services
rendered us by the College, we
have the freedom, at any time,
to opt out of the contract.
However, even within the context of this highly functionalist
interpretation of our relationship
with the College, we are not left
totally powerless. Just like corporations must be held account—

able to their shareholders, the
College must be held accountable to us, to a large extent, for
their decisions and actions, especially those that pertain directly to our immediate wellbeing.
And it is crucially important
for us to wield that "consumer
power," if you will, if not for
ourselves, for future generations
ofSwarthmore students. To cultivate the consciousness that
change can happen, and to institutionalize the way change
comes about should be the top
priorities of any stable and viable community.
And the chief agent through
which student-initiated change
happens at Swarthmore is Student Council.
Student Council comprises
our elected representatives,
people we deemed fit to protect
and advance our interests. But
the ability of Student Council
members to function effectively
relies on our cooperation. We
should make our grievances
known to them. And when they
are fighting for our collective
interests, we should assist their
efforts.
Student Council members, for
their part, should take their responsibility as an advocate for
student interests seriously. That
said, we realize the tremendous
dedication working as a student
representative entails, and
would like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation for the important service
they are performing for our
community.
We are also immensely uplifted by the outlook for the Student Council this semester. With
the injection offresh blood and
a new leadership, Student Council seems to be oh its way to reestablishing its relevance in students' lives. New initiatives such
as the Weekend Van Service
have very concretely improved
student life and will no doubt
work towards rekindling student
confidence in Student Council's
ability to affect positive change
in the community.
On that note, we hope that every student will take their first,
step by voting at the upcoming
Student Council elections, and
also by attending the collection
today, hosted by Student Council, at 1 p.m. in LPAC where they
will preview their plans for this
semester and solicit feedback.

Tariq's story: an appeal to end
sanctions and military force against Iraq
by Dann Naseemullah
Contributing Writer
imagine a boy called ianq, an

.

Iraqi university student. He is as
old as the freshmen who are
fumbling around the halls of
universities all across the United
States today. His life story is a
little different. While his counterparts in the US were born into
relative calm and stability, Tariq,
depending on his birth-date,
could only have enjoyed a few
months of peace before the start
of the Iran-Iraq War in the September of 1980.
Throughout the first eight
years of his life, Tariq was surrounded, by the pain, loss and
sacrifice that occurred because
of the war. More than likely, one
ofhis uncles or perhaps even his
father became part of the million that died through this conflict.
During this time, however,
Tariq also became hardened. He
grew up during a war-time situation in which everyone is in
need. He played with toy guns,
and looked forward to the day
in which he could serve his
against fundamentalist
ran, as many Americans wanted
3 fight against the Red threat
i the decades before.
In 1990, when Tariq was just
elebrating his tenth year, Iraq,
nder the direction of President
addam, Hussein, invaded the
eighbouring kingdom of Ku'ait. Tariq saw. nothing wrong
dth this action: he had been
lught that Kuwait was a false
ation that was created by the
British after World War I to protect a supportive emir. It was
violating their oil field, undercutting them in oil prices and
refusing to negotiate. He had
always thought that Kuwait
should have been a part of the
state of Iraq. He also supported
Saddam Hussein.
While American kids by this
time had seen two Presidents
and a Congress that shifted every couple of years, Tariq had
only known Saddam Hussein,
the democratic hero of the war
with Iran. Tariq watched in horror in the following months as
first the Security Council passed
a resolution calling for sanctions
and then the most horrific war
that Tariq had known.
In January of 1991, Tariq was
exposed to a shade of hell that
no child should ever see. Operation Desert Storm for him was
not just flashing screens and hitech graphics indicating "Day
13" of the war on CNN, it was
the slow death of his country.
The sirens that blared throughout the streets of Baghdad were
not the more familiar sounds of
police cars or ambulances driving through the streets of Philadelphia or Boston.
Instead, they signified bombing raids: cruise missiles, Tomahawks, 'smart' bombs. Perhaps
more of his family were killed.
Perhaps his house or houses
near it were damaged when a

lOuntry

missile went astray. Tariq saw
sleepless nights, mechanized
thunder, and complete horror by
the light of a candle. Thousands
of Iraqis died, both civilians and
soldiers. Still others would fall
ill as a direct result of the war
through the effects of the depleted uranium used in US tank
shells.
The real horror, the horror that
would continue to kill and strip
this once proud nation of any
dignity, was yet to come. Sanctions on Iraq were as crippling
as the war itself, if not more so.
Many of the Allied military targets were infrastructural: they
included sewage and water
treatment plants, power stations,
pharmaceutical plants, railroads, and yes, even schools and
hospitals. Under sanctions, Iraq
could not get back on its feet.
Tariq would no doubt have
had to deal with the stench of
sewage on the streets as he
hiked to school, as well as carry
polluted water in his thermos to
drink with his lunch. It would
not have been much of a lunch
either. Slowly, his parents saw
him getting thinner and thinner
on a diet almost completely devoid of proteins. More than
once, Tariq would have contracted those infectious diseases that are easily preventable
in a functioning economy with
even minimal public health. His
malnutrition would not have
helped either. Tariq, starting to
understand the world around
him, realizes that this hardship
is there because Iraq cannot sell
its oil in exchange for money
for food, medicine or economic
recovery.
Something else angers Tariq,
however. UNSCOM is an acronym he would grow to hate as
he progresses through adolescence. He knows Iraq to have
been a proud nation once, a
symbolism ofArab solidarity in
the Middle East. The area between the Tigris and Euphrates
once was the heart of the
civilization.
Babylonian
Baghdad was the center of the
Islamic world at the time of the
Abbasid dynasty. The modern
nation grew out of the Arab nationalism in the 19605, supported by the west.
In UNSCOM he sees as an
organization that completely
undermines that pride and that
dignity. He does not concentrate
on the possibility of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons
hidden somewhere in Iraq. He
sees UNSCOM as looking for
something that is not there, a
pathetic excuse for the imperialistic West to keep Iraq on its
knees. He becomes more and
more
angry each time
UNSCOM extends their mandate more and more, and demands to inspect more and
more.
Tariq likes Saddam Hussein.
Maybe this is an understatement: more than likely, he is
willing to die for him. He sees
his leader as the only one who

stands up for the dignity that
Iraq once had and challenges the
complete control of the West
over his country. When he looks
up at the 40-foot portraits of
Saddam in Baghdad, he sees a
saviour, not a madman. More
than that, Tariq sees, however
misguidedly, the man who is
keeping him alive. He is completely and wholly dependent on
the government. They are giving him food, education, and
health care. Tariq does not know
another protector.
Tariq, now about eighteen,
might have looked at the December bombings and appreciated a bitter, bitter irony in front
of him. His country, trying to get
back on its feet, was thrown
down again brutally and harshly.
His country was punished severely for not cooperating, and
then immediately expected to
cooperate.
President Clinton launched
death blows because of the annoyed words of an Australian
UN official who could not work
with the Iraqis, much as a huffy
prima donna storms into her
trailer after an argument with the
director. The same president that
ordered the attacks without authorization from the Security
Council would be impeached a
couple of days later for offenses
that would be stone-able in
Saudi Arabia. Whether or not
Tariq appreciates the irony, he
is angry. Angrier, perhaps, than
anyone should be this young. He
is due for military service as an
obligation to the state, but he
requires no persuasion. He, in
his proud Arab way, would
rather die for his country than
see it a slave of another. As he
dons his Kaffiya over angry eyes
and looks up to Saddam
Hussein's portrait, he sees no
peace. He knows no peace, just
as so many of us are fortunate
enough never to have known
war.
This narrative is not objective,
nor was it meant to be. Its purpose is to convey, however
poorly, thefeelings ofthe people
of Iraq and their supporters all
over the Muslim world. Tariq
dees not exist, but there are
thousands of boys growing up
in Iraq with similar life stories
and frustrations. They have
grown up with war, and know
only violence and hatred.
It is our job as citizens of a
more peaceful world to show
them peace. The current US and
larger Allied policy does not do
this, however. Instead it continues a cycle of hatred that will
never lead to a lasting resolution
ofthe conflict. The way forward
is to concentrate on the people
ofIraq, who are flesh and blood
as we are, and as capable of
love, jealousy, and pride.
To focus on Saddam Hussein,
demonized as he is, is a mistake.
To see if he can be removed
through the suffering of his
people is a mistake too. The situation will not resolve itself
through the continued pain and

suffering that sanctions cause.
Believe it or not, Saddam
Hussein as a dictator in control
of Iraq is the best-case scenario,
at least in the short term. There
are others waiting in the wings
who are more fanatic than he is
and a great deal more dangerous. His advisors, many of them
Western-educated and largely
rational, are trying to work for
the welfare of the people.
With continued sanctions, the
generation that Tariq is in will
come to power without any
kind ofrestraint. The weapons
inspection issue is still a real
sticking point. UNSCOM has
received a tacit open-ended
mandate from the Security
Council to find weapons of
mass destruction if they exist,
and if not, to keep on looking
as if they do. Goalposts are
shifted back constantly, and the
result is a violation of national
sovereignty. Saddam Hussehl is
not the Wicked Witch of the
East who has cast a magic spell
to make his CBN weapons invisible.
If, after eight years, the foremost weapons experts in the
world could not find these weapons, chances are they do not exist. The US bombed Iraq recently more on a question of attitude than of threat, and this
attitude is merely the upholding
of national sovereignty.
Sanctions should be completely lifted and UNSCOM
should have a permanent role in
monitoring weapons build-ups.
The process towards peace must
also be multilateral, allowing
nations that share common ties
with Iraq to discuss solutions to'
these problems. Can it be guaranteed that Iraq would not use
the revenues from the oil exports
to rebuild its military? No, it
cannot. While Iraq has no current feuds with its Arab neighbors and cannot harm any others for lack of a long-range missile system, the possibility still
exists.
Can it be safely said that this
is the best in a series of bad
policy options? Yes, it can.
People might say that this plan
lacks medium- or long-term
strategy or objectives. But neither, I think, has the policy currently in use by the State Department or the British Foreign Office. Through cooperation and
through the diplomacy that
makes friends and not enemies,
comprehensive and long-term
solutions can be reached. It does
require patience and a willingness to give up the need for complete control of this situation,
which has always been an illusion. It requires respect.
End the sanctions, end the
bombings and the threats, and
stop the loss of life. Sanctions
are not helping anyone, and they
have killed thousands every
month since January of 1991.

BC has responsibility
to please student body
To the editor:

I have now been on Budget Committee for a year and a half and
have recently experienced an epiphany. As a freshman, I saw Budget Committee as a conduit to change the school for the better. I
was part of the good fight that would hold Budget Committee accountable to the student body for every dollar spent. For over a
year I thought I was the voice of reason as I vowed to protect the
pockets of every Swarthmore student.
In doing so I was vilified by many students on this campus for
partaking in what I thought was moral accomplishment. Unlike
most think, I had no intention of being unduly harsh. Mv -h to the
contrary, I desired to help empower students in voicing "their"
concerns and questions that I thought protected their interests. In
no way did I seek to deter certain organizations from carrying out
their planned events or activities.
In the end, however, I came to the realization that, besides me
and a few other BC members, no one else really cares. Most students, I believe, feel as though BC is a inefficient bureaucracy that
attemps to wield its power over vunerable student organizations.
This perception is unfortunate, but if that is the perception, it is
BC's job to change it.
Students seem to enjoy the plethora of organizations that Swarthmore has and would appreciate more funds to enhance the activity on groups on campus. If this is the opinion of the majority of
students a utility calculation is in order. In short, BC should simply be more generous and quit haggling over small amounts.
Does the pleasure of Budget Committee outweight that of the
rest of the student body? Obviously the answer is an unequivocal
no.

Teach your children well
Impeachment
fiasco teaches
crucial lessons
As the Clinton impeachment
fiasco finally winds down (I
hope), we should all begin to
shudder, because in twenty
years your children, assuming
your immortality,
will ask you
about this fascinating time in
American history, and you will
say, with the authority of parenthood, that you
were not paying
attention. So,
while you may not actually remember what happened, it is
certain that important precedents have been set by this impeachment trial that will become
part of the future of the American polity. So, in the interests
of history, we shall herein review:
1) The President cannot be
removed from office for things
other senators have already
done. This is the primary
Democratic defense. Since ev-

eryone (except me, sadly) has
had an affair (and lied about it
in a sworn deposition), Clinton
cannot be removed from office
for it. Nevermind the intimidation of witnesses, the obstruction of justice, and the general
lack ofregard for the American
people. After all, a rule is a rule.
This also applies to campaign
finance violations, where, since
Clinton does
not like the
rules, he does
not have to
Charles
follow them.
Fischette
2) Denying
a citizen's day
LaissezFaire
in court is also
not impeachable. Despite
J
Paula Jones's
numerous noses, she is technically still a citizen (and it's a
good thing too, because otherwise most ofHollywood would
be resident aliens and could not
contribute to political parties.
Or rather, they could. Just ask
Janet Reno), and, though it
seems like a long time ago, the
cause of all this silliness was
Slick Willy trying to lie his way
out of a civil suit. In all honesty,
it is kind of funny, because, in
retrospect, it seems clear that the

"American people," as constructed by flawless polls of the
eight people who are willing to
talk during dinner time to a 20year-old pollster trying to pay
for the Kwai stereo that his parents would not buy him now that
he's officially out of college, are
untroubled by the President's
philandering and sexual harassment-filled past. And no news
network in the United States is
willing to show a report of like
substance anyway. We would
probably just call her trailer
trash too. This from compassionate and liberal-minded
people.
3) Partisanship is bad. Very
bad. Like Stalin bad. The very
notion that one could have principles that he values above getting along is unconscionable.
Those American revolutionaries
should have just found a compromise and not gotten so bent
out of shape about representation and martial law. Those
Christians (translation, partisans
of Christ) who died for their
faith and all were just being
silly. Also, bipartisanship is
now defined as doing what
Democrats want. If you refuse
to vote with Democrats, you are
being partisan, which, as we

_

said, is bad. If you abandon any
idea ofright and wrong and just
do what they say, you're being
bipartisan, which is good.
4) Defending thePresident, by
any and all means, is a virtuous,
noble, and profoundly American
thing to which we should all aspire, even those of us who publish smut magazines. Prosecuting the President, by the authority of federal law, having convictions and subpoenas upheld
and doing one's job are bad. To
defend the President and otherwise distract people, it is OK to:
a) kill Iraqis
b) defame anybody and everybody, especially if they are poor
or women,
c) apply pressure to major networks (this excludes Fox) not to
run news stories regarding allegations of rape by the President
d) give away other people's
money to save your own bum.
Remember, you are aresource
in your child's education. We
owe it to the next generation to
begin to come to terms with this
wonderful period of American
history. And if that doesn't do
it for you, this will be on his/her

Oil in Nigeria leads to destruction Recent public apologies
border on ludicrous
by Mark Charette
Staff Writer

What could be better for a monetarily
poor nation than the discovery of a gold
mine of oil reserves in one of its least
"developed" regions?
The apparent auspices of such a discovery are innumerable: instant access
to foreign capital; a better balance of
trade with wealthy nations; extra tax
dollars to finance improvements in
health, education and infrastructure.
Any developing nation lucky enough
to strike oil would surely experience a
euphoric era of growth, prosperity and
health.
In 1958, Britain opened one of its
West African colonies to oil companies
for exploration. Among them was
Dutch Royal Shell, which quickly
struck liquid gold in the Niger Delta
region of contemporary southern Nigeria. In the four ensuing decades, Shell
was joined by firms like Chevron in
building a small empire in partnership
with the Nigerian government. By
1997, Nigeria's oil industry was
America's fifth largest supplier of oil,
recording profits of $ 12 billion per year.
Producing 2 billion barrels of oil daily,
the industry overshadowed all other
forms of trade, raking in 95 percent of
the nation's foreign currency earnings.
Upon reading of these tremendous
profits, one might make the following
word association. Shell: equitable corporate partner in the human and economic development of a former British colony.
And you might remain transfixed on
the benevolence of transnational oil
companies and the "great post-colonial
success story" of Nigeria until you took
a look at the most recent United Nations Human Development Report,
which ranks Nigeria 141st in the world,
behind Iraq, Myanmar (formerly
Burma) and Comoros. Certainly, the
report has its flaws. "Universal" standards of "development"
measured
by survival, education, political participation, ecological sustainability, perare apsonal security and income
plied across the globe to contexts in
which these measures may not be entirely suitable. But with more than $l2
billion coming in annually from the oil
industry, one would at least expect Nigeria to provide well over half its citizens with access to health care and safe
drinking water—which the report reveals it does not.
With all that oil money, why has not
Nigeria—Africa's most populous nation with more than 100 million citizens —catapulted itself into the position of a global economic superpower
and been invited to join the Group of
Nine?
Internal corruption? Cronyism between bankers and government officials? An inability to handle large sums
of foreign capital?
Part of the answer lies closer to the
earth, in the polluted streams and riverbeds of the Niger Delta, where Shell
and other oil companies set up operations in 1958. The British government's
decision to open the region to international investment set in motion an ecological nightmare that has yet to end.
Oil spills, gas flares and dumping have
contaminated the region's ecosystem,
decimating productive fishing and
farming industries.
Following a blow-out at an oilfield
on the Delta in 1970, a young peoples'
group called the Dere Youths Association released a statement to Nigerian

"I'm terribly sorry for having an affair and misleading the American
but it sure was fun while it
asted!"
No, President Clinton did not say
that, but developments in the current
fad of "public apologies" probably do
not entirely rule out a statement like it.
How do you apologize and offend at
the same time? Public officials are getting very good at it, as Jerry Falwell
and two former Cambodian Khmer
Rouge leaders have indicated recently.
Just Tuesday the Rev. Jerry Falwell,
an evangelist leader and prominent figure of America's "religious right,"
apologized (sort of) for declaring in
January that the Antichrist was alive
and was a Jewish man.
"If he's going to be the counterfeit
of Christ, he has to be Jewish," Falwell
said last month. "The only thing we
know is he must be male and Jewish."
Then, in his apology on Tuesday,
Falwell merely said that he lacked
"tact" and "judgment" in making the
statement, but not that there was anything wrong with the sentiment itself.
"I apologize not for what I believe,"
Falwell said during his "apology."
Quite frankly, the Falwell apology
pales in comparison to the remorse expressed by Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea, two upper-level leaders during
Pol Pot's reign of terror in Cambodia
between 1975 and 1979. The two
former leaders, now elderly and frail,
participated in the genocidal killings of
over a million Cambodians.
In December, Khieu Samphan said
that he was "sorry, very sorry"
or the suffering of the Cambodian

[>eople,

Siuietly

people, but then added, more than once,
that everyone should "let bygones be
bygones."
Khieu Samphan was clearly mastering the art of understatement when he
said, "It is normal that those who have
lost their families, that they—what to
say —feel some resentment," but that
it is healthiest to "forget the past."
But by far it was his comrade Nuon
Chea who became the champion of simultaneous apology and insult when
he declared, "Actually, we are very
sorry not only for the lives of the people
of Cambodia, but even for the lives of
all animals that suffered because ofthe
war."
Over a million people! The Antichrist
is Jewish!
So what were these leaders, including Falwell, trying to say? That they
were not sorry for what they had done
but were merely taking advantage of
the opportunity to publicly reaffirm
their intolerant beliefs? Regardless,
their disastrous "apologies" clearly
demonstrated that this era of public remorse should come to an end as soon
as possible. Those who are truly sorry
for what they have done have alternatives to news conference apologies that
are more genuine and more respected.
President Clinton knows this, which
is why he has not repeated the mistake
he made in August, by "deeply regretting" his mistakes but asserting that Ken
Starr was out of control and that "even
Presidents have private lives." Instead,
his determination to keep his job and
focus on policy issues is indicative of
his true attitude—and attitude for which
he refuses to falsely apologize.
Public apologies do not work because true regret —and genuine apologies—are always private.

Parents rate Swat among best colleges
Confidential
survey reveals
parents' worries
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman

Staff Writer
Parents of students at Swarthmore and similar schools rated
academics highly but were simultaneously concerned about
academic pressure and the cost
of college, according to an educational consortium's first-ever
parents' survey.
Over 20,000 parents responded to the survey, conducted in 1997 by the Consortium of Financing Higher Education, a national organization
that includes Swarthmore and

21 other prestigious colleges
and universities. The data, compiled last year, is confidential
and identifies each school by a
code known only to that school.
The confidentiality "makes
each of the institutions willing
to share data," said Paul
Aslanian, vice president for finance and planning. Aslanian let
The Phoenix examine the report,
which he said showed Swarthmore to be "wonderful" by comparison. However, he said that,
by agreement with the consortium, only the survey's conclusions, and not the numerical data
behind them, could be released.
The "Swarthmore Parents"
newsletter reported in December that in the survey 90 percent
of Swarthmore's parents "gave

top ratings to the college's emphasis on undergraduate education, students' academic qualifications, the quality of teaching,
access to faculty and the intellectual atmosphere outside the
classroom.
"Asked to list what has most
disappointed them about Swarthmore,"
continued
the
newsletter's report, "most comments clustered around issues of
financial aid, the cost of education and tuition increases. About
25 percent of parents also said
that the College needed improvement in helping students
deal with academic stress and

pressure."

The survey concluded that
praise and concern were similar at the other schools. At all

News in Brief

institutions, parents were concerned about repaying student
loans. Families who had them
said that was their most important concern. A significant number of parents said that paying
for college involved "extreme"
or "great" financial sacrifice.
The survey also examined
where parents get information
and how much they know about
college life. At most schools
parents said they knew most
about financing options, academic life and policies and financial aid. They knew least
about off-campus study, religious life, what graduates do
after college, why college costs
what it does, athletic opportunities and student organizations.

To increase student interest, I
propose that Council increase its
visibility. This includes holding
monthly dinners at highly visible locations (i.e. the center of
Sharpies) and hosting pizza/

social events. Council has done
well in attaining media visibility but it could do more in attaining physical visibility.
Another limit to participation
has been the historic lack of
women's involvement in Council. They last time we had a gender-balanced Council was during my term. Although participation is open to everone, most
people, particularly women,
aren't involved because bureaucracy is an inaccessible and ineffective forum for their goals.
Many women, including me,
were discouraged by Council
meetings where participants
were cutting in, talking out of
turn, and shouting us down; I refused to engage in similarly aggressive behavior to validate my
ideas.
During the course of my
term, we changed the structure
of Council meetings (finally
formalized and adopted in Constitutional "by laws") so that
everyone could provide continual input and still keep
Council efficient. In addition to holding annual
leadership retreats for
women, I propose that
Council further change
the structure of their decision-making process
so that more ideas are

To facilitate this entire
process I am proposing
that Council once again

Hormel fights for appointment
From HORMEL, pg. 1
Hormel served on the Board
of Human Rights Campaign's
Education arm, the Human
Rights Campaign Foundation.
He is currently a member of the
board of both the San Fransisco
Symphony and the San
Fransisco Chamber of Commerce. An attorney, Democratic
Party donor, and heir to the family meat-processing fortune,
Hormel is also currently Chairman of Equidex, Inc.
Hormel remains highly involved with Swarthmore both as
a decade-long member of the
Board of Managers and as a generous benefactor of the College.
The primary two initiatives into
which he has focused his contributions are the James P. Hormel
Professorship in Social Justice

and the James C. Hormel Endowment for Student Services Fund.
The James P. Hormel Professorship in Social Justice is
"awarded to a professor in any
academic division whose teaching and scholarship stimulate increased social concern for the
understanding of social justice
issues, including those pertaining to sexual orientation," while
the James C. Hormel Endowment for Student Services is established "to support staffing
and programs related to student
services and student activities,
including but not limited to student involvement in volunteering and programs to encourage
greater understanding of, sensitivity to, and incorporation into
the general society of the differences in culture, sexual orientation or race."

President Al Bloom
rallied to Hormel's side
in Janurary of 1998 by
writing to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
expressing his strong and
unequivocal support for
Hormel's appointment as
ambassador to Luxembourg. Bloom attested to
Hormel's "thoughtfulness, balance, and wisdom" in his guidance of
the College, and stated
his belief that Hormel
"brings to the current
nomination the same
sterling combination of
intelligence, integrity,
and humanity that so
warranted his confirmation for [his former positions as US delegate to
the United Nations]."

Berkeley students sue

California high school students sued UC Berkeley Tuesday for
discriminatory entrance policies. They claimed Berkeley and other

UC schools over-emphasize AP and SAT tests which over half
California's minority high school students did not have access to
last year. Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl maintains that the
university focuses on diversity despite California's recently passed
Proposition 209, which banned all affirmative action race preference in state university admissions. After 209 minority enrollment declined across the U.C. system, especially at the prestigious
Berkeley. The university has promised to lessen the effects of test
scores on admission and "reintensify our recruitment efforts."

Web site to pay damages

A federal jury in Portland ruled Monday that the anti-abortion
web site 'The Nuremberg Files' amounted to death threats.
"Nuremberg" lists names, addresses, and license plates for hundreds of abortion doctors, or "baby butchers," and offers $5,000
online for more information. The anti-abortion materials contain
no explicit threats of violence, only veiledmessages, such as crosses
through the names of dead physicians, three of whom were killed

January: Hollywood's crap Sawallisch and Woodham combine
by Ben Fritz
Staff Writer

For the Hollywood aficionado, January is truly a test of
your mettle. With the general
public too occupied or depressed by the weather to go out
to movies and the film industry
too busy trying to snare Oscar
nominations to worry about
what's in the theaters, the results
are unsurprisingly depressing.
I recently conducted a historical survey and concluded that in
fact no good movie has ever
been released in January. Ever.
This is the month when Hollywood dumps their worst crap
that they know nobody will see
but they do have to release
sometime. The result is wastes
of celluloid like "Leprechaun,"
"Fallen," and current crapper
"Virus." (The male lead is a
Baldwin brother who is not
named Alec. Need I say more?)
January is not devoid of glitz
and glamour, though, some
might point out. This is the beginning of awards show season,
after all. Why just last week
there was the glorious spectacle
ofthe Golden Globe Awards, the
one night of the year when the
Montague and the Capulets of
Hollywood, the film and TV industries, come together to share
in excessive opulence, bad jokes
by Jack Nicholson, and an orgy
of self-congratulation second
only to the Oscars and Emmys.
In reality, however, the
Golden Globes are good only
for the celebrity watcher or obsessive gambler looking forany
clue as to how the Oscars might
go. They are voted on by the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 80 or
90 foreign journalists with about
as much credibility to be voting
for major awards as Tarble Joe.
My favorite aspect of the
Golden Globes, however is their
rules about studio gift-giving,
which we in the real world (and
Swarthmore) call bribing. There
basically are no rules, meaning
voters get showered with free

merchandise to "encourage" American Dream!" exclaims

Outstanding
wrestler Keith
McManimen 'O2
holds 11-1 record
by Anne Frankenfield
Staff Writer
• Keith McManimen 'O2, a
Radnor High School graduate,
has made quite an impact in his
first season of college wrestling at Swarthmore. With an
overall record of 11-1 with 6
pins and a 5-0 Centennial Conference record, the 184-lb.
McManimen is currently
ranked second in the Conference and has proven himself to
be-one of the most successful
freshmen in the program's history.
"According to head coach
Ron Tirpak, McManimen's
character is ideal for a wrestler.
"Keith is extremely coachable.
He is open to any suggestions
and advice and has a great future ahead of him as he continues to learn," says Tirpak.
McManimen is one of a group
of five first-year-wrestlers who
together are possibly the best
overall group in ten years. But
of those five, McManimen, a
talented leg wrestler, has definitely made his name known

Head Coach Luci Rosalia, Swat
Track & Field shows some exciting promise for the remainderof the Winter Season as well
as the upcoming Spring Season.
When people ask about the outcome of the Wesleyan meet this
past weekend, two words spring
to mind: MAJOR DAMAGE.
The competitive fury, as well as
the dedication and spirit that is
a trademark of this team, was
forever imprinted on the
Wesleyan track.
The men placed fourth out of
15 teams, and the women placed
fourth out of 13 teams. The
women placed fourth (50) out of
13 teams, behind Trinity (55),
Marist College (90), and
Wesleyan (97), while the men
placed fourth (49) out of 15
teams, behind Wesleyan (75),
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
(85), and Marist (97). There
were some memorable highlights on both the men's and
women's sides.
Stephanie Herring '99 won
the hurdles with a time of 9.29
seconds. Desiree Peterkin 'OO
also performed extremely well,
winning the long jump (5.03 m)
and triple jump (11.34m).
An amazing story of guts and
grit came from Marragh Gotesik
'O2. Gotesik made the fi- i—nals in the 55-meter dash.

early.
McManimen is not the only
outstanding wrestler in his
family. His brother, Alex, a
junior at Washington & Lee
University, ranks justbelow his
younger brother in the Conference, though the two have yet
to meet in a collegiate attle.
In addition, their brother Cory,
a high school senior who also
wrestles around the same
weight class, is currently being sought out by other Centennial Conference teams.
Wrestling in the McManimen
house is a family affair, and
since their schools are close
to home, the brothers draw a
lot of local support to the
matches.
McManimen cites his only
loss —a 6-3 decision to Williams' Dan Dicenzo —as the
most difficult match of his
Swarthmore career. Fortunately, he will be able to meet
Dicenzo again this Saturday.
He then sets his sights on the
Conference Championships,
where he is likely to continue
his impressive career.

Women b-ballers slam
Centennial Conf. foes

This past Saturday, Swat
wrestling hosted a quad match
with Centennial Conference
teams Ursinus, Western Maryland and Washington & Lee.
The Garnet, unfortunately, did
not fare as well as they had
hoped, finishing the day 0-3.
Western Maryland, the defending Conference Champion,
defeated Swarthmore 31-18.
Despite the loss, the team had
four individual winners. Adrian
Wilson '99 (141 lbs) and Justin
Pagliei 'O2 (Hwt) both had wins
by decision, as Ben Gaines 'OO
and
Keith
(157
lbs)
McManimen 'O2 (184 lbs) won
by fall with times of 1:12 and
3:07 respectively.
In their match-up with

beat to Gettysburg

Howes-Mischel third and Erica
Rosenthal 'OO fifth. Each
woman swam in-season bests by
considerable amounts. Shari
Linden '99 continued to drop
time in the 500 Freestyle.
Bonarou, Harvey and AmirArjomand placed 2-3-4 respectively while Allison Lyons 'O2
swam a strong race. The final relay of Polinsky, Harvey,
Bonarou and Auerbach just was
not enough as the Bullets
touched the Garnet out. The final score of the women's meet
was 87-118, though on the deck
the meet certainly felt a lot
closer.
The men's meet (62-142) was
just as tense with many close
races and outstanding times.
Earley demonstrated this with
an in-season best and second
place finish in the 1000
Freestyle. Nik Johnson 'Ol and
Paul Dickson 'OO each significantly bettered their times in the
200 Freestyle, while Josh Farber
'O2 did the same in the 50.
The men's IM was just as
remarkable as the women's,
with Sherer and Fruh finishing second and third in extremely speedy times. Fred
Gerson '99 knocked a couple
seconds off his time as well.
Aymeric Pansu 'Ol and
Tsong Lin 'OO continue to
persevere in the 200 Butterfly swimming consistently
strong times. Johnson recorded a best time in the 100
Freestyle, only to better it
later in the 400 Freestyle Relay.
Earley remained consistent in
the 200 Backstroke finishing
second, while Dickson grabbed
fourth. The trio of Chris Seaman
'99, Ryan Muldowney 'O2 and
Farber all dropped time in the
500 Freestyle.
The men's breaststrokers continue to dominate the conference. Sherer shocked the crowd
with an amazing time winning
the event. Denda and Gerson
finished second and third. The
men's meet closed with the team
of Johnson, Gabe Turzo 'Ol,
Dickson and Muldowney placing third.
The Garnet travels to Ursinus
on Saturday, but closes the dual
meet season against Washington
College next Wednesday at

Hopes were high for the S warthmore Swim Team when the
men's and women's 400 Medley Relays began the meet by
beating the Gettysburg Bullets.
The first event signaled that the
Garnet might have a chance to
overcome the depth of their perennial rival. Unfortunately, Gburg was too strong for Swat,
but both teams swam many personal bests in the meet.
Alissa Parmelee 'Ol, Melissa
Amir-Arjomand 'OO, Cathy
Polinsky '99 and Claire Arbour
'OO all swam exceptional races
to defeat the Bullets in the opening relay and set a new pool
record. The men's team ofKeith
Earley '99, Yasu Denda 'O2, Ted
Sherer 'Ol and Ryan Fruh '99
also accomplished victory.
Freshman Amy Auerbach
continued to display her
stamina, winning both 1000
Freestyle and the 500 Freestyle.
Mari McCrann 'OO was close on
her heels in both races, achieving an in-season best in the
1000. The women 200
Freestylers all achieved in-season bests with Arbour finishing
second, Becca Howes-Mischel
'Ol fourth. Polinsky snuck into
third place in the 50 against the
sprinting Gettysburg team.
Arbour also finished third in the
100 Freestyle. Sarah Marsh 'OO
had strong races in both the 50
and 100.
The Garnet women dominated the 200 JM, packing a 1-2
against the Bullets. Parmelee
won the event in an in-season
best while Jenny Harvey 99
touched second with an outstanding time. Freshman Lisa
Ladewski also swam the fastest
time she had done yet for Swarthmore.
Alice Bonarou 'O2 achieved
another B-cut in the 200 Butterfly finishing second to her biggest conference competitor. Jill
Belding '99 placed third in the
race. Belding, Elisabeth
Newcomb 'OO, and JoDe
Hendrick 'OO each achieved inseason bests in the 200 Butterfly.

Fords thrashed, 7048; F&M falls, 81-65
by Jean Quinn
Sports Editor

Rebounding from a difficult month in
which they dropped seven important
games, the Garnet rallied to change the
course oftheir season by soundly defeating both Franklin and Marshall and
Haverford in two key Centennial matchups. The women's basketball squad overcame a nineteen point first-half deficit to
route the Diplomats in Lancaster last
Saturday, 81-65. They steadily built an
insurmountable lead against the rival
Fords to win 70-48 Wednesday night.
The team is now 7-10 overall and 3-7 in
the conference with seven games remaining.
The Garnet came out flat against the
Diplomats and trailed early by nearly
twenty points. Undaunted by the score,
Swat battled back to make the contest a
close one by the break. Heather
Marandola 'Ol found Heather Kile 'O2
under the basket on an inbounds play with
4 seconds remaining to narrow the lead
to four points, 37-33.
The team came out fired up and went
on a 10-0 run to steal the lead from the
Diplomats for good. The opening minutes of the second half were perhaps the
best played by the Garnet all year long.
The team shot an amazing 63% from the
floor and was 4 for 7 from beyond the
arc in the second period to ice the victory. As evidence of the team's collaborative effort to chalk up a conference win,
five players were in double figures: Kile
had 21 points and 13 boards, Katie Tarr
'O2 had a career best 16 points including
3 three-pointers, Marandola and Jean
Quinn '99 each had 12 points, and Kristen
English 'O2 had 10 points with 3 threepointers as well. In addition, Marandola
notched a career-best 9 assists in the vic-

tory.
"The F&M game was one I will never
forget," said Coach Adrienne Shibles.
"We were down by 19 points in the first
half, yet I never saw the panicked looks
on their faces. The team was having fun
on the court, and it made all the difference in the outcome of that game."
The positive morale carried into
Wednesday's match-up with the
Haverford Fords. The squad took an
early lead and broke the Fords' 1-3-1
defense with ease. Swat effectively shut
down the Fords' leading scorer and succeeded in getting their point guard in
early foul trouble. The Garnet went to
the boards hard, nabbing 62 rebounds
compared to Haverford's 37, and had
only 14 turnovers.
"We moved the ball well, got to good
shots, and had an impressive 28 offensive boards, said Shibles. The 70-48 outcome was well-deserved for the Garnet,
who have been working hard to find success.

Kile had 25 points and a career-best
21 boards in the game. English had 10
points and 5 assists, while Tarr had 10
points, 8 boards, and 3 assists. Quinn
collected 12 rebounds and scored 6
points and Marandola added 8 points and
6 boards. Christina Ciambriello 'O2
added 6 points off the bench.
"I am so proud of the way the team
responded to adversity. We had a rough
couple of weeks in January, but they
never lost their intensity," commented
Shibles. "They came to each practice
ready to give 100 percent. Everyone
knew it was just a matter of time before
things clicked."
The squad returns to the court for a 2
p.m. contest against Bryn Mawr tomorrow, to be followed at 4 p.m. by the annual Alumni game. On Tuesday, the
Garnet play host to Washington College
and will attempt to avenge a one-point
overtime loss to the Shorewomen earlier
this season. Tip-off is at 7 p.m.

Men's b-ball team trounces
Fords in grudge match, 67-57
Tim Schofield
'99 scores 24 in
the Garnet's
first Centennial
Conference win
by Ben Park
Staff Writer
Swarthmore (1-7; 3-15) led

all forty minutes in their 67 to
57 victory over the Ford's (2-

6; 4-14) Wednesday night.
Leading all scorers was Tim
Schofield '99 with 24 points
on an astounding 8 for 9 from
the field, including 4 of 5 from
behind the three point arc. He
also led all rebounders with
nine, and passed his way to
four assists, a game high.
the
Entering
game,
Haverford and Swarthmore
were near each other in almost
every statistical category.
Scoring offense had both
teams ranked 9th and 10th and
scoring defense 6th and 7th
respectively. In only a few
categories, which were free
throw percentage, steals, and
three pointers made, were
Swarthmore and Haverford
farther than three rankings
apart. Yet throughout the
game, Swarthmore defied the
numbers and dominated in the
one statistical category that
has plagued the team all season, field goal percentage.
Swarthmore entered the
game shooting a dismal 35.8
percent from the field, placing
them last in the conference.
When the game began, however, the inside presence of
freshman David Gammill
guaranteed easy layups and
high percentage scoring. The
Garnet made a fabulous 57.7
percent of their shots in the
first half, and finished the
game having made 23 of 44 of
their field goal attempts. It
only took ten minutes to climb
to a nine-point lead that they
would not relinquish for the
rest of the game. Gammill finished with 12 points and eight
rebounds,
while Gregg

Holtmeier 'OO finished second
on the team with 14 points.
Another highlight of the
game was Swarthmore's
dominance on the boards, as
they collected 42 rebounds
compared to 30 by the Ford's.
This resulted in few second
chance shots, which Haverford
needed desperately in order to
win the game. Five Swarthmore players had seven or
more rebounds, including twotime honor roll honoree Kyle
Lewis 'O2, JJ Purdy and Mike
Schall.
Haverford's story was one of
a disappointing night from
Mukul Kanabar 'OO who entered the game averaging 14
points a game, and who was
widely regarded as an allaround solid player. Yet due
to the solid defensive pressure
produced by the Garnet in
their 3-2 zone, Kanabar was
held to a ridiculously low 2
points and a dismal 1 of 10
from the fuld. He finished the
game early, fouling out with
his highest numbers in shot
attempts and personal fouls in
what was most likely his poorest outing of the year.
Despite the dominating box
score, there was a sense of
wariness on the part of the

fans, with the exception of the
young men and women who
spelled out Swarthmore with
red paint on their bodies.
Haverford kept fighting despite the large lead that the
Garnet possessed throughout
the game, and as a result one
couk' feel that at any moment
the Ford's could start making
their shots and stun Swarthmore. In fact, as Chris Riley
began to take and make a few
of his shots towards the end of
the half, the only thing keeping Swarthmore ahead was the
outstanding play of Schofield.
Schofield finished the first half
without missing a shot, some
of which were rather unbelievable as Swarthmore led 38 to

26.
Haverford had its best shot
at gaining the lead five minutes into the second half as
they began out-rebounding the
Garnet on a few possessions.
They closed the gap to 10
points, and attempted to make
their stand on the defensive
end of the ball. Yet again
Swarthmore worked with uncharacteristic offensive patience, working the ball inside
to Gammill as they took a fifteen-point lead with 12 minutes left in the half. They took

their largest lead of the game,
52 to 35, as Schall took one
strong to the basket after the
Ford's decided to throw the
double team at Gammill.
Swarthmore closed up the
game by making nine of their
eleven free throws over a two
minute span as the crowd
erupted into "Hey Goodbye"
with a minute left to play.
The Swarthmore Garnet face
Haverford once more on the
Feb. 20 at Haverford, and this
Saturday they face Ursinus (53; 9-9) in what could be their
most exciting game of the season. In their last meeting they
were beaten at home by Ursinus
by 5 points. This Saturday at 9
p.m. they meet the Bears at the
Palestra, Philadelphia's most
beautiful basketball arena.
