College changes alcohol policy
BY MATTHEW FITTING
A change in the college's alco-

hol policy now requires Party
Associates (PAs) to check partygoers' IDs for age in addition to TriCo student status, and also stamp
the hands of those over 21 to noti-

fy those in charge of alcohol who
to serve. The Deans' Advisory
Committee (DAC) decided to
make the modification in light of
recent alcohol-related incidents
on campus.
first
The
was
change
announced last week at PA training. Residential assistants (RAs)
learned of the change in policy in
an e-mail sent at the beginning of
last weekend from Dean of
Student Life Tedd Goundie.
"Please make sure people are
aware of this," wrote Goundie. "I
don't want people to be surprised
when it happens."
Changing the college's alcohol
policy has been considered since
the year before last, when the
DAC began reviewing the policy
as mandated by federal law,
according to Goundie.
When the committee's review
began, "we specifically didn't
make it the responsibility of the
PA [to check for age], because we
were concerned that it would
open the PAs up to more liability,"
Goundie said. But now the DAC's
stance has changed, and, in
Goundie's words, the new policy
in fact leaves PAs open to "less
exposure" than the old. As long as
they only mark those over 21, he
said, any underage drinking is
the fault of those serving alcohol
at parties.
The move makes good sense,
said Jenny Yim, coordinator of
student activities. "This simply
makes the job of party hosts easier because the checking of IDs is
done from the get-go," she said.

Recent incidents, including
the Sept. 7 Ultimate Frisbee party
where three minors entered and
drank illegally, encouraged the
deans to make the change now as
opposed to later in the semester,

as was originally planned.
Another factor was reports
Goundie was receiving that said
"there was very little age-checking going on at the bar," according to the dean.
Goundie said the Frisbee party
incident was crucial in moving up

the deans' timetable. "That made
it more pressing for us," he said.
"Had [the Frisbee teams] been
checking for IDs and age, there's
no way those three minors
would've gotten into the party."
The deans were reluctant to go
any further with the change,
according to Dean of the College
Bob Gross, but something had to
be done. "Incidents with police
over the years have reminded us
that party hosts are taking some
real risks if they're not doing
something to try to enforce the
law," he said. "We didn't want to
go in to hokey things like separate rooms, as some schools have
done. We're still counting on the
integrity of bartenders to make
sure the law's observed.
"I and every dean I know
would prefer that the drinking
age were 18, so we could more
effectively control the monitoring
of alcohol on campus," added
Gross. "But it's not, so we have to
make accommodations."

Enforcement issues
Different people gave different
accounts regarding whether the
new policy was enforced at last
weekend's various parties.
"They gave alcohol to anyone
who wanted it," said Ben Camp

Senator proposes moratorium on foreign student visas

As news comes out that
one or more of the terrorists

more intensely the almost half million foreign students

Web page, is spearheading a movement to impose a sixmonth moratorium on all new student visas.
She also wants the United States to spend $32 million to
help the Immigration and Naturalization Service immediately install a computerized foreign student tracking system, which has been in development for several years.
Educational institutions that host foreign students,
Feinstein believes, should take on the responsibility of submitting quarterly progress reports to the INS and ensuring
that foreign students comply with the terms of the visa.
Though Feinstein's proposed six-month moratorium on
student visas would impact the class of 2006 at
Swarthmore, Gloria Evans, the college's foreign student
adviser, is not too worried. "I don't think it's going to happen," she said, citing numerous movements already introduced by such groups as NAFSA: The Association of
International Educators, and a nationally recognized
immigration law firm to urge concerned citizens to contact
Congress to oppose Feinstein's proposal.
The government tracking system, which has been in
development since the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center, was a much more likely if not definite possibility,
Evans said. But she was unsure whether Feinstein's proposal would affect the program's national launch date of
2003, which was set at the project's initiation in 1996.
A pilot study of the tracking system, intended to help
INS authorities keep track of students to make sure that

they are entering and leaving the country legally, as well
as whether students are remaining in school full-time (a
qualification of the F-l student visa), was recently completed in the southern quadrant of the United States,
Evans said.
Currently, she said, "the United States doesn't have very
good records about whether students are here or if they have
gone" after the expiration of their student visas. She thinks
the new tracking system would help the government have
better control over information about foreign students.
But Evans was unsure of how much of an effect the new
system would have in thwarting terrorists from entering
the country, citing loose borders as a more likely means of
terrorist entry. "I have some doubts about how much effect
it will have, but it's a step in the right direction to find out
how many foreign students we have [in the United
States],"

she said.

Evans said she was not sure how much the increased
access to student information would affect students at
Swarthmore. Swarthmore foreign students are rarely the
subject of inquiry by the FBI or other law enforcement
agencies, she said, as "our students have been very law
abiding." She added, however, that, in the more distant
past, she has been contacted to verify the enrollment of
certain foreign students.

ALCOHOL

Frisbee party hosts
avoid $3,000 fines
BY MATTHEW FITTING
Swarthmore police have decided not to press
charges against the two hosts of the Ultimate

Frisbee teams' party, where three minors entered
and illegally consumed alcohol on Sept. 7. Had
authorities chosen to pursue action beyond the

college's previous punishment, both hosts could
have faced fines of at least $3,000 each, according
to the college party permits they signed.
Pennsylvania law states that anyone intentionally supplying alcohol to a minor is guilty of
a misdemeanor in the third degree, an offense
that carries a minimumfine of $l,OOO per underage person served. That would have added up to
a minimum totalfine of $3,000 for both hosts.
"We were in discussions with [Dean of

Student Life Tedd] Goundie, and some of the
things he presented us with convinced us not to
go ahead," said borough police chief Brian

Craig. He added that although charges would
not be pressed, the college needs to address alcohol and parties on campus. "There needs to be
more discussion, and at this point we're going to
accept [the college's punishment] as a token of
good faith as far as accountability goes," he said.
"There are other things we're going to look
at," he said, as punishment for the team, possibly
including an apology from both the squads to the
parents of the three minors. The police, Goundie
said, "recognize that the team took responsibility once they realized their mistake by calling
public safety to remove the local minors, and
that the college has taken their lapse seriously
and imposed an appropriate sanction."
Men's team tri-captain Misha Horowitz 'O3
said Frisbee players were already considering
an apology. "The police action wasn't the only
thing that's been heavy on our minds the last
couple of weeks," he said. "We've been trying to
express to the parents how sorry we are."
"We're lucky," said Ana Stratton 'O4, a captain
of the women's team. "It seemed like a long,
drawn-out process for the final decision. We were
all very nervous what was going to happen."
Patrick Hagan 'O2, another tri-captain of the
men's team, said the college's punishment has
proved valuable to himselfand the teams. Hagan
served as a Party Associate at last weekend's
Intercultural Center party. "I was acutely aware
of all the problems that could take place at a
party for all four hours," he said. Forty-four of
the Frisbee teams' members attended PA training two weeks ago, a number that will supply
the college with free PAs for most of the year.
Goundie said he will write letters to each
minor's parent, "to let them know how we handled the situation and express my concern that
it happened."

Partnerships offer life lessons
Staff members, students pair up for help with reading, writing, computer skills
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
John Haubrich, a facilities worker, considers himself
fairly knowledgeable when dealing with basic computer programs. Haubrich's dream computer project was to design a
Web page showing off his family and hobbies. Yet he was
never able to master Web design programs. "After five tries,
I thought I was done for," he said. "I thought I would never
have my own home page."
But then Haubrich received word about Learning for
Life, a program offered by the education department at
Swarthmore. After a semester of working with Lester Tran
'O4, Haubrich had designed what he called "the best home
page possible."
Haubrich's success story is only one of the many that
come out of Learning for Life partnerships. Run by assistant
professor of education Diane Anderson, this program,
according to its Web site, "pairs Swarthmore College students with members of the college staff, primarily environmental service, dining services and facilities workers." The
students and the staff member work in one-on-one sessions
to develop certain literacy skills.
These literacies, explained Anderson, are not necessarily
the stereotypical reading skills. "Our program deals with
anything that has to do with words," she said.
Staff and students can cover anything from basic reading
and writing skills to public speaking to computer literacy
sessions.
The most popular topics covered in the partnerships,
according to Anderson, are computer literacy and English as
a second language.
Staff members and students are paired up based on the

"It helps students learn how to
teach and how to appreciate things
we usually take for granted."
Brigid Brett-Esborn 'O4
needs of each person involved in the partnership. For example, dining services employee Jamie Layton, a Vietnamese
woman, wanted help mastering written English language.
She paired up with Janine Gibbons 'Ol, who wanted to learn

Vietnamese.
In the end, the partnership was beneficial to both. "My
reading right now is really improved. This summer, I went
through three books, which is a lot for me," Layton said. "I
also loved to teach Janine my language."
Although at first Learning for Life sounds as though it is a
tutoring program, Anderson stressed that the students are not
playing the role of tutor to the staff. These learning sessions are
valuable to both the staff member and the student. "Figuring
out how to do things together is what's important to both people
in this partnership," she said.
Brigid Brett-Esborn 'O4, one of the student coordinators
for the program, explained more about the give-and-take
nature of the partnerships. "This program allows people to
form relationships that they would not have otherwise
made," she said. "I believe that it also helps students learn
how to teach and how to appreciate things we usually take

Services employees and Brigid Brett-Esbome.

for granted."
Students and staff alike who have participated in this program extol the virtues of these partnerships. Tran, who
helped Haubrich with the Web design project, did not expect
to get as much out of the program as he did. As a freshman
last year, Tran was looking for ways to get involved with the
community service programs available at Swarthmore.
"Initially, I viewed it as an opportunity to get to know someone in facilities that I would never have met otherwise," he
said. "I was also looking for ways to impart some of my Web
design knowledge onto someone else."
After a semester of working together, Tran and Haubrich
are close friends. "Now, to me, he's a human being with problems," Tran said. "He shares secrets with me; I share secrets
with him. We've really gotten to know each other well."
Haubrich echoed Tran's sentiments. According to
Haubrich, he and Tran "became good buds," and they are
still in touch. They frequently go out to dinner together.
"Lester was an excellent instructor. He would tell me
what to do and let me do it on my own," Haubrich said. "At
the same time that he was teaching me, I was giving him
back life experiences that I thought would help him."
With stories such as these all over campus, the Learning
for Life program has grown tremendously since its inception. "This program was founded by students who looked at
what Swarthmore had to offer in terms of community service programs," explained Anderson.
"They noticed that all of the opportunities involved traveling off campus, and they wondered what they could do to
improve our own community," she said.
In the fall of 1999, there were three pairings, she said.
This semester there will be approximately 45, and, as the
year goes on, both Anderson and Brett-Esborn hope this
growth will continue. "Our goal this year is to have as many
staff members participate as possible," Brett-Esborn said.

Proposed restrictions not likely to affect college's international students
From VISAS, pg. 3
During the communist scare, national
officials would sometimes check in on students from the Soviet Union or communist
China, and more recently, during the IranContra Affair, FBI officials came to the
Swarthmore campus and photographed the
college's Iranian students so they could
know "who they were and where they
were," Evans said.
She pointed out, however, that at all
these times the college did not release any
information beyond what was public
knowledge.
Swarthmore students have not been
inquired about at all in he recent past,
Evans said. "I have had no inquiry from
the FBI for close to ten years," she added.

OCTOBER 4, 2001

Nor does she expect any calls from the FBI
regarding the recent terrorist attacks. "I'm
not expecting any calls from the government. We don't have many Middle Eastern
students here, and I'm urging all [foreign]
students to be sure their documents are in
order," she said.
Feinstein's proposal, if passed, would
also greatly increase the amount of
responsibility colleges have in monitoring
their
international students.
Currently, according to Evans and the
Inquirer story, colleges are not responsible for keeping track of students once
they have left their institutions, nor are
they responsible for researching or
reporting background information on
their foreign students or reporting
foreign student progress toward a degree.

THE PHOENIX

This results in foreign students who
remain in the country illegally after their
visas have expired or students who obtain
visas to study at a specific institution and
never enroll in the said college.
Both Evans and Manuel Carballo, assistant dean of admissions, felt that any step
to force schools to take on the responsibility of providing the government with
security-related data would not be a good
one. "It's not Swarthmore's job [to be concerned with security information], I don't
think it should be Swarthmore's job, and I
don't know how Swarthmore could possibly do that [job]," Carballo said. "We're not
policemen," Evans said.
Furthermore, Carballo said that he felt
government attention should be focused on
flight and technical schools, where many of

the alleged terrorists of both the Sept. 11
and past attacks appear to have obtained
visas to study. "To target all of U.S. higher
education would be a big mistake,"
Carballo said.
Some foreign prospective students were
already beginning to worry about the effect
the attacks might play in their ability to
study at Swarthmore, Carballo said. A
student from Bangladesh contacted him
earlier in the week asking if the college
would discriminate against Moslems in
making its admissions decisions.
According to Carballo, the college will
not. But he expressed anxiety that
increased national security might prevent
some students from obtaining the student
visas they need in order to study at the

college.

Immigrant doc offers Sharples fare, medical advice
BY REIKO

TESHIBA

Nellie Tong 'O2 was surprised when Zakir
Khandkar, a dining services employee,
spoke to her as she was standing in line at
the "Garnet Gourmet" bar in Sharpies three
weeks ago. "I was getting pasta and he
looked at me and said, 'You have angular
stomatitis,' Tong said. Angular stomatitis
is inflammation of the corners of the lips.
"He pointed to his lips and said, 'You need
riboflavin. You have vitamin B2 deficiency.'
I thought, all right, and asked what I should
do. He suggested I go to Genuardi's and get a
box of mangos, since they have a lot of vitamin 82."

who is also from Bangladesh and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have a daughter
named Yasmin, who is almost five months
old. Her name means "a playful manner" in
Bangla, the language of Bangladesh.
Khandkar's mother-in-law, Nazma Alam,
also works at Sharpies as a checker. She
immigrated to the United States in 1989 in
the hope of a better education for her four
children.

"Before, I didn't like it here in the
United States," Alam said. "I missed the
food, my family and my husband's family."
But, after 12 years, she considers the

United States "home." She still wears a
scarf over her head, which is reminiscent
of the flowing saris she used to wear in
Bangladesh. "My children don't cover their
heads, though. They wear American
clothes," she said.
Khandkar has had an easier time

adjusting to life in this country. Unlike
Alam, who learned English from a social
worker, Khandkar had learned medicine
from a British teacher. "The [American]
pronunciation was different and difficult.
For example, the last letter in the alphabet
is pronounced 'zee,' not 'zed,' he said. He
also took lessons for three months at the
International House at the University of
Pennsylvania to brush up on the language.

medical textbooks and manuals, filled with
pictures of MRIs and CT scans. He and his

are hard at work, studying together for the
U.S. Medical Licensing Examination that

wonderful man. He's so grateful to have his

to watch him interact with the students; he

Tong was one of the first students whose

name Khandkar learned. She's known him

worked as an intern. "I casually asked him

she recalled. "He said, 'l'm a doctor.' I was

"I don't know about the Phi Psi party," said John

served as PA at the

Encouraging

more parties

Those who attended a study break held last Thursday, co-

sponsored by

Student Council and the Social Affairs

committee, heard ofthe policy change before most students

including RAs. The council and SAC held the break to
encourage groups and individuals to throw more parties.
SAC co-directors Gabe Hankins 'O3 and Dave
Kaczorowski 'O3 hosted the break and delivered news of
tne policy change near the end.
We're going to have to expect more police
intervention
m the future this year,"
Hankins told those attending the

break, citing the same past incidents of trouble with alcohol on campus. "The level of scrutiny is going to go up."
Hankins said he doesn't believe the change will discourage people from throwing more parties on campus.
"They should be encouraged," he said. "Now the procedure is more regularized and made clear to everybody. It's
more obvious what the requirements are, and to that
extent it's easier [for party hosts and PAs] if something

"After Margaritaville, there wasn't really a reduced
number of parties," he added, referring to a party at Delta
Upsilon fraternity at the end of spring 1999, where 27
underage drinkers, including 18 Swarthmore students,

were arrested. "I think in a week or two things will be back
to normal."
Goundie agreed the change should have a positive
impact as far as increasing the number of parties thrown.
"I think it'll give people more confidence if they know
they have this mechanism to protect them from serving
alcohol to underage drinkers," he said.
Various group leaders on campus greeted the change
mainly with indifference.
"I don't think it hurts parties so much," said Randy
Keim 'O2, president of DU, which will hold a toga party this
Saturday night. "I think it's a statement and an extra step
that makes it clearer to party organizers what's expected,
but I don't think fundamentally too much has changed."
The fraternity had planned to implement a similar system of checking ID s that used wristbands instead ofhand
stamps. Keim said DU brothers would be allowed to keep
this particular system for their parties.
"People are going to get their liquor on their own somehow," he added. "As long as it's not from us, we're less
liable from the police and the school."

'Where terror has no place'
Philosopher describes the Brazilian Workers' Party, an organization
aiming to be 'a flag for social justice in all of its manifestations'
BY BETH REDDEN
In light of the events on Sept. 11, Anna Carolina
Regner wondered whether she should still travel to
Swarthmore as the annual Latin American Studies
visitor. "What is the point of it all?" she asked a
roomful of students and professors.
What, she asked, is "the point of considering
the Workers' Party of Brazil when the world is
falling apart?" Nevertheless, upon further reflection, she determined that her projects "have everything to do with what is going on."
Regner explained that the Brazilian Workers'
Party, or "Partido Trabalhador" (PT) has, over the
past two decades of its existence, worked on "building
a more just, less violent world where terrorism has
no place." Regner said the PT, founded in 1980, is dedicated to becoming 'la flag for social justice in all of its
manifestations, from civil rights to agrarian reform."
A philosophy professor at the Universidade
Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and currently a visiting scholar at Stanford University, she explained PT
and its beliefs to approximately 25 students and faculty last Tuesday. Regner is a distinguished philosopher and historian of science whose principle interests are Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"
and the development of Brazil. Her lecture was entitled "The Brazilian Workers Party in Power: Rio
Grande do Sul, the State of Popular Participation."
Regner used the rise of the PT in her own state,
the Rio Grande do Sul, as a basis upon which to elaborate on the party in general. The southernmost state
in Brazil and one which is now under a PT government, the Rio Grande do Sul is a major center for the
party, Regner explained. But it is far from the only
one. With over 1,500 PT city council representatives,
seven senators, and three governors now in office,
the party now commands much more influence from
which to spread its central theory of social inclusion.
Regner explained that the theory of social inclu-

commitment to social change, along with the party's
corruption-free record, has come to characterize the
PT over the last few years, she said.
Kaysha Corinealdi 'O2, who plans to graduate with
a concentration in Latin American studies, said that
she thought Regner "was very thorough in examining the intellectual basis of the party." Corinealdi
added that she was pleased to learn that the PT
seemed to be providing hope for Brazilian citizens.

Even so, Regner cautioned, "It is still too early to
evaluate the success of their policies." If nothing
else, though, said Regner, the PT has succeeded in
creating a new way of political thinking in Brazil.

"But there aren't enough
students around over the

Instead of the typical partnerships, Ansell worked out a
way to hold group sessions over
the summer.
The collection of staff members met with her ten different
times during the summer to
address what she called "a
educational

group-generated

curriculum."
One of the goals for this summer was to get the staff thinking
about how to run educational
workshops, Ansell explained.

"When we started this summer, we knew that this [fall]
semester would be the first one
where the Learning for Life program would be run by student
and staff coordinators," she
said.

us for this because each person

Ansell explained that work-

shops ranged from a session in

the Mullan Center, where the
group learned about the workout machines, to a session with
the school mechanic, who
showed the group the basics of

At the end of the summer, the
group hosted a big party where
all the staff members were able
to meet each other's families
and children.
In the end, Ansell was
pleased with the outcome of the
program. "This summer was
really special for the people

involved," she said.
"It gave staff members the
chance to hang out with each
other while having a common
goal. Staff members who otherwise wouldn't have known each

Responding to survey, students find campus spots unsafe
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
In response to a safety survey,
the board of the Women's
Resource Center (WRC) teamed
up with Student Council and
public safety last Wednesday on a
walk to investigate poorly lit
areas of campus.
Following an attempted rape
and aggravated indecent assault
on campus, the WRC conducted
the survey last spring in which
respondents said they considered
several areas of campus worthy of
concern due to the poor lighting.
Also, nearly a third of the students polled said they were not
aware of the Safewalk program
administered by public safety.
On average, there are 100
crimes reported on campus each
year, according to Redgrave. The
safety survey was distributed
after a week in which The
Phoenix reported one attempted
rape, twenty-six cases of vandalism and one case where a student
was charged with aggravated
assault, resisting arrest, public
drunkenness, disorderly conduct
and criminal mischief.
Thirty-one percent of students
polled said they did not know that
they could request an escort anywhere on campus. Almost onehalf (44 percent) said that, despite
feeling unsafe while walking,
they did not call public safety to
request an escort because they

felt "silly." Over three-fifths of students (61 percent) said they
thought public safety should have
provided more information about
the assault, while 17 percent
thought public safety should be
more honest when issuing bul-

letins.
The survey also solicited information about where and when
students felt unsafe. Almost onequarter (22 percent) of those surveyed pointed to the SEPTA tunnels as an area in need of more
lighting, while 20 percent felt
unsafe in the area around the
WRC, Olde Club and the fraterni-

ties.
The Sharpies area (16

percent)
and off-campus dormitories (15
percent) were also mentioned as

areas that lacked sufficient lighting. The attempted rape occurred
near Sharpies.
Dean Tedd Goundie said the
recent excursion was an "initial
walk to see where more lighting
was needed."
According to Owen Redgrave,
director of public safety, the
groups decided the area around
Olde Club needed more lighting.
The SEPTA tunnel, however, was
found to be sufficiently lit.
There had been reports that
light bulbs blew out frequently
near the tunnel and were not
quickly replaced.

Students travel to capital
and rally for world peace
BY AMANDA SCHNEIDER
Over 50 Swarthmore students traveled to
Washington, D.C. this weekend to join thousands
protesting the militancy of U.S. foreign policy in
the wake of the attacks of Sept. 1L
"Protests are going on now because we feel the
policy the United States has adopted is going to fail
and is going to make the current situation worse,"
Dann Naseemullah 'O2 said.
Most students who traveled to Washington on
Saturday attended a protest that the International
ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism)
Coalition arranged in the last two weeks following
cancellation of the International Monetary Fund
meeting and accompanying protests originally
planned for last weekend .
"On Saturday, there was a rally for three hours
that included every issue under the sun. Then we
marched from the Freedom Plaza to the Capitol,"
Naseemullah said.
"It was very much in the anti-globalization par-

adigm, with all the issues coming together to make
a fusion protest," he said. Participating groups
stated their opposition to U.S. policy in terms of
their concerns about racism, globalism, capitalism
and a range of other issues.
Many students also participated in a protest on
Sunday organized by the Washington Peace Center
in affiliation with the American Friends Service
Committee. The Sunday event featured varying
religious leaders and involved a march through

residential areas.

of how many people were there on Saturday,"
Jonah Eaton 'O2 said. "We've been guessing
amongst ourselves between 10,000 and 15,000."

Although many had predicted extensive counter-protests and organizers prepared for the possibility of police brutality, students reported the
events were generally calm.
"I don't think any of us saw more than 20 count-

er-protesters," Naseemullah said. "The police were
only there to protect us. It was a legal march and a
legal rally on both days. There was no civil disobe-

dience."
Motivations for protesting ranged from general
pacifist beliefs to specific opposition to imminent
U.S. military action.
"I needed to see that there are people who feel
like I do
that war won't solve the problem," Kim
Bussey 'O4 said. "It's being presented to the public
that war is the only solution. People who disagree
need to present their opinions."
Many students joined the protests because they
fear retaliation for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
will only increase the problem of terrorism.
"There's a very strong, rational argument to be
made that these terrorist acts happened not
because we appeared weak, but because we
appeared strong," Eaton said. "For many people,
we appear to be a threat, and they feel their only
recourse is sudden acts of violence." Increasing the
perception of threat would only increase the likelihood of further violence, he added.

Objectivist speaker offends some students
BY

RAGHU KARNAD

A prominent member of the
Ayn Rand Institute gave a lecture

last week, "The Moral Imperative

of Self Defense," that offended
several Swarthmore students. Dr.
Andrew Bernstein, a professor of
philosophy at Pace University
and the State University of New
York at Purchase, gave an objectivist analysis of the causes of
and appropriate responses to the
Sept. 11 attacks.
The founder of objectivism
Ayn Rand described her philosophy in four parts as reason, capitalism, self-interest and objective
reality, according to the Web site

Bernstein said the core of his

belief was the opposition between
Islam's "philosophy of death" and
the "philosophy of life" of
America and the western world.
He said there is a hostile
dichotomy between Islamic
demands of faith, self-sacrifice
and self-abnegation and Western
Principles of secularism, egocentrism and capitalism. According
to Bernstein, the realization that
the western system is superior
has prompted Islamic fanatics to
try to destroy it, making any dialogue or coexistence impossible.
With this premise, he called

He described a solution in which
America notifies the Taliban, the

civilians one week "to ride their
donkeys out of there," leaving the

A guest lecturer recalls the infancy of gay rights activism in America.

Gittings describes 42
years of gay activism
BY JARED LENOW
Veteran gay rights activist Barbara Gittings presented a personal
history of the movement in which she has played a central role
Tuesday afternoon, entitled "Gay and Smiling: Tales from our 50 years

of activism."

Gittings' presentation, the second in a series of lectures commemorating the Intercultural Center's tenth anniversary, focused on the
issues, people and events of the early American gay and lesbian rights
movement. The movement began in the late 19405, and Gittings became
active in 1958, "when there were scarcely two hundred of us in the whole
United States. It was like a club," she said. "We all knew each other."
"Even though I've read the history, she reminds you these were real
people, not just pictures in a book," said SQU board member Jackie
Aponte 'O2, who introduced Gittings. "Having Barbara Gittings tell us
about the history of the movement made it that much more vivid."
•'Just being in the company of someone who is a true revolutionary,
it kind of awakens you," said IC Acting Director Meghna Bhagat. "It is
inspiring. She is just a legend."
Gittings spoke of the difficulty for younger people to understand the
stigma that was attached to homosexuality in the early days of the
movement. She displayed a number of overheads with pictures of cultural artifacts to show American attitudes toward gay men and women
in the 1950s and 19605, and laughed along with her audience at newspaper headlines that proclaimed "Police to harass pervert hangouts,"
"State department fires 531 perverts," and pulp novels with titles like
"Dance-hall Dyke," but quickly recalled the all-too-real influence they
had on American opinion. "In the beginning, there was a risk you
could get arrested for talking about this taboo subject." she said. Later,
she reminded the audience, "If not for these groups' meeting 50 years
ago, we wouldn't have a Swarthmore Queer Union."
In addition to providing a general history of the movement, Gittings
spoke of her particular experiences as an activist. She described her
own role in successfully lobbying the American Psychiatric
Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.
She recounted her difficulty recruiting a gay psychiatrist to speak on
an APA panel on the topic. She finally found one who was willing to
speak, on the condition that he be allowed to wear a wig and plastic
mask and use a voice-distorting microphone, all to hide his identity.
After the APA did remove homosexuality from its list of mental diseases in 1973, the Philadelphia Bulletin ran the headline,
"Homosexuals gain instant cure."
Gittings' activist resume reads like a timeline of the gay and lesbian
movement. She founded the first east-coast chapter of the first known
lesbian organization in the United States, the Daughters of Bilitis, in
1958. Gittings also edited the organization's national magazine, The
Ladder, from 1960 to 1963 and marched in the first gay rights picket
lines in the mid-1960s in front of the White House and the Pentagon in
Washington, D.C. and Independence Hall in Philadelphia.
Gittings was also a charter member of the boards of directors of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, founded in 1973, and the Gay
Rights National Lobby, founded in 1976. From 1971 to 1986, she headed
the Gay Task Force of the American Library Association and edited its
"Gay Bibliography" and other gay reading lists.
Despite the tremendous accomplishments of the past half-century,
Gittings emphasized that the movement is far from realizing its goals,
and that today's fight for equal treatment is not just a legal and political one. but a struggle "that has to be won in people's hearts and minds,
where it matters."

Students question class on holidays

As a Jew living in a non-Jewish society, I

appreciate

Members of the Swarthmore community
have recently been questioning the college's
policy on holding classes during religious
holidays. While most people seem to agree
that canceling classes would be impractical,
several people said the school should establish a stronger policy on allowing students
to miss class during religious observances.
The college tries to accommodate those
celebrating religious holidays as best as it
can, Dean of the College Bob Gross said. He
explained there is no official policy on students' absence during the Jewish High Holy
Days, which occurred in the last two weeks.
Instead, the administration sends out a
letter, instructing professors to "make
allowances" for the Jewish students who
may need to miss classes. Some students,
however, do not feel that this enough.
Justin Singer 'O3, an observant Jew,
missed his Tuesday and Thursday classes
twice in two weeks due to Rosh Hashanah
and Yom Kippur. "It's very hard to make
up for missed lecture by getting the notes
or speaking to the professor," he said. "The
bottom line is that the school needs to
change their policy and give us these two
days off. It's really not that big of an issue."
Students find that it is difficult to really
appreciate the deeper meanings of the Holy
Days when one knows that classes are in
session. "It's really hard to miss classes,
and it's hard to reflect when you're in the
middle of this academic rush," Lauren
Appel 'O4 said.
Gross maintained that it would be
impractical to cancel classes on these days.
"There are about 250 Jewish students at
Swarthmore out of a total of 1,350," he said.
"Only a percentage of those are observant.

totalaccommodation for me," he said.
"Since we have exams before
Christmas, things are quite compressed,
and we have a 13-week schedule as it is. I
think people would find that adding
rescheduled days to that schedule would
make it even more difficult," he said.
He also pointed out that some students
had concerns with attending classes on
national holidays like

schools open on the holidays. Many schools
within the State University of New York
system, however, cancel class on the
Jewish High Holy Days. At Brandeis,
another such institution, the office of the
registrar has an official policy stating that
students are "encouraged to observe their
religious holy days" and that the professors

"facilitate this by allowing absence from
classes ... and by trying to ensure that there
are no mandatory class assignments scheduled on such holy days."
Many students feel the school should
adopt a policy along these lines. "There
could be a more detailed letter or an official

policy outlining these circumstances,"
Morse said. "I believe that with an official
policy, more students would comfortable

Alcohol woes?
It seems to happen every year: an incident involving
alcohol makes the deans nervous, then the deans ask students to change protocol. Last year, the Deans' Advisory
Committee asked Student Council to revise the all-campus
party funding system. This year, the pressure is on for
Party Associates (PAs) to check for partygoers' age at the
door. But one thing doesn't change when it comes to alcohol the system by which Swat students are treated, and
for the most part, act, like the responsible adults that they
are.
On the surface it might seem as though the college
wants to crack down on underage drinking on campus. But
the administration isn't against drinking at parties
the
powers that be know, as do students, that at any age, drinking alone or drinking and driving are much more dangerous than a few too many at a DU party could ever be. As
Dean Bob Gross said this week, "I and every dean I know
would prefer that the drinking age were 18, so we could
more effectively control the monitoring of alcohol on cam-

pus."
But, he continued, "it's not, so we have to make accom-

modations."
And that's the rub. Somehow, students and deans have
to work out an arrangement that protects everyone: the colfrom legal action, and partygoers
lege and its students
from physical harm.
People will drink, regardless of their age, and PA strategies must be focused on these implicit goals. With diligence
in checking for Tri-Co IDs, we can keep people who
shouldn't be in campus parties out, a major source of problems this semester and last. PAs and those throwing parties
must also be vigilant about keeping students from walking
this is
around outside with open containers of alcohol
what sparked the raid of DU's Margaritaville bash several
years back, and is what gets students cited by Swarthmore
police when they are on campus during the weekend.
Finally, deans and PAs must concentrate on assisting
those who are dangerously intoxicated to their rooms or to
the health center.
In our opinion, Swarthmore students are, in general,
very responsible when it comes to drinking. Students and
administrators should strive to maintain the open atmosphere needed to keep this the case.

Class matters
On the whole, the college makes an effort to accommodate student needs. Recent efforts to step up safety measures and women's resources, the firm establishment of
paid cultural and religious advisers and the present effort
to hire a Dean of Multicultural Affairs speak to the student body's expectation that the college respect their
needs and, usually, the college's willingness to respond.
But the Jewish holidays are a recent example of what
some consider an unsympathetic holiday schedule on the
part of the college, one that leaves some students feeling
isolated and under pressure. This trend extends beyond
religious days
the fall semester began on Labor Day, and
spring classes will start on the birthday of Dr. Martin
Luther King.
Most of the faculty does make a point of accommodating
the needs of Jewish students. They do not penalize them
for their absences on holidays, they give extensions, sometimes they reschedule class. But other professors threaten
students with lower grades if they choose religious services over class, or put pressure on them to make up work in
a short amount of time. Some count absences no matter
what the reason.
Much of the commitment to respect students' religious
practices falls on professors, but lines
of communication
need to open on both sides.
Students who are unhappy having to attend class on a holiday should take responsibility
to make early arrangements for their absences and speak
with the professor to revise their work schedule.
The college is under no obligation to cancel class in an
environment where most students are not practicing
Jews and where many of them would be unable to go
home for a couple of days anyway. But the administration
should recommend more strongly to faculty that they
accommodate Jewish students' needs, and students
should be made aware that the college, if not their individual professors, supports them in their celebration.

No online voting,
less open positions
caused low turnout
Dear Editor:
We are concerned that last week's article,
"Perennially low turnout marks SC elections" may have
misrepresented recent voting trends on campus. The
article claimed that an "increase in apathy" has marked
recent Student Council elections. It cited a voter
turnout of 605 students for the September election for
Campus Life Representative (the actual count was 618),
noting the drop in voting since last December's election

In last December's election, students had the opportunity to
vote online, while this past election they did not have this
opportunity.
the article failed to note that
five positions were being filled in last December's election, while only one position was being filled in the
(682 votes cast). However,

recent special election.
Moreover, in last December's election, students had
the opportunity to vote online, while this past election
they did not have this opportunity. Obviously, people
are more likely to vote when more than one voting
medium is offered and when a large number of council
positions are open. In our minds, this slight dip in
turnout shows no indication of increasing student apathy, but rather a good effort on the part of the student
body to vote even in special elections for only one seat

on Student Council.
Of course, we encourage every Swarthmore student
to vote in elections. Given the limitations of time, space
and voting medium, and the trend of less-than-optimal
voter participation in elections of any type nationwide,
Student Council is generally pleased at the number of
Swarthmore students who currently participate in campus-wide elections.

APOLOGY
In last week's issue, The Phoenix published a
sidebar called "The diabolical origins of ML," which
recounted the history of Mary Lyon as it related to
Swarthmore. Among the sources used in writing the
article were "The informal History of Swarthmore" (a
book by Richard Walton) and a web page from Mt
Holyoke about Mary Lyon, but it principally drew
from an article researched and written by David
Bing 'O3 and published on his Web site. The article
failed to mention where the information came from,
and therefore constituted an act of plagiarism,
albeit unintentional. Because of this, The Phoenix
would like to offer our sincere apology to David
Bing, the authors of the other sources and our readers.
In order to prevent incidents like this from occurring in the future, The Phoenix is taking a number of
measures. First, Seth Sias, the author of the article,
will be suspended from writing for the rest of the
semester. In addition, he will head up an organizational effort to research and compose a document
outlining the rules and ethics of journalistic reporting and writing, which will serve to govern the newsgathering activities of The Phoenix. As an institution,
The Phoenix will continue to make every effort to
ensure that its articles are free of error and its
sources are attributed correctly.

Sexless in Swaziland
The king of Swaziland, a small, AIDS-inflicted African
nation, has offered, in the form of a national decree, a proposal for reducing the incidence of HIV in his country. It
goes something like this: L Young women are not to have sex
for the next five years. 2. They will wear a bundle of tassles
on their heads to remind young men of this. 3. If young men
ignore the tassles and have sex with the young women anyway, they will be fined a cow. 4. Furthermore, young women
can no longer wear pants. A New York Times article from
Sept. 29, "African King's Controversal Measure to Fight
AIDS," that reported the new edict was entirely objective
and offered no response to or evaluation of the quality of the
decision. The intent of this article is to pick up where the
reporter, for the sake of good journalism, impartially left off:
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Seriously, let's
break the injunction down point-by-point:
To prevent further infection of a population already 25
percent infected, young women are prohibited from engaging in sexual activity for the next five years. Okay, yeah.
There's a good thought behind it. If there's a law prohibiting a certain behavior, it's probably less likely that people
will engage in that behavior, for fear of the decreed consequences. Unless, of course, you count underage alcohol
consumption in the United States, which seems to be largely bolstered by the fact that there's a law against it, causing kids to drink for the intrigue of law violation. Or the
sodomy law in Montana that is entirely unenforceable. I
guess if people weren't having sex, HIV wouldn't be

and people will continue to infect
others and become infected with

spreading quite as rapidly, so I guess there's some logic to
this, but the likelihood of people retracting their existing
sexual behavior is pretty slim. People will have sex, illegal
or not, and people will continue to infect others and
become infected with AIDS, unless provided with the educational resources necessary to prevent high-risk behavior. And why just women? Men spread HIV, too, and not
just to women. Even if, by some outrageous miracle
(because that's about what it would take for a crack-pot
plan of this sort to work) all the young women in the
nation adhered to the edict and stopped having sex, HIV
would continue to be spread sexually without violation of
the law. If the king wants to be thorough with his no-sex
policy, he should have made it applicable to all parties, not
just the female sector.
Young women are to crown their heads with a bunch of
tassles, signifying their celibacy and warding off potential

suitors. Give me a break. Tassles on their heads? Too bad
the cranium isn't generally the site of sexual intercourse. If
he was going to go that far, he might as well have ordered
all females to wear chastity belts, at least then they'd have
the semblance of a connected effect.
Young men in violation of the decree with be fined a cow
per violation. Okay, I guess. But how will they be caught?
Will sex-stopping officials be placed in every location remotely conducive to engaging in sexual acts? Hardly likely.
Young women must no longer wear pants. I guess this
part of the decree was only added to illustrate the king's
desire to return to traditional, cultural customs, to a preHIV world.
On balance, I have to reiterate that this is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard. I understand the need for a policy
and I fully comprehend the urgency with which he hopes to
slow the spread of HIV in his country, but enacting this policy is not the way to go about it. Passing out condoms and
pamphlets, though not entirely foolproof, either, would be
a much more realistic measure. Seems to me the Swazi
king needs to get out of fantasyland and contact a sexual
health counselor.

Student responds to DC protests
Despite involvement of unrelated issues, rally ultimately a success
Dear Editor:
I consider myself an experienced protester. I remember my first
the April 16, 1999 demonstration in
Washington, D.C. against the IMF and World Bank. The
experience invigorated me; I found myself, for the first
time, surrounded by thousands upon thousands of folks
who shared my values, principles and ideals. I stepped
off the bus at the end of the weekend grimy, exhausted,
wide-eyed, a changed person. The events of Sept. 29
were somewhat less compelling, yet worthwhile

nonetheless.
1 had waffled about
going. It had been a while
since my last protest and I
felt disillusioned with the
violent faction of the antiglobalization movement. I
worried about the threat of

counter-demonstrators.

Eventually my penchant

for the anti-war cause won

own issues. A few speakers stood up, briefly mentioned
the need for peace, then proceeded to say "Free
Mumia!" or talk about gay and lesbian solidarity
issues which merit attention, but which relate only
vaguely to the peace movement. By the time the march

started, I was antsy and irritable.
The march was more satisfying, a somber, powerful
procession from Freedom Plaza to the Capitol building.
There is something intensely emotional in the harmony
of thousands of voices rising in chant: "one, two, three,
four; we don't want your racist war! Five, six, seven,
eight; we will not cooperate!"
B^^^—
And in the face of angry counterprotesters and cold, armored
police, I felt incredible unity
with my fellow marchers. But
then we reached the end of the
march, and the next series of
speakers began, and people
began to leave, abandoning their
signs and puppets. Finally, our
group left too, and the trip came
to a close.
I am trying to make sense of
the day. If someone asked me what I thought the rally
and march accomplished, I would not know what to say.
Will it dissuade President Bush from bombing
Afghanistan? Probably not. Yet I am still glad I went. I
think it was a necessary event, just in that it will be
publicized in national papers and on national television, letting President Bush know his country does not
unanimously support his actions.
If the march did nothing more than raise some
awareness about the minority of dissenting voices, and
about peaceful alternatives, I say it succeeded. Granted,
the peace activists lack complete unificationand organization, but that comes with time, with the next march,
and the next. And it is always better to do something
than nothing.

Pro-war speech advocated bigotry
BY KARIMA WILSON
Last Thursday, I went to the speech "The Moral
Imperative of Self-Defense." Dr. Jeremy Rubenstein,
whose accomplishments include the Cliffs Notes to two
Ayn Rand novels, spoke vehemently about why not only
should we "nuke the nihilistic bastards," referring to
what he defined as Islamic militant terrorists, but why
we should have done so long ago to the governments of
Iraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and Sudan.

Rubenstein's entire argument was based on what he
described as the obvious distinction between Western

civilization and the values of reason, individualism,
separation of church and state, etc. and these terror
states based upon Islam, faith, selflessness, etc. Thus,
he argued, true understanding
of Islamic terror states whose
leaders value such things as

icize a speech based on the philosophy of objectivism

Rubenstein's argument was philosophical is like saying
that one must have read Hegel to understand the movie
"Clueless." The argument's basis was his assertion of
the fundamental differences between those "terror
states" and Western civilization. His words were a sheet
and a burning cross away from a KKK rally.
Rubenstein is not an expert in the Middle East or
Islam; I doubt he has ever attempted to understand the
teachings of the Holy Koran or the diverse cultures represented in the Middle East. His ability to link the
extremism of a minority of people from "Arab culture"
with the inherent inferiority of the culture and the
region itself is beyond defense. Following the same logic

Identity crisis: choosing a comfortable face
Senior explores different facets of personality in light of last year as full-fledged college student
BY YEHONATHAN BRODSKI
I got a motorcycle this summer because I wanted to try
on a new personality; I thought it would bring out my
rough and rugged side. Then I wanted to "get the white
out," so I followed my friend Thai to hip hop class.
I really liked Thai: we both worked at Barney's and I
thought that he was the only coworker without a stick up
his ass. I should have known there was a clash in our personalities when I invited him to a friend's birthday and
he wanted to leave before she opened her presents.
My friends are all different, of course. Friends are a lot
like clothes or motorcycles or hip hop if you think about
it we hold on to them because they bring out some part
of ourselves. Each friend evokes a different identity, yet
having them all as friends makes perfect sense to us. God
forbid all our friends ever had to share the same room for

sixty minutes.
This semester, I came back to Swarthmore wanting to
befriend a different set of people. Actually, I came back to
school with a specific experiment in mind. Maybe it's just
the sentimentality that accompanies senior year: my
other friends all think I'm crazy. This year, I wanted to
become the typical college student. You know, Mr.

Abercombie and Fitch or the beach MTV kid who wears
baseball caps and drinks beer. In some ways, I feel like
it's the identity I've missed out on: I never went to a college party before this semester, and I've never been anybody's all-American. But there's just a decision we make
in choosing which of our faces we're comfortable showing.

It's not that we reinvent ourselves; we each have so

many sides to us already. Given a certain freedom, we
explore. We speak a certain way in class and use a different rhetoric with friends. And with each friend we're

After we'd hung up, it hit me: maybe this whole college

ourselves in our texts and that others find comfort elsewhere. I've been pretty fortunate to meet the academic

Checks and balances protect civil rights
DAVID HAENDLER
The Price of Liberty
Historically, America has not been particularly good at
guarding its civil liberties during times of war. Recall, for
example,

John Adams' Alien and Sedition Acts, Lincoln's

suspension of habeas corpus, FDR's internment of
Japanese-Americans, or the McCarthy campaign during
our struggle against Soviet Russia.
That's what makes the current situation so frightening.
War doesn't just threaten our lives, it threatens our way of
life. Almost as soon as the Twin Towers had crumbled,
rumors of an ugly anti-Muslim backlash were spreading
and commentators were warning us that we were going to
have to give up a lot of the liberty we had taken for granted.
There was even some talk of a national ID card floating
around. Identification papers are something people had to
show the Germans in old war movies, not something we
should be forced to carry around in the land of the free and

the home of the brave.
Fortunately, it seems like American democracy may
finally have advanced to the point where armed conflict can
coexist with individual rights and legal equality. Despite
some early warning signs, most of our elected officials have
resisted the temptation to repeat past errors.
From the very beginning, the government has been careful not to associate American Muslims with the terrorists.
Congress moved immediately to pass a bill condemning bigotry against Muslims, Arabs and South Asians. Bush incorporated praise for Islamic culture into his excellent address
to the nation. The Civil Rights Division at the Department
of Justice announced plans to oppose Sept. 11-related discrimination. Americans of Near Eastern descent might
have to deal with a few bigoted yahoos and long waits at the
airport, but it seems that institutionalized wartime racism

sive powers of the government. I'm not positive that the
Bush administration understands that.
The anti-terrorism package that Ashcroft submitted to
Congress had a lot of sensible measures in it. And I can't get
too angry at the administration for being overzealous at a
time like this. But it doesn't change the fact that they produced a troubling piece of legislation. The first draft of the
Mobilization Against Terrorism Act included these gems:
The INS would be allowed to indefinitely detain any
alien who is deemed "a threat to national security." I
thought that the whole reason we had a judicial system was
precisely to prevent that sort of tomfoolery.

Government investigators would be able to access school
records currently protected by privacy laws, even if the case

they were investigating had nothing to do with terrorism.
This isn't a major concern, but I still sort of wonder why
Uncle Sam needs to know my GPA.
American law enforcement agencies could use information gathered by foreign governments, even if the method in
which that information was gathered would violate the
Fourth Amendment. This one's my particular favorite. I
wonder if we can get around that pesky Constitutional protection of flag burning by having Spetsnaz make the collar?
Thank goodness for a system of checks and balances!
Congressmen from both parties have jumped on the Bush
package over the past few days and begun the process of
eliminating or neutering its more offensive provisions.
There's nothing inherently virtuous about bipartisanship
I think it's actually kind of creepy to see Bob Barr and
Maxine Waters working together
but it's good to know
that liberals and conservatives can agree on the need to prevent Big Brotherism.
It would be nice if they could get an acceptable anti-terrorism bill signed into law quickly. There are doubtless
more al-Qaeda cells in America, and the sooner we can root
them out, the better off we'll be. But legislation this significant deserves rigorous debate and contemplation. The fact
that our representatives are choosing the unpopular, deliberative route rather than just jumping on the "get tough on
terrorists" bandwagon is a very hopeful sign.
Civil liberties are never completely secure. And until the
much-awaited day when Osama bin Laden and his backers
are turned into turban-wearing puddles, many of the rights
we enjoy right now are at a heightened state ofrisk. But if
the current actions of our Congressional leaders are any
indication of how they're going to behave as the war progresses, I'd say that we're in pretty good shape.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Be cautious near SEPTA
Dear Editor:

Swarthmore is fortunate to have a convenient public
transportation link in the SEPTA commuter rail liift
Along with the convenience comes responsibility. There
are measures people should take to make sure that they
are safe in the vicinity of the tracks. I recently contacted
SEPTA for information regarding safety around train
stations, tracks, and railroad crossings. According to one
pamphlet, in 1997, 461 people were killed and 1,540 seriously injured in accidents at railroad grade crossings.
Additionally, more than 500 people were killed while
walking on railroad tracks.
Recently a person was stopped from walking on the
tracks while using them as a pedestrian walkway from
Swarthmore to Morton. We have also had several
instances of skateboarders using the SEPTA platform
and tracks. These are extremely dangerous practices.
A train can come on any track, from either direction,
at any time. Even if the engineer sees a person on the
tracks and acts immediately, disaster is imminent. A
passenger train going only 15 miles per hour requires 380
feet to stop, a distance longer than a football field. The
same train traveling 55 miles per hour will take 1,200 feet
to come to a halt as opposed to a car that can stop in
approximately 130 feet.

The $230 million man
Navy-colored blazers. Polished shoes. Red power
ties. Such is the fashion sense of John Malcolm. Meet
him for the first time, and you may confuse him for
your local congressional representative.
Probably no one at Swarthmore looks, talks and acts the part of a

politician better than Malcolm, the college's newly hired director of

development. He is confident but not overwhelming, his slick, 6-foot
plus frame letting you know who is in control. He is articulate yet
often vague: he uses all the right words, speaking of "marrying infra-

structure to mission" and "engaging constituents on a regional
basis," and manages to skirt the question nonetheless. He will be
professional and be your friend at the same time, because that is his
job. John Malcolm is the head of fund raising for the billion-dollar
non-profit corporation that is Swarthmore. And he very much wants
to shake your hand.
As the new director of development, Malcolm has been thrown to the helm of the
college's largest capital campaign ever
a drive to raise $230 million over seven
years. The campaign will not only boost the endowment by $lOO million but also
fund several building projects (including the new science center renovations), support financial aid and found departments for Islamic studies and film and media
studies. With the two-year silent phase of the campaign over and $lOO million
already raised, Malcolm has a clear goal: raise the remaining $l3O million in five
years.
The campaign has become a rallying point for a large swath of the
college's staff. The office of public relations and alumni development, headed by Vice President Dan West, employs nearly 60
staff members and has a yearly budget of $3.5 million for the
duration of the campaign. Whether it be tracking gift
records, applying for grants, writing press releases or contacting alumni, nearly everyone under West is involved
with the campaign in some way or another.
For Malcolm and the development staff, the $230 mil-

Ipt^

lion goal of the campaign is only part of the job. The other goals, Malcolm says, are
to bring together his staff and create a sustainable and long-term fund raising program. "My hope is to build a mature program that will allow us to be very aggressive about fund raising, regardless of the campaign," he says.
But as Malcolm notes, fund raising is never an end in itself; he sees financial success as underwriting academic success and prestige. Without the money, he says,
Swarthmore would suffer greatly.
"A college's capacity for excellence is tied in a reflexive way to its fiscal
strength," he said. That excellence takes on meaning for all who hold a Swarthmore
degree.

"The fact of the campaign," says Malcolm, "is the insurance that a Swarthmore
degree will continue to mean a great deal in the broader world."
For Malcolm and the rest of development, the mission of the college is intimately tied to raising money. Being aggressive, say development leaders, is all part of the
game in today's increasingly competitive fund-raising world.
Annual giving, according to director Pat Laws, uses a combination of mailings
and phone-a-thons to reach the widest possible range of donors. Her office, which
solicits unrestricted gifts of up to $lOO,OOO, is responsible for buoying the college's
yearly spending. This past year, the office raised $3.5 million for the college's $9O
million budget about four percent.
According to Laws, her office does a great service to the students of the college.
"There is what we like to call a hidden scholarship there for every student," she
said. "The annual fund alone provides over $2,600 per student that would either be
added to your tuition bill, or you'd get $2,600 less education in any given year."
In capital and planned giving, the higher stakes demand intense donor courting.
Swarthmore follows an industry-standard five-step process. After identifying possible donors, the offices identify their particular interests. Only then does negotiation begin. If a donor is interested in science, says Director of
Planned Giving Ted Mills, he or she might want to support a summer undergraduate research position by giving $lOO,OOO. To support a new faculty position, a donor might be persuaded to
give $2 million. Often, IRS-approved strategies are used to
maximize the size of the gift while giving donors tax
breaks.

Then, once the gift is given, says Mills, the last step can
begin: "the thanking and planning for the next gift."
Fund raising hasn't always been so aggressive, say
staff. According to Director of News and Information Tom
Krattenmaker, the 1986 launch of the last capital campaign "was basically a dinner in the field house with
some bunting put up and some speeches. And that's how
fund raising was done."
"Historically, Swarthmore was laid-back in its fund
raising," said Laws. Development staff see two reasons
for this trend. First, Swarthmore's Quaker heritage often
conflicts with messages about fund raising. "The college
has been subtlety apologetic in some ways about fund
raising," notes Krattenmaker, "and some alumni have
come to expect it."
Second, Swarthmore has had in its recent history a
dependence on the "megammm
donors," particularly Eugene

naive. "Swarthmore has a hard time dealing with the concept of money and wealth," he says. "Some here tend to
think of wealth as bad. Wealth: bad. Oppressed people:

good."
Malcolm thinks that student cynicism about fund raising may be attributed to their lack of knowledge about
the way the college survives financially. "As soon as they
graduate they become alumni of this place, and the future

of Swarthmore is very much on their shoulders,"

Malcolm says of students.
In a more philosophical light, development sees its job
as forging what may be lost or forgotten connections to
the college. "You don't think, 'l'm trying to get 500 grand
from this person,' says Mills. "You think, 'l'm trying to
bring this person very close to the college, to the point
where it's the natural thing to give.'
Why give to Swarthmore? According to Mills, it usually doesn't matter that there are needier causes out there.

students, staff, administration and alumni each have a
stake in the school. "It takes a consensus among all of
these groups that they're going to share ownership of this
place," he says.
Ironically enough, if anyone in development embodies
Swarthmore's social values and its mission, it would be
John Malcolm. As an undergraduate at Williams College
in the 1980s, Malcolm was a left-leaning activist heavily
involved in the divestiture movement. He spent time at
Williams studying Quakerism and, after graduating,
moved to Seattle and joined Washington Fair Share, a
political action group. There he learned fund raising and
staff development.
He came to Swarthmore, he says, in large part because
of a robust financial aid program and other commitments
to social equality. In Swarthmore, he sees a long-term
training ground for socially conscious thinkers; that, he
says, is something not every college offers.
Fund raising at Swarthmore, he says, isn't so much a
business position in his mind as a continuation of the
activism that he has always embraced in one form or
another. Behind the navy suit, the power tie, the business-like attitude and the political talk, Malcolm sees in
his position the chance to execute a socially valuable mission on behalf of the college.
"I really believe in the power of philanthropy to effect
social change," he says. "If I didn't believe this work was
instrumental, primarily, in effecting a social impact, I
wouldn't be doing this work."

Intimate, creepy exhibit studies subtle

Two Figures with a Cat, 1972
oil on canvas, 14 x 13 inches, private collection

Leland Bell's paintings will be on display in the List Gallery through Oct. 28.

BY JOEL BLECHER
If you think that a trip to see great artwork means a trip to Philadelphia, think again.
The List Gallery, which you probably walk by on your way to class and might not have
even noticed, is showing an exhibit of works by Leland Ball, a great, though under-appreciated, French modernist painter.
Although some may criticize the gallery's lack of space
the List is literally nestled
under a stairwell in LPAC compact size also affords the luxury of focus. With sixteen
self-portraits and thirteen variations on "Two Figures with a Cat," this exhibit seeks to concentrate on subtle variations of an image, instead of grappling with the artist's work comprehensively.
In the front gallery, Bell paints and repaints a distressing and haunting image of two
nude figures arguing in a bedroom. In the corner of that bedroom a cat innocently stands
by a dead bird, and the moment,
unsettling as it may be, is exciting and full of movement.
Ihe gallery surrounds the viewer with different perspectives of an image; the changes in
nght, color, line, and shape transform the emotional expression of each composition.
The
works, instead of mimicking one other, powerfully converse in fascinating ways.
Stepping inside the rear gallery, the viewer is confronted by thirty-plus eyes, each from
one of Bell's self-portraits. Though admirably done,
the portraits may give one a creepy
reeling. There is something compellingly grotesque about
these portraits; his wrinkles
iorm deep grooves in his face, describing the fragile
skeleton
beneath. His face gives an
expression of infinite pain, moments away from
weeping.
All in all, though the show may not be a cheerful one, it's more than worth the short
trip.

Just to Distract You

Unleash your inner drama queen
The question that seniors hear most often is "so, what are you going to do after
you graduate?" Of course the question comes in a variety of patterns and styles,
for example, "What will you be doing this time next year?", "Made any plans yet?",
or, my brother's favorite, "So, how's that job search coming along?" Sometimes it
takes the slightly more benign form of, "I'm not trying to pressure you, but have
you thought about what you're going to do when I'm no longer paying the bills?" If
you have heard this question so many times that the nauseating feeling it induces
is now a permanent fixture in your stomach, you and I are in the same boat. Well,
not to worry. It is this very feeling that provided me with the inspiration for this article.
Finding job opportunities in the arts can be a harrowing task if you don't know
where to look. As in many other fields, internships are the best way to open doors,
gain direct experience, and find out about job openings that may not be advertised. If you are interested in working in live theater, Philadelphia has a plethora of
options that are easily accessible. From puppetry to children's theater, from musicals to opera, theater companies in the Philadelphia area have internships and
fellowships that will make the job search that much easier. Here are a few that I
found.
The Wilma Theater: Established in 1973, the Wilma Theater is one of the most
prominent in Philadelphia. The theater has a reputation for presenting both mainstream and avante-garde pieces. Their upcoming season, for example, includes
"Les Liaisons Dangereuses" (Dangerous Liaisons), centered around a wager
between the rich and beautiful Marquise de Merteuil and her misogynistic former
lover, the Vicomte de Valmont; and "Indian Ink," about a 1930's love affair in India
between an English poet and a widowed Indian painter. The Wilma offers two job
opportunities for recent college graduates. Their internship program is unpaid, but
it can provide one with invaluable experiences in a variety of fields, ranging from
marketing to public relations to graphic design. Internship positions are available
year-round, and applications are accepted on a rolling basis. If getting paid seems
like a more attractive option, the Wilma also has a fellowship program in which fellows are paid $250 per week and receive free health insurance. There are three
different types of fellowships available: artistic, which includes assistant directing,
casting, research, and post-show discussions; production, which includes set construction and painting, electrics and lighting, and building maintenance; and stage
management, which means serving on running crew, maintaining the studio, costume, and prop inventory, cataloguing scripts and prompt books, and conducting
technical research. For more information on either program, contact Deborah
Braak, Education Director, The Wilma Theater, 265 S. Broad Street, Philadelphia,
PA, 19107, FAX:215.893.0895, email: info@wilmatheater.org.
The Arden Theater: Established in 1988, the Arden is also one of the major
theaters in Philadelphia. Their fall season this year demonstrates their capacity for
producing a wide variety of theater pieces, including a musical called "Baby Case,"
about the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping, and a dramatic theater piece called
"Closer," recommended for adult audiences only. The Arden has a paid apprentice
program at $275 per week that includes health insurance, free theater tickets,
acting classes, and Equity Membership Candidate credit (Equity is the big stage
actor's union that most young actors would sell a kidney to join). The program
promises to provide experience in artistic direction, production, marketing, stage
management, and finance. Sound interesting? Send your resume, cover letter, two
letters of recommendation, and a one-page essay about your future theater plans
to APA Coordinator, Arden Theatre Company, 40 N. 2nd Street, Philadelphia, PA
19106, FAX: 215.922.70U, email: jobs@ardentheatre.org.
The Mum Puppettheatre: Definitely a little differentfrom the Arden and Wilma
theaters, the Mum Puppettheatre, founded in 1985, is exactly what the name
describes, a puppet theater. With a cast of puppets that range from finger-size to
Big Bird, the theater performs locally and nation-wide, presenting two original
works per season, as well as classic pieces such as "The Velveteen Rabbit" and
"Equus" (both are part of their fall line-up). While the internships are unpaid, the
experience gained is compensation enough. Positions are available in the following areas: Assistant to Managing Director (duties include maintaining data bases,
creating schedules, and assisting in the basic duties of operation the theater),
Assistant to Artistic Director (duties include everything from making masks and
puppets to grant writing), Assistant to Education Director (which means coordinating outreach programs, mainly for children ages 3-17), Marketing Assistant (which
means dealing with press releases and advertising), and Audience Services (this
person helps to plan opening night events, school events, posters, and window
displays). For more information, contact Duncan Busser, Managing Director, Mum
Puppettheatre, 115 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106, email:
internships@mumpuppet.org.
To finish off, I have two pieces of advice:
1) Don't forget to look at the other theaters that I didn't get to in this article:
The Academy of the Vocal Arts (www.avaopera.com), The Philadelphia Theater
Company (www.phillytheatreco.com), The Prince Music Theater (www.princemusictheater.org), and The Painted Bride Art Center (www.paintedbride.org).
2) Don't worry if you have had minimal or no experience in theater. Most of
these places are looking for well-rounded individuals who are willing to work hard
and have had some office experience (yes, McCabe counts).

Rittenhouse Square:
small-town Europe in Philly
Have you ever had the urge to explore a quaint little town in the
style of Paris or London without ever leaving the country?
Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square exudes that good old-country
feeling. Named after David Rittenhouse (the first director of the
Franklin Mint) in 1825, Rittenhouse Square features beautiful and
quaint residential townhouses with stoop gardens abounding with
flowers and other lovely plants, wrought-iron banisters and tiny bricklined alleyways. Enjoy the early October weather and take a stroll in
this neighborhood.

THE SCOOP
Although this may sound like a boring idea, it isn't. Take advantage of the nice weather, buy some lunch and eat it in the park. With
a variety of cafes, delicatessens and other restaurants, you won't
have trouble finding something to eat. The corner of 20th and Locust
Streets is home to a number of food shops. The small delicatessen
on the south side of Locust Street that serves Italian specialties is
particularly nice. Breads, sauces, imported cheeses, deli salads,
entrees and sandwiches, pre-packaged pizzas, pestos and pastas all
abound. Take some time to look around and examine the wares, and
make sure to get a little sample up at the register (during my visit,
they were serving the Italian hoagie). The people behind the counter
are friendly and courteous. I paid $5.75 for a smoked mozzarella,
artichoke and red pepper sandwich. If you prefer, you can also get
pizza, Chinese food, foot-long heros, and hey, if you're not willing to
be so fancy, there's even that good ol' Pennsylvania staple, WaWa.
After you buy lunch, or eat lunch, mosey on over to Rittenhouse
Square. Sure, it may be reminiscent of any other pleasant city park,
but there are plenty of benches and room to sit, read, relax and just
take in the sun. On the northwest corner of the square is the Church
of the Holy Trinity. The center of the square features a small kiosk, a
fountain and a few statues. Want some good reading material? Pick
up a magazine or a book at Barnes Noble, located on Walnut
Street. Stay in the Square awhile, enjoy the interesting architecture
and marvel at the characters who walk by.
The southeast corner of the Square is home to the The Curtis
School of Music. This school has produced such music greats as
Leonard Bernstein and Gian Carlo Menotti. The Curtis School continues this fine tradtion by giving free student recitals open to the public during the school year (usually from October through early May).
No tickets are required, but seating is awarded on a first-come, firstserve basis. Recitals are given on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
evenings. The first scheduled recital is Oct. 15. Call the student
recital hotline to check and find out about upcoming events.
If you happen upon Delancey Place, which is just south of
Rittenhouse Square, walk to number 2019. Pearl S. Buck, author of
"The Good Earth," lived here. Admire the lovely townhouses and if
you feel at the spur of the moment, that you need a haircut, take
advantage of Ovations Salon's 20th Street location and $2O firsttime customer special of shampoo, cut and blow-dry. The salon is a
fusion of Victorian decor with a modern spunk to it; techno-like
smooth jazz flows from the mysteriously hidden speakers. The service is decent I was tended to right away when I arrived. A haircut
need not be the only reason to visit; you can get a massage and purchase various products for hair, nails, skin and face. It's a small little
salon, however, and if you want to "bourgeois-it," expect fairly steep

Didion's relentless
pessimism a bit tiring
RACHEL BEST

'_^_

When I agreed to review books this semester, I
thought I'd be reading novels and trying to find a
balance between being too pretentious and not pretentious enough. However, my first assignment was

JoanDidion's latest book, "Political Fictions," a collection of political essays from the "New York
Review of Books" written between 1988 and 2000. I'm
reasonably well informed about American politics,
but I'm certainly no expert, and so I was apprehensive about the prospect of critiquing Didion's analysis. It turns out that in Didion's view, zero knowledge base is a plus. She prides herself on being an
outsider rather than one of the media insiders who
are the moviemakers ofAmerican politics.
Didion's eight essays are loosely connected, each
revealing her disdain for a particular aspect of
American politics. Her indictments of the theatricality of the Reagan presidency, the idiocy of Newt
Gingrich and the contradictions of compassionate
conservatism are caustic, but genuinely insightful.
She is extremely effective when she takes aim at the
media, taking on Bob Woodward in "Political
Pornography" and ridiculing the self-righteousness
of the coverage of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in
"Clinton Agonistes." Throughout all the essays,
Didion's glib, clever prose
style highlights her scorn

for American

politics

when white male property owners ran the country,
was the division between the political elite and the
majority of Americans any narrower?
Didion's scorn for elitism might also be turned
back on its source: despite her avowed populism,
she seems to be pandering to elite readers. Her
humorous look at Newt Gingrich can hardly be
expected to reach anyone who is politically uninformed; instead, it's a satisfying read for an upperclass liberal looking for cocktail party conversation.
She praises Jerry Brown for blowing off the elite by
skipping a Convention gala. Instead, he spent the
evening at Elaine's, a hangout for rich Manhattan
liberals
hardly the bedrock of the proletariat.
Didion's essays seem to be aimed solely at people
who share her background, economic status and
political assumptions; her own smug superiority is
hardly different from that of the elite class she

scorns.

Didion does not sully herself with proposals for
reform, and never takes the risk of identifying a
politician or political idea as mostly satisfactory.
Her relentless pessimism is very effective in the
bleak novels that made her famous and in short
articles. However, when the articles are combined
in a full-length book, her tireless faultfinding
becomes a bit wearying.

Irish novelist offers lyrical prose
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
An audience immersed itself in the biting humor, family quarrels and church-based power of
a reading by prominent novelist John McGahern, whom former
Russian professor Thompson Bradley said could "without any sentimentality, evoke empathy for
all his characters."
Local residents, faculty, staff and some students filled the Scheuer Room last Thursday night to
hear McGahern read from several works, including the novel "That They May Face the Rising
Sun." From this, his newest work, McGahern described an Easter morning, "when the bells rang
out for mass, the tones trembling in the water," a celebration he described as peculiar because it
combined the rising of Christ with a movement for Irish independence, the Easter Rousing of 1916.
"There were no misters' in this part of the world," he read, "nothing but broken-hearted gentlemen."
McGahern, who also read at Swarthmore in 1995, told the audiencehe draws a fine line between
what he considers good and bad writing. "There's very little difference," he said. "The very greatest writing is often close to bad writing." Reciting from the prose of Thomas Hardy, McGahern
seemed to delight in his conviction that "Hardy comes within a whisker of being bad writing."
The novelist, whom Bradley said is on the national high school curriculum in Ireland, elevated the importance of the reader in making a literary work whole, describing his novels as mere
"suggestions" that remain unfinished until completed by the reader. A new work emerges with
each person who takes it in, he said, because "no two readings are alike."
"A book is nothing until it finds readers," he said. "There will be as many good books as good
reads that they find, because each person will read in their own, private way."
Ireland banned McGahern's novel "The Dark" from 1966 to 1970 for its treatment of sex and
Catholicism, but he said his view on his audience and his writing 'tiidn't change at all" as a result.
20th-century rural Ireland during

"We thought it was nonsense," he said. Although prominent playwright Samuel Beckett hoped
to organize a protest against the censorship of "The Dark" when it was first implemented,
McGahern opposed the idea, and the censorship passed without much ado.
"To make any protest of any sort would have given it too much honor," McGahern said.
McGahern, whose "Collected Stories" came out in 1993, described the short story as "an explosion" in contrast to the totality of a novel.
"You have to imagine what happened before the story started and what happened after," he
said. In this sense, "the short story is much closer to the poem and the drama than the novel."
As far as the role ofinstruction in creative writing, McGahern said it "can't be taught, but people can be helped," through correction on elements such as grammar and rhythm. The main tool
for learning to write well, he said, is "reading other writers. "The reader and the writer are solitary people," he said. "Writing is a solitary act."
As for his own growth as a writer, "the writer is the worst person to ask that question," McGahernsaid.

'Don't Say a Word':
don't waste your time
BY ESTER BLOOM
Is there anything Michael Douglas can't do? Within the roughly two hours
of "Don't Say a Word" (or about twenty-five hours, in the movie) he makes
French toast with berries and powdered sugar, drives through a Thanksgiving
day parade, gives his wife a sponge bath, foils a kidnapping plot, saves his
daughter's life and exorcises the demons of a very troubled young woman, succeeding where twenty other psychiatrists had failed. Wow: if he were a Jew, I'd
have his children.
Unfortunately, Jewish men in these kinds of thrillers are never the folks
that get to be the Ideal Husband, Ideal Father of an Adorable Daughter, and
Ideal Hero. Those roles are reserved for the dignified, pure-white likes of Bruce
Willis, Harrison Ford and Arnold. Not to mention, of course, Douglas himself.
Douglas plays a top-notch child psychiatrist, Nathan Conrad, who, when he
is first seen, is persuading a Catholic schoolboy not to be ashamed of his natural sexuality. His subsequent journey home is interrupted by an emergency
summons by a colleague. He is needed at the hospital where a catatonic young
woman who sliced up a guy pretty badly has just been brought. No one understands what provoked her, and unless Conrad can ferret out her neuroses
quickly, she'll be sent to some hospital
upstate for the rest of her life.
The next day, the task gets accorded
more urgency. Conrad's Adorable
Daughter is kidnapped by Men With

Accents who demand that Conrad
return to the hospital and recover from
the patient's mind a six-digit number.
Burrows

caught up with Elizabeth's father in a subway station and killed him while
Elizabeth watched. Post-traumatic stress syndrome sent her over the edge: she
has been in and out of institutions ever since, faking everything from autism

to schizophrenia to avoid having to return to the real world alone.
Douglas only has to 5 p.m. that afternoon to get Elizabeth to trust him, to get
her guard down, and to get the number that corresponds to the location of the
diamond to give to the Men With Accents. If he does not come through, the kidnappers will kill his daughter. He appeals to Elizabeth for help, and Elizabeth
begins to thaw.
At the same time, a cop named Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito, who is to
Jennifer Lopez what Chris Tucker is to Chris Rock) is tracing a series of related murders. The most recent corpse, found floating in the river, turns out to be
the girlfriend of Douglas's colleague, Sachs (Oliver Piatt). She had been kidnapped by the same men who have Douglas's daughter, as an enticement for
Sacks to bring Douglas in to work with Elizabeth. Although the reason why the
kidnappers decided to kill the girlfriend, which wasn't in the agreement, is
never explained Sachs, when Confronted by Cassidy, repeats, "We have until
it reinforces the sense that these men are as cruel
5 p.m. It couldn't be her"
as they are singleminded.
Although the setup is pretty cool, as soon as the action starts, the movie
becomes laughable. Director Gary Fleder (responsible for 1989's "Tales of the
Crypt") pulls out all the stops, killing people with back-scratchers, trains, twoby-fours and dirt, in addition to plain old guns. And too many loose ends are
left dangling, like why Elizabeth nearly slaughtered the guy with a razor (that's
why she's in the hospital in the first place, remember?) or why her father made
the disasterous decision to abscond with the diamond.
On a more somber note, the movie, through no fault of its own, comes off as
ridiculously dated. It is set in a bustling, detached New York City that no
longer exists. During one scene, a character, with completely unintentional
irony, refers to something as "ground zero"; the entire audience winced. Never
has Hollywood seemed to exist in such a separate, fantasy world.

Schneiders (drummer Hilary and ringleader Robert), simple maroon pocket tees.
When we called ahead to find out about ticket availability, the operative at the TLA box office mocked us for
even considering that it might be wise to purchase tickets
in advance: who wants to see a bunch of no-name 60's rock
revivalists on a Wednesday night. Indeed, when we
strolled out onto the venue's concrete floor at about halfpast-eight, the crowd was sparse indeed. But varied: the
audience ranged from clusters of indies in light-weight
jackets and black skirts (one even had a skinny tie) to a
middle-aged Indian fellow with thick glasses and a Tone
Soul Evolution T-shirt who waddled up to the front of the
stage to a dancing cardboard robot. And by the time
Robert Schneider had finished fiddling with his "sixty-five
distortion pedals," the rest of the band had finished debating the best spot on the floor to stick the setlist, and the
Apples kicked into a little instrumental snippet by way of
introduction, the crowd was thick enough for Schneider to
remark ingenuously: "oh, you guys rule. Thanks so much
for coming to see us."
Robert (let's dispense with the formality) beams and
says "thanks so much, you guys" as though he were a kid
brother finally allowed to tag along with big brother and
friends, or a schoolyard nerd being let off easy by the
neighborhood bully. Beginning to bald and slightly
paunchy, with his neatly clipped bright red beard, he is at
once childlike and fatherly. Actually, he is a father: that
was obvious when he picked up his water bottle after the
first tune and mumbled something about a "drinky-poo."
When we talked to him after the show, he apologized that
he couldn't stay long enough for a more formal interview
because he had to get back home to his eight-month old.
(He did stick around long enough to show us a picture of
Max, and he promised to kiss him goodnight for us.)
Hilary looks similarly parental (she reminded me of my
high school health teacher.) She wears a perpetual grin,
and her Ringo-ish drumming doesn't get more complex
than the sixteenth-note hi-hat groove on the tune "Go."
That song is the opening track on their most recent,
most accomplished album, The Discovery of a World
Inside the Moone (Spin Art 2000.) Also their worst title, but
what do you want. They played five songs from that album
Wednesday, mixed in with older tunes from Tone Sou" and
a hefty dose of material that was unfamiliar to me.
Discover is a perfect encapsulation of their sound as captured on record: chunky strummed guitars with block
chord riffs, winsome melodies textured with shimmery
moogs and hammonds, punctuated with harps and tambourines, cheerful horns and chiming harpsichords.
Idyllic lyrics about rainbows, streams, golden afternoons,
bird singing in trees, and of course submarines. The
Beatlesque-ness is inescapable, as is the cartoon-like quality I mentioned earlier.
In live performance, the sound is a little different. Gone

is the psychedelic experimentalism of their brilliant minialbum Her Wallpaper Reverie. Gone is the plaintive balladry of tunes like "The Afternoon" from Discovery. The
cartoonishness is still there, but it's less Alvin and the
Chipmunks and more Josie and the Pussycats. Less
George Martin orchestral excess and more stripped-down
pop nuggets. Less twee and more noise. A lot more noise:
I was wearing earplugs, but the amps were cranked up so
loud that I could hardly tell. When I experimented with
removing the plugs, it was hard to distinguish between
chords. Most of the band members had earplugs as well
keyboardist Chris McDuffie, whose contributions were all
but drowned out, had bright orange ones but it was clear
that they weren't some bunch of staid tetragenarians.
They were there to rock.
And rock they did. Perhaps most of all when their
hour-and-a-half-plus set finished and they came back on
for an encore. Robert flashed us a peace sign and muttered
"shucks," and the band burst into a thrashing version of
the Beach Boys classic "Heroes and Villains." Not so coincidentally, perhaps, the Apples recorded that song for the
Saturday morning cartoon series the Powerpuff Girls, (as
guitarist Eric Allen told us afterwards, the show's producer just happened to be a fan of their music, so he called
them up, and the band ended up gaining significantly in
notoreity.) After thanking the opening acts, the venue, and
the cardboard robot from space that was in the crowd, the
ever-paternal Robert stood on stage and regarded his fans
adoringly. "I love you guys," he said. Just think how

WRC survey reveals fear of certain areas on campus
From SURVEY, pg. 6
The college allocates $25,000 for lightning improvements each year. But, according to Redgrave, that may not
be enough to cover this year's expenses. "We have more
work than $25,000 will cover" this year, he said.
A recent change to safety codes limits the college's
capacity to add electric lights in some areas without making major related changes.
The change may make it cheaper to install lights in

some areas than in others.
Also in the works is a plan to install more call boxes
around campus. "We've identified some areas for placing

telephones," said Goundie, a member of the college committee in charge of addressing safety concerns.
There are now external phones installed on Beardsley,
the field house, the service building below the Sharpies
tunnel, the south side of Sharpies and Sharpies 111.
There are plans to install two more boxes, one on each
side of the SEPTA tunnel, Redgrave said, though public
safety must obtain permission for the one on the ville side
from the train station building's owner first.
The college has also considered other safety improvements for the tunnels, including mirrors and security cameras. A mirror was installed on the borough side of the
SEPTA tunnel over the summer to allow pedestrians to see

around corners. Since then, the mirror has been broken
twice, according to Redgrave.
A proposal to install a security camera on the roof of
Mertz, Goundie said, was rejected due to reservations

expressed by Student Council.

"Students [were] concern[ed] that that would be an invasion of their privacy," he said. In addition, the college also
considered practical considerations, such as visibility and
inability to monitor the camera.
In order to address concern regarding off-campus
dormitories, the college has extended the shuttle's
hours of operation until 3 a.m. and contracted with a
professional driving company to provide the drivers,
Redgrave said.
In previous years, driving the shuttles was a job
available to students. The new shuttle program, however, has already seen two resignations.
"These are lousy hours," said Goundie. "It's not a fulltime job. Other things come up, [the drivers] leave."
Another concern brought up by the safety survey is stu-

dents' desire for better communication on the part of

public safety.
In particular, the survey focused on the specific public
safety bulletin that alerted the campus of an attempted rape
and aggravated indecent assault in February. Some respondents said they had no idea what "aggravated indecent
assault" meant.
According to the consolidated statutes of the
Pennsylvania District Court, it is defined as penetration of
the genitals or anus with a part of the attacker's body. The
crime last spring was classified as both.
One of the respondents to the survey said that public
safety needs to "make incidents sound serious if the incident is really serious."
Another woman said that public safety should be "specific, honest and quick."
Redgrave, who is typically the author of the bulletins,
said he frequently consults with the deans when writing
bulletins. He said that public safety is "always honest"
when issuing safety warnings. He also said that it is "not
always possible or prudent to give a lot of details."
There are multiple factors at work in the authoring
of bulletins, Goundie said. Public safety officers "are
always balancing: protecting victims' privacy, not
wanting to compromise the police investigation," he
said.

us more thoughtful."

The Garnet split Centennial Conference games to go 1-1 on the
week. On Saturday, Sept. 29, the Tide broke a nine-game conference
loosing streak with a 1-0 decision over Washington College. Forward
Jackie Kahn 'O4 scored the game-winner in the middle of the second
half. She was named to the Centennial Conference Weekly Honor Roll
for her efforts.
The Garnet had hoped to bring Saturday's momentum into yesterday's roadtrip to Ursinus, but the Bears proved to be too much for the
young squad. The Bears led 3-0 at halftime, but the Tide staged a late
rally with two Ele Forbes 'O5 goals, and Ursinus managed to hold on
for the conference win. Swarthmore is now 6-4 overall and 1-4 in the
conference. The team hosts pererennial powerhouse Johns Hopkins

In addition to using the meet as a forecasting measure for future
competition, team members also cite both a tough training regimen
and team dedication, even in the face of injury, as being key factors in
producing positive results in the Dickinson Invitational.

n

men's co-captain Don Nguyen 'O3, adding, "The men's team had two
injured guys running, and for two limping mofos, they did well."
The large scale meet also allowed runners to identify areas in
which improvement could result in a better conference finish than
last year's fourth place women's finish and men's sixth place posting.
"We need to work on running faster. This week the team begins
sharpening its tools, which means we work on speed," said Nguyen.
"Our team really learned how to work together because we started
to run in packs. We were able to really push each other that way,"
Gigone said, citing a strategy from the Dickinson Invitational.
Despite an average finish, runners emphasized the positive and the
value of running even if it didn't translate into a first place finish.
"[Sept. 29] really was a great day for running, for setting personal
records, and many of us did. The one eternal truth of distance running is that it hurts a lot. The guys on this team know that. In fact,
they relish it. It sounds unhealthy, but it's so worth it," said Makin.
The Tide hopes to take this attitude into its next meet on Oct. 6 at
Lehigh.

Men's soccer looks toward playoffs,
heads into heart of conference season

CENTENNIAL

Garnished Garnet
This week saw an end to two of Swarthmore's longrunning Centennial Conference losing streaks. The two
game winning goals were the first of the season for
both Garnet players. The sports gurus at the
Centennial Conference cited the Tide players for their
gallant goals.

The Tide faces tougher opponents in the next few weeks
BY DERRICK WU
After a come-from-behind victory against the Ursinus
Bears last Wednesday, the Garnet Tide came just short of
repeating their stirring performance against the
Dickinson Red Devils on Sept. 29. Co-captain Francisco
Sersale 'O2 summed up the outcome of the eventual 1-0
loss: "the goal that you don't score ends up getting scored
.

against you."
Despite the defeat, the men's team outplayed its conference opponent throughout the game. After maintaining possession of the ball throughout the first half, goalie
Nate Shupe 'O5 let up the only goal of the game with 43
seconds remaining in the first half.
"It was a loose ball in the box that Dickinson was just
able to slip in," said co-captain Cam MacDearmid 'O3.
In the second half, Shupe made two spectacular backto-back plays to keep the game close. After getting whistled for a collision in the penalty box, Shupe made a
great save off the resulting penalty kick. "I saw how he
approached the ball; when he leaned back to make the
kick, I dove to the left," said Shupe. After the initial save,
Shupe managed to get back up and deny the rebound as

well.
"Nate Shupe played a great game," said Sersale. "His
two saves in the second half gave the team an emotional
boost." The Tide almost capitalized two plays later, when
Brendan R. Moriarity 'O4 nearly scored off a corner kick
with a header.
For the remainder of the half, Swat continued to push
the ball upfield. Despite close calls from Marty Griffith
'O5 and Sersale, the team was unable to find the back of

the net. The tension climaxed with six seconds left in the
game when MacDearmid played a free kick into the
eighteen. With all 11 of their players packed into the
eighteen, Dickinson was able to squelch the Tide's lastditch attempt and hold onto their first win in the

Centennial Conference.
After the game, the team remained upbeat despite the
loss and a recent lack of goal production. Since racking
up 13 goals in a span of four games from Sept. 6-13, the
Tide has only managed to score three times in the past
five matches.
"I think some ofit has to do with playing better opponents," said MacDearmid, "but we also need to think
about maintaining possession, checking in and out, and
keeping the ball on the ground."
Defensive midfielder Steve Pater 'O5 agrees. "Marty
[Griffith] is getting double-teamed, so teams know we're
doing the same thing all season long. We need to switch
the ball more and stretch the team out."
Despite the offensive struggles, all of the players
agree that the team overall has been playing great.
Sersale, who's playing his fourth season of soccer at
Swarthmore, is excited that the team is still in the hunt
for the playoffs. "We've been unlucky," said Sersale, "but
we keep everything very positive."
The loss drops the Garnet Tide to 1-3 in conference
action. To recover in time for the playoffs, the team will
have to go against recent history and beat conference foe
Gettysburg (2-2 conference, 7-3 overall) this Saturday.
The Gettysburg Bullets have won all eight contests with
the Garnet since 1993, and the last six matches by

Centennial Conference losing streak. The tri-captain
fills a key roll in the Tide's
backfield, and has started all 11 games. The goal was
MacDearmid's first goal of the season. He now has
one goal and three assists so far this season

Earthworms split wins at U. Richmond tournament
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN AND NICOLE BRUNDA

The men's frisbee team, the Earthworms, won three
games out of six at a tournament at the University of
Richmond on Sept. 22 and 23.
The team is hoping for a shot at nationals in the spring,
and tournaments like these during the fall club season
serve as a proving ground, pitting Swarthmore frisbee
against some of the best collegiate and club teams in the
nation. Armed with a combination of fresh enthusiasm,
seasoned talent and wins against comparable teams, both
the Earthworms and the women's team, the Warmothers,
are making optimistic projections for the season.
The Earthworms earned a victory against American
University 13-9 in their first game. "Despite playing a little
flat, we managed to beat them fairly soundly," tri-captain
John Anderson 'O3 said.
The team continued well in their next game against
Bucknell, winning 13-12. Bucknell had defeated the
Earthworms earlier in the year at Penn State. "We were definitely planning on not letting that happen again,"
Anderson said. "They were ahead for most of the game it
was even 11-9 Bucknell at one point. However, the whole
Earthworms team came together and played as hard as we
could, striving for a one hundred percent offence and giving
every last bit of our energy on defense. We worked our way
back in, tied it up 12-12, and with some huge defense on the
last point, managed to get the disc and score. Everybody
was incredibly pumped and excited the whole game."
Playing Delaware, the Earthworms struggled and suffered a loss, 11-6.
Against North Carolina State, the top-ranked team in
the tournament, the men lost 13-8. "We traded points for
awhile, but couldn't quite stick with them the whole time.
We played well, but made some bad plays
resulting from
a very long day of Ultimate
that cost us the match,"
Anderson said.
Though Anderson said the Earthworms should have won
against Virginia, the team "came out flat" and lost, 13-7.
The Earthworms finished the tournament strongly,
with a 13-8 win over Salisbury State.
During the consolation game, however, antics on the
part of the Swat team landed the Richmond team in trouble. Several players from both teams took off their clothes
and played naked during a consolation game between Swat
and another school at the Richmond tournament, tri-captain Patrick Hagen 'O2 said. Then after the game, members
of both teams "got carried away and mooned the [U.
Richmond] women's lacrosse team" in a state of what
Hagen described as "jovial ignitability."
The women's lacrosse coach came over to the team and
informed them that she was not pleased with their actions.
The consequences for the U. Richmond team could be
severe. "Right now their practices, their travel, and their
competition have all been suspended and their funds have
been frozen," said Tom Roberts, director of campus recreation at U. Richmond.
The U. Richmond Sports Club Counsel, which consists of
a representative of each of the 25 club sports teams at the
school, will meet a week from Thursday to decide if and
when their frisbee team will be permitted to play again.
The Swat team apologized to the coach "immediately
after we found out the incident was not taken well," Hagen
said. The team drafted and sent a letter of apology as soon

as they arrived back at Swat.
"Anyone familiar with the spirit of club play at
Swarthmore College would realize that this is not necessarily unusual nor was it presented in a spirit of maliciousness or obscenity," Hagen said. "We're very sorry,
we won't do it again, and we're doing everything in our
power to clarify to the University of Richmond that their
Ultimate team was in no way responsible or related to
this event."

Goundie said he talked with a U. Richmond official
regarding the incident Monday afternoon. By his account,
the official mentioned he had been very pleased to get a letter of apology from the Frisbee team, basically within a
day of the events.
Goundie had said earlier that the team had "exercised
some bad judgment.
"I am willing to accept that part of it is the Frisbee culture, but it seems to me they went beyond that."
There has been no decision about possible conse-

quences for the Swat team. Goundie said the matter is currently being discussed. The Earthworms have lost all
transportation funding until the administration decides
what to do.
The next tournament for the Earthworms will occur in
Washington D.C. this Sunday.
The Earthworms are setting their sights on a first-ever
nationals berth, while the women's team hopes to head to

the nationals for the fourth time in a row.
"We have high hopes for the spring. I think I can say
pretty confidently that this spring is the Earthworms' best
chance of going to nationals, ever," Earthworms captain
Misha Horowitz 'O3 said.
Both teams hope that the commitment and talent of
underclassmen will strengthen their teams this year.
"We have more freshmen than ever in recent history
coming out to practice, which is pretty much the most
important thing to keeping a successful Ultimate team
going," Horowitz said.

FIELD HOCKEY
Women drop conference game
The field nockevteam suffered its second consecutive Centennial Conference loss against
Washington College on Oct. 2, bringing its record to 1-3 in the conference, 4-5 overall.
Swat was a favorite to win the game, having lead Washington 7-2 in series play and blankmg the Shorewomen the past two years in a row.
Meg Woodworth 'O3, assisted by Kim Cariello 'O2, got the Tide off to a promising start with
ner fourth goal of the season in the first two minutes of play.
Swat held the lead until the last ten minutes of the first half, when Washington pulled
even to a 1-1 tie at halftime.
The Tide was caught flatfooted at the start of the second half by a quick Washington goal
and it took the team time to regroup before Alison Gaffney
'O2 scored her first goal of the
season and brought Swat back into the game. Two minutes later,
however, Washington
cinched in an insurance goal that Swat was unable to answer.
The Shorewomen outshot the Tide two to one, taking 26 attempts compared to Swat's 13.
Swat goalie Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 made four saves during the game, while Katie Cloonan 'O3
made a defensive save. The Tide will host Dickinson Sat., Oct. 6.

The Sweet Spot

Men's soccer breaks conference
losing streak, falls to Red Devils

Barry Bonds,
run home alone
You have never been so excited in your life. You can't concentrate on schoolwork. You can't sleep. You can't eat. You
can only gnaw on your fingernails in profound anticipation
as you glue yourself to the television set. After all, Barry
Bonds, American hero, is chasing "history." He's about to
break a three-year-old record.
Bud Selig and his cronies in baseball management would
like to believe that this is an accurate image of the average
American baseball fan. And they have hyped Bonds' home
run chase since mid-June to try to stimulate such exhilaration. Unfortunately for baseball, no one is psyched about
Bonds. Selig and company have hyped the wrong record pur-

suit.

First of all, any three-year-old record just doesn't have the
same aura as one that has been unscathed for decades. In
1998, McGwire shattered one of the most historically steeped
records in sports. Ruth's record stood from 1927 to 1961 34
years. Maris' record stood from 1961 to 1998
37 years.
In over a century of baseball, only two players had seen

Sure, a player still must be great to
notch 60 homers; he just need not
be transcendent. The single-season
home run record has lost its aura.
the light of 60 homers, and only a handful more even dreamed
of 60. But then McGwire belted 70. And just three years later,
in 2001, Bonds is just another player posting another routine
60-plus home run season.
In the past four seasons, players have hit 60-plus five
times, and another one or two could reach 60 before season's
end.
Sure, a player still must be great to notch 60 homers; he
just need not be transcendent. The single-season home run
record has lost its aura.
Even worse, though, is that the home run itselfhas lost its
majesty. While batting averages plummet, homers skyrocket.
No current player would even dream of batting .380, let

a10ne.406.
Yet your average utility infielder could easily blast 25
dingers in a single season. Troy Glaus has belted 41 homers
while averaging .251 Richie Sexson has hit 40 while averaging .264. Corey Koskie, Torii Hunter, Cliff Floyd, and Bubba
Trammel are just some of the players thathave hit at least 25
this season. Household names? Certainly not. Above-average
players? Maybe.
Keep in mind that Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Frank
three of the most prolific home run hitters in
Robinson
baseball history averaged no more than 37 homers per season. And now Richie Sexson belts 40, perverting the current
significance ofBonds' record-chasing season with each blast.
So the good old boys that control baseball from behind
close doors have several tasks.
First, they must stop hyping Bonds' home run chase; they
can't fool anyone into believing that the chase is historically
significant, unless they expect fans to be excited when the
record is broken again in three years and again three years

after that.

Second, they should concentrate on the several other great
records that may fall this season. I might be excited about
Rickey Henderson's stab at Ty Cobb's career runs mark or
Randy Johnson's attempt to break Nolan Ryan's single-season strikeouts record ifI heard more about them.
Finally, Selig and friends need to stop juicing the baseball
and restore the magic to the home run, because it's no secret
that the ball is juiced when a player can average .250 and hit
40 homers.
Maybe then I would be more excited about baseball.

Cross country competitive

at Dickinson Invitational
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

Relying on promising performances by underclassmen, the men's and women's cross country teams posted
middle-of-the-pack results at the Dickinson Invitational
on Sept. 29. In their first large scale meet of the season,
both teams produced a seventh place finish, competing
against a field of 18 other men's teams and 14 other
women's teams.
"This was an important meet because it gives us a
sense of what the upcoming meets will be like," said
Maria-Elena Young 'O4. "Our performance this week is
part of building up strength and endurance for conference championships and regionals."
According to the team, the Dickinson Invitational is
essential as an indicator of future Centennial Conference
competition because it pits six men's and seven women's
conference teams against each other. Combined scores of
the men's 4K and 8K events, and the women's 4K and 6K
events yielded a conference finish of fourth for both
teams.
Contributing to this win were freshmen James
Golden 'O5 and Lang Reynolds 'O5 who recorded eigh-

teenth and thirty-first place finishes in the men's 4K
event and Garrett Ash 'O5 who placed twenty-seventh
among an 8K field of 200 runners.
On the women's side, underclassmen posted impressive times as well, with Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 running
6:26 to capture twentieth place in the 4K, and MariaElena Young 'O4 leading Swat women in the 6K to place
twenty-ninth overall in the 6K. Krista Gigone 'O4 and
Njideka Akunyili 'O4 also ran well enough in the 6K and
4K respectively to help determine a score dependent on
the top three finishers and top two displacers in each
race.
Perennial favorite Haverford captured the men's
crown claiming four of the first ten individual finishes
in the 4K event and two of the top ten in the 8K race.
Reigning conference champion Dickinson College
claimed first place in the women's races, accumulating
two of the top ten individualfinishes in both the 4K and
8K events. Dickinson, too, posted a second place men's
finish whileHaverford placed fourth of all teams and second among conference participants in the women's
