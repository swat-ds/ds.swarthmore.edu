College plans for telephone upgrade
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

ITS uses Whittier Place and Field House Lane housing for pilot run of digital system
ing, but It would go down along with the

BY PAUL GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM
pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

After 12 years of service, Swarthmore's
phone system is in need of a replacement.
The college is analyzing possibilities for
the future telephone network and is in the
process of testing a pilot program.
Now that the phone system needs an
upgrade, the college has to decide how to
replace the current system. As more students are using cell phones and calling
cards for long distance calls, the amount
of billing that colleges pays for long-distance calls has also gone down, Director
of Information Technology Services Judy
Downing said.
When the college chooses a new
system, it will use an all-digital product
known as IP telephony, or Voice Over IP.
VOIP uses the same kind of technology
that moves Internet data across the network to transmit voice calls across campus. It is the emerging standard for phone
systems in businesses and campuses
nationwide. Dartmouth has already transferred over to IP telephony.
The pilot program on campus also uses
IP telephony technology with a protocol
known known as Session Initialization
Protocol. SIP is the second generation
protocol of IP telephony.
This pilot program, being tested in
both One Whittier Place and 505 Field
House Lane, has "been very successful
with the students," Mark Dumic, manager
of networking and systems, said. Amanda
Cravens 'O4 said the phone has been working so far, but "it hasn't changed [my]

life."

In 505 Field House Lane, the phones
are also working, for the most part. "It's
been working fine," Adam Hunt 'O6 said.
But there have been problems for the
pilot telephone system: Rozina Ali 'O6 said
her phone service in One Whittier Place
had been out for over a week.
Previously, the service had been work-

Internet connection, and sometimes Ali's
phone would work when her roommate's
did not.
Another frustration students on the

pilot program expressed was not being
part of the voice recognition database.
Dumic was not surprised to hear of
problems with the system. "We did not
expect [the system] to be flawless," Dumic

said.

Swarthmore's campus phone system is
run through what is called a private
bridge exchange, known as PBX, which is
the gateway between Swarthmore*'s phone
network and the outside phone system.

The PBX is what makes it possible for
Swarthmore residents to simply dial four
digits and reach people on campus and
makes it necessary for users to dial 9
before placing outside calls.
Swarthmore's current PBX is a proprietary digital phone system, according to
Dumic. This system requires that every
user use the phones the college provided.
Under the current setup, the college has a
phone and voice mail service for all stu-

dents.

Several possibilities are open to the
college for the upgrade, but the actual
change for the student will be minimal.
One option available to ITS is to run the
SIP technology all the way to the student's room, which would require the
rooms to each have a special handset.
The other option is to run SIP only to
the basement of each building and have
regular phone lines run through the
building, which would allow students to

have their own phones as well as fax
machines.
. It is "hard to pin down prices," Dumic
said, but the new SIP handsets are expensive. "It's difficult to know what costs will
be two or three years in the future," he
added, so it is still possible that the school
will run a digital system throughout the
dorms.

Sue Chen Phdenix Staff

If the tests are successful, IP telephones will be installed in all campus housing.
"Swarthmore has not made any decisions yet, Downing said, regarding what
service to go with. She said the college
"

was watching the industry to ensure that
any possible problems with the new
phone technology would be "discovered
first in other colleges."
At some colleges, Downing said, phone
lines are no longer provided in students'
rooms. Instead, students are required to
use cell phones or pay phones. Other
options include discontinuing long-dis-

tance calls and using the phones exclusively for local calls as well as having
only one phone per room. Many options
exist, as the number of cell phones

increases on campuses nationwide.
Due to problems plaguing the network
on campus, focus on the IP telephony has
not been high, according to Downing, but
the college will continue to watch other
schools to see how well their efforts at the
IP technology succeed. "There will be no
surprises," she said.

No arrests in pizza assault Girl attacked in Ville
BY DEIRDRE CONNER

dconner2@swarthmore.edu

Police are no closer to making
arrests in the case of the assault last
month on a driver for Acapulco Pizza.
Though they had planned to arrest
two people last week, Swarthmore
Police Chief Brian Craig said it may
now be "a couple of weeks" before the
case is resolved, citing problems with

witness interrogation.
"We will be consulting with the district attorney's office sometime this
week," Craig said. "We have a strategy
we're looking at to try and tie down
some loose ends. We're not getting the
cooperation we've been expecting from
people we know were at the scene."
He would not comment further, calling the case "still an active investigation."
On Oct. 25 at around 3 a.m., a driver
for Acapulco delivered a pizza to a man
and two women in Parrish, according
to police reports. The man paid for the
pizza and included a tip, but, as the

THE PHOENIX

driver was returning to his car, the
man came back and demanded change,
police said. When the driver said he
had been told to keep it, the man hit
him in the face several times. The driver called 911, and Swarthmore police
and Public Safety arrived minutes
later.
The bill was $12.50, and the man had
given the driver $l6, the driver said. He
was not seriously injured but was

bleeding.
Last week, police said one male suspect will face charges of simple assault,

criminal mischief and disorderly conduct, and a female student will face
charges of assisting simple assault.
Craig said Tuesday that the charges
could also include attempted robbery.
"Whenever you're trying to take
something by force, that's robbery,"
Craig said. "I still don't know for sure
that they were students. It's an open

investigation."
Police will not release the names of
the suspects until the arrests have been
made.

Monday.

Around 10:15 a.m., the victim was walking to school on
Myers Avenue near the inter-,
section of Princeton Avenue,
when she was approached by

Police

Chief

Brian Craig said.
The passenger in the truck
asked for directions to the college, and when the girl, who is
14, came near the window, he
grabbed her and held a knife
to her neck, Craig said. When
he opened the door, she was
able to break free and run
away. She was unhurt except
for an abrasion on her neck.
The truck, described as an
older model, was riding low to

November 20, 2003

the ground, possibly because

of "construction material"
loaded in the back, Craig said.
However, searches of the borough's "dozens" of local con-

structions sites

including

renovations to the college and
Swarthmore-Rutledge School
have turned up nothing, he
said. Craig said the truck in
question did not carry the
Swarthmore emblem found
on all coUege-issue trucks.
The passenger of the truck
was described as a white man
with dark hair and a scruffy
beard, wearing sunglasses, a
blue plaid shirt and jeans. The
driver is described as a heavyset Hispanic man with dark
hair and wearing a dark T
shirt and jeans.
Myers
Avenue, where
many students have parking
spaces, runs along the train
tracks near the station.
Borough officials say 46 stu-

dents have permits.
Now some are wondering
whether to call Public Safety
for an escort to their cars. Ay
Jy Phoun 'O4 said she used to

walk alone or bike to her car.
"I never though of it as
being an unsafe place," she
said. "I'll probably get someone to go with me now."
Gross said the incident
was "the kind of thing you

don't expect to happen in
broad daylight. Because it is a
relatively safe area, people get
complacent.

When

these

things happen, it comes as a
huge shock."
So should anyone walking
around campus or in town
refuse to stop, even to give
directions?
"Answer those questions
from a safe distance," Craig
said. "To put yourself within
an arm's reach of someone is
easily avoided."

Seeking Mideast peace, agendas clash
In war of words, student groups dedicated to Israeli-Palestinian conflict battle through speakers
sponsored by the College Republicans, led by Randy
Goldstein 'O5. STIR brought Daniel Pipes, a pro-Israel
author, to speak last April.
Goldstein, one of the two founding members of STIR,
agreed that the speakers STIR has brought on campus have
been controversial but, he said, speakers like Pipes and
Klein furthered the groups' purpose to promote awareness
on campus from a pro-Israel perspective.
"We have a political ideology; we are a pro-Israel group
seeking to promote our view on campus. We hope any
activity will bring awareness on campus, and we value our
very one-sided discourse," Goldstein said.

houses are torn down with bulldozers, where soldiers walk
along the streets. It's a place where you do not get water or
electricity for days because of who you are.
This was Palestine for Saed Atshan 'O6, who described
his home in Ramallah under the control of the Israeli military.
"Most Palestenians are poor and living in refugee camps
surrounded by barbed wire, with thousands of people piled
up on top of each other," Atshan said, describing the situation in Israel and Palestine from his perspective. "In many
ways, it's like Nazi-occupied Europe, just withoutthe ovens

Tensions run high

Im Tirtzu, described by its leaders as "Swarthmore
Zionists for a two-state solution," is working to promote a
more moderate position, according to President Aviva
Aron-Dine 'O5.
"We are in the center and preserving a balanced perspective while we feel engulfed by a lot of students who
have very extreme views on either side," Aron-Dine said of
Im Tirtzu's ideology. "The commitments that we hold are
that we are pro-Israel; we believe in Israel's right to exist as
a Jewish state securely in the Middle East and we favor a

that's all we need. What they [the Israeli military] are
doing to us is an analogy of what happened to the Jews in

the Holocaust."
After coming to Swarthmore, Atshan, who believes the
root of the conflict in the Middle East is the occupation,
chose to join Students Against the Occupation, a campus
organization with a unified ideology against what it says is
Israel's occupation of Palestine. SATO wants to create
awareness on campus about its cause, what they call the
occupation in Palestine and why they think it is wrong,
Atshan said.

two-state solution."
Goldstein, however, did not agree that Im Tirtzu is the
kind of political group Aron-Dine described.
"Im Tirtzu is not a Zionist group. Im Tirtzu does very little for the cause of Israel. They function to bring awareness, but they don't have a political ideology. They are a
very much a moderate group, and their events are too varied, they are too cultural," Goldstein said.
Goldstein said STIR had tried working with Im Tirtzu to
bring Pipes to campus last year, but Im Tirtzu would only
consent to sponsoring the speaker if he agreed not to talk
about certain topics. But Aron-Dine said the group tries to
promote speakers that more closely align with Swarthmore
students' political orientation.
"We share with STIR a pro-Israel orientation, but we
have radically different ideas of how to advocate for Israel
on this campus," Aron-Dine said. "Im Tirtzu thinks that the
most effective way to advocate on this campus is to bring
speakers who share with the students general world views

"No, they are not actually
sitting down and talking, but
they are responding to each
other when they bring an Israeli
or Palestinian speaker."

sociology professor
Three groups promote divergent ideologies

SATO, however, is not the only group reaching out to the
Swarthmore community about the Israel and Palestine conflict. Im Tirtzu, a Zionist group on campus, and Students for

and general priorities and make them think about why you
should be supportive of Israel given that general world
view. STIR thinks it's more effective to bring speakers who
cause a lot of controversy, who come from a place totally
different than the average student."
Debbie Cohen 'O6, a member of both Im Tirtzu and
SATO, sees Im Tirtzu as a Zionist group but also said that
STIR was more of a right-wing conservative pro-Israel
group.
Nevertheless, she said, "Im Tirtzu and SATO fight about
what the word Zionism means. They can't get past that."
Aron-Dine said that, from her perspective, although
STIR and Im Tirtzu have different ideologies, Im Tirtzu can
relate more to STIR than it can to SATO. She said that Im
Tirtzu's and SATO's relationship with each other has greatly improved since last year, when the tension was much

Truthful Israel Representation, a recently founded Zionist

organization, have worked to promote pro-Israel views.
With divergent ideologies, differing opinions and disparate views about the situation in the Middle East, the
three groups have become involved in an escalating war of
words through the speakers they bring to campus.
SATO has tried to promote its ideology by booking
speakers such Ali Abuminah, a Middle East expert who
spoke on American media coverage of the conflict.
The group also recently brought three women, an Israeli
and two Palestinians, to talk about their experiences with

the conflict.
STIR brought Morton Klein to campus in October. Klein
sparked emotions during the lecture by making what
Atshan called "derogatory" remarks about Palestinians.
"One of the things [Klein] said was that the 200 million
Arabs of the world want to kill the Jews. That was one of
his statements. And last year STIR brought David
Horowitz, who said that Palestinians' [culture] was a sick
culture. They've definitely brought the most inflammatory," Atshan said.
Horowitz spoke on campus last December, but was in

that's a really good idea," Aron-Dine said. "It causes a lot
less tension when a Palestinian speaker talks about the
conflict through a Palestinian perspective. Last year, I felt
they deliberately sought out Jewish speakers who could
say they were anti-Israel."

"I think we hold different commitments; I don't think we'll change
each other's opinions."
Aviva Aron-Dine 'O5
Is dialogue futile?

With tensions unlikely to subside, none of the leaders of
the groups caUed for less heated debate. But Atshan and
Aron-Dine voiced plans for a new Jewish dialogue group on
campus to talk about the conflict.
"The Jewish dialogue group on campus will bring
together members of SATO and the Zionist group so all
Jewish students with different perspectives on the conflict
can come together," Atshan said.
SATO's relationship with STIR, however, does not seem
to be taking the same road to progress and dialogue.
Some, including Atshan and Cohen, said conflict
between STIR and SATO has remained high this year.
"I find them disgusting," Goldstein said of SATO.
According to Goldstein, SATO is promoting a solution that
will affect the lives of the Israelis in a negative way.
Likewise, leaders of SATO didn't mince words when
asked about STIR. "They are not about dialogue; they are
not about discourse. They're very dehumanizing towards
the Palestinians," Atshan said.
Lee Smithey, sociology professor and expert in peace
and conflict studies, said he did not find the lack of direct
dialogue between the groups "disastrous." .
"In one sense, they are communicating with each other
through these speakers that they are bringing in. No, they
are not actually sitting down and talking, but they are
responding to each other when they bring an Israeli or
Palestinian speaker. From what I gather, they want members of the other groups to be present at these events. That's
a kind of communication, and it should be built upon,"
Smithey said.
Leaders of SATO, Im Tirtzu and STIR all voiced the uselessness of a dialogue between the three groups, as it
would not improve the situation in Israel and Palestine or
at Swarthmore.
"In terms of dialogue, I don't see exactly what it would
accomplish," Aron-Dine said. "I think we hold different
commitments; I don't think we'll change each other's opinions. I think there's a place for dialogue if the goal of a dialogue is to make sure that we as groups can get along on
campus. I don't see any point of our dialogue being about
the Middle East peace conflict. We're not going to resolve
it among ourselves at Swarthmore."

IN MEMORIAM

Students mourn religious adviser

BY CATHERINE CLARK

cclark2@swarthmore.edu

Pauline Allen, the former Protestant campus advisor, died last Thursday, Nov. 13. She
had been diagnosed with breast cancer in
March of 2002.
Members of the Swarthmore community
were saddened to learn of Allen's death.
Pauline was, in the words of Allen Frost 'O4, "a
warm uplifting presence," someone filled with
"energy, love and, as a Quaker, a strong inner

always "asked the most profound and relevant
questions."
The answers she had found were personal,
and she would gladly share them, but she did
not let them preempt discussion or the mere

metaphor of a "lovely crystal held up to the

lightAllen had been the Protestant campus adviser since 1992. She took a leave of absence in the
spring of 2002 to start treatment for breast can-

cer.

Hired by the Partners in Ministry, an organization composed of local pastors, citizens and
a few Swarthmore professors, Allen's duties
were to oversee the Swarthmore Protestant
Community and act as a general religious advisor to Protestant students.
To many students, Allen became much more
than that. As Mark Wallace, religion professor
and member of Partners in Ministry said, she
became a "chaplain to the whole campus," a
resource to everyone regardless of their reli-

gious beliefs.

Allen dedicated herself to her job. She personally contacted every first-year who self-

identified as Christian in enrollment materials.
Yet everyone was welcome at SPC or in Allen's
office regardless of their religious beliefs.
Joshua Anderson 'O4 remembered a "Jewish
pagan" who had graduated but attended and
was welcome at SPC meetings anyway.
Many students describe Allen as a second
mother. She attended swim meets and concerts

Sara Posey 'O4 remembered her as "good
with knowing what small gifts to give people."
In her office, she always had hot tea served
from her personal collection of mugs, food, a
blanket and, since 2001, her dog, Molly.
According to those who knew her, Allen
strove to understand people and never judged

light from all sides.
Students who were close to Allen remem-

bered how she treated everyone with the same
undivided attention and genuine interest. She
started every meeting asking students for
weather reports, personal updates about their
schoolwork, activities, families, and friends. "A
simple 'fine' was never a sufficient answer,"
Nathan Shupe 'O5 said.
When Allen listened, Posey said, she was
"personally there. Having her full attention
made you feel important."
Always a reassuring presence on campus,
Allen opened up her services in greater ways
forming support groups
in the wake of Sept.
for students from New York and Washington,
D.C., as well as memorial services for the larger campus community. She made a safe space
for students to vent their fears, rage and sadness that transcended any religious barriers.
These support groups continued to meet for
months after the attacks, a testament to the
knack Allen had for making students like
Posey feel like "everything was going to be OK
no matter what difficulties" they encountered
in their lives.
The Willistown Friends Meeting in Newton
Square will host a memorial service for Allen

Paces sound system damaged at SQU party
Deans wait for confirmation from suspect and SQU before levying fines
BY CHRISTINA TEMES

ctemesl@swarthmore.edu
During the Swarthmore Queer Union's
Metamorphosis party on Oct. 25, the Paces

sound system sustained damage when a
student forcibly opened the back of the system's cabinet. The system's lock was also
broken.
In addition to the damage done to the
lock and the cabinet on Oct. 25, Student
Budget Manager Jeff Traczynski 'O4 said,
the students may have caused some damage to the electrical wiring.
A laptop connection wire was found at
the scene, leading Traczynski to conclude
that the damage to the electrical wiring
was caused by an attempt to plug a laptop
into the system, which cannot support
such a connection.
The extent of this damage is currently
unknown, but, Traczynski said a "work
order is pending."
Student Council Co-President Emiliano
Rodriguez 'O5 said the wiring issues may
not necessarily be a result of this incident,

and that, following the party, the circuit
breaker hooked to the sound system have

tripped.
SQU board member Brian Nolan 'O5
said that, at around 8:45 p.m. on the night
of the party, SQU members who were setting up for the party realized that they had
no key to get into the sound system.

After learning from a Paces director
that the only key to the cabinet was with a
student who was away for the evening,
SQU members decided that, "with $4OO of
SAC funding going into the night and it
being the only queer-safe and genderqueer-safe party," breaking the lock would
be the best solution. They did so "as unobtrusively as possible," Nolan said.
SQU e-mailed the Paces directors the

next day, saying they were willing to
account for the damage. Nolan also said
SQU was unsure of who was responsible
for opening the cabinet.
According to Traczynski, the damage to
the lock was fairly significant. "The lock
was cut off at the hasp...that whole device
is gone," he said. Also, in reference to the

problem with the key, Associate Dean for
Student Life Tedd Goundie said, "They

was considered responsible for the damage
but that the student had not met with him
yet and therefore no identifying information about him or her could be released.
In addition, "the Student Council, in
cooperation with the Dean's Office, is hoping to get an affidavit from individuals

The Pond offers lounge atmosphere
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
ldremeal@swarthmore.edu
They knew weekends at Swarthmore
needed more than Paces parties and frats,
and they wanted to help students meet peo-

ple without yelling over loud music. So
Carmen Barron 'O5 and Stephanie Rogan
'O6 decided to open The Pond, a new weekend hangout that held a preview night last
Saturday at the Women's Resource Center.

"Swat is removed from Philadelphia,"
Barron said. "The campus only offers
Madonna dance parties, frats and hanging
out in your room. There's really no venue
in which to socialize on a weekend night."
Barron said she and Rogan hoped The
Pond would offer students a chance to
socialize in a new context.
"We want the option of being social

somewhere at Swat where we're not surrounded by sweaty, gyrating people,"
Barron said.
Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie said
students had come to him over the summer

a venue with a "more
sophisticated atmosphere, where they
would have good food and good conversation and, unfortunately, serve drinks."

hoping to plan

Because alcoholic drinks could be available to students at The Pond, Goundie said,
the college could not help fund it. But he
expressed support for the new venture.

"We like controlled situations," Goundie
said. "We like it when alcohol is not the
focus of the event. I support the idea of it,
but I can't lend financial support."
Goundie said he had suggested The
Pond operate as a private party in a manner similar to Pub Nite, without funding
from the Social Affairs Committee. Hosts
will ask students to pay a $7 cover charge
at the door.

According to college, guidelines, nonSAC events are not permitted to advertise
with flyers, so Barron and Rogan will
invite students individually.
The pair has funded The Pond out of its

own pockets. "Stephanie and I hope that,

by the end of next semester, we'll have

recouped our money," Barron said. "It's
not a money-making enterprise."

WRC board member Shin Kim 'O4 said
The Pond would use the space once more
this semester, on Friday, Dec. 5. "Next
semester, we plan to have Pond in gear at
the WRC every Friday evening," she added.

Barron said the WRC was "supportive of
the idea of a female-friendly place. Paces
parties are fun, but too often girls leave
feeling in some way violated. Our goals and
the goals of the WRC are very much in line
in terms of what kind of social environment we want to add," she said.
Kim said The Pond was "a place where
people can hang out with their friends on
the weekends without having to go to a
Swarthmore party" arid "a safe and fun
space for both men and women, run by two
women."
Hosts will regulate the number of people
who enter. "We want people to be able to
hear each other talk," Barron said.
As for the lounge's moniker, Barron
said she couldn't provide a story. "We were
just kind of throwing around names that
made us feel relaxed, and it seemed like it
could match well with the mint-green walls
at the renovated WRC," she said.
"We just want people to feel that they
got their relaxation for the night at The
Pond."

Students debate black Alum laments loss
or Africana proposals of U.S. legitimacy
BY ELEANOR JOSEPH
ejosephl@s warthmore. edu
Many oflast Thursday's The Ring participants felt there should be a major in
black or Africana studies, but opinion differed on whether or not a separate department for black/Africana studies should be
created, and if so, what the major should

focus on.
Panelist Kristin Davis 'O6 plans to
minor in black studies but said that, given
the opportunity, she would major in it.
"There should definitely be a department for [black and Africana studies]

because it would ensure that a major
exists. It would provide better resources
and faculty and would add a lot to the
school, because it is clearly missing on
campus now," Davis said.
Other panelists were Matthew Wallaert

"I think what's most important is that
there's a major. The most conceivable
way for that to happen is that there's a
department. Even if it was a department,
most of the classes would be interdisciplinary or cross-listed, so really it's a technicality," Siduri Haslerig 'O7 said.
Haslerig is the co-chair ofRadical African
Dissent's subcommittee on black studies.
In addition to the topic of the creation

African-American culture through a
Eurocentric lens, which she said was not
satisfactory.

Wallaert, the third panelist, differentiated between "black" and "Africana" as
courses of study. "I think delineating an
entire department by a color takes more
steps back than steps forward," Wallaert
said. He advocated that students have the
opportunity to pursue a major in
Africana studies but not black studies.
"One key distinction I would make,
however, is that students should not be
able to focus solely on African-Americans
in an Africana major," Wallaert said.

"It used to be that, when the president of
the U.S. stood before the world, he was the
leader of the free world," Brady Kiesling '79,
former U.S. Political Counselor to Greece

said during his lecture last Thursday.

"This meant that, in times of crisis, the
rest of the world looked to the U.S. This is
not, unfortunately, any longer the case. Over
the last two years, we have done something
which made us lose our legitimacy as leader
of the free world," he said.
Kiesling, who resigned from his post
after he realized he could not support the
United States' invasion of Iraq, spoke about
how the current administration has lost the
power and respect of the United States in the
eyes of the world. He argued that legitimacy
derived from sound actions rather than military might.

studies would focus on the diaspora and on
the experience of African people throughout the world. It would be broader," Ring
member Celia Paris 'O5 said.

Although the Ring discussion was filled

with contentious issues, many students
believed the dialogue was productive.
"I thought it was really good to hear
people hammer out the distinctions, the
different policy options, what departmental would mean, to explore the different
focuses for such a department. It was good,
because we did have some people who
weren't in favor of [Africana and black
studies] becoming a department," Paris
said.
"Talking can be a very real step forward, and I'd encourage the people that
feel passionately that we should have a
department to propose it in a more public
manner, so that if there is community support, we can be sure that the current sys-

tem changes," Wallaert said.

few were critical of his overall point.
"The whole room was dead silent. I have
never seen anyone with such a quiet voice
command a crowd so completely," Paige
Gentry 'O7 said.
"He was very good, and although I didn't
always agree with him, he generally had the
right ideas and was very well informed and
penetrating," Patrick Hart 'O6, secretary of
the College Democrats, said. "I was glad to
see people from the community there, not
just the college."
Kiesling was critical of the United States'
relationship with Israel. "Israel and the U.S.
have a committed friendship, and similar
interests as states. However, Sharon's interests are in opposition to ours. We are paying
the cost for Sharon's government. Israel is
not an asset to the U.S. in terms of security,
but we are committed even if it is only a cost,
not a benefit," he said.

Kiesling also handled questions about

"Legitimacy is that aspect of a policeman
that, when he raises his hand, I stop my car
without wondering if he is going to shoot me
ifI drive through,"Kiesling said.
Some students disagreed with Kiesling's
standard of legitimacy. "I think that the war
in Iraq was a bad use of unilateralism, but if
the ends justify the means, we have to be
willing to be unilateral and exert that power.
Might does not make right, but might can
necessitate right," Bob Sterling 'O7 said.
When questioned about what ought to
happen next in Iraq, Kiesling responded that
his ideas were "not very pretty." He returned
to the concept of legitimacy, explaining that,
in the United States, the legitimacy of a
leader is based on elections. So many election results have been falsified in Iraq that it

the luxury of working for a government, an
ideal that went beyond parties." He
explained that he thought that "the U.S. is

Swarthmore's Internet woes top other universities'
BY GARTH SHELDON-COULSON
gsheldol@swarthmore.edu

Deluged with virus attacks and rampant
Internet file sharing, Swarthmore, like
many colleges, is struggling to keep its
campus network afloat. This semester, however, Swarthmore has had a rockier experience than many of its competitor schools.
Students at eight selective colleges and
universities reported that their campus
Internet connections have been highly reliable since the beginning of classes in
September. Only Dartmouth and Williams
have taken the step of suppressing filesharing programs such as KaZaA.

"I worry that this Issue has
been viewed through an
adversarial lens, which
isn't the true
'Swarthmore Way.'"
Judy Downing
ITS director
Swarthmore's network, by contrast, suffered spells of downtime in September and
October that lasted up to 36 hours on some
parts of campus. Students complained of
seminar papers "stuck in purgatory" and

music downloads taking "days."
After the network outages, which were
caused by Internet worms and file-sharing
traffic, Information Technology Services
began blocking file-sharing traffic in midOctober. The block will last "indefinitely,"
according to ITS.
Other colleges
and their students
have fared better.
"People here do use KaZaA Lite and
Arie. They aren't blocked," Yale first-year
Ted Fertik said, referring to two popular
music-sharing programs. "There have been
a couple of times this year when I couldn't
get online for five-minute periods. That's
it," he said.
This has been a particularly testing
semester for most college and university
network staff, said Phil Fitz, director of

Information Technology
at Amherst.
Amherst, however, "managed to get enough
of the viruses fixed, touch and go" to forestall severe network problems and blocks
on file sharing, he said.
The Massachusetts college, he added,
"lucked out."

Searching for solutions
But bad luck may not be the only reason
for Swarthmore's digital difficulties.
Until three weeks ago, Swarthmore's
network was connected to the Internet by a
10 Mbps connection. Amherst, by comparison, was operating a 21 Mbps line nearly
twice Swarthmore's bandwidth per student.
Now, Swarthmore's new 15 Mbps connection still remains
smaller than
Amherst's on a per-student basis.
Although Swarthmore's Board of
Managers recently reported that the college's technology budget was "middle-ofthe-road for its comparison group," according to ITS Director Judy Downing,
Swarthmore's total financial resources are

"Students here set up a Direct Connect

to
"Clytemnestra" at Friday's
theater symposium,
"Staging Aeschylus Today." Students and faculty gathered in the Scheuer Room at 1 p.m. to engage in active
discussion with renowned thinkers in the fields of classics and theater.
Organized by Edith Hall, Cornell visiting professor
in humanities, the symposium comprised two panel discussions, "Translating Persians" and "Performing
Agamemnon," and culminated in a workshop with Peter
Meineck, Hall's colleague and director with the Aquila
Theater Company, and Dukakis, who is currently collaborating with Meineck on an American adaptation of

"Agamemnon."
Discussion focused on recent restaging of "The
Persians" and of "Agamemnon," particularly around
gender politics, in order to render Greek tragedy more
accessible to modern audiences. "Since 1969, there have
been more revivals of Greek plays than ever before,"
theater professor Erin Mee said.

Hall said the movement "has to do with social reasons, political reasons [and] anti-war and civil rights
movements." She also cited appreciation of the aesthetics and ritual of Greek drama in the open-air theater.
Theater major Joy Mills 'O5 said she was "impressed
with the caliber of panelists present." Sitting next to
Dukakis, Mee and Meineck were theater department
chair Allen Kuharski; Helene Foley, professor of classics
at
Barnard
and

Scharffenberger, professor of classics at Columbia; and
Robert Auletta from the School of Visual Arts in New

"I've never seen a panel quite like this," Mills said,
noting in particular Dukakis's passion and "powerful
demeanor" as she and Meineck led the workshop discussion on their adaptation of "Agamemnon."
"I [also] loved having the classics professors there,
since they knew the literature cold and knew the historical context," Mills said.
Mills said that "theater studies at Swarthmore puts a
lot of emphasis on the theater-maker
the person who
can do everything as well as know all the theory."
Consequently, "Staging Aeschylus Today" fit well into
the agenda of the theater and classics departments.
"I am trying to put classics on the map," Hall said.
"Classics in its new millennium form." She called
Swarthmore "the ideal place" for such a project.

Students line up for naked run
Despite controversial past, Dash for Cash tradition continues
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

Despite a clash with the Eastern Pennsylvania
Rugby Union last year that nearly prevented the

rugby teams' biannual Dash for Cash from occurring, the tradition continued this fall on a technicality.
Women's rugby Co-President Aja Peters-Mason
'O4 said that by opening participation in the event to
the entire student body, the tradition of running
through the halls of Parrish without clothing was
no longer officially associated with the rugby
teams.

"We were really happy about the
turnout and the amount of
money raised."
Aja Peters-Mason 'O4
In addition to allowing any student on campus to
participate in the event, the fund-raiser's name was
also temporarily changed from Dash for Cash to
Cash for Dash, although men's rugby Co-Captain
Jon Fombonne 'O5 said the teams have since
changed the name back to Dash for Cash.

The Dash for Cash came under criticism by the
EPRU when now-retired religion professor Jerry
Frost wrote a letter, published in The Phoenix in
January 2002, in which he compared the Dash for

Cash to "soft porn."
After the letter was published, the Dash for Cash
received national publicity. In light of the attention
it was receiving, Peters-Mason said, the EPRU sent
a letter to the Swarthmore rugby teams telling them
that the EPRU did not want its name associated

with the Dash for Cash.
According to Fombonne, 20 students, including
two non-rugby team members, participated in the
run, earning $l3B for each team.
"We were really happy about the turnout and the
amount of money raised," Peters-Mason said.
"Although I think there may have been fewer people
in attendance this year, each person must have
given more money, because we've made about as
much as in other years."
Not all students in attendance were prepared for
the naked runners. Anya Carrasco 'O7 was walking
around Parrish Hall 10 minutes before the Dash for
Cash on Friday when she remembered what was
about to happen.
"I didn't know what to expect," Carrasco said.
"But I think it's just evidence of the fact that the
environment here is very open and that students
are comfortable expressing themselves in different
ways."

Students lined the halls of Parrish Friday to watch the Dash.

The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11paved the way
for the imposition of various homeland security
measures. One of these measures is the USA
Patriot Act, which was enacted to combat terrorism. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed the International Studies in Higher
Education Act.
According to the bill, H.R. 3077, the legislation
reauthorizes international and foreign language
studies programs under Title VI of the Higher
Education Act. Title VI of the Higher Education
Act provides support for a critically important
group of programs at colleges and universities
that work to advance knowledge of world regions,
encourage the study of foreign languages and
train Americans to have international expertise
and understanding to fulfill pressing national
security needs.
The International Studies in Higher
Education Act would update the programs under
Title VI to reflect national security needs in the

post-Sept. 11 era, as well as the current international climate.
Dan Ashlock, associate professor of mathematics, said H.R. 3077 will directly affect foreign
language and international studies departments
at lowa State if it is initiated as a law. He said proposals similar to H.R. 3077 have failed in the past.
"This has been tried twice before," Ashlock
said. "It was tried during the McCarthy era in the
'sos and before with President John Adams when
he passed the Alien and Sedition Acts."
Ashlock said one rationale for H.R. 3077 is the
lack of Arabic-speaking Americans available to
be translators and spies. He suggested teaching
foreign language in elementary schools as a way
to remedy the problem.
If the law is passed as a bill, one way for universities to reject the mandate is to refuse federal
funding, Ashlock said.
Steffen Schmidt, university professor of political science, said the bill stems from the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.
"The H.R. 3077 comes on the heels of the World
Trade Center attacks, so now there's this question
of whether we should be teaching students how to
become part of homeland security," Schmidt said.
"The effort is to make professors teach more what
the government considers to be positive values to
make them more patriotic."

Fourteen and a half hours of improv comedy

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

"Improv is the ship, and we are the captains guiding the
ship through a sea of spontaneity," Vertigo-go's Ethan
Ucker 'O7 declared. This Saturday, Swarthmore's premiere
improvisational comedy group Vertigo-go will present a

massive 14-and-a-half-hour improv marathon. The festivities are projected to begin at 6:37 p.m. in the CRC on the
second floor of Parrish and will continue non-stop until

9:07 Sunday morning.
The program will consist of a variety of game-oriented
improvisation as well as longer scenes with more developed characters. The event marks Vertigo-go's step from
its usual short-form improvisation toward free-form style.
"Free-form is all about the rawness," member Toby David
'O6 said. "Free-form is a story-based, structured, continuous animal," Ucker said in addition.
The "improv-a-thon" will be Vertigo-go's first attempt
at a show of such length. "Lulu [Miller 'os] brought in
the idea last year, because she heard Wesleyan had done
it," member Alex Kieft 'O6 said. Sam Dingman 'O4 added
that "this bun has been roasting in the oven for over a
year."

The group had various explanations for the show's 14and-a-half-hour length. "It's a salute to the printing press,
which was invented in 1453," member Joella Fink 'O7 said.
But David insisted the performance was to celebrate
Vertigo-go's birthday. "VGG has been in existence for 13.5
and one for good luck!" he said.
years
The nine-member group, which also includes Nicola
Wells 'O5, Neal Dandade 'O6 and Keefe Keeley 'O6, formed in
1990 with the intention of performing a cleaner style of
comedy. The group said it didn't "dwell in the gutters" and
...

preferred to keep things PG-13. But Dingman emphasized
that Vertigo-go is "violently anti-intellectual."
The group also prides itself on emphasizing group
work. "There's no star," Fink said. During this weekend's
performance, all eight members will be in constant attendance (though Miller is currently abroad). "Basically, it's a
kibbutz, and we're all workers on it," Ucker said.
Vertigo-go normally performs three shows a semester.

The members of last year's Vertigo-go pose in Sharpies. This year's troupe will host a 14-hour marathon on Saturday.
Its last show took place in the Science Center, which it
filled to capacity. The group encourages both old and new
fans to attend the performance, especially the first 60 to 90
minutes. "Help us to see the ship off," Kieft said. "And just
in case people are in doubt of our abilities to do this, they

are also invited to come see us in the morning." Vertigo-go
is especially looking for audience response to their new
free-form style and emhasizes that the performance will be
informal. "People are welcome to come and sleep over,"
Kieft said.

Movies that win at Sundance are some-

times revolutionary and sometimes
breathtaking. Most of the time, however,
the movies that win at Sundance are small,
quirky pictures that mainstream audi-

ences will never see.
"The Station Agent,"

which

at

Sundance scooped up the Audience Award,
Special Jury Prize (for Patricia Clarkson)
and Screenwriting Award (for Thomas
McCarthy) is, of course, a case in point.
Despite the praise lavished on it at the
famously high-brow indie film festival,
"The Station Agent" has gone the way of
other celebrated movies you've never
heard of: Slam (1998), Three Seasons (1999)
and Personal Velocity (2002).
Not all small, quirky, award-winning
films, however, are created equal. In the
case of "The Station Agent," obscurity
does not seem entirely unmerited.
Thomas McCarthy, the writer-director,
has created several interesting characters. Finn (Peter Dinklage), the film's
driving force, is a self-contained little
man who focuses on trains rather than
the outside world. When his only friend
dies and bequeaths Finn a plot of land in
Nowhere, N.J., Finn, on foot, suitcase in
hand, follows the train tracks until he
arrives.
There, Finn encounters the exuberant

10

addled Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who is
escaping a marriage gone sour after the

death of her son.
Finn, a dwarf who encounters unconcealed disgust or shock wherever he goes,
is naturally wary of people. The plot consists mainly of Joe and Olivia coaxing
Finn out of his shell.

The film could be worth
watching, despite the
unintentional dead ends
and red herrings, but a
nagging plausibility issue
haunts it as well.
Along the way, the three develop a distinctive, touching rapport. Joe's affability,
Olivia's desperation and Finn's dignity
mix to produce a softening and sophisticating effect on each.
The bourgeoning friendship is wellwritten and funny. But after a while it
demands other elements to prop it up.
There isn't enough conflict simply among
the three of them to carry a two hour
movie. If "The Station Agent" is the story

of one man's journey, that journey begins
and ends in New Jersey without even a
stopover in New York City for a change of
scene.
That journey also terminates abruptly,
without warning or logic. Just when
things seem to be gearing up for the third
the raising of the stakes, the final
act
conflict, the resolution, the denouement
the credits roll.
The film could be worth watching,
despite the unintentional dead ends and
red herrings, but a nagging plausibility
issue haunts it as well. People throughout
"The Station Agent" react as though they
have never encountered a little person
before: not on Seinfeld, not in Austin
Powers, not in everyday life.
Finn dresses, talks, and carries himself
in an effort to attract no attention; he only
asks to be left alone. The film prods him
with constant, unstinting rudeness from
children, supermarket employees, and, of
course, white guys in pickup trucks. In
doing so, it evokes sympathy for Finn, not
in a real life setting, but in an artificial,
exaggerated environment. Here the number of indignities a differently abled person could expect to encounter over the
course of his or her lifetime occur over the
span of a week.
Still, Peter Dinklage delivers an
admirable, beleaguered performance,
topped only by that of Patricia Clarkson.
Fresh from recently rescuing "Pieces of

November 20, 2003

April" from pointlessness, she throws herself into this role of mourning mother and
bourgeois self-exile. Her role invests "The
Station Agent" with significance. Of the
three awards "The Station Agent" received
at Sundance, hers is the most, perhaps
only, truly deserved.

Ariana: inconsistent Afghan cuisine
Ben says:
Here's a general tip for all of you: if
you're in need of a good, moderately priced
place to eat and want a lot of variety to
choose from, start poking around Old City.
Without a doubt, it's Philly's big restaurant
neighborhood, and big trendy places are
packed in tight next to dozens of small,
affordable restaurants. Of those, this week
we happened to pick Ariana, a small, family-run Afghan restaurant that caught our
attention during our "randomly-leafingthrough-Fodor's-and-Zagat" test. The RLTFAZ test has seldom led us astray in the
past since, by its nature, it weeds out the
restaurants other diners have already
panned. The one thing it doesn't allow for,
though, is inconsistency. There is some
wonderful, delicious food to be had at
Ariana. There are dishes that will make
you feel like the time you've spent hauling
your freezing carcass into Philly for dinner
was a small price to pay for the meal in
front of you. There are also, unfortunately,
a lot of pretty mediocre dishes on the
menu. Unless you know what you're in for,
ordering is a bit of a crapshoot.
Let's start with most consistently amazing dishes, the appetizers. The portions are
small, but most only cost $2.75, so don't be
shy about making double orders. The menu
boasts a large number of crispy, fried, veggie-filled turnovers, all members of the
Indian samosa family, which Sarah and I

devoured inside of three minutes. Also well
worth your time are steamed scallion
dumplings called aashak, served with a
meat sauce and spiced yogurt and mint,
which mix cool subtle flavors with a strong
piquant bite. They're available as an entree

too, and are really a standout dish. Side dishes are
priced similarly, and also
have some nice items. The
red lentils, and the pumpkin with yogurt are nice as
savory and sweet additions
to a meal respectively.
Again, they're served in
tiny portions, so go ahead
and order more.
Entrees (which run from
$9.25 to $l4) are a trickier

dishes
are served over plain rice,
which tended to be hard
and seemingly underdone.
One dish I tried consisted of
tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned eggplant, and slightly

first began writing this column. I was scroll-

ing through Fodor's, looking for promising
places to review, and right there at the top of
the alphabet was Ariana. "Afghan food?" I
thought. "There's Afghan
food in Philly?" My curiosity was piqued. There's nothing I love quite so much as
exploring a new cuisine, and
there's nothing I hate so
much as paying for it.

Ben and I prefer to visit

at least twice, if we can
to
do
afford
so.
Occasionally, this means
we get to sample even more

fantastic dishes than we did
the first time around.
Unfortunately, in this case
we just thoroughly proved
that Ariana is mediocre.
To be fair, there were some dishes I
enjoyed, like the bulanee gandana. This
appetizer consisted of two fried turnovers

filled with scallions, herbs, and spices.
When topped with yogurt, it was nothing
short of delicious. However, on our second
visit I ordered a noodle soup called aash,

was a traditional dish and
would be homemade. Imagine my surprise

assuming it

when I found the letters A, B, and X lurking
under the dollop of yogurt that garnished
the soup. Either someone at Ariana is trying to send me a coded message, or at least
one of the ingredients in this soup was
made by Campbell's.
The entrees I ordered, chalow sabzi and
chalow badenian, were both rather bland,

and the accompanying white rice was definitely undercooked. Chalow sabzi is essentially boiled spinach, and its major flaw is

that it tastes like boiled spinach. Of course,
there's nothing inherently wrong with
boiled spinach, but there isn't anything
inherently exciting about it either, especially an entree-sized portion of it. The
chalow badenian, a sauteed eggplant dish,
was pleasant but also rather dull. I did
enjoy Ben's doogh, an iced yogurt drink
that prompted me to make a series of

"Doogh, where's my
jokes, which
Ben informed me were Not Funny. This
from the man who, on entering the restaurant, quipped, "They have food in
Afghanistan?"
Generally speaking, Ben and I are not
cranky diners. We want to like the restaurants we try. However, places like Ariana
need to put more effort into their food
before they earn my seal of approval.
Ben and Sarah are seniors. E-mail them
at bmastenl and sstvincl@swarthmore.edu.

Ariana is at 134 Chestnut St, between 2nd St. and Front St. Reservations recommended. Call (215) 922-1535. No lunch on Sunday.

Danielle's lucky number, and so if we have nine reasons,
the plan is fool-proof. Victory is mine! No, mine! Mine!
Fine, can we share it? OK. Victory is ours!

Party on
It has come to our attention that the Swarthmore public
was disappointed with our last article. You have asked us,
"Where is the humor? The meanness? And, most important,
the Bryn Mawr bashing?" Well, people, we have heard your
voices. And since we write for the general public, we have
taken the poison pens out of retirement. We are back and
meaner than ever. Those of you without senses of humor, stop
reading now, as no one has been spared.
If Destiny's Child came to Swarthmore on a Saturday
night, they would have this to say: "Ladies, leave your men at
home, and fellas leave your girl with a friend, 'cause it's 11:30
and you all look like crap." Every weekend, we are excited, if
only temporarily, by the prospect of a good party. And each
weekend we are thoroughly disappointed.
Why, you ask? Because on Saturday nights you all,
unknowingly, commit fashion disasters so bad that even our
drunkenness can't excuse them (Caroline blacks out every
weekend and still knows that you were dressed badly). This

simply will not do.

First and foremost, we must say that Halloween is the only
time that such fashion atrocity is allowed, and that is only
if you are going dressed as
Christina Aguilera or Kid
Rock. Second, Sager is an
evening where no fashion

don'ts should be committed.

Fashion Fascists

You're not supposed to wear
anything at all. Perhaps we
will regret this advice later
on,
but hopefully we'll
already have blacked out by
then.
We're starting with the
ladies, because otherwise the
feminazis will whine yet
again about the inequality in
our patriarchal society. Our
advice to you is simply this:

mistaken for a Bryn
Mawr girl is never a compliment. It means one of two things.
First, that you are dressed sluttily and boys will be fighting to
accompany you home. Or, it means that you have been mistaken for a pseudo-intellectual lesbian. Either way, you're betBeing

ter than that.
Thus, ladies, we forbid bras disguised as tops. We are
appalled when your thong sneaks out of your low-rise jeans.
This is neither fashionable nor classy and probably not representative of your desire to be taken seriously. However, we
understand that nice clothes are not always appropriate at
parties, mainly because dry-clean-only and spilled Natty
Light do not mesh well. This does not mean go braless and
wear long hippie skirts. A modest halter top and jeans will
suffice. And please, comb your hair and check the mirror
before leaving to make sure that there are no moguls in your
ponytails. The only winter Olympic sport that will be taking
place is the ice luge at DU (on select weekends only).
Now gentlemen, it would be unfair to neglect you completely. That said, what are you boys thinking? You show up
at a party in a dirty hat, uncombed hair, a T-shirt and jeans
and you expect us to swoon? To leave with you? A Bryn Mawr
girl might, but not us. How would you like it if we females
showed up disheveled, looking like we hadn't showered in

weeks?

Along this line, one of the most horrific fashion crimes you
a Hawaiian shirt. We completely
understand the trend in Hawaii. But once you leave Honolulu,
can commit is wearing

you have no business taking its shirts along with you.
Wearing flowers on your shirt is not going to get any of you
deflowered.
Thus, we suggest some nice jeans (neither holey nor
smelly, long enough and not tapered in the legs) with a polo or
button-down shirt and a belt. You'll still be a casual beer-guzzling oaf. And we still wouldn't date you, but perhaps some
girl will be so blinded by the pulled-together nature of your
outfit that she'll forget your oafishness for the evening. Also,
since we expect that you will do anything to get laid, please
make sure that you pay attention to your attire beneath your
new nice pants. Should you get to the crucial moment, there
is nothing that will make us leave faster than holes and/or
without us,
skid marks on your boxers. But remember
you'd still be dressed like Kid Rock. And then even that Bryn
Mawr girl wouldn't be looking at your boxers at all.

Rhythm N Motion specializes in performance dance
of the African Diaspora. Styles include African dance,
influenced mostly by the Umfundalai technique, hiphop, jazz, dancehall, and Caribbean Latin styles. Their
dance is also influenced by the music videos of artists
such as Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, and Michael Jackson.
Anyone in the group can choreograph for the concert,
regardless of past experiences, so the pieces are-varied
in style and influence. "Our choreography is mostly a
fusion created inevitably from the different dance backgrounds, personal backgrounds, points of view, and
artistic expressions that our individual dancers bring to
the group," said Lee.
For the past few weeks, the dancers have been putting
in long hours at rehearsing their pieces and pulling
everything together, Poe said. "Everybody's focusing on
looking good and making their pieces look good
everyone takes it seriously," he said.
"The performance is really a culminating event, a
chance for the group to share what we've been creating
and working on all semester, as well as a chance to just
experience movement on a stage," said Lee. "It really
brings out the performer in each of us, allows the dancer
in each of us that craves and wants people to know how
much we love the movement and the rhythm to come to
life."
This upcoming concert will include seven original
Rhythm N Motion pieces and three guest performances.
The guest performances include dances choreographed

Poe 'O4 came up with the idea to put on a dance performance for the specs during Ride the Tide.
"I figured if people wanted to dance, why not get a
group together," he said. At the first audition, everyone
who showed an interest was accepted.
"It was not really so much an audition as it was the
introduction of a vision," said co-director Casey Lee 'O5.
"Most of us didn't have any dance or choreography
experience," said Poe. "We just had the passion." Three
weeks later, the newly-created group put on its first concert, featuring five Rhythm N Motion pieces and five
guest, performances. "The place was packed," said Lee.
The group has put on a concert every semester since
its inception, so Thursday's performance will be the
fourth. Said Poe, "What I love about it is watching people who've been in it since the beginning and how
they've grown; how the project has grown from the
beginning until now." The company has expanded from
the original 35 dancers to its present 41, and is run by an
executive board of seven students.
In addition to putting on a concert each semester,
Rhythm N Motion also sponsors workshops, which are
open to the entire campus, and supports a travel group,
directed by Poe, which performs in the area.
"The group also welcomes and likes to provide a
space for those inspired by related movements to put
their work on stage with us," said Lee.
Poe emphasizes the closeness of the group. "It's very
community-based," he said. "That's one of the things I
love about it."
'Til this day, RNM, above anything, is about a group
of people who love to dance," Lee said. "We're a group for styles are represented.

Surprising enterprises
Hubcap king, catering czars run successful businesses from dorm rooms
BY JOHN TUTHILL
jtuthill@swarthmore.edu
I found some people this week that have real skills
not merely a knack for writing essays or completing problem sets, but trades that are not taught on this campus.
And that is unique at Swarthmore, where we all study
and study but never learn about anything that my dad
would consider a realistic way of making a living.
Cooking up a

storm

Swarthmore's most talented culinary duo consists of
Ja'dell Davis 'O6 and Jordy Owen 'O6. This sharp-shooting
pair has a business of its own, catering and cooking for
various Swarthmore events.
When Owen and Davis became aware of each other's
and for their
talents, they began by cooking for fun
delighted friends. They received so many compliments
that they decided to offer their services to the greater
Swarthmore community. So they made fliers and took out
an ad in The Phoenix. With Sharpies, that esteemed culinary powerhuse, as their only competition, their skills
have been in high demand.
Davis is from Louisiana, and her cooking style reflects
her southern roots. Owen has a Caribbean background
and specializes in flavorful desserts.
Until now, Owen and Davis have used their profits to
purchase cooking utensils and accessories. Now that they
have grounded their business, they hope to turn a profit.
Once or twice a month, they tackle a project, spending a
great amount of time preparing the menu and purchasing
the necessary ingredients. They spend the night before
the event preparing, and then cook the day of the job so
the food is fresh out of the oven.
"This is something we like to do," Davis said, "so we
put a great amount of time and energy into it."
The enterprise is not only a small-scale business to
these thriving cooks. It is also a diversion and possibly a

mam

future career. They have fantasized about opening a

restaurant after college. But, for now, they are content to
provide catering services for events on campus.

ing with headlights on the high beams.
Lacey discovered areas of dense hubcap-tossing activity, especially alongside large frost heaves and bridge
joints. On a good day, he could pick up anywhere from 50
to 100 hubcaps to stack and order in neat rows in the basement.

Got a '92 Acura?
Andrew Lacey 'O5 is Swarthmore's own

thrifty hubcap

entrepreneur.
Since the age of 3, Lacey has been smitten with automobiles, and especially with those useless parts strapped
on for decoration. Cavorting around Morristown, N.J.,
Lacey picked up his first hubcap in 1987. Since that fateful day, he has been wheeling and dealing and working
the open market of hubcap sales.
When Lacey was nearing the ripe age of 7, he began to
deal to a friend's mother whose Plymouth Voyager had a
knack for liberating its hubcaps.
"At first, my parents limited me to one hubcap at a
time," Lacey said. "But by my senior year in high school,
I had nearly 4,000 of them stored in the basement."
By the time Green Day had released their masterpiece
album "Nimrod," Lacey had a simple Web site that adver-

tised his growing collection of hubcaps. Folks who had
been pounding over frost heaves through the long winter
months would e-mail Lacey and
request their unique missing
hubcaps. And Lacey would mail
them all over the country,
requesting $2O to $3O dollars per
cap.
"My senior year in high
school, I was getting between
six and eight e-mails a week

Lacey's knowledge of hubcaps is extremely precise

and nearly boundless. Driving along the highway, he
claims that he can glance at any neighboring hubcap and
identify the make, model and year. His collection is
organized completely in his mind and is always trans-

forming and growing.
Now, Lacey said, he doesn't have the time to keep up
with the demand
the Web site is not in operation,
though he does "cater to some repeat customers." And he
has done some business here at Swat.
"If people ask me for them, I'll get them, as long as
they can wait for me to go home," he said.
But business or not, Lacey claims he will always collect hubcaps. If he fails to find a niche in the field of computer science, he said, he will certainly revive his enterprise.

Fade to black: Jay-Z's uneven swan song
er is a prominent voice

BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
bmonkpal@swarthmore.edu

"Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black" is a resigned
yet edgy and chilling comment by one of rap's most wellknown emcees, Jay-Z. It is fitting that the respected and talented rapper named this latest album
which he has
announced will be his last "The Black Album." Black is
the color of endings and denotes a type of closure, and with

this album Jay-Z finishes an era of quick, intelligent and
crisp rhymes.
The album, set to drop at a later date in November, was
moved up to last Friday because of leakage on the Internet
and increased downloads. Usually albums are released on
Tuesdays, but this unique case, reminiscent of Eminem's
"The Eminem Show," created a semi-frenzy for the record
company hustling to sustain record sales in spite of the leakage. It's a double-edged sword for hardcore fans, who get
their favorite rapper's CD a few days earlier, but the antici-

pation might surprisingly be misguided. The album is somewhat disappointing for a last effort.
A cautionary notice to all artists: Anytime you publicly
announce that a forthcoming album will be your last, there
are certain expectations of quality that go along with that
claim. While his flow is superior and the beats sizzle most
notably in Neptunes and Timbaland-clad tracks ("Change
Clothes" and "Dirt Off Your Shoulder" respectively), a listener can't get past one fact
this is Jay-Z's last album.
Why? Because he himself just won't let anyone forget it.
"The Black Album" is a homage to, well, Jay-Z. The first
track is an interlude, quoting Betty Smith's "A Tree Grows
in Brooklyn:" "It is an inevitable part of the cycle of exisall things must conclude." From this point forward
tence
it is easy to accept that the theme of this album will be his
departure from the rap world.
Of course, before he can properly leave the scene, he
must have a track highlighting his life. "December 4th" is a
sweet song that mirrors old-school rap and music. His moth...

you'd like to hear something about the Natural History.
I've listened to this record maybe a dozen times this week,
and I can tell you it's pretty solid stuff. Guitar, bass,
drums; frills, not so much. Sounds like lots of bands, both
new and old. A lot of it sounds like itself, to be honest
sometimes a song will start and I'll think it's the one I just
heard but not in a bad way. It's like New York, I guess;

Where was I? Oh "Beat Beat Heartbeat" sounds real
catchy while I'm listening to it, but I have to admit not
much sticks with me when the record ends. So, buttons?
Here's what: Just go to Olde Club on Friday, and check out

the Natural History making their triumphant return to

campus. You'll dance and pump your fist and have a great
time (remember, standing still isn't cool anymore.) Who
knows, maybe you'll dig it so much you'll buy the album,
and if so you'll probably have a blast reliving the show in
your room for years to come. And as you leave> the show,
you'll most likely be thinking, "Damn! I love New York,

"Summer Sun," was a suitably shimmering, sweetly
downcast soundtrack to much of my spring, a quiet gem
even if several critics interpreted its simpler, mellower

mediocrity.
As if to dispel any concern that they might be getting
soft in their old age (please, they aren't even 20 years old
yet!), here comes the anti-"Sun," bursting out the gate

"Outsmartener" brings a bit of that trendy Eastern flavor. Having proved they're still rocking with the best

But for all this mean meat, what really makes this EP
worth hearing are the tracks that lean most suspiciously
toward filler: the bookending alternate versions ofalbum
cuts. The titular opener, which was among the more hummable moments of "Summer Sun," is recast here in the
"Sugarcube" mold; trenchantly rockist, with thick passionate guitars and driving drums that can't quite disturb
Ira's understated vocal, making for a beguiling mix of agitation and calm. Conversely, the disc closes with a
reworking of "Cherry Chapstick"
best known as the
solitary slab of straight-up rock that served as the beautiful dot of yang to point up the yin of the otherwise hushed
(and brilliant) "And Then Nothing Turned Itself InsideOut." Here, it's slowed to a crawl and stripped down to an
acoustic ballad, and it's as gorgeous as ever. Taken together, these tunes demonstrate something of the consummate
craftsmanship behind Yo La Tengo songs
even so dramatically recontextualized, their pure power as songs is
undiminished. And if you needed convincing, let this EP
demonstrate that Tengo's talent ain't going nowhere yet.

CAMPUS RELATIONS REP.

Sa'ed Adel Atshan 'O6

Joshua Forrest Berney 'O5

As many of you already know, I am sincerely committed and passionate about various issues. Having a representative and active Student Council is definitely one of
these issues that I would like to help work towards while I
am a member of the Swarthmore community. My experience as student body president in high school has
equipped me with the attributes and skills (such as teamwork) that are vital for a cohesive and successful student
government. As appointments chair, I would make sure
that all decisions are made equitably and will not take my
responsibilities to my fellow students lightly. In fact, I will
work to make our Student Council less discrete by bringing more transparency, specifically to the committee selection process, and to the dynamics within Student Council,
in general. It is time for us to bridge the gaps between students, faculty and the administration and for us to be able
to hold our elected officials accountable for their work.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Matt Meltzer 'O6

My name is Matt Meltzer, and I am running for appointments chair because I would like to improve the openness
and accessibility of the application process. To accomplish
these ends, I propose the following:
Extending the interview process to as many committee openings as possible.
Holding information sessions before the application
process begins so potential applicants have as clear a
perception as possible of the open committee positions
•

•

for which

they

can apply.

Notifying applicants when their applications are
received by the appointments committee.
• Be as accessible as possible during the application
process through both e-mail and "office hours" to those
who have questions during the process.
• It is both important and efficient to get to know the
individual behind the paper application, which is an
end that I will work towards if elected to the position.
Likewise, it is just as important that every applicant is
fully informed of the details of the open committees so
they can choose and apply to those that best suit their
interests.
•

I hope to offer my wide experience in administrative
organization, my enthusiasm and my commitment to the
student body. Thank you for your time and consideration.

John Ross Williams 'O6

As appointments chair, I will do my best job to

appoint the most qualified candidates to committees. I
believe that I am qualified for this position based on my

high school experience. I was active in founding several
student groups while at South Carroll, participated in
extensive community service, was captain of both the
varsity soccer and lacrosse teams and served as a peer
tutor and student aid while graduating as the valedictorian of my class. Through these, I learned skills which I
could use as appointments chair in that I know how to
organize group meetings and plan agendas. This experience has carried over to my life at Swarthmore. Here I
am a student academic mentor as well as a member of the
lacrosse team. I enjoy working in groups and would look
forward to working with the other members of Student
Council on the appointments committee. I think that
everyone who takes the time to apply for committees
should be granted the opportunity to have an interview
for their desired positions. This is a valuable part of the
committee application process which is not always
extended to all applicants, something I would like to
change as appointments chair. Fellow students, vote for
me, John Ross Williams for appointments chair, not
because of my excellent ability to grow a mustache, but
because of my dedication to you. Thank you for your

time.

The reason I am running for campus relations representative is simple: I want to make life here as pleasant
and convenient as possible. That said, below are a few
issues that I would like to address:
Universal Dorm Access: We need access to other
dorms. It is inconvenient and a safety risk for students.
Class Recommendation Guide: This was a great idea,
however, it is difficult to use and not very useful. The
online system should be redone, and more emphasis
should be placed on obtaining accurate reflections of
courses.
Meal Equivalency: Is the amount we receive sufficient
not to go hungry? Yes. Is it enough for a real dinner? I don't
believe so. I will work with dining services and the administration to find a solution to this difficult issue.
ITS: After years of consistent, unrestricted Internet
access, we have had a semester with a myriad of networkrelated issues. I will work with ITS on realistic usage policies that balance the freedom of students with this being,
fundamentally, an academic network.
If at any time, you have a concern, please contact me so
that it can be properly addressed.
E-mail me with questions or comments at jberneyL
Thank you.

Kristin Davis 'O6

Hi! My name is Kristin Davis 'O6, and I'm running for
campus relations representative, responsible for maintaining effective, constant forums of communication
between the student council and student body. Over the
past three semesters, I have found a dearth in communication and I believe that some basic improvements are necessary.
Having read the minutes, I noticed that the role and
value of campus relations representative is often obscured.
This position has a major responsibility that cannot be
overlooked when the council moves forward and addresses "hot" topics. There are many issues that Student
Council should be responsible for attending to this semester, including: the living wage, school budget, the role of
co-curricular activities in the college, issues of tolerance,
and overall student welfare. The council's efforts are in
vain, though, if not properly communicated to the student
body, a responsibility I will gladly undertake.
I hope to create another forum, in addition to the open
mic, where students could post questions or comments
about issues on campus, as well as creating mailing lists
for students who want updates on certain topics. (We all
need more e-mail, right?) The council needs to put its best
face forward when cooperating with the Board of
Managers and fellow students, and I am confident that I'm
the best person for this position.

Wootae Min 'O7

Dear students of Swarthmore,
For those of you who do not know me, my name is
Wootae Min 'O7, and I am running for the position of campus relations representative. Seeing that I am a freshman,
many of you may think that I lack the experience and skill
to hold this position; but rather, I believe that I bring plenty of experience and skill from high school. During my
four years in high school, I held the positions of student
body president, secretary, treasurer, Asian club president
and chairman of the social committee. By holding these
positions, I was able to successfully organize several
events and learn a lot about publicizing and organizing.
In addition to experience, I have other credentials that
embody a great campus relations representative. I have
great organization skills, a commitment to my work and
activities and good communication skills. I will make a
sincere effort to improve the overall campus life at
Swarthmore, and hopefully, you, the student body, will see
that I am a highly suitable candidate. So, make the right
decision and vote for Wootae Min for campus relations representative.

Scott Blaha 'O7

My name is Scott Blaha, and I am running for secretary
of Student Council. You may ask yourself, "Why should I
vote for Scott?" The answer is that I have a lot to offer the
Swarthmore student body. When you think of a secretary,
you think of someone who is organized, professional and
honest. I am an organized and motivated person and am
capable of keeping record of everything that Student
Council does. I am a professional person and would honor
all my commitments to the student body. I am an honest
and meticulous person who could keep careful track of
Student Council expenses. I have the qualities and motivation necessary to make a successful secretary. As a member of Student Council, I would push for ITS to be more
accountable to the student body. Also, I would advocate

would make the class recommendation book more accessi-

ble and ensure that it contains the opinions of more students. I would love no more than to serve all my fellow students at Swarthmore, so vote for Scott Blaha!

Jeremy Cristol 'O5

So I rant a lot and, if you know me, it's probably pretty
annoying. Most of my rant material comes from problems
here on campus, so, to spare you all from further blabbering, I've determined to rant about these problems once a
week at Student Council meetings and then actually fix
them. If elected, my first order of business will be getting
antibacterial soap in campus bathrooms, as eating takes
place in many places besides Sharpies, the only place with
the foamy, good stuff. Estesol "light duty" hand cleanser,
and the knowledge that my hallmates have been using it,
does not give me the confidence to reach my hand into a
communal bag of chips at a study break. Oh, wait, I'm
sorry. We can't have communal chips at study breaks, or
comply with the food and non-alcoholic beverage requirements at parties, because Tarble doesn't have big bags of
chips anymore. That will be priority two. I will also try my
hardest to get my beloved reheated pasta bar in the
Sharpies condiment room back. This is just a small sample
of the job I will do as council secretary, not to mention the
fabulous minutes I'll take at every meeting.

Randy Goldstein 'O5

My first priority as secretary will be to exercise scrupulous care in maintaining the records of the Student Council.
I will ensure that meeting minutes are immediately accessible to the student body and that Student Council achievements are publicized and properly archived for future generations. In addition to fulfilling the duties of secretary, I
will be dedicated to the issues most concerning the student
body, including:

Student Wages: Students are worth more than $7.63 per
hour. The college has exploited a captive workforce with low
wages for too long. I will work to achieve a student wage that
is comparable to those of other institutions.
Dining Policy: Swarthmore's meal plan offerings are
lackluster. I will make sure that the council explores new
options, including the increasing of Essie Mae's meal equivalencies and the acceptance of points at McCabe Coffee Bar.
I am confident that the diversity of my campus affiliations will afford me the broad perspective necessary to truly
represent all students. As captain of the men's rugby team, I
have demonstrated my ability to lead, take initiative and follow through on that initiative. If elected secretary, I will
draw upon my leadership experience and other campus
roles in order to serve the Swarthmore student body in the
most effective manner possible.

CO-PRESIDENT

CAMPUS LIFE REPRESENTATIVE

Jonathan Fombonne 'O5

Heidi Fieselmann 'O6

During the last year, I had the privilege of taking part in one of the most
active councils in Swarthmore history. With changes being made across the
board (charter reform, increased communication with the student body and
various curriculum changes), I have been able to see the development of new
wave of student initiatives on campus created by the current council which
is proof of the power students have to effect change at Swarthmore.
I would now like to take a leadership position in this effort by Student
Council to be more active on campus. The efforts of Ryan Budish 'O4, Anna
Morgan 'O4 and Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5 were instrumental in shaping a new
direction for council. I want to take this a step further and get the students
more involved in this process. I hope to work with current Co-President
Rodriguez in having a more informative council, one which actively seeks
out the interests of students and transforms them into policy. I would like to
work on unfinished initiatives such as club sports developments and a more
cost-effective book exchange system. I would also like to continue providing
active representation for the students of Swarthmore to the deans, the Board
of Managers and other governing committees. Finally, I will continue to back
Student Council's effort to help implement a living wage at Swarthmore.

Hello, Hello! In my experience after three semesters at Swarthmore, whether it be pulling an all-nighter
to finish a paper that already has an extension, waiting two hours for pizza from the ville or turning red
after dropping a cup on Sharpies' floor, I have realized that there are many facets of Swarthmore that can
not be given enough praise, while there are other aspects that could be improved. Whatever your concerns,
whether it be a lack of selection at Tarble or increased safety awareness on campus, I believe we should all
play an active role in making Swat a better place; I would be honored to be a voice that represents my peers.
Equipped with previous student government experience in high school as well as knowledge of a Swattie's
"unique" way of life, I am confident that I can adequately voice your needs and take your wishes and concerns to the administrators and deans. Together, let's make Swat the best it can be! Thank you!

Mark Hanis 'O5

Is that funny looking "Ecuador" kid who wears the oversized neon jacket and rides his bike everywhere

running for Student Council? Yes!
Last spring I was fortunate to have been voted as one of the campus life representatives, but I was unable
to serve due to an amazing internship abroad. I'm now back and even more committed to realizing the
duties I was previously elected to do.
Over the course of my two years here, I have been active participant in the Swat community, such as:
International Club, Learning for Life, Chester Leadership Program, Orientation, Dialogue for Peace
Protective Association, Sexual Health Counselors, College Judicial
Initiatives, the Swarthmore Fire
Committee, as well as working for ITS and Essie Mae's. I have been exposed to a vast array of suggestions
and am constantly hearing new ones on how life at Swat could be improved. I plan to unearth and give life
to as many of these ideas as I can. For example:
L Increase campus safety
2. Decrease intensity and increase relaxation
3. Improve Swatmail
4. Decrease paper waste
5. Have late night food options (allow meals, points and cash)
6. More coin machines
7. More sections of the same course
8. Longer gym hours
9. Increase size and improve security of summer storage space
10. Humanize freshmen registration
I will rely on the leadership experience I acquired from my previous experiences and I will stay firm and
not get frustrated when things are not running as expected.
I will always be accessible: You can stop me (neon jacket), e-mail me (mhanisl) or call me (ext. 5374).
I am eager to rise to the challenge of serving as your campus life representative. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.
&

Let's face it: You don't know who the heck I am. So while I have the
stage, I should be clear: I'm the short Jyoti and I'm running for Student
Council co-president. I have not been part of Student Council at
Swarthmore, and I think that a fresh perspective and new voice could be
helpful additions to an already motivated and effective council. I do not
have council experience, but I do have committee experience as a publication representative on Forum for a Free Press. I have developed familiarity and connections with the administration as an RA, and I also serve as a
peer mediator. I feel that I have the skills necessary to assert new initiatives, effectively communicate those of the council and other students,
carry out administrative duties and processes in order to maintain council efficiency, and complement the skills of Co-President Emiliano
Rodriguez 'O5 and other council members. I look forward to serving as a
liaison between students and administrators in order to find new ways of
keeping Swarthmore an environment that continues to enhance us academically, socially, and culturally. Please allow me, Jyoti Gupta 'O5, to
serve as your co-president. Thanks.

Civil discourse
It's hard to be sit at a Sharpies table and wait your
turn to speak when someone you knew and loved, or
someone your parents or grandparents knew and loved,

or even someone whom you never knew but who shares
with you a connection through faith, history and culture was brutally murdered, and the student across
from you is passionately defending the murderers.
It's even harder when that person is thinking the
same thing about you.
It's almost impossible to argue the issue of Israel and
Palestine without invoking the specters of antiSemitism or Western imperialism. Many on our campus have deep personal involvement in the issue, and
many who do not are nonetheless strongly emotionally
committed to their stance.
As a leaderfrom Im Tirtzu said, dialogue for the purpose of changing opinion seems wasted effort. Four
years at a liberal arts college will probably not be
enough to dig activists on either side out of their
entrenchments. Even so, those of us with strong opinions have a responsibility to ourselves to make a
strong, reasoned defense of them in order to convince
the undecided and earn the respect of our opponents.
As college students, our opinons don't determine
international policy, and we shouldn't pretend they do.
Our goal in college is to learn, from each other as well
as from the faculty, and we should look for what we can
learn from those who disagree with or attack us rather
than seeing them as political enemies.
Learning empathy for others' points of view even if
we vehemently disagree with their causes not only
makes us better at defending our beliefs and negotiating for our goals, but makes us wiser, better people,
which ought to be the real goal of a Swarthmore education and of all of our lives.

Integrate Africana
For a couple of reasons, the recent proposal at The
a separate black or Africana studies
Swarthmore seems fundamentally

Ring to create
department at

wrongheaded to us.
This proposal is not new; faculty members have

mentioned it and similar ones before, and the first
major obstacle to any of them is funding. If such proposals have failed in times when the college was financially flush, with the endowment down, now is not the
time to make one. If anything, we should be facing the
tough decision of the next budget item to cut, not the

next budget item to add.
Moreover, even if we could afford a new department,

the problem with making it an area studies department,
like an African studies department, is that it privileges
one particular social group over another. If the new
department should represent a marginalized point of
view, why should it be the African studies department?
Why not queer studies, or women's studies, or Chicano
studies, or Asian studies, or Teutonophone studies? How
many departments are we going to have to create in
order to satisfy the demands of fairness and diversity?

This brings us to the real point, which is that creating an Africana studies department does exactly what
its proponents are trying to oppose. It legitimizes
Eurocentric viewpoints in the rest of academia; it establishes studying African perspectives as a peculiar, sepa-

rate form of academia. It lumps all of the separate
"Africana studies" together, as though the odd, unconventional subject of Africa can be tackled all at once,
while non-African subjects must be organized by discipline because of their superior breadth.

A better tack would be to try to make our existing
disciplinary organization better represent diverse
points of view. Rather than creating an Africana studies
department that separates African issues and perspectives from mainstream academic pursuits, we should
push for inclusion of African perspectives in all departments that touch on the issue, as with other marginalized points of view. The goal should not be to glorify the
margins but to bring the margins into the mainstream.

there's a campaign describing the "meaning" (singular) of

Why? What's the point? Aside from the fact that people

This is sometimes good. This mythology, this sense of

much harder to achieve at a bigger, more generic school.

Israelis and sing songs about destroying Israel and
replacing it with "Palestine."

Fabian Capitalism
for the free Negro
I call the policy that Booker T.
Washington prescribed for the
Negro in his struggle for existence
"Fabian Capitalism," after Fabius
Maximus, the general whose strategy of delay defeated Hannibal and
thus saved Rome from Carthage.
Fabian Capitalism begins in 1881
with Washington's founding of
Tuskegee Normal and Industrial
Institute. Built from scratch, it was
his prototype for an AfricanAmerican civilization overlapping
the European-American civilization built by free Negro labor.
TARU TAYLOR
Through his school he taught the
Gadfly
Negro to navigate the commercial,
industrial world in which he lived,
rather than some fantasy world of
Latin and Greek grammar. The Sage of Tuskegee is the economic
archetype of Original Man.
Original Man-Marginal Man is the great either-or of the PanAfrican dialectic. Every black man the world over either fulfills
the archetype of Original Man or fits the stereotype of Marginal
Man. He is either an agent or a victim. He is either Marcus Garvey
or W.E.B. Du Bois. Within the African-American dialectic, he is
eitherBooker T. Washington or W.E.B. Du Bois.
Under the tutelage of Washington, Original Man learned that
the object of this zero-sum game called "capitalism" is property.
John Locke, the European philosopher who has influenced
thought more than anyone not
European-American
named Machiavelli, defined "property" as "life, liberty, and
estate." He argued: One, property is the chief end of civil society;
two, government has no other end than preservation of property;
and three, the reason men enter into society is preservation of
property. He even went so far as to say that entrance into society
without property is absurd. This line of reasoning implies that so
long as Negroes have no property, they have no reason to enter
into a North American society based on Locke's notion Of property
Enter Reconstruction, during which the U.S. government
promised blacks 40 acres and a mule so as to give them a reason to
enter into society. But white America reneged. Blacks never got
their 40-acre estates.
Fabian Capitalism was about blacks systematically acquiring
property so as to have a reason to enter into the United States of
America as citizens. Washington saw through Jefferson's "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." His panacea, rightly, was
life, liberty, and estate."
"property
But Marginal Man, under the tutelage of Du Bois, unlearned
that invaluable lesson. He fell for the red herring of the zero-sum
game: civil rights. Original Man was poised to play the game as a
commonwealth under the auspices of Washington's NNBL
(National Negro Business League), founded in 1900. He would win
insofar as the black masses, to a man, got their4o-acre estates, thus
achieving self-reliance. Marginal Man is divided against himself,
for his bourgeois faction, the Talented Tenth, play against the proletarian masses. These house Negroes win insofar as they assume
token positions of prestige within white America. They win insofar as they keep the field Negroes in check, as the buffer between
black unrest and white supremacy. For Original Man, victory is
about capital and property, or self-reliance. For Marginal Man,
victory is about prestige and bling-bling, or conspicuous con-

sumption.
Washington put civil rights on the back burner in favor of
property. He rejected "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"
in favor of "life, liberty, and estate." He avoided political protest
in favor of the gradual development of an economy of scale. Du
Bois deconstructed him as an Uncle Tom. He accused Washington
of selling out. But if one accepts as axiomatic Locke's principle
that property is the substance of citizenship, a prerequisite for
civil rights, then Du Bois erred in putting the cart before the
horse, civil rights before property rights. Du Bois's deconstruction of Washington as an Uncle Tom, his deconstruction of Fabian
Capitalism as a sellout, amounts to the deconstruction of the

African-American civilization which had Tuskegee as its prototype, Washington as its archetype. Because Du Bois constructed
no political program as a counterpoint to the economic program
he undermined, he is downright villainous. Constructive criticism as a point of departure for a viable program or philosophy is
heroic, but mere deconstruction is parasitic.

Digital cameras:
practical and cool

op-art

by

annie

ronan

It's my inexpert opinion that

digital photography is one of the
coolest innovations of the past 10
years. Photography became an
integral part of our lives (for better or for worse) decades ago, and
the digital camera makes the

process so much easier. It still

has drawbacks: Film yields much
higher-quality images, the cameras are more fragile and sometimes unreliable and the controls
are often a little awkward.

However, they let you do many
things that a film camera could
not, and as a result, they are
Technological Misfit changing our notions of photog
m raphy.
The first thing to notice abou
modern digital cameras is the resolution they shoot at. One o
the neat things about film is that it gives you extremely high
quality images very easily. This isn't always the case with dig
ital cameras. You need a camera that's around three megapix
els to get a reasonable four by six print; three-megapixel cam
eras generally can be had for $3OO or less. If you're intending t
put your photos on a Web site, rather than print them, a three
megapixel camera is more than you need.
But there's a lot more to these digital cameras than just
being able to take pictures. Camera designers have taken a sort
of "why not?" mentality to the cameras, throwing in tons of features of debatable usefulness. But some of the things modern
cameras can do are remarkably useful, or else just plain cool,
like the ability to take movie clips. Since storage is limited, the
clips can't be too long (a 256 MB card will hold about 12 minutes
of video at a reasonable resolution), but just being able to take
moving shots, typically with sound, lets you capture all sorts of
things with a camera that you generally couldn't before.
Digital cameras also tend to come with a dizzying array of
modes to make shooting good pictures really easy. Canon cameras have default features for portraits, landscapes, night photos, sports and slow exposures; Nikon cameras feature a dizzying array of pre-arranged conditions from photographing
architecture or fireworks to shooting on a beach or in a museum. Like good pieces ofmodern technology, they try to do your
work for you.

EVAN HENSLEIGH

Just being able to take moving shots,
typically with sound, lets you capture all
sorts of things with a camera that you
generally couldn't before.
Of course, there's a practical side to digital cameras, too.

Even with a three-megapixel camera, you can easily take photos of papers and import them onto your computer
a single
photo will yield a print-quality image of an 8-by-ll page. Canon
cameras come with a utility called Photo Stitch that lets you
combine several photos to get print-quality images of even larger images. That's right: Your digital camera is also a good,
quick and easy portable scanner.
So we've established that digital cameras are cool and useful. But what else can they do for us? Will digital cameras
change the way we relate to photography? The answer is,
unsurprisingly, yes. By making the process faster and easier
than ever before, they make it even more trivial than it is.
"Film" is free, and now you can gather all your friends around
to look at the pictures you took right after you took them. You
can put your photo right onto a computer and edit it in something like Photoshop, or e-mail it to a friend. They offer instant
and, of course, you're set to take as many phogratification
tos as you like.
In this, the digital camera fits into the pattern of a lot of
computer technology: It makes things cheap, easy and fast, the
motto of the digital revolution. It is a little bizarre to see everything around us become digital (from mail to music to cameras
to books), but the advantages to doing so are becoming clearer
all the time. I don't know what will be next, but I'll be sure to
take a digital photo of it.

nothing whatsoever to encourage

November 20, 2003

Well, with the answers, really. The answers are
often glib and, I think, shallow. It seems to me that
thorough ethical analysis is the responsibility of science; with knowledge comes responsibility. I would
really like to see the article give even a few moments'
thought to the suffering science causes and/or has
the potential to cause. Naturally, the animal stuff is
what I really care about
particularly the
"Intelligence" one and the "What Should We Eat"
one. I can see that I'd have corresponding problems
with some of the others if I cared about human suffering. (Well, I do care,
just not nearly as much
as I care about animals,
since we humans are
responsible for what we
play
inflict on ourselves,
while animals are largely not responsible for

what

we

inflict

on

them.)
The thing is, suffering is suffering, independent of the abstract Value
or intelligence or power of the sufferer.
Science is in the best possible position to be an
arbiter of morality, in that it theoretically has at
hand all the knowledge it needs to make educated
decisions, also in that it is in the best possible position to cause or alleviate suffering. Science plays God
all the time, and, if you're going to play God, you get
the responsibility of being God. So if The New York
Times is going to try to interpret science for the rest
of us, it had better try to interpret morality for science, too. It's irresponsible to do otherwise.

Increase competition in county elections Taking the church
Counties' representation systems give too much power to majority parties
beyond tolerance

BY CHARLES PENNACCHIO
pennaccc@devalcol.edu

Why is it that, term after four-year term, suburban
voters elect the maximum number of Republicans and
the minimum number of Democrats to their county
governing boards?
That's happened, almost without interruption, for
decades, and it happened again earlier this month in
races for Bucks, Chester and Montgomery County
Commissioner and for Delaware County Council positions. Is it because residents are satisfied with the status quo of one-party control? Or is it because the electoral systems and entrenched political interests (and
individuals) undermine competition, representative
government and political accountability?

Because county government has never before
played such a crucial role in homeland security, not to
mention the environment and the economy, each of us
must insist upon more open and democratic methods of

electing our representatives. Every citizen has a critical stake in the debate over how to bring greater
accountability and responsiveness to our county government systems in the suburbs.
Some may be surprised to learn that not all of our

suburban counties govern themselves the same way.
Bucks, Chester and Montgomery Counties operate
under the older system of guaranteed minority-party
representation. Since World War 11, both Chester and
Montgomery Counties have had a 2-1 Republican
majority. In Bucks County, Republicans have held the
same 2-1 advantage for all but four years in the mid'Bos. In each of these counties, one party can win no
more than two seats at a time. Therefore, each party
fields no more than two candidates per general election. Like clockwork, the Republicans win the top two
commissioners' seats, and the two Democrats are left
to fight it out for the last opening.
In Delaware County, there is a five-member County
Council with no guaranteed minority-party representation. And since its Home Rule Charter was adopted
in the mid-19705, no Democrat has been elected to the
council. Regardless of whether we're dealing with
guaranteed minority representation in three counties
or the Home Rule Charter in the fourth that perpetuates one-party dominance, we're dealing with two systems that are functionally anti-democratic.
Perhaps we can kid ourselves into believing that the
process is more or less egregious in one case or the

letter

to

other. The point is that each supports one-party control
and makes county elections practically irrelevant. And
because the same anti-competitive, anti-democratic
and anti-representational results appear in both systems, we need to roll up our sleeves and fix these problems before they do more damage to our democracy.
Consider, for a moment, what a lack of competition,
democracy and representation produces under each
electoral process. Virtual and real power monopolies at
any level produce cronyism, corruption and graft
among officeholders and cynicism, frustration and apathy among citizens.
County officials are responsible for many important
issues, including the methods and tools employed by
first-response emergency personnel to possible terrorist threats, the awarding of county government contracts, preservation of open space and local tax levies.
On the one hand, it is difficult to measure the actual
costs and consequences of our suburban counties' lessthan-democratic electoral systems. On the other hand,
it is a generally accepted principle that entrenched,
one-party rule significantly increases the risk of unaccountable governments that are run more for the benefit of campaign contributors and political allies than for
the general public interest.
As an educator, historian and suburban resident, I
say that now is the time to seriously reconsider our
county government structures. The best step now
would be to establish a government study commission

to examine various methods of truer representation
(district-by-district and county-wide elections, for
example) as well as greater citizen participation in
local elections and government.
Chester County voters approved such a commission
in 1973, but voters rejected its recommendations in
1975. Given Chester County's previous efforts to
enhance representative government, its citizens and
those of Bucks, Delaware and Montgomery Counties
should be emboldened to petition for study commissions whose proposals would be voted on by the public.
Or democratic-minded county commissioners could
take the same initiative on their own by seeking public
comment and then putting their proposed solutions
before voters. Whether bottom-up or top-down, it's time
now for constructive action.

Student rudeness needs to stop
Dear Editor:

About two weeks ago, the morning shuttle, which

However, I was greatly shocked when I heard of an

$37,000 a year to come here and that they have every

I have always been somewhat uncomfortable with the
tendency of some in the gay

rights movement to make "tolerance" the buzzword for the
goals of the movement. Don't
get me wrong

tolerance is a

good thing, and it would be

a

major step forward if everyone
in America who believed
homosexuality is wrong decid-

ed to let their gay fellow citi-

zens live their own lives and
have the same legal rights as

PATRICK HART

The Drawing Board

straight citizens.

Yet that kind of scenario
should not be the ultimate goal

of gay-rights activists. The ultimate goal should be to create,

not by coercion but by persuasion and moral argument, a society where no one has to tolerate
homosexuality because no one disapproves of it, a society that
not just tolerates but accepts homosexuality as something that
is, as Jim's dad says about masturbation in "American Pie," "a
perfectly natural, normal... thing."
Acceptance, though, is not something that can be achieved
by changes in laws, though those changes may reflect increased

acceptance of a previously marginalized group. Acceptance is
something that comes about through conversation and
increased understanding. As gay writer Andrew Sullivan says,
"Politics cannot do the work of life. Even culture cannot do the
work of life. Only life can do the work of life."
How will we know when this acceptance has come about?
Such changes cannot be measured by polls or ratings, but let me
suggest a possible answer: In this country, religion and politics
are generally kept separate (Rick Santorum notwithstanding). If
a religious denomination that has previously been hostile to
gays begins to let them into the full life of the church, then that
may signify real change, particularly in a country where religious people are on average more conservative than non-religious people.

It is therefore a very hopeful sign that the old barriers of
prejudice and fear that kept religious gays closeted to their fellow believers are weakening. On Sunday, Nov. 2, the Episcopal
Church consecrated V. Gene Robinson as a bishop. Robinson is
an openly gay man who makes no secret ofhis relationship with
his male partner. He was elected as a bishop by New Hampshire
Episcopalians in June and confirmed by the American
Episcopal bishops in August after a bitter confirmation struggle. Already, conservative Episcopalians in America are taking
steps to counter what they see as a profoundly un-Scriptural
step. Some have talked of forming separate dioceses that do not
acknowledge Robinson as a bishop. Others have discussed splitting off from the Episcopal church, which is a branch of the
worldwide Anglican Communion, and forming their own conservative Anglican branch. Outside of the United States and
Europe, which have the most liberal Anglican churches, the
opposition to Robinson has been even more intense.
The efforts of Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of
Canterbury and spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, to
avoid a schism (break in the church) over Robinson may be in
vain. If a break comes, it would be very painful for Anglicans
everywhere, but it would be better for those who support the
full participation and inclusion of gay Anglicans in the church
to stand their ground than to cave in to pressure from conservative forces. Whatever happens, it is a remarkable time for gay
Christians; before Robinson's consecration, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal church, Frank Griswold, said in an interview that those who wrote the Bible condemned homosexual
relations but had no concept of loving, caring homosexual partnerships as we understand them today. You might have to be a
gay Christian to understand the importance of this statement,
but just consider that the leader of a major mainstream
American Christian denomination has said that he does not

consider homosexuality sinful. That statement, and the fact that
that denomination now has an openly gay bishop, serves as
hope for the many gay religious people everywhere who have
for too long been told that their sexual orientation is sinful and
wrong and that they should either marry heterosexually or lead

chaste lives. It should also serve as hope for anyone, religious or
not, who longs for a day when gays and lesbians are not just tolerated but accepted, loved and cherished.

Always moving onward and upward
Only 12 percent of this fall season's rosters were composed of seniors. Last week's article, "Onwards, Upwards:
Seniors Say Goodbye," mentioned the paucity of four-year
varsity athletes, but something about the article compels
me to foreground the

miniscule

number.

Understanding why so few
play for their entire collegiate

ous

career has its obvianswer

Swarthmore's academic
rigor is too demanding

but it is an oversimplified
one that eliminates the
complexities of studentathlete life, the nuances of

which coaches and players
explicate.
Eric

AARON WASSERMAN

The Underdogs

Wagner,

head

coach of the men's soccer

team, quickly and firmly
told me that to investigate
the issue I had to eliminate my notion that this
phenomenon
was

Swarthmore-specific. When I asked about Swarthmore's

seemingly poorer retention rate, he responded, "Poorer'
than what? Swarthmore is no different in terms of retention than most Division 111 programs in the country. It
might be significantly better than

Eve

some of the other places

coached."

His comment is positive
Swarthmore is unique in
but its athletic programs do not suffer from an
yet it appears slightly
exclusive, blanket problem
depressing because coaches recruit students knowing
some will not continue. All four coaches I interviewed,
lany ways,

Wagner, Kelly Wilcox of

field hockey, Amy Brunner of
women's soccer and Adrienne Shibles of women's basketball expressed some level of frustration with this constraint, yet nothing more than a mild level. Wilcox replied,
"I don't ever see a player leaving as a lost recruiting opportunity. Coaches should be here for the players, and not the
other way around. That is why I coach at the Div. 11l level."
For her and the others, coaching an athlete is also
developing a person, which highlights a truism, albeit one
that can have detrimental effects on the playing field:
Personalities, and priorities, change. Sometimes athletes
no longer want to define themselves as athletes.
Confronting and solving this inevitability is a coach's
challenge. Shibles advises her players "to take time offand
do different things in the offseason if they are starting to
feel like basketball is no longer fun. I think this is healthy
and will keep them stay fresh and enjoy things more for
the four-y«ar span." Wagner has a more aggressive
approach, telling his team at the season's start, "You have
only four years to play college soccer. You have the rest of
your life to do everything else." Different styles, but both
motivate their players to ensure athletics remains a high
priority.

The students I questioned share a similar mindset,
stressing the importance of priorities. Blair Haxel 'O5 averaged 12.5 points and nine rebounds per game last year for
the men's basketball team, but is studying abroad instead
of playing this winter because, after losing sleep over the
decision, he realized studying abroad is "something that I
can only do while I'm in college." His explanation for others' choices uses an economics metaphor: "The question
is whether you get more out of a sport than you put in, and
I think people quit because, for various reasons [playing
time or academic sacrifices], they give up more than they
get."
That does not mean those who stay with their programs

do not struggle with these priorities, too. Sarah Hilding 'O4
just concluded four years with the field hockey team, but
she admitted she considered quitting in the past. Jeff
Schneider 'O5, a member of the men's swimming team,
describes practices as trying, but "a season can give you a
sense of accomplishment that is hard to parallel." On pure
conjecture, I asked Schneider if the men's and women's
swimming teams have a better retention rate than other
programs, and he said they might, because swimming is "a
very individual sport where there isn't a lot of trouble
with getting 'playing time.' Actually, the senior contingent on the swimming teams this year is just as small, but
Schneider primarily returns because of camaraderie with
his teammates, another recurring theme. Natalie Dunphy
'O5 of the women's volleyball team, Haxel and Hilding all
emphasize this feeling, the last stressing, "Had I not had
such a wonderful group of girls to work with I don't know
whether I would have stuck with it."
Regarding those vaunted academic demands, Dunphy
and Schneider believe their classroom performances
improve in-season. Dunphy said volleyball required lots of
time but that it forced her to "work more efficiently and
get everything done that needs to get done." Schneider
added that swimming "provides an outlet for stress, and it
also provides a little more structure to my daily schedule."
Asking coaches and players to explain their perceptions of Swarthmore's low athlete retention rate and the
"

surrounding student-athlete culture prompted heartfelt
testimonials of everyone's decisions to define a large part

of themselves as athletes
and their highly rewarding
experiences. As Wagner strongly believes, athletes "will
remember these four years with great pride." Schneider
added, "I think that athletics here provide a once in a lifetime opportunity to compete in a sport that you love."

Tide hope to build on last season's success
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR

rheymanl@swarthmore.edu

The men's basketball team will enter its 2003-2004

season with plenty of motivation. Entering the final
week of the season, last year's men's basketball team
needed only one win in its final two conference games to
guarantee a birth in the Centennial Conference playoffs.
Swarthmore failed to win either of those last games,
including the season finale at home against archrival
Haverford College. The team was then forced to watch
Washington College gain the final bid to the CC semifinals.
Despite the disappointing finish, last season's squad
showed dramatic improvement from years past. The
2003 team won more conference games (five) than
Swarthmore had won in any season since it last made
the playoffs in 1997. The five victories were also three
more than the 2002 team had amassed.
In order to improve on last season, Swarthmore will
have to overcome the loss of Eran Ganot, David Pearce,
and Josh Loeffler, all of whom graduated last May.
Pearce received all-conference honors last season, and
finished his career ranked eighth on the career scoring
list at Swarthmore and also among the school leaders in
assists and steals. With 6'7" center Blair Haxel 'O5 studying abroad next semester, the Garnet Tide loses both
size and experience.
This season, Swarthmore will be led by its three senior captains, Jacob Letendre, Jared Passmore, and Chris
Loeffler. Letendre needs only 22 assists and 17 steals to
become the all-time career leader at Swarthmore in both
categories. Last season Letendre led Swarthmore in both
these categories, averaging 3.5 assists and 1.5 steals per
game. Loeffler was also a leading contributor last season, posting solid numbers in field goal percentage
(47.5), free-throw percentage (78.3) and rebounding (4.8).
While Letendre, Passmore, and Loeffler provide leadership, Matthew Gustafson 'O5 will provide the team's
firepower. Gustafson has led the Garnet in scoring in

each of his first two seasons and is likely to become only
the second player in school history to join the 1,000-point

club during his junior season. Last year he averaged 15.6
points per game, and took three times as many shots as
any other returning player.
Sophomore guards Ben Perkins and Jim Dalton both
contributed valuable double-figure minutes off of the
bench last year and will be counted upon to increase
their production this season.
Of the fourteen players that made the team this year,
six are first-years, ensuring a wide open battle for playing time. "We're going to be pretty young this season,
which could be problematic but it could be exciting,"

November 20, 2003

said Letendre. "Freshmen will have to step up."

Fighting for playing time this year will be Eric
Williams 'O6, as well as new freshmen, who include
Chris Casey, Dillon McGrew, Kevin Blodgett, Mark
Rohde, Jeff Maxim and Canadian Alan Walsh.
"I think, based on our two scrimmages, we've been
playing pretty well as a team," Letendre said. "We have
a better shooting team than we've had in the past. We're
gonna be pretty small this year, so we're gonna have to
play more of a team game and make sure everyone boxes
out."

Superfans: filling stands, sidelines and
bleachers at Swarthmore athletic events
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN

akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore athletics faces a challenge
present at most academically focused
Division 111 schools: Where are the fans? It
could be due to the loss of the football
team, the cornerstone of any college's fan
base, or to a greater apathy of Swat students to sports in general. Regardless,
Swarthmore is lucky to have a small but
proud group of dedicated so-called "superfans" who frequent all varieties of sporting events. This group was headed up last
year by Mike Loeb 'O3, who frequented
every men's and women's basketball home
game, but alas, these graduated shoes will
be filled by some eager feet this year.
Jeff Schneider 'O5 leads the dedicated
group of Swarthmore students bent on
being omnipresent at sporting events and
making their presence known. His loud,
referee-angering banter can be heard at
soccer, baseball and basketball games
year round. When he's not busy mocking
the competition, he hits the pool for the
men's swimming team. Schneider believes
the superfan complex is based on a sense
of being "completely convinced that your
team can never do anything wrong and,
when in doubt, you should blame the
other team." Power in numbers can be
very effectual in sports audiences, he
argues. "The more people that go, the
more embarrassed we can make the other
team."
Jonna Seavey 'O6 is another Swat
superfan. She came to Swarthmore to play
basketball, but, due to a knee injury, she is
unable to play for the team. Instead, she
works for both the volleyball and women's
basketball teams in order to continue her
interest in sports. A Red Sox fan, Seavey
knows that it takes dedication, and a sense
of never giving up on a team. A good fan
needs dedicationand loyalty."

THE PHOENIX
xinaoH^aHr

Swarthmore's spirited and involved
Registrar Martin Warner is also a consistent audience member at sports games.
Warner enjoys the indoor sports at Tarble
Pavilion, and he frequents men's and
women's basketball games, along with volleyball. Warner sadly accepts that "at
Swarthmore, athletics aren't going to be
the big item of the day." Being both a fan
of basketball and faculty adviser to the
men's basketball team gets Warner to
most home games. To recruit more
Swattie fans, he suggests, "when someone
on a sports team politely invites you to a
sporting event, it's generally a good reason to go. You'll probably have a good time
and come back to watch again." Emma
Benn 'O4 personally invited Warner to
check out one of Swat's volleyball games
and he has been hooked ever since.
Njideka Akunyili 'O4 is another athlete
who doubles as a superfan. "Being an athlete, I know how much it means to me
when people show up," she said. "So I go
to support the team and hope it means the

same to them."
"Yes, Swarthmore teams do lose often,
but many of the games are very memorable," Akunyili said. "We still have great
wins and it's good to be there for them."

Attending athletic events also gives
Akunyili the opportunity to learn more

about other Swatties. "You'll know someone on the team, seeing them in a new
light. You're given an opportunity to see
people how you've never seen them

before," she said.
What possesses a superfan to attend
every home sporting event? Evan
Buxbaum 'O6 believes Swat's stressful
environment is responsible. "Everybody
has to find a way to vent the insanity that
Swarthmore inevitably causes, and if
some people choose to become sport fanatics, so be it," he said.

Keep the BCS? Yes
One sport that has not made its way to the pages of The Phoenix this
semester is college football. Yes, there is such a sport and for you underclassmen who many not be aware, it once thrived here at the College.
The big controversy in college football this week is USC's slip to
number three in the Bowl Championship Series standings, elevating
Ohio State to the number two slot and a berth in the Sugar Bowl. What's
the big deal, you ask? Well for one, USC won last week by 45 points. Ohio
State won by only three. In both the AP and Coaches polls, 9-1 USC is
solidly in second place, behind undefeated Oklahoma and in front of
Mark Duzenski's 9-1 LSU Tigers. Ohio State is fourth in the polls, yet,
thanks to strong computer rankings, they
are second in the BCS.
Ohio State is second in every computer
ranking except for genius Jeff Sagarin's
ranking, where they are third (using some
super-complex formula, Sagarin has what
I consider the most accurate ranking).
USC is second in the Sagarin ranking,
third in two others, fourth in three others

and fifth behind even three-loss Florida in
the New York Times ranking. What is the
NYT doing ranking college football teams
anyway? Year in and year out, their rank-

ings are by far the most bizarre.
In addition to the two major polls and a

CARLTON DAVIS

Rounding Third

computer average, the BCS is based upon
losses, quality wins and strength of schedule. Therein lies the problem for USC:
Their schedule strength is 37th whereas
Ohio State's is 13th. Though their average
margin of victory is 26.1 points, Southern

Cal's only loss this year came at the hands of a subpar Cal team. Ohio
State, despite having an average margin of victory of only 10.7 points,
lost 17-10 to a strong Wisconsin team. USC, though, has one "quality
win" having defeated number 10 Washington State. This gives it an additional boost in the BCS for beating a top-10 opponent; Ohio State has no

quality wins.

Given that the voters and coaches feel that USC is the better team,
that it thoroughly whips its opponents instead of letting them hang
around in the game, and that most analysts agree USC should be solidly
entrenched in the second slot instead of Ohio State (if LSU wins out
they, too, could be a huge factor. They have a big game this weekend
against Eli Manning's Ole Miss, and a victory could put them neck and
neck in the standings with these other two teams), does this mean there
is something wrong with the BCS? The easy and obvious answer is yes.
My

view is the opposite.

I used to hate the BCS. Though I liked the idea of the number one
team playing (in theory) the number-two team, the BCS ripped the tradition and history from the Big Ten-Pac Ten Rose Bowl and the Big
Eight (now 12) champion going to the Orange Bowl. Instead, the Series
set up four major bowls with major payouts to the eight teams involved.
Not always, though, has there been a consensus that the top two teams
meet in the National Championship. Take for instance Miami's drubbing of my Nebraska Cornhuskers two years ago. Nebraska finished
second in the rankings, barely (by 0.05) ahead, of Colorado, who had
annihilated them in the final game of the regular season. Though
Colorado had the better poll average, Nebraska's computer rankings
were strong and Colorado had two losses to Nebraska's one, albeit
against Colorado. This created much controversy.
The BCS system has been widely criticized for, among other things,
leaning too heavily on computers and not the voters. Though, this has
been somewhat remedied the last couple years, as the computer averages count for less than they have in the past. The BCS has also come
under fire for favoring the six major conferences and leaving strong
teams from lesser conferences out of the picture and the lucrative payday. Many critics of the BCS are strong proponents of a playoff system.
Although this initially appealed to me, the extended season, interference with academics, and increased risk of injury (a la Willis McGahee)
are reasons to keep the imperfect BCS system intact.
Congress has recently held hearings on the BCS and its fairness, and
university presidents and chancellors last weekend decided to come up
with a new plan for the BCS once its current contract expires in 2006.
Don't expect the "new BCS" to look much different, though. Like everything else in sports, the BCS boils down to money: big bowls, big audiences, big TV contracts and big paydays. Until money becomes insignificant in college football (read: never), expect the BCS to stick around in
some form or another. You won't, however, be hearing any complaints
from me. What could possibly be more exciting than flipping between
four games simultaneously on a Saturday afternoon, rooting for certain
margin of victories while watching the ticker of scores at the bottom of
the screen to see how my team's opponent of six weeks ago is faring? In
my mind, absolutely nothing.

In their final meets of the season, the men's
and women's cross country teams took to the
trails of Dickinson to compete in the NCAA
Mideast Regional Championships. The men, led
by Lang Reynolds 'O5, tied with Allegheny
College for sixth place. The women harriers ran
to a 15th place finish among 38 teams.
Reynolds covered the 8K course in a time of
26:39, good for an 11thplace finish out of 249
competitors.

"The tie-breaker was not the standard way it
works," Hunt said. "Our sixth runner was much
better than theirs. But we finished really well,
and this' bodes well for Swat next year because
everyone is returning."
On the women's 6K course, Elizabeth Gardner
'O5 paced the Garnet with a 66th place finish,
recording a time of 25:07. Njideka Akunyili 'O4
finished her Swat cross-country career, finishing
86th
(25:29).

first runner to the fifth, and that
helped the team out a lot."

Hunt was happy with the team's performance.
"This was the best Swat has ever done at
Regionals," he said. "It was the best team performance of the year. We shortened our spread
from the first runner to the fifth, and that helped

the team out a lot."

Although Swarthmore and Allegheny College
scored the same number points, Allegheny was
declared the winner through a tiebreaker.

During the season, a tiebreaker consists of looking at the performance of each team's sixth runner. The better finish among the two men decides
the team winner. At Dickinson, however, judges
looked to the first-place runners for each team to
decide victory. Allegheny junior Kevin Pool

through five for the
Tide.
The team ran without two top runners
Maria Elena Young 'O4
and Debbie Farrelly
'o6 due to injuries.
Young has been
sidelined with a tibial
stress fracture for most of the season. The team
felt her absence on the trail. "We lost a huge part
of our team when Maria got injured in the beginning of the season," Farrelly said, "not just
because she was our number one runner and one
of the fastest in the conference, but also because
she is a great leader and teacher." But regardless
of her physical condition, Young maintained her
presence on the team. "Even though she could
not run, she worked hard to maintain the same
role as a leader she would have had if she wasn't
injured," Farrelly said.
A first-place Tidewater Classic finish and second-place Dickinson Invite finish highlighted the
men's season. The women finished this season
with a third-place at Tidewater and bronze at the
conference championship.
