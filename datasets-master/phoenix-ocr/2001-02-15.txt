Campus network fails Tuesday
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Tuesday morning, in the midst of a routine upgrade,
the college computer network went down across the entire
campus. While the computing center worked quickly to get
as much of the network back online as possible, some buildings remained affected by the outage until after noon on
Wednesday. During the downtime, Swarthmore community
had a chance to relearn what life is like without working
e-mail, network or Internet access.
The outage began at about 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, when a
piece of hardware called a gigabyte switchfailed. The switch
is connected to the main server and handles all Internet traffic coming from outside the campus network. It also routes
traffic to the five main network hubs on campus.
"The biggest box with the biggest connecting pipe in
the system wentbelly-up," manager of user services Robin
Jacobsen said in summary of Tuesday's network problems.
Mark Dumic, manager of networking and systems, did
not know for sure what caused the switch to fail. "We suspect it was a power spike," he said. The power supply to
the server was turned off early Tuesday morning to allow
for maintenance that was supposed to takefive to ten minutes. He explained that switching the power on and off
seems to put stress on equipment, and if a part is going to
fail, it is likely to fail when the system is powered up again.
That appears to have been the case with the gigabyte
switch.
"We certainly understand how important the network
is to [the college] community," Dumic said, noting he will
be trying to "dissect what happened" and work to prevent
similar problems in the future. He noted, however, that
"it's fact oflife that outages will happen."

Dumic said about half the campus network was back

together by one o'clock Tuesday afternoon after a replacement part arrived from Philadelphia. It was only a partial
fix, however, because final repairs could not be completed
until another replacement piece arrived from California
on Wednesday.
In order to restore network services to as much of the
campus as possible before the new switch arrived, Dumic
and others in the computing center spent the rest of Tuesday afternoon scrambling to reroute the network.
"What we did [Tuesday] afternoon involved a lot of
reconfiguration programming on secondary switches,"
Dumic said.

One hundred twenty secondary switches on campus feed
into five main hubs located in Parrish, Beardsley, McCabe,
Sharpies and a service building. These five hubs then feed
into the main server in Parrish, where the failureoccurred.
To route network connections away from the broken
switch, traffic that usually goes through fives hubs was
squeezed through two hubs located on a backup card.
"Unfortunately, this taxed the capacity of the two hubs,
so there were a of couple buildings [that] couldn't get back
on the network Tuesday," Dumic said.
All public areas, as well as McCabe and most dorms were
back on the network by six o'clock Tuesday evening.
Some dorms,however, such as Worth and the Lodges, were
not re-connected to the network until Wednesday morning.
Although inconveniences caused by the outage were minor Jacobsen said one student called the computing center to complain that he couldn't check his stocks online
students who had work saved to their class folders on the
server had difficulties.

open as public areas until 2 a.m. Wednesday morning, providing access to 100 networked computers.

SC advises against changing alcohol policy
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
As part of an ongoing process of scrutinizing
the college's alcohol policy, Student Council submitted a report to the Deans' Advisory Committee Monday outlining its stance that the current

policy should remain unchanged.
According to Dean Bob Gross, the college currently takes the approach of "harm reduction" in
determining the alcohol policy. Under this policy,
preventing danger that comes from excessive
drinking is emphasized over attempting to prevent underage drinking.
The council report was written at the request
of the Deans' Advisory Committee (DAC). The committee specifically charged the council last October torespond to reports that students fraudulently
use college money from the Student Activities Fee
to purchase alcohol. The council was asked to propose a solution to the problem of fraud. A report
issued by DAC in October stated, "If no acceptable
solution is presented, the deans will need to impose restrictions on SAF spending, policies and
practices to address the problem."
The DAC report summarized the findings of a
year-long review of the alcohol policy. The review
was instigated as a part of the fallout from the
undercover police raid at the annual Delta Upsilon Margaritaville party in April 1999 at which 18

Swarthmore students were arrested for underage

Members of the Swarthmore Living Wage Democracy Campaign ask
Student Council to support their campaign at Monday's meeting. The
council did not endorse the committee's petition, but after several hours
of debate, the council approved a brief statement of support for a living

drinking.
In the course of the review, reports of fraud
were brought to the committee's attention, and
the problem of fraud became the focus of the review. DAC madeseveral specific suggestions, such
as having non-students review receipts that are
submittedto the Student Budget Committee (SBC)
for reimbursement for party expenses, randomly
taking inventory of supplies at parties to compare
against the receipts that are submitted, and limiting the stores from which students could buy
party supplies.
Student Council determinedthatsince the 1999

Margaritaville party, sufficient changes have been
made by SBC and the Social Affairs Committee,
the two student organizations involved in the process of funding parties. Official changes on the
level of altering the college alcohol policy, they

determined, are unnecessary.
"The [council] report doesn't call for drastic
changes," said SBC treasurer and council member Marvin Barron 'O2, who helped write the report. Rather, the report encourages the deans of
the college to let the current alcohol policy stand.
According to Barron, the council tried to
strongly express the belief that neither DAC nor
any other entity can come up with a set of regulatory procedures that are "Swattie-proof." He said
that the council also attempted to spell out that it
"would be a mistake" if the college "decides to favor a more draconian approach" to the alcohol
policy without taking into account the procedural
changes that SBC and SAC have independently
made to address fraud. He also felt the college
should consider the possibility that the fraud may

have been overstated.
Associate Dean for Student Life Tedd Goundie
said he had not had a chance to review the council's
report yet, but that he did not expect it to propose
major changes. He said he expected it to propose
means for reducing the possibility of fraud.
A "mutual movement" on the part ofSBC and
SAC to tighten their procedures has been effective
in reducing the possibility of fraud, according to
Barron. "Little changes to system made over the
course of the year have gone a long way," he said.
Efforts at improving communication have
meant that neither group assumes the other has
already screened party requests, "which Barron
said was a "real problem" in the past.
SBC now requires that every request for reimbursement be reviewed twice, and every check
given out must be signed twice. SBC has also be-

Group provides Valentine's Day poetry
Emily Moore, Anna Headley,

afternoon, offering an unusual
service: typing valentine-worthy

After being provided with
information such as names, key
words or phrases, and the
purpose of the poem, the crew
of Small Craft Warnings writers
used a typewriter and their
creative skills to produce
personalized poetry.

By GERRIT HALL
The Web site Virtualßatings.com is now allowing
Swarthmore students to publicly grade and comment on
their professors. Many faculty members have no objection to such a service, though it remains uncertain
whether students will be interested enough to use it.
The site allows registered users to grade professors,
courses and campus life on a scale of zero to ten, with
letter grades ranging from F minus to A double-plus. They
may also write comments. The reviews are placed online,
and anyone may read them. Registration is free, and the
reviews are anonymous, but if somebody claims a comment is libelous, the poster is held responsible.
"All of us at Virtualßatings.com have had some wonderful professors and some not so wonderful ones," Jeff
Roscher, president ofVirtualßatings.com, said in the Daily
University Star, the newspaper of Southwest Texas State

University. "This site is to let themknow."
At some schools, such as Monmouth University, the
service has been controversial. Some faculty members at
Monmouth felt that slanderous comments overextended
the right to freedom of speech. Monmouth considered revoking access to the Web site from university computers
before agreeing to draft informational letters to all stu-

dents.
Swarthmore faculty members, on the other hand, have
not opposed the site.
"As far as I'm concerned, students obtaining information is a good thing," said Bernard Saffran, an economics
professor.
Many faculty members drew comparisons between
Virtualßatings.com and attempts to rate professors that
Swarthmore students have made in the past. In the 1980s,
saidmathprofessor Stephen Maurer, there was 'a printed
evaluation, including commentary" of several professors
as well as a system that utilized e-mail. Many faculty members remember such systems and the problems associated

with them.
"I remember there used to be a hard copy form it
was often not as reliable as word-of-mouth or departmental evaluations," said German professor Marion Faber. She
pointed out that every language course is "regularly evaluated" using more accurate sampling.
"I know a number of faculty at the time who felt that
this was an unhelpful service," said Maurer. He said there
was a feeling that students were "harder on female faculty," though he did not know if this was true.
Maurer also said that a service such as

come more familiar with the vendors frequently used to supply sound and lighting equipment at parties, so it is better able
to judge if a receipt is for a reasonable amount. Barron noted
that it is easier for fraud to creep in on big-ticket items like
sound equipment than on items like food. In some cases, this
has led to crackdowns. Barron estimated that since
Margaritaville, SBC has refused to approve 15 to 18 transactions relating to SAC. For its part, SAC has revised its procedures for applying for funding, and has emphasized that SAC
money cannot be used to buy alcohol.
"There has been an atmospheric change surrounding alcohol policy at Swarthmore," Barron said. "I think students have
been much more responsible. More important than any actual
rules is the atmosphere which surrounds them. It's important
that we make clear the spirit and the letter of the law." He said

that this last point is where there has been a real failure in
the past, and that students have felt that because it was possible to commit fraud, that meant it was institutionalized
and therefore acceptable.
He noted that the flip side of this change over the past
two years has been that studentshave beenresorting to other
means to get alcohol. Also, fewer proposals have been
brought before SAC, and more parties are private.
The Deans' Advisory Committee will be reviewing the
council's proposal within the next month, and will determine what subsequent actions, if any, should be taken.
Barron said it "certainly remains a possibility that DAC will
want stricter alcohol regulations to be put in place."
Dean Bob Gross said to 'expect some change" in the policy.
"I think all deans worry that the danger of an overly zealous
approach to enforcement is that it forces drinking underground,
into a situation in which it can't be monitored," he said.

...

Virtualßatings.com would "not be statistically significant," pointing out that students with stronger opinions
might be more inclined to write extremely positive or negative articles. On the whole, though, he supported the idea.
"I'm in favor of information, because I think it's worthwhile for everybody to know," Maurer said.
Religion professor Ellen Ross did not wish to comment
without a greater understanding of the site, but she pointed
out that ratings would not reflect the amount of work a
student put into a class, making them less useful. She also
said she appreciated "students wanting to let each other
know if they've had good or bad experiences in the classroom."
"In general, [professor rating systems] havebeen tried
at Swarthmore many times," said Saffran, the only pro-

fessor interviewed who had been reviewed online. "It usually dies because students stop caring about it."
So far, most professors, including Saffran, have received very high ratings; students reserved their criticisms
for campus life. Only 18 professors have been reviewed,
and faculty opinion could change if more students were
to use the site.
Whether the site is useful could depend on student interest, which has been less than resounding. Jenn Hart
'O3 prefers to rely on word of mouth than anonymous reviews on the Internet.
"There's something to be said for getting stuff from
people you know," said Hart. Dale Jennings 'O4 agreed,
saying that he 'didn't see the point" of the Web site.

Journalist details Hillary Clinton's senate campaign
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
A modest crowd learned about New
York politics on Monday, when New
York Times Metro section reporter
Jonathan Hicks delivered a speech in
Lang Performing Arts Center.
Hicks began with a history ofhis profession, which he referred to as "worming your way into other people's affairs."
He also discussed the strategies of
Hillary Clinton's victorious Senate campaign, focusing on why she chose to run
when she did and what helped her gain
a seat inthe state of New York.
Hicks began by telling the audience
that he "never, ever thought Hillary
Clinton would run for Senate," especially in light of the failure of her health
care legislation during her husband's
first term as president and the impeachment scandal of 1999.
But her chances of winning were bolstered, he said, by "a great deal of public
sympathy for Mrs. Clinton, who was
seen as a victim" following her

husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Her choice to run in New York depended largely on her standing a good
chance ofwinning there, saidHicks. The
carpetbagger criticism just "did not really resonate with New York City," in
which 40 percent of the population was
born in another country. In general, the
politics of the state "lean toward Democratic," he said.
The favorable sentiment toward thenVice President Al Gore, who won New
York handily on election night, also
aided public opinion of Clinton, Hicks

said. And she could raise "millions and
millions of dollars" for her campaign.
She was also under pressure from influential New York Democrats. Patrick
Moynihan, a senator for 24 years, was
leaving Congress, and the party "really
wanted to pick someone who'd win,"

Hicks said. They expected "typical"
blacks, Latinos, laborers
and women to back Mrs. Clinton.
Meanwhile, Republicans across the
nation were offering to back the race in
New York, hoping to assist "anyone who
would run against Mrs. Clinton."
Democrats

Against this background, Clinton

"immersed herself in a day-to-day campaign" in all 62 counties. She concentrated on upstate and western New York,
largely Republican areas with concerns
about their depressed economies.
Clinton impressed these citizens with
visits to farms and street festivals, where
she would chat and shake hands ''for
hours" while journalists like Mr. Hicks
waited impatiently.
Her status as First Lady, he said, ensured her afforded plenty of coverage.
Due to her fame, "every place she went,

she was on television," which brought

her positive publicity.
Some of the first lady's critics came
out just to see her. Some full-blown Re-

publicans considered voting for her because she was "just so nice."
Hicks also discussed Clinton's Repub-

lican opponents. At first, she stood a
good chance of winning simply because
so many Republicans, New York City
residents and swing voters disliked her
opponent, New York City Mayor

Rudolph Giuliani. Blacks and
Latinos, especially, harbored ill will
toward a man who had defended police on issues of brutality.
But a combinationof prostate cancer, an extramarital affair, and a lack
of interest in the race prompted
Giuliani to withdraw his candidacy.
Rick Lazio of Long Island replaced
him as the Republican candidate.
Perhaps because the candidates'
views did not differ greatly
Lazio
was pro-choice and a political moderate
the Republican's campaign
"seemed to focus on the fact that he
was not Hillary." Lazio, Hicks said,
did not push publicity that "really de-

fined who he was."

Although Hillary Clinton wound

up winning by 12 percent, her victory

was not always so clear."lnitial polls
showed it wouldbe a very close race,"
forecasting a difference of three or
four percentage points, Hicks said.
What helped Mrs. Clinton in the
end was "attention to her bases." Labor rallies and visits to black
churches increased the humber of
her supporters who voted.
Her focus on western New York
was also significant, especially after
Lazio announced, to the anger of some
ofhis constituents, thathe thought the
rural economy had improved.
After witnessing the campaign's
development, Hicks said, a concern
was "how rude the press was going
to be toward her." He was somewhat
surprised, he said, that "they behaved
themselves."

Vandalism damages pricy laser

Water damage destroys $30,000 of equipment in physics laboratory
BY HOFAN CHAU
A case of vandalism in a DuPont bathroom in
in damage to expensive equipment in the laser lab beneath. Although Director ofPublic Safety Owen Redgrave said that the
act may not have been premeditated, the damage
will be costly for the college and will eliminate
opportunities for students taking advanced physics labs.
At 9:15 p.m. on Jan. 26, Public Safety received
notice that there was a flooded bathroom on the
January resulted

first floor in DuPont. All of the sinks and toilets in
the bathroom had been stuffed up, with toilet paper draped between thestalls. Public Safety believes
that the vandalism occurred after 6:30 p.m.
The flooding affected the bathroom, the hallway
and a lecture hall, but the worst damage occurred
when the water seeped through the ceiling into the
laser lab underneath.
According to physics professor Carl Grossman,
the water "rained down on the lasers, auxiliary
optical components, meters and spectrometer
head," causing the most damage to the argon ion
source laser, which costs about $30,000 and is essential for running the lab.
The college acquired the laser six years ago as
part of an experiment to demonstrate the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Grossman said
that it is one of the most popular experiments in
the program. Students will now have one fewer advanced lab to choose from out of the nine currently
offered.
"There is a lot of work to be done" to fix the damage, said Grossman, but there is a chance that the
damage could be repaired this semester.
Grossman said that his initial reaction was
one of frustration. "You work really hard on
something and you are excited and enthusiastic
about it, and some random, infantile prank
trashes it," he said. "This whole thing was really
stupid."

At the moment, Redgrave says thatPublic Safety
has no leads. "Vandals are typically difficult to apprehend, as their actions are usually not premeditated and often take but a brief time," he said. Although Public Safety found some items in the bathroom, they know that the owner of the items did not
perpetrate the act.
How does one prevent vandalism?Redgrave says
that one thing that Public Safety tries to do is correct it immediately. "People who do itlike to see the
results," he explained. Another thing that helps is
to have "a community that is responsive and aware
and willing to notify" Public Safety of suspicious
people or circumstances.

Holt: Congress needs Civility'
BY JONATHAN EHRENFELD
Representative Rush Holt, D-NJ, spoke on campus Saturday, discussing topics that ranged from Congress to his experience on the
Swarthmore faculty. Holt, a Democrat, represents roughly 700,000 people
in New Jersey's twelfth district.
The speech centered on two main issues: the idea of civility in the
government and Holt's academic background, especially at Swarthmore.
The college employed Holt from 1982 to 1989 as a physics professor. A
congressman since 1998, Holt said his time spent in the government has
been "an interesting and also a really satisfying experience." During his
time in office, Holt said, he has increasingly noticed that "civility is
generally lacking" in Congress.
Civility, he said, is "courtesy and conformity with the rules of social
order." In this sense, he explained, it is not mere politeness, but an integral aspect of the working government. A lack of civility can have grave
consequences and is an increasing problem. "It's often to the point now
where it is difficult to work," he said.
As an example of the problems rooted in a lack of civility, Holt described the partitioning of House committees. For one committee on
higher education, Republican representatives took several historically
African-American and Hispanic colleges and placed them in a separate

subcommittee.
The reason for this, he said, was to provide a Republican with a chairmanship. Although he believed such a maneuver slighted the colleges
represented by the committee as well as the House Democrats, Republicans have stuck with their decision, Holt said.
Two weeks ago, Holt attended a meeting with President Bush at the
White House. Along with roughly fifteen Republican representatives
and five Democratic representatives, he was invited to discuss some of
the president's policies. Although Holt says that some Democrats have
censured him for meeting with the President, he believes that open communication across party lines is an integral part of civility and that his
presence at the White House was not inappropriate.
Regarding President Bush's proposed tax cut, Holt said, "I don't think
there's a clear mandate for a SL6 trillion tax cut from the American
people" and indicated he had voicedhis reservations to the president.
Holt, who has been interested in politics from an early age, said he
does not think the trend of incivility stops with Congress. "The deprecation of politics is deeply rooted in American society," he said. Using
former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as an example, Holt explained that when a distrust and dislike of the government is inherent
in those who govern, civility is further degraded, making bipartisan
agreements difficult.
Another negative offshoot of this trend, Holt said, is the fact that
voting procedures around the country do not always allow the will of
the people to be voiced. He cited the continuing trends of voter suppression and intimidation, and he used the example of how votes from predominantly black areas in Florida were much more likely to be thrown
out for irregularities than those of neighboring white districts. He currently has a piece of legislation in the works that, if passed, would standardize balloting and voting procedures around the country.
Holt also discussed issues about the national census. The census is
not assumed to be entirely accurate, so statistics must be applied to the
numbers to correct for the undercount, which traditionally affects poor
and minority areas. Since these areas historically vote for Democratic
candidates, there has been Republican opposition to correcting for the
undercount.
Holt summarized that attaining civility is based upon the enfranchisement of minorities and their representation in the government.
He added that campaign finance reform laws are crucial to curb the
effects of special interests.
In his speech, Holt also spoke about his experience at Swarthmore
and discussedhow an academic background has affected his position in
the government. He said it has been a great asset, from the time he advised the State Department on arms control to the present.
He and a Republican representative from Wisconsin are the only two
House members who hold doctorates in physics, which he says unites
them in castigation of the National Missile Defense (NMD) program despite their otherwise disparate views. The NMD, he said, is a physical
impossibility, a "weapon system in search of a cooperative enemy."
Holt was also the founder of a House caucus on climate change. The
caucus' function was to attempt to illustrate the seriousness of the problem posed by climate change. It also sought to help the United States
become a better leader in the study and prevention of climate change.
Studies have shown that climate change is primarily a result ofhuman
factors, such as carbon dioxide emissions.
As a professor of physics at Swarthmore, Holt was involved in politics in the vicinity of the college as well as in Washington. He cited the
school's encouragement of a broad field of study as beneficial in nurturing activity in politics.
He believes it should be possible for every faculty member and student to be at least somewhat involved in politics. While students' primary emphasis should be study, he said, political awareness and activity are also important. It need not take the form of activism or politics,
he said; reading a newspaper daily would be sufficient.

Senior hopes sugar cane can
reduce water contamination

■ Mill IMl^—■

New dean position created
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Dean Bob Gross recently recognized the position of dean of multicultural
affairs as an official unfilled post, according to Associate Dean and Director
of the Intercultural Center Anna Maria Cobo.
Advocating Diversity and a Variety of Ideologies in a College Environment
(ADVICE), which comprises representatives from various student groups, is
focusing this year on securing a "multicultural dean" for the college, according to former member Lester Tran 'O4. The first step of the process was to gain
the approval of the administration to set up a hiring committee for the dean.
The MC dean, as they refer to the position, would work to better integrate the
cultural pluralism of Swarthmore ethnic, racial, religious and gender-based
into campus life. He or she would work with such institutions as the tri-college pre-orientation program for students ofcolor and the Multicultural Winter
Institute as well as the freshman entry workshops on diversity, said Cobo.
According to Cobo, an MC dean did exist in 1995, but the appointment fell
through due to controversy about the status of the position. Two past efforts
to find a new dean have failed.

Stephen Armah constructs a planter to hold sugar cane plants for an engineering final project.
Armah, who is from Ghana, is testing the plants' ability to reduce water contamination in his country.

BY ELIZABETH HANSEN
Sewer systems and wastewater treatment centers are nonexistent in therural part of Ghana that
Stephen Armah 'Ol calls home. Winter, spring,
summer and fall do not mark the passage of time
in that tropical section of Africa: there are two seasons, wet and dry. Wastewater flows wherever
people throw it. Often, polluted rivulets, running
back into the water bodies of Ghana, carry diseases to the people who draw water from them.
As an engineering final project, Armah is investigating a way to naturally treat the wastewater of
rural Ghana using sugar cane, an inexpensive plant
native to Ghana that uses water year-round.
It is possible to treat wastewater through water treatment or sewage plants, but Armah chose
to focus on natural cleanup systems. His goal was
to find a "cheap, self-sustaining treatment that
used biological and biochemical reactions sustained by natural means," he said, "and was not
damaging to the environment."
For inspiration, he looked to wetlands, which
he roughly defines as a place in which "the water
table stays about two centimeters below the land's
surface." Bogs, peatlands and marshes all qualify
as wetlands.

Armah explained that wetland vegetation

"provides the right substrates" for water treatment. Microorganisms and plants found in wetlands can soak up and metabolizenitrates, phosphates and some organic (carbon-containing) substances, all of which are water pollutants.
Sugar cane was a good candidate for wetland
wastewater-management, Armah says. "I was
looking for a plant that [could] stand in water,
take enough nitrate and phosphate out of the
water, and create favorable conditions for microorganisms to decompose nitrate, phosphate, and
[organic pollutants]," he said.
Fertilizers used by Ghanaianfarmers contain
nitrates and phosphates. During the rainy season,
torrents of water sweep across fertilized fieldsand
become polluted. Urine, feces and kerosene, all organic pollutants, mix into water as well.
The amount of organic material in wastewa-

ter is indicated by its Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), a measure of how much dissolved
oxygen is needed to break down the water's organic substances.
"If water has a lot of carbon-containing substances, itis said to have high BOD loading," said
Armah. All the polluting substances in wastewater will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen
in the water, he said, and the low levels of oxygen
will, in turn, kill fish and cause other harm to
ecosystems.

Armah's goal is to reduce thelevel ofpollutants
nitrates, phosphates, and organics
in wastewater. "Eliminating [these substances] from the water is not feasible," he says.
Armah has designed an experiment to test the
"loading reduction efficiency" of sugar cane, defined as the extent to which the plant can clean
the wastewater. Because sugar cane is sensitive
to the length of day and the temperature, Armah
will be working in the college's greenhouse.
Armah plans to load round stones into a box
divided into two watertight compartments. He will
plant the cane in one half and leave the other
empty. He will fix the rate of water flowing
through the pipes going in and out of thebox ends.
To the in-flow, he will add simulated "wastewater"
water with glucose, fructose and mashed
potatoes for high BOD loading, as well as fertilizer for nitrates and phosphates. He might also
add urine and kerosene.
The wastewater will remain in the 'wetland'
for varying amounts of time, and Armah will measure the pollutant levels of water samples from
near the intake and outtake pipes. The concentrations of pollutants will show how successful
the cane was at treating the wastewater. Tilting
his box at different angles will make it possible to
measure the effect of the slope of a wetland on its
water treatment capabilities.
In the end, Armah hopes to construct graphs
of treatment efficiency versus detention time.
Then, he said, "someone in Ghana can use the

parameters [from the graph] to know the detention time, how long the cane should sit in the
wastewater, for a target efficiency."

Professor Maribeth Graybill confirmed her intention to resign this week,
throwing the art history department into an even greater period of change
than it had been expecting. She declined to comment on her announcement.
Graybill's decision to leave the college accompanied the retirement of professor Kaori Kitao, as well as professor Connie Hungerford's selection as provost of the college, which will prevent her from teaching for five years. The art
department will begin to search for job candidates within the next few days.
Graybill received her master's degree and a doctorate from the University of Michigan. Two students who were interviewed named that institution
as a possibility for her next appointment. At Swarthmore, Graybill teaches
Asian art, with a specialty in Japanese works.
Catherine Osborne 'Ol, who has taken a class and a seminar with Graybill,
described her as "an engaging lecturer" who "clearly loves her subject" and
made a special effort to help students withtheir projects, including offering a
special seminar that catered to their interests.
Laura Wolfram 'O2, who took a seminar on Japanese pop culture, said
Graybill was "definitely one of the most dedicated professors I've ever had;
she really cares about her students." Wolfram commended Graybill for "treating her students as adults" by having the initiative not to shy away from
using historical pornography in her classes to betterunderstand the full range
of prints in the cultural era.

Rash of computer viruses
infect campus last week
BY JON EHRENFELD
Over the past few weeks, two separate viruses
have made their way onto the college network,
infecting many computers of students and faculty.
Computer users have struggled to avoid and
delete the viruses, even as a third one is beginning to infect computers worldwide.
The viruses, called Snow White, or Hybris,
and Romeo and Juliet, or Bleßla.b, are classi-

fied as worms, and they probably originated in
Poland. A worm masquerades as an e-mail message and, once it has infected a computer, sends
itself to addresses in the user's e-mail.
Just reading the e-mails in which both the
viruses arrive can unwittingly spread them. It
is probable that the majority of infected users
accidentally passed the virus on without realizing what it was.
According to dormitory computer consultant
Steve Salter 'O2, "I'd guess just about everyone
got an email... and I'd guess that at least a third
of the campus was infected."
While all users could receive the viruses,
they only caused damage on Windows-based
machines running Microsoft Outlook Express.

"I'D GUESS THAT ABOUT A
THIRD OF THE CAMPUS
WAS INFECTED."
Despite the problems the viruses caused
the Snow White virus, for instance, placed a spiral on the screen that could not be removed
Salter indicated that he did not see the virus as
dangerous to the network as a whole. "Once everyone is up to date [with virus definitionsand
security patches]," he said, "the virus will no
longer be much of a threat."
Computer users may obtain security patches
for the two viruses at www.windowsupdate.com.
In addition, the Swarthmore Computer Center
offers advice and software on its web page.
This widespread infection comes at the same
time that another virus
called the Anna
Kournikova virus, because it promises a picture
of the Russian tennis star is causing millions
of dollars worth of damage to computer systems
worldwide.
Cnet.com News reported on Tuesday that a
Dutch programmer had been identified as the
author of the virus.

CRIME

LOG

Swarthmore Borough Police Report
A construction vehicle parked along Rutgers Avenue had a left rear
window shattered last Wednesday. The damage was discovered the following
morning.
A bicycle theft in progress at the train station was reported Saturday .
When police arrived, they discovered several overturned trashcans and a
silver BMX bicycle on the outbound platform. The bicycle was taken to police
headquarters for safekeeping.
Criminal mischief -was reported during the early hours of Saturday
morning on Park Avenue. A resident said that his door had been kicked in by
a Swarthmore College student. The student acknowledged having caused the
damage and offered to pay.
A driver of a pick-up truck traveling south on Rt. 320 Saturday night was
arrested for driving under the influence. The driver attracted the attention 01
a patrolling officer by alternately slowing and speeding up, and by ignoring a
traffic signal. After pulling the pick-up over, the a strong odor of intoxicants
was detected. The driver failed several field sobriety tests and was arrested.
As the result of a continuing investigation and the cooperation of the
Upper Darby Police Department and Ridley Township Police Department,
chargers were placed against a suspect in two Swarthmore burglaries. The
defendant was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, theft, and receiving
stolen property for the incidents. The investigation of the three other similar
burglaries is continuing.

Public Safety Report
Thefts were reported from the Phi Psi fraternity house on Sunday afternoon.
Thefts were also reported from the C parking lot on the same day.

Tackling the living
wage dilemma
For all the emphasis Swarthmore places on
"ethical intelligence," it is surprisingly rare that we
find ourselves in a real-life situation that challenges
our ethical faculties. But the living wage is precisely
that sort of situation.
Strip the Living Wage Campaign of its rhetoric and
activist bluster, and you'll find that the living wage
has at its core a moral claim. It is a way of expressing
the idea that people have intrinsic value, a fundamental worth that cannot be accounted for by the economic market system. The living wage, then, is an
attempt to correct the market system and to assert
this intrinsic value.
In an ideal world, there might be no need for a
a person's fundamental worth might be
living wage
obvious and acknowledged by the system. But we live
in a practical world, and ironically enough, economics can even put a price on intrinsic value, at least as
defined by the Living Wage Campaign.
And therein lies the dilemma. In its existence as
an educational and cultural institution, the college
should put its money where its mouth is and strive to
treat people as ends in themselves rather than means
to some other end
this is at least a part of ethical
intelligence. Yet the college also exists as an economic
entity
an employer that, despite its sizable financial resources, is still beholden to the market forces

seniority.

In interviews, many staff members have mentioned wanting increased respect and recognition.
Although it is always difficult to legislate morality,
giving staff a greater say in college affairs and making
a better effort to integrate staff into college events
would be a solid start. And thoughtfulness, politeness
and simple respect for the staff on the part of students
would also go hand-in-hand with this administrative
effort.
These are all simpler solutions, approaches to the
dilemma that treat the moral problems of the current
system and at the same time attempt to minimize the
economic impact. There are undoubtedly more
solutions like these out there. If Student Council's
Action Group is more efficient and aggressive than
Student Council itself in approaching the issue, its
efforts will likely result in a comprehensive solution
that can be both morally laudable and economically
tenable in other words, an ethically intelligent
approach to this dilemma.

CORRECTIONS
Last week's article on the engineering department's
hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) had a number of
misstatements.
Chevrolet, not Chrysler, manufactured and donated the
Beretta.
The story read, "Gas cars are run by burning natural
gas." The story should have read, "Gas cars are run
entirely by the combustion of fossil fuels."
Hybrid vehicles do bum fuel, but burn less fuel than
traditional vehicles.
The story read, "In contrast, hybrid electric cars have a

90 percent or greater efficiency and give off no
emissions whatsoever." The story should have read,
"In contrast, electric motors used in hybrid electric
cars can achieve efficiencies greater than 90 percent
with no emissions whatsoever."
Garnet One, not all electric cars in general, cannot
travel much farther than 25 miles on battery power
alone.
Project leader Kiyoyuki Miyasaka's name was spelled
incorrectly as Mayasaki and Miyasaki.

that run the world.
Neither kowtowing to market forces nor denying
the reality of economics is a truly viable option.
Although we support the idea of a living wage
indeed, it's difficult not to think that human beings
have intrinsic value there are significant problems
with the campaign itself: worries about how it is
being run, questions about from where the money for
increased wages would come, and even concern that
increased wages would cause other, more significant
economic problems for staffmembers. And despite the
widespread support among students, the campaign
has nothing close to unanimous support from staff
and faculty.
But ethical intelligence should demand more than
mere acknowledgement of the dilemma. Action is
required, and since the option presented doesn't seem
particularly economically feasible, a compromise is
needed.
A more limited solution can be culled from the
comments of faculty, staffand students. Economics
professor Larry Westphal suggested equalizing the
percentage of the market rate that faculty and staff
are paid (see In Depth, pg. 11); currently, faculty are
paid 102.5 percent of the market rate, but staff only
receive 100 percent of the market rate. There could
also be more room on the upper end of the pay scale
for senior staff to advance their careers, a response to
the complaint that staffaren't rewarded for their

FRESH OFF
THE BOAT
After many years of intense studies, a group of scientists
has detected that among numerous human and computer viruses floating here lies the treacherous Swarthmore Bug. Interviews with researchers and random studentsrevealed the
true nature of the bug.
Researcher One: I have not yet recorded data about any
student who, in four years here, has not been affected by it. A
typical symptom of the Swarthmore Bug is the excessive interpretation ofpeople and their actions.'Somebody says something about the sky and it becomes a personal comment that
hits you on so many levels. Then you become very aware of
your responses and live in some delusional paranoia. For example, people consider that doing anything other than some
type of "productive" workis a form ofprocrastination; consequently, they often measure the opportunity cost of"chilling."
To a large extent, this paranoia becomes real, since the
people around you live it, too. In addition, as the bug becomes
part of everything it becomes essentially undetectable both
as a social and individual phenomenon. Those most contaminated are those that leastknow.
Student: The Swarthmore Bug has plagued me since I arrived as a freshman. I started to feel that everybody could see
right through me, leaving me vulnerableand anchorless. Don't
be misled into thinking that the Swarthmore Bug can only
manifest itselfhere. I came from a distant land and ventured
into another unknown place as I went abroad to escape the

Buggin' out
bug's power. Eventually it tracked me down and displayed itself
through random anxiety and extreme self-consciousness.
Researcher Two: Research shows that, in a number of cases,
less time on campus leads to fewer bug visits. The theory behind
this is that in these cases, immune systems grow stronger and keep
the bug dormant. This idea of the immune system takes me to an
important point: the bug was in most of thesekids even before they
got here, but being here is detrimental to both our biological and
psychological immune systems, as the bug becomes more likely to
take us over. Our psychological immune system is comprised of
things like faith and confidence, things that have little room under
the scrutiny of the critical Swarthmore gaze.
All thesestudents bring their different versionsof bugs that then
mutate into unrecognizable forms in order to escape the detection
of any immune system. I would even venture to say that the atmosphere in the campus nurtures the bug by giving it juices of perfectionism, few distractions, and as many challenges as one is willing
or unwilling to take. It is important to add that some students do
not have an immune system that considers the bug as a foreign
element. They might require pharmaceuticals to assist them."
Student: Lately I have been becoming at ease with the bug. In
fact, I think it resides behind my left ear. Though it still affects me,
pretending to recognize its symptoms makes it less alien, more fathomable and consequently more manageable. The irony is that the
only way to deal withthe Swarthmore Bug is by not dealing with it,
by not worrying about its intrusion in my life.

Religion, faith shouldn't make laws
BY DANIEL MARRIN

On Jan. 22, an executive orderfrom President George W.
Bush halted funding for all overseas groups that counsel,
lobby or provide for abortions. This added to Jesse Helms'
1973 amendment that ended direct United States funds for

overseas abortions.
Now, even groups using their own money for abortion,
perhaps with one wing for abortion clinics and another for
family planning aid and disease prevention, will be totally
denied U.S. funds. The order removes funding from Planned
Parenthood sites in developing nations where abortion is a
legal service, such as India. In addition, family planners in
Nepal, whereabortion is illegal, will have to halt theirefforts
to reform laws that imprisoned a 13-year-old girl for aborting
thepregnancy caused by herfather's rape. To top it off, Bush's
ChiefofStaff informedthemedia that the White House might
close its international office on AIDS prevention.
Many celebrated the order as another battle won in the
war to end abortion around the world, as one step closer to
the total delegalization ofthe killing ofunborn children. One
couple wrote that the Bush order relieved them because they
would no longer be paying "income taxes to organizations
that kill unborn infants in Third World countries." I don't
think they realize the true cost of theiractions: 80,000 women
a year are dying of botched and illegal abortions, and that
number will only increase with the order, as will teen pregnancy and STDs, as organizations funding sex education
along with abortion counseling are denied funding. None of
this enraged me as much as the fact that I did not read or
hear a single voice on campus speaking out against the order. We sat down and shut up, in respect of authority, just as
I did when the local bishop condemned condoms' availability in schools, as if they were causing people to have sex.
As a Christian, I oppose abortion, but I also oppose the
imposition of my viewpoints on women in America and the
world. I am pro-choice and anti-death penalty, a fundamental contradiction to my government. According to one Supreme Court appointee, I support killing the innocent, not
the guilty. Maybe he's right. I also, however, support allowing mothers and fathers to decide whether women should
have children, keeping politics out. I am resolutely against
a criminal justice system that kills our prisoners to demonstrate that killing is wrong.
I criticize a religious institutionthat currently condemns
abortion while dissuading sex education and birth control.
I know many within my own Catholic community who believe Roe v. Wade shouldbe reversed. I will only agree with
them when abortion is an irrational decision. I will celebrate
when Roe v. Wade becomes obsolete, when global income
distribution and health conditions are at an all-time high,
along with sexual education and access to birth control. I
will celebrate when adoption, welfare and family planning
organizations are succeeding as never before. This is not

'J.VJI'UMk

the time.
If I were a member ofa religion that supported family planning
efforts and sex education worldwide or of a country that supported
unlimited welfare availability, raising theminimum wage and vigorous AIDS and STD prevention, I might feel comfortable reversing Roe v. Wade. This is not the case. First, we must face our nation's
hypocrisies concerning birth control and killing.
The hypocrisy in our nation about sex became clear when FOX
banned ads for spermicides during the prime-time series "TemptationIsland." The network argued that they could not allowbirth
control ads when children were watching, yet they allowed a program that openly glorified casual sex, without any supposed medical consequences.
The Bush order turned a blind eye to why women seek to prevent their pregnancies, and it cuts offfunds from the very organi-

zations that would have provided safe abortions. Bush's order
showed thathe is more concerned, as one Philadelphia Inquirer
writer wrote, with "winning the battle thansolving the problem."
Instead of leading, his order will muzzle the most qualified people
abroad from discussing abortion through economic threats. As
an executive order, it likewise shuts our mouths from any say on
abortion.
You might ask, how can I reconcile my Christian beliefs with
the killing of infants? Indeed, every time I say I am pro-choice, the
image of a knife and a newborn comes into my head, along with
indignant pro-life messages. However, while I do see partial-birth

abortion as infanticide, theabortion of a pregnancy is not the same.
The womb is not an anonymous Motel 6 for an infant; it is a living
space within the body of an individual, thinking and breathing
woman. The child is hers, and as such, she should have as many
rights as she does responsibilities.
I don't know anyone, Christian or not, who supports acrossthe-boards abortion. I support the option, the will of responsible
people to make up their own minds and learn from their experiences, God be with them. I support the option until all has been
done to solve that which causes women to seek abortion, and
maybe I will even support the option after that. Ultimately, there
is no way to justify turning my faith into the law that governs a
woman's body.

OUTSIDE
THE BOX

From the campus
mailbag: also-rans
and no starfruit
Outside the Box received a wealth of letters
based on last week's column. Let's go to the
mailbag.

Our first question comes from a Mr. D.
Thomas, who writes, "Do you think I should have
made another attempt at being elected Student
Council President?"
In order to help Thomas with his conundrum, let's
organize our thoughts by looking at where Thomas
has succeeded in the past. Thomas lost when he ran
for appointments chair, College Budget Committee
representative and president. He lost in separate
races when he was a freshman, a sophomore and a
junior. He lost when he campaigned; he lost when
did not. He lost before he had SC experience; he lost
after he had SC experience. He lost when he appealed
to reason; he lost when he appealed to emotion. I suspect that if Thomas were to run against the oak tree
by the tennis courts, he'd lose in a landslide. If he
were to run against Abstain, Abstain would humiliate him oh wait, that happened last semester. Perhaps the only person or concept Thomas could defeat
is the author of this column, who somehow managed
to get crushed by three underclasswomen last election.
Our next question comes from a Mr. C.
Redbeard who writes, "Arrr, I've got scurvy.
Where's the fresh produce Tobias promised?"
For those who did not leave their room during the
month of December, Tobias plastered campaign posters all over campus. Among 7500 other things, she
promised to provide more fresh produce, to build a
light rail system between Sharpies and her dorm, to
forgive Bangladesh's foreign debt and to find Jordan
Bracket a girlfriend. Unfortunately these and 96 percent ofher proposals had already been brought up in
Student Council in past years, and each timeStudent
Council determined that they would force us and our
descendants into debt until Jubileerolls around next
millennium. Either Tobias was irresponsible in not
reading past Student Council proposals, or she was
unethical in craftily engaging in information arbitrage by proffering politically popular yet financially

untenable proposals for selfish political gain. Either
way, Outside the Box is not pleased.
Next a Mr. J. Dolan complains, "I can't
believe The Phoenix Editorial Board let in
Outside the Box it has offended nearly
everyone in the school. I quit this pro-rape
publication."

It is noble to give money to charity and not tell
anyone; it is self-righteous to give to charity and announce it through a bullhorn. It is noble to organize
a voluntary contribution system to help staff out; it
is self-righteous to coercively force everyone to pay
higher tuition because you want to pay wages far
above the marginal product of labor as reflected in
opportunity costs and revealed preferences. It is noble
to quit a sexist Rotary club; it is self-righteous to
throw a public, two-week hissy fit because The Phoenix exercised poor judgement one time and let in a

line that people who didn't understand its context
could misconstrue. Rape is a horrible thing, and when
we see it, we should stand up and fight it with all we
have. But the right way to fight rape isn't to show
how the world how righteous we are when it's not
there it's to give a suspected rapist a fair trial and
not a kangaroo court like so many universities have
done (i.e., Columbia University, where the accuser
unconstitutionally no longer has to face the accused).

Living wage woes
The Living Wage Campaign has at last launched into full swing.
When this mobilization began, I didn't expect that it would cause
much dissent among students on campus. Essentially, the campaign
calls for a wage that would allow people to adequately provide for
themselves and their families without having to juggle multiple jobs
and still struggle to make ends meet. The issue speaks not only to
class but also to topics of race and gender. For instance, I'm sure that
no student or faculty member has failed to notice that almost the
entire housekeeping staff is black and female. The living wage seemed
to me an intuitively worthy cause, one toward which Swat students
would be either supportive or neutral. Indeed, there is a great base
of support for the campaign, demonstrated through much positive
feedback and over 700 signatures on the petition so far.
Naturally, there are dissenters. Some ofthese dissentershave chosen to express their disagreement in useless, disrespectful, even hostile manners. Though they are definitely in the extreme minority,
their asinine behavior can overshadow the outpouring of support
that the campaign has received from most of the campus. Although I
have long since abandoned the Swattie delusion ("That couldn't happen here!"), even I was shocked at the venomous responses of these
few, obnoxious members of the student body.
Take, for instance, the comments that were hand-written on living wage signs in Wharton: "Not Happy? Then Quit" and, in response
to the observation that Swarthmore spends more on its plants than
on its employees, "THEN LEAVE." Those comments were written on
signs posted on the doors through which staffmembers walk every
morning. Now, whether these staffmembers completely agree with
the campaign or not, if they read such comments, they would feel
disrespected and utterly devalued by the very same people whose
nasty messes they clean up every day. Did the person who scrawled
these words not bother to think of those people or just not care?
The living wage was also extensively discussed on that favored
anonymity-granting outletfor Swarthmore's "silenced" right-wingers,
immature idiots, and closeted bigots: the Daily Jolt forum. Some arguments against the living wage took the form of theory-ridden econ
major rants insisting that paying anything more than the market
value for the work of these unskilled laborers would be charity and
Swarthmore is not a charity (God forbid!).
Then, there was the less-intellectual Daily Jolt stance: "Dear Liv-

ing Wagers, nobody wants to sign your FUCKING petition. Go away."
Many of my friends are involved with the living wage campaign. When
I spoke to them about it, they expressed their frustration about the
negative responses that they've received. One friend spoke about the
surprising amount of defensiveness that people have exhibited when
speaking against the campaign. To her, the nature of the issue at
handmakes people feel that if they disagree with the campaign, they'll
be seen as standing against people's rights. This viewpoint gets internalized, leading to guilt and defensiveness that is vehemently expressed. This expression sometimes turns hostile, as exhibited in the
examples I cited above. My friend offered another possible explanation for the strong negative reactions elicited by the campaign: "People
don't want to look at injustice, especially when it's right outside of
their doors." Perhaps it's not that the signs and petitions are economically faulty or just plain annoying; perhaps people are made
uncomfortable by the issues that they bring up.
The following is not addressed to those who, while disagreeing
with the campaign, have expressed this disagreement in constructive and respectful ways or have tried to learn more about the campaign. This is addressed to those who can't find it in them to express
themselves in non-anonymous, non-hostile, dialogue-fostering manners. Do these issues shake up your world a little too much? These
are the people who sustain your life, who cook and serve your food,
who clean up after you, and who allow this campus to function. If
they weren't here to do this "unskilled labor" that you value so little,
I seriously doubt that you'd be able to concentrate very much on the
education that you're here to obtain. Yet you come at the issue with
empty theoreticalarguments that don'tseem to take into account the
fact that we're talking about real people: the workers, their families,
and their children. Alternatively, you attack the students and staff
members of the campaign in bitter, immature, and cowardly ways.
Are you so used to not giving a damn about this sector of the population at Swarthmore and in the world at large that you have no choice
but to react in such a disrespectful fashion? Have you become so comfortable with being blind to the lives of those less privileged than you
that, when confronted with the realities of these lives, you cling bitterly to your ability to keep your eyes firmly shut?

Is hard work not enough?

Council supports living wage, forms action group
Dear Editor:

We agree with those proposing adoption of a living wage policy who think that many staffmembers
at Swarthmore in particular wage workers
do
not enjoy adequate representation in decision-making processes that affect their lives in multiple and
visceral ways. We also agree that the living wage is
an idea with merit that needs to be studied further
in order to determinehow Swarthmore could implement it without jeopardizing employment, benefits,
work loads and the like.
Therefore, we are creating an Action Group within

Student Council to work with the administration to
achieve three things: first, the creation of a new col-

lege-wide committee to evaluate staff compensation
policies at Swarthmore and to recommend changes to
those policies; second, better representation of staff
concerns in existing college institutions; and third,
the release of wage, salary and demographic information by the college in order to facilitate more informed
and tangible discussion of the living wage and its possible implementation at Swarthmore.
We have been working hard over the past three
months to guarantee students receive adequate consideration when decisions are made affecting student

interests; we believe staff members merit the same
consideration when their own interests are at stake.
Student Council

SC member explains dissenting vote
Dear Editor:
This Monday night Student Council voted in favor
of a resolution stating that it supports a living wage.
While six members of the council did vote in favor of
this resolution, there were several who did not. As one
of the dissenters, I wish to state my reasons for not
supporting the majority.
First, I would like to state that I am in favor of improving working conditions for Swarthmore staff. I
believe that staffmembers are too often left out of important decisions that directly impact their lives, and
that they often do not have adequate representation
on college committees. I believe that staff should be
treated as equal membersof our community. And yes,
I believe that the college shoulddo all that it can within
its power to ensure that its employees receive the compensation necessary to support themselves and their

families.

However, I cannot in good conscience support the
living wage proposal as it currently stands. The main
problem with "the living wage" is that its proponents,
in conjunction with the administration, have not yet
determined what it would entail. The Living Wage
Committee presented Student Council various versions of a living wage, ranging from $7.33 per hour to
$22.47 per hour. While the final living wage minimum
would likely be set closer to the smaller rate, it is unclear what implications its implementation wouldhave
for Swarthmore College.
While it may be nice to imagine a college with infinite resources, the fact of the matter is that increased
staff wages will likely come from one of two sources: a
reduction in the budgets ofother college expenditures
or an increase in tuition. Implementation of a living
wage necessarily implies a trade-off: either higher tuition or a reduction in some type of college program

(or the opportunity of creating another college program,
such as loan-free financial aid). Because this trade-off
has not yet been defined, I do not yet feel comfortable
supporting the living wage as it currently stands, as its
effects may be detrimental to important segments of
the Swarthmore community.
Moreover, I feel that thereis a strong possibility that
a living wage would actually harm Swarthmore's employees. While the LWC maintains that it does not support a reduction in the number of staff, such a wage
would almost necessarily result in such a decrease. For
example, in lean economic times, under harsh budget
realities, and under no living wage, the college might
befaced with two ways of erasing a budget deficit: freeze
wages or lay off employees. Most would agree that wage
stagnation is preferable to unemployment, and under
the current system, such a provision is possible.
However, under a living wage
which could be
pegged to some external definitionof a self-sustaining
wage
Swarthmore would not have the freedom to
freeze wages and would be forced to let some employees go. This is not my vision of better employee treatment and this is why I cannot support the living wage

as it now stands.
Proponents of the living wage may argue that the
final conception of a living wage will ensure that all
my fears do not come true. And this is possible. But it
is also possible that programs will be cut and employees will lose jobs. The point is that we just do not yet
know. And until we have better answers, until the living wage is better defined, until we know that the living wage can be effectively implemented without unduly harming large factions of campus, I feel that, especially as a representative body, it is practically and morally irresponsible to endorse such a proposal.

CAMPAIGN
Over 750 signatures have been collected in support of the group's initiatives. But how do staff
members themselves feel about the issues?

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

Last Tuesday, students gathered in the Hicks Mural Room for a teach-in sponsored
by the Swarthmore Living Wage Democracy Campaign. One staffmember showed up.
Campaign organizer Mariah Montgomery 'O4 said that more staff could not attend be-

cause they working for the college, employed at second jobs or home with their families.
Primarily due to the support of the Living Wage Campaign, staff wages at the college
has become a major issue this semester. A recent petition circulated by the campaign
included the signatures of 755 students.
Staff support, however, has not been unwavering. Some staff have accused the student campaign of taking over an issue they do not fully understand. Faculty also have
concerns about the nature of the campaign. Only eight faculty have signed the campaign's
petition, and just 40 staff, out of a workforce of over 600 employees.
Currently, staff salaries are set by the college by comparing an average wage with
wages in local and national labor markets. The hourly wage of a card-swiper in Sharpies
or a housekeeper in a dorm, for instance, is calculated based on the wages of workers in
similar positions around the country. The college also compares its wages with other
educational institutions in the Consortium on Financing Higher Education.
Criteria published by the Women's Association for Women's Alternatives (WAWA),
based in the borough of Swarthmore, said that a living wage "allows a person to be selfsufficient, to meet all her needs without government support." According to their 1998
study, a single parent in Delaware County would need about $l3 per hour to achieve
self-sufficiency Other estimates range from $lO to $l5 per hour, and depend on the size
of the family.

FOUNDATION FOR A LIVING WAGE

The roots of the current living wage campaign go back over a year, when an ad-hoc
committee on long-range staff planning began to research how staff wages were determined and distributed. Last semester, students from the Conscious Consumers group
began talking with staff members about issues important to them. In November, Sam
Blair 'O2 and others met with Melanie Young, Human Resources Director, and in December with members of the College Budget Committee.
This semester, student and staffactivists have been meeting with other staff members, senior staff, and Student Council. Campaign leaders hope to create a dialogue
among all members of the college community about the issue of staff compensation and
participation in decision-making structures. Students and staff also want to begin dis-

cussions with the college's Board of Managers and administrationabout implementing
some of the proposals.
Blair and Montgomery stressed that they see the role of students as listening to staff
concerns and helping in whatever ways they can. "We've been trying to be good listeners," Blair said. "We want to use our privilege as students to advance the concerns that
they brought to us, and to make a space where their voices can be heard."
More than 75 students attended the teach-in last Tuesday, and hundreds of posters
have been placed around campus by the campaign. Supporters believe the college has the
resources and responsibility to make sure that every employee has enough to live on. To
members of the campaign, it is as much an issue of respect as one of income.
The lowest wage category in Swarthmore's fiscal year 2000 pay scale have minimum
hiring salaries ranging from $5.36 to $8.53 per hour. Most employees of Dining Services,
including those who have worked at the college for several years, earn between $7 and
$9 per hour.

Student activists assert that such hourly wages are not adequate to maintain oneself
or a family. According to supporters of the campaign, such wages do not pay for food,
housing, transportation, taxes, and health and child care.
Blair realizes that the issue of staff pay is a contentious one. "Implementation is
indisputably complicated," he said, "but when I look back at the general principle

that everyone should be able to support themselves and their families on what they
make it's pretty simple. It just makes sense."
STAFF MEMBERS SPEAK OUT
While most staffmembers interviewed supported higher wages for staff, there was
no general agreement regarding the living wage campaign specifically.
Kae Kalwaic, an administrative assistant in the education department, has been one
of the campaign's strongest supporters.
She believes that the campaign has been a thoughtful and concerted effort. "Students see stafftreated in a certain way, as not respected," she said. "Students are looking for a real community atmosphere, where everyone has a voice to participate in
decisions affecting their lives, where all are free to speak out on issues."
Kalwaic said that she welcomes the efforts of the campiagn's organizers. "The greatest part of working on labor issues at Swarthmore," she said, "has been working with

students on campus."
Kalwaic views the issue of a living wage as one affecting not just staff, but the entire
college community. "If the college modeled its principles of social justice by treating
staff well, that would affect the tenor of the whole campus," she said.
Kalwaic feels that many staff enjoy the positive working conditions at the college.

Diverse views on living wage
From LIVING WAGE, pg. 11
She believes, however, that the
lack of adequate pay and inclusion in decision-making processes show little respect for the
importance of staff on campus.
"One way Swarthmore could

show itself as a true leader in
social justice is to model those
principles in the ways it treats
all people on campus," she said.
"A living wage would be indicative of respect."
Hamza Wali, an Environmental Services employee in Martin,
also sees a link between the living wage and respect. Wali feels
that Environmental Services staff
are not treated with the level of
respect that should beaccorded to
them. He views himself as a professional, and he noted that his
job requires knowledge ofchemicals and the operation ofmachinery. He said that more respect
should be given to such work in
the college and in society at large.
Wali, who has strongly sup-

ported the campaign for a living
wage from the beginning, said it
is simply a way "to put fairness
into practice."
With wages at current levels,
some staff have had to hold down
two jobs to make ends meet.

Kalwaic believes that a gap exists between the college's philosophy of social justice and the re-

ality of staff pay. While the college supports a tutoring program
in Chester, she noted, it pays staff
wages that are not adequate without another source of income.
"Tutoring kids might be well-in-

tentioned," she said, "but we

need to help the families be
present for their children."
Wali said he enjoys working

at Swarthmore and that working
in Martin "feels like part of a
family." But Wali said he has
struggled to meet all of his living needs. Currently, he attends
night school three times a week
at a Delaware County community college after a full day of

work in Martin. Before he enrolled in the community college,
Wali said he often had to work
up to 14 hours per day eight
hours at Swarthmore and five to
six hours at other jobs.
According to Michelle Hartel,
a Dining Services employee who
works in the Kohlberg Coffee Bar,
the staff "just want something decent." While she does support the
campaign in principle, Hartel was
concerned that many newly hired
employees receive wages close to
those of experienced employees.
"How are they going to work out
that an employee making $l6 per
hour has been herefor nine years,
and they're hiring a new employee for $14?" she asked.
Hartel said experience does
not seem to play a large part in
determining staffsalaries. "Essie
Mae was here for 39 years, and
when she left [five years ago] she
made $10.50 an hour," she said.
"I know that students are the
-

12

number-one priority," Hartel said,
"and that's the way it should be." But
she said that staff are also extremely
important to the college. She questioned the level of respect "when
you've beenhere 16 years and you're
making the same as a new employee."
Hartel also noted that "students'
salaries are higher than some of the
employees' [salaries]." Having

heard arguments that not many
people were being paid on the lowest pay scale, she questioned the reasoning behind its existence. "If they
say, 'Well, nobody makes $5.75,' then
why have it? Eliminate that level,"

"A LIVING WAGE
WOULD BE
INDICATIVE OF
RESPECT"
she said.
Melanie Young, the director of
Human Resources, pointed to what
she called a strong benefits package
that staff receive. The package includes a $2,200 "bank" of options
that staff may choose to take as additional pay.
Wali agreed that"the benefits are
grand." But, he said, "you can't live
on benefits." He would like to work
at Swarthmore until he retires, but
isn't sure thatthere's room for much
advancement at the college.
Not all staffmembers are as supportive of the campaign as Wali and
Kalwaic. An employee from Environmental Services, who asked not
to be identified, said that she is "satisfied with the way things are."
"I'm not against a living wage,"
she said, "but I am against the way
in which it has been presented." She
said thatthe campaign has relied too
heavily on strong-arm tactics. In addition, she is concerned that some of
the information presented in posters
around campus gives an inaccurate
representation of staff working here.
The employee felt that many staff
in Environmental Services were
never given an idea of just what the
living wage proposal was, or where
the money would come from. These
concerns were echoed in Monday
night's Student Council meeting (see
sidebar), whenmembers agreed to endorse the campaign in principle only.
"It's not that I'm completely opposed," the staff person said, "but
the timing doesn't seem right." She
also believes that supervisors
should have been included in the
campaign. Overall, she said, "I think
there needs to be more honesty."

As for communication between
staff and the administration, the
Staff Advisory Council (SAC), which
makes recommendations to President Al Bloom, is one avenue by
which staff concerns can be aired.
Kalwaic noted, however, that be-

cause the staff council is advisory
in nature, it has no final say in how
decisions are made at the college.
"We basically don'thave much voice
in decision-making," Kalwaic said.
Hartel is cautiously optimistic

about the council. "SAC has come
a long way," she said. But she, like

Kalwaic, feels that it could only
promote staff concerns on a limited
basis.

Kalwaic also said that some staff
may be reluctant to talk to Bloom

or others about their concerns, because they are afraid oflosing their
jobs. She believes that the administration "should do something positive to show commitment to free
speech, to making people feel comfortable voicing their concerns."

ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE
At this point, the college's administration seems willing to listen to the arguments for the living
wage. Paul Aslanian, vice president for finance and planning, declined to comment, citing a busy
schedule. Director of Human Resources Melanie Young, however,
did agree to talk about staff issues.
Young, who was hiredlast April
after the top position in human resources had been vacant for over
a year, said she has "been working at a pretty furious pace" since
arriving at Swarthmore. She attributed much of that to the "pentup demand" created by the absence
of a director. Her predecessor, Barbara Carroll, resigned in March
1999 after less than three years on
the job.
Since arriving, Young said she
has addressed some of what shefelt
were the main concerns of the staff,
and is looking forward to continuing that trend. She is beginning periodic staff training seminars on a
wide variety of subjects, from supervisor training to simple financial planning. Young said this ini-

PLAN."

tiative is in response to a number
of staff concerns.
"They were dissatisfied in the
lack of opportunities for personal

development," she said. The staff
community, according to Young,
will decide the type of training to

be offered.

Young said that salary issues
came up only after the most pressing concerns were ameliorated. "I
didn't hear about the living wage

until last fall," she said.
Last semester, Young was busy
with issues that fell "outside the
budget cycle," such as working on
a new staff handbook and develop-

ing a new vacation policy. Now that
next year's budgeting is wrapping
up, Young wants to have a "re-evaluation of the compensation system."
The living wage issue, she said,

wouldbe a part ofthat examination.
"By this time next year, there
will be a new compensation plan,"
Young said.
Much of the controversy surrounding the staff wages hinges on
the Full Market Value, or FMV, of
the college's staff salaries. The
FMV measure is unique to
Swarthmore, according to Young.
In the normal business world,
she said, each company has a beginning, middle and high pay rate
for each pay grade. Each job is in a
grade, and each grade has a range
of possible pay rates. Every employee is placed in one of the
ranges based on experience and
skill level. Most businesses compare the middle rate to the average middle rate in the market.

but he doesn't believe that
Swarthmore can resolve low wages
by itself. "[lt's] a social problem, and
needs to be solved on the national
level," he said.
Most economists, according to
Westphal, agree that significant increases in minimum wages would
have negative consequences in
terms of employment, although he
added that the area is still controversial. Westphal said that economists do not yet know the magnitude
of effects that minimum wage increases have on employment, but he
does not think it is "wise to monkey

around with market forces." He
asked, "Who's to determine what a
'just' wage is?"
A better approach to combating
poverty, according to Westphal, is
the earned income credit. Although
the economics is somewhat compli-

cated, the earned income credit is
effectively a negative income tax for
working people below a certain income level. Those below a certain income would receive cash payments
instead of paying an income tax.
Most economists, said Westphal, regard the earned income credit as a
positive option because it doesn't
distort marketplace incentives.

Swarthmore's current staff
wages are based on market comparisons with similar employers in the
Philadelphia area. Swarthmore is
considered to be a decent place to
work in the area, Westphal said. Addressing whether college staff are
paid appropriately, Westphal said
that he believes they are paid similarly to what they wouldmake in the
general marketplace.
But Westphal was highly critical
of one area of the college's labor
practices, citing the distinctionthat
is regularly made between meeting
targeted wages for staff and faculty.
Faculty pay is targeted at 102.5 per-

cent of the commensurate market
rate, and this goal is usually met
or surpassed, Westphal said. By
contrast, staffs targeted wages are
only set to 100 percent of the market rate, and have not always been
met, according to Westphal and college pay records.
Westphal said he is "galled by
this invidious distinction," adding,
"Swarthmore is no less demanding
on staffthan on faculty."
Westphal said he is impressed
that students are concerned about
these issues butfeels there are some
problems with their arguments. He
criticized students as being insensitive to the lawsunder which the college andBoard of Managers operate.
Board members' first responsibility,
Westphal said, is to ensure that the
college will be just as viable in the
future as it is at present.
"If there is a trade-off between
the present versus later generations," he said, "it cannot be made
at the expense of the future."

Students shouldknow where the

money will be coming from,
Westphal said, rather than just
assuming that the college's en-

dowment is infinite. "There's a
trade-off," he said. "Students ad-

vocating a living wage must also
think about where to make cuts."
Some faculty were impressed

that students are involved in the

living wage campaign.
Ken Sharpe, professor of po-

litical science, attended the
teach-in held last Tuesday.
Sharpe said the homework done
by the group was excellent. "It's
extraordinarily valuable that
students are looking at how issues they're studying affect their
community."

The campaign is something
that he would expect of
Swarthmore students, said
Sharpe. Students who have gotten involved, he said, can better
understand the daily lives of
those who make it possible.
"[They] learn to not take staff
people for granted."

After more than two hours of discussion Monday night, Student Council endorsed the statement,
"Student Council supports a living wage at Swarthmore." Three members voted against the resolution.
The council decided not to support the petition for the Swarthmore Living Wage Democracy Campaign,
which was presented by campaign organizers at the meeting. The petition was signed by 755 students, 40
staff members, eight faculty and one alumnus.
The council also unanimously approved a proposal by Marvin Barron 'O2, student groups advisor, to
create a subcommittee to investigate prioritizing staff budgeting, increasing staff representation and
obtaining information from the administration. The proposal was worded specifically to avoid the phrase
"living wage."
Barron said he felt the council should not take a stance either for or against the campaign. "In my
mind, it would be a great harm to activism at Swarthmore," he said.
Many council members expressed concern over the specific details of the campaign's proposal.
Members wanted to know how a living wage is calculated for each staff member, how many workers fall
into each wage category, where money would come from to raise staff salaries and how to keep
distinctions between experienced and new employees when entry-level wages are increased. Members of
the campaign, however, were not sure that the information would be made available to them by the
administration.
Colin Moore 'O2, co-chair of Student Council, cautiously approved of the campaign. "I don't think we
can skirt our responsibility to come to a decision in one way or another," he said. In addition, he said, not
taking a stand would "make us look like a weak organization."
Members of the campaign were not impressed by the council's action. "To say you need to get all the
specifics, you're missing the boat, and when you make your decision, it won't be an issue anymore,"
Mariah Montgomery 'O4 told the council.
Poulami Roychowdhury 'O3, the council's secretary, called for a vote on the statement at the end of the

Blending traditional with modern
Dance troupe Fist and Heel
fuses jazz, ballet, gospel

Swarthmore dance professor Sally Hess set herself to
bringing the Reggie Wilson Fist and Heel Performance
to Swarthmore after seeing them at New York's Dance

bines theater, music and dance, creating what Hess called a "wonul weave" in his company. Fist and Heel pieces explore common elets of African-American and native African religions, as well as issues of
and gender in America. Throughout their New York show, the company

Wilson named his company "Fist and Heel" after the derogatory label, "fist
heel worshipping," that termed the worship style of slave Christians in the

Looking for Black History Month celebration?
Don't head to Philadelphia Museum of Art
BY MORGHAN HOLT
I accompanied a friend to the Philadelphia
Museum ofArt this weekend and was shocked
by what I found, or, rather, what I didn't find
there. Aside from enjoying my pal's company,
I tagged along primarily because I figured the
museum would be hosting a special exhibit
in recognition ofBlack History Month. After
following my friend awhile, scouring the
walls and maps for any indication of a Black
History, or even African-American, exhibit,
I gave up and asked a
nearby museum employee where I could
find the Black History
pieces. The black
woman looked at me
incredulously and
snorted, replying that
they didn't have one
but that I could, if I
really wanted to, find
African-American collections at the AfricanAmerican Museum of Philadelphia, which, she noted, was

not that far away.
Bewildered, I walked with my
friend through the Asian art, the Japanese and
Chinese section, the European collection and
the American wing and encountered only a few
pieces that depicted African-American people
and themes of oppression, prejudice and slavery. But no collection. And how was I, uncultured as I am, to know whether the artists of
these pieces were themselves African-American without actually knowing their names?
Maybe that, in the greater scheme of
things, doesn't matter. What's really important is that the artists conveyed their mes-

sages. Still, I remain disturbed by thefact that
the museum chose not to feature an exhibit

in conjunction with Black History Month, not
because I think African-American work
shouldbe separated from other artists' work,
but because I think it deserves recognition
as distinct, meaningful and cultural, just as
the Philadelphia Museum of Art chooses to
recognize the distinct works of Eastern Asia
in an entire wing. This month is as good a
time as any to celebrate the many accomplishments and contributions of African-Americans in the world of
art. African-American art has its own
style, feel and story.

cause we need to dwell on racial differences,
but because we need to remember black history in Americaand how it hasn't been a treat.
For an excellent display of AfricanAmerican art, featuring such artists as
Swarthmore's own Syd Carpenter, Curlee
Raven Holton, Howardena Pindell and Betye
Saar, visit the African-American Museum in
Philadelphia. It's definitely worth your
while, and regardless of the Philadelphia
Museum of Art's position, these works do deserve some special recognition.

It's not something
that's colorblind,

easily recreated by

any old artist.

African-American art,
like African-American music (what
would we be without
the likes of 8.8 King,
Billie Holliday, Lil' Richard or the contemporary Toni
Braxton? A buncha white folks
struggling to unbreak our hearts
without the help of rhythm or blues), expresses life from an entirely differentperspective.
African-American art deserves the recognition that other cultural collections—Chinese, Japanese, European—receive. And,
while I was upset by the lack of a specific section withinthe Philadelphia Museum's exhibits, I was more appalled by the fact that this
museum, in Philadelphia of all places, neglected to recognize the importance of Black
History Month, which is significant not be-

If only he was 'Human': Stewart's latest a bomb
BY TED CHAN
In an attempt to revitalize his sagging career, Rod Stewart attempts a bold transformation to a soulful R&B style with his new
CD "Human." If you thought for a second that
this would work, you are probably 52 years
old and have a pinup of Rod in tight pants
with floppy hair from when he was the
world's sexiest man (no joke) in 1873.
Stewart's new sound isn't too bad, strangely,
but overall the CD is crushed by lyrics that
range from insipid to vacuous, and are, above
all, cliche. I had to check to make sure Britney
Spears didn't write most of the songs.
Now, Rod Stewart is supposed to be sexy.
This CD is supposed to be sexy, just like every one he made before was supposed to be
sexy. And it just may be, for someone who
doesn't understand English. Contrary to
what my female friend who listened to the
CD with me said ("Worst...CD...ever"), I expect that some cuts from "Human" will garner major airplay on soft and adult rock sta-

tions. Stewart does have that type offollow-

ing. However, just because it might pad his
already bulging pocketbook does not mean
ole Rod should be proud to have his name

associated with the music involved.
Stewart, whose fans tend to be as white
as the driven snow and getting up there in
years, tries hard to reach out to a younger,
more diverse crowd. It's most evident in
Stewart's teaming with flavor-of-the-month
Macy Gray, who does a duet with Stewart,
and can be heard doing background vocals

in the rest.
Not coincidentally, "Human" has two
tracks that are most likely to succeed among
listeners, and neither one is written by
Stewart. Former New Radicals frontman
Gregg Alexander co-wrote the record's first
released single, "I Can't Deny It." It has a
very New Radicals feel in beat and flow, but,
like the rest of the CD, the lyrics are soulless and tepid.
The title track "Human" has a nice R&B
vibe and isn't bad for about 15 seconds, but
the reprise is stupid and once again, the listener can't relate Stewart to the words he is
singing. For those 15 seconds, you think the
CD might be good, until Stewart says, "Am I
rooted to the ghetto? Maybe I should let go."
Come on, are you kidding me? Rod Stewart
and the ghetto? Has he ever set foot in a
ghetto? Would he survive five seconds in
one? You can earn listeners with a reinvented feel, but you need songwriting to win
credibility. "Human" is sorely lacking. Personally, I've always believed Stewart's best
period, in
phase was his early folkisb
which his songwriting was rough and uneven, but deeply personal, as in "Maggie
May" and "Reason to Believe."
It's worse yet. Rod Stewart's imitation of
Slim Shady, "Hello, allow me to introduce
myself, I am smitten" is cheesy. "I Can't
Deny It" is the last track. If I hadn't checked
the Stewart website out, I would never have
gotten to it. His duet with Macy Gray is nothing special and the entire middle of the CD
ranges from non-descript to flat-out bad.

Rod Stewart attempts to reinvent himself in the twilight of his career, but fails,
with songs and musicians that are synergism
It isn't so much that any one track is retic with his sound and background. In the
ally that bad, because the instrumentals are
solid, and Stewart's voice still sounds good. process, he's created another $3.99 Ames
It's just that Stewart hasn't aligned himself clearance coaster.

'Silence of the Lambs' sequel a disappointment

somnia-inducing desire to know what happened next. Scott's
burning question, specifically, seems to be, "Do Clarice and
Lecter ever get it on?" It's tantamount to necrophilia: screwing something that can't resist and producing from the encounter a bastard child. But half-legitimate in this case may
be an overstatement.
"Hannibal" picks up the thread of the life ofClarice Starling (Julianne Moore). Moore has the difficult task of embodying not only the porcelain Special Agent Starling, but
Jodie Foster (Starling's previous incarnation) as well. In a
way, the casting works. Moore combines fragility with indestructibility, and she pulls off the southern accent. She looks
brittle, as though years ofunchecked abuse by her male coworkers and FBI superiors have taken their toll.
Indeed, almost a decade later, Starling's office is little
changed. She is still surrounded by unappreciative boors.
One in particular, Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta), is a misogynist whose unfruitfulattempts to seduce her havemade him
frustrated, bitter and willing to sabotage her career. Add a
PR disaster that is unfairly pinned on her and a tip-off that
Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is out ofretirement, and Clarice
Starling has a lot to contend with.
Her biggest obstacle by far, however, is the script. Everything that was left to the imagination in the original is shamelessly exploited here. Lines like "corn-pone pussy" are tossed
around to no great dramatic effect. Lecter spouts so many

Science

fiction

field day

This Saturday afternoon,
science fiction fans won't have
to read Robert Jordan alone
anymore. At 2:00 p.m., "a guy
who likes Dune" will offer a

four-and-a-half-hour screening
of "Dune," a sci-fi epic based on
the book by Frank Herbert.
Dune is Herbert's brilliant and
disturbing portrayal ofa mythi-

cal world. The novel presents a
scathing commentary on our
modern political system and describes drug-infested religious
fanaticism which more than
loosely resembles the story told
in the Qu'ran. The novel's true
merit, however, lies in the complexity of its characterization.
The 450-page novel reads like a
primer on human psychology.
This film version of "Dune,"
made for the Sci-Fi Channel
and broadcast in three commercial-infested segments of two
hours each last year, is wonderfully true to the book. Unlike
the 1984 David Lynch movie
"Dune," the Sci-Fi Channel's
miniseries conveys the intensely personal nature of the
conflicts in the novel. Unlike
most science fiction, "Dune"
has something to offer everyone. If you
don't find dragon-sex
attractive, you might
still enjoy this motion picture event.

BEING THE BALL]
with Joe Gerlitz I

The aesthetics of sport
Hey there sports fans.
I have been told that my last article, despite its humorous bent, came across mostly as a bitter tiradeagainst

the administration and the culture ofSwarthmore Col-

lege.

That's not what I want my readers to think I'm all
about.
I'm not here to go off at the administrationfor screwing up my life.
I'm not here to simply criticize Bob Williams purely
for my own amusement.
I'm not here to point out that what we pass off as a
culture here at Swarthmore is little more than the interaction of a bunch of half-crazed liberals pissed that most
of the student body is a mass of apathetic drifters.
I'm not here to write about those things.
I'm here to write about sports.
And from now on we're going to keep everythingpositive. No more "coming down" on Swarthmore athletics.
It's time to focus on what is right about Swarthmore's
approach to intercollegiate sports.
Sport, traditionally, has been particularly focused on

aesthetic beauty. When the Greeks used to wrestle and
run around naked, they did it because they thought they
looked good, not because they couldn't inventa jock strap.
As my buddy Olafemi James can attest to, if you're playing street-ball in West Philly, it doesn't matter how bad
you lose as long as you look pretty. No one's going to remember the score, but they'll remember how you took
Tyrone to the hoop and talked shit in midair as you twohanded it down.

One goal ofathletic competition has always been to
showcase physical prowess and dominance over competitors. As women have entered the realm of competitive
sport over the last 30 years, they have been given the same
opportunity as men—the opportunity to show off. If you'll
notice, nearly all athletic events are fought between members of the same gender. You can call me Freud, but I'm
saying sports are all about sexual competition.
So anyway, this week we're going to look at women's
athletic attire here at Swat. There are a few highlights,
exemplary examples of women's uniform which really
bring a lot to their sports, and to the ladies that play them.
First off we have the women's tennis team. I think
everyone can appreciate how much wearing short white
skirts doesfor the game. Just take a look at the most popular woman in tennis right now, Anna Kournikova, a.k.a.
Boxcar's sister. She barely wears a skirt at all! It's more
like a body suit. And what a body, eh? See? Aesthetics!
Other skirt-wearing teams: women's field hockey,
men's and women's lacrosse, women's badminton and
the soon-to-be-chartered cheerleading squad.
And then there's the women's swim team. Functionality meets revealing in an eye-pleasing, skintight piece
of superior, chlorine-resistant 80 percent Antron® nylon/
20 percent Lycra® spandex. Frankly, I'm surprised our
ladies' meets aren't better attended.
But one team alone stands out at the top of the spandex
wearing crowd. The women's volleyball team. Whoa boy.
If you haven't seen themjogging around theindoor track,
well you're missing out. Frankly I have no ideahow they
get those shorts on. I'm just thankful they try.
That leaves women's soccer, basketball, softball and
the various women's track teams. Though track does a
decent job with the spandex, I'm afraid the other two leave
something to be desired.
Women's soccer, basketball and softball are full of
good athletes and good-looking ladies. It's just that, on
the level of aesthetic sportswear, they're simply not as
competitive. But this shouldn'tbe considered the women's
fault. If this athletic program wants to continue to show
leadership on the Division IE level, women's athletic uniforms can certainly be one avenue for innovation and
progress. Soccer: thinkBrandi Chastain.
Again, I'm very willing to help out Mr. Williams. They
should hire me as his assistant. But since they won't I'm
more than happy to offer my advice for free, pro bono.
Why?
Pure and simple. The love of the game.
Keep on lovin' the game.
Yours truly,
Lane "Hide the women and children" Oatey

Depth and experience aid Garnet tennis
BY MIKE

NOREIKA

The men's tennis team kicked off the
season last weekend at
Swarthmore's Mullan Center. The tournament featured a melting pot of talent,
with all three NCAA divisions represented. The strong Division I squad from
Villanova made the journey down 1-476,
and Division II powerhouse Kutztown
came from across Pa. The season's inaugural tournament also marked the rebirth
of head coach Mike Mullan's reign as he
returned from a semester sabbatical. After three weeks of practice, the Garnetfelt
ready to step it up and face the early-seaspring

son, divisionally superior competition.
In the highly regarded A-flight, Pete
Schilla 'Ol defeated a tough Villanova opponent before succumbing to a nationally
recognized foe from Kutztown in a hardfought match. The now-healthy JohnThomas 'O3 destroyed his first-round opponent
before falling to another one ofKutztown's
prized internationalrecruits. The doubles
tandem of Schilla and Thomas breezed

through the round-robin draw and won a
hotly contested match in the final to claim
the first hardware of the spring season.
Justin Singer 'O3 and Jayson Yost 'O3
held their own in the B-flight. Yost, playing through an aching back for the entire tournament, fared well in both ofhis
matches, but played without the noteworthy results he is capable ofwhen fully
healthy. Singer also had a strong showing against the difficult depth of
Kutztown and Villanova, losing two
matches that came down to only a couple
of points. Yost teamed up with Scott
Grant 'Ol as the Garnet's second team in
A-flight doubles. The two played wellthis
weekend and are anticipating critical
wins at the No. 2 doubles spot throughout the course of the season.
Tri-captain Grant came from out of

the shadows as the feature player in the
C-flight singles. Playing in the No. 6
singles spot this season, the senior
proved to be too much to handle for the
competition, due to a solid serve and penetrating groundstrokes. In the other
wing of C-flight singles, Frank Visciano
'O4 played two tough matches before
yielding to the eventual runner-up from
Kutztown, despite controversy over his
line calling. Visciano teamed up with
Singer and glided to the B-flight doubles
final, where they won against an overmatched Villanova twosome.
On the flip side of B-flight doubles,
Mike Noreika 'O4 and Joey Spadola 'O4
paired up for the first time in competitive play. They lost a tough match against
the runner-up Villanova duo, but de-

feated interteamrivals Ben Rae 'O4 and
Joe Dickerson 'O4, who were provisionally playing for Kutztown, due to a
shortage of players.
D-flight singles were filled with Garnet players, due to the team's rather long
roster this season. Aaron Rubin 'O4 successfully coped with a sore shoulder, defeating fellow Garnetfreshman Spadola.
Ben Rae won the D-flight singles title for
the Garnet. In other singles matches,
Dickerson and Ben Keys 'Ol showed
promise against obstinate Villanova foes.

Though the season is just getting un-

der way, the Garnet are hopeful for a
return trip to the coveted Division 111

town. The game was complete with last-minute comebacks, player
ejections, acrobatic catches, ungodly hits and plenty oftrash talking.
Xtreme WR Jermaine Copeland repeatedly disobeyed gravity to
make clutch circus catches enroute to a 17-reception, 190-yardperformance. Ex-Eagle WR and current Xtreme wideout David Dunn made
a last-minute catch in the back of the endzone and was instantly annihilated by a frustrated Enforcer. The fact that Dunn's head is still
attached to his body defies the laws of physics.
This was a proverbial nail-biter that helped to establish guys like
Copeland and Tommy Maddox as legitimate professional players and,
more importantly, the XFL as a legitimate professional football league.
I was quite impressed. That's not to say that one incredible game will
save the league, but it should help to quell the anguish of American
sports fans whobelieve hockey is best left up to inferior nations like
Canada and Russia and are sick of the NBA's prima donnas. Stay
tuned. The NFL might have a little competition after all.

In last week's home meet against Washington College,
the men's swim team fell 103-97. The men's meet startedwith
Mike Dudley 'O3, John Lillvis 'O3, Eric Shang 'O4 and Chris
Bussard 'O3 winning the 400-yard individual medley relay
(3:46.55). David Whitehead 'O3 was a double winner in the
200-yard freestyle (1:48.91) and 200-yard butterfly (2:02.95).
Sprinter Jason Kerensky 'O3 scored with a second in the
50 free (23.93) and a third in the 100 free (52.05). Despite Dudley's
first place in the 200-yard backstroke, the team needed to win
the 200-yard breaststroke to clinch the meet. But Shang placed
a close second with a 2:20.02. Posting a time of 3:2160, the men
closed the meet with a win in the 400 free relay.
The Garnet women went head-to-head in every event
against the Shorewomen. Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol, Alice
Bonarou 'O2, Natalie Briones 'O3 and Davita BurkheadWeiner 'O3 set the tone with a win in the 400 IM relay in
4:10.99. In the 1000 free, Amy Auerbach 'O2 placed second
(11:15.81) with Meredith Leigh 'O4 finishing third (11:16.39).
Sprinter Leah Davis 'O4 posted a first place in the 50 free
(26.01) and a third place in the 100 free (58.10). Double winner Bonarou stole the 200 IM (2:16.29) and the 200 fly (2:2L96).
The meet came down to the very last event: the 400 free
relay. Davis, Tara Trout 'O4, Krista Gigone 'O4 and Auerbach
finished first by a full L3l seconds. Then Gigone, consumed
with joy, accidentally fell into the pool. The meet officials
judged this accidental re-entry as intentional and illegal
according to NCAA rules. The Garnetwas disqualified, and
the second-place Shorewomen were given the win. Although
the Garnet out-swam Washington, they lost the meet 110-95.
"I was overwhelmed with disappointment after such a
valiant effort against what is considered the deepest and most
talentedconference team," said Head Coach Sue Davis. "The
score by no means reflects the reality of the meet."
The Garnet head to the Centennial Conference Championships on Feb. 16-18 at Franklin & Marshall.

Track teams spurred on by home crowd

ON THE
PLATFORM

BY MARK JANOFF
Last Saturday, in our backyard, the
indoor track and field team competed
against teams fromfive other schools at
the annual Swarthmore Invite. Track
loyalists and Swarthmoreathletic enthusiasts lined the track for the home meet
to cheer on their friends and peers, and
the fans witnessed solid performances
by both the men's and women's teams.
Captain Sarah Jay 'Ol said the raucous home crowd had a positive impact.
"It really makes a difference when the
community acknowledges what we do
and urges us on to victory," she said.

Sports, parties
and moving on
As I was eating in Sharpies the other day, I started
thinking about something that I had forgotten about
the football table. You know, the first one on the
left as you walk into the big room. At the beginning
of first semester, with football season in full swing
and the hopes high for a big turnaround in fortune,
the table was filled to the edges. Then the Board of
Managers dropped the bomb and now the table is halfdeserted as the players prepare to join other teams

This difference showed in the weekend's

results.
Jay dominated the women's 3000meter race, finishing the race in under
11 minutes. Marc Jeuland 'Ol had yet another successful outing, finishing first
in the men's 1500-meter and second in
the men's 800-meter. In addition, star
sprinter Imo Akpan 'O2 placed first in the
women's 55-meter dash; Jokotade
Agunloye 'Ol placed first in the women's
5000-meter; and Njideka Akunyili 'O4
continued her promising sprinting,
notching fourth place in the women's
400-meter. Unfortunately, talented newcomer Erik Munroe 'Ol had to sit out the
meet due to a hamstring strain.
For the athletes, however, their individual accomplishments are truly team

achievements. After the tournament,
Jeuland explained that the Swarthmore
team integrates this team concept into a
traditionally individual sport. "We usually think of track and field as a highly
individualcompetition," he said, "but ultimately we do it together. We practice
together, and we share accomplishments
with one another."
Home meets allow the community to
witness this extensive teamwork at
work, and this meet was no exception.
As Jay observed, "the whole team came
early to the meet to support the field
event athletes, who perform first, and
supported their teammates throughout
the meet."

The teammates' mutual support
breathed life into the competitors this

and attend other schools. It looks sad and alone.
Now, I'm not implying that I can communicate on
a deeper level than most with Sharpies furniture.
Rather, the table made me recall another place where
you could find many football players packed together
and that I almost forgot existed, the Delta Uplison

Njideka Akunyili sprints past a competitor during a sprint relay,
past weekend, contributing to the some
of the stellar performances. Jay was certainly thankful for her teammates' enthusiasm. "When you are racing, it is
so wonderful to see your teammates
running back and forth on the inside of
the track to cheer you on both sides, and
the track team ran itself ragged this

weekend cheering on its members," Jay
said.
At the meet, fans witnessed a track

and field team that is rallying just in
time for the Centennial Conference
Championships. "Going into conferences, some people need... to qualify this
weekend in various events, but our
throwers look particularly strong, and
the sprint group is coming together,"

Jeuland said of the men's team.

Badminton team locks
up conference crown

Discussing the women's chances at
conferences, Jay echoed Jeuland's sentiments. "We have a surprising amount
of depth and dedication," she said. "All I
can say is thatI can't wait until the Centennial Conference Championships so
that we can really show what we can do!"
Fortunately for Swarthmore track
and field fans, the conference championships are virtually a home meet
they will be held at Haverford. Track
athletes are happy that the championships are nearby because Swatties will
be able to come in droves to support the
team as they did last weekend. As
Jeuland said of home meets, "To have
friends supporting us is the ultimate
validation of the work we put into this
activity."

for Swat, the Garnet came away with a win and
solidified its domination of the PAIAW conference.
The team had an away match at Haverford last
night, but results were not available at press time.
Considering that last outing Swarthmore swept
Haverford 5-0, the Garnet were expected to win.
The team stands at 4-0 and is looking forward to
hosting the Northeast Intercollegiate Regionals on
Feb. 18 and 19. The tournament is the qualifying
round for national championships. The day will
showcase the Swarthmore team and include men's
singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles, a rare
sight at Swarthmore. Play starts at 9 a.m. on Satur-

In his first year on
the men's basketball
team, Letendre has
racked up the laurels.
With two more games
left in the season, he's
already making
Swarthmore history.
He has dished out 87
assists, making him the fifth-highest all-time season
leader in the category. Letendre also has 40 steals to his
name, landing him the fourth spot on the all-time list. His
achievements are also making him stand out in the
Centennial Conference, where his 3.95 apg makes him
fourth in the conference and his 195 spg makes him third
in the conference. He was named to the Conference Honor
Roll this week and put away nine points and four boards
against both Johns Hopkins and Ursinus.

The Garnet badminton team edged Bryn Mawr
3-2 on Feb. 8. The win brought their record to 4-0,
ensuring a conference crown at the end of the seaAccording to tri-captain Jane Ng 'Ol, Bryn Mawr
currently has a 3-1 record. "If they beat us" at a
home game on Feb. 20, she said, "then we would tie
for the championship."
The Garnet continue to get better with the
shuttlecocks, beating Bryn Athyn on Feb. 13 by a
score of 4-L Despite a drastically different line-up

fraternity house. After DU went dry following the alcohol poisoning incident last semester, I remember
thinking, "What's going to happen to DU now that
all the alcohol is gone?" Judging by the cobwebby
look of the house, I think we can all guess the answer. In the aftermath of the Board of Managers' decision, however, there is an even bigger dilemma facing DU: What's going to happen now thatall the football players are gone? This is something that's not
going to go away, even after alcohol is again allowed
in DU. It's a problem that's going to stick.
This is actually a pretty important question, even
for non-DU Swatties. Whatever the attitude toward
the fraternity during the week, I'm sure that everyone recognizes its importance during the weekends.
Sure, DU may have aspirations to community service (it does help organize blood drives), but its main
function is hosting parties weekend after weekend.
And it is a function the fraternity fulfills well. Until
it went dry, it was the best place to go party, the place
where you could see everybody and everybody could
see you. Next to DU, Phi Psi and its large basketball
contingent always seemed a little sketchy.
With DU withering, however, Phi Psi has bloomed.
The last Phi Psi party was packed with Swatties who
would have never been seen in the house before but
went because there were few other options. And this
seems to make sense: with football gone, the next logical American sport to take up the social mantle would
be basketball. Nevertheless, Phi Psi still has not lost
its slightly seedy edge, leaving me to wonder whether
another sport could step up and relegate Phi Psi to
its old second-banana status.
Which team would it be? According to the traditional
American sports trinity, the third option would be baseball. Somehow, it does not seem that our baseball team
is up to the task. If they don't even have dugouts, how
are they going to manage to take over a frat house?
The other option wouldbe lacrosse. We're in Pennsylvania, so people are aware that it exists (even if
the California transplants are a little confused). It's
also a sucessful team that has respect. Plus, if I remember correctly, a lacrosse player DJ'ed the first
DU party of the year, so the team is already on its
way to becoming a party powerhouse.
Of course, DU could also simply disappear. Who
knows, maybe rugby and ultimate frisbee will become
the stalwart columns propping up the Swat social
scene. The important thing to realize is that we are
going to be adjusting in more ways than one as football fades and Swarthmore moves on.

XFL rebounds
Two weeks ago, I was on the verge of wetting myself
for some "smashmouth football" from the freshly
spawned XFL; instead I was treated to some of the ugliest football this side of Pop Warner. I must have been
loopy from my heaping helping of 12-day-old Sharpies
gumbo to think that I would get top-notch football from
the CFL All-Stars.
The XFL, for those who don't know, is the new professional football league that kicked off its inaugural
season just two and a half weeks ago. The new league is
the offspring of multi-billionaire and marketing geniuses Vince McMahon (WWF) and Dick Enberg (NBC)
and has been dismissed by NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue as "not a serious threat." Billed as a football
league "not for wussies or pantywaists," the XFL has
eight teams playing a 10-game regular season and boasts
a revised rule book. Notable rule changes intended to
do away with the apparent wussiness that is so rampant in the NFL include no fair catches on punts and
exchanging the extra point kick with a one point try
from the two-yard line. Many of the players in the XFL
have some NFL experience, but for one reason (they
sucked) or another (they sucked and were always injured) were cut by their teams. Almost all of the players have at least some NFL Europe, CFL or Arena
League experience. Some of the more "recognizable"
names in the league are ex-Dolphin running back John

Avery; Alvin Harper of early 90s Cowboys fame; and
the 1994 Heisman winner, Rashaan Salaam.
Despite most of the "star" power being on the offensive side of the ball, the defenses looked stingy in the
first week, due more to the out-of-sync offenses than any
true defensive skill. The offensive play-calling resembled my fifth grade playground Nerf Turbo football
days. You remember, back when it didn't matter if you
actually completed a pass but rather that you could outthrow the other team's quarterback.
The announcing teams ranged from mildly entertaining to downright annoying. Matt Vasgergian and Jesse
"The Body/Mind/Soul/Governor" Ventura had the best
blend ofhumor and commentary. (Although, as governor of Minnesota, wouldn't you think that Ventura has
something more important to do with his time then announce cut-rate football games?) Meanwhile, the WWF's
Raw commentators struggled with their first game. Jim
Ross, who used to do play-by-play for the Atlanta Falcons, was given the difficult task of navigating his commentary around Jerry "The King" Lawler's cat calls for
a lap dance from the cheerleaders. The third tandem
teamed Brian Bosworth with generic commentator X.
Where the hell did they dig up the Boz? I thought he fell

off the face of the Earth after he made his b-movie classic, "Stone Cold." Now I regret that he didn't as neither
of his brain cells can produce anything thoughtful to
say about football.
Of course the XFL is not marketing itself as just a
new football league. It also claims to be presenting a
new "football viewing experience." Apparently, this new
experience included having a camera suspended above
the field that would follow the ball down the field. It's
an intriguing idea. Unfortunately the damn thing causes
television viewers to get motion sickness. Another XFL
innovation is allowing cameras on the field and into
the locker rooms. This allows for such exciting footage
as hearing a defensive back come off the field after an
interception and exclaim "Ummm, y0....1 uhhh....go 100%
all day baby. We finna ummmm keep coming at you.
Y'all don't want none a dis. Broken English, cliche, broken English, cliche." And finally, perhaps the biggest
draw to the XFL is their squadron of strippers-turnedcheerleaders. While this might be an important part of
the league to most male viewers, I find it to be an unnecessary distraction from the game. After all, if I

Heather Marandola drives to the basket against Ursinus Feb. 10. Maradola, a senior, had six points in her final regular
season home game. The Garnet won 57-31
BY CAITLIN RYLAND AND EMILY GRAY

This past weekend, the Swarthmore women's basketball
team devoured two more Centennial Conference opponents
while on the road to the conference playoffs. Two local foes,
Ursinus College and Bryn Mawr College, each fell victim for
a second time to the Garnet Tide's tenacious defense and offensive muscle. The attack was led by conference big gun
Heather Kile 'O2, who teamed up with Sarah Tufano 'O3 to create an unstoppable post lineup undoubtedly the most feared

front-court dynamic duo in the region.
From the tip-off on Saturday, the Tideswomen out-hustled,
out-defended, and altogether out-played the visiting Ursinus
Bears, winning 57-3 L The Garnet defensive task force created
26 turnovers and forced the Bears to shoot a meager 27.5 percent from the field. The Tide launched their way to a respectable 43.9 percent shooting accuracy for the contest, despite
shooting 0-8 from behind the arch.
In a game dedicated to the merits of lone senior and tricaptain Heather Marandola, the team honored her by hanging an image of her on the wall and getting the job done on the
court. In what was her last home game of the regular season,
Marandola brought her A-game. She racked up stellar numbers all over the court, with six points (3 for 4) from the floor,
five assists, one blocked shot and two steals. Her consistent
all-around performance is one of the key ingredients of the
recent success of the program. She is currently seventh on
the Centennial Conference career assists list and is still dish-

ing 'em out.

Tufano lead all scorers with 19 points (8-13,3-3) and managed a none-too-shabby two blocks, five boards, and three
steals.Kile and freshman sensationKatie Robinson tallied YL
and 11points respectively to round out the double-figures club.
Every player on the Ursinus squad was held to single digits.
Although it was not the prettiest victory, the Tide soundly
defeatedthe feisty and much-improved Bryn Mawrtyrs this
past Sunday 53-26. Tufano had a team-high 12 points. With
her nine-point contribution to this victory, Kile moved into
second place on Swarthmore's all-time scoring list, to furthercrowd her shelfofathletic accolades. She also managed
seven boards and five steals in the contest. Katie Tarr 'O2
slammeddown seven points and ripped down 10 boards with
authority. Nine Garnet players scored in the win.
Success this past weekend, however, did not quell the
Garnet appetite. The women are eager to cap off this recordbreaking season with a winning post-season and the insurance of some home-court matches for the playoffs. The
Garnet Tide is currently 19-3 overall and 11-2 in conference
play. The results of the Wednesday evening game against
next week's playoff opponent, Muhlenberg College, were
not available at press time. With a win over Muhlenberg,
the Garnet will capture the East Division crown, its first
outright title in the Centennial Conference.
An imminent victory over Haverford College at their
place this weekend should complete the Tide's six-game
Blue Route sweep on Saturday at 6 p.m.
