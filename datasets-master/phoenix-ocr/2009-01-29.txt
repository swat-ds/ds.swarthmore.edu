Grassroots training promotes student activism
BY ASHIA TROIANO

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

The "Swarthmore has GROWN" sign in the Scheuer
Room marked the completion of a weekend-long, grassroots organizing set of training sessions conducted by
the United States Student Association. A multi-faceted
program designed to empower students across the
country to advocate for themselves, especially concerning issues of higher education, the USSA Web site
calls itself "the country's oldest and largest national
student-led organization."
The sessions were led by San Sun Owen, a senior at
the University of Oregon, and Wes Weaver, a junior at
Temple University in Philadelphia. GROW (Grassroots
Organizing Weekend) specifically focuses on how to
best utilize direct action organizing. Each session
addressed a different facet of organizing, such as
"Understanding the Relations of Power," "Choosing an
Issue," "Recruitment and Organization Building" and
"Coalitions."
"The tools and skills you learn [at GROW] are
invaluable Students can make a real tangible change
in people's lives, including their own," Weaver said.
Among the groups represented throughout the
weekend were Swarthmore Womyn of Color Collective,
Amnesty International, Student Labor Action Project,
STAND, White Women Confronting Racism and
Coalition for a Free Haiti. Despite the commonality of
the weekend's goals, each attendee came with his or
her own agenda about what the organization hoped to
learn.
"Grassroots organizing has always been a topic that
I have found interesting," Philippe Celestin 'll said.
"At the same time it has been something I have found
difficult to wrap my head around. The idea that you
can bring together a large group of ordinary citizens
on a set of issues and overcome well-established systems of power seems somewhat difficult to fully understand. I felt like the training would be a good start to
learning how to tap into that kind of extraordinary
...

power."

In addition to discussion on the principles of organizing, the group was asked to participate in several

interactive exercises. In role playing activities, students were put on opposing sides of an organizing campaign and decided what they had learned throughout
the weekend that would help their side most. "Direct
Action Organizing is common sense," SunOwen said.
"[We provide] a new way of looking at organizing concepts. They will work for us and our opponents."
For Celestin, these role plays drove home the
themes of the training. In a role play that divided the
students into the State Student Association and the
Board of Regents, the groups were asked to act out a
direct action scenario between the teams. "Our team
walked into the role playing scene a little more amped
up and ready to take on 'the man' than we probably
should have been. We ended up adopting a pretty
aggressive way of dealing with the issue in the scenario, and that resulted in a lot of tension and yelling.
Immediately afterwards we all kind of let go of our
different roles
and the tension seemed to dissolve
away, and I think that maybe at that moment we came
to a sort of collective understanding of what we had
been learning about and I think that was a really valuable thing for us as a group to experience."
Many of the attendees agreed that the concepts
taught during GROW will always be useful. Joanie
Jean 'll said that she has already begun implementing
them in her own work.
"The fact that I took home the poster that said
'POWER' in huge black letters and hung it over my
dresser speaks volumes.... I walk through Parrish and
instead of absentmindedly reciting Japanese vocabulary [for class] in my head, I find myself thinking about
power relationships. In terms of [Coalition for a Free
Haiti], we've already begun reorganizing our plans so
that they are more strategic and concrete."
While GROW trainers can hold up to 25 trainings a
year at campuses across the country, the planning
committee felt that a small liberal arts school like
Swarthmore has as much to gain from the experience
as any big university.

Cecilia Marquez and Sarah Apt participate in a role play on organizing student campaigns.
"It was necessary to bring GROW to Swat because it
provided a lot of practical information to aspiring
activists. I think that especially at Swat, where everyone likes to think of themselves as politically engaged,
it is sometimes harder to get organized, because every-

one has very strong ideas about what is effective,
which is what I think differentiates GROW from a lot of
other workshops. It has a system and organization that
is extremely pragmatic," Lauren Ramanathan 'll, a
member of the planning committee, said. "In the past
I've found that a lot of workshops can be based purely
on idealism... [and] don't take into account the fact that
ideologies are subtle and can differ, not only across the
whole entire political spectrum, but between progressives also."
And true to Swarthmore form, attendees spent their
lunch break collaborating on how to use their new
skills in their current campaigns, which was especially exhilarating for Sara Forster 'IL another member of
the planning committee. "We discuss[ed] how the
GROW strategies could be specifically applied to
Swarthmore. All the people there had different experiences running campaigns, and the information they
gathered from being involved in their respective campaigns could help everyone there be more effective in

the future. Everyone was really energized by the trainexactly the response we had hoped for."
SunOwen and Weaver, both very active on their
respective campuses, shared their personal insights
about organizing and forming campaigns. In their
efforts to form a department of ethnic studies, SunOwen
and fellow organizers handed out good and bad apple
awards to the school's administration as a symbolic gesture. As a result, the group was guaranteed two meetings with the administration to plan for the department.
Weaver emphasized that "sometimes the best actions
aren't planned." During a celebration planned by the
president of Temple for alumni and donors, SLAP, of
which Weaver is a member of, invadedand talked to the
guests about their movement.
Though they were escorted out by the police, the
group achieved their goal of getting sick days for subcontracted security officers on campus. With experiences like these under their belts, SunOwen regrets that
the training is only three days. "It would be nice to help
input in a school's strategy... Who better to connect with
than other students?"

Arboretum constructing new facility, greenhouse
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu

Construction of Scott Arboretum's Wister Education
Center and Greenhouse continues this semester as the
foundation of the building is completed and the walls
begin to rise. The construction of the new 5,200 square
foot center began over the summer and is replacing a 25
year-old structure that was inadequate for the program's
goals, according to Jan Semler, the director of construction and planning at Swarthmore. "The existing structure was literally falling apart, not ADA-compliant, not
energy efficient and woefully undersized for the
Arboretum's need to successfully grow and propagate
plants," Semler said.
Planning for the new building has taken into account
the new needs of the education center and greenhouse.
According to the Arboretum's Web site, "The new center
is essential to accomplishing Scott Arboretum's goals for
advancing horticulture display, plant evaluation, public
education and volunteer support."
The Arboretum staff first began planning the project
in 1999, but it wasn't until a 2002 self-survey of the
Arboretum that the plans became more substantive,
according to Semler. The American Association of
Museums confirmed again the need for these updates
during the Arboretum's re-accreditation review in 2006.
"The reviewers identified the need for the substandard
existing facility to be improved and expanded to meet the
standards of an accreditable organization," Semler said.
Although the plans originally only accounted for a
new greenhouse, an education center was also a priority for staffers. "Through the design process, it became
apparent that the education mission of the Arboretum,
including lectures, seminars and hands-on workshops,
would benefit greatly by gaining expanded space in the
same building as the greenhouse," Semler said.
The entire project is estimated to cost $3.8 million, of
which $2.5 million have already been raised over the
past few years, according to the Arboretum's Web site.
Several foundations and trusts as well as 700 individuals have made donations, Semler said. Swarthmore has
also contributed funds towards making the new structure more energy efficient. "The college has contributed about $235,000 towards features that will support sustainability and help the project earn LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council,"
Semler said.

The cost of the project has risen from original projections of only $l4 million, because commodities have
become more expensive and the project has expanded,
Semler said. However, donations have not tapered.
"Donations to the annual year-end appeal in 2008 contributed $104,000, a 14 percent increase over last year,
despite the current economic climate," Semler said.
Although other construction projects around campus
have been put on hold because of the state of the economy, the college affirmed its support for the construction
of the Arboretum's new facilities in September.
According to Claire Sawyers, director of the arboretum,
though, two greenhouse rooms initially in the model had
to be removed from the final project due to lack of funds.
In addition to the economic challenges, the project's
supporters have consideredthe inconvenience to Willets'
residents and other students. According to Assistant
Dean for Residential Life Rachel Head, the project's supporters have done everything possible to keep Willets'
residents aware of any disruptions that may arise before
they occur.
Head, along with Semler, serves as a liaison between
the project's managers and the residents of Willets.
"Sometimes we get notice ofadditional construction that
might be a disruption to residents, and if we get that, we
will try to let the residents know as early as possible,"
Head said. "So far, however, we haven't had any major
complaints." The only complaints Head has received
were in response to an e-mail sent to Willets residents
before construction began which notified students of
upcoming construction. These complaints, the most
recent of which she received in November, were mostly
about the security concerns of having more people on
campus and in such close proximity to the dorms, Head
said.
"It was more of a proactive concern," Head said. "I
think students were expressing concern over the
increased number of people around because of the
Willets break-ins earlier in the year." These student complaints were resolved with the administration's assurances that the contractors employed would only be on
campus during times of the day least inconvenient for
students.
Security issues aside, some students have expressed
concern over the noise caused by construction and the
decrease in personal privacy. "I thought I was going to be
bothered more by the construction noises, but so far I
have been able to sleep through, them," said Annie

and there will be a bunch of construction workers there.
On the first floor it is not as much of a problem because
they are below the construction level, but here on the
second floor we are essentially eye level with the workers."
So far, the complaints and inconveniences have been
minimal. Semler noted that the project managers have
been careful to minimize the impact of the construction

some students may be reluctant to complain. If this is the
case, she strongly encourages students to share any concerns they may have. "I hope students come to us if they
are frustrated," Head said. "Even if we can't implement
changes on this project, they can be useful as a guide to
future construction and are instructive nonetheless."

UC Davis professor outlines Chinese economy
BY ARIEL MARTINO
amartinl@swarthmore.edu

Last Thursday, University of California Davis
Economics Professor Wing Thye Woo '76 gave a lecture
on the economic past, present and future of China sponsored by the economics, political science and history
departments and the Asian studies program.
History Professor Lillian Li introduced Woo's lecture
with a recapitulation of Woo's time at Swarthmore. Li
stressed the virtual non-existence of Asian and AsianAmerican students on campus during Woo's time here
and recalled Woo asking difficult questions from the back
row of one ofher history classes.
Woo began his lecture by contrasting the privatization
of China's economy with that of the former Soviet
Union's. China underwent incremental reform, beginning its market transformation with gradual privatization of the agriculture industry. He then went on to explicate the difference between the experimentalist school of
reform and the convergence school. While the experimentalist school seeks to find non-capitalist innovations
to transform markets, such as agricultural collectives or
profit-oriented government supervision, the convergence
school looks to integrate the changing market into the
capitalist global market and emulate large WTO countries like the United States, Great Britain and Germany.
Woo pointed out that the convergence school of market
reform is responsible for China's successful transformation.
Woo addressed the growing trade tensions that China
is currently experiencing despite its recent admission
into the World Trade Organization. In 2007, legislation
was proposed to promote tariffs against China, which

Reaccreditation process calls for introspection
BY DANTE FUOCO

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

Though the college expects to receive reaccreditation, it continues to proceed through the exhaustive
process of internal self-study and external review with
great attentiveness. Rather than treating accreditation
as a minor process, college officials see it as a means to
improve the college's future.
"It's a lot of work, but I think it's necessary. It shows
we're paying attention," Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Jim Bock said. "It's been a fruitful
process
a great chance to sit back and look at what
we're doing, how we're doing it and why we're doing
it."
A college becomes accredited when an outside body,
in this case the Middle States Commission, decides that
it meets established educational standards. The process
includes an internal self-study, which explains how the
college fulfills the Middle States Commission's
Fourteen Standards of Excellence, and an external
review, conducted by a team of evaluators from peer
institutions. Accreditation, which happens every ten
years, is intended to make institutions more self-regulated and less directly managed by governments, Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said in an e-mail.
The visiting team will read the self-study and visit
the campus at the end of March, issuing a report soon
after on its findings and recommendations. When the
visiting team comes to campus March 29 to April 1,
members will likely meet with various committees,
members of the faculty and staff and students.
"If the review finds areas in which they think we
need to concentrate more
we will respond either
with additional related evidence or with a plan to
address that area more completely in the future,"
Eldridge said.
The Middle States Commission will then decide this
summer whether the college has met reaccreditation
standards and will subsequently make a recommenda...

...

tion. College officials, though, are certain that the college will become reaccredited.
"I have no doubt [the visiting team will] come here
and say this is a great place doing great things,"
Professor of Economics Ellen Magenheim said.
If the college isn't reaccredited, however, it can lose
federal funding. This wouldthen hinder some ofits fun-

damental inner-workings, such as financial aid,
Magenheim said. The college, as a result, would have to
take the visiting team's recommendations before it
could be reaccredited.
Although she was not sure if the committee's entire
review would be made public for the college community over the summer, Magenheim said that she assumes
"somehow we'll communicate what the committee
said."
Even with the college expecting reaccreditation, the
visiting team's comments are nevertheless helpful to
the administration.
"[Members of the visiting team] come from different
schools with different ideas," Magenheim said, mentioning former or current members from schools like
Barnard, Wellesley and the American University in
Paris. She added that the college not only anticipates
the visiting team's comments will be useful, but also
hopes members of the planning groups can "try to distill what's useful" from the report.
"I have no doubt everybody [at the college involved
in planning for the future] will be informed from what
we learn," she said.
The reaccreditation process is happening on the
heels of the college's creation of eight planning groups
in 2007. These groups, comprised ofboard members, faculty, staff, students, alumni and parents, intend to envision future improvements for the college.
Eldridge emphasized, however, that while the two
planning and the self-study
processes
may at
times be "mutually informing, the self-study stands
alone even as it mentions the priorities that may ultimately emerge from the planning." In 1999, however,

there was a direct relationship between the then-planning groups and the self-study.
With the college's presidential transition and the
country's economic turmoil, the college anticipates
that certain plans for the future will, for now, be put on
hold.

"[There is a] pause in the planning process to give
the new president the opportunity to finalize the determination of priorities and to give time for the economy
to recover," Eldridge said.
According to Bock, "time will tell" what those plans
may be and what will come of them. He maintained,
however, that the presidential transition and the economic recession will not change the way the college
currently runs.
"We're absolutely committed to all our current policies," Bock said. Making changes to the college is "more
of a budget concern than an academic way," he added.
The college sent out an e-mail earlier this month
updating the community on the reaccreditation process
and encouraging student and faculty to become
involved in Swarthmore's internal review by providing
feedback on the 100-page self-study draft. Director of
Institutional Research Robin Shores said that she has
yet to receive any specific feedback from students, however. Just one student responded to the e-mail, and
while he thanked the college for their message, he did
not comment on the draft itself. Shores said that she
"wasn't really sure what to expect" and understands
that students may be busy at the beginning of the

semester.

According to Magenheim, the lack of student
responses might not be due to apathy or busy schedules. She said that she hopes students, as members of
planning groups, do not have problems with the draft
and feel like "their voices were heard earlier in the
planning process."
While some faculty responded, Shores and
Magenheim said that there was no common theme to
the feedback or criticism.

New Gaming Commission regulations delay deer cull
BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Plans for the Crum Woods deer cull
have been postponed due to a proposed
change
in Pennsylvania Gaming
Commission regulations. The college
applied to the PGC in the late fall to use
sharpshooters to reduce the deer population. At the time, regulations stated
that applications for permits should
come from municipalities, rather than
non-profit organizations such as the
college. But the PGC anticipated a
change, and news of this change
reached Jeff Jabco, Co-Chair of the
Crum Stewardship Committee. "When I
spoke with the game. commission in
November, they told me to apply for the
college because there were new regulations. What they didn't tell me was that
the regulations weren't enacted yet," he
said.
This misunderstanding put the
application into a state of limbo. The
application could not be read until the
new regulations were officially put in
place. The PGC has yet to publish the
new regulations in the Pennsylvania
Bulletin, an act that will make the regulation valid. This is expected to happen sometime before the spring.
Once the change is official, the college will have to revise its application
to include new dates for the cull. It is
expected to take place over the course
of the 2009-2010 winter break when
fewer students are on campus.
The newly proposed cull date is set
six years after concerns about the number of deer in the Crum began. A group
of outside consultants determined that
deer overpopulation was a major threat

6

to the Crum Woods in December 2003.
In their report, they stated that the
large number of deer "has resulted in
the collapse of plant species diversity in
the forest understory and the near cessation of tree reproduction in vast
areas of Pennsylvania forests." They
concluded, "[t]he threat to the Crum
Woods is profound." And in the past six
years this threat has no doubt grown,
with does giving birth to one or two
fawns each year.
In March 2007 the consulting firm
Natural Resource Consultants analyzed
the deer situation and proposed several
possible solutions. They suggested
"implementing a restoration plan for
mimicking the population-stabilizing
effects of natural predators on deer m
order to protect and restore the structure, diversity and function of Crum
Woods."
Using infrared technology, they
determined that there are 50 to 70 deer
per square mile in the Crum. To bring
this down to a more sustainable number, they will have to remove about 100
animals. According to the report, the
best method for removal would be using
sharpshooters. They explored other
avenues, such as controlled hunting
and contraceptives, but each of these
alternatives featured health or safety

concerns.
The college's chosen method for deer
population management may be the
only stumbling block that remains in
this long process. Jabco said that earlier in the process the PGC wanted the
college to consider a controlled hunt
and is unsure whether this will continue to be an issue when a new application is filed.

But even if the cull takes place next
won't be the end of
the story for the deer. Without any natural predators, the number of deer is
sure to continue growing.
Monitoring techniques will be put in
place to help the stewardship committee determine when the deer become a
problem again. Jabco said that the
main question the committee must continue asking is, "Are the trees and

plants coming back?" In the future,
when the plant life in the Crum is
threatened again, the college will have
to pursue further culls in order to main-

year as planned, it

tain a sustainable number of deer in the
woods.
Despite the anticipated efforts to
control the deer population, the intention is not to get rid of them: "We still
want to have deer in the ecosystem,"
Jabco said.

Beyond War News Honoring a legacy with dance
BY MICHAEL GLUK
mglukl@swarthmore.edu

BY MAKI SOMOSOT

msomosol@swarthmore.edu

.

Recently, Swarthmore has witnessed and encouraged an explosion of projects that utilize new media technology to channel
information. Stemming from such successes as War News Radio
and the Darfur Radio Project, individual initiatives to personalize
larger issues through the presentation of individual stories now
abound on the college's campus, taking advantage of resources
such as Lang Center funding and Lodge Six's media room.
The Chinatown Youth Radio project, founded by Lang Scholar
Hansi Lo Wang 'O9, exemplifies such initiatives. Wang began
working with War News Radio his freshman year and with his
Lang grant, decided to take his training in radio production to
"cover material that's usually dominated by the mainstream
media." Chinatown Youth Radio, Wang said, "was a summer pilot
program" that involved "working with four high school students
and teaching them how to make radio stories focused on
Chinatown with the purpose of bringing about unheard stories."
Wang's project attests to how new media can encourage community involvement. One of the radio's high school participants
decided to broadcast a story on Chinatown's Friendship Gate,
which was renovated this summer. The girl's story focused on the
gate as a source of pride and identity for Chinatown residents,
while construction projects, like a new Eagles stadium, loom in
the future, threatening to encroach on the community. For many,
the story humanized Chinatown, so that "it's not just a block of
its got two schools, churches,
restaurants and trinket shops
apartments [and] entrepreneurial businesses," Wang said. After
the success of Chinatown Youth this summer, Wang hopes it will
continue as an outlet for Chinatown youth.
Additional new media projects include Calvin Ho 'll's
Swarthmore Migration Project. "Basically, we're a multimedia
blog that tries to document immigration stories and create an oral
history with community focus," Ho explained. Thus far, Ho has
collected stories from immigrants in the borough of Swarthmore,
South Philly and Chinatown. "We want to share with the world
what it means to be an immigrant [...] Immigrants are often
silent, and this is an opportunity for people to see into and understand their communities," Ho said. His project also attests to new
media's potential to provide the marginalized with a microphone
and a podium. The stories on Ho's blog are accompanied by photographs and videos of the surrounding area, an interesting
approach that provides "both an insider and outsider perspective," said Ho.
Working with Internet and radio also presents challenges.
"Audio equipment is especially difficult, because using radio technology requires training," Ho said. With this challenge, however,
comes the freedom to create one's own unique style and content,
thus truly allowing the exposure of raw, unfiltered perspectives.
Shilpa Boppana 11 of the Darfur Radio Project said, "The Internet
is a great resource for getting our show out, and also for finding
contacts who we can talk to for our pieces. It's pretty easy to find
e-mail addresses and phone numbers online for people we'd like
to interview, and if they can't help us, they'll sometimes refer us
to a colleague or someone who can."
"[lt] really comes down to telling stories," Wang said. "What
we're really trying to do is old, in a way. It comes down to getting
people comfortable with talking to strangers. It's the best way to
tell stories that can move people or change their perspectives."

THE PHOENIX

Bold. Evocative. Honest. These are some of the
words that have been circulated to describe the
performances by the Carolyn Dorfman Dance
Company. As the company matures into its 25th
season, it has been lauded for its unique versatility, "elegance and power" and "inner fire" in communicating the complex Jewish experience
through the athletic, expressive art of dance.
Sponsored by the William J. Cooper Foundation,
the Office of the Jewish Student Advisor and Kef,
Swarthmore's Jewish social group, this ensemble
of dancers will be performing on the Swarthmore
campus Friday, Jan. 30th, in LPAC at 8 pm.
Originally based in the New York/New Jersey
area, CDDC is a dance company that remains highly in demand, with nationwide and international
appearances in theaters, dance festivals and universities under its belt. Though comprised of only
fifteen members, it is the fourth-highest paid dance
company in New Jersey.
CDDC's Artistic Director Carolyn Dorfman, a
child of Holocaust survivors, feels a responsibility
to her own legacy and history. Through creating
provocative dances, metaphors and musical compositions, Dorfman expresses the Jewish struggle
for identity. Through such visceral mediums,
Dorfman has been able to create "worlds" into
which the audience can then enter and discover
themselves. "Each work, from Mayne Mentshn
(My people) to Echad (One), Cries of Children to
Odisea (Odyssey), is a ladle dipped into a historical
cauldron of faith, survival and renewal," Dorfman
said on the company's website. "Each dance
reflects
the ultimate humanness that it

trays the Jewish diaspora as a whole, is remarkable for a gigantic wheel prop that the dancers
mount all together. The wheel represents the ongoing human struggle that inevitably links all of us
together. One dancer attempts to wrestle with the
wheel, an isolated effort, as a physical metaphor
for isolation and loneliness.
Of course, there is a distinctly Swarthmorean
sense which is evident in the Legacy Project. "I
think it's about ethical intelligence, something
which Al Bloom has always emphasized," Winter
said. In the same way that this much-referenced
Swarthmore tradition involves being ethically
aware and responsible for one's surrounding
social community, the Legacy Project tries to open
minds further to the horrors of the Holocaust and
its continuing repercussions in Jewish culture and
society today. Through a much bigger lens, it
evokes common human struggles of leaving
home's familiar comforts and re-integrating oneself into an entirely different world and mindset.
Since founding the Company in 1982, Dorfman
has created more than fifty creative works and
continues to lead with an innovative, dynamic
vision. The other fourteen members of the
Company form a versatile, unique and contemporary dance ensemble. The CDDC is also a proactive
force. The audience is drawn directly into
Dorfman's unique personal worlds,through postperformance lectures, master classes and meet-theartists gatherings.
Today, Dorfman will present a lecture titled,
"Creating Art as a Child of Survivors" at 1:15 pm in
the Scheuer Room. In addition to this, a master
dance class will also take place at 4:30 pm in the
LPAC Troy Dance Studio.

...

inspired."

For Dorfman, the Legacy Project remains an
intensely personal work, which resonates deeply
with her own family and childhood memories. The
project represents, according to the New York

Times, the "dance equivalent of a cherished book
of family photographs."
"Dorfman does not make huge statements. Her
dances are little stepping stones; she uses a personal approach to confront huge problems,"
Suzanne Winter 10, a primary organizer of the
upcoming event, said. "They are not only about
beauty, but also about doing something to better
each other."
Winter feels that there is an emotionally universal resonance that can be found in the Legacy
Project. Indeed, the Legacy Project does claim to be
something substantially more than just another
medium of Jewish history. "These are personal
stories, not static art, bits and glimpses into
humanity which are encouraging and powerful."
Winter said.

you too much for that. Instead of allowing my brain to
melt out of my ears and into an empty Reese's bag, I put
my own welfare aside and sacrificed break to watching
both "Freaks and Geeks" and "Arrested Development" in
their entirety (well, except for the part where I was lying
on the beach in Hawaii, but that was more about selfpreservation; I had to keep an eye on the seals who had
chosen to share the beach with me so as to ensure that
none of them would attempt to bite off my hand, so I couldn't really focus on television).
Unfortunately for fans of both shows, neither series
took a particularly heinous amount of time to get through;
though they were critically adored Emmy winners, both
were cancelled for lack of viewers. "Arrested" lasted for
two and half seasons, while "Freaks and Geeks" made it
through only one before getting the axe. Both shows, however, have had their revenge; Judd Apatow, the creator of

"Freaks," is now the king of Hollywood comedy, while
"Arrested" not only launched the career of adorkable hipster Michael Cera but has also become a pop-cultural
touchstone, as anyone who understood the seal reference
in the last paragraph can attest.
I'll address "Arrested" soon enough, but first I want to
discuss the übiquitous Mr. Apatow and his
peculiar brand of family-friendly raunch.
Yes, I just said family-friendly, which may
shock anyone who has seen an Apatow
film, with its unrelentingly profane
dialogue and endless sexually explicit
scenes. However, think about it for
just a little longer and you'll see my
point. Ponder the ultimate messages

blood, Apatow's films affirm a surpris
ingly traditional value set.
Those who have seen "Freaks and Geeks" could have
seen this coming. Because "Freaks" appeared on network
television, it didn't have the same filth quotient as any of
the aforementioned films, which just made the family-values messages shine through all the clearer. While the
show provided an accurate portrait of the high-school horror, it didn't have the same kihd of biting satiric edge that
characterizes, say, "Mean Girls," because Apatow softens
his characters to the point where that edge is lost.
Nowhere is this tendency more pronounced than in the
case of resident McKinley High mean girl Kim Kelly.
Unlike Regina George of "Mean Girls," Kim is presented

■t

misunderstood girl who acts out because her home
is a complete mess. The attempt to round out her character is nice, but forgiving her actions so completely is
something of a cop-out on the part of the show's writers.
The message that comes across is that people who have a
stable home are kind and functional, and that people who
,w.>+ have that stability can be excused for their actions.
It's a lovely enough thought, but it just doesn't
ring true to me. This can probably be attributed
j.
to my witnessing firsthand that people who
have stable households can be just as horrible as those whose parents neglect them. I
also have a very strong conviction (also

fucked-up family is no excuse for
being a bitch.
Despite my problems with some

of Apatow's oversimplifications,
however, I really enjoy "Freaks and
Geeks." Not in the same way that I
adore the zany, subversive lunacy of
"Arrested Development" (which I
news-journalon in
will discuss in much more detail in my
next column), but I can see why it has
built up such a cult fanbase over the years. "Freaks" is
appealing in its own honest-yet-optimistic way, and the
cast are realistic as high school students of the non"Gossip Girl" variety, in that they actually look and dress
like real people. Well, except Franco, who is spectacularly
beautiful. Franco's pretty but empty-headed loser is, to me
at least, the most charming, likeable character on the
show (and not just because he's pretty); it's really a shame
that "Freaks" was cancelled before a promising storyline
about Franco's family had time to develop.

Stripping senior year down to its bare essence

At the beginning of this
year, my friends and I sat

down and reflected on our
time at Swarthmore. Had
we really made the most of
the past three years? Will
we graduate at the end of
this year, feeling as though

world, have we made sufficient fools of ourselves in
this Swarthmore bubble? Have we danced on enough tables, played ASSassins
to the extreme (does going to class in a towel count?),
gone to Sager in little but mere pasties, attended a passionate protest and sat down with a philosophy professor
to ponder the meaning of life? Have we joined the nudist
club for a walk in the Crum Woods, participated on a club
team, moved our bodies to the rhythms of African Dance
I? Have we tried out for a play or participated in a Boy
Meets Tractor skit, pioneered the Pterodactyl Hunt or
ever done Crunk Fest? Moreover, have we stretched ourselves to the max, "living the dream" of college to the
quirky extremes of this Swarthmore playground?
While I have done many of the things above, I have not
done them all. This semester, however, amid thesis writ-

ing, job applications and the endless hours in McCabe, I
will. And, you, my dear Swatties, will have the privilege
to follow along in this last little Swarthmore journey of
mine. I want no regrets, for when will I ever be in a place
like Swarthmore again? This semester, I encourage your
suggestions and your participation in this journey, so
please send ideas and ask to take part. I am taking a
Senior's Pledge to discover every last thing I can about

this campus and utilize every last space I can find. A final
ode to Swarthmore; let the journey begin.
This week's bucket list item is one I never thought I
would have the courage to do until the last night offinals
last semester. (Now, ahem, in writing, I would like to add:
I neither confirm nor deny my actual participation in
this act). While I had not intended for this bucket list item
to be crossed off so soon, or in such cold weather, the time
was right. Walking back from McCabe to the cinderblocked halls of Hallowell at 2 a.m., I came across three
senior women singing "Elephant Love Medley" from
Moulin Rouge on the steps ofParrish. Never passing up a
moment to procrastinate, I hopped up the steps to join
them, despite my shivering joints and numb fingertips.
Our singing led to a group "ooooooohhh niiine!" and
stress-relieving reenactments of the infamous midnight
scream. Aside from the stressed seniors in Parrish
Parlors the campus was silent, and the sense of freedom
standing at the top of our campus, looking down, was an
overwhelming rush. Infused with this rush, I suddenly
had the urge to run through "my campus" full throttle, as
I realized that come June lsj;, it will no longer be "mine."
Perhaps the stress levels had gotten to me or perhaps I

had become the most sane I had been in a long time, but
before I knew it, two of us were stripping our clothes off
and running along Magill Walk in our underwear. The
other two, more sensibly, declined to run around in freezing weather and run back up the hill at the end.
My friend and I ran down Magill walk, shouting to the
heavens and only too late noticing the late-night biker
rolling across campus (however, I'm sure our magnificent bodies are forever etched in his mind and greatest
fantasies
hello again!). Quickly forgetting about him,
we continued on our run, slowly stripping our undies and
embracing the thrills of pure, natural and naked freedom.
Our midnight run was shortened, however, by a close
encounter with the frats. While stripping down to nothing was not necessarily a conservative act, my modesty
was not ready for a public viewing. Back at Parish, my
friend and I quickly slipped our clothes back on to avoid
pneumonia, "and we four senior girls all went our separate ways to continue our long night of writing.
Whoever could have thought that running, my alltime favorite stress-reliever, and nudity could combine to
be so rejuvenating?! What a thrill! And, almost as though
it had never happened, I was back at my desk at 3 a.m.,
ready to write the last final paper of my last fall semester.
But, before returning to the keys of my computer, I pulled
out the 3x5 card that has been sitting in my top drawer all
year and, with a red pen, crossed out one more thing from
my special little bucket list. The bar has been set, and I
am ready for the next adventure. Care to join me?

Part II: Some say that the world will end in ice

Hamlet Wrenncroft
Trigger

Disclaimer:
This is part II
of a ten part
column.
Unless
you've taken
Clinical Psych
(I take great
satisfaction in
the fact that
the psychology department

no longer conme
siders

"abnormal"),
you probably
know only the basics of obsessive compulsive disorder; superlative personal
hygiene, exceptional organizational skills,
an inclination toward solving mysteries.
I'd like to begin this week's installment
with a short explanation of the disorder.
Look up and consider the possibility

that, thousands of miles above you, a broken satellite is falling at tremendous
speeds en route towards an intimate rendezvous with your skull. I would like you
to prove, with absolute certainty, that you
are not about to receive an involuntary
celestial trepanning courtesy of Verizon
Wireless. You can argue that this is highly unlikely, cite countless statistics, and
I'm sure these would be very accurate and
sciency but they only go so far. You cannot prove anything, one way or the other.
Anything is possible. We live in a world
not of certainty but ofendless incalculable
risk. The music of the spheres is chaos.
You say "so what?" and choose to
ignore the possibility of your imminent
death and continue your day. But imagine
"so what" was not good enough, that you
could not live happily without absolute
confidence vis-a-vis the security of your
noggin. So you check the local airport
flight schedule, just to be safe. You wear a
football helmet to bed and shower beneath
a metal umbrella. You lock yourself in
your basement, shun human contact,
spend every waking moment attempting

10

ing incoming projectiles. These are minor
inconveniences, but aren't they preferable
to being killed by falling debris?
Not really, unfortunately. It is possible
for a human being to reach a point where
a jagged metal blade bisecting their brain
would actually increase cognitive and

behavioral functionality.
This is OCD. It's the intolerance of risk,
however minute, and the surrender to
protective ritual, however unbearable.
The voice of OCD is like that of a beloved
grandmother, recently passed away and
resurrected by eldritch magicks. It is
maternal, condescending and affectionate,
with a slight suggestion of righteous
indignation, "I know what's best for you,
dear," it says, a hint of formaldehyde on
its breath, its face plastered with funereal
makeup, a fly crawling about its unblinking painted eye. You listen because guilt
and fear compel you to, despite the sense
of unease, and then before you know it
Granny Goodness has cracked your skull
open and is slurping up your brains with
toothless, rotting gums.
OCD demands safety and certainty. It
wants life to become a chessboard and
then for all the dark squares to be
removed. OCD makes the world as small
as a room, then small as your head, then
even smaller than that. It is an unwillingness to live with what cannot be proven
and the fact that nothing really can ever
really be proven is regrettable but irrelevant to its purposes. I did any number of
asinine, irrational things not because they
would protect me but because they might,
and I'd be damned if the one night I failed
to properly pray the lord my soul to keep
was the night I died before I woke.
Indeed only recently have I started to
understand how intrinsically fucked my
childhood behavior was. Many of my
early obsessions fixed, not on illness or
uncleanliness, but on imminent apocalypse. I remember in first grade an
overzealous classmate claimed that countless generations from now our sun would
overheatand explode; the same year a visiting environmental group made the (ret-

respectively somewhat dubious) claim
that given our current rate of deforestation, the Earth would run out of oxygen by
2005. I spent weeks arguing with myself
against the possibility of such hypothetical apocalypses, determined to prove they
would not occur, but never quite succeeding. But my first-full blown bout with
OCD I owe to Kurt Vonnegut. My thirdgrade teacher, neglecting the handful of
her charges suffering from undiagnosed

mania, told us about a book she was reading. That book was Vonnegut's "Cat's
Cradle." In her pre-digested version of the
novel, the world was threatened by the
specter of the evil molecule Ice-9, which
would supposedly freeze every non-water
substance on the planet once released. I
imagine that Kathleen (her name was
Kathleen; I went to 'progressive' private
school, so we called our teachers by their
first names and drew pictures of symphonies instead of learning long-division)
had forgotten this by the end of the day. I
imagine the other students forgot it too.
But oh Lordy, I did not forget it. I could
not forget it, no matter how hard I tried.
The threat of Ice-9 was real, even though I
understood that the actual substance of
Ice-9 was emphatically not, but if some
hack sci-fi writer had imagined the stuff,
then surely it could be recreated in reality? Ice-9 consumed my days, it delicately
insinuated itself into my classes and
assignments and into my dreams. The
threat of Ice-9 could not be eradicated, no
matter how many times my parents
assured me that it did not exist, no matter
how many times my therapist had me
write its .name on a scrap of lined paper
and burn it or tear it or flush it down the
toilet. My only strategic recourse, the
only thing I could do, was to spend every
waking moment examining my surroundings and considering my course of action,
should hypothetical cryo-eschaton occur.
I spent hours studying the position of
sinks and flow of water from leaky fountains, planning how I would contact my
parents and gather supplies in this
inevitable frozen wasteland. No matter

January 22, 2009

where I went or what I did, I was haunted

by an invisible wave of cold blue, driving
forward, uncontrollable and unstoppable

because it did not exist. I bathed ice and
showered ice, I slept, drank and breathed
it. My brain seized up and solidified, tattooed by frost, a cool-blue chemical pearl.
What eventually saved me was my
father. He mentioned off-handedly that I'd
had it wrong. According to Vonnegut Ice-9 didn'tfreeze everything except water. It
froze only water. Suddenly, just like that,
my mental paralysis was shattered. Of
course! Triumph! The imaginary freezing molecule I had dreaded was only made
up, completely different from the imaginary freezing molecule that actually imaginarily existed! Ice-9 only froze water! Of
course! It was all a big misunderstanding.
My family and I could certainly survive
that kind ofchemical doomsday. We'd traverse the frozen oceans and hunt penguins. No big deal. Problem solved.
The reasoning behind the whole
process was aggressively nonsensical, of
course, and could be easily dismissed by
any sane individual. "Why didn't you just
stop worrying about it earlier," I can hear
you ask, and my only response is that I
was psychologically incapable of doing so.
I wish I could offer a more satisfying narrative, with character development and
such, but for what it's worth the whole
mess never made much sense to me
either. That's why we call it a disorder.
As I grew older these apocalyptic scenarios lost their potency (with the exception of the zombocalypse which maintains
a certain fascination). I never entirely
convinced myself they could not occur,
but as I grew older they seemed to become
less plausible. I learned to accept the possibility ofthe end ofthe world, to live with
it instead of trying to negate it. Besides, I
had survived puberty, I was entering high
school and I would soon awaken to possibilities far more horrible than the extinction ofall life on the planet.

Mucho Gusto, Madrid
My fellow Swarthmoreans, I decided to write this

column because I know at
least half of my friends
maintain our friendship
because of the ego boost
they gain watching me
stumble into awkward situation after awkward situation. Aware of the fragility
of Swarthmore egos everywhere, I decided to open up
my cringe-worthy life to all
Tiffany Liao
of you as well.
Swawkward in Spain
For the next few weeks,
join in the divertido and let
me regale you with daily
adventures (as long as they
don't interrupt the siesta), sage observations on la vida
cotidiana in Madrid (eh, 50/50 chance) and awkward situations (a guarantee) which will only be compounded by
my inability to express myself properly in Spanish.
First impression? Madrid is a beautiful city with a
mix of gorgeously ornate old architecture and glimmering streamlined department stores. So far, I've traveled to
Andalucia and gawked at the white-washed pueblos and
towering cathedrals, "learned" to "flamenco," made amigos nuevos and watched a series of perfect sunsets on a
beach in Nerja. Oh, there is also currently a crippling
food shortage in Spain right now because I have EATEN
ALL OF THE FOOD IN SPAIN. De verdad, hombre, put
down the Sharpies paella because it's all a lie.
In my upcoming columns, I'll spend more time on discussing actually living in Spain, but for my inaugural
column, I'll focus on something a lot more familiar to
y'all: being Swawkward in Spain. In the weeks leading up
to Madrid, my primary worry was about the incoming
culture shock, especially having been warned by other
students about race relations in Spain. That is, when I
wasn't worried about whether I would sit next to someone attractive on the plane. (Why, you ask? The last time
I fell asleep on a plane, I only woke up when I felt something dripping on my shoulder. It was my own drool.)
Oddly enough, it wasn't being Asian American in
Spain that caused the greatest culture shock. (Although,
I swear, the next person that hoots konichiwa at me, I
will punch them in the esophagus. Or, you know, smile
hesitantly and nod. Damn my constant need to please).
Instead, the biggest adjustment is how completely
socially adept madrilenos are. My skin hasn't crawled
over the awkwardness of a situation once since I've been
here. There isn't even a word in Spanish for
the closest approximation being "torpe" or clumsy.
Although just because a word doesn't exist in Spanish
doesn't mean the thing doesn't occur "sketchy" being
a perfect example. Even after I supplied Marcos, a
madrileno, with a bevy of examples of awkward situations while discreetly declining to mention the major role
I played in most of them, he wrinkled his brow and asked,
"Like a shy person?" No, Marcos. Not... even close.
Of course, being who I am, soon I schooled Marcos in
the way of the awkward. While talking to my new
Spanish bestie, I became so animated that the piece of
gum I was chewing flew out and then, jesus, stuck in my
hair. Slightly panicking, I blanked and deferred to my
default reservoir of social maneuvers. Only to find that
Swarthmore had fully laid waste to them. So, instead of
throwing away the masticated chicle from my hair, I
somehow decided the best way to deal with the situation
was to take the gum out of my hair, put it back in my
mouth and keep talking like nothing happened. To his
credit, I only noticed the faintest trace of alarm in
Marcos' eyes as he watched me gamely continue chewing
on a piece of gum that I'm fairly certain still had a hair
hanging from it. I don't think I'll ever see him again.
Honestly, though, the thing that has incurred the
largest number of awkward situations is the Spanish
practice of dos besos. I'm sure many of you know this, but
the standard manner of greeting and saying goodbye
between a Spanish chico and chica, or two chicas is 'ttar
dos besos": a quick airkiss on each side of thecheek. This
is regardless of age or intimacy ofrelationship. In general, the concept of personal space doesn't really exist in
Spain. Upon meeting me, Spanish people will jovially
but that's another
grab my neck or waist (or culo
story) and speak right into my ear. At first, it was a little
disconcerting speaking to someone when I was constant...

Mostly, my greatest fear was that I would somehow
misaim my puckered lips and make contact with the face
or even worse, the lips, of a professor or friend. Thus, I
developed a way of dos besos that involves me swinging
my head in a wide semi circle towards each cheek, all the
while making firmly non-flirty eye contact that reassures
that, hombre, I am not trying to make out with you. This
worked pretty well for my first few introductions.
Of course, I didn'tfactor in what happens during dos

you. The first time it happened with the son ofthe Senora

process and damned ifI didn't almost giggle afterwards.

Swarthmore Inn card check neutrality
To the Editor:
As members of Swarthmore Labor
Action Project (SLAP), we would like to
update the student body on the status of
the campaign our group has been running to ensure that workers' rights at
the proposed Swarthmore Inn are fully
protected. We are asking the administration to enter into a card check neutrality agreement, which we feel best
guarantees the workers' right to organize a union democratically and free
from intimidation.
Last semester, many of you came out
to our events, and over 500 students and
faculty signed on to a statement in support of card check neutrality at the
Swarthmore Inn. Though the college's
plans for new development have been

impacted by the current financial crisis, they have communicated to us that
they understand the hotel to be a vital

aspect

of

Swarthmore's

future.

Moreover, the decision to protect workplace democracy is first and foremost a
question of ethics, not finances, and can
be made responsibly, irrespective of the

financial climate.
We look forward to continuing dialogue with the administration and the
campus community about this issue.
Our group anticipates that the college
will come to a timely decision that
demonstrates Swarthmore's ongoing
commitment to civic and social responsibility.

Energy plan for the future
To the Editor:
Congress and the Administration are
touting alternative energy sources to
replace power production derived from
foreign oil. They want to generate ten
to twenty percent of the U.S. energy
needs from alternative sources.
Most of the alternative energy would
have to be generated from wind power
systems. If we assume ten percent of
the U.S. energy requirement consists of
100,000 megawatts and each wind turbine produces approximately two to
three megawatts, it will take about
40,000 wind turbines to produce the
100,000 megawatts.
The siting of 40,000 wind turbines
around the country could be a monumental task since an average wind
speed of about twelve mph is needed to
efficiently operate a wind turbine.
Hilltops, mountains, canyons and some
coastlines are candidate locations for
the wind machines, but these locations

would need an electrical grid system

Approximately fifty nuclear power
plants with two units per site providing
a total of 2000 megawatts per site will
generate 100,000 megawatts of clean,
reliable, operationally cost-effective and

Nuclear power plants, domestic oil

Rethinking Courses for Non-Majors
The euphemistic ideal of a liberal

arts institution ("help[ing] students ful-

fill their responsibilities as citizens and
grow[ing] into cultivated and versatile
individuals," as the Swarthmore website aptly puts it) and the reality of its
implementation are, at times, far
removed from each other. At
Swarthmore, students grow into cultivated and versatile individuals by completing a series of distribution requirements intended to force reluctant students to broaden their horizons. These
requirements entail, among other
things, taking a minimum of three
courses in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences.
The college's philosophy of a wellrounded education for every graduate
requires no amendment. The problem,
rather, is that the college often misses
the mark on helping students, turn
coursework requirements into a liberal
education. Or, less nebulously, distribution requirements are in many
instances failing to translate into actual
knowledge.
The problem is that some classes
offered to non-majors lack the rigor
commonly
associated
with
a

Swarthmore education. While many of
the classes intend to make students feel
comfortable in classrooms they would
otherwise avoid, accessibility sometimes comes at too high a price. The relative ease of many of these classes
means that they fail to challenge students to think critically in disciplines
other than their intended majors. Too
often, students take introductory classes exclusively to fulfill their distribution requirements, without actually
seeking to further their educational
"versatility."

Some schools have attempted to
avoid the predicament of filler classes
by rejecting distribution requirements
altogether. Amherst College, a school in
many ways comparable to Swarthmore,
has no distribution requirements.
According to its website, Amherst has
the same concern about graduating a
versatile student body, writing,
"[Amherst's] curriculum provides a
structure within which each student
may confront the meaning of his or her
education, and does it without imposing
a particular course or subject on all stuHowever,
continues,
dents."
it
"Students are encouraged to continue
to seek diversity and attempt integration through their course selection."
The idea, buried beneath layers of rhetoric, is that the best way to achieve versatility is to allow students to select
courses unimpeded by pesky restrictions.

As tempting as this approach may
seem, it is hardly foolproof. If students
are free to take whatever classes they
want, conventional logic goes, they will
elect to take exclusively what they, for
whateverreason, arrive at college wanting to take. And that, needless to say,
leavesbehind the liberal arts mission of
graduating students that are more "cultivated" than when they arrived.
And thus we return to the notion of
distribution requirements. There is, of
course, nothing inherently wrong with
pitching courses to non-majors. The raiallowing

students to study subjects that they
is
don't necessary plan to major in
fine in theory. There are, however, a
number of problems with Swarthmore's
implementation of this ideal, at least as
things presently stand.
At least in part, the problem stems
from the fact that these courses expect
little in the way of prior knowledge
from enrolled students. To gain admission to Swarthmore, students had to
demonstrate a proficiency in a wide
range of subjects
when the average
SAT Math score of a member of the
class of 2012 is a 710, even the most
math-phobic English major can't plead
complete ignorance. And while many
students do not feel confident in subjects outside of their personal comfort
zones, Swarthmore provides easy
access to professors and a staff of tutors.
Of course, certain students have different levels of expertise in different areas,
but with all the available support,
claims that students are unprepared or
unable to tackle rigorous classes in any
field outside of their majors should be
treated with skepticism. The problem,
more often, is that we simply don't want
to.

Swarthmore's professors can hardly
be blamed for this. Because teacher
evaluation forms play a substantial role
in hiring and tenure decisions, faculty
have an incentive to ensure that students aren't frustrated with their classes. Some professors may find it easier to
move through material slowly, rather
than discover that frustrated students,
expecting an easy grade, have panned
them on end-of-semester evaluations.
But more is at work than just students expressing their frustration at
being "screwed" by their non-major
classes. There is, of course, nothing
wrong with offering classes designed
for non-majors, but the efficacy of some
of these classes demands greater scrutiny by the college. There are some concrete steps that the administration
could take that would make courses for
non-majors
fulfilling.
more
For
instance, some course evaluation forms
ask students for their thoughts on
whether the classes move too slowly or
too quickly. Such forms should be
implemented in every class designed
for non-majors. Moreover, departments
should take into greater account the
opinions and feedback of students who
don't plan on majoring in their subjects.
But improving courses is a cooperative process, and, indubitably, the burden cannot fall exclusively on professors and departments. A more extensive dialogue needs to be initiated
between students and faculty on the
subject of non-major courses. Students
taking courses outside of their majors
need to submit extensive feedback,
preferably throughout the class, on
what their experiences have been (both
positive and negative) and how the
classes might be improved. Students
must be invested not only in the departments they aspire to join in the spring
of their sophomore year, but in every
department throughout the college.
Feedback isn't optional, and improving courses can only happen when students tell professors what they're doing
wrong in a concrete and detailed way.

A tribute to the power of sports
With
much ado
and fanfare
(and

sighs

of relief),
last week
marked the
transition
from

presidency
to Barack

Obama's.
The
Over International Borders
m o m en
tousness of
this change
was especially apparent when a number of students slowly got up to leave in the middle of my Astronomy lecture last
Tuesday, hoping to seem inconspicuous
as the clock reached the approximate
time of Obama's inaugural address.
And with the hubbub surrounding the
beaten-to-death issues that our nation's
newest president must tackle, there
really only remained one promised
change that remained untarnished by
the wearying 2008 campaign.
He's building a basketball court in
the White House.
Obviously, Obama's well-chronicled
love for the game of basketball is hardly more important than his oft-repeated
economic and social goals for America.
At the same time, various media outlets
such as "Sports Illustrated" and "USA
Today" have been quick to note the
-

that sports have had on
Obama's politics. They point to the
meritocracy of basketball pick-up
games; how in a basketball environment leadership is earned only through
solid play. It pleases me, as an avid fan
of sports, to see this aspect of leadership gaining some level of legitimacy as
Obama ascends to the highest rungs of
American politics.
Sports have always been taken less
seriously in media coverage and public
opinion when compared to other current events. Though sports coverage
gets the coveted back page of most
newspapers, this one included, it is
often lumped with other items that
make it seem like something less than
"legitimate" news. For example, the
International Herald Tribune likes to
put its daily comics and word scramble
on the same page as Roger Federer's
latest victory and baseball's latest
steroid user.
Baseball's steroid users, in fact, also
help build the case against sports as
something ultimately powerful in our
lives. With so many high-profile athletes embroiled in controversies ranging from shooting themselves in the leg
(football player Plaxico Burress) to
being paid $2O million not to go to work
impact

(basketball player Stephon Marbury),
athletes are often generalized as
spoiled, ignorant babies who have little
to offer society besides their skills at a

game. And if we're honest with ourselves, we can admit that this generalization extends not just to the profes-

sional level but to amateur athletics as
well.
To me, this lack of goodwill is sad,
because it mars what really should be
more acknowledged as a dominant
force in human existence. Even for my
high school newspaper, the sports section housed the fewest number of journalists because no one took the sports
world seriously. The journalists all
wanted to cover "real" news.
But sports news is real news. It is
real because there are few other things
in the world that can so directly affect
us. A person doesn't even need to enjoy
playing sports to at least recognize the
impact it has on people.
Only sports can make a nation torn
apart from war come together, if only
momentarily— how else can the
upwelling of support for an Iraqi
national soccer team on its way to the
2007 Asian Cup be explained? Only
sports can turn otherwise perfectly
sane humans turn into incoherent fragments of illogic— try telling a Kobe
Bryant fan that Leßron James has surpassed Kobe as the best player in the
NBA.
The power of sports is such that the
fortunes of the incumbents in Brazilian
presidential elections have correlations
with the success of the nation's soccer
team. The power of sports is such that a
certain former senator of New York
found herself appearing at Yankees
games with her NY. cap on whenever
election time rolled around again. It is
a power that makes complete strangers

brothers as they cheer for the same
sorry hockey team, and it is a power
that also creates deep divisions where
they might not have existed.
And even after I say all this, many
will dismiss it as over-dramatizing a
trivial aspect of life. But while I certainly don't want to suggest that the
Eagles' latest playoff collapse should
stir more attention than the renewed
fighting on the Gaza Strip, there are
certain undeniable aspects of the world
of sports that make it worthy of our
appreciation.
The competition, the unity, the
endurance, the euphoria
all of these
are driving forces that athletes, fans,

commentators and

naysayers alike
should recognize. The fact that the
game of basketball is being attributed
as a part
no matter how small
of
Barack Obama's seemingly impossible
success story, and being done so without a trace of irony, is a victory for
those who still have faith in the compelling power of sports.
For despite how petty and trivial the
world of sports may sometimes seem, in
the end it can be much more than just a
break from the "real world." The world
of sports is a real world in and of itself,
and President Obama helps strengthen
the notion that this world indomitably
affects the traditional idea of a real
world. Ultimately, to paraphrase
renowned sportswriter Frank Deford,
sports embraces us all.

Barack Obama's first move: negotiating with Iran
The saying goes that
the United States has
always elected great presidents in times of great
adversity. I believe that
Barack Obama will be a
great president, and one
who has already proven
himself to be a masterful
organizer and galvanizer
of the American people.
But a week after his historic inauguration, we
David StemgokJ
should realize that the secPragmatism Not Idealism ond part of the saying also
mm holds true: this is indeed a
time of great adversity,
and if political pundits of
disparate ideologies can agree on one thing, it's that
Obama has one hell of a task before him. The president
and his team have signaled that they plan to take care
of domestic issues first, stitching up the wounds in the
economy before turning their gaze to interests abroad.
While a relatively introverted focus would be nice (God
knows the economy needs it) there are at least a few key
foreign issues where external pressures will force the
Obama administration to take action. Chief among
these is the issue of Iran, which has doubtless already
spurred debates in the Oval Office. In dealing with Iran,
time is particularly of the essence; within the year it
could be recognized as a legitimate (i.e., "not just bluffing") nuclear state.
In his recently released book, "The Inheritance: The
World Obama Confronts and the Challenges to
American Power," the Chief Washington Correspondent
for The New York Times, David Sanger, makes the case
that Iran will pose Obama's most immediate and complex foreign policy challenge. This is not merely
because ofIran's nuclear recalcitrance, but also due to
a history of American petulance regarding diplomatic
relations with the prevailing Iranian leadership.

14

Since the 1979 Iranian revolution and hostage crisis,
the United States has had zero official diplomatic contact with Iran, preferring instead lofty rhetorical
threats (by labeling them part of the 'laxis of evil," along
with Iraq and North Korea), or secretive negotiations
conducted via European proxies. Sanger's book is in
some ways a response to this strikingly sophomoric policy. Specifically, it details what programs the American
intelligence community has resorted to for curtailing
Iranian nuclear capacity since open, equanimous
options have been taken off the table. These include the
usual list of spy tricks: "turning" foreign engineers to
act as informers, sabotaging centrifuges so that they
blow up and frustrate the process of Uranium refinement, as well as shadier, more speculative enterprises.
Sanger notes that the top-secret classifications of these
methods veil them in mystery, writing that he himself
has withheld informationfor the sake of prudence.
But it is clear that neither Sanger nor many of the
officials interviewed in his book place much faith in
these programs as a realistic solution to Iranian
nuclear progress. "I hope," one official told Sanger,
"someone's ready to tell the next president there's not
much chance any of this crap is going to work." If it
doesn't, the Obama administration will have to find
something that does, and quickly. In 2008, Sanger
recounts, an Israeli delegation approached the White
House, asking for equipment and permission for an aerial assault on the major Iranian enrichment facility at
Natanz. The White House balked; sanctioning the
attack could have placed our Iraqi forces in the crossfire of a regional war. Still, the message was clear:
Israel wants a functioning American policy that entails
shutting down Iranian nuclear facilities, and if this
doesn't happen, they are prepared to implement their
own policy. So this is the impossibly thin line Obama
has to walk coaxing compromises out of the uncompromising Iranians, while convincing Israel that we are
gaining enough ground to make the military option
unnecessary. How in the world do we go about achieving this?

January 29, 2009

The answer, which has been endorsed by many of
our top foreign policy theorists, is simple: we talk to
Iranians. For years, the United States has consistently
flinched from this practice, somehow terrified that the
symbolic consequences of meeting with an ostensibly
"evil" country will tarnish our claims to moral superiority. To me, the election of Barack Obama
who
signifies a
promises he will open talks with Tehran
victory over this cult ofarrogance. In a recent article in
Foreign Affairs, Martin Indyk, former Ambassador to
Israel, and Richard M. Haass, president of the Council
on Foreign Relations (whose organization hosted
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for an evening during his infamous visit to New York City), argue eloquently in favor
of this diplomatic approach:
"To alter Iran's behavior, particularly on the nuclear
issue, the Obama administration should engage the
Iranian government directly. Why? Because the alternatives are even less promising. Containmentand sanctions have failed to change Iran's course. A preventive
military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities would at best
delay its nuclear program for a few years while exposing Israel and U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq to
retaliation. And there is no realistic prospect of toppling the Iranian regime, either through military action
or through support of an internal uprising. There are
no guarantees that trying to engage the Iranian government more constructively would yield better results
than current policy has. But a sincere attempt that
failed would at least reinforce the case for then resorting to more hard-line options, in the eyes of both the
American public and the international community."
Pragmatism, not idealism, should dictate American
foreign policy throughout the Obama years, and that
means open, direct, meaningful talks with Iran. It also
means an end to systematic political arrogance, and the
realization that we still hold considerable power in
most of the world. If only we can be less clumsy in
wielding it.

tory, these traditions vary depending on
the fan and the sport. Personally, I prep
for playoffs by combining my two favorite
things: sports and movies. When playof
fever starts to infest the nation, and mos
sports fans turn to ESPN, I turn to my
DVD collection. Before my teams begin
their playoff competition, I watch a movie
featuring the sport of the season
Although not the most critically
acclaimed films, I tend to choose movies
that remind me of the excitement and

honor of sports.
For Super Bowl XLIII, I turned to the reliable classic (if you apply a
very liberal definition of the word "classic") "The Replacements." For
those who have not seen it, the movie tells the timeless story of a
greedy professional football team that goes on strike a few games
before the playoffs and the no-name, heart-of-gold players the coach
recruits to replace them. At first glance the film seems to contain
everything necessary to make it a B-movie hit: the attractive yet sensi
tive quarterback, the motley crew of supporting players with enough
quirks to leave serious doubt as to their sanity and, of course, the
cheerleader whom the quarterback wins over after initial resistance
Yet when watching it once again in prep for this year's playoffs, I was
reminded of a line from the movie that has always bothered me. In a
back and forth between coach and quarterback on the dangers of pro
fessional football, the coach says, "that's why girls don't play the
game."

This quote is even repeated later in the film, again as some sort o
testament to the true manliness of the film's hero, apparent in his will

ingness to win the game in the face of great personal harm and imply

ing, or more accurately stating, that a woman in his position would not
have been able to do the same. Although I recognize that in the history
of football there have been few female players, and that many support

the argument that the technical aspects of the game do not lend them
selves to the success of female athletes, I sincerely doubt that the fact
that it is "rough out there," as this coach says, is the reason girls don't
play the game.
As a sports fan, it is hard not to notice the lack of professiona
women participating in team sports. The fact is that women are not
given nearly enough chances and not nearly enough encouragement to
play sports, especially such contact sports as football or hockey. This is
the reason they don't play
not because they are incapable. Even
when women are able to become successful in a sport, usually due to
Title IX accommodations or the creation of professional women's
teams, the media coverage remains minimal and often objectifies the
female athletes.
According to a report published by the American Psychiatric
Association's Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls, as female ath
letes become more visible in the media, trends show that the amount o
sexualization of these athletes increases at an alarming rate. This sex
ualization can be seen in a higher percent of time spent focusing on the
faces of female athletes compared to men and the use of much more
suggestive posing in photographs in magazines such as Sports
Illustrated. These trends of objectification can even be seen in the com
ments made by sports announcers, including the description of the 1999
U.S. women's soccer team by several media outlets as "booters with
hooters." This is a team that has won the World Cup twice, as well as
three Olympic gold metals and numerous other championships, yet one
of its players is still spoken of as owning "the most talked-about breasts
in the country" by a national media outlet, according to the APA task
force's report. Coverage like this counteracts any good press given to
the increasing prominence of women's sports in this country anc
serves to disprove the idea that with this increase we have somehow
solved the problem of gender inequality in sports.
It is difficult to create fair programs that encourage girls to ge
involved in sports that until recently have been male-dominated. I
applaud the few programs that attempt to take on this task, including
notable events such as the Sixth Annual Girls' and Women's Martin
Luther King Holiday Ice Hockey Tournament. The tournament fea
tured 37 teams of female hockey players, ages six to 36, in a weekenc
packed with games at the San Jose Sharks' facilities in San Jose, CA
according to coverage in the local paper and during recent Sharks
game broadcasts. The tournament and its media coverage are good
steps toward encouraging more girls to get involved in sports like hock
ey, even if it simply proves that there are girls out there who want to
be involved in these sports. More events and programs like this are
needed to truly achieve gender equality in all sports, from profession
al soccer to youth hockey.

THE PHOENIX

BY MADDIE WILLIAMS

When discussing badminton with Swat students, the general level of knowledge varies dra-

matically. "Isn't that something you do for RE.
credit?" Rachel Branker 'l2 said. "I mean, I don't
think we have a team or anything."
In fact, Swarthmore does have a badminton
team and a pretty good one at that. However,
lack of knowledge about the college's varsity
badminton program is certainly not uncommon
or something to be ashamed of. After all,
Swarthmore boasts one of only two varsity bad-

minton programs nationwide. While many other
schools have competitive club badminton programs, head coach Bhavin Parikh of the
Swarthmore badminton team cites the level of
access to much-needed resources as one of the
perks of a varsity program. The varsity status
also comes with a different sense of commitment
from the athletes and some national attention,
he said.
Unlike some varsity sports at Swat, no formal
recruiting process exists for badminton.
Interested athletes with varying levels of experience contact Coach Parikh on their own.
However, the fact that badminton does not
recruit with the same vigor as other varsity
sports certainly does not mean that it does not
possess the same intensity and team commitment. During the fall and first half of the season,
the team undergoes high-level fitness and skills
conditioning. In the second half of the season
Parikh concentrates on "tactics and execution."
Some spectators may not considerbadminton
a game requiring exceptional fitness, or may
even view it as a sort of a low-key form of tennis.
On the contrary, however, according to the
Badminton Association of England, badminton
is a very demanding sport both physically and
mentally. Rallies are often short bursts of
intense speeds, followed by a very briefrest period. Competitive matches can sometimes last up
to 45 minutes, which means that players must
also possess high levels of endurance. Good players should be agile and quick, as well as mentally sharp. The high speed of play coupled with
short rallies means players must compute tactics and make decisions in mere seconds.
Because Swarthmore does not actively
recruit badminton players, athletes enter with
varying levels of experience. May Maani 10, a
member of the Swarthmore badminton squad
currently studying abroad in London, said she
had really only played "backyard badminton," a
popular pastime with friends and neighbors at

her childhood home in China. "I came to Swat
and the coach said, 'O.K., forget everything
you've ever learned, and we're going to start
from scratch.'" She said the more competitive
play has been very different, but "in a good

way."

Other players, like co-captain Kim Kramer
'lO, did have competitive experience at the high
school level. Kramer entered the world of competitive badminton at the age of 12. She said that
badminton before Swarthmore was mostly an
individual sport. "Here, when we play against
other schools or play in team tournaments, the
atmosphere is really different because every-

body is pulling for you," she said.
This close team dynamic, coupled with
focused training, has propelled Swarthmore's
program
badminton
to great
success.
Badminton debuted as a varsity sport at
Swarthmore in 1938. This first season consisted
of only one match, against Ursinus College.
Today, the team competes in both open tournaments and league matches in a season.
Everyone participates in open tournaments, and
nine players are chosen to compete in the league
matches based on their previous performances.
The Garnet squad competed in the Main Line
Doubles Tournament at Bryn Mawr on
Saturday, January 24. Kramer and Maithili Atul
Parikh 'll won their bracket while the "beginners gained valuable experience," according to

Coach Parikh.
While there are many talented players on the
Swarthmore roster, some standouts have'
emerged. Kramer is currently ranked 13th in the
national women's singles rankings and has
secured three consecutive singles and doubles
titles in the Pennsylvania State Open. Parikh
was the runner-up in the very same final, which
would have been a Swarthmore victory no matter the outcome. Coach Parikh also cites co-captain Karma Lama 'O9 as an "excellent athlete"
and leader, while Maani said that she "brings a
lot of life and humor to the team."
Looking ahead, Coach Parikh cited ambition
to rebuild the team's base as an important goal,
as several players will be graduating within the
next two years. The team must also begin preparations for the Mid-Atlantic Classic Tournament
in February and Pennsylvania State Open in
March. More generally, Coach Parikh wants to

use his position to spread awareness about badminton, a "relatively unknown sport in the

United States."
The badminton team will compete next at
Bryn Athyn College on Tuesday, February 3 at 7

Injury and frustration hinder men's basketball
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
In the midst of an already difficult season,
Swarthmore men's basketball suffered another blow last Wednesday when starting
guard/forward Danny Walker 10 suffered a
concussion in a 90-71 loss against Washington.
The unfortunate injury spoiled the Garnet's
return to the Tarble Pavilion on Saturday
afternoon against Ursinus when they began a
four-game homestand. Eight of the last nine
games had been played away from
Swarthmore.
The team sorely missed Walker's production (second on the team in points, rebounds
and assists) and lost the first two games without him to fall to lrls overall and 0-10 in the
Centennial Conference. As a consolation,
Muhlenberg and Swarthmore combined to
make 38 of 39 free throw attempts, a new
NCAA Division 111 record.
Monday's game versus Muhlenberg (9-7,5-5
CC) followed the reverse trajectory of
Saturday's Ursinus game. The Garnet began
strong and had continued success in the first
half against the Mules. "We knew coming in
that this team was vulnerable to us," Sam
Lacy 'll said. He noted that his team closed
out the Ursinus game with a high level of
intensity, and "this game came out with that
fire from the beginning."
An eight-point swing with 6:53 left in the
first half exemplified this fire. With the Mules
up six points, forward Marc Rogalski 'l2
blocked a shot attempt, Hoover Long 'l2 corralled the miss and co-captain Matt Allen 'lO
received the pass for an easy layup before the
Muhlenberg defense was able to recover. After
a defensive stop, the Garnet cut into the lead
again after Lacy was fouled on a 3-point
attempt as time expired. He made all three
shots from the charity stripe to pull the
Garnet within one to 20-21 Captain Raul
Ordonez 'O9 gave Swarthmore the lead thirty
seconds later with a 3-pointer.
The entire run occurred with Muhlenberg
junior Ryan Foster on the bench. Foster tallied
a game-high25 points. After he returned to the

game, the score went back and forth for the
remainder of the half, and Swarthmore
entered the break with a 32-29 lead.
The Garnet continued to play strong basketball for the first six minutes of the second
half and led 41-37 before things began to fall
apart. For the next four minutes, Muhlenberg
held Swarthmore scoreless by forcing seven
turnovers and capitalized on that drought by
scoring ten points to gain a 47-41 lead with ten
minutes left. The Garnet never led again.
Head Coach of the basketball team Lee
Wimberly identified the turnovers as the main
area of concern. "I'd like to do a better job of
taking care of the ball," he said. "That's really
the only thing I wasn't happy about besides
the refereeing."
If the referees gave Muhlenberg an advantage, then they certainly capitalized on it by
making all 26 of their free throw attempts, the
most without a miss in Centennial Conference
history. The Garnet held its own as well, making 12 of 13 free throws, which combined with
Muhlenberg bettered the Division 111 mark set
by Muskingum and Ohio Wesleyan in 1981
(combined 37-for-39).
Lacy agreed with his coach that the team's
main problem is controlling the number of
turnovers (the Garnet had 14 in the second
half), but he also recognized another obstacle.
"We've just got to play two halves, treat both
halves as a separate 20 minutes," he said.
"There's no coasting in this league. Everyone
will come at you." That is exactly what
Muhlenberg did, and they ended up beating
Swarthmore by eight points, 73-65.
The Garnet will have to manage without
Walker for at least two more games with his
tentative comeback slated for next Saturday,
Feb. 4, for a game at Dickinson. His absence
affects the offense the most. "People that don't
normally take shots have to take shots. They
have to assume the responsibility," he said. It
won't be easy, however, because Walker's athleticism and ability to drive are hard to replicate. "We don't really have anyone else like
[Walker]," Lacy said.
On the positive side, the imminent return
of Michael Giannangeli 'l2 from a wrist injury

should energize the team. His recovery is doubly significant as depth has been an issue for
the Garnet in the last two games. Swarthmore
only played seven players in each game,

Women’s basketball wins two, enters top five
BY DANNY FRIEL
dfriell@swarthmore.edu
Two consecutive Centennial Conference wins in the past
week have put the Garnet women's basketball team one step
closer to reaching the Centennial Conference championship
tournament. Swarthmore came out on top at Washington
last Tuesday by a score of 58-53 and defeated Ursinus at home
on Saturday by a score of69-50. The

playoff berth.
In order to make the conference
tournament, Swarthmore must be
among the top five teams in the
conference standings, which are
determined by each team's record
against conference opponents.
Currently, Swat (9-8 overall) stands
in fourth place in the eleven-team field. Gettysburg and
Dickinson also have records of 6-4 in conference play and
sandwich Swarthmore in the rankings by virtue of the
results of head-to-head matchups, which are used to break

ties.

Next month, the fourth- and fifth-ranked teams in the
conference will face off to fight for a spot in the semifinals
against the top-ranked team. Currently firmly established
atop the leader board is #25 Muhlenberg, undefeated within
the Centennial with a record of 11-0.

at 299 points, averaging 18.7 points per game, also leads the

Her expertise on the court spearheads the Garnet offense,
while off the court her knowledge provides valuable insight
into Swarthmore's strategy. "Initially, our biggest problem
was holding our defense together, but that has definitely
improved," she said. She also added that "not letting the

been an area of focus lately for the

women.

In the meantime, Swarthmore
has managed to win games as the
result of contributions from a large

number of players on the team.
Against Washington, it was Nicole
Rizzo 'l2 who sank a three-pointer
with less than a minute left in the
game to spark a 5-0 run that broke a
53-53 tie. Against Ursinus, Ceylan

Bodur 11 scored her first double-double (double-digit figures
in. both scoring and rebounds) of the season to propel the
Garnet past the Bears. Outstanding performances like
these, coupled with Stockbower's potent offense and a conference-leading shot-blocker in Summer Miller-Walfish 'll,

are the makings of a daunting all-around roster.
Indeed, after finishing last season with a conference
record of 5-13, the Swarthmore women have already made
significant improvements. The transition from so-so to somuch-better hasn't gone unnoticed. "Considering where we
finished last season, a lot of people didn't regard us very

as the
season unfolded and Swarthmore started "winning some
games, people started taking notice of our wins." Rizzo also
recognizes the low expectations of the squad, noting that
"We've surprised a lot of people. I really think it's anyone's
highly," Stockbower said. However, she added that

conference at this point."
Swarthmore is only 15 games out of second place, which

would be considered safe territory if the team can establish

itself there within the next couple of weeks. Of course, the
nature of the ranking system requires that Swarthmore
receive a little bit of help. Over the next string of games, any
losses posted by Gettysburg, Dickinson or Franklin &
Marshall bode well for the Garnet's playoff hopes. In the
meantime, it's a mad scramble in the middle of the

Centennial.
Where can Swarthmore improve in the next month?
"Defense," said Head Coach Renee DeVarney. She added
that "we are a pretty good offensive team, and on days when
our defense is good, we are really good [overall]." When
asked which games in particular will be critical in the
upcoming weeks, she responded, "All of them." DeVarney
explained that while Swarthmore is expected to win some

games, and others are considered to be more difficult, the
Garnet can't afford any losses. She cited the upcoming
match against Franklin & Marshall as a key game.
Swarthmore dropped a match on the road against the Blue
Jays

earlier this month by a score of 74-57.

The Garnet tested their strength at home last night
against Haverford (3-11, 2-8 CC) and will host Franklin &
Marshall (8-8, 5-4 CC) in an attempt to avenge their loss on
Saturday.
