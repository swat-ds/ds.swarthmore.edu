SWIL Presents Sci-Fi Extravaganza
By

Toki Rehder

This weekend, March 7-9, Swarthmore Wardens of
Imaginative Literature (SWIL) are hosting SwilCon, a
science-fiction/fantasy convention. The convention, organized by Andrea Hall '95, Joel McNary '9B, and Will
Quale '99, is intended to "provide a forum for the fans of
the fans of the genres of sci-fi and fantasy to interact not
only with each other, but with the creators of those
genres—the authors, artists, and actors," said Quale.
SWIL is anticipating an attendance ofabout 250 to 300
non-Tri-Co people and 70 to 100 Tri-Co people. The
majority of them will be from the Philadelphia area, but
people from Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, New York
and Minnesota have registered to attend. The„ event is
free to members of Tri-Co. For non-members, the event

is $2O for the weekend and $lO for the day.
Friday night, there will be a "Meet the Guests" reception, featuring story readings and a dance demonstration
by the Society for Creative Anachronism. Saturday and
Sunday, there will be panels about"Classical/Epic Themes
in Fantasy/Sci-Fi Literature," "Women in Sci-Fi Art,"
and "Alien Anatomy." There will be readings by the
literary guests and a sketch-a-thon featuring the artists.
The Guest of Honor, Ed Wasser, who currently portrays "Morden" on the hit science fiction TV series
Babylon 5, will give keynote speeches on both Saturday
and Sunday. Jeff Menges, whose work appeared on
numerous collectable card games and role playing games
will give a keynote speech on Saturday entitled "Keystroke vs. Brushstroke: Copyright Integrity in the Age of
the Scanner." Menges will also give a keynote slideshow

on Sunday entitled "How I Got Involved in Fantasy Art
as a Career" or "Don't Let This Happen to You!" Both
Wasser and Menges will be signing autographs.
The following authors will also attend the convention:
Gregory Frost, whoseworkranges from science fiction to
the novelization of Irish legends; Michael Swanwick,
whose novel Stations of the Tide won a Nebula Award;
and Wendy Soss who has worked on several books in
White Wolfs World of Darkness role-playing system.
The following artists will attend the convention: J Read,
whose specialty is comics and cartoons; Lissane Lake,
whose work has appeared in the Mythos card game; and
Jeff Grosky, whose specialty is leather mask making.
Board games, card games, and role playing games will
be present as well as scheduled tournaments of popular
games like "Magic: the Gathering," and open gaming.

There will be a Highlander CCG tournament on Sunday.
Throughout the convention, the video room will be playing Anime, classic and hitmovies while the audio room will
be playing radio dramas, including the entire Star Wars
trilogy, plus "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In the
Tarble All-Campus space, vendors will be selling games,
jewelry, television and movie stills, and books.
Quale was inspired to plan this event because he "has
attended conventions like this as a fan for several years."
Proceeds from the SwilCon will benefit the Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS) and the Comic Book Legal Defense
Fund, which protects the First Amendment rights of
comicbook writers, vendors, and consumers. Funds will
be raised by an auction, which will feature pieces donated
by members of the sci-fi community, and the cookbook,
which will contain recipes by guests and others.

Student Fees to Rise 4.5%
Under Next Year's Budget
By

Sam Schulhofer-Wohl
The

Daily

GAZEtrt

The budget board approved
a 4.5 percent tuition hike as
room and board costs similarly rose 4.5 percent, said
President Al Bloom. The
budget assumes inflation of 3
percent, so students will face
a real increase of about 1.5
percent in the cost ofattend-

ing Swarthmore.
Bloom said next year's tuition charge will be $21,792,
up from $20,846 this year.
A space in College housing
will cost $3,854, up from
$3,688, and board will cost
$3,646, up from .$3,488.
Only the student activities
fee, which is set by Student
Council, will remain unchanged, at $2OB.

For students living on campus, College charges will total $29,500 next year. This
year the total is $28,230.
Many students won't have to
pay the full increase because
financial aid spending will
also increase, Bloom noted.
But students on financial aid
will be expected to earn more
next year.
Incoming first-year students on financial aid will be
expected to earn $1340 each
over the summer, while rising sophomores, juniors, and
seniors on financial aid will
be expected to earn $1750
each over the summer,Bloom
said. In addition, all students
on aid will be expected to
earn $l3OO during the school
year.
The summer work expec-

tation for upperclassmen reflects an increase ofroughly
3 percent over this year's
$ 1700 expectation. The hike,
which follows a controversial $lOO increase last year,
is meant to keep work expectations in line with inflation,
saidStudent Council co-chair
Sean Barney '9B, who sits on
the College Budget Committee.

Bloom said the Board
spent much of Saturday's
meeting discussing whether
to spend more money from
the endowment to pay for
financial aid after next year.
He said the administration
and Board are committed to
meeting students' full financial need in the future; the
only question is how to pay

Spring Break Service Project
Improves Philadelphia Neighborhood
Min Lee &
Toki Rehder

By

Farel saw the project as a way to "get
involved in social change in Philly." She
sees the project as having initiated changes,
if only in residents' attitudes. "I think it's
important for people to see someone taking
care of [the neighborhood]," she said. I think
it's awesome to see that kind of pride and to
see how our efforts can help to inspire it...for
every one person discouraging us there are
always another five who come out of their
house...sometimes they bring us drinks, stay
and chat, even offer to help."
Those who participated in the Winter Service Project thought the experience was
highly rewarding. "You just learn a
lot...you're being invited into a community
which appreciates your being there...andit's
a good chance to meet other Swatties as
well," said Lee. "I learn a little bit more
about Puerto Rico every time.As part of the
thank-you to Swarthmore students, the residents make a traditional Puerto Rican dinner

for us, and tell us about their culture." Ben
Wilder '99, who is returning to Norris Square
over spring break, commented, "I got a lot of
insight into things going on in North
Philly....it's a pretty rundown area...l didn't
know much about it before.." "I became
more aware of a section of society different
fromSwarthmore' s, saidKyle Aveni-Deforge
'99.
Participants in the upcoming Spring project
are highly enthusiastic as well. "I thought it
would be a lot of fun, as well as a worthwhile
and educational experience," saidTina Gourd
'99. "I look forward to tutoring the kids...also
to getting to know the community better.
Since I know Spanish, I hope to be able to talk
to the people there," said Victor Pineiro 'OO.
"I look forward to eating breakfast at 7:30
a.m. in Sister Carol's kitchen again," said
Wilder. Aveni-Deforge, who enjoyed tutoring during the last project, echoed his sentiments:. "I want to see my kids again!"

This spring break, about 15 students will
be participating in a service project in Norris
Square. The project, coordinated by Fang
Cai 'OO and Laura Fanucchi 'OO, includes
tutoring and playing with the kids who go to
the Norris Square community center after
school. They will also help painting and cleaning the center, which is located in the
Kensington area of Northern Philadelphia.
They also intend to clean up a neighborhood
park, beginning with cleaning up graffiti and
gardening if the weather permits. Americorp
also has some smoke detectors which students will help install around the neighborhood.
Participants will be staying at a community
center in Norris Square. The community center, headed by Sister Carol, is the center of
many community service projects. The coordinators anticipate that about 15 students will
participate in the project.
Cai and Fanucchi both participated in the
Winter Service Project, which motivated their
decision to co-coordinate the project over
Spring Break. "I saw a lot of aspects ofurban
life and poverty..that week in Norris Square
made me reevaluate my life and realize how
privileged I am," said Fang.
The spring break project continues some of
the same activities undertaken during the
WinterBreak projects. JenLee '9B and Claire
Farel '97 co-coordinated this project, which
entailedcleaning up parks, refinishing, painting, removing graffiti, passing out food at
soup kitchens, and installing smoke alarms.
They also tutored kids who came to the
afterschool program and took them on field
trips. "You have to be laid back in terms of
what you'll end up doing," said Farel, "because there are always a lot of projects going

Would You Pay $15,000 For These Courses?
By

David King

"At Swarthmore, classes are small, and
there's lots ofindividual attention," went the
rhetoric. "And what's more, if we don't offer
what you want, you can cross-register at
nearby Bry n Mawrand Haverford—forfree."
And so it went a yearand a half ago, when
I was trying to decide on a college. At
Swarthmore, you'll get a good education,
they said, because classes are small, the professors are good, and you can cross-register.
You'll get the best ofall worlds, they insisted,
in an intimate liberal arts setting.
For all intents and purposes, they were
right.
But after a semester and a half here, I can
tell you, in all honesty, that our course roster
needs some updating. We need some practical classes that cover what you really need to
know to get by here— classes that are more in
touch with students' needs and more sensitive to their on-the-brink-of-insanity lifestyles.
Take heed, Curriculum Committee. I've
taken the liberty of proposing an addendum
that I think will prove quite satisfactory to our
needs (to be filed under M, for Miscellaneous). Feel free to draw from it as you will—just remember of David when Fiske and
Peterson's start calling.
Ml. Class Selection. Why must we suffer?
Is it all worth it? Is the Administration stand-

ing in the corner laughing? These questions
and more are touched upon, as are various
methods for easing the pain of registration,
avoiding infamous professors, and planning
classes around a four-day weekend. Methodology is based on the books "Engineering
Means Never Sleeping Late" and "Registration Day: How to Avoid Getting Screwed."
Primary Distribution Course.
M2. An Introduction to Public Computing Centers. Students learn the ins and outs
of utilizing the computing centers to their
fullest. Topics of instruction: the art of printing multiple copies at five-minute intervals,
securing a computer during finals week with
minimal violence, and planning your work
schedule to fit with that of the cute
Consultant's (when applicable). Majorthemes
include: the existence of Kohlberg and the
well-hidden Language Lab printer. Required
text: "Yes, You Can Access Your Mac from
the Network."
M5.Keeping Your Sanity. Basic survival
skills are taught, including the use of SEPTA,
directions to Crumhenge, and howmuch time
is too much time in Hicks. Infuriating professors are clearly identified early on, as are
"those you just don't want to live with."
Techniques such as seeking out the
CappuccinoBar during the worst ofmigraines
and remembering your family are emphasized. In addition, a copy of the Quakers'
nonviolent ideology is distributed (but is rarely

referred to). Primary Distribution Course.
Special priority to be given to second semester seniors and those recommended by Psych
Services.
MlO. Welcome to the Ville.This informative class tours the booming metropolis of
Swarthmore. As students walks through the
Borough, they discuss such ideas as lack of
competition, ramifications of isolation, and
the thought process behind building a single
restaurant. Great care is taken to avoid the
very dangerous areas of downtownSwarthmore, and while at the train station, alternate
routes to Philadelphia are pointed out. (Night
tours are also available, but stop only at
Renato's.)
Mil. Surviving Sharpies at Rush Hour.
Though not required, this class is strongly
recommended to all first-years and other incoming students. Such basics as backpackdodging, deciphering entree names, the art of
snatching the last utensil, and identifying the
SWIL tableare covered. Also, skill-building
games are played, including Talking Your
Way Past the Checkers and Observing How
Long the Spoon Gets Kicked Around Before
Being Picked Up.
M2l. Securing a Parking Space. This
class is open to all students but is geared
toward first-years and sophomores. In the
first quarter, elementary skills are taught,
such as the use offlashers by the Rose Garden
and swerving to beat the other guy. In the

Swarthmore History

second, mastery techniques are covered in
detail, including training in the use of a police
scanner to avoid Public Safety patrols and
perfecting the "innocent victim" look. Fake
permits are strongly discouraged but are available at a price.
M5O. All About the Arboretum. M5O is a
time-consuming class with a substantialreading component, and as such, is offered primarily to upper-level art majors. The following
texts are required: "Don't Pick the Flowers,"
"Pick the Flowers and Die," and "Outrunning
Public Safety After Picking the Flowers." In
addition, friendly, helpful arboretum employees instruct students on getting the longest life out of their neglected plants and the art
of dodging oncoming bullets while flower-

picking.
MB6s. AI Bloom Impersonation Seminar. This seminar class, open to all aspiring
impersonators,explores various ways of"doing Al." Students will become proficient in
subtle Al nuances, including "the greeting"
and "the handshake."
Time will be spent exploring Al's sound
bite on the school's Web page, and the class
will take weekly field trips to Parrish 3rd
West, home of Al Bloom's Secret Thoughts.
No prior experience is necessary, but students are encouraged to spend as much time
with Al as is possible.
Stay tuned on this, folks. With any luck,
Martin Warner should have these up on the
Web in no time.

Greek Organizations Once Thrived at Swat
By Emily

It's

Shartin

no secret that Swarthmore does not
have what one would call a raging Greek
life. Swatties may find movies like Animal House amusing, but it is difficultfor most
to see their college experience mirrored in the
antics of JohnBelushi and his toga-bedecked
brothers.
But nonetheless, Greek life at Swarthmore
has had a long and, at various times, controversial history. According to Mary Ellen
Chijioke, Curator of the Friends Historical
Library, fraternities began in the late 1800s
largely as institutions for bonding among
elite college men. Additionally, because of
the strict codes of conduct imposed on
Swarthmore students, men and women often
did not have many places to meet without
chaperones. Parties sponsored at fraternity
houses provided important opportunities for
co-ed socializing to take place.
There are currently three fraternities in
existence at Swarthmore. Those whofeel that
even three is an extravagant number for such
a small school may be interested to learn that
in the early 1900s, there were 11 active fraternities at Swat. Six of these were the so-called
"women's fraternities"—Kappa Alpha Theta,
Pi Delta Phi, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta
Gamma, Chi Omega, and Phi Mu—housed in
what have become Bond and the Lodges.
Each women's fraternity pledged $lO,OOO to
pay for the cost of a Lodge with a kitchen,
locker room, living and meeting room, guest
room for alumnae, and bathroom.
The existence of women's fraternities was
always a highly-debated issue, but it came
underparticularly heated scrutiny early in the
19305. In November of 1931, Swarthmore
women seriously proposed the abolition of

years. Sensational rumors have since circulated that the cause of the sudden stir over
women's fraternities was the suicide of a

mentionedabout men's fraternities at Swarthmore—Kappa Sigma Pi, Phi Kappa Psi,
Delta Upsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, and Phi
Delta Theta. These fraternities continued to
thrive at Swarthmore with dozens of new
pledges every year.
Needless to say, Swarthmore students have
always attractedattention on thefront linesof
the fight for equality: by the 1950s and '6os,
the national organizations of Phi Delta Theta
and Phi Kappa Psi were still practicing discrimination of the basis of race and religion.
In response, the Swarthmore chapters decided to break their national affiliations, and
the local organizations of Tau Alpha Omicron and Phi Omicron Psi (the Omicron was
later dropped) were established.
The five Swarthmore fraternities continued to operate until the 1960s and '7os when
students simply began to lose interest and
membership numbers began to dwindle. Most
of the fraternities had no major alumni support and were making increasingly small contributions to campus life.
Delta Upsilon and Phi Psi were the only
fraternities to survive this period. Phi Psi

encountered difficulties with administration
during the late 1980s and early '9os over the
outstanding fines the fraternity owed the college; it was ultimately forced to shut down for
a short period of time. But with proper
fundraising and alumni support, Phi Psi was
able to pay back the money and is now beginning to thrive as a campus institution once
again with a membership of 16 brothers.
DU has had a fluctuating membership
throughout its history and currently has about
35 brothers in its local chapter. Famous DU
brothers from Swarthmore include: Philip T.
Sharpies 'lO, Thomas McCabe 'l5, and H.
Thomas Hallowell '29.
In addition to Phi Psi and DU, Swarthmore
has recently seen the establishment of a local
chapter of Phi Beta Sigma. The national Phi
Beta Sigma organization was founded on a
policy of no discrimination and a commitment to community service. Says Shawn
Beckett '97, one of the six founding members
of Swarthmore's chapter, "We are men striving for change, not just politically, but in
smaller ways as well."
Members ofDelta Upsilon, Phi Psi, and Phi
Beta Sigma all agree that fraternities generally have a bad reputation at Swarthmore, and
it is this reputation that the three fraternities
are hoping eventually to dismantle. Says DU
Brother Tony Buendia '9B, "The campus
tends to focus on the negative aspects of
fraternities, not the positive." Besides thefact
that many brothers are honors majors and
athletes, all of the fraternities are also involved in community efforts both on campus
and in areas like Chester and Philadelphia.
Because Swarthmore is a unique school,
Aaron Bond '97 of Phi Psi notes that those
involved in fraternities at Swarthmore cannot
be expected to fit the "classic" frat brother
stereotype. "Swatties are obviously not looking for, say, a state university experience," he
says. He encourages people to come to the
fraternities and see for themselves that common stereotypes do not always apply.
The Greek scene at Swarthmore has
gone many changes since its inception in the
late 1800s. While fraternities obviously remain important as social organizations, they
are no longer simply the co-ed party houses
that they used to be. Theircommitment to the
social atmosphere on campus and in the community has expanded to include a much wider
scope of activities.

Thumbs
Up To
Thumb Wars!

The

world would be a very different
place if all conflicts were solved with
thumb wars.
Thumb war, as we all know unless you
were an only child and have spent the majority of yourformative years in a small box, is
a game in which you grasp the hand of your
opponent and try to pin down his thumb with
your thumb as he tries to pin down your
thumb. The game is best played on a table or
other flat surface.
It's a widely held misconception that the
guy (or girl) with the longest thumb will win
in the battle of the thumbs. It is true that the
length of your thumb can be a factor in the
conflict, but the true thumb war champion
possesses many qualities beyond the measure of his tactile member.
Flexibility and strength are importantkeys
to victory. If you can reach around to the base
of your opponent's thumb and pin them from
there using the full length of your thumb over
theirs, you will be a formidable opponent.
But a speedy thumb doesn't hurt your
chances either. Bobbing and weaving will
help by keeping the thumb out of your
opponent's reach and tiring out your
adversary's digit, enabling you to secure his
thumb with less of a struggle.
Last and most importantly, a good thumb
war player knows thumb war strategy. The
fake-out is a popular ploy. You lay your
thumb down in fawning acquiescence, and
when your opponent moves to secure you,
quickly lift your thumb out of harm's way
and pin him instead.This strategy works best
on opponents under the age of six. If your
competitor is a bit older, though, you'll probably need a more sophisticated ruse.
If you find yourself in dire straits during a
thumb war, try shouting suddenly, "Hey,
look behind you! Isn't that Gillian Anderson,
the actress who plays FBI agent Dana Scully
on the hit television show "The X-Files,'

What

if World War II had

been Hitler and Roosevelt
sitting at a table duking it
out with their thumbs?
wrestling naked withWillard Scott in a tub of
chocolatepudding?" As your foe turns to see
these imagined antics, pin him down.
So if all conflicts were solved with this
game of skill and strategy, how would the
world be different?
What if World War II had been Hitler and
Roosevelt sitting at a table duking it out with
their thumbs? It would have been over in a
matter ofminutes and the outcome, I believe,
would probably have been the same. Hitler
was a little guy, after all, and Roosevelt had
all that upperbody strength, so FDR would' ve
won anyway. We could have saved a lot of
aggravation.
Our entire culture would have to change
along withthis change in conflict resolution,
though. We would all start going to the gym
to exercise our thumbs. We'd work with the
Thumb Master instead of the Thigh Master.
We'd all have thumb mills instead of treadmills. People with really shapely thumbs
would wear thumb thongs.
Perhaps we would elect a president based
on his dexterity withhis digits and his plan for
a comprehensive thumb care program instead of boring debates and morality issues.
Exhaustive amounts of time and money
would be poured into research for finding a
cure for hangnails. Manicurists wouldbe the
most highly paid professionals in the business world.
A new genre of music would develop: the
thumb war songs. Of course, the classic thumb
war song is "One, two, three, four /1 declare
thumb war." But new songs could be developed that would be more pertinent to the
conflict at hand. For example, what if the
Canadians came and tried to conquer Maryland? We would have to fight them off in
thumb to thumb battle. I think an apt introductory song would be, "One, two, three,
four. I want Baltimore."
Life here at Swat would change dramatically, too. We'd have a new major in Thumb
Studies. We'd go to classes named The History of the Thumb in Early Modern Europe
and The Pinky Finger as the Other.
There would be a semester-long class dedicated to the study of the social ramifications
of that famous nursery rhyme: "Little Jack
Horner sat in a corner eating his Christmas
pie. He put in his thumb and pulled out a
plum, and said 'What a good boy am I!"' You
would have to write a 10-to-12 page paper
exploring Mr. Horner's repressed sexuality
and how this negatively affected his table
manners.

Lecture attendance highlights campus trend
Tuesday marked the second day in what is bound to be one of the longest
weeks during Swarthmore's school year—the week before spring break. And
amidst midterms and dreams of the week to come, Swarthmore had what
promised to be one of the biggest activist events ofthe year on Tuesday night.
Unfortunately, it didn't appear to quite be the day for activism. The crowd
fell quite short of filling LP AC, even without the cinema section open. After
Dr. Mary Frances Berry, the second in the Women's Victories Cooper Lecture
series, organizers of the event blamed themselves: maybe the posters went up
too late. After all, Sarah Weddington, the first lecturer in the series, packed
the auditorium.
But no blame could be put on the organizers for Tuesday night: in addition
to colorful posters plastered all around campus, students put signs up in the
shape of strawberries withslogans like "Stop Stoop Labor," a reference to the
working conditions of strawberry workers in California. Students also tabled
all day Tuesday in Parrish Parlours to inform the community about the plight
of strawberry workers. It seemed like mention of the lecture would be hard to
miss.
Apparently it wasn't. Waiting outside the auditorium justbefore the lecture
started, we overheard a student ask an usher what was going on inside. When
she replied that Dolores Huerta was speaking, the student then questioned
who that was. Now we don't expect Swarthmore students to be conscious of
every activist, even one as important as Huerta. We know thatfew of us really
pay close attention to the outside world and that something like campaigns for
basic rights of workers out on the strawberry fields in California may not
always appear to be quite as pressing as our own lives. But we do expect
students to pay a little more attention to what happens here on campus.
This is unfortunately only one example of a larger trend we have been
noticing. Attendance at various lectures and events have simply not been as
high as expected. One of the main reasons for bringing speakers on campus
is to encourage Swarthmore students to become more aware of issues that are
larger than this campus, and to participate in various movements around the
country. The few students who regularly attend lectures do become inspired
to find out more about how they can get involved. We only wish that there
were a few more of them.
Perhaps speakers at Swarthmore have become such a commonplace occurrence that we've begun to take them for granted; there's no longer the same
novelty in hearing the author of the book you just finished for class speak
because that happened last semester, too. But part of the advantage of
attending such a small school with so many resources is that we can have
speakers the caliber of Huerta... and we can all fit in the auditorium to hearher
speak. These are amazing opportunities, and we would like students to
remember that.

Opportunities should not be limited by finances
The Board of Managers met again this past weekend. In the process of
approving the budget and making crucial decisions like fully committing to
need-blind financial aid policies in admissions, it was declared that the
amount of money students on financial aid are required to make over the
summer will be increasing by fifty dollars this year because of inflation.
Now we realize that fifty dollars is not a tremendous amount, and we also
realize that this decision stemmed from necessity and not from some intense
desire to ask students to work a little bit harder this summer. We also realize
that this decision may have nothing to do with the Board of Managers.
But what this decision points to is something we find rather problematic in
the Swarthmore experience. Because students on financial aid (currently over
half the students on campus) are required to contribute the majority of their
summer earnings to their tuition, these students don't have too many options
for how they can spend their summers. There is, of course, the option of
finding some other way of making that money and allowing yourself a
summer not constrained by finances, but this is a difficult choice.
Summer earnings which are factored into financial aid packages basically
mean that financial aid recipients do not have the choice of spending their
summer doing activist work like Freedom Summer '96 (which many Swatties
on and off financial aid participated in last year) without putting themselves
somewhat in debt. Nor do they have the opportunity to take unpaid internships, which often provide the best learning and research experiences for

undergraduates.
We realize that Swarthmore already does a great deal for students on
financial aid, but we would like to suggest that they attempt to devise some
way for financial aid recipients interested in doing nonprofit work over the
summer to receive grants or stipends. Although these are available now, they
are limited in number and the competition is fierce. Taking out more loans is
an option for some students, but others have already reached their maximum
limit. And loans still mean debt, especially for students who are planning on
going through another three or more years of schooling before entering the
work force.
■
It seems essential to recognize that the ultimate goal of receiving a
Swarthmore education is not to work at the highest paying jobs we can find,
either during the summers or after graduation. Indeed, in general, the
College's atmosphere places a tremendous de-emphasis on making money
for money's sake. We're encouraged by our professors and our fellow
students to reach out to our communities; we're encouraged to put our
intellects to use continually, and none of this energy or passion should be
restrained by financial worries.
We are not asking theCollege to find a way to financially compensate every
student on campus who wants to do something with his or her summer that will
not involve earning money. Instead, we are suggesting that there needs to be
some further consideration into how the College can work with students to
create options so that students can have as much freedom to pursue new
activities during the summer as they do during the year.

Tell the
Truth on
Abortion
By

Jessica Harbour

Leafing through this past Monday' s
The Philadelphia Inquirer, I found a
relatively innocent-looking editorial
by Claude Lewis telling me what I
didn't know: Ron Fitzsimmons, the
executive director of the National
Coalitionfor Abortion Providers, lied
about the numberand manner ofmany
partial-birth abortions.
Remember them? If not, partialbirth abortions usually occur in the
second or third trimester of pregnancy. The fetus is partially expelled,
feet first, from the womb (hence the
name) and then has its brain suctioned
out of its head. They are still legal,
though it took a huge fight in the
Senate to keep them that way; the
House of Representatives wouldhave
banned them. Not surprisingly, the
debate was split between those who
regarded the procedure as murder,
and those who regarded it as a rare
medical procedure usually performed
to save thelife ofthewould-be mother.
And now Fitzsimmons is saying
that no, he and others were lying all
along, that the procedure is not only
not as rare as was originally believed,
it is most often performed on women
not in danger. In other words, it's just
like any other formof abortion, only
later in the pregnancy and more horrific to describe.
This makes me angry.
At the time the partial-birth debate
raged, I wasn't sure enough of my
own position on abortion in general
to take a clear position. I'm still not.
Eventually I settled on being prochoice politically (abortion should
be legal), pro-life morally (but it's
wrong), and pro-choice realistically
(but if I got pregnant tomorrow, I
can't say I wouldn't get one). And
Fitzsimmons' new revelation hasn't
changed my thinking on abortion in
general or partial-birth abortion in
particular. If anything, it makes me
less willing to take a clear-cut position—because I don't know what I
still don't know. And I'm guessing
that a lot of people on both sides of
the fence will now have to take a
long, hard look at those beliefs (and
statistics) that they've been putting
on bumper stickers all this time.
In 1992, when abortion was frequently in the headlines, I remember
reading a Newsweekarticle that mentioned a study done by C. Everett
Koop when he was Surgeon General
under President Reagan. Koop found
that women who underwent legal
abortions were much less likely to die
during the procedure than women
who gave birth. Reagan, not liking
the findings, withheld the results of
the study. I thought about thatwhen I
read about Fitzsimmons' lying, and it
angered me all over again. No matter
what your position is on abortion,
you should recognize the need for the
facts. There is too much at stake to
allow lies like these.

Contrary to what the final score
may indicate, the Garnet stayed on
the heels oftheir opponents in almost
every match.
Although #1 singles player John
Derderian '97 was defeated 6-0,6-3,
#2 Roger Werner '9B pushed his opponent to three sets, eventually losing by a narrow margin.
The #3 and #4 players Steve
Richards '99 and Nick Slimack '99

both kept their respective opponents
on court for two and a half hours in
losing efforts. The #3 doubles pairing of Slimack and John Temin 'OO
lost a close match to their opponents
as well. The pairing of John Leary
'OO and Sascha Sheehan 'OO came
back from an early 1-4 deficit to lose
a tight set 6-8.
The team posted some impressive
wins as well. Leary, at the #6 singles
spot, whitewashed his opponent 60,6-0 in a mere 40 minutes. Greg
Emkey '99 at #5 singles scored a
convincing 6-4,6-4 win over his opponent. Derdarian and Emkey —at
the #2 doubles spot—closed up with
a hard-fought 9-7 win.
Coach Mike Mullan was satisfied
with the team's performance. "Overall, it was fine for early March. Our
doubles needs to improve, and it will

"We made them bust our ass for
every point," said Leary, "we didn't
give them anything. They just happened to be on the top of their games."
"All the matches were close... I
would consider it a solid showing,"
agreed Sheehan.
The team travels to California on
Saturday for a series of matches
against local teams. Their opponents
include UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz,
the defending Division 111 National
Champions,Foothill College, as well
as ClaremontCollege. The first match
will be against Berkeley on Sunday.
Coach Mullan is optimistic about the
upcoming matches.
"My expectation is that we be competitive with our Division 111 rivals
on the west coast, that it will take two
days of adjustment to playing tennis
outdoors, and that Swarthmore will
play better with each match," he said.

This Friday and Saturday, Laine,
who qualified for Nationals in the
triple jump at the Conference Meet,
will be travelling with Coach Ted
Dixon to Oshkosh, Wisconsin to compete in the Division 111 National
Championships Competition.
"I'm a little nervous. I never imagined I'd be competing the triple jump
in nationals. Ifanything I thought I'd
be running the 400m," commented
Laine.
Over spring break the track team
will be training in South Carolina at
Coastal Carolina to get in shape for
the outdoortrack season. The team is
looking forward to another successful track season:

Heading
Down to
Dixieland

It's that time of year again,
the flowers are popping up, it's
snowing, and spring break is
upon us. Keeping with tradition, the women's lacrosse team
is trekking down to the land of
confederate flags and retired
people, Hilton Head, South
Carolina, for their spring training trip.
This year the team is stopping at the William and Mary
lacrosse tournament, where
they'll compete against other
Division 111 schools as well as
some Division I opponents.
Thereis a rumor that theymight
also play the Japanese national
team.

Following the tournament,
they' 11 continuedown to Hilton
Head, where they will practice
for three days and participate in
a play day, when the team will
face several opponents.
The team will also spend a
day on the beach, weather permitting, and attack the same
poor, unsuspecting, Japanese
restaurant where they've eaten
for the last two years.
Sarah Singleton '99 said, "I
hope it's as fun as it was last
year, but I hope I don't have a
concussion this time." The players are psyched up for a week of
lacrosse and communal living.

Swimmers Take Their
Final Laps to Nationals
By

After nearly a week's wait, three of
Swarthmore's swimmers received
word on February 27 that they would
be swimming at the NCAA Women's
National Championships, to be held
March 13, 14, and 15 at Miami University of Ohio.
Claire Arbour 'OO, Cathy Polinsky
'99, and Kristen Robertson '9B had
all made National "B" cuts at the
Centennial Conference meet but had
to wait while times from across the
nation were compiled to see if theirs
were among the top. They will now
be joining teammate Jill Belding '99,
who guaranteed herself a spot at nationals with an "A" cut, to swim in
Ohio.
Going into the meet, Arbour is
seeded third in the 200 freestyle,
Polinsky 15th in the 100 butterfly,
Robertson 12thin the 200 backstroke,
and Belding eighth in the 200 butterfly.
Down at Ware pool, these athletes
are working out with fellow National

hopefuls Brandon Walsh 'OO and
Andy Robbins '9B. Both men also
made "B" cuts (Walsh in the 200
butterfly and Robbins in the 200 backstroke), but since the men's Championship will be held a week after the
women's, these two are still awaiting
news.

Together withthe women, they had
resumed swimming around 6000
yards a day, after a few weeks rest
going into the conference meet. This
week the women have started tapering for theirmeet next weekend, while
the men finished another week of
regular workouts.
The swimming atmosphere is different from what the swimmers are
used to; instead of working out with
a pool full of 40-plus teammates, the
national swimmers now have the full
attention ofthe coaches focused completely upon them.
With this new kind of intensity,
these swimmers are honing races and
doing individualized workouts designed to perfect the particular race
they plan to swim.

Youngsters Take Over
the Baseball Field
By

David Lischer

Under the guidance of several veteran players, it will be the youth on
this year's baseball squad that may
determine its fate. Nine players from
last year's team were lost to graduation.
Last season, Swarthmore had one
of its most successful years in recent
memory. The team finished 17-13-1
overall. Its 10-8 conference record
was good enough for a tie for third

place.
The seniors have seen threecoaches
in their four years. Frank Agovino
replaces Brad Hoffman '93 at the
helm. Agovino, who pitched for St.
Joseph's University, spent the last
several years coaching at St. Joseph's
Prep, which has a highly successful
baseball program.
While Agovino focuses on the
pitchers and catchers, his assistant,
Mike Patrone, will provide guidance
to the hitters and infielders. The infield will be anchored by second
baseman Jeremy Bonder '97, a four
year starter. Bonder will most likely
be joined by three freshmen at the
other infield positions.
"It will be a big change from last
year, but we have a number of great
young athletes. I am excited at our
prospects for the season," said
Bonder.
Bonder will also play an important
role on the team's pitching staff. The
Garnet should continue to have a
strong staff. Anchored by veterans
Bonder, David Lischer '97, and Dave
Giles '9B, the staff has several new
faces. Steve Farneth 'OO and Joe
Culley 'OO arrive with high expecta-

tions. In addition, sophomores Josh
Roth '99 and Jose Villavicencio '99
will be counted on to provide effective innings.
Batting will be suspect since many
of the team's top hitters were lost to
graduation. The team's best hitter
and a First Team All-Conference selection is returning. Patrick Straub
'97, who was third in the conference
in batting last season, will direct the
gamefrombehind the plate this year.

Straub patrolled the outfield for the
Garnet last season. Andrew Lund
'99 will split time with Straub at
catcher.
There are a number of strong young
prospects. Brian Lopez-Stiller 'OO
brings solidhands, a strong bat, and
a lot of spirit to the infield. George
Rosenbaum 'OO is a speedster who
will play a large role in the team's
running game. He is also versatile
enough to play both infield and outfield positions.
Carlo Fitti 'OO and Joe Aleffi 'OO
will probably round out the infield at
third baseand first base, respectively.
Fitti has some pop in his bat, and
Aleffi is one of the faster players on
the team. Eric Nebbia 'OO could also
see time at first base or in the out-

field.
The outfield could include
Rosenbaum, Nebbia, Dan Malkoun
'97, and Rufus Frazer '99. Malkoun
rejoins the team after spending his
junior year in Italy. Frazer saw a lot
of playing time and is a strong lefty
hitter.
Over spring break, the team makes
its annual trip to Cocoa Beach,
Florida where it kicks off its season
with six games in its seven day stay.

Spring is in the air...

Softball Heads to
Florida for Training
By

Jean Quinn

This spring break, the softball team
heads to Fort Pierce, Florida where
they will open the season with eight
games. Twelve of the fourteen players on the roster are going on the trip.
In past years, the trip has provided
key preparation for the remainder of
the season. It particularly provides
practice for the conference contests
that lie in store upon the team's return
to campus.
In Florida, the Garnet will play
several early morning doubleheaders
against Division II Bryant College,
NAIA member Husson College, Division 111 Blackburn College, and
Washington College, a rival in
Swarthmore's Centennial Conference.
Head Coach Cheri Goetcheus has
many goals for the team's trip. Such
goals include "seeing where we're at
as far as preparation level and what
we need to do in order to be better
prepared for the upcoming season;
experimenting with some different

lineups and working players into different positions; and starting the bonding process so necessary for a small
team, like ourselves."
DanaLehman '9B,aveteran player,
believes the team's majopr goal is
to gain experience: we have a young
team and need to practice playing
together. We're psyched to come
back with a few wins under our belt
"

as well."

Only three members ofthis season's
team, Lehman, Michelle Walsh '9B,
and Marybeth Alvarez '9B, have at
least two years of collegiate experience. But thereis definitely a promising pool of young talent and potential. These new players are expected
to blend nicely with the skills of the

elder players.
Walsh, last year's First Team Centennial Conference third baseman,
commented, "We're looking to make
a lot of positive strides this season
towards building a respectable pro-

gram."
The Garnet hope to start a new era
in Swarthmore softball next week.
