Candidates spar during StuCo Presidential debate
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE
arollel@swarthmore.edu

On Wednesday, April 15, two
presidential hopefuls, Rachel
BeU 'lO and Shaun KeUy 'lO, met
in Kohlberg Coffee Bar for a
debate monitored by outgoing
Student

Council

President

Yongjun Heo 'O9. The debate
focused on issues surrounding
IC/BCC groups, safety on campus and approaches to working
with the student body and the

administration.
Heo opened the debate by
allowing all candidates for open
Student Council positions to
give an opening statement.
Apart from the two candidates
for president, all other candidates are running unopposed. In
her statement, Bell emphasized
the experience she gained this
semester as Student Events
Advisor and her goal of making
Student Council more approachable. She also mentioned developing a handbook or flow chart
to help student groups understand the process of getting
funding from the council, and a
plan to update the class rec book
and make it accessible to all students.
In his statement, Kelly
stressed the importance of the
moment for Swarthmore, with a
threatening financial crisis and
a new college president with a
new approach. As Student
Council president, Kelly said
that he would work to put student groups in direct contact
with President Chopp, and that
he has formulated a plan to
devote less time to academics
next year so that he can spend 20
to 30 hours a week on Student
Council issues, a time commitment that he said was necessary
to properly carrying out the
duties of the president.
Both candidates spoke about
safety issues in their statements, calling for a review of
lighting around campus, as well
as the creation of dialogue with
Public Safety to update student
safety practices.
In response to the first ques-

tion the candidates were asked,
about the implementation of a
specific issue they had proposed, Kelly hit on the safety
issue again, saying that he had
already taken note of specific
areas on campus that needed
more lighting, and that with the
input of students, facilities, and
public safety he thought that
night-time lighting could be augmented, greatly helping student
safety.
Responding to a question
about the most pressing issue
facing the student body, Bell
said that many groups on campus felt excluded, mentioning
specifically varsity and club
sports teams as well as other
student groups that were unhappy about their funding. Bell said

THE PHOENIX

that she hopes to make both
Student Council and the administration more open to these
concerns.
Many of the questions the
candidates were asked concerned IC/BCC issues. Asked
about how they've tried to keep
in touch with these issues over
their years at Swarthmore, and
how they plan to stay involved
with these groups as Student
Council President, Bell said that
attending meetings and events
was very important, as well as
speaking with the hosts of these
events after the fact, getting
information about both how the
event went and what can be
done in the future, especially by
Student Council, to make the
events even more successful.
Kelly said that he's been
meeting with IC/BCC groups
since December in an effort to
better understand their concerns, but he admitted that one
mistake he's made over his
three years here was not spending enough time with these
groups. As president, Kelly
stressed that this would be
changed.

Asked about the possibility of
Student Council helping student
groups lobby for their political
positions with the administration, both Kelly and Bell said
that they felt Student Council's
role, which is to represent all
Swarthmore students, would not
allow it to take a side in a political issue, but that they hoped to
use Student Council to make
sure that the administration
considered the opinions of all
student groups.
Responding to an inquiry
into how the candidates made
the decision to run for president, Bell said that the thought
had been in the back of her mind
for a while, and that she felt it is
a relatively easy step to take up
the presidency after already
serving on Student Council.
Additionally, she said she feels
very comfortable taking up a
more active role, especially as it
regards interacting with students and the administration.
Kelly said that he had been
considering making a run for
president this year because of a
number of problems that he
either noticed or were pointed
out to him by other students,
and he said that he felt that he
was ready to take on the office of
president in order to address
these issues.
Kelly mentioned that, in high
school, he became student body
president after not having previously served on the council, a
move he said was motivated by
similar concerns to the ones
that caused his candidacy this
year.

Asked about the issues that
motivated him to run, and if he
tried to address those issues
when they came up, Kelly point-

Ed to the Swarthmore financial
justice movement in the fall
semester. According to Kelly, he
and a few other concerned students met independently with
the financial aid office to air
their concerns.
When asked by a student
about previous leadership roles
the two candidates have had
that could help prepare them for
the presidency, Kelly referred to
his time in high school as president of the student body and his
more recent role as producer of
the play "12 Angry Men." Bell
pointed to the events she's
planned at Swarthmore, along
with the teaching she does over
the summer.
One of the most obvious differences between the two candidates arose over Bell's proposed
handbook for student groups.
While Bell said that a welldesigned and well-advertised
document could help groups bet-

ter understand, and better uti-

many people and organizations

lize, the process of requesting
funds, Kelly said that a handbook would not be his approach.
Referring to his experience running the Student Employment
Office, Kelly said beauracratic
handbooks are rarely effective
in helping students, and that he
believed increased personal
meetings with groups would better serve their needs.
The candidates disagreed
along similar lines over how to
build consensus and elicit the
opinions of students as president. While Bell mentioned having students help her set the
agenda for Student Council and
drawing out student opinion by
putting forward ideas in the
Daily Gazette and The Phoenix,
Kelly said that personal meetings with students and groups
are the best ways to build consensus, and that as president he
would hope to meet with as

as possible.
In the final portion of the
debate, the two candidates asked
each other one question. Bell
asked Kelly what he thought the
dynamic of Student Council is
currently and what he hoped it
would be as president. Kelly
said that he thought the current
dynamic is one of governing by
consensus, and he would hope to
continue this, calling it a "noble

goal."
Kelly asked if Bell, as an honors Economics major and hon-

ors Political Science minor,
would have the time necessary
to devote to her role as president. In response, Bell pointed
to current President Heo, who
managed to do a "great job,"
while still devoting time to other
pursuits.
Voting
commences
on
Saturday, April 18 and runs
through Thursday, April 23.

BREAK NEWS ALERT

Visiting student robbed at gunpoint
According to a Public Safety awareness
bulletin and a Swarthmore Borough Police
report, a Villanova student visiting McCabe
Library was robbed at gunpoint on Tuesday,
April 14 at 11:55 p.m. near the Alice Paul and
Mertz Dorms.
The student was heading towards his car,
which was parked in Bond Parking Lot,
when he passed in between the dorms and
was met by two attackers. The student was
knocked to the ground by one of two suspects
and, with the gun at his head, asked where
he was holding money. The student told the
suspects that the money was in his backpack.
During the incident, the second suspect
repeatedly asked, "Should we shoot him?"
The suspects ordered the student to keep his
head down as they ran off towards the train
station with his backpack, wallet and cell
phone.

Chief of Borough Police Brian Craig said
that a similar event, with suspects that fit
the same description, occurred 30 minutes
earlier in Springfield.
According to the Borough Police report, a
Swarthmore student witnessed the event and
described the suspects as black males with
dark hooded sweatshirts. One suspect is tall
and thin while the other is stockier. The student immediately reported the event to
Public Safety and the Swarthmore and
Springfield police searched the area but did
not find the suspects.
"We're working with the Springfield
police department to see if anything's in
common," Craig said. "We'll keep Public
Safety informed about anything we hear
about."
The police department and Public Safety
are working closely to make sure all information is properly relayed. According to
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal, the main investigation is in the
hands of the Borough Police now because the
event happened within their jurisdiction but
the matter involves a lot of cooperation
between the two groups.
"The officers are aware of it and doing

April 16, 2009

their patrols looking out for anybody who
fits that description," Craig said. "We're hoping by getting the information out we get
some more people with information."
Vice President for Facilities and Services
Stuart Hain, who was alerted at 1 a.m.
Wednesday about the event, said that for at
least the next two nights there will be an
extra officer patrolling the campus between 8
p.m. and 4 a.m.
"We're certainly working with the police
to figure out a way to solve this problem,"
Hain said. "We always have more officers on
for Friday night, we just added more for the
next two nights too until we're a little more
comfortable with what's going on."
Westphal also said that the administration
has been in close contact with deans of
Villanova. She noted that the emotional and
psychological follow-ups of the event will
happen at Villanova, "but the severity of it
happening on campus is equal to it happening to one of our students."
The issue becomes even more of a security issue as 363 admitted students and parents
are expected to arrive for Ride the Tide this
Thursday and Friday. Westphal pointed out
the basic steps to ensure safety.
"I think by alerting the campus with the
public safety awareness bulletin that all of
the students hosting specs perhaps will pass
on not to walk alone in the dark and the
kinds of things we teach our students about
how to be safe," Westphal said. "Mainly don't
walk at night without a companion."
Hain has been happy with the police
response so far, and he too stresses the need
for students to act safely.
"We're making sure people are aware,"
Hain said. "We're hoping people will pay
attention and be safe while they walk the
campus."

Anyone with further information should

immediately contact Public Safety at xB2Bl or
Swarthmore Police Department at (610) 543-

0123.

Sestak talks environment,
students lobby legislation
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE
arollel@swarthmore.edu

Andrew Cheng Phoenix Staff

Students perform as part of the Easter morning sunrise service, which also
included worship music, prayer, scripture readings and a testimony.

On Monday, April 13, Pennsylvania
Congressman Joe Sestak, whose constituency includes Swarthmore College, led a town
hall meeting in the Scheuer Room of
Kohlberg Hall on environmental policy. The
talk
was
sponsored
by
Earthlust,
Environmental Justice, Good Food Project
and the College Democrats. Sestak has a
perfect environmental voting record from
both PennEnvironment and the League of
Conservation Voters.
Though Sestak announced that he would
give a 10-minute speech followed by 20 minutes to answer questions, he stayed for over
an hour, talking with students even after
the event was officially over.
According to Blaine O'Neill 11, co-president of Earthlust, the town hall meeting
with Sestak was part of a larger effort to
lobby for new environmental legislation.
"Because of the impending climate legislation this semester's really focused on lobbying and meeting with representatives,"

not address these issues, he mentioned that
parts of President Obama's healthcare initiative were meant to tackle issues of envi-

ronmental injustice.

While discussing the intersections of
healthcare and the environment, Sestak
mentioned that President Obama's "transformative vision" included his ability to
"thread together" different issues, showing
the public how problems in one area, such
as the environment, can have a huge impact
on other aspects of society.
Perhaps the most contentious issue that
Sestak discussed was carbon capture and
storage (CCS), a process that hopes to drastically reduce the emissions of fossil-fueled
power plants by sequestering admitted carbon dioxide, usually in deep geological formations. According to Socolar, "The reason
clean coal technology is contentious is
because there's a large faction among the
environmental movement that wants to get
rid of coal entirely and there are a couple of
good reasons for that."
For Socolar, these reasons included sustainability. He said that "coal, whatever it

apossanl@swarthmore.edu

While on campus for a series of meet-

ings,
President-Designate
Rebecca
Chopp held an informal reception with

members of the Swarthmore community on Tuesday, April 14.
Chopp opened the reception with
some brief remarks, expressing her
gratitude for the support she has
received from alumni, faculty and parents. "Since my appointment has been
announced, I have received several hundred e-mails, letters and phone calls,"
Chopp said to the members of the college community gathered in the lobby of
Lang Concert Hall. "The outreach has
been an incredible welcome."
"The biggest category [of letters] I've
been getting have been from students,"
she said. One student suggested that
Chopp and her husband eat at Sharpies
for a week to learn about the dining
plan while another sent her an extensive response to an academic article
written by Chopp.
Although she is still filling her post
as president of Colgate University and
is not slated to become Swarthmore's
president until July, Chopp is already
getting to know the college community.
She introduced herself to several members of the faculty and staff, as well as to
students and alumni, for over an hour
after giving her remarks. Barbara
Mathers, Chair of the Board of
Managers, estimated that around 125
people came out to see Chopp, most of
whom were able to speak with her per-

member of SLAP. "That's how to start a
genuine relationship. We're going to
have to be working together to work
towards mutual goals that we have."
Other students came for personal
reasons. "I'm a religion minor and she's
a prominent feminist theologian,"
Justin DiFeliciantonio 'lO said. He
hopes that Chopp will help bring religion professor Jeff Stout, whom she has
collaborated with in the past, to campus.
At Colgate, Chopp has made a point
to engage in student life and maintain a
visible presence on campus. In addition
to attending student athletic events and
productions, she has also taught courses on globalization and religion. She
plans to continue these types of activities at Swarthmore. "I hope to have
lunch in Sharpies," she said. "I'm really
eager to meet the students, faculty and
staff and learn what makes this such a
great community and about everyone's
intellectual and social interests."
But according to Mathers this was
not the only reason Chopp was selected.
"One of the reasons we liked her was
that she was open and interested in
being the public face and voice for the
college," Mathers said.
"I just wanted to meet the president.
She came to our building the other day,
and I've heard that she's a really warm
person. I think her personality and
background are a great match for our
community," ITS software specialist
Mark Davis said.
"One thing that I
really like is that
she's approachable,
and that's a wonderful thing."

Heo to study health in Vietnam as Luce Scholar

swarthmorephoenix.com

Youngin Chung Phoenix Staff

Yongjun Heo was recently named one of

18 Luce Scholars for 2009-2010.

BY KATHERINE ERNST

kernstl@swarthmore.edu

Current Student Council President
Yongjun Heo 'O9 is one of 18 young

Americans to be named a Luce Scholar
for 2009-2010. As a Luce Scholar, Heo
will receive funding to work with public health initiatives in Vietnam for one
year. While many grants provide opportunities for students with extensive
experience to expand on their projects,
the Luce Scholars Program provides
funding and internship opportunities
for potential leaders without prior
experience in Asia.
Heo is a double major in biology and
public policy. His senior thesis focuses
on the way in which social safety nets
better the health of citizens who live in

rural regions of developing countries.
Heo founded a nonprofit organization,
Pemon Health Inc., in 2007 which helps
college students, health professionals
and indigenous Pemon people in
Venezuela direct their efforts towards
long-term community health programs.
"I requested to work in more of an
urban [environment] in Vietnam,
because I've been working with rural
areas for a long time," Heo said. "I'd
like to work with both, but the urban
side appeals to me now because I don't
know as much about it in terms of public health. However, I'm certain that,
without a doubt, my experiences with
Pemon Health will transfer in different
ways to my work next year, ranging
from my ability to interact with members of the community to how an organization operates."
Although Heo's heritage is Korean,
the Henry Luce Foundation encouraged
him to use his funding to work in a different part ofAsia. "They said that they
wanted your professional experience to
be something that's quite relevant to
the field that you're interested in," Heo
said. "I'm interested in public health,
and Vietnam has some serious public
health challenges. I realized when
speaking to the Luce Foundation that
Vietnam may be a better location for
me to learn about the public health
challenges that the government faces."
The Foundation will be supporting
Heo's participation in an intensive language program over the summer. Since
Luce Scholars are partly chosen based
on lack of prior experience with Asia
and Asian studies, it is quite common
for the scholars to participate in lan-

guage programs before their departure.

Although Heo intends to work for a
medical degree after he returns from
Asia, he emphasized his life-long interest in broader public health programs.
"I went to a conference last weekend,
and a public health official drew a pyra-

mid of how the healthcare system
works in the U.S. At the base of the
pyramid should be public health, but
instead we've put a lot of money into
the diagnosis and treatment of diseases
rather than the root causes of a lot of
public health problems. You flip that
pyramid over, and the apex, which is
now at the bottom, is what public
health actually is today."
The application process for Luce
Scholars is extremely rigorous, and
involves writing an essay and being
interviewed by the Committee on
Fellowships and Prizes, nominated by
the college, chosen as a finalist, and
sent to one of three locations to be evaluated in a two-day interview process
with the Luce Foundation. Since
Swarthmore put forth winning Luce
Scholars last year as well
Marshall
Morales 'OB and Noah Metheny 'O3
the college was permitted to nominate
three potential Luce Scholars this year,
instead of the usual two.
"One of the pleasures of this job is
that, with some students, particularly
students like Yongjun who apply for
several different scholarships, I get to
know them over time," said Melissa
Mandos, the Fellowships and Prizes
Advisor. "The focus of the Luce
Foundation is on awarding scholarships to people they envision as being
the future within their respective

fields, so although none of these scholarships is easy to get, I would rank
Luce among the more competitive of
them."
Former Luce Scholars Randy Exon
and Keith Reeves 'BB are both currently
teaching at the college. As a former
Swarthmore student getting his graduate degree in political science and black
studies at the University of Michigan,
Reeves was nominated to be a Luce
Fellow in 1990. He spent the next year

in

Malaysia working with the Institute for
Strategic and International Studies, the
Malaysian government's central thinktank.
"Even though I don't formally do
work on Asian issues, it's still very

much a part of who I am, which I think
is the purpose of the Luce," Reeves said,
who is also on the Fellowships and
Prizes Committee. "I don't think a week
or a month goes by that I'm not in conversation about Asia with someone,
friends, colleagues, some of my family,
students. The mission of the foundation
was for us to immerse ourselves in Asia
so that we could be ambassadors in our
respective communities, in our work,
in our professions, and that was certainly the case."
"A lot of students may feel shy about
approaching some of these opportunities, but there are all these resources
here available for us," Heo said.
"Melissa Mandos has been incredibly
helpful with so many other fellowships,
so many other applications, that I can't

Trouble brews for Sons of Iraq as accusations deepen
BY JENNA ZHU
WAR NEWS RADIO
The Awakening Movement
and its Sons of Iraq forces have
been widely praised for turning
against the Sunni insurgency
and helping to stem sectarian
violence in Iraq over the last few
years. But following the handover of the largely Sunni
groups to the Shi'a-led Iraqi
government, cracks in the system have started to show. Now,
Sons of Iraq complain of poor
treatment from the government
many haven't been paid in
months, they aren't finding jobs
with the government or security
forces, and some are facing
arrest on charges they claim are
baseless. This week, a prominent Sons of Iraq leader tells of
the discrimination he has faced
from Iraqi authorities and also
gives his take on the fighting
that broke out recently between
Sons of Iraq and Iraqi soldiers.
erupted
When
clashes
between Sons of Iraq and Iraqi
army soldiers in Baghdad's
Fadhil neighborhood, the Iraqi
government and officials in the
media described the fighting as
an uprising by the Awakening
group. However, Raad Ali
Hassan, the leader of the Sons

6

of Iraq

in the Ghazaliyah
neighborhood
in Western
Baghdad, said this description
misses the point. The fighting
was not a rebellion, he
explained, but rather came in
response to a series of broken
promises that has left the Sons
of Iraq fed up with the government.
"The Sons of Iraq have not
been paid for the last two

months, and most of them have
families," he said. The arrest of
Adil al-Mashhadani, the head
of the Fadhil Awakening
Council, in late March was
"the straw that broke the
camel's back. People were
patient up to their noses... they
were shocked when their
leader was arrested."
Hassan understands people's anger after such arrests
firsthand. He had heard
about the fighting in Fadhil
while in a Baghdad detention
center, where he had been
taken a few days earlier after
being arrested for murder.
"About a month ago," he said,
"I learned that there was an
arrest warrant against me. So,
I tried to go to the department
that issued the arrest warrant
and they refused to see me...
[Then,] last Tuesday at mid-

night, a colonel accompanied
by five officers, seven or eight
humvees, and about 30 troops

showed up and
asked me to
accompany them. They told me
that they don't have an arrest
...

warrant and only wanted me
for questioning. They took me
to a security agency and I was
interrogated for eight days." It
was only after the case came
before a judge that the charges
were dropped and Hassan was
finally freed. "I thank God," he
said. "I was released today."
Hassan is now back home,
and he hopes that the Sons of
Iraq leader from Fadhil, alMasshadani, will also soon be
released from police custody.
But he worries that the arrests
are only part of a larger, more
troubling issue that is becoming more apparent as the
Awakening groups face growing problems. "The leaders of
the Sons of Iraq are being targeted
[but] the charges are
baseless. There are several
Sons of Iraq leaders now in
...

prison."

Hassan

believes

these

arrests are part of an attempt
by the Iraqi government to settle scores with the Sons of Iraq,

some

of whom are former

insurgents.

April 16, 2009

Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki addressed such accusations in a statement, saying
that the crackdown on the Sons
of Iraq leader in Fadhil was not
politically motivated. Instead,
he explained, it came after an
extensive,
six month-long
investigation revealing alMashhadani's involvement in
underground Ba'ath Party
activities.
Still, Hassan doesn't buy
these claims. He believes the
Shi'a-led Iraqi government is
simply unwilling to support
the majority Sunni Sons of
Iraq.

"The biggest tragedy in Iraq
is that our government is
short-sighted," he said. "The
government and the U.S. forces
feel that things have become
stable in Iraq, and that everything is under control. So, they
are not obliged to keep their
promises to the Sons of Iraq."
Hassan, however, doesn't trust
the relative calm that has settled over Iraq in recent months
especially if the government
continues to alienate the
Awakening Groups. "The security challenges still exist, and
[they] are enormous."
For now, the situation in
Fadhil seems to have calmed.

The day after the fighting
broke out, Iraqi army forces
went through the neighborhood disarming Sons of Iraq.
Initially, U.S. and Iraqi officials both announced that the
group would not be allowed to
re-form.
But reports in the Iraqi
media later indicated that a
member of the Fadhil Sons of
Iraq had taken control of the
group with the support of some
in Parliament and that he was
in the process of reorganizing
the neighborhood's forces.
Additionally, some of the Sons
of Iraq's fears were quelled
when
a
government
spokesman announced that, in
spite of the fighting, the Fadhil
Sons of Iraq would be among a
Baghdad
number
of
Awakening groups who will
finally receive paychecks next
week.
The spokesman blamed the
widespread delays in paying
the Sons of Iraq on bureaucratic red tape.
Longer-term issues
like
finding jobs for Iraq's nearly
still
100,000 Sons of Iraq
remain. But until those problems are solved, most Sons of
Iraq will be content with a
steady paycheck.

Multifaceted approach reframes feminism
BY SARAH POZGAY

slong6@swarthmore.edu

The Feminist Front at
Swarthmore
A common perception of feminist activism on campus seems to
be that it lacks unity, that it simply does not comprise a cohesive
movement. While there are more
than a few active groups on campus that could be classified as
anti-sexist, many students said
the groups don'tfunction as parts
of a whole as much as they function as separate organizations
with individual aims, resulting in
what seems
a fragmented
approach to feminist activism.
Though many of the groups have
recently expressed interest in
working to change that, the overall consensus is that the diverse
nature
of
feminism
at
Swarthmore lends itself less to a
single front of activism and more
to approaching sexism from a
variety of angles and in a variety
of organizations.
Erin Heaney 'O9, offering her
perspective on feminist groups at
Swarthmore, said, "I'm not
involved in any feminist groups
on campus because I feel and felt
as a freshman that the existing
groups are not very strong as
compared to [other activist
groups]." Heaney, who was
involved in organizing the
Women in Sport Symposium that
took place last weekend, continued, "There are so many ways
legislatively, but also just socially
and in solidarity work, there's so
much work that still has to be
done [that] I do think it would be
a good thing if there was a much
more formalized and united feminist presence on campus."
On the other hand, Ariel
Horowitz, a leading member of
Vox, suggested that the reason for
this absence may be a lack of
strong demand by students for a
cohesive movement, particularly
with regard to facing sexism on
campus. "I don't think there's a
unified women's movement on
campus because I don't think that
people feel that we need one, and
if people don't feel like we need
one then we probably don't need
one for the goals that people have
here, for the level that we as a
community are at in terms offeminism," Horowitz said.
Feminist Majority leader
Urooj Khan 10 also commented
thatthe pervasiveness of anti-sexism on campus in comparison to
other places sometimes means
that there is less of a perceived
need for activism at Swarthmore.
She said, "I think one of the rea-

sons that the feminist groups on
campus have kind of gone up and
down in terms of membership is
not so much that we don't have
feminists on this campus, I think
it's because we do have so many
feminists on campus ... and so it
becomes an issue of people thinking *we don't reaUy need feminism at Swarthmore because we
all believe in gender equality,'

THE PHOENIX

and I think that's not true at all. I
think there definitely needs to be
a space here for people discussing
issues that are integral to feminism."
Many, including Heaney, feel
that regardless of campus-wide
issues of feminism and sexism,
Swarthmore should play an
activist role in problems of sexism outside the college as well.
"There's not a lot of advocacy or
legislative

movement

at

Swarthmore around women's
issues," she said, "I think if [that]
was a stronger presence that
would be a great thing."
"In my opinion I guess the
largest battles have been won
women's suffrage, Roe v. Wade
but I feel that there are some battles, some issues that should not
be ignored because they have not
yet been achieved," said Will
Predun 'O9, Delta Upsilon president, citing equal wages and fund-

ing for women in science and
mathematics as two issues that
still need to be addressed through
political activism.
Others account for the lack of
a unified feminist movement on
campus, not as a result of a lack of
demand, but as a result of changing approaches to feminism in
today's society. "Part of it I think
is a function of time," Heaney
said. "The feminist movement
today is a lot more diverse and
has a lot more opinions, and
there's not such a dogma as there

was with the first wave or second
wave [of feminism] even."
First wave feminism, which
centered primarily on issues of
suffrage, pioneered the cause of
legal equality for women. With
second wave feminism, or the
feminism of our mothers' generation, came campaigns for the
Equal Rights Amendment and a
focus on a broader range of issues
affecting women living in a patriarchal society. Second wave feminism also describes the time in
which movements such as feminist militancy and the exclusion
of men from society were most
popular. Today, the first and second waves in feminist activism
are often criticized for too narrowly defining acts of feminism
as well as for focusing exclusively
on the plight of the middle-class
white woman. With the coming of
third wave feminism, many
women have embraced a looser
definitionof the term. Many have
also become more concerned with
issues of sexism in a variety of
demographics, including women
of color, the lower class and transgender individuals.
These concerns are very much
present in many activist groups
at Swarthmore, two notable
examples being Womyn of Color

Collective and White Women
Confronting Racism. While neither of the groups is explicitly
feminist, in both organizations
anti-sexist thought plays a large
role in how issues of race are
approached, and vice versa.
Cecilia Marquez 'll, a founding
member of Womyn of Color

Collective, said, "There's no cohe-

sive feminist movement because I
feel like so many groups have
feminist perspectives It's like a
lens more than a movement."
Erika Slaymaker 'll, who's
involved in White Women
Confronting Racism, elaborated
on her experience, saying, "I
come to the group very much
with a politics based in intersectionality
so really thinking
about how sexism, racism, heterosexism, classism, ableism
how so many different oppressions come together and intersect."
Slaymaker also remarked that
thinking of feminism in conjunction with other identity issues is
often helpful in addressing the
...

problems

that the different
groups face. The example she

cited was the relationship
between queer and feminist identities. "I think that feminists really need to think that through and
figure out ways to be not just
inclusive of the trans community
but to realize the need to rework
understandings of womanhood...
I think a general feminist politics
has to come from an anti-gender
binary space," Slaymaker said,
adding that she feels "we can find
power in the fact that there aren't
just two genders and really use
that as a base to come from."
Professor Patty White of the

Film and Media Studies and
Gender and Sexuality Studies
departments said it's not hard to
see why this less classical
approach to feminism is so often
"[At
campus.
found
on
Swarthmore] there's a lot of commitment to global issues and community-based
issues
which
almost always can be defined
along gender lines as well as lines
of poverty and access and race
and all of that. But that requires
an intersectional analysis,
which is another place that feminism has gone."
Beginning this year, the
Women's Studies Program underwent a name change, making it
now the Gender and Sexuality
Studies Program. This also
reflects a less rigid and more
intersectional approach to feminism, according to Lisa Riddle
'O9, who is pursuing a minor in
the program.
White added that the decision
...

to change the name was also a
practical one. "One reason we did
that was structurally, we didn't
have enough people on this campus to have two academic concentrations, one on historically
women's studies ... and then to do
gender and sexuality; we were the
same people, we couldn't run two

concentrations,"
said,
she
explaining that in the end, faculty
felt that gender and sexuality
studies couldn't be pushed by the
in
wayside
academics
at
Swarthmore.

Commenting on rejection of
classical feminism on campus,
Heaney commented, "That may
be why some of feminism died at
[with] the rise of

identity groups and this real
desire to not look like the old
school white feminist, but I do
think there's a way to bring in the
feminist identity but also be progressive and realize that feminism means lots of things to lots
of people."
Regardless
differing
of
approaches to feminism on campus, both explicitly and nonexplicitly feminist groups have
recently expressed interest in
increasing communication and
coalition building between the
organizations on anti-sexist projects.

which isn't to say that they don't
have progressive anti-sexist values, they just may use different
terms," she said.
Speaking about her experiWhite
Women
ences
in
Confronting Racism, Sara Forster
'll said, "For us, being a group of
all white women, using the word
feminist is loaded, so I don't think
it's something that I want to be
made explicit."
Yet, some advocate reclaiming
the term "feminist" both as a
political tool and as an act of
empowerment in itself.
"I think there's something
very unifying about
people
coming together and identifying
as feminists, given that the word
has historically often been used
in a derogatory way
I think it
really works to break down those
stereotypes and negative connotations that exist along with being
feminist," Khan said, adding, "I
think calling yourself a feminist
is very much a political act, and
it's a political act that I definitely
want to engage in."
"I think on this campus you
can definitely see how feminism
is sometimes really claimed, but a
lot of times really isn't, and I don't
think that that's just here. I think
there are a lot of people grappling
with the term feminist from a lot
of different angles," Slaymaker
said.
Heaney expressed the sentiment that finding a medium
between positive and negative
attitudes toward the word is both
practical and possible. "I think
that there's a way to recognize the
women who came before us and
celebrate what they accomplished
but also be critical of what they
...

Using the "F" Word

The use of the word "feminist"
itself has been highly contested.
Either thrown around as an epithet that conjures the militancy of
second wave feminism, or viewed
as an emblem of a movement that
marginalized and excluded some
groups of women, "feminism" as
a label has been both embraced
and rejected, debated and
imposed.
"[The word feminism] carries
lots of layers of associations and
meanings. I think a lot of people
mean really different things when
they say feminist," Slaymaker

said.
Andrew Petzinger 'O9 echoed
this, saying, "I don't think we
actually hear the word feminist
very often, and I guess that may
have a lot to do with the ambiguity of using a term that's been used
in a lot of different ways and has
been criticized in a lot of different
ways."

The decision to use or reject
the term reflects political and
philosophical outlooks on the
meaning of feminism, its expression as a component of individual
identity, and its political utility
today.

"Now in third wave feminism
a lot of things are called feminism
that aren't necessarily feminism;
a lot of things aren't called feminism that are feminism because
women don't necessarily want
the label of feminism because
they associate it with all these
militant second wave things,
whereas [feminism] can support
many goals of women," Horowitz
said.
Slaymaker agreed with the latter part of this statement, emphasizing that the term "feminism"
does not necessarily represent the
goals and perspectives of contemporary advocates of anti-sexism.
"There is no one feminist movement ... and lots of people are calling themselves feminists that
have really different perspectives.
So if I call myself a feminist, what
people are perceiving me to be
with that term is so, so unclear,"
she said.
While various groups on campus advocate the empowerment of
women with respect to specific
issues, few that do so are explicitly feminist.
"It's hard to nail down a feminist group," Marquez said. "Not
everyone identifies as a feminist,

...

and

the

people

they

excluded. And I think there's a
balance there that white women
have to figure out, but I don't
think it's an impossible feat," she
said.
"To me, feminism brings the
gender analysis to the table,"
White said, adding that in part
because of this, "I don't see why

feminism couldn't still be the
word for anti-sexism."
Some have framed the discussion in terms of the goals of the
individuals and groups who
choose to do so.
"I think the decision of what
you want to call something
depends on what you're trying to
do. Are you trying to get legislation pushed through? Are you trying to build a coalition on campus? Are you trying to do awareness-raising of something? The
name you want to put forward
will change based on that," Riddle
said.

Petzinger explained that in
certain situations, he feels leaving the term open can allow more
space for individuals to grow in
their philosophies regarding the
issues. "To say that I haven't
heard the term a lot, but still feel
like I've gotten a lot inoculation of

anti-sexist thought, means that maybe at a
place like Swarthmore, it's something of an
effective strategy to downplay the question
of self-identifying as a feminist and push
forward more at the level of what are the
effects of your identifying as a feminist and
how do you manifest your identification as
a feminist," he said.
Riddle added that whatever label one
goes by, it's important to clarify the term
you choose. "Ultimately what's more
important than what you call yourself is
your thoughts and your beliefs, but I do
think it helps, if you're going to say 'Yes, I
am a feminist,' to know the history behind
that word and be able to qualify [that]."
Confronting Sexism in the Classroom

Sexism in the classroom is an issue that
all coeducational college campuses grapple
with, including Swarthmore. It's also a
type of sexism that can manifest itself subtly, often yielding no perceivable results
except a greater number of male and lesser
number of female contributors in class discussion.
"I do think that because we're at
Swarthmore we're not as critical of how
[sexism] gets played out not overtly, but in
the assumptions we make," Heaney said.
"Just because we're at Swarthmore shouldn't exclude us from being critical on a dayto-day basis."
At Swarthmore, the common perception is that sexism is more of a problem in
select departments. In particular, the philosophy department has often been cited as
a concern. For that reason, some students
started the Lady Philosophers, a group for
women to discuss philosophy. "In my case,
I think the group primarily exists because

philosophy classrooms, and sometimes college classrooms in general, can be pretty
intimidating places, not just for women,
but especially for women it seems," said
Brianne Gallagher 'O9, an involved mem-

ber of the group.
However, the way that sexism manifests
itself in the department may not be so
much due to professors as it is a matter of
women feeling uncomfortable. "A big part
of the reason we have the group is that
we've identified that women often don't
feel comfortable talking in philosophy
classrooms for whatever reason, and so we
wanted to open up a space where they
could talk about things that are important
to them, and talk about things that aren't
talked about in philosophy classrooms
either," Gallagher said.
The paucity offemale professors in this
department and others also contributes to
the issue, Gallagher said, noting however
that there are also male professors who
create a more welcoming environment
than some female ones. "I haven't encountered significant sexism in the classroom,
but I do think that there are reasons why
female students aren't talking as much,
and I'm certain that they don't begin with
Swarthmore," she said.
Khan expressed the same thought with
respect to the state of academia. "I think
it's important to recognize that there's a lot
of bias in terms of academia in general,"
she said. "I think that the way academia is
set up, and I think this is true in a lot of different professions, is that women who
don't have a lot of experience by the time
they're 35 are looked down upon."
Furthermore, some say that sexism in
the classroom is often an endemic but
unseen problem that has to do with gender
dynamics and simply who is speaking up
in class, more than it has to do with preferential treatment or other traditional signs
of discrimination. "You can see it in class-

8

rooms when men talk first; I find it really,
really frustrating. And I think a lot of men
on this campus haven't thought about the
way power works in this society and the
way men have power, especially white
men," Slaymaker said.
Feminist Majority member Michael
May 'll agreed that sexism is often a silent
scourge at Swarthmore. "I think to find
instances of sexism that we're talking
about at a school like this, you do have to
look for it; you can't just have it present
itself to you because it's not blatant... Ido

think that could be a factor, because if you
don't expect it, you're not going to be looking for it."
However, others say that for them sexism in the classroom is not a significant
problem. "I think the academic atmosphere is fine; I know women who don't like
to talk in class, but I also know men who
don't like to talk in class, and I haven't seen
it be predominantly men or women. I'm a
major within the sciences as well as a
minor within the sciences and in both
departments I've had very female-positive
experiences. I think in the academics people are very conscious of it," Horowitz said.
Sexism and Feminism in Student Life
Outside of the academic and activist
spheres, sexism and feminism can be
found in very specific parts of student life,
according to students. The most notable
locale of sexism in Swarthmore social life
is, unsurprisingly, the party scene on campus.
"I think that patriarchy, that sexism, is slippery and finds new ways to
manifest throughout, and I think that

While there is some Greek life on campus, it's not necessarily the type one associates with large public universities and

rigid rules regarding gender expectations,
according to Predun. "I don't feel that DU
enforces gender norms in comparison with
[for example] big state school fraternities
...

Within my four years we have had open-

ly gay brothers and have given bids to men
who we know to be openly gay."
Horowitz noted that even with the presence of fraternities on campus, "There
aren't gender segregated social events very
often." Horowitz said she feels this is an
important part of why sexism is less pronounced in the social life at Swarthmore
than in that of many other schools.
In terms of extracurricular activities,
students said they have not frequently
encounteredsexism. "I haven't felt like I've
needed to be a feminist here because I've
been doing everything I wanted to do and
not faced a lot of barriers [at Swarthmore]
in terms of my academics and my extracurriculars," Sara Lipshutz 'll said. Lipshutz
was involved in the Expanding Your
Horizons conference several weeks ago as
well as in the "Women in Comedy" discussion that took place on campus several
weeks ago.
Speaking from her experience as a

female student athlete, Heaney praised the
athletics program at Swarthmore, saying,
"I think our athletic department does a
reaUy good job treating women and men
equally."

More than one student also observed

that while feminism on this campus presents itself in a variety of ways and under a
variety of headings, the most notable
aspect of Swarthmore feminism is the
degree to which anti-sexist thought
envelops the campus community on an
interpersonal basis. "I would say what
really defines [feminism at] Swarthmore is
the pervasive belief among female students
that we can do whatever we want, that we
have options and are full people
I don't
think I've met any women here who don't
believe that," Horowitz said.
According to Marquez, no one formal
group could claim responsibility for maintaining the presence of feminism on campus. "I think it's unique that while we do
have Feminist Majority, feminist values
pervade the campus community and cam...

pus organizing," she said. "We're not

depending on one organization to bring
that critique to the campus community."
Petzinger, who was involved in
Feminist Majority last semester, said that
while activism certainly has a place, his
most valuable experiences with feminism
on campus have taken place in informal
settings and through one-to-one interactions with other members of the
Swarthmore community. "I think that it's
more in private, very personal things that

over the course of being at
Swarthmore that maybe push [students]
from that place of first being interested in
thinking about gender and patriarchy and
make that more robust... [at least] for me
that's been the case," he said.

Given the college's reputation as an

with the way the same students behave

a lot of people," said Gallagher.
Marquez continued in this strain,

agency."

Horowitz added, "If the party
atmosphere really reflected the beliefs
that most people hold, no one would
ever get raped here, and that's just not
the case." For Petzinger, these incon-

sistencies in student behavior can be
traced back to attitudes of feminism
and the motivations behind claiming
an anti-sexist identity. "The question
is really the degree to which people feel
like they have an obligation that's a
burden to be thinking about feminism
and the people for whom it's the opposite of a burden and is energizing and
strengthening," he said.
Still, most students still hold that
sexism in parties at Swarthmore is significantly less of a problem than on

discount
for

many other campuses, particularly

those in which traditional Greek life

holds more of a presence. "I'm some-

what concerned about
and this is
probably a common sentiment among
Swarthmore students
universities
and schools where fraternity/sorority
presence is really pronounced because
I think dangerous things happen to

women in those types of environments," Gallagher said.

Filmmaker Spiro shows
tragic wounds of 'War'
BY ISAAC HAN
ihanl@swarthmore.edu
Last Friday at LPAC, the Film and

Media Studies Department and War
News Radio hosted Ellen Spiro and
her documentary "Body of War."
"Body of War" is a documentary codirected by Spiro and Phil Donahue
that chronicles the story of Iraq-war
veteran Tomas Young as he deals with
his disability. After only five days in
Iraq, Young suffered a shot through
his collarbone and spine, leaving him
paralyzed from the waist down. The
film juxtaposes the story of his life as
a disabled person with the series of
decisions that led to the war in Iraq.
The effectiveness of the documentary lies in how personal and revealing Young's story is. In describing the
message of the film, Hansi Lo Wang
'O9, a seniorproducer and co-anchor at
War News Radio, said, "[Body of War]
forces you as an audience member to
appreciate what it means when you
say 'let's go to war.' [Young's story] is
what can happen." The way that
Young's disability is portrayed in the
film is a powerful anti-war argument
in itself. In the scene when he talks to
a congregation at a Presbyterian
Church, Young has to stop at certain
intervals to just catch his breath or to
let the pain that he experiences pass
before moving on with his talk.
Through these pauses, the viewer
really gets a sense of the pain that
Young experiences as a result of the
war.
While the horrors of Young' disability may earn him sympathy, it's
Young's sense of humor that really
makes him a likable person that the
viewer can care about. During the
Q&A portion after the screening,
Ellen Spiro remarked about how great
a sense ofhumor Young had even with
his disability. She recalled that Young
would crack joke after joke during her
time with him throughout the filming
process. It's incredible to see, over the
course of the film, that Young's humor
is not lost. During a scene when he
has to manually go to the bathroom in
a van with the help of his mom (a
process which I will not describe here
lest you get too grossed out to finish
reading this article), Young doesn't

to make a sarcastic joke when his mom messes up.
According to Spiro, it's this sense of
humor that helps him to deal with his
disability and for the viewer, it's this
sense of humor that helps us to relate
to him.
In portraying Tomas Young, the
film has a devastating personal touch.
Patricia White, the chief organizer of
the event, said about Spiro's film, "I
think that the personal aspect for me
was amazing. She had a very charismatic character. She obviously had a
great relationship with him, and I
thought that [the film] was a really
interesting portrait of disability." The
personal touch that makes the film so
touching also works in great contrast
with the C-SPAN footage of the Senate
debating going to war and formerPresident George Bush talking about
how thereal enemy is Iraq, something
we now know is not true. The difficulties that Young faces juxtaposed with
the politicians voting for the war comments ironically and effectively
against the necessity of going to war
in Iraq. At the beginning of the film,
Young's long ritual of dressing his paralyzed legs and struggling is intercut
with the votes of "yea" to the resolution to go war. This intercutting suggests that the loss that Young experiences on a day-to-day basis fails to be
justified by the government and
Young's losses are unfortunately and
tragically for naught.
With "Body of War," Ellen Spiro
and Phil Donahue have made an
important film about the pitfalls and
unfortunate consequences of going to
war, especially if the war is based on
faulty bits of intelligence. The most
touching scene in the film is when
Young visits Senator Robert Byrd, a
staunch opponent of the war. During
this scene, Senator Byrd tells Young
that he had the people in mind when
he decided to vote against the war. He
tells Young that he could not be comfortable with sending people with families and friends into war where they
could lose their lives and dignities as
Young did. "Body of War" is a powerful documentary that helps us question the validity of war and realize the
unfortunate consequences that arise
from the act of war.

Spoken word artist Stewart performs for poetry festival
On Thursday, April 9, Na Tanya Davina
Stewart performed three works of spoken word for the continuing Black
Studies Spring Poetry Festival.
Stewart's act was an impressive blend
of flowery prose and theater performance. The spoken word was also as
equally wide-ranging in its content,
from decrying the tragedy of the West
African diaspora ("A continent drained
for economic gain") to the complacency
of today's media-addicted generation
("You're hooked on your fantasy"). The
poetry festival kicked off on April 2 with
an event honoring poet Kathryn
Morgan, one of Swarthmore's first
tenured African American faculty. The
festival continues with poetry readings
by Ursula Rucker and Yolanda Wisher
on April 23 and April 30 respectively.

Celebrating Haitian culture

The band Djarara performs in the Haiti Awareness Series.

BY MICHAEL GLUK
mglukl@swarthmore.edu

This past Friday, Swarthmore's Coalition
for a Free Haiti hosted the Haiti Awareness
Series, an all-day event with the goal of raising awareness about the current situation in
Haiti, a country that, CFFH's co-founder and
a key organizer of the event Jacqueline
Bailey-Ross 'l2 said, "has been abused by the
media and universal ignorance for so long."
Friday's series started with a screening of
the documentary "The Other Side of the
Water," continued with a CFFH-hosted
reception in Upper Tarble, and culminated
in a performance by the band Djarara.
"The Other Side of the Water" depicts the
stories of Haitian immigrants living in New
York City, with a particular focus on
Djarara, which the film's official website
calls "a group of young immigrants who take
an ancient music from the hills of Haiti and
reinvent it on the streets of Brooklyn." Rara
is a musical genre that originally fueled
Haiti's rebellion against French dominion
and continues to function as a voice of political protest. Recently, immigration trends
have brought the genre to the U.S.'s Eastern
Seaboard, particularly in the New York City
boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. The documentary follows Pe Yves, a poet and veteran leader of the Rara movement. According
to the website, '"The Other Side of the Water'
is about the struggle to merge the traditional and the modern; the island and the City;
the imagined and the real."
The screening and informational reception provided considerable context and hype
ApriU6,2oo9

-

for Djarara's subsequent performance in
Upper Tarble. The audience even led the
band into the library for a continuation of
the performance. Michelle Walters 'l2 said,
"The show was really remarkable, especially the students' involvement."
"I think the concert was a great success.
[...] At first I was a bit worried, but Martin
Warner and Dean [Tim] Sams seemed okay
with it as long as they didn't stay for long.
There were also some astonished students
looking on from their books. For some reason the library performance was very liberating," Bailey-Ross said.
It is not surprising that the performance
provoked such a reaction; Djarara's unique
blend of Caribbean-style instrumental with
more recognizable hip-hop beats made the
concert an accessible, adrenaline-surging
experience. Walters said, "Haiti was not a
country whose culture or issues I was very
aware of until now. It's nice to have that
kind of broadened perspective."
Friday's activities were not the first
awareness-raising efforts the Coalition for a
Free Haiti has hosted this year. Earlier this
semester, the group screened the documentary "The Agronomist" to a large student
turnout. Bailey-Ross said, "The Haiti
Awareness Series was conceived from the
notion that a week was not long enough."
The Coalition for a Free Haiti will continue
to host events throughout the school year
with the aim of raising awareness for
Haitian issues. If last Friday's series was
any indication, this exposure to Haitian culture will prove both fascinating and enjoyable.

and a much larger, science-based institution, our
"helpfulness" (and honesty) won her over (we
think).
But, through this experience, I was taken from a
high-stressed day to a time-out tour of the very special grounds on which I've had the opportunity to
live and grow roots these past four years. Talking
with a few visiting alums this past weekend, I asked
about their experiences being back on campus as
"non-students." One summarized the group's sentiments in saying, "I still feel very connected to this
campus. I still feel like this is "my campus' when
I'm here." This gives me new hope that I, too, can
continue my own connection even after I am no
longer a resident. And taking a walk through campus, with a trained tour guide leading the way, gave
me that fresh (although still jaded) sense of what it
feels like to experience Swarthmore for the first
time. It reminded me of why I came here and what
I've done since I've been here. I am part of this continued tradition and damn proud of it. So, I must
ask you to think once more, "If others have already
'done Swarthmore,' should we not?"

In Rome, my gelato gluttony reached

rushed to the counter while yelling at

Despite the immense crowd of 100,000

Easter Mass. I was about to turn around
and indignantly snap back that I had
been backpacking for two weeks until I
caught sight of the long trail of toothpaste streaking down my shirt. Oops.

So, this week, I am going to talk about a very
simple way to "take a break," one I hope most will

past Friday (high school spring break
our population doubles!), I bumped into a dear friend of
mine. He, in an effort to "de-stress," decided to take
a tour of campus and encouraged me to hop on

guide as she struggled to engage a very bored group
of individuals (with 50 people, it's inevitable).
Hidden behind the crowd, my friend, let's call him
Remmy, and I conspired to ask questions like, "So,
I hear crunkfest is next week. What's that?" or "I
like smoking pot, what's the school's policy on
that?" etc. Let's just say, there may or may not be an
innocent yet thoroughly shaken tour guide victim
out there. We also had fun reminiscing about our
own experiences and taking a moment to remember
"why we love Swarthmore." We even had a prospective stop us for questions. Remmy and I became her
personal guides and, in her decision between Swat

Catholic. Never one to go halfway, I
decided to do just that by attending
Easter mass with the Pope. The experience was humbling. I managed to snag a
fairly front-row view among the hundred
thousand people there, meaning I could
just make out a rather adorable little
white blob moving around near the altar.
The excitement in the air was palpable
and some lively Croatians led several
rousing if inexplicably off-beat chants of
"Viva il Popo!"
Whatever you think of Catholicism,

I thoroughly enjoyed the mass and was
pleased to find out I could understand
most of the homily the Pope delivered in
Italian thanks to the linguistic similarities to Spanish. I was unfamiliar with
most of the formal practices but my
friend Patty helpfully poked me in the
ribs every time I needed to stand up and

'American Buffalo' is Mamet at his meatiest

the Plays and Players Theater in downtown Philly. "American Buffalo" takes
place over the course of a single day in a
junkshop in 1975, where three men of low
intelligence who share an interest in
obtaining money with the least effort pos-

sible, discuss "business." Business for
these men is not simply a matter of commerce and capitalism. For Don, Teach and
Bob, business is a matter of selective loyalty, nominally controlled greed and jealousy, and a complete disregard for social
norms and morality. They're delightful.
Teach (Pete Pryor) is a volatile, crude
man with a penchant for violence and
enough strength to do some serious damage. Don Dubrow (Joe Canuso, Producing
Artistic Director of Theatre Exile), proprietor of the junkshop, is the brains of
the trio but that is. not saying much, and
he prizes business over everything else.
Bob (Robert DaPonte), the youngest of the
trio and Don's loyal helper, is the resident
innocent, if a recovering-junkie-turnedthief can be called innocent.
The business that draws these three
incompetents together is evidence of
Mamet's genius. They have not joined
together to rob a bank or to con anyone. In
fact, their criminal aspirations are so
small-time that their immorality is only
upsetting in how it affects their interactions with one another, as opposed to how
they interact with the outside world.
The fact of the matter is that these men
have no impact on the outside world; they
are out to steal nickels and they can't
even follow through with it. To be fair to
them, one should note that they are looking to steal a special nickel from a coin
collector, but splitting the booty four ways
(a finder's fee is included for an otherwise
unmentioned character) on a nickel that
cost the collector a mere ninety dollars is

12

If it had been murder or conspiracy,
Mamet would have told his audience
what sort of people these men are, but he
has never been one to answer his own
questions. Instead, it is up to the audience to sift through the character flaws
and find a way through the world of the
junkshop. To that end, Mamet gives the
gift of comedy.
Dark as they may be, the comedic
interchanges between Canuso, Pryor and
DaPonte are the perfect instruments to
win over the audience. DaPonte shifts
back and forth between a vacant expression and a plump pout, pulling off
Mamet's signature dialogue style with
ease. When he talks about that thing that
he saw with the stuff at that place (the
actual text is vaguer still), his attempt at
coded language is nothing if not endearing. Even when such veiled language
becomes the norm, Bob retains ownership
of that comedic element. DaPonte's boyish
looks, brown mop of hair, careful timing
tprovides the sympathetic end of comedy,
the unintentionally goofy element.
The counterpoint to DaPonte's Bob is
Pryor's Teach, whose comedic contributions are largely linguistic. Pryor is faith' ful to Mamet's writing and achieves a balance that other actors have failed to do in
the role. His violent meltdown is terrifying and completely fitting, but does nothing to weaken the impression he leaves
throughout the show. Pryor lives up to the
hyper-realist writing and juggles the conflicting elements of Teach's personality
adeptly, introducing the threads of insecurity and volatility immediately and
altering them throughout the course of
the two acts until they reach their natural
breaking point. His realist school of acting is suitablefor the role, more appropriate than a comedic style, despite the fact
that he is in many ways the core of the
comedic elements.
Canuso is the straight man to the two
reprobates, but his Don is no saint. He is,
in a way, the criminal mentor to Teach
and Bob, with the two continually seeking
his good favor. As the owner of the
junkshop, he helms this brief expedition
into the criminal element and acts as
enforcer of the criminal code, if there is
such a thing. Caruso is believable in this
capacity, but never entirely convincing as
a malefactor. He is at his best when Pryor
is leading the scene, freeing him up to
respond instead of to instigate action.
Also worth noting is Matt Saunders'
scenic design. The junk shop is right on
point. The cataclysmic destruction of the
shop places very particular demands on
the scenic designer, and Saunders' set
provided an abundance ofinstruments for

Pryor's symphony of rage without straying from Mamet's characteristic realism.

David Mamet likes to keep things
ambiguous. If you don't like plays that
leave you conflicted, he's not the man for
you. If, however, you like your art with a
dash of social commentary and a lot of
moxie, Mamet is the way to go. A Mamet
play will always make you think. There
are no good guys in his plays, only somewhat unsavory characters performing
potentially immoral deeds, and everything is relative. His provocative plays
draw audiences again and again, and
Swarthmore is no exception; "Glengarry
Glen Ross," and "Oleanna" have been performed here over the last three years.

touch on
the entertaining, cute Jim, flirt with
the incompetent Michael Scott, and
ultimately settle on the one, the only,
the man with the glasses and the
pocket protector:
Dwight Kurt
Schrute.
Now, you may not think of Dwight
(as played by the endlessly entertaining Rainn Wilson) as the stereotypiif looking for a phrase
cal nerd
that accurately
describes
the
Assistant to the Regional Manager,
"deranged beet-farming cat-killer"
leaps more quickly to mind than
"nerd." Dwight, however, definitely
falls into the category of nerd: his
hair is neatly parted in the middle, he
firmly believes in both vampires and
zombies, and he knows everything
there is to know about "Star Wars." If
all that doesn't scream "nerd," I really don't know what does.
Dwight, however, is not the
supreme television nerd, much as he
may wish to be. That prize can be
awarded to Sheldon Cooper (Jim
Parsons) of CBS's "The Big Bang
Theory." Sheldon is a particle physicist at an unnamed (but clearly prestigious) California university, and
his life consists of his research
(which, according to him, is about to
revolutionize the entire field), eating
specific foods on specific nights
(Thursday is pizza night, and it can
NEVER be Thai food night) and
knowing everything there is to know
about comic books and Star Trek.
Sheldon surrounds himself with the
three people in the world who can tolerate his idiosyncrasies: his roommate, Leonard (Johnny Galecki), the
cute,
semi-attractive nerd; the
paralyzed-around-women
Indian,

astronomer, Rajesh Koothrappali
(Kunal Nayyar); and the unbelievably horny, still-lives-with-his-mothengineer,

Howard
Helberg).
(Simon
Wolowitz
Koothrappali, Wolowitz and Leonard
are entertaining characters in their
own right, as is their hot blonde
neighbor Penny (Kaley Cuoco, who
plays an admirable straight woman),
but "The Big Bang Theory" belongs

to Sheldon and Sheldon alone.

Another show that, despite the
charm of its other characters, has
been hijacked by the nerds is a recent
addition to the ABC lineup, "Better
Off Ted." The show may center on the
life of Ted, Director of Research and
Development for a corporate behemoth known by the wonderfully
important-sounding yet meaningless
name of Veridian Dynamics, and feature a truly impressive supporting
cast
"Arrested
(including
sublime Portia de

geeks, Phil (Jonathan Slavin) and
Lem (Malcolm Barrett), who steal the
show. To see their sublimely loving,
geeky and extremely codependent
relationship at its best, check out
episode
"Through
three,
Rose
Colored HAZMAT Suits," in which
Phil and Lem begin the episode by
arguing about which of them is in
charge, and end it by being squeezed,
in the ultimate gesture of friendship
and love, into a single HAZMAT suit.
(On the non-nerd front, the episode
also features the best example of a
HAZMAT-suit make-out session I've
ever seen. Forget that it's the only
one I've ever seen. Just sit back and
laugh.)
By looking at Dwight, Leonard and

Phil and Lem, it's clear that nerds
can steal a show, be they cuddly (Phil
and Lem), bizarrely
eccentric
(Sheldon) or downright hostile
(Dwight. Obviously.). But why are
these characters so appealing? Do we
sympathize with their plights? Do we
see a little of ourselves in them? Or
do we just like watching shows where
we, as intellectual Swatties, can
appreciate all the scientific in-jokes
I personally think that it's a little
bit of all three. I definitely sympathize with these nerds because I, like
many Swatties, have had my identity
as the stereotypical "nerd" defined
for me in certain settings. I also
secretly sympathize with Sheldon's
frustration when people don't understand my intellectual (and, let's face
it, somewhat pretentious) references
to all sorts of obscurity. I even sympathize, on rare occasions, with

The point that I am trying to make
by sharing these embarrassing anecdotes about myself (and I promise,

Saturday night, you just finished your
paper, and you really just won't be able to
live with yourself if you go to bed at 9 p.m.
on a weekend
What to do then? I found
myself in just such a situation last weekend, and after much deliberation I came
up with a solution; it involved gin and tonics, salsa dancing, bad music and a hair
dryer, among other things.
I am devoting this edition of my column to those nights we've all experienced,
but that don't really have a name in the
those nights when you
social sphere
just can't muster up the energy to go out
into the far reaches of campus, and the socalled "spring weather" is so sorely discouraging, that you end up just getting
drunk in your room with friends and
doing ridiculous things. Or, for some of
you, just doing ridiculous things without
the drunken part, although in my experience that is not nearly as much fun.
Apparently this is common practice at
other schools, where alcohol restrictions
are actually enforced and people have to
hide in their rooms when they drink
because they are underage. But at
Swarthmore, where you can frolic around
campus with a beer in one hand and a
joint in the other with minimal chances of
negative repercussions, these nights of
mayhem behind closed doors are reserved
only for the times when you are really
bored, really lazy, or it's really just too
cold outside.
The solution to my dilemma was exactly one of those nights. I tried going to Olde
Club with friends, got bored quickly, didn't really want to put effort into anything
so I lured friends back to my room with
alcohol and decided we would make our
own fun. Such nights often end up being
the most entertaining, because the most
epic of shenanigans take place when they
are the least expected. Hilarious stories,
good memories and bad hangovers are
sure to ensue. Not just reserved for the
"dormy" types anymore, those kids who
are friends with people on their hall and
therefore never leave it, the room-party is
the new Paces dance party. At least until
all this cold rain goes away, that is.
The first step towards a successful
room party is good drinks. If the main
event of your evening is simply getting
drunk in itself, then you need to enjoy it
and must do so in style. In my case this
usually involves my favorite drink, the
gin and tonic, made with anything that's
not Banker's Club (Tanqueray is preferable). If you want to get fancy you can
make more complicated things
if you
have a blender, even better. I don't, but my
goal is to get one and throw a margarita
fiesta one day, so I will be proud from afar

of any of my readers who do so before me.
One rule: when making gin and tonics or
any other citrus-involving beverages, you
ABSOLUTELY MUST use real limes, or
real fruit of whatever type is called for.
Gin and tonics without lime are not OK.
Also important is the selection of
friends. Obviously, you can't fit everyone
you would like into one dorm room, but
lounges are gross and lack atmosphere.
Therefore, you must invite your friends
accordingly and with great care as to
which small group will balance one another out well. On Saturday I somehow ended
up being the only girl in my room for the

entire night
female friends. Generally, it's good to
invite at least one really funny person,
one person who will get drunk with you so
that you don't feel like an alcoholic, and
one calm person who will keep things
under control should they get out ofhand.
It's generally best to play loud, obnoxious music at your room party so that
your whole hall knows that you're getting
drunk. I think my hall must have really
appreciated my sing-along rendition of
"Jumper" by Third Eye Blind. Anything
that is ironically retro is good, like bad
'Bos music, which may seem cliche but
will never, ever get old in my mind. If
you've accumulated enough people, spon
taneous dance parties are good, too
who
needs an Ibiza-themed Paces party when
you can turn your own bedroom into a
euro-trash dance club? If you're too lazy to
make a play list, just put a Girl Talk
album on shuffle. Girl Talk is also always
appropriate, for any place in any situation
at any time. When in doubt, play Gir
Talk.
Once the scene is set, it's up to you to
decide where your night will lead, but
with good drinks, friends and funny
music, it's hard to go wrong. However
beware of ridiculous behavior that gets
out of hand; my night involved me periodically making loud squawking noises that
apparently sounded like the baby
dinosaurfrom "Jurassic Park." Being safe
is always important too, because drinking
in comfortable conditions with large
amounts of alcohol available can often go
farther than you intend it to. This is a
message from your columnist: please
drink responsibly. It's best to time at least
10 minutes between shots, and use a
buddy system
if none of your friends
want to have one more drink with you,
you probably don't need one. Also, never
listen to me for advice on how to limit

in
me, despite

the
fact
that locals
in the place I call home will always
instantly identify me as an outsider.
To them I am a laowai, which means I
am a foreigner; in this diverse country
people may be slower to label, but after
living in this country for the single
longest period of time in my life I can
pretty safely say I am a foreigner here
too.

When I was in elementary school at
the International School of Beijing, I
had to do one of those individual projects that required us to put everything
"about you" on one A 4 sheet of colored
paper. To represent my place of origin,
I put the good old Star-Spangled
Banner because I thought of myself as
an American. Also, it was cool to be
allied with the country that could
bomb its way out of its problems.
When I had to do a similar assignment in middle school, however, I put
a different red, white and blue flag up
the Taiwanese flag. It's the one you
won't see at the Olympics because they
(or we?) aren't allowed to use it according to various international accords,
each with Communist China's fingerprints smeared all over them. It's also
the one you won't see on my middle
school project because our school's
security guards made the Taiwaneseidentifying students take off our paper
cutout of Taiwan's flag.
I'm not entirely sure where my little project is now, but if I found it
again, I know that in place of the
Taiwanese flag there will be a United
Nations flag instead.
Fortunately, they didn't ask us to do
another one of those in high school,
but I think by then I would have put
the red and yellow of the People's
Republic of China on my A 4 paper.
And now? I have no idea what I
would put now. Maybe those security
guards had it right when they ripped
off the Taiwanese flags and told us to
replace them with United Nations
flags. Not because I identify with that
hapless joke of an organization, but
because I am sure the feeling of displacement I often have is characteristic of many of my fellow international
students.
I have no loyalties, or perhaps I
have too many. In conversation I will
readily go from defending the Chinese
Communist Party to condemning them
for slights they have committed
against the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
which is the party
party of Taiwan
my family belongs to, and the party my
family fought for in the Chinese Civil
War. Which was, yes, between the
Communists and the KMT.

THE PHOENIX

That brings up a piece of family history that has monopolized my attention recently. In several universities'
libraries (sadly, not in any of the TriCo libraries) you will find books on the
Chinese Civil War focused on a KMT
general/secret service chief named
Mao Renfeng. Many of these books
have been written 'in the last two
decades and originate from the mainland. Many of them call Mao Renfeng a
murderer; one title translates to "Mao
Renfeng: China's most brutal killing
machine."
Mao Renfeng is, as you may have
guessed, my grandfather, and I recall
the silent anger my father displayed
when he first read that last title. It is
an anger I share as well, because these
books, about a man who died 52 years
ago, are, by and large, products of the
winning side's point of view
the
P.R.C.'s point of view. Naturally, I feel
defensive about this subject, and
nobody is even pressing me on it.
When I discovered that there is a
television series called "Mao Renfeng
gives out the order to kill" and shared
it with my mother, all she had to say
was, "There are always different views
to a matter."
There are always different views to
a matter
those words essentially
encapsulate how I feel about my
national identity and my family history alike. How do I reconcile the fact
that my entire family is KMT and yet I
am often willing to excuse the
Communist party, the one that libels
my grandfather so? There are always
different views to a matter.
How do I exist as an American who
feels foreign in America and who, at
different points in time, put different
flags on those A 4 pieces of paper to
identify myself? There are always different views to a matter.
Maybe it isn't even necessary to
reconcile or resolve or attempt to unite
the different views of the matter. I am
willing to see the different views all at
once.
I am perhaps so separate from Mao
Renfeng that I can embrace a lot of
what he fought against, but I believe
family history is too much a part of
admittedly, often an unrecognized or
unwillingly recognized part of each of
us
that it is impossible for me to distance myself completely from him
either.
My story is in no way representative of an international student's story.
It's not even representative of an expat's story. But this column is called
Over International Borders, and thus
far, I have failed to elucidate the possible internal discord of anybody who
shares elements of my story, be it the
smallest of similarities.
Obviously, there isn't any crystal
elucidation. And that, I think, makes
the attempt to resolve and revisit
much more gratifying. Because every
time we look back at where we have
come from, we find new elements that
those who haven't experienced life
quite as an international kid could
never discover. Ultimately, it adds
another piece to a puzzle that never
needs to be completed.

Student Council Platforms

swarthmorephoenix.com

MEET the candidates

Below are the platforms for the spring 2009
Student Council elections. The open positions
are: president, educational policy representative, financial policy representative, campus life
representative and student groups advisor.

Voting will take place Saturday, April 18
through Thusday April 23.

For educational policy representative:
Esther Burson 'lO
My name is Esther Burson, and I'd like
to serve as your Educational Policy
Representative. I gained experience in
educational policy when I served as the
student representative to the Council on
Educational Policy last semester. As the
only student representative to a committee of faculty members, I got comfortable
speaking out about student opinion. This
experience will allow me to make sure
that students' voices are heard.
My main goals for educational policy
reforms here at Swarthmore are to get an
updated course recommendation guide working online, and to make
sure that the online and paper course catalogues include blurbs for all
classes offered and do not continue to list courses that are no longer
offered. I believe that these changes will help us get the information we
want when picking classes each semester.
I will open a discussion on the possibility of expanding interdisciplinary minors, such as Environmental Studies, Cognitive Science and
Peace and Conflict Studies, into official majors, so that it is easier for
students to major in these fields, and majors will have more departmental support.
I would also like to talk about removing restrictions on how many
majors and minors students can pursue. Right now Swarthmore limits
students to one major and up to two minors, or two majors and no
minors. Everyone has different interests, and I feel that if a student
wants to have two majors and a minor, or one major and three minors,
he should be allowed to do so. I would also like to find ways to improve
first-year and transfer advising, so that every student gets the support
she needs from the beginning.
Most importantly, I want to make sure that student opinion is fully
represented. My priority is to share student opinion, so I will approach
the position of Educational Policy Representative with an open mind. I
want to know what you think so that I can bring your opinions to the
faculty. I find that we often assume that issues of educational policy are
out of our control. I want to prove that this isn't true. Ifenough students
speak up about how to improve W course or PE requirements, we can
effect positive change.
In my time on the CEP, I was discouraged by the structure of meetings. I felt that, as a student, my role was to answer very specific questions of administrators and faculty members, rather than to share the
student perspective more broadly. If elected Educational Policy
Representative, I will talk to students and create a list of our concerns
and ideas before every faculty meeting. I will then work with the CEP
to find a time to share the students' agenda at each CEP meeting. I feel
that, in this way, I can make our voices heard, and best serve your
interests.
What I want to do for educational policy matters more than who I
am, but, in case you're curious, I'm a rising senior double major in psychology and classical languages. I'm abroad this semester, so you may
not remember me, but let's just say that I'm doing research for the posiI want to be able to relate to a wide range of academic experition

For campus life representative:
Marie Rousseau 'l2

Yellow dear Students ov Swarthmore!
My name iz Marie Rousseau I am interested in being ze Campus Life
Representative. Actually, for those of you who don't know me, I am
French, but I do not actually sport zis French accent. Oops, I did it
again! I also don't usually make Britney Spears song references.
Now for the serious part. When I came onto this campus, an innocent
freshman newly imported to the land of the free, I quickly realized that
I could never have found a campus life as rewarding in France or
England. I am, therefore, extra enthusiastic about maintaining and
ameliorating campus life at Swarthmore. As an eager event attendee, I
have been able to observe the Swarthmore student body both outside
and inside of its natural element; therefore, I feel that I would be able to
interpret student needs. I also enjoy meeting new people, Swarthmore
being more diverse than my high school, and I would be interested in cooperating with students from
all backgrounds in order to meet their expectations.
As a French tutor, I have discovered I enjoy listening to and helping solve people's problems,
which I feel is an essential part of the role of Campus Life Representative. I have also helped advertise numerous events, both as an i2O International Club member and the Public Relations Officer of
Peace Week. Therefore, I think you should consider electing me, a true blood Frenchie, as Campus
Life Representative (especially since I'll never get a shot at being President of the United States)!

For financial policy representative:
Richard Brode 'll
It is no surprise that Swarthmore's endowment has seen a massive
decline over the past year. The college has since been pressed to scrutinize its expenses and curtail new spending.
If elected Financial Policy Representative, my first priorities will be
to ensure that student groups continue to receive the funding they
deserve and that new student spending initiatives will continue to be
entertained by the CoUege Budget Committee. We are in the midst of an
economic crisis, but our quality of life should not suffer as a result.
I will also add to and improve upon the resources which students
may use to find jobs and internships. The job market is bleak. Our college must be doing all it can to ensure its students are happily and gainfully employed by graduation. As a Career Peer Advisor within the college's Career Services Office, I have been privy to many students' questions and concerns regarding future employment. I will bring this unique insight to the Student
Council. For example, many students claim there is an inadequate listing of potential jobs. To remedy this problem, I wish to devote more effort and resources towards attracting a greater number of
recruiters, take advantage of the recruiters visiting other elite colleges and universities, bring guest
speakers to campus that would be interested in hiring Swarthmore students, and create more opportunities to connect with alumni.
Finally, I will maintain the transparency of the college's spending and investment practices, as
well as express student concerns at every CBC meeting. As a member of the Student Council, my general intent will be to act as a voice for the entire student body. Please, vote Richard Brode for
Financial Policy Representative.

For student groups advisor:
Benjamin Francis 'l2

Student groups make Swarthmore what it is. You'll find the bad food and
the awkwardness at other colleges. What you won't find is a student body
devoted to such a wide range of causes. On my campus tours, I make a point
of saying that I've learned as much from listening to fellow Swatties as I have
from listening to my professors. Student groups foster this kind of participation by providing a forum for like-minded people to come together, as well as
a space for newcomers to be introduced to the field. As Student Groups
Advisor I would:
L Keep groups informed. SBC is fantastic, but sometimes funds can get
tight. I will keep groups informed about nontraditional methods of funding,
such as Forum for Free Speech and various discretionary funds, and help
them through the application processes. As a voting member of SBC, I will
extend a standing offer to review all SBC proposals before they are actually
proposed. In addition, I will maintain close contact with group leaders about relevant networking opportunities. I will keep them informed as to what events similar groups are planning, and whether or not there
is room for them to get involved.
2. Update the StudentActivities Website. Sometimes just finding the group you're looking for can be frustrating. On the website, I will include contact information for all participating groups, add new groups to
the list, and remove defunct groups from the list.
3. Seek out group input. Every group has unique concerns. Some of these for example, that one group
requires equal access to school resources as academic departments, or that another needs extra funding
you cannot know without asking. I will contact group leaders regularly, listen to their
for advertising
concerns, and help them decide on a course of action accordingly.
If elected, I will work tirelessly to fulfill these aims and more. Thanks so much for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Benjamin Francis

This past semester, you elected me to

on the current Student Council. I know
how the Council works, so I will not
waste your time climbing up the learning

administration.
I realize that the constraints many
Swatties face prevent themfrom actively
engaging Student Council. Sure, we need
to be more open, but that is not sufficient
for a substantively good Student Council.
I therefore seek to actively engage the
student body: help me set the agenda. I
will hold an open forum (with food!) at
the beginning of each semester to find
out what students want changed or maintained. I will audit the occasional meeting or practice for all student groups. I

and I would like to utilize these traits to
better acquaint Council with students.
Do not feel bad about pestering me; I like
it, and I am running for that very reason.
After all, if elected, I will be hired to
serve you. Students should demand nothing less than absolute dedication out of
their President, and I promise to provide
that.
I do not think making a list of promises to improve day-to-day life is productive, for we all know what can make
daily life at Swarthmore better. I doubt
the other candidates and I differ on these
issues. We do differ with regards to experience, and I know what Student Council
can do. The interesting thing about
Student Council that I learned this past
semester is that the majority of its power
is "soft," so to speak, or indirect. Sending
an e-mail with a suggestion to Dining
Services or the Deans' Office means a lot
more when it comes from Student
Council.
The amount of change we can make is
directly related to the amount of effort
the Student Council President puts in.

to Student Council, and I will not be an
overstretched candidate. To make day-today improvements, I will hold agendasetting forums at the beginning of the

campus.

I understand that inclusion issues and

feelings of exclusion plague many student organizations. My solution is to
include these groups in Council's significant meetings with the real folks in
charge, from the administration to the
Board of Managers. The Board of
Managers meets several times throughout the school year, and often gets the
final say in many important college decisions. I will not only invite representatives of these groups to the more open
luncheon, but I will also ask these groups
to prep me on their concerns before I sit
in on the closed-door meetings.
Many students do not know how to
fully utilize the college's resources, or
where to go when trying to start a group
or to find funding. I propose a more inter-

active online handbook of sorts, which
will tell people "Where do you go if you
need x, y and z." I think having an overall awareness-promoting campaign can
help too, and I do not just mean printing
a newsletter. For example, we all read the
postings in the bathroom about what is
new at McCabe, and I will do similar
advertising for Student Council. This
will both inform students of what
Council is doing (making it relevant) and
hopefully educate students on how they
can maneuver within the bureaucracy. I
would like to work with The Phoenix and
tThe Daily Gazette on having an "Ask
StuCo President" column, a "Dear Abby"
program of sorts.
Another thing few students know
about Student Council is that it works
much better and is much more active
when its members enjoy going to meetings. Dreading the Sunday meeting (7
p.m., Parrish Parlors
come!) does not
generate active participation during the
meeting. I think leadership style has a lot
to do with this, and I have the right leadership style. I am efficient, bubbly, openminded, and do not take myself too seriously.

This coming year is unique for two
reasons. First, we will welcome a new
president, Dr. Chopp. I will start from the
ground running with Dr. Chopp, and
truly introduce her to the students. I
want to shape her daily routine at
Swarthmore from the beginning, so that
she is not some distant administrator. A
new president is a very exciting opportunity for all of us. Second, the inevitable
budget cuts will occur. I promise to maintain dialogue with the Deans and
Suzanne Welsh about what cuts will be
made, and I will discourage them from
cutting vital student programs and
events. One thing I hope to increase (or
maintain, at the very least) is the student
employment level. I know that many students rely on finding work on campus
and need that paycheck. I will make sure
student jobs are not slashed without serious consideration, and will explore ways
to increase student employment opportunities.
Students lose faith and interest in
Student Council when they believe it is
irrelevant and ineffective. Things should
not be this way and I will make sure they
are not. There is too much at stake and,
quite frankly, too much money at our fingertips.

Thank you for your time and please
vote for Rachel Bell 'lO.

the
office of
Student

■■■■■■■■HSCouncil

President. We face an environment
that promises to pose a number of
challenges in the near future.
Primarily, the Swarthmore community faces a dismal economy and
must attempt to insulate the student body as well as the faculty
from its effects.
While considering whether or
not to make a bid for president, I
reflected on the following personal
qualities, which I am convinced are
necessary to the office of Student
Council President.
First, the new president must not
be afraid to innovate and find new
ways to accomplish old goals. The
new president must not be afraid to
reach out, to listen not only to those
who take the initiative to speak up,
but to solicit ideas from those less
heard from. The new president
must represent the interests of all
groups on campus, and, as liaison to
the Board of Managers, must see to
it that IC/BCC groups have the
access and information that they
need.
Second, the new president must
not make changes for the sake of
change. Our Student Council has
accomplished much recently, ranging from the extension of library
hours last year to the improved
menu at Sharpies very recently. The
trajectory is mostly good, and the
next president should be a faithful
steward of those measures that
work while keeping an eye toward
further progress.
Third, the new president must
work closely with the new College
President and Public Safety to
attend to the security threats that
face the College annually. Just this
year, golf carts have been vandalized, valuables have been stolen
from our dorms and libraries, and
students do not always feel as safe
as they should at parties or walking
alone at night. The new president
should work with the new administration to improve lighting in a
number of problem areas on campus.
Finally and most importantly, it
seems to me that the new president
must have unsurpassed dedication
to the position. The post of Student
Council President must not play
second fiddle to any other club or
initiative that the president may
otherwise have held in high import.
These are not times that allow
for mistakes, and to prevent them, a
president must be always vigilant
and willing to research, learn and
deliberate.
When I considered whether or
not to run, I evaluated whether or
not I could measure up to these
expectations. I am convinced that I
can. I must now convince you.

April 16,2009

First, I have already started
progress towards my goal to hear
ideas from all corners of campus. I
have met with members of many
groups to have conversations about
the situations facing them. These
meetings have been wonderful in
understanding Swarthmore in a
fuller understanding of the needs of
the Swarthmore community. As
president, I would continue to have
personal meetings with members of
every group on campus such that I
could better understand the initiatives and goals of our creative
group of individuals. Furthermore,
I would ensure that each and every
campus leader would have my personal cell phone number in case
they might want to talk or have an
impromptu conversation.
This would allow for a level of
openness and connection between
Student Council and the student
body that Student Council has been
working toward over many cycles.
Second, I will take steps to bolster relations between campus
groups and Student Council. I will
work to ensure that council continues to include the opinions of all
communities on campus, making
sure that students of color, LGBTQ
students, NOTA students, and students of political and ideological
minorities are well represented.
Events held by groups on campus
should be attended by at least one
member of Student Council, and I
will push for that to happen.
I will look to make Student
Council a resource for students who
have great ideas but do not know
where to find the funding to make
them a reality. There is funding all
over campus earmarked for various
types of events and activities, but
understanding the bureaucracy can
be intimidating at times. Student
Council should become the bridge
between idea and reality.
Third, I have investigated the
areas on campus that appear to be
especially poorly lit. With a map of
said problem areas, I would like to
bring together Public Safety, the
administration, and SMART counselors, amongst others, to find ways
to make the campus safer. Along
these lines, I want to hold a meeting
with the current residents of
Woolman, Kyle, PPR and Mary
Lyon in particular to assess the
experiences of those students' travels and to determine what, if any,
steps must be taken to ensure that
all students on campus feel safe.
Finally, I will make the office of
Student Council President and the
job of representing your interests
and concerns to the administration
my sole focus for my senior year.
Certainly,
the push
of the
Swarthmore academic semester is
not to be underestimated, but my
energies will be focused on finding
ways for our campus to remain the
best in the nation.
By establishing a fruitful working relationship with President
Chopp and the Board of Managers,
by reaching out to students of every
community, and by building upon
the good work of the present council, I hope to become the president
that you deserve.

Realizing the potential for
focused student activism

Last week's article in the sport's section on the men's

Questioning the role of The Phoenix
To the Editor:
I was extremely disappointed, upon opening this week's issue of
The Phoenix, to find Alex Rolle's story "Student issued citation after
Genderfuck." While the piece is dynamic and well-written, and Mr.
Rolle is undoubtedly a talented reporter, I question the reasoning
behind pursuing (much less publishing) this story in the first place.
Whether or not The Phoenix chooses to print stories with all the
tawdry details, it's a reasonably well-known fact that alcohol citations are regularly issued to Swarthmore students. So, what makes
this particular incident different? Arguably, the dispute over the
exact story of the event has echoes of homophobia (or at least "partying-college-student-in-a-dress"-phobia) on the part of the Borough
police department. But since when is it the duty of The Phoenix to
publish speculation about details that, to everyone other than the
parties immediately involved, will never truly be known? Moreover,
why should The Phoenix become a mouthpiece for a legal dispute
between a student and the Borough police that, ostensibly, involves
no one but those two parties?
As I see it, the fundamental issue to be addressed here is: whatrole
is The Phoenix supposed to fill on campus? Is it a reliable source for
campus news, commentary, opinions and features, or a sounding
board for gossipy students looking for new dinner conversation? As
an ex-editor, I'd like to believe the former. But this particular story
has left me wondering whether we've gone in the wrong direction.
Journalism at Swarthmore has always aspired to a higher standard than, say, posts on The Daily Jolt (back in its heyday, at least). I
only hope that The Phoenix will continue to set its sights that high,
and away from entertaining but ultimately irrelevant stories such as
this one.

Title IX a small segment of sports sexism stigma
swarthmorephoenix.com

It was one of those PR
disasters that someone
really should have seen
coming. The President of
the United States was
going on national television to showcase his populist appeal by sharing his
bracket
for
March
Madness 2009, but oops
he forgot about the women.
When President Obama
appeared on ESPN and
Hannah Purkey
picked a NCAA playoff
The Purkey Perspective
bracket for men's basketball and not women's, it
was not a surprise that
someone stepped up to point out the faux pas.
Among those who did was USA Today columnist
Christine Brennan, who criticized the President for what
she felt was a slight to women's athletics.
While this was expected, what wasn't expected was
the torrent of negative comments about Ms. Brennan on
several blogs because of her complaint. On one of these
blogs, a political commentary called "the vote blog" written by Jimmy Orr and Dave Cook, posters under the
guise of anonymity ripped into not only Ms. Brennan but
also women's basketball in general.
Of the many, mostly male, posters, one identified only
as David wrote, "I am so tired of 'special interests' getting
all over others, in this case President Obama, for not
being politically correct. Get over yourselves. I hope the
day never comes that these Title 9ers are going to force
me to watch these mind-numbing games for the sake of
being 'PC'!" Comments like these were the true story
behind this incident and encapsulate how insecure
women's sports still are in this country.
The fact that there is a women's tournament at all to
choose a bracket for is, in part, thanks to Title IX. But
...

unlike what David suggests, supporters of this law are
not trying to force those who don't want to watch
women's sports to do so. In fact, when it was enacted in
1972 as part of the Education Amendment of 1972, Title IX
was not even targeting sports at all but instead education
programs in general.
The law reads: "No person in the United States shall,
on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance." Perhaps unintentionally,
included in these education programs were athletics.
This small piece of legislation has drastically impacted women's sports and is responsible for an increase in
the number of women's sports teams per school from 2.5
in 1970 to 8.45 in 2006, according to a longitudinal study
of women in intercollegiate sport performed by Brooklyn
College. This and other amazing accomplishments of
Title IX were celebrated last week in Swarthmore's first
annual women in sport symposium.
I applaud the tremendous amount of work of the
organizers to make this symposium possible and the
highly qualified panel of female sports professionals
assembled to speak about the history of women in athletics as well as the keynote speaker, longtime Title IX
activist Jen Shillingford, .
However, I must admit, I was slightly disappointed
about what was discussed at the event. Or more accurately, I was disappointed about what was not discussed.
Assembled in the lecture hall was a group of highly
intelligent and politically active female college athletes
who experience firsthand the benefits of Title IX. Yet the
discussion rarely approached topics outside of what Title
IX was and why it is an important law to protect.
However, it is not the law but the strides toward equality we have made because of the law that need to be protected. The law itself is flawed and was never meant to be
able to account for the infinite complexities of collegiate
athletics.

Because of the law's lack of specification for sports,
both men and women involved in athletics have found
areas to critique, one of these being that the law actually
hurts some men's sports.
Ms. Shillingford addressed this belief with a handout
from the National Women's Law Center that explains
that it is not Title IX that forces schools to cut men's programs, but school administrations that would rather
eliminate what are considered "minor" men's sports, like
wrestling and gymnastics, than to cut back on the high
budgets for men's sports like basketball or football.
While this is true, these so called "minor" men's sports
are still being negatively affected or cut altogether and
Title IX is not able to prevent this from happening.
Women should know better than any other group
what it is like to be forced out of athletics by popular
men's sports since we have spent the last 40 years fighting our way back from the exact position that these
"minor" men's sports are in now. Thus, women's athletic
programs should be the best allies for these sports teams,
not the scapegoat for their lack of funding.
Although there are still big strides that need to be
made to achieve true gender equality in sports, we need
to recognize that other inequalities deserve to be
addressed as well.
The discussion needs to change from simply talking
about how we can protect Title IX to talking about how
we can work toward our goals in conjunction with men's
sports and whether Title IX is the right law to accomplish
the complex task of creating equality in athletics. It is
clear from the blog comments discussed above that
women's sports are not secure enough to survive without
legislative protection.
However, we cannot fall into complacency with Title
we must continue to search for a law that can proIX
tect women and men's rights to participate in the'sports
of their choosing.

Allentown, the Garnet women's lacrosse
team fell to Muhlenberg by a score of 137. It wasn't just the inclement weather
that was cold, with temperatures in the
40s
so was Swarthmore's first-half
play. A flurry of Muhlenberg goals
buried Swarthmore in a first half deficit
that they could not overcome. For the
second straight league game, and three
out of their last four, Swarthmore was
down by at least seven goals at halftime.
Muhlenberg scored the game's first three
goals, and went on a six-goal run to end
the first half, putting them up by nine,
and putting the game out ofreach.
The Muhlenberg game, much like
Swarthmore's last conference game
against Ursinus, was a tale of two halves.
The Centennial Conference's third leading goal scorer Amy Vachal 'll scored
the first goal of the second half, her 43rd
of the season at the 25-minute mark.
Anna de Regt 'O9 followed suit just four
minutes later with her 20th goal.
Marie Mutryn's 'l2 24th put-away,
sandwiched between goals by Emily
Evans 'll, capped a 5-0 run that brought
the Garnet within four goals with just
over 11 minutes to play. However, that
was as close as the contest would get.

2 this past Saturday against the Mules, 81 against Ursinus, and 9-0 against #5
Franklin and Marshall. "I'm challenging
them to play a full sixty minutes," said
coach Karen Borbee. "We haven't done
that yet this season."

At the half against Muhlenberg (5-2
CC), Borbee reminded her team that they
have come back before. Against Ursinus,
despite a 8-1 first half deficit, the Garnet
cut the lead to 1 with 1:15 to play before
eventually losing 10-9. She continued,
"We knew we could score enough goals
to make up the difference. We were
knocking at the door, and we got off a lot
of shots."
Just like their last game, though, second half heroics were not enough to pull
out a win at Muhlenberg's Scotty Wood
Stadium.
"We definitely worked more as a team
in the second half," Evans said.
However, Borbee added, "We put ourselves in a situation where We don't play
our best for a period of time, where we
have a lapse."
Swarthmore's improved second half
play shows their ability to compete, but
without a full 60-minute effort, it is tough
to win in the very competitive
Centennial Conference.
Despite being unable to spoil

score of 10-7. With Ally Grein 'lO, the
team's only goalkeeper, sidelined with
an injury, the Garnet sent midfielder
Jean Dahlquist 'll to the goal for her first
career appearance in front of the net.
Despite Dahlquist's seven saves,
Haverford got the best of Swarthmore on
the strength of a defense that kept
Garnet leading scorers Vachal and
Evans scoreless on the day. Four tallies
from De Regt, including three in the second half, were not enough to vault the

Garnet ahead of their Tri-Co opponents.
For the remaining four games (two
conference games and two out-of-conference games), Coach Borbee has issued a
challenge to her players: to put a whole
sixty minutes together every game. "If
they do," she says, "I think they will be
very happy with theresults."
The women will return to Clothier
Field on Thursday, when they will host
the Shorewomen of Washington College
(1-6 CC) at 7 p.m.

Archibald comes up big in baseball's first CC win
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore baseball clung to an early lead last
Thursday to eke out its first Centennial Conference
win of the season.
The Garnet (9-18, 1-9 CC) scored six runs through
the first three innings against Washington (9-12, 3-6
CC), but the Shoremen made it interesting in the bottom of the ninth inning, rallying for four runs to
close the deficit to one run. Swarthmore managed to
strike out the last batter, however, and won the game
9-8.
"We played a complete game from the first pitch
to the last," head coach Stan Exeter said, explaining
the key to the win.
Indeed, Garnet batters pounced on the opposing
pitchers early. Mike Waterhouse 'l2 led off the game
with a walk and advanced to second when Wiley
Archibald 'lO was hit by a pitch. A single through the
right side of the infield hit by Matt Lamb 'l2 scored

Waterhouse.

Run production continued in the second inning
when Archibald knocked his first collegiate home
run over the wall with Miles Santo 'l2 and
Waterhouse on base.
The three-run jack put Swarthmore ahead 4-0, and

the Garnet added to the lead in the third when Conor
Casey 'O9 singled to right field, scoring Ben
Schneiderman 'IL
In the next at-bat, Casey crossed the plate after the
Washington leftfielder misfielded a single hit by
Santo.

Innings
three-through-six
belonged
to
Washington, however, as the Shoremen put four runs
on the board, while allowing none.
Through the first three innings, Garnet starter
Kyle Crawford 'l2 held the Shoremen to one hit, but
in the fourth, a solo home run jumpstarted
Washington's bats.
In the next inning, with two runs already scored,
Crawford was in a jam: a hit batsman left the bases
loaded with only one out. The next batter hit a
ground ball right back to him, however, and he
turned the exceedingly rare one-two-three double
play (pitcher to catcher to first baseman) to end the
inning.

After the turbulent inning, Exeter relieved
Crawford, who struck out four batters while only
allowing three runs in five innings.
The Shoremen scored another run in the sixth to
cut the deficit to 6-4, but the Garnet broke it open

again in the eighth with three runs.
Taking a five-run lead into the ninth, Swarthmore
seemed ready to coast to its first conference win, but
Washington did not want to lose to the Garnet at
home for the first time since 2004.
With two runs already scored and two men on
base, Exeter called on Neil Mejia 11 for the last out.
Washington's next batter hit a double that struck the
left field wall about halfway up, driving home the
two on base to bring the score to 9-8. Mejia
regrouped, however, and recorded the save when he
struck out the next batter to end the game.
"We've known we could beat a lot of teams and we
had a greater confidence going into this game in particular," Casey said. "We had good things going for
us that game and we got key contributions from a lot
of different people."
Rain postponed Saturday's doubleheader, so the
Garnet's had some time off before playing at
Haverford (15-10-1, 9-3 CC) on Tuesday.
Swarthmore scored four runs in the top of the
first inning including a Spencer Ross 'l2 three-run

homer, but the Fords' bats were even hotter.
After responding with five of their own runs in
the bottom of the first, the Fords went on to score 28
in the game, one shy of the team record. The final
score was 28-7.
Exeter explained the source of Haverford's hitting
success. "We weren't around the strike zone consistently enough," he said. "It only takes one swing to
score multiple runs combined with walks."
On the day, the Fords had six of those big swings
Garnet pitchers allowed six home runs. "After
they get a big lead in the game, it's much easier to
swing," Exeter added.
Multiple rainouts have left the Garnet with an

increasingly busy schedule ahead. Starting today,
the team has a four-day stretch that will see them
play six games, including back-to-back doublehead-

The Garnet will next play on Clothier Field

Wiley Archibald's home run against Washington helped vault
Swarthmore to its first conference win on Thursday.
