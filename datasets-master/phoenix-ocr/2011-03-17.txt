Based on results from the surveys distributed at bag lunches on Wednesday and Thursday, StuCo will be determining whether the
grab-and-go bag lunch program needs any improvements.

BY ELI SIEGEL
esiegel2@swarthmore.edu

This Wednesday and Thursday
Student Council conducted a student
survey in Tarble regarding possible bag
lunch improvements. Based on the pending results of this survey, StuCo plans to
work with Dining Services in order to
implement changes in the program. This
survey has come as a result of discussion
generated by student complaints to
Student Council that both the variety
and availability of grab-and-go bag
lunches could be enhanced.
"We decided to run the survey
based off of several repeated concerns
we'd heard from students about bag
lunches." Elizabeth Bryant 'l3, Campus
Life Representative, said. "We just wanted to make sure that before moving forward with any sort of adjustments, they
were legitimately backed by the opinions
of those that take bag lunches."
The bag lunch program, created nearly 10 years ago, was devised by Dining
Services as a quick option for students
who do not have time to wait in the long
lunch lines at Sharpies between classes
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
"My team decided to start this program because we realized it was very difficult for students to get lunch in a timely fashion because of the class schedule.
Over the years it grew into a five-day-aweek program because class schedules
changed and the need grew," Dining
Services Director Linda McDougall said.
Each bag lunch includes an entree
sandwich or salad, a beverage, a snack
item, fresh fruit and a dessert that students can easily take with them to their
...

next appointment.
Many students find it to be a desirable

option. "I prefer not to eat in Sharpies for
lunch," Naomi Liang 'l2 said. "I get bag
lunches mostly for the convenience."
Currently, bag lunches are available
starting at noon on weekdays. However,
some students feel that the hours of the
program should be expanded to make
bag lunch available before the 11:30
classes on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays.

"I get bag lunch every Tuesday and
Thursday," Kieran Reichert 'l3 said.
"But I think bag lunches could be better
if they were offered earlier in the day on
Mondays and Wednesdays."
In addition, other students would like
more selections to be available for the
entree. Among the current offerings are
turkey, chicken salad and chicken caesar
sandwiches. Peanut noodles, hummus

wraps, and peanut butter and jelly sand-

wiches are offered as vegetarian options.
However, not all of these entrees are
available every day of the week.
In particular, the Tuesday and
Thursday vegan options are both varia-

tions of the hummus and pepper sandwich. One is on pita bread and the other
is on a hoagie roll. "There have been
some [student] concerns about Tuesday
and Thursday [vegan] bag lunches both
being hummus," Simon Zhu 'IL Student
Council President, said.
This problem has led some students to
suggest that each entree option should be
available every weekday.
"I think there could be more variety
[of entree options] for bag lunch,"
Stephanie Lechich 'l4 said. "It would be
better to have the same meals on different days instead of having a rotating
schedule [of entree options]."
"I just don't find any of the sandwich
options desirable," another student, who

March 17,2011

wished to remain anonymous, said. "It
would be nice if they had a hot entree
option, like the Phoenix [served at
Sharpies] and the spicy chicken sandwiches at Essie Mae's."
The survey conducted by StuCo consisted of three questions discussing the
current vegan and vegetarian options,
the similarity of the Tuesday and
Thursday selections and possible additions to the menu. In addition, there was
a comment box in which students could
tell StiiCo what they personally think
could be improved.
Now that the survey is completed,
StuCo will meet with Dining Services to
discuss the results and any possible
changes. In order for changes to occur,
Dining Services has stated that concrete
results must demonstrate that there is a
general consensus within the student
body. "I look forward to seeing the
results of the survey," McDougall said.
"I am not sure [of possible changes]. I
will need to evaluate the responses and
the amount of interest in change."
StuCo hopes to work with Dining
Services to find a solution that is beneficial to both the student body and the dining staff.
"Student Council is continually supportive of Dining Services and the rest of
the College staff and all the hard work
they contribute to the community," said
Zhu. "[StuCo] understands and appreciates the hard work that already goes into
preparing the bag lunches, but we also
hope to better understand our students'
concerns and preferences so as to communicate them to Dining Services."
Any possible changes in the bag lunch
program would be set into motion at the
end of the current semester or during the
beginning of the next academic year.

Last

Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) activists spoke about their experiences with the Civil Rights
Movement. Rutha Mae Harris, Penny
Patch, Judy Richardson and Bernice
Johnson Reagon also discussed their
new book, "Hands on the Freedom
Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in
SNCC," which teUs the stories of 52
women working for SNCC. Around 70
students, faculty and members of the
Swarthmore community attended the
event, which took place in Scheuer
Room. The panel was sponsored by the
Black Cultural Center, the Dean's
Office, the Gender Education Office,
McCabe Library, Forum for Free
Speech, Fun Fund, the black studies
program and departments of political
science, sociology and anthropology
and history.
Founded by students from Shaw
University in Raleigh,
Carolina,
SNCC was a principal organization of
the American Civil Rights Movement.
Active in sit-ins and freedom rides,
SNCC organized numerous voter registration drives all over the South, and
demonstrated that every citizen
could
white, black, young, or old
make a difference in the movement.
Arrested three times for participating in movement marches and demonstrations in Albany, Georgia, Rutha
Mae Harris still sings with SNCC
Freedom Singers, and organized an
adult Freedom Choir that performs at
the Albany Civil Rights Museum. She
also worked as a school teacher and
coach, and recorded herfirst CD in 2004,
entitled "I'm on the Battlefield".
During the panel, Harris emphasized
the role music played in her personal
development and in the civil rights
movement. Singing to raise funds for
SNCC, she came to realize the power of
music to call people to action and mobilize people to a goal. "Musical messages
turned [a crowd] into a community,"
Harris said. "[lt] stated we are here and
we endure."
Initially a Swarthmore student,
Penny Patch left following herfirst year
to join the Black Freedom Movement,
working with SNCC from 1962 to 1965 in
Georgia and Mississippi and assisting
with community voter registration and
election campaign.
Patch credits her childhood visit to
the Dachau concentration camp outside
Munich, Germany, as the source of her
inspiration in getting involved in the
civil rights movement despite her
white, upper-middle class background.
"My 1952 visit to Dachau terrified and
shocked me," she said. "Information
about the Holocaust was too much for a
nine, 10 or 11 year-old to handle." At the
time, she was left believing the
Germans who let her in their country
either supported the Holocaust or passively let it happen.
She continued by elaborating upon
her experiences in the American South,
including being accosted while working
at a polling booth. "I was poll watching
with a group of young black women
active in the movement. We sat together
surrounded by angry, hostile, white
men," Patch said. As black people voted
quietly, they were left wondering whose

March 17,2011

house would be bombed next.
Eventually, a group of hostile teenagers
threw a live snake at their feet. "It was
terrifying being surrounded by people

who hated us," she said.
Patch also explained how her time at
Swarthmore galvanized her to play an
active role in the movement, especially
as a member of the* Swarthmore
Political Action Committee (SPAC), a
group of politically-minded students
advocating social change. The group
was able to desegregate a Chester ice
skating rink, charging the manager
with discrimination.
Also a former Swarthmore student,
Judy Richardson left after her sophomore year to work for SNCC for three
years in the early '6os in Georgia,
Mississippi and Alabama. The founder
of the country's largest African
American bookstore and director of
information for the United Church of
Christ Commission for Racial Justice,
Richardson worked on the PBS series
"Eyes on the Prize."
Richardson also discussed the crucial role Swarthmore played in developing her passion for working in civil
rights. "Being on this campus changed
my life forever," she said. A dedicated
member of SPAC, she worked on sever-

al issues ranging from assisting the allblack, all-female staff of the dining hall
to assisting local movements seeking
desegregation in Maryland.
Expelled from Albany State College
for her passionate activism, Bernice
Johnson Reagon graduated from
Spelman College and earned her doctorate in history from Howard University.
A founding member of the SNCC
Freedom Singers, she is currently curator emerita at the Smithsonian National
Museum of American History and professor emerita at American University.
She described how she came to realize that the best way for her to move
ahead in life would be through the Civil
Rights Movement. For instance, after
being harassed by white men shouting
obscenities and throwing eggs and
rocks on a public road in her college
campus, she calledfor the road's closure
and organized mass meetings, ultimately leading to a hostile administration.
"Singing was a major force in my
life," Reagon said, mentioning that she
was active in congregation singing. She
views the act of singing as a way to
express one's voice and opinion.
"You will not have me walking down
the street and people acting as if nobody
has walked down the street. I am going
to be shouting out and sparkling with
energy," she said. "No better way to do
that than to attack racism in the South
which is legal. We were going to act as if
segregation did not exist, acting as if
you are a citizen." Throughout the
panel, Reagon passionately sang songs
or freedom, joined by enthusiastic members of the audience.
The panel received an overwhelmingly positive student response. Gail
Engmann 'l4 was deeply moved by
Reagon's constant use of song in her discussion. "Her voice is so powerful. It

shook that room. It was as if she was

building up her soul, energy and passion, and throwing it at us. It was like
we had no choice but to confront the
energy and passion coming from her,"
she said. "It was inspiring."

NEWS IN BRIEF

Print release stations in McCabe will cut back on paper and ink waste
This past week, new print release
stations were set up in McCabe
library at the recommendation of
Earthlust and the Sustainability
Committee (SusCom) located both
on the ground floor near the main
printers as well as in McCabe's
media centers.
"The print release station is
something ITS has been wanting to
try out, in collaboration with
SusCom, to try to reduce the amount
of paper and ink waste we produce
here at Swarthmore," Kat Clark 'l2,
a member of the environmental
issues group Earthlust, said.
McCabe's print release stations
operate in the same fashion as the
color printer in the Media Center in
Beardsley Hall.
The station was set up next to the
printers where those who had printed documents to the printer in

McCabe could approve the documents they wanted printed. For students, this meant entering their
Swarthmore user ID and password,
then selecting those documents that
need to be released. Documents that
had not been released after thirty
minutes were removed from the
printing queue.
This week was only a test period
for the release stations in order to
see how the print release system
would work in such a busy printing
location.
"We want to make sure that
patrons (guests and non-students)
can continue to print
and also
that we can deal with the load at
crunch times: after classes, before
that's
lunch, and after dinner
when we see peaks (in printing),"
ITS staff member Seth FrisbieFulton said in an e-mail.
...

...

A great deal of effort is being put
into gathering feedback on the performance of the release stations. A
notebook has been available in the
printing area on the first floor for
library goers to share their reactions about the new printing sys-

tem.

According to Chris Gebert,
Access and Lending Technology
Specialist at the library, these reactions
seem
mostly
negative.
However, online feedback being collected by Swarthmore's ITS has had
more mixed results according to

Frisbie-Fulton.

Thus far this semester, McCabe's
first floor printers alone have printed 486,744 pages, the equivalent of
6.04 trees, and the release of 2,190.3
kg of carbon dioxide. Gebert is in
charge of ordering paper for
McCabe's first floor printers.

Penn has many notable alumni. Now it
can add one more to its list
a reality television star.
Ashley Hebert, a fourth-year Penn Dental student, will
be starring in the next season of the "The Bachelorette,"
which will premiere May 23.
Hebert appeared on the "Jimmy Kimmel Show" Monday
night to announce her decision to star in the show.
"She was absolutely a good choice for the next
Bachelorette," College sophomore Margo Slaff said.
Hebert was one of the final three women on Season 15 of
"The Bachelor"
a show where one bachelor selects a
fiancee from 25 candidates
which ended on Monday.
Bachelor Brad Womack sent her home in the episode that
aired Feb. 28.
Hebert will be taking off the next few months of school to
film "The Bachelorette," according to second-year Dental
student Keith Goldman, who is friends with Hebert.
"If she can take time off, it's worth it for true love," Slaff
said. "As long as you're committed to going back [to school]
afterwards, there is no harm."
"I think it's really good that the school's being flexible,"
Goldman said, adding thatPenn even allowed Hebert to film
the opening sequence of the upcoming season in its hallways. "She's exactly like how she appears on TV," Goldman
said. "I hate reality television, but I watched. I will definitely watch the upcoming season to support her."
Although Hebert was unavailable for comment, "she
seems very happy," Goldman said.
In addition to being a Dental student, Hebert has taught
hip-hop dance classes at the Pottruck Fitness Center. "She
is an amazing instructor," said Hebert's supervisor Katie
Huber, who is Pottruck's assistant director of group exercise and instructional classes. "She has a lot of energy."
"She was always really outgoing and nice," Angela
Yecco, another Pottruck instructor, said.
"I am absolutely excited that I go to the same school as
the next Bachelorette," Sloff said.
"I was excited when I found out Ashley went to Penn,"
added College freshman Ilyssa Friedman, who took one of
Hebert's hip-hop classes just to meet her.
"I went up to talk to her after the class, and she was very
friendly," Friedman said. "At the end of the class, she told
everyone to watch 'The Bachelor.' She definitely wanted
people to know she was on the show."

"I order about ten cases
every

(one case holds about ten reams of

that print managing programs such
as release stations can reduce paper
use by 20-40%.
After the testing period, ITS, Sus
Com and Earthlust will decide how
to go forward in making release stations permanent and expanding
them to public printing locations
around campus.
"ITS is looking for tons of feedback on the new system, so people
should definitely feel comfortable
offering up positive or negative

Graduating students face tough job prospects
BY MARISSA MEREDYTH
pittnews.com, Mar. 15', 2011

Despite reports of economic recovery,
Pennsylvania's unemployment statistics
suggest that tough times still loom for students who plan to graduate this May.
Last month, the U.S. Department of
Labor reported that last year the average
unemployment rates rose in 31 states.
Pennsylvania experienced a 0.7 percent increase in unemployment from 2009
to 2010. This places the state's average for
2010 at 8.7 percent
that's below the
national average, which was 9.6 percent.
Last year's national average rose 0.3 percent over the previous year.
These figures caused consternation
among a few of the about 3,500 who will
graduate from Pitt in May. The ceremony

itself is a month and a half away, and
many students have started the job
search.
Two students graduating from the
College of Arts and Sciences said they are
focusing on securing short-term employment for this summer before focusing on
a long-term job search. One student in the
College of Business Administration said
luckily
he
had already secured
employment.

McGillivray felt frustrated with the lack
of jobs available to college graduates.
"It's, like, impossible to find entry-

level jobs," McGillivray said.
She plans to get an internship if she
can't find a job that actually requires a
college degree. "I don't want to feel like I
wasted almost $100,000," she said. The
New York native pays out-of-state tuition,
which rose to $23,732 last year, up from
$20,686 her freshman year.
She has applied for internships in New
York at the Glimmerglass Opera and the
Saratoga Performing Arts Center.
One lecturer in Pitt's economics
department, James Maloy, suggested that

an economic recovery without substantial
job creation cannot be considered a true
recovery.

The high unemployment rate might be

evidence that a recovery is not in the near

future, he said.

In January 2011, Pennslyvania had 194
mass-layoff events
which involved at
least 50 people losing their jobs
and
more than 16,000 unemployment insurance claims, according to the Bureau of

Labor Statistics.
The only states with higher claims
rates were New York and California
with 24,950 and 44,274 respectively.
English writing major Kelsey Ballance
said she had yet to start truly looking for
a job and was more concerned with getting through the semester.
"I have a summer job lined up,"
Ballance said. "But nothing after that."
She will teach marching band kids at a

Penn State: Faculty Senate talks budget, tuition
BY ANNA ORSO
collegian.psu.edu, Mar. 16, 2011

Even though it wasn't outlined in the agenda, discussion surrounding Gov. Tom Corbett's proposed state
budget dominated Tuesday's University Faculty Senate
meeting.

After initial remarks, Penn State President Graham

Spanier addressed the senate regarding the proposed
budget, saying he has received an outpouring of support from community members and Penn State stu-

dents alike.

Additionally, Spanier briefed the senate on the
calling it the single
specifics of the "unfair" cut
largest higher education appropriation cut in
American history.
"We are not responsible for contributing to the state
deficit," Spanier said. "We know that Penn State has to
do its fair share to help the commonwealth, but I don't
think it's a cut of 52.3 percent. There is nothing else in
the budget that looks like a cut of this magnitude."
From an economic standpoint, Spanier said he doesn't understand the cuts because Penn State returns $25
to the commonwealthfor every one dollar it puts in, as
well as doubling money back to taxpayers that they put
in.
Additionally, Spanier addressed a potential rise in
tuition if the proposed budget is passed, saying in-state
tuition would rise at a higher percentage than out-ofstate tuition because those students are already paying
full price for their education.
"If this happens, it represents a cut in the subsidization of undergraduate education for Pennsylvania residents," Spanier said. "On a percentage basis, it's not

Flo Rida chosen as
second Fling opener
BY ARIELLE FOGEL

dailypennsylvanian.com, Mar. 16, 2011

On Wednesday, students were treated
to surprise performances around campus
by the Penn Band and the Penn Glee Club
to advertise the second of the three Spring
Fling concert performers.
Flo Rida, a rapper known for hits such
as "Low," "In the Ayer" and "Right
Round," was confirmed as the second

Fling opening performer at 1:10 p.m. by
34th Street Magazine's blog, "Under the
Button," after students watched Penn
Band march down Locust Walk and a
video posted on "UTB" starring Penn
Cheer where both performed to the tune of
Flo Rida's hit song, "Club Can't Handle
Me Now." Penn Glee Club also performed
the song at the Compass after the
announcement.

Flo Rida will join electronic duo
Ratatat at the Fling concert, along with a
third headlining artist whose identity is
yet to be revealed. Ratatat's performance
was announced Tuesday through a series
of clues distributed throughout campus.
College junior and Social Planning and
Events Committee Concert co-director
Shana Rusonis explained that bringing
Flo Rida to this year's Fling is "a great
opportunity and very relevant."
Flo Rida has had "a lot of hits consistently in the past three years
a lot of
students relate [his songs] to their college
experience," she added.
When the performer was announced,
students were excited by the energy Flo
Rida's songs will bring to Fling.

Wharton freshman Katie Simon
explained that "even though I don't listen

College freshman Tim Dugan agreed.
"Although his lyrics are lacking, he has
great beats [and it's] great music to dance
to so it'll be great for Fling."
Some, however, were disappointed by
the announcement.
"I think they could have done much
better," Wharton sophomore Dionicio
Herrera said. "The lineup is not even half
as good as last year's [Fling concert performers]," he added.
Brianna Mariolle agreed. "I'd be more

slept for eight. Now, if you're going to engage in this
sort of planned sleep deprivation, you'll first have to
ensure that when you do sleep, you do it right.
If you plan to spend less time in your bed, you'll
have to ensure that the time you do spend there is
not wasted. First and foremost, you want to guarantee the minimal passage of time between laying
down and falling asleep.
Let's start with things to avoid. Before you even
hop into bed, you must first make sure that you're
not caffeinated. Caffeine will usually stay in your
system for at least three hours, though probably
only you can be the judge of how it affects
more
you (remember that if you're on birth control, your
body may take longer to break down caffeine, so its
effects may have an even longer duration).
Also, avoid drinking alcohol prior to sleeping. It
may temporarily relax you and help you fall asleep,
but it has been shown to interfere with deeper REM
sleep. Finally, avoid bright and artificial light for
the last half hour before you fall asleep. When in
darkness, your body naturally produces melatonin
which facilitates sleep and boosts your immune system. So don't spend that time in bed reading from
your iPad or computer screen or updating
Facebook. Treat your bed as a warm, dark, distraction-free refuge.
The fastest way to fall asleep is to be so relaxed
when your head hits the pillow that you experience
no physical discomfort or mental consternation that
might hinder your blissful passage into dreamland.
To relax your body, try dedicating 5-10 minutes
before you sleep to stretching or yoga in order to
work out the day's kinks. To assuage your mind, try
making a physical to-do list for the next day so that
you don't have to let those thoughts flood your brain
while you're laying down. Most importantly, make
your bed as comfortable as possible so that even the
mere thought of it can induce dreamlike euphoria. I

Opium of the West? Hungarian perceptions of sexuality
swarthmorephoenix.com

Gogolak,
"Comrade
wait! That is a new skirt,
isn't it?" Comrade Virag
said to the maid, as she
was leaving the room
wearing her new belowthe-knee skirt. "Yes, it's
new, Comrade Virag," she
replied, with her usual
tense facial expression.
Then, Comrade Virag
added, "It's too short.
MakiSakuma
Leave sexuality to be the
opium of the declining
Quest for the
West."
Hungarian Identity
This dialogue is from a
well-known scene in one
of the most famous
Hungarian films, "The Witness." A comedy of the communist period in the 19505, many of the film's beautiful quotes have become part of the lexicon of the
Hungarian language. Though the quote above didn't
quite survive in colloquial Hungarian language, it
stands out to me as such an amusingly ironic remark
since I recently wrote in my previous column about
Hungarian adoration of the West, and now plan to
write about Hungarian sexuality, which includes the
current fashion trend of short skirts in Budapest.
Budapest is a fashionable city. A lot of young
women wear mini skirts or very short pants, even if
it's below freezing outside. They wear tall boots and
tights in frigid temperatures; I tried that out and
quickly realized that it takes a bit of effort to pretend
that I'm not cold (it was January) Short skirts, the socalled "opium of the declining West," have certainly
demonstrated their presence on Hungarian streets,
along with their admirers. Oh, poor Comrade Virag.
Although I don't have many examples, there seems
to be a general atmosphere of accepting remarks of
men on women in the presence of women, be it his past
passion on Spice Girls or his friend's girlfriend's
friends. The extreme case is a young pianist whom my
landlady asked me to help with his English.
Interestingly, he seemed to believe that the best way to
improve his oral skills was to talk about all the attrac-

tive girls he has met (the Italian girls, a voluptuous
black woman in Paris, his friend's piano teacher, random girls in bars, etc). He didn't stop there, however;
he told me about the advances he has received from
not so good-looking girls ("50 percent," in his term)
and, how shall I put it, the "misbehaviors" ofhis fellow
piano professors and friends. He claims that pianists
who can truly express music are the people whoknow
all aspects of life. Still, never in my life has anyone
told me about their love for girls so openly.
Hungarians are also very comfortable with public
displays of affection. In my first Hungarian culture
class, my teacher said that she often hears that
American students are surprised by the couples in
streets. One of my classmates explained that she witnessed a couple making out from the top of an escalator to the bottom of it, which she said turned her off. I
often see this too, and I was actually quite relieved to
know that my fellow Americans received such public
displays ofaffection similarly, since I was beginning to
think that maybe I come from too conservative of a
neighborhood. The above mentioned pianist also
explained to me that such public displays of affection
seem to be a "European thing" and that he often hears
Americans voicing their shock.

However, I've also discovered that the trend seems

to be more or less a characteristic of

young people.

When having breakfast with my landlady and her husband, I said a few things that the pianist told me, and
the table fell awkwardly silent for a while. I also asked
another Hungarian who studied abroad in Japan last
year about public displays of affection. He said that
people in his generation or older are against some
excessive behavior, though Hungarians think that
finding one's love is a good thing and kissing in public
generally is considered ordinary behavior. Later I
found out that he is young, 24 or 25, and there was a
picture of him in Japan with a sash that says, "sukebe
daihyo," which means "representative of erotomanias." I just laughed and decided to give up on
capturing the elusive "Hungarian trend."
Matters on sexuality depend on one's personal
background so much so that a moderate Hungarian
can seem to be an erotomaniac in Japan, and there are
only so many people you can meet. Therefore I do not
claim that I delivered to you a picture of the
Hungarian trend of sexuality, but this is a slice ofmy
life in Budapest.

Most commonly, the saxophone is
associated with jazz, blues, pop and big

Larson has practiced under Sam
Lorber 'B9 for five semesters. "I've

serves as a testament to these years of
work, especially since one of Larson's
selections is the first piece he worked on
under Lorber's tutelage. "I feel that this is
a culmination of this work that I've done
over my four years. These works are the
works that any serious student of the saxophone plays, so by performing them I
feel like I'm claiming my position as an

For the recital, Larson selected seven

devote proper attention to interpretation
and furthermore adding emotion to the
music," Larson said.
Larson explained that he attempts to
express strong emotion from his saxophone similar to an opera singer. Lorber
...

reinforces this by stating how Larson's
performances instill "the same kind of
expressiveness and refinement and
nuance that [audiences] may be more
accustomed to hearing from a flutist, or a
string player, or a singer." Last semester,
Larson performed the Russian composer
Alexander Glazunov's saxophone concerto with the Swarthmore College
Orchestra. Larson hopes to bring this
type ofemotion to his recital on Saturday.
After majoring in music at
Swarthmore, Lorber then received his
Masters in saxophone performance along
with a graduate diploma- from the New
England Conservatory. Lorber said that
accesall of Larson's selections are
sible, and they provide a very good
glimpse of the core of the classical saxophone repertoire."

Lorber is excited for his student's perespecially because Larson is
his first student attending Swarthmore.
After being a Swarthmore music student
himself, Lorber enjoys the chance to be on
the other side of a Swarthmore student's
musical education. Reflecting upon the
student body, he praises the students'
ability to perform excellently while completing courses in every division.
"Witnessing [Larson] taking on that role,
because he's an econ major and a music
minor... It's a great example of what the
kind of people who attend Swarthmore
are capable of. They can excel in other
formance,

fields while simultaneously preparing
these performances and playing at a very
high level, showcasing a whole other side
of their personalities," Lorber said.
Fumiko Egawa 'll, is planning" on
attending the performance. "I've known
Soren since freshman year, and I'm really
excited to see how far he's come as a
musician. He is a diligent student who
applies himself to anything that he
decides to pursue academically, hut has
always made timeto practice." Egawa is a
clarinetist in the Orchestra, and remembers practicing in rooms next to Larson
throughout their time at Swarthmore.
"As a member of the Swarthmore College
Orchestra, I greatly enjoyed listening to
his Glazanov performance. It was techniquely brilliant and the musicality really shone through, a testament to his
development as a musician."
For his concert on Saturday, Larson
hopes his audience will come "to perceive
the saxophone as a legitimate concert
instrument. The saxophone is the most
versatile reed wind instrument available
to orchestrators; it can provide orchestras
so much color." He also believes that the
performance will demonstrate a new side
of the saxophone to the audience, since
people tend to associate the instrument
with jazz, pop or blues. "There's a thriving and long historied tradition to the
instrument which most people never
encounter," Larson said.

Name: Sneha Shrestha

describes this statement piece as
"long, like a chandelier and embedded with heavy stones."

Year: 2011

From: Kathmandu, Nepal
Current Residence: Wharton
What She's Wearing:
Shrestha is sporting an eclectic mix of pieces from multiple countries. Her vintage gray faux-fur jacket is from
Prague, where she spent a semester abroad last year.
Prague is better known for its architectural monuments
than its shopping. However, the city's vintage stores
attracted Shrestha. "You can find clothes in Prague very
cheaply," she said. "I think the most cheaply in Europe."
Shrestha layered her metallic gray tank under her
jacket from MANGO. Her dark denim jeans are from a
Vero Moda store in Copenhagen, where she spent her
summer. Shrestha maintains a largely neutral color
scheme in her outfit, which is complemented by her black
leather boots from her mother in Nepal. The boots are
actually an item from a family business. "My cousin
opened a shoe store there recently," Shrestha said. Printed
with a profile of actress Audrey Hepburn, the large button-shaped earrings she dons are also from Prague.
How She Describes Her Style:
Comfort largely dictates her style, as Shrestha prefers
clothing that is easy to wear. She focuses on the texture
and pattern of fabrics and prefers natural materials. "I
travel a lot so my clothes are from all over the place," she
said, noting that her style has developed through the various purchases from her travels. "I'm originally from
Nepal and growing up I traveled a lot to Asia, Europe and
now I've come here to the states. Travelling influences my
fashion a lot," she said.
Favorite Item in Her Closet:
Given the priority Shrestha places on comfort, she
favors a pair of comfy black heels, a gift from her mother.
"I have amazing memories dancing in these shoes.
They're heels that are comfortable to dance in," she said.
Also, Shrestha enjoys collecting earrings since they make
great souvenirs. "They're small and portable so I have a
lot of earrings from all over the place," she said. Her most
treasured pair is one of her purchases from India. She

Where She Shops:
For traditional dress worn at festivals and weddings in Kathmandu,
India is a must for Shrestha. "My
brother recently got engaged and we
shopped for everything in Delhi and
Bombay. That's where you can get the
embroidery, patterned fabric and sari,"
she said. Over the years, Shrestha has
acquired a large collection of traditional dresses. "People remember what you
wore to a wedding, so for every wedding
I have to buy a new dress," she said.
In terms of contemporary wear,
Shrestha enjoys shopping at small vintage boutiques in Prague and New York.
When she visits the Big Apple, Shrestha
makes a stop in East Village to visit "little
hidden stores where you can find unique
things."

Fashion and Her Heritage:
People of Kathmandu, the largest metropolitan center of Nepal, are increasingly
influenced by Western fashion trends as
more people are travelling abroad. With
more thana hundred languages spoken and a
variety of ethnic groups, this capital city
boasts a multicultural demographic, which is
reflected in fashion. In addition to Western
clothing, the people of Kathmandu wear traditional dress such as shalwar kameezs and
saris. Shrestha has found a surprising number
of uses for these forms of traditional dress at
Swarthmore College. For example, a friend borrowed a traditional outfit for Screw Your
Roommate to dress as a Bollywood actress. Also, Shrestha
has worn saris during both her first year and sophomore
year while performing Bollywood dances for the student
cultural groups Deshi and i2O.

attempted to construct pieces addressing Japan's earthquake, but these were
largely incoherent and inexplicably
full of sheep, so they didn'tbother sending them to their editors. Most of them
got depressed and decided to take naps.
But humor columnists are useless
let's forget about them. The larger
point is this: things haven't been silly
enough, which, considering we live in
the universe, is mightily peculiar. But
don't panic! I happen to have a plan.
My plan entails the construction of a
system ofacademic disciplines parallel
to those that exist currently, but which
bear the distinguishing feature of

THE PHOENIX

being extremely silly. One might study
silly history for instance, in which
pupils would look at history, find it
hysterically funny and then proceed to
laugh wildly at it for hours. "HAHAHAHA! The Battle of Hastings! hehehhahahaha!!!" they would gasp,
"NAPOLEON! HOO BOY!!! HAHAHAHA!!! We're dying, here, hahaha the
War of 1812 hehe!" etc. Or, silly philosophy in which one laughs at philosophy.
Out of this one may derive silly
Nietzsche, silly Platonic forms, silly
logic and the silly abyss, among others.
In silly astronomy one laughs at the
stars. Silly chemistry and silly medicine may be slightly more dangerous,
but all the more silly for it.
Now, once silly academia has begun
this revolution we can go even further
with the notion of parallel disciplines.
Yesterday, I was fortunate enough to
spend 11 hours on a train, during
which I came up with another plan. I
happened to be sitting in front of a very
pleasant person of approximately one
year of age who first entered my consciousness when he leaned over tiie top
of my seat, pointed very deliberately
out the window and said "Blaaaah!!" To
this I said something like, "yes, it is
tree!" And he said "Flah blooga!" and
we carried on like this for some time.
What particularly caught my attention

was his .reaction to New York City
when this small traveler pressed up
against the window and spent the next
15 minutes or so exclaiming "Blah!!"
every few seconds. I was pressed up
against a window myself experiencing
a very similar "sentiment. "Blah!
Building! Blah! Another building! It's
all so extraordinarily tall! Blah!"
I think this should be the basis of
another field of academic disciplines:
Awestruck Academia. In this, pupils
will be simply overwhelmed with wonder
at
everything. Awestruck
Mathematics:
"Matrices!!
Holy
smokes!! The Pythagorean Theorem,
Gosh!!! Wow!!! Blah!!" Awestruck
astronomy would be out of control
pupils would look at the sky and simply faint. This will naturally lead to
Teary Academia, in which all studies
reduce students to tears. In teary
physics, students cry for leptons, for
bosons and for the 11th dimension. In
teary English literature, students cry
about everything. In teary astronomy,
students don't even have to look at the
sky. All they have to do is think about
it and they're gone weeping 'til sunrise,
which brings on a whole new
onslaught of feeling itself. Teary
astronomers are really a mess.
The pinnacle ofall of these things, of
course, would be funky academia,

March 17, 2011

which somewhat defies description. It
would encompass the silly, the
awestruck and the teary and then go
further. There would be a lot of music
and an unusually high incidence of
textbooks spontaneously turning into
cauliflowers.
It won't be at all difficult to implement any of these, because the truth is
we're nearly there: English literature
when practiced properly is bound to be
teary, philosophy is already silly and
stars are pretty funky. Therefore
gloomy humor columnists have no
excuse. To them I say, "Think of the
Battle of Hastings! Have you forgotten
silly Nietzsche?!" But to no avail. I suppose one has to forget a little about how
incredibly silly, awe-inspiring, sad and
funky things are, in order to maintain
some semblance of composure. With
teary astronomy running around the
place it would be amazing if anyone
ever stopped crying. "Hahahahaha,"
we'd gasp skipping giddily from silly
existentialism, "OH MY GOSH, A
SQUIRREL!!!!!! And a tree!! And oh, the
SUN, WOO!!" Even now things are
funky enough that I should probably
submit this piece to the Living and
Arts Editors before my computer turns
into a cauliflower.

Open questions on Political participation
should be exercised with
unionization's
responsibility and care
future at the inn
BY

STEVE O'CONNELL
soconnell@swarthmore.edu

BY RICK LOWE

The March 2 labor panel did not address the main questions that confront the Swarthmore community with respect to labor relations at the proposed Inn. As background: A large national union, working with SLAP, is
urging the college to sign a "neutrality" agreement that would allow that
union to organize a card-check process without interference or contribution of views from the college.
In a card-check process, union organizers solicit signatures from workers stating that they support the designation of that union as their sole representative in collective bargaining negotiations.
Once 50 percent of workers have signed, certification of the union is
close to being a fait accompli. Independently of any neutrality agreement
and/or card-check process, the Inn's workers have the right, under national law, to petition for union status.
If 30 percent of workers sign a petition, the National Labor Relations
Board will determine whether the workers comprise a group with a collective interest as appropriately defined, and if so will organize an on-site certification vote via secret ballot (Yes/No, majority rule) in which 90 percent
or more of the relevant employers are likely to vote.
The panel discussed the considerations that differentiate a
neutrality/card-check process from the NLRB process, but did not address
the following four questions:
Will signing a neutrality Icard-check agreement lead to union certification,
while the NLRB process will not?
I ask this because the national union has an interest in organizing
Swarthmore workers whether or not this will make these workers better
off. This interest is both general
organizing one more workplace means
more members, which in turn means more fees and more clout on any
issue that matters to the union
and specific to Swarthmore
adding an
elite liberal-arts college to the union's list, and especially one with a reputation for progressive values, has marquis value.
The SLAP/union argument is that a neutrality/card-check process is
necessary because (1) unionization is obviously desirable
f°r workers and (2) employers can derail the NLRB process
pTjTT|J by intimidating workers. But is item (2) even relevant for
this particular employer?
If not, then item (1) is irrelevant, because workers can
always use the NLRB process. And if item (2) is relevant at Swarthmore,
then why not advocate a neutrality agreement without a card-check
process? To say this another way: Unless you have ulterior motives that
favor unionization, what's wrong with a secret ballot process in which
workers are protected from harassment of all kinds
from the union and
its organizers, as well as from the college?
7s unionization in the interests of the workers of the Inn?
The discussion proceeded as if the only urgent issue were about alternative pathways to unionization. But if there are both pros and cons for
workers, how will workers inform themselves about these, if a neutrality
agreement results in having only one view (the union's) represented?
Is there a casefpr unionization if the college operates the Inn directly, so
that employees are college staff rather than being employees of a sub-contracted firm in the hospitality industry?
If the answer is no, then the college should certainly not sign a neutrality agreement before the operational structure is determined. In addition,
the college may want to consider committing itself publicly and in advance
(independently of any unionization process) to an agreement that would
bind any subcontractor to labor standards that are consonant with the college's values. If such a policy already exists, the college should reiterate it
publicly, at which point the unionization debate may have little remaining

The college has stated that the Inn project is consonant with its mission

Given the disquieting level of discord regarding the liquor referendum petition
and the related editorial and letters to the editor, I feel it is my duty as Mayor to
offer my thoughts: Let's bear in mind the obvious, that we all live in such a small
town that it is so easy for us to run into each other in the Coop, walking the College
campus, or a dozen other places.
This basic fact should inform how we exercise our political rights and how we
comment about others in our community. Just because we can do
jMMMVM something doesn't mean we should.
The wiser course of action is to think through whether any given
Vm
BMBBBBi course of action is appropriate for our small town, where, at some
level, we're all trying to live harmoniously, and where there's a
common understanding that we have a better chance of thriving when civility prevails.
None of us will ever know exactly what some of the petitioners, when they were
seeking signatures for a liquor referendum, may have said or not. My guess is that
each of us is likely to latch onto an anecdote or two that comports with our view of
the situation. So my suggestion is to take the stories with a large grain of salt:
Generalizing from a few stories is not likely to lead to a full understanding of the
entire effort.
Of course, it would be disappointing to learn that some petitioners may have
shared less information with residents than the petitioners themselves would have
expected had they been asked for their signature on a petition. The possibility that
disappointing actions may have been taken by some of our young people makes the
situation all the more disheartening.
In thinking about this, I was reminded of a lesson I learned while taking a firstyear philosophy course in college: that Aristotle teaches that virtue is a function of
habit. So if you do the small things right, you're more likely to have the fortitude
to do the big things right when the time comes.
And conversely, if you act improperly on some small things, it's more likely that
you will lack the strength to do the big things properly. I think it's worth keeping
this sage counsel in mind.
Being a college town, we will always have some who take strident and strong positions. That's a great part of living here in Swarthmore. But in doing so, we're likely to be closer as a community if we all exercise some self-control as we exercise our
rights, in matters both large and small.
That said, it's fair to say that when others respond with their comments, especially in writing, moderation should be our guide. As tempting as it is to use strong
language to voice frustration about the perceived shortcomings of others, the use of
more moderate language is likely to make the same point, but with less pressure on
our sense of community.
In reading the colorful comments in The Swarthmorean, I was reminded of the
teachings of Abe Lincoln: "With malice toward none, and with charity toward all."
Obviously, he expressed that sentiment in the content of one of the most perilous
chapters of our nation's history. But the application of those words to our situation
appears to be appropriate and worth remembering.
We have a great town, and our diversity of opinion and our high level of energy
to engage in the political process are several features that make many of us love living here. But as we do, let's remember that we are all one community, and we reveal
our best character when we guide ourselves accordingly.

There must be some disadvantages to introducing an adversarial principle of labor relations into a community in which, in all other respects,
the central presumption has been one of shared interests.
There also must be some disadvantages to requiring both parties to the
local employment relationship to respond to the priorities of a large thirdparty institution (the union). Are these unimportant relative to the benefits of unionization?
I see the panel as an invitation to focus on these four questions.

Feb. 3 article on Swat's alcohol policy
To the Editor:
Jeff Davidson's article in the Phoenix
on February 3 did a good job summarizing the College's alcohol policy, however, the sections relating to enforcement
of the policy especially as it relates to
Pennsylvania's legal drinking age left
some room for clarification.
Our campus is "policed" by several
entities. Most notably is our own Public
Safety department. To a significant
degree the Swarthmore Borough Police
have always been involved and agents
from the Pa. State Police Liquor Control
Enforcement (LCE) division have
statewide jurisdiction.
In the not so distant past, the LCE
division has visited numerous nearby

March 17,2011

college campuses, as it is their right to
do so. Whenever any of the aforementioned entities become aware of a campus situation in which alcohol intoxication jeopardizes an individual's health
or safety and/or plays a role in unlawful
conduct these entities promptly become
involved.
Further, in accordance with departmental guidelines and state law, citations are issued where appropriate for
underage drinking. The college takes all
local, state and federal laws seriously as
it does its role to inform and educate students of these laws and their possible
consequences.

Obama administration takes amateur route in Libya

swarthmorephoenix.com

Whenever an event rises
onto the world stage, the

United States articulates a
firm stance on the conflict.
There is always a clear
direction America articulates that other nations often
follow, or at least react
against.

Essentially,

America is the first to develop a position. The United
States can provide legitimacy to one side or movement

The Swarthmore
has a particular responsibilConservative
ity to promote movements
for democracy around the
world and give legitimacy to all who seek freedom.
The Obama administration has taken a different path
with regards to the situation in Libya. While countries
such as France and England came out with statements
early in the crisis that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
needed to be ousted, the United States floundered.
And, to be honest, there were valid reasons the
United States has stayed out of the Libyan controversy.
If President Obama or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
came out at the beginning of the crisis committing to
ousting Gaddafi by any means possible, then we would
have to say the same to the other dictatorships that are
closer to home, such as in Cuba and Venezuela.
However, the administration was quick (weU, once
Obama came out with a statement) to call for an
American aUy, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, to
step down. This action, which I agreed with, gave the
protesters in Egypt more legitimacy, and it assured the
rest of the world that changing the status quo in Egypt
would be acceptable to the United States. Calling for
Mubarak to give up power also made the Arab world,
which is largely anti-American, support our stance on
the conflict.

Obama and his administration dithered at the beginning of the Libyan crisis, and continues to wait for other
actors to develop their stances. Yet, there is no threat to

America's national interest if Gaddafi were to lose
power besides the status quo not being maintained.
There is simply no logic to the waiting-game that has
been played. On the surface, this policy is confusing
the U.S. supports the overthrow of its ally (Mubarak)
while allowing a murderous dictator (Gaddafi) to do as
he pleases.
This lack of direction appears amateur on the world
stage. If the United States wants to continue its leadership role in the world, it must act as a guide in circumstances like this one. The administration has taken too
long to develop a clear policy on Libya to present to
the international commu-

"a wise thing to do." Apparently, "the discussion" about
the policy was still going on.
Gates was covering for the administration which was
unsure about what actions to take with regards to
Libya. The next day when the administration endorsed
a "no-fly" zone following the recommendation of the
Arab League, it was clear Obama was waiting for other
nations in the region to create a policy. While the Arab
world may be unwilling to admit it, they were waiting
for America's response to the situation. And, this was a
response they never received.

The debate about a "nofly" zone has dominated
headlines, yet no action
has been taken. Gaddafi
has continued to use air
strikes on the rebels and
civilians to quell the revolution. On Sunday, Washington finally endorsed the proposal, but only after the Arab League put its support
behind the plan. And, we .would have to take a major
role in creating this no-fly zone, an action that the
administration is also unwilling to commit to.
It should be noted that France and England have
been calling for a no-fly zone for weeks while the United
States has done nothing except ask Saudi Arabia to provide arms to the Libyan rebels. The heavy lifting has
been done by the rest of the world, while Gaddafi's
forces have advanced into the rebels' territory. The
United States is just beginning to call for a "no-fiy" zone
when this should already be in place.
Instead, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said last
Saturday that while the United States had the ability to

currently.

The Obama administration needs to understand that there are times when bold actions are necessary. The world waited for an American opinion on
Gaddafi, then on the "no-fly" zone. In the meantime,
Gaddafi killed his own people. This is unacceptable.
It is time for the United States to articulate a firm
position toward dictators who do not respect the rights
of their own people. If rebels choose to rise up against
the government in these cases, America must put its full
support behind them. As a democratic country, we have
an obligation to support those around the world seeking
the same freedom and security we enjoy every day.
America must step up to the plate and lead. Anything
less in unacceptable.

March 17,2011

The situation in California perhaps
best exemplifies the sorry state of the
American debate on budgets and taxation. Governor Brown has' been trying to
win over just a few Republican state senators and representatives in order to
place an initative on the ballot that would
ask voters to approve tax increases.
California requires a two-thirds super
majority or a referendum to raise taxes.
The rule is the result of a referendum
that easily passed even in this deep blue
state.

The success of that resolution, which
has made it nearly impossible to raise
taxes in the Golden State was made possible by the unchallenged dominance of
anti-tax politics since at least the Reagan
years. The success ofanti-tax politics was
at least in part the inevitable result of a
racial politics that portrayed taxation as
an attempt to take from 'iis" and give to
"them."
But it was also the consequence of a
spineless opposition that failed to link
taxation in voters' minds with universally popular investments and infrastructure such as those discussed above.
As the budget battle drags on,
Republicans are employing the same pernicious and disingenuous tactic at the
national level, where, in the real world,
there is no budget crisis in the short or
medium-term. For the sake of the unions,
the non-rich and the country, the
Democrats should follow Senator
Sander's lead and demand that the
wealthy pay their fair share.

Garnet lacrosse teams victorious in recent games
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's and women's lacrosse teams
didn't have a relaxing spring break. While some students were at home sleeping in, both teams faced a challenging gauntlet of three games. The women took two of
three, while the men fell in all games.
The women romped to a 17-4 win in their season and
home opener against the College of Notre Dame. After
giving up an early goal, the Garnet went on a lightningquick 8-0 run to take an insurmountable lead just nine
minutes into the game. Swarthmore outscored the
Gators 9-3 over the rest of the match.
Annalise Penikis 'l3 led the offense in her
Swarthmore debut, scoring five goals with three assists.
Annelise Mowry 'l2 added four of her own and Emily
Evans 'll piled on three more goals.
Corinne Sommi 'l4 flashed signs of overall talent,
scoring a goal, dishing out five assists and picking up
five ground balls. Nicole Vanchieri 'l3 also played very
well, leading the team with seven ground balls.
After dominating at home, the Garnet flew to
Colorado for their spring break trip. The women
dropped their first game to Colorado College 13-1L
Despite leading at halftime, the Tigers rallied in the second half to take the win.
Penikis again dominated on offense scoring five
goals. Sommi added three more.
The Garnet got back on the winning track against the
College of Wooster, running away with a 19-8 win.
Wooster got on the board first early in the game, but
Swarthmore then went on a 10-0 run to put the game out
of reach early.
Mowry scored five goals to lead the way, and four of
them during the Garnet's dominant run. Evans and
Marie Mutryn 'l2 scored four and Penikis added three
more.
In goal, Michelle Ammerman 'l4 recorded nine saves
in an outstanding performance.
Mowry said
Ammerman "was a key component in our win."
Mowry also liked the challenging teams the Garnet
faced on their Colorado trip.
"The games were really good preparation for going
into the rest of the season with our tough conference,"
she said. "The trip really helped us come together as a
team and work on improving our midfield transitions
and playing under high pressure."
Mutryn added that the location itself was a challenge.
"The hardest part about our games and practices was
adjusting to the altitude in Colorado."
The women returned to the area on Tuesday, traveling to Widener. The Garnet swamped the Pride from the
opening whistle, running away to an 18-8 win. Mowry,
Vanchieri and Mutryn each scored four goals, while

Allegra Pocinki Phoenix Staff

Garnet lacrosse players move the ball out of their defense zone. The team dropped a close game to the Colorado
College Tigers, losing 9-8 in overtime.
Penikis added three goals and four assists.
The men stayed closer to home for break. The Garnet
fell in their home opener to Widener 6-5 in a close-fought
game. Although they led 5-4 going into the fourth quarter, the Garnet couldn't hold on. .
The game's outcome was in doubt the entire way, as
Jonathan Molloy 'l4 got a shot off with six seconds that
would have forced overtime. But the Widener goalie
made the save to ice the game.
Zach Belden 'l2 led the Garnet in the game, scoring
two goals and adding an assist. John Bukawyn 'l2 added
two assists.
Traveling to Lynchburg, the Garnet started slow,
falling behind the Hornets 5-0 in the first quarter. The
two teams played evenly from there, but it wasn't
enough to catch up. Swarthmore fell 10-5.
Bukawyn led the team with two goals and picked up
three ground balls as well. Richard Brode 'll led the
defense with five caused turnovers and four ground
balls.
Returning home, the Garnet continued to play teams
closely, coming out on the wrong side of the score again.
Visiting Colorado College escaped with a 9-8 win in over-

time.

Swarthmore was down by three with five minutes left
in the game, but staged a frantic rally to tie the game.
But the energy didn't carry over into the extra period, as
Colorado scored just 45 seconds into the session.
Michael Brockway 'l2 had an excellent game in goal,
making 18 saves. Mark Czernyk 'll also played a good
game, leading the team with eight ground balls.
The Garnet were led by a balanced attack, as Wes
Marcik 'l3, Max Hubbard 'l2 and Daniel Kowalyshyn 'l4
each scored two goals.
The Garnet hosted Wooster last night, picking up
their first win of the season by a score of 9-5. The Garnet
led from start to finish, scoring their first two goals in
just 34 seconds.
Molloy had an exceptional day, scoring four goals and
recording an assist. Brockway had 12 saves to keep the
defense strong.
Coming up next for the Garnet, the women take on
Immaculata tonight at 6 p.m. at Clothier Field and host
Ursinus this Saturday at 12 p.m. in their Centennial
Conference opener. The men open conference matches
against Ursinus the same day at 3 p.m.

restarted 10 years ago
is trying
to recapture that tradition. Winning this
week's American College
Cricket
Championship in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
would be a big step.
Cricket is the "non-American version of
baseball," according to senior captain
Saksham Karwal. Teams field 11 players,
including one bowler, or pitcher. The
opposing team bats and tries to score as
many runs as possible. Once the ball is hit
in play, two batters, spaced 22 yards apart,

wooden stakes in the ground
behind each batter. A batter can get out if
his hit is caught before the ball touches the
ground, or if the ball hits the wickets
behind him.
Cricket is popular mainly in England,
Australia, South Africa and the Indian subcontinent, where most of the Penn players
are from.
Karwal says the sport is gaining
momentum in North America with the
growth of local cricket clubs and supporting organizations like the U.S.A. Cricket
Association. Many of the area's universities, including Villanova, Temple and
Drexel, also field teams.
As the sport continues to grow, so does
Penn's cricket club.
The group, which has doubled in size in
the past five years, is made up of about 30

undergraduate and graduate students,
mostly from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Each year the team recruits students
from countries where cricket is popular.
Karwal said that many international students are thrilled to find out about the
cricket club and need no convincing to join
the team. Some even choose Penn specifically because of its cricket team.
Junior Roshan Rai said the cricket club
was "one of the biggest reasons for applying
to Penn," while sophomore Jay Dave contacted Karwal after seeing cricket on the
list ofclubs at Penn after he was admitted.
Karwal, Rai and Dave are three of the
club's top players who will travel to Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. this wee*k to face 32 colle-

giate teams from the United States and

Canada in the championship. Penn will be
the only Ivy League representative.
This is the third collegiate cricket championship tournament and the second
appearance for the Quakers. They will face
six teams in their group and must win the
group to move on.

March 17, 2011

At last year's competition, the team
failed to make it out of group play and into
the semifinals. This year, it's expecting
more.
Many of the players said this is easily
the best team they've seen at Penn, noting
that it is more talented, balanced and experienced than in previous years.
"We have to [place first] and we can,"
Karwal said. "We will not be satisfied without the trophy."
"We have a fixed mindset," Dave added.
"Last year was about going out there and
having fun, and this year we actually want
to bring back the trophy."
While, winning a championship would
mean a lot to Karwal and his team, bringing pride to the University is the foremost
goal.
"We are going there only for one reason
to represent the University and to do the
entire University proud, and I know that
we will not let them down," Karwal said.

Experienced Garnet baseball team off to a fast start
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS
aapostol@swarthmore.edu

Last season, the Swarthmore College
baseball team threw off the mantle of the
perennial cellar-dweller, putting together
a 20-18 record and reaching the
Centennial Conference playoffs for the
first time in school history. With such
success comes a new set of expectations,
but the 2011 version of the Garnet seems
to be in no rush to return to the lowly
ranks of previous incarnations. During
the first week of competition, consisting
of a seven-game spring break trip to
Myrtle Beach, SC and a Sunday doubleheader to kick off the home season, the
team compiled a 6-4 record and boasted a
string of personal accomplishments that
bode quite well for the rest of the year.
The week-long junket to South
Carolina was "much different than what
we've done in the past," according to fifthyear head coach Stan Exeter. "Going to
an actual tournament... we haven't done
that in several years. The fields were
great, the competition was good," Exeter
said. "We played very well, especially
coming off a week of tough injuries."
Miles Santo 'l2 and Anthony
Montalbano 'l2 have missed much of the
season so far due to injury and illness and
shortstop Thomas Nakamura 'll was
shelved for three games. Others, however, have stepped up in a big way to begin
the season in the absence of some of the
team's veterans, and the Garnetreturned

Mike
Waterhouse 'l2 was named Player of the
Week in the Conference for his hot start.
After an outstanding sophomore year in
which he led the team with a .392 batting
average and finished second with a .460
on base percentage, Waterhouse picked
up right where he left off, hitting .379
through the first week with a .571 on base
percentage and a .517 slugging percentage.

Junior Mike Cameron, who's base percentage is .543, scored one run in Sunday's game against SUNY-IT.

Exeter said. Rodriguez stands at 1-1 on
the season, with a 2.08 ERA and 15 strikeouts in 13 innings.
Breakout performances by a trio of
underclassmen solidified the Garnet
attack from the plate and the mound, as
outfielder and first baseman Nicko
Burnett 14, left fielder Rory McTear 'l3
and pitcher Ramsey Walker 'l3 are turning heads in the Conference.
Burnett, regularly hitting in the middle of the lineup despite just one week of
college experience, boasts a .385 average
with 11 runs batted in through Sunday.
McTear, who started just 17 games last
year, has started every game so far this
season, batting .351 with a team-leading 13
hits.
McTear attributes his first-week numbers to a "calmer and more confident
approach at the plate [and] hard work to
get better in the off-season."
"I knew that an outfield spot was opening up with [right fielder] Jimmy [Gill 10]
graduating last year and I workedhard to
put myself in a position to get some playing time, but I am also trying to stay
focused and not be complacent with a little early success," McTear said.
Walker, a year removed from a spotty
first-year season which saddled him with
a 7.91 ERA, has proven himself a more
than viable option out of the bullpen or in
the rotation. The 6'5" right-hander has

striking out five. "Both [Walker and
McTear] are having great starts to their
sophomore year," Exeter said.

First baseman Michael Cameron 'l2
and center fielder Ben Schneiderman 'll
begin the year among the offensive team
leaders. Cameron, through Sunday, is second on the team in on base percentage
(.543) and third in average (.360);
Schneiderman is fourth in RBIs, with
nine. Pitcher Neil Mejia 'll has put
together a successful first week out of the
bullpen, sporting a 312 ERA with seven
strikeouts over 8.2 innings, and Zach
Weiner 'l2 has been stellar over 13
innings, compiling a 2-0 record with a 2.08
ERA.
With so many success stories in just
the first nine games, it isn't hard to imagine that this year's team may surpass the
standard set by last year's. "We feel like
just getting back to the playoffs would be
a disappointment this year," McTear said.
"We're shooting for a Conference title."
"We have the talent and experience to
make this a special year," Rodriguez said.
Although Swarthmore took a 7-4 loss
to PSU-Abington on Tuesday, Waterhouse
continued his tear, going 3-3 with 3 RBIs
and a walk; Cameron went 2-5, and
Montalbano, playing his first full game of
the year, also picked up a pair of hits. The
Garnet will travel to Immaculata on
Friday. First pitch is set for 3 p.m.
