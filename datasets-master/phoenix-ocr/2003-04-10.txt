Dining Services constructs elevated platforms for checkers
For the past few weeks, a room at the top of Sharpies was mysteriously closed off. This week, students got a chance to see what
the staff has been working on when new stands for meal card
checkers were put into use. Director of Dining Services Linda
McDougall said, "We feel these'new checker stands are long overdue." The new stands, she said, will make a much better presen-

tation than the tables currently used, and the checkers will be at
eye level with students.
To keep costs down, Scott Tutton, a manager at Sharpies, constructed the new checker stands, and Facilities provided the
counter tops.

How student wages stack up
BY JARED LENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu

Compared to many universities and other liberal arts colleges, Swarthmore pays its student workers less for top payscale jobs. Its rigid system provides for only a 50-cent
increase in wages from the lowest to the highest paid student positions, though the college does pay roughly the same
as other schools for low pay-scale jobs.
In the 2001-2002 academic year, the college's maximum
student wage of $7.25 was the second to lowest of the 31 members of the Consortium of Higher Education (COFHE), an
institutionally supported organization of 31 private colleges
and universities regarded as Swarthmore's "peer" institutions. While a handful of other colleges, including Bryn
Mawr, Smith, Trinity, Wesleyan and Oberlin, also paid less
than $8 an hour to students in the top pay scale, the majority of COFHE schools paid over $lO an hour to top student
earners. Many of these schools are located in cities, where
wages are generally higher.
"For some jobs, it really seems as though students
should be paid more," said Wuryati Morris 'O4, a public

areas consultant manager for Information Technology
Services. "For example, it seems unfair that students get
paid so little to drive the shuttle early in the morning or
late at night."
Swarthmore's current wage levels are $7 per hour for a
Category I job, such as monitoring the game room, $7.25 for
a Category II job, such as working for the intramural sports
program, and $7.50 for a Category 111 job, such as working for
ITS. Jobs are assigned a wage category based on such factors
as independence, problem-solving, creativity or the supervision of others.
Student wages are generally inflation-indexed and forthat
reason will increase by L 8 percent next year. The last major
increase in student wages was a 17 percent pay hike two
years ago. Only student workers who receive stipends, such

THE PHOENIX

as resident assistants and writing associates, fall outside the

per-hour wage system.

The low maximum student wage has made it especially
difficult to find students willing to work late night and early
morning hours. Despite being top pay-scale jobs, certain
early morning life-guarding and shuttle-driving shifts, for
example, have proven difficult to fill.
ITS, which also pays in the top pay scale, has had prob-

lems withretention.
"While it's not so much of a problem right now because of
the state of the economy, we sometimes do have trouble filling positions," said ITS Help Desk Coordinator Heather
Dumigan. "We often had students who would work here for
a while, then they'd go off campus and find a higher paying
job."

The college is not likely to dramatically increase the top
student pay rates, Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot
said, pointing out that concerns over these issues have been
discussed in the past.
"Our budget and policies are set with all in mind and are
not changed to entice workers," Talbot said in an e-mail. "We
certainly don't pay students what their work might be worth
in the world beyond our borders. We are and must be a separate market unto ourselves."
However, some campus employers have found their own
solution: padding hours.
"I think a lot of stuff wouldn't get done if hours weren't
padded," Raghu Karnad 'O5 said. "I currently have a job
where they pad my hours. If they didn't, I wouldn't do the
job. They couldn't get anyone to do it. I really don't see a
problem with paying jobs according to supply and
demand."
Talbot stressed that the college frowns upon padding hours.
"We tell all employers and employees that an hour's pay for
an hour's work is the only way time slips may be completed,"

that must be our goal," he said.
This Palestinian "change of heart" needs to
come about without the need for Israel to make
more concessions, Pipes said. This kind of diplomacy only made things worse, giving Arabs the message that Israel was weak, demoralized and "in a
word, destroyable." Pipes said there was a huge rise
in Arab ambition in the 1990s and that "Israel is
now jeopardized by its perceived weakness."

Pipes stopped short of advocating military tactics but said he believed that a respect for and a
fear of attacking Israel would be beneficial. When

questioned, however, he conceded that Palestinian

acceptance of Israel would not necessarily require
the military. "It could go from being completely
nonviolent to extremely violent. I think in this
case it will be somewhere in between," Pipes said.
He repeated that a Palestinian "change of
heart" would be good for all concerned. Israelis
want to be accepted. Americans want the fighting
to stop. Arabs would be able to focus their energy
on improving their economy, which is currently in

dire straits. Presently, their efforts to destroy
Israel are sapping resources that could be better
used elsewhere. "The desire to destroy Israel
trumps everything else," Pipes said.
In the question-and-answer session, one student, Saed Atshan 'O6, who grew up in Palestine,
accused Pipes of "distorting facts." He continued to
argue with Pipes until another student, Jeff Rogg
'O5, told him that he would either have to quiet
down or leave, a move some found inappropriate,
including history professor Allison Dorsey. A
heated argument continued after the lecture.
Students for Truthful Israel Representation
(STIR), a student group founded by Rogg and
Randy Goldstein 'O5 this year, organized the talk.

'ONE BOOK, ONE PHILADELPHIA'
Display highlights
college connections
to historical novel
Next time you've been sitting in
McCabe Library for hours on end and
have table burns on your elbows from
plowing through stacks reading, stand
up, stretch and take a look in the display cases on the main floor.
Over spring break, a display entitled
"Slavery and Freedom in Philadelphia
1855" was arranged in honor of the
novel "The Price of a Child," by Lorene
Cary. Reference Librarian Pamela
Harris and Friends Historical Library
Curator Chris Densmore set up the dis-

play.

The historical fiction novel is based on
Jane Johnson's escape from enslavement in Philadelphia in 1855. The
Friends Historical Library and McCabe
are sponsoring the exhibit and have
gathered material from the college collection related to the book and its
themes. This material ranges from Isaac
Hopper's cane to Underground Railroad
records to a 19th-century city map of
Philadelphia.
The display draws parallels
between the plot of the book and actual historical events. One case contains
the book's description of Philadelphia
alongside an actual map of the city.
This case also calls attention to a

handwritten census report that recorded a man purchasing his own wife and
child to save them from slavery.
Jane Johnson's court testimony,
which The New York Times printed
soon after her trial, sits alongside the
page of Cary's book that recreates that
moment. Harris said she hoped the
displays would familiarize people with
primary source documents and give
them an understanding of the role of
interpretation in historical literature.
The display also illustrates
Swarthmore's ties to the abolition
movement. One area shows the role of
the Institute for pqlored Youth in acclimating freed slaves like Johnson. The
display contains records showing lectures for the Institute given by Edward
Parrish of Parrish Hall fame. Another
case has a photograph of the
Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery
Society. Lucretia Mott, its best known
member, was a founder of Swarthmore.
The display will remain until April 14.

A McCabe Library exhibit documents abolition and Philadelphia in 1855, the backdrop of Lorene Cary's "The Price of a Child." Several
classes and groups on campus are reading the book.

College reads 'The Price of a Child' for regional program
BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore. edu

What makes a book worth reading: its impact on society or its historical and literary value? "The Price of a Child" by Lorene Cary may
raise these issues. The city of Philadelphia chose this book for its
"One Book, One Philadelphia" program that began February 7.
Swarthmore followed suit, encouraging people on campus and in the
surrounding community to read the book. Professors even assigned
the book to some of their classes, though not all of them found the
book to have much literary value.
History professor Allison Dorsey, who assigned the book to two of
her classes, admitted that she was "not a fan."
"I was neither excited with the prose of the book or necessarily by
the presentation ofAfrican-American history in the book," she said.
Philadelphia mayor John F. Street said he hoped the "One Book,
One Philadelphia" project would spur "a renewed interest in reading
and the power of the written word among all of our citizens, and especially among our high school and college level students," according to
a press release from the Free Library of Philadelphia.
"The Price of a Child" was selected "because of its emotional
account of slavery and the Underground Railroad and because of its
Philadelphia connection. The novel tells the plight of a young female
slave who is confronted with the agonizing decision of choosing freedom at the cost of losing her youngest child," according to the press
release.
Besides wanting to connect her students to the Philadelphia initiative, Dorsey said she thought the text had some redeeming qualities and had proven to be a useful teaching tool. "Sometimes the most
effective teaching tool is something I don't like, because it gives me

something to work against," Dorsey said.
Dorsey used the book to illustrate of how fiction writers use history in a way that is different from the way historians use it, and she
pointed out the book's historical inaccuracies to her classes. She was
not happy with the book's portrayal of freed blacks in the North, but
this prompted a class discussion about skewed censuses that listed a
disproportionate number of freed blacks as disabled or insane. The

book maintained these inaccuracies, which Dorsey thought was
unfortunate, but an interesting conversation starter.
Emily Remus 'O6, a student of Dorsey's, said many of her classmates found the book to be lacking both in literary and historical
value. "As a history student familiar with the constructs of slavery, I

was able to recognize historical inaccuracies that normal readers
would be unable to identify," Remus said. "Many readers will be getting a distorted view of freed blacks, historical societies and so on."
Remus was also unimpressed with the writing. "I didn't enjoy the
book for its literary content, either. I found the book contrived and
some of the characters one-dimensional," she said.
While some find the novel's inherent value doubtful, English professor Peter Schmidt saw in the program, 'a good opportunity for students, staffand faculty to get together in different ways than they normally would."
Thousands of copies have been distributed throughout the
Philadelphia area to readers ofall ages. Many citizens of the borough
of Swarthmore have read the book enthusiastically. At the college,
Schmidt has encouraged staff members to read the book and start discussion groups and convinced Human Resources and the English
department to pay for the books.
Schmidt proposed that the nine students in his black studies seminar meet with some of the groups and facilitate discussion. This has
yet to take place, despite staffs enthusiasm for the idea. The students
have been busy, according to Schmidt, and "crunch time might cut
things a little shorter and make things not as perfect as we'd like."
Dennis Archey, who works in the development office, described the
book being "offered on campus as a vehicle to open the doors of dia-

logue."
In an effort to make up for the lack of discussion groups being
organized, McCabe Library offered a tour of its historical display
about the book and its era last Friday (see sidebar). Six people came,
but there was not much discussion of the novel. Myrt Westphal
attended and expressed her regret that there weren't more students
involved. She has enjoyed the book and the idea that "everyone
around me is reading it," but said it would have been nice for each discussion group to have a student member.

SEPTA plans to raise fares, reduce service, eliminate airport line
BY AMANADA BROWN-INZ
abrownil@swarthmore.edu

Facing a $55 million budget deficit in 2004, the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
announced April 1 that it is considering several measures
to save money, includingfare increases, layoffs, reductions
in service, and eliminating several lines.
The 2004 fiscal year state budget decreased state subsidies to SEPTA by $l5 million, exacerbating an already
pressured budget, Moore said. Half of SEPTA's operating

budget comes from these state subsidies, which only
increased in two of the past eight years.
The total 2004 fiscal year budget for SEPTA is $BBB million, a $42 million increase over last year. While SEPTA
officials said they would prefer additional state subsidies,
a poor economy has made this unlikely.
SEPTA plans to reduce service for urban and suburban
bus lines, discontinue the R6 Cynwyd, Rl Airport, R2
Warminster and R8 Chestnut Hill West lines, and close stations at Lamokin, Angora, Eddystone, Rydal, Delaware
Valley College, Linkbelt, Eddington, Wister and
April 10, 2003

Wissinoming. This is meant to

save a reported $25 million.

A plan to reduce expenses by $l5 million includes cutting
labor, material and services, and budget overruns due to
unforeseen circumstances. Fares will be increase by 5.5 percent, adding 10 cents to token and transfer prices. Some
weekly and monthly fares along with parking fees will also

increase. This will save $l5 million, and SEPTA officials say
ridership will decrease by L 5 percent.
There will be public hearings regarding this announcement May 12 to 19, and board approval will take place on
June 6.

Sharon

Pierce's day starts at 4 a.m., when she
begins work at Parrish Hall. By the time her
shift is over eight hours later, she has
cleaned the hallways and bathrooms of the
president's hall and Parrish North.
But she looks forward to Tuesday mornings, when
she gets to go live on the air as co-host of WSRN's
show "From Chester to Manhattan."
Pierce, an environmental services worker, and
her co-host Katie Davenport 'O5 draw both students

and stafflisteners for an hour and a half every week
beginning at 8 a.m.
The two are part of Swarthmore's Learning for
Life program, which pairs a staffmember with a student in a project of their choice. Partners meet once
or twice every week. Some are learning HTML, others are writing poetry and one group is working to
get learning permits for both staff and student,
according to the organization's Web site. While
Learning for Life is required for education professor
Diane Anderson's Literacies and Social Identities
course, any student may participate.
Pierce and Davenport, who are from Chester and
New York City, paired up in October. When their first
project of filming students at Swarthmore failed,
Davenport, who had a radio show, asked Pierce to
join her as a host.
Inside the cluttered WSRN studio, Davenport and
Pierce who is still wearing her purple work scrubs
and staff ID
share stories of their weekends and
lives with each other like old friends.

THE PHOENIX

"My favorite thing is Sharon," Davenport said of

her Learning for Life experience. "I feel it gives me a
chance to make friends with someone I probably
would have never met or become friends with otherwise."
Although doing the show means having to work
harder to get her work done on time, Pierce said that
she nonetheless enjoys every moment of Learning for
Life and being on the air.
"It's important because it makes you not feel bad
or guilty about the stuff you want to do. It makes you
look forward to come to work and be with someone
and getting to be yourself just for a moment," she
said.
The show enjoys a large audience of the college
staff, who call in to give shout-outs to one another
and joke with the hosts.
"We have a lot more callers than I've ever had. I
think Sharon galvanizes a lot of people to listen,"
Davenport said. In one session, callers included
Pierce's sister, daughter and former supervisor.
"From Chester to Manhattan" is one of the college's two staff-hosted radio shows. Lillian Ray 'O5
and her Learning for Life partner Kenny Whye are
on the air Thursday mornings with "Learning for
Life Radio."
Last Tuesday morning, the campus a cappella
group Essence of Soul performed live on "From
Chester to Manhattan." As Davenport and Pierce
introduced the group, Don Bankston was busy taking
photographs for Learning for Life's Web site, which
April 10, 2003

he maintains with his partner, Myra Vallianos 'O5.
Bankston, the organization's staff coordinator,
has been part of Learning for Life since it began in
1998. "I'd do anything for Learning for Life. It's given
me a lot of knowledge for what I want to learn," he
said, adding that the program has changed the student and staff relationship. Whereas the earlier mentality for the environmental services staff was often
"getting it clean and getting out of the way,"
Bankston said that now students and staff interact
and greet each other.
"When a student says hi," Vallianos said of the
staff, "it brightens their day in a way that makes
them feel appreciated."
Davenport and Pierce emphasize that their relationship is not one of teacher-studentand that they
learn from each other and the project they are doing
together.

"Some of the stuff is hard to do by yourself,"
Pierce said. Since the show started in January, she
has learned how to work with the computer and
sound equipment.
Davenport admitted that she and Pierce are still
trying to figure out how to work the record player.
Until that happens, they can only play the first song
on each record.
After the pair played the last song and said goodbye to the last caller, Davenport signed off, reminding
listeners that the show was a student-staff creation:

Conference draws 'paradigm busters'
BY SUE CHEN AND CYNTHIA WU
schenl@swarthmore.edu and xwu2@swarthmore.edu

At the fourth annual Jonathan R. Lax '7l Conference
on Entrepreneurship, Marc Reinganum described entrepreneurship as "almost the antithesis of a discipline."
About 150 alumni and students attended the keynote

speech, "Can Entrepreneurship Be Taught?" on April 6.
Reinganum, vice president at Oppenheimer Funds, Inc.,
and the chair of financial investments at Southern
Methodist University, said that while traditional fields
such as finance seek to teach profit maximization and
risk minimization to prepare students for work in economic bureaucracies, entrepreneurs are "paradigm
busters" who "think different ways of making changes no
one has thought of before."
A successful entrepreneur, Reinganum said, needs to

"Entrepreneurship is like birth. It's
ultimately something one does alone
entrepreneurship is self-taught."
Marc Reinganum, Lax
Confrence panelist
...

have not only technical competence but also creativity.
One "can't teach what a good idea is," he said.

"Entrepreneurship is like birth. It's ultimately something one does alone. Skills can be taught. Experience
can be shared, but entrepreneurship is self-taught,"
Reinganum said.
After the keynote address, attendees had the chance
to choose between two concurrent panel discussions led
by alumni. Engineering professor Bruce Maxwell '9l led
the first panel discussion, entitled "On the Technological
Horizon: Intertwining Intellectual Property, Finance and
Technology." At the biotechnology panel, moderated by
biology professor Amy Cheng Vollmer, alumni panelists
talked about the social and political impacts of biotech-

nological entrepreneurship and offered advice to potential entrepreneurs on issues such as sources of funding
and how to gain experience.

The conference closed with a roundtable discussion
entitled "Ethical Conduct versus Profit Maximization: A
Dilemma for Corporate Governance?" Panelists for this
discussion included Linda Ambrus Broenniman '77,
director of HFS Capital, Samuel Hayes 111 '57, the Jacob
Schiff Professor Emeritus of Harvard Business School,
and Alan Gershenfeld 'B4, the co-founder and co-chief
executive officer at Netomat.

Andrew Steel Phoenix Staff

Guests at the Lax Conference, including the students responsible for introducing the Qub cafe to campus this year,
present their business plans during a poster session Saturday.
During the discussion, panelists shared stories about
the ethical dilemmas they have faced in the past and

commented on the current state of ethics in business.

Gershenfeld, who used to be the senior vice president of
Activision Studios, related how he left the company after
finding that he had to "make decisions of which [he does
not] believe in."
Hayes noted that, to some extent, business schools are
responsible for producing ethical entrepreneurs. "If
someone comes into business school at 27 years of age
with no moral compass, I don't think it is possible for us
to instill one in him," Hayes said. "However, if this person does have a basic moral compass, it is our duty to
teach him or her how to make ethical business decisions

in the future."
"Ethical dilemmas are really a part of business life,
especially when you hold responsibility to more than one

group," Broenniman concluded. "... Ultimately, however,
you're in control of your own ethics."
The conference was followed by a reception, where
participants viewed student posters of entrepreneurial
ideas.
Students and recent alumni also had the chance to
attend a primer titled "Business Plans, Getting Started
with Funding, and the Lexicon of Entrepreneurship"
before the start of the conference.
"We were able to talk with many alums about our
ideas and progress, and gain from them their reflections and critiques," said Wynn Wu 'O5, one of the students who presented posters at the conference. "... I felt
that I learned a lot during the conference and gained
many valuable contacts. It was a great opportunity for
the few of us here who possess strong entrepreneurial
sprit."

Author advises seniors not to worry about life after graduation

transition from college to work. After he
graduated from college, he said, he needed
advice on how to cope with the transition.
"I decided to put down everything that I
thought you should know," he said.
Jedding feels it is his mission to help
increase students' awareness about what
to realistically expect. "This has become
my mission, because students have no
idea what is going to happen next," he
said.
In his book, Jedding said he liked to
take a holistic approach in viewing the
transition, by discussing everything from
careers to parents and relationships. In his
talk, Jedding focused on how opportunities
evolve in life, saying that students should
dispel their illusions about the future as
being static. He also told students that they

must retain their passions and keep a perspective on their larger goals, even while
in transition jobs.
Jedding said that because most students
have entry-level jobs right out of college,
they must learn not to expect their job to
provide a sense of self-worth. He told students to emulate Madonna. He has taken a
yoga class with her, and he said that
Madonna was one person who exemplified
how success develops from confidence.
While most people believe self-confidence
develops after success, it actually works in
reverse, he said.
He also stressed the importance of

developing skills in all situations. "We
shouldn't focus on the labels, such as
majors or job titles, because they don't matter too much in life. But skill sets do matter," he said, citing his wife, who first
developed sales skills working as a cashier
that now serve her as a successful art dealer. "After you graduate, you shouldn't
think that now you have to know what you
are going to do with your life. Instead, you
start somewhere with the most integrity as
you can and see where it leads. You are

preparing yourself for things you can't

even imagine yet," he said.
April

Jedding, who has made appearances on
CBS, NBC and Fox television, said that he
has been traveling across the country from
California to Texas and is planning to
speak at Cornell next week. He said, how-

ever, that while most authors use speaking
sessions to advertise their books, he just
views it as another method of communicating his message to students. "The impulse
to write the book was to communicate, and
now I get to do that more by speaking," he

said.

Ani Silwal 'O3, an economics major who
said his post-graduation plans were uncertain, said it was "good to hear a different
perspective. [Jedding] really seemed to be
focused on the long run, whereas here at
college we get caught up on the short
term," he said.
Ali Furman 'O3 said she came to see
what Jedding would say about making the
transition, though she already has a job
lined up. "It's a hard time. The transition
from high school doesn't compare," she
said.
Ed Stehlik 'O5 was pleasantly surprised
by Jedding's straightforward approach. "I
came because I expected something completely different and I wanted to laugh. I

10, 2003

expected it to be more like a motivational
speaker. But I got a lot out of it. He emphasized what I've been thinking all along,
that you should let life develop. It just
clicked," he said.
Career Services offers resources such
as interest inventories, career counseling
and opportunities for talking to alumni

but also feels it is important to bring in
outside experts such as Jedding, according to assistant director Jennifer
Barrington.
"Going from one lifestyle to the next is
difficult. It's the first time you have to
structure your identity for yourself, and
there are no defined parameters or operat-

ing instructions for life after graduation,"
she said.
"I had read his book. It was interesting.
I thought it had some good insights,"
Barrington said. Jedding approached
Career Services about speaking, not the
other way around. She said that he was
only reiumbursed for his travel expenses
because "he really feels that it's his mission to help."
After the talk, there was a time for questions, and Jedding sold his books to students for any amount they could pay.

Council protests

Student Council and

wrote a letter to Dean of
Student Life Tedd Goundie
protesting the deans' decision to charge the Student
Activities Committee (SAC)
for the tearing of a screen
in Upper Tarble and to
charge Olde Club for vandalisms in the building.
Student
Council Co-

President Anna Morgan 'O4
said there was no proof that
the vandalism was committed by students. The council felt Facilities or Public
Safety were responsible for
the safety of these buildings
and should have to pay for
the damages. Council members thought the deans
were taking advantage of

the fact that SAC had a surplus to charge them for the
damages. SC sent the letter

A small group gathered in Kohlberg 115 last night to hear
Vice President for Facilities and Planning Larry Schall 75 give
a talk entitled "The Changing Meaning of Swarthmore." Schall
presented his recent doctoral dissertation on the changing mission of the college from its opening in 1869 to the present.
Swarthmore has had no single, coherent meaning, according
to Schall's thesis. The school's focus has changed dramatically
over the years, due to both gradual social change and visionary
leadership. Former Provost James England characterized
Swarthmore as "an endless good argument," and argument
proved to be a constant feature of the college's management.
Particularly illuminating was information about the college's dismal record on racial diversity, with a Jewish quota of
12 percent persisting into the 1950s and no black students admitted until World War 11, when naval officers-in-training, including some black students, attended Swarthmore in large numbers. Schall also cited arguments between alumni and administration over athletic funding from the 1900s that reminded some
of the 2000 athletic cuts.
On a more lighthearted note was a reference to the curfew
regulations on female students to protect their virtue, persisting
until 1963. Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 said, "We had our
ways of getting around them."

Public Safety Report
Friday morning at 2:15 a.m., three students,
two of them RAs, were found in a conversation

room on the fourth floor of McCabe. They fed
Public Safety a cockamamie story about having
fallen asleep before being escorted off the
premises.

We'd been bouncing the idea of a McCabe sleepover off each other for weeks, but we never actually
thought it would happen. On that fateful Thursday
night, however, I checked my e-mail in time to
receive this:

We decided to set up camp on the fourth floor on
the off chance that the video viewing room would
work after power was shut off. We knew that Public
Safety had hidden motion sensors throughout
McCabe, so we sent out scouts (Lauren, Kat, myself)
to see if we could find them. We narrowed it down to
either:
a. the plentiful sprinkler-shaped thingamajigs
made by fire safety company Simplex, or
b. the complicated doohickey in the northeast
corner that blinked red when we moved.
Kat and Lauren eventually convinced me that it
was probably the latter.
We assumed the diligent McCabe staff would
thoroughly search every floor for stowaways, so we
huddled up in the corner of a conversation room and
decided to stay silent and motionless for 15 minutes

Student survival guide to parents' weekend
We aren't afraid of spiders. We aren't afraid of clowns.
We aren't even afraid of Osama, but when it comes to parents' weekend, we can't stop from quaking in our boots.
Our mothers are perhaps the two most terrifying creatures
to grace the earth, except for Lobo. In traditional Sobering

trust fund.

1) Creating an atmosphere of work without working
Let's face it. You don't read, you forgot how to last year.
Unfortunately, your parents, because of your lies, think
you do, like, three million pages a, week. The key to tricking your parents into thinking you do work is creating a
work atmosphere conducive to that end. First, go to
McCabe and pick up a box full of printouts. Steal a stapler
on your way out. Mix 20-page units of scrap paper, the ink
of two or three highlighters and a few random exclamation
points (they'll think you love! learning) and voila, eight
weeks' worth of work suddenly appearing in two hours.
Spread them out around your room to give the atmosphere
of an unorganized brilliant intellectual and Earthlust will
love you. For extra vigilant mothers, apply highlighter
method to all books. If you have not purchased them yet,
steal your roommate's.
2) College is all work and no play
Vomit, beer flags, liquor, bongs, condoms, crackpipes
and hydroponics, contrary to what you may believe, are

SO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK STAR
BY AARON WASSERMAN
awasserl@swarthmore.edu
The beauty of rock 'n' roll is it's not difficult to find.

Search under any bodega on the lower east side or any
garage in suburbia and there's a high probability it will
contain drums, a guitar and an amp. The ephemeral
the
nature of rock 'n' roll is what makes it so trivial
number of bands to have an impact on culture for three
months and then disappear is nearly infinite. Yet it's also
what makes it so appealing. With three chords and a basic
sense of rhythm, a band is formed. This is what provoked
me to wander around campus for the past week searching
for the buzz that's heard the moment before a guitar is
plugged into an amp, the moment of anticipation crucial to
rock 'n' roll.
Monday night, I entered Olde Club to watch the Pirates
practice; the members are Jody Fisher 'O5 on lead vocals
and keyboards, Drew Adams 'O3 on guitar, James Zvokel
'O4 on bass and Dave Collins 'O3 on drums. Those familiar
with the band know it started as an inside joke. In an interview, they said, "Drew, James and Dave came together as
a 'Cum on Feel the Noize' and '(White Man) in
Hammersmith Palais' cover band."
Now, though, things are (somewhat) serious. The band
has four shows between April 8 to 25, one opening for
Circulatory System, and the only time they allude to "Cum
on Feel the Noize" is when James jokingly plays the bass

line in between their own songs. During practice, the band
admits the atmosphere is unusually tense, which Drew
attributes to the "solemnity of the fast-approaching
shows."
Jody is the band's extrovert. He repeatedly asks Dave
how he's feeling, high-fives James out of excitement and
even includes me in lyrics for an unfinished song. I try to
emphasize that I'm just there to watch.
Out of nervousness
I've never watched a band
rehearse before
I ask the group what others have done
while watching. They answer that most have been awed by
the amount of rocking. This sets another tone in the
rehearsal: lots of ironic yet somehow sincere rocking.
James always says he's ready to rock, the band remarks
how they're rocking the windows, and, when Drew lies
down to rest as Jody fixes a guitar line, he exclaims that

he's rocked Drew to death.
James plays his bass like he acts in conversation, with
a witty, sardonic style. Dave plays his drums forcefully,
but not overpoweringly, and Drew usually gently paces
around the stage, focused on playing, charmingly becoming tangled in his wires.
The songs are humble, as well, free of the egotism of
stereotypically self-indulgent "rocking." The band
describes its sound as "slow-core-esque pop/rock, like an
educated Grandaddy." Another influence is Wilco, circa
"Summerteeth," which the band explicitly confirms when
Jody and Drew begin a cover of "How to Fight Loneliness."
There are no guitar solos, as the band focuses on writing
simple bridges. To describe the songwriting process, the
band says, "Drew shows up with two chords. Dave adds
ffat [sic] beats* Jody adds an actually decent part and
James pretends to know what's going on." It seems a
self-deprecating joke in print but appears to actually

10

Most importantly, the material sounds amazing. I
would listen to this on my own time even if I didn't know
the band members and the songs had to exist on their own
merit. The simplicity is successful, and, when a song
comes too close to being repetitive, there's a well-placed

chord change. For all the joking, it's clear the Pirates rock
because they are dedicated to the craft ofrock 'n' roll. They
have about a dozen song fragments, including
"Fingerpicking," penned by James, and about eight songs
ready for the listening public, the best of which are
"Spacepad" and "Scrooge."
The Collar-Ups, another Swarthmore band, haven't progressed this far yet musically, but they already look like
rock stars ready for the cover of "Rolling Stone." The
group is composed of Joe Makin 'O3 on guitar and lead
vocals, Adam Hunt 'O6 on guitar, James Golden 'O5 on guitar, Lang Reynolds 'O5 on bass and Jones Nauseef 'O6 on
drums. As I watch them practice, I can't help but think
how good-looking they all are, from Jones's cascading
curls to James's wonderfulbone structure.
This isn't meant to suggest they're a "boy band,"
though. With three guitars, they have a much fuller sound
than the Pirates, and Joe's vocals are much more aggressive than that of Jody 45 minutes after rehearsal started, Joe is checking for blood in his throat. His vocal
approach embodies his role in the band; Joe is clearly the
leader. He assigns parts, suggests how to rework guitar
lines and gives the rehearsal direction, but when he thinks
he's too controlling, he pulls back, uttering, "Whatever, I
don't fucking care."
During rehearsal, the band runs through a series of
covers that the Pirates would never think of trying:
"Time Trap," by Built to Spill, "NYC Cops," by the
Strokes, and "In the Meantime," by Spacehog. Whereas
the Pirates presented many more finished products, the
Collar-Ups are revealing a lot more of the process, taking
time to stop and continuously go over individual parts
and their band chemistry. When it all comes together,
though, it's fantastic.
The whole group is committed and congratulatory, but
they all realize they don't have a full set of their own material yet and as a result maintain a sense of humility. When
asked how the group formed, they comment, "We
applied early last summer to Darryl Smaw. He
gave us a grant in an effort to encourage
greater diversity in bands, and we've been
working closely with the administration to
that noble end ever since." The Collar-Ups
are still in the process, but the learning
curve is steeper than a mountainside.
The best part is there's more. Walk past
Olde Club on a weekday night and there's a
good chance a band's rehearsal will be
releasing noise onto the western side of
campus. Inflight Rock Band

there's the sense that it's more serious than even they may

The Swarthmore College
Bookstore is, by far, the most

fun place to hang out on
campus, at least at 1 p.m. on a

Friday afternoon.

Where else can you listen to Steve's
music collection of blues, Cajun and
Irish CDs? Or enjoy, and attempt to
not become the butt of, Tom and
Charlie's perpetual banter? Or lay all
your (probably Paces-related) sob stories on guys who are "better than bartenders at the bar" when it comes to
listening to tales of Swat trauma?
High spirits and frequent roars of
laughter are always on hand at the
bookstore, right alongside new (and
discounted!) titles, school supplies and
Mach3 razors. As Steve, Charlie and
Tom can tell you, there simply isn't a
more laid-back or friendly hangout
this side of Barnes and Noble.
Steve "Bookmeister" Levin (so
named by his coworkers, who assured
me that Steve knows the answer to
any book-related question "in 99 out of
100 cases") left the University of
Pennsylvania bookstore after it was
taken over by B&N about six years
ago. "I did not want to work for a corporation like them," he explained.
Steve is much happier with his current position ordering text and trade
books. "This is probably the first job
that I enjoy coming to," he said.
For both Tom Ermel and Charlie
Stasiunas, retired from the helicopter

division of Boeing and from PECO
the

Energy, respectively, working at

bookstore is a satisfying way to stay
busy and see their spouses. Tom and
Charlie, who have been friends for 30
years, both came to the Swarthmore
bookstore at the suggestion of their

wives.

Tom, here since 1995, was the first
of the friends to come to the bookstore.
He is married to a Worth Health
Center worker and is quite content
with his part-time pastime, which consists primarily of running the cash
register, lending Charlie a hand and
reading Stephen King (when Steve
hasn't hidden his books). "I have a ball
with the kids," Tom said of his typically high-humored interactions with
Swarthmore students.

"I HAVE TO LAUGH
AT OTHERS WHO
COMPLAIN ABOUT
HAVING TO WORK."
Charlie, who grudgingly allowed

his three-decade friendship with Tom
to go on record, has worked at the
bookstore for a little over two years. In
addition to occasional cash register
duty, Charlie checks orders, shelves
books, sends returns to publishers and
"listens to the woes of students, with

empathy."
"I work here full-time to supplement my pension so that I can maintain my millionaire status, the
lifestyle to which I am accustomed,"
Charlie jokingly explained. (Was I the
only gullible first-year who was told
that the bookstore guys are philanthropic millionaires

who donate their

time for the heck of it?)
All three interviewees repeatedly
emphasized, however, that the primary reason they work at the college
bookstore is that it's fun. These guys

"have no complaints." They just want
to have a good time and make the students happy.
One way the bookstore workers
try to keep customers satisfied is
through ordering. Steve regularly
reads book reviews, bestseller lists
and Web ratings to see what's most
interesting for staff and students.
When I complimented him on his
selections, commenting regretfully at
the cost of tempting new hardcovers,
Steve acknowledged the difficulty of
running a general bookstore on a college campus. "Many students say the
same thing: They don't have the
money," he said, "or the time, since
they have so much to read already."
Charlie and Tom put a whiteboard

in their manager’s office to keep lists
of “health and beauty aids” and computer accessories to order. “I think
we all try to come up with students’
needs,” Charlie said.
Mostly, they try to get us stressed
Swat kids to loosen up a little. “We
try to have fun and joke around, but

we never want to hurt anyone’s feelings,” Tom said, explaining the intention of his teasing. Charlie, who also
notices the heightened stress of college life, spoke of his repartee with
customers: “What I bring across to
students is to try to be more flexible
in their views.”
These bookstore workers do seem
to be more at one with the universe
than most people on campus. “I have
to laugh at others who complain
about having to work,” Steve admitted. “Life is good.”

Thanks to a famous alum, last week's festivities proved full of curious fashion and action
BY BETH COLLINS

ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

I walked up the stairs of Olde Club behind the boy in
the fishnets and the girl in the suit, trying to avoid any
kind of contact with the in-the-buff partier stumbling up
the stairs behind me. Boys were donning their sisters'
Sunday best, girls were donning, we 11... they weren't donning, and naked partiers were stumbling up stairs across
campus Saturday night in the name of one man: Richard
Sager '73.

The party on Saturday, which some called the
Swarthmore incarnation of Sodom and Gomorrahand others the most exhilarating event of the year, served as the
culmination of a week featuring speakers, performers and
events dealing with issues pertaining to the queer community known as the Sager Symposium. But, according to
Swarthmore Queer Union (SQU) board member Powen
Shiah 'O6, many Swarthmore students didn't know why
they were supposed to be un- or cross-dressing.
"It would be great if some of the party-goers also went

12

to some of the Sager Symposium lectures and performances, which are the real reason we put together the symposium and to which the party is only ancillary," Shiah said.
In 2003, the symposium's 15th year, the Sager
Symposium's theme was "Intertwining Identities: Race,
Religion and Gender in the Queer Community." The symposium kicked off with a presentation and workshop by
Faisal Alam, founder and director of Al-Fatiha, a non-profit organization for queer Muslims, on Wednesday. The next
night, Imani Henry, a transgendered activist, writer and

known performance by Rigg, Lyris Hung and three
"Chink-o-Rama" dancers, satirized Asian stereotypes
through comedy, music and dance to a packed Upper
Tarble on Friday night. Dr. Kevin Kumashiro, the founding director of the Center for Anti-Oppressive Education,
spoke on queer Asian Americans and their place in social
change in the educational system.
"This year, basically all the events were put together by
the SQU board," Shiah said, "except for 'Kate Rigg's ChinkApril 10, 2003

o-Rama,' which was mainly arranged by the Intercultural
Center and its director Rafael Zapata. Usually, the coordination of the symposium does not fall to the SQU board,
but for a variety of reasons this year, it did."
"We found each of the speakers in a different way,"
Shiah said. "For example, Faisal Alam is someone with
whom our adviser, Derek Brown, is acquainted."
Richard Sager and the Sager Fund created and pay for
the symposium. According to the June 1998 issue of the
Swarthmore College Bulletin, Sager, a sculptor and leader
in San Diego's gay community, started the fund in 1988 to
fight discrimination and homophobia. In addition to funding the Sager Symposium, the fund sponsors events concerning the issues of the queer community and promotes
queer academic studies.
In the spirit of all things Swarthmore, the efforts of
Richard Sager and the Sager Fund could not go unnoticed.
So on Saturday night, after days of learning about gender
identities, Swarthmore students subverted them, clad in
duct tape (ouch), butterflies, loin cloths and sultry lingerie
or simply not clad at all.

Wages flawed
An examination of student wages from other college
and universities shows that Swarthmore pays its lowest
wages at a rate comparable to other institutions. However,
the highest wages are the second lowest among other
schools.
A result of this low wage level is that many students
and their employers circumvent the rules so that the students can get paid what their employers want to
them. This usually appears in the form of padding hours.
Students log in more hours than they actually worked,
and their employers knowingly approve the time slip.
This practice forces students to be dishonest. The

Student Employment Office orders them not to log extra
hours, but their employer wouldn't have it any other way.
As one student points out in the article on wages, he pads
his hours because his employer tells him to, and no one
would take the job if she had to report hours truthfully.
This practice exists at Swarthmore because of the limited three-tier pay scale, which does not allow compensation that employers and students see fit. Students should
be able to earn more for waking up early or staying up
late to lifeguard at Ware Pool or to drive the shuttle.
Furthermore, jobs that demand a higher level of skill
and responsibility, such as managing other students,
should award a higher wage. Organizations should also be
able to reward students for loyalty. Is it fair that a sevensemester veteran of ITS earns the same as a first-year
with no working experience?
Our solution is simple enough. The college should
institute a pay scale category beyond the current
Category 111 level, which pays $7.50 an hour. This new
level would ensure that those who deserve a higher wage
got it. Jobs that required more skills and commitment
would be adequately rewarded. Most importantly, this
new pay category would go a long way toward ending
time-sheet padding.

Invest responsibly
Dear Editor:

The recent death of Jack Corbett, the founder of Pax
World Funds and a pioneer of socially responsible investing, should not go unnoticed. While many liberals
attempt and largely fail to influence global and national
political systems with large futile activist campaigns,
Jack Corbett understood, much like our own Eugene
Lang '3B understands, that radical and positive social
change can come out of an American, capitalist ethos.
Social change can come from working effectively within
real economic boundaries rather than ineffectual, albeit
heartfelt, protestation.
I hope that, in light of Jack Corbett's death, those at
Swarthmore who care about social change and equity
will consider learning about his life and pursuing social-

ly responsible investing with renewed vigor.

Goldstein didn't go far enough
U.S. should liberate people of Lebanon, Gaza Strip, Qatar and Russia
Dear Editor:

I must say, I completely agree with Randy Goldstein's
remarks concerning the necessity of military intervention
in countries that endanger our freedom and democracy
("U.S. should attack Syria, April 3, pg. 16). I say, as soon as
Iraq is liberated from its regime (and with its newfound
freedom once again pumping oil into our gas tanks), we
should move our military westward and bring democracy
to the people of Syria. While we're there, why don't we liberate the people of Lebanon from their terrorist regime,
too? If we have any freedom left over, why don't we drop
the rest of it in a convenient place such as the Gaza Strip
(make sure not to hit any settlements!), before returning to
re-supply our depleted munitions of democracy in Qatar?

But wait, what about Iran? Let's liberate them from their
regime, too, just for good measure. And certainly, let's not
forget about Russia, which has supplied the Iraqis with the

same freedom-endangering military contraband as Syria,
and what's more has been threatening democracy with its
own weapons of mass destruction for over 50 years!
Hezbollah's got nothing on that! I think after that we
should bring our army home liberation sure can be tiresome, what with all these regimes. So, back to Qatar, point
the ships east and head home. As we sail by the Korean
Peninsula, don't pay any attention to those North Koreans
who are nervously polishing the caps of their ICBMs.
They're just afraid of what freedom and democracy can do.

Muslim religion not a 'sick culture'
Dear Editor:
I am a leftist. I don't agree with a
lot of things that Randy Goldstein says
in his column. I still read his column
every week because I enjoy reading
opposing opinions to mine and I
appreciate his guts for writing a clearly right-wing column in a left-wing
environment. Goldstein's columns
make me think and help me define my
own opinions. Furthermore, I believe
in free speech, and I cannot deny anyAoril 10. 2003

one that right.

However, Goldstein crossed the
line when, in last week's column, he
said that "it is a sick culture that
sends its children to kill themselves
for a hopeless cause." I am offended by
his implication that Islam is a religion
and a culture that calls on all its followers to carry out acts of violence.
One thing is a radical opinion that
only represents a small fraction of the
Islamic whole. Another is the actual

Islamic majority that does not hold
these views. What does he propose,
then, that be done to this "sick culture"? Should the United States "eradicate" or "re-educate" Islamic culture
so that it is no longer "sick"?
I do not agree with the Mufti's
statements. As a human, I find myself
offended and saddened by them. But
Goldstein's
characterization
of
Islamic culture also saddens me.

How to get into med
school and stay sane
It's four years of scheming, planning, working and
dreaming that culminates in a year-long frenzy of

high-speed travel, a series ofbrutal interrogations and
a desperate attempt to lay your hands on hundreds of
thousands of dollars of other people's money. l No, I'm
not describing a training school for professional bank

robbers; this is the life of
a pre-med.
Besides the looming
prospect of lifetime debt

and the exciting and

frightening idea of being

you've ever shared these anxieties, here's
a list of do's and don'ts that virtually
guarantees you'll get into med school.
L Do choose a major that gives
you an excuse to take all the pre-med

unless you really have to. It may be very fj
cool, but you're gonna say "ouch" when
your transcript rolls around
3. Do make sure that at least three professors know you well and nevertheless
like you enough to write your references.
4. Don't do a million extracurriculars.

6. Don't take the MCAT during the spring semester

something? My personal strategy was to work at a
summer camp, study on a big rock in the woods during some free times and take the MCAT at the end of
the summer after sophomore year.
7. Do save money wherever you can. That thousand you would have spent on Kaplan could pay for an
exotic vacation to your favorite med school.

Your MD/JD interviewer responds, "But that's
unconstitutional!" to any answer you give regarding
health-care policy.
You note that the following conversation
has just taken place:

Interviewer: "Why did you choose
Swarthmore for undergrad?"
You: "Well, I was actually enrolled at PSU
but came to realize that wasn't where I was sup-

posed to go."

Interviewer: "Oh, so someone wanted you
go to Swarthmore? Your parents?"
You: "Well, God told me to go there."
Interviewer: [blank stare]
I hope this advice helps you; some of it
even meant seriously. But my best real
advice about how to be a pre-med while
remaining a real person is this: "No one can
serve two masters. Either he will hate the one
and love the other, or he will be devoted to the
one and despise the other. You cannot serve
both God and [Med School]."3 I believe that

Signs repress free expression
Dear Editor:
Monday afternoon I noticed that someone had
glued a sarcastic sign over the official advertisement for the Dr. Daniel Pipes lecture. "Hear why
Muslims should kill themselves peacefully," the
sign announced, with an incorrect lecture time at

a student (I presume) had to show such little respect
not even for another person's viewpoint, but for
the possibility of hearing another person's viewpoint.
Indeed, putting these signs up next to official
announcements is one thing. Plastering them
over official announcements is much more troubling. The mere thought of even listening (or the
community listening) to someone else with a different viewpoint terrified an individual so much
that he or she had to block out this possibility, literally.
What should be done? Certainly something

around the world are marginalized. It's as if black Americans

Jim Crow segregation (as recently as 1965), don't have problem

Personal stories
distort Iraq war

op-art

by

annie

ronan

Since the advent of the war on Iraq, character sketches
of the people running it have become a media staple.
Whether they represent the latest trend in edgy journalism, a genuine effort to acquaint us with our friendly leaders or a way to creatively skirt the issue of people dying,
reporters can't wait to tell us about Colin Powell's personal decision-making tactics, Donald Rumsfeld's adorably
militant speech quirks or some random general's fighterplane sock collection.
The New York Times leads the way, as usual, with a
recent article entitled, "President keeps the battlefield
close at hand." The piece gives us a close-up of our president in wartime, celebrating the fact that Bush is actually
interested in the war on Iraq. "He is just totally
immersed," close friend Roland Betts tells us, describing
the grueling three hours of war-TV-watching that Bush
puts in per day as well as his habit of frequently bringing
up the war in conversation. Other White House sources
report that Bush has taken a
renewed interest in military
strategy and is relishing his
active role as commander-inchief.

Though the story gives one
hope that, perhaps, like an
overplayed video game, this
whole "war" thing will lose its
zest for Bush after a couple of
weeks, it indicates a disturbing trend in wartime media:
the
personalization
at
expense of global perspective,
slapping figureheads over
MAYA SCHENWAR grim realities. When we see
"military strategy" pegged as
akin
Swat Meets World Bush's latest hobby
to, say, his morning jog it's
hard to connect that picture
with bombs and blood and dying babies. When the newspapers give us war-through-the-eyes-of-our-leaders (and
our hardworking, concerned, newly-motivated leaders, at
that), it becomes almost impossible to conceive of war-asit's-actually-playing-out. "The War" in the White House
eclipses the war in Baghdad.
It's not just Bush's face that's being plastered over the
reality of war. Another Times piece features General
Richard B. Myers, the army's highest-ranking military
officer and, according to the article, a passionate, "calm,
good-natured" fellow who nevertheless realizes the importance of showing the world America's solidarity in the face
of battle. According to Myers, this solidarity means cutting off the anti-war messages of news media and retired
generals: "It is not helpful to have those kind of comments
come out when we've got troops in combat," he warns.
Thanks, Mr. Good-Natured. I'll keep that in mind next
time I slip up and exercise my freedom of speech. But the
characterization tactic works. By the end of the article, I
don't see war, I see Myers: forceful, determined, gritty as a
gravel driveway. I may not like him, but he's in my head.
We all know Saddam Evil. But now it's crucial that we
know that Bush Hardworking and Myers Tough. These
faces become our images of America at Battle.
We've already been fed "disarmament," "continuous
flow of troops into the region," and "HCD [High Collateral
albeit
Damage]." This latest media ploy is just another
more sophisticated way to euphemize war.
This isn't to say that we shouldn't be looking at real
people's faces and real people's stories about the war. The
challenge for the press would be the "real" part: depicting
the ambiguity, the frustration, the tragedy, not the bigname caricatures. The Chicago Tribune started out on the
right track with an article on a random cadet: "For Clyde
Cooper 111, a cadet at Chicago's Carver Military Academy
High School who is considering a career in the Air Force,
the jarring images of firefights and captured American

soldiers have been on his mind every day." Of course, the
story careened into a patriotic push for ROTC, but people
like Clyde are the ones we ought to be hearing about.
These are not the people making the decisions, but the
ones that are affected by them, often tragically.
A glimpse of the war according to Clyde, or a nurse in

Manipulation no easy task
The Sims is a very popular computer game in which
you control a suburban family and try to bring happiness
to its artificial life. I had a copy of it freshman year, and
due to the way that my brain works, I thought it would be
fun to make a Sim cult. I created a highly charismatic
leader called the Allfather, a bunch of weak-willed followers and a big dormitory for them all to live in. Sadly,
the experiment was a failure. One cultist had to be
placed in a special punishment hut for showing insufficient love to the Allfather,
grease fires kept breaking
out in the communal
kitchen and my fiendish
plan to imprison and brainwash the neighbors failed
when I ran out of money
before the dungeon facilities
had been completed. The
moral of this story, at least
as I interpret it, is that
DAVID HAENDLER manipulating people is a
surprisingly difficult thing
TwoFisted Punditry to do. No matter how much
power you have, chaos has a
way of slipping through.
That's not a popular moral. People like to believe that
power is pervasive and infallible. We like to think that
somebody, or at least some force, is in charge of it all, and
we don't feel comfortable unless we can find some sort of
recognizable order in the midst of all the sound and fury
of life. Suffering is considerably more tolerable when
you've got someone or something to blame for it.
In ye olde times, the devil served that purpose. Old
Scratch could be blamed for everything from war to natural disasters to peasant children breaking wind in
church, and there was no way to disprove his sinister
influence. Nowadays, we're too sophisticated to believe
April 10, 2003

that a little red guy with a goatee and pitchfork manipulates our lives, so we've been forced to come up with a
wide array of new explanations for why things are the
way they are. To put it in a nutshell, the left fears that evil
corporations are controlling our government from smoke-

filled rooms and poisoning our minds with an insidious
consumer culture that is nigh impossible to resist. The
right fears that evil liberals are controlling our society
via the media and poisoning our minds with an insidious
moral relativism that is nigh impossible to resist.
We all have a good laugh when some crazypants covers his walls with tinfoil to ward off alien mind-control
rays, but that sort of behavior is only the most extreme
manifestation of a very common way of thinking. When
one credits some powerful entity or organization with
the ability to unilaterally control society from behind the
scenes, the world's endless complexity is reduced to a
tidy cause-and-effect relationship. Nothing could be simpler or more emotionally satisfying. The nutjob who
thinks that the U.S. government exists solely to please
extraterrestrial overlords and the dissident who thinks
that the U.S. government exists solely to please oil companies are two sides of the same coin, except that the former has somewhat better evidence on behalf of his theory. Come on, folks. You've got to admit that mountain
range on Mars looks an awful lot like a face.
I'm not saying that conspiratorial thinking is necessarily wrong. Heck, maybe greedy corporations, corrupt
media elites or monsters from outer space really do control everything. I'm certainly not saying that I don't
indulge in conspiratorial thinking occasionally or that
I've got any superior alternatives to it. And it's not as if
a biweekly column is going to overturn an ancient tradition based in some of the most fundamental human
needs. Still, it's worth considering the next time you hear
some windbag, be he liberal, conservative or other, railing about the covert manipulation of our society.

Who eyer heard of snow in April anyway?
Despite this week's cold weather, the Garnet
women fired up their intensity and geared
themselves up for an away matchup against

conference rival Dickinson last Saturday.
However, they lost this heartbreaker to the
Red Devils, falling one goal short of a tied
game with a final score of 9-8. The loss drops
the Tide to 3-6 overall and 0-4 in the conference.
"I was very proud of the team, because they
played hard the entire game. They put 100 percent out there and played hard until the last
second," head coach Karen Borbee said after
the Dickinson game.
First-year Heidi Fieselmann dominated the
Garnet offense, scoring four goals by the end of
the day. Dickinson held a 2-0 lead before
Fieselmann scored a free position goal at 19:19,
putting the first Garnet goal on the scoreboard. The Red Devils countered with a free
position goal by Jess Ziegler just a minute
later to notch the score back up to 3-1.

Midway through the half, Swarthmore
turned up the heat as they ran off four straight
goals to take a 5-3 lead. After Meg Wood worth
'O3 found the back of the net, Jackie Kahn 'O4
added another goal just 37 seconds later to tie
the game at 3-3. Fieselmann hit back-to-back
goals just 24 seconds apart to give Swarthmore
a 5-3 lead with 5:57 left in the half. The Red
Devils fought back with a goal by Hanna
Johnson just 12 seconds later to cut the lead to
5-4.
"We pressured Dickinson well all over the
and

Unfortunately, we just did not capitalize
enough from the turnovers," Borbee said.
After the half, Dickinson came out recharged
and ready to fight. Lesley Oot and Lauren
Davis each scored a goal, only 29 seconds
apart, to give the Devils a 6-5 lead. Chloe Lewis
'O6 tied the game at six with a goal at 26:04.
Dickinson then rolled off three straight
a 9-6 lead with 11:23 remaining in

the game. Breaking the Devils' scoring streak,
Niamh Shortt 'O6 hit the back of the net with 10
minutes left in the game. Fieselmann got the
Garnet to within one goal with five minutes
remaining to close out the scoring. In goal,
Sam Uslan 'O3 aggressively denied the Devils,
making 13 stops for the Garnet.
"We want to improve every time we step

onto the field whether it's at practice or during
a game," Borbee said.
Reflecting on the loss at Dickinson, the
players felt the squad made some valuable
improvement. "We were finally seeing the lateral options versus always looking forward.
What we need to focus on now is connecting
those passes," Shortt said. In games to come,

they will work to "keep the intensity up
throughout the whole game, and not just for
the last 15 minutes of each half," she added.
"I expect that, as our team becomes more
comfortable with one another, we will improve
immensely. If we continue to learn from every
game and are focused and intense for the rest
of the season, our record will reflect that,"

Shortt said.
At this midway point in

their season, the
squad looks to the future of this season and
beyond with high hopes. "We want to be a better team at the end of the season than we were
at the beginning. I have no doubt that we will,"
Borbee said. With the development of the program over the next four years, the young
squad with nine first-years optimistically
awaits their future as "a powerful force in the

Centennial Conference," Shortt said. "What
excites us the most is that we're a young team,
and, while this year is very important, it's
only the beginning."
The Garnet downed Chestnut Hill College
16-5 Tuesday. They will face an away conference match-up against rival Bryn Mawr today
at 4:30 p.m. Looking ahead to the weekend, the
Tide are scheduled to have two away games.
On Saturday, they will travel to Muhlenburg to
play at 12 p.m. Without much rest, the squad
will challenge Stevens Institute of Technology
at 1 p.m. on Sunday for the second away match

Men's tennis extends win
streak to five games
BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu

The men's tennis team is on fire. Since returning from their spring break trip to
Japan, the Garnet are 5-0. More importantly, they have racked up three wins against
higher ranked opponents in their Atlantic South region.
Seeded seventh in the Division. 11l Atlantic South region by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association (ITA), the Tide continued to rewrite the rankings last week by defeating
fifth-ranked Rhodes College and sixth-ranked University of the South.
On April 5, Swarthmore narrowly defeated Rhodes 4-3. With only one doubles win by
the- third doubles pair of Justin Singer 'O3 and Mike Noreika 'O4, the Tide fell behind
early by losing the doubles point. To make matters worse, the Tide dropped both their
first and second singles matches to fall within one match of losing to Rhodes. However,
the self-proclaimed Bandits stole a win through the play of third through sixth singles.
Singer defeated Duncan Howell at third singles 6-4, 6-4 to breathe life back into the
Tide. Fourth through sixth seeds Zac Rodd 'O6, Ben Rae 'O4 and Brian Park 'O6 also picked
up critical wins to squeak by Rhodes College.
The next day, the Tide won again in dramatic fashion by narrowly defeating
University of the South, 4-3. This time around, the Tide won the doubles point with wins
by partners Park and Jayson Yost 'O3 at second doubles and Singer and Noreika at third
doubles. Yost also won his match at second singles, defeating Peter Barr 6-2, 6-2. Rodd
won the third point at fourth singles, and junior Ben Rae staged another comeback at
fifth singles to defeat Logan Nalley in a 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) nail-biter. "Our savior, Ben Rae, at
five singles, again pulled through in the clutch by burning off nine set points in his second set to give the Bandits the fourth point and the win," Yost said.
Rae staged a similar heroic performance two weeks ago when the Tide stole an individual and team win from Washington and Lee, ranked fourth in the region by the ITA.
By defeating the three colleges seeded above them, Swarthmore has shaken up the
ITA rankings. HopefuUy, the team is not through. On Saturday, Swat will face secondranked Mary Washington before taking on third-ranked Washington College on April 18.
Both games will be at home.
Women's team defeats Haverford and University of the South
The women's team also fared extremely well this past week, defeating Haverford 8-1
and University of the South 6-3 but losing to Rhodes College 9-0. University of the South
is the seventh-ranked team and Rhodes College is the second-ranked team in the Atlantic

South region.

The 8-1 victory against Haverford on Tuesday reasserted Swarthmore's dominance in

were down 1-2 after doubles, the girls stepped it up," Pao said.
"The past weekend, we had a big win against the University of the South, which will

"Overall it was a great weekend. Both the men's and women's tennis teams are having a great season thus far. It was nice to spend the weekend with the fellas and cheer
them on," Pao said.
With a number of wins under their belt, the Garnet are filled with excitement and
confidence. Coach Loomis, however, is wary of the upcoming schedule. "The team
should have a lot of confidence. However, we shouldn't look past our next couple of opponents. Both of them will be looking for an upset," Loomis said. "We're going to need to

Blue Jays take two from Garnet
The Garnet dropped both games of a doubleheader to Johns Hopkins over the weekend, but they gave the perennial Centennial Conference champs a run for their money
for the second year in the row.
Pitcher James Zvokel 'O4 dominated Hopkins batters through all but the final
inning of play, allowing Swarthmore to gain a 3-2 advantage before allowing a walk-off,
two-run homer in the final inning of play.
On the offensive side, Swarthmore was led by left-fielder Ryan Pannorfi 'O4, who
went 2-2 on the game.
In the second game of the doubleheader, the Garnet adopted a pitching-by-committee approach as their three usual starters were unavailable. The squad generated plenty of offense but ultimately fell 23-8.
Next up for Swarthmore is a makeup game versus Ursinus, at 4 p.m. today.

Gardner wins 1500-meter at Muhlenberg Invitational
Squad continues to prep for Penn Relays; Williams takes second in 110-meter hurdles
BY JIM DALTON

jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

With the much-anticipated Penn Relays just a few
weeks away, the Garnet outdoor track and field teams
are trying to maximize their efforts in preparation for
the big event.
Coach Peter Carroll continues to rotate racing events
for the harriers each week to create a balanced training
mix of speed and endurance that keeps practices fresh
while maintaining the needed intensity. The variety of
races has improved performances for many of the athletes, especially in their better events. At the
Muhlenberg Invitational last Saturday, April 5, the benefits of training were evident, as many of the athletes performed at a high level, despite the cold, rainy conditions.
Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 won the 1500-meter run with a
time of 4:48.97, leading the women's team at Muhlenberg.
Gardner finished ahead of harrier teammates Claire
Hoverman 'O3, who finished seventh in a personal best
time of 4:54.70, and Njideka Akunyili 'O4, who placed

THE PHOENIX

eighth in 4:55.24.
"Coach

likes to rotate the races that we run each

week, so I think that not running the 1500 for the past
couple weeks helped me to run a strong race this weekend," Gardner said. "I consider the 1500 to be my race,
since in high school I always ran the 1600.1 guess I had a
good race because the distance was comfortable and the
conditions were just right."
"I actually really prefer running in colder conditions,
so the rainy weather was a bonus, although I do think
that my time might have been better in warmer weather," Gardner said.
Krista Gigone 'O4 finished sixth in the 5000-meter run
with a time of 20:08.17, while Robin Dawson 'O6 placed
seventh in the high jump, clearing four feet, six inches.
On the men's side, James Golden 'O5 placed second in
the 1500-meter run with a time of 4:06.69, finishing ahead
of teammate Lang Reynolds 'O5, who finished 10th in
4:17.12. Hurdler Matt Williams 'O4 finished second in the
110 high hurdles in a time of 15.89 to join harriers Golden
and Reynolds in pacing the Garnet at the Muhlenberg

April 10, 2003

Invitational.
"Saturday's cold was not ideal for a track meet, and a
few of us had tight muscles, even after running a few
races," Williams said. "Second place in the 110 hurdles
was OK and most likely the result of concentrating on
only my hurdles instead of watching everyone else like I
sometimes do. I went out blazing in the 400 hurdles and
probably would have run a PR, but my hamstring tightened up badly due to the cold, so I stopped. Most of us are
trying to get back to full strength so we can throw it
down at Penn Relays in a few weeks."
J.J. Lee 'O3 finished in third place in the triple jump
with a leap of 40'09", while Kier Wachterhauser 'O4 ran
fifth in the 100-meter run in IL6 seconds and seventh in
the 200-meter run in 23.99 seconds. Paul Thibodeau 'O6
ran sixth in the 800-meter run in 2:02.88, while Rob
Melick 'O3 placed seventh in the shot put with a throw of
40'3.25".
The Garnet outdoor track and field teams will head to
Collegeville, Pa., this Sunday to compete in the Ursinus
Invitational.

Dying hard
Being a fan can be trying. Less trying if you cheer for the New York
Yankees, more trying if you root for the Boston Red Sox. Either way,
whether your team is a perennial champion or a constant also-ran, nothing pulls at the heartstrings of a devoted fan quite like a run to glory.

'

Take, for example, this year’s NCAA
basketball tournament. I have been a
Syracuse basketball fan for as long as I
can remember. My heroes growing up
were Billy Owens, Lawrence Moten,
John Wallace and other Orangemen of
yore. Orange and blue dominated my
room and wardrobe when I was younger,
and every time the ’Cuse played on television I would sit dutifully by and watch
each precious second. I developed small
rituals to go along with the games,
believing wholeheartedly that my antics

could somehow will the team to victory.
I shared partly in the glory of each victory and in the pain ofeach loss.
JOSH LOEFFLER
Very little has changed. Over the
years, my love for the team became more
Riding the Pine
rational but no less rabid. In my later
years, I no longer ran outside immediately after contests and reenacted the
highlights, but each season I sweated through close games and prayed
*xbr a high seed in the tournament. I tuned in every Selection Sunday in
order to see the bracket and the road that lay ahead for my beloved
Orange. I watched every postseason game and prayed that this was the
year, the year that the championship would finally come home to Jim
Boeheim and his boys.
And I died a little every year. Died a pretty good bit when a two-seeded ’Cuse lost to lowly number 15 Richmond. Died a little more last season when the boys brought home 20 wins only to have a late-season collapse result in the NIT. Died a lot when we lost the championship game
to Kentucky in ’96.
Sure, there were signs of greatness each year. There were game-winning buzzer beaters, runs to the Final Four, All-Americans. But, eventually, each year ended the same way: with a loss. Needless to say, this kind
of pattern wears on a person. You begin to doubt your team, question
your faith, curse the coach. But you stay the course. I stuck with
Syracuse because that is what I know. In a small way, it is who I am.
It is because Syracuse basketball defines me in some way that this
year’s tournament became a type of mission. Each game was important,
but each win brought about a new and more vital contest. Each game
brought about more hope that this would be the season when finally a
championship would be won.
I started developing strange habits. I began occupying the same seat
for each game, and I wore the same clothes to view them. I became more
intense with each round, quieter and more focused at times but also
quicker to yell at mistakes and cheer for success.
The entire journey came to a head on Monday night as the
Orangemen faced off against the Jayhawks of Kansas. I adorned myself
with my lucky Friends School sweatshirt, pair of dirty jeans, and Nike
sneakers. I worried that the change of venue (I had moved from Eran’s
apartment to Joey’s house for a barbecue) would jinx the team.
When the game began, I took my seat, jittery and excited. As the
Orange broke out to the lead, I became acutely aware of my actions. I
noticed how my posture affected scoring runs, how the contents of my
glass allowed Syracuse to box out. At one point after halftime, I switched
seats for better viewing. Kansas quickly went on a run, shrinking the
lead. I immediately returned to my previous chair.
When the final whistle blew, I felt a combination of joy and relief.
Syracuse had won; we had won. The years of waiting, questioning and
wondering had come to an end. It all made sense. I had endured those
years for this moment. We fans are able to persevere only because we
wait for that moment. We all deal with the falls in the hope that we will
climb the mountain. For those of you who have never been to the summit, let me tell you; The years of waiting are certainly worth it.

The softball squad improved to 3-12 on the season with two wins in a doubleheader versus Dickinson.

Softball wins pair

"Wins can be chalked up to a general team
effort, both physically and mentally," outfielder
Katey O'Donnell 'O3 said. On Saturday, the
women's softball team did just that by defeating
Dickinson College in a doubleheader, posting
identical scores of 5-1.
Heading into the competitions with a 1-12
record, the Garnet faced not only the challenge of
the Red Devils but also a test of their own mental
toughness. "The team had played well against
Dickinson last year, so I think a lot of us went into
the game expecting to be really competitive and to
have a good shot at winning," Myra Vallianos 'O5
said. O'Donnell agreed that the team felt this
might be a great competition. The team thought
that "we needed to go in there and do the best that

you can for the love of the game and the love of
the team," she said.
Dickinson started the game stronger than the
Garnet, scoring a run in the top of the first to put
Swarthmore in an early hole, but the garnet and
gray did not hang their heads. "I think being
down made us step it up a little and really con-

centrate on our hitting," Vallianos said, "because

we knew it could be our game if we could hold
them."
Sophomore Mary Mintel 'O5 led off the bottom
of the first with a single. Kristie LaSalle 'O6 bunted Mintel over to second, and Pam Lavallee 'O3
sent Mintel home on a single. The Garnet stole

back the momentum in the second inning, posting
three more runs to pull away from Dickinson.
