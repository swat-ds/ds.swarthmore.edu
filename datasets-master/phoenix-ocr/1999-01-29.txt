Popular SC van makes off-campus runs
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer

Already seen "There's Something About
Mary"? Don't want to watch it in DuPont
161? Tired of not shopping anywhere but
the bookstore? Just need to get away from
campus tonight?
Student Council's new weekend shuttle
service to the AMC Marple 10 movie theater and the Springfield Mall could solve
your social shortcomings. Running continuously on Friday and Saturday nights
from 6:15 p.m. to 1 a.m., the social activities van leaves from the rose garden side of
Parrish for the theater and the mall, which
closes at 9:30 p.m. Service started last
weekend with high ridership.
"We thought it would definitely benefit

the students," said Student Council Co-Chair
Jared Solomon 'Ol. On the first weekend of
the semester, 80 students rode in Van 16A
on Friday and 60 rode on Saturday, he said.
The van service, which will cost about
2000 dollars to operate this semester, is paid
for with money from the Student Activities
Fund, and Student Council will hire a coordinator to oversee the program. Student
Budget Committee Treasurer Josh Bess 'OO
said the van will cost 400 dollars for gas
and maintenance, 350 dollars for the
coordinator's salary, and 1250 dollars for
paying drivers, who will make $7.50 an
hour.
"It's a very cost-effective program," said
Solomon.
The idea developed through the fall and
Student Council approved it before semes-

ter break. Members are considering expanding the service to other locations.
Easy off-campus entertainment is especially attractive at Swarthmore, where few
students have cars, the Ville is inconsequential and SEPTA fare into Philadelphia is expensive and slow. Student Council would
love to provide shuttle service into the city
as well, but there are remaining liability issues.

"The rules that the drivers tell the passengers must be followed or the plug gets
pulled," Bess said.
But for now, students have been telling
Solomon that the off-campus shuttle is an
excellent idea.
"A lot ofpeople," he noted, "said this was

Sr. Helen Prejean speaks to Swatties

Sister Helen Prejean spoke last night in LPAC. Sister Prejean's
prominence is due chiefly to her book, "Dead Man Walking: An
Eyewitness Account of the Death Penaly in the United States."
In 1995 the book was adapted into the movie "Dead Man
Walking," starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.
by Anne Heidel
and Cayley Pendergrass
Contributing Writers
There are very few people
willing to spend time with inmates on death row. Last night
the Swarthmore community
heard from one ofthem. Sister
Helen Prejean discussed her
work against capital punishment
in the Lang Performing Arts
Center. Her highly acclaimed
book, "Dead Man Walking: An
Eyewitness Account of the
Death Penalty in the United
States," demonstrates a personal
and spiritual involvement with
those sentenced to death.

Adapted into a 1995 movie starring Susan Sarandon and Sean
Penn, Sister Helen's message
reached millions of Americans.
This message is very simple:
killing is always wrong. To follow Christ's example is to forgive, not seek vengeance. Sister Helen serves as a religious
advisor to those condemned to
die, to the families of murder
victims, and to the families of
those executed. While Sister
Helen acknowledges that the
inmates she befriended deserve
life in prison, she also cherishes
the human being she discovered
in each of them. It was never
an easy search. Prison visits

took her away from the children
she taught and cared for in the
New Orleans housing project
where she lives. She struggled
to convince critics that she was
not defending killers, but healing disturbed individuals
through forgiveness and love.
Sister Helen's activism began
with her religious order and
community in Louisiana, organizing support groups, protests,
and a legal office for death penalty appeals. She moved on to
chair the National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty for
three years and recently addressed the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights
in Geneva. All of her efforts aim
to transform the death penalty
from an abstract procedure to a
human experience. By discussing her experiences with death
row inmates and presenting
them with the humanity and dignity she recognizes in them, she
believes the American people
will perceive the death penalty
as a measure aimed against
people rather than against abstract threats to society. This
more personal understanding,
she feels, will move society
away from capital punishment.
Sister Helen Prejean believes
that America, a nation with
strong religious and democratic
traditions, will abolish the death
penalty when confronted with
the reality of its practice.
The Pennsylvania Abolitionists United Against the Death
Penalty hope that Sister Helen's
appearance will raise awareness
about capital punishment in our
area. Pennsylvania's death row
is 222 people—and growing.
Philadelphia District Attorney
Lynne Abraham now seeks the
death penalty in every applicable case. Our state leads the
movement to accelerate the
death penalty process, arousing
criticism by Amnesty International and a call for a moratorium on executions by the Philadelphia Bar Association. A recent report published by the
Death Penalty Information Center cites Philadelphia as a case
study in racial discrimination in
death sentencing: black defendants in Philadelphia are 3.9
times more likely to receive the

death penalty than a similar
white defendant. The death penalty also discriminates based on
socio-economic class: Pennsylvania has no restrictions on executing the mentally retarded
and virtually no one on death
row could afford their own lawyer. People attending the lecture were encouraged to sign a
petition supporting a moratorium on executions until such
issues were investigated and
addressed by the justice system.
The death penalty allows the
state to kill certain people in the
name of justice. Who survives
the sentencing process depends
very much on who you are.
With our tax dollars, we condemn the weakest to the greatest punishment. For Sister
Helen, an execution is the opposite of a baptism: we destroy
those we have judged not to belong to us anymore.
Although Sister Helen's experiences stem from her commitment to the church, her talk refrained from preaching an end
to the death sentance solely
from a religious vantage. She
honestly addressed the issue
from all sides; her work has consisted of interactions with the
inmates, their families, the victims families, and execution
workers. Her perspective is fueled from these relationships
and her (perhaps religiously
based) respect for human life.
Because of the spectrum of her
interactions, she clearly understands the arguments in favor of
the death penalty, and refrains
from extremist attacks on the
beliefs of advocates. Instead,
she pushes the education of the
public about all ofthe issues involved and an end to the extremely isolated nature of executions from the rest of society. Overall, Sister Helen
proved a eloquent and entertaining speaker, despite repeated
plugs for her book, which was
available in the lobby. The lecture effectively accomplished
what Sister Helen spoke of as
her goal- not necessarily changing people minds, but raising
awareness and pushing each individual to seriously consider
the question of capital punishment in our country.

Zoe Whitley 'Ol updated Council on the C.E.P's efforts to
reform graduation requirements. The proposal Whitley
outlined abolished PDCs (Primary Distribution Courses) and
concentrated requirements in two areas: Writing Intensive
Courses (W.I.C.s) and Quantitative Intensive Courses
(Q.I.C.s). Whitley said that the new requirements are designed to create a stronger sense of academic support,
maintain a strong emphasis on writing and preserve the
balance between the sciences and the humanities.
These requirements are not finalized and have not yet been
approved by the C.E.P., Whitley said.
5) Multicultural Dean

Polinsky informed Council members about progress on the
possible new position of a Multicultural Dean. Student
Council has established a working group to contact student
organizations that might be affected by or involved with this
position. The dean would be a resource for students and
groups to use in planning multicultural events including
diversity workshops and similar activities.
6) SC Collection

Council discussed the upcoming Student Council collection,
a week from today from l-2p.m. on February 5. They
submitted the following letter to The Phoenix:
On Friday Feb sth from l-2pm, Student Council will be
holding a collection. We will present our goals, roles on
campus, and hear any concerns or questions you may have.
In the past, students have commented that they never know
who their Student Council is or what they plan to accomplish. At this collection, Student Council memebers will
elaborate on their specific role on campus. Bob Gross and
Maurice Eldridge will provide some comments regarding the
interaction of Student Council with administration and the
possibilities future of this relationship. We would like to be a
body that acts on student grievances and positively implements student ideas into successful proposals and programs.
The only way we can be your advocate is if we hear your
voice, so please join us at the collection on February sth.
Your Co-chairs,
Cathy and Jared
7) Miscellaneous SC Announcements

-On February 17 at Bp.m. in the Kohlberg Coffee Bar SC will
host a fireside chat with the Deans. On March 24th there will
be a fireside chat with Robin Mamlet, Dean of Admissions,
at the same time and place.
-Student Council's next meeting, in Parrish Parlours from 810p.m. on Monday, will focus on the SC constitution. The
subsequent week's meeting will discuss the Mutlicultural
Dean position. All Students are encouraged to attend.

Phoenix reintroduces
Editorial Board
Last year around this time-in
the February 5 issue, to be precise-we wrote an editorial explaining the function of the Editorial Board and encouraging
people to join it. On the occasion of our return after a onesemester hiatus, we would like
to reiterate the main points of
that editorial, but also note a
policy change.
The editorial board, we wrote,
contrary to popular opinion,
does not determine the editorial
content of the newspaper. It
merely provides critical commentary-in the case of The
Swarthmore Phoenix-on current campus issues and events,
with the occasional piece on a
prominent off-campus issue or
occurrence. In this sense we are
similar to most other papers.
However, we continued, the
editorial board of a well-established professional newspaper,
say, for example, The New York
Times often consists of experienced and veteran staff members "who have been instrumental in shaping the editorial
direction of the paper, and
whose views and opinions have
been shaped by the papers philosophy as well." Hence the
opinions they express are reflective of the paper's overall
ideology. In other words the
staff editorials more or less represent the official stance of the
paper.
Yet due to very practical considerations, we wrote, The
Swarthmore Phoenix has not
implemented this policy in the
past. First and foremost, the
staff turnover rate was very
high. As a result the identity of
The Phoenix has always been
in flux. When we wrote the editorial only the two editors-inchief served on the Editorial
Board.
Instead we opened up the
Board to all members of the
campus community. While perhaps this detracted from the
credibility of the paper, we felt
it was a "constructive compromise."
By encompassing a diverse
range of groups and interests,
the Editorial Board would serve
as a "barometer ofpopular opinion."
However, the ultimate goal
was always to make The Swarthmore Phoenix as professional
as possible, an integral part of
which was to be able to declare
a critical position on important
issues and be willing to take responsibility for it.
"We are nevertheless," the
disclaimer read, "working hard
towards the day when the entire operation is consistent and
self-sustaining enough that a
stable identity will fall in
place." An identity stable
enough to articulate to the campus community.
And we feel that that day has
come. One year has gone by, and
we have found that, to our delight, the same faces have stuck

the beginning of this year have
remained loyal as well. The
Swarthmore Phoenix is no
longer a halfway house. We are
certain of who we are and where
we are headed.
So from this semester onwards, the Editorial Board will
consist of the senior staff of the
paper, including the Editor-inChief, the Managing Editors and
all the section editors. The content of the editorials will be deliberated and discussed by the
entire board, but the editorials
themselves will be written by
one editor for consistency in
style. All views expressed in the
staff editorial will represent the
official stance of The Swarthmore Phoenix.

Challenges necessary A modest proposal for
to form original ideas the new millennium
by Ben Chan
Staff Writer

To preface, this article really
has no business appearing in a
newspaper, excepting the fact
that the word "millennium" appears in its title. It probably does
not deserve space in any sort of
publication, but it's here, so you
might as wellread it. Despite its
severe limitations, this article
does serve both as an ethical
question and as a public health
initiative.
So, it's sometime in the next
millennium and I'm planning to
have a child. (You, gentlereader,
could be the lucky mother.) By
this time, humankind has mastered many techniques of genetic
engineering, including cloning, of
course. The friendly neighborhood ob-gyn offers every prospective parent the option ofhaving a clone created of his child
while it is still a fetus. The clone
is to be human in every respect
except that she is engineered to
be bom brain dead. Kept alive by
various forms of life support, she
shall grow in her vegetative state
to adult size. Her purpose is to be
an organ donor for my daughter,
and perhaps for others as well.
My wife and I, having absorbed
paltry quantities of ethical intelligence during our time in college,
unhesitatingly decide that having
such a clone created is a jolly
good idea. The pregnancy proceeds without a hitch, and little
Suzy and her spare bag of organs
are borne unto this world. Eigh-

years into her growth, however, it is found that our clone's
organs are defective and unfit for
transplant, so she is slaughtered
and sent to the local soylent green
manufacturer.
Let us forget those feebleminded ethical questions of genetic engineering for a moment,
i.e. whether or not we should be
messing with that fierce fern,
Mother Nature. The point of
this thought experiment is
whether the ethical rules of engagement that apply to human
beings should apply to beings
that are human in every respect
except for their lack of consciousness. Given the long tradition that holds consciousness
as the hallmark of a spiritually
dignified creature, it is impossible to defend the inviolability
of a mindless clone with anything other than warm and fuzzy
squeamishness, which by the
way, is not a good defense.
It follows then, that there is
nothing ethically improper in
slaughtering mindless clones and
having them for dinner with a side
of fava beans and a nice chianti,
unless you are one of those poor
souls who happens to be a vegan.
In conclusion, we should immediately put an army ofbiologists to the task of creating a
mirror population of mindless
organ donors for every newborn
in the United States. We should
also get the creative geniuses
behind the Mentos ad campaign
to begin repackaging soylent
green for tomorrow's consumer.

looked for their return on investment. I found to my astonishment that its return was about
the same as the other mutual

were the best 100 mutual funds

It had even beaten the market
over the last year.
So, I went with my Swattie conscience, ignored my Swat endowment manager head and invested.
Since then, the Dow has gone up
a measly three percent while Domini Social Equity has gone up

14 percent. It also beat the S&P
500, which went up 13 percent.
These statistics say two things.
One, I have lousy timing. If I'd
invested in October, I'd be touring Europe this summer instead
of working. Two, "feel good" investment does not underperform.
Swarthmore has nothing to gain
from continuing to sponsor socially irresponsible firms.
How can I explain the success
of socially responsible firms?
Maybe they avoid law suits over
pollution, medical costs of cancer and increased crime from
hand guns. Maybe their progressive hiring schemes bring in new
ideas and innovators. Or maybe
the companies are headed by
visionaries, people who take
ideas of a better society, put their
money where their mouth is, and
make great things happen. Swarthmore should learn a lesson
from these companies.

The Big Cod
Stuff I Like

Please understand. I'm not usually
one for this "electronica," as I believe
it's called. I have purchased neither
Volume One nor Volume Two of
MTV's "Amp Compilation." My pants
have no stripe, my hair has no color,
and my diet cola lacks the requisite tab
of ecstasy.
My guess is that most electronic
music makes a lot more sense when
you're tripping off your ass. "Check it
out now, the Funk Soul Brother," probably sounds just as cool the 78th time,
as long as you've already forgotten the
77th.
And this is what makes "Narcotic
Beats" all the more remarkable. Pull it
out of the slip case and examine the

layered

bass grooves and machine gun snares,
building on the school of organic production founded by the Bay Area's DJ
Shadow and Automator. The album is

constantly evolving, building to 140
BPM jiuiglesque climaxes before dissolving into space as mellow and effortless as a Hendrix jam. I found myself bobbing my head to a steady 4/4
beat, though I could find no kick or
snare in the haze of counterpoint that
was creating it.
This aural lava lamp spits out globe
after globe of shimmering synth
gems, painting a big liquid countryside filled with grim organ-farmers
digging in the dark earth. In "2001,
A Space Odyssey," these were the
beats they saved for the hot tub,
where the astronauts could make love
far from HAL's prying eyes. Y2K
willing, I plan to save this fine album
for just such a purpose.
Granted, "Narcotic Beats" has no
soul, and was likely created with a few
thousand well-timed mouse clicks on
some post-doc's PC. But as far as the
dying genre goes, this is a brave and
listenable project, one that will up the
ante on would-be Fatboy Slims for
some time to come.

Rattle leads Philly Orchestra "Camp" showcases
Living

Performance of
"Jenufa" thrills
operagoers
by George Macros
Staff Writer

In anticipation to Janacek's
"Jenufa," the Philadelphia Orchestra, led by Simon Rattle,
opened with the "Fifth Symphony" of Jean Sibelius, a
work usually played last in an
orchestral program.
Somewhat unknown in comparison to other famous operas, a long tradition of excellence surrounds Rattle's performances of "Jenufa" with
the Birmingham Symphony
Orchestra. According to the
world renowned Rattle, he
chose to perform only the second movement of Janacek's
opera because its previous performances provoked such an
uproarious response from the
audience, that he could not
continue past the second act.
The "Fifth Symphony" of
Sibelius opened the program,
but by no means was it subordinate to the work that it
would precede. Sibelius managed to compose this piece
despite the vicissitudes of
World War 1 and the horrors
of the German bombardment
of Finland. From the first
sketches in 1912 to the final
version performed in 1919,
this piece embodies a
composer's struggle for perfection.
The first movement, Tempo
molto moderato-Allegro
moderato, begins warmly after which a dramatic section
bearing sounds of ending leads
into a series of warm, communicating intricacies filled with
childish wonder.

Poster Children

SpinArt
The independent label
SpinArt seems to be getting
into the habit of wooing
former major-label bands to
record for them.
A few months ago, they put
out something by King

for their song "Detachable Penis", and now they've got this
new album from Poster Children, who used to be on Time/
Warner's Sire label.
Spin Art's strategy seems effective. The King Missile
record was fun, and "New
World Record" is really good.
This isn't really typical indie
rock fare; it's more in the vein
of progressive heavy metal. If

Pep Squad's third album is
buzzy and pretty good. The
music is kind of all the same;
it's a little too groove-focused
(I guess it wouldn't be if .the
grooves were better).
Don't let that totally turn you
off, however. The vocalists have
great squeaky/squeezed voices
when they get aggressive, and
the confusing mix of guitar and
synthesized sounds they use in
their work produces a neat
"What was that just now? How
did they do that?" reaction.
Yreka Bakery is a noisy album, riddled with atonal
phrases, which build upon each
other to make up a more cohesive whole, a la Sonic Youth.
The music is more driving, rocking, than most of Sonic Youth's
output, though.
These things all contribute to
a relatively appealing record, but
Pep Squad isn't really doing
anything original here. The subject matter is pretty standard tormented artist/lover stuff, except
sometimes when it's tormented
Christian stuff.
There aren't any lyrics that really match the wit of the palindrome title, witty as it is, and the
music is pretty standard too, but
the album is good listening if
you've gotten tired of all your
Pixies albums and you want to
listen to more Pixies.

is more melodic than most,
more thoughtful, and at the
same time very powerful and
brisk. She must put a lot into
it; on the Quicktime live videos that come with this enhanced CD, she's drenched
with sweat.
The album is surprisingly
well produced compared to
other punk/progressive metal
recordings-very crisp, very
raw, and not full of syrup or
incomprehensible. The band's
lyrics leave a little to be desired; there are just too many
cloddish rhymes and indelicate turns ofphrase. If one can
ignore them, however, the album is a guaranteed good
time.
For more good times, the
band members, drawing on
their former lives in the computer sciences, have included
several computer goodies on

Men and women swimmers
record wins over Dickinson
by Jill Belding
Sports Editor
Having returned from their training
trip in sunny Florida, the swim team
was waterlogged throughout the first
week of classes. After some tough
competition from Johns Hopkins (W
96-104, M 78-108), both teams recovered and prevailed over Dickinson (W
122-83, M 105-81). The women also
added a victory against Bryn Mawr
(112-88).

Arbour continued to win the 50 and
100 Freestyle. Bonarou and Parmelee
again dominated the 200 IM finishing 1-2. In the 200 Butterfly, Belding
and Polinsky added another first and
third place.
Parmelee won the 200 Backstroke,
while Auerbach won the 500 Freestyle.
Bonarou and Harvey added another set
of first and third place finishes in the
200 Breaststroke. Polinksy, McCrann,
Lisa Ladewski 'O2 and Auerbach concluded the meet with a victory in the
400 Freestyle Relay.
The men were equally successful
against Dickinson. Chris Seaman '99
and Pansu finished second and third in
the 1000 Freestyle. Pansu perhaps even
attained a new event due to his strong
showing. Ryan Muldowney 'O2 and
Nik Johnson 'Ol touched in at second
and third in the 50 Freestyle. Fruh and
Denda upped the stakes adding a first
and second place swim in the 200
Freestyle.
In the 200 IM, Sherer and Seaman
split the event finishing first and third
again. Earley and Lin followed their
example grabbing first and third in the
100 Butterfly. Fruh and Josh Farber 'O2
did the same in the 100 Freestyle.
Dickson and Turzo though broke the
streak with a second and third place
finish in the 100 Backstroke.
Earley reestablished himself as distance swimmer with a victory in the
500 Freestyle, while Seaman chipped
in another third place. Denda and Fred
Gerson '99 cleaned up the day with first
and second place swims in the 100
Breaststroke.
The women bettered their record
again against Bryn Mawr. The women
succeeded in winning the 200 Medley Relay with Parmelee, AmirArjomand, Polinsky and Auerbach
showing the way. Harvey and JoDe
Hendrick 'OO finished second and
third in the 1000 Freestyle convincing the women that distance events are
for everyone. Belding and Parmelee
swept the 200 Freestyle, while Becca
Howes-Mischel 'Ol won the 50
Freestyle.
The 400 IM resulted in outstanding
swims for Auerbach, McCrann,
Rosenthal and Elisabeth Newcomb 'OO
who also finished in the top four slots.
Bonarou and Polinsky dominated the
Butterfly, while Parmelee and AmirArjomand did the same in the 100
Freestyle.
Auerbach and Polinsky also added
strong swims in the 100 Backstroke.
In the 500 Freestyle, Shari Linden '99
posted a personal college best, while
Arbour won the event. Allison Lyons
'O2 finished off the day with a quick
time in the 100 Breaststroke.
On Saturday, the Garnet face the
Gettysburg Bullets, which may be one
of their toughest meets of the year at 2

Always a strong event for Swarthmore, the 400 Medley Relay against
Johns Hopkins began a tough meet with
both the men's and women's teams finishing second. Keith Earley '99, Yasu
Denda 'O2, Ted Sherer 'Ol and Ryan
Fruh '99 swam for the Garnet men
while Alissa Parmelee 'Ol, Melissa
Amir-Arjomand 'OO, Cathy Polinsky
'99 and Jenny Harvey '99 represented
the women's team.
Despite the final outcome of the
meet, each team had outstanding
swims. On the women's side, Amy
Auerbach 'O2 dominated the distance
events, setting a new school record in
1000 Freestyle (10.55.65) while winning the event. She then added another
victory in the 500 Freestyle. Claire
Arbour 'OO also added another first in
the '2O Freestyle and second in the 100
Freestyle. In the 50 Freestyle, Sarah
Marsh 'Ol achieved an in-season best
time.
The 200 IM was also a successful
event for the Garnet women with Alice
Bonarou 'O2 touching first while
Parmelee contributed a third place. Jill
Belding '99 added another victory in
the 200 Butterfly. Parmelee finished
second in the 200 Backstroke, while
Erica Rosenthal 'OO placed third. The
400 Freestyle Relay of Auerbach,
Harvey, Arbour and Polinsky topped
off the meet with a final first place
swim.
On the men's side, Sherer and Earley
touched second and third in the 200 IM
in strong in-season times. Tsong Lin
'OO and Aymeric Pansu 'Ol added another second and third in the grueling
200 Butterfly. Fruh and Earley placed
third in the 100 Freestyle and 200
Backstroke respectively. Denda finished up the day with a victory for the
men in the 200 Breaststroke.
Against Dickinson, the team returned to their winning form.
Parmelee, Amir-Arjomand, Bonarou
and Arbour won the 400 Medley Relay while Dickson, Denda, Sherer and
Gabe Turzo 'OO accomplished the
same feat for the men.
The Swarthmore women swam
well all day with Mari McCrann 'OO
starting out the meet with a third
place and season best time in the
1000 Freestyle. Auerbach and
Harvey, in an amazing time, finished
first and third in the 200 Freestyle. p.m.

After a successful training
trip to Montreal, the Swarthmore wrestling team has continued to surprise their competition with the talent of both
their veteran wrestlers and the
team's newcomers.
After the cancellation of the
Team Challenge Tournament
and the postponement of a
dual match-up with Centenary
College, they met their first

competition of January at the
annual Swarthmore Invitational. The rest proved to benefit the Garnet as five men finished in the top 4. Ben
Gaines 'OO (157 lbs.) and
Ted Chan 'O2 (165 lbs.) both
placed second, while Adrian
Wilson '99 (141 lbs.) and
Keith McManimen 'O2 (184
lbs.) finished third and Matt
Kahn '99 (174 lbs.) took
fourth. This was one of the
best showings by Swarthmore
in the tournament's history
and placed them in a positive
position for the upcoming conference matches.
In their next four dual
matches, the Garnet posted a

2-2 record. At home, they defeated Valley Forge Military
Academy with a score of 439, and then in a quad meet at
Muhlenberg this past weekend, they came home with a
win over Johns Hopkins (463) and a loss to both
Gettysburg (26-22) and their
host (32-13).
Despite the tough conference losses, the Garnet is looking positively at the remainder
of their season, especially confident in the freshmen talent,
notably McManimen, who has
a 9-1 record on the season.
Paul Willenberg 'OO (285
lbs.) said of the success of his
younger teammates, "The
