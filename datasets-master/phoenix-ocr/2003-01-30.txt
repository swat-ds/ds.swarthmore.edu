Students nervous after Bush speech
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

Many students said war with Iraq
now seems inevitable after hearing
Bush give his State of the Union
address Tuesday night.
"It sounded like the beginning of
a declaration of war," Nathan Shupe
'O5 said.
Bush made his argument for U.S.
opposition to Iraq based on Iraq's
continued pursuit ofnuclear and biological weapons, as well as its "contempt" for U.N. requests. Bush said
that Iraq presents a "serious and
mounting threat" that "America will

not accept."
Shupe thought those were insufficient reasons for military action. "If
having nuclear weapons is a terrorist action, then the US is the biggest
terrorist in the world," he said.

Patrick Hart 'O6 said while he was
nervous about the situation with

Iraq, he thought Bush had made "the

best case possible for going in."
Katherine Stauffer 'O5 also felt
that Bush had good reasons for going
to war, particularly Iraq's failure to
disarm. "Someone needs to stand up
to Iraq and say, 'You've broken the
contract,' she said.
"

Others, however, expressed chagrin at Bush's resolve to confront
Iraq. "I had hoped until tonight that
this war wasn't going to happen, but
I no longer believe that is a possibility," Aaron Strong 'O6 said after
watching the speech with about 40
others in the CRC.
Steven Bhardwaj 'O6 said Bush
seemed to have already made up his
mind about what he

will do about

Iraq. It bothered him that Bush made

it clear that his actions would not
depend on the decisions of others.
Most listened to the address
specifically to hear whatBush had to
say about Iraq, but other policy
statements sparked interest as well.
Stauffer said she was impressed
that Bush would commit $l5 billion
over the next five years to help battle
AIDS in Africa and the Carribbean.
But Alex Black 'O3, who spent last
summer working amid the HIV epidemic in South Africa, said $l5 billion would be "too little, too late."
Nick Ward 'O5 found Bush's proposal to fund research on hydrogenpowered cars an interesting counterpoint to his foreign policy statements, since Ward thinks that U.S.
dependence on oil is at the center of
U.S. concerns in the Persian Gulf.

College prepares to submit data on foreign students
BY AMANDA BROWN-INZ

abrownil@swarthmore.edu
While designated officials at larger colleges and universities rush frantically to meet today's deadlinefor the Student
and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) compliance, at Swarthmore the system is up and ready to go.
SEVIS is the latest plan enacted by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to more effectively regulate the
flow of foreign students entering and leaving the country

using student visas, in an effort to comply with the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
(IIRIRA) of 1996, Foreign Student Adviser Gloria Evans said.
"The INS is concerned about people who come to the
country on student visas and then disappear or who overstay the time allotted by their visas," Evans said.
Through SEVIS, basic information about foreign students names, home addresses, passport numbers, dates of
school enrollment, majors and drivers' license numbers
will be entered into a "giant database" where it can be
accessed by consulates in most countries, Evans said.
Evans said that, in order to comply with today's deadline,
designated school officials must be recertified to send 1-20
forms. Foreign students need these forms to get their student
visas. Schools must also have the proper SEVIS software
running in order to meet the terms of the INS.
In an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education, the
director of the international office at Duke University,

Catherine Cotton, said that she was concerned that the INS
had not provided the SEVIS software early enough for
schools to meet the INS's technical requirements. The article reported that, if a college fails to make the deadline, it
will lose its authorization to issue 1-20 forms and approve
other related paperwork until it makes the necessary adjust-

ments.
An article in the Times-Union discussed the rush by the
State University of New York (SUNY), whose campuses have
large foreign student populations, to install and set up the
SEVIS software so that their foreign students would not be
deported.
At Swarthmore, which has a much smaller foreign student population, preparing for the deadline was not as difficult. Evans, Registrar Martin Warner, and Dean of the
College Bob Gross '62, who serve as Swarthmore's designat-

ed school officials, were recertified and installed the SEVIS
software last summer so they would have time to focus on

THE PHOENIX

learning the system during the school year.
Their current focus is re-entering the information on the
1-20 forms of all foreign students currently attending
Swarthmore, which they must complete hy August L
Officials can enter the information on these forms using the
SEVIS software, or through a Web site.
The new 1-20 form requires certain additional information about the students: the amount of money they are paying to attend Swarthmore, how they are paying and when
they enrolled. The new form also features a bar code.
In addition to inputting information about foreign students into a database, designated school officials are now
responsible for reporting a student's failure to enroll once
they receive the student visa. Before SEVIS, this was not the
school's responsibility.
Incidents of foreign students failing to enroll "happen a
lot at other schools," but at Swarthmore, Evans said, it has

never been an issue.
Officials must also make a report if a student's status
drops below full-time or if the student changes his or her
field of study, address or name according to a fact sheet
released by INS. Failure to comply with any of these can

result in deportation.
"The government is very curious about part-time students," Warner said. "They want to know what the student
is doing with the extra time." Again, this is not a concern at
Swarthmore, where students are enrolled full-time.
So far, the new system has proved to be slightly confusing

to Swarthmore officials.
"We are all still struggling at it," Evans said. "But if we
can get straight what we're supposed to do, we won't have
any problems."

The INS's new requirements for certain foreign students
do not stop with the SEVIS database, according to Evans.
Students from 26 countries, which include Iran, Iraq,
Afghanistan and North Korea, have been under additional
watch. The most recent additions to this list are Bangladesh,
Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait and Indonesia.
Since the fall of 2002, Evans said, students from these
countries have been asked to report to the INS, where officials photograph, fingerprint and interview them. Evans
predicted that eventually all foreign students will undergo
this type of inquiry.
Although no Swarthmore student has had to report yet,
Evans said that colleagues at Temple University reported it
was "time consuming, but not too bad." She said students
January 30, 2003

were asked to bring their passports and visas.
Evans said that she feels certain that Swarthmore students have "nothing to hide," that they are law-abiding and
so will not have the problems that other schools may have.
The INS has been permitted to "waive" the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) "to the extent
necessary to implement SEVIS," according to an INS fact
sheet.
FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment, protects
students' private information from being released, according to Warner. FERPA prevents colleges from releasing
information such as grades and police, psychiatric and

health records.

Warner, who has publicly championed FERPA, said, "I
haven't heard any cases that make me think it's important
to take a principle position against SEVIS. I don't think anyone's dignity or humanity has been questioned. It's a pain to
be fingerprinted and questioned, but it's not that different
from any ID photo or using your fingerprint to cash a check
at the bank."
The INS's actions, however, have caused some concern
for Warner. "I am worried that the country is moving in the

direction of more restrictions, more regulations and more
into a police state with less rights," Warner said.
International students' reactions to SEVIS ranged from
unawareness to extreme opposition.
Win Ling Chia 'O6, who is from Singapore, said she herself had not felt any consequences of the INS's newest programs. So did a student from Trinidad, Melanie Johncilla
'O5, who has not encountered any additional difficulty entering or leaving the country since the implementation of
SEVIS.
But Shalaj Tater 'O6, an international student from Nepal,
was concerned with the changes.
"Yeah, it will be easier for the U.S. to keep track of foreign
students," Tater said, "but it makes it much more difficult
for us. It means that a lot of legitimate people will have to go
through a lot of extra formalities to get into the country."
Saed Atshan 'O6, a Palestinian student, said he believes
that the INS is stripping people of their civil liberties. "I
know people who have had to report to the INS," Atshan
said, 'and they said they were harassed and asked dehumanizing questions."

"It sends a message to Arab and Muslim students,"
Atshan said, "that you are not welcome, you are not wanted
in the United States."

Professor-student pair study adolescent stars

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY SARAH STANTON
sstantol@swarthmore.edu

Neither Professor Eric Jensen nor Rabi Whitaker 'O3
dreamed of being astronomers when they grew up. "I
thought fireman or garbage man," Jenkins said. "I didn't
even know astronomer was an option."
In college, though, they both fell in love with the opportunity to study the stars. Jensen has been studying astronomy since his undergrad days at Carleton College, while
Whitaker decided to be an astronomy major her first year
at Swarthmore during an introductory class that Jensen
taught.
For the past five years, Jensen and several Swarthmore
students, including Whitaker, have been researching
young stars, which may have the potential to form planets
around them. Much of the research done prior to Jensen's
study focused on very young stars that are approximately
a million years old. These stars are fairly easy to identify,
since they are surrounded by "discs of dust and gas raw
materials that presumably form planets (eventually)."

"The big picture of what I'm
interested in is how planets
form around stars."
Professor Eric Jensen
The downside of studying very young stars is that
many of them are too young for planets to have formed yet.
Jensen joked, "You can't exactly watch these stars for the
next 30 million years and see what happens."
In order to study developing planets, Jensen wants to
look at stars between 10 and 20 million years old, the age at

which scientists believe planets formed around our sun.
Identifying these "adolescent stars" has been Jensen and
Whitaker's most recent project.
"The big picture of what I'm interested in," Jensen said,
"is how planets form around stars. I guess the really big
picture is how much life is out there, but you have to break
that down into feasible parts."
Stars of this age, however, are difficult to find. "The visible clouds of dust and gas have disappeared," Jensen said.

Andrew Steel Phoenix Staff

Professor Eric Jensen and his team search for young stars around which planets may form.
"Nothing obvious distinguishes between these stars

and a

much older star."
Jensen and Whitaker began their research by sorting
through telescopic catalogs of stars and identifying potentially young stars by characteristics such as the amount of
x-rays each one emits.
Once the team had identified possible young stars, they
traveled to the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
(CTIO) in the Andes Mountains in Chile to make more
detailed investigations. Specifically, they made spectral
observations of each star, focusing on lithium content.

Jensen explained that the element lithium acts as a "great
indicator of young stars," since it is destroyed as stars age.
The less lithium found in a star, the older the star is.
Jensen and his team have made a total of six trips to the
CTIO, but the most recent set of observations, taken on
August 4-5, 2002, were particularly successful. Out of
their list of potential stars, Jensen and Whitaker identified

several dozen young stars.
"The fourth was my 21st birthday," Whitaker said.
"When we found our first young star at 3 or 4 in the morning, Eric said, 'Happy birthday!' It was pretty cool."
Earlier this month, Jensen and Whitaker presented
their findings at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle, and were selected to write a press release
about their research. Since then, they have been interviewed for articles in the Delaware County Times and The

Swarthmorean.
Whitaker said that it's strange to be receiving so much
attention right now, since "this [research] is the same
thing we've been doing for years." She acknowledges, however, that their recent findings are "so exciting because of
such a high success rate."
Jensen said, "There is a sense that the most exciting
part is yet to come," as theirresearch brings them one step
closer to understanding planet formation.

The Michigan undergraduate admissions
system, which is based on a 150-point scale,

white students decided to bring two separate lawsuits against it. The two cases,
Grutter vs. Bollinger and Gratz vs.
Bollinger, will come before the Supreme
Court on April L
Earlier this month, President Bush
urged the Supreme Court to strike down

Michigan's race-conscious admissions policies, calling them quota systems in disguise, according to The New York Times.
Bush did not demand unanimity from his
administration on this stance, however,
and two of his highest-ranking aides, who
are both African-American, do not entirely
share his opinions.
Condoleezza Rice, the national security
advisor, agreed with Bush that Michigan's
policy is unconstitutional, but she also
announced her willingness to support race
as a factor in achieving diversity. Secretary
of State Colin Powell disagreed more vehemently with Bush, making it clear that he

The Times.
Rafael Zapata, director of Swarthmore's

their quest for college admission. "In a perfect world, everyone would have the same
educational opportunities, everyone's parents would know how to inspire a love of
learning, every child would go to a school
that stimulated and challenged them. But
this is not a perfect world," she said. The
best thing colleges can do to remedy the situation, she said, is grant preferences to

minorities.

Affirmative action isn't
really for people of color.
It's for the better functioning of the institution.
Professor Sarah Willie
Students and faculty at Swarthmore are
no different. Students use adjectives ranging from "fantastic" to "horrible" to
describe affirmative action.
Roy Sriwattanakomen 'O5 is an ardent
supporter of it. "If a school is committed to
diversity, it obviously has to take steps to
foster it," he said. He saw affirmative action
as a way for institutions to remedy past discrimination against minorities.
Eliza Cava 'O6 agreed with Sriwattanakomen's views. She believes minorities

Felicia Carter 'O3 elaborated on the obstacles that many minorities face. White people
get extra points, too, she said; they just don't
realize it. "Because of their white privilege,
they have an environment that is more conducive to being an attractive college candidate," she said. Carter thinks admissions
departments are right in supporting affirmative action because "the standard way
that we evaluate a student doesn't account
for so many discriminating factors along the

way."

Not all Swarthmore students felt the
same as Carter. Erik Munroe 'O4 argued that
applicants should not be given preference
for non-academic factors. He thought the
discrimination minorities face receives far
too much emphasis. "To say that only certain groups have faced discrimination
just doesn't make sense," Munroe said.
"Every group has been discriminated
against by some other person at some time."

January 30, 2003

Mary Blair 'O5 finds arguments like
Munroe's ridiculous. "Most white people
can never fully understand the discrimination that the people who affirmative action
is trying to help have historically and currently felt," she said. "I, myself, as a white
person, cannot empathize with the racial
discrimination that other people have felt."
But others supported Munroe's opinions.

Kristie LaSalle 'O6 claimed that' iaffirmative
action actually lowers the quality of students accepted." She believes that, in perpetuating a system of affirmative action,
admissions offices are "sacrificing quality to
feed the American obsession with political
correctness." LaSalle offers the advice, "Let

Professor Sarah Willie of the sociology
and anthropology department does not
believe affirmative action is about any one
individual winning. "Affirmative action
isn't really for people ofcolor. It's for the better functioning of the institution," she said.
She argued that colleges have been made
more vibrant and interesting and that society has changed dramatically as a result of
affirmative action. In her eyes, it is a useful
tool. "I really don't think of affirmative
action as a handout to racial minorities. I
think of it as a reminder to [admissions
deans] to look for people unlike themselves," she said.

Anteneh Tesfaye 'O3, an Ethiopian student who plays forward striker for the soccer team, was upset that the United States'
current focus on Iraq is preventing public
awareness of the problems in Ethiopia.

"Usually, it's like, Ethiopia, Ethiopia,
Ethiopia, but with us going to war with
Iraq, no one's paying attention to Ethiopia."
According to a flyer handed out at the
clinic, "Eleven million people in Ethiopia
face the prospect of hunger in the coming

in Africa."

Wagner decided he wanted to do something to help. With Tesfaye and Rebecca

Tesfaye called his parents in Ethiopia to
get more accurate information about nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that
were involved in famine relief. They found

government and several NGOs, but Tesfaye
said donating to such a large fund would

Rhodes scholarship awarded to physic major

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Application essay focused on ethical dilemma of a career in physics
BY AN ASTASIA KOLENDO

akolendl@swarthmore.edu
Matt Landreman 'O3 is one of 32 Americans chosen this
year to study at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes

scholarship.

The Rhodes scholarship, now in its centennial year, is
one of the oldest and most prestigious international fellowships available to Swarthmore students. It pays for two
years of study at the university, with a possibility of extension for a third year.
"I just don't believe it," Landreman said when asked
about his reaction to receiving the scholarship. "I just feel
like a typical person at this college, so I guess [my acceptance] says something good about Swarthmore."
Landreman's senior honors thesis is related to the work
he has done on the Swarthmore Spheromak Experiment
(SSX), under the guidance of his adviser Professor Michael
Brown. According to Brown, SSX simulates conditions
found on the sun and other stars, including temperatures
up to a million degrees and magnetic fields with as much
strength as those found on the sun.
SSX has two primary purposes, Brown said: to increase
the understanding of the sun through "laboratory astrophysics" and to study "magnetic confinement confusion."
This second purpose has a potential for practical application, which Brown said is the reason for the project's funding by both the Department of Energy and the National
Science Foundation.
Landreman is an honors physics major and math minor
in his fifth year at the college. His thesis in plasma physics

involves research conducted at Swarthmore over the last
50 years. He spent one of his two extra semesters in
Budapest studying mathematics and the other doing a
directed reading project under the supervision of
Professor Oberdiek in the philosophy department on the
moral justifiability of a career in physics.
"I've had my doubts about how worthy it is to devote
your life to something like that. It's selfish on some levels,"
Landreman said. He decided to continue studying physics
because of his interest in the area and his belief in technological progress. Nevertheless, this ethical dilemma later
found its way into Landreman's Rhodes application essay.
He is not yet certain of what program he will pursue at
Oxford, but he is considering a math or a physics research
degree. Landreman plans on deciding once in England.
"You really don't know who the best advisers are until you

meet them," Landreman said.

Landreman is the 29th Swarthmore student to become a
Rhodes Scholar, although Monique Bourque, the fellowships
and prize coordinator, said records may not be complete.
To be selected for the program, Landreman went through
a four-round selection process. The initial application for the
scholarship consists of a 1,000-word statement of purpose and
five to eight letters of recommendation. In the first round,
the college's Committee on Fellowships and Prizes decides
which candidates' applications to endorse, and in the second
round, some candidates are eliminated at the state committee level. In 2002, 981 applicants made it to the second round
in the United States, receiving endorsements from 341 colleges and universities. The third and fourth rounds both

trict level. In Landreman's case, the district interview
process, conducted in New York City, included finalists from
West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
After the fourth round of interviews, applicants remain
on site until the final scholarship decisions are made. "We
found out right at the interviews," Landreman said.
According to a Jan. 12 New York Times article by
Michael Winerip, "How to Win a Rhodes," the number of
matriculating Rhodes Scholars is increasingly used as a
gauge for the quality of a college or a university. The same
article describes the aggressive coaching methods in use at
other institutions, such as the University of Arkansas. The
Swarthmore Committee on Fellowships considered and
decided against using a similar strategy.
"I put a lot of thought into it, and I think it is both inappropriate and unnecessary," Bourque said. "We focus on
educating humans, not grooming scholarship winners."
She said that she would be making extra efforts to inform
students interested in various scholarship and fellowship
programs as early as their sophomore year.
In general, according to Bourque, faculty or administrators direct students to her. This approach, however,
sometimes misses potential candidates.
"It hasn't been as cooperative a process as it might have
been," Bourque said. "My goal is to work with faculty to

reach more people."
Landreman said that he became aware of the Rhodes
Scholarship gradually, over many years. In particular, he
cited meeting Gil Stott, a 1938 Rhodes scholar and a former
fellowship and prize coordinator, as particularly
encouraging.

ITS to implement new password policy
Auditing firm recommends changes in e-mail system to improve network security
BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu

Based upon a recommendation from auditing firm
Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Information Technology
Services, announced a new password protection policy
that requires students to change their e-mail passwords
every 90 days.

The college expects the new changes to go into effect in
a reserved-students e-mail.
The new policy also calls for numerous technical
changes in the ways in which students can construct a
password. Most notably, students will now have to include
certain characters in their passwords. The new guidelines
call for a password of at least six characters and with one
uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one number.
ITS has initiated other measures, as well, all of which
are designed to increase the security of the Swarthmore email network. After five failed logon attempts, students'
accounts will be locked, and an ITS employee will have to
reset the account password.
Additionally, the college has put into place two guidelines to avoid repetitve password use. The network now
demands a password history of three. This means that
students have to create three new passwords before
reusing a previous one. Finally, students must wait at
least five days after changing a password before it can be

Pricewaterhouse Coopers suggested the new password

company that audits the college financially to make sure
all published numbers are accurate and all of the processes used to obtain them are on par with standard practices.
"One of the reasons we elect to do this information systems audit is because [Pricewaterhouse Coopers is] a
company which stays up with all of the best and newest
practices and procedures," Dumic said.
Dumic stressed that this change was not forced upon
the college; rather, ITS opted to implement these policies
in order to improve the security of the Swarthmore e-mail
network.
"This is not a requirement; this is something we
choose to do. Sometimes, they can point out places where
we can improve what we're doing, improve security,
improve efficiency. They have a lot of expertise in the network security area, the systems security area. It's like

John worries about underground tunnels, but not the

After groundhogs, the government is Centralia's worst
enemy. "If somebody knocks on your door and says

should be at least mildly concerned," he advised. Efforts
from the government to "help" Centralia in the past
include spraying industrial amounts of herbicide on the
grass and removing vital stop signs. "If they had helped
less and listened more, the folks in Centralia would have
been a whole lot happier."
While listening to John's version of the peaceful,
Centrailian way of life ("It's more like living in a state
park than anything else"), I recalled the toxic fume crater

Though the mine fire had not spread beneath the residential area and the inhabitants appeared to be leading

healthy lives, we cannot judge if and how poisonous gases

affect them. Did the government conjure visions of danger to further its designs on Centralian coal? Or are the
locals simply obstinate? These questions are likely to
remain unanswered.

distributed throughout all of Marple's 10 theaters; this is
what the last four years have taught me to avoid. I certainly don't expect to encounter many elderly patrons,
pushing walkers and dragging 0 2 cans behind them.
Sunday night, however, I swam through a sea of bluetinted hair to my seat. Confused by the old-woman smell,
and the rustle of Depends as the wrinkled gentleman
beside me shifted in his seat, I double-checked to make
sure I'd wandered into the right place. I never see old people at the movies. But then, I've never gone to see a movie
starring Jack Nicholson as a 66-year-old disgruntled

retiree.
Nicholson took home the Golden Globe Award for Best
Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama Category, and he definitely deserved it. While not a one-man show, "About
Schmidt" is as close to a solo performance as a modern
cinematic production could possibly get. And it's refreshingly void of gratuitous special effects, violence and typical Hollywood sexuality (though Kathy Bates does bare
slightly more than her soul in one particularly affecting
scene).
As Warren R. Schmidt, former vice president/actuary
of Woodman Insurance Co., Nicholson reminded me vaguely of Edward Norton's "Fight Club" character, Tyler
Durden. They're both solitary men, caught up in the bustle of successful business and American life, and they find
themselves questioning the purpose of their lives, the

outrageously absurd scenario he had imagined.

ing; they both suffer wild delusions as they muddle
through the disasters of their lives. The only real difference between the characters is that Schmidt is pushing 70,
whereas Tyler is barely 30. Even afflicted with similar
senses of impending doom and taken to similar bouts of
uncleanliness and "screw the world" mentalities, the
routes taken by the two men, simply because of age, are
enormously different.

writing him lengthy diatribes about everything from how
he hates his wife for making him sit to pee to how he considers himself a failure in the game of life. He vents in his
letters, bombarding the distant child with what he perceives as the hardships of his life, glad for the forum and
the complete lack of immediate response, thrilled to have
the illusory companionship, something, anything to give
his life a little significance. What he doesn't realize is that,
beyond all his psychological mumbo jumbo, behind all his
rationalization and convoluted analysis, lies the solution
he can't reach, the solution that his soon-to-be son-in-law,
dumb and mulleted as he might be, has managed to integrate into every facet of his life.
"About Schmidt" is a simple story, but its implications
are tremendously complex. It is, in many ways, a slow,
meandering tale, yet it rushes through intense moments,
scrambles past wrenching scenes. It is the story of one
man and the tale of everyman. Tragically for Schmidt, the
premise of this movie is more often woven into "coming-ofage" settings. Warren Schmidt's story serves to poignantly
illustrate that, despite what we may have been repeatedly
and proverbially told, age and wisdom (or simple understanding) are not necessarily part of the same package.

ridiculously labeled a
"temple massager." (A

year later, my stepmom, a
Catholic schoolteacher, found it under my mattress and
put it on my bureau. Even if she hadn't caught on at first,
I'm sure that, by the third time, when she found it in my
underwear drawer, she wasn't fooled by its purported use).
Several increasingly powerful vibrators later, sex toy
shopping is old hat for me, but I recalled the many taboos
surrounding toys when I revisited C.K. with a few friends.
This time, it was they who had come with a purpose, but
they grew tense as we made our way toward the back of the
store. Rows of vibrators, anal plugs, dildos, anal and vaginal beads and cock rings in multiple sizes, shapes, textures
and colors surrounded us, clearly making not only my
friends but many of the store's customers more anxious
than turned on. One of my friends in particular was not
convinced of the benign nature of many of the products,

but after much persuading ("Pink isn't weird, it's cute

...

no, trust me, it will fit... it won't make you become addicted to vibrator use, I swear"), she came around.
Happily, I can report that I did not lead her astray and
that my recommendations are supported by a great deal of
altruistic testing (I know, I'm practically a saint) and will
surely not disappoint.

Many of us have unconsciously internalized society's
definitions of what sex "should be" or what constitutes
"appropriate" sexual behavior. If you've ever had a con-

versation with me, even if it was a conversation about
flowers or world peace, I inevitably launched into how I
would describe these constructions of so-called sexual correctness
in a word, bull. If there's one thing that pains
me deeply, it's the knowledge that there are far too many
people having too few orgasms.
But no, I'm not going to let my

inner Swattie take over
and start tracing sexual behavior over the century, of
course keeping in mind race, gender, class, sexuality and
ethnicity. Instead, I'm merely going to describe a few of the
most popular sex toys out there, why you should try them
and how to use them. The beauty of toys is their versatilivirtually all can be used alone or with a partner (I'm
ty
serious), many have adjustable settings so you have complete control, and they're small enough that no one will
suspect that's not an econ book in your backpack.
Where to buy toys? Those who don't mind being asked
by the friendly cashier whether they'd also like to buy D
batteries should check out Condom Kingdom and the EZone, both located on South Street in Philadelphia. For the
buyer who would prefer a bit more anonymity, there are
many online stores more than willing to send your goods
in a plain box marked "NOT from www sextoys.com." In
all seriousness, I can attest that these stores are used to
being discreet and generally keep their word. A few popular sites include www.mypleasure.com and www.intimategifts.com. And now a few gadgets sure to please even the

most timid of customers:
Dildos come in a dazzling array of styles, shapes and
sizes. (They're not all huge, I promise). There are some
that are smooth and look like an elongated bullet, some
that are detailed to look and feel more like penises.
Generally, "dildo" refers to toys used vaginally or anally
that don't vibrate. They can be used in sex play or mastur-

bation.
Vibrators sometimesresemble gyrating dildos and can
be used anally or vaginally. Some have an attachment for
simultaneous clitoral stimulation, such as the "Rabbit"
January 30, 2003

featured on "Sex and the City." (The latter is the type I
enthusiastically endorse for those of us who have clits.)
For the shopper who might prefer "friendlier-looking"
toys, vibrators that look like lipsticks, butterflies and
seashells are all fun and effective.
Anal plugs are often the preferred toys for anal stimulation, because they have a cap at one end that prevents
the object from being swallowed up by an overeager rectum. They range from itty-bitty to mammoth, and using
them instead of other objects will ensure that you won't
ever have to have a very awkward 3 a.m. conversation
with one of the nurses at Worth.
Anal/vaginal beads resemble a cheap plastic necklace.

rapidly during orgasm for heightened sensation.
I would be a terrible Sexual Health Counselor if I didn't
make one last safer sex note. It is extremely important that
you take good care of your toys, as they can pick up bacteria and spread nasty infections to unwitting orifices.

Condoms can and should be worn over dildos, vibrators or
anal plugs and make cleanup a snap. If you're up for being
latex-free or you can't use a condom with your toy, swab it
with alcohol after every use and store it in a clean con-

tainer. So now that I've waxed poetic about the splendor of
toys, take a field trip by yourself or with your honey to
C.K. or E-Zone and release some of that post-break stress.

Black and white at the List Gallery
BY HEATHER DOYLE
hdoylel@swarthmore.edu

want to make an exception for this chance to view a
refreshing display of undeniable talent. Brave the cold
tonight and come to the gallery opening at five. I guarantee it will be worth it.
The works of 11 different artists are currently on display. Many of the artists are Philadelphia residents, but
some hail from New York and other East coast cities.
Location is not the unifying element. In fact, only two common threads run among all of the carefully selected pieces:
black and white.
Actually, make that three common threads. Black,
and a perfect selection of talent. Celia Reisman
white
and Andrea Packard, co-curators of the exhibit, chose the
artists not only for their skill with the medium but also for
the way their works complement each other's strengths.
According to Reisman, "We tend to think black and white
can't make an impact like color does, but color just isn't
necessary [to achieve the same effect]." Rather, she says,
black and white heighten our awareness of composition.
Somehow, the exhibit manages to offer something for
everyone. From Charles Ritchie's small, painstakingly
rendered dark interiors to the crowd of bodies and haunting faces by Scott Noel, to Tara Goings' enigmatic and
abstracted dream animals, all the works display a surprisingly cohesive range of sentiments, sentiments most of us
probably never associated with these two most basic and
simple hues.
So visit and be warned. Side effects of this exhibit may
include an appreciation for winter colors you thought
you'd never enjoy. Also, some advice: It might be better to
avoid that blissful, leisurely stroll through the Crum until
warmer weather rolls in. We don't want to have to blame
the power of art for your hypothermia ... but we will if we
have to.

careers that sophomores have met together as a class, but
relax, kids, it really didn't matter at all.
But any occasion that calls for Olde English has got to
be pretty damn important. Really, to clue you sophomores
in, it is an important decision, and it can determine what
your job will be later in life. For example, if you are an
interpretation theory minor with a special major in environmental women's studies, you will probably be busing

there wasn't much choosing either. I wouldn't call trying
to figure out which department will take our D- average

and let us into the "honors" program choosing. That's
more like the high school prom for fat people. You take
what you can get. (Trust us, we know. Our dates were like
the religion majors of the high school prom.) Also, if you
buy theirlogic that it really doesn't matter what you major
in, and you work a bit harder than the average Swattie,
why bother thinking too hard about it? A random choice is
as good as any informed decision you may be able to make.
All this aside, we do have a real point. At any reasonably large university or college, "Chocolates and
Choosing" never would have happened. Most schools
would have taken the more practical approach to all this
and stuffed the pamphlet in students' mail boxes. If anyone
had questions, they could have sent an e-mail to, or asked,
some mentor figure they knew in the administration, like
an adviser or something. If the administration really
wanted to bring the sophomore class together in the same
place, then it should have picked something a little bit
more enjoyable than reading from a pamphlet
like
pulling weeds on Parrish beach.
So, apparently, the first "Chocolates and Choosing" was
on Valentine's Day. We can only guess how many Swatties
thought this would make a good date. We will leave you all
with what should not be considered an idle threat, because
that cookie was no ordinary cookie. It was chocolate chip,
and Bob, if you think we won't do everything in our power
to get it back, you are sorely mistaken.

STUDY A WHAT?
BY JONAH GOLD

jgoldl@swarthmore.edu

So this, with thanks due to dead white men and Malev
Airlines, is my Trope of Arrival:
You, the escaped Swattie, are sitting, bleary-eyed and
unwashed, on cracker wrappers and Maxim, trying to
remember the Amsterdam airport, wondering if you actually slept last night and if the plot of "Ice Age" was a product of your fevered imagination. A city forms below you.
The contents of your stomach are trying to stay put some
1,000 meters in the air. Then, before you know it, spinning
wheels hit foreign runway. Touchdown. You step off,
unnerved and hyperaware in the way only true travelweariness can produce. Where the hell are you?
Congratulations. You've just embarked on your genuine American Study Abroad Experience. This is one of
those coming-of-age things; if there isn't a "National
Lampoon's Study Abroad" movie yet, there should be.
What I'm verbally stumbling at is how quintessential a
part of the College Experience it's become. Vast hordes of
us do it, and with good reason. Who, especially at our age,
doesn't want to "see the world"?
But should you, the aspiring underclassman or indecisive junior, join the party? Is mixing travel and "study" all
it's cracked up to be? This is the question I intend to try to
.

answer.
So why wouldn't you study abroad? Believe it or not,
there actually are some reasons. First off, aren't all college
students in other countries just loud, noisy, ugly
Americans, who terrorize the locals and lay waste to the
native culture with their disco dancing, cheap-beer-drinking, filter-smoking ways? Um, yes, many are, and boy, do
they suck. But that doesn't mean you have to be, and I
would urge you otherwise
don't be a reason the rest of
the world hates us. Have fun, by all means, but be nice and
polite and all the other things your mom told you to be. It'll
make me less likely to feel the need to claim Canadian citizenship next time I visit wherever you're going.
More pertinent a reason for the negative case, perhaps,
is your own hardcore-ness. The sad truth is that most foreign study programs take academics about as seriously as

I take Henry Rollins' spoken word career

yourself fed up with writing papers entitled "My Reaction

than L'Ecole Pour les Americains Stupides in Paris. This
is also the place to mention that you can go abroad, for a

semester, year, or however the hell long you want, without
being part of a college program. It's probably a little more
effort, but it might, in the long run, be more rewarding
save your college for college and your foreign cultural
experience for real life. I am saying this with a straight
face, and I really think some of you are listening: If you
want to get a fully challenging and engaging academic
experience out of every single undergraduate semester, do
not study abroad, or at least choose your program carefully
It is, in fact, possible to find academically intense study
abroad, but even if you can't, the better counterpoint to
this complaint is a simple and enthusiastic "who cares?"
The point of "study abroad" is clearly less in the "study"
and more in the "abroad." It might very well not kill you to
have a relatively un-academic semester. Living somewhere else is a learning experience, and, in that sense,
spending time in another country as part of college makes
perfect sense. Even if you don't go to classes, and I know
people who didn't, you may learn more abroad just by
walking out of the door than you probably would by taking

that crazy religion seminar you've been ogling.
As an example (you knew this was coming, right?), I
present a list offive things I learned outside of class while

abroad in Budapest:
A single diacritic mark can affect whether you're toasting someone's health or their ass. Both are appropriate in
certain contexts, I guess, but it is good to keep them

straight.
Hungarian for "snow" is "ho." This explains, or at least
partially explains, the signs that say "ho show" with the
picture of the polar bear which popped up everywhere in

November.
Small children make very good railroad conductors. I
bet they conduct electricity pretty well, too.
Socialist realism is hilarious. You need to see the giant
statues of Lenin (the ones that didn't get smashed) that

once adorned the streets of ex-communist countries like
Hungary to understand.
Depeche Mode rule. No, seriously. Have you listened to
"Enjoy the Silence" lately? Thousands of Hungarians have,
and they are better people for it.
See? I have become a better person.
Obviously, I'm being stupid as usual, but in the spirit of
the "Now More Substantive!" living section, my point is
serious: Other cultures are worth your time, and study
abroad isn't a bad way of going about discovering them.
Not the only way, to be sure, but not a bad way.
So if you were debating it, I hope I've convinced you: go
to Foreign Study Stud Steve Piker's office in Pearson, listen to his monologue, and start country shopping. But my

final word of warning is this: You may not want to come
back. A friend of mine got pulled into the magical morass
of Central Europe and is now living in Germany with his
Magyar (Hungarian) girlfriend. And while I made it safely
back to the States, I can't deny the abroad-sickness I have
seem to have. So I'm a broken record. "Why does all the
alcohol taste so bad here?" "Why is everything so expensive?" "Why isn't more food fried?" "Why are we going to
war again?" OK, the last one is valid, but the rest is just
whining. Shut up, me. I'll head back soon enough, to visit,
at least. But for now, I've got some Swarthmore, Pa. to

attend to.

Hospitality, language make for a learning experience

Braddock followed the advice of former participants and her passion for warm weather to
great success. "I could now feel completely comfortable calling Sri Lanka my second

college who was Braddock's steady companion for much of the trip) stranded six hours
from where she was staying, Braddock's grasp of the language and cultural spirit won her
(and The Boy) a ride home from a Sri Lankan restaurant worker.
Although the people of the country were welcoming, the trip was not without political
concerns. Braddock explained, "the ISLE program is 20 years old
this [last semester]
was the first time the whole island was open. 'Going east' during the LTTE [the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a separatist group] stronghold would've been unheard of."
Although Kandy, the program's central location, has never been very affected by political
struggle, the program's leaders weren't sure what to tell students who wanted to visit
areas that had recently established peace. "Students felt they should've been able to travel more," Braddock said.
While her position as a "Caucasian student who can speak the language" helped
things, Braddock said that "being a woman was difficult." Braddock recounted that,
whenever she went to the capital to do research as part of an independent study program,
men on the street would always ask, "You go where?" Generally wary of men who
addressed her in English, Braddock said she'd either respond in Sinhala, thus gaining

more respect, or simply "put my sunglasses on and keep walking." Braddock explained
that American women are seen as "loose" in a society where females are expected to
remain virgins until marriage, stay sober in public and not smoke. She elaborated,
"Sinhala has no word for 'orgasm.'"

More than red tape
The aftershocks of the Sept. 11 attacks continue to
spread: registries of Muslim residents, summary
deportations, long lines in airports, armed pilots in
planes, National Guardsmen everywhere, Poindexter
back from retirement with more powerful computers
this time ... Next to all this, Why fret over a computer
system listing colleges and universities' international

students?
After all, terrorism is an issue that affects everyone; this has been the government's justification in
recruiting everyone to work, unpaid, for the
Department of Homeland Security, slowly expanding
the responsibilities of independent institutions like
Swarthmore to conform to antiterrorism policies.
With suspicion rising about the left-leaning, statusquo-questioning tendencies of academia, higher education may soon displace airports and post offices in
the War on Terror spotlight. Leaders are especially
zoning in on our role as liaisons between America
and the rest of the world, especially our irresponsibly
tolerant attitude toward citizens of the Axis of Evil.
Admittedly, the SEVIS system itself is more or less

innocuous. Aside from creating more red tape and
requiring colleges to do a lot more gruntwork on the
behalf of the INS, it's little more than a streamlining
process for federal investigations. Even so, many of
the worst abuses of civil liberties in history have
come about from simple "streamlining" legislation.
What's worrying is the nature of the investigations
SEVIS is meant to streamline. The government seems
hellbent on making profiling a way of life and summarily declaring that, in the interests of security,
some colors, religions and nationalities will be officially under suspicion from now on. SEVIS is thus an
easy way to compile a list of individuals officially
under suspicion. This didn't help colleges do their job
back in the 19505, and it's not going to help now.
Until now, the Buckley Amendment has been colleges' and universities' main weapon against such
policies, defending their right and responsibility to
give their students a free, safe environment in which
to learn. It is this egalitarian, politically neutral stance

on the part of American schools that's attracted foreign students in the past, helping bring talented immigrants to our workforce and forge bonds of friendship

between Americans and the rest of the world.
This policy is now under fire; the dangerously
broad language pioneered by the lIRIRA basically
gives Congress precedent to write hidden "ignore
Buckley as necessary" clauses to avoid the political
consequences of officially revoking Buckley protec-

tion from our internationals. We can almost certainly
expect further demands from government enforcers in
the future, not to mention an expansion of the highrisk countries list and additions to the already-substantial cases of intimidation and abuse of power in
the process of carrying out such investigations.

Polarized abortion debate detrimental
Dear Editor:
Last week, Swarthmore Students Advocating Life
(SSAL) tabled in Sharpies for monetary donations for two
local Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs). These centers provide free medical care, housing, clothing, legal advice and
adult education classes to moms and dads in crisis pregnancies
quite often single or teenage parents. Through
Swatties' generous support, we raised over $lOO, which was

given directly to the CPCs. There were some Swatties that
declined to donate, and that's OK. But there were even
more that heard that SSAL is pro-life-affiliated and immediately decided that they could not support the CPCs. In
some cases, they even declined to listen to what we had to

the rhetoric of the abortion debate. We're not talking about
legislation or picketing
or even abortion. Real women
make a choice to have children and are in desperate need
of support. Their needs come before any labels. Whether

pro-choice or pro-life people collect the money and run the
shelter, the needs of women must be addressed. And that's
the real point
not to forward some political agenda, but
to improve the situation for women in crisis pregnancies.
Pro-choice individuals work to create a climate in
which pregnant women have a free choice. To make a
choice, one must have two accessible options. The goals of
pro-life and pro-choice people should coincide when it
comes to moms that bear their children protecting their

say, much less make a donation.
What changes about free prenatal care, housing, and
adult education when the organization that provides them
is pro-life? Nothing. There are single, teenage, impoverished and otherwise troubled pregnant women that need
these services; SSAL works to make them accessible.
It's sad that labels hinder this goal. The withdrawal of
support during our tabling is a prime example of the counterproductive effect of the polarized abortion debate. When
fewer people work to improve societal conditions for pregnant women, it is the women who suffer. When fewer people acknowledge the trauma that many women feel after an
abortion, it is the women who suffer. The more pro-life and
pro-choice groups focus on what divides them, the more

right and ability to choose life. Without this protection,
there is no such thing as choice.
SSAL does not ask anyone to compromise his or her
morals or beliefs. We seek to challenge the notion that prolife and pro-choice people must work separately toward isolated goals. We are committed to improving the status of
pregnant women and mothers, and we welcome anyone
with this goal to work with us. Where's the proof? SSAL
volunteers through Philadelphia-based Women's Way, an
organization that works hard to make this world womanfriendly and mother-friendly
and also happens to
espouse a pro-choice affiliation. The goals at stake are too
important to be compromised by a simplistic binary system. Focus on what's important

Putting liberals
back on offense

op-art

by

annie

ronan

"Liberal" has become a dirty word. Democrats run away from it;
Republicans push them toward it. Liberalism has come to signify
some vaguely nasty strain of politics, flighty and deadly, never
exactly defined, but always deigned to be somewhat dangerous and
subversive.
Keep in mind that I mean the liberalism of modern partisans,
not the liberalism of culture and society so invariably lauded, especially by conservatives, when we compare ourselves to terroristharboring and supporting regimes. See, it's good to be liberal in the
worldly sense, just not in the sense that it actually affects people's
lives. Strange, that. The ongoing
devaluation of liberalism as a concept highlights the constant rhetorical battles that the left engages in,
usually defending against a smirking conservative in a bow tie.
The root of this newly defensive

liberalism is a sea change in ideological motivation between the two
camps. Pre-Reagan, liberalism was
the unstoppable force, the wave of

necessary social change running
roughshod over the electorate in
every facet of American life.
Conservatism was the immovable
object, vainly trying to remain
JESSE TAYLOR
intractable in defense of basic prinWords Mean Things ciples that liberalism was subvertthe proacing. Then, a new idea
tive stance of liberalism, wrapped
up in conservatism! The second you
go on defense in politics is the second you start losing. For all its
vaunted powers, the court of public opinion is surprisingly ineffective in terms of actual influence
the court of public momentum,
however, is vastly underrated. Basically, it doesn't matter if anyone
agrees with what you're thinking, just if anyone believes that you're
thinking it, and, most importantly, that everyone else is thinking it
precisely because you're thinking it. Clever, eh? The progressives
became reactive, and the regressives became proactive.

Reagan's conservatism was the raging conservatism of rebellion. It had fire, it had a goal and, most importantly, it had an
enemy. There was a problem, and Reagan's party had a way to fix

it. Granted, many of his solutions involved criminal convictions
and the phrase "plausible deniability," but damn it, he had a plan!
Liberals, increasingly finding themselves under assault from the
right, were now being asked the questions rather than asking them.
The terms of the debates were being defined by the right, and the
left forgot the cardinal rule of journalism
he who asks the questions shapes the answer. For some reason, 20-plus years of this has
not sunk in, and the left finds itself struggling to tread water in an
ocean full of sharks.
Conservatives became the ideological crusaders of the political
world, fighting against the new status quo of liberal accomplishments and purported overreaching. The Republican Party hasn't
had a new policy idea since the word "tax" met the word "cut," yet
for some reason they've had great success selling policies so wellworn Goodwill would be hard pressed to accept them. Success in
the policy arena, much like the public arena, has little to do with
the quality of or objective support for the policy and a great deal
more to do with how the policy is sold to those who matter
sometimes the voters, sometimes the media, sometimes the money guys.
Policy fails when it's seen as attempting to cling to an idea and
succeeds when it's seen as changing something, even when the
change is actually a reversion
the debate is shaped by the
attempted attack rather than the defense. Conservatives sell social
and economic policy as changes in the legislative and elective
dynamic, and that salesmanship translates to electoral success.
Liberals are increasingly stuck saying "let's keep this" rather than
"let's do this," so they falter at the ballot box. Look at the debate
over Bush's tax cuts, where the argument over whether tax cuts
should exist was essentially abdicated up front, changing the
debate into a competition over who could waste money in the least

inefficient way.
The solution is part aggressiveness and part ideology. You win
nothing in politics by being right —just ask Bush. Political success
is a function ofattractiveness over efficacy, determinism over practicality. People believe their ideas are right. It's figuring out how to
make others argue against the Tightness of your position rather
than for the Tightness of theirs that determines success. When the
left figures this out, liberalism will again become a vigorous and
functioning ideology.

Blix faces the inevitable: war with Iraq
BY ARTHUR CHU
achul@swarthmore.edu

Blix is back. And he's not happy.

The leader of the much-touted UN. weapons
the world's last line of defense for internationalism, multilateralism and ignoring President
Bush, has finally delivered his report, and the buzz
may yet drown out the Tampa Super Bowl victory.
Northern Californian peace activists now have one
more reason to be depressed; after months of pleading the United States to let the inspectors do their
work before invading, they've finally gone and done
their work. The answers they're giving us, honestly,
aren't what many of us wanted to hear.
inspectors,

Hans Blix's report claims that Iraq was almost

completely noncompliant with the terms of disarmament, and it expresses strong suspicions that Iraq has
dangerous stockpiles of biochemical weapons. The
scorn heaped on the inspections process by the Bush
administration is now being echoed by the chief of
inspections himself. Blix's report is rife with horror
stories ofevidence withheld or suppressed, scientists
testifying only under government surveillance, facilities barred from investigation and government representatives who constantly changed explanations
for minor irregularities like functional arms plants
and laboratory ingredients for mustard gas.
Needless to say, the hawks swooped down all over
this one. Even the normally moderate Colin Powell
is now demanding that either the United Nations
Security Council pass the resolution to approve the
use of force or the United States and its allies will
make do without one. All that remains now is for the
Security Council to make the smart move. The only
permanent member showing anything more than
token reluctance is France, and with its beloved "let
the inspections work" mantra gone, I don't expect it
to hold out longer than a week.
So what happened? Did the inspections work, in
fact? After all, Blix may have said the inspection
process was futile, but others disagreed, especially

Mohamed Elßaradei, head of the International
Atomic Energy Agency responsible for evaluation of
Iraq's nuclear threat. For his part, he said he'd
found no evidence for the flagship conservative
causa belli, an Iraqi nuclear arms program, and has
repeatedly asked for a few more months to complete
January 30, 2003

the inspections. Certainly it doesn't seem like 1 they
were there very long, comparatively speaking; two
months isn't that long to go through all the records
of a nation that's been cut off from the U.N. for
years, and it seems a tad too convenient that this
report came in just before Bush's optimum start
date for invasion.
I wonder just how tired Blix was of being
slammed as incompetent and naive by Bush's attack
dogs. And how annoyed he was getting, sifting
through one file and getting berated by the press for
not sifting through the other one, visiting this
mosque and being questioned by American pundits
for why he didn't go to all the other ones, hearing
the conservatives on one side calling him a convenient idiot for Saddam's tyranny and the liberals
praying to him as our savior from Bush's tyranny.
I mean, those aren't really the best working conditions. I doubt he gets paid enough to take that kind
of abuse.

Seriously, anyone who understands how politics
work knows that, when the President of the United
States wants to go to war in February and has publicly said that he will do so no matter what you say
in your report, the only thing for you to do is to
work hard and try to stick to the facts. But you do
eventually come to the realization that whatever
report you give has a lot more to do with your future
than Iraq's.
Blix's inspectors weren't experienced in the first
place; they were chosen after most of the original
inspections team had left that field in disgust, not

wanting to touch the politics all over again. So a certain reluctance to pursue inspections to their full
degree is not unprecedented; I'm fairly certain that,
if I were in Blix's place, I'd want little more than to
tally up whatever evidence I had, come home and let
the inevitable happen.
After all, just like the FBI investigation that
cleared Iraq of involvement with Sept. 11, just like
the CIA data that showed Iraq couldn't have imported enough material to have a nuclear bomb on hand,
just like the State Department analysis that showed
high risks of major Middle Eastern destabilization
and who knows what all in the event of an invasion
in short, just like all the well-intentioned efforts
to actually rationally discuss the Iraq issue, it was
never going to make any difference anyway.

Standstill in Venezuela
General strike paralyzes Chavez government
'tfterwards, presidential elections would be held.
Although this solution does not fully satisfy either side, it is the only

BY VERONICA HERRERA
Let's face it. Hugo Chavez is not going anywhere. For nearly tw
months, Venezuela has suffered from a general strike that has paralyzed
the oil industry and depleted food stores. The strike has been led by a
coalition of opposing parties and union and business leaders in protest
of President Chavez. In recent opinion polls, only 25 percent of the
country, mainly Venezuela's poor, approved of Chavez. The other 75
percent accused him of being a military socialist who was jeopardiz-

Chavez's twisted notion of political legitimacy. The respect and
support that Latin American governments have shown Chavez
would quickly disintegrate were he to try to botch or corrupt the
elections. An August election would create a reasonable amount
of political legitimacy that, just like Pinochet's 1998 plebiscite
that voted him out of dictatorial power, Chavez would be pressured to respect. The Venezuelan opposition must muster the
patience to wait until August. Until then, they can formulate a
united front and rally for votes for one or two key opponents. If
they fail to centralize their opposition against Chavez, they

ing Venezuela's economic and political stability. When protesting
Chavez's attempts to take over the world's fifth-biggest oil industry,
strike leaders (a now fragmented coalition) imagined that a general
strike would be short-lived and successful; Chavez would be forced to
resign and hand over the rest ofhis two-year presidency to the winner
of a special election. So far, they have been dead wrong, and the stakes
are high: Civil war, hunger and political chaos may soon be unleashed.
After two failed military coup plots and a few years in jail, populist
leader Chavez came to power in 1998 through a transition from soldier
to politician. With his flamboyant and incendiary personality, he
made promises of "revolutionary" social policies that
topple the country's corrupt and wealthy oligarchs. So
all he has managed to do is anger them. Through mess
politicking, he has isolated almost everyone, from
Venezuela's traditional business and political elite to
populist labor unions. The strike has been a general

stand to lose any election, regardless of when it is held.
When democratic rules are not respected during
crisis, the very democratic structures necessary for
resolving the crisis topple. Then all we are left with
is chaos and a shortage of viable solutions. Forced
removals from office just perpetuate the cycle of
political chaos' that may lead to civilian human
rights violations by the military. Latin American
countries need to hold each other accountable to
democratic procedures that protect human rights
and civil order. In light of grave development problems, democracy may not seem like much. But it is
the fragile thread that holds these'nations together.
Whether the solutions be imperfectly socialist or

show of disapproval for Chavez, but its failure indi-

cates that another solution is in order.
The 1999 Chavez-authored constitution allows for a
binding referendum to remove the president at
midterm, which would be in August 2003. The opposition does not want to wait until August, but as Jorge
I. Dominguez and Steven Levitsky of The New York
Times suggest, they should reconsider.
Former President Jimmy Carter has recently proposed two conciliatory solutions that would end the
strike and restore stability to Venezuela. Mr. Chavez

capitalist, democracy and free-elections should be
preserved lest we continually have to start from
scratch. Each time we disrupt the imperfect balance
of democracy, we are forced to start over. And as
20th-century Latin American history shows us, the

The Republican Party, if not readily willing to create suitable programs to meet the needs of the unwanted children
whose rights it is purportedly protecting, should leave
Roe v. Wade and the topic of abortion well enough alone.
The fact that the 30-year-old decision has even come
under scrutiny is appalling. I can only begin to fathom the
consequences of overturning a ruling that profoundly

affects so many U.S. citizens, male and female, young and
old. Since 1973, doctors in the United States have performed over 40 million legal abortions, according to sta-

tistical research provided by the Alan Guttmacher
Institute. That's 40 million unwanted children that the

Republican Party would have alive but not necessarily
cared for. Meeting the additional needs of 40 million more
children abandoned or born into poverty would require
immense tax increases ... the same that Republican agendas would have abolished. Abolish tax hikes,'abolish abortion and prepare to welcome a big, fat social dilemma. Not
only would 40 million unwanted children have been born
in the last 30 years, but approximately 40 million women
would, at some point, have been desperate, distraught
over their unwanted pregnancies
enter botched abortions, infectious disease, deformed infants, death.
Reversing the Roe v. Wade ruling on a moral basis may
be a perfectly legitimate political position, and I'm not
about to deny Republicans the right to their personal
beliefs and views. They'd just better be prepared to deal
with the pervasiveness of the potentially sloppy effects
that would follow, which doesn't seem to mesh particularly well with the party's current preferences.
Personally, I am 100 percent for legalized abortion, but
I think the liberal-conservative line is a little blurry on
the matter. For most intents and purposes, I consider
myself pretty politically liberal. I don't generally think
people should die, except in extreme bin Laden-esque cir-'
cumstances. And economic policy or national expense
don't generally factor into my sociopolitical assessments.
I think I'm conservative about abortion, however,
because I think that the costs of not permitting abortions
vastly outweigh the benefits, because I think the premaJanuary 30, 2003

ture death of a few million unwanted infants is probably,
all things considered, the best option in many scenarios
(economic, emotional, social, etc.)- But here's where
things get liberal: I think it's up to the conceiving women

Reconceiving affirmative action
Socioeconomic criteria should replace current racial considerations

America's left, sought to remove the definitions assigned
to people based on the color of their skin. For practical
purposes, affirmative action requires that we define who
exactly is an underrepresented minority. Take blacks, for
example. Does the child of a black mother and white
father qualify for the benefits of affirmative action? What
about a child with a single black grandparent? The implementation of affirmative action based on race is a stride in

merit, it chooses to identify them by an indicator whose
applicability is often dubious. It is a step away from once
again labeling individuals as mulattos, quadroons,
octoroons and so forth based on their racial purity.
The problem with basing affirmative action on race is
that not all underrepresented minorities have suffered the
same societal inequalities. The children of affluent blacks
receive preference in college admissions over their white
counterparts solely because they are black. If the goal of
affirmative action were truly racial equality, it would

advocate the removal of preference to the black student in
this case. Taken to its logical conclusion, this example
illustrates the need for preference based on some more
apparent point of inequality than race.
Proponents of affirmative action often cite impoverished familial conditions and poor inner-city schools as
reasons for the policy's necessity. Neither of these reasons, however, is dependent upon race. Rather, if these are
the underlying causes of minority underrepresentation,
then they should be the issues in focus rather than an
individual's skin color. Promoting preferential treatment
of those from lower economic strata is a favorable alter-

native. It gives an advantage to the children of poor
whites and Asians in addition those who are fortunate
enough to be born into what affirmative action proponents view as the "right" groups. This plan should still
appeal to those activists, because minorities, who are
overrepresented in the lower classes, would receive disproportionately greater benefits as a result. The outcome
would be a purer form of the equality sought by affirmative action without the associated racial discrimination.
Equality of opportunity is an admirable goal for which
to strive. To truly do so necessitates the ability to look
beyond the easy use of racial preferences and realize that
the equitable solution is not black and white. Such a serious problem requires a more thoughtful and logical remedy than that which is directly apparent. It is a pity that we
sacrifice meaningful social change in the name of political

correctness.

CAMPUS RELATIONS REP.

EDUCATIONAL POLICY REP.

APPOINTMENTS CHAIR

Wee Chua 'O6

Melinda Lee 'O4

Anmol Tikoo 'O6

This is Wee Jhong Chua, and I am again running for
campus relations representative, a position that was won
by the elected Mark Hanis, but once again is open. In fulfilling the role of campus relations representative, I will
ensure that Student Council is not just a group of students,
instead a group of students intent on helping the college
community. Determined to serve, I will unify the campus.
In an attempt to further communication between Student
Council and the Swarthmore community, I will keep the
public aware of the actions taken by Student Council. The
Phoenix and the Daily Gazette will also receive news on

My name is Melinda Lee. I am but one Lee out of 95 million Lees that grace this planet. I am but one junior of close
to 400 other juniors at this college. I am sorry to inform you
that I am not special.
Yet perhaps it is with this sympathy for commonality
that I would be able not only to represent but to be actively
present as the student member of the Educational Policy
Committee. I ask you to grant me the privilege to listen and
learn in this context of how intricately our education, our
ways of thinking and therefore of being are negotiated. For
who among us cannot sympathize with what Robert Pirsig
laments as a system of "years of carrot-and-whip grading," a
mule mentality which says, "If you don't whip me, I won't
work"?
You are not a mule! I am not a mule! (I am a Lee.) Perhaps
this is the best message I can bring to the forum if called
upon to debate PDCs, honors requirements or The Add/Drop
Forgiveness Fallacy: WE ARE NOT MULES. In that opinion,
I can be vocal on your behalf, I will be stubborn as a
Vote for me.

As I get ready for my second semester at Swat, I intend
to get more involved in the daily functioning of Swat by
running for the appointments chair in the Student
Council. I do not claim that I know it all and have it all to
be the perfect candidate for this position to say the least,
I am far from it. What I can assure you of is my relentless
enthusiasm to give back something to my community and
openness to other opinions and criticism. Drawing upon
my experiences as the president of my high school student
council, the Interact Club and other student organizations, I look forward to providing an organized, efficient
and collective work ethic within the appointments committee. The Appointments Committee would be made
more accessible to the student body so as to encourage and
facilitate student entry into the council and appointments
shall be carried out in a joint, judicious and transparent
manner. I hope to make Appointments Committee work
closely with the rest of Student Council so as to better

the proceedings. Working as a liaison between the people
and the Student Council, I will bring the college back to the
people. If there are any questions or suggestions contact
me. Phone: ext. 1240. E-mail: wchuaL

Audrey Dorelien 'O4
After studying abroad for a semester in France, I have
returned home to Swarthmore with renewed energy and
motivation. While abroad, through constant e-mails, reading The Phoenix, The Daily Gazette, and the Daily Jolt, I
made sure I kept up with the campus.
I have just joined the Cultural Diversity Task Force, I
am an active member of SASS, and I have been on the
SASS executive board.
I understand the necessary effort and time commitment
of joining SC and I fully accept the responsibility to fulfill
my elected duties. I will update and maintain the council
website; post the student council initiative and news
updates on the Sharpies Board; and would work with the
secretary on putting SC news and minutes in The Phoenix
and Daily Gazette. My primary objective is to change the
way campus is informed about decisions on the administrative and Student Council level.
I know what I am interested in, for example, issues on
financial aid, increasing campus safety, more club funding, diversity and being able to use points everywhere. But
to me what's more important are that your interests and
concerns are known.
I would greatly appreciate your votes.

George Petel 'O5
I am asking for your vote for educational policy representative. Why am I so special? Well, for starters, I am wholly committed to consistent, long-term improvement of this
college. I firmly believe that the only way for such improvement to happen is to have more student involvement in the
process. I want to ensure that all students have more input
on such an important aspect of their lives. I am also a
focused, responsible and attentive person. Those traits make
me a good candidate not only for this position but also for
Student Council in general. I will carry all ideas, advice and
complaints to the administration, whether someone speaks
to me about academics or about parties.
Education is why we are all here at Swarthmore. At
one time or another, we all find something we dislike
about the school's academic policy. One of the major complaints many students have is about the PDC policy. Like
former educational policy representatives, I see the need
for reform or outright removal of this program of spoonfed education. More importantly, I want to present student
ideas on alternatives to this system so that future students
do not yearn for the days of the PDC.

EDUCATIONAL POLICY REP.
Autumn Quinn-Elmore 'O4

My name is Autumn Quinn-Elmore and I would like to
be your educational policy representative. There are three
things I want to do for you.
The first is to complete the ongoing process of revising
PDCs. I stand for the standardization or elimination of
PDCs. The current system has drifted both in theory and
in practice from where it began, and the value of PDCs has
declined. We need a new group of classes that introduces
first-years to Swarthmore. We need a set of requirements
diverse enough to allow students to take classes in their
areas of interest and to explore new areas. As a community we must agree what these classes will consist of.
The second is that I will actively court student feedback
regarding the changes we are making in curriculum policy. In a school of 1,400, there is no way that a small group
of students and faculty members can hope to represent the
wishes of all unless there is active communication
between the committee and the student body. I will strive
to foster that communication, and I will gladly take your
concerns to the committee.
The third thing is that I will not resign my post until my
term is up. I am a student here, just as you are, and I think
it is irritating to have unnecessary midterm elections.

Roxanne Yaghoubi 'O6
I decided to run for educational policy representative
because I want to make sure that students have a say
regarding curriculum decisions. If elected, I would work
to make sure that students of all disciplines and interests
have their needs met. Though most of my own personal
interests lie in the social sciences, I would make myself
available to students, professors and administrators from
all areas and divisions of the college and try to reconcile
the diverse interests in a way that would benefit the greatest amount of students, both present and future. One
important issue right now that emphasizes these interests
is of course the elimination of PDCs. I support the movement to replace PDCs with first-year seminars, as I think
that these seminars will provide the best academic experience for first-years as well as preparing them for picking a major and, possibly, taking part in honors seminars.
However I also recognize that there are concerns regarding students being lotteried out of these seminars, particularly in the most popular departments. As your policy
rep, I would try to work with each deparment and division to come up with a plan to ensure that every student
who wanted to be in a seminar could be placed in one.
Another issue I think is important is advising. Many students' advisers simply sign their registration forms and
never get to know their advisees. Why not fix this problem by having the teacher of the first-year seminar also
act as the students' advisrr? This way the adviser will
have a better understanding of the student's work. These
ideas are just preliminary as I understand other issues
may come up during my term. All in all, if elected I am
committed to finishing my term and serving the college to
the best of my ability.

APPOINTMENTS CHAIR
Chris Ciarleglio 'O4
name is Chris Ciarleglio, and I am applying for
appointments chair because I believe that I can bring a
unique perspective to the position. As the appointments
chair, my primary focus would be adding to and improving
certain protocols regarding the college's appointments
My

committee, including:
•Giving more applicants the option of an interview
where applicable.
•Opening more committee selections to interview to
allow for a better impression than an application alone.
•Improving the activity of committees under the college's direction.
•Continuing to improve on the clarity of application
processes and of committee descriptions/goals.
•Shifting the application process from paper to a personal assessment.
I believe that in the execution of such an office, it is
important to get to know the person behind the application
a goal that I wish to fulfill if elected, making the appointments procedure more personable. Each applicant is worthy of the best assessment of his or her character.
In regards to the Student Council, I hope to offer my
expertise in administration and organization, my knowledge of students on this campus and their wishes and a
healthy amount of constructive criticism and enthusiasm.
I thank you graciously for your time.

understand the needs of the council and make more
informed decisions. I assure you that I understand the
responsibilities that this post entails and I hope to do my
best, if elected.

Patrick Hart 'O6
Hi! My name is Patrick Hart. I am a member of the class
of 2006, and I am running for the position of appointments
chair. The appointments chair has to make appointments
to a variety of different student committees. I believe that
being involved in the college academically, athletically (as
a member of cross country and track) and through student
activity groups (as a member of SQU and the QSA) has
given me a broad perspective that will allow me to work
well in a position that has to deal with a broad variety of
issues.
On the issues confronting Swat today, I would try to
work to keep Willets from becoming a first-year only dorm
and instead work to solve any problems there or in other
dorms through less drastic measures. The Student Council
also took a role recently on another matter of importance
to many Swatties by making the student appointments to
the Living Wage Committee. If more appointments to that
or any other committee involving a controversial campus
issue comes up, I would try to support appointments from
broad areas of the ideological spectrum. It is important,
after all, for all views to be heard.
And that's what I'll do as appointments chair: I'll hear
your views and try to implement them and make the campus better as a member of the Student Council.

Doru Gavril 'O5
Transparency
Ever wondered why some things don't get done? Why
money is allocated based on mysterious principles? Maybe
the people YOU want should be on those committees.
Maybe you should know the reasons for their decisions.
Maybe it's time to try something new.
Accountability

The appointments chair is a position that requires
some accountability mechanisms to be in place. We don't
have that right now. I will start creating the resources to
enable you to control your representatives.
Responsibility
I intend to stick to this job and attend to the duties you
entrust to me. I won't abandon ship, and I promise you
won't have to vote again in two weeks. In general, I want
to see things getting done, and I also believe that there is
true potential in the Student Council. One of my future
jobs, if elected, is to make sure that committees works
more efficiently and get more things done faster. I know
that these are the priorities of other members of the council. I will support their efforts and ensure that we work
closely together to make the council a more
efficient body.

Interaction

I will facilitate better and faster communication
between the Appointments Committee and our constituents. A reliable and informative web site will keep us
posted to what you want done. Appointments for the
Student Budget Committee will be open to the public and
you will have control over what we do.
A vote for me is a vote for transparency.

The opinions expressed here are those of the candidates and do not reflect the stance of The Phoenix. Voting for
the candidates will take place in Sharpies on Thursday, Jan. 31 and Friday, Feb. 1 Internet voting occurred
between Monday, Jan. 27 and Wednesday, Jan. 29. The results of the election will be announced on Friday night.

Swimmers romp Drew
BY EMILY CONLON
econlonl@swarthmore.edu
It happened in our pool. It belongs
here. And now it does. In a stunning performance on Saturday, John Lillvis 'O3
set the Ware Pool record of 4:20.33 in the
400-yard individual medley (IM), break-

ing a 16-year-old mark.
Lillvis captured the record during the
meet against non-conference opponent
Drew University. The previous time of
4:2168 was set in 1987 by a Western
Maryland College swimmer during the
Mid-Atlantic Conference Championship.
Lillvis won first place by just under 10
seconds, helping the Swarthmore men's
swim team to assert victory over Drew,
124-77. In the first meet back from the
team's winter training session in Puerto
Rico, Lillvis proved that the weeks of
training paid off.
Head coach Sue Davis predicts that
Lillvis will improve upon his impressive
performance. "He definitely will drop
time at the conference meet," she said.

Sophomores Jacob Ross 'O5 and Darshan
Patel 'O5 clocked in second and third

place, respectively, in the 50-yard
freestyle. Whitehead maintained his
domination in the 200-yard butterfly with
a first place time of 2:01.98, and Brian
Rose 'O6 won the 200-yard breaststroke.
The Garnet women had an equally
impressive showing on Saturday, posting
a 108-76 win over the Lady Rangers. Both
the men's and women's teams posted 56
season-best times at the meet. The most
notable of these improvements were
those of first-years Mae Tobin-Hochstadt,
Amy Kapit, and Tara Finley in the 1000yard free. The three women took first,
second and third place in the event.
Stauffer tallied first place in the 50yard freestyle and helped the relay of
Christie Thomm 'O5, Erin Dwyer-Frazier
'O5, and Funk win first place in the 400yard medley relay. According to Davis,
"Katie is great in all ways as a team
member. She is a true competitor, and
each time she swims she swims to do her

best."

Stauffer credits constant physical and

"His Drew [meet] time bodes well for
achieving a national qualifying time at
the championships."
Davis was not the only one excited

mental preparation for her success.
"Before the race, I like to visualize what I

chances at that record, so he was really
psyched before the race. We were all
cheering him on; after all, it's nice for a
Swattie to have the pool record." Patricia
Funk 'O6 echoed her coach's and teammates' sentiments. "John's swim was
incredible, and for him to be able to
achieve the record at this point in the

to be perfect to get a good time."
Swarthmore also found first-place victories with Tara Trout 'O4 in the 400 IM,
Davita Burkhead-Weiner 'O3 in the 100yard freestyle and Laura Fox 'O3 in the
200-yard breaststroke. The relay team of

Stauffer 'O5 said that "John worked very
hard in Puerto Rico training for the 400
IM. I know that this was one of his last

only more success to come."
In addition to his 400-yard IM win,
Lillvis also posted wins in two relays.
The relay of Kaena Horowitz 'O6, Lillvis,
Eric Shang 'O4, and Seth Jacobsen 'O4
took first place in the 400-yard medley
relay while the all-senior relay of Lillvis,

David Whitehead 'O3, Chris Bussard 'O3,

Both teams relied on quick passing to
carry out their intense offensive runs that
elevated the level of athleticism in the
game. As head coach Lee Wimberly put it,
"Saturday's game was just a war, with both
teams playing very hard and very well."
Tied 32-32 at the half, the Garnet turned
up the heat in the second half. Sparked by a

Gustafson triple and two baskets by Dalton
and Pearce, Swat gained its largest lead, 47-

40, with 15:41 remaining. The Mules fought

back to tie the game once again, highlighted by an Aaron Holden dunk with 4:11 left
on the clock. Gustafson sunk his fourth
three-pointer of the game to put the Garnet
back up by two with 1:21 remaining.
Seeking to tie the game, Holden drove to
the basket and was fouled with 11 seconds
left on the clock. He sank both shots to knot
the score at 68-68 and send the game into
overtime.
At the start of the extra period, a Dalton
trifecta gave the Garnet the advantage.
With 1:25 remaining, the Garnet's one-point
lead was restored by Gustafson's jumper,
before Holden countered with a basket at
0:59 to put the Mules back on top. Pearce
drove to the basket with 0.6 seconds

Katherine Reid 'O5, Leah Davis 'O4,

Maryna Pospieszalska 'O6 and Krista
Gigone 'O4 won the 200-yard freestyle.
The men and women's teams take on
powerhouse Gettysburg this Saturday at
the Bullet's home pool, but the greatest
challenge still looms a month away. "We
will prepare for this meet the same as
any other. We have been training hard
for the entire season, so obviously we
don't plan to swim our best times at this
point," Funk said. "Unlike other sports,

the ultimate goal is the Conference
Championship meet, which remains our
primary focus throughout the season."

Sapp, Dion annoying
head, constantly yapping, constantly mugging for the television. The unholy
thoughts that crossed my mind each time Sapp was shown are unfit for print,
though they could form a great appendix in my anthology someday.
I am underwhelmed by the majority of the commercials. Two advertisements
truly stuck with me. The first was the Willie Nelson piece where he complained
about his beard burning. There is not much in this world funnier than an old stoner whining about a burning beard. The other is the Osbourne skit. Some may say
that Ozzy and the clan are played out. I say, "Hogwash." Ozzy is funny, will always
be funny, and will be funniest when completely confused by the Osmonds. The overall commercial night is not that great, though. The lowlight for me: saying, "Wow,
that is a nice Chrysler," and then almost hurling when it was Celine Dion behind
the wheel. That one ad summed up my night.
On a more positive note, I am thoroughly impressed by Jon Gruden. I have liked
Jon since he was an assistant here in Philly, but this season has shown him to be a
true genius. This word gets thrown around quite a lot in the NFL. It seems that the
league is polluted with "geniuses" who showed themselves to be nothing special.
For example, Brian Billick was made out to be an offensive guru, yet his Super
Bowl-winning Ravens scored, like, two touchdowns all season. Coach Chucky, on
the other hand, took a dormant offense, added virtually nothing, and made them a
force. He out-coached every foe and called the best games I have ever seen in the
playoffs. Gruden lives up to the hype, which is more than I can say about most of
Super Bowl Sunday.
Except for the hoagie. That was really delicious.

After having scored his 1,000-point
against Ursinus last Wednesday, it is no
surprise that Pearce played such a crucial
role in this conference victory over
Muhlenberg. "Pearce has really stepped up
big-time his senior season, being among the
league leaders in scoring, assists and steals
and having become one of our team's best
defenders," Wimberly said.
Pearce's impressive four-year career has
earned him the appreciation and respect of
both his coaches and his teammates who
have sweat it out with him for the past few
seasons. "While the 1,000 points indicates
that he is a very good scorer, his playmaking, passing and defense have been the
most valuable contributions to the team.
He is having an outstanding year, and has
been great to play with," Josh Loeffler 'O3
said. Highlighting Pearce's ability to spot a
scoring opportunity, Gustafson said, "He
has also done a great job at finding the open
man and creating easy shots for everyone
on the team." The team will miss Pearce's
all-around contributions next season.
The Muhlenberg victory propelled the
Garnet to 3-2 in the Centennial Conference.

After loss to Muhlenberg, women's hoops
bounces back against Haverford, Eastern
BY KATE NELSON-LEE

knelson2@swarthmore.edu
The women's basketball has a saying, "Where there's a
Ro, there's a way." The Garnet went 1-1 on the road before
hosting archrival Haverford last night. The team's recent
successes, including a nationally ranked defense, have been
based around the return of co-captain Katie "Ro" Robinson
'O4 to the starting lineup. The junior hit two major milestones over the weekend, breaking the 1,000-point mark
against Muhlenberg on Saturday just two days before she
broke the school and Conference steals record on Monday
against Eastern.
On Saturday, the team headed to the home of the
Muhlenberg Mules for a Centennial Conference East showdown. Having never won at Memorial Hall in recent memory, the Garnet needed a win to take sole possession of the
CC East.
"Walking into the gym was like walking into a cave; it's
an unusual place." Rookie Jennifer Stevenson 'O6 said. "It
wasn't like I knew the history face to face, but I could feel
the tension in the air."
An early 15-0 Muhlenberg run put Swarthmore behind
22-7 with 8:32 left in the first half. The teams continued to
trade baskets to go into the locker room 35-19 at the half.
Head coach Adrienne Shibles cited "a mental lapse" on
defense for the 16-point halftime deficit.
Forward Ali Wolff 'O5 agreed with Shibles' assessment.
"Offensively we were okay; it was just our defensive breakdowns in the first half."
The Garnet staged a second half comeback sparked by
Robinson's eight consecutive points in a 10-0 Swarthmore
run. Shooting 7 of 9 from the floor and 4 of 5 from the line,
Robinson brought the team within one with 1:58 remaining.
"Ro entered her 'Matrix'," Wolff said, referring to the
team's favorite Robinson catchphrase. "She was unstoppable. Her defensive intensity, including her steals, brought
us back into the game."
Heading into the game needing just nine points to break
the century mark, Robinson broke 1,000 points early in the
second half.
However, her 23 points, seven rebounds and four steals
were not enough for a Garnet win, as two late Muhlenberg
free throws sealed the 55-53 win for the Mules.
"I never doubted that we were going to win," guard
Kristen Lee 'O5 said. "A lot of that comes from the confidence that when Ro gets the ball she's going to score no matter how many people are around her. It was a heartbreaker
that [Muhlenberg] didn't happen for us."
The Garnet took the loss with stride with a Sunday practice to prepare for Monday's non-conference visit to
Eastern. While Eastern is not in the Centennial Conference,

the game was important in terms of the larger picture.
"We've stressed to the team that every game is important," Shibles said. "In terms of regional rankings, all games

count."

Eastern is in the Mid-Atlantic Region along with
Swarthmore.
While Muhlenberg highlighted Robinson's offensive
threat, the Eastern contest was a chance for Robinson to
have a record-setting defensive effort. She needed three
steals to eclipse both the school record held by Nancy
Rosenbaum '96 and the CC record by Amy Kreitz (F&M 'O2)
of 281 career steals.
The Garnet used their full-court press on Eastern, forc-

ing 25 turnovers.

Robinson had a game-high 8 steals to set the records.
While the century mark is certainly a big achievement for

a junior, Shibles and the team seemed more impressed with

Robinson's breaking the steals records as a junior.
"A lot of fans see Ro just as a scoring machine," Wolff
said. "Hopefully now they'll see her as both the offensive
and defensive threat that she is."
"It speaks highly of her ability to play on both ends of the

court," Shibles added.
After getting ahead early on, the Garnet held the lead
from start to finish, polishing off Eastern 64-47. Co-captain
Ali Furman 'O3 had five steals as well as eight points and
four assists. After a quiet Muhlenberg game, Lee had her
first start of the season and chipped in 11 points, including
five treys.
"[Lee] has been knocking down the threes like there's no
tomorrow," Stevenson said.
Thefocus for the Eastern matchup was 'a full 40 minutes
of basketball," Wolff said. "Adrienne focused mostly on

defensive stops."

"We had an opportunity to work on our press, our
rebounding, and executing or offense," Shibles said. "The
team did an excellent job."
Eastern also provided an opportunity for some of the
rookies to get their feet wet. Darcy Nelson 'O6 had a game
and career-high eight boards.
"It was nice to see other people step it up, including
Darcy," Shibles commented.
The team was looking forward to last night's Haverford
rivalry, focusing on playing their game rather than
responding to the Haverford team.
"Rivalries are always equalizers," Wolff said. "Our
defense will lead to our offense. If we keep up our defensive
intensity we'll

be fine."

And, of course, there's always Robinson.
"I think having the back to back [record-breaking
games] will carry her intensity on to the end of the season,"
Wolff said. "It'll help her play even better than she has been

and this will help pick her back up from her injury."
Last night, the Garnet rolled over archrival Haverford
72-36. Robinson paved the way for the Tide, who fell, just
three steals shy of a triple-double. She had 13 points, 12
rebounds and 7 steals in just 23 minutes of play. Robinson
had plenty of help from her teammates, who led a balanced

attack both outside the arc and inside the paint. Furman
scored 12points, all of them from three-point bombs beyond
the arc. Meanwhile, centers Radiance Walters 'O6 and
Jerusha Rogers 'O4 dominated the low post, chipping in with
ten points apiece.

The Tide started off hot, opening the game with 12 unanswered points and finishing the first half with a comfortable
35-18 lead. In the second half, the team's starters spent extra
time on the bench as the second unit easily fended off any
chances of a Haverford comeback.
The team faces Gettysburg on Saturday and Washington

on Wednesday in two Centennial Conference matchups.

Gardner, Golden nab heat wins at Haverford Invite
BY JIM

DALTON

jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

The Haverford Invitational is considered by many to be
the true first meet of the indoor season for the Garnet men's
and women's indoor track teams.
Unlike most winter sports, the indoor track teams are
the most affected by winter break because they are not committed to stay on campus and, for the most part, return
home for the holidays. But according to head coach Peter
Carroll, the main focus of the team this year has been on
preparation, as he has encouraged his athletes to return to
campus early to be better prepared for the rigors of the
indoor season schedule. Because the Garnet did not field
complete squads at the meets at Yale and Dickinson due to
the aforementioned winter break dilemma, the Haverford
Invitational served as a measuring stick to check the
progress of the men's and women's indoor teams in their

entirety.

"The meet at Haverford was a great opener for the team,"
Carroll explained. "It was the first meet where most of the
team competed and most of the people returning from last
year are off to great starts. They are muchfurther along this
year than they were last year. We have a good, solid young
team. As soon as we overcome some injuries, we'll be chugTHE PHOENIX

ging on all cylinders."
For the men's indoor team, hurler Rob Melick 'O3 has
had a great start this season, posting a personal best of
41'1L5" in the shotput at Haverford to grab fourth place. His
early success has placed him in contention for all-confer-

ence honors.

"I really want to throw well for this senior season,"
Melick said. "I just wantto help the team as much as I can."
Harrier James Golden 'O5, who boasts one of the fastest
mile times in the conference, won the second heat of the
men's 5000-meter run in 15:36 at the Haverford Invite. Coach
Carroll is also relying on hurdler Matt Williams 'O4, sprinter Kier Wachterhauser 'O4, distance runner Garrett Ash 'O5,
and first-year standouts Tyler Lyson 'O6, Paul Thibideau 'O6
and Adam Hunt 'O6 to shine during this indoor season.
The women's team sports three all-conference runners
from last year's indoor squad: Njideka Akunyili 'O4, Claire
Hoverman 'O3 and Elizabeth Gardner 'O5. In her first meet

back, Gardner won her heat at the Haverford Invitational
by running a 2:25 800-meter run, one of the fastest times in
the Centennial Conference this season. Akunyili and
Gardner currently hold two of the top three performances
in the Centennial Conference for the 800-meter run this
indoor season.
High jumpers Jessica Zagory 'O5 and Robin Dawson 'O6
January 30, 2003

are also having early success for the women's indoor track
team. Dawson cleared 4'B", her career best, and Zagory
cleared 410", taking home first place in the high jump event
at the Haverford Invitational.
"I think that the overall endurance and strength that
carried over from the soccer season is one of the main reasons why I am doing so well this season, and my coaches,
Jokotade Agunloye, John Jaudon and Pete Carroll, have
emphasized consistency, which was something I lacked last
year," Zagory said. "We've also been working on building a
solid speed base over the first semester and winter break,
and keeping our focus through two months of training without competition has been key to early success for both the
men's and women's teams."
The return of Claire Hoverman 'O3, two-time defending
Centennial Conference outdoor 800-meter champion, from
injury will be a much anticipated one that will most definitely give the Tide a boost at the peak of their season, as
well.
The Garnet indoor teams are well aware that the benefits
of the hard work will be realized when the Centennial
Conference Indoor Championship rolls around on Feb. 28.
"A lot of what we are doing right now is preparing the athletes to have peak performances at the conference meet,"
Carroll said.

David Pearce looks to take advantage of the triple threat against a Muhlenberg defender on Saturday. Pearce,
who iced the Muhlenberg game with a layup in the closing seconds, scored his thousandth point last week.

BY ERIKA DOYLE

edoylel@swarthmore.edu

For the first time in six years, the men's basketball
team defeated conference rival Muhlenberg. Since the
1996 1997 season, Swat has lost every matchup against
the Mules, resulting in an exhausting 10-game losing
streak. Last Saturday, Jan. 25, however, Tarble Pavilion
-

was the site for an intense showdown between the
Mules and our very own Garnet Tide, in which the
Garnet aggressively triumphed 83-79.
The conference win over Muhlenberg was undoubtedly due to the collective effort of several individuals,
but the man of the hour was David Pearce 'O3, whose
driving lay-up through three Mule defenders with 0.6
seconds remaining sealed Swat's exciting overtime victory.

Heading into the game, the Garnet were forced to
adjust their lineup due to the absence of starter Blair

practice last week. With Haxel out, the squad realized
they would be losing their strong pull inside, which
would require others to take a stand, both defensively
and offensively. Stepping in for the injured Haxel, Evan
Gelacek 'O5 started Saturday's game against the Mules,
pulling down seven rebounds with his massive force
inside. Chris Loeffler 'O4 led Swat with nine rebounds,
aiding the Garnet to combat the tenacious defense
played by the Mules.
Leading both teams in scoring, Matt Gustafson 'O5
delivered 30 points and hit 12-of-21 attempts, including 4of-8 from the three-point range. Jim Dalton 'O6 posted a
career-high 19 points hitting seven of nine attempts
from the floor. "Evan did a great job filling in for Blair,
especially on the defensive end. Jim also played great,
as he picked up much of the scoring load that we had
lost without Blair in the lineup," Gustafson said after
the game.
