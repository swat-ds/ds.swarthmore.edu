Endowment ends fiscal
year at over $1 billion

Despite 18.6 percent increase,
administrators say fundraising
is key to future growth

President Al Bloom answers questions from students, faculty and staff at an afternoon tea hosted by
the Living Wage Campaign yesterday to discuss his new health care benefit proposal.

Bloom proposes new benefits
Living Wage Campaign criticizes health plan as insufficient
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

President Al Bloom issued a
proposal on the living wage at a
Sept. 20 faculty meeting that recommended adding a health care
subsidy for low-income employees and their families.
The subsidy, which would ini-

tially cost $lBO,OOO per year,
would grant those employees
who pass a means test the ability
to use their "benefit bank" for
income instead of for purchasing

health care coverage for families.
The means test proves total
household income to be under an
as-yet-undefined amount.

The "benefit bank" is some-

thing offered to employees in
addition to a regular salary that
can either be used to purchase
benefits above health care only
for single coverage, which the
college already provides, or
taken as salary. These funds,
when added to current wages,
create a compensation level of
$10.72 an hour. According to the
proposal, such a salary would be

consistent with the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee
on a Living Wage.
"The absence of healthcare
leads to catastrophe," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l
said. "We thought it wise, prudent and necessary to implement
it."
Bloom's proposal, however,
denied the addition of a childcare benefit and an institutionalized wage increase, both of
which were recommended by the
Ad Hoc Committee.
According to Associate Vice
President for Human Relations
Melanie Young, who co-chaired
the Ad Hoc Committee, the
implementation of the entire program recommended by the com-

THE PHOENIX

mittee would require the allocation of approximately $5O mil-

lion.
The administration decided
not to include a minimum wage
raise to the Ad Hoc Committee's
recommended $10.72 and childcare benefits in the proposal.
The health care benefit
amounts to giving staff a minimum wage of $10.27 because they
will not have to spend their "benefit bank" on health care.
Since the committee did not
formulate a financial plan for its
recommendations, "it was the

administration's responsibility
to determine what is both probable and moral," Eldridge said.
"There were very mixed feelings

over child care," he said.

"But it was the administration's
responsibility to determine what
is both probable and moral, and
it didn't meet both of these criteria."
According to Bloom, a childcare benefits package is not
financially feasible. During yesterday's tea, Bloom said that the
supplement for an individual
recipient could exceed $12,000
annually.

Psychology professor Barry
Schwartz, who co-chaired the Ad
Hoc Committee and was present
at the faculty meeting, said the
opinions and reactions of the fac-

ulty are not homogeneous.
However, he and other faculty
members who are not content
are in the process of drafting a
response to Bloom's proposal.
"I regard the administration's

recommendation as enormous
progress," he said. "But I'm disappointed it didn't go further."
Spanish professor Aurora
Camacho de Schmidt, who was
also on the Ad Hoc Committee,
expressed similar concern.
"We don't think that the

board understands the philosophy of the living wage," she said.
"It is a response to the inhumane

labor market in the United
States."

A living wage is owed to the
to
community,
according
Camacho de Schmidt. "You can't
put academics against a living
wage," she said. She compared it
to "the man who applied the
stone to our buildings [being]
paid half price" because his contribution to the community is
less important than the education his work enables.
The college has considered
lowering faculty pay increases
by 0.5 percent to provide more
funding for a living wage,

according to
Camacho de
Schmidt, but this decrease has

For the first time in its history, Swarthmore's endowment is worth
over $1 billion at the end of a fiscal year.
When the 2003-2004 fiscal year ended in June, the endowment had
grown 18.6 percent to end the year with a value of SLOB billion, according to Treasurer and Vice President for Finance Suzanne P. Welsh.
While the endowment peaked at just over $1 billion in the fall of 2004,
this is the first time it has stayed above the one-billionmark at the end
of a fiscal year.
Furthermore, its annual return last year of 18.6 percent ranks it
among the top-performing endowments in the nation. "We're still getting results from other schools," Welsh said, "but we think that will
put us in the top quartile."
At the end of the 2002-2003 fiscal year, the college's endowment
ranked 14th in the nation on a per student basis. It was third among
small liberal arts colleges, finishing behind Grinnell College and
Pomona College, according to the 2003 endowment study conducted by
the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
While Welsh anticipates last year's remarkable growth in the college's
investments to improve Swarthmore's standing in the next endowment study, that may be just the silver lining to a larger cloud.
According to Welsh, last year's returns only made up for negative

and below-average growth in the previous three years. While the 18.6
percent is a healthy growth rate, Welsh does not anticipate that the
endowment will sustain that growth. She further noted that the college can no longer only rely on the growth in the endowment to

expand its operating budget. "Over that four-year period [starting in
2000], the average endowment return was five percent," Welsh said.
"And that is below what we need for our long-term budget stability.

We're still making up for below-average years."

"We're really going to have to look at
fundraising to be our source of
growth in the future."

According to Bloom, keeping

with other colleges is crucial to

Swarthmore. "I believe that fac-

ulty should be paid according to
the benchmarks we use to attract
the best faculty in the country,"

he said.

Every year, the college spends approximately 4.25 percent of the
endowment. This, according to Welsh, accounts for approximately 40
percent of the college's annual operating budget, with 39 percent coming from tuition and the final 20 percent from other donations. As the
Board of Managers increases college spending at a rate of inflation
plus L 5 percent every year, the endowment must grow between eight
to 8.5 percent for the college to maintain existing programs while
establishing new ones, according to Welsh. As the average growth
since 2000 has been about five percent, Welsh does not see much room
for growth based on endowment returns. In fact, she believes that the

days of relying on the endowment returns for growth are over.
"We're increasing our spending a lot faster than inflation, but
we're not seeing any new growth," she said. "We're really going to
have to look at fundraising to be our source of growth in the future."
As the global markets are not as prosperous as they were five years
ago, the college has placed an increased emphasis on fundraising as
the means to provide economic growth for the college. "Over a period
of the last 25 to 30 years, our endowment grew dramatically from
appreciation," Dan West, vice president for development, said. "But
we do not expect that kind of growth in the next few years.
Development
or fundraising
is even more important to us in continuing to build the endowment."
Currently involved in a five-year capital campaign, the college is
looking to raise $230 million by the end of 2006. With $2OO million of
this money going to the endowment, West understands the importance
of this fundraising drive. "There's just no way to sustain the quality

proposal for its dissimilarity to
the recommendations of the Ad

Council overturns debate funding decision

one abstention to overrule SAC and
SVRC at least $25.

BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu

On Tuesday night, Student Council overturned a Social Affairs Committee decision
not to fund an event during the first presidential debate tonight.
Ethan Ucker 'O7, founder and president
of the Student Voter Registration Coalition,

proposed the debate-watching event
Monday night at the weekly SAC meeting.
According to SAC Co-Director Charlie
Sussman 'O5, SAC voted not to fund the
event because the committee felt it conflicted with a clause in the SAC bylaws that
states "[SAC does not fund] activities
directly related to religious ceremonies or
events which advance political ideologies."
"The debates, while they encompass a
broad spectrum of political ideologies, are
promoting a political ideology. When
[President George W] Bush speaks, he's
promoting his ideology. When [Democratic
candidate John] Kerry speaks, he's promoting his ideology," Sussman said.
After SAC turned down his proposal,
Ucker brought it to the council the next
night. The council initially voted 10-0 with

give the

They subsequently voted 6-4 with one
abstention to give $350
the amount that
Ucker said would be required to cover all
the expenses of the event.
Later in the meeting, after another
round of debate, the council reconsidered
the second vote and decided 8-2 with one
abstention to give only $l5O to SVRC for the
event. Ucker said that he would get the rest
of the funding from the President's Office.
The council overturned SAC's decision
based on a different interpretation of the
bylaw, according to Student Council CoPresident Jyoti Gupta 'O5. "We were against
the interpretation of the bylaw as it applied
to this event," she said.
"This event is something that is not
advancing an ideology and a lot of people
are going to be interested, and it's important in general so SAC should fund it,"
council Co-President Andrew Gisselquist
'O5 said.
Sussman noted that this disagreement
over the meaning of the bylaw is nothing
new. "There's been talk about the bylaw for
about a year," he said. "You can interpret

the bylaws in 100 different ways."
According to Sussman, the council and
SAC plan to meet with Dean of the College
Bob Gross '62 to iron out differences over
the bylaw and to make sure "everyone is on

the same page" about the

said.
The official minimum wage of
the college is $9 an hour, though
no employee is paid less than
$9.60 an hour, according to Smith.
Although this means that with
the addition of the benefit bank
dollar the college's lowest wage is
$10.60, Smith's concern is that the
benefit bank lacks any security
that this wage will remain.
The discrepancy between the
college's official minimum wage
and the real lowest wage could
only be temporary, she said,
because wages are not protected
against a potential recession that
could bring them down to $9 an

hour.

In fact, she said, significant

Schmidt said.
"As we ask ourselves how to
proceed and how to respond, the
consensus among us is expanding," she said.
At an afternoon tea yesterday
and sponsored by the Living Wage
and Democracy Campaign, Bloom
talked with over 40 students, staff
and faculty who attended the
meeting about his proposal.
Bloom was happy with the way
the meeting went.
"It was very productive. The

complexities, and the more likely
that we will come to a resolution

dependent on the endowment, and we've got to keep
that growth on track. It's the primary reason for the
campaign and the point to the whole thing."
At this stage in the campaign, West feels that the
college is right on schedule. "We're at 70 percent over

"We have two and a half years to raise $65 million."

between SAC and the council.
Sussman pointed out that because the
council does appoint the members of SAC
there is an assumption that cooperation
between SAC and the council should be
fairly easy.
"Student Council obviously has faith in
everyone on SAC's ability to make correct
decisions. On the other hand, they aren't
expected to agree with every decision that
the make," he said.
Ucker pursued funding from SAC
because of the level of credibility he felt it
could add to his debate night event. "The
point was that the money should come from
the student body's representatives, which
is SAC," he said. "We wanted the SAC-funded seal of approval to give it credibility."
He argued that SAC should have put
aside funds at the beginning of the school
year to fund election-themed events. "I
think it should have been SAC's initiative

"The last two plus years is the hardest," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said.
"While some will give again, we have to get others to give for the first time," Eldridge added.
In the end, Welsh, West and Eldridge were all confident that the college will reach its goal in the allotted time frame, and they recognized the importance
of the campaign to the future growth of the endowment.
As Welsh said, without this campaign, "we can't
keep increasing our spending rate forever."

to give funds to an event like this. There is
nothing right now that they're considering
funding that is more important than something like this," he said.
Sussman emphasized the role the
bylaws played in SAC's decisions not to
fund the SVRC event. "The purpose of the
committee is to determine events that,
within our bylaws, will be something the
whole campus will enjoy," he said.
"It's not that I'm arguing that they

shouldn't fund parties, but they should
know that their responsibility is to fund
events that represent the things that are

important to the student body... A political
debate is extremely important and I don't

think that's unreasonable," Ucker said.
According to Ucker, the event will be
held tonight beginning at 7:30 p.m. with an

type of political or general expression.
At 9 p.m., there will be a screening of the

SAC issues statement
on DU party concerns
BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu
The
Social
Affairs
Committee issued a statement
this week in response to two
students lobbying the Student
Council last week and requesting an apology for the Delta
Upsilon party on Saturday,

Sept. 18.
Dave McCandlish 'O5 and
Raghu Karnad 'O5 went before
the council last week, claiming
that the DU "Professors and
Schoolgirls" party, which was

SAC-funded, was sexist and
encouraged

types.

McClandish and Karnad

originally sought an apology
or public announcement from
the council, but the council
then forwarded the concern to
SAC, which it thought would
be more appropriate.
SAC discussed the statement at its weekly meeting
Monday night. "We nominated
one committee member to
draft a statement and we
reviewed it via e-mail," according to SAC Co-Director Charlie

Sussman 'O5.

SAC released the following
statement to The Phoenix yesterday:

Pa. Green Party gears up for election
Local candidates address a variety of issues, assert importance of minor parties
BY JULIE BAKER

jbakerl@swarthmore.edu
As the November elections rapidly

approach, new faces on the Pennsylvania
Green Party prepare to introduce diverse
ideas to the political arena.
Contrary to popular belief, the Green
Party's platform encompasses much more
than just environmental policy.
"We're certainly not a single-issue
group," Paul Teese, the party's candidate
for State Treasurer, said.
Teese's economic platform includes
raising Pennsylvania's minimum wage
and adopting a graduated income tax system at the state level.
Green Party candidate Marakay Rogers
is running for State Attorney General on a
platform of placing

a moratorium on the
death penalty, opposing mandatory sentencing and reallocating funding from
state prisons to public schools.
"I think one of the most important
things I can do is prod people into thinking
about these ideas, and with any luck my
opponents will be listening and will realize
that I'm raising [these issues] because people care about them," Rogers said.
The Green Party's refusal to accept corporate donations has forced its candidates to
find cost-effective methods of campaigning.
"We don't have much money, so [the
campaign] is very grassroots. I'm attending every public debate and forum that's
offered to get my name out," Dorothy
Scheiber,

candidate

Representative from Pa.

for

U.S.

Congressional

District 6, said.
Scheiber also campaigns by registering
voters and petitioning on the streets of
Pottstown, Pa.
"Greens are at a serious disadvantage

for TV commercials and other high-budget advertising. But we've always found
that the best way to campaign is to go out
and meet people, which in many ways
builds longer-lasting relationships than a
30-seeond TV spot does," Rogers said.
She, along with Teese and Auditor
General candidate Ben Price, will be touring Pennsylvania during the month of
October to spread the campaign's message.

Tm attending every public
debate and forum that's
offered to get my
name out."
Dorothy Scheiber
candidate for U.S.
Representative
Recently, the Green Party has drawn
attention due to its impact on close elections, a trend that began with accusations
that Ralph Nader's participation in the
2000 presidential election cost Democratic
candidate Al Gore the presidency.
Regardless of scrutiny, the Green Party's
candidates continue to defend their right
to run.

"This

spoiler issue can be
by [presidential candidate]

whole

summed up

David Cobb: 'What some people call spoilers, we call participating in the system.'
The system is set up so that people who
want to run can," Rogers said.
Teese compared the situation to a game
of little league baseball. "The poor kid
who strikes out in the ninth inning gets

blamed for the team's loss.
There were so many factors that threw
the last [presidential] election; people
blame [Gore's loss] on the Green party
because we're an easy target," he said.
Scheiber claimed that a system of
instant run-off voting would solve the

problem.
"If we had instant run-off voting I could
vote for myself and then mark [the
Democratic challenger] for my second
choice. If I got the fewest [first-choice]
votes, the voters who put me as their first
choice would have their second choice
counted ... We would do away with having
to vote for the lesser of two evils,'"

Sheiber said.

Teese agreed that this system is the
solution, but feared that the major parties
would prevent its implementation.
"[Democrats and Republicans] seem to
think that the two-party system has
become sacrosanct and it's their job to
keep it that way," he said.
Despite the controversy, the candidates
are optimistic about increasing public
awareness of the issues.
"As a third party candidate, you get
quizzical looks a lot of the time. I still run
into people now and then who have actually never heard of the Green Party. That's
an opportunity to make a first impression
with them and tell them what it's about,"
Teese said.
Regardless of the outcome of the elections, the candidates feel that they have
succeeded by enriching the political dis-

course.

"A third party, if it does nothing else,
serves to throw ideas out for consideration. With any luck, they're taken into
consideration even if the third party doesn't win the election," Rogers said.

Third parties lack organization on campus
Historically, more students have centered organization around issues than parties
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu
Political third parties have never been a major organized presence on Swarthmore's political scene. Since the
turbulence of the 19605, the Democratic and Republican
parties have held a relative monopoly over organized political discussion.
But these two parties have also never been prime players in the campus political scene. Advocating for more partisan causes often takes a backseat to issue-driven
activism.
Faculty and students, however, have sporadically been
involved with third party movements and ideologies.
This past spring, Maria Macia 'O7 started a group dedicated to libertarian philosophy. "It wasn't really associated with the party," she said. "I definitely don't think [third
parties] have a chance of winning national elections."
Macia is currently the president of the College
-

Republicans.
According to Macia, the libertarian group developed a
core following of approximately seven people and was primarily dedicated to fostering discussion about libertarian

ideas.

In regard to third parties within the American political
system, she did not see Swarthmore students as being
especially open to third-party political organizing.
"Many students are skeptical about the benefits [third
parties] offer to American politics under the bi-partisan
system," she said.
Henry Swift 'O7, who was part of the libertarian group
last semester, emphasized the lack of traditional political

organizing as not being limited to smaller third parties.
"The presence of parties on campus is really small. As
for third parties, there's basically no presence," he said. "It
seems like people are just choosing between Republicans
and Democrats or people are trying to advocate certain

issues."

Dave German 'OB held what he described as an

"exploratory meeting" for a College Libertarians group
yesterday. "What I want to create is a partisan-affiliated
activist group," he said. "The Democratic Party and
Republican Party have a presence [on campus] and it
would be appropriate for the Libertarian party to have a
comparable presence."

Though Macia does not plan to vote for Michael

Badnarik, the Libertarian Party candidate for president,
she noted the value of third-party candidates to the organized political environment.
"Third-party candidates offer a new viewpoint. They
add something because they represent political ideas in
their purest sense," she said.
Dick Gregory, who ran as the candidate representing
the now-defunct Freedom and Peace Party, drew limited
student interest during the 1968 presidential election, political science professor Raymond Hopkins said. "There were
some students who supported Gregory and voted for him,"
he said.

Hopkins noted that faculty were also involved in relatively fringe political movements during this time.
"There was at one point a group of quite radically oriented faculty who were part of the progressive movement
in the late '6os," he said.
Faculty were also involved in counseling students on
September 30, 2004

how to avoid the draft in 1968, according to reports by The
Phoenix in a number of issues published that year.
Hopkins noted that in the 2000 election, Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader attracted some support from
Swarthmore students.
No major political organization was undertaken by
these students to advocate for him or the Green Party,
though his candidacy was a part of the political discussion
on campus.

"Many students are skeptical about
the benefits [third parties] offer to
American politics under the
bi-partisan system."
Maria Macia 'O7
"I think there were a number of students who were
committed to Nader and quite publicly shared that,"

Hopkins said.

Nader is also a presidential candidate in this year's
election, but he is not running as the candidate representing the Green Party.
Ross Perot garnered major support nationwide in the
1992 presidential election and to a lesser extent in 1996, but
his influence also was not significant on campus, according to Hopkins. "Perot was never an important movement
on campus," he said.

Board to meet
this weekend
Members will discuss living
wage, college's image
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu
Living wage will be the primary issue on the table at
the Board of Managers meeting this weekend.
The session, which is the first of the board's four yearly meetings, will begin tomorrow and will last through
the weekend.
Though the living wage is currently the board's main
issue for discussion, a decision regarding the issue is not
expected until the board's Dec. 4 meeting, according to
Chair of the Board Barbara Weber Mather '65.
"Nothing conclusive will happen in October
There's no consensus yet," she said in a Sept. 8 meeting
with President Al Bloom, Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l and students of the Swarthmore Living Wage
and Democracy campaign.
"The plan for the Board of Manager's meetings this
weekend is to have a full discussion of the living wage
issue among board members, in order to better prepare
the board for making a decision at the December meeting," board member Elizabeth Scheuer '75 said in an email.
If the board wishes to implement a living wage program, in part or in full, for the next academic year beginning in July 2005, a decision must be reached at the
...

December meeting, according to Eldridge.
In that case, a financial plan for the program would be

passed at the board's February budget meeting.
Board members expressed hope that the board will
move closer to a consensus after this weekend's meeting.
The board will discuss the issue with Bloom's Sept. 20
proposal to the faculty in mind [see story, pg. 3], but that
proposal will not go formally to the board until Bloom
has a cohesive understanding of the faculty's reaction.

"The plan for the
meetings this
weekend is to have a full discussion

...

As it is usual to discuss the primary concerns of the
college at the first meeting of the weekend, the board will
discuss the living wage issue at its Friday gathering.
In addition to the living wage, the board will discuss
the progress of the Capital Campaign, the college's focal
fundraiser, which is now embodied by the "Meaning of
Swarthmore" campaign, Eldridge said.
The issue of Swarthmore's national visibility will also
be discussed, according to Eldridge.
This will include analyzing the effects of the new
admissions viewbook and DVD, which will be shown to
the board after dinner on Friday. These DVDs will be
sent out to prospective students, beginning in October.
The Student Council will hold a luncheon with the
board tomorrow afternoon to discuss student concerns.
The council hopes to address concerns about the
recent projects designed to increase the college's profile,
council Co-President Andrew Gisselquist 'O5 said.
"The luncheon will be an informal dialogue about the
visibility initiatives and how the Board of Managers and
students think Swarthmore should be," Gisselquist said.
Overall, the weekend will not focus on making large

decisions.
"There will be more discussion than action this weekend," Eldridge said.

Amnesty kicks off year by writing for change
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY NICOLE KAST

nkastl@swarthmore.edu
The new campus chapter of Amnesty
International kicked off the year by hosting the Parrish Beach Blanket Write-a-

Thon last Friday.

Passers-by were encouraged to write letters to world leaders, pick up information
on the organization, and listen to live
music provided by Joe Raciti 'O5 and Evan
Greer 'O7.
The purpose of the event was two-fold.
Amnesty decided to hold the event to publicize the existence of the club. "We want to
get people aware of our presence on campus," Publicity Coordinator Tanya Hoke 'O7

said.
The group also wanted to "give people a
concrete way to positively react to what's
going on," Hoke added.
This included "'writing letters to leaders
involved in major human rights violations
especially
that Amnesty's involved with
concerning Dufar [in Sudan], both with
refugees and women's rights," member
...

Katie Chamblee 'O7 said.
By the end of the day, over 100 letters,
some of which were written and some of

which were pre-written and then signed,
were collected by the group. "I think it's
really cool how everyone comes together to
make a difference in the world," Christine
Duranza 'OB, who wrote a letter at the
event, said.
Chamblee said since the group is still
working on becoming a budgeted charter,
it will need to organize fundraising to pay
for the postage required to send the letters.
The Write-a-Thon is the first in a series

of activities Amnesty International will
host in an effort to educate and motivate
the student body. Over the course of the
year, Amnesty plans to bring in speakers,
host teach-ins and continue letter-writing
in order to create more awareness about
human rights abuses around the world,
Chamblee said.
Swarthmore had not had a chapter of
Amnesty International since the last
Amnesty group on campus fell apart two
years ago. Many of the prominent members of the club graduated, and the charter, which consisted of a half-page description of the purpose of the group, provided
little guidance for the remaining members, according to current member Bella
Liu 'O7.
To prevent the same problems from

occurring in this chapter, Liu and
Chamblee, together with Stefanie Wong 'O7,
Adam Roddy 'O6 and Melinda Lee 'O4
worked over the summer to construct a
new five-page charter that they believe
lays the groundwork for a sustainable
chapter.

As a precaution, the charter holds that
there must be a junior coordinator who is
not a senior to ensure that there would be

someone to lead the club after current officers graduate.
The structure of the meetings also promotes sustainability. The goal is to involve
as many people as possible in the open
weekly meetings so everyone is encouraged to contribute.
"The person who takes the minutes [at
one meeting] leads the next meeting," said
Chamblee. This leader introduces an issue
and usually brings with them an "urgent

action" to be signed by those present at the
meeting.
These "urgent actions" are letters sent
out to all Amnesty International members
by the larger organization "when Amnesty
sees a particularly egregious human rights

abuse." They are pre-written letters that
are intended to be signed and sent to world
leaders, encouraging them to take action.
"The idea is that within the span of a
few weeks, this leader is being flooded with

For now, Amnesty members were
pleased with the turnout at the Write-athon and hope to see interest grow from it.

to get as many people writing letters and

said.

NEWS IN BRIEF
New Dorm will soon get a name, after all
An anonymous donation of $6 million completed the fundraising for the New Dorm last week. The donor, a Swarthmore alumna, decided not to have the new residential hall bear her name.
Student Council will set up a special e-mail address to which
students can send suggestions for a name, along with their reasoning, council Co-President Jyoti Gupta 'O5 said. The council will
then select a list often possible names and this list will be given
to President Al Bloom, who will then give it to the anonymous

donor. The donor will choose one name from this list, which will
then become the name for the dorm.
The decision on the naming process, which was made Tuesday
afternoon at a lunch between senior staff and the council, is a
novel approach, Dean Bob Gross '62 said."Obviously, we didn't
have a lot of precedent for this kind of thing."
In total, the New Dorm financing campaign raised $12.6 million.

Storm causes transformer fire, minor flooding
Heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne caused
some storm-related incidents in the borough of Swarthmore as
well as some minor damage on campus Tuesday night.
According to Swarthmore Fire Company Secretary Bill Titus,
flooded basements along with an electrical transformer fire constituted the main damage in the borough. Additionally, Route 320
was blocked off for a short period of time and the department
was called for an elevator rescue.
Titus noted that the storm caused damage that was less
severe than in other areas of Delaware County. "There were no
water rescues like other places in the county were experiencing,"
he said. "The heaviest rainfall must have missed us."
The campus itself did not experience any major problems.
"We really didn't have a whole lot [of problems]," Foreman of
Maintenance and Trades Bill Maguire said. "We had a leak in
Mary Lyon from heavy rains leaking into the laundry room." A similar leak also happened in the basement of Wharton A/B.

"reads three times as fast in Russian."
When asked to compare the Swarthmore
experience to EHU, Herasimovitch said "I
cannot say it's better or worse, harder or
easier, it's different. I like it."

One of the more notable qualities of

Swarthmore, as Savitskaya pointed out, is
the professor-student relationship based on
mutual respect. "Professors are very
understanding and the dean's office is
always happy to help us," she said.
"The faculty were delighted and made
room for them," Gross said.
The students have been admitted as
"special students," who will not be degree
candidates, International Student Advisor
Gloria Evans said. According to Gross, the
arrangement is for one year, since "EHU
hopes to reopen and frankly we didn't want
them to have to give up students." As such,
the college did not determine a year placement for the students and will not unless
they do eventually transfer to the school.

"At the moment, there is no plan for
them to continue beyond the academic
year, but it is conceivable that, if they succeed academically and establish themselves, they can become candidates for a
degree from Swarthmore," Evans said.
When asked about future plans after
this academic year, Herasimovitch commented that "I'm afraid to think of the
future because I don't know."
"We try not to ask such questions,"
Savitskaya added.
Other EHU students are being hosted at
other U.S. schools, includling Oberlin,
Kenyon

and Cabrini

colleges, according to

Gross.
The

college has received some financial
support from the U.S. Department of State
and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,
which have put a total of $175,000 toward
the educations of the EHU students who are
currently studying the United States,
according to Evans.

Admissions DVD ready to be released to specs this fall
BY AARON WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu
After a film shoot conducted on campus last March,
Swarthmore's new promotional DVD video is now finished
and this October will be sent to all high-school seniors in
the admissions office's current database.
The video is part of three-pronged program directed by
Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O, Vice President Larry
Schall '75 and Director of News and Information Tom
Krattenmaker to present a refurbished image of the college
to high school students and the general public.
Along with the new video, the three directors have
overseen the production of a new admissions viewbook
and are contemplating serious revisions to the
Swarthmore College Web site, the details of which
Krattenmaker would not disclose at press time.
Schall said the impetus to produce the video, created by
John Huberth and Vern Oakley of Tribe Pictures, was the
"trending down in the last few years" of the number of
applicants as prospective students chose "not to apply
because they misperceived the Swarthmore experience."
Bock and Krattenmaker said they thought the college's
previous promotional efforts were not reaching all of
Swarthmore's potential demographics, mainly because of
an "exaggerated sense" of the college as only an overly-rigorous, strictly intellectual institution.

Consequently, certain student groups that had tradiSwarthmore in the past were choosing
other prestigious institutions instead, according to
Krattenmaker and Bock.
The slight decline in the number of applicants in the
past few years, with last year's applicant pool's dropping
tionally applied to

by 4.8 percent, has not affected the college's selectivity
rate, but Krattenmaker said he was "frustrated" with
Swarthmore's public image.
He said he thought that people who have been scared
away by the college's caricatured image before will see the
opposite in the DVD.
Bock and Krattenmaker acknowledged some negativity
toward the recent promotional efforts within the college
community.

"The harshest critics will be our own constituents.
a marketing piece that will highSure, it's propaganda
light the best of Swarthmore but that's what I love about
my job: promoting this jewel of a college."
"The future success of Swarthmore depends on remaining competitive. Other schools have probably passed
Swarthmore in their promoting efforts," Krattenmaker
said.
Krattenmaker realized that Swarthmore's new promotional approach confronts the delicate problem of balancing the college's self-effacing style with the bragging that
the promotions inherently entail. Krattenmaker said he,
Schall and Bock were working very carefully not to create
a flashy campaign, describing the effort as "marketing trying to look like unmarketing."
The DVD itself, is a "deliberately unpolished" effort
which seeks to "do more to capture the essence of student

life," according to Krattenmaker.

The video, which lasts about 15 minutes, focuses on the

daily academic, artistic,

athletic and social contributions

of Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, Chloe Le Pichon 'O5, Joe
Dickerson 'O4, Samantha Graffeo 'O7 and Matt Goldstein
'O4.
The style of the DVD is atypical for college promotional

September 30, 2004

material. Its true selling point, according to Bock, is that it
is completely student-narrated
no statistics or administrators appear, and professors only enter the film when
students enter their classrooms or offices.
"Everyone always remarks how Swarthmore's greatest
resource is its student body," Bock said, adding that by
foregrounding students in this video, they emerge as the
school's best asset. "They each tell their own story," he
said.
The five featured students weave through the video's
narrative, framed by rough cuts and raw sounds, second-

ary monologues by other students, late-nights in dorm

rooms and Philadelphia, and accidental moments caught
by the filming crews.
"It gave, from a student's view, a strong impression of
how fun and exhilarating [Swarthmore is]," said mathematics professor Janet Talvacchia, one of the few faculty
members who has seen the finished product.
She added that the DVD did not "sugar-coat" the intensity of academics, but still properly showcased the college's other identities.
The new promotional materials have sparked at least
one "healthy debate," as the admissions office has not yet
decided how to employ the DVD after the initial October
mailing.

Bock said he is currently considering bids from several
different companies for the video's mass production. After
this, the admissions office will hire marketing consultants
and assemble a focus group to decide how to use the material most effectively.
"We need to stay competitive to attract the right students and bring the whole story, because too many people
are getting no story or a one-sided one," Bock said.

Student Council and SAC are both organizations with
substantive administrative work to do. As such, it's
improper for their time to be spent forming official public
statements on past events, as though students need official institutions to tell them what their collective opinion
should be.
Critics of the decision to fund the DU "Professors and

Schoolgirls" party have every right to hold their opinion
and publicly voice it. However, as long as SAC retains discretionary power over individual funding proposals, confronting SAC with a negative social reaction over this one
decision is the only meaningful way to change their policy. Going through bureaucratic channels to demand an
official apology from SAC (and from Student Council, who
had nothing to do with the decision) may be a pleasant
affirmation of the protestors' convictions, but it ultimately accomplishes nothing but making a great deal of noise
and wasting a great deal of time.

Election flaws
Student Council's constitution specifies that "If the
difference in votes between two candidates
is less than
the margin of error for that election, no candidate shall be
...

declared the winner and a special election shall be held to
fill the seat." It then says, "Special elections shall be held
in the event of election fraud, seat vacancy, or failure of
any candidate to achieve a plurality," implying that a special election for seat vacancy, like our original special
election for Educational Policy Representative, should
have the same status as a second special election due to
failure to achieve a legitimate plurality.
Nowhere does the constitution give Student Council
the power to circumvent the nomination process for the
second special election and use the flawed first election's
returns to hold a runoff. That is partially declaring victory for the top two candidates, which goes directly against
the constitution. It changes the election's results, forcing
students who would have voted for one of the other candidates to instead pick one of the top two. We understand
not wanting to redo nominations in order to save time,
but all the existing candidates should've been given a fair
chance in the second election. Neither candidate should
be rewarded with extra votes that originally went to other
candidates just because election officials couldn't prevent
a high margin of error.
If Student Council wishes to hold runoff-based
elections, it is their prerogative to try to amend the constitution. However, the decision to change the rules for
this single election in order to simplify it, without any
consultation with the candidates or the voters, was a poor
one that skews and delegitimizes its results. This practice
must not be repeated in the future.

Liking women means not patronizing them
Dear Editor:
I would like to express my disappointment at last week's article
"Feminist Fun: I love women, too"
(Sept. 23, pg. 11). As the creative
genius behind the slogan that "drew
in" its author, I take personal respon-

sibility for his attendance at our
meeting, and I would like to apologize to my fellow members for my
cleverness. If I had known that it
would result in a belittling and sarcastic article about our group, I
would have come up with something
much more sincere, like, "Are you
tired of crippling stereotypes and not
being taken seriously in your pur-

suit for acknowledgement and appreciation as a smart, capable woman?
Join the Feminist Majority!" Perhaps

then the author would not have
come. Indeed, although our posters
were fun and lighthearted, our
organization is not a joke, and I
resent that this article treated us as
such.
First, I object to his belittling

characterizations of members of our
group. He describes our secretary as
"clad proudly in her 'This Is What a
Feminist Looks Like' T-shirt" and

her "elation" at his presence, though
"she feared [he] wasn't truly interested in joining." This overly dramatic
portrayal only serves to reinforce the
stereotypical image of the feminist as
a zealous hyper-intense woman who
takes her cause far too seriously. The
author's mockery of our secretary's

T-shirt is further exacerbated by his
comment that, due to the deliciousness of her brownies, "somewhere in
the depths of her closet, she must
have a 'This Is What a Domestic
Goddess Looks Like' T-shirt too." I
recognize

this as

ultimately exposes the author's central flaw in his chauvinistic critique
of our group: He doesn't know anything about women. The author
explains that in order to address the

male members. The implication is to
ask, "How could a group of women be
able to make reasonable judgments
about male issues?" Well, I ask the

can he make reasonable judgments
about what is important to our group
of women? I suggest that before he
judges our group as a bunch of giggly

whether he is really qualified to

The virtue of finesse
A samurai had spent many
years searching for the assassin who killed his lord.
Finally he found, cornered
and disarmed the assassin.
Just as the samurai was about
to dispatch him, the assassin
spit in his face. The samurai
stopped mid-thrust as if the

his sword, walked to his
horse, mounted and rode
away. Puzzled, his aide asked
the samurai why he had not
TARU TAYLOR
killed the man he had spent so
much of his life searching for.
Gadfly
The samurai replied, "When
he spit in my face he made me
angry. I cannot kill in anger."
All dictionary definitions of finesse are that samurai's lexicographical shadows. His sublime self-control, his manly
self-discipline, define the term. Nevertheless, the Oxford

English Dictionary denotes finesse as follows: "Fineness in
various senses; purity, degree of purity (of precious metals);
clearness (of a liquid); slenderness, delicacy of structure or
texture," and "delicacy or subtlety of manipulation or discrimination; refinement, refined grace." The man of finesse is
pure of character. He is as emotionless as water is flavorless.
He values above all his ethical integrity, which he knows to be
the most delicate structure in the universe. His every deed is
of volition, for emotion corrupts, and the deed corrupted by

•emotion is better left undone.
The samurai refused to have his volitional deed of justice
corrupted
by anger
into an emotional deed of vengeance.
For every man who finesses the realm of ethos, there are
masses who navigate the reality of pathos. By spitting in his
face, the assassin tried to knock the samurai from his higher
level of ethics to the lower level of feelings. The assassin knew
that if the samurai had followed through and killed him out of
anger, his deed, years in the making, would have been ruined.
It would have been reactive and pathetic, not proactive and
ethical. It would have lacked finesse.
"Who cares?" says the utilitarian, whose scale of values is
about cash value. He lives in the All-or-Nothing of success or
failure, victory or defeat. His moral universe is Machiavelli's,
where "the end justifies the means." In his world of bottom
lines and end results, the samurai is a failure. He sees the
samurai's crisis, of whether or not he was motivated by
proactive volition or reactive emotion, as hairsplitting irrelevance, for in his world, the profit motive trumps all.
Efficiency is the touchstone of his utilitarian values and of his
Machiavellian morality. The touchstone of our tragic values
and of our Garveyite morality is finesse.
To the utilitarian, the intrinsic value of a deed, its finesse
or gracelessness, matters not. He does not care that the samurai demonstrated a self-command worthy of hero worship. He
does not acknowledge, let alone admire, the noble restraint
which enabled grace under pressure. He is too myopic to see
that if the samurai had killed out of anger, out of resentment
of the spit in his face, he would have committed a deed unworthy of his lord. He sees only the end result of the samurai's
failed mission. He cannot, or will not, see the truth, that the
samurai, by refusing to act out of emotion, fulfilled his duty to
bushido, his code of ethics, and thus fulfilled his duty to his

own integrity.
Like bushido, Garveyism as codified in The Declaration
of Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World is ethical, not
pathetic. The Garveyite revolution is about justice, not
vengeance. The Garveyite must therefore constantly guard
against anger and resentment. Since there are so many ways
of getting spit in the face that do not involve saliva, he must
be ever ready to ask himself, "Am I about justice and equity?
Or am I about vengeance and payback? Am I motivated by
self-respect to stake my claim on behalf of the Negro for
Africa for the Africans at home and abroad'? Or am I motivated by the envy of the slave who, resentful of his master,
would take his place? Is my Afrocentrism about getting back
to the roots of African tradition so as to negotiate the New
World Order? Or is it a knee-jerk reaction to and escapist fantasy from the New World Order? Is my Garveyism about solving the problems of African civilization? Or is it escapist ide-

ology, the last refuge of a dogmatic scoundrel? Am I pro-black?
Or am I anti-white?" The samurai could not kill in anger. The
Garveyite can not revolutionize in anger. His revolution is
not "by any means necessary," for he is about finesse.

Managers mistreat Sharples employees
Increased turnover result of disrespectful work environment, favoritism
Dear Editor:
I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed the many

turnover has occurred, I've discovered how unhappy
staff are with working at Sharpies. And it's not the students; most of the staff members look forward to seeing the students throughout the day. However, many of
the staff members point out the unfair and unprofessional treatment they are faced with by the management. The management

meaning of this amalgamated word, are the type that

A crime must contain an
"actus reus," a culpable
action, not just a "mens rea"
or criminal state of mind.
Though it is morally questionable to imagine or plan
the death of the president,
we do not punish these thoughts. Why? It is the mark
of oppression to monitor the thoughts of others; in a
free society, a person is only responsible for his or her
actions.
Did DU have a tasteless party? Well, I don't think the
theme of the party was socially constructive. But did
DU actually further the oppression of young women by
male professors? No, they only endorsed a sexual fetish
similar to those promoted by the Genderfuck party. Did
Swarthmore err by risking corrupting the weak,
impressionable minds of freshmen (with an average
SAT of 1450)? No, all it did was tolerate a party that
pushed the envelope of sexual preference in a way
many of us disagree with but, nonetheless, is protected
by the ethics that we hold dear as a liberal institution
our tolerance of the sexual preferences of others.
One final point: In a time when liberal ideology is
coming under structural attack by people who will
never come inside Swarthmore's walls, I am a little disappointed that the controversies at Swarthmore
remain cripplingly introspective. While the constant
dialogue is admirable, do not forget the issues that will

The authors of the letter argue that by funding the party the school was
implicitly promoting heteronormative activities that
were offensive and dangerous. Their argument sounds
great, but let me draw your attention to an annual
school activity known as Genderfuck, both SAC-funded
and openly endorsed by the school year after year. It is
common knowledge that this schoolwide activity
includes, in large part, a sexualized standard of dress

September 30, 2004

Dave and Raghu claim that SAC funding is equivalent to
an official endorsement of the moral implications of the
party's theme. The Social Affairs Committee's mandate is
not to maintain the standards of respect in our community
that they suggest, but rather to ensure that we have parties
each weekend. Providing free social events for the student
body is the sole reason for its existence. With this taken
into account, the decision to fund the party was the right
call, as I personally saw as many students at this particular party as I have at any DU party in four years.
By assuming their apparent moral righteousness is representative of the entire student body, those who oppose
the party's funding are ignoring the large portion of the
campus that chooses not to take a party theme as evidence
of a sexually oppressed society and actually enjoys playing
roles that, outside a party, would be taboo. However guilty
such pleasure may be, I believe the number of plaid skirts
walking down the path past the tennis courts that night
showed that it is indeed a pleasure for many. And remember, we are still Swarthmore students. Those of us who
found the theme restricting in its gender roles found many
ways to challenge it from within, from first-year girls in
professor outfits to guys and girls in schoolboy outfits to
guys in schoolgirl outfits.
While I agree with Raghu and Dave as well as some SAC
members themselves when they say that perhaps they
should have examined the theme more closely (the tastelessness of the advertising was DU's own doing), Student
Council or SAC officially denouncing the party or claiming
that it was wrong to fund it would set a dangerous precedent, causing irreparable damage to our social scene. If it
is wrong to fund this party because ofits theme, it becomes
wrong to fund anything else that is in any way exclusive to
any portion of our campus. Not only Sager, which runs into
many of the same gender- and sexuality-based issues as
this party, but also every party with a keg, which no doubt
keeps our large contingent of non-drinkers out of the mix,
becomes unacceptable.
Every SAC-funded event simply cannot appeal to every
student; it is up to SAC to determine if they appeal to a significant portion of us, and in this case they have unquestionably done their jobs.

Though we may make light of
Organic
our culture of academic intensity, it genuinely diminishes
our level of happiness.
We were all attracted to Swarthmore for its intellectual rigor
and passion. Our fantasies of college life included spirited dinner conversations about political events and meaningful latenight discussions about the nature of reality. Clearly, we
weren't dissuaded by Swarthmore's reputation as a workaholic's paradise. We manage to stick up for Swat, insisting to
our friends from home that we really don't spend all of our time
in the library. But while we all know that Swat's weaknesses are
its strengths and vice versa, four years here still prepare us for
almost everything but being happy.
At the beginning ofclasses this year, I overheard a first-year
moan in the bookstore, "My soc-anth class has six books!" My
roommate and I exchanged smirks and rolled our eyes. "Just
wait until the first-year realizes that many professors assign 10,
12, even 15 books to read in the course of a semester," we
thought. After a year or so of this workload insanity, it's easy to
think it's just the reality of college life, that it's like this anywhere. But taking a class with a new or visiting professor who
has yet to be "acclimated" to the Swarthmore culture and still
assigns a "manageable" amount of reading reminds us that life
is different here. Swarthmore professors assign more work than
is physically possible unless we really do relinquish friends or

or both.

The academics, friends or sleep equation doesn't even begin
to factor in everything else that healthy, happy college kids like
to do. Where is time spent on the court or in the gym? Where is
theater, a cappella or improv comedy? Leaving those activities
out of the equation seems to suggest that they're not essential.
As, a result, we feel guilty when we devote precious time to
them. We can't enjoy an evening of Mother Puckers when all we
can think about is that microeconomics problem set we should
be solving or that Plato paper we should be writing.
Swarthmore chose us, and we chose it, in part, because we
were intellectually curious. We were the kids that stayed after
history class because we thought the Civil War was so cool. Of
course, we didn't tell our friends, but sometimes we even asked
our teachers for extra reading on the Theory of Relativity. At
Swarthmore, when it's nearly impossible to finish our assigned
workload, there's little room left for intellectual exploration.
We're not likely to approach a professor asking for extra reading on a fascinating con-law case when the assigned reading list
is already killing us.
Swarthmore's tradition of misery poker games is legendary,
and it takes quite a hand to win. A couple of 10-page papers
won't always do the trick. But that's not to say that we're proud

of our misery poker addiction; in fact, we're kind of embarrassed. Last spring, the college embarked on a publicity campaign to clean up our image. We hired a production crew to film
a video about student life at Swat in the hopes of counteracting
our reputation of being too intense. We also hired a New York
design firm to rework our admissions materials.
But we've got to do more than simply repackage our image.
We need to think critically (that's what we do best, right?) about
what living and learning at a place that both attracts workaholics and creates them means. We need to evaluate whether the
burden that our professors place on us is necessary. And if we
decide it isn't, we need to make our concerns known to the
administration. Swarthmore attempts to give us a deeply
rewarding, intensely meaningful educational experience. If
we're happy with our workaholic lifestyle, then Swarthmore
should keep doing what it's doing. But if we're ready to step off
of the treadmill and choose academics, friends and sleep, then
let's do it.

for the creation of a permanent college committee to oversee the implementation and maintenance of the standard

BY JULIA SMITH
jsmithl@swarthmore.edu

At the faculty meeting on Monday Sept. 20, President
Bloom presented a proposal for changing the college's
minimum compensation plan, but his proposed changes
fall far short of the minimum recommendations of his
own Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage.
President Bloom's proposal is that the college provide
a means-tested family health care benefit to the college's
lowest paid employees. While making sure that all of
Swarthmore's employees can afford health insurance for
their families is a necessary step towards the implementation of a living wage, family health coverage alone is
insufficient. Further, without clarifying the family
income requirements for the means test, the proposal
does not make clear how many low-wage staff members
would be eligible to receive this benefit.
The President's Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage
spent two years researching the cost of living in
Delaware County, analyzing the college's current minimum compensation program, and creating a recommendation for a living wage. They made child-care benefits a
central aspect of their living wage recommendation.
Without a provision addressing the need for child care,
this proposal is not a living wage.
According to its basic definition, a living wage must
reflect the cost of living in a specific area. Many particular costs of living
housing, utility charges, the cost of
groceries, etc.
vary between geographic areas, both in
absolute costs and in the rate at which they change.
Without a provision addressing how the living wage minimum compensation program will be re-evaluated and
adjusted as living needs change, the proposal fails to
articulate a longstanding commitment to the principle
and practice of a living wage. The proposal must provide

letter

to

of a living wage.
The Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage thought
hard about the role the benefit bank currently plays in
the college's compensation program and the role it
should play in a living wage compensation program.
They concluded that the option for low-wage staff to use
the benefit bank dollar as wage, once their health benefits
were fully provided for, was an increase in compensation
that failed to meet the standard of a living wage.
Without a wage increase, employees working overtime will earn time-and-a-half on their current wage, not
on their wage plus a dollar from the benefit bank. And
although no one is currently paid less than $9.60, the official College minimum is $9, and there is no institutional
roadblock preventing the College from paying the official
minimum in the future.
Of even more concern is the tenuousness of the benefit bank dollar. Changes in the benefit bank structure
were implemented just last year. And only through significant objections from the community was the benefit
bank saved from drastic cuts. The benefit bank is not sta-

ble enough to ensure that the commitment to a living
wage will continue to be met in the future. Without a
wage increase to $10.72, as recommended by the Ad Hoc
Committee, the president's proposal is not a living wage.
Lastly, the president's proposal fails to call for the
implementation of a living wage in this fiscal year. It suggests that the implementation could take up to three
years, but leaves no indication as to how or when the
timeline will be decided. The community has considered
this issue for four years; the Ad Hoc Committee on a
Living Wage released its recommendations in February.
Now is the time to implement a real living wage at

Swarthmore.

Voter apathy to blame for election errors
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Randy Goldstein 'os's
piece in last week's Phoenix, "No more margins of error
in voting" (Sept. 23, pg. 16). As a current member of
Student Council and the chair of the last election, I
would like to defend the position of Student Council, as
Goldstein made some false statements and generally misunderstood the nature of the problem we had in the past

election.

I will first concede that Student Council as a whole
had problems running this past election, which probably
contributed to the large margin of error. However, the
margin in this case was not much larger than in past
elections and has sometimes been greater than that.
Goldstein's claims that in a "real" election "there is
no margin of error because the purpose of a democratic
election is to count individual votes as precisely as possible" is simply untrue. After all, much of the debate over
the Florida recounts of
2000 had to do with the difference between Gore and
Bush (0.02 percent of the

vote) being smaller than
the margin of error (0.3
percent). On a smaller

It is sad to see students so bored by the idea of

described as hostile. The reason the paper ballots ar

seriously low turnout online. How many have receivec

Although Goldstein was wrong about margins of
error not existing or mattering in elections, he was right
in saying that the margin of error was too large in this
election. However, this election problem should not be
blamed solely on Student Council, but also (and mostly)
on the voters. Jeremy Cristol 'O5, in "Intra-Bubble
Activism" (Sept. 16, pg. 15), lamented the lack of awareness of campus politics at Swat. Cristol was right: There
is a serious sense of apathy in regard to campus politics
here, something which shouldn't happen considering, as
Goldstein says, that Student Council "is an entity whose
influence has a direct and significant impact on the students' quality oflife during their four years on campus."

It was an up-and-down week for the Garnet volleyball

team

-

Brcmner believes turnovers and slow transitions
were the main flaws in the Garnet's play on Saturday.
"The team started off playing pretty well," Brunner
said. But then Swarthmore turned the ball over, and the
Bullets converted their first goal shortly after. "On the
turnover, they just transitioned a lot faster than we did,"
she said. In addition to working on transitioning and
keeping the pressure on its opponents, Brunner said the
team still needs to gain more confidence and intensity. "I
don't think [the women] always go out there as confident
as I'd like them to be."
"We just didn't play well," Stephanie Chapell 'O5 said
of the defeat. Chapell is hoping the team can rebound
tonight against Muhlenberg, in a home game that was
rescheduled from Tuesday night's washout. "We need to
pick up as a team," Chapell said.
"We have to try to get past that
loss."
Following tonight's contest,
the Garnet will face two more
Centennial Conference opponents in the next week, traveling to Washington on Oct. 2 and
hosting Ursinus Oct. 6 at 5 p.m.

as the women suffered a loss to McDaniel on

Saturday before coming away victorious from a match at
Bryn Mawr Tuesday night.
The win over Bryn Mawr (30-17, 32-30, 26-30, 30-18) was

Swarthmore's first Centennial Conference win of the
season, bringing their overall record to 6-9. Erica George
'O7 had 22 kills and 15 digs in the match for her ninth
double-double this year. Natalie Dunphy 'O5 added 16
kills, a season-high for the co-captain, and Emily Conlon
'O6 contributed 47 assists.
Saturday's loss (22-30, 27-30, 30-20, 23-30) was not without its high points as well, as Patrice Berry 'O6 scored the
I,oooth dig of her career with the Garnet. Against the
Green Terror, George had 19 kills and 28 digs, and
Vanessa Wells 'OB recorded 10 kills. Seven service aces
accompanied Conlon's 29 assists.
"I think [during] Saturday's game we were just a little flat," said Stephanie Koskowich 'O7. "[Tuesday's]
game was a lot of fun. We were all enjoying ourselves,
and everyone was playing well."
Coach Harleigh Leach has been happy with the
team's improvement this season. "We're very consistent
in most aspects of our game," Leach said. Tuesday's performance was an example of how the Garnet women
have gelled recently. "The team executed very well. We
definitely pulled together as a team," she said.
The Garnet will play its next three matches at home,
all against Centennial Conference opponents.
Swarthmore will host Gettysburg at 7 p.m. on Sept. 30,
followed by Dickinson on Oct. 2 at 1 p.m. There will be
an alumnae match at 10 a.m. preceding the Dickinson
game.

Women's Soccer
The Garnet women's soccer team suffered its worst
loss of the season last weekend in an 0-6 shutout by the
Gettysburg Bullets. The loss brought the Garnet to 3-5
overall on the season and evened its Centennial
Conference record at 1-1.
Swarthmore managed only three shots in the game;
last year's conference runner-up kept the pressure on

Garnet goalkeepers Kristen Traband 'OB and Rachel
Jordan 'OB with 25 shots and seven corner kicks. Coach

failed. Reflecting on the game, the team understands that
they need to avoid hesitating to make scoring easier.
Coach Kelly Wilcox recognizes that "we are resilient
enough, [and the game] was a good test for us but not
reflective of the team".
In fact, these ladies seem even more fired up, ready to
take out all their frustration on their next unfortunate
opponent. "We are excited to prove [this game] is an
anomaly," Szydlowski asserted. "The season is a long five
weeks," Coach Wilcox said. "The team's confidence that
they will make playoffs this year is as strong as ever.
The team hosts Dickinson on Saturday for a 1 p.m.
match.

Field Hockey

The field hockey team faced a
difficult challenge in its first
game this past
conference
Saturday when they faced
Gettsyburg, ranked number 15

in the nation. In the words of Co-

captain Emily Szydlowski 'O5,
"Gettysburg had a better day."

Swarthmore lost to the Bullets 05. Gettysburg capitalized on
every chance before the Garnet
could react. "We didn't anticipate them being a fast breaking
team," Szydlowski said.
Although Swarthmore dominated time of possession, the
Tide did not transition well out
of defense and lost momentum

The beasts of the East
Loyal fans, we hear you. You've been filling up our inboxes for days
to remind us that, three weeks ago, we promised some in-depth WNBA
coverage, especially as their playoffs were starting up. How did we
respond? We took a week off and then wrote a sappy article on Mike
Tyson.

So now, with three weeks of intense research behind us, we
return to you guys with the fruits of our labor
no one, except for
us (of course), cares. Sammy's already got his Liberty season tick
ets; he's ready for little Lena Bell to make the jump from middle
school stud to WNBA sensation. But it's a little lonely in the arena

haven't heard who won. So we're
going back to a sport with a fol
lowing (sorry, Lena): the NBA
Here's how we see the Eastern
Conference shaping up come play

off time.
1) Detroit Pistons: gained an
Olympic gold medalist, Antonio
McDyess, and lost a Turkish
Olympian, Mehmet Okur. So
Detroit shed a few fat pounds anc
gained some muscles. But could this backfire? Without a fat guy on the
team, who are they going to pick on? Every group of people, teams
governments, orchestras, etc, whose done a damn thing right has hac
to have one of their own to pick on. So, GM Joe Dumars, listen up
before February, pick up Khalid El-Amin off the Israeli league waiver

wire.

2) Miami Heat: Diesel. 'Nuff said. But if Kobe, Malone and Shaq
couldn't beat the Pistons, neither can Dwayne Wade, Eddie Jones anc
the Big Dookie. And with the loss ofRafer Alston aka Skip to My Lou
the first streetballer to get a shoe deal, to the Toronto Raptors (hmm
streetball in parkas), their street cred just plummeted.
3) Indiana Pacers: Still a solid team, but with the loss of an ath
letic freak, Al Harrington (by the way, we love his game he gets
EVERY loose ball), we see a decline in bench production. Sure
Stephen Jackson was brought in to eventually replace the aging
Reggie Miller, but that's like bringing in Ray Charles to replace Lee
Harvey Oswald.
-4) New York Knicks: Any gains in talent are offset by losses in
lots of them. Trading Dikembe is going to
chemistry and dollars
ruin that locker room
on second thought, he was only there two
and a half weeks. Well, it just shows how dysfunctional the Knick
family is. If the five best Knicks (Starbury, Crawford, Houston, Tim
Thomas, Penny) were on the floor, there would be no power forward
or center. The reason the Pistons won it all last year was precisely
because their best five was their starting five. New York will outshoot Boston in the first round, but if they want to get by Miami in
the second, Vin Baker and Nazr Mohammed better learn how to drop

Go ahead and take a bike
BY MATT DRAPER
mdraperl@swarthmor. e. edu

So the other day, I was biking,
like I often do, when I was accosted by an army of football-headed
gnomes who were threatening
me with poisonous toothpicks.
It turns out that these gnomes
were avid readers and bikers
(about 100 of them pile onto one
bike and work it together).
Having waited many years to

read about good places near
Swarthmore to go biking, they
had reached their breaking
point, and so they loaded up their
toothpicks and marched to confront me, to kindly "suggest" that
I write about nice places around
Swarthmore to go biking.
And so here is my short list of
favorite biking destinations.
Because there are numerous ways
to get to each place, this is not a
list of routes; it is a list of destinations. Because there are no nearby bike paths, Swarthmore bikers
must be creative and improvisational in their approach, and I
hope that everyone unfamiliar
with the area will look at a map
before leaving. I know the gnomes
are enjoying it, but I hope other
readers find it useful as well.
Ridley Creek and Knowlton
Road: If you only have a little
time to spend biking, this is a
good tweener. If you follow Rose
Valley Road for awhile and then
turn left at that weird, threestreet intersection (don't know
how to explain it), you go down a
hill and come out on Knowlton
Road, which runs along Ridley
Creek. This is a nice place to stop
and turn around. If you turn
right on Knowlton, you can find

Park Road, which is a nice wooded road that will take you back
up toward Media as you loop
towards home. Meandering in
this area is fun and is usually
pretty but can be super hilly, so
watch out! Time: Probably one
to two hours. Traffic: Medium.
Scenery: Everything from houses under construction to woods
and creek. Slope: Hilly. Calories
you burn: Mexican Bar.
Ridley Creek State Park:
Located somewhere to the northwest of Swat, Ridley Creek State
Park is a nice little pocket of
woods that holds numerous
(short) hiking trails, campsites
and a four-mile bike loop. If you
have extra time, make sure to
check out the Tyler Arboretum,
because it is really different from
being on campus! Cool and/or
scenic places that you can see on
the way include Rose Tree Park,
Paxon Hollow Golf Course, the
Springton Lake, Crum Creek (its
different upstream, really!), and
Ridley Creek. Time: two and a
half to three hours, round trip.
Traffic: Light to medium (occasionally heavy during rush hour)
Slope: Hilly. Scenery: Wooded
suburbia and some patches of

creek and woods. Calories you
burn: Cheesesteak Bar.
John
Heinz
National
Wildlife Refuge: Feel like going
towards the airport? Then this is
the ride for you. The Heinz is all
that marshland and stuff you can
see from 1-95 when you drive into
Philly, and when you're there its
actually really pretty. The trails in
the park are all dirt, so bring a
mountain bike, but the scenery
really is worth it (plus there are
helpful signs that tell you about

all the birds that you should be
seeing). If you leave via the east
exit and have extra time, you can
also explore Lindbergh Avenue
and the Cobbs Creek Parkway, a
couple of nice streets for biking
(that, consequently, don't take you
any closer to campus) Time: two

to four hours (depending on the

route). Traffic: Heavy on the
main roads, light on the residen-

tial roads. Slope: Pretty gentle.
Scenery: Suburbs, followed by
beautiful marshland, followed by
more suburbs. Calories you
burn: Pasta Bar.
The Ville: Inevitably, this is
the ride that it always comes
down to, because let's face it, who
has even two or three hours to
spend chasing after places like
Ridley and Heinz. Swarthmore,
our own backyard offers a good
variety of hills and flats, lots of
trees, rich people's houses and
safe, off-the-main-road riding. At
the end, you can even take pleasure in using the lone bike path in
this area, a five-minute stretch of

pavement that runs behind the
Crum (accessed by taking Yale
down past ML and turning right
just before you go under the 476
bridge.) Time: your call. Slope:
Varied.
Traffic:
Minimal.
Scenery: Leafy suburbs. Calories
you burn: Caesar Salad Bar.
But really, what I am doing
telling you where to go? This is
just for the gnomes. The most fun
I've ever had at Swat was bringing a bike to campus for my sophomore year and then biking in
random directions until I decided it was time to find my way
home (with varying success). So
if you're feeling the need to get
away, take a bike!

5) Boston Celtics: There's one man and it's Paul Pierce. He's goes
inside, he goes outside; he scores in transition and in the half-court.
But, most importantly, he reads this column! No joke. Ask us about
this. Mad props for Paul; we love you! You'd be the MVP if Ainge didn't build you a JV squad.
6) Chicago Bulls: Talk about MVPs, have you guys seen that kid
from Chicago? Jody Fisher, Eddy Curry, Steve Bartman and Matt
Block are all MVPs in their own right, but they don't hold a candle to
Caesar. We're talking FOF (fresh-off-the-farm) Kirk Hinrich. That's
right, the only man who can hand out seven dimes and look like
Augustus while doing it. You heard it here first Caesar. It's gonna
stick when Kirk blows up the L this year. Plus, we see 'Toine coming

7) Cleveland Cavaliers: "Hakuna Matata! Zyndrunas nigauskas!
Hakuna Matata! Zyndrunas Illgauskas! It means no worries ..."
Actually folks, it means that Illgauskas will have to shoulder the load
with the loss of Carlos Boozer, and that's a lot of worries.
8) Philadelphia 76ers: We only put them at the number eight
seed because we wanted to write about them. Do we think they'll
make the playoffs? Hell no. They lost their heart and cream filling,
Eric Snow and Derrick Coleman, and they got Willie Green running
the point. Athens proved that AI has no answer for a zone defense.
If Philly wants to see a winner, it out ought to check out the birds on

Tide fail to qualify for ITA Nationals
BY MATT SCHILLER

mschHll@swarthmore.edu

Last weekend, the Garnet women's tennis

team traveled to Fredericksburg, Va, to partici-

in the ITA Regionals at Mary Washington.
The Tide women saw success in both the singles
and doubles brackets, but failed to qualify for
the ITA Fall Nationals.
Sonya Reynolds 'O7 breezed through the first
two rounds of the singles draw without dropping
a game. In the third round, she fought her way to
a 6-4, 2-6, 6-0 victory over Leah Weston of
Washington andLee to earna berth into the quarterfinals. She fell 6-16-0 to Washington and Lee's
Lindsey Hagerman, who went on to win the
tournament. Sara Sargent 'O7 and Marissa
Matthews 'O7 also both won their opening
matches before losing in the second round of
play, and Jamie Midyette 'OB won her first-round
pate

match in the Blue Draw.
Coach Jeremy Loomis attributed the team's
lack of domination in the tournament to the
stiff competition. Many of Swarthmore's rivals
boasted talented first-year classes. "Overall, the
tournament was the strongest it has been since
I've been here," coach Loomis said.
In the doubles draw, Reynolds teamed up
with Waverly Lutz 'O7 to advance to the semifinals before being knocked out 8-2 by the eventual champions from Carnegie Mellon
University. The duo of Matthews and Sargent
also made it to the quarterfinals.
"They were solid matches that we needed to
get under our belt," coach Loomis said. "It's a
good starting point for the year."
The tournament was the last chance for
Swarthmore to size up its competition for a
while. The women have concluded theirfall season and will start up again in the spring.

Grilling and
the gridiron
Last weekend, I had the privilege of going home, which
was nice because my mom did my laundry and there was
air conditioning and cable TV. I got the chance to go to a
real college and see what people do at a school where academics are not necessarily priority number one. And thus
mv travels took me to the University of Maryland.
What I found was foreign to the Swarthmore

bubble, something I have
not heard mentioned, let
alone seen, in my time
here: the great college tradition of tailgating. Yes,
tailgating
defined by

Webster's as,

"Having a

damn good time before
your college football team
plays a game by grilling
raw meat outside the game
and drinking cheap beer
with a collection of random people while loudly
ALEX RYAN-BOND
proclaiming the rival footis
Hardball
ball team sucks,"
something rarely, if ever,
mm
seen on this campus.
At Maryland, it is apparently "normal" to congregate
before big football games and party like there's no tomorrow. Now, I surmise that this doesn't happen very much
here at Swarthmore, and this is mostly because we don't
have a football team anymore. For some reason, tailgating
before a big field hockey game just doesn't have the same

Swarthmore (left) scrums against the Penn Quakers in the B-side rugby game on Sunday.

Women’s rugby team pins Penn
BY TORI MARTELLO
vmartell@swarthmore.edu
One kick can mean so much.
One kick drove Buffalo Bills' fans into depression, one
kick made Brandi Chastain rip off her shirt, one kick
changed Adam Vinatieri from a wimpy kicker to a Super
Bowl hero, an* one kick gave Swarthmore women's
rugby a close win in their first game of the season.
The setup was classic. The Garnet battled with the
University of Pennsylvania Quakers so close to the goal
line, the opponents could almost taste victory.
With less than five minutes left in the game, the
Quakers had driven toward the goal line, down 12-10. The
women crowded the ball as the forwards, lead by captain
Olivia Toro 'O5, clashed in suffocating scrums.

After the final whistle blew, the entire team collapsed
from exhaustion. This is rugby the sweet taste of grass,
and a win after 80 minutes of hell, sweat and dirt.
The entire match was a defensive battle. Both teams
had to fight hard just to move the ball a few feet. Since it

was the first game of the season and both teams were a
bit rusty, there were plenty of errors and scrums. With
five visits from the trainer during the match it was clear
that the physical play began to wear on the players.
The Quakers drew blood first as a the speedy wing
Myra Kate Vallianos 'O5 raced in to score a try early in the
first half. After falling behind, our ladies battled back with
another try by Ele Forbes 'O5. Captain Katie Merick 'O5
made the kick to put the Garnet ahead, 7-5, before halftime.
In the second half, both teams managed to score
again, but neither made their kicks, which led to the
ending goal line stand. With both teams' fans screaming
at the players, the Swarthmore rugby team's concentration and determination in those closing minutes were
unmatched.
Even after that hard-fought game, both teams came
together to socialize and appreciate all the effort these
ladies put forth in preparing for these games. In the end,
the Swarthmore ladies prevailed and could spend the
remainder of their Sunday resting, satisfied with their
hard work.

Men's rugby falls to Widener

co-captain Randy Goldstein 'O5 said

Saturday.

recovered the ball, and ran it in for

Turning these mistakes into a

lesson the men's rugby team drew
from that game. The team was confident going into the match.
"We should have won," Goldstein
said. "We are the more experienced,
well-rounded team." Unfortunately,
the team failed to come together for
this contest, losing, 31-10.

THE PHOENIX

score. Fullback Tevye Kelman 'O6

the first try of the game.
But the men eventually fell
behind as Widener's constant enthusiasm and energy took its toll.
Even after rookie wing Christian
DeSimone 'O6 scored a try, the men
could not find the drive to mount a

comeback.

"We always had opportunities but
lacked the heart," Goldstein said.
"[We must] work on coming together

as a cohesive unit".
This message was hard-learned,
but at least the Buzzards can look
forward to better play in the future.

Though the loss may have hurt
their pride, the rugby team is fully
prepared to bounce back. The squad

is stacked with seniors who know
how to guide their teammates and
instill an optimistic attitude. Now
that they have identified the problem-areas, these guys are confident
that their next matches will be even
stronger.

appeal.
I think it's pretty self-evident that grilling, tossing a
football around, and hanging out with your friends and a
six-pack is pretty sweet. So, I'm going to shift gears and
focus on why we don't have this tradition at

Swarthmore.

For some reason, tailgating before a
big field hockey game just doesn't
have the same appeal.
Screw badminton, I want football.

That's right, I want college football on a crisp fall
Saturday afternoon, and I want to enjoy it at my own
school in person, not on the cable TV we don't have in
our rooms. I feel cheated out of my college experience.
If a liberal arts college is supposed to provide me with a
complete college experience, I think cheering on my own
football team should be part of that experience. It costs
upwards of $40,000 per year to go here; I seriously don't
think it would hurt this place to toss some money toward
having a football team. They certainly have the money,
because they certainly aren't spending it on students or
athletics facilities. So come on, give us some college foot-

ball.

When they cut football here over four years ago, they
made the argument that cutting football would increase
the academic prestige of this grand institution, because
football players were bringing down Swarthmore's academic ratings. They tried to cut "dumb jocks." What they
ended up cutting was school spirit. Fall Saturdays on this
campus are full of soccer, field hockey, volleyball and
hangovers. Occasionally, people wander over to Clothier
field to see what's going on. Few.stay. Most people think
about work they have to do or how drunk they're going to
get that night.
There's no school spirit. Nobody cares about
Swarthmore athletics, or about how hard our athletes
work because no single sport brings the student body
together every Saturday in the fall. It makes me long for
high school, when you could expect to see everyone at the
game Friday night, no matter what.
So, bring back tailgating. Bring back school spirit.
Bring back football. Or at least give me my money back.

Cross country takes 4th and 11th at Lehigh
In first career meet, Sarah Hobbs finishes second among Divsion II and 111 runners
BY DARCY NELSON

She makes it look so easy.
When most people join a cross-country team, they slowly work their way up to a top finish. Sarah Hobbs 'O6 needed no such progression. In her debut cross-country race,
Hobbs sailed to a second place finish amongst runners
from Division II and 111, at the 31st annual Lehigh
University Paul Short Run.
"In the first track meet I ever ran in, I was warming up
and I had never worn spikes before and I totally wiped out
in the middle of the track just minutes before the start,"
Hobbs said. "Well, this was my first cross-country race,
and I tripped over Kavita Hardy 'OB and fell on my face
about 50 feet into the course. She was bleeding, and I was
on the ground, so I figured it could only go up from there."
With a time of 22:34.14, Hobbs was eight seconds behind
the first-place finisher, Kutztown's Molly Lare. While
Hobbs' race result would suggest that she is a
veteran cross-country runner, she was not so calm.
"I was really nervous," Hobbs said. "Watching the boys
finish made me really nervous. They were crossing the
line, throwing up on themselves and barely able to stand. I
was thinking, 'Hmmm, I signed up for the wrong sport.'"

16

She was pleasantly surprised by the end of the race. "It
went well and I had a vomit-free finish," Hobbs said. "So I

don't think I have to quit just yet."
Her performance is more remarkable considering she
went on to participate in a soccer game later that day. She
had also had a soccer practice or game each day that week,
since she is participating in both soccer and cross-country.

"I totally wiped out in the middle of
the track, just minutes
before the start."
Sarah Hobbs 'O6
Carrie Ritter 'O6 followed Hobbs with a 23rd place finish
and a time of 23:0616. In 30th, Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 came
in at 24:28.07. Pam Davis 'O7 and Emily Wistar 'O6 followed
up the pack, crossing the finish line together at 37th
(24:50.49) and 38th place (24:5160). The team finished with a
total score of 124points, earning them a fourth place spot.
On the men's side, James Golden 'O5 ran the 8K course
Seotember 30. 2004

with a time of 26:37.49, earning 31st place overall. Golden
was followed by Adam Hunt 'O6 who came in 56th with a
time of 26:56.71, a personal record for Hunt. The next Garnet
runner to finish was Keefe Keeley 'O6, who also ran a personal best time. Keeley came in at 27:17.00, earning him 60th
place. Garrett Ash 'O5 came in 69th at 27:53.40 and Jim Kreft
'O6 followed right behind in 70th with a time of 27:56.58.
The Garnet finished 11th overall. "We came in second-to-

last place, so we didn't feel too happy about our race as a
team," Golden said. The men's team, however, was running

against some Division I and II teams. Also, Lang Reynolds
'O5, who came in first at the conference championship meet

last year, was not able to run Saturday because of an injury.
"That obviously hurt us a lot," said Golden.
"Given where our training is right now, our top three
guys ran what we should be running. But considering
Lang [Reynolds 'os] wasn't running and Garrett has been
injured, this race really wasn't indicative of what we can
do as a team," Hunt said.
Nevertheless, the Garnet has good things to look forward to. "Our freshmen did really well," Golden said. "It
will be nice to have a couple of them run in the varsity

race next time."

The teams will travel to Dickinson on Saturday to race
in the Dickinson Long/Short Meet.

TO

GO

How about watching a tornado blaze through Kansas?
And I don't mean "The Wizard of Oz."
Why is The Weather Channel suddenly an option for
providig your weekend kicks? Because when a tornado
towers above you 16 meters high or a tidal wave 22-meters
wide rushes past with a velocity that puts the "force" in
"Forces of Nature," it gives a whole new meaning to
"cloudy with a chance of showers."
For "Extreme Weather" and other forms of extreme
video, look no farther than the IMAX theater at
Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, a breathtaking experience that, for a mere eight bucks, submerges the audience
in film and fury.
IMAX has the gift of making the audience feel as
though it is part of the film. The screen curves around the
seats, allowing you to be utterly enveloped by the beautiful cinematography as you scale volcanoes and dive into
oceans. For movies, size does matter, and IMAX is nature
up close and personal, bigger and better and cut into nicely manageable, affordable

chunks.

IMAX documentaries tend to concentrate on the natural world
Mother Nature is ready for her close-up. And
though her sweeping vistas are displayed to their best
advantage on a larger screen, the beautiful presentation
probably won't teach you anything new. The flashlight of
enlightenment that is IMAX is a bit low on batteries. The
scripts, such as that for the recent "Forces of Nature,"
tend to focus on common knowledge: for example,

"Volcanoes are bad" or "Earthquakes are bad" (I'll leave
you to imagine their shining illumination on the subject
of tornados).

Anyone disappointed that they haven't had a fulfilling
learning experience has missed the point. IMAX films
don't overwhelm with facts; they dazzle with images. Who
cares why volcanoes erupt? We just want to see the things

explode. And in the excellent Tuttleman IMAX facilities,
explode they do, in crisp, high-definition images and
pounding surround-sound.
The Tuttleman IMAX is an excellent screening venue.
The theater was nearly empty for "Forces of Nature,"
allowing me and my roommate to snag the best seats in
the center, though on a crowded day you may be out of
luck (IMAX doesn't really work from the front row). It's
impossible for anyone sitting in front of you to block
your view of the film, no matter how impressive her

afro.

However, be forewarned that there is an inverse relationship between how easy the IMAX is on your eyes and
how good it is for your stomach. The Franklin Institute
doesn't serve popcorn before the show for a reason.

Though there is a small cafe in the theater lobby, I urge

any movie-goers, for the sake of their health and the man
sitting in front of them, to resist its aUure. There's nothing quite like a plunging, spinning drop through the center of the Earth to make your turkey sandwich return
from whence it came.
But for the strong of stomach and the unorthodox of
cinematic taste, the Tuttleman IMAX at the Franklin
Institute is perfect. Its spacious seating and easy-to-reach
location, a short walk from Suburban Station, make it a
comfortable and convenient getaway at anytime. Sit back,
relax, and appreciate theater at tornado velocity, because
Dorothy, you're not in Kansas anymore.
"Titanica" and "Lewis and Clark: Great Journey West"
are currently playing on the IMAX screen at the Franklin
Institute. For more information on the museum and showtimes, visit sln.fi.edu/tfi/info/omninow.html.

Founded in 1805, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts is the oldest art museum in the country.

If you're looking for a variety of musical adventures in the upcoming months, Philly is the place to
be. Indie, classic rock, hip-hop and jazz fans all
have plenty of choices.
Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M. and Bright Eyes will
cater to both classic rockers and hipsters on the
opening night of the Vote for Change Tour. The
tickets sold out in a few minutes, but that doesn't
mean scalping or begging isn't a valid option.
Ticket sales benefit MoveOn.org, a group dedicated

An on-Slought of groove
Foundation's 'ars nova workshop' honors contemporary improvisation
BY NASH ADAMSON

BYJOEKILLE

The Slought Foundation, a non-profit arts organization
founded in 2002, began its 'ars nova workshop" two weeks
ago with a lyrical introduction to what soon became an
improvised explosion: Ken Vandermark softly flicked the
reed of his bass clarinet, and Mats Gutstafsson squeaked and
chimed his tenor saxophone above Peter Brotzmann's lower
octave clarinet melody. All three have been at the vanguard
of improvised music for ten years, Brotzmann for more than
30. But by the time Brotzmann began his first solo, there was
no tangible melody to be found. In order to appreciate the
music, which often comes closer to a baby crying thana clarinet swinging, the listener has to accept the most basic commandment of free jazz: Quit tapping your foot. A few listeners in front of me still tapped and swirled as if they had been
able to find some secret beat in the unstructured improvisations, but no such pulse needs to be found. As Vandermark,
Gutstafsson and Brotzmann cycled through different saxophones and clarinets (as well as Gutstafsson on flutophone),
it became increasingly clear that this music was not your

daddy's swing.
Just as bop musicians of the 40s and 50s devoted themselves to finding beautifully swinging solutions to the 11-V-I
progression and standard blues figures, Vandermark,
Gutstafsson and Brotzmann, along with their peers, have
mastered the overtones, experimental embouchure techniques and resounding cries that characterize contemporary free improvisation. There is no need to search for contemporary music's roots in the 40s in order to appreciate it
today. I'm not saying I get it, I'm just proposing the window
through which one might look for a place to start grasping.
This was the loudest concert I have ever been to. I spent
much of the show reminding myself that all of this noise was
coming from three reed players. I had seen all three performing with Brotzmann's Tentet a few years back. Here, the
same fierce improvisations were stripped of all percussion
and backing instruments. To hear this music on a recording
would be at times painful and immensely challenging. To
hear and see this music performed live was sometimes taxing but always captivating and, in the end, a hell of a lot of
fun
not something that can always be said about freely
improvised wailing.

To hear and see this music performed live was a hell of a lot of
fun not something that can
always be said about freely improvised wailing.
...

Critics love to come up with artistic spheres of influence,
tables displaying which artists directly influenced which
other artists and how. Vandermark, Gutstafsson and
Brotzmann might all be found within the sphere of Albert
Ayler, a free jazz giant (if there ever was such a thing) whose
massive tone and relentlessly free improvisations have
inspired a generation of improvisers. But unlike many from
Ayler's camp, Vandermark, Gutstafsson and Brotzmann
have a layer of melodic accessibility in their work. The combination of the intense emotions found in free-form playing
and the virtuosity found in this performance makes a show
with any of these artists highly recommended.

When it comes to getting the hest national and
local acts into small- to medium-sized, all-age Philly
venues, no other production company can hold a
raised cigarette lighter to R5 Productions.
Nobody pleases the hipsters like Sean Agnew's
show promotions agency. The company's policy is to
acquire intimate spaces (churches, warehouses, halls,
your basement, etc.) and put on amazing shows for
what has become, by comparison, a ridiculously
cheap entrance fee. With most shows costing between
$5 and $8 and big Indie names like Faint, Sufjan
Stevens, John Vanderslice, RJD2, Yo La Tengo, Ted
Leo, and !!!, just to name a few, R5 continues to infuse
Philadelphia with music and bands that otherwise
may very well have passed right over the city on thenway from Washington to New York.

With the rise of the Evil-OctopusDescending-Over-the-Globe
concert/radio/production monopoly, Clear Channel, the separation
between fan and artist has been
growing at an alarming rate.

you don't want to leave your room, there is much to be seen
and heard at slought.org. One hundred eighty-five hours of
recorded audio are featured on the Web site's "online content" section, including an unreleased interview with John

Rs's greatest advantage is that they are a' local
agency that actually produces their own concerts. The
agency rents out sound equipment and transforms

each of the venues from their day-to-day operations
into unique and convivial concert locations. At a concert I attended last spring at the First Unitarian
Church, performer John Vanderslice told the crowd
about his experience setting up his equipment in the

keep the toddlers from interacting with "the evil rock

With the rise of the Evil-Octopus-Descending-Overthe-Globe concert/radio/production monopoly, Clear
Channel, the separation between fan and artist has
been growing at an alarming rate. To accommodate
and take advantage of larger crowds, most venues
have barriers between the audience and stage and
charge ridiculous prices for terrible food. (If someone
walked up to you on the street and offered you a pretzel for four dollars, honestly, would you stop?) It's as if
we've become toddlers and the bands have become
"evil rock and rollers." The opportunity to see an upand-coming, presumably very talented artist
in an
intimate setting not designed to sap you of your
money and your will to interact withthe performer
is a rare occurrence these days. Throw on top of this a

for some of the larger venues, and add to that the
surcharge that Ticketmaster charges, and maybe
going out to hear some new music won't seem so

A night of four-Starr dining

BY BENJAMIN KABAK
Eat your way through Philly's famous
themed restaurants, one paycheck at a time AND JASON PERINI
Pod, Morimoto, Tangerine.
As Philly restaurants go, you might as well
call them Hip, Stylish and Trendy. For some food
connoisseurs steeped in the cult of irony, this
might mean Tacky, Overpriced and Yuppie. Who
needs all that artificial atmosphere anyway? It's
all about the food, right? But for others who enjoy
a good meal in a creative environment, the
Steven Starr restaurants might just represent the
pinnacle of Philadelphia's dining scene.
Besides, ironic distance is hard to keep when
you suddenly find you come face-to-face with a
waterfall and a giant Buddha statue inside the
restaurant.
Steven Starr, the owner and founder of the
eponymous Starr Restaurant Organization, is a

man who has made a career in industries that
require more than a little style along with the
substance. He's been a nightclub owner and a
concert promoter. For the past ten years, he's
tried his hand as a restaurateur with
Philadelphia serving as his playground, developing one high-concept hit after another, from a
futuristic sushi restaurant in University City,
complete with a conveyor belt delivering tuna
rolls to your seat, to a classic diner turned into a
tapas and martini bar in the heart of Olde City.
Sure, dining out is supposed to be about the
food, but if the meal is significantly better than
Sharpies
a test which none of these restaurants
fail it's fun to go along for the ride in some of the
more uniquely designed restaurants around.

There's just one warning: For all you
poverty-stricken college students, the best time
to go to any of the Starr Restaurant
Organization establishments is when your parents are in town. These restaurants certainly
don't skimp on costs, and it's easy to get overwhelmed by the prices and the good food. Forget
about ordering a drink if money is on your
mind. You can certainly get away with a fairly
small bill if you stick to appetizers or an
evening at Continental, Starr's most reasonably
priced restaurant. But why bother making that
reservation weeks ahead of time, if you can't
get the whole dining experience? Plus, just what
are your parents' wallets for, if not to splurge

on a little something now and then?

MexicanElvsa

Lounging around Olde City Iron Chef Japan and
the weekends, it might also be his most pretentious
location. Those familiar with martini bar and
restaurant dives in New York or Los Angeles will
recognize the idea behind Continental, located
prominently on the corner of 2nd and Market
Streets, across from the entrance to Penn's
Landing. Nevertheless, Continental serves up generally excellent food, with a wide variety of world
fusions dishes and an extensive tapas menus. While
the lobster mashed potatoes received a thumbsdown from a Penn student quite familiar with
Starr's restaurants, the barbeque quesadillas, tasty
stir-fry and vegetarian-friendly tofu-on-a-stick get
high marks.
From the outside, Continental has the look and
feel of an old-time diner. The metal paneling and
full-sized windows, with glimpses of the booths lining the restaurant, lend Continental an authentic
feeling. Step inside, and the decor is classy with a
touch of whimsy: The lights are giant toothpicks,
stuck through olives, hanging above the tables.
With a full bar running the length of the diner car,
the main thrust of Continental is its bar scene.
Popular for its martinis, these babies will set you
back at least $7 a drink. Additionally, the margaritas, aptly nicknamed Mexican Prozac, were voted
Best in Philly. If you're heading to Continental on
the weekend, be wary of long lines; the wait stretches down the block on busy Friday and Saturday
nights. You could always check out the newer incarnation, Continental Midtown at 18th and Chestnut
Streets, but with limited nightlife options around
the working hub of the city, the newer location
draws more on the work crowds during the week.
Olde City is, after all, the place to be on the week-

ends.
Washington Square
For a

more laid-back bar scene, head to

Washington Square. The place is perfect for the
early fall weather: It's outdoors, snuggled in a wide
alleyway between two tall buildings across the park
Washington Square, and
you guessed it
from
only light, airy sheets stretched between the buildings obscure your vision of the night sky. A great
place to go for a romantic dessert or drinks in the
early evening, Washington Square features a seemingly limited menu, but chef Marcus Sameulsson,

who was born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden,
does a masterful job mixing up creative dishes. The
most popular dish, sauteed shrimp with a pumpkin
seed sauce and avocado, will set you back $24, and
the beef stir fry with red onions, tomatoes, and chili
costs $22.
As at Continental, the drinks at Washington
Square are a big draw. With big pillows and plush

couches, much of the restaurant seems like an
upscale version of any lounge. The after-work
crowd frequents the outdoor patio area during the
week, and the place is another big Friday and
Saturday night draw. Come for the pear mojitos;
stay for the grilled lamb chops with peanut-chili

sauce.

Buddakan

In Olde City, on Chestnut Street between 3rd and
4th, there sits an old golden Buddha. This statue
does not dispense words of wisdom. Rather, it is the
guardian of diners at Starr's ode to Asian Fusion
cuisine, the Buddakan. Situated just a few yards
away from the Ritz theaters, Buddakan oftentimes
looks more like a highly selective nightclub than a
restaurant. But step inside, and prepared to be
awed by the decor: A giant waterfall occupies center stage and the golden Buddha has become famous
through Philadelphia. There's no doubt that the
main draw of Buddakan is the impressive interior.
Located in an old post office, the Buddakan (along
with Pod) is probably the pinnacle of Starr's vision
for an out-of-body dining experience.
Once inside, the food takes second stage to the
decorations. Brian Hertler, a University of
Pennsylvania student who is making it his business
to eat at every single Starr restaurant by the time
he graduates, summed up the dining. "The food was
really cool-looking," he said, "but about the same
quality as a regular Chinese place." In other words,
it's your typical Asian fusion restaurant: good
decor, mediocre dining. As with all of Starr's locations, however, the drinks are key. From the Sumo
in a Sidecar (brandy, sake, sour flavoring, and some
apricots) to a Jade Dragon (sake, midori, Cointreau,
and lime), you're bound to be satisfied on that front.

Tangerine

For his last Olde City effort, Starr went with the

Mediterranean-themed Tangerine. Located on
Market Street just up the block from Continental,
Tangerine is yet again another lounge-restaurant
combination. Sensing a theme yet? While you're
greeted with a plush lounge and orange-lit bar, the
focus this time is much more on the food than on
anything else. With a great grilled octopus salad
and a stunning spiced whole bronzino with cucumber-tomato salad and cilantro rice pilaf, Tangerine
is not short on scrumptious food. In fact, it probably
represents the highlight of Starr's efforts at crafting
a restaurant. The best way to make Tangerine
affordable, as with all of the food-focused Starr
restaurants, is to share. The bronzino, a delicate
Mediterranean fish, at $28.50, is quite expensive,
but for two, the meal is immediately more affordable. The desserts, too, are to die for. The banana
creme brulee is top-notch, but the real treat is the
chocolate intrigue: a warm chocolate cake with a
chocolate ice cream terrine and spiced espresso
whipped cream.

Jones

Heading out of Olde City, Starr restaurants
permeate the dining landscape with three of
them alone on the 700 block of Chestnut Street.
Walking west, the first of the trifecta is Jones,
a restaurant billed as featuring American

comfort food. For Hertler, our Starr connoisseur, Jones is his favorite for one simple reason: "It's the cheapest," he said. In the world of
Steven Starr, however, cheap is always a relative term. The sesame-seared tuna with
coconut rice, snow pea salad and wasabi-sweet
soy sauce will still set you back $l9, but you
can get a good cheeseburger for just $8 and
meatloaf for $l3. Additionally, Jones has what
every child most desires: a chocolate chip waffle with whipped cream and, of course, powdered sugar for just $7.25. Featuring classy
American ales on the drinks menu and a
banana bread pudding for dessert, Jones is the
Starr restaurant for college students: cheap,
unpretentious in presentation, and with food
that's simple and good.
Angelina
Next door to Jones is Angelina, Starr's
a Philly favorite: Italian food. While
neither of us nor our Penn Starr expert have
been to Angelina, the folks over at
Citysearch.com give the Italian joint a fairly
decent write-up. Featuring "hearty, home-style
northern Italian fare," Angelina seems to be
fairly inside the box for a Starr establishment.
Its menu features roasted meats, sauteed fish
dishes, and pasta and salad dishes that would
be at home on any Italian restaurant's menu.
The frozen tiramisu is said to be among the
best of the Starr desserts.

Starr's first restaurant in the City of Brotherly
Love, this popular Olde City hang-out may be his
least pretentious. Of course, based on the hipster,
20-something crowd that frequents Continental on

Pod
There's one more stop on the Starr Restaurant Organization tour. On
Sansom Street at the Inn at Penn, in the heart of University City, sits
the futuristic Pan-Asian/sushi restaurant Pod. Known throughout

Philadelphia for its futuristic design, its glowing lights, its conveyor
belt of sushi, and its, well, pod-like seats, eating at Pod is like having
sushi on the set of Star Trek. While there is no Captain Picard, visitors
to Pod can watch old foreign movies with no sound or subtitles, on TV
screens placed throughout the restaurant. While it's easy to believe that
Pod might be trying too hard to be too futuristic, the restaurant is seemingly over-the-top without coming across as too tacky. It's just yet
another unique dining experience from Steven Starr.
There's no point in providing food recommendations for Pod. While
the hot dishes are good, stick with Morimoto for those. The sushi is the

menu featuring 18 different kinds of beer, by

Striped Bass
On the corner of 15th and Walnut Streets sits
a classic Philadelphia seafood establishment,
the Striped Bass. This Philly landmark closed
in December 2003, and Stephen Starr reopened
it this past April. Start with goat cheese salad
with citrus flavors for $l3, move on to the miso
marinated black cod for $3l, and finish up with
the duo of creme brulee (bittersweet chocolate
in one cup and orange cardamon in another)
for $9. It's upscale classy, and another prime
joint for a night out with your parents.
Alma De Cuba
Before leaving Center City, there's one

more Starr restaurant on our trip west. On

Walnut Street between 16th and 17th sits yet

another wildly popular restaurant in Philly's
revitalized dining scene, Alma De Cuba.
Featuring Modern Cuban food in a colonial
Cuban setting, Alma De Cuba is a tribute to
old-time Cuban soul food. Start with one of
seven different civiche dishes, featuring
everything from lobster and crab to Spanish

mackerel. The menu's highlights are lamb
with mint leaves and halibut covered with bits
of fried plantains. The adobo rack of lamb for
$2B and the Chilean sea bass enchilada for $23
are among the crowd favorites. Don't miss the
pineapple semifrio also. For $B, it's a pyramid
of frozen pineapple mousse with orange sorbet, coconut shortbread and a pineapplevanilla mojo.

WHERE

it's it. Are Steven Starr and his Starr Restaurant Organization
e cracked up to be? Sure, if you have deep pockets and a taste
ture and exotic flavorings. Otherwise, these 11 restaurants are
her attempt to meld food and entertainment while charging an
la leg for it. It's fun to try one or two them over your four years
[miore, and it is hard to deny that Starr has played a major role
[ng out the best in Philly restaurants. If you don't believe us,
out all of the imitators and similarly high-quality restaukt have opened since Steven Starr began his experiments in
pe streets of Philadelphia. If you're still a doubter, well, Pat's
p's have great cheesesteaks, and those cost less than $6.

Midnight Munchies
Get caffeinated in University City
Though I'm typically satisfied with Swarthmore, there
are days when my life here doesn't quite cut it. As soon as
I begin to feel the familiar pangs of disillusionment, I
know I've been in the bubble too long and that only one
thing will cure it
a day spent in the city.

When I'm off-campus, I look for coffee shops and cafes
with a young atmosphere where I can work undisturbed.
Namely, I look for student hangouts populated by students other than Swatties. It's only this anonymity that
can give me crucial physical and mental distance from
Swarthmore, as well as the peace I need to clear my head
and focus on my work.
In Philly, independent student-populated cafes are
numerous and plentiful
it's knowing where to look
that's key. One of my favorites is Bubble House on
Sansom Street. Bubble House offers reasonably priced
appetizers and main courses, though the food is not the

same quality as the similarly priced Asian fare in
Chinatown. There are, however, some exceptions, like
the sweet potato fries, that are a must-eat for anyone dining here.
The drinks are the main attraction at Bubble House.
The sweet, milky bubble tea comes in all different colors
and varieties. Waiters serve the tea with wide straws
that allows customers to slurp the gummy tapioca balls
at the bottom
the "bubbles" for which the drink is
named. The drinks aren't very expensive, with most teas

With bubble tea, you can drink your tea and eat it, too.

starting around $3.
The atmosphere at Bubble House is both relaxed and
social. Since most of the waiters are students, they
understand the value of having a place to concentrate
and work undisturbed. I've sat there for four or five
hours without interruption. At time, you may have difficulty concentrating because the Bubble House is also a
spot for students to socialize. In the past, I've found the
background noise comforting, not overwhelming or too
distracting. And every Tuesday night, from 8 to 10 p.m.,
the Bubble House caters to its college clientele by featuring the Underground Poetry Cafe.

Another popular student cafe in University City is
Cosi, located next to EMS by the Penn Bookstore. This
chain (there are several in Center City as well) is a combination of Starbucks and Panera, offering expansive lunch
and dinner selections like pizza, daily soups and various
sandwiches. Drinks include a variety of coffee-type beverages, and after 5 p.m., cocktails such as the Mocha
Martini. The most unique aspect about Cosi is their makeyour-own-s'mores kit. It comes with a small fire (which the
waiters bring to your table) and marshmallows to roast
over the flames.
Another great feature of Cosi is its outdoor seating
on nice days, you can sip your cafe latte while basking in
the sun. Cosi also has wireless Internet service available
at all of its Philadelphia locations so, like Starbucks, it
attracts a fair amount of people who come to do work.
Though the cafe has more of a corporate feel than Bubble
House, it draws a more varied crowd since it caters to students and an older, working crowd. Look for me there the
next time Swat starts to feel a little tiring.

Fast, flavorful and cheap: New Delhi Indian restaurant
BY SUSANNAH GUND
When my boyfriend, Chris, came to visit from
Chicago, I had to prove to him that I would still be
able to get quick, cheap Indian food even while
studying at my small liberal arts college in the suburbs. So we hopped on the train to New Delhi Indian
Restaurant, a short walk from the SEPTA bus stop
at Chestnut Street between 40th and 41st. Just half
an hour from Swarthmore, we found a quality
Indian food experience, a quick end to our cravings,
and, above all, a place where the price is right.
New Delhi offers a $6.95 lunch buffet and a $8.95
dinner buffet, each with a selection of starters and
sides, breads, meat and vegetable dishes, and a
choice of dessert. Vegans will find little to eat at the
buffet or even on the menu, as most Indian food
involves butter or cream in some form, but vegetarians and carnivores alike will be happy with their
dinner buffet.
Chris and I tried a bit of everything. Samosas,
which have equivalents in many different cultures,
are basically deep-fried dough, filled with potatoes
and either vegetables or meat, and are must-haves
at most restaurants. The veggie samosas at New
Delhi's buffet were not so greasy as to make either
one of us feel sick, but deep-fried enough to hit the
proverbial spot. There are yummy sauces that
should not be missed, although not as many as most
restaurants offer.

Chris and I both love chicken tikka masala,
boneless pieces of chicken cooked in a tomato
cream or butter-based sauce, so in our first round

at the buffet we were sure to include a large helping with basmati rice and nan, an Indian flat bread.
The tikka masala was flavorful enough for us to
enjoy, but not too spicy for first-time Indian food
eaters. Incidentally, while most people in the
restaurant do seem to go for the buffet, there are
waiters on hand to help explain any food choices,
and each item on the buffet has a helpful explanation for those who haven't experienced the joys of

Indian food before.
On the veggie end, we enjoyed the mutter paneer
(fried cheese cubes .in a sauce), the gobi masala
(spiced cauliflower and potatoes), and especially the
dal makhni (lentils in a cream-based sauce), which
were delicious and flavorful. Chris's lamb was surprisingly good for something from a hot buffet line.
From the cold salad buffet, we both made sure to get
some raita, a refreshing sort of cold cucumber soup.
Unfortunately, it was a bit too watery for me, but, at
such value, I couldn't complain.
Included with the buffet is a choice from the
dessert menu for each person. No matter how much
Indian food I eat, I always have room for gulab
jamun warm milk or cheese balls in honey. While
these are good at New Delhi, the kulfi, Indian pistachio ice cream, is an even more exciting taste sensation. If you haven't tried it, the New Delhi version
is good.
In the dim blue lighting by the light of the buffet,
we rounded off our evening with tea and happy
glances at the small numbers on our check. Though
it's probably not the best date restaurant, and it is
not a break from Sharpies in the serving-yourself
sense, for a quick, cheap dose of Indian food, New
Delhi has what you need.

Stay Overnight
Alumni-tastic!
BY ALYSSA WORK
After four years of South Street visits, restaurant-sampling and theater-going, plenty of Swatties decide to live in
Philadelphia when they get into the real world. In fact, five
hundred and twenty-seven Swarthmore alumni, from the
class of '35 to the class of 'O3, call Philly home.
"I moved to Philly because I spent my senior year studying for honors and having a good time before entering the
real world," said Taina Guarda 'O2. "I decided that
Philadelphia wouldbe the easiest thing to do since it's cheap
to live in and many of my friends were planning on staying."
Other alums mentioned the city's accessibility as a benefit of living there; they rave about Philly's livability and con-

venience.
"My favorite thing about the city is its walkability, its
diversity, all of the activity," said Denis Murphy 'B9.
Jaclyn Jahnke '99, a recent graduate of Temple Law
School, also loves Philly for its cultural attractions and
week-to-week happenings.

Giovanni's Room, one of the nation's oldest gay bookstores, is a must-see for Philly visitors interested in queer issues.

Philly flies the rainbow flag
BY DANA SEAY
"Get your history straight and your nightlife gay." So
says the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing
Corporation's recent ad campaigN aimed at bringing gay
visitors to Philadelphia. The first government-sponsored
television campaign of its kind, the ads feature Ben
Franklin flying a rainbow kite and Betsy Ross sewing a
rainbow flag.
Promoting Philadelphia specifically to gays, these ads
beckon tourists to take advantage of the unique opportunities the city has to offer. But beyond all the hype, is
Philadelphia really a "gay-friendly" city?
Historically, Philadelphia has indeed been the site of
queer-friendly events. Philadelphia was home to some of
the first gay-rights protests, which took place in the 1960s
in front of Independence Hall even before the landmark
Stonewall Riots in New York City.
In recent years, Philadelphia has continued to provide
the backdrop for discussions on the issues of the gay community. Philadelphia Gay News, established in 1976, is one
of the nation's oldest and most respected gay newspapers.
The University of Pennsylvania's public radio station, 88.5
WXPN-FM, has two long-running queer programs,
Amazon Country and Q'zine. Philly has also led the way
in the passage of queer-friendly laws, passing an ordinance prohibiting discrimination due to sexual orientation in 1982. And as early as 1975, Pennsylvania became
the first state to create an official government commission
to look into the problems of sexual minorities.
The main Philadelphia "gayborhood," Center City, is
estimated to be about 30 percent gay and lesbian, according to gay.com. The queer community has developed an
extensive network of support. The William Way
Community Center, which opened in 1997, is one of the few
queer community centers to be established with federal
funds. It's home to community groups and many regular
events, including monthly "gay BINGO," featuring drag
queens on roller skates. The Attic Youth Center, estab-

lished in 1993, serves as a community center for queer and
transgendered youths and young adults up to 2L
Center City is also where most night life is found. There
are many clubs and bars, most famously Woody's and
Sisters, but Philly has much more to offer its queer inhabitants. Millennium Coffee is the perfect place to grab some
Java in style. Located by the 12th Street gym, the peoplewatching there is superb. Also located on 12th Street is
Giovanni's Room, one of the nation's oldest gay and lesbian
bookstores. Hosting a bevy of events and carrying hard-tofind gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender titles,
Giovanni's Room is a must-see spot.
If you'd like to crash off-campus, spend the night at
"Upstairs at Uncle's Inn" Philadelphia's only gay-owned
bed and breakfast, located right next door to Giovanni's
Room.
And if you're in the city over the summer, The
International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, held every
July, is the largest film festival of its kind on the East Coast.
For its 10th anniversary this summer, there were more
than 150 features, documentaries, shorts and related
events, for both family and adult audiences.
With modern queer activism and a history to match, the
city of brotherly love really does live up to its claim.

rants."
Despite its appealing aspects, Philadelphia is often considered a lesser metropolis. Many alums, however, favorably
compared it to New York City and Washington, D.C.
Jim Becker '74 moved to Philly from D.C. in 1981 to take a
position in the U.S. Attorney's Office. "Philadelphia has all
of the attractions of a major city, but it's much more affordable and manageable than its counterparts to the north and
south," he said.
"Not as exciting as New York or D.C," said Marion
Heacock '6O, "but much more livable."
And it's not just the city itself that everyone loves, it's the
people and the atmosphere. Guarda said she likes the "lowkey" environment of the city: "Apart from rich yuppies and
misled indie-rockers, no one puts on any airs."
Guarda also enjoys the variety of the nightlife, which
boasts "a bar for every taste... whether you like dive bars, or
dance-y bars, most people will find a favorite haunt," she
said.
Not only are happenings in Philly accessible, they are
also varied to suit a range of tastes and interests. For
Barbara Wolf '73, being able to boat on the river makes

One Night Stand
It's an 'Animal
House' downtown
BY CHRIS ATANASIU
In the section of Philadelphia known as University City,
which spans the area from Race to Pine Streets, between
30th and 40th Streets, Drexel and Penn not only influence
current fashion (everyone there sports DU or UP sweatshirts), but also the entertainment available in the area.
Philly's college nightlife scene is very similar to most
nightlife in Philadelphia: Only the 21-and-up set is sufficiently catered to. Bars tend to draw big crowds, offering
specials of some sort nearly every night, and frequently
providing live music as well. Depending on the night,
bar-hoppers can find everything from Quizzo (a trivia
game with prizes) to hip-hop DJs or a live college band.
Smokey Joe's is a longstanding Penn tradition. Right
next to the high-rises on 40th Street, a recent remodeling
did away with the grungy, funky feel, turning Joe's into
more of a sports bar than a typical college hang. There's
wood paneling, a few TVs, and cheap drink specials offering a great bang-for-your-buck quotient (considering
Penn's affluent population). The food is typical bar fare,
which is to say restaurant-style burgers and similar
appetizer/entree selections. Taking price into consideration Smokey Joe's makes it on sheer value, a great deal
for a budget-conscious Swattie looking for new faces.
Cavanaugh's has replaced Smokey Joe's as the preferred bar of University City's hearts and livers. Loud
and rowdy just about every night, this is where most people on 39th Street head to have a good time. Try a beer, if
you can make up your mind. There are almost 20 varieties on tap, and close to 100 bottled, so you're sure to
find something you like. The food isn't quite a cheap
meal
expect to spend $l5 to $2O-and-up for an appetizer and entree
but the quality is higher than you'd
expect from a bar/tavern. Plus, it's only a short walk
from 30th Street Station. Sink or Swim Wednesdays
might keep you out of class on Thursday, but a $5 cover
and 25-cent drinks make this bar a good value at least
one night of the week.
Last, but certainly not least, is The Blarney Stone
University City's dive of choice. While the crowds at

Joe's and Cavanaugh's might bear suspicious similarity
to the latest Abercrombie and Fitch catalog, don't expect
pink Polos and crisp, blasted jeans here. Frat brothers
and sorority sisters may make an appearance, but not in
mass quantities. Thursday through Saturday nights get a
bit crowded and crazy, but the bartenders can skillfully
pour a pint of Guinness, and drink specials usually keep
the crowd sedated. Though this bar was recently remodeled too, the back room maintains a college atmosphere,
prompting one friend to feel like she'd just walked onto
the set of "Animal House." I'm still not sure if that's a
good or bad thing.
Whether dive bars or sports hangs are your night spot
of choice, be sure to enjoy the collegiate lifestyle while
if only to see
you can, and get out to University City
the side of education you don't get at Swarthmore.

One night out in 'Gayborhood'
BY SARAH WALSH
Originally, I planned this week's column to trace how "successfully" I had flirted with innocent bystanders in hip area
bars as compared to a gay male friend of
mine from Penn. Then I figured it definitely would not be kosher to hit on random
people, even in jest, while my new Internet
Boyfriend was fasting for Yom Kippur. So,
instead, I decided to live vicariously
through E. (who was also was my first-ever
boyfriend, back in eighth grade), while I
played the role of the (mostly) straight
female sidekick, which basically consisted
of being "cute"- but not cute enough that I
might somehow eclipse E- and demonstrating a willingness to dance by myself
for a good portion of the night while he got
his groove on.
After a few glasses of something or
other to prep, we started the night at
Bump, a large gay bar packed with so
many skinny male bodies that, for a second, I thought I was back at Swat. Well,
only a split second, because upon entering

10

I noticed two things: one, that each of these
guys probably owned more leather wrist
cuffs than I own pairs of underwear, and
two, that I am allergic to gay male bars. As
the combination of so many different types
of heavily applied cologne and hair products mingled in my nostrils, I actually
wished for the funky familiarity of Swat

Island iced teas. The age of the crowd was
mixed, consisting mostly of people in their
mid-twenties, and while it's still warm you
can either sit in the orange-lit main bar or
outside. While I was devouring our nachos,
E. flirted with the bartender, then two guys
that sat at the next table, and afterwards
with the guy asking for change on the sidewalk.

It would not be kosher to
hit on random people
while my new Internet
Boyfriend was fasting for
Yom Kippur.
Sweat (that ultimate mark of cultural privilege
the ability to say "F#@ you" to
common hygienic practices). We were
sneezing all the way through our nachos,
which I am reasonably sure would have
been fair even if I hadn't had all those Long

Since at this point it was 2 a.m. and E.,
incredibly, had not hooked up with anyone
in a bathroom anywhere, we knew it was
time to hit Pure, a members-only gay club
that is truly awesome in its awful-ness. I
had been there before and had gotten in
free (before 1:30), but this time they actually tried to make me pay. I pled my case:
there are never any girls there ever, so
clearly I was not about to pay for ass I
would never get. My friend added, "And
she's not ugly, so she won't detract from
the crowd too much." After pondering our
brilliant defense, my new friend John (or
maybe Jim) let us in to shake it with the
Pure Chippendale dancers and lots of boys
in tight tees. I marveled for the millionth

time how ridiculous it is that I so often frequent venues where I am quite positive
that no one finds me remotely attractive.

Luckily the combination of various grain
alcohols and cheap boxed wine (consumed
on campus, of course) was making even the
pop-y house music, if not ideal, at least
fuzzy enough to be not entirely unenjoy-

able.

If I've sounded at all condescending
about my foray into the "gayborhood", it's
purely a front. Sure, I scoff at pop music
like everyone else, but who doesn't like to
indulge in a little lip-synching to Madonna
songs from her cone-bra era once in a

while?

So, straight and queer alike, pull out
your fairy glitter from five years ago, do
four shots, and hit a gay club for the ultimate in campy fun (and possibly quite a bit
more). Just remember, straight girls,
Margaret Cho may not always be funny,
but she was right on the money when she
said, "The last people at gay bars are
straight women." So bring a friend. Or at
least cab fare home.

Besides cheesesteaks, Philadelphia is also home to soft pretzels, water ice and TastyKakes.

Jon and Emiliano traveled to the far reaches of Chester County in search of cheap beer. On the way, they found bad music,

25-cent wings, and Durty Nelly's. Ridley will never be the same

Roadtrippers 'phuck Filly,' wreak havoc in Ridley
BY JON FOMBONNE AND EMILIANO RODRIGUEZ
First, an apology to our readers: While we're sure we left
you screaming for more after the titillating tale of our crazy
capers, also known as 'The Road Trip,' the fascists at The
Phoenix have insisted that we write an article for the Philly
Guide.
In fact, we remember writing for this section last year.
We reviewed some Philly bars but probably weren't as
familiar with them as we should have been. For example,
when we reviewed 'The Black Banana,' we were unaware
that it had previously been Philly's hottest gay bar until it
closed down six years ago. Now that we're both 21, we decided it was time for a proper bar review. But because of all the
fines our broke asses incurred on the road trip (details
forthcoming), we couldn't quite make it into Philly. Luckily,
there is no shortage of happening local establishments, so
Jon suggested: "Phuck Filly, Let's Go to Ridley." And we
did.
Ridley, for those of you who don't know, is somewhere
between Chester and Swarthmore, in many ways. We first
hit a classy establishment known as Durty Nelly's. We've
always fantasized about going to Durty Nelly's. We imagined it as a loud and raucous Irish pub, filled with fat redcheeked men and their even fatter cousins and sisters. We
pictured leprechauns playing jigs on their didgeridoos (or
whatever those Irish play). Instead, we got some zit-faced

local high-school pop-punk band, though Jon did love their
rendition of "Dammit." But the biggest disappointment was
that the place really wasn't... dirty. To be honest, it was a
lot like Gentry's nuts: sterile. Still, they did have decently
priced pitchers (we paid $9 for some Yuengling at 1 a.m.),
and they have 25-cent wings on Mondays and 75-cent bottles
of Coors on Thursday nights from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. There
also must have been about 40 TVs inside, making this a
good place to watch the game, whichever game that might
be. If you're into pop-punk and are looking for a regular bar
in a regular town with some regular-looking people, Durty's
is the place for you.
Our next stop was Tom and Jerry's. In our quest for nonsterile environments, this was certainly a step in the right
direction. When we walked in, we could tell this was where
all the local alcoholics hung out, so we figured it would be a
great place to start a bar fight. We walked in, pounded four
beers and 10 shots (all for a bit less than at Durty Nelly's)
and proceeded to taunt the locals. Emiliano threw out his
best "your mom" jokes and Jon hit on all their wives, but
nothing. They just gave us their wallets and begged us not
to hurt them. We decided to leave, but our blood thirst was
not quenched. We settled for beating the hell out of each
other in the parking lot (see picture). While we won't be
going back for a bar fight, the beer is cheaper than Durty
Nelly's, and it's got a bit more of the local bar appeal.
Next we headed over to Pappou's, located on the classier

right next to Burger King. First, we should
say that Pappou's is awesome. They have a good selection of
microbrews and imports, and the pizza, in the words of Matt
Goldstein 'O4, is "to die for." Pitchers were all eight bucks,
and the selection and quality is much better than any of the
other bars. The wait staffis friendly, and while some purists
might disagree, the sign calls it a family restaurant. The
best part is that if you aren't drunk enough to drive home,
they have cold six-packs to go in a separate but connected
beer store. Pappou's is the closest to Swarthmore and the
only place you can get beer after 9 on weeknights.
Of course, any night of local partying has to end at Tom
Jones'. For all you dumb-asses who still don't know
Tom Jones' is, get off campus and go. It's the best 24-hour
diner in the area, and the home of the famous Blue Ribbon
Special ($2.79 for two eggs, two pancakes, two pieces of toast,
two strips of bacon, two sausage patties, coffee, and juice).
Plus, the waitresses all wear very short skirts. We recently
discovered another Tom Jones' treasure, the Gummer, quite
possibly the greatest hoagie in the world. To get to Tom
Jones', head down 320 towards Chester and take a right on
Edgemont. Go until you see the sign about crab cakes, but
don't order them.
Special thanks to Kate and Michelle who convinced us to
try out these local bars. In the end, if you're looking to avoid
that yuppie bullshit that is Center City, try out any of these
places. You're bound to have some fun.
