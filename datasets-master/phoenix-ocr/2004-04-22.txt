Housing crunch lighter than
last year's, but not by much
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

Despite more available rooms and
fewer participants in the lottery this
year, many students still struggled for
desirable housing.
At the end of last night's lottery, 14
rising juniors were on the waiting list
for singles, Director of Residential
Life Myrt Westphal said.

Female housing for rising sophomores closed at 969 for females. Male

to the lottery and would trickle in
Thursday to request rooms.
"Last year, the waitlist for [rising]
sophomores started at 945," Westphal
said. "I don't know [about] this year,
but there will probably be fewer students on the waitlist."

She emphasized that there were
two waiting lists, one for rising juniors who want singles and the other
for rising sophomores who "just want
rooms."

Though there

was a housing
crunch this year, it was not as severe
as last year's, which left more students without housing than ever

before.

Forty more students are going
abroad this year than last, according
to Westphal. Though Parrish renova-

tions will eliminate 45 spaces, the

new dorm will add 75 spaces, which
leaves a net increase of 30 beds for
the fall.

Specs ride on into campus
The college welcomed about 300 admitted students yesterday for Ride the Tide to Swat.
There are around 100 more participants than last year, when admissions first decided
to change the event from a weekend to three weekdays. "There's a big increase. We're
very excited about that," Admissions Counselor Jason Caldwell 'Ol said.
"We're trying to expose all of the specs to as many facets of the college as possible,"
Caldwell said. The visitors come from all over the country. Three came from Hawaii, and
one flew in from Switzerland, Caldwell said. The college will extend financial assistence for
traveling to all groups, not just minorities as in previous years, The Phoenix reported earlier
this month.

Westphal noted that there were
fewer rising juniors on the waiting
list this year than last but said she
could not comment on the lottery
until midday today.
"I know how many students are in
the class of 'O7, I know how many
rooms are open, and I know how
many students got blocks," Westphal
said. "What I don't know is how many
rising juniors will come back to pick
in the sophomore lottery or how many
kids are living off campus or not com-

For Westphal, the lottery is only

"Phase I" of the housing process.
Phases II and 111 are the waiting list

and the admitted first-years. Threehundred ninety to 400 rooms are
reserved for new students.
Atsuro Wada 'O6 decided to go on
the waiting list for singles, "because if
I go on the wait list, I will get anything
better than a [Mary Lyon] single. It
couldn't get worse." Wada's lottery
number was 707.
According to the housing lottery
Web site, this number had received a
single in Mary Lyon basement in
2003, while in 2002 students with
numbers in this range had had a
choice between Mary Lyon and
Parrish.
Wada said he was optimistic about
getting housing off the waiting list "I
am hoping for a Wharton single," he
said. "Anything can happen. I know

people who have gotten really big

rooms off the wait list."

philosophical attitude toward her

Seniors lament lack of post-graduation plans
BY DEIRDRE CONNER
dconner2@swarthmore.edu
As
their
time
left
at
Swarthmore ticks away, seniors
are facing one question with everincreasing frequency: What will
you be doing after graduation?
The query seems simple
enough. But careless askers
beware: The question can elicit a
wide variety of emotions. Many
seniors actively hunting for jobs
and balancing schoolwork are
feeling immense stress. And for
those with plans, relief often

mixes with guilt.
David Berger 'O4 recently
accepted a position as a research
assistant at the Federal Reserve
Board in Washington, D.C. A few
weeks ago, however, he was
caught up in the anxiety of
searching unsuccessfully for a job
since November.
"I didn't think I was going to
get anything, but then I got a lot
offers all at once," he said. "There
was this period where I couldn't
do my work. I was like, what the
heU am I going to do with my life?"
Once he knew he had options,
he felt uncomfortable talking

THE PHOENIX

about them in front of friends
who had not found anything yet.
"I felt like, yeah, you should just
decide and then shut up about it,"
Berger, an economics major, said.
For legions of other seniors,

the operating theory is "leap, and
the net will appear." Many are

making plans to go to specific
locations and start looking once

there.

"I couldn't do my
work. I was like, what
the hell am I going to
do with my life?"
David Berger 'O4

To nervous job-hunters, it can
seem like everyone else has firm

plans. But every year, roughly
one-third of the respondents to the
Career Services Senior Survey
describe their plans as "tentative,"
"uncertain" or "very uncertain."

The economic downturn of the

past few years has reduced the

number of recruiters coming to
Swarthmore. But Career Services
Director Nancy Burkett said
recruiting activity is starting to
pick up again, most of it in the
business and non-profit sectors.
The recruiting season often
brings up debates over which

majors are most "employable."
"Sometimes I think I should
have done a more practical major,
like econ. But then when I took the

It seems that, for many
Swatties, the next few months will
be spent thinking about what they
want to do, and the next few years
will be spent finding out. That's
Berger's plan in taking the job
with the Fed, where he'll figure
out if his love for economics theory pans out in the real world.
"I think that's, like, the theme
of senior year," Berger said. "It's

"I like to at least pretend that

Post-graduate education and

when to do it is a constant theme.
About 25 percent of the class of

Now, Hart said, she is open to

Free culture advocate to speak
intellectual property have become the most important

BY MEGO LIEN

mlienl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons is
going international.
The organization, founded by Nelson Pavlosky 'O6 and
Luke Smith 'O6, will launch freeculture.org tomorrow.
The Web site will serve as a forum for an internation-

al student movement "dedicated to fighting coercive
copyright practices and other threats to the free flow of
information," the press release said.
To help celebrate the launch, SCDC has invited
Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig to speak at
Swarthmore.

"In a democracy you're supposed
to have rules that people
actually believe, not what
five companies believe."
Lawrence Lessig
Stanford law professor
Lessig is the founder of Stanford's Center for Internet
and Society and the recent author of "Free Culture," a
book published and available for free online. He also represented book publisher Eric Eldred in Eldred v.
Ashcroft, which challenged the 1998 Sonny Bono
Copyright Term Extension Act. Eldred will also appear at
tomorrow's event.
Pavlosky and Smith invited Lessig to their launch.
"Lessig mentioned us on his blog," Pavlosky said. "After
the Diebold case, we figured maybe we had enough
national attention that we could convince famous people
they could come."
"Lessig coined the term 'free culture,'" Pavlosky said.
"He's a huge inspiration for our movement."
Lessig shared his views with The Phoenix

and the least understood and the problems that cause
the most harm to free society. So getting people to recognize that free speech is one part of a much more fundamental set of freedoms, and that culture is not guaranteed through free speech, is an important thing for
people to see.
It's one thing when a law professor talks about it, but
when you start having a student movement around it,
then I think we have a real chance to communicate.

In the context of your dedication to free culture, what
would an ideal society to you look like?
An ideal society to me is one where a much wider

range of people feel empowered and capable of adding
or contributing to the process of building culture. Look
at the way society functions when people tell each other
stories, and then imagine that same capacity spread on
the Internet
criticizing, complimenting, adding to,
contracting from. The problem we've got right now is
that freedom, which we thought we had already guar-

anteed through free speech in the Constitution, is
threatened because so much of what is important to us
is also called property, and you can't use property without permission.

You just wrote a book which is free online. How else
do you participate or make your mark in free culture?
For example, do you download songs off the Internet?
I don't download songs. I'm a little bit afraid of being
a victim of overeager targeting. But you know, I write a
book, I give away as much of the content that I can. But

on the

growing free-culture student movement. He will speak in
Science Center 101 tomorrow at 7 p.m.

What will your lecture focus on?
My hope is to make salient the importance of the free

culture movement as something people more than
lawyers have to get involved with.
do you think of freeculture.org and their
attempt to make free culture an international student
movement?

What

It's the most exciting thing that's happened since my
child was born. I think it's the coolest thing I've seen. It's

extraordinary.
What I think is best about it is that it's entirely
authentic. The free culture movement is born because
you guys find yourselves in the middle of an insane war,
which is totally a product of the insanity of the copyright
system, so it's great. It's really exciting.

When did you yourself get involved in free culture? In

I go around trying to get people excited about this
issue.

Where do you see the media going in the future?
If we're successful, what we think of now as commercial culture will continue to grow a little bit, but it'll be
supplemented by this extraordinarily interesting,

diverse, closer-to-regular-people, bottom-up, other system ofculture.
I think ultimately it'll be economically more important because it'll drive us to purchase a lot of machines
and bandwidth technology to manipulate it. And politically more important because how you sell on blog space
will be just as important as how you sell on "Meet the
Press." So it could be an exciting time. If we don't win
this battle, then, you know, just imagine the Soviet Union
and spruce it up with a little Hollywood.
There's a sense in which your freedom to participate
in the culture gets determined by the judgment of an
ever-smaller number of people. That won't silence those
who want to engage in free culture, it'll just push them
underground. So there'll be the black market of culture,
just like there was in commerce. And all the cool people
will be playing the black market. That'll be fun and
interesting but ultimately, I think, really destructive,
because in a democracy you're supposed to have rules
that people actually believe, not what five companies
believe. If you don't have that, then you have a lot of
really destructive tendencies that grow out of revolt or

resistance.

college?
There wasn't such a thing when I was a college student, back in the dark ages. Even in law school, no one
took intellectual property law, because it was a totally
boring subject, which had no relevance to anything in
the world. But I've been involved in this for the last five
or six years, because, as I've done work in the interac-

Housing tight, but
better than before
From HOUSING, pg. 3
"I was very happy to get it, because by the time they got
to the 700s, I didn't think there were any singles left. I was
OK to go into ML. I knew I would have friends there."
Baker used her first cohort number to block for Roberts
for her sophomore year and said she felt distance was not
a problem. At the beginning of the sophomore lottery,
there were still six available singles in ML basement.
For rising seniors, selection was easier. "I was surprised at how slowly Wharton AB filled up," Gabriel
Rogers 'O5, who will be a Wharton RA next year, said. "We
only had three people in AB by number 115 or so. I have no
idea why. The last single went to number 315."
Despite uncertainty about when the new dorm will be
finished, it was popular in the rising senior and junior lotteries.
Only three doubles in the new dorm were left at the
beginning of the rising sophomore lottery. Some rising
juniors who were unable to pick into desirable singles
chose sophomore doubles.
Lan Miller 'O5 was pleasantly surprised that there were

still lofted doubles in the new dorm left when he picked on
number 225. "The first two were picked before number 100,
I think," he said. "I really wanted a lofted double, because
all my senior friends were living in singles, and it would
be nice to have a bigger room to hang out in."
Miller and his roommate have been friends since early
freshman year, and he does not mind sharing a room. He
was not sure whether the top or bottom of the loft would be
more desirable.
"The top half would appear to have a little more privacy, but would be hotter than the bottom half and have less
air space," Miller said.
Mindy Reiser 'O7, who picked on number 831, got the last
double in the new dorm. "It's exciting. We thought we'd get
Willets Third. This is infinitely better."
"People are choosing doubles on campus over ML basement singles," Wee Chua 'O6, a Mary Lyon RA, said. "My

friends wanted to live with me, but it was too far off campus." Chua had 411, the second-best lottery number in his
class. "My number was kind of a waste," he said. "I had
some doubts when I got it, because I could have had a huge
room in Worth or Mertz."
Chua said the second half of the housing lottery was
"very tense" and that people were not talking much. In
future years, the construction of a second wing on the new
dorm may alleviate the housing crunch, which would yield
an additional 75 beds. This wing has not been built yet
because the funds are not available, Westphal said.

Lull to leave hospital
Kevin Lull 'O6, who was injured in a car accident
April 8, is preparing to leave the hospital and enter a
rehabilitation center in Bryn Mawr, according Pat
Coyne, administrative coordinator for the Dean's
Office. Coyne, who has spoken with Lull's aunt, said
Tuesday that the move would probably take place in
two to three days, following a minor procedure to
replace Lull's tracheotomy tube with a smaller one.

The tube prevents him from speaking, but Lull continues to communicate through writing. Coyne also said
Lull had taken three steps.

Lure and pressure of honors strong
In fact, we're supposed to tell people the name of the program is the 'program of external examinations.'"

book is kind of eerie at first."
"It's not an experience you get anywhere else, at least at
the undergraduate level," Burnheter added.

BY SUE CHEN

schenl@swarthmore.edu
At the honors open-house meeting in February, English
professor and honors coordinator Craig Williamson
explained the lure of honors.
The college's 82-year-old program gives students the
opportunity to participate in "intellectual dialogue of the
highest order," he told a gathering ofabout 50 sophomores.
That, at any rate, is the official reason to partake in the
legendary honors program.
But not everyone is drawn to the program by the desire
to seek intellectual dialogue. They are also influenced in
part by the pressure surrounding the program.
In 1922, President Frank Aydelotte created a program at
the college modeled after
the tutorial system at
University.
Oxford
Students would participate in seminars and
engage in intellectual discussions. They are tested
at the end of their senior
year by external examiners, who determine the
bestowment of honors, high honors or highest honors.
For many students, the opportunity to take seminars
and face external examiners is indeed the reason for their
decision to pursue honors.
"Honors exams, scary as they seem, are a good way to
leave the place with a coherent sense of what you've done,"
Sonia Vallabh 'O6, who attended the meeting, said.
"I wanted the challenge," honors biology major Jawaad
™-"^^^""

Making the decision
"There's certainly no pressure not to do honors,"
Acting Chair of the English department Nora Johnson said.
"We deal with students individually, but we do try to
encourage people who can do honors to try it," she added.
When asked if there is pressure to do honors, biology
professor Rachel Merz said, "I don't think so, no."
While many departments and some students agree
with Johnson and Merz, others say there is no question
that the pressure to do honors exists.
"I think there is pressure to do honors. When you're
looking at the school as a high
school student, honors is presented as something special. So, of
the course, you want to be special,"
Spanish major Maria-Elena Young
the

"I think most, but not all, of
best students are in
program."
Craig Williamson
honors coordinator

Hussain 'O5 said.

Admissions Counselor Brian Burnheter 'Ol remembered
his external examinations as an honors political science
major. "[lt] was somewhat intimidating and frightening
until I walked in the door the mere fact that you're sitting across the table from the person who wrote your text...

'O4 said.

"A big thing is the parental
pressure. Because of the name,

[there's] this pressure," religion
major Rasika Teredesai 'O4 said.

Math major Brigid Brett-Esborn 'O4 said a lot of the pressure to do honors came from outside Swarthmore.'To people outside, there's the opinion, 'Why would you not take
this opportunity?' though I haven't felt that opinion from
anyone inside the college," she said.
The admissions office said it did not present honors as
something special, just different. "I think in general what
the admissions office tries to do is make sure the audience
knows [choosing honors] is about preference of learning
style, not ability," Burnheter said.
Admissions tour guide Katie Chamblee 'O7 agreed. "In
training, [the admissions office] tells us to talk about honors as a different way of pursuing study than course. We're
not supposed to act as though one is better than the other.

The lure of honorifics

The program is the only way one can graduate with honorifics, and this fact is not lost upon students when they

contemplate whether to do honors.
Of the five or six questions asked during the honors

information meeting, one was "Does honorifics go on your
diploma?" Yes, Williamson replied, and if you fail your
external examinations, it is as if you had never done honors, because you can still graduate. "You don't have anything to lose," he said.
Nothing, that is, except the honorific.
When the college eliminated honorific distinctions in
course and revamped the honors program in 1996, the percentage of graduates in the honors program more than douthe next year,
bled
from 10.2 percent to 2LB percent
according to the Office of Institutional Research.
Last year, 331 percent of the class of 2003 graduated with
honors, according to the Swarthmore College Fact Book.
Because the college simultaneously ended departmental
honorifics and changed the number of required honors
seminars from six to four, it is unclear how much of the
increase was caused by students wanting the honorifics
and how much was due to the less demanding seminar
requirements.

'Honors' a misnomer, some students say
From HONORS, pg. 5
For this reason, some say "honors" is a
misleading term for the program that

focuses on depth instead of breadth.
"The name 'honors'
it shouldn't be
called that, because it implies a special
honor. Some schools have honors colleges.
That's not what this is

...

people felt pres-

sure to do it because of the name, because
of [it being] honors," Rachel Fichtenbaum
'O4, an honors linguistics major, said.
Chamblee agreed. "I think the name
'honors' is kind of deceiving and does seem
to suggest that the students in that program are somehow 'better' than those in
course majors, whether or not that is actually the case," she said.
Merz said some students wanted to do
honors "because they just thought it was
the hardest thing to do
[this] doesn't
show a great reason to do honors at any
intellectual level."
Some see the honorific as signaling better qualification. Rachel Winer 'O6, who
was at the honors information session, said
there was an "extra benefit on applications"
to graduate school because honors has a
good reputation, "so it's an added boost."
"I've spoken with people who dropped
honors as soon as they got into med
...

school," Young said.
But dropout rate within the honors program has remained relatively low. Over the
last five years, an average of five students
out of 120 drop out, according to Williamson.
Fichtenbaum said there was little dif-

ference between the honors and course
majors in linguistics. She takes the same
classes as course majors and only has to
write two extra research papers and face
the external examiners to fulfill herhonors
requirements.
"I feel like linguistics brings out the stupid part of honors. The only different thing
for [honors linguistics] is two research
papers," Fichtenbaum said. And just
because you're facing external examiners,
"you're not any more honorable," she added.
But Williamson said students earned
the honorifics by doing work of such a
quality that it could stand testing by out-

side examiners, not just Swarthmore's own
faculty. Moreover, he added, it is the only
means worthy of a graduation honor.
"The faculty, by creating the program,
made a statement that the honors program
is the most demanding and most fulfilling
method of study during the last two years"
at Swarthmore, Williamson said.
And, as such, only those capable of
doing "honors quality" work will be
accepted into the program, according to the
College Bulletin.
"I may try to discourage students who I
think might have marginal academic performance" from doing honors, political science professor Carol Nackenoff said.
Because there is a higher GPA requirement for acceptance into honors than
course, "there's the assumption that honors [students] are better students," Alex
Brennan 'O4 said.
In fact, the assumption is not without

foundation. "I think most, but not all, of the
best students are in the program,"
Williamson said. As to why some of the best
students are not doing honors, Williamson
said reasons varied and pointed to logistical problems that come with studying
abroad, double majors and special majors.
The perceived intellectual superiority
of the program and seminar preferences
for honors students deepen the division
between course and honors.
"At one point, people in course were
looked on as second-rate citizens. We didn't
like that, so we opened up seminars" to
course majors, economics professor Larry
Westphal said.
Even so, some course students still feel
inferior for not pursuing the opportunity of
the honors experience. "That's a really hard
decision for me not do it, because I felt like
I was a slacker for not doing it. Choosing not
to do it is like choosing an easier route,"
biology major Kate Penrose 'O4 said.
"I feel like I'm slightly deficient"for not
doing honors, Young said. "That's how
ingrained it is in me."

majors and hoped the change would encourage one-third ofits students to do honors.
In fact, "not only did people come into
[political science], half of the majors apply
to honors, if not more," Nackenoff, who
chaired the department from 1997 to 2003,
said. "It's put unmanageable pressure on
seminars, especially if someone, is going on

Getting into 'good seminars'
When the college eliminated honorifics
in course and cut the mandatory number of
seminars from six to four in 1996, departments across the board experienced a
surge in honors enrollment.
Some departments have seen a rise more
than others. Before the policy was implemented, the political science department was
experiencing a drop in the number of honors

to do honors.
"They're not actually choosing the system, they're just choosing the means of getting into classes," she said.
Williamson disagreed.'! don't think you
can separate the desire to study in small
group situations with the desire to do hon-

leave."
Political science is not the only department feeling the crunch. Economics seminars are "full to almost overflowing,"
department chair Mark Kuperberg said.
Some find honors attractive precisely
because it gives them priority in scheduling.
"It's the only way to get into the good
seminars," honors English major Julia
Pompetti 'O5 said.
Johnson said the English department
had not had to turn anyone away from
seminars, but that, while course majors
are "welcome ... [they] don't have as high a
priority."

But for a program that seeks to encourage independent learning and intellectual

dialogue circumventing registration rules

strikes Fichtenbaum as the wrong reason

BY TERESA KELLEY

tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu

Student Council and Public

Safety are considering expanding
regular stops for the weekend
evening shuttle. Party-going students may be able to catch a ride
outside the fraternities rather than
at Parrish circle to ride to off-campus housing.
Myra Vallianos 'O5, Student
Council events coordinator, is promoting the additional shuttle stop
as a safety measure for drunken
students returning to their off-campus housing after parties "with the
added bonus of being much more
convenient for people."
Students may be hesitant to take
the shuttle from Parrish because
"walking up to Parrish seems counterproductive," she said. Vallianos
was especially intent on discouraging students from driving drunk
after parties.
Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave said it was still early in
the decision process and "all the
concerns haven't been weighed in
yet."

Redgrave said it was "hard to
predict" the

added minutes the stop

and waiting time. He said he was
concerned this addition "might
adversely affect reliability of the
shuttle schedule" and estimated the

shuttle cycle would be extended by
three to 10 minutes.
"The main purpose of the
[evening] shuttle is a safety issue,
although many people take it
because they're lazy," Evening

Lesley

Shuttle
Coordinator
Goodman 'O6 said.

"Walking home when you're
drunk can be a very vulnerable
experience."
Van coordinator Joe Alberti 'O6
said he recognized the benefit of

having expanded shuttle services,

but "it seems to be more a convenience than a need." Even while
intoxicated, the walk from the fraternities to Parrish Circle is not
demanding, Alberti said. "I don't
think anyone has passed out [on
Parrish Beach]," he said.
There are two evening shuttles
running between Parrish Circle
and off-campus housing. They have
alternating 20-minute runs, so the
shuttles run every 10 minutes.
A stop at the fraternities would
likely be added at every other rota-

tion to prevent shuttles from strayfrom the time schedule,
Vallianos said.
To judge student interest in the
new service, Student Council and
Public Safety are considering a trial
run before the end of this semester.
"I think it's silly," Mary Lyon
resident Scott Blaha 'O7 said. "[The
fraternities] are close to the center
of campus, anyway."
"Since I'm in [Mary Lyon] I'm
pretty used to walking a whole lot
that's really nothing to walk,"
Kate Goddard 'O6 said of the dising

tance from the fraternities to
Parrish Circle.
"It's a good idea," Strath Haven
resident David Gentry 'O5 said.
Although the shuttle makes special
stops on request, including near
Dana and Hallowell, Wharton and
the fraternities, with requested
stops, "the shuttle can get behind
schedule," Gentry said.
A regular stop would be more
time-efficient, he said. He was especially supportive of any effort to
prevent students from driving

drunk from parties.
A Wawa stop is also being considered as an addition to the movie
shuttle, Vallianos said.

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Shuttle may soon stop at frats

House bill could raise
cost of student loans
BY DIANA BELLETTIERI
WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS (NEW YORK U.)
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK

College may be getting more expensive

again.

The average loan-holding student could pay an additional $3,100
to $5,500 in interest if a bill introduced in the House of
Representatives passes, according to a nonpartisan study conducted early this month by the Congressional Research Service.
The bill, part of the Higher Education Act, which must be reauthorized every five years, would allow the interest rate on consolidated federal student loans to fluctuate from year to year.
Current loans would not be affected, remaining fixed at about
3.5 percent.
Under the current version of the Higher Education Act, the
interest rate on federal student loans initially fluctuates with the
market rate. But if students consolidate their student loans, they
can repay them at a fixed rate and fixed monthly amount.
Rep. George Miller of California Democrat said that allowing
interest rates to fluctuate would be an "excessive burden" on students.

"There are better ways to change the [Higher Education Act]
without putting college even further out of reach for many students," Miller said in a statement.
With the deadline for re-authorization fewer than six months
away, the debate is becoming increasingly partisan, said Alicia

Hurley, director of NYU's Office ofFederal Policy. The division will
likely force Congress to postpone the deadline, Hurley said.
"It's disheartening," she said. "It's a tough climate to be doing
any moderate negotiating."
Yet Hurley said the interest rate was only a hot topic because
rates were at a historical low and would probably increase if the
rate was allowed to fluctuate with the market.
"If we were having this debateliterally two years ago," when the
interest rate was around 7.5 percent, Hurley said, "I don't think we
would be getting such a reaction."

Students more likely to
vote in 2004, poll says
BY JOSH VERGES
MINNESOTA DAILY (U. MINNESOTA)
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS
College students are more likely to
vote this year than in 2000, and most of them will vote for Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass., according to a recent poll.

The latest survey from the Harvard Institute of Politics showed
62 percent of college students would "definitely be voting" in this
year's presidential election, compared to 50 percent that said the
same before the 2000 election.
Of the likely student voters, 56 percent said they would vote for
Kerry, while 33 percent said they favored Bush. The latest
CNN/Gallup survey shows the general population prefers Bush to
Kerry by four percentage points.
Bush's approval rating also dropped from 61 percent in a
Harvard poll from October to 47 percent most recently.
Though Kerry has the lead in the poll, Bush-backers more
strongly support their candidate. Of Kerry's likely voters, 13 percent had a "very favorable" opinion of him, while 38 percent of
Bush supporters said the same of the president.
University of Minnesota political science professor and political
analyst Larry Jacobs said those numbers matched the general public's opinions of the two candidates.
"Republicans, in general, tend to be more unified behind the
president," he said. "A vote for Kerry may not be a very <eHshisias-f

tic vote."

Those polled ranked the war in Iraq as their chief concern.
Though student interest in politics is up, fewer students now
identify with the two major parties, according to the poll.
Since fall 2000, the number of students identifying themselves as
independent has grown from 33 percent to 41 percent. In that same
time, student Democrats have slipped from 34 percent to 32 percent,
and student Republicans have shrunk from 28 percent to 24 per-

Finding beer beyond Paces
Many students are leaving campus and checking out the Philadelphia night life
BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu

Don't get me wrong. I think Paces is great. It's close,
it's cheap and it's often crowded enough for you to bump
up against that hot guy down the hall without him noticing. What's not to like? But after a while, you just need
something else: different faces, different location, different selection at the bar. So where do Swatties go for a
night on the town?
The most popular answer, at least among the people
that I talked to, was "down the hall to my friend's
.
room, to watch a movie. If I'm not busy doing Jm
work." C'mon guys. You can do better than that.
Philly is a big city, and any big city's got

"Mostly it's kind of spontaneous," she says. "I've gone to
some open mics at the October Gallery. They have some
good stuff there."
And there're plenty of cultural opportunities, as well.

"Last weekend I gave a presentation of Kathak [lndian
dance] and Thabla [lndian drumming] with Rozina Ali
['o6] in a park in Philly," Mamta Jhaveri 'O6 said. "And
last semester we went to an Indian dance festival."
Emily Remus 'O6 goes into the city fairly often on
tes with her boyfriend.
"We go to restaurants and movie theaters in

downtown Philadelphia," she said. "Our favorite
one is Creperie Beau Monde, off South Street.
There's a lot going on there, too, because it's off
South Street, which has a lot of fun shops. It's
not that hard if you take the train into Center
City."

Remus also plans on going on the Lights of

Liberty tour, described by Philadelphia Citypaper
theater critic David Anthony Fox as "a combina-

clubs. Alejandra Hernandez 'O4 recommends
Brazil, Egypt and the hip-hop club H2O. "It has
good music, you can dance, and there are different people than on campus. It's nice to be with
different groups of people," she said.
Transportation can be difficult, though, because
the latest train leaves the city before 11:30 on a
Saturday night.
"|t's kind of a pain, because the trains stop running and you have to take a taxi in, which makes it
kind of expensive, or you can drive, but if you're
going to drink you can't drive," Hernandez said.
If hip-hop isn't quite your thing, there are also
some very good jazz clubs around town. I'd recommend
Chris' Jazz Club, on Sansom near Broad Street. Sure, it
doesn't have quite the cachet of Zanzibar Blue, but it also
doesn't have the price tag. Covers are $5 to $l5, depending on who's playing, and the food is pretty reasonable,
too.
Emma Benn 'O4 prefers making her own music.

tion historical tour and light show."

Depictions of historical events are projected
like slides on the places where they occurred, and
the tour is accompanied by an audio guide featuring the likes of Whoopi Goldberg and everybody's
favorite gun-toting lobbyist, Charlton Heston. What

an experience.
Concerts and events in Philadelphia can be
expensive, but PhillyFunSavers.com has an e-mail
list where you can sign up to get info about halfprice tickets sent to you every Thursday. It's free,
and they don't require much personal information.
But nothing beats good old aimless hanging out.
"I like wandering around by Penn's Landing,"
Stephanie Rogan 'O6 said. "There's some cool stuff
going on around there, and if there's nothing really,
really exciting you can go down by the water. You can
see New Jersey." And nothing makes my Saturday night
like a good view of New Jersey.

and series finale time.
It's hard to believe that, after 11 years,
"Frasier" will no longer be a part of anyone's weekly lineup. The show made history by becoming the first series, comedic
or dramatic, to achieve a record five consecutive Emmy wins for Outstanding
Comedy Series. Now, at its close, we find
Frasier (the longest-running character in
television history at 20 years) still looking
for love, Niles and Daphne with a baby on
the way, and Martin engaged to Ronee,
Frasier's old babysitter. While lips are
sealed surrounding the content of the onehour series finale, celebrity guest stars
April 22,

will include Robbie Coltrane of "Harry
Potter" and Jason Biggs of "American
Pie." With this eclectic group, one can
only imagine what's in store for them and
Eddie, the famous Jack Russell terrier
who has provided on-screen amusement
for years.

As the finale draws near,
the question on everyone's
minds is, will Ross and
Rachel be each other's
lobsters once again?
A season finale is also coming up April
29 for America's favorite contemporary
duo, Will and Grace.
But beware.
While watching the finale, you might
notice that one of the show's two title
characters is missing. Grace (Debra
Messing) will be conspicuously absent
from the ending of the sixth season due to
her pregnancy in real life detaining her
from filming the last few episodes. In her
place will be Jennifer Lopez, making a

cameo as a wedding singer for the wed-

2004

ding of Karen (Megan Mullally) to fiance
Lyle Finster (John Cleese) in Sin City.
There should be a ton of jokes, and no one
should be deprived of Jack's inevitable

outrageous antics before the year is over.
But, perhaps the most anticipated
show this season is the series finale of

"Friends."
After an interactive choosing and airing of the five favorite fan episodes, the
countdown begins until the six friends
part ways on our television sets. As the
day draws near, the question on everyone's minds is, will Ross and Rachel be
each other's lobsters once again?
Now, if you've seen the previews, you
know Rachel will not take her job in Paris
and, at the last minute, in the airport,
with Ross arriving just in time, they'll get
back together.
Still, there's that bit of uncertainty
that makes fans nervous about the outcome. There were reportedly six different
versions of the finale floating around, so
it's anyone's guess as to how the show
will decide to leave its legacy. One thing is
for sure. It will end with a bang, and The
Rembrandts' "I'll Be There For You" will
remain in our hearts.

that Student Council was
right for me. So, last
Tuesday, I attended its weekly public meeting. It was quite
the interesting experience.
I arrived at 10 p.m. sharp. The Campus Resource
Center was empty, so I strolled around Parrish Second
West to kill some time. (Stacks of empty boxes! Piles of
envelopes! Locked offices! Wow! While Second West's
business sector looks to be booming, they could do a lot
more to promote tourism) I checked back at 10:05. People
were just starting to trickle in. At 10:10 p.m., more people
were there, but the meeting still wasn't under way.
Council members discussed trivial things; outgoing

It was that ill-fated Student Council
takeover that alerted me to my civic
duty here at Swarthmore: I must
defend and protect pasta bar,
whatever the cost.
At 10:15 or so, we began. The first item on the agenda
was movie night on Parrish Beach. This topic of movie
selection took more time, inspired more fervent commentary and created more council dissension than nearly
everything else combined. A few select quotes from the

debate:
"Super Troopers is [expletive] hilarious."
"No one wants to see [expletive] [butt]-long Pirates."
"We never show flat-out gore-fest movies on the beach."
"What about soft-core porn? Does that cause rape?"
Furthermore, someone found a problem with every
suggestion. "Office Space" was too "mellow." "Snatch"
was too "mellow." Non-mellowness, in fact, was a huge
motivating factor in movie selection, even surpassing
"good pre-party movie" and "appeals to drunk people."
Finally, a vote was taken and a decision made. Of course,
at least one council member
a stalwart advocate of
was less than thrilled.
Quaker consensus, perhaps?
"Oh, guys, it's going to suck! You guys ruined movie
night! I hate democracy, damn it!" were his exact words.
The meeting then progressed to other matters, like

instituting a shuttle that would depart from the frats on
party nights. On this matter, Student Council dedication
really shone brightly. They'd encountered adversity
concerns from Public Safety that drunks and non-drunks
might "intermix" (think of the horrors!). But still, they
persevered, offering to ride on the shuttles themselves,
not only to diffuse conflict, but to clean up wayward
vomit! So, Swatties, next time you question the resolve of
your elected officials, please, remember this: Would you
clean up your constituents' tossed cookies?
Other business included working to distribute a list
of campus drivers for people with doctor's appointments
(because, as one SC member put it, "really sick people
don't usually have friends") and attempting to introduce
a weekly Wawa shuttle. Indeed, Student Council seemed

extremely focused on transportation-related issues dur-

ing this meeting. Perhaps they're responding to a series
of concerns raised by our mostly car-less student body.

Or perhaps certain Student Council members have notso-secret crushes on Public Safety Director Owen
Redgrave. This latter possibility was raised at the meeting and debated extensively. Alas, no firm conclusion
was reached.
Amidst these much-discussed topics, other tidbits
flew back and forth, this way and that. Rumors about
Jim Bock! Tales of campus safety phones! Something
about the living wage! Before I knew it, it was almost
midnight, and the meeting was breaking up. Still, I felt
invigorated.

At first, I'd wanted to join Student Council only to
save pasta bar. Now, I'd come to realize what an exciting,
dynamic, motivated group they really were. I wanted to
be a part of everything they did, a participant in their
intellectual back-and-forths, not merely a silent spectator. After months of searching, I finally found an activity I wanted to join. Now (strikes presidential pose,
straightens necktie, clears throat) all I need is your vote.

Success, breathing and cues: the noise factor
If it hasn't been clear in our past articles, let us restate it: Sex is fun.
It can also be noisy.
This week, we decided to consult members of the Swarthmore community about
sex and noise. The general responses from
those who partake in the act indicated
that noise serves three primary purposes
when it comes to sex. First of all, it forces
you to breathe. According to numerous
studies, this has been shown to intensify
orgasms, not to mention the entire sensual experience.

seem so much more vocal than the

general population? Our guess, based upon
the seemingly artificial timing and consistency of the sounds, is that it's for the benefit of the viewers. But,
regardless of its authenticity, the presence of regular moaning in such films
underlines a key point: We

enjoy it.

"The best noise [during

sex] is to hear someone
say my name, first, middle
and last," Ms. C stated in a
reflective moment
"Hearing the pleasurareverberating off the wall
is one of the most enjoyable aspects of sex," Mr. D

Second, your noise level can cue a partner in to how you are doing.
"Noise is natural when things are going
right," Ms. B said.
It indicates what techniques are suc-

cessful or unsuccessful and what kind of
sex you're in the mood for, be it a nice fuck
or a romantic foray. This highlights the
not-so-obvious point that all sex is not

noisy.

For some, excessive noise is a sort of
alternative exhibitionism.
For those unwilling to be
seen, there is a thrill in the
fact that people can hear
what you're doing.
"The other people on
my hall are not having
enough sex," Mr. F said.
"I'm teaching through

escalate. Verbal communication about an(
during sex is absolutely key, but this takes
it a step further. It is not only about wha
you communicate, but also about the man
ner in which you do so. We'll leave the
examples to you.
Then, of course, there are the accidenta
noises, like the thump of the mattress or
headboard against the wall, punctuating
each movement. Or there's the yelp emit
ted when that new position required just a
little too much balance. It all adds to the
experience.
"[My bed] almost came apart once," Mr.
E remembered. "It's less squeaky than

"People should be leery

of assuming that I'm showing off some sexual
prowess," Ms. G said.
"Sometimes you have to

revel in the fact that your intrinsic desire is
to be loud."
A word to the wise, especially women: Do
not use noise to mislead a partner. Period.
"Some people fake it to indicate that the
experience [though not physically stimulating] is still worthwhile," Mr. H said.
But faking it can never work to anyone's
advantage, especially not your own. It is perfectly fine to be vocal and expressive when
you are not near (or, perhaps, even expecting to reach) orgasm. However, be clear
about what your noises mean. We are not
suggesting that you should tell your partner,
"Sorry, honey, it did nothing for me" after
every or even any session. But do make sure

worth it in the long run.
Finally, as most of us know, there are
obvious complications with a noise factor in
a dormitory setting. We received the entire
array of responses. There were the annoyed
interviewees:
"In my own fascist, dictator way," Ms. I
said with conviction, "my need for quiet and
sleep outweighs anyone's need/right for any
noise-making activities."
"What they need is some WD-40 and a
gag," Mr. J said.
"They should play music," Mr. K suggested. "I can study to music. I can't study to an
orgasm."

And then there were the words of praise:
"Get it, girl!" Ms. L said.
"We only pretend that it bothers us," Mr.
M said. "It gives us something to talk about."
But we digress. The point is that we all
live very close to each other. Most interviewees' responses were variants of "Welcome
to college. People have sex!" Further demonstrating that most people consider sexual
noises just a regular, if unpleasant, part of
campus life.

"There a distinction between overhearing it and being disturbed by it," Mr. N
insightfully pointed out.
But even the exhibitionists acknowledge
that engaging in poorly timed episodes is
simply inconsiderate. Be aware of the fact
that you have neighbors. If you're gonna be
loud, respect the quiet hours. Otherwise,

rock out!

The actions of these characters suggest that bizarre narra-

and paints more intimate pictures. Her images are full of

Davis' works tangle us in a

details, and painterly effects of
the mono print, many of her
works draw us in close to the
image and ensconce us in their
narratives. I agree with
Davis that they would be best
viewed in a book, when no one
else could catch us peeking into

fantasies. Her exhibition promises to be exquisitely unsettling and

Week 4: Arpita Parikh

�

leaving things

behind
The

last thing Arpita Parikh 'O4 said to
me as I walked out the door after our
interview was, "Don't say too much." I
think she meant to say that her pots and
sculptures speak for themselves. My words
will obfuscate some meanings, even as
they illuminate others.
Rather than speak authoritatively, I
want to share a few stories Parikh shared
with me, mixed with my own reflections
on her work. In this way, I hope to augment rather than dictate the viewer's experience of her pots and sculpture.
The work Parikh will be exhibiting can
3e divided into pots and baby sculptures.
She has created a huge number of each, concentrating on a few simple forms. But even
though the pots are all the same few shapes,
and the babies are all formed with the same
slab-built construction techniques, each
one is different. Parikh thinks of her pots
in "families" and glazes them in groups of
size and color. At the same time, I think
she considers both her pots and her
babies unique individuals.
Parikh is interested in decay and renewal, in tradition and modernization, and in
leaving things behind. She related two stories about Indian pots to me. On trains in
India, tea used to be sold in low-fired clay
cups. When the passengers were done with

their tea, they would throw the cups out the window. The clay was biodegradable and decomposed back into the earth. Now, the tea is sold in
plastic cups. Passengers still throw their cups
out the window, but now these imperishable
cups litter the countryside.
She also described an image she had seen of
a tree by a river in India. All around the tree
was a huge pile of pots. For many generations,
these pots had been left as offerings for health
and other prayers.
Parikh explainedwhat caught her attention
about this image: The people know their pots
will crumble into the earth eventually, return
to clay, and maybe be used again by another
potter generations later.

Parikh's ceramics also involve contain-

ment, community and nourishment. She
explained one of the inspirations for her cups
with hourglass figures and rounded bottoms.

She was thinking about sitting around
sharing a meal with others and peeking into
their dishes. What shape would allow her to
reach over and tip their cups toward herself
without the cups falling over? The flared edge
invites her finger to tip the cup, and the
rounded bottoms allows the vessel to rock
back to its center after she lets it go.

Parikh's

baby sculptures share some similar concerns about care, community and
leaving things behind. She expresses a lot of
concern and tenderness for them. Their limbs
easily break off, and she has to treat them
icately as she forms them, allows them to dry,
and places them in the kiln for firing. Earlier
this year, she began leaving wet, unfired
babies discreetly around campus. She can't
bring herself to desert any of the fired and
glazed babies. As she creates and cares for
them, she becomes attached. Even when she
abandoned the newly formed babies, she felt
ashamed.
For me, Parikh's work speaks most powrelationships
erfully about relationships
between families of pots, mother and child,
artist and artwork, and viewers and artwork. She wants to protect the mystery of
her bond with her pots and her babies, and
she wants viewers to form personal relationships with them.
Parikh's graceful shapes, rich colors and
handcrafted aesthetic will lure you in, and her
work will heighten your awareness of the delicate links among our lives.

Dubious honors
Swarthmore shows admirable commitment to the
principle that anyone who can make it here is the
equal of any other student. The college stands by this
principle in not recording class rank and not giving
out departmental honors based on GPA.
In other ways, however, students still feel the pressure to take on extra challenges, sometimes out of a
desire to outdo other students and gain prestige
rather than a genuine desire to learn and grow. The
most obvious example is the honors program.
The program has great value for most students
who take it, but it requires students to sacrifice
breadth of knowledge for depth. At an institution that
claims to value the liberal arts ideal of diversity of
educational experience and learning style, it's disingenuous for to subtly push one form of learning over
another.
The college makes many attempts to avoid doing
so, but the name "honors" itself and its appearance as
the only honorific on diplomas belies attempts to classify honors and course majors as equivalent. If admis-

sions tour guides are trained to use a value-neutral
term like "external examination option" rather than
"honors" for the program, there's no reason the college can't change the term as a matter of general policy. Presenting it simply as an option to let students
earn the chance to be examined by an external professional might reduce the feeling ofunfairness many
students have at the differing standards departments
have for the honors program.
In many cases there are course majors who end up
doing as much or more work than honors majors;
their choice to structure their educational experience
differently from others should be respected, and not
choosing to exercise the external examination option
should not be signified by the lack of an honorific.
Nor should professors in the course of advising pressure students to choose the honors program, and any
discrimination against course majors as less significant to a department's purpose ought to be minimized.
The honors program is a great opportunity, but
there are many diverse course menus and college
career plans that don't fit with it, and our egalitarian
college must take a strong stance against the unconscious attitudes and invisible policies that make one
system of study more "honorable" than another. Such
pressures feed into pressures from an outside world
that already stifles students' freedom to learn as they
choose by teaching them to value some kinds of learning as more profitable and marketable than others.
Swarthmore should staunchly avoid the kind of language that encourages such thinking.

Reflecting on joy and pain of study abroad
BY THOMAS SHOWALTER

tshowall@swarthmore.edu

I decided last year to leave the friendly confines of
Swarthmore to go away to Egypt for a semester. I had, at the
time, a lot of reasons. I was planning to be a religion major,
with a minor in political science. The Middle East is a hot
spot for both of those fields. I was also experiencing a bit of
the wanderlust that strikes so many people our age. Like any
good Swattie, I had an idealistic reason, too: I hoped that I
could, in some small way, be a cultural ambassador, lessening the misunderstandings that divide the peoples of
America and this region. Those were my reasons before I

came.
What I have found, studying at the American University

in Cairo, is something short of ideal. AUC is the university

for the children of the rich and powerful. Hosni Mubarak

graduated from here. Sadat's grandkid is going here right

now. There is conspicuous consumption here on a scale that
I have never seen before. This, in a city where the poverty
rate is well over half. However, what is really shocking about
AUC is the complacency. A lot of students here just don't
seem to care about much beyond their social lives. In one of
my political science classes, the professor recently gave the
class an extra weekend to complete a paper because only
three people (the author included) in the 18-person class
turned it in on time. All three of these people were studyabroad students.
At any rate, I came to Egypt expecting to learn about life
for the typical Egyptian. I had no idea that much of my learn-

to

ing would be about the children of the Egyptian upper crust.
I have learned a little about the "man on the street" while eating from street carts and talking to the locals in my badly
broken Arabic. They love Americans and envy us greatly.
They hate Bush and are always happy to find an American
who will ridicule him with them. Cairenes assume that all
Americans are rich (which, relatively speaking, we all are)
and, therefore, one big sales opportunity. Everyone, it seems,
has something to sell or knows someone who does. This is
gets very irritating, but it has been more than made up for by
the rest of my time here.
My trips in the Middle East have been amazing. In fact, I
had no idea that a preponderance of my memories would
come from trips. Both in and out of Egypt, my time on the
road has been truly life-changing. From the temples in Luxor
to the Old City of Jerusalem on Good Friday to sleeping
under the stars in the Jordanian desert, I have had an
unmatched opportunity to travel. In truth, these months
have turned into holidays punctuated by weekdays, or at
least that's how I imagine it. The routine at AUC gets old
quickly arid I don't have enough work to keep busy through
the weekends.
Nevertheless, I'll be ready to go back. That surprises me.
I was afraid I'd be one of the study-abroad kids who never
want to go back. Yet it's tiring, being here, engulfed in a
world not my own, and my Arabic isn't good enough to make
living here permanently fun. I'm looking forward to crawling back inside the bubble, come next fall. Ifnothing else, it'll
be nice to be back somewhere where people not only buy
their textbooks, but read them.

Closed groups harm true diversity
Dear Editor:
I am writing in appreciation and support of the open
and honest comments by Wee Chua 'O6 ("Closed support
group funding under review," April 15, pg. 3).
Too often, the dialogue on racial issues at Swarthmore
is stunted by the silence of those who have an alternative
approach to achieving a truly diverse community, and

Chua deserves praise for his willingness to speak out
openly with a viewpoint that goes against the status quo

of unity through separation.
While it is easy to embrace the concept of "support"
April

22. 2004

that closed groups may. provide, it is often more difficult
to see the subtle and nuanced ways in which creating separate spaces, in both our physical and social community,

perpetuate the racial divisions that have plagued our
country since its creation.
I can only hope that those truly interested in creating
a strong sense of community will heed Chua's words and
remain open to the positive influence of those who are
willing to work beyond the safe envelope of segregated
"support" networks in pursuit of a stronger Swarthmore.

Questioning Phoenix's ideology
Editorial objections to columnist's chosen format problematic
Dear Editor:
On April 12th, we attended the Phoenix's open editorial meeting on "the role of an opinions column in the
paper." Taru Taylor, an opinions columnist whose PanAfrican analyses are grounded in philosophy, initiated
the meeting after receiving concerned e-mails from his
superiors. They expressed concern that for many rea-

sons, Taylor's column was becoming "increasingly out
of place" with respect to the rest of the paper. Given
their statements, we were under the strong impression
that Taylor would not be re-hired for the fall of 2004.
At the outset of the meeting, Taylor asked his colleagues and superiors, "Is
it mandatory that opinions columnists conform
to an orthodoxy?" (The

question was one of nineteen questions that Taylor
had emailed to them earlier on April 9.) Those who
responded seemed to have
different opinions on the
weaknesses of his column,

but we

tent, Taylor's opinions column alienates Phoenix readers that "are here to learn, but not learn 24/7." For example, "mainstream" audiences are unable to engage
Taylor's column because they are unfamiliar with intellectuals such as Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther
King, Jr. They praised the work of Randy Goldstein, who
builds a Republican, Zionist ideology without using
"inaccessible" jargon or "obscure" cultural references.

archal discourse, Taylor's voice is a welcome challenge
to the hegemony which The Phoenix serves. In the
interest of serving the paper's perceived "mainstream"
audience, his superiors' explicit request, made at the
meeting, to "dumb down" (water down?) his column
would inadvertently defeat its goal of promoting dialogue on campus. Additionally, because Zionism is within The Phoenix's hegemony, the discussion of
Palestine/Israel would appear "culturally relevant and
accessible" to the paper's perceived audience. In other
words, we cautioned, socially constructed audiences are
relative to the reigning hegemony.
Overall, our criticism

sticks for life
Of course, rich, suburban, coke-smoking teens need not
bat an eyelash or even put down the pipe. The ban, like
many drug war tactics, affects mostly minorities and poor
students. More than 55 percent of convicted drug offenders
are black, though black people make up 12.7 percent of the
population (and only a slightly higher percentage of drug
users). So the policy works as a kind of reverse affirmative
action, allowing the slimy racial and economic profiling
that occurs in the law enforcement world to ooze into the
sphere of higher education and making it even more difficult to break down race and class barriers.
What's more, poor offenders, cut off from the chance to
attend college, are understandably more likely to repeat

their offenses and cultivate new ones, like selling drugs.
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the more education an ex-convict receives, the less likely she is to commit another crime. It's not exactly linear algebra.
Even Rep. Mark Souder (R-Ind.), the guy who wrote the
law, agrees that it sucks.

"It is absurd on the face of it," he told The New York
Times last month. "I am an evangelic Christian who
believes in repentance, so why would I have supported
that?"
Souder insists the Clinton and Bush administrations
have twisted the law. Like many weapons of the drug war,
instead of offering chances for "repentance," it keeps the
missiles firing long, long after the last joint has been
snuffed.
Now a new, opposing bill is up for consideration
proposed by Souder himself. Under the policy, only students
convicted of drug offenses while enrolled in college would
lose aid, and offenders could re-apply for funding after one
year. The policy leaves some oomph to be desired. Poor and
minority college students would still be hit hardest at a
time when financial aid cuts and tuition increases are
already driving many to drop out. Clearly, further steps
need to be taken to get the aid law repealed in full.
But what if even the current, weak proposal doesn't

pass?

Souder, my favorite Indiana Republican and new best
friend, says it's time to rumble.
"I know I'm a conservative and I'm not supposed to say
this, but there are lawsuits to be had here," he told The
Times.
Right on, Soudie. Even those of us who aren't so evangelical sometimes believe in second chances. And in a society where education can make or break an economic lifetime, letting a few joints get in the way of 70 years of a person's future seems like some pretty funny math. Providing
financial aid to all who need it is a critical step in reaching
educational equality in America
and, as Soudie knows,
we've got a long way to go.

Opinions
Don't water us down
This is my last column, and
it's a bit of a digression. It's not

about technology. Something
more pressing has come to my
attention, a bit closer to home.

We're nearing the end of
year
another
here
at
Swarthmore, bringing us all
one step closer to graduation
(or, in some cases, right up to
it). So let's reflect on the past
years for a moment.

EVAN HENSLEIGH
Technological Misfit

Remember that day when
you got accepted? A beam of
light shone down from the heavens. Angels called out your
name. It was a joyous time

indeed.

Four years and $160,000 later,
you'll get a Swarthmore diploma to show for all your hard work. That's right. Four years of
work for a piece of paper from a scarcely-heard-of institution.
While the admissions office is working on a video to convince

prospective students that Swarthmore isn't as intense as it's
cracked up to be, let's face it. We go here. We've takenthe courses. We've lived through this place. We know they're lying.

Why are we creating a video designed
to convince students Swarthmore isn't
intense, when it clearly is?
Every student I've encountered who's ever gone abroad,

transferred (to or from) or studied at another college has said
the same thing: Swarthmore is harder. Not just a little bit harder; they said that other places are cakewalks in comparison.
Consider, for a moment, what your grades might look like if
you'd gone to Harvard, where the average GPA is 3.8 and 90 percent of the graduating class receives honors. And yet, Dean
Gross admonishes us, "You shouldn't come out feeling as
though Swarthmore is something that's been done to you."

Of course, it isn't. We do it to ourselves. How many people do
you know here who are planning to receive "just a major"? It
seems as though most everyone is doing pre-med or a minor
(roughly comparable achievements), if not a double major
and that's to say nothing of the honors program. And sports.
And extracurriculars. And living wage campaigns.
So, take a moment to consider. You're paying money to
receive more work and lower grades than your fellows at Ivy
League colleges. Sure, lower grades are no problem for places
that have heard of us. But many positions have a GPA requirement, and if you don't meet it and they haven't heard of
Swarthmore, they won't even look at your application. So, grad
schools and non-profits, yes; jobs west of D.C., no. Perhaps we
should have a formulaic shadow GPA to show potential employers: "This is what my GPA is; this is what my college says my
GPA would have been at another college."
One wonders, then, what the point of the admissions video
is. Why are we creating a video designed to convince students
Swarthmore isn't intense, when it clearly is? If we want to limit
our reputation for being so hard core, why is our solution to try
and spin people into thinking that it isn't so bad, rather than
making it so? Is it to raise admissions yield? This will surely

backfire if we attract students who are looking for a less intense
atmosphere and transfer away when they realize what they've
gotten into.
What I think is more alarming is that there's been no discussion in the community at large over whether this is something we ought to be doing. Shouldn't we try to increase
Swarthmore's reputation for being intense? If we're doing this
to ourselves, on some level we approve of the workload. Maybe
we should be telling the world Swarthmore is hard, hard, hard.
If you want to go to college to have fun, go to Harvard. If you
want a focused, intense learning experience, come to

Swarthmore.
While I certainly agree that Swarthmore gives a first-rate
education, perhaps second to none, let's have some candor. This
is not a low-pressure college. Our reputation for being intense
is nothing if not deserved, even if we bring it upon ourselves.
The admissions office shouldn't lie to get students to come here.
It's time we had a serious debate about the direction in which
our college and its image are being taken.

Jumping out of the melting pot, into fire
A shrinking white majority raises the specter of a racially polarized U.S.
BY ED WAY

ewayl@swarthmore.edu
Is it time to throw out the "melting pot"?
Could genocide happen in the United States?
Columnist Taru Taylor would probably point out that
white Americans are today the beneficiaries of genocide against Africans and American Indians. Will it
happen again?
I fear that within our lifetimes we will see widespread racial violence and ethnic cleansing, though

maybe not genocide. With American whites predicted
to become a minority around 2050, the United States
in this century will experience a demographic transformation that only a few other countries have experienced in recent memory. Their history is not comforting.

ing. In 1984, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics; at
the time, Croats, Serbs and Muslims were intermarrying and appeared to be living in peace. From 1961 to
1991, the percentage of Muslims in Bosnia rose from 26
percent to 43 percent, while the percentage of Serbs
fell from 44 percent to 31 percent. With the breakup of
Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serbs feared they would be marginalized in an independent Bosnia, a fear that gave
birth to ethnic cleansing.
This history makes me feel very ambivalent about
the idea of trading in the metaphor of "America as
melting pot" for "America as tossed salad." I am glad
America's 20th-century history unfolded as it did,
with Germans, English, Italians and others becoming
"white." This was certainly a much happier experience than that of the Balkans, where Yugoslavs

became Croats, Muslims and Serbs.

cede power. The result
was almost 20 years of civil war.
There are many obvious differences between
Lebanon and the United States, but skeptics bear the
burden of explaining why a similar story has unfolded in at least two other countries, thousands of miles
apart, with different histories and cultures
but similar demographic experiences.
One of these countries is Fiji, where the population
is closely divided between native Fijians (50 percent)
and Indian-Fijians (around 45 percent). Fiji experienced military coups in 1987 and again in May 2000,
both times orchestrated by native-Fijian army leaders

who wanted to restore Fijian control after Indians
were democratically elected to power. For most of the
past 15 years, Fiji has had an apartheid-like system in
which Indians are second-class citizens.
The history of Bosnia is particularly disconcert-

dominantly European, but,
for the sake of argument,

assume for a moment that
this mulatto identity could
be equal parts American
Indian, Asian, European,

African and Hispanic. Would it still be undesirable for
Americans of different races to become one people?

There are, of course, many positive aspects to preserving separate identity and diversity. In the interest
of dialogue, I have focused on one of the potential
risks. This risk is real. America's demographic future
is much more similar to the countries I've mentioned
than to (comparatively) peaceful nations like
Malaysia. If by the 2050s whites see themselves as
sharply distinct from other Americans, Taylor's
columns do not give much hope that they will prove to
be any more generous or tolerant than the native

Fijians, Lebanese Christians or Bosnian Serbs.
Defining Americans mainly as members of competing
groups sets the stage for ethnic cleansing. I doubt race
theory is the full picture. But if people believe it is,
the future's bleak.

Toward a truly compassionate institution
BY BARRY SCHWARTZ
bschwarl@swarthmore.edu
I have spent almost two years co-chairing the college's
Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage. Now that the report
is public, I want to offer my personal views on why it is
important that the college adopt the report's recommendations. I emphasize that what follows reflects only my
opinion and not the committee's.
How much should people be paid for the work they do?
Does it ever make sense to say that some people are overpaid while others are underpaid? Is it possible to say
whether people get what they "deserve"?
No one, so far as I know, knows how to answer these
questions in a way that commands general agreement.
We have managed to avoid social paralysis, or violent
struggle, by agreeing collectively to let the "magic" of the
market determine what people get paid. But it's important to keep in mind that the market doesn't solve the
problem offair compensation so much as it avoids it. We
shrug our collective shoulders and let the market do what

it will.

Then along comes the "living wage" movement.
According to the movement, everyone who works should
earn enough to support him or herself without having to
take a second job. As I interpret it, the "should" in the last
sentence is not about fairness. Instead it's about recognition of common humanity and about compassion. It's
about acknowledging that while work should be part of
life, it shouldn't have to be all of life. Perhaps in every
society, but certainly in a rich society like ours, there
should be enough generosity for us to enable everyone to
live a decent, balanced life.
I use the terms "compassion" and "generosity." This
might suggest that paying a living wage is an act of charity. It isn't. In order to think of the living wage as charity,
we must subscribe to the view that the market wage itself
is what people are "really" entitled to. But what I've suggested is that the market doesn't settle the "fair wage"
issue; it avoids it. It is what people will be earning if compassion and generosity don't intervene. It may take a
while for people to stop thinking of a living wage as charity, but such is the power of habits of thinking and prac-

THE PHOENIX

tice that have been accepted far too uncritically for far too

long.
Of course Swarthmore can afford to pay living compensation. The real question is not "Can we afford it?"
but "How important is it?" Need-blind admissions and
full-need financial aid are far more expensive than living
compensation. We don't ask of these policies whether we
can afford them; we ask, "How will we pay for them?" The
commitment to pay Swarthmore faculty 2.5 percent more
than the elite competition pays, and perhaps 40 percent
more than colleges in general pay, is more expensive than
living compensation. But again, we don't ask if we can
afford to do this; we ask how we will pay for it.
I believe that a commitment to living compensation
should be as central to the college's mission as anything
we do. I think it is directly analogous to our commitment
to need-blind admission and full-need financial aid.
Financial aid is not a "right"; it is not something that our

students ofmodest means have "earned." But neither is it

charity. It is a manifestation of a compassionate and generous institution. Perhaps after we get used to a "living
compensation" policy, we may come to feel the same way

aboutit as we do about financialaid neither earned nor
unearned, not charity; just what a decent institution does.
But still, why is the compensation ofkitchen help and
cleaning staff as central to the college's mission as needblind admission and a well-paid faculty? Why shouldn't it
be viewed as a "nice" thing to do if and when we have
some extra money? The answer, in my opinion, is this: I

don't think an institution can be humane in the world
without also being humane inside its gates. It is nice to
join other institutions in combating apartheid by disinvesting in South Africa. It is nice to pressure the boards
of corporations in which we own stock to put policies in
place that protect the rights and dignity of gays and lesbians. But it is essential that we treat our own with

Spain has cowered in the face of
militant Islam.
incumbent People's Party was favored to win Spain's parliamentary election. The tragedy in Madrid, however, instilled
new fear in the Spanish people, who voted in favor of the
Socialist Workers' Party, making Zapatero their new prime
minister. Zapatero, who campaigned against the decision to
invade Iraq, was not only the candidate ofchoice of the Spanish
people but of the terrorists whose attacks influenced the vote.
The Madrid train station was bombed just days before the elections, but the terrorists' mission was not fulfilled until the
Spanish public entered the voting booths.
By electing the SocialistWorkers' Party and withdrawing its
soldiers from Iraq, Spain has thus cowered in the face of militant Islam. It has demonstrated weakness and an inability to
take a stand against its enemies. What is worse, however, is the
implicit message that terrorizing an innocent civilian population is an effective method of coercion. Al-Qaida, on behalf of
the Iraqi insurgency, was successful not only in punishing the
Spanish people, but also in scaring Spain out of Iraq.
Spain's withdrawal is not only confidence-inspiring to Iraqi
resistance but also a burden on the coalition. Poland, which
commanded Spain's troops in south-central Iraq, must now
scramble for replacements. Though Albania and Ukraine,
among others, have stepped up with offers of replacement, 1,400
soldiers will be difficult to replace.
The loss of force, however, is not the worst result of Spain's
actions. By demonstrating such fickle foreign policy between
leaders, Spain has called into question the resolution of the

coalition. If one coalition member of the European Union is so
easily removed from Iraq, what is to stop terrorists from thinking the same of other members? The sad fact is that, with Spain
removed from Iraq, additional countries will be targeted in an
effort to create a hollow shell in which the Iraq insurgency may
gain power in Iraq.
Having willingly participated in the toppling of the Iraqi dictatorship, Spain has a duty to ensure the creation of a free and
safe Iraq. By withdrawing its troops, it has abandoned this duty
and dealt a blow to the remaining forces. Worse, it has, as

President Bush said, "[given] false comfort to terrorists."
Spam's demonstration does note bode well for civilians in

Europe and the rest of the world. The next terrorized country,
one hopes, will demonstrate greater resilience.

A weekend of personal bests for track
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND

Both men's and women's track

and field excelled last Saturday at
Widener, posting a slew of personal best times, heights and distances
at
the
Widener
Invitational in a solid overall
showing.
For the men, Vernon Chaplin
'O7 recorded the second-best 800
time in school history with 1:55.90
,while teammate Dillon McGrew
'O7 finished with a personal-best
1:57.44. Matt Williams 'O4 placed
fifth in the 400 hurdles for the
Garnet, running a personal best
of 55.50, which garnered the the
fourth spot on Swarthmore's alltimebest list. Tyler Lyson 'O6 also
recorded a personal best of 5L22
in the 400 for Swarthmore,
enough to rank ninth in the

record books.
Several runners also posted
times
for
personal
best
Swarthmore in the 1500 meters,
as Garret Ash 'O5 and Keefe

Keeley 'O6 led the pack with times
of 4:05.99 and 4:1L29. Adam Hunt

'O6, Jim Kreft 'O6, Alex Elkins 'O6,
Javier Prado 'O6 and Ben Morgan
'O5 also posted personal bests for
the Tide in the 1,500 to help the
overall Swarthmore effort.
"It was a good chance to see
some real good competition,"
Keeley said. "It was great that a
lot of people ran personal records,

and I think it has the team confident and hopeful coming into conferences."
In the field events, Swarthmore also qualified Wee Chua 'O6
for the Centennial Conference
Championships in shot put, as

a

personal-best

throw with 8.91 meters.
"I'm very excited about qualifying for the conference championships," Chua said. "It was
especially nice to qualify now,
because I was four centimeters
short the last weekend at the
Delaware Invitational. I've
improved over 10 feet since I
first starting throwing last
spring, and it was a real nice
surprise to qualify for the
Championships in my last throw
of the season."
For the women, Sarah Hobbs

the Tide, each posting a top-five

finish in their events. Hobbs ran
a personal-best time of 18:54.40 in
the 5,000

Swarthmore's all-time
while Zagory tied for

Maila Sepri 'O5 recorded a per-

sonal best for Swarthmore, running 800 meters, as did Darcy
Nelson 'O6 and Nicole Oberfoell

Three other Garnet runners
posted personal bests, all in the

of step with today's labor laws. So i
looks like the NFL's age limit wi
stand, at least for the time being.
So is this a good thing? Obviously, it depends on who you are. The
NFL's argument is that its age limit is good for everybody involved. It's
good for the college players, because it helps ensure that none of them
jump to the NFL before they are ready to play. It's good for the NFL's
players, because it protects the jobs of established veterans, which is
the main objective of the Players Association. In the long run, it's good
for the league, because it helps maintain a higher quality of play. At
least that's what the NFL is saying.
We think these arguments are mostly right. The philosophy
behind the NFL's arguments is that football is a sport in which the
physical requirements of playing professionally are so demanding
that very few underclassmen would have what it takes. In this argument, the NFL is protecting cocky underclassmen from leaving early,
getting to the NFL and going, "Uh-oh, these guys are big and this
game is fast. I'm in over my head. Looks like I'll be selling insurance
in two years."
In truth, these paternalistic arguments bother us. The NFL is
absolutely right in protecting its own game from what would assuredly be a marked decline in the quality of play if the average age of the
league were to gradually descend. And the Players Association is perfectly right to protect its members from workers who are outside the
union. But we're a little put off when the NFL is arguing that it is protecting naive college underclassmen. Football is different from other

90%

sports.
Look at baseball. Many, if not most, of America's professional baseball players leave for the minors right out of high school. This has gone
on for decades, and nobody seems to mind. The physical demands of
baseball are relatively low, especially in the low minor leagues. Most
high school baseball prospects are physically developed enough; the
areas they need to work on are mostly hand-eye coordination, mechanics and game sense.
Basketball is somewhere between baseball and the hypothetical football situation. More and more players are coming out after high school
or only one year of college, with wildly varying degrees of success. Most
of the better ones (Leßron James, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant) are
physically developed enough to maximize their talents within a few
years. Sure, they endure growing pains, but most of them are due to
problems of endurance (the NBA season is at least four times longer
than an average high school season) and a lack of fundamentals and
game sense. Even some players that never amount to much more than
a league average starter (Kwame Brown, Darius Miles) can't blame
their troubles on their own physical development. And most of the total
washouts can blame their fate on injury or emotional breakdown.
So what about football? Yes, it's true, playing football takes even
more physical development than playing basketball. For one thing, the
game is violent. A player who is extremely undersized runs the risk of
being severely injured. But the problem in the NFL's paternalistic
arguments is that these undersized or underdeveloped players are not
going to be leaving college early. At least for now, the only players leaving college early are studs. Mike Williams was projected to go in the
first round. Clarett was projected in the second or third rounds, but
remember, this is after a year of sitting out. And most of these players
leaving early are at the skill positions, where size is less of a factor. In
the "win now" environment of the NFL, I don't think many GMs would
be willing to take a project player over an upperclassman who could
help the team immediately. Undersized and underdeveloped college
players wouldn't be leaving for the NFL in droves, and most underclassmen who would leave (and whom teams would be willing to draft)
would be (physically) ready for the NFL. While the NFL has other convincing arguments regarding keeping underclassmen out of the league,
the argument that it is for their own good rings hollow.

Shoremen top men's tennis in conference matchup
BY DARCY NELSON

dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

In a matchup of teams ranked at the top
of the nation and the Atlantic South
Region, the Garnet dropped a tough match

to

Washington College. Washington,
ranked 19th nationally, sat one spot above

the Garnet.
The teams went head-to-head Friday in
a match that may have previewed the first
round of the NCAA tournament. Though

the Garnet lost to Washington, as long as
they defeat Haverford on Wednesday, they
will clinch a spot in the tournament that
will match them against the Shoremen
again. The match against Haverford looks
favorable, considering the Garnet have not

lost to them since 1952.
Earlier in the season, Washington lost
close matches to Mary Washington and
Washington and Lee, two powerhouses the
Garnet have also lost to.
"We knew we had to play pretty well to
beat them," Jon Reiss 'O7 said. "We started
off with doubles and were able to win third
doubles, but the number-one and two spots
had tough matches and lost." The Garnet
started out down 0-1 after the completion of
the doubles matches. Reiss and Ben Rae 'O4

won 8-3 at number-three doubles, though
Frank Visciano 'O4 and Mike Noreika 'O4
lost at number-one doubles to Pete Taylor
and Asfand Farouk, 8-1. Visciano and
Noreika were ranked second in the region,

while Taylor and Farouk were ranked
eighth.

"Doubles was disappointing," Visciano
said. "We played nervous." Zac Rodd 'O6

and Brian Park 'O6 lost to Vivian Chhetri
and Arturo Solis at number-two
2. "I definitely feel that we
stronger doubles," Reiss said.
In singles play, Visciano
picked up victories at number

doubles, 8can play

and Park
three and
number five. Visciano defeatedSolis 7-6, 64, while Park breezed past Tim Riskie, 6-1,
6-3.
"Brian played really well. He blew the
kid off the court," Visciano said. Rodd
played Taylor at the number-one spot but
lost a tough match 6-1, 6-2. Taylor is the

third-ranked player in the nation. At the
number-two spot, Reiss battled Chhetri, an
international student from Delhi, India.

The two players split sets, but the match

was already decided. Reiss dropped the
first set and won the next.
Once Justin Durand 'O5 had lost his
match, Reiss and Chhetri played a super

tie-breaker, where they play to 10, win by
two.
"I got up early, but ended up missing
some easy shots. The credit really goes to
[Chhetri], though. He played very well,"

Reiss said.
Still, Reiss' teammates admired his
play against Chhetri. "Had he played out
the last set, I think he would have won it,"
Visciano said. "That also would have
made the score closer at 4-3."
At the number-four spot, Farouk defeat-

ed Rae, 6-3, 6-3. Durand lost to Maciek
Prytula, 6-3, 6-4. "What we were trying to
do was to be really strong at the bottom of
the lineup. We have a deep team, and that
is where we will pick up our wins,"
Visciano said.
Four of Washington's top players are
international recruits. Farouk is from
Karachi, Pakistan, Chhetri is from Delhi,
India, Solis is from Guatemala City,
Guatemala, and Prytula is from Szczecin,

Poland. Solis and Chhetri are both recruits
who came to Washington at the beginning
of this semester. Washington has also historically been very successful. Their win
against the Garnet makes this the 20th consecutive season that Washington has had at
least 10 victories.

"We went in thinking we could win
doubles," Noreika said. "We will next
time. Also, we know we can win at least
three singles. They are tough up at the top,
but they fall off at the bottom of the lineup."
"We needed to have a strong performance and a strong day of playing," Reiss
said. "Some of us played well, although others weren't able to perform at as high a
level that day as we wanted to."
The loss against Washington "was disappointing, but chances are we will see this
exact same team in the first round of the
tournament," Visciano said. The team is
looking forward to the first round of the
tournament.
"We played them tough. It could have
easily been 4-3," Noreika said. "There are
some things we know we need to work on
for next time. The doubles will be really
important, because it swings the momentum of the match for whichever team wins
it."
The Garnet is now 7-7 overall, and
Washington has a 10-5 record. "We will take
the loss with a grain of salt and learn from
it," Visciano said. "Everybody played
tough, and it was a good draw. Live and
learn."

Softball splits doubleheader over Fords, halts losing streak
BY COLTON BANGS

cbangsl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore softball faced Haverford Tuesday to continue the renowned Centennial Conference rivalry. The
Garnet Tide (7-20, 3-11 CC) split a pair of close games with
the Fords, who came into the game in the bottom of the

pack in the conference.
If the story of the doubleheader for the Tide were an
equation, solid pitching would be the constant and defense
the variable.

"Both of our pitchers pitched great," Val Marone 'O5
said. The Tide was backed by great performances from
young pitchers Emily Remus 'O6 and Marianne
Klingaman 'O7. In game one, Remus kept her team close
despite three Swarthmore errors. The Fords used these
errors to capitalize on their five hits and put four runs on
the board.

Marone was the only base runner to cross home for the
Garnet in the 4-1 loss. "There were definitely plays in the
first game that we missed and needed to make. I don't
think we are supporting our pitching because of the
errors we make," Mary Mintel 'O5 said.
Game two was another low-scoring affair, but this time
the Garnet achieved the result they were looking for. In a
one run game, a two-out single in the fifth by Val Maulbeck
'O6 again drove home Marone for the solo run. Klingaman

kept the Fords scoreless, giving up only three hits while
fanning four batters. It was her fourth win of the season.
The defense showed up in the second game to back
Klingaman and help preserve the shutout.
"We really pulled through in the second game and
played a much cleaner game defensively. I just hope we
can carry through with that the rest of the season," Mintel
said. Maulbeck led the offense, going two for two with an
RBI in the win.
The Garnet again had problems with offensive production against Haverford, with Marone scoring the only two
runs in the doubleheader. While the Garnet were more
successful in making contact at the plate, this did not
equate to greater offensive production. "We definitely
could be hitting more, but when we do get those solid hits,
they tend to be right at the defense," Mintel said.
Because of these problems, the Garnet were unable to
pick up conference wins in other action this week. They
lost a game 4-0 to Ursinus Sunday, while Klingaman gave
up no earned runs.

Saturday, the Garnet dropped a pair of games to the
Diplomats of Franklin and Marshall, falling 1-0 in game
two.
"I think we started to play better again this weekend.
It was frustrating to play so well and not be able to get the

win," Klingaman said.
"We are making strides in correcting some of the shortages we've been having on offense. Especially against
Franklin and Marshall, we were more optimistic. We were
hitting a lot more aggressively when we got to the plate,"
Marone said. Marone went 2-3 and had an RBI in the game.
One has to go back to Thursday's doubleheader against
Washington College to find the last Swarthmore victory,
when Mintel's three-run homer brought the Garnet in
front for a 3-2 come-from-behind victory. Down 1-2 in the
count, Mintel got hold of the next pitch and sent it sailing
over the left-field wall to give the Garnet the upper hand.
April 22,

2004

The hit was the first home run for the team this season
"I was more surprised than anybody. It was great and I
was really excited about it, but it's just one swing and I
know I need to be hitting more consistently. A lot of people
have actually been hitting the ball that hard, but they have
been hitting right to the outfielders," Mintel said.
The Garnet move to eighth place in the conference.
The team will look to find the gaps on Thursday when
they host the Neumann Knights in a doubleheader at 3
p.m. The Knights are 11-15 on the season and are in sixth
place with a 7-9 record in the Pennsylvania Athletic
Conference.

NBA musings
Last year I recall sitting in the lower deck of the Staples
Center, staring with one eye across the court at Dustin Hoffman's
hot brunette daughter and the other eye at the conglomeration of
Laker Girls behind one of the baskets ready to take the court during a timeout. So take it from me
when I say that, out of all the stadiums and arenas around the
country (and I have been to my
fair share and then some), the
Staples Center during a Lakers
game has by far the best collection of talent available. I didn't
bother
watching the
game.
Instead of following the action on
the floor, my eyes joyfully spent
the game scanning the crowd.

Of course, the Lakers have talent on the court, too, led by the
best player in the league, Kobe
Bryant. (That same game, every

and even if they aren't, Kobe can take over a game any time he
feels like it. Look for the Lakers to emerge from the West.
Though all the action is in the West, the East deserves mention only because everybody else tends to overlook them. Clearly,
the three best teams in the East are the Pistons, Pacers and Nets,
all of whom rolled to first-game victories in their series.
Regardless of who emerges from this side of the Mississippi,
though it will likely be the Pacers, no team has the firepower to
match up with the big centers and athleticism of the Western
Conference teams. With Karl Malone finally playing for a title,
and Shaq and Kobe playing perhaps their last year together,
nobody will be able to stop the Lakers on their quest for the

championship.

output that night to fill up the box score, but Kobe listened to the
guy behind me and did take it to the hole. Of course, this was several months after the fact, as Kobe took it backdoor to the wrong
hole.) Currently, the Lakers lead the Rockets 2-0 in their first
round playoff matchup. For those of you walking around campus
reading this column, unaware the NBA playoffs are even taking
place, keep reading as I offer my NBA playoff preview.
Currently in the first round of playoffs, the NBA offers no
intriguing current matchups, except for maybe the LakersRockets, where Shaq, the most dominating player in the league,
is matched up against Yao Ming. After an atrocious first game
that saw both teams with shooting percentages nearly equivalent
to the team batting average of the Swarthmore baseball team, better games promise to be in store. Shaq played a poor game two,
but Kobe stepped right in and led them to victory. This does not
bode well for the rest of the league, seeing as how the Lakers can
be at their worst and still find a way to win. For a team that starts
four future Hall of Famers, expectations for the Lakers are high,
as they are the favorites to win the title for the fourth time in five
years.
Perhaps the only hope the other 15 playoff teams have is that
Yao wears down Shaq so much in the first round that Shaq is
unable to match up against last year's MVP Tim Duncan in the
second round. Though the Spurs won the title last year, the supporting cast around Tim Duncan is not the same with the retirement of the Admiral. The Lakers' perennial rival, the Kings,
have seemed out of rhythm since the return of their star Chris
Webber. Peja Stojakovic's production has slipped, and Webber
has not been the same since he tore his knee in last year's playoffs. True, he hasn't recently called any illegal timeouts or lied
about receiving funds from athletic boosters, but his explosion is
not the same as it was, and he is a defensive liability. The Kings
must find a way, as they did in round one, to get strong contributions from both of their superstars. If they can, the Kings can
be dangerous.
Congratulations to Minnesota for finally winning the first
game of a series. The Timberwolves have lost in the first round
of the playoffs the past seven years in a row, but, with the additions of Sam Cassell and Latrell Sprewell this year, the Wolves
have played themselves to the top seed in the West and home
court advantage throughout the playoffs. If the Big Three can
contribute as they did during the regular season, they are nearly

when Swarthmore's offense came

alive. Goldstein hit a bases-loaded

triple to round out a four-run
inning for the Garnet and cut the

ing 6-4.

Alex Ryan-Bond ’07 pitched a
complete game in his first college
start for the Garnet. He struck out

patience at the plate was rewarded
as he went one for two and drew
two walks on the day. Wes Sconce

’04 also completed his third game
in two days at catcher, part of over
30 innings of work he put in
behind the plate over the weekend.
“The whole team started hitting

the ball much better and carried
that over into Friday and both
games on Saturday,” Goldstein
said.

The Garnet took to the dia-

mond Sunday for their second
doubleheader in as many days,
this time against top-ranked Johns
Hopkins. In the first game, despite
sending four pitchers to the
mound, Swarthmore could not
stop the Blue Jays, who scored in
every inning. The Tide hung

tough, eventually dropping the
game 3-10. Chamberlain went two
for three, and Goldstein hit his
second triple of the season to

power the offense.
Fighting fatigue and sweltering
heat in the second game, the
Garnet fell behind early and were

Jays

crossed^^F

in the first three

innings, and the

onslaught never stopped.
“They were pretty good, but we
didn’t have the guys or the energy

to put forth our best effort,” Fisher

said.

Swarthmore wraps up its season with a doubleheader at rival
Haverford Saturday.
