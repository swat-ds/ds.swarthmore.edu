Bush takes presidency
Students gather in Upper Tarble until the early hours of the morning to watch election returns
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu

This time we didn't have to wait
through endless recounts and legal handwringing.
The television networks took their
calling the closest swing states for
either President George Bush or the

time

Democratic challenger Sen. John

Kerry,

but when all was said and done
which
was only at 2 p.m. yesterday, when Kerry
gave his official concession speech
Bush had been re-elected as president. In
addition, Republicans had picked up more
seats in both the Senate and House of
Representatives to increase their majorities in both houses of Congress.
To the multitude watching the vote
returns at a party hosted by the
Swarthmore Voter Registration Coalition
in Upper Tarble, the reality of who would
be president set in when Tom Brokaw of
NBC called Ohio and its 20 electoral votes
for Bush at about 12:30 a.m., all but guaranteeing the election for Bush.

"We did everything we
could on our end. There
isn't any more Swatties
could've done, and that's
comforting."
Eric Cooperman 'O7
Political science professor Keith
Reeves 'BB was cautious in describing
what lasting significance this election
foretelles of changes in American society.
"My sense is we're not sure. It's clearly
the case there have been some shifts in the
American populace, particularly on cultural issues. We'll be looking to see if
those shifts are permanent or temporary,"
he said.
He noted that cultural issues may have
had a particularly significant effect, especially in Ohio, which had a ballot initiative on the legality of gay marriage in this
election. "The early evidence suggests
that the gay marriage initiative certainly
energized the Republican base and more
rural, conservative voters. That mobilization was really quite effective," he said.
For those who supported Kerry, the
prospect of a second term of Bush's presidency was daunting. "I feel a little befuddled and numb," said Gabriel Rogers 'O5.
"It's pretty overwhelming to think of what
it will be like to have Bush for four more
years."

Nathaniel Peters 'O7, who voted for
Bush though he said he was not comfortable with all of Bush's policies, had a more
optimistic assessment. "I'm hopeful that
the next four years will be better than the
last four years," he said.
SVRC president Ethan Ucker 'O7 saw
the Upper Tarble party as "capstone for
what people have done to get out the vote."
Upper Tarble was filled with students
and professors who came and left throughout the night to eat free pizza and watch

Students, along with some members of the faculty and administration, packed Upper Tarble Tuesday night to watch election returns
at a gathering sponsored by the Swarthmore Voter Registration Coalition.
the returns.
Many Swarthmore students had participated in various election-related activities over the course of the day Tuesday
including canvassing for different organizations (see "Young voters help push
Kerry over the edge," pg. 5) and watching
polls (see "Students defend voters' rights,"
pg- 4).
"People have really dispelled a lot of
views of apathy and low voter participation," Ucker said.
Reeves pointed to turnout statistics in
areas around Swarthmore as anecdotal
evidence for the power of younger voters
in this election. "If you look at
Pennsylvania, students definitely helped
deliver the state for Kerry," he said.
"While some of the national pundits may
be trashing the youth vote, I think that's
an unfair indictment."
Sikendra Christian 'O6, who worked
with SVRC to get out the vote, also noted
the results in Pennsylvania. "It's great we
won Pennsylvania. It's so cool how
involved people are on campus," she said.
Perhaps because so many students had
participated in get-out-the-vote efforts,

cheers went up whenever a Pennsylvania
race showed up on the TV screen and the
crowd roared when, just before 11 p.m., NBC

umn before these reports emerged. As of
press time, no networks had called lowa
or New Mexico, and the results from these

called the state of Pennsylvania for Kerry.
Despite the overall victory for Bush,
Eric Cooperman 'O7, who supported Kerry,
found solace in the active participation of
Swarthmore students in support of Kerry.
"We
we could on our
end. There isn't any more Swatties
could've done and that's comforting," he

said.

Throughout the

night,

the

crowd

cheered whenever a positive statistic for
Kerry appeared on the screen or when a
commentator had something positive to
say for Kerry supporters. Boos and catcalls greeted Republican pundits who
shared their opinions with Brokaw, NBC's
longtime news anchor who is planning on
retiring next month.
Once NBC called Ohio for Bush, the
station was changed in seeming desperation to ABC, which refused to call Ohio
until late Wednesday morning after
reports that Kerry had called Bush to concede the election. Fox and NBC were the
only network to put Ohio in Bush's col-

November

2004

later in the week.

Cooperman noted the miniscule pres-

ence of Bush supporters at the party. "I
know there are more conservatives on
this campus, but I guess they were celebrating elsewhere," he said.
Peters also noticed the decidedly onesided atmosphere at Upper Tarble. "I felt

kind of annoyed that there was a lot of
partisanship,"

he said. "But this is
Swarthmore, and this kind of thing is
treated like a sporting event."
Expanding on this analogy, Peters, a
diehard Boston Red Sox fan, recognized
the disappointment Kerry supporters are
feeling. "All I could think of is if the Red
Sox had lost [the World Series] this is how
I would feel," he said, describing the
atmosphere on campus as being as if

"someone's mother had died."
The Social Affairs Committee, the Lang
Foundation and the President's Office all
gave funding for the event in Upper
Tarble.

Students defend voters' rights
SVRC coordinates poll-watching endeavors in Swarthmore, Chester and Upper Darby
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore students took watch at polls across the
area on Tuesday to ensure that those registered to vote
could do so.
The Swarthmore Voter Registration Coalition led ini-

tiatives both in the immediate Swarthmore area, at the
polling places designated for Swarthmore students, and at
various polling places in Chester and Upper Darby, according to SVRC co-founder and co-chair Ethan Ucker 'O7.
Ucker spent the day as a poll watcher for Swarthmore's Northern Precinct at Swarthmore-Rutledge
School. Six out of every seven of the approximately 750
Swarthmore students who registered to vote in
Pennsylvania were assigned this polling place, since it
was the designated polling place for all students living on
campus except those in PPR or Mary Lyon.

"Over 90 percent of the Swarthmore
students registered to vote In
Pennsylvania were able to vote.
The turnout was unprecedented."
Aaron Strong 'O6, SVRC member
Ucker's task was to provide information and assist
Swarthmore students who were having voting difficulties, like misspelled names on their registration documents or issues because of different dorms belonging to

different voting districts.

According to Ucker, most of these difficulties were
cleared up by presenting election officials with proof of
corrected registration information.
"For the most part, we had caught all the problems with

students' registration status beforehand," he said. "We

could present a document, like a fax from the Delaware
County Elections Bureau, stating that the voter's registration information had been officially corrected."
Throughout the day, over 30 Swarthmore students

worked three-hour shifts as poll watchers at the polls at
Swarthmore-Rutledge School and the Cerebral Palsy
Center on Rutgers Avenue, Ucker said.
Their work was proved worthwhile by the number of
Swarthmore students who successfully voted. "Over 90
percent of the Swarthmore students registered to vote in

Pennsylvania were able to vote. The turnout was
unprecedented," SVRC member Aaron Strong 'O6 said.

"We were worried that they
would face problems, so we
were there to help, as well as
lawyers, who were either on
site or available by phone."
Joella Fink 'O7, poll watcher
Although the student volunteers could not enter the
polls themselves because they were not officially certified as poll watchers by the Delaware County Board of
Elections, Ucker was in close contact with lawyer Rick
Stabinsky, who was certified and spent part of the day at
the polling place at Swarthmore's Northern District to
help with any problems.
Volunteers at Swarthmore's polling places were also
able to assist others by giving them information about
what identification they needed once they entered the
polling place as well as how to obtain a provisional ballot
if their registration information was incorrect.
This help was much appreciated by the community,
according to Strong. "Many people were very thankful to
us," he said. "Around lunchtime, some people spontaneously gave us food."

Martha Hoffman 'O7 and Sam Bell 'O5 worked with
SVRC and Delaware County Wage Peace and Justice to
organize poll watchers at 21 different precincts in

Chester and Upper Darby. Hoffman said they coordinated about 80 people, most of whom were students, to be
poll watchers.

The problems experienced by voters "varied quite a
bit" from precinct to precinct, according to Hoffman.
"Some [poll watchers] had no problems, but some people
had five or six incidents when voters had to use provisional ballots," she said.
Groups of volunteering students also went in to
Chester and Upper Darby to similarly assist voters there
and provide transportation to the polls. Joella Fink 'O7
spent most of the day at the Christopher Columbus
Elementary School in Chester, assisting many of those
whom SVRC had registered to vote earlier this fall.
"There's a rush of newly registered voters in that
area," Fink said. "We were worried that they would face
problems, so we were there to help, as well as lawyers,
who were either on site or available by phone."
The voter turnout the poll watchers saw in these
areas was impressive. Stefanie Wong 'O7, who was a volunteer poll watcher in Chester, said the polling place at
which she worked had already surpassed the total number of votes it had received in 2000 by 10 a.m. on Tuesday.
"I was really happy with the turnout," Fink said.
Arthur Chalmers 'O5, who also volunteered as a poll
watcher in Chester, said the assistance of poll watchers
was important in increasing this turnout. "A lot of people
got to vote who probably wouldn't have gotten to vote
otherwise," he said.
According to Chalmers, those voters who were challenged at the polling place at which he was stationed
were "young, black women."
Volunteers helping in the Swarthmore area provided
transportation to and from the polls using college vans
and their own cars.

Tuesday when approximately 45

students congregated in Parrish

Colin Holtz-Eakin 'O7, executive director of the Young

"This makes me feel overjoyed,"
he said.

Students whose work focused
on non-student voters in the surrounding communities were equally impressed with voter turnout on
Tuesday. Jared Thompson 'O5, who
has worked for MoveOn for several weeks, said that as of 7:30 p.m.
on Tuesday night, only 150 of the
1850
voters
registered
in
Swarthmore's Northern Precinct
had not voted. "There was a really

high turnout, which is exactly
what we were aiming for," he said.
"Everyone

seemed focused

and aware of voting," said Celia
Paris 'O5. "It was really impres-

sive to see that."
For voters who were not politically aware, student canvassers
may have had an effect. Jonathan
Petkun 'O7, who worked for PA
Victory 'O4,
described one
encounter at 7 p.m., an hour
before the polls closed. "We
knocked on someone's door, and
he was so thankful that we found

him because he forgot about the
election," he said.
During his work for PA Victory
'O4, Petkun canvassed and hung
door hangers to remind likely
Democratic voters to vote. Despite
what he saw as a "sad day in this
country" following the news of
George Bush's victory, he looked to
continue the organizing efforts of
Democrat-oriented groups of this
election into future elections.
"Hopefully we can unite again,
whether it be in 2006 or 2008," he
said.

Nick Forrest 'OB worked as a
canvasser for the College Young

but was skeptical about his personal contribution to the result of
the election.
"Seeing as everyone we talked
to had voted, I'm not sure how
much of a difference I personally
made, but I think in Pennsylvania
all the canvassing did help it go
blue," he said, referring to the
color used on electoral college
maps to represent a state that
voted for John Kerry. "Most of the
people were very happy that we
were reminding them [to vote]."
According to Strong and
Thompson, the Cerebral Palsy
Center polling place on Rutgers
Avenue, where they had spent sig-

nificant parts of their day, had
long lines of students in the morning and was crowded throughout
the afternoon.
Student voting and voter-registration efforts paid off early

Tuesday night as Pennsylvania
precincts began reporting their
results, indicating that Kerry had
handily won Philadelphia, as well

as its traditionally-conservative

suburbs.
Paris split her day's efforts
between the Democratic Party's
office in Media and get-out-thevote efforts with ACT. On seeing
the state's early returns in Kerry's
favor, she said, "I really think the
youth vote will have swung this

election like never before. It's real-

ly mobilized in favor of one candi-

date, and the turnout is amazing."
Yet while younger voters in
Pennsylvania may have affected
the outcome, nationwide, those 18
to 29 years old voted in the same
proportion as 2000, a preliminary
MSNBC poU indicated.
Registrar Martin Warner

praised the student body's efforts
in registering and mobilizing voters through this fall's campaign

season. "SVRC has been absolutely heroic: champions, heroes,

superstars," he said. "I've been
awed, amazed and impressed of
their effort every step of the way.
I knew they'd been talking about
it for a while, and they went out
and did it."

Political discussion hits
close to home in Chester
BY IVAN BOOTHE

iboothel@swarthmore.edu
The voting site was in the back of a church, but
one might be forgiven in mistaking it for a storage
shed. The main entrance was half-way down an
unmarked alley, and the windowless, cinderblock
building offered no clues about its function. There
was one sign marked "vote" a block away, though
the upper half had deteriorated, and there was no
arrow indicating where the polling place actually
was. The first encounter I often had with voters
was waving my arms in order to direct them to the

building.
On Tuesday, I volunteered with Delaware
County Wage Peace and Justice to be a "poll
watcher" in Chester, ensuring that voters who
were challenged on their rights were not disenfranchised. While legal representatives from both
the Democratic and Republican parties were present, in my precinct I was the only officially nonpartisan voter advocate.

Campaign Postcard
The polling site was just down the block from
the former Lamokin station in Chester, closed by
SEPTA last year because of low "daily boarding
activity." Now, said a volunteer at the polls who
went only by "Sparky," many people had found
jobs closer to home, since "no one's going to walk
to the other side of town to get a train every day."
Economic issues seemed to be one of the primary
forces behind the large voter turnout and overwhelming support of Kerry.
Two years ago I volunteered for a congressional candidate in a precinct in Lower Merion, a
wealthy but traditionally left-leaning suburb in
Montgomery County. Both Republican and
Democratic representatives were present at the
polling site, an elementary school, and members
of both parties' state campaigns stopped by sever-

al times to pick up vote tallies.
Needless to say, neither party seemed to find it
necessary to check on for whom these voters were
casting their presidential ballots. There were no
Bush/Cheney signs at the polling place, and while
there was a representative from the local
Republican Committee, she sat directly behind a
Kerry/Edwards sign as she handed out the

Republican ticket.

Chester residents were not, however, blind followers of the Democratic Party. Sparky, for example, was handing out literature endorsing the
"union vote."
The union vote appeared to be a straight
Democratic ticket for the presidential and statewide offices, but Republican candidates for local

representation in the Pennsylvania legislature.
Many

Chester residents may have followed this

split-ticket guide; as the Republican state senator,
Dominic F. Pileggi, was handily re-elected. When
one voter told Sparky that she was "pulling the
lever for the Democrats," he told her goodnaturedly, "Pulling a lever? I don't even want to
talk to you."
I had worried before going in about appearing
to be a disconnected student from the rich college
up 320, or about voters in Chester seeing me as
someone who was trying to "save" them from election laws that were too complicated for them to
understand. But the voters in Chester knew what
they were doing.
When I offered the information sheet to one
voter, he said, "I'm not even worried about that,
brother. I'm too big for that shit."
Most often I simply acted to convey information to the voter rights hotline. In one case, for
instance, we received a report from an employee
of a nursing home that was being used as a polling

6

site. The worker said her boss had been charging
employees $25 "in order to vote." Through the hotline run by Delco Wage Peace, we were able to
secure a lawyer to visit the site and investigate the
claim.
It might be easy to believe that political discourse occurs only among those who watch cable
news or follow political blogs online. But over the
course of the eight hours I spent at the Chester
polls, I witnessed intricate discussions about the
state of the electorate in Ohio and Florida and the
lack of trust in voting technology and predictions
of who would run in 2008 (their guesses: Jeb Bush

and Hillary Rodham

Clinton).

The residents of Chester knew that their communities were taken for granted by the presidential campaigns.
When the subject turned to AIDS, Sparky said
flatly, "Rich people can afford the cure but poor
people can't. There are cheaper drugs, but the
Food and Drug Administration won't let it happen." They were voting for Kerry, but they were
less than optimistic that much would change in
their city.
The scene was understandably different in
Chester than in Swarthmore, where the line to
vote was more than an hour long by 9:30 a.m. In
Chester, there was rarely a line to vote, and many
residents who drove simply double-parked their
cars in the street until they were finished. The
unmarked door to the polling place was located
behind a dumpster, and the only registration rolls
were under the control of the elections officials.
From noon until 4 p.m. I was the only person
handing out information on what a person could
do if their vote was challenged.
Thaddeus, a resident who declined to give his
last name, was nonetheless confident about being

able to vote.

"They'd better not challenge me after 50 years,"
he said to me. "If they do, I know what I'm going
to do to the guy who stole it last time."
Mid-way through the afternoon, though, one
woman's vote was challenged. She had recently
returned to living in the precinct after having
been gone for four years. She had dutifully re-registered and received a new card in the mail. Yet
the elections officials had said she was not on the
rolls and thus could not vote.
Our guidelines said that the poll employees
were supposed to automatically call the county
voter registration office in Media if a voter was
not in their records.
"Did they call Media?" I asked the woman.
"No," she said.
"Did they offer you a provisional ballot?"
"They did no such thing."
A new federal law mandated that all voters,
regardless of whether they were on the rolls or
had identification, were to be allowed to vote on a
provisional ballot that would be evaluated after
the election.
There were two Democratic Party lawyers
nearby, and because they were allowed to enter
the polling place, I directed the voter to them.
After about 15 minutes of cajoling the elections
officials, one of the lawyers came out of the building.

"We just made it happen!" she said and gave me
a high-five.
The Democratic Party's win in Pennsylvania

was a testament to their ability to knit together
the disparate communities of wealthy liberals in
Lower

Merion,

young

college

students

in

Swarthmore and working-class residents of cities
like Chester. And like in Swarthmore, the Chester
precinct saw unprecedented levels of involvement
this year. But it was clear voters in this last group
were not satisfied with electoral organizing alone.
"Ain't no elected politician ever going to do
anything for you
you've got to get out there and
do it yourself," Sparky said. "You wait on the
politicians, nothing will ever happen."

With the pull of a lever, Swatties cast their vote
Hundreds of students flocked to the polls on Nov. 2,
casting their vote with the turn of a lever.
At the Swarthmore-Rutledge School and the Cerebral
Palsy Center, two Swarthmore polling places, old-fashioned mechanical voting machines were used.
Republican volunteer Gene Hamill said she used the

same mechanical machines when she first voted 30
years ago.
"A lot of citizens are very used to [the old voting
machines]. It would be a challenge to make them comfortable with new machines," Laurence Smith, a volunteer at the Swarthmore-Rutledge School polling place,
said.
Volunteers were on hand to instruct voters on how to
use the machines, and a miniature version of the
machine was located at the sign-in desk for demonstration purposes.
Students did not experience much difficulty in using
the machines after the demonstration. J.B. Donnelly 'OB
found the mechanical voting machines "well explained
and straightforward" to use. But, he added, "without the
demonstration [by volunteers], I would really have no
idea [how to use the machines]."
Lever machines, though old-fashioned, are still comparatively preferable to the electronic voting machines
popularized by the Help America Vote Act of 2002,
according to Nelson Pavlosky 'O6, head of the
Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons. Unlike
electronic touch-screen voting machines, lever voting systems are designed to leave paper trails, which makes a
recount possible.
The Help America Vote Act "provided funds to states
to replace punch voting systems" in addition to increasing voter training and education, according to the Federal
Elections Commission Web site. "[The Act] provided funding for counties to buy new machines, to supposedly
avoid last election's Florida recount," Pavlosky said,
adding that this process was rushed without implementing government standards.
Pavlosky and Luke Smith 'O6, another SCDC member,
sued Diebold, a developer of electronic voting machines,
in October 2003 for the right to post memos from the
company that suggested defaults in their machines
online. The company claimed the memos were protected
under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, and therefore
could not be posted without explicit permission of the
company. The students won their case against Diebold in

October 2004.
Pavlosky said he hopes for the popularization of optical scanning machines that would read votes on a
scanned ballot, much like the answer sheets used for
standardized tests.

Students arrested, hospitalized following ML party
BY JULIE BAKER

jbakerl@swarthmore.edu

A total of four incidents involving the
Swarthmore police were reported at the
Mary Lyon Halloween party on Saturday,
with calls initially coming in about two
hours after the party began.
Two students were taken in by police
and charged with drug and alcohol-related
offenses, according to Director of Public
Safety Owen Redgrave.
"At about midnight [Public Safety was]
called to Yale and Harvard Avenues by the
Swarthmore police," Redgrave said.
"When we arrived, we were told that a student was stopped for urinating on the
street. Initially, they were going to release
the student to us, but then marijuana was
found on the student's person, so they
decided to keep him."
Redgrave added that at 1:16 a.m., another student was stopped along Harvard
Avenue.
"Our officer went to the Swarthmore
police station and was told that a
Swarthmore College student was seen
walking in the middle of Harvard Avenue
toward Strath Haven [Avenue], staggering
and appearing intoxicated. He was given a

breathalyzer test and failed," he said.
Two subsequent incidents involved students who possibly needed hospitalization
for alcohol poisoning.
"We transported a student from Mary
Lyon to Worth Health Center for evaluation. Instead of going to the health center,

the student tried stumbling away. An
ambulance had been requested, so
Swarthmore police arrived. The student
was disorderly with the police and was
cited for disorderly conduct, public drunkenness and underage drinking," Redgrave
said.
The second incident also involved medical personnel.
"At 1:30 a.m. a request for an escort
from Mary Lyon to the health center came
in. Before we transport [a student], we
make a decision of whether it's appropriate to do so," Redgrave said.
"When our officer arrived, it was our
officer's opinion that the student needed
medical attention. The student appeared
very intoxicated to the point where [the
officer] didn't feel comfortable transporting her. By procedure, when the ambulance was called, the Swarthmore Police
Department was called and arrived with
the ambulance," Redgrave added.
Both students were taken to the Taylor

Hospital.
Linda Echols, director of the Worth
Health Center, did not see the students
until they returned from the hospital the
following morning. "[The students] went to
the hospital, then came back [to Worth]
They just needed supportive stuff. They
were pretty much alert and just needed to
sleep it off," she said.
Echols explained that it is up to the
nurses' discretion whether students can be
treated at Worth for intoxication or need to
be transferred to the hospital.
...

"Generally, if they can stagger down the
hall, we'll keep them. If they're so out of it
that they can't get up and walk, then the
nurses office sends them for an evaluation.
In the event that we do keep them, we
watch them all night and make sure that
they don't aspirate and are alert enough
that they can be aroused without much of
an effort. If they can't wake up, then they
need serious attention," she said.

"What was very unfortunate about the evening
was how uncomfortable all
the students were made to
feel by the situation."
Registrar Martin Warner

ing else I could do," he said.
Warner's concern was also for the partygoers who witnessed the incidents on
Saturday night.
"What was very unfortunate about the
evening was how uncomfortable all the
students were made to feel by the situation. Some were obviously intoxicated,
most were dressed oddly, and everyone felt
vulnerable," he said.
Still, Warner felt that the evening had
an important lesson for students.
"[The incident] was unfortunate from a
social standpoint, but it's not necessarily
wrong that the police gave everybody a
scare, either. I don't mind Swarthmore students' being confronted with the realities
of living in American society, and part of
that is that you have to be responsible for
your actions," he said.
Despite the police involvement, Warner
feels that the ML Halloween Party is still

an important Swarthmore tradition.

Martin Warner, the "dean on duty" that
evening, said he was called several times
between 12:30 a.m. and 2 a.m. regarding the

incidents.
He said he chose to defer meeting with

the students involved until he could confer
with his fellow deans-on-call.
"My primary responsibility was for the
safety of the students, both those who were
in trouble and those who might have been
involved in a secondary way. When I was
sure that all that was necessary for their
safety was accomplished, there was noth-

"I think [the party] accomplishes a lot
of good things about ML's being part of the
Swarthmore community," he said.
"There are some challenges that need to
be looked at by the ML RAs, like how to get
the students back to their dorms safely and
conveniently at the end of the party. I hope
that solutions can be worked out that are
easy. But to say this is an ML problem is
not fair; I think it could happen in a variety of settings," Warner said.
The Swarthmore Police Department
could not be reached for comment at the
time of publication.

Feeling hungry? Dining Services weighs in on schedules
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY NICOLE KAST

nkastl@swarthmore.edu

The meal credit schedules at
Sharpies and Essie Mae's are often

a subject of discussion and confusion among hungry diners.

Currently, Essie Mae's accepts

meal credit on weekdays between
8 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. for breakfast,
1 p.m. to 4 p.m. for lunch, and 7

p.m. to 9:30 p.m. for dinner, as well
as between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
for dinner on weekends. Sharpies
accepts meal credit from 7:30 a.m.
to 7:15 p.m. on the weekdays and
from 7:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. during

weekends.
According to Manager Scott
Tutton, regulating the flow of traffic at Essie Mae's was one of the
considerations that went into
devising the meal credit schedule
because most of the faculty and
staff eat at around the same time
as students. The administration
wanted to give faculty and staff a
specific period of time in which to
eat without having to wait in long
lines.
Tutton also said the Quakerinspired tradition of students eating meals together was part of the
reason for the schedule. "That's
why there's only one dining hall,"
Tutton said. "The meal equivalen-

m

cy at Essie Mae's was never
intended to replace Sharpies."
Some students feel that Essie
Mae's should accept meal credit
all day. "I think it's bad and
annoying because if you want just
a sandwich from Tarble, you have
to wait until 1 p.m.," Johanna
Braff 'O5 said. Braff added that she
wished both Tarble and Sharpies
were open longer.
The restricted schedule at

Essie Mae's is particularly tight
for students who finish their
morning classes on Tuesdays and
Thursdays at 12:35 p.m. and have
another class at 1:15 p.m. Haley
Loram 'OB said she was frustrated
at having to choose between
sprinting to Sharpies or waiting
until 1 p.m. to get something at
Essie Mae's.
"It would be convenient if
Essie Mae's would let you use
your meal card 15 minutes earlier," Loram said.
A remedy to this problem is the
option of bag lunches, which are
available at Tarble every weekday
during lunch hours, Director of
Dining Services Linda McDougall
said in an e-mail. "The main motivation [for the bag lunches] was
class schedule, but we were also
motivated because of the long
lines in Sharpies at certain times

during lunch and lack of seating,"
McDougall said.

Christine Duranza 'OB agreed.
"I think [bag lunches] are really
convenient because I can just pick
one up and go and take it to class,"
she said. Duranza added that she
was pleased with the variety of
bag lunches available.
Staff at both Sharpies and
Essie Mae's agree that the current schedule is for the best.
Elaine Hayman, a Sharpies staff
member, said having two food
venues open at different times
gives students the much-needed
option of picking up food at all
times of the day. "Just in case
we're closed, they can go up [to
Tarble]," she said.
Valerie Morse, an Essie Mae's
staff member, agreed by saying
that the different schedules are
necessary for maintaining order
at the snack bar. "If everybody
came at the same time, there
would not be enough room to hold
them," she said.
Over the past few years the
Dining Services schedules have
changed many times, Tutton said,
and the current schedule is being
kept because it appears to best suit
the needs of the school.
Sharpies instituted its "open
door" policy of accepting meal cred-

it all day in March 2000. McDougall
spearheaded this policy. The hours
for Essie Mae's snack bar were

fixed when staff found that students generally did not come to buy

of either Essie Mae's or Sharpies
in the near future.

Student identity theft grows nationwide
BY MICHELLE KESSEL
U-WIRE (DC BUREAU)
(U-WIRE)
Kari Hirsh, a junior at the
George Washington University from Great

Neck, N.Y., said she has now learned to
rip up her shopping receipts.
Recently, Hirsh received a phone call

from her bank about charges on a credit
card totaling nearly $BOO. But Hirsh said
she did not make these charges, nor was
her actual credit card stolen.
"I really have no idea what happened,"
she said. "I just got a call from a bank one
day and found out that someone stole my
identity and used it to apply for a credit

card and then charged things under

my

name."
Hirsh wrote a letter to the credit card
fraud department and was not held
accountable for the purchases made under
her name.
"I've heard about these things, but I
never thought it could actually happen to
me," she said.
Identity theft, according to the Office of
Inspector General, occurs when someone
uses someone else's personal identifying
information without any knowledge or
permission. The information can be used
to obtain credit cards, wireless phones
and services, loans and mortgages, jobs
and to commit fraudulent and criminal
acts leaving the naive victim responsible.
Analysts say the growth of the Internet
and digital finance, expanding consumer

credit worldwide, varying law enforcement on the local and federal levels and
the changing regulations governing the
credit industry are factors which have
helped identity theft become an easier
crime to commit.
In 1998, Congress made identity theft a
federal crime, prompting the Federal
Trade Commission to set up a victim assistance center one year later.
According to a recent survey by the
Federal Trade Commission, more than 10
million Americans, including 500,000
young adults, were victims of identity
theft compared to half a million in 2002.
Experts said they think the increase in the
amount of identity theft victims will con-

tinue.

From 2002 to 2003, crime rates for identity theft and fraud targeting college students increased more than 80 percent than
that of the general population. Nearly 90
percent of identity theft and fraud cases at
universities occur unbeknownst to the
victim for several months or years in

some cases.

College students are easy targets for
identity theft according to the Identity
Theft Resource Center, a non-profit group
which helps victims, consumers, legisla-

tors, the media and law enforcement offi-

cials understand the crime and communicate about it.
The ITRC said students may not monitor their credit card bills closely to verify
expenses and purchases, which can allow

the criminals to go undetected for a long
time.
In addition to credit card bills, college
students are concerned about thieves getting a hold of social security numbers.
Many use their social security numbers
on their drivers' licenses. Almost half of
all college students have had grades posted by social security numbers, according
to the Office of Inspector General.

Admissions files are often organized by
social security numbers as well.
"It's a lot easier to match all of the different parts of an application file to a number rather than a name, especially more
generic ones," Victoria Millet, a first-year
admissions counselor at University of
Houston, said.
"We don't force people to supply their
social security numbers but it makes the
matching process easier for everybody,"

she said.
Millet said that while most students
provide their social security numbers
willingly, others are more hesitant in fear
of identity theft.

While University of Houston has never
had a problem with identity theft, Millet
said they shred all papers as a precaution
to thwart possible thefts.
Michael Oster, a high school senior in
Brookline, Mass., said he is concerned
about identity theft, especially now that
he is applying to colleges.
"At first, I felt reservations about giving out my social security number to the

want to become a doctor."

College Board and various colleges," Oster
said. "However, what scares me more than
identity theft is a college mixing up my
application because I did not give enough
identifying information. I guess if I'm
going to trust a college with my education,
I should be able to trust it with my social
security number."
Oster also said that he elected to have a
randomly generated number on his driver's license instead of his social security
number.
Tom Lekan, head of security for
KeyCorp, one of the nation's largest bankbased financial services, says in a company press release that buying a paper
shredder, to shred financial information,
and unsolicited credit card offers, which
bombard students, is one way they can
protect themselves.
Additionally, Lekan recommends students take extra caution in not leaving
checkbooks, credit cards or mail lying
around dorms or shared living spaces and
making sure to carefully read over all
credit card and bank statements. Students
should only order merchandise online
through secure Web sites and make sure
that they install and update virus protection programs on personal computers.
Lekan also said students should make
two copies of personal information cards
that may contain social security numbers,
like student ID's, drivers' licenses and
health insurance cards, and leaving one at
home and bringing the other to school.

The Prodigal Prodigy
Luckily, I knew some folk
who could help me out: Th
Swarthmore College Democrat
are masterful political advocate
and expert activism connoisseurs. And with the election approaching
they craved volunteers like sleep-deprived Swatties crave caffeine. A]
I needed was to hang with them, and all sorts of activist doors would
open for me. Perhaps I'd even find myself a club.
When I arrived, the Democrats were abuzz with election talk
Congressional candidate Paul Scoles was the meeting's main attrac
tion, and he spoke forcefully to his crowd of devotees. It was an excit
ing speech, but for me, the real intrigue came later. That was when
College Democrats president Eva Barboni 'O6 discussed plans for th
coming week. The Democrats had much to do: visibility (standing on
street corners with Kerry/Edwards signs), phone banking, canvassing
and more. Some members had particularly radical campaign ideas.
"I've already come to the conclusion I'd sleep with John Kerry if i
would get him elected," one Democrat said.
Another offered a more practical idea: "[Let's] ask Nader support
ers to raise their hands in Sharpies and then beat them with lunch

B

trays."

Less work-oriented events were discussed too. One member sug
a post-election party, since "either way, you're going to want to
drink afterwards." It was a lively and enthusiastic planning session in
all. Still, I was uncertain about what I wanted to do. Phone banking
and canvassing felt awkward; I hate imposing on people's lives
Visibility was less intrusive but brought with it the risk of "verba
abuse" and protesters with giant aborted-baby placards. I could wallop
Naderites, but as one wise Dem pointed out, he wasn't even on PA bai
lots! Leaving the meeting, there seemed to be no right answer.
Thankfully, fate obliged me. Dropped into my sluggish Swatmai
Friday night was the perfect call to arms. "Howard Dean visiting
Swarthmore! Volunteers needed!" How awesome was this? Holding
gested

posters wasn't my thing, but hobnobbing with bigwig governors? Tha
was right up my alley. I eagerly volunteered.
A meeting the following Wednesday assigned us jobs for the Dean
event. Sadly, "personal assistant to visiting dignitary" was nowher
on the list. I reluctantly took a role at the check-in table instead. I was
n't meeting celebrities, I wasn't changing the world, and I wasn'
spreading democracy, but I wasn't standing out in the cold directin
people, either
the latecomers got that job. Sometimes in advocacy
you need to take these small victories.
I woke up early the day of the rally and took my seat at the big
check-in table. My job was simple: Cross names off a big master lis
and hand out generic blue tickets. I was totally, supremely excellent a
it. Cross with the left hand, ticket with the right hand, thank you

enjoy, next.

There were a couple of trying moments. People showed up whose
names weren't on the list, but I stayed cool under pressure. Nothing
with the left hand, ticket with the right hand, thank you, enjoy, next
An abundance of extra tickets allowed us to distribute one to every
comer, regardless of whether they'd reserved tickets or not! I felt alter
nately benevolent and useless as I indiscriminately doled out tickets to
the listed and unlisted alike.
An hour of that, and my work was done. Still, I felt unfulfilled. I
seemed to me an activism catch-22. Hand out tickets, I feel useless; do
something important like phone bank, I'd feel uncomfortable. It's too
bad. I love the Dems, I love their enthusiasm, and I love their cause,
wish I could've done more to help them. I guess I'm just a born pas
sivist. Unless big-shot celebrities are present, of course.

Students in Mephistos react to Tuesday night's election returns.

Where did you watch?
BY ALYSSA WORK
aworkl@swarthmore.edu
"Scrubs" was on. So was the opening night of
the NBA. But for the hundreds of Swarthmore students crowded Tuesday night around big screens,
small screens and computer screens alike, there
was no broadcast that mattered more than the
national election returns. For a student who wanted to catch live coverage of Decision 2004, there was
from low-key lounging to
a plethora of options
riotous excitement, CNN to the Daily Show, pizza to
celery sticks.
Upper Tarble, transformed into a giant screening area by the SVRC, hosted 300 to 400 students
sprawled on blankets and pillows and seated in over
200 provided chairs. The crowd ate pizza and
watched election results live from "Democracy
Plaza" on MSNBC. Pennsylvania's Kerry victory
brought on spontaneous cheers, as did Barack
Obama's victory in Illinois and the news of
increased young voter turnout this year.
Aaron Strong 'O6, a key SVRC organizer, said
that student turnout had been "amazing" throughout the months leading up to the election and that
after the success of the Parrish Beach broadcast of
the first debate, it was "only logical for the entire
campus to get together on election night."
"The student body has worked so hard, and
we're coming together to see the results of that hard
work," Anna Belc 'O7 said. "Coming here to be with
everyone, to cheering with everyone when Kerry
wins a swing state, booing when Bush wins one
our reward for the work we've done is to eat that
pizza that Ethan [Ucker 'o6] is carrying around."
...

More students crowded into the hall as the night
wore on, filling the seats as well as the front and
back of the hall. "I was here four years ago," Ivan
Boothe 'O5 said, "and we did something similar, but
there wasn't nearly as much student involvement.
It feels like a community this year."
For students who wanted a somewhat quieter
atmosphere
while
watching returns,
the
Intercultural Center was tunedto Aaron Brown and
CNN from 8 p.m. on. A group of about 12 students,
many with books in the early evening, gathered
around grapes, cheese and sticks of celery.
"We wanted to open up the IC and invite the
entire campus to come and relax," IC intern Nicola
Wells 'O5 said.
Another campus group that opened up house

November 4, 2004

Tuesday night was the Women's Resource Center,
serving Sharpies cake and ABC election results to a
small crowd of women (and two men) in the upper

room of the WRC.

The center "wanted to bring people into the WRC
space, to establish it as a place for discussion," WRC
intern Sonali Shai 'O6 said.
The SVRC showing, Shai said, was "too big for
people to interact beyond people they know, and
within the dorms it's just your friends. ... Here we
can interact with other people."
Inside Mephistos lounge in Willets, a rowdier
atmosphere reigned. About 40 people gathered to
talk back at television commentators and growl at a
smug-looking President Bush, throwing out an
occasional "fuck you, Jeb Bush."
Steve St. Vincent 'O7 set up a map of each state
and its red/blue status, as well as a whiteboard
recording electoral votes, saying he had been
"keeping track of polls since June."
At 10 p.m. Mephistos coverage switched from
NBC to Jon Stewart and the Daily Show's "Prelude
to a Recount." Several students in the front row
took their obligatory shots of vodka and Sprite for a
Bush victory in Utah. "We were going to drink
every time Bush won a state," they said, "but we

missed a bunch."

"Willets is always more exciting," said Patrice

Berry 'O6, who lives in the dorm. "It was more exciting for the Red Sox game
for everything. People
are rowdy here; the energy's high."
Energy was high down in Mertz as well, where

between two of the night's major events: the election returns and the Detroit Pistons/ Houston
Rockets basketball game.
"We're here because of this TV," Matt Kurmin
'OB said. "The split screen is a great feature. Of
course our main interest is the election
but it's
the opening night of the NBA too."
Around 9:30 p.m., eight pizzas arrived at the

But whether it was the promise of free pizza or a
genuine stake in the future of the country, few students could ignore the cheers and tears all over
campus as the night went on.
"The more this election drags on," Strong said,
"the more people will want to share in this monumental historical event."

'Stage Beauty': Curiously pure film magic
BY ALYSSA WORK
aworkl@swarthmore.edu

In light of the numerous contradictions
in "Stage Beauty," the film has absolutely no
business being as good as it is. The script
teems with a cleverness that often digresses
into the nonsensical; the themes are interesting, but shallow; the acting is personally
dynamic, yet universally monotonous. Since
"Stage Beauty" is the story of a man whose
life is playing women, these contradictions
are in line with the central ridiculousness,
eroticism and poignancy of the film's subject. Overall, the audience is presented with
a movie whose plot isn't its downfall, but its
saving grace. No matter how erratic the rest
of the film, the story of "Stage Beauty" is so
interesting that movie-goers remain mentally involved from start to finish.
Set in 1660, "Stage Beauty" explores the
transformation of English theatre from an
exclusively male art to an integrated forum.
The film focuses primarily on Ned Kynaston
(Billy Crudup), the most beautiful "woman"
on the London stage, whose personal assistant, Maria (Claire Danes), cruelly usurps
his star status when her acting prowess
catches the eye of King Charles II (the
always wonderfully laconic Rupert Everett).
As Kynaston, Crudup expertly carries
effeminate characteristics into Kynaston's
offstage persona, acknowledging with his
graceful gestures and melodious pitch
Kynaston's gender-confusion. "You are a
man in a woman's form," Kynaston remembers being told by his instructor, then wonders, "Or is it the other way around?"
Taking their cues from Crudup, the rest of
the male ensemble give foppish, keyed-down

it's a wonder some

people aren't airborne. One thing leads to
another (and another and another and
another; writer Jeffrey Hatcher's intention
is to pummel you with plot developments
rather than actually fully develop the plot),
and soon the King decrees that only women
may play women onstage.
Hatcher's writing is most spot-on when
he sets his scenes during the company's per-

formances, rehearsals and auditions. He
proves that he has a witty insight into the
tenuous balance between the theater's contempt for its patrons and its reliance on
them. Some of the film's most inspired
moments address this love-hate relationship, particularly when the aristocrat complains after a performance of "Othello,"
"Could you make it cheerier?"
Throughout the movie, interesting
themes are dropped in, banished and then
whizzed back so quickly that audiences
should prepare themselves for serious mental whiplash. The elements of theatre are
delicately explored by the plot, though the
elements of human nature are explored to a
lesser extent. Hatcher recognizes the difference in the way a man must play a woman
and the way a woman must portray herself
if the former. Since Maria is therefore imitating Kynaston imitating females, she
defies cinematic cliche, lends depth to the
plot, and maintains this reviewer's interest
by being a terrible actress.

"Stage Beauty" would benefit from
trading some of its aristocratic blase for a
little more variety. Doing so would have
allowed it to delve deeper into more profound issues, instead of settling for a fun
and fast-paced but ultimately superficially developed story.

Contests created for campus spirit
BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
bmonkpal@swarthmore.edu
Forget those dreams of having a spot on "Who Wants
to be a Millionaire?" and living vicariously through Ken
Jennings on "Jeopardy." Swarthmore is creating its own
game shows through fun contests from Essie Mae's and
the Swarthmore College Weekly News. As cheesy as
these contests may be, they bring an interactive play to
the campus' mainstays that will surely add a bit of fun to
your day.
On Sept. 16, the Weekly News voiced its annoyance
with spam by creating a contest that disparages this
Internet nuisance. Aptly titled "Where's the SPAM?" the
contest consists of finding the special "Anti-SPAM" logo
an image of the infamous mystery meat in an undis-

closed section of the online newspaper.

For students who just don't want to
try, the "Student of the Week" contest randomly doles out awards to
students who are standing in line
for food.
Lucky students who find the icon and click on it are
taken to a pop-up screen where they fill in their personal information and submit it. One name is randomly
selected each week and the winner receives a $lO gift certificate to the bookstore, Essie Mae's or the Kohlberg or
Science Center coffee bar.
But wait, there's more! If you have an announcement
for an on-campus group or event, just send an article or
ad to the publication! One submission confirmation
number with a college email address will be chosen ran-

domly to win another $lO gift certificate. You may think
it's silly now, but I assure you these certificates will
come in handy when you're fresh out of meals and points
and hankering for chicken fingers and fries. Lucky winner Ben Firestone 'O7 can attest to the pleasure of winning the gift certificate. Not a regular reader of the
Weekly News, Firestone entered the spam contest for one
reason: "The money," he said. And now he's $lO richer.
Jumping on the bandwagon, Essie Mae's just ended
its Halloween trivia and candy jar contests and have
added another trivia contest. Last Friday, the trivia contest included two true/false statements and questions
about the various events that took place on Halloween.
To enter the contest, students e-mailed answers to
"snack." The 13th e-mail received with all three answers
correct was declared victorious.
Students entered the candy jar contest by writing
their names and guesses on a clipboard. Candy-counting
"got the biggest response, with quite a few pages of paper
filled with names and guesses," Essie Mae's Manager
Scott Tutton wrote in an e-mail.
And for students who just don't want to try, the
"Student of the Week" contest randomly doles out
awards to students who are standing in line for food.
"We realized that students, waiting in line in the hallway for the meal equivalency periods, were just standing
next to a plain, brown, ugly wall," Tutton wrote. As a
result, the bulletin board was "dressed up a bit" and the
contests were created "just to have a little fun!"
The first winner of the trivia contest, Jawaad Hussain
'O5, won "a small tin of candy corn," he said. "Since I was
the winner, Scott Tutton gave me a couple of [prize]
options." The loot was mailed to Hussain through campus mail in a discreet envelope. "It was amusing that I
won," he said.
Victoria Martello 'OB, in contrast, became a lucky contest winner three days in a row. Martello first decided to
enter on a whim while getting breakfast at Essie Mae's
one morning, she said. She already knew the answer to
two of the questions right off the bat and with a little

Martello hopes that others will take part in the various contests that the Snack Bar produces. In addition to
being fun, "it was something to do outside of my daily
routine," she said. Surely in the midst of an overload of
papers and problem sets, Swatties can appreciate Essie

aren't?)

At the time, I more or less shrugged this well-meaning (I
think) diatribe off, partly because the writer made a creepy
reference to carrying a microcassette recorder for one-night
stands and partly because I find myself to be, if not a stellar
girlfriend, then one who is Better Than You Probably Think.
I mean, I've done dumb things in my dating career, but I
chalk most of them up to lack of experience, such as the time
I fondled a guy's wallet for half an hour before he kindly
redirected my caresses.
Plus, things with Internet Boyfriend are going well. I'm
elated to finally be in a relationship that is, well, completely normal (relatively speaking, Swatties). He has an actual
job, he doesn't shoot squirrels with a BB gun or have a thing
for feet, and he wears pants. I can't believe my luck.
And really, we haven't been fighting at all, although
there was one little detail that was bothering me about him:
He seemed not that thrilled about the sex columnist thing.
He never told me not to write, but he also never asked me
about the subject. I began to wonder why he isn't just the
least bit curious.
So then, being crazy, I did something really horrible,
something considerate and non-crazy partners simply do
not do. I compared.
In my head I thought, "My last boyfriend read all my
columns and even respected me enough to lie about liking
them." I tried to let it go, but it nagged at me.
And the really terrible thing is, though I didn't completely see it, Internet Boyfriend was being a good sport
about my arguable inappropriateness. He looked only mildly surprised when I made the mistake of asking casually,
"So what kinds of sex have you had?" after only a couple of
weeks of dating, and he agreed to accompany me to the
Halloween party, even though my friend and I dressed up as
a pair of giant, lumpy breasts. As various people unexpectedly pinched and poked my uni-breast, which in my opinion
was the most un-sexy costume imaginable (they must have
had a thing for pregnant women), my boy stood by me
steadily increasing his grip around my waist.
Afterward, while we were stumbling home and avoiding
the cops, I was reminded of a funny story from high school
involving getting caught making out in a park, a policeman
and an imaginary hamster. As I began to relate this anecdote, my boyfriend asked me not to bring up stories that
involve doing stuff with exes. Instead of letting it drop, I
became defensive and accused him of being repressive of
my personality. We argued about it for a while until I
stepped back and marveled at how right my relationship ein the immortal words of Cher
coach had really been
Horowitz, I was clueless. Even though I considered my ability to candidly discuss these issues a positive trait (I know,
it's debatable), I was completely ignoring his boundaries.
The moral of the story: There is a difference between
"changing" for a person and being considerate of their feelings. Could I manage to exercise a little self-restraint in
order to keep this boy around?
Clearly, the answer is yes. I mean, look at what the poor
kid has to put up with. If he weren't Jewish, he'd probably

be a saint.

'Smile' worth the long wait
Former Beach Boys star's greatest achievement released 30 years after inception
BY JOE KILLE
jkillel@swarthmore.edu

—i

In the late 19605,
Brian Wilson willingly gave up his
sanity in an attempt
to compose an album
of beautiful

music,

sounds and emotion
that would find whatever scraps of childhood that could be
assembled in that
moment of American
history. Due to the
pressures
of his
record company, the
! Beach Boys and the
task of completing
what he wanted to make his greatest achievement,
Wilson cracked and completely abandoned the "Smile"
project. He left behind some completed singles and
album tracks that would be released on "Smiley Smile"
and some snippets of rehearsals and experimental mixes
that would circulate as bootlegs until the present day.
With the release of the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band," which he admired probably more
than Paul, John, George or Ringo, Brian announced that
"Smile" would never be finished. Any hope of hearing

his completed vision seemed lost.
But here we are in 2004, and because of something to
do with black holes and stuff Stephen Hawkins said was
impossible, Brian Wilson has actually completed and
released a new recording of "Smile" on Nonesuch
records.

It's impossible for me to accurately convey how
important, wonderful, touching and just utterly mesmerizing I believe "Smile" to be. Just writing a review saying it's a good album would suggest that my appreciation
were based on some technical analysis, as if there were
poor parts of the album, no matter how few, that needed
mention.

"Smile" deserves so much more than that. The initial

feelings I experienced while listening to the album were
indescribable. The songs on "Smile" don't stand by themselves; they are a cohesive whole that flows and climbs
like an American symphony. Themes from the album's
opener "Heroes and Villains" appear throughout the
album, as well as hints and teases of the end, "Good
Vibrations." These two tracks were completed and
released as two of the greatest singles of the late 1960s
and early 19705, but here their new recordings act as the
sunrise and sunset of the album.

It's impossible for me to accurately
convey how Important, wonderful,
touching and just utterly mesmerizing I believe "Smile" to be.
The songs that make up the body of the work visit one
another and intermingle as well. "Roll Plymouth Rock"
playfully finds it's way into "On a Holiday," and "Child
is the Father of the Man" fades into the background, but
never completely disappears, as "Surfs Up" plays. Each
song on the album is masterfully produced by Mr.
Wilson, with a countless number of instruments and

wonderful sounds filling up each moment.
I originally thought that Brian Wilson's failing and
aged voice would hurt the intended innocence and childlike nature of the album, since bootleg tracks and those
released on "Smiley Smile" all have the voice of a man 30
years younger and accompanied by the Beach Boys in
their prime. While his singing voice has fallen from the
grace and weightlessness that the perfect harmonies of
the past demanded, it is no less honest nor hopeful than
it had been. Wilson's voice gives a new truth to the songs
a new sadness. But that slight hint of sorrow allows
the highs of the album to soar endlessly, without sounding forced or insincere.
My mom's father died before I was born, and because
of that he took on a heroic stature in my mind. Because
of my mom and grandmother's stories, he'll forever live
as this unattainable part of my history. I could only ever
guess how my grandfather would describe his own life
and adventures if he were alive now
though I realize
I'd often have to acknowledge that aging would have
tinged those stories in his mind with the inevitable pain
of a long life.
The new recording of "Smile" relates to its past,
"Smiley Smile" and the bootlegs, the way my grandfather
would if he were alive now and could tell me the story of
his life with every piece of mythology, wonder and legend still intact, as if there were no pain to life after the
glory of youth, and as if the only sadness that accompanied aging was the knowledge that today giyes one less
day to enjoy yourself and live.
With the new recording of "Smile," the Brian Wilson
of 2004 is able to deliver, from an aging voice and rebuilt
psyche, the same joy and exuberance that he intended to
release during his youth, proving that it is possible to
experience happiness so truly and profoundly that it
lasts forever. I can't imagine any greater hope.

Alice Coltrane shines a 'Translinear
BY NASH ADAMSON
tadamsol@swathmore.edu

Ah, the concept: a Phoenix article
about a new jazz release to be followed
by an afternoon broadcast (Thursday,
5:30-7 p.m.) of the music on WSRN. Read
on to get the word, and tune in to get
your reward.

Alice Coltrane, "Translinear Light"
Alice Coltrane's 2004 Verve release,
"Translinear Light," is equally influenced by late 1960s avant-garde musings
and eastern spiritual music. When such
a record hits the racks, there is little
doubt that it will be interesting.
However, what is pleasantly surprising
about the album is its immediate accessibility and the fact that it becomes
more engaging with each spin.
When I saw that the record's first
track was "Sita Ram," a tune that
Coltrane first recorded over 30 years
ago, I assumed that, like many jazz
greats, Coltrane had run out of ideas.
And since Coltrane had stayed almost
entirely absent from the jazz scene for
over 25 years, tending to her husband
John's estate and starting a spiritual
foundation, a good record seemed highly

but it's good.
The record picks up when Coltrane
switches from organ to piano on the second track with the traditional tune
"Walk With Me." After a delicate introduction, Coltrane transitions into a
beautiful statement of the tune's
melody. Her first extended solo, featuring intricate right-hand improvisations
over harsh, pounding chords, is possibly
her best on the record.
"Walk With Me" is the only cut that
made me want to start it over immediately after it finished.

The synthesized string
introduction made me
expect whale sounds or
bird calls, not a jazz saxophone.
"Translinear Light" is a family
affair. Coltrane's son, Ravi, produced
the record. He is featured on tenor saxophone on five of the record's 11 tracks,
including the third cut, "Translinear

Light,"

But from her first entrance,
Coltrane's Wurlitzer organ swirls beautifully over intricate percussion.
Coltrane gives "Sita Ram" a reflective
revision. It's not therecord's high point,

Coltrane's youngest son, Oran, plays
alto on one track.
It is no surprise that Ravi sounds a
hell of a lot like John. But beyond the
obvious comparisons, Ravi's playing is

Light'

creative in its own right; he is a hard
blowing, competent saman.
Less can be said for Oran's work on
the record's fourth cut, "Jagadishwar."
The tune starts out with Ms. Coltrane's
regrettable decision to play synthesizer.
The synthesized string introduction
made me expect whale sounds or bird
calls, not a jazz saxophone. This isn't
new age crap, but it isn't too far from it.
Thankfully, the record picks up from
there. "This Train," another traditional
number, showcases legendary bass player Charlie Haden, whose bass solo is one
of the record's best. After a short corny
trip back into the world of synthesized
silliness on "The Hymn," the album is
solid to its finish.
Ms. Coltrane does fine covers of two
of John Coltrane's classic tunes, "Blue
Nile" and "Crescent."
"Blue Nile" showcases the record's
excellent rhythm sections at its best,
featuring Hadden on bass, Coltrane on
piano and another legend,
Jack
DeJohnette, on drums, all playing solidly under Ravi's technically driven sax
playing.
But it isn't until the record's penultimate cut, "Leo," that Alice lets it all
hang out. Her wurlitzer organ is finally
allowed to wail, wrapping its way
around the band's driving improvisa-

tions. It is on "Leo" that that Coltrane's

roots in late 1960s sound explorations is
most evident.
On the record's last cut, "Satya-Sai-

November 4, 2004

Isha," an eastern chant replaces the
driving jazz. Here, Coltrane's displays
her deep spiritual devotion most clearly,
without much fusion at all with her jazz
roots.

"Translinear Light" is in the running
for a number of awards, including
Downbeat's album of the year. Although
I tend to think that the folks at
Downbeat are a bunch of rambling
hacks, picking "Translinear Light"
would be to their credit.
The record walks the fine line
between commercial appeal and interesting playing. But it flirts consistently
enough with inspiring improvisations
that it is certainly worth a listen. Tune
in to WSRN to make up your mind.

Stay the course
We know the feeling. We're depressed too.
This past election season has seen college students

energized over a political contest as they haven't been
generations. Starting with the campaign of Howard
Dean in the Democratic primary, the "youth revolution"
began to dominate election news. Our age bracket donated unprecedented amounts of time and money to political campaigns, and it was college students like us who
made up the record turnouts this year in swing states.
The traditional, apathetic Swarthmore bubble burst in a
big way; we doubt there was a single dorm lounge that
wasn't full of students staring at a TV and futilely praying for a Kerry victory Tuesday night.
But it's not just about Democrats and Republicans.
Though issues like the War on Terror or tax policy
divide our generation into left and right camps, the statistics show younger Democrats and Republicans alike
are liberal (or, if you prefer, libertarian) on most social
issues. Swarthmore College Republicans, Young
Democrats and Progressive Action Committee members
tend to be in favor of gay marriage or at least civil
unions. We thought Bush's insistence on supporting the
Federal Marriage Amendment was a liability, not a
strength.

It feels worse than losing an election; what stings is
that Karl Rove knew that our age bracket had strong
preferences on certain issues
gay marriage foremost,
but also issues like abortion and separation of church
and state
and explicitly chose to ignore them, telling
Bush to hold the course and have faith that the older
generation of social

conservatives would overwhelm us.
He seems to be right. What could be more discouraging
than to have a youth revolution and have the winner of
the election win by essentially ignoring it? What could
our efforts feel irrelevant?
But consider this: Turnout among the old-guard cultural conservatives had to be pushed very hard this
year to keep up with turnout among the newly hardcore
Anybody But Bush college base that started with Dean
for America. A president who used to have an approval
rating in the high 90th percentile, running as an incumbent war president with one of the best-oiled politicking
machines in history behind him, was fighting for every
last vote against a challenger who, in all honesty, ran a
rather uninspiring and uncharismatic campaign. All it
took was the fast and furious flood of public opinion
from young people that dragged half the country behind
it and had the Democratic establishment running to
keep up. The resurrection of the Democrats as a viable
opposition party started with bloggers and college
organizers a year ago, and without them might never
have happened in the same way.
Bush won as a lackluster candidate by a technicality
in 2000 because the people our age who would have
opposed him were too busy staying home from the polls
or protest-voting for Nader to think mainstream politics
mattered. Had we been that energized then, when he
didn't have all the advantages he was running with
today, the election could have been decisive enough that
hanging chads would never have been a factor. We

Why won't our faculty speak out?
Dear Editor:
The faculty at Swarthmore are learned, talented and
engaging. Yet on countless issues, on questions of direct
consequence, the vast majority of professors have been
silent. Why have there been no significant, sustained faculty voices
for or against
the Iraq War? Why has there
been no debate over the genocide in Sudan, or the even closer poverty in Chester? Beyond an occasional volunteer to
moderate a debate or introduce an outside lecturer, we find
no desire on the part of the faculty to contribute their perspectives.

This has not always been the case. In 1969, members of
the faculty played a crucial role in pressing for reforms in
the admission of students of color. They held marathon sessions debating whether to endorse SASS's demands
and
ultimately, they did. During the Vietnam War, political science professors regularly held teach-ins. A 1986 resolution
to divest from the South African apartheid regime was
passed with significant support from the faculty.
The current silence has not been universal. We note the
2002 proposal of Barry Schwartz that faculty volunteer a
pay cut of one percent for three years in order to offset the
implementation of a living wage. Some professors, as we
mentioned above, have been central to bringing scholars to
campus to debate current issues. Yet on one of the most central issues to American society today, the Iraq War, the facindeed, they
ulty have been reluctant to share their views
refused to even participate in a poll of their opinions.
In comparison to professors at other colleges, the facul-

ty's voices seem extremely circumscribed. MIT linguistics
professor Noam Chomsky, probably the most famous lecturer for a topic outside his academic field, has written
abundantly about U.S. foreign policy. Eric Reeves, an
English professor at Smith College, authors bimonthly articles on Sudan, while Harvard professor Rebecca Mercuri is
a leading voice in criticisms of electronic voting machines.
If the college's mission is to "help its students realize
their fullest intellectual and personal potential combined
with a deep sense ofethical and social concern," then is the
faculty meeting its responsibility? What better way to teach
that academic excellence must be combined with social
responsibility than to lead by example?
There are many ways faculty could carry out their social
responsibilities. Some suggestions include (but are not limited to) integrating social issues into their courses, publishing their thoughts on social topics in blogs or popular publications, ensuring that their pension plans and the college's endowment are invested in ways warranted by the
values of the college, organizing faculty charities to fund
nonprofit groups, and hosting teach-ins or panel discus-

sions on relevant social issues.

Distinguished faculty of Swarthmore College, we urge
you to combine your academic endeavors with social
activism. Take the initiative to speak up and act on any cur .

rent social issue. The Swarthmore community, especially
the students, will thank you for it.

entirely foreign to us. The

once-chilling myth that the
winding halls of Dana and
Hallowell were constructed in
the late '6os to prevent student
riots now sounds like a joke.
Of the veritable smorgasbord of tactics available to
effect social change, demonstrating receives only the most
respect
among
minimal

Swarthmore
students.
Escorting women safely to
abortion clinics, taking legal action against Diebold, and tutoring kids in Chester all receive props in a way that shouting
peace chants at a march never will.
Nevertheless, protest remains an essential element of
American political expression. Bush's presidency inspired the
largest-scale mobilizations of all time. Around the world on
February 15,2003, more than 10 million people protested the war
on Iraq. It was the largest day of coordinated protest ever
known. A little more than a year later, at the March for
Women's Lives, an estimated Ll5 million descended on the
National Mall in Washington, D.C. The official crowd count was
the largest ever for a women's rights rally in the nation's capitol. And just this August at the Republican National
Convention, the demonstrations were the largest in history at
an American political convention.
Still, to Swatties, protesting puts a bad taste in our mouths.
Maybe it's the fact that we're reticent to simplify important
political issues into boisterous protest chants. Or maybe our
collective memories don't go far back enough. Maybe if we had
lived through the civil rights or anti-Vietnam War movements
we would think differently. But our collective memory need
only go back to 1999 when 50,000 citizens descended on the
streets of Seattle and shut down the World Trade Organization.

Protesters surrounded the theater where opening ceremonies for the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial
were to have been held. Only a few hundred of the 5,000 delegates made it inside. When the trade talks finally began, they
were heated and rancorous, and the meeting ended in a stalemate, with African, Caribbean and some Asian countries refusing to support a draft agenda that had been negotiated behind
closed doors without their participation. The failure of the
W.TO Ministerial meeting in Seattle was a historic watershed.
It demonstrated that globalization is not an inevitable phenomenon which must be accepted at all costs, but a political project,
which can be responded to politically.
The power of demonstration is as important in bringing
about change at the local level as it is in shifting the course of
global events. In spring of 2001, Harvard was in the midst of its
own living wage battle. After more than two years of meetings,
coalition-building, writing op-eds, sponsoring teach-ins and collecting petitions, the Harvard Living Wage Campaign began an
indefinite sit-in in Harvard's administrative offices. After 21
days of action, the Harvard administration was forced to make
several immediate concessions and to institute a process that
wouldbring about a living wage policy to the entire university.
As rumors fly around the Swarthmore campus of the possibility of a sit-in this fall to achieve a living wage at Swarthmore,
we have to ask ourselves, "Would such a demonstration work
here?" The answer is that it already has. As early as the 19605,
Swarthmore's Board of Managers began discussing the question of whether the college should divest itself of stock in companies that, because of their South African holdings or involvement, could be viewed as economically supportive of apartheid.
While some partial divestments were made, the issue of total
divestiture only came to ahead in early 1986 after student
demonstrations and a sit-in at a Board of Managers meeting.
The Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign
has been fighting for just compensation for our lowest-paid
workers for four years now. If they choose to escalate their tactics to a sit-in, they will only do so having exhausted every
avenue of dialogue with the administration that could lead to a
living wage. And if they do sit in, they will be following in a
proud tradition of direct action (one for which our collective
memory as Swatties doesn't serve us well enough). Wellplanned nonviolent direct action demonstrates the depth of our
opposition to injustice and ensures that our concerns are listened to, understood and dealt with.

On learning how to be a player
Getting black America in on the great game of capitalist power

To truly understand economics one must see it as
Xenophon, the ancient Greek who invented the discipline, saw it. Whereas Adam Smith defined it as the
science of "the wealth of nations," Xenophon more
modestly, and more
accurately, defined it as
the science of estate
im-

,

management.
According to him, economics is about acquiring and maintaining
property and living
within one's means.
Microeconomics is primary; macroeconomics
is secondary.
The understanding
of
and application
Xenophon's economic
TARU TAYLOR
principles is the single
most powerful antidote
Gadfly
to the plague of consumerism which corrupts and ruins mass
American society. Xenophon's "Economics" is the
classic statement of economics no less than Aristotle's
"Organon" is the classic statement of logic, Euclid's
"Elements" is of geometry, and Sir Francis Bacon's
"Novum Organum" is of science and inductive

method. Ignorance of Xenophon's principles amounts
to economic illiteracy, the bane of consumer existence.

The Mormons embody the fiscal discipline outlined
by Xenophon's classic. Over the course of several gen-

erations they have built
an economic empire
with Utah as their base
of operations. The Amish
of Pennsylvania and the
Jewish Bund of New
York have likewise erected their own economic
networks. So have the

makes money for the purpose of capital formation, not
bling-bling. I admire the Mormon, Bundist Jew,
Amish and Mafioso, for they "render unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar's, and render unto God the
things that are God's." Meanwhile, the mass of consumers are slaves indebted to corporate Caesar.
As a group, if Afro-Americans in the U.S.A. were
recognized as a separate nation, they would be 11th
richest in the world, for last year they made $675 billion. On average, black families' median family

keep up with the Joneses. I

income was $29,600. Their white familial counterpart's
was $47,000, about one and a half times more. Is this
disparity a result of institutional white supremacy?
Sure. But what about the fact that the median net
worth of the black family was $6,000, whereas the
median net worth of the white family was $BB,OOO, 14
times more than black families? Is this disparity a
result of institutional white supremacy? I don't think
so. It is a result of economic illiteracy and lack of discipline. This disparity simply shows that blacks live
beyond their means and spend more than they earn.
But if Afro-Americans were to acquire the discipline
to live within their means, ideally below their means,
which George Fraser, black business self-help guru,
describes as "the ability to pay yourself at least 10 percent of what you earn each month"
then black
America would most likely become an economy rivaling G-7 nations such as Germany, Japan and Canada.
If Afro-Americans were to learn to see John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust (now Exxon, Mobil,
Amoco, et al) as the blueprint of socio-economic
organization; to see the holding company, not civil

Archimedean lever of black
power; to see capitalism not

then they could finesse

Costume Shop not just a campus closet

Academic, theatrical productions take precedence over Halloween parties
Dear Editor:
In response to the Oct. 21 article
entitled "Costume Shop: Frills
Feathers good 'Ween fun" (pg. 10),
which we were not given to review
before publication, we'd like to clarify some misrepresentations of the
+

Costume Shop.
First of all, we are not here to provide college students outfits to wear
to parties. The Costume Shop is a
workshop for all campus theatre and
dance production costume needs.
The Shop does not exist to sell or
make clothes for the general student
body. While we do have the ability to

lend items to members of the college
community, our purpose first and
is
foremost
academic.
On Friday, Oct. 29 we found students in the shop before our stated
open hours. As Costume Shop comanagers, we do not appreciate this
lack of respect for our procedures.
No one without a key to the shop
should enter if Susan Smythe or we
are not present. Many of our costumes are hand-sewn, taking much
time and effort on our part. We are
not here to dress college students for
fun and debauchery, nor are the cos-

tumes we make fit for that purpose.

While we appreciate the attention
the Costume Shop has received since
the Oct. 21 article, much that concerned the primary function and the
basic rules ofthe Costume Shop went
unmentioned. As we work hard to
maintain the shop, we ask the college
community to respect our space
the Costume Shop is not a communal
closet, but exists to serve many academic and artistic productions.

is one we should avoid whenever possible, and I am offering a few simple ways for us to do that.
Although I do not think the way the police have handled the ML party for the past two years has done anything positive for anyone, and I call on those "noise cornplainer" Ville residents to rethink their relationship with
the college and realize they are blessed with a college that

can't reasonably expect police officers to respect our
desires not to be charged with crimes they know we are
committing under their noses. A large part of this problem may indeed be the behavior of the police, but the only
thing we students can change to solve this problem is our
own behavior. In an ideal world, perhaps we could all
roam the streets freely doing whatever we wanted regardless of our age, but this is not that world. In the real
world, we are subject to the laws of this country and, yes,
even those of the Ville. Swarthmore students fail to
respect this, and that is just as much a part of the reason
for the increase in citations as the newly aggressive
police force. I am by no means suggesting that we cease
all criminal activity on campus, as that would be preposterous on this or any college campus, but I am suggesting
that we not engage in it so brazenly and with such arrogance that we actually get angry when the police try to

stop us.
In the past two weeks, I have, on three separate occasions when police have been present (for reasons
unknown) near on-campus social events, heard
Swarthmore students yell, at full volume, "Fuck the
cops!" Are you people insane? You're not at a protest, and
if you think this is some noble form of civil disobedience,
it's not. It's called being a jerk. This type of behavior just
strains our relationship with the police, giving them
more justification to do everything they can to bust us in
the future. It certainly doesn't send the desired message

November 4, 2004

that we are mature enough to handle ourselves and our
social scene responsibly without affecting our neighbors.
Thus, my first suggestion is obvious: Quit being jerks.
And for those of you preferring "Fuck Public Safety!",
which I have heard plenty as well recently, if you're complaining about anything other than an unexpected boot,
you should look at some other schools and realize that
Public Safety really is an unparalleled asset in the quest
for our own personal safety, sans arrest. Anything we do
to alienate them is shooting ourselves in the foot.
My second and final suggestion is simply that we all
quit being idiots. Too many underclassmen insisted on
walking to and from ML rather than waiting three minutes for the shuttle. It's in that area between campus and
ML that the citations occur every year, and we can easily
remedy this problem with some good old-fashioned "not
walking in front of police while breaking the law" and
waiting for that shuttle. It amazes me how much this student body cares about the well-being of so many people
outside of our bubble, yet we can be so grossly negligent
when it comes to our own well-being. I wish I could say
all this was admirable, but when it comes down to it, it's
really just stupid. With fewer jerks and less stupidity,
2005 could likely bring the first Halloween party in years

without a single citation.

In all likelihood, the first thing you would do is establis
a society. To adorn it with all the trappings of a highly covet

sible. Perhaps Princeton or Yale, but probably Harvard. You
could always expand it later.

In exchange, members would willingly give back to th

Suppose that whenever a member had joined the society
you had forced him or her to accept an agreement. But not a

"[Members] grant

Now suppose, because it's true, that direct-marketing list
of 1,000 names, sold just once, go for $350. Yours would go fo

ELECTION 2004: SWARTHMORE RESPONDS

Facing the election's aftermath
mon ground with people in Middle America who believe

BY PATRICK HART
phartl@swarthmore.edu
Despite the autumn trees and the temperate weather,
there was a feeling of bleakness at Swat yesterday.
Greetings between friends are subdued and quiet, and
people's laughter seems forced. There is no mystery
behind this feeling, of course; this campus was overwhelmingly supportive of Senator John Kerry's presi-

dentialbid and his loss has hit us hard.
The exit polls released early on yesterday looked
quite good for the Kerry campaign, so much so that I was
optimistic when I entered Upper Tarble slightly before 8
p.m. There are many who always believed that President
Bush would inevitably win re-election, but I honestly
believed, especially toward the end of the campaign, that
was going to become president. As the night wore
on, though, and more numbers from Florida and Ohio
came in, the mood became more somber in Upper Tarble.
especially when Kerry won
There were still cheers
Pennsylvania and Barack Obama won his Senate race
but as the night wore on, a Kerry win seemed less and
less likely.
We are left feeling numb, especially the many people
who put significant amounts of time into volunteering
for the campaign. We also feel somewhat disconnected
exit polls (insert the usual caveat about exit polls' reliablility) showed that the top issue for Bush voters was
"moral values." When this figure appeared on TV on election night, one of my friends angrily exploded. "You can't
run a country on moral values!" he yelled. To millions of
conservative Americans, though, a prescribed set of
moral values is all-important in deciding who will run
the country. Eleven states voted to ban gay marriage,
emphasizing the cultural gap even more. Do I have comKerry

that any loving sexual relationship I enter into is 'morally repulsive? I want to believe that there is some commonality there, that we all share some core values about
our lives. This election can hardly make one feel optimistic, though. The average progressive Swattie just has

a radically different mindset from the average Bush
voter's. Somehow, we must bridge that gap, but I do not
know the way.
This election is an ominous one for progressives for
reasons beyond just the Bush victory and the gay marriage initiatives already discussed. At the outset of this
campaign season, the Democrats believed they had a shot
at retaking the Senate. Instead, the Republicans added to
their majority there and did the same in the House. We
have some rough times ahead of us, and there is no use
pretending otherwise. At the same time, we must keep
fighting. Abandoning the political system is not any kind
of solution
it is abdication of our responsibility, as progressives, as Americans, and as human beings, to work
to make our country and our world a better place. My
favorite blogger, Josh Marshall, now worries that the
many progressive groups that swelled as the drive to
beat Bush intensified will decrease in membership and
enthusiasm. That outcome would be the worst possible,
though; with a resurgent conservative government, we
will need progressive activism more than ever.
As for the specifics of the future, I have little wisdom
to impart. There will be more political battles, of course,
and members of both parties are already beginning to
think about 2008. Life will go on, though without the hope
of a Bush-less White House in 2005, it may feel a bit less
zesty. We face unhappy times ahead, but we can weather
the storm together.
We will survive, Swat. A better day will come.

If anyone looked around at the faces of Swarthmore
students on Nov 3, 2004, he or she would conclude that
some catastrophic event had taken place. Even as a
Republican, I am not thrilled with the results of the election- though I had hoped to see Bush win, I could name
many other Republicans that I wish were in his place
right now. However, I think that there are some positive
aspects of this election that even Swatties should recognize. Despite the general Swarthmore disapproval with
the elected candidate, in this election we at least have a
clear victory. I deeply respect Senator Kerry for his gracious concession and realization that "the outcome

should be decided by voters, not by a protracted

legal

process".

Looking at his track record in his last term and this
campaign, one might doubt that Bush will be a uniter for
this term. However, there is still hope for a relatively
united America in the next 4 years. As Bush referenced
in his acceptance speech, this is his last campaign. The
fact that Bush no longer needs to cater to any particular
group within his political base allows him to govern on

the basis of the interests of America as a whole rather

than just the interests of his voting base. Despite the fact
that Bush has cozied up with the neoconservatives and
the religious right to an extent that has scared even the
Republicans on campus, he is not bound to their interests
or principles. Fears that these groups will have complete
control of our government for the next four years should
be tempered by evidence of dissent among Republicans
over the Federal Marriage Amendment and the rise of
Republican moderates such as Giuliani and McCain. A
Republican Congress does not necessarily imply a lack of
checks on the president.
As a more moderate Republican, I am looking forward
to 2008 when a candidate runs who I can wholeheartedly
back. I'm sure that other Swarthmore students look forward to backing a candidate on the other ticket. That
being said, I think we should realize that waiting four
years for that point will not necessarily be catastrophic.

Democrat workers' efforts not wasted

As I walked into Sharpies today, the day after the
election, I spotted a friend of mine looking a little down.
I approached her, she informed me that John Kerry had
conceded the election. As I watch Senator Kerry's outstanding speech, I noticed my fellow students. They
seemed deflated and heartbroken.Some looked like they
were ready to cry. Personally, I did not feel strongly
about this election. I found both men to have deep flaws,
and I remained undecided until I stepped into the voting booth down the street at the elementary school. I
ended up voting for President Bush, but doing so with a
heavy heart.
Thus, I am not devastated by the returns of this elecNovember 4, 2004

tion, but hopeful that the President will surpass my best
instead of my worst. Yet the people around
me remain devastated. They poured their time and
heart into a campaign in which they deeply believed,
and they do not see the fruits of their labors on a
national level. Yet I do not believe that all is lost for
them. My friends, think of what you have done. You
helped more people turn up at the polls than in recent
memory. Because of your efforts, a swing state turned
into an early-predicted and solid win for Sen. Kerry,
with a wider margin than that of Ohio. For a group of
people our age, that is tremendous. You did more than
anyone expected, you had as great an impact as possible, and you have helped our generation and those
above remember the import of our civic responsibility.

Volleyball finds Salisbury too tough to chew
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore volleyball team finished its season at home last Saturday in a
tough loss to Salisbury after a third-game
comeback fell just shy. The Seagulls defeated Swarthmore 3-0 (30-20, 30-19, 34-32) in
front of a large home crowd that included
parents and faculty as well as many students. The match marked the last time the
Garnet's two seniors, Erica Newton 'O5
and Natalie Dunphy 'O5, will compete in a
Swarthmore uniform, and both were honored by coach Harleigh Leach in a ceremony that involved the players and their parents prior to the game.
The ceremony added to the already
high spirits of the players and fans, and
the Garnet came out on the court excited
and for Newton
to finish off its season
and Dunphy, their Swarthmore careers
on a high note. Swarthmore came out
strong, staying even with Salisbury for
the opening of the first game, and midway
through the score was tied at 15-15. But
from there the Seagulls went on a fivepoint run, aided by Garnet errors, and
forced Swarthmore to call a timeout at 2015. It was a lead that Salisbury would
never relinquish but continue to build on,
as it closed out the game at 30-20.
In the second game, Salisbury made its
key run early in the game, and
Swarthmore never had an opportunity to
lead. Serving while leading 5-3, the
Seagulls pushed Swarthmore back on its
heels and gained an 11-3 lead over the
Garnet. Salisbury closed out with another
run to win the game 30-19 and go up 2-0 in
the match.

Despite the laxness that was shown in
parts of the first two games, the Garnet
proved it could turn on the afterburners
when it was necessary. Early in the third

game it appeared as if it would be a disappointing replica of the last game, as
Salisbury opened up an early 8-3 lead that
it built to 19-9. The Garnet comeback
began with Emily Conlon 'O6 serving
down 21-14. Conlon brought the team back
to within 21-17, and the Garnet continued
to claw away at the Seagulls' lead behind
solid blocking and strong attacks to tie
the game at 29-29 on a block by Karen

Berk 'OB. The game was tied on each of the
next three points, as the Garnet earned
points on kills by Berk and Katie Gold 'OB
and an ace by Erica George 'O7. But with
Swarthmore serving in a tense 32-32 tie,
Salisbury earned a sideout and won the
next point to take the match, 34-32, and

end the Garnet's season with it.

"Salisbury made a lot of mistakes, and

we in turn made a lot of mistakes,"
Newton said. "We fell into a little bit of a
slump." Despite the loss, she enjoyed the
experience of playing in her last match,
with family and friends looking on. "It
was a lot of fun and it was a great way to
end the year," she said.
George led the team with 10 kills and
added 15 digs in the match. Patrice Berry
'O6 had 15 digs as well, and Conlon recorded 22 assists for the Garnet.
All in all, it was a season of mixed success for the Garnet, who finished at 9-18
overall, but one that also makes Leach very
hopeful for the future. "We had some really high goals, and we achieved some of
them," Leach said. "I think we set a really
big standard for next year. The seniors
have set a good example." Next fall, Leach
will be counting on the continued improvement of her underclassmen, including Gold
and Berk, whom she especially praised for

their play

against Salisbury.

"I'm just really excited about next
year," Leach said. "We're definitely going
to be a force in the conference."

to third

BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
Last weekend's Centennial
Country
Conference Cross
Championships were full of

impressive

performances.
James Golden 'O5 and defending
champion Lang Reynolds 'O5
completed the 8K course in
27:08.10 and 27:1111 placing 12th
and 13th respectively in the race.
Both secured spots in the top 14,
earning the two harriers AllConference honors as well as a
third-place finish for the team.
Next came Garret Ash 'O5,
Ross Weller 'OB and Adam Hunt
'O6, all crossing the finish line
within the same second. Ash
placed 26th (27:58.21) Weller
placed 27th (27:58.22) and Hunt
placed 28th (27:58.23). "Ross
Weller had a great race. I was
excited to see him finishing with
Adam and Garrett," Golden said.
But the scoring did not stop
there. Keefe Keely 'O6 finished
the course in 28:11.29, earning
34th place, and Mickey Katz 'OB
crossed the line at 28:28.34, taking 41st.
"The team ran really well,"
said.
Reynolds
Although
Reynolds admits that some of
the runners may not have had
their best races, he was very
happy with the team's finish.
"We really showed our depth by
still placing third," Reynolds
said. "The course was really
hard, and everybody ran really
smart."
Last year, Reynolds took first
place in the conference meet.
"After winning last year, it's a
little disappointing not to be in
front again, but all things considered I'm happy with the way
things went," Reynolds said.
"Both James and I had good

races, passing a lot of people in
the last two miles."
Illness was a small factor in
the
Garnet
performance,
although coach Pete Carroll
believes his runners ran a
strong meet overall. "We were
two runners away from having a
perfect day," Carroll said. "Jim
Kreft, who got the flu Thursday,
was only able to run at 80 percent. If he's healthy, we might
get Dickinson. Otherwise, all the
other guys picked up the slack."
The lower the number of
points a team has accumulated by
the end of the meet, the higher its
place is. The Garnet accumulated
87 team points to finish behind
Dickinson and Haverford.
"I thought our team ran really
well at the meet," Golden said. "I
was
glad
that we beat
Muhlenberg because they beat us
earlier in the year. It was frustrating to get so completely
destroyed by Haverford, though."

Haverford, a cross country and

track powerhouse, took first
place by a commanding 18 points.
"Haverford has been unbeliev-

able this season; they just keep
getting better and better. If you
take them out, though, James and
I only got beat by a couple of
guys, so that's encouraging for
Regionals," Reynolds said.
The team travels to the NCAA
Mid-East Regional meet on Nov.
13 at Allegheny. "The [conference
meet] course was very hilly and
tough, so I am looking forward to
the flatter course at the regional
meet," Golden said. The team
will be working hard to get ready
for Regionals.
"Now we're going to re-focus
and train hard for another two
weeks, and I think we have a
good shot at doing well as a team
at Regionals," Reynolds said.
"Hopefully
we
can
beat
Dickinson and send a few guys
to Nationals."

only literally, though.
It was an uphill battle
The Centennial Conference meet, hosted by
McDaniel in Westminster, MD, was a day of stellar
performances. Rookie runner Sarah Hobbs 'O6
produced another outstanding performance, covering the 6K course in 23:15.2 and earning second
place overall. Carrie Ritter 'O6 joined Hobbs on the
All-Conference team, taking 12th place in the
meet.
Hobbs admits that it is not as easy as she makes
it look. "It was a tough course," she said. "I think
the overriding theme of the meet was hills
more
exactly, the ravine of death."
Ritter also saw the Green Terror's course as a
big challenge, but the team was able to prepare
before the start of the competition. "I think an
important part of our performance on Saturday
was our chance to review and run on the course
the day before," she said. "Many sections of the
McDaniel course are very demanding, and we
were able to look those sections over and plan how
we wanted to run the race."
Hobbs was proud of how well the girls kept on
pace. "We went out really smart and caught a lot of
people at the end," she said. "I was in 20-something
place at the first mile, but it's all about keeping the
faith. I was caught up by the beginning of the third

mile."
November 4, 2004

Hobbs was less than 30 seconds behind the first

place finisher, Emily Hulme from Dickinson. "I
kept waiting for the girl who won to die, but it didn't happen," she said. The race became a guessing

game of when Hume would start to falter. "I kept
thinking, 'Hmmm, maybe she'll be tired now?
Nope. How about now? Um, still going strong,'"
Hobbs said.
Coach Pete Carroll was proud of the accom-

plishments achieved his runners and wishes he
had maybe pushed them a little harder. "If I had
not told [Hobbs] to be so conservative in the first
mile, she might have won," he said.
Ritter acknowledged the strong performance of
another rookie, Kavita Hardy 'OB. "Kavita really
stepped it up for this race," she said. "She ran a
smart race on a difficult course, and came away
with her best performance of the season"
Both Hobbs and Ritter earned All-Conference
honors. Hardy 'OB secured a time of 25:04.18 for an
18th place finish. Emily Wistar 'O6 was the next
harrier to come in, at 26:0218, taking 43rd place.
Pam Davis 'O7 also finished in the top 50, taking
49th place with a time of 26:16.45, and closing out
the scoring for the Garnet.
The women took fifth place overall with 117
points and hope to improve their standings at the
regional meet. "All in all I was pretty proud of our
performance on both sides," Carroll said. "I look
for even better things at the regional meet in two
weeks."

Earthworms: a match made in Haverford
BY TORI MARTELLO

vmartell@swarthmore.edu

It was a day of tricks and treats for the
Earthworms Saturday when they traveled
to Haverford to participate in the
'Haverween' tournament.
The team's main trick was to figure out
how to play in its assortment of outfits

ranging from bridesmaids' dresses to tuxedos. In the spirit of Halloween, the
Ultimate Frisbee team chose to be a wedding party filled with all the characters
including the traditional bride, played by
Billy Schwarz 'O5, the groom, played by cocaptain Alan Smith 'O5, and the odd characters who make the event memorable,
such as the gay drunken uncles, the party

crasher, and the unforgettable wedding
singer.
While they enjoyed the fun with their
costumes and admired other teams' outfits
one squad pulled off a Mario theme with
kupas
these guys weren't only there to
play around.
This tournament marked an important
occasion for the squad, as it was the first
time it would compete together as one
entire team and it was the first time the
rookies faced off against A-squad opponents. Unfortunately, the inexperience and

the challenge of getting playing time for so
many guys proved difficult as the
Earthworms went 0-4 on Saturday.
"The freshmen and rookies got good
experience," Smith said, "but it was difficult to get consistent play out of the entire
team." Even though the team lost, the exposure in the tournament was invaluable as
the squad faced tough teams in the
University of Delaware, University of
Pennsylvania,
Johns
Hopkins
and
Franklin and Marshall. The lessons
learned in those matches will only help
this team improve. The players understood
that they had to go through a learning
curve, so they pushed away their frustrations and returned on Sunday with

renewed spirits.
The Earthworms had a complete reversal of fortune and went 2-0 with defeats of
the
B-squads
of
University
of
Pennsylvania and Penn State. "People
made dramatic improvements over the
course of the day," Smith said. "Many
rookies stepped up."
Now the team has a more familiar sense
of how to play collectively, and the rookies
know what the veterans of the team expect
in regards to preparation and demeanor
during a tournament.
Sunday's results are an overall reflection

This wedding party strikes a pose in an attempt to intimidate opponents.
of the success of this fall club season for the
Earthworms as they aimed to increase their
numbers and gain experience for all the
players. The team had its highest rookie
turnout this year, and all new players have
increased their skills. When the players
who are currently abroad return for the
spring college season, Smith said, "We will
be one of the teams to beat in the region."
The only possible obstacle that may prevent immediate success is the short time
the team has to acquaint the returning vet-

erans to the rookies in order to get them
used to playing together. However, Smith
doesn't feel that will be an issue as this
team meshed well together in the beginning of fall. He expects the spring transition to be a similar experience. The
Earthworms will have its top four players

returning this spring to bolster the roster.
For now, though, these guys will revel
in their treats as they continue to improve
and compete with two more possible tournaments ahead.

The women's field hockey team closed
a medicore season with a strong finish
against the Franklin and Marshall
Diplomats on Saturday. Although the
Garnet lost to the number-12 nationallyranked team, the squad was excited to
reach a level of play that forecasts a winning season next year.
Instead of being intimidated by a "formidable opponent, the squad came out
aggressively and cohesively. This mental
toughness led the Tide to score early in the
first half.
Katherine Athanasiades 'O5 was
pleased to see that, instead of following
the game style of Franklin and Marshall,
her team played its own brand of hockey.
"The tone of the game was definitely positive, and people came out doing the things
they've worked on all season," she said.
"It was really encouraging for next year
because most people are honing their
skills and becoming even better than they

THE PHOENIX

are."

Athanasiades highlighted the performance of teammate Julia Morrison 'O7. "The
ball was like glue on her stick! We were
excited to watch her play so well."
The team let up a little in the second
half when Franklin and Marshall stepped
up and aggressively battled the Tide.
Athanasiades said that the team was really "fired up" about scoring the first goal
only a minute into the second half. "They
realized they had to take us seriously," she
said. "We were still playing well, but they
stepped it up. They got scared."
The team held a rose ceremony before
the game as senior
names were
announced on the field. The team graduates
seven
seniors
including
Athanasiades, Joanna Hess, Lauren
Sippel, Julia Lindenberg, Chelsea Ferrel,
Val Marone and Emily Szydlowski.
Afterwards the team relaxed together
and basked in the glow of their last game.

Haverford disrupted the
Swarthmore
women's
soccer senior day on
Saturday in a 0-5 beating
of the home team. The
Fords netted four goals in
the first half en route to
the shutout. Goalkeeper
Rachael Jordan 'OB made
seven
saves
for
Swarthmore. Haverford
finished its season undefeated in the conference
in second place. The team
closes the season ninth in
the conference with a
record of

a 3-14-1 record

overall.
"This was a hard season because we lost key
players who have been
team leaders both on and
off the field in years
past," Sarah Hobbs 'O6
said. "That said, people
on the team really
stepped up to fill these
gaps. We rely a lot on our
underclassmen, and they
all carried their weight
this season."

The team reflected on
the season as one full to
difficulties. "We had to
overcome some tough
losses," Rachel Jacobs 'O5
said, "like our loss to
McDaniel, which went
into double overtime, and
focus on what went well
in the game and take that
to the next game."
Cheryl Nunes 'O7 said

more aggressive against
is opponents. "We need to
kill teams like Bryn
Mawr instead of beating
them 1-0," she said. "We
played our best game
against McDaniel. It's
really easy to be like 'we
lost again' but no, we
played well and for the
most part we all felt like
we put forth a good
effort."
For the most part, the
field was not a playingground for memorable
moments, only frustration and disappointment.
The Tide learned the art
of not getting "too down
on ourselves," as Nunes
put it.

"The best thing about
this season," Hobbs said,
"was really how the athletic community came
together to support each
other, the men's team
especially. When you
start to lose confidence,
it's helpful to have the
confidence and support
from your fellow athletes."
"I'm excited to start
over next year, wipe it
all
clean,
rebuild,"
Nunes said. "It was an
unfortunate
year
because it was a bad season, but morale-wise we
didn't have problems. I
tried to win the individual battles on the field,
but I can't speak for the
whole team, and it was
frustrating for the seniors."

Although

it

was

Jacobs' last year, she did
not let that frustration
show. "We always picked
up our level of play in the

second half, which shows
a lot of heart and determination," she said.
The strong social network of the team laid the
foundation for a great
season off the field,
which Nunes believes
was the strength of the
season. "We hung out a
lot together. I had more
fun at practice than at the
games," she said.
Jacobs recounts the
pasta
that
wrestling
occurred on a memorable
Thursday night at Paces.

"One of our "seniors,
Jessica Zagory, is a senior
class officer, and she first
told us about the upcoming pasta wrestling Pub
Night," Jacobs said. "It
was decided that this
would be a 'fun' freshman
activity, and so we
'encouraged' all of our
freshmen to participate.
Most did, even going so
far as to make uniforms.
They were hilarious and
damn good wrestlers. The
rest of us thought it
looked fun, and soon
members of all of the
other
classes
were

wrestling."

Did Jacobs wrestle?
"Yes. And I won." Only a
few days into her postlife,
soccer
Jacobs
already missed her girls.
Is there still soccer to be
played? "Yes," she says,
"old ladies' leagues."

Stories that matter
Approximately five days ago, the Boston Red Sox won the

World Series...
Say what?

Approximate...
No, I heard you the first time and I still don'tbelieve you.
Well, believe it or not, after a virtual millennium of anticipation,
the Boston Red Sox are finally the World Champions of Baseball.
It's been 86 years since Boston fans
last got to celebrate a victory, and

now they're so excited you can still
hear 'em partying all the way
down in Philadelphia.
But that's just the thing you
can't. I admit I'm not in Boston
right now, but from what I hear,
the city didn't burn down as so
many said it would. They had
what must've been an exciting
victory parade last Saturday, but
after that, life just went on. Even
-

worse, now that it's all over,
much has changed,
except for the writing on the TMATTHEW DRAPER shirts. Boston did not suffer from
an influx of new jobs, perfect
Rocks with Sticks schools, Coke in their water fountains, or brown paper packages

tied up with string. So what was
so special about this World Series? Why have the residents of
Boston waited 86 years for this, enduring heartbreak and agony
as they invested so much in their teams, only to watch them
come up short time and time again? Was it really worth all the
pain? What did they get out of waiting? Well, in the midst of an
election where the outcome of the "game" actually has consequences for the real world, I would like to remind everyone why
we watch sports in the first place, and why so many more
Americans scream at their TVs because of their sports teams
nothing

than because of politicians.
So what does it mean to be a sports fan? Some would claim it
means that you have at least three blades, spin rapidly when
plugged into an electric socket, and are used for some sporting
purpose. As fans of such large enterprises as the NCAA, the NBA,
the MLB, the NFL, and the No Hockey League (not that I'm bitter
or anything) would tell you, however, it means you are part of a
history, a tradition and a folklore, and that you subscribe to it
the stories it tells are truer to your identity than anything we see from our world leaders.
Unlike the two political parties you can choose to support or
ignore, the sports teams you cheer for inevitably say more about
who you are. Can you imagine anyone, for instance, identifying
with a political party that has lost for 86 years in a row? Well,
some people probably have done such a thing, but we think of
them as ludicrous, dreamers who can't come to grip with the realities of life. If you're a fan of the Red Sox, however, you're a cult
hero, a tragic figure who has, through your parents and/or grandparents, experienced an incredible legacy of tragic losses and historic blunders.
Red Sox fans do not cheer for their team just because they hope
they'll win. No one would have cheered for the Red Sox for this
long if they did not in some way get something out of the hope and
promise brought by each new success, and if they did not also get
something from enduring the pain and agony that only they can
understand. When the Red Sox won, they scored a victory for
""every little guy in the United States, every kid who has ever lost
86 games in a row (and has kept insisting he can win the next
one), everyone who thought that the rich and powerful always
win. The Red Sox even scored a victory for the Democrats,
reminding us that the rich, overpaid juggernaut that claims to
(and sort of) represents the common people can sometimes beat
the rich, overpaid juggernaut that represents the interests of all
the privileged members of this country.
Pro sports may be, in many ways, ridiculous, and perhaps we
could all spend our Sundays doing more edifying things than
watching strangers toss a pigskin around, but we don't just watch
so that we can see our team win and then gloat about it (except for
Yankees fans). Sports fanship is a process, not a result, and we
pour all of our attention into it because of the stories, stories we
will take with us to our deathbed while all the gummy promises
of politicians go slip-sliding away. Sports are for so many a great
hope, because unlike the stories we see unfold in our daily lives,
the impossible really can happen. The Boston Red Sox can win
*the World Series.

Rivalry games are supposed to be close, right?
The men's soccer team closed out the regular season on
Saturday night at Clothier field by unceremoniously obliterating an overmatched Haverford squad 3-1
The outcome of the game was never in question, as
Alex Elkins 'O6 scored off an unassisted rebound in
the first 15 minutes of play, leaving Ford keeper Tom
Reynolds sprawled out on the ground, staring at the
ball in the net. Swat has not blown a lead all season
and hammered home two more goals in the first 50
minutes of play to send the 4-14 Fords home with
more shame than Eddie Murphy after his run-in with
a transsexual Hollywood prostitute. Elkins' goal
immediately quieted the Haverford fans in attendance, fans usually famous for their loud and excruciatingly simple-minded taunting.
The atmosphere around Clothier Field was unusual calm before the 5 p.m. kickoff. For the first time in
years, Swat entered the game "knowint that it wasn't
the last game of the season," coach Eric Wagner said,
after his team finished carving up the soft underbelly
of the Fords' defense. "[That] was really great," he
said. The squad clinched a playoff spot last
Wednesday against Ursinus. That knowledge may
have contributed to the backyard woodshed beating
that the Tide subsequently handed Haverford.
"We had a lot of desire, heart, and energy," Kirk
Ellison 'O5 said of the match, "and even though we
weren't completely technically sound, we wanted to

win it more than Haverford."
The win was the first ever against Haverford for
coach Wagner and the first for Swat since 1995. Wagner
expressed a sense of detached relief in the wake of the
historic victory. "It's good to get the monkey off my
back," he said. "Let's move on to the next challenge."

The next challenge comes Friday, as Swat takes on
McDaniel in the Tide's first-ever Centennial
Conference playoff match at Johns Hopkins. The
Garnet was rewarded with the third seed and the
accompanying semifinal spot after a 6-2-1 season in

November 4. 2004

conference. Wagner is taking an unusual approach to
the postseason, explaining, "we're happy to be where
we are right now." The team has already accomplished
a lengthy list of preseason goals and now, Wagner com
tinued, he "does not want to waste this opportunity."
The Tide battied McDaniel to a 00 draw earlier this season. "They kind of outplayed us a little bit, so we're going to
try to possess the ball a little bit better," Wagner said.
A victory on Friday night would carry Swarthmore
into the finals on Saturday, most likely against Johns
Hopkins. The Tide also played two games in two days
earlier this season over fall break. "We know that we
have to prepare ourselves mentally a little differently
than we did before," Wagner explained. "The guys will
remember 'that was rough.'"
Practice has continued as usual, with a few exceptions. "We're having fun in practice and keeping each
other psyched," said Brandon Washington 'OB.
Goalkeeper Nathan Shupe 'O5 has been playing with
an injured thumb. Although his level of play has not
dropped off, Wagner explained that "it affects how
hard we train him." Manic goal-scoring animal
Andrew Terker 'O6 was injured on Saturday with a
sprained ankle. "I won't be 100 percent on Friday, but
I am definitely going to get out and play," Terker said.
Regardless of the outcome of Friday's game, this
season has been a major step forward for a program
on the rise. "The plan is to continue to improve the
program every year," Wagner said. "Ultimately
there's no question that being a Hopkins-level program is something I want to do."
Terker explained that this season's success "is a lot
more than we expected at the beginning of the year."
Elllison agreed, expressing his excitement about the
team's performance so far and about the possibilities
that exist for the Garnet. "It's been pretty awesome,"
Elkins said. "We never expected to do as well as we
have. We had high goals, but not this high."
For all students interested in attending Friday's
match, the Athletics Department will be providing a
fan bus which will leave from the field house at 4:30
p.m. Anyone interested can contact the department.
Haverford will not be in attendance.
