Karamazovs add second show
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
After today's Cooper Foundation-fundedperformance by the
Flying Karamazov Brothers sold
out faster than any other show
in recent memory, the
Karamazovs agreed to do a second performance.
The new performance, scheduled for 4:30 p.m., will precede
the original sold-out show, which
is at 8 p.m.

Susan Smythe, managing di-

rector of the Lang Performing

Arts Center, negotiated with the
performers to arrange the second show.
Those negotiations, said the
arts center's manager of operations Jim Murphy, were begun
after reservations were received
for 680 people, the theater's
maximum, but with only about
125 students receiving tickets.
"We held the reservation line
to after break to give students a

chance," Murphy said, "[but it]

didn't work very well."
The need for reservations was
announced in the Weekly News
before fall break, but students
apparently received Smythe's
reminder e-mail after the faculty
and staff did. Murphy said visitors from off-campus also filled
up many of the reservations.
Murphy said Smythe had technical trouble sending the e-mail

Currently under discussion by the Council on
Educational Policy is the institution of a new global studies requirement to be fulfilled by every
Swarthmore student before graduation, regardless
of high school experience.
Although no formal proposal yet exists, the
present conception comprises a menu of options,
any of which, when completed, would satisfy the
requirement. While still in the planning stage, the
menu as of now consists of three or four semesters of a foreign language, two or three semesters

of literature in a foreign language, three courses
addressing the same cultural or geographical region or a semester of study abroad.
As Professor Peter Collings explained, the purpose of the new requirement is to "make life more
glorious by sampling other riches."
The current debate is a continuation of the work
on the revision of graduation requirements begun by last year's CEP. In terms of foreign language, the framework the '99-'OO CEP inherited

Phoenix Staff
Tom Bettag's workday begins
at 9:30 in the morning and lasts
until 12:15 at night, he told student journalistsMonday. Bettag,
the executive producer ofABC's
"Nightline," said that when he
occasionally complains to his
wife about his schedule, she
scoffs.
"You know why you do that?"
she asks. "You love it."
Bettag, speaking to editors of
The Phoenix and The Daily Gazette as well as other student
writers over dinner Monday
night, told them that as professional journalists they would
have to work long hours
but
that the rewards would be incredible.
During his day-long visit to
campus as the Office of News
and Information's media fellow,
Bettag likened the demands of
news gathering to working in a
restaurant. "If you can wait
tables," he said, "you can be in
news." Both jobs require attention to detail and the ability to
handle "too much work."
At Columbia University's
graduate journalism school,
Bettag became so hateful of television that he almost dropped out
a move that almost certainly
would have resulted in his being
drafted.
"Rather than try it," he remembered a professor saying,
"you would quit and go get shot
by the Viet Cong."

like this committee that is trying to make a horse and produces

Another problem is that the
advancement of new production
technology is outpacing electronic journalists' skill in using
it. Technicians, he said, can create "new boxes," but they are all
empty. "We're desperate for content providers."
Although television's flaws
distress him, they also inspire
Bettag to work harder. "I can
abandon it and leave it to the
hucksters," he said, "or I can try

Many people in journalism are

"Nightline" broadcast ends,
Bettag said he is happy if he can

Swatties still against Ville changes
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
"Hotel Swarthmore?! Please!,"
scoffed Paul Arandia 'OO when told
about the renovations proposed for the
Ville. Arandia's original response
"What renovations?"
was echoed by
most of the students interviewed.
In general, students remain uninformed about, and even uninterested in,
the long-term strategy recently developed to revitalize the Ville. This lack of
involvement is unsurprising, however,
as those charged with formulating the
plan made few efforts to seek out and
incorporate student opinion.
The revitalization effort is delineated
in a 34-point proposal, with the inn referred to by Arandia as its cornerstone.
He is not alone in his criticism; the inn
was the main point of contention for almost everyone interviewed. Arandia
based his disapproval on a supposition
that it would only exacerbate the problems that already plague the parking
situation on campus. Renee Witlen 'O2
voiced a similar complaint, saying that
there is not enough need for an inn to
warrant the reallocation of so much
land.

Jason Caldwell 'Ol objected even more
emphatically. "I think [an inn] is a really
bad idea," he said. "It is a violation of campus space."
Regarding the other points of the proposal, which involve the introduction of
new stores and other changes in the town
itself, students were more positive. "That
would be very groovy," said Chris Fanjul
'OO in response to a description of these
renovations.
Arandia statedthat the Ville could benefit from more businesses catering to students, a sentiment repeated by Abigail
Stewart-Teitelbaum 'Ol, who views Sugarplums, the new ice-cream and candy
shop, as a start in that direction. She described the Swarthmore student body as
a captive audience that the Ville should
take advantage of, and suggested, in that
vein, the construction of a single-screen
movie theatre.
Only one student interviewed regarded
the entire concept of revitalization negatively. JeffLevine 'OO called the proposed
renovations "unnecessary." For Levine,
the Ville is fine just the way it is now. "The
Ville doesn't need to be the trendy mall
people want it to be," he said. "I like [the
Ville] quaint and homey, not futuristic and
updated."

SBC decides on sound equipment, Halcyon yearbook
By

Deirdre Conner

Phoenix Staff

Taking action on two pressing
issues, the Student Budget Com-

mittee allocated money for the
purchase of new sound equipment and for the payment of a
staff for the Halcyon in a meeting on Oct. 24. The two decisions

constituted

major action on the
part of the committee involving
what some students viewed as a
large amount of money.
$22,000 was allocated for the
purchase of new sound equipment for Upper Tarble and Olde
Club to replace what has been
stolen or damaged over the
years.

Though some have balked at
the sum, in the meantime more
money is being spent to rent
equipment needed to accommodate acts brought to campus.
"I estimate that the rental expenditure will top $2,000 by the
end of the semester," said Nick
Kourtides, production intern in
the Lang Performing Arts Center.

The new system will be designed by Kourtides, to be easy
to use and difficult to steal. The
speakers will be mounted to the
ceiling, so they don't have to be
moved and will be more secure.
These major improvements
should allow the college to accommodate more complicated

and better-known musical acts,
and improve parties on campus.
"Parties are of course a very
important part of the weekend
social scene here," said Josh
Bess, SBC Treasurer. "This
equipment will make them
easier to plan, of better quality
overall and cheaper in the long
run."
However, Kourtides warns
against seeing immediate
changes.
"Don't expect to see anything
too dramatic until next semester," he said.
Also, the SBC, in partnership
with the senior class officers,
decided to allot $6,000 for the
Halcyon, including supplies and

The Halcyon yearbook so far
does not have a staff, and last
year's Halcyon was not finished
until last week, according to
Hugh Weber, senior class president. Since there were no editors chosen last year, the responsibility of the Halcyon was left
to the senior class officers and
the SBC. These two groups will
evaluate the applications for the

editors-in-chief, who will in turn
hire the rest of the staff.
"There's a lot of people with
great ideas and desire," Weber
said. "I was pleasantly surprised
that there was a lot of student
support for putting [the Halcyon] together."
The SBC also approved an initial allocation of $30,000 for the
actual publishing costs.
"While the SBC thinks the Halcyon is important to students on
campus," Bess said, "it also
thinks that the book has a lifeand
existence beyond current students, and is, in many ways, woven into the fabric of the history
of Swarthmore College."

Admissions committee splits College Dems meet candidate
into faculty, student groups
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Tuesday night, Student Council heard from members of the new student admissions committee who reported on the split from the faculty's admissions committee.
The Committee on Faculty Procedures (CoFP) voted to split the old admissions
committee, which advises the admissions office, into two committees, one for students and one for faculty.
Anne Hoang 'O2 and Tony Loew 'O2, two members of the old committee and now
two of the three students on the new student admissions committee, received a letter
from Provost Jennie Keith last month explaining the CoFP's decision. The Phoenix
was unable to obtain a copy of that letter or meet with Keith by last night.
Student Budget Committee Treasurer JoshBess 'OO noted that part of the reason
for the split was privacy reasons.
"They use individual examples to elucidate individual points," he explained to Student Council.
But members of the council found that confusing. "I don't see why that would cause
a split," said new Curriculum Committee representative Mike Spiegel 'O3.
"The larger issue is that this decision was made by [the CoFP] without consulting
really any students," said co-chair Jared Solomon 'Ol.
Social Affairs Committee representative Dave Thomas 'O2 said he was inclined to
agree with the faculty's decision in this case because of confidentiality, but would
draw the line in the future. "It's a very bad precedent to set," he said.
"I think it's just a lack of faith in us on their part," said Hoang.
If the faculty does not reconsider its decision, Student Council needs to appoint
four new members to the student committee. In addition to Hoang and Loew, Joey
Genereux 'Ol is also already a member.

Diploma wording changed
After much discussion, 'Year of Our Lord' removed

Swarthmore graduates will

now re-

ceive diplomas with thereference to "our
Lord" deleted.
The faculty, meeting on Oct. 8, chose to
change the wording to "the first day of
June in the year two thousand." By tradition, the wording as always been as with
this year's diplomas
"this first day of
sixth month in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine."
After four student polls and long camPus debate, the issue has finally been

settled.
The Curriculum Committee recom-

mended that the change shouldtake place
because the religious reference to "our
t-ord" is no longer appropriate sincemany
or those who either award or receive the
diploma come from different religious
backgrounds.

The most frequent arguments against
the change were based mostly on a wish
not to abandon the college tradition or on
a wish not to be perceived as rejecting
Quaker heritage or the Christian faith
more generally.
However, the decision did not come
about so easily. Three polls taken by Student Council last spring were inconsistent. The first and the last one favored
the change by a slim margin, while in the
second one there was a small majority for
retaining the old wording. The poll conducted by The Phoenix last April, however, was clearly in favor of changing.
Eighty students were for the change, 33
were against and 17 were undecided.
Many peer schools have also omitted
the words "of our Lord" from their diploma. Almost all of those who retain the
wording, however, continue to write the
entire diploma in Latin.

Two spec weekends unified
By Drew Adams
Phoenix Staff
This April's accepted students' weekend will have a distinctly different structure. After years of having a general program and a distinct, concurrent one for
minorities, the Admissions Office has
decided to unify the two.
This does not mean, however, that special activities are not being planned for
this year's accepted minority students.
Tracy Matthews, associate dean of admissions and coordinator for student of
color recruitment, said, "Our commitment to bringing students of color to
Swarthmore remains intact."
As evidence of that, she predicted that
no changes would be made to the regular
series of activities targeted at
minorities.These include the annual luncheon with faculty, panel discussions featuring recent minority alumni, and various parties, programs, and activities
sponsored by the various minority support groups on campus.
Since the Admissions Office began inviting all accepted students to visit the
campus roughly 10 years ago, the program for students of color has been distinct from the general program. This division was believed to increase minority
students' awareness of the minority
groups on campus and heighten their perception of how minority students contribute to campus life.
Recently, though, a number of students
and parents
of all ethnic groups began complaining that splitting the program was counterproductive. Especially
persuasive in the decision to condense the
weekend, Matthews said, were statements by minority students who "felt
uncomfortable being targeted solely as
minority students."

Matthews also noted that the Admissions Office has been aware of this kind
of feedback over the past several years.
"There's been a continuous conversation
on how to handle [admitted students'
weekend]," she said.
Students around campus expressed at
best tentative approval of this move.Jeff
Wu 'Ol, Co-President of the Swarthmore
Asian Organization, said he was at first
"really upset" when he heard about the
changes, but, after learning that no activities aimed at accepted students of
color were being cut, decided the change
"makes sense
the reasons for not having it are good ones." However, Wu also
would have "preferred more minor
changes" and more communication with
admissions prior to the decision.
While the Diversity Coalition has no official opinion on the subject, Gloria Chan
'O2, a steering committee member, expressed several criticisms of the move."A
lot of people are looking for a distinct minority community," she commented. By
condensing the minority weekend into the
general weekend, Admissions is doing a
less effective job of exposing prospectives
to that community, she said.
While acknowledging the logic that
prompted the move, she also worried that
the unified weekend would "bring on a
lot of awkwardness" for students of
color.Forcing minority students to branch
off from the rest of the accepted students
to attend events intended for a specific
ethnic group would definitely put minority students in a delicate situation.
Chan proposed that accepted students
of color at least be given an extra day on
campus:"it's a matter of being comfortable, and if there was an extra day for
minority students to go to [support group]
meetings, there would be less awkwardness."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Some cultures demand parking
To the Editor:
Nick Attanasio's Op-Ed on parking last
week (Opinions, pg. 8) was perceptive and
accurate. I come from the automotive capital of the world, a region where cars carry
incredible symbolic, economicand social importance. Yet the College denied me a parking permit, even though I am doing research
for a professor at off-campus archives that
can only be reached by car. I was told that

Karamazovs' kindness
In a time when Ricky Martin's hips and record-label fat cats dominate the
entertainment industry, it's reassuring to know that nuts like the Flying
Karamazovs still exist in show business.
It's remarkable that performers of their caliber would come to Swarthmore.
What's more amazing, however, is the fact that the famous jugglers were agreeable to a Friday afternoon performance after hearing their evening show sold
out less than two hours after reservations were opened to students.
Or perhaps the reason we're singing theFlying Karamazovs' praises is the fact
that they managed to right what many students perceived as a grievous wrong.
Last Saturday morning we received an e-mail from LPAC Managing Director Susan Smythe informing students of the availability of Flying Karamazovs'
tickets. We went to lunch, and by the time we had returned, Smythe had sent
out another e-mail announcing the performance was sold out.
It wasn't the fact that the show was sold-out that had students feeling
wronged, but the fact that less than 25 percent of the tickets went to students,
and for a student-organized show, nonetheless.
Furthermore, due to e-mail delays, students didn't have a fair shot at the
tickets; instead, faculty, staff and Swarthmore residents got most of the seats.
Fortunately, in a demonstration of all that is good about the entertainment
industry, the administration and angry students, Smythe, prompted by Student
Council, negotiated to have theFlying Karamazovs perform an additional show.
So when you walk into Pearson-Hall Theater Friday afternoon, be sure to
give the Flying Karamazovs, as well as Smythe and Student Council, an extra
round of applause.

4.0s for all? Think twice, buddy
By Justin Hastings
The Daily Princetonian (Princeton U.)
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J.
In its ongoing fight for Truth, Justice and the American Way, and against the insipid influences
of grade inflation, the University recently
released a report summarizing its investigations into the grading practices of all the
academic departments. It also suggested
several new policies to curtail grade inflation, among them the elimination of the A+
in favor of the ‘A with Distinction,’ or A*,
and working with peer institutions to combat grade inflation. Although the University
is well-intentioned, its approach is too incremental and fails to address the real problems involved.
Oneof the University’s arguments against
the A+ is its inequality. Some departments
give the A+ profusely, while others are
afraid to touchit. The University claims that
this puts students who are in tougher departments at a disadvantage when it comes to
awards. In the sciences and engineering,

A+ upon A+. But in the social sciences and
humanities, where no paper or test is ever
perfect, the top student wouldn't even necessarily get an A. So there is some merit to
the University's claims.
The problem then is not with the A+ as a
mark of superior work. Rather, the problem
is with the lack of standardization of grading among the departments. Just because the
A+ is eliminated and replaced with another
grade with a 4.0 weighting does not mean
that the problem of some departments being easier graders will go away. Even an attached explanation of the grade will not
change the inherent inequity of the system.
Top science and engineering students will
continue to get A*s and As while top humanities and social science students continue to

GUEST COLUMN

1

In the past several years Student Council has been, for lack of a better
expression, going through a slump. Resignation after resignation hit the
headlines. Even the excuses were getting cliched: "I don't feel that I could
continue to perform my duties in a way that does the community justice;" "I
lost faith in Student Council;" "I needed to shuffle my priorities" and so on.
But with the injection of fresh blood late last semester and this semester,
Student Council has a new look. We have felt their concrete impact already
two new pinball machines, a new Genuardi's run. The new Council seems
truly determined to make a difference this time around.
And it also shows in their ongoing efforts to revitalize student government at
Swarthmore, most recently a preliminary proposal to amend the constitution to
create a new structure of government not unlike our national government.
The current proposal will call for a new division of labor between an
executive branch, consisting of president, vice president and secretarytreasurer, and a senate, consisting of student-elected representatives based
on dorm. The members of the executive branch will instead attend college
committee meetings. The senate will be led by a speaker, who may or may
not operate as part of the executive branch. The executive branch will run
for office in campus-wide elections on the same ticket.
We believe this new proposal, with a few improvements, will be a crucial
first step towards rekindling student government.
A separate and stronger executive branch is a potent innovation not
because of its formal powers, as in real life, but rather as a result of its even
more powerful informal powers. In this case, the executive branch does not
even have the power to issue unilateral executive orders.
The president and the executive branch will be the most visible embodiment
of student government on campus. And with a higher profile comes greater
accountability. Students will know who to go to instinctively when they have a
complaint; they will also know who to blame right away when things go wrong.
Most importantly, a separate executive branch will allow a dedicated
individual or groups of individuals to articulate, a clear vision for student
governance and mobilize the resources to achieve that vision.
A powerful personality could galvanize the entire campus and inspire it to
activism
"the power of persuasion," presidential scholar Richard Neustadt
called it but until now no mechanism existed through which this could occur.
And with the introduction of a competitive election process for the executive branch, complete with debates and speeches, we will get higher quality
officials
officials who are more responsible. After all, the people who are
willing to tackle such a momentous task must be somewhat committed.
The proposal to create constituents based on dorms will tie the welfare of
students directly to the performance of their student representatives,
which is also a sure way to improve the quality of student governance.
But as the proposal is in its early stages, many potential pitfalls do exist.
For example, asking the executive branch to attend every single meeting
might be too much to ask of even the super-Swattie. Perhaps like the federal
executive branch, our executives would also be allowed to form a cabinet of
officials specializing in different areas.
Still, we believe the momentum for change can very much be felt, and we
applaud Student Council for rising above the ashes.

first, I read about the almost comically
urprising mass meeting arranged beween two huge groups of Christians—>ne consisting of followers of the antiray Christian conservative leader Jerry
?alwell, and the other made up of gay
eligious Christians. Second, I saw the
novie "American Beauty."
Falwell was much maligned in gay

living in a world of unmitigated hostil-

ity toward gays and lesbians, and the violence of homophobia feels incredibly
anonymous and threatening. But having
a window onto the mind of a prominent
homophobe reveals the ways in which,
for all its power to harm, homophobia
need not always be scary. People profess
homophobic views out of a position of
fear, not strength. Although it is sup-

ported by powerful cultural forces, homophobia is fundamentally irrational,
and can be unlearned.
Indeed, one straight first-year student
spoke eloquently at the vigil last week
about how his parents reacted to his gay
roommate. Research has shown that getting to know even one gay person can significantly change people's attitudes toward queers. And as more and more
young people come out of the closet,
more teenagers have gay friends, classmates, and neighbors—a powerful
counter to the influence of parents who
more often than not are fairly homophobic themselves.
"American Beauty," I think, also reflects some ways in which US culture really is changing. It's not at all a "gay
movie," and in fact it's a movie about
mainstream U.S. culture, but in some
ways it has homosexuality at its center.
It features a conventional nuclear family in the suburbs, but their neighbors on
one side are an upstanding gay male
couple, and on the other side is a raging
homophobic Marine.
Gayness comes up time and again in
the movie. The Marine's son, quite marvelously, does not appear to have imbibed the sins of the father. In fact, when
the father tries to beat him up, the son
responds not with violence but by ridiculing his father: he tells him that indeed
he has been very sexually active with

men.
The key thing here is that it's not true;
the boy isn't gay, but neither is he homophobic. This young character is a heterosexual, white male kid, who has almost no countervailing pressures that
would allow him to resist the homophobia ofhis father. Yet he does resist it, and
even unpacks and deflates it. His response to his father is a kind of
education.Then, there's more to be said
about the homophobic father. I don't
want to give too much away, but suffice
it to say that "American Beauty," like the
bizarre evolution of Jerry Falwell's
views, indicates there's more to homophobia than meets the eye. It's scary,
but it's not monolithic or immutable.

Well, here it is, folks.

I know, you've been patient, and, admittedly, I've teased you a little bit, but now
it's here (wait for it...): the Common Courtesy Column, wherein I, resident hermit,
complain about how people act on campus, and you laugh, thinking I'm not serious. I, on the other hand, am very serious, and one day, one sweet, sweet day,
you shall understand. But enough. I have
dallied long.
Those of you unfamiliar with this type
of column, freshmen mostly, though I
like to think readership grows by leaps
will find it, I hope, rather
and bounds
straightforward. I will complain that you
act like dogs, and you, thinking I don't actually mean you specifically, will laugh.
You will, of course, be wrong, but we all
make mistakes.
In place of the usual format, though, I
have decided to be a little more investigative. The complaints are easy enough
to write, but I want something more. So,
instead of writing that you laugh like a
hyena in Sharpies when something is only
mildly amusing, I will attempt to explain
why you laugh like a hyena in Sharpies
when something is only mildly amusing,
like the editorial page of The New York
Times, for example.
The big reason, I think, is that this
whole idea of "community," and "worthless quotation marks" as well, while
we're on the subject, has gone a little too
far. You see, we all like to think of each
other as friends, and the standard for behavior around friends is rather more relaxed than in other social situations, as I
can routinely observe in open Wharton
windows (two inductive leaps were required there; I won't feel bad if I lost
you). Thus, even when two students don't
personally know each other, they act as
if they do, not even considering that one
of them might in fact be an anti-social
lunatic.
So, I'm sure you're asking yourself,
what can I, only one person, do? The answer is, of course, nothing, but you should
still try. What we have is an ill-formed
standard of behavior. We act as if we are
all close family members, and that every
conversation, no matter how disgusting
or offensive it may be, is for community
consumption.
I would like, therefore, to propose a new
standard. It will, sadly, require a slight
alteration of College rules, but to everything there is a season. (Note: what follows is a modest proposal, a la Jonathan
Swift, and not a serious recommendation.
So no letters or dirty email. However, if
the administration actually decides to do
the following, I expect full credit.)
Here's what we do. Allow fighting.
Nothing serious, of course. Make it like
hockey: once one guy wins, the fight is
over. But what it would do is remind everyone to put at least something between
his body/mouth and mind. That way,
maybe there wouldn't be a group hug in
front of the tray conveyor in Sharpies,
and maybe there wouldn't be mass
Sharpies fraud if we knew that that short
but tough-looking guy would beat you
down if he caught you running past the
checker.
To some, alas, this may seem harsh. Too
Hobbesian for some, and from such a
statement we would know that they
should indeed be the next victim. But college, I believe, is a time for learning, and
from the look of it, book-larning ain't the
only kind yinz need. So onward, to a
brighter and more polite future, where
loud laughers, group huggers, PDA-ers,
and even misanthropic hermits can live
together in peace.

CEP proposal

29 oct. 1999

Swat's pass-fail policy needs revision
ByTaliaWeiner
For The Phoenix
The Swarthmore College Bulletin

states that "students may exercise the
option to take up to four . .. courses for

Credit/No Credit by informing the
Registrar's Office within the first two
weeks of the term in which the course is
taken" (69-70). This at first appears to be
a generous policy, and one which supports
the spirit of learning for learning's sake.
However, the absurd set of rules governing the usage and reversal of a Credit/No
Credit (C/NC) class indicates that our administration wishes to make the exercise
of this option difficult and punitive for
students.
A class must be declared C/NC within
the first two weeks of the semester,
known as the "add-drop" period. This is
the time in which students are able to
make changes in their schedules, and are
encouraged to attend many more than
four courses before deciding which ones
to keep.
A student who is taking a course in a
subject which interests her but with which
she is completely unfamiliarwill probably
not have had the opportunity, within the
first two weeks, to gauge her own level of
performance in the course, muchless obtain feedback from the professor. Often,
there is not a written assignment given
during this time period and when there is,
it is usually returned to students later in
the semester. In classes which only meet

Nebulous, illogical, and fundamentally
misguided, the Council on Educational
Policy's (CEP) new foreign language requirement proposal is threatening to burdenSwarthmore students with yet another,
more stringent academic obligation.
The proposal, made last year, is still
being concocted, brewing somewhere in
the illogical depths of the CEP, a group
comprised of six professors, three students, President Al Bloom, and Provost
Jenny Keith. The idea, as it stands now,
is to replace the current language requirement three years in high school,
a year at Swarthmore, or a SAT II score
of 600
with a three-tiered plan.
Currently, part of the hodgepodge CEP
proposal is to have Swarthmore students
opt for one of the following for their foreign language requirement: study abroad
anywhere for one term; three or possibly
four semesters of a foreign language (entry level language and upper level literature classes may be weighed differently);
or three classes taught in English about a
different regional area. What will become
of high school classes, AP credit and SAT
II credit is still being debated.
Only the justification behind the new
language requirement is more confusing
than the proposal itself. The CEP feels
that under the current requirement students fail to reach the desired level offluency, but moreover that they are currently insufficiently prepared for the globalized nature of the worldand that they

C/NC for a portion of the semester. If the
rule is meant to punish students for choosing unwisely in the first place, then it reflects the problem of two weeks not being enough time.
I do not thinkthat extended deadlines or
even the elimination of the above rule are
what is needed to fix the problems in the
C/NC policy. Instead, our administration
ought to reexamine the rationale behind
C/NC and figure out why they simultaneously allow students to take four classes
for C/NC and punish them for doing so.
I suggest that there should be no

gamble involved in taking a class for
C/NC. Since letter grades are reported
even for C/NC courses, there is no reason
why a student shouldn’tbe able to put forwardher best effort in a challenging class
and then decide after seeing her final
grade whether she would rather have it
appear as simply C/NC. While sometimes
a student designates a course as C/NC because he knows he does not want to take
it seriously, there are other instances in
which a student uses C/NC as an opportunity to study something difficult for him
without the threat of a poor letter grade.
I have heard many students talk about
situations such as this, complaining that
they actually spent the most time on their
C/NC class, or that had they been able to
wait until the end of the semester they
would have realized that they actually
wanted a letter grade in their C/NC class.
If Swarthmore is to have a Credit/No
Credit policy, we should not doit halfway,

the policy by incorporating guesswork

wise disagreeing groups.
People seem to justify their intolerance
of others either by saying that
unaccepting people are mean or ignorant.
"Mean unaccepting people are criminals!
They have committed crimes against the
innocent by not respecting their views,
and they deserve to be punished in a manner fitting their crime," they say, or, "Ignorant unaccepting people simply do not
know any better. They have been raised
in an inferior social environmentthat has
not allowed them to fully develop as a
personand realize the truththat complete
acceptance is the way to go."
I have a hard time condemning mean
unaccepting people because intolerance
seems to be a personality trait shared by
a large portion of the population. In fact,
I think people prove this fact every time
they instinctively shunpeople they do not
agree with. People have value systems
that frequently conflict with other value
systems, and invariably people disagree
over differing ideas. Individuals decide
that their ideas, at least some of them, are
better than others' ideasbecause they are
operating from a necessarily limited
knowledge base.
I also have a hard time condemning ignorant unaccepting people because I can-

Grade inflation all about image
comers. These expectations are what hit
Princeton students hardest in the rush
to compete for jobs and grad school
openings.
If grade deflation must be done, it
must be done radically. Grades should
be cut across the board so drastically
that in the beginning students are
screaming for mercy. C should be the
average grade, and As should be reserved only for the geniuses among us.
Simultaneously, the University must
spread the news, perhaps even arranging a front page New York Times story.
Princeton must obtain a reputation for
being a hard grader, even to the point of
being notorious. This tactic does work.
Students from Swarthmore, Reed and
MIT, three schools renowned for their
extremely harsh grading, are at no disadvantage when it comes to competition
with other studentsbecause their schools
have such a reputation. So should it be
with Princeton. By standardizing grades
across departments and then dropping
them precipitously with fanfare,
Princeton can finally kick its obsession
with grade inflation and actually get
around to its primary business of teaching.

The stand against the

person’s conception of morality is better

or worse than my own? As long as an in
dividual does not physically impinge on
me, I am perfectly willing to give him any

goes, because I may be wrong. If moral

in the same manner as other types of conflicts, as long as both sides respect the

The stand against the unaccepting

Browse through any popular college guide and you will inevitably come
across this all-important category: student-teacher ratio. The lower the student-teacher ratio, the common
line of reasoning goes, the more attention each teacher
can devote to each student, thebetter the quality ofteaching, and the better the student academic experience.
In the age of rational, scientific thinking, we often find ourselves
obsessively trying to find order and meaning in the world by quantifying compressing, condensing and synthesizing every bit of information we uncover.
,

The college application process is no exception. Recent years has seen the
explosion of literature that provides detailed quantitative data for every college in the nation. The U.S. News and World Report has taken the rationalization process a step further, creating a pecking order of its own.
But in our fanatic drive to make sense out of everything, we are glossing over or
simply eliminating key information that cannot be reduced to mere statistics, and in
the process, oversimplifying, perhaps even misrepresenting the actual reality. What
exactly does it mean to be the number one college in the United States? The formula
by which the U.S. News rankings is derived is so complex that they don't even bother
to explain it.
More often than not, at the end of the day, when all the information has been thoroughly
processed, the numbers do not tell us much.
A low student-teacher ratio, after all, does not automatically make for a good academic
environment. But good teachers do. In the end, it is the people who constitute the numbers
that make the difference, not the numbers themselves. Swarthmore is the remarkable academy it is because of the people who do the teaching.
This week the In-depth section honors five of these individuals, who, according to a student vote, represent the best that Swarthmore has to offer. What all of them have in common,
our reporting revealed, is their continuing desire to make the learning process more accessible, relevant and productive for each and every one of their students.

A total of 270 ballots were collected. In each ballot students were allowed up to three votes. Each
student could only cast one ballot. The survey, again, is not meant to be scientific and does contain
certain biases. The freshmen have only been exposed to a limited number of professors. The survey is
obviously biased against newcomers who may be very good teachers, but simply haven't been around
long enough to establish a reputation. It is also biased against departments with fewer students, such
as the Engineering Department, which boasts many fine teachers, our survey reveals. But current
student opinion is reflected in the results.
The objective of this report is to highlight the characteristics of quality teaching that elude statistics
such as the student-teacher ratio, through telling the stories of the professors who embody these traits.
It is not our intention to rank the teachers of Swarthmore in any way. In keeping with that goal, the
final results of the vote will not be published. The top five professors, who are profiled here, are not
ranked.

Asked what makes political science professor Kenneth
Sharpe their pick as one of their favorite professors at
Swarthmore, students tend to respond with hyperbole.
"His warmth, knowledge, and personality permeate the
room as soon as he walks in," says Bohee Yoon 'Ol.
"Ken is an amazing professor, but more than that, he emanates 'the good,' 'the just' like no other that I've met," asserts Dann Naseemullah 'O2.
But the effusive praise is not reserved solely for Sharpe's
character. Throughout their enthusiastic remarks, students
sound one theme repeatedly: that Sharpe encourages them
to form their own opinions of the theory they study, and
examine the foundations of theory upon which they base
their own lives. And it is his emphasis on independent thinking and relevance that distinguishes Sharpe from the pack.
In a phone interview, Sharpe exlains that he is principally interested in relating the classroom to life. "I want
students to be able to connect some of the important ideas
about human nature, and life, and politics...to their own lives,
as citizens, parents, human beings," Sharpe says.
Students'
lives and politics
have
changed since
Sharpe first began teaching at
Swarthmore in
1973. The students that attendedSharpe's
classes 25 years
ago came from
families struggling with a difficult economy,

the
through
years, Sharpe
that
Swarthmore
students have remained passionate about learning.
This passion is helpful to students as they read through
his syllabi, which are known to be intense. In his Introduction to Political Theory class, readings thus far this year
have spanned Plato to Adam Smith, Hobbes to MiltonFriedman, and tackled such issues as human knowledge versus
belief, the use and abuse of power, and the essential qualities of human nature. A typical alignment for the twiceweekly class includes reading 50 to 100 pages of theory and
considering a dozen discussion questions before class, not
to mention writing 5 papers before the close of the semester.

Still, Sharpe's students say their efforts are paying off.
"You will work hard," says Kathryn Tong 'Ol, "but in the
end it is worth it because you learn so much."
Students describe a class environment where the ideas
brought up by their readings are discussed, pulled apart,
and put in opposition with one another in a dialectical conversation which Sharpe refrains from dominating.
"Professor Sharpe can remember every comment made
during class, who made the comment, and somehow tie all
the comments together by the end of class," says Yoon.

We are defined by the things we carry, an author once
said. If this saying holds true at all, then Prof. Don
Shimamoto is at the same time a serious academic and a
fun-loving jokester. In one corner of Prof. Shimamoto's office one can find mathematics textbooks of all shapes and
sizes; another corner is inundated with a breathtaking array of toys and little gadgets ranging from the übiquitous
Barney to a squealing pig.
And a casual conversation with Prof. Shimamoto reveals
that he is indeed the person that the contents of his office
reflect.
It is precisely his familiarity with and love and mastery
of mathematics, combined with a great sense of humor and
unparalleled creativity, that single him out as one of the
most well-liked, admired professors at Swarthmore.

Richard Schuldenfrei
By Mimi Hanaoka
Phoenix Staff
"Keep your eyes on the prize," Richard Schuldenfrei, Professor of Philosophy,
constantly exhorts his students. He wants his students to focus on the truly important questions, not only within the context of his classroom, but also in quotidian

life.
And it is Schuldenfrei's dedication to integrate the academic aspect of philosophy with the daily lives ofhis students that makes him one of the most admired and
well-known professors on campus.
Currently in his 33 rd year of teaching at Swarthmore, Schuldenfrei is still bubbling with enthusiasm about what he does. His speech, while articulate, is neither
finely calibrated nor evenly metered rather, it spurts forth in spirited outbursts
of genuine excitement. "I like teaching more than I ever did before," he says energetically, and I'm not sure why. I'm still interested in the elementary problems
that I teach, and I'm still learning."
Schuldenfrei chose to pursue graduate studies in philosophy after graduating
from UPenn in 1962 because he felt that other fields failed to address adequately a
concern of central importance to him "how are we to live our lives."
For Schuldenfrei, despite the popular perception of the subject, philosophy was
appealing precisely because of its practical relevance.
Even to this day, he believes that his main
mission as a philosophy professor is to equip
his students with the tools to understand
their own lives better. If there's one thing
that he wants his students to come away
with after taking his class, itis "how to make
use of philosophical ideas to illuminate their
daily lives not as a recipe for life, but to
make those lives more meaningful by putting things in perspective."
And according to his students, he seems
to be doing a great job of just that. "His is
the class in which it's the easiest for me to
understand how to relate this to the rest of
my life," says Jessica Pulver 'O2.
"

T Hn

Schuldenfrei succeeds as a teacher
also because of his unique ability to
make ostensibly obscure philosophical
ideas highly relevant to his students,
year after year."What
makes
Schuldenfrei a great professor is that
after having covered the same materialfor 20 years, he can use thekids in
his intro level class to bring out the
questions that he's been dealing with
his whole life," says Leigh Nolan
'OO."He can convey his passion and
work off students' simple and complex
questions."
"What I got from his class was one
person's growth and progress through
great philosophical questions," Nolan
continues, "more than the nuts and bolts of philosophy, which I can get later."
With over three decades of teaching experience under his belt, Schuldenfrei has
honed his teaching style to perfection. He is highly engaging but never imposing.
"He engages people when he talks to them, and he leads you towards what he's
thinking without forcing it down your throat," observes Judy Chen 'O2."He lets
you think for yourself."
Pulver echoes her sentiments. "Schuldenfrei elicits answers without making
people feel on the spot," she says.
Schuldenfrei is also widely recognized as one of the most dynamic and charismatic lecturers at Swarthmore. "He has a very easy and inviting wit which he
throws at anything that he can," says Andrew Bryce 'OO, a philosophy major.
"I loved sitting in class and watching his personality in action," recalls Nolan.
And as with any of the best teachers, Schuldenfrei relishes his job the most
when he sees that he has truly made a difference. His greatest award comes, says
Schuldenfrei, "when former students, who are now out there leading very productive lives, think back on what they learned in my class as something that helped
them live their lives they way they do."

Italian-American with a graying beard and expanding midsection, John (never call him Prof. Boccio) is in his office
most any day, at most any hour.
Now in his thirty-third year at Swarthmore, Boccio is
everything you'd expect from a veteran teacher caring,
patient, and thorough and so much more. It is hard to
believe that the fossil of the Physics and Astronomy Department is also the most techno-savvy and cutting-edge.
It is also hard to believe that, for all his years, he is one of
the least jaded physicists you will ever meet.
But it is precisely his drive to stay current and to continually relearn and adapt, qualities reflected in Boccio as
technophile and as teacher, that makes him such an engaging and enjoyable professor, and one of Swarthmore's favorites.
Born in 1940 in an Italian/Jewish Brooklyn neighborhood,
Boccio was tracked from an early age as a special talent.
He traveled two hours each way from his home (then in
Queens) to Brooklyn Technical High School. It was there
thatBoccio discovered his calling in life.
"When I took Physics the first time in high school is also
when I decided to be a teacher," says Boccio. "My Physics
teacher in high school was terrible. I felt, even then, 'I can
do this stuff
better than he
can.'"
Unprepared
to leave behind
life in the city,
Boccio
attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute,
where he received a B.S. in
Physics. He
then
went
to
straight
Cornell University, finishing his Ph.D. in
Theoretical

ematical aptitude, the defining quality
of Shimamoto
as a teacher is
not his knowlbut
edge,
rather an almost fanatical
desire to make
mathematics
fun and interesting for everyone.
Shimamato's
teaching style
is highly meticulous. His lectures are characterized by students as "well-structured," "careful" and "consistent."
But as long as he does not compromise the integrity of
his teaching, Shimamoto is perfectly willing to go all out to
make mathematics as entertaining as possible.
Richard Aleong 'Ol cites his ability to "inject humor into
the class and problem sets." Godzilla, for example, is a frequent protagonist in his assignments.
There was the time when he tried to explain graph theory
by comparing it to squeezing a fish into the hole of a bowling ball. Or the time when he brought Fruitie Flakes for the
entire class before the Superbowl, "complete with bowls,
spoons and milk," recalls Lisa Larrimore 'O2. One year right
before Mardi Gras he gave each student a mask and pancakes along with their homework assignments.
And his innovative efforts have obviously paid off. Aleong
accorded Shimamoto perhaps the greatest honor a student
can bestow upon a professor. He is "the first maths professor that has reliably kept [him] awake in class," Aleong says.

Professor of Biology Amy Cheng Vollmer keeps a letter
pinned to the bulletin board in her office on the third floor
of Martin. The letter, sent to Vollmer by an Honors examiner, reads in conclusion, "you really do have the world's
best job."
While acknowledging that there are days when she doesn't
relish coming to work, Vollmer truly believes that she is in
the best employment situation possible. And it is precisely
Vollmer's unbridled passion for teaching and her students
that made her the outstanding teacher she is.
Vollmer's interest in the profession stems partly from her
first-hand experience with the tremendous difference that
good teaching can make. Throughout her entire career, she,
too, has been encouraged and prodded along by caring and
enlightening mentors.
For instance, there was the seventh grade biology teacher.
"She was so exciting, so enthusiastic," Vollmerrecalls. And
a "phenomenal"
seventh grade
math teacher
boosted
Vollmer's academic self-esteem.

I

Vollmer's parents, also chemists, very early
on encouraged
her to explore
"the investigative part of life."
Her biochemistry instructor
at Rice University,
Prof.

Kathleen

Swarthmore,
Boccio has always been on
the cutting
edge of tech-'
nology. In the
19705,
he
helped study
the material
base for modern semiconductors. Then, from 1987 to 1993, he was the college's firs
Director of Academic Computing. Much of today's technol
ogy infrastructure including the campus network, com
puting labs, file-servers, free software, and free printing
was developed by Boccio.
But even during his stint as an administrator, Boccio
taught one class a semester. "I couldn't stop teaching," he
recalls. Without it, he said, he would have gone insane.
Boccio's intimacy with the learning process he contin
ues to explore new areas of physics after forty-plus years
carries over to the classroom. He does not necessarily com
municate the fanciest or the best way to do physics, bu
rather the way that is most beneficial to students. For ex
ample,.he will often hammer a class with details but then
retreat to discuss the implications.
He believes in giving students as much time as they neet
on their own and with the professor. As a case in point, thi
semester he has over forty office hours per week.
Students seem to appreciate John's teaching methods anc
style. They stress both his thoroughness and his laid-bacl
attitude, which combine to make even the most dreaded anc
difficult material easier to digest.
"To this day I do not feel that I have ever learned a sub
ject more completely than under his guidance," says Amy
Reighard 'Ol.
John vows that, even after all these years, "teaching is
never a job; it's exciting."
"I love being in the classroom," he says. "I love being
able to find new ways to teach students physics."

Vollmer

Mathews, showed her what good science teaching means.
Even now, Vollmer insists, "[Mathews] is my professional
role model... She loves teaching."
Vollmer believes that she became a scientist as a direct
result of the good teachers she encountered along the way,
a conclusion supported by empirical studies. According to
Vollmer, an American Association of University Women
report found that professional women scientists tend to have
a parent who was also a scientist or an influential science
teacher early in their education.
Inspired by a successful teaching assistantship at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she
earned her Ph.D., Vollmer decided to take the plunge into
teaching herself. After obtaining her degree in 1983 and
completing post-doctoral work at Stanford University,
Vollmer honed her teaching skills at Mills College in California for four years. She came to Swarthmore in 1989.
At Swarthmore, as her students confirm, Vollmer's love
for teaching has truly shone through, in her generous concern for her students and her willingness to teach
innovatively. Thirty-some years after a middle-school
teacher first sparked her interest in the sciences, Vollmer
is perpetuating the benign cycle, sowing the seeds of intellectual curiosity in the next generation of scientists.
"She's concerned with students, with what they think.
She's willing to spend extra time with them," says Judy Chen
'O2, who had Vollmer as a lecturer in Biology 1.
Vollmer is always willing to meet students where they're
at, according to sophomore Andrew Alderete, who did research with Vollmer last summer. "Although she's intimidating at first because she's so smart," says Alderete, "she
makes it her responsibility to help you understand the material and she takes a different approach if you don't understand it [initially]. You don't feel embarrassed when you go
to ask her questions."
Like Mathews, her own mentor, Vollmer is also setting an
example for aspiring female scientists on campus. "She's a
role model for women in science [at Swarthmore]. She's
very supportive," adds Tanya Wansom 'O2, who also worked

Indeed,

Vollmer feels

with her students that she
sends out an

to

dents of hers
she remains in contact with. "It's very rewarding hearing
from [former students] satisfied with their activities," she
explains.
But the most fulfilling part of her job, according to
Vollmer, is seeing her own efforts bear fruit over time.
"I like to see insecure, naive students, who [initially] experience set-backs and even failures in the
laboratory.. .blossom into confident, capable individuals who
go on to develop their own passions... even if they're not
necessarily in my area [of microbiology]," Vollmer says.
"It's rewarding to be part of a process that enables students to undergo maturation."
Upon learning that she was voted one of the favorite professors on campus, Vollmer immediately tries to downplay
the honor.
"I'm not in it for the popularity; I've made unpopular decisions before," she says, "I'm in it because I want to share
my passion [for] and enjoyment of science and biology. At
Swarthmore, I get to do that and get paid."
And after ten years of teaching courses ranging from introductory biology to honors seminars, Vollmer is here to
stay.

"I've found my niche here," she declares.

Halloween a
holiday for
great movies

By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff

Halloweenis my favorite holiday, hands
down. The leaves have changed and the
streets and the parties fill up with
werewolves, witches, goblins, mummies,
zombies, mermaids, martians, hobos,
punks, princesses, pirates, gangsters,
superheroes and the sheeted dead.
Halloween sanctions a coming up out
of ourselves, this playing at someone or
something that ain't got out face, and in
that way it is all at once innocentand ominous and tacky and very, very beautiful.
Tim Burton, director of "Batman" and
"Edward Scissorhands," says it like this:
"Masks in this country symbolize hiding,
but when I used to go to Halloween parties, wearing a mask was actually more
of a doorway, a way of expressing myself.
There is something about being hidden
that in some weird way helps you to be
more open because youfeel freer. People
would open up much more. They were
always a bit wilder, because something
about wearing a mask protected them."
In the dark of masks, disguise becomes a
kind of disclosure about ourselves.
And let's not discount the importance
of all that candy. Candy corn, sugar daddies, those Hershey's miniatures (has
anyone ever actually seen a full-size
Krackel bar? anyone? anywhere?),
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, marshmallows, gummy worms, Smarties, pixie
sticks, Blow-pops—all good, so long as
they didn't have any razor blades or rat
poison in them, which were the booby
traps in sweets our mothers always
warned us about. My parents, I remember, would spread our Halloween hauls
out upon the living table, scrutinizing
each Bazooka Joe for signs of tampering
or corruption.
So in commemoration of Halloween, I'd
like to present my first and last annual
"Mark's All Hallow's Eve, Terror American-style, Good Old-fashioned Scare-athon," featuring five flicks guaranteed to
frighten the bejeezus out of you. What I
like about the horror genre is what differentiates it from science fiction or fantasy: sci-fi asserts strange and wondrous
possibility on another plane, somewhere
else, in galaxies far far away, but horror
tells us that terrible trouble can happen
here, to you or to me. It gives us the monstrous in our everyday, the weird happenings beneath our beds or behind our closets or in the house next door.
On a less theoretical level, I know that
most people just advocate scary movies
like Chinese doctors talk up deer antler
velvet, as aphrodisiacs. My girlfriend
says that the psychological explanation
of why scary movies get folks all hot and
bothered is that these films tend to stimulate in us a kind ofadrenaline jitter offear
and anxiety, which we misrecognize as
arousal. I don't know about that, but what
I do know is that every teenage guy in
the Continental United States seems to
believe that protecting a girl from her
Blockbuster rental is a surefire way to
get into her pants. Me, I'm recommending these movies not just as the thing to
put a little bump back in your night but
also because hopefully they'll terrify you
out of a few years of toilet training.
One last thing. Purists may begrudge
me the absence among my suggestions
of any films made before about 1970
like, say, the great Frankensteins of
James Whale, or Alfred Hitchcock's
"Psycho," which I have seen many times
and love. Those people probably have lots
of other ideas but no weekly column in

Almost everything written about
the Flying Karamazov Brothers (this
article serves as a perfect example)
begins by stating that they are not
brothers (at least not to each other),
that they do not come from Russia
(though some have Russian ancestry), and that they cannot fly (disregarding airplane travel). As a general
practice, such negative definitions,
describing only what an object is not,
are to be scrupulously avoided. Yet
when speaking of the Karamazovs, it
is much easier to list what they are
not than to figure out what they are.
A seemingly obvious solution to
this dilemma would be to label the
Karamazovs Dmitri, Alexei, Pavel
and Ivan when they're on stage and
Paul Magid, Mark Ettinger, Tod
Kimball and Howard Patterson when
they're not as jugglers. That is, after all, what they do juggle. Yet the
term juggling cannot encompass the
variety of the Karamazovs' repertoire. Their performances, in which
sophomoric puns and literary allusions fly as rapidly as juggling pins,
seem at times like improv comedy,

Sol y Canto to play Nov. 5,6
By Nick Goodness
For The Phoenix

Sol y Canto performed will again perform before a standing-room-only audience in LPAC. It has been six years since
the talentedLatin music group performed
for the Swarthmore campus, but on Saturday, Nov. 6, at 8 p.m., the group will culminate two days of activities with a concert on the Lang Performing Arts Center
stage. Sol y Canto hopes to again perform
before The concert will include special
guest Alan Del Castillo.
"The concert and activities are a great
opportunity for the Swarthmore community to participate in the Latino culture,"
said Lupe Jimenez 'OO, senior class coordinator for HOLA.
Sol y Canto are known for theirrich and
natural harmonies and are regarded as
innovators in the modern Latin music
scene, integrating elements of Flamenco
and Afro-Caribbean dance into their performance.
The concert will be accompanied by an
education series that will allow Swatties
the opportunity to learn more aboutLatin
American culture through music. On Friday, Nov. 5, members of Sol y Canto will
be on hand to participate in a coffeehouse
with student performers at the Intercultural Center. This will be followed on Saturday by a master class in percussion at
noon in the Boyer Dance Studio and a participatory workshop exploring the roots of
Latin Music at 2 p.m. in the Troy Dance
Studio.
"Their music spans a widerange ofLatin
styles but is strongly influenced by African origins," Biology professor Timothy
Williams said. "The workshop on the roots
of Latin music is a great way to experience these diverse influences." Williams
helped organize the concert.

combined to develop an upbeat sound
that honors a rich Latino culture. The
group is headed by Rosi and Brian
Amador, both of whom are products of
a liberal arts education.
"It shows that your can take a Latino
background and a liberal arts degree
and become one of the top Latin instrumental ensembles in the nation," Williams said.
Rosi Amador, an alumna of Bryn
Mawr college, has a voice that has been
described by the Boston Globe as "like
clean spring water: it's smooth, it's clear,
and somehow, you come to believe that
it's necessary for life."

Although the group is seen as an inno-

vator among its peers, some points of tra-

ditionalLatin music are emphasized. Perhaps most prominently evident is Brian's
use of the nylon string guitar, which has
been all but abandoned by the contemporary Latin music scene. Ballads will include fresh interpretations of traditional
songs and will also include original compositions by group members and friends.
Sol y Canto has played to audiences
around the world, including the White
House and the Kennedy Center. The performance and workshops by Sol y Canto
is free and is sponsored by the William J.
Cooper Foundation.

Sol y Canto performs music that draws from many influences, including Latin and AfroCaribbean music. The group will be performing and conducting workshops Friday and
Saturday of next week, Nov. 5 and 6.

Arboretum volunteers give freely
By Hillary Dresser

Remember that time you got
an early start for a change and
actually strolled with your head
upright en route to class, rather
than bent forward, eyes glued to
the ground, in the proverbial
Swarthmore bustle? The
memory may be vague.
Let me refresh you. Perhaps
it was last spring when all of a
sudden you caught a glimpse of
something bright in the corner
of your eye and noticed Magill
Walk lined with daffodils. Perhaps it was earlier this semester in Parrish when you lifted
your gaze and noticed the lush
flower arrangement in the lobby.
It may have been just a couple
days ago when you noticed a
group of strangers on their
hands and knees outside of Lang
Performing Arts Center, rifling
around in the dirt, and thought,
"Who the hell are they? And what
are they doing here?"

Program recently created
It's true. There's a body of
people on campus who exist
right under our noses, and many
of us don't realize who they are
or what they're doing here, or
that they're even here at all.
They are the Scott Arboretum
volunteers, several of whom
have deeper, stronger ties to the
campus than the students themselves. These volunteers are
partly responsible for the occasional glimpse of natural beauty
that we Swatties catch every
once in a while in our more observant, less egocentric moments.

The volunteer program is a
relatively recent development in
the arboretum's 70-year history.
Though the staff of the Arboretum has longrelied uponthe support and assistance of donors,
called the Associates of the Scott
Arboretum, the organized volunteer program was not instituted
until 1987. The program was designed to solicit, train, and

"We've had as
many as 8,000
hours given in a
year [by the
volunteers]... that's
how important
they are."

grounds.

There are volunteers at the
Arboretum three days each
week on Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday. The volunteers'
schedules vary from one to the
next. Every three months, Chairman of Volunteers Shirley
Daniel sends out schedules to the
volunteers, and the volunteers
sign up to work on days that
accomodate their own lifestyles.
Daniel said, "They know when I
call that we need more volunteers."
One volunteer, Sue Thorbahn,
who travels frequently, praised
the staff for their flexibility in
scheduling.
"They're very good about letting you fit [volunteering] into
your own schedule," she said.
Some months, Thorbahn will volunteer three or four times in order to make up for other months
when she will be gone.
There are also volunteers like

schedule reliable volunteers, or
Arboretum Assistants, to assist
the staff in the spring, summer
and fall.
The Arboretum solicits volunteers from its extensive membership of Associates. Every
year, the staff invites Associates
to enroll in the February training course, which teaches the
participants about the mission of
the Scott Arboretum, the staff's
methods of maintaining the
grounds, and some basics of gardening. In exchange for the free
training, the participants are
asked to give two half-days each
month in the fall, spring, and
summer volunteering on the

'<■'

week. Coslett, who has been involved with the volunteer program since its start in 1987, appreciates coming to the Arboretum because she loves to spend
time outdoors among the gardens. She explained that some
volunteers, like herself, give
their time so generously because
"you want to give something
back for the pleasure you get
from coming [to the Arboretum]."

Work varied
There is a variety of work that
requires the assistance of volunteers. Tuesdays and Thursdays
are the days when volunteers

come to workoutside. Last Tuesday, for example, a group of
seven or eight volunteers were
outside of LPAC planting 5,000
galanthus, or snowdrop, bulbs.
"We try to take advantage of
the days that volunteers are here
to do projects that will go faster
with a group," Pam Thomas, a
staff coordinator at the Arboretum, said.
One volunteer who was working on the galanthus bulbs, Sally
Dow, has been an outdoor volun-

interest in gardening, she mostly
loves to be active outdoors. Dow
will see the snowdrops she
planted come wintertime.
"I walk on campus every
morning, and it's nice to see one's
handiwork come into fruition,"
she said.
Jane Forsman, for whom gardening has always been a hobby,
joined the volunteer program
this year, after retiring in the
spring of 1998. She brings the
knowledge she picks up from the
professional staff home to her
own garden.
"It seems like you're not here
without learning something
new," she said.
A volunteer named Barbara
St. John enjoys "the best job
there is as far as volunteering
goes." She also has been involved
with the Arboretum volunteer
program since 1987 and has been
doing the job of flower arranging for about ten years.
"I told them when I took the
course that I wasn't going to do
any weeding," St. John said.
Instead, she cuts flowers from
all over campus for arrangements in Parrish, the Arboretum
office and the Benjamin West
Visitors' Center. St. John appreciates her time at the Arboretum
in part because she likes to garden, and also because she just
enjoys the atmosphere.
"No matter how bad I feel,"
she said, "I come here and I always feel better... this is my second home."
Each Wednesday, volunteers
come to help indoors with Arboretum mailings and paperwork.

These, too, are mostly volunteers
who have been with the Arboretum for a long time.

Long-term involvement

Daniel, an indoor volunteer, as

well as being the Volunteer

Chairman, reminisced about her

long history with the Arboretum:
"I've only been here forever... I
used to be outside digging and
mulching, and then I decided I
graduated."
In response, another indoor
volunteer, Betty Garminian,
joked, "One day we kneeled
down and we couldn't get up... so
we moved inside." Several of the
indoor volunteers have been
working together for many
years now, and the Wednesday
sessions are as much social gatherings as they are work.
Garminian gave further insight into why the volunteers
keep coming back: "[The staff]
gives us a lot of nice parties to
thank us."
One more notable volunteer is
Bob Thompson, who consistently
wins the award every year for
being the most active volunteer.
He comes almost every volunteer day and runs errands of all
types for the Arboretum staff.
He does everything from answering the telephone to stocking the kitchen with cookies to
bustling all over campus delivering messages and performing
necessary tasks.
"I don't do windows," warned
Thompson. On this note, he
shared the secret to running a
successful volunteer program:
"Keep the volunteers happy, and
give them they kind of work that
they enjoy."

Thompson is one of the many
personalities that makes the Arboretum a colorful place to work
year-round.

The volunteers are essential to
the success of Plant Sales, which
happen every other year, and of
annual events, such as the Arbor

Day celebration. Since its advent, the volunteerprogram has
become indispensable to running
the Arboretum.
"We've had as many as 8,000
hours given in a year [by the volunteers]
that's how important

they are," said Claire Sawyers,
Director of the Scott Arboretum.
Connections to campus
A significant number of the
volunteers are Swarthmore
alumni or former administrators, who remember what it was
like to bustle all over campus
from commitment to commitment. Some, like Thompson, who
attended Swarthmore during
WW 11, still know what it's like.
All of them love the campus,
all of themcare deeply about the
Arboretum, and every one of
them has a story to tell for an
interested, observant Swattie. So
if you see some strangers primping and pruning the grounds like
they own the place, that's who
they are, and that's what they're
doing here.

“Three to Tango” pure idiocy posing as comedy
By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff
Just the names publicizing this one should have
warned me that it wouldn'tbe any masterpiece. Jumping on the bandwagon of movies starring members of
the "Friends" cast, "Three to Tango" was almost entirely
in the hands of Matthew Perry, playing a dopey architect trying to establish himself in the field. His lovely
and not-so-talented costar, Neve Campbell,played a budding young sculptress with a severely distorted conception of relationships. The ideas embodied by the movie
may have made for a somewhat meaningful storyline,
except for its complete lack of decent actors and the
botched presentation of its controversial themes.
It's obvious that no one thought this out. Sure, "Three
to Tango" has a certain element of humor, but it's mostly
theresult ofpure idiocy posing as comedy. Throughout
the movie, Amy Post (Campbell) remains involved with
a creepy, incredibly jealous married man for no apparent reason.
There isn't a single indication that would explain why
this beautiful, young, talented character would stay attached to a sleazeball, wimpy, overprotective man.
Maybe it's Campbell's obnoxious voice. Perhaps it drove

Sean Connery masterfully portrays a grand larcenist who the police just can't catch.
Frustrated, they decide to dangle Zeta-Jones, before him: a sort of bait gimmick that
they'd worked out amongst themselves. The movie is compelling and unpredictable... and
chock full of action, sensuality, and big, big thrills. This one's definitely worth your while.

Carrie is a sweet, timid high school girl, a little kooky, maybe, but mostly harmless. Stifled
by her mother's crazy ways, she desperately searches for some form of release; once
learns how to direct her rage (and HAS she got a lot of it!), there's no stopping her. A

Described as the last great film of the Soviet Era,"lvan Lapshin" is strange, unsettling,
and elusive, shockingly raw in its depiction of the squalor of Soviet Provincial life in the
19305. Filled with iconic portratis of once-revered Soviet leaders who failed to survive
the 19305, "Ivan Lapshin" represents Bolshevik idealism as a lost dream.

After 15 years of total dedication, Willis and Pfeiffer scramble to find just one more
reason not to bag their messed-up marriage. Not quite the sap story of"Random

that's lost its spark.

7:00,10:00

A thriller narrating the pathetic life of a man controlled by secular society who latches on
to a more powerful being in an attempt to improve himself, and displays his new power in
disturbingly violent outbursts. If you can get past the graphic content and abrupt twists,
it's an entking thought-provoker. If not, at least it's packed with outstanding special effects.

An in-depth version of the Saturday Night Live skit,"Superstar" delves into the making of
the odd but entertaining Mary Katherine Gallagher. It's definitely not a movie to be taken
seriously; even the humor could prove marginal. There's only so much Mary Katherine a
person can handle, and 92 minutes is an awfully long time to dwell on her first kiss.

"Three Kings"

7:30,9:50

Supposedly an affecting war flick,"Three Kings" is just another Private Ryan rehash... only,

personal mission to take down Saddam and effectively save the world.

gay business partner, Peter Steinberg (played with more

that it perversely revises "Psycho."
Thriller (1983, dir. John Landis): Yes, Michael

differ and says that nothing featuring singing and

Don't Look Now (1973, dir. Nicholas Roeg): The

a married couple who visit Venice after their

ing has been for, his misidentified sexual orientation has other effects: he is recognized as the "gay
professional of the year" and has to give a speech at the annual convention.
In his pathetic address, the supposed climax of the movie, Oscar speaks before an audience of homosexual men and women, and, of course, four straggling but convenient heteros. At first, he tries to play
along but, out of patience and starry-eyed by the arrival of the leading lady, he decides to "come out of
the closet" before this almost exclusively gay gathering. On stage and camera, the famed architect
confesses his love for a woman, admits to lying about his orientation and, as this is Hollywood, is not
booed off the stage. Instead, he's applauded for his bravery.
"Three to Tango" ended as syrupy and wretched as it began. For the duration of the movie, I was
sickened by Neve's disgustingly giddy, super-childish, and very, very squealy role. I was embarrassed
for Perry in his unflattering portrayal of a not-so-gay man. But mostly, I was appalled by the response
of the audience around me. They seemed, really, to have enjoyed the show, as lousy and badly written/
acted/directed as it was. This frightens me. From the reaction of my fellow viewers, I wouldn't be
surprised if "Three to Tango" topped the box office, swiping the slot of some film with less hype but a

Polls show candidates are dead even moving into the final two weeks
By Janet Bunde
Bi-College News
With one week to go,the mayoral race in Philadelphia is heating up. Republican candidate Sam Katz and Democratic candidate John Street are duking it out in the polls, and coming up
dead even. High voter indecision rates, as much as 23%, according to a recent Inquirer poll, are contributing to the frenzy

of the last few days of an election described by many as one of
the strangest of recent Philadelphia history.
In a city of over 1.5 million people, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans four to one, a liberal candidate
with 19 years of experience in city government should, according to local pundits, newspaper editors and common sense, handily be beating a Republican challenger with no political experience and little name recognition. However, the polls are suggesting otherwise.
At best, they speak to voter apathy; at worst they highlight
what some believe is a growing unspoken racial dichotomy in
the race.
At first glance, this race would appear to be typical: a moderate Republican candidate stressing fiscal responsibility and
school vouchers, and a moderate Democratic candidate vowing to fix public schools and pointing out the detrimental effects of his opponent's proposed city budget cuts. It would appear to be an ideological battle, and even though conservatism
seems to be on the rise in America, the four-to-one political affiliationregistration imbalance in favor of the Democrats should
put Street ahead in most polls.
However, there's a catch. Street is black, Katz is white; and
the majority of citizens, though not warming particularly to
either candidate, are identifying with candidates along racial
lines, even though there has been little official discussion of
the topic by either candidate.
"It's not been an issue in the campaign at all for some people,
they'll vote based on race, some vote based on ethnicity and
some vote on neighborhood," explained Bob Barnett, Katz's

campaign director. Haverford political science professor Steve
McGovern agrees that race has not been a significant issue but

matic clout with the majority of middle-class voters concerned
with the bottom line.
White has no comparative background, and loses some support from the beginning. Katz's campaign rhetoric revolves
around his business background. According to spokesman
Barnett, "what he [Katz] has talked about is fundamentally
changing the way the city runs itself, taking a much more business-like approach, cutting out a lot of the waste, and stopping
the practice of running the city for 500-600 influential people,
instead of paying attention to all of the people of the city." This
strategy seems to be working for Katz, at least in the short term.
Citing numerous examples around the country of elections
involving a black candidate and a white candidate in which a
significant number of voters polled are still undecided,
McGovern explained that a large percentage undecided usually indicates good news for the white candidate, regardless of
party affiliation. However, McGovern cautions, Katz can not
take his showing for granted. Holding two-thirds of the white
vote in a city with a sizable and politically vocal minority population will not win him the election—his support is, overall, "too
thin."
Neither is Street out of the woods yet, however. Though he
has received the official endorsements of traditionally left-leaning groups, such as the local AFL-CIO, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers and the popular current mayor Ed Rendell,
what is more striking, to many voters, are the endorsements
Street did not win.
Individuals and groups have crossed party lines to endorse
Katz, including several other Democratic primary candidates,
most notably John White, Jr., and other organizations that generally refuse to support Republican candidates. POPEC, the
Pride of Philadelphia Election Committee, Philadelphia's largest gay and lesbian political group, has recently stepped forward in support of Katz stating that Katz's dedication to issues
of concern to gays and lesbians was stronger than that ofStreet.
Other key groups have chosen to remain neutral; the NAACP
of Philadelphia has refused to endorse either candidate. In the
minds of some analysts, this indicates bad news for Street. According to McGovern, in order for Street to win, he must mobilize his only sure constituency the black vote. "Street should
have at least 80%, if not 90% of the black vote," said McGovern.
In an attempt to gain ground, both Katz and Street have begun media blitzes, jointlypledging upwards of $1.5 million.The
election will be won and lost among the cities "undecided" and
the final two weeks before voters head to the polls will be critical to both candidates fight for every vote they can get.

After announcing last week that it

the party in Sharpies would cost $6OO to

Thomas continued that party associates

Garnet Tide prepares to face Franklin

Marshall

Rollercoaster season has
Swat struggling to break
28-game losing streak
By Justin Kane
Phoenix Staff
As Keith McManimen 'O2 stepped forward from the ranks of his teammates
and jogged to the far end of the practice
field outside Lamb-Miller Fieldhouse
Tuesday, 49 pairs ofhands began clapping
in unison. The claps grew louder, faster,
and McManimen turned around.
"Breakdown!"
One hundred hands flew to 100 silverpadded knees.
"Huh!"
Moments later every member of the
Swarthmore College football team was
flat on his back, stretching with an intensity discernible even from the sideline.
It was a scene not to be expected of a team
that only three days earlier squandered
a 14-3 lead to fall to its 28th straight conference loss.
Yet it is only the most recent chapter
in a season that has seen the GarnetTide
go from Centennial Conference doormats
to The New York Times sports section and
back again. For head coach Pete Alvanos,
the ride has been nothing if not rocky.
"With a 28-game losing streak, every
game we play is a challenge," said
Alvanos, who has had the unenviable task
of turning a team starting only three seniors into a competitor against opponents
with far more experience.
Which brings up a point that Alvanos

hasn't diminished
his expectations, but he admits it hasn't
made his task any easier.
"Anytime you have a team that's underclassmen-driven it's tough to have chemistry from the start," Alvanos said. "In
terms of leadership, we're still feeling
around we're just starting to bond."
Wide receiver Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 has
seen the team struggle to come together.
"We haven't really had the team chemistry this year that we were looking for,"
Ntoso said, "but I think it's starting to
come together a little more."
For both players and coaches, last

Centennial Conference losing streak this Saturday on the road against Franklin Marshall at I p.m.
&

weekend's narrow 24-14 loss to Dickinson
represented the team's first steps together. It was, after all, the first time this
year the Garnet has come within 34 points
of victory since its 42-6 win over Oberlin.
"We played ten times better than we did
the week before, but we just came up a
little short," defensive end Bryan Byrnes
'O2 said. "But we went toe-to-toe for the
entire game against one of the
conference's better teams
I think it
showed what we're capable of."
Byrnes's comments mirror what the
coaching staff drew from the game.
"Last weekend we fired on five out of
six cylinders, which is far better than the
three we had been running on up until
now," Alvanos said. "I think we laid a foundationfor the rest of the season. We now
expect that same first-half performance
for every game."
However, the improvement seen by the
players and coaches has not been necessarily been seen by outsiders. Only 950
spectators watched the Garnet Tide fall
to Dickinson last weekend, down from the
2500 who cheered the team to victory
opening week. Alvanos attributed the
drop in attendance to the unreasonable
expectations placed on the by the hype
surrounding the victory over Oberlin.
"The win against Oberlin was just phenomenal," Alvanos said. "I don't think it
takes anything away from the win, but
now Oberlin's losing games pretty handily. It makes you wonder how good
Oberlin was."
For the team, what it amounts to is a lack
of respect
Swarthmore last's conference win came in 1995, so some teams view
a date with the Garnet Tide as a reprieve.
"People all around the league talk about
how we're not very good. But they don't
see how hard we work," said running back
Gabe Tajeu 'O3.
For Tajeu and teammates, the road to
legitimacy runs straight through
Lancaster, Pa., Saturday, where they
square off against Franklin & Marshall at
1 p.m. Although with an 0-7 record for the
season,F&M is no terror, the Diplomats are
conference opponents, and for Alvanos
it's the next step towards respectability.
"A vwi ifjh' c weekend
program m the conference," said Alvanos.
"Without it... I'm not sure."
A certain sense of expectation has pervaded the Garnet Camp this week. Players have been talking about "respect" and

Facing the facts:
Braves blew the Series

■■29 oct. I999HmH

Turning on a dime

By Patricia Barrientos
Phoenix Staff

The second guessing can start now. Yes, the New York Yankees are the team of the century with the latest title just another adornment to their already historied franchise. Additionally, baseball is a game of inches and chance and with each roll
of the dice, the Atlanta Braves crapped out. One cannot help to
thinkwhat would have been if the best defensive team, the Mets,
or any other competitive team with good defense, moderate
offense and a postseason competent manager wouldhave faired
against the Yankees. What if Atlanta Braves manager Bobby
Cox had listened to himself and not left his starters in the game
too long, resisted the temptation to replace his starters in order
to play the overrated lefty-righty game or stopped intentionally walking players.
All aspects considered, the first game was a display ofpure
pitching mastery, neutralizing any offense-producing machineuntil the eight inning. From there on, defense, or lack thereof,
sealed the fate of the Braves. Chuck Knoblauch's bunt on the
first-base side went straight to the highlight reel. With the bases
loaded and the score tied at one, Cox draws in his infield and
gets his lefty-lefty matchup. Instead of giving up one run and a
the probable scenario if second
getting a double play
baseman Bret Boone had been playing at normal depth
it
was a two-run single and still no one out. The second game was
over before it begun. Cox played his B-team lineup of Keith
Lockhart, Ozzie Guillenand Greg Myers. Not only did his plan
to jumpstart his offense backfire, but his defensive replacements were anything but. The result: the Braves were shutout
until the ninth inning, at which point the Yankees were up by
seven runs.
Game three will be remembered by Knoblauch's "pop up," as
Cox called it, sailing into right field just beyond the reach of
Brian Jordan. Then again, most managers would not have left
their flu-ailing starter who had lost seven pounds in four days
out on the mound in the late innings. With the bullpen theBraves
boast, a four-run lead should be safe, right? Well, the situation
was never tested considering game three starter Tom Glavine
left when the game was already tied. Then again, the game
should not have been tied considering outfielder Brian Jordan
dropped Knoblauch's fly ball to set up the Yankees first run.
The game moved on to extra innings, the place where nobodies
become heroes-atleast for one game. The bench warmer Chad
Curtis hit more home runs in one game, two including the gamewinning run, than the whole regular season. And just like that,
the Braves were in a 3-0 game deficit. Facing elimination, the
Braves defense collapsed once again. JohnSmoltz's strong pitching performance was overshadowed by the Tino Martinez
grounder that skipped under first baseman Ryan Klesko's glove.
The Yankees posted a three-run rally. The end was near as the
ball that would havebeen a game-tying double by Chipper Jones
refused to go fair.
On any other week, the series would have been 2-2, yet in
these several chilly October nights, 315-foot balls were going
for home runs, unlikely players became household names and
the dreamrotation could not win. One is left to wonder why the
team of the 90s only has one ring?

Women's rugby to face Lafayette
By Rhiana Swartz
For The Phoenix
With two games left in their season, the
women's rugby team has been practicing hard to
finish their season strong. After an entourage of
difficult matches, the team ended up 1-2 in divisional games and with a 3-2 record overall. This
was not enough for the team to reach the championship tournament held this weekend. Instead,
Swarthmore will face Lafayette and attempt to
win their first post-break game. The last game
of the season is Nov. 6 against long-time rival University of Pennsylvania.
Largely a squad of newcomers, the women's
rugby team has had quite a turnout this season
and currently boasts a roster of 38, an amazing
feat for a club sport that is not easy to learn. The
team owes its popularity to a strong social grounding and "so much team spirit, I can hardly believe
it's Swarthmore," according to one junior. Lead-

Swat's most recent game was played Oct. 10 against
West Chester. Swarthmore seems to have a cursed relationship with this school, and it showed on this fateful
Saturday. Playing with more size and more experience,
including a few on the five-year plan, West Chester
emerged victorious and knocked Swarthmore out of the
playoff runnings. Eager to redeem themselves,
Swarthmore was scheduled to play Kutztown this past
weekend, but Kutztown forgot about the match, and the
Swarthmore women were forced to challenge their
brother team to a friendly kickball game.
Revenge is on the way, however. This weekend the
Swarthmore ruggers kick it off by taking it off Friday
at 1 p.m. in Parrish; students, faculty and construction
workers with cash are welcome. Once they find their
clothing, the women ruggers will spend Saturday battling Lafayette at 11 a.m. on Dupont Field.

Men's Ultimate advances to finals
By Matt Murphy
For The Phoenix
The men's Ultimate team went
2-1 this Sunday at home in the second leg of a two-part round robin
tournament of the Chesapeake
Fall College Championshipfeaturing 16 teams within two hours of
Maryland. The Earthworms beat
the Naval Academy and Towson
University, and lost to the University of Delaware. The men will
enter the finals of this tournament
with the No. 2 seed, which will be
held on November 14 in Annapolis, Md.
This past Sunday, the men's Ultimate team hosted their first
tournament in two full years by
holding the second leg of the
ChesapeakeFall College Championship. The Earthworms had gone
4-0 the week before, and entered
Sunday's tournament looking to
wrap up the #1 seed going into the
finals. The biggest test was going
to be against the University of
Delaware, who had also gone 4-0
the previous week before, and
was just as intent on finishing
atop the bracket as Swarthmore.

The Earthworms beat Towson in a
15-7 runaway in the first game.Likewise, Delaware took out Navy 15-7
to set up the gamefor first place with
both teams 5-0.
There was an added element to the
Delaware game for the men
fan
support. In the last tournament held
at Swarthmore in the fall 1997,it was
enjoyable for the players in the sense
that they did not to have to drive two
hours to play, but there really was no
homefield advantage because there
were no fans to cheer for the home
team. This time against Delaware,
however, fans came out in droves to
support the Worms. Players marveled at the numbers offriends showing up for their first glimpse of a
Frisbee game, and fans were taken
with the sport. One fan was heard to
remark, "What a great game!"
With many fans and players on the
sideline, the Earthworms were
pumped and ready to shut out the opposition. It did not quite happen that
way, however, as six Swarthmore
turnovers on the goal lines let Delaware jump to an 8-2 halftime lead.
The Worms, down but not out, resolved to come back, and proceeded
to cut the lead to 9-6 after the half.

Nonetheless, Frisbee is a game of
runs, and Delaware went on to
stretch their lead to 12-6.

Swarthmore thenstruck for three
more to bring it to 12-9, but could
not stop Delaware's game-winning run to end the scoring at 159. Immediately after the loss, the
Earthworms began hoping for the
opportunity to play against Delaware in the finals and exact revenge by curbing early turnovers.
Said Matt Davis 'Ol, "In the finals,
bring it on, UDel."
The final game of the day was
against the Naval Academy, who
the Earthworms systematically
broke down to get the win withthe
final score of 15-8. The men finished the round-robin portion of
the tournament 6-1, with wins
over Navy, Towson, U. Richmond,
U. Maryland, St. Mary's and U.
Virginia, and the one loss to Delaware. Swarthmore will enter the
single-elimination tournament
Nov. 14 ranked No. 2 with every
intention of winning the tournament and taking home the secondannual Chesapeake Fall College
Championship, and these boys
know they can do it.

Volleyballers finish season with losses
By Fran Smith
Phoenix Staff
After a number of disappointing losses and only two
wins over October break, the women's volleyball team
had a long, uninterrupted week to prepare for key
matches against Western Maryland and Ursinus.
Western Maryland is one of the top teams in the Centennial Conference, while Ursinus rests somewhere in
the middle. Nevertheless, the team worked extremely
hard all last week to prepare equally for each match.
The first team that the Garnet faced was Western
Maryland. The Green Terror quickly outpaced the
women and took the match 3-0.
Nonetheless, Swarthmore was able to put the first
matchbehind them and come out strong against Ursinus.
The two teams battled it out fiercely in the first game,
with Swarthmore eventually falling. The second game
was similar in intensity to the first, with one difference:
Swarthmore came out with the win. With the match tied
1-1, the Garnet entered the third game. As they started
their sixth game of the morning, the women's exhaustion began to show, and eventually Swarthmore fell 3-1
to Ursinus.
To end their season, the women took on Haverford
last Wednesday. Before the match the team's collective
attitude was one of determination and optimism. The
match not only marked the last match of the season but
the last collegiate match for the lone senior and team
co-captain Jenny Yang 'OO.
The first game started off extremely rocky, with the

Garnet, looking nervous and uptight, making several

unforced errors. "We all just needed to take a deep
breath and settle," remarked Lily Marsh 'Ol.
Finally in the thirdrotation Yang turned the game up
a notch, nailing several service aces. However, the energy was unable to carry all the way through to a win,
and Swarthmore dropped the first game 8-15. A new
team came out on to the court for the second game. The
women rallied fiercely with the Fords, outplaying them
in every respect, but were unable to clinch the second
game either, dropping it 17-19.
Once again the women came out very strong against
the Fords, taking the lead in the third game. The lead
did not hold, and Swarthmore fell 9-15 in the last match.
Only the score of the second game truly illustrates the
intensity of the match. Setter Bonnie French 'Ol commented, "The Haverford game was very evenly
matched. Despite the loss, I was proud to end this season with that game. We were playing great volleyball."
Yang had arguably one of the best performances of
her career. She had numerous aces and an unbelievable
number of digs. Fran Smith 'Ol had a lot to say about
her captain'sperformance. "She picked us up every time
that we needed her and her passes were unbelievable,"
said Smith. "We are going to miss her intensity so much
next year."

The Swarthmore women finish their season 4-20,1-6.
Although the numbers may not say much, the improvement from the last, winless season is apparent. The new
coaching staff has completely transformed the team and
the team will continue to improve through next season.

ing events.
Obviously, the players should get much of the credit
for their performance, but perhaps more importantly,
the coaches of both teams deserve to be recognized for
theirhard work. This hard work goes largely unnoticed
because it has only produced moral victories. However,
these moral victories will soon translate into victories
on the field and court.
The football team's newsworthy victory in week one
appeared to be a changing of the times. The last five
games seem to be proving otherwise. Yet, with three
games to play in the season, there is still a possibility
of ending the season with a respectable record. Even
if the Garnet Tide were to go winless in their remaining games, much improvement has been made on and
off the field.
Cornerback/strong safety Tony Hillery 'Ol attributes
much of the progress to the head football coach, Peter
Alvanos. "Coach A believes in us. He cares. He gets on
us for not lifting," he said. "Coach Miran [coach for
the 1990-1997 campaign] always just let us go out and
play. If you play for Coach A, you're working hard."
Alvanos, who signed on as head coach late in the summer of 1998, is now in his first full year as coach. "It
takes time to develop a team with a new system," Hillery
explained. "This was the first year Coach A did the recruiting, the first year he was with us during training
camp."
Perhaps the most important task Alvanos has accomplished is getting the maximum out of each player.
"Coach A is a great motivator. He gets us ready to play
our hearts out every week," Hillery said.
Obviously, palatable losses, close games, and good
efforts are not what the team aims for each week. But
with the leadership of Alvanos, palatable losses will become last-minute victories, close games will become
hard-fought wins, and good efforts will become blow-

outs.

From the gridiron to the hardwood...
The women's volleyball team entered the season with
a less-publicized but just as embarrassing losing streak.
The Garnet "Bulldogs" had a 28-game losing streak before defeating Washington earlier this year. They won
three more matches, finishing 4-20, a marked improvement from their 0-16 record last year. And while their
record is nothing to write home about, there is a competitive flare that was lacking all last year.
Much of this can be attributed to the fresh faces. Firstyear players Bryn Rosenfeld, Pamela Lavallee, and
Christine Hancock have made significant impacts in
their debut year with the team.
However, of all the fresh faces that have improved
the program, none has been more instrumental than
first-year coach Deana Maguire. Defensive specialist
Gloria Chan 'O2 points out the biggest difference since
the coaching change: "When we practice now, we work
on building our skills as individuals and as a team. Last
year we just went out and played with whatever skills
we brought with us. But she [Maguire] is making us into
better players."
Also, the team seems to have soaked up the energy
and enthusiasm brought by Maguire. "There is finally
a team atmosphere. We feed off her energy and we always feel we have a chance to win," says Chan. The improved attitude is readily visible, especially compared
to the downtrodden and pessimistic faces that moped
around the court at the end of last season. Maguire, like
Alvanos, will soon be turning agonizing defeats into victories.
Obviously, we should not feel content with the moral
victory of "not losing as bad as before." Instead, we
should recognize that our teams are slowly but surely
crawling out from the dark dank cellar that we have
occupied for much too long. With football and volleyball, we have found new coaches that can lead our men
and women through adversity and on to victory. It is
high time the other struggling sports teams to follow
their lead so we can have teams and athletes we can
feel proud of, instead of just having sympathy.

When Sanjay Garfa left college, he doubted whether his classroom lessons related to the real world. But joining AmerlCorps
helped him make the connection he had been lacking. By the end of the year, he had launched a public education drive to help
community residents get the health care they needed. "AmeriCorps challenged me and helped me grow," Sanjay says. "After that
year, I returned to school with new skills and a better sense of direction."
