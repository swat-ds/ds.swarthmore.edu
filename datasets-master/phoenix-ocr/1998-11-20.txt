SC van
suffers two
wrecks

Saturday's unity party
ends in violence

In two separate incidents earlier this month, students driving a
Student Council van were involved
in traffic accidents. The two accidents occurred less than a week
apart
On Nov. 10, Shawn Billie 'O2
was driving his normal route to drop
ofCTVIC tutors in Chester when he
rear-ended a Ford Bronco stopped
at a traffic light on Route 320. The
Bronco then hit the vehicle ahead
ofit, which in turn hit another car.
Recalling the accident this
week, B illie said his mind was a blur.
The woman in the car ahead of the
Bronco had whiplash and Billie gave
her his jacket. Van 17A had a
smashed bumper and a bend in the
hood. The second accident in the van
in six days and the worst in years,
the crash sent the vehicle to the body
shop, said Karen Mazza, auxiliary
services assistant. As ofWednesday
the van was still in repair.
Fang Cai 'OO was driving the
van to Chinatown on 1-95the previous Wednesday. A passenger was
giving her directions, she said, and
she had to change lanes unexpectedly at thelast minute. She checked
her mirror and there appeared to be
a white car far behind her. But she
misjudged its speed or position, because when shemerged she swiped

Van Coordinator Dennis Cheng
'Ol said thatthe two accidents were
the only ones so far this semester,
and it was coincidence that they
occured less than a week apart.
Van drivers found to be at
fault in accidents must pay the
insurance deductible of $5OO, according to Josh Bess 'OO, Budget
Committee treasurer. The college
includes the vans on its insurance
policy, but the $ 1000 per-van peryear reimbursement Student
Council gives the college does not
cover all ofthe premiums, Mazza
said.
"Accidents occur every semester," assured Cheng. "It has nothing
to do with how the van system is

New housing lottery system agreed upon
by Dave Ellis
Staff Writer

The Housing Committee has
arrived at a compromise towards a
new housing lottery system beginning with next year's sophomore
class.
Instead of entering a housing
lottery each year to determine selection in housing, each rising sophomore will simply enter the lottery
once before sophomore year. If the
student's lottery number is in the
lower third sophomore year, that student will be assured ofbeing in the
middle third junioryear, and the top
third senior year. This transitioning

"The lottery system has been

Yeo 'Ol. This echoes the typical
complaints of many students who
are forced to live in Willets sophomore. Typically, housing in
Wharton, Worth, and Mertz is selected first, while Willets, Mary

chosen last, though there are certainly exceptions.
Under the old system, sophomores or juniors forced to live in lastchoice housing were entered into the

the fortune to get good housing the

be far more equitable for the student

Last Saturday's celebration
in Upper Tarble, sponsored by
a united support group effort of
HOLA, SQU, SASS, and SAO,
was to culminate the week's
drive for a positive and strong
response against the recent vandalism of the Intercultural Center. However, the festivities
were reportedly terminated after an altercation that evolved
between an undetermined number of Swarthmore and Temple
University students.
Many Swarthmore students
described the celebration as a
successful affair. Yet, about 1
a.m., the commotion started.
The fracas was described by
several party-goers as originating over a female. Anonymous
witnesses depicted the dispute
as less a physical fight, and more
as a combination of yelling,
pushing, and limited violence.
Moreover, there seemed to be
more people involved in restraining the aggressors rather
than actual participants in the
fight. The fact that members of
each opposing group in the fight
alternately left and returned to
the scene in Upper Tarble added
to the confusion.
According to witnesses, the
DJ gave a series of three warnings; the final warning resulting
in the cessation of music, the
lights turned on, and the dance
floor cleared. Public Safety arrived at 1:19 a.m. to "stand by gether."

The Committee On Educational Policy is currently discussing the possibility of eliminating the long standing swim

CEP considers nixing
swim requirement
by Daniel Marrin
Contributing Writer
The Committee On Educational Policy (CEP) continued
its conversations this week
about
whether or not
Swarthmore's swim requirement should be eliminated.
While CEP has not reached a
decision yet, the committee is
looking for input from other
bodies on campus, including the
Department of Physical Education.
CEP student representative
Zoe Whitley 'Ol raised the issue initially, pointing out the
awkwardness ofthe requirement
for freshmen during orientation.
Whitley did not take the swim
test because of a recent hair
change, but she completed
Aquatics I with no complaints.
Her ambivalent feelings about
the requirement, however, resonated deeply with many other
students.
The historical origins of
swim requirements take on almost mythic status as enough
time passes. The most notorious
story belongs to Harvard University, where it is said that a
man donated the funding for a
library to the university on the
condition that it establish a
swimming capability test, due

to the fact that the donor had lost
his son on the Titanic. At Swarthmore, rumor has it that the
originator was the man who donated the money for Sharpies to
have ice cream every night, on
the condition that the swim requirement be established, also
apparently due to the death of a
family member. Suspicions have
also arisen that the ice cream
story is fiction and that
Swarthmore's swim requirewas
the
merely
ment
administration's attempt to keep
up with Harvard.
Whatever its original cause,
Swarthmore now faces the possible end of the swim requirement. Surprisingly, this matter
does not appear to be drawing
much ire or drama on campus.
Little debate has occurred among
CEP members either. Indeed,
Whitley states, "It's one of the
easiest decisions that's come
about." This committee also faces
the more controversial issues such
as choices about course distribution and language requirements,
and whether to offer minors outside the Honors Program.
According to Provost and
head of CEP Jennie Keith, the
committee plans to consult with
Director of Physical Education
Bob Williams about whether to
eliminate the requirement.

Condemn the act but not the perpetrator
by Justin Capps
Contributing Writer

I'm straight. I'm male. I'm
white. I think the horrible act
against the Intercultural Center
has no justification. Occurrences
like that stem from strongly held
beliefs and the inability to articulate them in a less hurtful manner. Why are those people unable
to say what they feel? Because
we tell them its wrong. We tell
them that they're bad people for
believing what they believe. Does
that strike you as something familiar? Perhaps because they say
we're bad people for believing
what we believe?
Why do we so firmly believe
that we're right and they're
wrong? The answer to that question might not be simple, but it is
not complicated either. Essentially, itcan be reduced to thefact
that in the end there are only two
fundamental components of our
beings: our humanity and our be-

liefs. The problems that have
arisen have been created by enmity between contrasting belief
systems. Some of us have spent
our lives reinforcing the beliefthat
we should accept many forms of
"diversity." Racial tolerance, religious tolerance, and the acceptance of different sexual orientations are the bases of our viewpoint. The opposing viewpoint
has been cultivated by an environment that taught its youth that
some ethnic groups are inferior,
some religions are just plain
wrong, and homosexuality and
bisexuality are evil. The people
on either side are neither good nor
bad for what they believe, they
were just produced by drastically
different environments. Imagine
for a moment that you grewup in
afamily that advocated the beliefs
ofthe opposite side. Imagine for
a moment that you were told that
everything that you believed
made you a bad person.
Some religious doctrines

speak out directly against the beliefs of other religions. For instance, Church X believes that
Church Y is evil, and Church Y
believes that Church X is evil.
Who is right? If we attend Church
X, then we will almost indubitably say that we are right, and
Church Y is wrong. It appears to
me that this is a direct translation
of the current concerns on our
campus: Our camp believes their
camp is wrong, and their camp
believes ours is wrong. We might
say under our breaths that in a perfect world they would see it our
way, but which of us knows what
a perfect world is like? The rally
brought people together against
the other side. The groups in the
Intercultural Center have tightened the fabric that unites them.
That's nice, but can we really say
that it is unqualifiedly a good
thing? The group thatrefers to the
IC as its "safe space" has restricted itself even further. Suspicion and anger have created an

imaginary prison that cannot conceivably lead to any resolution of
the issue.
We have to be willing to accept the fact that we can't force
change today. We have to be
willing to accept the prospect of
change somewhere down the
line, long after we'll be gone.
Along that road, it is important
that we remember that there are
two separate parts of each individual: the humanity and beliefs. We have to love everyone's
humanity, no matter how much
we may be offended by some beliefs. Until we can learn that we
must love those who hold the opposing viewpoint, no change will
ever come into being. So, I implore you, Swarthmore community, don't lash out in anger orfear
at those who attack your beliefs.
Rather, try to find the strength
within yourselves to avoid condemning others as you have been
condemned. Nobody likes that
feeling.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
To the Editor:

To the Editor,

I just finished reading the Phoenix article (11/13/98) regarding
SAC funding for the DU/Phi Psi Halloween party, and frankly, I'm
aghast. Did I read this correctly? SAC spent $3OOO on a party?? It
seems SAC has significantly degenerated over the past semester,
but for now I have two major complaints.
First, SAC is required to host two non-alcoholic events per
month. The money comes from a special activities budget (the
same budget which is covering the DU/Phi Psi expenses, I
believe). Unfortunately, I've noticed only two events organized
by SAC this semester: the formal and a casino party which was
not non-alcoholic. Though non-alcoholic events are not as
popular as parties with alcohol, they are REQUIRED of SAC,
and many students enjoy them. If SAC continues to dip into this
special account for parties, there will be no funds left for
requisite, creative, large-scale events.
Second, the amount of money allocated to the Halloween
party is absolutely ludicrous ($l2OO allocated plus an additional
$lBOO spent by the co-coordinators). Last year's fall formal cost
approximately $l6OO, a staggering amount which included an
expensive DJ, an abundance of decorations (including "skyscrapers" and a helium tank), and about $6OO worth of exquisite
food. The spring formal cost only $7OO. As far as parties go,
$550 was initially allocated to the ML Halloween party last
year; the full $7OO was not granted until ML sought additional
sources of funding. Furthermore, I believe SAC is required to
get Student Council approval for expenditures over $lOOO (with
the exception of formals). As far as I know, SAC failed to do so
for this overpriced, unimpressive party.
As a former member of SAC, I am appalled by the
amount of money spent on this one party, which was not
technically a SAC event. As a responsible adult, I am
shocked at Bell and Skiadas' temerity, spending SAC funds
without committee approval. It was an abuse of power and a
misuse of student funds. And as someone who works hard to
pay for Swat, I would sincerely appreciate an itemized
account of where my money went for this party.
So what do I expect from my SAC representatives? I
would like to see allocations posted weekly on the SAC
board as they were in the past. I would like to see the reinstatement of inventive, special events which do not rely on
alcohol to attract students. I would like to see more than one
SAC-sponsored party per night on the weekends. SAC is
spending our money, and they must answer for how our
money is spent. They have an obligation to the student body
to provide quality entertainment AND to spend our money
responsibly. I believe they have failed in both respects, and
right now, I would not be opposed to calling for the resignation of both coordinators.

I'm sure you're tired of hearing about hate crimes and
racist acts. But this time, I'd like to discuss an incident that
doesn't cast suspicion on some DU-type; instead, I want to
share one relating to a member of the minority population at
Swarthmore.
A prominent member of SASS had been yelling for everyone to clear out of Upper Tarbles following the fighting incident
at last weekend's party (apparently in fear that the police would
find out that underage students were drinking). Another female
student felt initmidated by the yelling and told the SASS
member to calm down. Perhaps because it was too dark to see,
the member of SASS assumed that the student was white and
replied, "Get out now or else I'll kick your motherfuc-ing white
ass!" In turn, the female student replied, "I'm not white." A
nearby student who was white cyncially responded, "Yeah,
unity!" This incident struck me particularly hard because this
matter would have caused a huge rally had a similar statement
been made by a white student that targeted a "black ass" or a
"yellow ass." The reasoning behind this is because of a pervasive double standard that exists between white and minority
students at Swarthmore.
White students are often the ones depicted as the hate
mongers and instigators ofracism. Minority students are often
depicted as the victims and receivers of hate. But minorities can
be perpetrators ofracially-motivated acts, too, in this case,
racially explicit speech. They should not be surrounded by an
aura of protection from being deemed racist simply because of
the color of their skin. Just recently, Swarthmore students have
been crying for "Safety, Respect, Unity." That message doesn't
merely extend to white students; that message also applies to
minorities.
When I approached others about the incident pertaining to
the statement made by the member of SASS, those individuals
responded by saying that "Well.. .that's just her personality"
and "What are you going to gain from telling others?" I don't
think those same comments would have been made if a White
student at Swarthmore made the same similarly racial comment.
In fact, I think that student would be ostracized by the student
body. Unfortunately, the prominent member of SASS probably
won't be reprimanded for her comments. In fact, people have
told me that "you'll just cause trouble for yourself if you say
anything." Well, I'd rather cause trouble for myself (and be
ostracized by this supposedly "powerful" black student and all
her friends), than let the incident slip into oblivion. I will not
reinforce an unacceptable double standard that continues to
pervade Swarthmore College.
Minorities can be racist, too. It's unfortunate that those
whom I've talked to, don't want to hear about it. Do you?

Ofcourse, the organizers ofthe

US should not bomb Iraq
Dann Naseemullah
Contributing Writer
Despite Iraq's recent compliance
with the weapons inspection regime,
after a tense military standoff for the
second time this year, the Persian
Gulf is still on a razor-edge. The US
military presence continues to escalate beyond proportion in order to
give President Clinton options should
another crisis occur. Iraq and the US
are playing a cat-and-mouse game
that's becoming increasingly more
dangerous and uncontrollable, leading perhaps to armed conflict.
It essential for everyone to understand that US air
strikes on Iraq are
not going to remedy
this tense situation.
If and when President Clinton decides
to use
military
strikes during a
faceoff, he will be
shooting himself in
the foot. A simple
cost-benefit analysis
of this action proves this.
The benefits of an air strike will
be minimal. Saddam Hussein and
presumably most of his precious
military force are hidden underground, expecting just such an attack.
The US military will not be able to
deal a blow that would significantly
decrease Iraq's military capability.
The costs are much higher.
Since this is a military action, there
will be civilian casualties. No matter how precise the technology of
Tomahawk missiles, innocent
people will be killed. Saddam
Hussein is a dictator who believes
that individuals are expendable,
and the starving, dying Iraqi population adores him. Saddam Hussein
is not a cancerous growth that can
be excised with .a "surgical" air
strike, he is firmly entrenched as
an institution in Iraq. He will not
be touched, and civilians will die.
We also have to remember that
we are potentially dealing with weapons of mass destruction. There was a
reason why the US and the USSR
didn't come into direct armed con-

flict during the Cold War. Saddam
Hussein would be a thousand times
more likely to deploy any chemical
and biological weapons he might
have (of which we have no evidence)
in a war-time crisis with US air
strikes than otherwise. The goal of
the international community, whatever the situation, is to prevent exactly that deployment from occurring. Other dangers are relevant: if a
US bomb damages a factory in which
chemical or biological agents were
being created, those agents would be
released into the air and kill millions.
So, what do we do? I strongly believe that a concerted effort towards
real diplomatic dialogue aimed at sorting out this situation
, is the only option.
The diplomacy involved in this situation can hardly be
called diplomacy,
with Iraq playing a
deadly game and the
US shaking their big
stick and their
higher moral imperative. If real dialogue could occur, then a certain rationality could prevail. Saddam
Hussein's government is not fundamentally irrational, like the Taliban.
I've heard many individuals
liken the Iraqi situation to the appeasement of Germany in the
1930s that led to World War 11.
With two aircraft carriers and thousands of troops in the Gulf, this is
not appeasement. It takes a lot of
self-control to resist the urge to
blow Iraq to kingdom come. This
urge must be resisted at all costs.
The diplomatic strategy is the
right tactic, but it is also a frightening one. The gut reaction is to
try and get rid of the problem
through an air strike; it seems that
could create a clean slate. What is
most needed is patience and a commitment to the ideals of peaceful
resolution. Iraq is a threat, and a
scary one, but that threat will not
disappear through air strikes, or
any other kind of armed attack.
Guns and missiles will not do the
job, but perseverance will.

New Devil's Dictionary

should know that civil rights in
this country were realized as a
result of the intimidating, highly
offensive speech acts of people
like Malcolm X and Martin
Luther King. Gay rights are being won today not because Swarthmore graduates are going
around the country holding "dialogues," but because queerpeople
are taking to the streets and proclaiming theiridentities in a manner that is often more offensive
than discussion-promoting. Expressions ofpride that are "in your
face" are effective precisely because they violate what others
consider their "safe space."
The argument of the rally's
organizers, therefore, amounts to
nothing more than "free speech
for me, but not for thee." People
who disagree with the
multiculturalists are allowed to
express their "opinions and identities"respectfully, but at the same
time the multiculturalists retain
the privilege of using the administration as their mouthpiece, to
enforce their message of "social
justice" with mandatory courses

The Other
Unreal
World
The period between Thanksgiving
and New Year's is second only to summer not just in the number of films Hollywood foists upon a public with more
discretionary money and free time, but
in the amount of publicity generated by
the "press" who do the public a favor by
giving them a guide to the Holiday movie
season. Even the oh-so-serious New York
Times devoted an entire supplementary
section this past weekend to cataloguing
this season's fodder for the masses with
time to waste after an exhausting day of
keeping the capitalist treadmill running,
i.e. Christmas shopping. I certainly
wouldn't want to be accused of missing
some of the hottest entertainment news
of the year (a new film with JTT!), so
here, devoted readers), is a Swat Holiday Season film preview.
December is traditionally the time
when all the films begging for Oscars are
thrown out with appropriately serious ad
campaigns, but this year the situation is
a bit different as three of the biggest Oscar contenders ("The Truman Show,"
"Saving Private Ryan," and "Beloved")
have already been released. What's left?
Well, there are a few serious attempts at
winning the hearts of stodgy old Hollywood types Oscar voters âbut there
seems to beless ofthat this year and more
of the crap you just couldn't get enough
of in the summer.
Anyway, enough with the off-thecuff analysis. Here are the films I think
will be of most interest to my extremely
narrow audience, along with a Swat twist
for your amusement: the Swattie(s) most
likely to see this film. (And as an added
incentive to wade through my sardonic
summaries, there's a special treat every
film lover will appreciate at the end of
this article.)
Celebrity (Miramax) Limited release Nov. 13. Swatties in attendance:
Ruach and female Ville adolescents.
Woody Allen is perhaps contemporary cinema's most consistently funny,
insightful, and quirky filmmaker, but
because his style is so distinctively unhip (so much that it's... hip?), his American audience (a group in which you will
always find me) is minute and he counts
on foreign audiences to make a profit. In
this investigation of the cult of celebrity
and all its associated trappings, however,
Allen had the titanic fortune of casting a
certain undersized blonde actor whose
visage adorns the walls of teenage girls
around the world. I would suggest waiting a week or two after it debuts so that
the glare factor from all the braces in the
audience dies down, but this story of a
journalist (Kenneth Branagh) obsessed
with the hottest star of the moment
(Dicaprio) looks to be Allen in top, "Bullets over Broadway" form, not "Everyone Says I Love You" intellectual trauma.

annoying: he's not in it!)

Music,

by George Macros

Staff Writer
Ben Fritz

November 20,1998

For

the second time this year,
some of the finest performers in
the Philadelphia area, including
many familiar faces in the Swarthmore
music department and featured soloists
Marciantone Barone and Charles
Abramovic, gathered to deliver to the
Swat community a complete musical
experience. Last Sunday evening, Orchestra 2001 returned to Lang Music
Hall for a spectacular performance of
three modern music pieces and a work
by Mozart. Conducted by James Freeman, this modern music ensemble gave
the premiere performance of "Time and
the 8e11...," written this year by Gerald
Levinson. This performance also presented the audience with the rare opportunity to listen to two of the
program's composers explain their
work.
Formed in 1988, Orchestra 2001
brings modern, cutting edge compositions to the public. Many of its
members reside locally, including
Composer Gerald Levinson and
James Freeman, both professors of
music at Swarthmore. Soloist
Marciantone Barone teaches piano at
Swarthmore and local resident
Charles Abramovic teaches music at
Temple. But despite the fact that the
group all resides in the area, the
scope of their music extends far past
Philadelphia and is recognized by
many as one of the premiere modern
music ensembles.
"The Septet," written by James
Primosch, slowly and mysteriously
begins the program. The dismal reluctance of the beginning of the first
movement gained momentum as
Abramovic's aggressive outbursts on
the piano were answered by the
brooding dissonance created by the
strings and woodwinds. The second
movement restored the slow and
murky qualities, even to a greater
degree than the first, and climaxed
with a short-frenzy of scathing dissonance. In the same manner that the
second movement exaggerated the
beginning of the first movement, the
final movement exaggerated the
characteristics of the second half of
the first movement. Amid the chaotic
sounds and rhythmic complexities of

the third movement, some delicate,
melodic flow managed to emerge before the turbulent end of the piece.
At the close of its performance,
James Primosch and Gerald Levinson
took the stage and remarked upon the
coincidental similarity in instrumentation of their two works, despite the
fact that the composition of "Septet"
precedes that of "Time and a 8e11..."
by fourteen years.
Featuring Marciantone Barone,
"Time and a 8e11..." begins with the
detached soundings of church bells
in the first movement called "Mosaic." Like the name of the movement, the scattered sounds of the
bells assembled into thick layers of
tranquil resonance. The momentous
complexity of the piece became apparent as the growing rhythmic aspect introduced a diverse range of reverberating percussion, including the
marimba, xylophone, temple blocks,
and two small gongs which conveyed

pitch. The piano moved back and
forth between high and low chords,
fashioned to resemble the resonant
qualities of the mingled rhythms. All
commotion subsides as the bells restore the quiet tranquillity of
"Evening," a movement which I felt
had a wintry sound.
The rhythmic mayhem resumed
in "Ragamalika," a term the composer defined as a "practice in Indian classical music in which the
soloist whirls through different
ragas, or melodic modes." Levinson
maximized the resonant capabilities
of the rhythmic percussion and at the
same time exploited the rhythmic
qualities of the melodic instruments
as Macriantone Barone plucked piano wires. Citing the influences that

upon
"Ragamalika," Levinson described
the next movement, "Night," as an
homage to Charles Ives. The polyrhythmic nature of "Ragamalikai"
'

persisted in "Night," yet the septet assumed their melodic qualities and
played a pleasingly flowing, bluesy
melody.
The final movement, "Incantation," is a hushed recapitulation of the
previous movements, which used the
temple blocks to end the piece in the
same manner that it began.
"Musica Celestis," by Aaron Jay
Kernis, is an arrangement of the second movement of his string quartet
for a string orchestra. Arranged in
1991, Kernis cites the inspiration for
this piece as the songs of praise which
angels deliver to god, a common
theme of medieval music. The serene
harmonic nature of this work sharply
contrasted with the fragmented and
rhythmic nature of the first two
works, which were written in the
same time period. This melodically
venturing work has an entirely differsee HAL,

tion plate around for more money. This didn't seem to
be that different from my experiences growing up in a
Christian community. What really concerned me though
was that the message for the week was about
ence. After the biblical readings, Marcus turned thefull
force of his charisma on the group and asked, "What
do you have to change to obey God and your leaders
without conditions?" and "What are you determined to
do to help the leaders of our church to the goals we
have set?"
Quite honestly, this scared me to death. I could see
that people were converting to Christianity with no
Christian background. I believe that thinking and individuality should be encouraged, but as I spoke to people
more and more, I found that questioning was not only
discouraged, but the leaders actively made decisions in
their constituents' lives. One person I met had made
ends meet by working overtime in- a language center,
but reluctantly quit when told that this time must be
instead dedicated to God.
This is only one church, and my impressions come
from limited experiences. Maybe the future of the
Church in Thailand isreflected better in the recent visit
of "Amazing Life." An American evangelist screamed,
shouted, and sold merchandise to a packed fairground
three days in a row as he made the lame walk and the
blind see. I wonder when Thailand will have its first
TV evangelist.
For the moment I think things will continue to
change. Most people cannot even comprehend the concept of not having religion. If they are disillusioned they
become Christian. The other day as we chomped on
spicy beef, spicy chicken, and spicy pork, my friend
Tot told me that he wanted to be like me: "In six years
I want to have no religion." Maybe in six years that will
seem to be a valid option. For now, though, I think disillusioned Buddhists will keep joining Christian congregations all over Thailand. The question now is
whether or not this will turn out to be a good thing, and
we can only let the passage of time give us the answer.

Phoenix Picks
Momus
The Little Red Songbook
Scottish iconoclast Momus's album The Little Red
Songbook isa patchwork of styles and tastes, ranging from
his self-proclaimed "analog baroque" style to spins on
more traditional forms. As a result of this penchant for
musical mish-mash, Momus can't be categorized into any
one style of music. This album in particular sounds like a
witty madman gone wild on a MIDI keyboard.
Momus' stronghold undoubtedly lies in his lyrics,
which include everything from artistic and literary allusions to downright smutty and surprisingly vulgar epithets.
These clever lyrics are the gems that lend credibility to
Momus's songs and hold together his work. "M C Escher"
showcases Momus's aptitude for language, and "Everyone I Have Slept With" is a vulgar, funny, and surprisingly catchy ode to the women that Momus has, you
guessed it, slept with. "WalterCarlos" is a piece about the
trans-gender composer who is evidently now suing Momus
for 22 million dollars. Songs such as "Tragedy and Farce"
are his literary backwash and are simply indulgently
smutty.
Momus takes his artistic liberties with musical form,
most clearly in songs such as "The New Decameron" in
which he plays the harpsichord, but sometimes (including in his two forays into operatic melodrama) he is a bit
too grating. Making hairpin turns throughout the album,
Momus does not cease to surprise, throwing in "Bom to
be Adored," a smooth, vaguely soulful piece which is uncannily catchy.
Momus hides an incredibly endearing hidden track
three minutes into "A White Oriental Flower" a minute
and a half of an eight year old Momus singing "I Can See
Japan." His father taped him singing as part of his doctoral thesis on childrens' acquisition of language, and it
still exists as a charming tune on this album.
Momus's good-natured humor is evident in the audience participation attitude ofhis Karaoke Parody Competition 9 of his 26 tracks are to be karaoke-backing versions ofhis songs. Momus suggests to his listeners, "Sing
your own parody of a Momus song with similar themes to
the one you've chosen." Send in your demotape, and have
it included on the next Momus album.
Momus has rightly been hailed as one of the most
creative and innovative voices in the music industry, and
he continues the tradition with The Little Red Songbook.

Skypark
Summer Days Are Forever

This quintet produces a charming and airy pop album
which includes catchy melodies and ethereal gender-ambiguous vocals. Skypark's lyrics are somewhat irrelevant
in Summer Days Are Forever; it is the group's delivery of
the songsâvaporous, relaxing, and incorrigibly cuteâthat
make this album. "Secret Hideaway" is representative of
Skypark's style; the song is brief and enchanting, with
gentle vocals. "Morse Code" has more of a beat and incorporates handclapping, an unconventional choice for

such a delicate pop album, but a choice that works none
the less. Who thought trumpets could be this tame? Trumpets are the crowning jewels of the pleasantly layered
melodies in "Countryside," which begins with a gentle
build up until the whispy vocals give way to light instrumental pop, making for a catchy tune.
Shelflife records have struck gold with Skypark, a
remarkable and adorable pop group.
Cat Power
Moon Pix
Chan (pronounced "Sean") Marshall is the leading
force behind Cat Power, an interesting if somewhat morose group. Cat Power's trademark style is comprised of
lyrics that are well-thought-out and sung in Marshall's
whispy, pleading voice against a background of sparse
musical accompaniment.
Cat Power extends its instrumental repertoire past conventional instruments to include sounds of thunder in
"Say," but most of the instrumental sections contain the
basics
all very sparsely
guitar, drum, piano, bass
and almost stingily used. Unfortunately, the thin instrumentation and unhurried pace of the songs can be
sedatingly slow, as in "Back of Your Head" or monotonous, as in a song in which the piano only plays two
chords. "Cross Bones Style," on the other hand, is a refreshing and welcome change with a stronger beat supplemented by haunting, echoing vocals by Marshall.
Though Cat Power leans heavily towards being morose and lamenting, "Moon Pix" is worth listening to if
only for Marshall's often effectively haunting voice.

Flin Flon
A-OK
Flin Flon is a trio of three guys whose songs on AOK are primarily characterized by a pulsating, at times
monotonous beat supplemented by a weaker melody, yet
Flin Flon also produces its share of effective songs with
amusing lyrics.
Highlights of A-OK include "Colgate" and other songs
that are downright catchy like "Ukraina" and "Odessa,"
the latter of which has cooing vocals that gracefully carry
the melody. The lyrics to "Odessa" are a boy's musings
that manage to be amusing and telling in their style, unlike the unfortunate rambling lyrics of "Yellowknife."
While "Yellowknife" begins with layered melody and narrative lyrics that initially sound like they might lead somewhere, during the course of the piece the lyrics digress to
incoherent ramblings of "tandoori, masala...samosa,
vindaloo" and lose their potency somewhere along the
way. "Whitehorse" isrepresentative of what Flin Flon can
sound like
the lyrics are repetitive and the tune is slow,
yet the song is still a good listen.
While A-OK isn't a stellar album, it is a compilation
of generally solid pieces with amusing musings for lyrics.

The orchestra then left the modern music genre and paid homage to

series of collections are planned, the
first one, on facilities, has already
been held. Since that first collection
was rather sparsely attended, and
since these plans will pretty much
dictate how the school spends
hundreds of millions of dollars, we
felt that providing a brief overview of
the sub-groups was a good idea. The
section also delves more deeply into
the issue of facilities spending, which
according to Larry Schall, Associate
VP in charge of facilities, could total
80 to 90 million dollars.

money through a massive capitol

with music, on campus and off,
classical and rock, vocal and instrumental. There's an interview with
Patrick Boe, a.k.a. "Pretty Boy," the

New Student Center is unlikely
Planning
group cites
more pressing
campus needs

College explores
facilities options
by Carly Hammond
and Nick Attanasio
Phoenix Staff
The Facilities planning sub-group

(PSG) released its report and held a col-

lection last month to announce its recommendations on how the college
should spend nearly 90 million dollars.
The group, composed of faculty,
staff and students outlined five basic
options: renovating and/or building additions to Dupont, McCabe Library,
and Parrish Hall, constructing a new
residence hall, and making space for
student activities. The committee,
headed by VP offacilities and Services,
Larry Schall, included three Board of
Managers representatives, faculty
members Karen Borbee, Nelson
Macken and Allen Kuharski. Student
members of the committee were Naomi
Michlin '9B, Josh Knox '99, Allison
Marsh '9B, Gil Rosenburg 'OO and Sarah Pheasant '9B. The group also included staff and alumni representatives
as well as Myrt Westphal, Director of
Residential Life and Sue Welch, the

Treasurer.

The sub-group started its work in

1997 and has now released a proposal
which prioritizes the five projects.
The group decided that renovating
the aging Dupont Science building
(built in the 19505) was the single most
important facilities change which could
be made, chiefly citing lack of space
and inadequate safety systems.
The committee placed the idea of
a new dormitory and an overhaul of
Parrish next in importance. The two
options are interdependent, the dorm
would provide swing space for students
during renovations to Parrish. Mark
Bristol-Evans cited accessibility and
fire safety as reasons for what he
termed "a major overhaul."
The PSG placed an addition to
McCabe and a reorganization of student space fourth and fifth respectively.
They see a major McCabe overhaul as
important, but still relatively far off in
the future compared with the other
projects.
Yet Schall points out that none of
these projects are imminent. In fact,
none are currently approved (the Board
has yet to do this), nor are they funded.
Altogether, the total cost of the projects
see FACILITIES, pg.9

Though 34% of students picked the
student center as their top priority in a
recent Sharpies poll to determine the
most pressing of the proposed facilities projects, the likelihood of that center materializing anytime soon is pretty
slim. As Facilities Planning Sub-group
student representative Josh Knox said
"It seems likely that it will be decided
that the other projects have a greater
priority in the order of the implementation of the long-range plan."
That hasn't stopped the subgroup
from coming up with a whole array of
ideas about what that new student center will include, if and when it finally
materializes. Of the five major capital
projects currently under consideration,
the student center(s) project appears to
be the most sketchy. According to
Planning Sub-group (PSG) head Larry
Schall, the committee considered "the
issue of student activities and how best
to accommodate the wide variety of
student needs in this area âmeeting
space, lounge space, play space, group
space, etc." Schall said, "It was very
clear that the present configuration of
space is not adequate."
Convenience
was cited as a major reason behind
the need for student activities facilities. PSG student representative Josh Knox
'99 said, "Some
of these ideas are
that, for instance,
it might be nice to
have a more central location for
students to aggregate; that the
Tarble snack bar is
at or over capacity; that the bookstore might be
better placed than
in the basement; and that student group
storage space would be better located
than all the way down at Sharpies III."
However, according to Knox, the
student center plans largely depend on
student opinion. He said, "The decision
of whether the future student center will
be located in an entirely new not-yetbuilt building, a remodeled existing
building (most probably Tarble-inClothier), in various disparate buildings, or any other option, will depend
Â«

Building a Mystery: Student
Opinion on the Sub-group report

Since a new
student center
is unlikely, the
PSG has
recommended
an increase of
available space
in both Tarble
and Parrish.

parts of Parrish

largely on the voice of the students, as
heard by the Board."
The central issue is apparently
whether to build a new expansive building that would serve as a true student
center or to renovate and expand existing facilities to provide more common
space for students and organizations.
Some proposed
facilities that
would fall in the
student center
building(s) included student activities offices, the
bookstore, a game
room, lounges,
the new WSRN
studio, storage
spaces, a snack
bar of some form,
the mail room, a
large space for
large parties, a
small computer
lab, and other activity-specific
rooms such as a
ceramics studio
and
common
meeting space.
Ultimately, the PSG report detailed
four possibilities for student activities
facilities. It recommended a combination of the first two options which were
to "create some additional space in Tarble
by moving the bookstore out"and to "reorganize the space in Parrish to provide
more space for students in addition to the
space they now have there." The third
option, "to start over and build a new student center," appears to be unlikely. According to Schall, "What was pretty clear

in our meetings and meetings with students was that there was never going to
be one place on campus for students to
do everything other than sleep and go to
classes. In any event, new buildings are
a quite a ways off."
Little was said about the fourth option, which was to use only the existing
building on the Old Tarble site. It is assumed mat this is not a realistic possibility either and that this possibility may be
examined only if the other three options
not be satisfactory. There is a good possibility that the student center plans will
not be included in the upcoming renovations. Knox said, "The question of
whether the student center issue will be
addressed in the first phase oflong-rangeplanning construction has yet to be determined. It seems likely that it will be
decided that the other projects have a
greater priority in the order ofthe implementation ofthe long-range plan than the
student center." He added, "The fact that
some non-negligible portion of the student body would say that our current setup is adequate tends to make the student
center project less significant compared
with the other projects in the planning
process."
If the student center project is further considered, its implementation will
be difficultas Knox pointed out. He said,
"The lack of a student-body-wide consensus, or even a majority preference has
made and continues to make SC planning difficult. I feel, however, that
through myself and other student representatives, the variety of student opinions
on this issues have been accurately included in the long-rang planning discussion and, on the whole, the student center issue has been given due weight."

Survey: The 4 Proposals
THE DUPONT OPTION:
The Deal: Renovation of and addition to Dupont Science Building.
The Rationale: Inadequate space for all departments; building layout inappropriate (ex: large lecture halls not ideal for teaching); antiquated
and unsafe technologies present (ex: chem. fume hoods outdated).
The Skinny: Renovation of present space addition of 15,000-30,000 square
feet (Trotter is 30,000 square feet).
The Bottom Line: $24-40 Million.

40
THE PARRISH/DORM OPTION:
The Deal: Renovation of Parrish Hall, Construction of new residence hall.
The Rationale: DORM: mandatory in order to house students while Parrish is
renovated and move them out of less desirable locations; The dorm is
not intended to increase the size of the student body. PARRISH:
administration overcrowded; structural, mechanical, electrical problems (ex: lacks air conditioning, stairs don't meet fire codes or disabled access specifications, post office cramped for space).
The Skinny: The dorm would have 100 beds, 80% of which will be singles;
Parrish would possibly move admissions to the second floor, retain
floors three and four for student housing, expand the dean's office
and add more student space on the ground floor.
The Bottom Line: DORM: $7-11.5 Million, PARRISH: $l4-20 Million; Total:
$2l-31.5 Million.

The Rationale: Tarble basically sucks as a student space.
The Skinny: A re-configuration of Tarble: move the bookstore out, re-organize Parrish and use current Admissions space for students.
The Bottom Line: $3-5 Million.

but they will be transported to an earlier time of medieval castles and sacred chants. Cantatrix's repertoire
includes material ranging from early
pieces to modern chants, and although the popularity of chant music
has grown, Cantatrix remains a
unique group on campus. In addition to the Jamboree, Cantatrix will
be performing at Olde Club on December 6 at 8 p.m. Expect a candlelit concert space.
Going Coed

Swarthmore's coed a cappella
groups are Mixed Company, Oscar
and Emily and Psalters. Mixed
Company, originally called Moo
and the Seven Freshmen, was
founded in 1991 and is the oldest
coed a cappella group on campus.
The repertoire varies depending on
the group of individuals assembled.
This year the group has tried to stray
away from mainstream music but
nonetheless includes "crowd-pleasing, clap-along songs like "Son of
a Preacher man," says Joel Price
'OO, a three-year veteran of Mixed
Company. Depending on the year,
the group has adopted different traditions, such as wearing flower petals and green clothing for stems
when singing James Taylor's "Blossom." Audiences will also occasionally hear the famous Rubber Ducky
song, which is included in the latest Mixed Company CD, and whose
subject adorns the album cover.
Oscar and Emily was founded
in 1993 by jazz fanatics and has
the distinction of being the

nation's only strictly jazz a
cappella group. As for the odd
name, rumor has it that the founding member planned to perform at
that year's Jamboree and reached
into his backpack full of CDs to
find inspiration for a name for the
newly formed group. The two
CDs he pulled out happened to be
by jazz musicians Oscar S. and
Emily W. Since that beginning,
the small group has brought cool
jazz attitude and mellow scatting
to the campus. "We don't do the
whole a cappella performance,"
explains John Dolan 'Ol. "We focus on the quality of the music itself." Over the years, the group
has developed its own unusual traditions, such as an outdoor concert in South Street in Philadelphia. The members place a hat for
collections, which they then use
to treat the group's seniors to a
nice meal. Another interesting
tradition is the three-blind-mice
method, which helps the singers
sight-read. The technique involves
singing the words to "Three Blind
Mice" to the tune of the jazz song.
Oscar and Emily's future plans include touring and recording their
first CD. In addition, Oscar and
Emily will be hosting this
semester's Jamboree, for which
they will perform skits.
Psalters, founded in 1992,refers
to the old English word for book of
hymns as well as the biblical reference of "salt" inferring the duty of
serving as examples for others. The
group is Christian-oriented, and its
main purpose is spreading the good
news. Their repertoire includes
spirituals and contemporary Christian pop, and the group does not emphasize dancing or skit performances. Psalters also hosts the
spring Gospel Jam.

The Voice Behind Pretty Boy
by David King
Contributing Writer
At about 5:15 PM last Friday, a
young man sat poker-faced in WSRN's
studio A. He alternated his focus between
the mixer in front of him and the turntable to his left and not much else.
There were no screaming fans, no gawking admirers. Not even much of a party,
for that matter.
Surely, this couldn't have been the
site of the famous Pretty Boy show, the
highly-publicized WSRN radio show
marketed as a "party open to all?"
Well, it was, and it wasn't.
"Ideally, I'd like this show to be a
playful, fun show," remarked Patrick Boe
'Ol, the DJ for the Pretty Boy show, who
saw just one visitor that afternoon. "It
really depends on the week."
Dressed in khaki pants and a t-shirt,
Boe seemed at home in the studio. He
manipulated the mixercontrols with ease,
cued up one record after another ("I'm
always really excited to play records"),
and still found time to talk to a curious
guest.
Of course, sitting face to face with
Pretty Boy's alter ego, one can't help but
ask the obvious, burning question: what's
the story behind the signs?
"I wanted to make a fictional character into a superstar," he explained. Boe
himself wrote all the signsâ the ideas
for which came from friends but credits Gina Hart 'Ol for the pictures ("I don't
draw very well at all," he admitted). He
suggested Econ 1 inspired him to take a
commercial attitude about the show,

Chorus and Chamber Orchestra
Celebrate Life of Cisela Savage

Contributing Writer

[

!

The life of Gisela Bergau Savage
(1937-1998), who was co-founder of
T. Bumbles toy store and an active
member of the Swarthmore musical
community, is to be celebrated by the
Swarthmore College Chorus, Chamber Choir, and Chamber Orchestra on
Friday, November 20 at 8 pm in Lang
Concert Hall. By honoring Savage
through an evening of music by J.S.
Bach and Tomas Luis de Victoria, the
community continues the tradition of
musical excellence which Savage
valued so deeply.
Savage pursued music from a
young age, intensely studying piano,
violin, and singing. After moving to
Swarthmore, she played violin in the
College Orchestra, and served on the
Steering Committee in the first years
of the Friends of Music and Dance.
She was also one of the founders of
the Delaware County Youth Orchestra and served on its board of directors for over two decades. The final
musical performance she was able to
attend was the Swarthmore Chorus'
performance of the Brahms Requiem,
conducted last spring by John Alston.
The dedication of both Gisela
and her husband Bob to music at
Swarthmore has had a lasting effect
on members ofthe music department.
Chamber Orchestra conductor James
Freeman explains, "Gisela Savage
was a wonderful person whose enthusiasm for music, especially when
it involved young people, was inspiring to me and many others. She was
a guiding force for the Delaware
County Youth Orchestra, and I can
hardly remember a concert at Swarthmore College that she didn't attend.
I miss her greatly." Chorus conductor John Alston is also grateful for
Bob Savage's continued presence in
the music community: "Bob has been
a supporter of music at Swarthmore
since before I was here. Still he
comes to all the concerts. It's beautiful seeing him out there, listening
and enjoying it. And it's important
to folks like me that we know there
are folks like him in the audience that
really hear what's going on."
Friday's performance is the culmination of a semester's worth of preparation on the part of students, faculty,
and members ofthe larger community.
Every Wednesday evening members of
the chorus have gathered together to
learn J.S. Bach's Magnificat under conductor John Alston. Their goal is not
only to become acquainted with "the
notes," but to "learn the concepts of
how to sing them beautifully," explains
Alston. "Of all the things that we do
in choir, we spend the most amount of
time getting the notes to speak the poetry. I try in the time that we have to
show as much as possible how it is that
Bach does that" Alston explains that,
because Bach was "first and foremost
an evangelist," one cannot properly
sing his music without trying to understand his theological perspective. "He
was a preacher, and he did his preaching and his reminding and his encouraging through music. Now we talk
about those things in chorus, and I tell
them what Bach is trying to doâbut I
don't ask people to be Christians."
Alston offers chorus members insight into how Bach composed so
that the music would support or
elaborate the religious text it accompanies. For example, "the first movement is just swarming with groups of

three âthree of this,
three ofthat. So when
Mary is singing "My
soul doth magnify the
lord," Bach is saying
my soul doth magnify
Jesus...he makes it a
very Christian poem."
Alston also marvels at
Bach's compositional
directness: "He shows
in just a heartbeat and
with just one powerful chord that's so
short, how futile it is
to be arrogant âand
then it's all gone."
Alston tries to give
the chorus the tools
they need to offer
Bach's statement in
light of it's original
meaning. "You ask
the chorus to sing it in
a particular way, and
they're so good at doing that once you've
explained to them the
context.... I am not
trying to convert anybody, but they have to have that
understanding...they have to have the
idea behind the notes when they
sing."
According to members of the
chorus, Alston's detailed explanations and impassioned musical direction are highly effective. In regards
to the theological content which
Alston tries to explain, Jeremy
Peterson '99 remarks, "despite my
supposed atheism, I am not at all
bothered by the religiousness. I think
it contributes to the mood of formality that surrounds chorus singing."
Chorus Manager Megan Hallam '99
says, "He takes the time to explain
what's going on in the music as it has
to do with tfte actual text. [He discusses] the way the music is structured, so that we get some of the richness we would have missed otherwise." Swarthmore resident Johanna
Sibbet, who has been riding her bicycle to chorus rehearsals since she
moved here in 1966, says "I love the
way he communicates with us, and
he has a relationship with the students that I don't think anyone else
had." Sasha Leinster 'Ol explains that
the rehearsals "are really rewarding
because I can actually see us making
progress as we're working...under
John's direction, we really come together."
In addition to the Bach's
Magnificat, Friday's program includes motets by Tomas Luis de
Victoria and a Gregorian Chant to be
sung by the Swarthmore College
Chamber Choir, also under the direction of John Alston. Like the
Magnificat, Victoria's works were
intended for a religious audience.
Whereas Bach wrote according to a
Lutheran perspective, however,
Victoria's work is colored by his
Catholic tradition.
Another of Bach's works, the
Concerto for Oboe, Violin, and
continuo will also be performed in
the concert honoring Savage. Erin
Denny '99 and Eva Allan 'OO will
solo on oboe and violin, respectively,
and will be accompanied by the
Chamber Orchestra as conducted by
James Freeman. Freeman explains
the mysterious past of the piece: "The
history of the concerto is fairly complicated. We know Bach wrote a concerto for oboe and violin, but it's lost.

they hear?
"I play a lot of songs that have to do
with love," remarked Boe. While the
show is classified as "rock" in WSRN's
schedule grid, he described the eclectic
playlist as "pretty/poppy/singersongwritery." Last Friday, that included
The Builders and Edith Frost.
But Prince and Semisonic lie closer
to home for Boeâ literally "I still love
them, because they're hometown heroes," said the Minneapolis native, whose
t-shirt that day read "Minneapolis Crisis
Nursery," a children's crisis center at
which he volunteered. "I'm pro Minneapolis."
Though his signs are undoubtedly
well known, Boe has no idea how many
people tune in to his show. Last Friday,
someone called to ask what songs he
played; but lots of times, he gets no calls
at all. On some afternoons, 10 to 15
people may show up, and on others, just
one.
"It's never fun to be in a studio with
just two people" lamented Boe, who
speaks in a slightly raspy voice. "It's always more fun to be in a studio with
nine."
Party or no party, Patrick Boe's music interests extend beyond Pretty Boy.
This semester marks his first as Promotions Director for WSRN, and he occasionally writes album reviews for The
Phoenix. When Boe himself turns on
WSRN, he mostly listens to rock, but particularly admires "Cipher Spot," a hiphop show.
Though Boe listened to college radio at home, he had no previous broadcasting experience before Pretty Boy.
Now that his fame precedes him, could
radio be a long-term career goal?
No, he said. "I'm just up there broadcasting for the fun of it."

However, there exists a concerto for
two harpsichords in which the right
hand parts of the two soloists are
wildly different from each other
(most unusual), one being full of
violinistic figuration, the other being
much more like a part for a solo wind
instrument and having a more limited range. For these reasons, we
are all but certain that the two-harpsichord concerto is Bach's arrangement of his now lost oboe/violin concerto. So the piece that will be heard
on Friday is actually a reconstruction
from the two-harpsichord concerto."
Freeman also explainshow this
piece and its soloists were selected.
Denny and Allan "played this piece
so beautifully at last year's Orchestra Concerto Competition that I
thought it would be a shame if they
didn't have the opportunity to play it
with orchestra for a public audience."
The rest of the Orchestra members
were chosen "from the mos-t advanced players in the College Orchestra." Freeman also notes the special opportunities that the Chamber
Orchestra gives to its performers:
"The chance to rehearse and perform
music for chamber orchestra (generally from the 18th and 20th centuries, not the 19th from which the
great bulk of the music for large orchestra comes) in situations that
more closely resemble those of professional orchestras (a very limited
number of rehearsals, not across a semester but only close to the performance)."

Also taking part in the concert
are professionals recruited from the
larger musical community. Mezzo
soprano Alison Harvey and bass Eric
Owen will sing with the Chorus,
bringing to Swarthmore talent which
has graced the Washington Opera and
Paris Opera, among other companies.
By bringing together the vocal and
instrumental talent of the Swarthmore
community and visiting guests with the
distinguished compositions of Bach
and Victoria, the concert in honor of
Gisela Savage offers audience members a singular musical experience.
The coming together of so many Swarthmore musicians for a single performance provides not only an accomplished program, but it celebrates and
renews the community to which Savage dedicated so much enthusiasm.

College explores spending options

could be as low as $BO million or as high
as $2OO million. Yetrealistically, the group
is only proposing a plan which requires
$BO-90 million. In addition, it will be years
before these plans are begun and may take
several years for them to be completed.
Capital must beraised, architects mustbid
on the jobs and plans must be drafted before work can begin.
"If we didit today it wouldn't go into
the ground until three years from now,"
says Schall, "but the [capital] campaign
hasn't even started" at this point.
A capital campign is the method by
which the college will raise the money for
these projects. According to Suzanne
Welsh, treasurer, the money will not come
from tuition or the endowment; it's completely seperate. Welch says that as a college we are fortunate to have a balanced
budget and a substantial endowment; however, "all existing funds are already supporting the various programs we offer."
These include scholarships, financial aid,
salaries, and a long list of items on the
college budget. Because enrollment is
fairly steady, and the college does not wish
to greatly increase the cost oftuition, there
are also no new funds. This means that

fundraising is necessary.
The name of the game is. a capital
campaign, which last took place on a
major level in the mid-1980s. The campaign organizers must first determine a
campaign goal, then proceed to raise the
money over a 4-5 year period. The upcoming campaign will likely'be directed
at alumni, although Welsh suggests the
possibility that some companies and corporations may be involved. Schall adds
that this type of fundraising does not entail phone calls to alumni for $2O donations. Rather, it demands contacting patrons, and perhaps-even visiting them in
order to communicate the needs ofthe college and obtain adequately substantial
contributions.
Swarthmore is still in the planning
stages of the proposed capital campaign,
which presumably will start in 1-2 years.
The fundraising will encompass the needs
of all areas of the college, not justfacilities. Right now, says Welsh, the Planning
Committee and its various subcommittees, (such as academics, financial aid,
admissions, and others), are in the process of"coming up with a wish list." Each
group is evaluating their present and anticipated needs and their importance of
each.

debate far from over

by Sam Evans
Contributing Writer
Swarthmore College Public
Safety this week continued its
investigation ofthe vandalism of
the Intercultural Center, pursuing leads and submitting evidence to a private lab for analysis. Meanwhile, organizers of
the rally in support of the IC
called the event a success, and
several campus organizations
including the Diversity Working
Group of Student Council further pursued the issues and goals
that were brought up at the rally.
Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave reported that
contact has been made with a
number of people in the vicinity
of the IC near the time the vandalism occurred. Interviews
have indicated that additional
individuals linked by time and
location to the incident may be
able to provide information, and
Public Safety is currently seeking contact with those individuals.
Redgrave also said that the
evidence taken from the IC was
being analyzed this week at a
private lab. Whether
the material is in fact
feces or vomit may
prove "valuable information for the
college community,"
Redgrave said. Last
week, Redgrave had
held offtesting ofthe
evidence, explaining
that Public Safety
was "waiting for the
appropriate time."
The circumstances behind
the incident have been somewhat unclear, and rumors on
campus last week suggested
what appeared to be feces may
have been cake. Janine Gent '99,
the first to report the vandalism
to Public Safety on Sunday
night, expressed doubts from the
start about whether the material
was feces. The- rest, however,
"smelled and looked like vomit."
Gent said that while she didn't
necessarily see the incident as a
hate crime upon discovering the
material, she thought it did look
intentional and mean-spirited.
Redgrave said that most of
the facts were "up in the air" at
this point. Redgrave hesitated to
draw strong conclusions on the
circumstances or motives behind
the incident, and said the department would "try to be scientific
about this." Although nothing
yet identifies the incident conclusively as a hate crime,
Redgrave said they were "certainly not" ruling such a possibility out.
Redgrave noted that both the
initial incident and the current
investigation have been highly
visible on campus, and indicated
that at this point, the department
is "keeping an ear to the ground"
and awaiting feedback from the
campus that could lend clues to
the investigation.
In the meantime, rally organizers from SAO and SQU expressed satisfaction with how
the rally had went, and said they
were pleased with the effect of
the rally on the campus.
Ben Maulbeck '99, co-coordinator of SQU, was also "very
pleased" with the rally. Noting
that the rally has received a positive response as well as criticism, he said he was glad that
the rally inspired dialQuge.
Maulbeck said that such dialogue on diversity had spread to
the classroom and outside ofthe
typical nexus of activity the IC,

Diversity Coalition, and the
BCC.
When queried, Maulbeck
agreed that there may be a gap
between those inside and outside this collection of student
groups in terms of engagement
in the diversity debate. He attributed such a gap to "a lot ofreasons," and speculated that some
students may feel less affected
by the diversity debate, or may
not perceive themselves as welcome participants in it what
he called "an image problem."
Maulbeck emphasized that
"the most important thing" was
that the administration and Public Safety were taking the incident and the investigation seriously. Often, Maulbeck said, the
administration can condone
such acts through silence and
thus give tacit permission for
them to continue.
The matter of whether the
material was cake or feces,
Maulbeck noted, does matter,
"if only in the sheer audacity of
the crime." Maulbeck added that
it was "clearly something designed to be gross," and said he
wouldn't have pushed for a rally

had he believed the act to have
been completely accidental.
Jenny Yang 'OO, president of
SAO, said she believed that the
rally "did get through to
people," citing e-mails she has
received from those previously
uninvolved with the debate expressing their support. She did
admit that since "we all have
lives," campus community
members would not necessarily
be engaged in the discussion all
the time.
Yang said she saw the IC
incident as a kind of "reality
check" for people's lives, an
opportunity to learn something
from a negative happening. For
now, she said she was "living
withthe possibility" that the perpetrators will not be found. To
her personally, she said, catching the perpetrators would be a
"fleeting, short-term solution."
Regarding the ambiguity of the
motives behind the vandalism,
Yang said that at the very least,
the act "was stupid," and represented "a blatant show of disrespect" for the space.
At the rally, several suggestions for institutional changes at
the College were offered in the
areas of curriculum requirements, hate-response procedures, and "diversity-related resources" available to the campus. The Diversity Working
Group of Student Council held
an open meeting Wednesday
night in. Parrish Parlors to address the role of the Council in
debate and action on the diversity issue, as well as to gather
student input regarding how the
Council might pursue such concerns. Discussion at the meeting covered a broad range of
topics, including the possibility
of adding a full-time
multicultural dean, adding some
kind of social justice requirement to the curriculum, improving faculty participation in diversity seminars, and arranging

high-profile, diversity-related
speaking events on campus. Participants also reviewed the
College's hate speech policy,
and addressed ideas for the role
of Student Council, other campus groups, and the Administration in a coordinated response
to hate crisis situations.
Gloria Chan 'O2, an advice
representative serving Diversity
Coalition, reported that the Coalition has been working with the
Deans' staff to push for a fulltime Dean of Multicultural Affairs position. The DC has also
met with the Provost to discuss
a possible social justice requirement, and is encouraging the
Admissions Department to advertise in a more diverse range
of media, including those targeted at minority groups.
Chan emphasized that the
dean proposal was currently the
most important on the agenda.
Such a dean could organize conferences, speaking events, and
faculty seminars on diversity,
and serve as a resource for students, she said.
This proposed dean role
might expand upon the responsibilities of Anna
Maria Cobo and
Tim Sams, both Assistant Deans. Cobo
spends halfher time
as overseer of the
IC, which includes
SAO, HOLA, and
SQU. Half of Sams'
time is spent as
manager of the
BCC's programs.
The other half of
Cobo and Sams' responsibilities
are with "general student affairs." Chan suggested that these
positions do not fit the need being pursued, emphasizing that
the proposed position would include diversity responsibilities
directly within the Dean role,
would serve the entire student
body and faculty, and could
serve as aresources for students.
Although plans for possible
changes in curriculum requirements are by no means certain
at present, several suggestions
for a social justice or similar requirement were raised. Such a
requirement could take the form
of qualifying courses from several departments, or new interdisciplinary or team-taught
courses spanning departments.
Some participants expressed concerns for adding yet
another curriculumrequirement,
especially one that could endorse a certain angle or viewpoint. Others argued that such a
requirement would be compatible with the College's mission
statement. The issue is currently
being discussed in the Dean's
Advisory Council, where member Zoe Whitley 'Ol reported
that concerns were being raised
about the distinction between a
requirement for social justice
versus social responsibility.
This first meeting of the
Diversity Working Group had
been planned well in advance of
the IC incident last week. Group
chair Jared Solomon 'Ol said he
pursued the idea in the interest
of establishing and clarifying
Student Council's role in the
diversity debate, strengthening
the connections between SCand
other student organizations, and
gather input from the student
body on what course of action
SC should pursue.

House Republicans selected new members of their

Board of Managers agree to match gifts
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer

In an effort to increase
alumni participation in annual
giving, members of the Board of
Managers will match dollar-fordollar new gifts from alumni in
the past 15 graduating classes.
The board decided to make
the offer, which will be good for
the next two years, at its September meeting. The decision
will be announced to alumni in
the fall annual giving letter,
which is being mailed this
month.
Although the annual fund

raised 14 percent more than expected last year, alumni participation was only just over 50
percent, according to President
Al Bloom. "The classes between one and 15 years out have
the lowest rate of participation
in the Annual Fund," said Vice
President Maurice Eldridge.
The board set no limit on the
amount its members will match,
although the offer only applies
to alumni who have never given
to the College before. Some
board members have already increased their personal giving by
10 percent in anticipation ofthe
new
contributions,
said

Eldridge.
The board will evaluate the
program after two years and will
consider continuing it for a third
if it is successful.
As Bloom explained,
alumni donors have offered
matching grants in the past,
most recently for senior gifts.
Several years ago, matching
funds were also offered at the
end of a funding campaign.
The College's overall financial position improved slightly
since the endowment has
bounced back from some of its
losses early this semester. The
endowment, which supports
about 40 percent ofthe college's

operating revenues, now has a
market value of almost $B3O
million, down from the July
peak of $BBl million. Also, according to Eldridge, students
working for the alumni telethon
have received more donations so
far this semester than in all of
the last academic year.
Tuition and fees, including
financial aid paid for by the
College, only provide about half
ofSwarthmore's annual operatingrevenues. "We all need to appreciate how much the education of each student is underwritten by alumni who came
before," Bloom said.

Student
Council
Update
by Josh Miller
News Editor
With little debate, Student
Council passed an amendment
to its constitution prohibiting
any council member except the
Charter Chair from simultaneously serving on Student
Budget Committee.
The
amendment, proposed by Christopher Sajdera 'Ol easily won
the two-thirds vote it needed to
pass.
After a brief but intense debate, SC passed a motion to ask
representatives from the Student
Activities Committee to appear
before SC in two weeks and provide a line-by-line account of
recent SAC spending. Matt
Schwartz 'Ol proposed the motion in response to rumors about
the misuse or mismanagement
of SAC funds. Christopher
Sajdera strongly objected to and
cast the only vote against
Schwartz's motion in a 6-1 vote
in favor with two members abstaining.
With December elections
approaching, Hugh Weber 'OO
asked for a council member to
volunteer to serve as Elections
Chair. No one did. Weber said
that so far only four or five students have declared their candidacy for any offices, and he
noted that a position on the College Judiciary Committee is also
up for election and was mistakenly omitted from SC's election
announcement.

Craig getting
accustomed
as new Chief
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer
Brian Craig has been
Swarthmore's Chief of Police
for over a month and is beginning to settle into his role in the
Swarthmore community. During the first month of his tenure,
the new chief has received email from borough residents and
has discussed concerns with
residents.
Chief Craig and Swarthmore Mayor Bill Cumby met
over lunch with college officials
Owen Redgrave, Director of
Public Safety, and Larry Schall,
Vice President forFacilities and
Services, on October 21. In a
broad, getting-to-know-you discussion, they talked about what
seems to be the touchstone issue between the college and police this fall: underage drinking.
In a Phoenix interview,
Craig emphasized that the Swarthmore police officers want to
have positive contact with students on campus. "We're not
going over there [to the College]
to look to instigate anything
other than a routine patrol that
takes us in the area," said Craig.
The police are, however,
"sworn officers," and if they see
underage drinking, Craig continued, it is their duty to take
action. Craig asserts that if
drinking moves off campus or
results in behavior that draws
police to campus, then it becomes a police issue. He hopes
students will drink legally and
responsibly.
Redgrave and Craig agreed
there is a productive dynamic
between Public Safety and the
Swarthmore Police Department.
"We're working together to
make the campus a safe place
to go to school," said Craig.
Craig recently asked his officers to identify their top 10
concerns and will use their lists
to create a plan of action. His
priorities right now include acquiring new vehicles for foul
winter weather and further computerizing the department. The
new chief is also planning to
implement an alert record system, which would forward police reports via computer to the
state and FBI instead of having
an officer compile a paper report.

Female cagers
start season

by Tony Sturm
Staff Writer

Months of intense preparation are about to pay off for the
women's basketball team, which
opens its season tonight in the
college's first annual Tip-Off
Tournament, sponsored by the
Friends ofSwarthmore Athletics.
A 6 p.m. contest between
Clarkson and Elms will precede
the Garnet's 1998-99 8 p.m. debut against the squad from Eastem College.
The team scrimmaged
Albright and Neumann during the
week to gain competitive experience and to allow different lineups to play together. The format
of the scrimmages consisted ofa
twenty minute period, followed
by a ten minute period, and another twenty minute period.
Against Albright, the team
struggled to stay composed and
committed many costly turnovers. Lack of communication
between players on the court was
another problem.
"The Albright scrimmage
was a little sloppy. However, it
helped us to target those things
that we need to work on, including ourpress break," commented
Coach Adrienne Shibles.
"I think we did well considering it was the first time we
played together as a whole team
against someone besides ourselves," said Amber Adamson
'Ol.
Heather Kile 'O2, Emily
Gray' 02, and Heather Marandola
'Ol all scored in double digits for
the Garnet.
The Garnet made the appropriate adjustments and came out
fired up for the scrimmage against
the Neumann Knights.
"The scrimmage at Neumann
showed how much improvement
our team could make in just afew
days. Our defense was really beginning to come together nicely,"
said Caitlin Ryland 'O2.
The squad won the first period 30-25, narrowly lost the second by a basket, and lost the final
period by a few points.
"The team looked much
more composed
against
Neumann," said Shibles. "Three
first-year players led the team in
scoring, which is very promismg.
"The team has a lot of depth,"
noted Ryland. "So many members of the team are incredible
athletes. It is just a matter of getting all of the individual talents
and athleticism to mesh into one
dominant force on the court."
Shibles agreed, saying "This
year, everyone can score. All five
positions on the court are solid."
Apparently, word of the
Garnet's talent and ambitions
has spread outside the Swarthmore community. The Centennial Conference coaches' preseason poll had the Garnet
slated to finish fourth in the
eastern side. However, one
team (and coaches are not allowed to vote for their own
team) picked Swat to come in
first place.
With all these factors in their
favor, the Garnet aim to start off
their season strong by winning the
Tip-Off Tournament.
"I am very thankful for the
support of FOSA for sponsoring the tournament. It is a great
opportunity to showcase our
fabulous facility and kick off
our season at home," said

Gettysburg College was on
the receiving end of a thumping
handed out by the Swarthmore
Men's Rugby Team, who
avenged, a season which had not
gone as well as it could have.
The Buzzards tripled their total
points scored this season Saturday, November 7th, scoring an
impressive seven tries in their
45-15 victory.
Led by Tony Sturm '99, who
slipped into the try zone aremarkable four times, Swarthmore
Gettysburg.
dominated
Gettysburg looked like they might
have had a chance early but could
not hang with Swarthmore. Despite an extremely ugly first half,

opponent is Eastern, who finished with a record of 8-16 last
year. They are returning three
starters from last year, including leading scorer Desiree
Lothian (13.3 ppg). In the other
match-up, Clarkson finished 717 last year. Four key players
return from last season, including leading scorer Patty
McTigue (10.3 ppg/7.5 rpg).
Elms College had a winless season last year.
The team is excited for the
season to be underway.
"I am excited for the team to
come together. We all are such
good friends off the court that I
think we will be able to play with
one another tremendously well,"
said Adamson.
The consolation game of
the tournament will be played
a t 6 p.m. Saturday, and the
Championship game will follow
at 8 p.m.

Wrestling team
kicks off season
by Anne Frankenfield

Staff Writer

This week the wrestling team
hosted the annual Swarthmore
Takedown Tournament. Participating teams included Gloucester,
Gallaudet, Middlesex, Ursinus, and
Valley Forge. In this unique tournament, participants receive points
only fortakedowns (controlling position). When one competitor executes a takedown, scoring 1 or 2
points, the two stop wrestling, start
over in neutral position, and begin
again. This continues for 3 minutes
until the wrestler with the most
points wins. Several rounds are
wrestled until a winner for each
weight class can be determined.
Eight wresders competed for
the Swat team. Will Williams 'O2
(141 lbs.), Ted Chan 'O2 (165 lbs),
Les Fox 'O2 (184 lbs), Keith
McManimen 'O2 (184 lbs), Adrian
Wilson'99(l4l lbs),MattKahn'99
(174 lbs), Jesse Bean 'OO (165 lbs),
and Ben Gaines 'Ol (157 lbs).
Ofthose eightindividuals, three
placed within the top four of their
weightclasses, the best showing by
the Garnet in this particular tournament Wilson took top honors at 141
lbs, McManimen finished 3rd in his
respective weight class, and Gaines
finished 4th at 157 lbs. Kahn commented on the team's performance
saying that"the guys did incredibly
well and I was impressed. It was
me best Takedown Tournament that
we have had since 1989 when the
Tournament was started."
This weekend, on Saturday, the

the victors were able to keep
pounding the points up on the
board throughout the game and
put it out ofreach by early in the
second half. Sturm scored early
to put Swat up 7-0 with his conversion, but the Buzzards blew a
couple of golden opportunities as
they dropped passes in the open
field leading to turnovers.
Storm scored again before
Gettysburg threatened and scored.
Swarthmore looked as though
they had successfully completed
a goalline stand when they gained
a scrum. However, Swarthmore
lost the scrum and Gettysburg

But Swat answered quickly,
as they quickly noticed that there
was a mismatch between the back
lines of the two teams and exploited their advantage. Sturm ran
a punt back 40 meters before
passing the ball to Sid Ganesan
'OO, who had done an excellent
job supporting the play. Ganesan
then sprinted into the tryzone,
dodging two defenders, for
Swarthmore'sfinal try ofthe half.
Sturm scored early in the
second half, and when Elijah
Porter 'OO scored on the same
play he gained a cut requiring
stitches, it was clear that Swarthmore was in charge.

should not be considered a serious obstacle to the Garnet's
mission to climb up the standings and improve on last year's
performance.

Personnel:

Swarthmore returns key
starter and All-Conference 2nd
team guard Tim Schofield '99,
who averaged 16.5 ppg and
made 45 three-pointers last
season. Aside from the open
point guard slot, the team's
starting lineup from last year
consists of all returning players, a continuity which bodes
well for the team's prospects.
The team also adds much
needed height to its roster with
the addition of 6'7" David
Grammill 'O2 and 6'4" Kyle
Lewis 'O2. The Garnet also finished last in the conference in
rebounding in 1998.
Coaching Staff:
Two years ago, head coach
Lee Wimberly led a 16-12
squad to the Centennial Conference finals and into the
ECAC Tournament. Assistants
Kirk Daulerio '95, who spent
time in the CBA, and Kevin
Small, who knows the ins and
outs of conference play after
stints at Haverford and
Ursinus, are knowledgeable additions.
The Garnet should win at
least four or five games in the
conference, and perhaps twelve
to thirteen contests overall. It
is not impossible to imagine

them making an eleven-game
turnaround in a twenty-four
game season.
Swarthmore gets a chance to
prove itself early with matches
against Union and Skidmore at

the Bth annual Equinox Classic
this weekend. They will play today at Haverford against
Skidmore at 6 p.m. on Nov. 20
and will face Union at 3 p.m. tomorrow in Tarble.

NYU surprised McCrann and
