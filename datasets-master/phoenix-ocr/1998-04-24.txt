Package with Merit Component

Bloom Packs
Parlors
by Owen F. Lipsett
In an attempt to clarify student concerns over the newly expanded Swarthmore Scholars Program, President
Al Bloom and members of the senior
staff held a meeting on Thursday
night in Parrish Parlors.
Bloom made the meeting's focus
clear from the outset. He carefully
differentiated between merit-based
aid or "aid given outside a student's
assessed need" and the Swarthmore
Scholarships, which replace alreadyawarded loans with grants.
Swarthmore's dilemma, according to
Bloom, lies in reconciling the concepts of offering aid packages "comparable" to those of competing colleges while still maintaining "as equitable packages as possible among
students." Bloom cited Swarthmore's
long-standing commitment not to
award merit-based aid, with the exception of the McCabe scholarships
which were endowed before the decision was made.
Earlier this year, schools such as

Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford,

aggressive financial aid packages to
lure accepted students. Swarthmore,
according to Bloom, found itself
faced with the prospect of either doing nothing and losing some students
they considered valuable, or conducting what he called "a one year experiment" by increasing the number
of Swarthmore Scholars from 19 to
35. Bloom cited the success of the
two-year-old program in providing
Swarthmore with more racially diverse classes. He followed by opening the floor to questions from the
40 odd students who attended the
discussion.
Tara Zahra '9B, an Admissions Fellow who made the financial aid
policy public in a debate last weekend, requested clarification of the
criteria used to award the scholarships, and expressed concern that
they might stratify the Swarthmore
community. Associate Dean of Admissions Jim Bock explained that
potential scholars were selected by
theAdmissions Office from the pool
ofadmitted students who had applied
for financial aid. These selections
were thenreviewed by the Financial
Aid Office to determine if the students qualified for the aid. Bloom
added that the scholarships should
not be seen as a lack of aid for the
students who do not receive them.

Class of 2000 will be roughly

In a major move for Swarthmore
Admissions and Financial Aid, the
College has offered scholarships with
what many consider to be a meritbased component to some 100 prospective members of the class of 2002.
The four-year scholarships, averaging
nearly $23,000 a piece, are designed
specifically to compete with recently
enhanced scholarship programs at
Princeton, Yale, and Stanford.
Individuals involved in admissions
and financial aid issues characterize
the program as a response on the part
the administration and the Board of
Managers to expanded scholarship
programs at Princeton, Yale, Stanford,
Williams, and Amherst with which
Swarthmore competes for students.
The scholarship program replaces
the loan and summer work components of a financial aid package with
grants that need not be repaid. The average four-year value of each of the
scholarships is $22,600, costing the
college approximately $BOO,OOO over
four years. The full four-year cost for
the Swarthmore Scholars in the Class
of 2001 will be approximately
$140,000; the equivalent cost for the

Around one-eighth of the students
recently admitted to the class of 2002
were offered one of the scholarships.
All had demonstrated financial need
and would have qualified for financial
aid in any case, but the grants that were
awarded would not have been awarded
without the scholarship program and
without the selection by the Admissions Office.
The Admissions Office selects the
students for a variety of reasons. "They
are selected on the basis of excellent
scholarship, personal qualities, diversity of background, and special talents
and interests," says Robin Mamlet,
Dean of Admissions. Mamlet and
President Al Bloom suggest that the
scholarships are designed to help Admissions attract students that Swarthmore needs for a well-rounded class
who might otherwise be drawn to other
top colleges.
The new scholarships represent an
expansion of the Swarthmore Scholars Program, which has existed on a
limited and largely unpublicized basis
for the classes of 2000 and 2001. There

BEHIND THE SCENES

Decision Made By
Top Administrators
by Nate Stulman
The recent decision to offer "differential packaging" was made by
the senior staff and the Board of
Managers earlier this year with
some input from students and faculty, but without widespread publicity.
Earlier this year, the BOM gave
discretionary authority to the administration to design a program to
respond to changes in financial aid
at other colleges. The shift in aid
policy at Swarthmore has been
largely unpublicized, but administrators stress that the decision was
a public one that involved student
and faculty representatives to the
College Budget Committee.
Only in the last two weeks was
the College Planning Committee's
(CPC) subgroup on Admissions and
Financial Aid informed of the decision to expand the Swarthmore
Scholars Program.
Assistant Professor of Political
Science Meta Mendel-Reyes, a
member of the CPC Financial Aid

subgroup, believes the college community should be involved in the decision as to whether to offer the scholarships next year. "It certainly seems
to raise questions about whether a
merit-based system is being combined with a financial aid program.
My understanding is that there was a
great deal of urgency that was felt by
the Board and the senior staff in making the changes."
Associate Provost and Professor of
Psychology Barry Schwartz suggests
the decision to expand Swarthmore
Scholars was a "desperation measure"
to respond to the financial aid changes
at other schools. "I think it a very serious issue. I think it is critical that
some sort of long term policy be developed to deal with the issue because
the competition will only increase. If
the number of 'special aid packages'
gets large enough it will have an effect on everybody in the community,"
he says.
The Swarthmore Scholars Program
was generally unknown to the college

THE MARKETPLACE

Fierce Competition Drives Scholarships
by Nate Stulman
Swarthmore's decision to offer
financial aid packages that give
preferences to select students is
the result of intense competition
among leading colleges and universities for top prospective students.
Competition for top students
amongelite colleges has been particularly keen this year. According to Dean ofAdmissions Robin
Mamlet, letters of acceptance
from Harvard, Yale, Williams, and
Amherst included the explicit and
startling stipulation that each
would match the financial aid offers of other schools. According
to President Al Bloom, Swarthmore cannot afford and is not interested in matching such offers,
but the administration feels it
would be irresponsible to not re-

spond to the changes.
"I don't like having to offer differential packaging. But we
wouldn't have the class we want
without it. The situation is likely
to get worse given the intense
competition among schools. Having comparable packages to other
schools is important to attracting
top students, especially students
of color," says Bloom.
Swarthmore has traditionally
maintained that the choice of
which college or university to attend should be independent of financial need. "In theory, we want
students to make their choice
based on the fit between the student and the college. Meanwhile
we have always offered better aid
than most other colleges, and have
probably gotten students who we
shouldn't have, based purely on
the money. Now other schools are

boosting their aid and we're concerned they will take our students
based purely on the money," says
Barry Schwartz, Associate Provost
and Professor of Psychology.
Much of the increased competition can be attributed to a 1989 U.S.
Justice Department anti-trust investigation. The federal investigation
looked at two dozen top colleges
and universities that met yearly to
agree upon common financial aid
offers in order to avoid bidding for
students, forming what was essentially an illegal price-fixing cartel.
By 1991, the Justice Department
had forced the cartel
known as
the Overlap Group
to disband
through a consent decree. Swarthmore was not a member of the
Overlap Group because it offered
McCabe scholarships, which are
merit scholarships.
Princeton, which first alarmed
colleges and universities nationwide by using expanded financial
aid programs to compete for top
students, has increased the percent
of grants in its aid packages as well.
"Princeton will not require any student loan when a family's income
falls below $40,000 (roughly the
national median)," notes a
Princeton press release. "For these
students Princeton will entirely replace the current loan requirement
with additional scholarship aid. In
addition, Princeton will reduce its
loan requirement for students with
family incomes between $40,000
and $57,500,"
Yale's new financial aid measures
are also aimed at enlarging the

Walking A Fine Line
As Sunday's debate made clear, besides being the most competitive
class Swarthmore has ever admitted, the Class of 2002 will also have a
significant number of students receiving aid as Swarthmore Scholars.
(See story on frontpage.) While a small number of Swarthmore students
have received such aid in the past as a result of the McCabe Scholarships, the sudden increase in the number of recipients to an eighth of the
incoming class is quite a leap.
Opponents of the change cite an erosion of the ever ambiguous and
therefore eminently invocable "Swarthmore values" which they feel are
violated by the change. Suddenly one eighth ofthe class is "more equal"
than the others. With the competitive college admissions game already
at a level where slight differences in grades determine acceptance, the
adoption of a new level of competition seems like an unnecessary escalation of an already tenuously credible process.
Swarthmore, however, has for better or worse has already begun to
enter a new era. With shallow U.S. News and World Report rankings
serving as dubious guides, many more high school seniors are aware of

Swarthmore, and the number of applicants and average SAT scores of
incoming Swarthmore classes have been rising. This year represents
record levels for both. As Swarthmore's appeal has begun to shift from
its unique environment, to its prestige and selectivity. As a "top school,"
Swarthmore concerns itself now with attracting not only top students
but "the top of the top students" to quote Prof. Bruce Morrison of the
Political Science Department, who argued in Sunday's debate. With
other comparable schools already wooing students with offers of better
financial aid packages, Swarthmore had in many ways little choice to
join this trend. Inexorably, the late twentieth century American obsession with superstars has in this way entered yet another area.
Much more disturbing, however, is the secrecy and speed of the decision, akin to that reached on PC support. Numerous students have remarked with some accuracy that the input of the student body only seems
to be solicited on matters of little consequence. Students are not even
given a chance to comment on larger matters, leading an a dangerous "Iit" relationship that objectifies students. In addition, little has been said
about the accompanying increase in the summer work contribution for
the summer aid packages of all other Swatties receiving aid. This discrepancy presents a troubling situation in which the "less worthy"
Swatties pay more so that the new "Swarthmore Scholars" can pay less.
This carnivorous financial tiering of Swarthmore is at best ill-conceived
and more probably exceedingly harmful. In addition, tuition continues
to grow for all Swatties at one percent above inflation every year, further coloring the situation.
While the new Swarthmore Scholars program firmly establishes Swarthmore as a player near the pinnacle of the fin de siecle American competitive college admissions world, it brings with it numerous questions.
Some, such as those involving tuition have simple solutions. If Swarthmore, in good Quaker style, took a short hiatus from tuition and contribution wages, the entire community would benefit and suspicions of
elitism would be partially allayed. It would have some financial cost,
but would raise the level of respect for the administration among students. The question of secrecy is thornier, since disclosure is always a
touchy issue. While it is quite possible the establishment of the Swarthmore Scholars program required such decisive action, the decision to
begin to support PCs certainly did not, thereby fitting an established
pattern. Until the administration deals with these issues more openly,
students will rightly question the manner in which it makes important
decisions.

With the campus controversies seeming to pile up on top of each other
as the semester grinds to a close, the role of student government in campus life has undeniably become more visible. We believe that every
student on campus needs to meet the challenge of increased SC action
and accountability. Participation in SC elections in recent history has
been anemic at best, and so we feel that for students to be adequately
represented, they need to be responsible for reading the platforms (pages
most importantly
voting
6-7), considering the controversies, and
in the election.
Voting is an essential first step in building more trust and respect for
student government. The people who take it upon themselves to work in
public posts on this campus do so on the most part because they care,
and because issues that concern them are issues that they feel should
concern the whole student body. The people who will be elected can't
operate in a vacuum, where they are the only ones interested in what
goes on at Swat. Everyone needs to shoulder some of the responsibility
of the future.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Basenese: I Was Not Wronged, I Wronged Myself
To the Editor:
I am writing in response to several letters
published in previous editions of The Phoenix in relation to my suspension from Swarthmore College earlier this semester. As time

has allowed countless versions ofthe incident
to accumulate, burying the facts somewhere
amidst the rumors, I will not in any way attempt to untangle this mess. What actually
occurred that night is of little importance to
any now. What happens as a result is what
should concern us most.
I will be the first to admit and am forced to
confront daily the fact that I made a mistake.
Despite my supporters and dear friends' beliefs that I was wronged, I thank them for their
genuine concern and compassion, but in reality I wronged myself. By allowing my emotions to get the best of me and by acting in
such an inappropriate manner, I jeopardized
the environment for which Swarthmore is best
known. My actions forced another student to
undoubtedly fear an environment in which he
should feel safe and comfortable.
As far as the punishment I received by acting in such a contradictory and unacceptable
manner I placed my fate in the hands of another, more universal authority
the administration. Although I personally may not have
agreed with the College's official decision, I
certainly deserved the punishment. By accepting to attend Swarthmore College one con-

their actions in accordance
with the principles established by the institution principles created long before any
of us wandered into McCabe for the first
time and principles founded upon the basic
notion of promoting a wholesome and safe
environment. Whether one's consent is a
conscious decision or one of compliance
simply by attendance is of little consequence, it is still consent. Although as students we are able to influence and adapt
these principles in time, it is not possible,
nor reasonable to think that we can ignore
them. My actions earlier this semester were
in clear ignorance and disrespect of everything the College promotes.
So even if one feels that I was a victim of
the system, unjustly punished or whatever
other phrase was used to describe my situation, it is my own fault. And for those of
you who feel I got what I deserved, you are
right. In an emotional state I chose to act in
a manner that jeopardized everything I had
worked so hard for in the past years (gaining acceptance, succeeding academically,
artistically, athletically and most importantly making friendships that would endure) and everything the College has
worked so hard to maintain over the years.
Had I been given this equation moments
before I acted so ignorantly, my choice
would have been simple. I, however, did not
sents to govern

choose to think about the severity and conse 1
quences of my actions and have been pun
ished accordingly. My suggestion is to take
heed to this advice. As I so ignorantly
stroyed the trust of one student in the safety
of the College; it is time to rebuild that trust;
The only way this trust will be restored is
with open and forgiving dialogue. I know that
for my friends and supporters alike that such
advice is hard to swallow, that it is hard to
forgive when people are unexpectedly taken
away; but, I ask ofyou to forgive me for making you have to deal with these issues and
please forgive Mark. He is not to blame and
should no longer be a tangible manifestation
of my absence. Mark, and similarly his
friends and supporters, should be able to live
without fear of physical confrontation and
threat and roam the confines of Swarthmore
knowing that it is okay to relax and feel comfortable, just as any other student should. As
the final weeks of classes wind down and
before each of us chooses to go our separate
ways for the summer, I ask in earnest that
my friends and supporters as well as Mark's
as it is also the right thing to do. Recognizing the difference between the right thing to
do and what we want to do is something that
comes naturally for all of us. Choosing, however, the right thing is that much more difficult, but that much more necessary.

Bulletin Article Insults Spirit of Swarthmore Athletics
To the Editor.
As an exile in Texas many miles
from my East Coast roots and
thirteen years from my days as
an undergraduate, I look forward
to receiving the Swarthmore College Bulletin. For the most part,
the articles are esoteric, informative, and well-written. In the
March 1998 issue, however, I
was astonished to see that a Swarthmore athlete's 'retirement
speech' was printed. I assumed
that there might be some substance or controversy to this story
so I read on. I'm sorry to report
that not only were my suspicions
and hopes not gratified, I was insulted.
The tone of Mr. Haskins'
mostly self-aggrandizing article
and the mere fact that anyone
from Beaver Falls otherthan Joe
Namath should be given such a
forum to publicly retire from athletics suggests that he was sent
from the Western Pennsylvania
hamlet toresurrect Swarthmore's
historically deplorable basketball
program. And, as Mr. Haskins
insightfully observes, all Divvy
111 hoops programs are, well, less
than competitive.
While it is healthy that Mr.
Haskins has dashed his dreams
of playing in the NBA few of
the players who starred in this
year's Final Four will be drafted
it is lamentable that for four
months out of the year he cannot
splurge two hours a day on honing the fundamentals of teamwork, lessons which will have as
much impact on his success in
business or politics as the analyti-

cal skills he nourishes in the
classroom and at McCabe. Unless, that is, he is planning on
opening a kiosk or runnig for office on the Moon. (Note: I sincerely doubt that any ofthis nonsense would have been printed
has the premise been how a Swarthmore sophomore ditched the
Philosophy department because
he found it was beneath his intellect. The hubris!)
On one point, however, I can
enthusiastically agree with Mr.
Haskins and that is that if he aspires to a life in politics, this
young man needs to spend as
much time as possible studying
that trade. For, from such impolitic generalizations as, "Division
111 athletics are perfect for a
school like Swarthmore where
sports are viewed primarily as a
release from the stresses of studying" and "the commitment necessary to be successful in Division I requires an enormous
amount of time that Swarthmore
students do not have because of
the College's high academic standards," one can only conclude
that Mr. Haskins has either: a)
not done his homework or b)
direly needs to enlist the services
of another typewriter. To compete on the level of Division I
schools does not necessarily require a surplus of time, as much
as an unusually high level of talent.

In 1985, the Swarthmore College baseball team posted the best
record in the school's history, 263; won the school's only birth to
the Division 111 World Series

tournament; and defeated La
Salle, a Division I powerhouse

which participated in the Division I World Series and finished
with a top fifteen national ranking.
And now for a little boorish
egocentricity: nearly every
starter on Swarthmore's 1985
baseball team was also recruited

Mr. Haskins, we found the tug

Kings is a very enjoyable play, with
tragedy, comedy, fight scenes and cross

and avoids for the most part any feeling
of dragging. Seeing all four of these

I am not an expert on relativism,

postmodernism or multiculturalism. I
am not an expert on anything, in fact.
But I know enough to discern that one
of the greatest conceptual difficulties
facing Swarthmore, and perhaps the
United States as a whole, is the puzzle
of reconciling the certainty of our ignorance with our desire to act resolutely.
•It has been determined by history
that the way people should resolve
disagreements and make decisions is
through reasoned discussion. The certainty of our ignorance comes from the
limitations of rational debate. I, for
one, will never again argue about the
existence of God unless it involves sex
or substantial remuneration. It'll always be the same argument, with the
same result; namely, no result at all.
It is certainly good that there is debate rather than silence, but the disagreements cannot be resolved
through debate. As Professor
Schuldenfrei likes to derisively point
out, the non-believer will always end
up saying, "But it's all justa matter of
faith." This is what happens when
people with differing fundamental assumptions which are essentially ardecide to have a deticles of faith

Jordan again proves thathe's at the top
of his craft, this time employing veteran
cinematographer Adrian Biddle to bring

bate about those fundamental assumptions. You cannot convert me by reason, nor can I convert you. Hell, you
can't even really make me understand.
What is left, then? Relativism and
postmodernism, while instilling a
sense of universal respect, also have
the tendency to make the marketplace
of ideas a stultifying superstore of
uncritical opinions and so-called
"truths." Additionally, it's literally
impossible to be a practicing relativist. Old-fashioned absolutism isn't so
appealing, either.
What ends up happening is that
people discover a thin universal human culture, a set ofideas that we can
agree and productively disagree about.
Basic moral principles, such as the
undesirability of murder, belong to this
set. of ideas because they rest on assumptions that nearly all human beings make. There is no truly universal
culture, as there will always be many
exceptions, but I'm sure there is something out there that's close enough. I
hope that the exceptions will be too
fay outnumbered to matter in the long

Uninformed and Intransigent
One of the latest footnotes to the news has

been the attempt of House members to petition their fellow members to bring the ShaysMeehan bill to an official vote. For those
unfamiliar with the bill, it is a campaign finance reform bill virtually identical to the
McCain-Feingold Bill, which is currently on
a very poor sort of life support in the Senate.
The bill would ban soft money, the large unregulated contributions given directly to political parties that have made a mockery ol
current campaign finance laws, and provide
reduced price airtime to candidates who remain with certain spending limits. While
these two provisions represent excellent constructive changes in a system where dollars
have increasingly become more important
than votes, they represent a threat to those who
benefit from the status quo.
As the campaign to reform
the American campaign finance system and has
stalled, this campaign itself
has shown many of the
structural flaws within our
system.
I spent my four high school summers interning at Common Cause, the country's largest public interest watchdog group, whose
offices ironically sit right across a downtown
Washington street from the National Association of Broadcasters. The latter, whose members would have to lose some advertising revenue if Shays-Meehan or McCain-Feingold
came into effect, bridles at such an idea because of the reduced-price airtime provision.
In addition if corporate money were
dekmphasized, broadcasters might have to
face a competitive market for their use of the
public airwaves, which they wish to avoid.
Already, the success of the Federal Communications Commission in selling licenses for

that benefits by charging for access to a public resource. The list of such corporate benefits recipients is long and painful and together
they make a strong front against reform.
Even more fundamentally, however, elected
officials fear reform. While many claim to
support it, this claim has often rung in times
such as the present when the matter has come
up for serious consideration. As Representatives are currently petitioning within the
House to bring the bill to a vote, over forty
Republicans who claim to support reform

have yet to join in attempting force a real
Congressional decision on the issue. Lawmakers tend to prefer the status quo in which
they affect support for a reform bill, thereby
gaining a bit ofrecognition in their districts,
but work in the background to slowly kill it.
This allows them to have their proverbial
cake yet to at the same time appear to be

both parties rely heavily on soft money and
other forms of revenue the bill would eliminate, the bill's morally fair provisions are
not beneficial to most House members. They

a chance to be counted.

Reading about recent developments, I
sensed a certain irony in the idea of elected
officials petitioning
each other. Gathering
the signatures of the
public in support of the
bill was one of Common Cause's main efforts last summer. Everyone from the organization's president,
Ann Mcßride, to interns such as myself went
to gather signatures from the public in
Washington's unpleasant summer weather.
As humorous as I found the idea of elected
officials doing the same, I laughed inwardly
with a sort of gallows humor. The 201 Representatives who have been courageous
enough to sign the petition still fall 17 below the number required to bring a reckoning to the House.
It will be much more difficult to get more
signatures in support of a measure forcing
Representatives to take a firm stand than for
the vote to succeed. Several years ago, the
GiftBan Act, the last piece ofreform legislation to become law, came to the Senate
floor after a struggle where it was unanimously approved. If the Shays-Meehan Bill
does come to the floor, it is likely to pass
since it represents a definite stand on the issue. The next battleground would be the
Senate. The American voting public, by
voicing its opinions to lawmakers, can help
try to effect change, though the visible scandal regarding campaign finances has passed
and with it broad public interest. The most
we can hope for is a vote, and with it some
accountability, so that the unreformed and
anti-reformers cannot hide from their con-

Gallant's Kings: An Action-packed
Night Out for the Bard's Most Royal

Crummy Advice
The Bear (as told to Katie Menzer)
Dear Bear,
When I was a small child, I had my
whole life planned out. I was going to be
born in a rustic stone cottage in a quaint
town in New England. My father, a simple
but honest blacksmith, would send me to
a Catholic boarding school in Connecticut after my mother had died of a broken
heart following my older brother's enlistment in the French foreign legion after his
beloved fiancee had eloped with a midget
from a traveling midget acrobat troop. At
school, a kindly nun would recognize my
unquenchable genius and take me to her
bosom, teaching me all the finer arts of
life. I would excel in art, literature, music,
but specially poetry. I'd also be the number one women's basketball prospect in the
country.
After a tearful and poignant goodbye, I
would leave my beloved nun and enroll in
Oxford on a full scholarship where the
ghosts of that institution's glorious past
would inspire me to write a volume of
verse that would be heralded as the greatest poetic achievement since Green Eggs
and Ham.
On my sea voyage that would bring to
the States to accept my Pulitzer prize for
poetry, I would meet the dashing, young,
billionaire playboy who would instantly
fall in love with me and slather me with
expensive presents. We would be married

Jordan Back on Top With
Twisted Butcher Boy

While the rest of the sophomore
class tried frantically to rise triumphant from the housing lottery, I
calmly proxied my lottery number
over to my roommate and loped on
over to LPAC mainstage for the
opening night of Kings. The theater was still virtually empty when
I arrived, and never really got much
more crowded; which was fine by
me because I could put my feet up
on the seats in front of me. But I
hope the audience will get larger
for upcoming shows. Three hours
is quite a while to spend in your
seat, but the show is fast paced and
interesting, and both actors and
crew turn in impressive performances.
The play is an adaption and condensation of four Shakespearean
plays: Richard 11, both parts of
Henry IV, and Henry V. Directed
and Adapted by Daniel Gallant, the
play stars Vanessa Agosto, Nancy
Benson-Nicol, Greg Erskine,
Christopher Foley, Ashley Flynn,
Elizabeth Goldsmith, Allegra Gordon, Jeff Levine, Catherine
Osborne, Dave Ryan, Amita
Sudhir, Kathy Walley and Hugh
Weber on stage. While minorcharacters are generally removed entirely from the play, the number of
characters to play far exceeds the
number of actors, so most cast
members take on at least two roles.
Role changes were handled
smoothly though; the actors didn't
alternate between two characters,
they switched to a second or third
character once the previous one had
died or been banished. Oddly
enough, both these incidents occur
quite regularly.

hands that managed to do such unobtrusive set changes in the background while actors were on stage
speaking. There were often many
things involved in a scene change,
moving or turning the main platform, changing chairs, etc., and the
men/women in black did a wonderful job of not being more noticeable than is absolutely necessary.
Light and sound were also well
done and added to the coherency
and impact of the piece.
Gallant obviously had to remove
huge parts of the play for this
adaption; one of the four plays

of them. But scenes flow well together and there didn't seem to be

development or plot. Sex changes,
which were played up in advertisements, are relatively subtle and
don't interfere or even really alter
the original dynamics. One scene
towards the middle of the piece
does feature a rather hairy young
man in a skimpy red dress, and this
is obviously meant to act as comic
relief; the scene is quite funny. Costuming is for the most part fairly
simple, with all actors wearing
white dress shirts and black trousers, unless explicitly portraying
women, and adding ties, vests, and
jackets to properly denote hierarchical standing of their character.
The crown around which this tetralogy centers is the most interesting; stage lights reflecting off its
edges glint into the audience and
can cause temporary blindness.
Kings begins with the gaudy
reign of Richard II and the foolish
pride which leads eventually to his
death. Oops, hope I haven't ruined
it for anyone; Richard is one of the
first to die, a really violent death,

on stage. The first portion of the
play is the most serious, and
seemed to bear a stronger resemblance to the language and emotion
expected ofShakespearean tragedy
than would later scenes. Both poetic passages and dramatic
speeches are more dominant here,
and the fights are minimal. The
fight scene which culminates in
Richard's tragic end is possibly the
simplest sequence of the production; but it's obvious that the*'actors have developed deadly skill
with their long blunt dowels.

actors pause more often for laughter; and towards the end, both battle
scenes and private duels become
more and more common. This is
not to say that the characters lose
any of their dignity; the older characters seem even more dignified in
the face of their younger counterparts amusing and violent pastimes.
But high and tragic drama seems
reserved to the characters left over
from Richard 11, allowing a welcome respite between the
scenes of the first section and £he
constant battles of Henry V.
The final scenes of Kings center
around the war between England
and France detailed in Henry.V.
Battle sequences come into prominence later on, but the first part returns a little to the more stately feel
of scenes taken from Richard 77.
The French court however is for the
most part comic relief, and it is in
the English scenes that the bard's
sense of grandeur is most keenly
felt; there is one speech delivered
by King Henry IV near the end
which is magnificently dramatic.
The British/French war is portrayed
well on stage, with wooden dowels dodging and flying and forcing
people eventually to the ground
with impressive choreography. One
scene is done entirely in French,

Williams Finds Harmony In Dissonance

Dear Pardus,
I am a sophomore living in Wharton. A few weeks ago,
I met this guy at one of the numerous talks held this semester. He seemed a pretty decent guy and we started
talking. I found to my surprise that we shared a lot in
common including sporting interests (we both love soccer), poetry and share a love for biology. To cut a long
story short, we stated dating and that is when I began to
sense trouble. My guy is a great conversationalist arijfhe
is very popular with girls I guess because he can ctjfne
up with so many absurd jokes. My problem is I carjiot

neglecting to pay attention to the one most important
person in his life right now. However I do not believe
your problem is unsolvable. That your guy loves you I
have no doubt about. He might be having problems wifh
the deeper attachments of an intimate relationship. Talk
to him, (and I mean talk to him) and ask him whether, he
has been in any other serious relationships before (if you
do not already know this fact) and tell him you would
like to do stuff with him more often now. Just you arid
him. Period!!!!. I believe this should sound enough bells
in his brain that you desire more attention. You can suggest going to the movies, out to eat and going to parties if
they appeal to you. But you have to be very tactful and
patient about it in order not to scare the hell out of him.
This said I hope you appreciate the fact thathe is so popular with people. I think you should not let jealousy mar

Another responsibility I am taking over
as the Board of Managers observer is to
well inform student body about what is
discussed in the BOM meetings. I believe

Therefore, I will prepare reports for the

Women’s Tennis Smashes Fords,
Finish Second in Conference

Baseball Loses
Another Three
By Patricia Barrientos
The Swarthmore baseball team is
nearing the end of a long season as
they play the final four games in
the following days. However, all
they have to show for it is a string
of losses and a three under the W
column, but the last win happened
so long ago that no one really remembers.
The season has been disheartening as the Garnet has gone into every game thinking of winning, but
has not because the team could not
come together. On the days when
the pitching was solid, the bats were
silent and when runs were scored,
the defense collapsed. As in
Tuesday's game against Ursinus,
the team went in tied into the bottom of the Bth, but a costly error
made the difference in the 8-6 loss.
The offensive attack of Jay
Schembs 'Ol and the strong pitching ofJosh Roth '99 went to waste.

Men Set Up for Match Against #2 Amherst
By Laurie Smith and
Peter Schilla

Over the weekend, the Garnet
dropped a pair to Gettysburg, 5-2,
144. Steve Farneth 'OO pitched a
solid first game,but the offense did
n6t click. Roth and Dan Johnston
'9B pitched the second game as they
wefe pounded for 11 earned runs
on 14 hits.
It "seems that the team stepped up
their game on rare occasions, but
never was able to fully play as a
cbmplete team. They did not create momentum as the hitting, the
fielding, or the pitching fell apart.
The Garnet had the potential to pair
off against most of the teams in the
conference, but inexperience hindered them from putting pressure
oh their opponents. Instead, they
beat themselves. They surrendered
without giving the team a chance
to do the little things that win
games.

Women's Lax
Fights Through
Intense Week
ByJillßelding
Defeating the 11th ranked team
in Division 111 was an impressive
and important victory for the
women's lacrosse team last week.
In an intense match Rowan fell 138 to the Garnet. Swarthmore was
anchored by the defense of goalkeeper Jane Kendall who racked up
30 saves. Additionally, Katherine
Wu, Becca Stites, Sarah Singleton,
Jen Hagan, Anne Holland, Katie
Vivalo and Gwen Horton, the rest
of the defensive squad, kept the
play upfield. The connections in
themidfieldalso contributed to the
fluidity of the offense and the positive outcome of the game. Netting
goals for the Garnet were Betsy
Rosenbaum and Alicia Googins
with 4 each and Holly Baker with
a hat trick. Kristen English added
2 of 13 goals to the tally.
A major factor in the contest
seemed to be the mental focus of
theieam. Members of the team felt
they.were "prepared and ready to
dominate the field." Perhaps "success was due to how well we executed the basics," as Coach Karen
Borbee pointed out.
With the momentum of this victory, the Garnet stepped up to face
1Oth ranked Franklin and Marshall
College. After double overtime,
Swarthmore succumbed to a 10-9
loss. The game was even one until
the last 48 seconds when an F&M
player netted a goal. Like Rowan,
Swarthmore played at a high level,
but the team was unable to capitalize on some of the opportunities
they had. Shots occasionally hit the
posts or were rushed.
Coach Borbee felt that "F&M had
more experience than we did and I
feel that was the differencebetween
winning and losing."
Having recovered from the fervor
of F&M, Swarthmore was determined to crush Bryn Mawr. And
thjey did. The Garnet martyred
Bryn Mawr 18-6 on Wednesday.
Rosenbaum and Baker each netted
five, while Googins followed with
four. English, Natania Kremer and
Becca Stites and Erika Williams
threw in one of their own to finish
off-the Mawytrs.

serve.

As both the men's and women's
teams get ready to finish their seasons, they are heading into a strong
finish, especially with two wins
against the Haverford Fords this
week. The women's team played
three matches last week and this
week against the College of New
Jersey, Johns Hopkins, and finished
up with Haverford on Wednesday.
They were defeated by the nationally ranked College of New Jersey
0-9 last Saturday but beat out Johns
Hopkins 7-2 Tuesday.
The most anticipated match of the
week and the one attended by the
most spectators was Wednesday's
against Haverford. Going into the
match the Garnet had a record of
10-4and knew that ifthey won they
wouldbe tied for second in the Centennial Conference with Gettysburg
and Western Maryland behind
Franklin and Marshall, and if they
lost they would drop down into fifth
place. Coach Dan Sears knew that
it would "come down to the wire"
on this match because it could have
gone either way.
The doubles matches ended with

one win from #1 doubles players Jen
Pao 'Ol and Krista Hollis 'Ol, who
had the longest doubles match. As
the rest of the team watched, they
pummeled their opponents 8-4.
In singles, Pao at #l, Rani
Shankar '9B at #2, and Wendy
Kemp '99 at #4 finished their first
sets within the first half hour and
all went on to win their matches.
Elena Rosenbuam '9B losther first
set 6-7, but came back in the second and third sets and blanked her
opponent 6-0, 6-0. After those
matches finished, Swat already
knew they had the win and waited
in victorious silence as the rest of
the players finished. The regular
season for the women is officially
over with a final record of 11-4 and
a conference record of 8-2. This
Friday the top five players will
travel to Franklin and Marshall for
the Centennial Conference Cham-

pionships.
On Friday the men's tennis team
took on SUNY Binghamton, ranked
#4 in the region, one behind Swat.
With the incentive of several parents
and girlfriends in the stands, the
Doubles started strong, taking all
three matches. Due to the threat of
rain, the singles matches were sent

on quickly, and some of them ended
in the same manner. At #6, Pete
Schilla 'Ol demolished his opponent
by a score of6-0,6-1. Following him
off the court with another straight
sets win was #3 John Leary 'OO.
Then the matches got close, but Greg
Emkey '99 pulled off a three set win
at #4 to clinch the match. The final
score was 4-3 for Swat, setting them
upfor a rematch with #2 Amherst in
thefirstround ofregionals, to be held
at Swat on May 9 and 10.
The team played again on Tuesday, trampelling the Haverford
Fords. Leary set the tone of the
match on the first point when he
poached off a John Temin 'OO serve
and hit a solid volley right into an
opponent's chest. The doubles went
quickly with Swat taking all three
matches. With Temin sitting out the
singles due to illness, Dennis Mook
'Ol stepped up to play #6. Even
without much experience in the
singles line up, Mook won easily,
but was beaten off the court by a
few seconds by Emkey and Schilla.
Following them, with his first win
of the year, was Team Captain
Roger Werner '9B. Nick Slimack
'99 and Leary then won matches to
give Swat the 7-0 victory.

Swarthmore Scholars Controversy Heats Up
School Offers Merit Aid Relief To Some Of Incoming Class
From Scholarships, page 1

are six Swarthmore Scholars in the class of
2001. Mamlet expects that thirty-five students
will accept the scholarships this year, representing an increase of twenty-nine over last year.
The expansion is a one-year initiative that will
be reviewed before next year's admissions

cycle.
Laura Talbot, Director of Financial Aid, says
that selected scholars are offered "a sweetened
financial aid package." Talbot maintains that the
scholarships are not entirely merit scholarships,
insofar as they are offered only to students with
financial need. However, she does agree that
"the selection by the Admissions Office is meritbased; the amount offered by the Financial Aid
Office is need-based."
Talbot stresses that "whenever financial aid
is an issue, my focus is always on equity." She
also notes that she has seen no evidence that
students are choosing Princeton and Yale over
Swarthmore on the basis ofenhanced financial
aid and scholarships. In fact, she says, "The new
Princeton, Yale, and Stanford plans are simply
moving closer to what Swarthmore is already

offering."
The administration does

not consider the

scholarships merit-based. According to Bloom,
the program constitutes only "differential packaging" in that the total value of the financial aid
package remains constant. "The scholarships are
a need-based financial aid program. They do not
give to students any funds which go beyond what
we assess as their need," he notes.
"The program is designed to help the Admissions Office construct the class. The students are
not more meritorious, they are simply in greater
demand and are more expensive," says Bloom.
Bloom says that according to definitions established by leading colleges and universities, "preferential packaging is different from merit aid."
The College is a member of a consortium of
thirty-five top colleges and universities that defines merit aid as financial assistance in excess of
a student's demonstratedneed. In that sense, because only the components of the financial aid
package change while the total value remains
constant, the Scholars Program does not offer
merit aid.
Many students and faculty, however, have expressed concern that even though the total value
of the package does not change, there is a substantial advantage to students receiving grants instead of loans and summer work requirements.
College Budget Committee member Sean

Students Voice Concerns
from Meeting, page 1

dents, namely those likely to be accepted
to comparable institutions. Bloom replied
by laying out the difficult dilemma Swarthmore faces between losing equality
among members of the incoming class or
losing promising students to other colleges. Dean ofAdmissions Robin Mamlet
added that "historically we've had a low
percentage of people who were accepted
here matriculate." She expressed concern
that the quality of the class would deteriorate with low yields, forcing her to accept
larger numbers of students and, thus, students who would not normally be accepted
to the College.
GiridharSrinivasan '9B expressed a common concern by raising the question of
whether Swarthmore was more concerned
with "competitive effectiveness" or "equity." Sean Barney '9B, who helped draft
earlier financial aid proposals as a member of the College Budget Committee characterized the "emergency" quality of decision, questioning its long-term effectiveness: Bloom replied by noting that "What
we're already finding in our own minds
and hearts is that the experiment has
failed," in view of the student response.
While other students echoed this sentiment, Jude Uzonwanne '9B reminded
those assembled that "we should acknowledge reality" as the admissions office has.
Vincent Jones '9B argued that the rising
price of college was a problem itself,
though administrators argued, it serves as
a mechanism for redistributing money.
The discussion eventually shifted to

Swarthmore's most prominent encounter
with the demands of being a top college,
the U.S. News and World Report rankings.
Matt Schwartz 'Ol, who earlier in the year
wrote a column advocating Swarthmore
refuse to participate in the rankings, argued
that Swarthmore's attitude toward the ranking come under discussion.
Bloom placed the ranking in context,
noting that it is extremely imperfect,
though it doesraise Swarthmore's visibility. Mamlet described the rankings as a
huge cash cow for the magazine, but also a
convenient way to put Swarthmore's name
in the minds of students. Jenny Yang 'OO
made light of Swarthmore's promotional
use of the ranking and suggested that it be
qualified on Swarthmore's webpage with
a note regarding campus feeling on the issue.
As a whole, the meeting raised numerous questions and resolved none of them,
particularly the issue of how the financial
aid decision was made and its consequences for the future. Dean Mamlet
viewed the dialogue as a step in the right
direction: "These conflicts entail hard discussions forcing us to live out thedecisions
and ideas," she said. As difficult as this
process is, the very presence of the discussion certifies that much of Swarthmore's
distinctiveness remains. President Bloom
described the gathering as "the kind of
meeting that typifies what is great about
Swarthmore, having students, administrators, and faculty come together in serious
and concerted dialogue about the values at
the center of the institution and the challenges facing it."

Barney '9B acknowledges thatthe scholarships
are given only to students with financial need,
but also maintains that "there is no way the
administration can credibly argue that merit
isn't the primary consideration in the award.
It's pretty clear to me that the scholars program is a competitive tool in the hands of the
Admissions Office," he says.
Barry Schwartz, Associate Provost and Professor of Psychology, characterizes the expanded program "competition-based aid." He
says, "It is as need-based as any other scholarship we offer in the sense that people must have
need to qualify, but there is certainly a merit
component. It is driven by a sense of how attractive the person is to Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton. It is almost certainly true that all the
people who need the money the most won't
get it."
"It also directly contradicts the rhetoric in the
Admissions Office, where prospective students
are routinely told that we could never offer
merit- based scholarships because all students
admitted are "equally meritorious." Clearly,
this policy makes some students 'more equal'
than others in the eyes of the college," says Tara
Zahra '9B, an Admissions Fellow and member
of the College Planning Committee.

Approximately thirty students and

morning an article appeared in The
Daily Gazette, marking the first
timemost students had heard of the
program.
Zahra, an Admissions Fellow and
member of the College Planning
Committee, felt that theadministration had made the decision without
consulting or even informing the
community. "I felt that debating the
topic would be a good way to get
both sides of the issue represented
and inform the student population,
so that a community-based decision
can be made as to whether or not
this should continue next year," she
says.

Facilators Needed for Diversity Orienation Workshops
We are looking for facilitators for the Class of 'O2 Diversity Orientation Workshops to take place next fall. The program will include a Swat-written and
directed play, followed by small-group discussions, as well as a formal
worshop (new and improved from last year's) during the first few weeks of
classes. Facilitators will need to arrive at Swarthmore on Sunday, August
30th, during orientation. The workshops will focus on many aspects of diversity, including race, gender, sexuality, class, religion, and physical ability.

Women's Rugby Lands
Fifth Out of Twenty in
Final Season Tourney
By Amber Halsey, Danielle
Thomas and Rhiana Swartz
This weekend, the Swarthmore
Women's Rugby Team competed at
the West Chester Tournament for
the second year in a row. Since
Swarthmore was last years champion, Swat was put in one of the
hardest brackets this year. Despite
the stiff competition, Swatfinished
sth out of 20 teams, winning 3 of
the five brutal games played on
Saturday and Sunday.
Swat triumphed in their first
game, beating Bloomsburg by a
score of 24-0. Courtney Clark '9B
scored a beautiful try, setting up
Rhiana Swartz 'OO for a conversion
kick. Beth Vose '99 scored two
tries for the team. Swat gained five
more points after Bridget Arbour
'9B viciously thrust her body into
the tryzone. Swartz nailed another
kick to boost Swat's final score to

24.
The Swat Women Ruggers were

paired with the Penn State team for
their second game; while Swat
played extremely well against their
nationally ranked opponents, they
lost the match by a score of 12-5.
The most redeemable aspect of this
game was that Swat was the only
team to score on Penn State's squad
all weekend until the championship.
Beth Vose '99 scored the only try
in the first half, capitalizing on a
hole in the opposition. Penn State's
forwards were
no match for
Swat's powerful
scrum, thus they
played a very
back-oriented
game. Swat's

the challenge,

tackling hard

West Chester, winning many of
their feeds. West Chester scored
first but a quick try by Danielle
Thomas '99 tied the game. After
another West Chester try,
Danielle D'Olivera 'OO used her
amazing speed to tie the game.
Although Swat had many opportunities to put the game away, it
went into sudden death overtime.
The Swat team battled fatigue
and dominated the overtime, but
just couldn't score. West
Chester's sole overtime possession resulted in a fast break try,
ending the game. Sarah Cross '99
commented saying "If it weren't
for our bad fast break defense
we'd be winning this tournament."
Sunday the Swarthmore team
took out their frustration with the
West Chester game on their opponents. Swat easily won both of their
games finishing sth overall, the best
showing possible given their
bracket. While the Swat team was
not nearly as full of shutzpah as
they were the day before, they effortlessly scored tries and shut out
their opponents.
Shippensburg was the first victim.
The back line got off to a quick start
scoring thefirst try. Through Swat's
scrums were not as strong as usual,
hooker Kara Spangler 'Ol stole
many of the opponents' balls. Second row Joan Hoffman '9B rejoined
the Swat team having mastered
eight space. Hoffman and her partner in crime
Leora CohenMcKeon '9B
provided powerful drive in
rucks
and
mauls. Nancy
Craig 'Ol made
her debut at 8man and ran
rings around
her opposition.
Swat's second
try was scored
when Amber Halsey '9B powered
her way into the try zone. Halsey
remarked, "I should be a flanker
more often."
Swat then gave York a thorough
beating. D'Olivera got two nice tries
capitalizing on a York fumble and the
amazing hands of fellow back Lynn
Mathews '9B. The otherSwat try was
scored by Thomas who received an
excellent pass from Cohen-McKeon.
This week's H.T.S "chumbawamba"
award goes to Scrum-half Megan
Brennan 'OO because she does you
know what and not even her mom
can keep her down.

throughout the
game. The duo
ofLynn Matthews '9B and Charity
Miller '9B intimidated, forcing their
opponents to move the ball quickly
down their line. The winning Penn
State try was scored on a fast break
by a member of the U.S National
Team.
Swat played their third game
against West Chester. Swat played
one of the best games of their season, inspired by their loss to West
Chester last season. The tight five

Softball Sweeps Doubleheader
Though One-run Losses Continue to Frustrate Team
By Jean Quinn
The Garnet swept a doubleheader against
Lehman College last Saturday, but dropped two
crucial nonconference contests against Philadelphia Pharmacy and Albright. This week's action brings the team's record to 8-20 overall, 210 in the conference.
Philly Pharmacy was an extremely aggressive
team offensively, but overall they were quite
comparable with the Garnet. Swat fell 5-6 in
eight innings, after losing a lead in the seventh.
Philly's quick base-running led to numerous
physical and mental errors on Swat's part defensively, and Philly was a team who took advantage of every mistake. Deirdre Downey 'Ol
was 2 for 5 from the plate with 2 runs scored,
while Michelle Walsh '9B was 3 for 4, with a
double and 3 RBIs. Dana Lehman '9B gave up
ninehits in the outing. The outcome was a heartbreaker for the Garnet, for whom close, one or
two run, extra-inning games are becoming a

habit.
The Garnet rebounded quickly with a pair of
much needed victories. Swat routed the visiting
Lightning Bugs, who hailed from the Bronx, in
five innings 18-2. Facing much slower pitching
than in the conference, several players who had
been struggling lately found their bats. The team
exploded for a 12-run third inning. Walsh '9B led
theway, going 3 for 4 with a single, double, and a
homerun over the left-centerfieldfence. She collected 6 RBl's and scored twice. Jean Quinn '99
was 2 for 3, with a triple, 3 RBIs, and two runs
scored. Downey had 3 RBIs and 2 runs as well.
Lehman picked upher seventh victory of the season, allowing only 4 hits and striking out 4. All
players scored in the contest.
In the second contest, the Garnet fared just as
well, cruising to a five inning 16-8 victory. Mary
BethAlvarez '9B was 3 for 3 with 2 RBIs and one
run scored. Walsh was 2X2 with 4 RBIs. Heather
Marandola 'Ol was 2 for 3, with a stolen base,
and an RBI. She also crossed the plate 5 times
herself. Downey was 1 for 3 with a pair ofRBIs.

Heather Marandola 'Ol rips one down the third base line.
Lurah Hess '99 had 2 hits, an RBI, a stolen base
and 3 runs scored. Quinn had 4 RBIs on the day,
three of which came off an inside the park homeran. Kate Fama 'Ol picked up her first collegiate
victory, and Lehman recorded a save.
"It was great to see the team come together
and play two solid games," commentedLehman.
"Lehman College was a less talented team than
we are and I was glad we kept the game at our
level. We simply outplayed them and the scores
reflected that."
Winding down the season with a series of
nonconference games before facing Centennial
foes Haverford and Western Maryland, Swat
failed to make the most of their full schedule.
On Tuesday, the Garnet dropped another one ran
contest, this time to visiting Albright, 5-6. The
Garnet's offense was not as potent as against
Lehman, and several fielding mistakes helped

Ka,e Fama

Albright to their eventual victory. The game
ended with a disputed call at the bottom of the
seventh, as the home-plate umpire called
Downey, who would have been the tying run,
out at the plate. Downey was 1 for 2 with an
RBI and a run scored, and Walsh tripled in the
contest, driving 2 runs. Lehman struck out three
in the loss.
"It is so frustrating to lose another one run
game," saidLehman. "We threw the game away
by giving up 4 runs with 2 outs in the sixth. We
came back with some runs in our half of the
sixth and seventh but it just wasn't enough."
Coach Goetcheus said, "Basics are what have
won our games for us, and we did not execute
the basics."
The Garnet travel to Haverford Saturday for a
doubleheader at 1 p.m., before finishing upSunday at Western Maryland.

Lacrosse Loses Two, Record at 3-11
By Pat Donaghy

to

scoop

The men's lacrosse team lost two more
games this week, falling to 3-11 on the year
with just one game remaining. The 22-3
Gettysburg loss and 18-7 Widener defeat
brings the current losing streak to three.
However, the Tide is hoping to regroup and
looks to defeatarchrival Haverford at home
tomorrow afternoon.
In the midst of a difficult schedule, Swat
took on a Gettysburg team ranked #6 in the
country. Falling behind 7-0 after one period, the Tide regrouped and was able to keep
the second quarter at a 2-1 deficit to fall behind 9-1 at the half. But in the second half,
the Bullets showed why they are in first place
in the conference and lit up the scoreboard
14 times. Swarthmore goals were scored by
Marcus Shin 'OO, Mark Dingfield 'Ol and
Mike Lloyd 'Ol. SteveShin '9B contributed
two assists.
After the disheartening loss, Swarthmore
travelled down route 320 to face a strong
Widener squad. Halfway through the second quarter, down 5-0, Swat came back with
three quick goals. Marcus Shin opened the
scoring for the Tide by breaking through the
defense for a crease goal. Adam Dickinson
'OO and Dingfield soon followed with goals
of their own to swing the momentum
around. However, a late penalty just before
the half led to a Widener goal, and the score
was 6-3 at the break.

The Garnet came out flat in the second half
as Widener scored the first six goals of the period to take a commanding 12-3 lead. Refusing to give up, Swat scored the next two goals
and tried to make a game of it, but Widener
held tough and ran off six fourth quarter goals
androlled to victory. Dickinson and Dingfield
finished up with two goals apiece. Lloyd had
a goal and an assist. Steve Shin and Toby
Patterson 'OO each added assists.
"It was disappointing to lose to Widener
because they weren't that good," one player
commented after the game. After playing two
teams as strong as Gettysburg and Washington, it was difficult for the team to gather itself to play a solid game. "But we have to
get it together for Haverford on Saturday,"
the same player noted.
Swarthmore has lost the last five games in
the heated rivalry with Haverford. The games
are always very close, with an added physical element. The two teams have almost
identical records, and students are encouraged to attend the contest.
Heading into the finale, the scoring leaders for the Tide are Dingfield (26-8-34),
Lloyd (17-12-29), Steve Shin (13-5-18), and
Marcus Shin (7-4-11). Goalie Sig Rydquist
has stopped 52% of his shots on the year.
The contest will be the final games for the
senior class, which includes Erik Johnson,
Matt Halpern, Aaron Hultgren, Alex
DeShields, Pete Karacki, Chris Rockmore,
Tony Buendia, and Steve Shin.
