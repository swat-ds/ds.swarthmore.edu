Such an elaborate support system
is warranted, according to administrators, given how hard Swarthmore
is and the diversity of each class.
"The data shows that it is more challenging than other schools," said
Bob Gross, Acting Dean of the College, referring to a recent study conducted by UC Berkeley Boalt Hall

And excelling at Swarthmore isn't
all about academic prowess, according to Gross. Most of the supports
made available to freshmen such as

focus on academics, but the SAM
program—which was only started
last year—is designed to deal on a
more personal, one-to-one level.

shooting that a man much larger than AbuJamal had stood over Faulkner and fired
the shots before fleeing. Additionally,
other new and crucial evidence—such as
the fact that Faulkner was shot by a .44
caliber gun while the weapon found at the
scene was a .38 caliber gun—has come to
light. Weinglass seeks to obtain a retrial
for Abu-Jamal, and the case is presently
being reviewed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
Since his sentencing, Jamal has received
support throughout the nation and the

world in countries such as Germany and
Italy. Both Swim and Thompson attended
the Mumia rally held in San Francisco last
August. It was then that they were inspired
to organize The Freedom Singers. "We
were listening to Alice Walker read her
poem, 'Each One, Pull One' about how the
world is set up. We felt pushed by the power
of the poem and Maurisa said, 'We have to
sing and give the movement a voice.' That
was when it hit me," says Swim.

These are just a few of the slogans found on t-shirts worn by
Swatties that perpetuate the stereotype of Swarthmore as the "Academic Gridiron" of colleges and
universities across the country. The
challenge of a Swarthmore education is precisely the reason many
students come here in the first
place.
The impulse on the part of the
College to challenge its students,
however, is tempered by a genuine
desire to first make the transition

all incoming students. Hence the

Yet the question inevitably arises
whether the administration is going
out of its way to ensure that freshman don't fail. The sheer volume of
support available to new students is
suggestive: apart from the pass/fail
semester, the Dean's office has also
created the Student Academic Mentors (SAM) program, as well as organizing workshops on topics ranging from study habits to time management.

which ranks
Swarthmore as the top school in the
nation for not inflating students'
grades. Swarthmore is, however,
"doable," emphasized Gross, citing
the College's high retention and
graduation rates. The support programs would also give students with
weaker high school preparation
time to catch up, said Gross. New
Interim Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and former chair of
the Sociology/Anthropology department, Joy Charlton, echoed
Gross' sentiments. Swarthmore has
"an obligation as responsible academic intuition to provide support
for students who need support," she
said.

The field hockey team extended their
win streak to 7 games for the season this
week. The Garnet (7-0 overall, 3-0 in
the conference) shut-out both Widener
and Drew with scores of 8-0 and 4-0, and
defeated Gettysburg 5-2, putting them in
first place in the Centennial Conference.
Against Widener, the team seemed unstoppable. Coach Karen Borbee said,
"Widener fought hard until the very end
but was not as skilled as we were. We
played a better second half than the first,
but overall, we had the ball 90% of the
game." The Garnet outshot the opposition by an incredible 48-0 margin.
Danielle Duffy '9B scored twiceand also
picked up two assists. Lurah Hess '99
posted two goals. Holly Baker '99 and
Rebecca Stites 'OO each scored and had
an assist. Erika Williams 'Ol and Jen
Hagan '99 each knocked a goal into the
cage, and Kathleen Vivalvo 'Ol and
Kristen English 'Ol notched assists.
The romp was impressive, but not necessarily what the Garnetwould have preferred as their final contest before facing
longtime rival Gettysburg a few days
later. "Our defense still hadn't been

tested," reported Borbee. She told her players, "I told them not to be nervous, because
they thought the whole season was riding
on this one game. It's a long season. They
needed to go in expecting to win not hoping not to lose."

The Garnetremained composed and disciplined throughout the game and came
away with a 5-2 victory. Julie Finnegan
'OO gave Swat the lead early in the game.
Baker and Duffy each scored and picked
up an assist. Hess, who scored two goals
and earned one assist, remained the hot
offensive weapon. Teammate Hagan
praised Hess' perseverance and dedication,
"Our team never ceases to amaze me. Case
in point: Lurah Hess has been playing the
season with a broken index finger on her
right hand—the lowest
finger on the stick, and thereby most
vulnerable to hits—and has managed to
score 10 goals. At Gettysburg, shereceived
a blow to her finger, was tearing up from
the pain, and still managed to tip the ball
in the goal five seconds later."
Coach Borbee evaluated Gettysburg's
team as a strong one which tested the Garnet. "They are very potent around the goal
and even though it didn't seem close, they
impressed me with how dangerous their

offense was around the goal. We won because we limited their chances around the
goal and controlled the ball for most of
the game," she said. Hagan described the
victory as "one of the most exhilarating,
convincing wins that I've ever experienced
against a rival of Gettysburg's caliber."
Duffy was named the Conference player

of the week, for her remarkable offensive output that spanned these two contests and an earlier one against Franklin
and Marshall. Duffy accumulated 14
points, scoring 4 goals and notching 6
assists, in just three games.

Diversity workshops prove to be counterproductive
To the Editor:
During the week of September
15, all members of the Class of
2001 were required to attend "Diversity Workshops." These sessions ran approximately two and
a half hours and were intended to
promote an appreciation for the diversity among Swarthmore students; however, we feel that the
workshops failed to meet this
goal. Instead of celebrating our
diversity, the sessions served to
highlight otherwise unimportant
differences and create divisions
among an already tolerant and
accepting group.
Our experience with the workshop was a joint session between
Parrish Fourth East and West on
Thursday night from 9:00 until
11:30p.m. The workshop began
on a high note with the facilitators welcoming the group and
promising an evening that would
challenge and enlighten. The program moved quickly from a warm
welcome to a series of "games"
intended to point out the diversity
of the group. First, we were asked
to arrange ourselves in spectrums:
one of where we grew up and one
of skin color. After we were arranged physically, we were asked

to volunteer comments on "the

way we felt;" however, such questions failed to illicit any meaningful dialogues, and we quickly
moved along. The next round of
"games" proved to be not only a
waste of time, but a destructive
force. In this event, the group
formed a large circle, and the facilitator called out different categories, such as "Asians or AsianAmericans," and asked individuals who identified with that group
to step into the center of the circle.
There, they were asked again how
it felt and for any additional comments. Several groups included a
few or only one student. This exercise served to put individuals on
the spot about differences that had
previously not been a factor in
their relationships here. Furthermore, the necessity to physically
separate from the "group" gave
members on the inside of the
circle a sensation of being
trapped, having to stare down their
friends on the outside of the circle,
and loneliness. Meanwhile, the
"majority" felt embarrassed and
even ashamed. Following this categorization session, real issues
were briefly discussed. Participants read an article by a women's

studies professor at Wellesley and to point out diversity issues such

Do not sacrifice education for diversity Summer
To the editor:
For awhile now, the Phoenix had
had a series ofof articles about diversity issues at Swarthmore.
Amy Albert wrote one of them,
where
she
condemns
Swarthmore's passive admission and argues for "active recruitment" and "progressive
admissions policies." Unfortunately, these slogans seem to
express an ugly ideology of
sacrificing education in favor
of diversity.
The argument is clear what
we need is a campus that is allinclusive, diverse and tolerant..
Fair enough, it is a great ideal. But
should this be the primary goal of
the admissions office? I do not believe so. The goal of the institution like the College is to provide
—

us with the best possible education; the admissions office should
provide the College with students
best qualified to receive this education. And I do not thinkthat "diversity" is one of these qualifications. A student is qualified for
being admitted onlybecause ofhis
previous education, be it a he or a
she, gay or straight, black or
white.
For me, this country has always
meant an equality of opportunities. If equal opportunities are
provided, then it is up to the individual to make something out of
his life, to grasp these opportunities. Why maintain that theresults
should be equal? Opportunities in
education are those in kindergartens and primary schools. Results
are, in Amy Albert's words, at-

tending "prestigious colleges and
go[ing] on to positions of power."
I am well aware of the fact that
many are deprived of the education opportunities, of good
schools and safe study environment. What should be done is to
correct this situation, to improove
and better schools, and to stop
ensuring the equality of results.
"Active recruitment," "progressive admissions policies" divert
our focus from the real problems,
and in addition give us all a false
sense of security, thjat something
is being done to correct social injustice. And the injustice I am
talking about is not: "Oh, it's so
unfair I was rejected by
Swarthmore!" but rather: "Oh, it's
so unfair I no education whatsoever."

Corrections
On page 4 of the September 19th issue, a photo of Linda Chavez was
incorrectly labeled Linda Chavez-Thompson. Also in the September 19th
issue, the article "Women's Soccer fights on" on page 8 had an incorrect
byline. It should read "By Mateo Centeno."

community

program
To the Editor:
I just wanted to make you aware
of a wonderful program which began this past June. The Summer
Community Learning Project, was
designed to help the adolescent
daughters of faculty and staff,
meet, experience, encourage and
enjoy each other, all through the
loving, inspirational guidance of
six current students. These students/mentors (Erica Turner, Elisa
Nigrini, Chloe Dowley, Mandara
Meyers, Nichole Breazeale, Andrea Meller...all class of '99) hope
to continue the connections and
friendships they saw bloom this
past summer. The program was
phenomenal! The girls developed
their own magazine, learned about
communities by studying thewildlife of the Crum, wrote poetry,
danced and laughed.
The first 'reunion' of the SCLP
will be tomorrow, from 12-2:00, a
barbeque at the Women's Resource
Center.
I know my daughter can't wait!

tury architecture what Swarthmore is? Or
what it wants to represent?
We need new depictions.
I'd like to see postcards of Sharpies during the dinner before Screw Your Roommate, maybe students gorging brownie sundaes in Paces, partying at the BCC, duking
it out on the Rugby field, talking in a midnight econ seminar. Imagine a post-card
with the caption: McCabe Reserve Desk,
Monday 9:oopm. Or a picture of the Dash
for Cash, the weekly pasta bar, African
Dance class, or those people wearing black
smoking outside of Trotter. There are so
many possibilities for imaging, re-visioning and lifting our tired corporate
Swarthmore face. And why stop at postcards, why not alternative brochures, tshirts, mugs and notebooks? And what
about the Swarthmore logo?
Why have we allowed these few images
to be the only widely dispersed visual information of such a vital, rich and creative
place? Where is Swarthmore's visual democracy? I guess that's what the internet
is for, but more specs and parents and visitors go to the bookstore than cruise the web

for subversive Swattie sites.
It seems obvious that the administration should not be the only authority
on images here
images that have
such an impact on our present and future student body. A new post-card
perspective on life at Swarthmore
would depict a lightheartedness and
tongue-in-cheek vim not usually asso—

ciated with our austere institution.
Why not make fun of ourselves, too?
Yep we're nerds, yep, some of us never
venture beyond the field house, and yep,
we paid to come here. Sure, the "anywhere else it would have been an A" tshirts are funny, but isn't that passe? And
don't we do more than just carp about
grades here? Let's transfuse the official

Swarthmore with freshness, self-mockery and fun!
So who will sponsor the Swarthmore

Just imagine a postcard offrenzied Phoenix editors swearing at the computer just

The Car Authorization Committee Should be
Disbanded: a personal look at the parking crisis
For
the
two
past
years, the
Senior class
a
t
Swarthmore
has
been
confounded
by the decisions of the
Andy
CarAuthoriCaffrey£
zation Committee. The
committee has decided that underclassmen with special needs have
priority over seniors in getting
parking permits. Needs, as decided

by the committee, include talcing
classes at other institutions, and
research at other locations. This
system has introduced more bias
and unfairness into the system of
parking permits, and should be discontinued.
A Swarthmore parking permit
grants two privileges: the convenience oflocation and saves the student parking costs for locations in
the Ville. Parking places in the Ville
are very easy to get, and there are
plenty of spaces at the train station
as well. The cost of these parking
spots is not significant compared to
other costs of a car. Since the per-

Mit is simply a privilege.the only
fair way to ration the parking spots
is seniority. Then, everyone eventually has an equal chance of getting a parking permit.
Certainly some portion of the
spots (say 10%), should be reserved
for students with a genuine medical or family need. These needs
should be determined by Worth
Health Center or the Dean's Office
respectively. The remainder should
be randomly lotteried to seniors,
with any unwanted or remaining
spots going to underclassmen. I
would also propose that parking
spots be allocated in the Spring,

before persons from Texas or California have driven their car across
the country with the hope that a
parking space would be awaiting
them at Swat.
Several students have complained
about the Car Authorization Committee in the past, apparently to no
effect. I hope that my complaint
will be given more weight, as I was
a member of the aforementioned
committee. As a witness to the decision making process, I can say
that this process was not formalized, and standards for a "good reason" varied widely. Applicants
gave their reasons for needing a
parking space on their applications.

Unfortunately.there were many
more applications than spaces, and
virtually everyone has some organization or project for which a car
would be useful. In many cases, a
person's reasons would need to be
verified by another committee
member before they were accepted
as "good enough." Obviously, this
process introduces considerable
bias.
I am not accusing fellow committee members of just giving parking
spaces to their friends. In many
cases, committee members showed
real objectivity. However, the process itself makes bias inevitable. I
would prefer a more fair system,

power, passion and the wonderful gift oflove?
We know that the world is in danger; it seems as though mankind is
at a crossroads leading to either destruction or salvation.Ask yourself:
is the world, as you see it, worth
"saving"?
I am disturbed by the number of
people that I have met who do not
seem to really care. But more so, I
am amazed at the number of people
who think that it isn't worth it.
"Look at all the hatred that people
exude towards others," they say.
"Look at the pain and suffering.
Look at the disagreement, the
greed, the corruption. Humanity
doesn't really deserve to be saved,
and how can we do anything to
change that?" That, I think, is one
of the most dangerous attitudes that
someone can take towards the
world. It is dangerous because,
more often than not, it leads to the
final conclusion, "Why should we
even bother?"
That attitude is becoming very
prevalent in America and indeed in
the world today. Voter turnout is
minimal; people hate the government; the cry of the conservative
middle class seems to be "mine,
mine, mine." People just don't seem

such as the lottery I outlined above.

Unfortunately, it is too late to reverse this year's decisions, but I
hope that next year we can improve
the decision making process.
Another reason for disbanding
the committee is an unfortunate
consequence of the decisions. Terri
Narkin has been forced to endure
verbal abusefrom seniors whowere
denied a parking spot. If you don't
get a spot in a lottery system, then
it's tough luck.

One Among
Many

to care, and with each person who
doesn't care anymore, the human
race takes one more step towards
destruction. By "care" I mean a
love of humanity that transcends
their own personal mistrust of society and erases their own apathy.
When someone really cares,
when someone really loves, then
"why should we even bother" is
replaced by something so much
more beautiful and beneficial to
humanity. What it is replaced with
is a recognition. It is a recognition
that, yes, the world has forsaken a
homeless child in the ghetto, or a
starving boy in Bangladesh, and
that, yes, the world has become
jaded and immovable and greedy,
but it is also the recognition that
there is still love in the world, that
humanity has not lost its passion,
and that we have not forsaken our
right to be saved.
Mother Theresa, may her God
rest her soul, was one who realized
this. Look at what she did in her
lifetime! She lived by the simple
motto, "People are stupid, arrogant,
and mean. Love them anyway. If
you give, then people will suck you
dry. Give anyway. If you do good,
you will get kicked in the teeth. Do
good anyway." Why? Why should
we do these things? Why should
we even bother? For the simple
reason that there are still people like
Mother Theresa. For the simple
reason that there is still, within the
human spirit, the possibility of ultimate love and forgiveness. For the
simple reason that people are willing to do good anyway. For the
simple reason thatthe question will
forever linger in the air, what happens if no one cares?

Let me tell you a story. Once,
long ago, there lived in a village an
old, wise man and a cocky, smartaleck of a boy. This boy wanted
nothing more than to make the man
look like a fool. One day, the boy
came up with a plan: he would capture a frail bird in the forest, and
ask the man if it were alive or dead.
If the man answered that it was
dead, the boy wouldrelease the bird
into the air. If the old man answered that it was alive, the boy
would crush the bird until there was
nothing left. So the boy captured
the bird, and presented it to the
man. "Old man, what do I have in
my hand?" asked the boy. "You
have a bird, my son," replied the
man. "Old man, is the bird alive or
dead?" asked the boy. The old man
looked down at the boy with his
ancient, wise, loving eyes, and replied, "The bird is in your hands,
my son."
The bird is in our hands now,
Swarthmore. We are going to lead
the world.That is fact. Us, and others like us. We came to Swarthmore
so that we could expand our minds
to their fullest capacity, and when
that is done, we shall leave here and
join the world as its elite of the
learned. What are we going to do
with that knowledge? I would like
to call you to arms. I would like to
bring you together, and say that
now is the time to let go of the jaded
cynicism. It is time to let go of why
should we even bother. It is time to
love, and it is time to care. It is time
to let the bird live. The world is in
our hands, Swarthmore. Let it live.
Let it live.

How much should
College help frosh?
from Tough, pg. I
sures—how to budget their time
and use time effectively," Gross
pointed out. "SAMs help students
with this balance." Freshman
JanineGibbons agreed with Gross'
observation. "There's a lot of work
to get done, but we're given enough
time to do it," she said. "It's balancing the time that's difficult."

Lying at the core of the support
programs is the pass/fail Fall semester for freshman—first implemented in 1968—which has been
well-received by administrators and

students alike, in spite of worries
that it might take away the incentive for students to work hard.
Adapting to college life often involves more than learning how to
deal with the academic work, and
pass/fail semester provides for a
complete transition, both parties
agree. Aside for giving students the
opportunity to get a better idea of
the academic expectations of the
College, it also provides them with
other valuable lessons. "Part of how
you become a successful student at
Swarthmore is by...learning how to
manage in a new environment,"

said Charlton, "there's so much to
adjust to in college." The first semester is also a time for developing a sense of orientation. "I think
pass/fail is a good idea because it
gives us a chance to get involved
and to find our place here without
the burden of grades," said Gibbons. Despite expressing concern
about her lack of diligence as a result of the pass/fail system, Maria
Rodes 'Ol recognized its benefits
as well. "You have time to think
about [how to use] free time and
try new things," she said. "Student
take risks they wouldn't otherwise
take [if they were being graded],"
added Charlton.
The general feeling seems to be
that more help wouldn't hurt. "I feel
thoseprograms are necessary at the
toughest school in the country, said
Gabe Turzo 'Ol, "it's important to
get off on the right foot."

New a cappella group
sings for freedom
from Freedom, pg. I
The Freedom Singers have collated an eclectic repertoire that includes freedom songs from groups
like Sweet Honey and the Rock and
traditional spiritual music from
other countries such as Venezuela.
"I've wanted to see an a cappella
group that would bring people from
all different types of backgrounds
and unite them all into fighting for
one cause," says Swim. The group
is also improvising different music
to match poetry by authors such as
Alice Walker and Sandra Maria
Esteves. Thompson has written a
song based on the poem "Adoni Ki
Pero" by Sonia Sanchez.
Swim and Thompson plan on

bringing the group to the March on
Washington in honor ofAbu-Jamal
on December 6th. They hope to be
a strong voice in the rally there,
teaching the multitudes of people
expected to march the songs that
they know so well. The Freedom
Singers also plan on singing at a
protest in front of the Philadelphia
District Attorney's office every
Thursday afternoon. They have not
yet set a date for a concert on campus, but they expect to perform
sometime this semester.
The Freedom Singers currently
comprises of seven people, five females and two males. They are
seeking more people who want to
help out in the movement. Rehearsals are every Thursday at 8:30 p.m.

"We want to humanize the movement and we need as many people
as possible to help us in order to
have a great impact on Mumia's
case," Thompson says. They also
hope to expand the group to the TriCollege Community, and plan on
advertising their group through email.
Due to Abu-Jamal's pending date
ofexecution in December, the Civil
Liberties Union will be working
alongside The Freedom Singers in
their efforts to free him. They are
planning on setting a date for letter-writing to President Clinton and
other political figures in Parrish and
possibly bringing speakers onto
campus to inform the student body
about this issue.

Timm-Dinkins '93 returns
as SAC Coordinator
By

Soma Scherr

"My day is never really typical,"
explains Davirah Timm-Dinkins,
the new campus Student Activities
Coordinator (SAC). "[However] I
know that sometime during the day
I'm going to be working with students, which is the best way to sum
up my job." Indeed, Timm-Dinkins
cites the opportunity to work
closely with students as one of the
primary reasons she decided to take
the SAC position. A 1993 graduate of Swarthmore with a major in
English Literature, she went on to
receive her master's degree in applied social and community psychology. During her years as a student she participated actively in a
wide range of campus organizations, including cheerleading,
SASS (Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Student Society), gospel
choir, Sisters (a now defunct a
capella group), Black Minority
Concerns Committee, and the R.A.
Selection Committee.
Timm-Dinkins originally planned
to pursue a career in mental health
care. She found employment with
a mental health organization, but
soon discovered that she didn't like
having to work within the confines
of a managed health care system
that often limits patients' access to
their providers. After learning that
Swarthmore was looking for a Student Activities Coordinator, she realized that in many respects this
position represented her "dream
job" because it involved working
with students in higher education.
"I feel that I made the right decision in terms of coming back here
and accepting the position." says
Timm-Dinkins. Speaking with The
Phoenix in her Tarble office, she
conveyed a strong enthusiasm for
her current responsibilities as SAC

Lewis

&

and a clear vision of what she hopes
to accomplish.
Although her job involves overseeing the one hundred or so student groups on campus, TimmDinkins emphasizes that "students
here run their own activities so I see
myself in more of an advisor-type
relationship with these groups."
Specifically, the SAC postion entails helping with R.A. training and
meeting with student groups, such
as the Paces staff and the Appointments Committee. In addition, she
sits on various committees and
works closely with the Student
Council. For those who are wondering how to start a new organization, schedule a speaker to appear
at the college, or reserve space for
an event, she provides information
about activities on campus during
informal meetings with students.
According to Timm-Dinkins, the
SAC position has expanded since
she was a student at Swarthmore,
gradually taking on a broader role
in college life. Despite conceding
that some students still might not
know where her office is located,
she feels that the campus community now possesses a greater awareness of the services that the Student
Activities Coordinator provides.
"The position didn't fully exist ten
years ago in the way it does now,"
she asserts. "People didn't utilize
it as much as I would like to be uti-

lized."
Timm-Dinkins states that her first
year will involve a great deal of
observation, since "the position is
still evolving in many ways," and
she needs some time to clarify her
responsibilities toward the students
and administration. Nevertheless,
she has already formed plans for the
future, including "my immediate
g0a1... [of] having a file on every
student organization on campus."

Gabe dimming]

Many student groups have not kept;
written records documenting the:
history of their organizations. This
becomes a problem if a group disbands after the class that originally
founded it graduates, leaving no
records for students who later wish
to reestablish the group. TimmDinkins wants to maintain a folder*
on each club that would contain
minutes from meetings, planning
information, and a mission statement.

As for her long-term objectives,
Timm-Dinkins hopes to collaborate
with the Dean's staff to initiate a
forum comprising of all students
involved in the leadership of different campus organizations. It would
meet regularly to exchange information about the activities of each
organization and to discuss issues
relevant to the student groups. "I
would like to tie in volunteerism
and leadership," she adds. "I think
that a lot of Swarthmore students
feel the need to serve, and this
[commitment to service] is evident
in a lot of our student groups:
Therefore, it would be interesting
to raise community issues in a forum."
Most ofall, however, the new Stu 1
dent Activities Coordinator wants
to be accessible to students, a per-'
son with whom they can comfort-'
ably raise questions or voice con-'cerns. Says Timm-Dinkins, flj
encourage all students and student
groups to come seek me out."

Swat CrossCountry Triumphs
at the Alumni Race
By

Karen

Lloyd

Don't worry about the mysterious white

painted lines that run behind Sharpies and

k

up Parrish beach; they don't mark yet another construction project. The lines make
up the course for Swarthmore's annual
alumni race, held last Saturday, where all
cross-country alums are invited to relive
their glory days. Johns Hopkins and Catholic University also came to compete against
the Garnet in the standard 5K course for
women and 8K course for men. Some uninvited guests to this race were the sun and
humidity, making Swarthmore's already
tough course even worse. But Swarthmore
persevered through the difficult conditions
to win the women's race and finish second
to Johns Hopkins in the men's race.
The alumni present included last year's
seniors as well as runners who graduated
in.the 1960'5. Ingrid Spies '96, won the
women's race with a time of 19:59. The
scoring runners for the women were
Swarthmore's Joko Argunloye 'Ol in 2nd
place with a time of 20:21; Danielle Wall
'9B, sth, 20:45; Alissa Parmelee 'Ol, 7th,

(Karen Lloyd 'OO, 11th, 22:26; Sarah
McClure 'oo,lsth, 23:14; and Talia Young

On the men's side, Phil Jones '99 won
the race in 28:42. The other men scorers
were Wyn Strodtbeck '9B in 3rd place with
atime of28:48; Sam Evans 'ol,7th, 29:10;
Graham Lucks '9B, 13, 30:17; Mark

"Over half our varsity team had neverrun
a 5 mile race in their lives," said senior captain Wyn Strodtbeck, "we've got a young
team and we're looking to improve." Currently, both teams are running (and swimming) tough workouts to prepare for the
upcoming meet against Allentown,
Muhlenberg, Lebanon Valley, and Bowdoin
next Saturday.

This weekend the Swarthmore women
ruggers traveled to Lehigh University. The
team broke up in two squads, splitting the
two. The A-side team defeated their opponent by a score of 25-0; the B-side team
valiantly played their first ever rugby game
and unfortunately lost 12-0.
In the A-side game, Swarthmore got off
to a quick start with Courtney Clark '9B
scoring the opening try within the first ten
minutes. The second half was no different
than the first: Swarthmore scored another
two tries with as much grace and pizazz as
a Swattie going for a reserve binder at
11:57. Sarah Cross '99 burrowed through
the opposing pack to hurl herself and the
ball into the try zone. Capatalizing on
Cross's exceptional placement of the ball,
Beth Wiles '9B kicked a perfect conversion

through the uprights to give Swarthmore
another 2 points. Wiles also contributed
an additional 3 points by kicking a penalty. Swarthmore put another notch on its
belt when Lynn Matthews '9B slammed
past the Lehigh back line to score the final
try of the game just before fracturing her
finger.
Swarthmore's B-side game survived its
first ever rugby game against Lehigh's Aside while sporting a squad of 15 rookies.
The B-side was led by captains, Elizabeth
(Phil) Meehan 'Ol at hooker and Noelle
Goodin 'OO at flyhalf. The B-side played
a hard game against the experienced Lehigh
squad. Due to injuries, two Swat women,
Kim Hart '9B and Arianna Freeman 'Ol
played for Lehigh. In the first halfLehigh
managed to dominate Swarthmore scoring
12 points. In the second half, however,
Swarthmore did not allow Lehigh to score.
Rookie scrumhalf Nancy Craig 'OO held

Swarthmore's inexperienced team together.
The men's rugby team faced several challenges on Saturday even before the opening kickoff of their game against
Millersville University.
Since being displaced from their usual
home field, DuPont Field, by the annual
Arboretum plant Sale, the Buzzards had to
set up shop on the practice football field.
Unfortunately that field does not possess a
pair of rugby-regulation goal posts. So
several members of the team decided to
construct some that morning, out of nothing but PVC piping and duct tape.
This afternoon, however, was not meant
to go the Buzzards' way however. Receiving the kickoff, Swarthmore met the
Millersville opening charge strongly, but
the team was a bit hesitant, still trying to
find a unified plan of attack. Millersville
went on to beat Swat by a final score of
39-0.

Garnet Tide woes continue
By

Pat

Donaghy

The Swarthmore football team was
blown out for the second straight weekend
Friday night, falling 73-0 to Johns Hopkins
in the Centennial Conference opener. The
margin of defeat was the second worst in
the 120 year history of Swarthmore football.
The offense struggled throughout the
game and failed to produce a scoring threat,
not once advancing past the Hopkins 45
yard line. The Tide could only muster 120
total yards, 40 of which came on the
ground. For the second straight game, the
Tide coughed the ball up six times, two of
which were returned for touchdowns.
Defensively, Swat allowed the Blue Jays

to score on nine of its eleven possessions.

Hopkins was successful both running and
throwing the ball, combining for 460 total
yards. While the defensive effort remained
throughout the game, the Tide wore down
while Hopkins dug deep into their 90 man
roster, and Swat could no longer compete.
Every time Swarthmore takes the field
this year, they will be facing an uphill"
battle. With other Centennial schools bolstering their rosters, most of which number over ninety members, the Tide must
continue to compete with just forty players. While other Centennial schools gain
fifty freshmeneach year, Swarthmore must
work with the thirteen or so out of the forty
that are admitted.

Once again, the forty players gave it their
all from the opening kickoff until the final
whistle. Tucker Zengerle 'OO and Bernard
Nossuli '9B continue to star on defense as
they combined for 24 tackles. On the other
side of the ball, Ben Hall '9B led an offensive line that allowed just one sack against
the constant blitzing of the Blue Jays.
After a strong week of practice, the Tide
are ready to take on Gettysburg, who lost
55-7 last weekend. The Tide should score
in the first quarter, something they haven't
done in 19 games, and continue to score
throughout the contest. Defensively, the
rookies are getting better with experience,
and hopefully the wing-T offense of the
Bullets will be stopped.

Men's soccer gains strength
By

JillEaton

Coming off a tough week of competition
against Top 10 Division 111 Rowan on Sunday and Division II Millersville Wednesday, Swarthmore got no breaks Saturday
when they faced nationally ranked Johns
Hopkins, losing 5-0.
After JHU got on the scoreboard in the
first minute of the game, Swat stepped up
level of play. Tri-Captain Michael Schall
'99 said, "We were hurt by lapses of defense in the beginning and end of the first
half. If we could discount them, it may
very well have been a different game..."
Schall complimented Marcus Shin 'OO
and Mike Eschelman 'OO on keeping the
mid-field strong. Eschelman explained,
"We are working on controlling the middle

of the field. I think the team is showing
improvement on that every game."
'Using the footwork ofAustin Harris '99
and Dan Lieberman 'OO, Swat was able to
work the ball down the field and get some
scoring opportunities. The ball slipped past
JHU's goalie once but the goal was retracted when a Swat player was called for
off-sides.
Despite Saturday's loss, many of the
players are optimistic for future games.
Lieberman expressed his hope, "We may
have lost today but we can take this opportunity to fine tune our weak spots so we
can be a threat on Wednesday."
After the experience of Saturday's game
against the powerhouse Hopkins, the men
took on Steven's Tech. Although
Swarthmore played well the first half, controlling the mid-field and getting plenty of

opportunities to score, they were unable to
connect.

After some motivational words at half
time, the second half saw the ball back and
forth from either end. Harris and Gus
Alberelli 'OO had good chance through the
defense but JHU's goalie solid. With less
than 20 minutes left to play, Eschelman got
the ball past the defense, sending it to
Schall who slipped it past the goalie. Rufus
Frazer '99 said, "This is when the momentum really changed for us. We knew we
could win and we stepped up our playing.
There is no way we wanted to lose again."
With 10 minutes remaining in the game,
Alberelli found Harris who went on to beat
the goalie. Swarthmore held on to win the
game, rising team morale and propelling
them forward to a hopeful victory against
Western Maryland this Saturday.

Women's soccer meets mixed success
By

Mateo Centeno

The women's soccer team traveled to
vassar last weekend to attend the annual
Seven Sisters tournament, splitting their
two games.
The Garnet Tide played well Saturday,
beating St. Joseph's 2-0. Betsy Rosenbaum
scored both goals in the game, the second
one with an assist from Sarah Jaquette. It
was a solid game all around," said Jaquette,
"though I think we should have scored
more, we did not lower our level of play.
The game also featured mid-fielderand cocaptain Claire Baxter's return. Baxter has

been out since she suffered a foot injury in
the first game of the season.
On Sunday, the team played Mt. Holy
Oak, losing 3-0. Playing with only four or
five players on the bench, the Garnet went
into this game with more injuries then it
could handle. "Our sweeper Becca
Schmidt was out on Sunday," said sophomore half- back Meredith Hegg, "and she
is important not only for her playing but
because she always has a strong voice to
bolster the team." There were many position changes for this game to make up for
the injuries. Heather Marandola and Sara
Jay played back, and Claire Baxter and

Sundays ago was the first day of
inlramural soccer games. There are ten
fcams in the league, with some old and
some new talent tickling the twine on
Gonningham Fields. In the early matches
the Fabulous Faculty/ Stupendous Staff
routed the Pittbulls with a 7-1 victory. It
only took one shot for the Willets Hoodums to sneak by Scarlet Begonia, 1-0. In
he twilight doubleheader, the prowess of
billets dorm shone through and Willets
Basement defeated a scrappy ML Posse 3• The 1-20 team started in smooth fashon, defeating last year's defending cham''ons, theLatin Lovers, 4-0.
This past Sunday was another great day
or intramural soccer. In the early games,
he Latin Lovers, still struggling to find that

foot

championship form, lost to the Pittbulls,
5-4, in the first overtime match of the season. The Faculty/Staff took control of their
gamefrom the start, handing the I-20's their
first defeat of the season, with a 3-1 victory. The later games featured a rather
vocal and enthusiastic match between the
Willets Hoodlums and the ML Posse. The
Hoodlums were one better with a 3-2 victory. Scarlet Begonia was strong throughout the entire match against newcomers
"Fuhgetaboutit." The strong goal keeping
prowess of Mike Eschelman, kept a 3-1 loss
from getting really ugly, as Scarlet Begonia took numerous shots.
On the Doubles Squash Court, Wallyball
action saw The Willets Basement sweep Da
Dana Ducts 2-0. The Ultimate Martial Arts
Experience earned a forfeit over a missing
Happy Onion squad.

Diana Hunt played midfield.
The team was well represented in the post
tournament awards when Sarah Jaquette
and Betsy Rosenbaum both made All Tournament Team and goalie Sari Altshule and
Sarah Jaquette both made All Conference
Honor Roll.
Many were surprised to hear that this
would be the last Seven Sisters tournament
to be held for soccer. Apparently, the tournament has been laid to rest due to various
complaints about the tournament from several coaches, namely those from Haverford
and Welselley. Their main complaint is that

teams have to travel so far- in this case to
Vassar, located approximately two hours
north ofNew York city- to play local teams.
Last Wednesday, the Garnet were defeated by Franklin and Marshall, 3-1. F&M
scored 38 seconds into the game, taking
advantage of an initially disorganized team.
The Tide regrouped, however, and came
back to score. Betsy Rosenbaum knocked
in the lone goal with an assist from Sarah
Jaquette. Franklin and Marshall went on
to score two more goals in the first half-a
lead they would maintain, as both teams
were scoreless in the second half.

row, and Jerome Bushnell at scrumhalf,
who did more than his share of tackling.

game.

Men's Tennis
opens strong
season against
Division I schools
By

Laurie Smith

Men's tennis is off to a good start this

fall season with two tournaments already
under their belt. Thefirst week of practice
consisted of tryouts in which the old and
new or hopeful members of the team played
against each other so that Coach Mike
Mullan could get some idea of what the
ladder would look like for the tournaments.
When it was over, twelveplayers remained,
four of whom are first-years.
Even though the spring is the main season for the team, Coach Mullan uses this
timefor practice and to determine the ladder in the spring. The team competes with
primarily Division I teams to help them improve.
Their first tournament, in Bloomsberg,
consisted of five Division I teams and one
Division II team. Nine people played in this
tournament, almost as many that went to
last week's tournament, the Tim Berman
Invitational.
The Bloomsburg tourney featured such
teams as Division I schools Yale,
Georgetown, and Boston University.
While the team did not come out at top,
freshmen Peter Schilla and his partner,
Dennis Mook, made it to the semi-finals
in the C-flight.
Their last tournament for the fall, Rolex,
will be played at home the weekend of
October 4th and sth. The field will consist
exclusively of Division 111 teams, so the
tournament should serve as a good indicator of the spring.

Field hockey still

undefeated
from Hockey, page A i

In a non-conference game Tuesday, Swat
defeated the Rangers from Drew University 4-0. Baker recorded a hat trick and
Hess again found the inside of the cage to
connect for a goal. They have scored a goal
in every game this season. Michelle Walsh
'9B and English each picked up a pair of
assists in the outing. The first goal of the
game came off a penalty stroke by Baker.
Duffy had a clear drive to the goal, but was
mauled by a defender. "Drew is a turf
team—their stickwork and passing were
excellent, but these fine-tuned skills
weren't dominant on our grass. They
would be a very strong team if they could
perfect their grass game as they have their
turf game," commented Baker. The Garnet outshot the Rangers 27-2.
This season, Swarthmore has outscored
their opponents 37-4. Leading the pack,
are Duffy, Hess, and Baker, 1-2-3 atop the
conference's scoring statistics. Hess and
Baker, each with 23 points after the Drew
contest, are just three points below Duffy.
The Garnet head to Smith College this
weekend for the Seven Sisters Tournament.
"The Seven Sisters' trophy has been a major symbol ofSwat's success these past few
years. To win it back from Wellesley this
year would mean a lot to the team and
would be a great way to mark the halfway
point to the season we've been having,"
said Sujin Seo '9B. Hess noted that it will
take "three tough, individual games" to win
this weekend. Swarthmore's first opponent
will be Mount Holyoke.

his beautiful, much younger wife Mickey

After their light plane crashes, Baldwin

their every move, and their only chance

Seriously, I loved this movie. It has the
simple virtues of logical plot structure,
technical competence, and good performances, which are three things noticeably
absent from recent studio pictures. Beyond all of these, though, is a dead-on
performance by Anthony Hopkins as a
man who knows everything in theory, but
not in practice.

all things comfortable and even, I have
never been able to understand why the
anonymous genius (Dr. Snooze?) responsible for my beloved morning delirium
chose the odd number nine. I nevertheless rely on these periodic interruptions

They Might Be Giants Might Be Good
By Daniel Littlewood

Yeah,

tastes change from
high school, but a live
performance by They
Might Be Giants can always summon up the
Love of caffeine, oh so
great parts
clever jokes,community of outcasts, and
the need to dance. There were a few kindred spirits in the parallelogram of the
Theatre of Living
Arts, but many fans
were in a frozen
leadfooted stupor. It
took until the last
few songs for the
Giants to
cut
through the haze of apathy.
The languid factor was raised by Lin-

coin, the opener, who polished off about
45 minutes worth of capable, unexciting
alternative rock. The only fun came in
finding as many blatant rip-offs of Soul
Coughing as possible: Lincoln's Lead
singer Chris Temple came out with the
obligatory shaved head, horn-rims, tattoo,
white button-up shirt, and dark pants.
Then came "Hello friends", the greeting
of choice from M. Doughty, the lead
singer ofSoul Coughing. The final proof?
The chorus of Sucker: "20-25-3035...95-100," exactly like Soul
Coughing's Casiotone Nation. The same
goes for a gratuitous version of Stepping
Stone, which changes the "original" (let
the Monkees fade away, please?) only by
speeding up the tempo. Slightly.
Do you want interpretations? They
Might Be Giants will give you interpre-

tations. For all the attention the Giants
receive for their covers, they really have
great taste in picking and rearranging
songs. Istanbul (Not Constantinople)
and Why Does The Sun Shine? brought
down the house/raised theroof. They didn't
get many people dancing, though. New
York City, by the recently disbanded Cub,
continues the streak of appropriated songs
that are well-written and uniquely performed by the Giants.
The old, original standards also fared
well, with John Flansburg joking that the
100th Anniversary tour was doing well.
Don't Let's Start, oldest of the old, was
still performed with energy and enthusiasm. The five or so new songs flowed
seamlessly into the show also, giving a
nice feeling of continuity to their illustrious career. Best of all, the band seemed

excited to be playing live, and joked with
the crowd despite a few hecklers.
Flansburg finally deflected the jerks by
mentioning that "Ecstasy really isn't
working for you guys."
The party feel finally came an hour into
the set with the conga line, which wound
slowly and sweatily around for a few minutes. It was definitely just what the crowd
needed, as the final songs had bodies in
motion. The encore kept the blood flowing, with Dig My Grave climaxing the
ecstatic communal feel. The enthusiam
and idealism was right in front as the accordion wheezed, the guitar noodled, and
the twisted tales of shoehorns etc. got
whined out over the microphone. Thank
you, They Might Be Giants, for keeping
some sense of humor and skewed perspectives in the boondoggle we call rock.

8:23 AM, Hallowell 3rd.
Bob Q. Freshman tumbles

out of bed to make his 8:30
PDC, English 15: The Concept of the Infomercial. He
runs to the Willets bathroom
only to find it flooded with
both people and murky, bacteria-filled water. Lamenting
that the US News ratings
failed to account for plumbing, he throws his cap on and
pops in a Mint-A-Burst, hoping that it will cover all traces
of last night's Beef Yat.
8:34 AM, Kohlberg 116.
The door slams, drawing attention away from Professor
Welsh-Dietrich, who's rambling about the relative sizes
of large vs. medium soft
drinks at major fast food res-

taurants.
Professor Welsh-Deitrich:

*So Bob, what did you think
of the readings?"
Bob: (pulling out the mental shovel):" Fascinating, but

the Marxist subtext impinged
upon the structural integrity of
theauthor's thesis that women
are less mentally challenged
than men."
9:45 AM, back in Hallowell.
Bob peeks into room 311,
attempting to flirt with cute
senior woman, Daisy Chen.
Daisy ignores him and continues to chat on the phone with
27-year-old Penn Graduate
student Josh Weinberg.
Dissed, Bob retreats to his
room. His roommate, Drake,
returns from Tarble clutching
his bagel and Sunlike
Passionfruit-kiwi-mangoguava-papaya-orange juice.
He heads directly to his computer terminal, where he resumes correspondence with
his virtual girlfriend, Kiki,
until the shareware time limit
runs out.
12:35 PM, Sharpies.
Bob arrives at Sharpies.
Tray, spoon, and knife in hand
(they're out offorks and napkins), he joins the pasta bar

line while lip synching to "I
Wanna Hold Your Hand." He
mentally congratulates himself on making the right
choice— Amherst doesn't
have a jukebox! Twenty minutes later, Bob emerges with
a laden tray and pauses to survey the room, oblivious to the
crowd of disgusted upperclass
persons trying to get by. He
spots the table where all the
frosh on his hall are sitting but
someone bumps his tray and
sends the glass hurtling away.
The distinct sound of plastic
repeatedly bouncing on tile
echoes throughout the room,
drawing more eyes with each
bounce.
Redfaced, he sits down as
everyone else leaves for lab.
And here we must leave our
beloved protagonist, for he is
about to enter a whole new
adventure involving Scandinavian furniture, baklava, and
castanets. But don't worry,
he's had his diversity workshop.

Denmark. Denmark. I am assuming that you know that
Danes speak neither Dutch
nor Denmarkese. Hamlet was
thePrince of Denmark, but as
far as I can tell, most Danes
are not moody monarchs arguing with themselves on

foggy cliffs over an existential crisis as if in an Ingmar
Bergman film (by the way
Bergman was a swede). There
is no obvious resemblance between your favorite breakfast
pastry and the majority of the
Danish population. In fact,
what you refer to as a Danish
is actually called wienerbrod,
or "Vienna bread" in the Danish language. ABBA is not a
Danish band and neither is
Ace of Base. Also, please refrain from any jokes concerning a certain large, or should
I say "great" breed of dogs.

Introducing our new Living
Runlde and Elizabeth Cho.

Woo

hoo! It's spy time. Get your
pens loaded with poison gas,
your secret decoders, and your
wigs and prepare for two evenings of secret agent men, one of whom is notably

better at this wine-women-and-international-diplomacy racket than the other.
The Saint is a sloppy, sappy, silly entry
into the superspy genre. Val Kilmer is at
his smoothly handsome best as playboy cat
burglar Simon Templar, but the script gives
him little to do other than look sensitive.
With great villains and a sexy love interest, this should be a good film, but it's not.
The movie begins with a nifty flashback
sequence, where we learn why Simon
Templar takes the names of various saints
as his secret identities, and how he got his
angst. Then it moves on to a nice caper
setpiece, with Templar stealing a microchip

from a Russian billionaire. From there on,
it's all downhill.
Too much of the movie is spent on the
relationship between Kilmer and beautiful,
goofy scientist Elisabeth Shue. At first
hired to steal her formula for cold fusion,
Kilmer (predictably) ends up falling in love
with her and defending her.
The movie sparkles where it adheres to
the spy film genre. When Kilmer is doing
his tricks, he's in fine form; his many disguises are always entertaining, and the action is smooth and exciting. However, the
film tries to deal with love, not sex; a nono in the spy business. The excitement is
in the seduction and the suaveness of the
main character; falling in love just detracts
from the film. Similarly, The Saint spends
too much time trying to develop the characters. Please. And can we just once have
villains that aren't Russian? Aren't there
ever evildoers in Belgium?
All in all, the movie feels padded at just

Ed straight lines, he ingeniously
created elegant sand lotus blossoms
while simultaneously interacting
with awed non-Tibetan passersby.
The sacred ritual of mandala construction had been transplanted
from its native environment—the
Monastery—and placed in the center of the library. Lobsang performed his task in a building that is
a bastion of Western academia and
a central part of most Swatties'
lives; it was an ideal position from
which he could spread his message
of cultural awareness and human
compassion. According to
"Maribeth Graybill, Associate Professor ofArt History and organizer
of many of the Tibetan events,
"Lobsang's presence seeped out"
into the college as a whole. "In a
very non-invasive way, Lobsang
was able to communicate, and the
community was very responsive."

Lobsang's project epitomized the
spirit of Focus: Tibet, a series of
events related to Tibetan culture
and issues. Professor Graybill and
Religion Professor Don Swearer,
who was also actively involved in
the program, discussed the number
and variety of events. "An advantage of the Focus on Tibet was the
number of different bases that it
covered," Swearer said. As a religion professor he was glad that "the
cultural-religious side was
foregrounded." The downside of
having so many events, he added,
was that everyone at Swarthmore
is too busy to do anything, let alone
lots of things, in a given week.
Graybill pointed out, however, that
"having the whole series vastly increased the numerical probability
that someone went to a Tibetan
event at some time."
The week kicked off with a particularly spectacular and incredibly
well-attended event, the appearance

this time focusing on the
Atomic Energy commission
and an elite group of detectives (headed by Nolte) who
are looking to expose a coverup. It never quite strikes the
notes it's looking for.
Still, Tamahori has an amazing directoral eye, and
Mulholland Falls, even
though unsuccessful, has lots
more to like than, say, Curtis
Hanson's retarded LA. Confidential (playing now). I
have one thing to say to both

films: I know Chinatown.
I've seen Chinatown. And
you, gentlemen, have not
made Chinatown.
In The Edge, however,
Tamahori finds the right note
for every scene. Aided by fellow Down Under cinematographer Donald McAlpine,
who shot Predator and Medicine Man, Tamahori creates in
The Edge a remarkably distinctive outdoorlook that pervades the entire flick. Add to
that some spectacular music

by veteran composer Jerry
Goldsmith, and The Edge is
technically flawless.
Thanks to scriptwriter
David Mamet, The Edge also
has some emotional weight as
well as great dialogue. For
those of us action fans, The
Edge's bear-trapping sequence, I believe, will go
down in history as being one
of the most manly things ever
captured on film.

under 2 hours. Not enough action scenes
to save this clunker; I give it a 3, while Jess
was impressed enough by the cinematography to give it a 5.
Dr. No, on the other hand, was a
groundbreaking flick that created the genre
of the superspy film. The first James Bond
film, it matched the acting talents of young,
supersuave Sean Connery with the fiction
of former real-life British superspy lan
Fleming in a perfect blend ofperformer and
material.
The plot's not too complicated:
Connery's 007 gambles, romances various
women (Ursula Andress, most famously),

explores the scenic wonders of Jamaica,
and drops one-liners while tracking down
the nefarious Dr. No in his secret island
lair. With his trademark Walther PPK, he
confronts various dangers en route, evades
a shark tank deathtrap, and battles a SPECTRE mastermind with a dastardly plot for
the first time ever .
While not the strongest Bond film (the
next two sequels, Goldfinger and From
Russia With Love, are better), Dr. No holds
your attention all the way through. It's almost realistic: Bond is not superhuman;
he's decidedly vulnerable, and relies less
on gadgets than in future movies. This is

Bond at its purest. Connery is the classic Bond,
and this film is what startedit all. Worth watching for historic reasons alone, it still stands up
as a great movie. I give it a 9.
Warning: do not go to Bond looking for
political correctness. The women are all objects, the Jamaican natives have all been
given low IQs, and Dr. No could give Fu
Manchu a run for his money. Still, Bond
is Bond. He is quite the stud. I, Jess, must
concur on the 9.
The Saint is playing at 7:30 and 10p.m.
on Friday; Dr. No plays at 7:30 and 10
p.m. on Saturday. Both movies will be
shown in LPAC Cinema.

Sig Rydquist's Shindig Review
Hello campers, hopefully the week wasn't too hectic, and
you were all able to get some rest for this weekend, because
it promises to be a blowout. There will be twice as many
happenings this weekend as last weekend, which means a
great deal of competition for the party of the week.
On Friday night SASS will be hosting a dry party in Upper
Tarble. If you missed the last Upper Tarble party here is a
little hint: They always have good food, so get there early if
you want in on that action. But don't fret; the music will be
loud and it will be a good time. Those of you who don't want
to deal with the stairs can stop by the Paces party hosted by
the Drama Board. Also on Friday night Phi Psi is making

of the monks from the Drepung
Loseling monastery, who combined
festive dance and instrumental music with jaw-dropping multi-octave
chants. What Swearer found most
memorable about the monks' visit
was "not the concert but their appearance in my class [Religion 9:
Buddhist Traditions of Asia]." In
this "intimate setting" the monks
had a chance to teach about life in
the monastery. Their demonstrations of debating and chanting had
greater meaning when "put in monastic context."
Tibet Today: A Symposium, which
took place last Thursday, presented
a more issues-oriented outlook.
Reena Vaidya 'OO commented on
the lower attendance rates at the
"excellent" symposium: "The performance by the monks and the
construction of the sand mandala
were great ways to inform the
Swarthmore community on Tibetan
culture. However, I think that the

attendance for the more political
components, the Robert Trainman
speech and the panel, could have
been better." Thurman's speech was
the more well-attended of the two,
though the audience couldn't contend with that of the monks; Graybill
"was pleased with the crowd."
The speech, entitled "Saving Tibet to Save China and America,"
was a rousing polemic in which
Thurman argued powerfully, caustically, and comically for the cause
ofTibetan liberation. He backed up
his argument with impressive
knowledge of modern Tibetan, and
a knack for putting the issue in perspective. For example, he juxtaposed the lack of attention that accompanied China's takeover of Tibet with the uproar surrounding
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a nation
"one-twentieth Tibet's size and
much more culturally like Iraq than
Tibet is like China." The policy of
the United States and much of the

their party debut with the "Last days of summer" party, and it
looks to heat up the cold September night. There may also be
an Indy band in Olde Club.
If Friday night just isn't enough for you, then you should be
able to get your fill on Saturday. Hola will be hosting yet another party in Upper Tarble, and the Russian club will be below
in Paces. Also come by and party with the best of them in
Mephistos in Willets.
As far as last weekend goes, both the Swim team and DU threw
great parties, and although it was close, the upper hand has to go
to the Swim Team, they really packed Olde Club for a Saturday
night. So put down the books and join the scene.

world with relation to Tibet, he said,
amounts to "collusion with a genocide." Statistics drove Thurman's
points home. Since the 50s the
Chinese regime has killed 1.2 million Tibetans, has imported 8 million Chinese people so the Tibetans will be a minority in their own
nation, and has, incidentally cut
75% of the Plateau's trees down.
Why isTibetan culture particularly
important to preserve? Tibet is,
Thurman claims, "the ultimate
Buddhist country." So completely
Buddhist was Tibet that it had no
army—and the Tibetan freedom
movement still doesn't. "After fifty
years, why haven't they blown up
any airplanes, kidnapped any
Olympic athletes?" Thurman contends that the Tibetan religious/
governmental system is a truly
peaceful institution, and as such an
antidote for "universal militarism."
Thurman was unable to attend the
second event of the day, a

roundtable forum. In a way,
Graybill said, "it was karma that he
didn't come back...it allowed
mostly Tibetans to talk" about the
Tibetan crisis. The forum revealed
some differentattitudes within the
Tibetan community, dispelling, as
Graybill put it, "the image of [Tibetans] as all coming from a
cookie-cutter." Jamyang Norbu, a
veteran activist, writer, and newspaper editor, commented from a
jaded political perspective that
challenged Thurman's representation of an ideally peaceful state.
Yodon Thondon, a lawyer for Human Rights Watch, gave a commentary on education in Tibet which,
according to Swearer, was "very
useful and very appropriate." Jessica Harbour '99 thought the best
speaking was done by Lobsang
Samten, who described his first
visit to Tibet in thirty years: "Hearing him talk about his family really
drove home the hardships people
face justtrying to lead a normal life
in Tibet."
