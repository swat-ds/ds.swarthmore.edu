Staff claims
that wages
are subpar

Student collage explores body image

By Mara Hvistendahl

Phoenix Staff

Kae Kalwaic is still unsatisfied. A few
years ago, Kalwaic, an administrative assistant for the education department, was
concerned about her own wages, which
were below the national average for her
profession. Then, in her sixth year of employment, she finally began making the
wages she had been told that she could
expect after three to five years. Now, a
year later, she advocates for increased
wages for others and for more openness
about the College's payment system. "To
me," she said, "this is an issue of inequality."

Labor conditions for non-faculty staff
at Swarthmore have been a source of contention for at least a decade. In 1989, a

report published by the Middle States Accreditation evaluation team brought attention to wages that stagnated below the
Fair Market Value (FMV), or the average
wage that a worker performing up to standards gets in the marketplace. The report
described workers who felt "underpaid
[and] undervalued."
Since then, the College has taken steps
toward fixing this problem. In an effort
to meet 100 percent of FMV, funding for
staff compensation has been increased on
several occasions. Vice President of Fi-

Maureen Vernon pastes down an element of her giant collage.The artwork, hanging near Parrish Parlours between the Admissions
Office and the women's side stairwell, explores Vernon's experiences with body image stereotypes and eating disorders.

President addresses
parking, jobs, PDCs
By Patricia Park
For The Phoenix
Shortage of campus
space seemed to be the
theme on
prevalent
Wednesday night's fireside chat with President Al
Bloom. The only solution
to many of the issues
raised is to somehow create more room on campus.
The first issue addressed by Bloom, parking, was brought up by Jordan Brackett 'Ol. Because
the limited parking space
on campus is lotteried, the
possibility of expanding
parking lots was raised.
According to Bloom, the
situtation is complex and
not easily solved. "[Expanding parking] is hard
unless we get a better deal
with the Ville," he said.
"There's no room on cam-

pus, and it would cost a significant amount of money
to expand parking space."
Bloom said that he understands that students
without cars due to parking shortages feel confined. At the same time,
Bloom said, "Part of what
keeps the campus life together is the closeness."
Bloom proposes two solutions: the college could
find an off-campus parking lot with a bus running
from campus to the lot, or
Swarthmore could provide
more transportation to
Philadelphia and other offcampus locations so that
students would have less
need for cars.
Rohan Hoole 'OO brought
up a point that has been on
the mind of every

Man behind Calif's Prop. 209

Bradley supporters gather

By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
The new Swarthmore Conservative Foundation will bring speaker
and activist Ward Connerly to campus on February 10. Connerly,
chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute, will speak on problems created by racial and gender preferences.
Connerly has gained national attention and respect as an advocate of equal opportunity for all Americans, regardless of race or
sex.
As a member of the University of California's Board of Regents,
Connerly led a majority of the regents to vote on July 29, 1995 to
end the university's use of race as a means of admissions.
Connerly also served as chairman of the California Civil Rights
Initiative campaign, where he obtained more than 1 million signatures to qualify Proposition 209 for the November 1996 ballot. The
state's voters passed the measure which would end preferences
based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin by 54 to 46
percent. It has since been held up in the courts.
The purpose of the Swarthmore Conservative Foundation, created this fall, is to "educate students about what conservatism really is, and to erase the prejudices that all conservatives are a bunch
of racist homophobic bigots," said David Thomas 'O2, the
foundation's president.
The foundation was created in conjunction with the Leadership
Institute, a national nonprofit conservative organization. Connerly's
speech will be funded mostly through the Young America's Foundation.

Committee may up student
wages by 17% for fall 2000

Phoenix Staff

The student employment subcommittee of the College Budget
Committee recently recommended increasing wages would increase
for students in on-campus jobs.
The college's working group on wages has tentatively recommended a 17 percent increase in wages for students at all levels of
the college's pay scale. The increases would most likely take effect
in the fall semester of 2000.
Under the proposal, the current three-level wage scale of $5.75,
$6.00 and $6.25 per hour would rise to about $6.70, $7.00 and $7.30
per hour.
The wage increase would cost the college about $160,000, according to Student Budget Committee assistant treasurer Marvin Barron
'O2, who is a member of the subcommittee.
Student Council co-chair Matt Schwartz 'Ol, who has long argued
for an increase in wages, said he was confident that wages would
rise by the 2000-2001 academic year.

perience outside of Swarthmore

said, that the wages of newcomers exceed those of more experienced employees.
The situation is complicated
by the fact that many staff remain confused about the
College's labor policy. Under
pressure from Kalwaic and others, the College now publishes a
table of the FMV for the different pay levels on the Internet,
but many employees do not fully
understand the wage structure.
One administrative assistant
who was interviewed knew that
FMV had a bearing on her
wages, but she did not know how
it was determined or where she
could find information about it.
Since March, the College has
had no director of Human Resources to address staff confusion. Aslanian said that the situation has "been a real problem, but
we've had almost heroic responses from the people in Human Resources." He said the College has hired an outside search
team to find a new director, and
six candidates are currently under consideration for the job.

According to the Accreditation Self-Study the lack of a
Human Resources director is
part of an ongoing problem. The
report stated that "the College
has had, as a part of its culture,
a defaultposition that dollars not
spent directly on student and/or
faculty, are dollars not well
spent. Human Resources is a
good example of this 'neglect.'"
Employees echo this concern.
Kathleen Kerns, administrative
assistant for the political science
department, said, "I think one of
the big problems is that we feel
our concerns aren't taken very
seriously, while the concerns of
faculty and students are taken
very seriously. We're more or
less replaceable."
Aslanian disagreed. "Faculty
and students are the core center
of our institution," he said, "but
the staff are crucial to the overall success of our mission."
Kalwaic would like to agree
with Aslanian, but, for now, she
feels that the importance of nonfaculty staff is not fully recognized. "They take the humanitarian approach," she said of the
College administration. "We're
always told what great workers
we are, but then they don't act
on it."

Building consensus
There has been a disturbing trend in recent years wherein issues the
administration or the Board of Managers deem "sensitive" are not discussed in the spirit of full disclosure. We have seen it happen with admissions, athletics and staff issues.
In the past weeks we have witnessed a minor uproar over the sudden
cancellation of minority pre-frosh weekend, one which could possibly
have been avoided had the admissions office openly consulted with
students before making the decision. It is understandable that the
admissions office wanted to avoid stepping on too many students' toes.
However, simply cancelling the event caused far more uproar than it
prevented.

There have been other moves in the admissions office that, while not as
visible, are equally disturbing. The split of the joint faculty-student admis-

sions advisory committee into separate faculty and student committees
seems to be yet another step away from a community of equal participants.
We wonder if it is part of a larger movement away from the consensus
system that has figured so prominently into the development of Swarthmore.
This is not a positive trend if it is so. The science center is progressing
nicely with a planning group comprised of faculty, students and administration, and the recently announced facilities improvements are largely the
result of input from the entire Swarthmore community, not just one or two
constituencies.
As the Board of Managers begins to reexamine its policy on athletics
(namely football), we encourage it to learn a lesson from the admissions
office and to make sure students, faculty and staff are included in the
decision. While we realize that the discussion and the consensus process
may cause some amount of discomfort, it ultimately will yield a decision
with which the entire community will be satisfied.

One semester down
Finally. With the last classes over and two final days (albeit a Saturday
and Sunday) before finals, you're holding this, the last issue of The Phoenix
of this semester (and if you're choosing to read this editorial, boy, you must
really be procrastinating). On the whole, this has been a productive semester.

We have seen Student Council try, for once, to tackle some important
issues. Its members have put many issues on the college's agenda, including
student space, parking, student wages, swipe card access to dorms. Its
student life ideas notably buying pinball machines and offering snacks
for $1 at midnight
have met with varying degrees of success, but there is
no question that the council has been more active than before.
On the other hand, the council has been plagued as usual by recurrent
resignations and has been forced to hold repeated elections to fill the
positions. But the election for College Judiciary Committee was completely
overshadowed by the great political success story of the semester
the
referendum on the use of Sharpies 111 that drew an unprecedented voter
turnout and the most intense campaigning the roof of Sharpies has seen in a
while.
Student Council has been notably successful in bringing to the
administration's attention one issue a notable percentage of students care
deeply about: increasing the availability of student parking. While the
council and Vice President Larry Schall seemed at first to be talking past
each other, it is clear that Schall is now aware of the intensity of the concern. We're glad that he agreed to redraw the DuPont lot to add spaces even
though it is only a temporary solution, and not all of the spaces will go to
students. It's clear Schall is paying more attention to student concerns now,
promising, among other things in a reserved-students e-mail, to get rid of
the ugly red carpet in McCabe Library.
The semester has also had its bittersweet moments, notably when Student
Budget Committee treasurer Josh Bess 'OO decided to resign after three
semesters of service to the student body. Student Council is seeing its two
co-chairs leave as well. Jared Solomon 'Ol is leaving the council, and
although Matt Schwartz 'Ol will remain in his position, he has decided not to
run for leadership of the body. We wish them all well and hope next
semester's Student Council will build on the strong beginnings of this

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

SOA was not opinion's focus
To the Editor:
There has been much conversation on
campus concerning the recent, seemingly
anti-activist opinions article in The Phoenix by Jared Eisenstat and David Ellis
(Opinions, Nov. 19, pg. 8). Unfortunately, I
do not believe that those who wrote back
defending Solidaridad actually understood
the import of the article. The responses
seem to have been written more in anger
than anything else and I think that Mr.
Eisenstat and Mr. Ellis's comments deserve
another look.
For one thing, SOA was not the point of
the article. While I am sure that the authors
were looking to promote discussion on the
issue of activism on Swarthmore's campus,
they were merely using SOA as an example.
In some respects, their arguments are valid.
Activists on this campus do not have the time
to expend in research on every issue that
they feel deserves their attention. For this
reason, they are forced to rely on other activists outside of the Swarthmore community for their information. Though Mr.
Eisenstat and Mr. Ellis label such information blatantly biased, is there any method
of acquiring information that is free from
bias? The point is not to look in vain for neutral information, but to examine both sides
of the issue.
As far as the authors' complaints that
real issues are reduced to sound bites,
they are right. But if a student group is

tabling in Sharpies, or anywhere else for
that matter, what more will a Swattie listen to? I myself have sat at that table for
long hours and my experience has been
that Swarthmore students are often rude.
Many say that they do not have the time
for issues outside of theirbooks. If someone was sitting there and offered more
than a sound bite, would you listen? How
about if they drew you in with a few words
and then offered you a packet that they
had compiled for you to read: would you
read it?
Mr. Ellis and Mr. Eisenstat seem to believe
that they are doing good by tearing down
what little activism actually goes on here.
They have good points and they seem to have
solid beliefs, but they do not act on them. To
invoke change, one must fight. Fights are not
won by soapbox pontification; fights are won
by action. I congratulate Mr. Eisenstat and
Mr. Ellis for causing a discussion on activism, but I ask them what are they going to do
about it? I also congratulate the activists on
campus who actually stand up for what they
believe in, despite the frustrating path they
have chosen.
If you have convictions, stand by them; if
not, simmer down and step off your self-created pedestal.

struck by a marked similarity between
the arguments he used and the arguments
used in a fairly famous Supreme Court
decision, a little something called Brown
v. Board ofEducation. It seems that in this
case, the Court ruled that "separate is inherently unequal." Funny, isn't it, that we
have now come full circle.
In his article, Mr. Lee makes the argument that... wait, the article is only
vaguely about minority pre-frosh weekend. Mr. Lee spends the majority of his
time talking about the broader theory of
discrimination, then mentions the actual
school decision in only the first two, and

last paragraph. As a throw away, he mentions that the move was made to pacify
some minority students who felt the
weekend unnecessarily highlighted their
differences.
A while ago, a petition was circulated
to re-institute minority pre-frosh weekend. How many of you actually signed
it? At the table where I was having
lunch, not a single student eligible for
the weekend would sign the petition.
Now, I don't pretend they were a good
sample. But it seems suspicious that if
only "some" minority students were
opposed, at least one of the five would
have signed on.
Lastly, Mr. Lee goes on to contradict
himself by saying that, even if no minority students wanted it, the weekend

should still go forward because, whether
they like it or not, societal structure
forces them to be different. Well, if we
can all agree that we want to remove
structures that force people to be treated
differently, isn't this a good place to
start?
I'd like to finish with this thought. A lot
of people are still close friends with
people they met during pre-frosh weekend. After all, it is your first real exposure to your future classmates. It seems
a shame that the whole class can't come
together, and truly be one community.
Why are all the black kids sitting together
at lunch? Maybe it isbecause Swarthmore
College told them they should.

Minorities come in all colors Minority weekend ineffective
To the Editor:
I have brown hair. I have green eyes. I have skin that burns,
hence it is light. I have Hispanic heritage, although it is not apparent to the naked eye. I am a minority. I attended minority prefrosh weekend. I am on the HOLA mailing list. During the past
couple of weeks, there has been polling at Sharpies about opinion
about minority pre-frosh weekend. I found it quite bizarre that
the pollers were asking some students to fill it out, but not others.
I then realized that they were only asking students who are minorities to fill out the survey. So I went over and asked if I could
fill one out. The first time, a student that was acquainted with me
was polling and she replied, "You have to be a minority." Then she
looked at me, and being familiar with my heritage said, "Oh yeah!
You are!" A couple of days later, I was walking by and asked to fill
another one out. This time, the poller was not an acquaintance and
she directly said, "It's only for minority students." I told her I was.
She gave me the questionnaire with a look of disbelief.
I was very offended by the fact that both pollers were basing
my minority status on my skin color. True, it may not be the same
as some one being denied a bus seat due to their color, but the fact
that my heritage is questioned just because I do not look like a
minority offends me just the same. While I may not be involved in
support groups on campus, I still very much identify myself as a
minority. When I checked the box on my application for my race,
the school did not ask me to send in a picture to verify my race.
Next time I want to fill out a survey that only minorities can fill
out, do I have to bring my mother with me to prove my minority
status?
The students are selectively asking people by purely physical
appearance. This is further reinforcing the age-old problem of
stereotyping due to appearance. If our society wants to do away
with this problem, we need to do away with it in all aspects, not
just in the classical example ofCaucasians discriminating against
minorities. It's come to a pretty sad state if minorities are discriminating against other minorities.
Amber Adamson 'Ol

To the Editor:
I write in response to Min Lee's opinions article in the last issue
of The Phoenix ("Cancelling minority weekend ignores history,"
Dec. 3, pg. 6). Mr. Lee's well-crafted essay raised many crucial
points as he assessed and evaluated the social and cultural issues
surrounding diversity and minority recruitment issues at Swarthmore. However, I cannot agree with the conclusion he draws
from his inarguably valid opinions on race relations.
We both agree that diversity and equality among Swarthmore
students are important goals to work toward, and thus minority students should be specifically targeted in order to get them
to matriculate here.
Mr. Lee himself concedes that the decision to cancel minority pre-frosh was taken because "minority students... were displeased with their separation from non-minority pre-frosh, a
move they believe unnecessarily highlights their differences."
This would seem to suggest that the effect of minority pre-frosh
weekend was to make minority students feel uncomfortable at
Swarthmore, a fact that cannot count in the school's favor if we
would actually like them to matriculate here.
As a freshman minority student myself, I can testify that the
set-up of minority pre-frosh weekend creates the illusion that
the minority and non-minority communities at Swarthmore are
hopelessly divided.
The impression given is that the two communities live together
like nocturnal and diurnal creatures: they inhabit the same space,
but each is unaware of the other's presence. The negative impact of this false representation ofSwarthmore is so great, I will
go so far as to say that I count it a blessing that I was an early
decision student. It is likely that there are many talented minority students who did not come to Swarthmore, precisely because
they were "segregated" from other non-minority students at an
event that was supposed to entice them to come here.
In short, minority pre-frosh does not bring more minority
pre-frosh to Swarthmore. Period.

Uncle Sam takes a lot of abuse

Manners? Protocol? Call me old-fashioned if you will, but I happen to come
from the ever-thinning segment of the
population that believes in such stuff.
Formal mannerism appears to have lost
its importance in the modern liberal era
of unrestrained self-expression. Don't
care for global trade? Get a trash can and
throw it through the windowof Starbucks.
Hygiene not your thing? Don't shower. In
fact, you're free to do whatever you want
even if it happens to offend me.
Let's say that I invite you over to my
home for dinner. Now, I'm not the world's
best cook and you probably won't enjoy
everything that I'll be serving you. The
meal will not by any means be perfect.
Yet, I'll be trying my best to accomodate
you and will hope that you at least adopt
a polite facadeof satisfaction. These days,
however, it seems as if I'm more likely to
get insulted with a barrage of "This food
sucks!"
Say that to me in my dining room and
I'll kick your ass right on out the door.
Yet while I hope most of us will not tolerate insults within our homes, we will
within the national arena. Time and time

again, I've encountered complaints and
grievances against the dishes that Uncle
Sam supposedly serves to the rest of the
world... and this in his own house. And that
is fine.
That Uncle Sam can continue to take
these insults and keep composure is testimony to the big guy's inner strength. He'll
fight off the pain of his injuries and continue to embrace his assailants long after
I would have personally cracked. Protest
his schools? His debt collecting? His flag?
No problem! Why, he'll even punish his
own disciples if they try to stop you.
Why does Sam tolerate this? In the
sanctity of his own home, by strangers?
Maybe he realizes that his home stands
for values greater than himself. There is
a legacy to live up to, the often-taken-forgranted yet cherished freedoms that our
forefathers first established and millions
of their descendants died defending. As
long as you're in his home, he'll honor you
as the valued guest that you are (despite

all your provocations) and do his utmost
to defend you.
As far as such permissiveness is concerned, Uncle Sam seems to be a minority of one. Many of his neighbors, both
near and far, are not as accomodating. Say
I was visiting one of those individuals in
their home and criticized the place
(though I hope that I would have enough
tact not to do that). Well, I could probably
expect my stay to be either very short or
very very long.
He's quite a guy, Uncle Sam, isn't he?
Personally, I'm not sure that I could be
quite as accomodating as he just yet. But
I acknowledge that he's the better man
for it. All I can hope is that in continuing
to study those values he idolizes, I can one
day be as enlightened as he. And hey,
there's also the hope (no matter how slim)
that Uncle Sam's generosity will rub off
on the dinner guests and they'll stop stabbing him with their forks as he tries to
seat them.

Clinton
takes stock
on 1999
President Clinton held his final White
House press conference of the year
Wednesday and took the opportunity to
reflect on this, his penultimate year in office. True to character, the President gave
himself a positive review for the year,
highlighting strengths and ignoring shortcomings of his administration in 1999.
But Clinton also displayed less enthusiasm
about the future than we are used to hearing from him. He will, after all, fade slowly
from the public eye in this coming year,
which is likely to be his last in public office.
Clinton's proudest accomplishments
this year seemed to be in foreign policy.
Clinton began his tenure strictly as a domestic policy president, having little experience with foreign policy and none in
military service. But since then, he has
built up a remarkable resume of foreign
policy achievements, most notably tentative peace agreements reached in the
Middle East and Northern Ireland.
Clinton began his press conference yesterday by announcing that peace talks between Israel and Syria were to resume. He
also congratulated himself on success this
year on the China WTO agreement, paying UN arrears, some contact with North
Korea and Iran and defending Kosovo.
But Clinton has faltered several times
in foreign policy this year. The Senate
refused to ratify his nuclear weapons test
ban treaty, Republicans were extremely
critical of military action in Kosovo, the
President is refusing to take a stand on
war in Chechnya, the coup in Pakistan or
the little boy from Cuba, and WTO talks
in Seattle last week completely collapsed.
In domestic policy, the President has less
to be proud of this year. While the President declared victory in this year's prolonged budget battle, itis closer to thetruth
to say that he did not suffer the devastating loss many Democrats feared. His push
for guncontrol in Congress was filibustered
nearly to death, and little to no progress was
made on campaign finance reform, health
care or Federal judicial vacancies.
Most of these failures are fairly understandable, however. Clinton, when looking back on 1999, neglected to mention
that the year began with his humiliating
trial in the Senate on impeachment
charges. After his acquittal, many feared
that Clinton had made so many enemies
and tarnished his personal reputation so
badly that he would accomplish nothing
for the remainder of his second term.
While he has certainly had his share of
embarrassing defeats in Congress this
year, the Presidenthas shownremarkable
skill in utilizing executive powers to bypass Congress. His office has sued gun
manufacturersand pursued anti-trust litigation against Microsoft without needing
the permission of Congress, and his peace
negotiations and military campaigns
abroad reflect his transition from a preimpeachment coalition builder to a postcoalition independent political actor.
Still, Clinton's press conference had
somber tones to it when the President
spoke of the future. The Vice President
and the First Lady, his two loyal sidekicks,
have both left the White House (though
not with each other, thank goodness) to
pursue their own political campaigns, and
the President has little chance of achieving major policy goals in his last year in
office, an election year. Clinton did say
that he strongly supported Gore, that he
looked forward to living in his new house
in Westchester County, N.Y., and that he
was happy for Hillary, who is moving
there now to begin her Senate race.
He just didn't sound like he meant it.

FORTHE DEMOCRATS

FORTHE REPUBLICANS

Why I am a Democrat Why I am a Republican

'Tis the
season to

show friends
you care
Friendship is heart. Friendship is love.
Friendship is caring. But, oh, friendship
is also political. Friendship is a cultural
practice that is not immune from dynamics of power.
Given that friendship is an important
cultural practice and given the particular student lifestyle at Swarthmore, there
are advantages and challenges to how
serious friendships can be maintained.
These conclusions have been prompted
by many friends who regularly ponder a
sort of "Friendship Theory." We've found
that the dynamics of power involved has
the potential of leaving people unfulfilled
with relationships, regardless of how
powerful a cosmic connection is between
two people.
First, sometimes Swatties let friends
they care about take second place to their
work—granted this is like other people
in the real world. Unfortunately, this
practice is especially common at the end
of the semester when there is an increasing and positive relationship between the
size of one's workload and the importance
of friendship maintenance. I have something deep stressing me? You can't plan
some time? I feel unimportant and like a
burden.
Let's all remember that at Swarthmore,
no one has spare time. So you have to
make time. Since we have a small community that is based on buildings that are
contiguous and within five- to ten-minute
strolls from each other, greetings-in-passing and drop-bys because you were "in
the neighborhood" are a dime-a-dozen.
When time is made, a friend feels special.
When unplanned spare time, or passingthrough-the-neighborhood time is thrown
in a friend's direction, they feel like a
whore getting pantyhose moneyfrom her
pimp.
Of course, it is possible that such interactions can range from a few minutes to
hours. And interactions can cover very
serious issues like faith, life and death.
The fact remains thatthere was not a conscious effort to commit time to that person, with that commitment and effort
made known in the relationship. If you
hadn't seen that friend you wouldn't have
looked for them.
While it is slightly better if you were
looking for them by going to a place
where they are likely to be, it is all still
dependent upon probability and not on
conscious committed effort and an expression of the effort made. Even if such
serendipitous interactions happen to occur with great frequency it leaves much
for wanting. There are no equal terms of
interaction, much less having such terms
known.
The bottom line: Make the effort to
show important friends you care.
Though it can start as such, a friendship
is not a friendship if it is maintained easily because of the convenience of the
small Swarthmore community or campus. Especially if you are a senior and
especially at the end of the semester,
make it clear to your friends what their
relationship means to you. You don't
want to do it all the time; who needs to
"be deep" all the time? But one should
develop a sensitivity for the timing
needed to express the meaning of their
important relationships. The stress of
the end of the year, then, is even more
cause to show serious friends that they
are important to you.

It is a dangerous thing when
a society concentrates too
much power into the hands of
too few people. It is a dangerous thing when a society systematically denies people the
right to reach their own potential on the basis of their gender, ethnicity, class, or sexual
orientation. It is a dangerous
thing when a society subsumes realistic approaches to
solving problems to a cold,
academic ideology. I am a
Democrat because I oppose
these dangerous trends in our
society.

Democrats believe that
there are some things
that should not be up
for sale. Economic
opportunity should not
be up for sale. We
believe in putting
people before profits,
and we measure
economic policy in
human terms, not by
corporate profitmargins.

Republicans would have us
put everything up for sale, even such basic things as education
and health care. They even believe that spending money is political speech, making even that most cherished thing a commodity. Having money even takes the place of honest work as
the best way to make more money, leading to the further enrichment of the wealthy few and the decimation of the earnings of the American people.
Democrats believe thatthere are some things that should not
be up for sale. Economic opportunity should not be up for sale,
so we support quality education and health care for all people,
so that they can stand on the same footing as everyone else.
Political speech should not be for sale because it gives the rich
few a larger voice than the working many in a society that believes we should all have equal opportunity to participate in
political life. We believe in putting people before profits, and
we measure economic policy in human terms, not by corporate
profit-margins. Their ideology may pose as science, but so have
all of the other failed ideologies of the past.
The Republicans defend their proposals with a blind belief in
the ideology of theFree Market. Despite the ecological destruction that laissez-faire economics created in the past, they assure us that everything would be fine if we lifted environmental regulations. Despite the company-towns, sweatshops and
child labor of the past, they assure that we don't need the government to enforce labor standards. Despite the fact that in a
country with almost 95 percent employment and many people
working more than one job, 40 percent of the people don't have
adequate health care; and they insist that the government should
not be involved in providing it.
We say, "No!" We will not let our values of community, family, freedom, and opportunity die at the hands of their ideology.
We do not accept assurances from the privileged few in place
of real solutions to real problems that we, the people of America,
face every day. We believe in doing what works. We believe in
a government for all of the American people.

Those problems
governments can

Contrary to popular belief, I
am a Republican not because
handle should be
I hate poor people, or because
handled
as locally as is
I am a bigot, or a racist, or a
homophobe. While it is true
feasible.
that there are those kinds of
people who identify with the Republican party, those attitudes
are definitely not part of the platform. There are two main
reasons why I am a Republican. While both of these tenets
appear in the party platform, they are not shared by all
Republicans.

The first reason is that I believe in small, localized
government. This is actually a two-pronged statement. First, it
means that I believe that government is not always the solution
to every problem. Society has a lot of problems, but the best
way to solvethem usually lies with people, not with government.
This means that Republicans usually look for ways to limit the
size of the federal government. Social Security? Privatize it,
with protections thrown in for the truly poor. Taxes? Limit the
size and scope of the IRS by making the tax code as simple as
possible, as Reagan did in the 1980s. You cut taxes, and you cut
spending. Let people keep more of their hard-earned money.
Second, it means that those problems governments can handle
should be handled as locally as is feasible. Who should control
education? The state or maybe even the county should, so it
can better tailor education to its smaller, less diverse
demographic. This is the approach the College takes. Who sets
quiet hours for the dorms
the RAs, or Dean Westphal?
The second reason is that I believe in providing people equal
opportunity. This is usually a point of contention for Republicans
and Democrats. First, let me dispel some illusions. Republicans
are in favor of leveling the playing field, just in a different
way. If I had to sum this attitude up in one sentence, it would
be: We believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity
to get ahead in life, but that not everyone is entitled to the same
outcome. From where I stand, when you take everyone's work,
then divide the proceeds among society equally (giving
everyone the same outcome), you have communism.
Republicans are usually not big fans of communism.
So, what does this mean? It means that children should be
given an equal education early in life, through programs like
Head Startand Big Brother/Big Sister. That way, programs that
utilize racial preferencing are unnecessary, since everyone has
been afforded the same opportunities. Under no circumstances
are Republicans in favor of separating people based on gender
or race, whatever the reason. In my mind, when you structurally
tell people they are different from one another, they believe
you, and they don't get a chance to prove themselves fairly.
Hopefully, most of you have made it this far, and understand
Republicans better. After all, we are not bad guys, we just think
there is a better way to improve society than the way Democrats
want to do it. Same end, different means. If you are curious,
don't hesitate to ask. We promise we don't bite. Hard.

GUEST COLUMN

It's a material world, from Pokemon on up
By Mariano Castillo
The Battalion

(Texas A&M U.)

(U-WIRE) COLLEGE STATION, Texas
A member of the U.S. Congress recently called for an investigation into

what he feels is a serious problem facing
America's schools.
It was not school shootings, drugs or
even smoking that concerned him. His
worry was about reports of violence stemming from the popular Pokemon trading
cards
the pride and joy of countless
teens and preteens across the nation.
Parents are up in arms over how seriously their children are taking the trading cards, which feature characters from
the popular Nintendo video game and cartoon series. Schoolyard stabbings have
been reported in New York and Atlanta,
and thefts have occurred in almost every
U.S. elementary, middle and high school.
But it is ironic that so much fuss is being
made over children's obsession with material possessions when they are simply
mimicking modern society.
"You have to look at [the Pokemon
craze] in the context of our culture," child
psychologist Stephanie Pratola told Time
magazine. "We are all obsessed with acquiring things, and we can't expect our
children to rise above our culture."
The desire to own the most recent fad
products and gadgets seems endemic in
our culture.
Whether it is driving an Eddie Bauer
edition car or organizing oneself with a

Palm Pilot, parents show their kids that
it is a material world variety magazines
glorify new gadgets, television peddles
them to the public and people go shopping. In doing so, they breed the "I want
it...now!" attitude of many children. Not
all kids are brats, but today, no child in
his right mind would pass up an opportunity to "catch 'em all."
Parents' inability to say no to their
whiny offspring does not help this trend.
The more cards a collector has, the more
likely heis to showthem off at school and
consequently get jumpedby jealous classmates.

It is a parent's responsibility to let kids
know that there are things in life far more
valuable than Pokemon cards.
The same mentality is found in college
students who work extra hours, not to
enhance their education, but to afford a
new laptop, bike or piece of clothing.
There does not seem to be anything wrong
with taking pride in ownership in the college and business world, but when it happens as a craze with kids, people go into
an uproar.
No more are the good old days when
collecting was a hobby rather than a business opportunity. Adults who remember
buying stuffed animals to play with
should see something wrong with their
children acquiring beanie animals to
peddle off to a higher bidder or to enclose
in a case. A childhood today is one where
a toy is not necessarily a toy.
The Pokemon collectors are doing just

Not all kids are brats, but today,

cards.
as their role models are doing, but they
have no income, so they turn to stealing
from each other and violence.
Parents should use the Pokemon craze
as a wake-up call to the lessons they are
unconsciously teaching their children.
The obsession the kids have is a strong
comment on American society. Families
are not putting sufficient emphasis on
hobbies and values that are not material.
The supporters of the probe into
"Pokemania" are right that it is pointless
for children to get violent over something
as insignificant as trading cards, valued
by kids or not.
However, the change has to start with
parents, older siblings and other role
models.
They need to show children that there
are other activities that can make one feel
good such as sports, music or arts which
cost nothing.

From BLOOM, pg. I

Swarthmore senior: What about

future?

dents cannot compare to the student population of any larger
university, major companies are

contrasted
a
Hoole
Swarthmore education, with its
focus on "ethical intelligence,"
with searching for a job in a society dominated by business.
Bloom reassured all fireside
chatters that although there may
be a little delay in the job-hunting process, Swarthmore alums
find areas of work that draw
upon all their qualities and
quickly rise in responsibility.
According to Bloom, the college is working to expand its career resources. Several possibilities are being explored, including finding more room for a
larger Career Planning and
Placement office; more computers to retrieve the information
necessary to keep a network of
career opportunities; and increased staff. Bloom also suggested that students can network
most efficiently by getting in
touch with alums in appropriate
fields or business areas.
Later, Bloom brought up the
debate over primary distribution

"The door to my office

we've expanded it," he
said. "And you know it is

questions."
Al Bloom
courses (PDCs). According to
him, the original idea of a PDC
was to present a broadened view
of a given course that is writingintensive. After taking such a
course, a student coming into a
field will have an expanded idea
of the large questions the field
asks and addresses.
Some students present expressed a concern that PDCs
have turned into course distribution requirements that most students feel the need to "get out of
the way." Instead of giving an
introduction to exploring a given
topic and writing about it, many
students have complaints about
the PDC requirements, particularly in the natural sciences.
Most students agreed, however,
that a PDC has the potential to
be a good course if the instructor presents the material in a
natural, easily-understood manner. Whether PDCs will stay or
go is still up in the air, but the
likelihood of their being replaced by three writing-intensive courses is very possible.
During a discussion of secu-

rity issues, the possibility of installing a swipe card system on
campus was brought up. Many
colleges have shifted from key
and lock campuses to electronic
swipe card ones. The potential
pros of such a system include
access into all dorms using a
single "key," more effectively
keeping out non-students. This
card could also function as a
meal and library card. Bloom
responded that the cost of installing such a system is unknown
and that the speed with which it
is adopted will depend on the
cost. He said that research has
already been initiated.
Other points brought up included the setup ofnonacademic
workshops. The point of these
workshops would be to expose
students to areas of skill which
they are interested in pursuing
not as an academic endeavor,
but as an aesthetic activity. Another issue was the possibility of
an entire reading week, during
which students could study for
finals, in the fall. Currently, the
reading period in the fall is
shorter than that in the spring.
There is potential, however, for
a longer fall reading period to
cut into the week-long October
break, as well as keeping faculty
on campus for a longer period of
time.
President Bloom concluded
the fireside chat with an invitation. "The door to my office was
a small one, but we've expanded
it," he said. "And you know it is
always open for you to come in
and ask questions."

"I was three and already a fan," Rod interjects. Mark was 15.
To keep juggling, they postponed grad school for what they thought would be a few
years, but those few slowly became a few more and a few more. "26 years later, our Moms
are still waiting for us to go to grad school, but it could still happen," Howard concludes.
-•—lttiese two threads of the Karamazovs' lives, academia and the circus, also explain the
genesis of the group's name. At the time when they needed to figure out what to call themselves, Paul was caught up in Fyodor Dostoevski's "The Brothers Karamazov." They began to see parallels between their stage personalities and the characters in the book.
"We were college students," Howard says. "We didn't know that no American had ever
read this book and that everyone would think we were a Russian band. We thought it was
very obvious. To us, the idea of the brothers Karamazov as a circus act was just a very
funny thing."
So Paul, "very wild and unpredictable," became Dmitri the soldier and Howard, "very
scholarly and polysyllabic," Ivan the intellectual. As others joined the two founders, they
too were christened with appropriate names from Dostoevsky's book. Randy Nelson, an
early member, became spiritual Aloysha, the divinity student. Tim Furst, hired as a technical manager, but "such a good juggler that we kept bringing him upstairs to juggle things,"
was Fyodor (Dostoevsky, not Karamazov), "the one actually pulling the strings behind the
scene."
When Mark joined, they had run out of names, and had to start recycling some of the
earlier ones. He became Alexei, the proper name of Aloysha, which is a nickname. Rod is
Pavel, also recycled from Smerdyakov, the stage name of Sam Williams.
wJ£am hated being Smerdyakov, which means 'stinky' in Russian," Howard recalls. "It
was what was left, but it was also appropriate. Sam didn't like to hear that. Smerdyakov is
the bastard half-brother who is completely different from everybody else and epileptic
and has all these different things going on. And Sam is much shorter and heavier than the
rest of us, balder than the rest of us, and a very different comic character."
Rod, like Sam, is different from the other three, so he acquired the character's first
name, Pavel.
The present set of names
Dmitri, Ivan, Alexei, and Pavel is a return to the original
four brothers of the novel, with approximately the right ages in the right order. Perhaps
this has molded the group dynamics, Howard proposes. "This feels more like a group of
siblings than it has in a long time. Paul and Mark have a lot of older brother-younger
TJnfcher stuff that they act out."
"Can you tell which one is the older one?," Paul asks. "Of course," he says, answering his
own question:'! look younger."
As is evident from their name, from the beginning, the Flying Karamazovs were different from other jugglers. They've never been interested in simply getting up on a stage and
'doing impressive tricks. Instead, they present their tricks in a framework of, an underlying theme, enacted by characters who have definite personalities and relationships with
each other.
"A show has characters and it has a certain amount of interaction between the characters and they may actually learn something in the course of the show. But generally, it's
here are some ideas, here's some cool stuff we can do, here's all the cool stuff at once, go
home now," Howard explains.
Yet this minor character development is not enough for the Karamazovs. They fulfill
their dramatic impulse even further by alternating their shows with plays that may or
may not contain any juggling. Their theatricality almost landed them in court once when a
woman who drove several hundred miles threatened to sue them for false advertising.
Having come under the impression that she was to see juggling, she instead had to watch
"Le Petomane," the Karamazovs'
play about the French performer
Joseph Pugol.
Howard recalls, "She said, 'A
show is a show and a play is a play.'"
"And never the twain shall meet,"
Paul adds.
Such rigid definitions do not apply to the Karamazovs' work, as
even theirplays stretch the boundaries of convention. The stories unfold non-linearily and the characters are often multi-leveled.
"We do like juggling other things
than just stuff, you know," Howard
says. "We like juggling time and
juggling interactions, and all that
good stuff. So in Room Service, the
last play we did, it was a play about
four guys locked in a hotel room
practicing to do a play about four
guys locked in a hotel room. It was
abouthalf the play of Room Service
iaa
and half us working on trying to do
it." They hope to develop another play in the near future.
Other future plans include a new show entitled "L'Universe" (pronounced Looneyverse)
that they are developing with MediaLab at MIT. Premiering January 12, it will continue
the Karamazovs' recent expansion into electronic media. A television show is also currently in the works.
I ask about any dream projects and Howard instantly responds with "juggling on the
moon." Paul wants to make a movie and juggle at the Temple in Jerusalem. The last has the
greatest potential of happening, Howard tells me. "We actually have that gig. When they
build the third Temple in Jerusalem, we will juggle torches on Sukkot."
Since Howard and Paul, as the older members of the group, have dominated the conversation up until this point, I ask Rod and Mark how they are adjusting to the Flying Karamazov
experience. In typical Karamazov fashion, their answers are inherently contradictory while
still making sense. Rod tells me that his life plan was to be a juggler, the only one in the
group who had aspired from the beginning to do what he now does. As that is too straightturward for a Karamazov, Paul tells him that being a Karamazov has warped his plans.
"You're not a juggler any more," Paul says.
Rod, after considering that for a moment, agrees and explains that it has had a similar
effect on Mark, altering his life plans, but in the opposite direction. "He [Mark] wasn't a
juggler," Rod explains. "So the Karamazov experience is showing him that he is a juggler.
The Karamazov experience for me is 'I am no longer a juggler.'"
"And yet we're doing the same thing," Mark says, contributing to the confusion.

'Angels': ecstasy, desperation and AIDS
By Catherine Osborne
ForThe Phoenix

thetu&e
Teen TV rings
truer than
adult drama
Fact is I keep about the same primetime
diet as my fourteen-year-old sister
teens, all teens, all the time. I'm a performer in front of the televisionand teeny
bopper TV sets me up for a lot of jokes
but that's only the half ofits appeal. There
is something in these shows "Dawson's
Creek," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"
that makes me
"Popular," "Roswell"
feel at once very ironic and very generous. I thinkthat these are the truest shows
on television, in the same way that I might
say that early Springsteen or late Elvis
feel very true and morning radio zoo
crews feel very false. It's more about a
weird and glossy kind of honesty.
Adults like game shows with Regis,
morning shows with Katie, sitcoms with
Raymond and, above all, soapy dramas
with doctors, lawyers, and/or cops. The
hour-long drama as we know it today is
an artifact of Reagan-era Steven Bochco,
creator of "Hill Street Blues," "L.A. Law"
and "NYPD Blue"
he's the fossil credited with supplanting the gymnastic complexities and knotty romances of daytime
soap operas with what critic Tom Carson
calls "quasi-reportorial settings whose
seaminess and urgency made the entertaining mawkishness of interpersonal
relationships seem trenchant." All
Bochco shows start to show signs of erosion after a while; they can't be sustained,
they wear down and eventually daring
and controversial disintegrate to stale and
silly. What Bochco did for sure though
was to pass off wish-fulfillment as gritty
realism. Adult dramas, whether they feature police officers or prosecutors or physicians, are for middle-aged people who
live in Middle America and go to middlemanagement jobs and who, on nights
when they stay up past 9, want to see fictional lives that are just full of happenings, full of exciting important momentous stuff. It's the tourism of trouble, the
sociology of shittiness, and a nation leans
back in E-Z chairs and asks honey to
please pass the chips.
Adults tune in to see who they wish they
were but teens watch to see prettier versions of who they think they are. Teens
don't want magic lamps but better mirrors of themselves. Okay, so WB programming tends toward lily-white
twentysomethings in designer clothes
mugging their way through sophomore
year of high school it's on the surfaces
that teen TV makes its greatest conceits,
with a willingness to bend the rules towardbeauty. Take "Popular," in which the
father of Kennedy High's most beautiful
cheerleader falls in nauseating love with
the mother of the school newspaper's 'unpopular' alternative princess who as, it
turns out, is also jaw-droppingly beautiful. Or "Roswell," theboring, yet emotionally totally engrossing showthat teaches
us that alien teenagers, like normal teenagers, need love, too. And, oh, yeah, seeing as how the aliens all run from cute to
stunning, it makes getting love a whole
lot easier. It's the one big cheat that people
who are so freaking hot as to make the
screen fog up get cast ad absurdum as
misfits, outcasts, losers, nerds, dorks,
marching band members, science club
geeks and glee club tenors. Even so, these
shows are deeply committed to a kind of
emotionalrealism that just isn't available
to their adult counterparts, too concerned
as they are with a willful weightiness.
Teen TV commodifies the anguish and
awkwardness its viewers will not or can
not speak themselves. So what if it pretties things up or embellishes the details,
it doesn't make it feel any less true. And
that's the thing that matters most.

"Millennium Approaches," Part One of Tony Kushner's massive theatrical diptych "Angels in America," is not a small undertaking by anyone's count. Clocking in at just under three
hours, in three acts, with three directors, eight actors playing
twenty roles and with an emotional range running the gamut
from ecstasy to the quiet desperation of unsullied hopelessness,
it ought to overwhelm the resources of a college production.
But the 1999 Senior Company's carefully modulated production skillfully leads its audience through the wrenching
minefield that was New York in the early years of the age of
AIDS.
The plot revolves around two disintegrating marriages. In
October 1985Louis Ironson (a tightly-wound Jon Stancato 'O2)
learns that his lover Prior Walter (Andrew Breitenberg '01) has
a full-blown case ofAIDS. Neurotic and terrified, Louis is caught
between his inability to cope with Prior's illness and the insurmountable, monolithic guilt which dogs him in his every step
from the moment he understands that he will have to abandon
his partner.
Meanwhile, Prior, trapped in the hospital from the middle of
the second act, transmutes his mental and physical pain into
hallucinations (or visions?) of the Messenger, the Angel (shavenheaded, delicately tough Beth Bonacci '00). Breitenberg is
heartrendingly convincing as a sensuous and unflinchingly
honest man who seeks hope in a world that isn't offering him
any.
In Brooklyn, Mormons Joe and Harper Pitt (Damon McMahon
'O2 and Kate Hurster 'O3) struggle to hide from each other. Joe,
gay and self-hating, comes home late every night to a wife addicted to Valium and longing for release to a better world. Now
Joe has been offered a job in Washington by the infamous lawyer Roy Cohn (Rafael Luna '00), and the arguments about
whether to move bring their deepest secrets to the fore.
Joe and Louis meet each other at work, and Louis gradually
draws Joe out of the closetand into his life. Tfceir partners meet,
not in real life, but in a literally through-the-looking-glass world
where, each deeply depressed, Harper and Prior can see straight
through each other. Hurster is an otherworldly presence in the
role of the childlike Harper, whose escapist fantasies eventually lead her all the way to Antarctica.
As her isolated husband, McMahon's self-questioning Joe is
affecting. It's painful to watch as he calls his mother (Sarah
Yardney 'O2) in Utah from Central Park at 4 a.m. to finally come
out to her
and, one senses, to himself. Later, confronting the
frighteningly intense Luna over ethics and politics, we feel for
him again as he tries to navigate a path between love and morality. As his mother Hannah, Yardney exerts a solid, practical
presence (she's also very funny in several smaller roles, including a rabbi and —yes, really—Ethel Rosenberg). ChySpain
'OO wends his way through the entire plot as ex-ex-drag queen
Belize, a bitchily comic confidant to Prior.
Directors Lars Jan, Seth Olshfski, and David Ryan, assisted
by dramaturg Jessica Sonnenschein, revel in both the sensuous unreality of the "Angels" dream world and the corrosive
nature of a real world imploding, filled with men and women
dead and dying. Together with Luna, they make up the Theatre
Department's Senior Company. All theatre majors participate
in the company, which spends the fall semester preparing for a
production.
Kushner means the end of the last act as a cliffhanger for
Part 2, "Perestroika." But the directorsalchemize the final minutes, giving Breitenberg a transcendent moment in the dark,
which is as cathartic for the audience as a true ending. Feathers flutter down from heaven. The Angel descends. The millennium is upon us.

Exhibit communicates sense of community
By Gabriel Hankins
Phoenix Staff
This month the List Gallery is showing a particularly social
and uniquely grounded exhibit of works by artists associated
with Swarthmore College. The Faculty/Staff Art Show runs
through Dec. 19.
Curator Andrea Packard describes the show as "an exhibit
ofmany materials and many viewpoints within the college community."
A vivid painting by Andrea Campbell (Environmental Services) hangs close to a intricate quilt by Sara Hiebert (Biology). Nearby are needlepoint pillows, massive sculptures, photographs, and collages, all too intimate and personal for a staid
and serious museum exhibit. This intimacy is the main advantage of the setting and the arrangement, giving the show a strong
sense of connection within the Swarthmore community. The
warmth of the exhibit as a whole is striking; while I have been
to many exhibits where the power of individual expression more
intensely struck me, few others have had such a sense of
rootedness in place and community.
In the main exhibit, a fantastic Freudian landscape of a child's
dream is surrounded by photographs and oils like a slip of the
artistic conscious. Created by Rodney Milstead, the son of
Donzella Franklin (Environmental Services), the drawing traces
in glitter the incredibly expensive car that for many children
symbolizes the pinnacle of wanting.
Nearby is a chair titled "Six String Acoustic Rocking Chair"
reminiscent of a twisted 50's Fender melting into the comfort
of Chevy Bel-Air, most beautifully uniting function and funkiness. One of my favorite works was MadeleineThomson's "In
Praise of Small Creatures" #3 and #4, paper and fabric collages
of beautifully intricate beetles that demonstrate the elegant possibilities of small scale, possibilities that nature has explored

could have been created at no other time and no other place:
Kae Kalwaic (Education) took as material part of the old swing
tree near Sharpies that fell in the wind, making out of it a memorial to the ights and sounds that were associated with the
tree. "The community forms attachments," says Packard, "even
to individual trees here, trees that have been part of our campus for decades." And this is precisely what the exhibit is: the

One of the Beethoven's most
beloved works, the "Emperor"
was written when he was almost
completely deaf, and is his last
piano concerto. Despite the difficulty of the piece, Chadderton,
a double major in music and engineering, said that the work is
one of her favorites.
"It feels better than any other
piece I've ever played," she said.
"Playing it is the most uplifting
thing in the world. I could be
completely tired, and the piece

would energize me."
After the concerto, the orchestra will perform Brahms' wellknown Symphony No. 4, usually
considered his best. Brahms
was a romantic composer who
came a generation after
Beethoven.
"My favorite part of the piece
is in the second movement when
the violins come in," Allan said.

Every year, classical music
lovers gladly shell out big bucks
to hear the 'greats,' so a concert
with two of the Big B's
(Beethoven and Brahms) would
definitely top the A-list at big orchestras around the world. But
there's no need to hop a train to
Philly to seek out a performance
of this caliber it's right in your
own backyard (and free too!).
After a semester of work, the
Swarthmore College Orchestra
will play its concert this SaturOn the program:

Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.
5 in E-flat and Brahms' Symphony No. 4 in E.
"It's a good pairing of pieces,"
said Eva Allan 'OO, 2nd violinist
and writer of the concert's program notes. "I think the pairing
of a strong classical piece and a
strong romantic piece has been
subconsciously helpful to the
orchestra."
The first work to be performed is Beethoven's "Emperor" Concerto. The soloist,
Kristin Chadderton 'Ol, is one of
the two winners of the college's
concerto competition held every

the culmination of over a year of

Chadderton started

This week, I am going to veer a bit off topic in
the book review department and instead ofreviewing a specific book, I am going to discuss an author. May Sarton was a Cambridge poet and novelist, and most of her novels are set in New England, in houses with faded wallpapers, cretonne
curtains, old-fashioned bathrooms and great stone
fireplaces.
Her characters, who live in a world where one
has cocktails before dinner and all of whom do
their own cooking even though they clearly have
the money to hire a cook, often find themselves
questioning the meaning of their existence in response to the death of a loved one or some other
life change such as the marriage of a child. Sarton
often writes about the struggle to come to terms
with one's self and one's choices in middle age,
making it clear that she views that maturing process as continuing throughout one's life.
I have found May Sarton's novels to be very re-

assuring. The first one I ever read, "The Magnificent Spinster," smelled of fresh-cut pine, and all
her novels seem infused with that scent. She writes
with the same wholesome objectivity as Madeline
L'Engle, and manages to do so without being
preachy; her characters are uncertain of themselves, still learning. Her novels evoke fresh-baked
bread and mulch in the garden and prompt images of the woods, ocean and sunlight streaming
across the floor.
Sarton's novels operate on the assumption that
people are basically good, and when they are hurtful, they are confused or in pain rather than evil.
On the other hand, she does not minimize the pain
that confused actions can cause. Her characters
try to deal with this pain through understanding,
belief in community, and generosity of heart.
Community is important in Sarton's novels, and
it frequently plays an interesting role in her plots.
When, in "TheEducation of Harriet Hatfield," the
title character opens a bookstore for women in
See SARTON, pg. 13

'Battle Chasers' pure fun, brilliance
story reaches a climax

in issue 5, which
contains not one, but three(!) simultaneous battle scenes. And issue 6 introduces a whole slew of new questions
which indicate that there will be many
more battles to come.

The tale which winds around these
three characters will win no literary
awards, but it's well-paced, and does a fine
job of keeping the reader guessing while
rendering this land of fantasy as an old,
familiar friend.

The skinny: When you look back at the
comics of the '9os, there is one artist you
cannot ignore
Joe Mad. He succeeded
where many others failed in importing
Japan's manga style to American comics
witness the X-Men. His work with
comicdom's favoriteband of mutants was
incredible.
With "Battle Chasers," Joe Mad's creator-owned book, the manga style has
been appropriately transferred over to a
tale of fantasy. Mad's style is perfect for
combining the giant robots, wolf monsters, mystical weapons, and brave little
girls, as if such a potpourri was completely natural. His artwork truly transcends the two-dimensional nature of
comic books.
Joe Mad, along with the help of his pal
Sharrieff, also tells a pretty darned intriguing story. The characters are as vibrant as the colors they are presented in.
The innocent Gully represents all that is
good and pure. The fallen warrior Garrison envelops all that is pain and hurt. And
the mercenary Red Monika is all attitude.

The question: There is one major problem with this book, however. Joe Mad,
artist extrodinaire, doesn't really get the
concept of "deadline." I mean, he really
doesn't get it. Supposedly a monthly book,
it took over a year for the first six issues
to reach the stands. It's been over six
months since issue 6 came out. Which
leads one to question whether issue 7 will
ever materialize.
The first six issues were once megapopular. They sold out immediately and
their prices rose at extraodinary rates.
However, comic readers have never been
known to be patient, and this wait has left
a lot of people pissed. The books' prices
are dropping and it remains to be seen if
anyone will actually buy number 7 if it
ever arrives.
My call: As if I needed another comic
on my reading list... I want number 7. And
I want an issue 8, 9, all the way up to 100
and beyond. I love Joe Mad, missed deadlines and all, and his book is pure fun. I
doubt that this work will go down as a

classic in any sense of the word, but one
cannot argue with the fun of Joe Mad's
realm of fantasy. And in the end, this fangirl just wants to have fun.

Handing my ticket to the scruffyhaired Marple employee, I enter the corridor, passing posters advertising future
films and cardboard figurine hype for

above me: two, three, four. At the end of
the hall, I've got only one screen to go. I
finally spot the sign for Joel
Schumacher's latest flick, "Flawless,"
stashed in the furthermost corner of the
theater.
I survey the audience and have no difficulty finding a good seat. Sitting, I silently attribute the abundance of vacant
seats to my early arrival. The screen

Drag queen Busty Rusty (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and ex-security guard Walter Koontz

I was right. Even after the movie began my row was empty... so was the one

exaggerating when I say that the entire
audience numbered twelve unfortunate

From the very beginning, Busty Rusty,

Walter Koontz, an ex-security guard and
hero played amazingly inconsistently by

This film has been accused of being all about sex, sex, sex. While Tom and Nicole do

Wesley Snipes plays a half-vampire wearing a garment that can best be described as 'a

The end of the millennium has the Prince of Darkness out hunting for his other half in

Author portrays
courageous women
From SARTON, pg. I I

Summerville, Mass., she at first resents beingdrawn her into

the community; but when her store is vandalized because the
vandals suspect that she is lesbian, she learns to depend on the
people around her and allow them to depend on her.
At the same time that community and mutual responsibility
are stressed, Sarton's novels also embrace a commitment to
individualism and self-fulfillment. She does not espouse giving
one's self up to the community, and she portrays as strong those
people, especially women, who have the courage to appreciate
their own company and be the source of their own fulfillment.
These people, she points out, are better members of a community than those who are unable to function outside of a web of
connections.
I have loved getting to know May Sarton. Among her other
books are "The SmallRoom," "Mrs Stevens Hears the Mermaids
Singing," "Kinds ofLove," "Faithful are theWounds," and "The
Birth of a Grandfather." I can especially recommend all of these
books, and would encourage anybody to seek out the rest of
Sarton's novels, as well as her poetry and journals.

dressing, he hears through the open window the effeminate giggles and squeals
of Rusty and his friends as they rehearse
for the night's show.
Infuriated by this behavior, Walter impulsively sticks his head out the window
and hollers, "Shut up, you fucking fags!"
and other equally intelligent things. As
expected, Rusty and his fellow performers reciprocate. These screaming
matches, the audience learns, occur at
frequent intervals and foster an increasingly hostile relationship.
In the meantime, their inevitable connection is set up: awakened in the wee

Women's swimming ends semester undefeated, men end 4-2
Sherer sets record in 200 breast
By Becca Howes-Mischel
For The Phoenix
As most people on this
campus are solely focused
on finals, both the men and
women's swim teams have
endedthe first semester of
the swim season on a high
note.

At Western Maryland,
there was no question that
Swarthmore wouldremain
on top. The men won 5625 and the women won 6427. The men swept the
meet with individual winners: JohnLillvis 'O3 (1000
free), Chris Bussard 'O3
(200 free), David Whitehead 'O3 (50 free, 200 fly),
Jason Kerensky 'O3 (200
IM, 200 breast), Yasu
Denda 'O2 (100 free), Brent
Wasser 'OO (200 back) and
Mike Dudley 'O3 (500 free).
Trying to match that score,
the women managed to
win all but one of the individual events.
Individual winners on
the women's side were
Erica Rosenthal 'OO (1000
free), Mari McCrann 'OO
(200 and 500 free), Alice
Bonarou 'O2 (200 IM),
Davita Burkhead-Weiner
'O3 (200 fly), Becca HowesMischel 'Ol (100 free),
Alissa Parmelee 'Ol (200
back) and Natalie Briones
'O3 (200 breast).
While most of the team
was at Western Maryland,
Claire Arbour 'OO, Ted
Sherer 'Ol, Amy Auerbach
'O2, Brandyn White 'O3 and
Elisabeth Newcomb 'OO
traveled to the Goodwill
Games pool for a fast
ECAC meet in East
Meadow, NY. While there,
they made quite a splash,
as Arbour and Auerbach
rocked the pool with speed
in the 200 free (Auerbach
with a personal best).
White also posted seasonbest times in the 200 back.
Sherer stole the showwith
an amazing swim in both

breaststroke events. After
winning the 100 breast
with a national B-cut, he
went on to set the school,
Centennial Conference
and ECAC records in the
200 breast with a 2:08.33,
also a national cut.
Four days later, it was
back to the pool for a
crushing win over New
York University (NYU). In
the last few years of competition, Swarthmore has
both beaten and been
beaten by NYU. This time
it was the former as the
men won 119-69. Coach
Sue Davis had predicted
that Swarthmore had the
potential to win every
event, and they almost did,
with many season and career bests.
Starting with a winning
medley relay (Wasser,
Denda, Nik Johnson 'Ol,
and Paul Dickson '00), it
was clear that this was a
meet that Swarthmore was
not going to lose. Lillvis
won the 100 free with a
season best and then came
back to win the 200 fly.
Whitehead won a hotlycontested 200 free with
Kerensky
following
closely behind; the pair
went on to a 1-2 finish in
the 100 free event later in
the meet.
Dudley and Wasser went
1-2 in the 200 IM with fast
times for both. Wasser
came back in the 200 back
with a personal best, shaving three seconds, while
Dudley came back in the
water for a personal best
in the 500 free. Sherer
once again wowed the pool,
winning the 50 free and the
200 breast. Four days after
he had set the 200 breast
record, Sherer did it again
by going a 2:07.96 —a pool,
team, and conference
record as well as a national
cut.

NFL playoff picture coming into focus Outdoor IM
soccer concludes

By Ben Keys and Matt Murphy
Phoenix Staff

With just four games left in the season, the pieces of
the NFL playoff puzzle are falling into place. Presently,
six playoff spots are up for grabs from each conference
for the ultimate chance to play in the Super Bowl on
January 30th in Atlanta. While the experts are picking
the Jacksonville Jaguars from the AFC and the St. Louis
Rams from the NFC, do not pencil in these two teams
quite yet.
The Jaguars boast the NFL's best record thus far at
11-1, but their lofty record does not speak to the fact
that they have only played one game against a team with
a record over .500, and they lost that one. Playing in the
worst division in football, the AFC Central, has loaded
the Jaguars' schedule with cupcakes: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Cincinnati, and expansion Cleveland. With the
easiest schedule ever assembled, the Jaguars have not
been playoff-tested. Their upcoming game against the
Tennessee Titans (formerly the Oilers) should be a good
indicator of the Jaguars' playoff chances. Needless to
say, the Jags' showy defensive statistics, earned against
pathetic opponents, will be meaningless when playoff
time rolls around.
Jacksonville's strongest competition will come from
the Indianapolis Colts. Led by the rapidly-maturing
Peyton Manning and rookie-of-the-year candidate
Edgerrin James, the Colts' potent offense will be a stiff
challenge to Jacksonville's top-ranked defense. Indianapolis has won a number of tough games, including a
37-34 nailbiter over the Miami Dolphins this past weekend. If Manning can keep his cool and not give up any
big interceptions, the Colts are our favorite to make the
Super Bowl, despite Jacksonville's impressive regular
season.
In the NFC, the Rams have assembled the league's

best offense. Former arena-league star Kurt Warner has
been the league MVP thus far, throwing for a whopping
3,219 yards and 32 touchdowns.With Marshall Faulk in
the backfieldand targets Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt in
the widereceiver slots, Warner has a myriad of options.
St. Louis's defense is much improved and currently
ranks second in the NFC. One of the keys to the Rams'
success has been their ability to prevent the big play. If
their defense keeps it up, there is no stopping the improbable rise of the St. Louis Rams.
The team with the best shot to knock off the Rams is
the perennially dismal Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which
shows you just how weak the rest of the NFC is. A big
24-17 win over Minnesota on Monday Night gained the
Bucs the national recognition they deserve. Their defense is the stingiest in the conference, and their offense
is coming around after a few weak showings early in
the season.
There are a few other contenders in both conferences
worth mentioning. Those boring old Buffalo Bills are
back again, and with quarterback Doug Flutie at the
helm, they are fighting for the second spot in AFC East
with the ageless Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins.
Tennessee and the Seattle Seahawks will factor into the
playoff picture as well. Dallas and Washington are playoff-bound out of the anemic NFC East. Detroit and Minnesota will round out the card from the NFC Central.
Surprisingly, neither the 49ers nor the Packers will be
playing in late January. How quickly things change in
the NFL. Dynasties might be a thing of the past in this
new topsy-turvy, free-agent-driven league. Thanks to
revenue-sharing, teams in cities like St. Louis and Indianapolis can compete with the big-market monsters.
Other professional sports should copy the NFL's successful strategy. This will be the year of the little markets
Indianapolis over St. Louis in the Super Bowl. You heard
it here first.

Women's basketball wins after placing third in Seven Sisters
By Caitlin Ryland and Chris-

attempts.

tina Ciambriello
For The Phoenix
The

members

of

the

Swarthmore Women's basketball
team recently attended their an-

nual family reunion. This

get-to-

gether is a traditional event
where Swarthmore and co-Little
Ivies Mount Holyoke, Wellesley,
Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, St.
Joseph's of Connecticut (invite),
and our old favorites Haverford
gather together in the style ofall
family gatherings, with tensions
high and a fighting attitude in the
air.
This year was no different, as
Swarthmore battled it out for
family feud rites in three hardfought games, eventually claiming third in the tournament.
Swarthmore opened the Seven
Sisters tournament this past Friday with a convincing victory
over Mount Holyoke College,
winning 59-46. Boasting a full
roster of 18 players, Mount
Holyoke's substitutions have
been likened to a "Chinese fire
drill." Swarthmore, as the more
disciplined and experienced
team, handled the intimidating
numbers with poise and intelligence. Both squads came out
strong in the first half. But in
the second half, foul trouble and
turnovers plagued Mount
Holyoke.
The Garnetcashed in from the
free throw line and converted
turnovers to seal the win. In the
contest, Heather Kile 'O2 ripped
down 15 big boards and converted on 21 points. Heather
Marandola'Ol stepped up as the
second leading scorer with 14
points andfive steals. The physical nature of the game wore on
the Garnet Tide as they were outrebounded 43-41 despite getting
the job done on the scoreboard.
A tired Swarthmore squad
showed up for the next day of
athletic competition on Saturday.
The team fell 59-40 to Wellesley
College. Dismal shooting percentages and few rebounds contributed to the loss. The Tide was
30.6 percent from the field, shot
an embarrassing 6.7 percent
from the three-point arc, and
converted an uncharacteristic
16.7 percent of their free throw

Despite a better-rounded effort by the Garnet on the boards
than usual, they were out-rebounded 43-34 in the game. Kile
led the team in scoring with 23
points.
According to coach Rebecca
Cusumano-Seidel, the loss "demonstrated that we still have some
mental training to do; we need
to mentally make ourselves play
40 minutes of good Swat defense." The team rebounded and
accomplished just that for the
third and final day of Seven Sisters.

In competition for third place
and a seat in the winner's bracket
for next year's tournament
schedule, the Garnet squad
trounced St. Joe's College ofConnecticut in an impressive 81-47
victory. Factors contributing to
this 34-point margin included
aggressive defensewithout fouling, a strong showing on the
boards, and large production
from the bench.
Swarthmore forced the opponent to connect on only 31.7 percent of their field goals in comparison with Swarthmore's imposing 51.6 percent from the
field. Boxing out and Garnet
athleticism
the
helped
Swarthmore women muscle
down 22 more rebounds than the
St. Joe's squad.
Every member of the Tide
scored in the contest, but the
team was led by Kile's 19 points
and 15rebounds. Katie Tarr 'O2
stepped up to seal the win with a
well-rounded offensive and defensive showing. She was four
out of seven from the field, three
out of four from behind the arc,
perfect from the charity stripe,
and grabbed six total boards.
When asked why she waited until the third game to light it up,
she replied "You just can't rush
perfection."
This past Wednesday, continuing their Centennial Conference
success (6-2 overall and 2-0 in
play),
Conference
the

Swarthmore women bailers extended their record in the wins

Conference foe Washington College (1-5 ovarall and 0-2 in Con-

ference).

Team has three convincing wins

By Paul Witlenberg
For The Phoenix
Undaunted by impoverished numbers, the Swarthmore

College wrestling team swept with three convincing victories this weekend in a home quadrangular tournament. The
wrestlers beat Centenary College 37-18, SUNY Maritime
25-18, and Valley Forge Military Academy 36-18.
Every Swarthmore wrestler had two victories out of a
possible three, including one by fall. Ted Chan 'O2 (165 lbs.)
and Les Fox 'O2 (184 lbs.) are both 4-0. Chan is beginning to
develop a personal style as he decked two on the day.
Dan Jacobs 'O3 (125 lbs.) is 5-0 with four coming by fall.
Mike Evans 'O2 (157 lbs.) is 3-0. Evans pinned his opponent

from Centenary in 41 seconds. Jacobs' decking came in 0:53
against SUNY Maritime. Co-captain Jesse Bean 'OO scored
two crucial victories. Pete McKee 'O3 also scored two wins,
one by fall. Heavyweight Paul Willenberg 'OO pinned quickly
as well, taking two opponents to their backs.
Bean noted that the team has a lot of largely-untapped
individual talent. "The team outlook is focused on individual
success," he said. "We have a tremendous amount of raw
talent that we are working to hone." With more solid individual performances like Saturday's, the team can look to
even more success.
The wrestlers are off until January, when they take their
training routine south to a warmer clime. "I don't care which
island we go to," emphasized Fox, "as long as it's warmer
than Montreal."
The team will open the new season with tournaments every weekend starting in mid-January.

SCOTT KUSHNER

By Michael Jeffries and Ben Park
Phoenix Staff

Two years ago, when I was just a spec
deciding whether to attend Swarthmore,
I was seduced with fanciful stories of a
glorious new athletic center. I was told
that the state-of-the-art facility would be
up and running by my freshman year so
that I could begin turning my puny physique into a temple.
Well, two years have passed, the athletic center is not yet completed, and my
body is feeling more like Papazian than a
temple. Now that I am here, I have to take
on the role of lying to prospective students. I hosted a baseball spec last weekend who was very interested in seeing our
"weight room facility."
"Well, uh, you see, ummm...l would
take you there," I gulped, "but, uhhh, the
Sixers, no the Phillies, yeah the Phillies,
are holding a private off-season workout
there right now. Yeah, you know how
those major leaguers are, when they see
a weight room they like, it's hard for them
to let go." I hope he bought it.
The athletic facility is scheduled to
open next semester, and I am waiting with
baited breath to see if it is going to be as
good as it is hyped up to be. So much
money, time, and manpower has been
pumped into this project, I expect nothing short of a Bally Total Fitness Center.
My anticipation for the facility has led me
to fantasize a bit about some of the possible (yet improbable) amenities con-

Two years have passed, the

tained within.
I want an industrial strength air conditioner so I do not feel like I am working
out in an oven as I currently do in the field
house. I want different areas and different surfaces for every sport. The present
putrid orange sponge turf we have in the
field house isn't good for any sport. I want
hardwood courts for basketball, Astroturf
for the field sports, actual indoor tennis
courts, and a track where spikes are allowed.
I expect Swarthmore to have spared no
expense to make this fitness center as
pristine as possible. I expect much more
than just having weights without rust and
mildew. I expect more than just having
weight rooms the size of my dorm room.
I expect Rebecca Romijn to teach an aerobics class while Billy Blanks himself is
leading Tae Bo exercises.
I need a Jacuzzi to soak my sore
muscles. I need a sauna to sweat my pains
and worries away. I need to stretch out in
a steam room so my fat can seep out of
my pores. And if for some reason the
Jacuzzi, sauna, and steam room do not do
the trick, I need a Swedish Ice Princess
with long blonde hair, bright blue eyes,
and big soft voluptuous
hands, to give
me a full-body massage after a tough
day's practice. I need her to rub the
cramps out of my feet. I need her to work
the knots out of my lower back. I need
to get a grip.
The fact of the matter is, there probably will not be any industrial strength
air conditioner. As for installing
Astroturf, I doubt it. I'm not counting on
those luxurious weight rooms. Rebecca
and Billy will never set foot on our campus. I will not be resting my weary body
in a Jacuzzi anytime soon. And as for the
lovely Scandinavian masseuse, I'll cross
my fingers, but I won't hold my breath. A
guy can dream, can't he?

The Garnet followed up their victory
against the GreenTerror with a tough loss
Tuesday night (12/7) to the Shoremen of
Washington College. Washington picked
up its 50th victory ever against the Garnet with an 80-70 fireworks display. The
men's squad played the fast-paced
Shoremen to a 35-35 standoff at half-time,
thanks mostly in part to a 10-0 run which
tied it at 25 with 6:31 left in the half. Culley
contributed three baskets and a free
throw during the tying run. Also impressive was guard David Pearce 'O3, who
scored eight in the half, including two of
four from behind the three-point arc.
"[Pearce] had some sweet shots," agreed
Gammill and forward Kyle Lewis 'O2.
Washington opened up the second half
with an 11-4 run behind the unique style
of play by their star guard GregAdams
'Ol. Adams, who scored 19 and led all players on eight of 11 shooting, played tough
defense and tossed in a few incredible
baskets to put the Shoremen up 47-37.
According to Lewis, Adams is a talented
player. "Charlie [Brubaker] and I were
guarding [Adams] on the break," he said,
"and then he just jumped so far back and
just threw the ball up swish."
Swarthmore struck back immediately

with six unanswered points to bring themselves within two with 13:33 left in the
half. However, they came no closer than
47-49. Washington held the Garnet to
three points over three minutes as they
took off on a 13-3 run, which included a
three-pointer by Adams from a distance
of 24 feet, to lead 62-52 with 9:14 remaining. As Garnet misses turned into
Shoremen layups, Washington reeled off
a 9-2 run which eventually became a
twenty-point lead at 57-77 with 4:30 left
in the game.
After seven in a row by the Garnet
brought them back to 13 behind with a
minute left to play, guards Isaac Cohen
'O2 and Eli Silk 'Ol and forward Zak
Gelacek 'O3 entered the game for the first
time. A couple of assists by Cohen gave
Swarthmore its final margin.
Coach Lee Wimberly spread the playing time on Tuesday night, as eight men
saw ten or more minutes of action. Partially due to Wimberly's displeasure with
GammiU's play, forward Josh Leffler 'O3

put in 17 minutes. Pearce and Ganot also
saw considerable play time. "The freshmen stepped up," Gammill said. "[LefflerJ
played really well."Pearce logged 25 minutes for the game as he scored 15 points
to lead the Garnet along with Brubaker.

0-6 from beyond the arc, although he did
manage six assists and three steals.

The Swarthmore College men's basketball squad started their season off by going 1-1 in the Equinox Classic, an annual
season opener for both the Garnetas well
as the Haverford Fords.
Their opening game against Randolph
Macon (11/19) resulted in a 56-53 loss. Cocaptain guard Gregg Holtmeier 'OO led
the Garnet with 14points on five for eight
shooting. Swarthmore missed the chance
to tie the game when co-captain Joe
Culley 'OO hit therafters with his inbounds
pass. Culley, a forward, currently leads
all players with two such plays. His most
recent came at the end of the first half of
their Tuesday night game against Washington, on a last second shot attempt.
The next day, Swarthmore traveled to
Haverford to complete the second half of
the Classic against Heidelburg College.
The Garnet trounced their unfortunate
opponents 76-61 in what still stands as
their most lopsided victory of the season.
The Garnet shot a blistering 67 percent
in the second half, including 7-10 from
beyond the three-point arc. Guard Charlie
Brubaker 'O2 notched a career-high 20
points against Heidelburg to lead all scorers, and Holtmeier added another 18,
missing only three shots all game.
Holtmeier's six assists helped him secure
a spot on the All-Equinox Classic Team
as well as the Centennial Conference
Honor Roll.
The Garnet did not fare so well as they
left Tarble Pavilion for venues such as
Gwynedd Mercy (11/23), Rensellaer (11/
27), and Union (11/28). Swarthmore
outscored Gwynedd Mercy by 13 points
in the second half, but it was not enough;
they fell 77-75. Joe Culley scored 20 points
and pulled down 12 rebounds for his first
career double-double.
Guard Eran Ganot 'O3 followed up
scoreless outings against Gwynedd
Mercy and Rensellaer with 14 points
against JJnion in the Garnet's 92-59 loss.
Center David Gammill 'O2 had 16 points
and 12 rebounds in the Garnet's fourth
loss of the season.
Swarthmore began Centennial Conference play with a strong showing at home
against Western Maryland, beating the
Green Terror by a score of 68-58.
Holtmeier finished with a game-high 21
points and six steals, as Swarthmore shut
the door in the second half with great
team defense.
The Garnet Tide held Western Maryland to just 26 points on 35 percent shooting in the final period, and kept all-conference selectionBrian Billman in check
as he finished with only 10 points in 35
minutes. "It was a good win for us because
we wanted to make a statement within our
conference," said Gammill. "We were
definitely undersized, but we helped each
other out and overcame that disadvan-
