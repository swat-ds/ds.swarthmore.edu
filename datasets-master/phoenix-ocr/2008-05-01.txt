Students act in support of Rivero after tenure decision
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY: ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu

Prompted by the college's decision to deny tenure to
Spanish language and literature professor Horacio Chiong
Rivero earlier this semester, a numberof students have continued to express their support for the reconsideration of
this decision by collecting signatures for a collective letter,
as well as chalking on campus. Currently, any review of the
original tenure decision is still under consideration by the
Department of Modern Languages and Literature.
On Feb. 23, Rivero was informed through e-mail of the
decision to deny him tenure. According to Rivero, the e-mail
stated that his "continuing presence was perceived as a problem by the department and the college." A denial of tenure
means that a professor has one year left of employment at
the college before he/she must leave. Additionally, the e-mail
informed Rivero of his options for going through the reconsideration and appeal process.
Immediately, Rivero submitted a letter to the Committee
on Promotion and Tenure asking for a reconsideration of the
decision to deny him tenure. Because the college does not
inform students of which professors have or have not been
awarded tenure, Rivero decided to personally notify some of
his current and former students of the decision.
"When 1 did tell them, a lot of the students, there was a lot
of reaction on their part," he said. "Confusion, they were
very surprised, in disbelief, and immediately another reaction was 'Well, is it completely over and can we do anything
about it?' So, at that point, I thankedthem profusely for their
support... I'm still overwhelmed by it."
Although Rivero was uncertain as to how the advocacy of
students would affect his request for an appeal, several students mobilized in support of Rivero's presence at the college in an attempt to reverse the tenure decision.
"Personally, Professor Chiong Rivero communicated
to me that he hadn't received tenure," Diego GarciaMontufar 'O9, one of the student supporters and a previous Writing Associate for one of Rivero's classes, said.
"And my reaction was of complete amazement because I
had written a letter for him. I have written letters for a
bunch of professors and I thought he was a given, that he
would get tenure."
"I was pretty shocked," Erin Floyd 10, another student
supporter, said. "I'm taking Spanish IV with him right now.
And this is my first class with him and it's at 8:30 in the
morning and he brings so much life to that class. I know I

Clare Galpern) in a Spanish language class. Rivero may be forced to leave next year if his tenure appeal does not pass.
keep telling people this but I actually enjoy going to an 8:30

class."

"We heard right before Spring Break," Claire Galpern 'lO,
another student supporter, said. "Right after Spring Break
we wrote a collective letter of support for him and got the emails of his current and former students, and trying to ask
them if they would want to sign it, and the support that came
back was just overwhelming
Then we kind of realized
there was just this overwhelming support for him and it
made us ask even more why would we let this professor go."
Within the collective letter, which more than 100 people
signed, the students stated their general support for Rivero
as their current or previous professor and endorsed the continued presence of Rivero as a tenured professor at the college. (The collective letter was published in the Letters to the
Editor section of The Phoenix two issues ago.)
Soon after, various student supporters were active in con...

tributing to the chalkings found around the buildings of
Parrish and Kohlberg a few weeks past, as well as the banner of signatures with the statement: "Our vision for
Swarthmore 2020 includes Horacio Chiong Rivero as a
tenured professor."

These students also contacted members of Student
Council, who in turn sent an e-mail out to all students and
several administrators last Monday entitled "An Open
Letter Regarding Tenure," emphasizing the importance of
student input in the tenure decision-making process.
After recognizing the necessity of becoming more
informed about the tenure process, student supporters drafted a second letter to the provost of the college. They also met
with the provost in order to learn more about the details of
the procedures contained within the tenure process.
"The second letter was more about the process of tenure,
saying that student input should be taken seriously and that
pushing for the tenure committee to base its decision on the
procedures that it established which are available on the faculty handbook," Garcia-Montufar said. According to a section of the faculty handbook entitled "Employment and
Compensation for Instructional Staff," the decision to grant
tenure to a faculty member is based on three general characteristics: teaching, scholarship and service in the larger
community.

See TENURE, p. 7.

NEWS IN BRIEF
College implements telephone messaging system for disseminating information in emergency situations
On Monday an e-mail from Dean Jim
Larimore informed students of the college's implementation of Connect-ED®, a
new emergency telephone messaging system. Larimore's message requested that
students record their telephone contact
information in mySwarthmore, and
informed them of a test-run of the system
to be conducted on May sth at 1:30 pm.
In light of numerous institutional and
national emergencies, an emergency message system is one part of the college's
plan to ensure everyone's safety. "It is
hard to define in advance what types of
emergencies we will face and since 9/11
and more recently the Virginia Tech disaster and Katrina It is clear that one has to
be prepared to respond to whatever presents itselfand to identify and put in place
the tools that will allow you to do [this]
effectively," 'Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l said in an e-mail.
According to Associate Vice President
of Facilities and Services Stu Hain the college has a steering committee for emergency preparedness, which includes members Hain, Larimore, the Provost AVP for
Human Resources, the Director of

THE PHOENIX

Communications, the Director of Public
Safety, the Director of Maintenance, Chief
Information, the Technology Officer, the
Associate
Database
Director,
Management, the Housing Coordinator,
the ADA Program Manager, the Executive
Assistant, of Facilities and Services, the
Technology Coordinator of Facilities and
Services and the Environmental Health
and Safety Officer.
Starting last fall, the steering committee considered a number of service
providers before settling on Connect-ED®.
"When we decided to look at notification
software, we took a look at the various
companies offering these services, all of
which offer very similar capabilities and
pricing. Our decision to sign-up with
Connect-ED came after a review of the
product and conversations with peer customers such as Williams [College],
Amherst [College], and Reed [College],"
Associate Director of Enterprise Systems
GlennStauffer said in an e-mail.
Connect-ED® sends mass messages to
many people at once in the forms of e-mail,
voice mail and text messages. Within his
message to students, Larimore clarified

May

that students may opt out of receiving text
messages.
According to Stauffer, Connect-ED®
runs out of different servers in different
locations across the U.S., and requires that
an authorized individual log into the system to send pre-composed or new messages. "The actual [delivery] time varies
and we are currently doing testing tp
ensure that our expectations are in line
with the confirmed performance of the
system," Stauffer said in an e-mail.
While many people and departments
have been involved in the decision-making processes, much of the system implementation has been undertaken by
Information Technology Services and
Human Resources. According to Ham,
Connect-ED® will cost the college $B5OO

annuauy.
Connect-ED® is currently used by a
number of institutions in addition to the
college. "Their customers include a fairly
broad spectrum of small liberal arts colleges, community colleges and large universities such as Williams, Reed, Amherst,
Tulane
[University],
Princeton
[University], [University of] Notre Dame

X 2OOB

and Georgia Tech, among others. Since
Connect-ED is now owned by Blackboard,
one can only anticipate further growth in
their Higher Ed customer base," Stauffer
said in an e-mail.
The new system will be used in accordance to the college's communications
plan, which defines threatening situations
as those that may cause "loss of life,
injuries, or other harm to members of the
Swarthmore community [or] substantial
damage to the college, be it physical or
environmental."
According to Eldridge, Connect-ED® is
not the only system being put in place to
ensure safety. The college is currently able
to send mass voice mails to all campus
phones.
A loudspeaker system is hi the works,
with the intent of reaching all classrooms

and offices in case of an emergency.

Additionally, Eldridge noted that the college has been working on developing and
upgrading its crisis management system

over the past several years.
Students are asked to register their
phone numbers by this Friday, May 2nd.

New parking committee to meet WEEK IN PICTURES
BY MATT BLEIMAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

The parking committee, which evaluates applications for parking permits,
has been recently restructured to

increase transparency and work more
efficiently. Assistant Director of Student
Life Kelly Wilcox '97 will be serving as
the chair of the parking committee this
year. She explained that the committee
felt there was a need for clearer guidelines in the ranking and criteria used to
award parking permits.

"My goal is not to make
everyone happy but to
create an efficient and
fair process."
Kelly Wilcox '97
Assistant director of
student life
Associate Dean of Student Life Myrt

Westphal explained that the committee
used to be run by students and staff and
that permits were given out based on seniority. A couple of years ago, Student
Council decided that they wanted to have

more control over the distribution of

parking permits so they made a parking
committee. "It was never really fully peopled and it ended up being one or two
people making all of the decisions," said
Westphal.
In the past year, Student Council had
to rescind all its previous decisions and
start again. The focus of the committee
changed from seniority to tasks that
require cars on campus. "If you were in a
group and provided transportation for
the group, that was given higher precedence than seniors," Westphal said.
Seniors who had been waiting for permits found that they were taken by
underclassmen. Westphal said, "We
found that it was time to review the parking situation and design a new committee."

"[The committee] was
never... fully peopled and
it ended up being one or
two people making all of
the decisions."
Myrt Westphal
Associate dean of
student Life
There is an understanding on the
committee that not everyone will be satisfied because there are not enough permits for everyone who requests one.
Wilcox said that she believes that by
making the process clearer and more
transparent to the student body there
will be less frustration with the process.
"As long as there is an understanding of
the process that is seen as fair and collaborative then I think the frustration is

going to be reduced," Wilcox said. "My
goal is not to make everyone happy but
to create an efficient and fair process to
be as open and transparent as I can."

The committee also wanted to expand
the range of voices serving the committee. RAs and members of the administration now serve on the committee. In addition to Wilcox, Westphal and Terri
Narkin of Public Safety are serving on
the committee as well.
According to Louis Rosenberg 'O9, a
former member of the committee, the
committee previously only consisted of
Terri Narkin and two student members.
"It became clear that the workload of pro-

cessing hundreds of applications was
more demanding than appropriate for
two students, and Student Council members increasingly shouldered much of the
committee's responsibility," Rosenberg
said. "The committee had to evaluate
applications for veracity as well as
weighing factors such as seniority and
importance of extracurricular and personal obligations." This led to the expansion of the committee to include deans

and RAs.

"Terry Narkin, who has been with the
college over twenty years, can invoke the
institutional history and guide us on how
to best pursue the process," Wilcox said.
"I think she had the greatest vantage
point of why changes and improvements
need to be made and was instrumental in
meeting with the planning session last
fall to have a brainstorming session

where students, administrators, and staff
evaluated where the process had been

and where it needed to go."
The result of the brainstorming was
the creation of a new application for permits and more appointments to the committee.
Having a larger committee also gives
more insights into parking permit appli-

cations. "By having a larger committee

we have a sense of who is stretching the
truth on their application and whose
needs are legitimate," Westphal said. She
explained that they are now requiring
signatures from supervisors to make
sure people are making legitimate
claims.

This year's application for a parking
permit explains that, '-factors considered
first are special needs (disability or medical), seniority and organizations needing a car (1 per group). Secondary factors
include commuting, jobs, internships,
family needs and/or religious observanc-

es."
The committee will be meeting for the
first time on Monday to evaluate each
proposal based on this criteria. Wilcox
said, "I think in the past this criteria was
more ambiguous
it was known by the
committee but not necessarily by the
applicants so now were hoping the applicants understand the criteria that is
being used to judge their applications."
To accommodate students who do not
have cars on campus, the committee
looked at the parking situation holistically and decided to bring Philly Car
Share on campus.
"We want every student to be able to
have access to transportation and we feel
that as an institution if we can't provide
it through parking spaces we hope to do
it through other venues," Wilcox said.
The committee is also looking at other
options for subsidizing rail travel and

looking into sustainability options to
keep the campus green.
This year is the just the first step.
Wilcox hopes that the committee will
continue to make changes and grow and
said that the committee is open to suggestions and feedback regarding any

BYOB 'Rudi's' bistro to replace Da Vinci's in the ville
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
Just over a months after Da Vinci's cafe closed uncer-

emoniously amidst rumors offinancial failure, a sign has
appeared in the window of the vacant store announcing
the opening of a new restaurant, Rudi's on Park, which is
expected to occupy the Park Ave storefront.
The telephone number posted on the sign belongs to
Jack Cavanaugh, president of the board of managers of a
new LLC
limited liability corporation that will be
guiding the opening of the new bistro. The LLC is composed of 45 to 50 investors. While the groundwork for the
project was established in February, the corporation was
officially launched two weeks ago, Cavanaugh said.
Although Cavanaugh acknowledged that the restaurant industry is fraught with risk, he said he believes
that his investment is grounded in solid business principles. "[Restaurants] are inherently risky," he said, but
this Bistro not necessarily more than others, despite the
economic problems that former Da Vinci's proprietor
Chris Bruno allegedly faced with Da Vinci's.
According to Cavanaugh, the new Bistro will be completely unlike Da Vinci's, more upscale and with a wider
clientele. Furthermore, the permissibility of alcohol on
by way of the restaurant's Bring Your Own Bottle
site
(BYOB) policy
is an additional enticement to potential
diners, in a borough that does not grant liquor licenses to
its restaurants. Cavanaugh hopes to see community
members frequent the bistro with wine bottles in hand.
The "casually sophisticated bistro," as Cavanaugh
described it, will feature dinners ranging from $l6 to $2B,
as well as Sunday brunch. An experienced chef will run
the kitchen, and an architect will redesign the space.
This includes installing new fixtures and appliances.
"We have an architect and a restaurant designer that's
working on the decor, so we're in the process of getting
our permit," Cavanaugh said. The board of managers
hopes to create a restaurant similar to the BYOB establishments in Philadelphia and Media.
The space once occupied by Da Vinci's will be renovated and redecorated under the direction of professional architect Elisabeth Knapt. She's been working on
restaurants specifically for three years, and the Bistro
will be her sixth restaurant project.
According to Knapt, the Bistro will seat somewhere
between 40 and 44 people in a dining space slightly smaller than that of Da Vinci's. The Bistro may also offer outdoor seating facing the train station, with umbrella
-

-

tables. Diners will be able to look into the semi-open
kitchen through glass.
"I believe it's going to be open for lunch and dinner,
and the menu's going to be changing by the season, and I
think some daily specials that have to do with what [the
chef has] picked up at farmer's markets in the area,"
Knapt said.

The board of managers expects to open the Bistro in

mid to late August.
According to Cavanaugh, the Bistro will be hiring
Swarthmore students. "We'll be interested in hiring students, particularly for waiter positions and possibly
some kitchen help," he said.
Student and community artwork may also grace the
walls of the new Bistro. "We certainly will have room for
artwork on the walls of the dining room part," Knapt
said, noting that they're "still too early in the project to
know exactly what goes on the wall."
The bistro will be owned by the investors, and managed by Cavanaugh, who will be overseeing it on a dayto-day basis.
The board of manager's decision to open an upscale
restaurant in the Ville comes independent offuture plans
for the Swarthmore Inn and possible commercialization
of the ville. Cavanaugh says that he doesn't expect the
Bistro to compete with the Inn's restaurant. Rather, it
will only add to the enjoyment of people who come to stay
in the Ville. He also expects the Bistro to draw people
from Media, Ridley and other nearby communities.
"We hope the new restaurant will draw people from
both inside and outside the Borough and give people a
reason to come into Swarthmore," Borough of
Swarthmore Town Center Coordinator Marty Spiegal
said. While Spiegal has been acting as a consultant to the
Board of Managers, the government of the Borough of
Swarthmore is not directly involved in the process of
opening up the Bistro.
"The Borough has nothing to do with [the Bistro] outside of the existing codes and zoning questions
The
Borough is supportive
but it doesn't have anything
specific to do with running the business," Spiegal said.
While not directly involved in recruiting new business ventures, the Borough is supportive of any commercial enterprise that will positively influence the Ville,
Spiegal said. "We hope that any new business that comes
in with something to offer will help revitalize the Ville,"
Spiegal said, "Revitalization is a multi-step process
which takes more than just one or two businesses or ven...

College to use sharpshooters to manage Crum deer
BY lAN YARETT

iyarettl@swarthmore.edu

The college announced yesterday that it
has accepted a plan to use sharpshooters to
control the overabundance of deer in the
Crum Woods through an organized deer
cull. The plan had been previously recommended by the Crum Woods Stewardship
Committee, whose mission is "to create a
protection, restoration, and stewardship
plan for Crum Woods," according to its
Web site. The first cull may occur as soon
as next winter break, and will take place

during the night.
After examination of recommendations
made by a consultant, Bryon Shissler, of
Natural Resource Consultants, Inc., the
Crum Stewardship Committee made a recommendation last year that deer overpopulation in the Crum be addressed by using
sharpshooters to cull the population. This
recommendation was then presented to
the Board of Managers, and ultimately,
the President's staff made the decision to
approve the plan and proceed.
Of the various options researched for
controlling the deer population, Associate

Professor

of Biology and Crum Woods

Stewardship Committee Co-Chair Jose
Luis Machado said that the committee felt
that the proposal to cull deer by sharpshooter had the "highest gain, was least
Problematic, and has been demonstrated

THE

PHOENIX

to be most effective."
"We felt this was likely to have the
desired effect over time and be relatively
humane,"
Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l said of the plan. "We made
sure that we had input from the voices in
the community that deserved that oppor-

tunity," Eldridge said, citing students,
faculty, staff, borough residents, and

other community members.

"We felt [culling deer] was
likely to have the desired
effect over time and be
relatively humane."
Maurice Eldridge '6l
Vice president
According to Eldridge, it is required
that the meat be harvested for charitable
purposes after the cull. "Once the municipalities
apply for a deer removal permit from the Pennsylvania Game
Commission, one of the things that come
with that permission is that the meat gets
into the food chain in a charitable way,"
...

Eldridge said.

According to Associate Vice President
for Facilities and Services Stu Hain, the
next step is for the college to ask the
Swarthmore borough
and Nether
Province to modify their ordinances,
which currently make it illegal for anyone other than a police officer to discharge a firearm.
"From everything we have heard, it's
expected to pass," Hain said of the amendment. "This will be another opportunity

for comments
[the amendment process]
will be very public, so we'll have to wait
and see."

Assuming the ordinances are successfully amended, the college will ask the
two municipalities to apply to the
Pennsylvania Game Commission for a
deerremoval permit. "We can't apply as a
private institution
this will be another
public process,"
Hain said. "The
Swarthmore Borough Council will vote to
votes will be public
make the decision
and recorded."
According to Eldridge, the municipalities will likely consider the proposal at
their May and June meetings.
Prior to approving the plan for management of the deer population, the college sought feedback from community
members on multiple occasions, through
several public forums. "We have had
opportunities for students, faculty, and
other community members to hear the

X 2008

plan and give feedback," Hain said.
According to Eldridge, feedback has

been minimal so far. "You can't second
guess it though
there may be people
who will raise their voices [when the
municipalities consider modifying their
ordinances]." Other communities that
have proceeded with plans to cull deer,
such as Wissahickon Valley and Fairmont
Park, faced more objections than
Swarthmore has up to this point.
"So far, we have received 99 percent
I have not received a single
support
communication from a community member negatively affected by this decision,"
Machado said.
"That's nice for us to see
it gives a

sense of us as a community working
toward this decision." "I feel very excited
this is an example of how consensus
works. We have been working on this for
[many] years, focusing on educating ourselves as well as faculty, staff and students with the best information."
Machado explained that the goal of
population control in the Crum Woods is
put in place a plan that will help preserve
the forest and its wildlife in the long term.
"This is a mechanism for us to help the
woods maintain themselves over time
for future
beyond our lifetimes even
generations of Swatties."

Chester Co-op to provide community-owned produce
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

"Members join to become partial owners, get voting
rights and become leaders in the co-op community whether it's to lead their work shift or run board meetings.
The store becomes a gathering place for the community,"

BY ARIEL MARTINO

amartinl@swarthmore.edu

A recent effort to get Swarthmore students involved
with the Chester Co-op culminated on Saturday with the
first shuttle run to the co-op. Professor of Religion Mark
Wallace spearheaded the initiative to engage students in
the developing business, working closely with members of
his Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar this spring
to generate interest in the community-based business
model.
The Chester Co-op was started two years ago by Tina
Johnson, a Chester resident, who saw the project as an
opportunity to revitalize the city of Chester by providing
resources such as fresh, nutritious foods that the community is sorely lacking. Wallace got the members of his
seminar involved when they were studying permaculture,
or sustainable, community-based agriculture.
"We decided the co-op was a strong permaculture case
study of a neighborhood store that offers fresh, affordable
produce to Chester residents and, possibly, Swatties as
well," Wallace said.
Students in Wallace's seminar began their service to
the Chester Co-op with projects aimed at optimizing the
business's Web site, identifying local food sources, writing grants and expanding the co-op's membership.
Midway through the semester, the class paid a visit to the
co-op to develop a better understanding of the business
and the context in which it operates.
Yusha Hu 'OB recalled weighing produce and conversing with co-op members. "Out of that visit came an idea
that, because we enjoyed the experience of shopping and
working at the co-op so much, other Swarthmore students
would want to be involved too," Hu said.
This past weekend, the Good Food Project sponsored a
shuttle run to the co-op so that students could learn more
about the opportunity for membership. Starting Fall 2008,
there will be weekly shuttle runs from Parrish Circle to
the co-op in downtown Chester, about a ten-minute drive
-

Hu said.
Andrew Quinton, another member of Wallace's seminar added, "The member labor requirement reduces overhead costs, keeping prices down. In the past, affordable
and high-quality food has not been available since there
are no supermarkets in the city," he said.
Quinton was also quick to point out the fact that the
co-op is beginning to serve as a center for social networking, citing the fact that most of the members know
each other. "The Chester Co-op ultimately wants to be a
lynchpin that people can rally around as the city looks to
revitalize itself," Quinton said.
"I see the co-op as a good community partner with
Swarthmore students. Tina and the other owner-members provide a positive and friendly environment in
which students can shop and provide volunteer labor,"
Wallace said.
The co-op owners hope to move to a more permanent
location and expand the hours of operation, an effort that
will require the recruitment of additional staff beyond
the 200 volunteers already involved. Hu said, "Student
membership directly helps them achieve that goal, and it
also provides another connection between the borough of
Swarthmore and the city of Chester."
According to Quinton, the co-op is already developing
deep roots in the community. "They're working with a
very experienced developer towards the goal of buying a
larger, permanent home and have made strong connections with churches and other community organizations," Quinton said.
While Swarthmore students may be content with the
Swarthmore Co-op and Genaurdi's, Hu cited several benefits available to patrons of the Chester Co-op.
Hu pointed out that the Chester Co-op "provides highquality food, most of which is local and organic, at a fraction of the cost of the Swarthmore Co-op or Genaurdi's."
"Beyond that, you're participating in something that is
more than just a good deal. The co-op is trying to build
social capital in a place that is severely under-served,
and it's great to be a part of that," she said.
Students may also see the work requirement as a
downside, but Quinton said, "the work requirement is a
commitment, but it's also easy work in a friendly environment. It's hard to beat getting quality food to people
who need it and live just minutes away from you as a
way to help out the world."
The city of Chester has been the focus of many
Swarthmore-based service projects, as it is an under-

away.
Student membership is $25 per semester and requires
that the student commit to work 2.75 hours every four
weeks. A membership is necessary to shop regularly at
the co-op and will be available during both fall and spring
semesters as well as in the summer. Faculty and staff are
also encouraged to become members.
The co-op model is designed to be democratic, to promote joint ownership and to offer fair prices for food in
Chester. Although nearly a third of the co-ops members
are on welfare, most have invested in a $250 lifetime
membership and have committed to the work requirement.

served and often ignored locus of poverty. Rather than
allowing people, business and capital to leave Chester,
the revitalization efforts focus on keeping resources in
Chester and rebuilding the community.
The co-op has already established its place in the
Chester community and has high hopes for shaping the
city in the coming years.
"Chester has a lot of problems, and nobody's expecting miracles, but getting high-quality and affordable food
to anybody in the city who wants it would be huge and is
well within reach," Quinton said.

In support of Rivero, students gather 100 signatures
From TENURE, p.

3

Although the handbook stresses the importance of balance between these three characteristics, it also states, "in
considering teaching and scholarship together, strong teaching is regarded as the first responsibility of the college."
According to Provost Constance Hungerford, the first
step of the tenure process is conducted by tenured members
of the respective department, in this case the Department of
Modern Languages and Literature, and involves assembling
lettersfrom previous or current students ofthe faculty member under evaluation, as well as faculty members of the college, both withinand outside the respective department, and
scholars outside of the college. The students solicited by the
department are a mixture of students chosen by the faculty
member in evaluation and the chair of the department. This
process starts in early October.

"It's not just about me; It's also my
students. It is because I care so
much about them, I'm very
committed to my students."
Horacio Chiong Rivero
Assistant Professor of Spanish
When evaluating the file, the department looks at the faculty member in evaluation based upon these three characteristics during the month of December. They make a recommendation based upon consensus thatthen gets forwarded to
the Committee on Promotion and Tenure. "There is not a specific formula, so I can't say, for example, that student letters
count twenty percent and that scholars' evaluations weight
twentypercent, because we really weigh the entire file. We do
pay very close attention to the statements from students,"
Hungerford said.
The specific members who comprise the committee are
different each year, but the President, the Provost, and four
tenured faculty members always sit on the committee each
year. There are efforts to ensure diversity of gender and discipline on the committee. Similarly, this committee looks at
the faculty member's strength in the context of the characteristics cited in the faculty handbook and makes a final decision, which is forwarded to the Board of Managers. At this
point, according to Hungerford, the decision has virtually
been made.
"The Board of Managers doesn'tread the file. They really
rely on the committee to make the decision," Hungerford
said. "They're largely going on the recommendation of the

president, because the committee is considered to be advisor
to the president. I take the decision to the academic affairs
committee of the Board and I review the cases quite thoroughly with them so that they are aware of any issue."
Rivero said that he chose to appeal the denialofhis tenure
because he believes that he strongly exemplifies all three of
the characteristics cited in the handbook.
"What strikes me as interesting is that my tenure profile
basically matches the description in the guidebook," he said.
"They found that all three [characteristics were] strong, but
my teaching was particularly untouched. The other two were
strong and solid ... That's a question that I have been asking
a 10t... It seems very incongruous, basically, the result from
my tenure file and the decision. In my eyes they don't match,
and I think in a lot of people's minds they don't match."
Stephanie Appiah 10, another student supporter, though
away for study abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina this
semester, showed her support for Rivero by creating a
Facebook group dedicated to the reconsideration of his
tenure decision. "He has too many qualities to count,"
Appiah said. "This is a kind, caring man who has published
several books, sets aside numerous office hours to help troubled students and provides every opportunity to learn better
Spanish."
Although Appiah does not feel that students should be
more formally involved in the tenure decision process due to
the nature of a student-teacher relationship, she supports the
idea of actively supporting specific professors under tenure
decision. "As far as I am concerned, and I do not speak for all
of the supporters or organizers, this is my specific support
for Professor Chiong Rivero," Appiah said.
"If other professors call upon me to show support, I will
do the same. But I do not support unilateral involvement of
students in the tenure process, any more so than they are
already involved."
As stated in their second letter, Garcia-Montufar, Floyd
and Galpern as well as more than 100 other former and current students realize the complexity of the issue and only
hope that their show of support for Rivero allows the college
to realize the importance of not only soliciting but counting
student input seriously in the tenure decision process.

"I know the interactions between co-workers and life
within the department is very important and that influence
how effectively the department will work in and of themselves and teach to the best of their ability, but at the same
time, if there's such an overwhelming student support for a
certain professor, I think that it would be in the best interest

to listen to the students, and listen to their thoughts in support of the professors," Floyd said.
"A few people have been asking us, 'well don't you think
every time a professor doesn't get tenure all their students
are making a fuss about it?'" Galpern said. "But what we
think is that clearly there's just huge student support for
him, a majority of students who have had him are outraged.

If the college is making decisions in the students' interests
really then why would they deny the professor tenure?"
"It's not just about me; it's also my students," Rivero said.
"It is because I care so much about them, I'm very committed to my students. I know how much it means to them for
my presence to be at the college. They have validated me in
that sense, and that is very comforting."
"The problem is we don't know what the [interdepartmental] interactions are," Garcia-Montufar said. "I mean, in
the end, my concern is to this particular decision that has
But as a whole I think this is an issue that
been made
should not only include students ofProfessor Chiong Rivero
...

but that should concern all the students of Swarthmore and
it's an issue of student input being taken seriously. You
know, we all get letters in our lifetime at Swarthmore and we
all hope that we are taken seriously. It's a matter that raises
questions that are important to all of us."
Currently, Rivero is still waiting for the appeals process
to be put into motion. The procedure requires that both the
department and the committee reread the file in order to
revisit any information that may have been overlooked in
the initial deliberation. The department will then convene
again to produce another recommendation that is subsequently conveyed to the tenure committee. The committee
reviews the file again before either confirming its original
decision or recommending a reversal.

[Spanish 4]
"I was pretty shocked
is my first class with him and it's at
8:30 in the morning and he brings
so much life into the class."
Erin Floyd 'lO
...

"If the decision is again negative, and the individual
wishes to continue, he or she can appeal and this time a new
committee is appointed, but their charge is different.
They're not asked to reread the file and say whether they
would have come to the same decision. They're asked to
determine whether there were any procedural irregularities," Hungerford said.
If the appeals process indicates the presence of any procedural irregularities in the initial proceedings, then the
committee defers to the President of the college, who decides
how to proceed with the decision, according to Hungerford.
"It's still in process. We're waiting for the department to
read and meet and then we'll have to get the tenure committee for the same purpose. We're hoping we can move as
promptly as possible. I hope it would be before exams end,"
she said.

Cull to mitigate ecological damage from excessive foraging
From DEER, p. 5
"This project is important
we want
to do it the right way and hire the right
people," Machado said. Three firms will
be hired as part of the population control
plan: one to conduct the sharpshooting,
one to ensure compliance of the sharpshooters with various rules and regulations governing the cull and a third to
monitor for changes in the woods, including changes in vegetation and tick population over time, before and after deer
population control begins.
Machado emphasized that this management project will help sustain the
Crum Woods while providing an opportunity to learn, in keeping with the college's mission to educate. "We're learning as we're doing this
it's a wonderful
opportunity for us to learn more about
the effects on wildlife in fragmented

forests."

According to Machado, fragmentation
and its effects on wildlife are not well studied. Thus, measurements and data can be
taken throughout the deer population control process to maximize the opportunity

for

learning

as a result of the project.

THE PHOENIX

The plan to control the deer population
in the Crum, according to Machado, is a
long term plan, and periodic deer culls
will continue for an unknown length of
time due to many complicating factors,
including that deer will continue to die
and reproduce naturally over the course
of the Crum management project.

"One hundred years from
now [the community] will
gain benefits from our
actions today."
Jose Luis Machado
Professor of Biology and
Crum Woods Stewardship
Committee Co-Chair
Similarly, Machado explained that it is
impossible to determine the exact number
of deer that

will be removed. Rather,

sharpshooters will set up bait stations in
May

certain areas throughout the Crum each
year, allow deer to become accustomed to
the presence of the bait, and then choose a
time at which to kill all of the deer present at a specific bait location at once.
Machado emphasized that sharpshoot-

ers will only choose to remove deer at a
specific time and location if the conditions are right, as it is essential that no
deer escape at these times. "These are
organisms for which survival is at the
center of their livelihood, he said. If they
survive at that moment [when deer
around them are being shot], they will
become skiddish."

"We want to make sure that there is
transparency in this process," Machado
said. "We want to ensure that if adjustments [to the plan] need to be made, they
will be made with information.
Population control is very case specific
what works in one case does not necessarily work in another, so we want to be
able to adjust."
According to Machado, the ultimate
goal is to reduce the deer population to a
self-sustainable level. When killing deer,
sharpshooters must ensure they are a successful predator, he said. Deer mimic

behavior and can learn from each other to
avoid sharpshooters, which would make
the job much harder.
According to Hain, the Swarthmore
and/or Nether Province police departments will provide assistance when the
sharpshooting actually occurs in order to
ensure that the procedure is carried out
safely, without endangering anyone. In
addition to carrying out the sharpshooting at night and during the winter at a
time when students are not on campus,
many other precautions will be taken in
keeping with rules and regulations developed by the college's consulting firm,

Natural Resource Consulting, Inc. For
example, shots will never be fired downhill, so that shots are likely to hit a hill if
they miss. Hain said that there are many
other rules, and emphasized that this has

been done successfully in other places.
"One hundred years from now [the

community] will gain benefits from our
actions today
a lot will change around
Swarthmore, but this piece of forest will
stay here. This is only the first step
later there will be talk of other projects
such as removing invasive species and

reforestation," Machado said.

The Fulbright Program is currently in the process of
releasing the list of its chosen grantees for the 2008-2009
period. Among this year's recipients of the prestigious
research fellowships are six graduating seniors and two
alumni of the college.
At the time of publication, several Swarthmore students who applied for grants had yet to receive notification from the Fulbright Program, which issues final decisions on candidates over a period of time beginning in
March and ending in early June.
The chosen grantees for the 2008-2009 Fulbright
Program include Elena Chopyak 'OB, Christian DeSimone
'O6, Jonathan Edwards 'O6, Scott Fortmann-Roe 'OB,
Susannah Gund 'OB, Yusha Hu 'OB, Natalie Bowlus 'OB,
Omar Ramadan 'OB, and Ronni Sadovsky 'OB.
According to Fellowships and Prizes Advisor Melissa

Mandos, the Fulbright Program offers students the opportunity to advance their studies of a particular interest in
a host country the year after they graduate from their
home institution.
The Fulbright Program requires that applicants be
nominated by their respective institutions through an
internal application process. At Swarthmore, the
Fellowships and Prizes Office works extensively with its
nominees before they submit their applicatioins to compete at teh national level. Students are constructively
advised on the application process, as well as given a rating that will be sent to the Fulbright office in New York.
Typically, most students will choose to partake in a
project of their own design, a teaching assistantship or in
a study abroad graduate program at a university. Students
who are working on an independent study will usually
work in affiliation with an academic institution, an NGO,

or other types of organizations.

"It's exciting because [the Fulbright Program] is taking
a topic that [the students] are really interested in that

they've either studied here at Swarthmore or that they
plan to pursue," Mandos said.
The program serves not only to provide students with
the opportunity to engage in a particular academic or
social interest, but also acts as an exchange program for
students to act as ambassadors of their respective coun-

tries.

In other words, although students do not serve as offi-

experiences that their opportunities provide will allow
students to build good relations with their host country,
as well as returning to their home countries with a newfound understanding that they can share with others as
they further the research in their interest.
"It's viewed as a very positive experience in terms of
that cultural exchange aspect," Mandos said.
This year there were 43 applicants for the Fulbright
Program from the college. The national screening committees recommended 23 of the applicants for further consideration to the respective host countries. The number of
applications was at an all-time high, according to Mandos,
as the yearly average is around two dozen applications.
Chopyak, a major in Sociology and Anthropology, will
conduct her research on family planning promotions in
Tunisia and observing how certain Islamic interpretations either support or oppose these promotions. More
specifically, she plans on evaluating the various social
marketing strategies used to promote contraceptive and
disease preventing devices by visiting several family planning clinics, as well as community interventions and
women's empowerment groups.
Fortmann-Roe, a double major in Engineering and
Economics, will be returning to Poland where he studied
abroad sophomore year in order to work on treating
excess fluoride in groundwater, a surfeit of which can
begin to cause problems such as bone structure deformations. He also plans to study photography during his stay.
Gund, a special major in Languages and Linguistics
and an Educational Studies minor, will be continuing the
work she began during the summer of 2007 as part of her
thesis on language attitudes.

At the time, she interviewed several women about language usage in Morocco. On the Fulbright, she plans to
research language usage more in-depth within secondary

schools.

According to Gund, the official language of Morocco is
Arabic, but there are different forms that are used one
form for written use, and a Moroccan spoken dialect, of
which there are different variations within the country.
"I want to see how the written version and the spoken
version interact in the classroom," she said. "I'm really
excited to go back and to use the language skills that I've
learned but also to build on the experience that I had in
trying to learn the culture and trying to learn different
Moroccan customs and traditions."

Incoming president Heo discusses accountability, input
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Phoenix editor Jack Keefe recently sat
down with recently elected Student Council

president Yongjun Heo 'O9 to expand upon his
previously stated policies and to discuss his

ideas and directionfor Student Council.

JackKeefe: What sort ofideas are you
interested in?
Yongjun Heo: One small example of an
idea that could possibly work if the Asian
Organization were to start a weekend program for Asian adoptees
if SAO were to
come up to me and say these are some ideas
that I have, what can I do with them?
I
would go through and speak with other student groups that have done this
such as
Dare to Soar and Enlace
I would connect
the groups
to be able to connect them
immediately to say "you should speak to this
person." In terms of the work that could be
done with one group that has a lot of experience with another group that has no idea as
to how something could be run
even down
to the logistics, it could be a very positive
thing overall for a lot of student groups.
Obviously, it'll be sort of a strain on the
group that's helping, but overall I believe
it'll be a source of community for this col...

Another way in which the whole idea of

they could have in terms of how Student
Council functions and having this sort of big
group meeting. One of those goals is that

opportunity for current students to make

JK: So one of the primary purposes of
this, then, would be to consult as to the
Swat 2020 process?
YH: That's one part of it, absolutely.

have greater impacts I think in the long run.
JK: One of the things I'm sort of hearis that you're interested in having

limited amount of time we should focus on
Well, you've heard of the Spring
Break/Thanksgiving idea? There was this
great idea that was tossed around, students
really loved the idea, pushed it to begin with.
What came before it were these administrative obstacles and things that students didn't
necessarily think about or talk about, but it
came to the point where Student Council
members realized that this wasn't possible...
But as a student here I didn't realize why
it wasn't working, what was going on with
that, what I could do as a student... to help
with that process. We come back to this idea
of the bimonthly [group] meeting, for students to say, "Maybe you should go to this
direction, maybe you should do this"
maybe if we can come to this realization that
this isn't going to work, maybe we'll scrap
that idea and move to the next best idea. I

don't want to say it's a waste of time, but in
the end it is ... that you work, and give a lot
of effort
if that doesn't come through, it's
pretty inefficient in a way To get student
input is the most important thing.
There's another idea that I had: If students have a list of requests
have it on
paper... That way, if Student Council ignores
some of these requests which we wouldn't
because at that point we're held accountable
for these requests, people should be angry
toward Student Council.
It shouldn't be that people think, "Oh,
this is Student Council, they don't do much
anyway, this is fine."
It should be that...
"It's their job, we elected them to this position." The process with that is that if you had
a request and I thought it wasn't feasible, we
would talk it out and we would come to an
understanding and we would know which
ideas go through and which ones wouldn't.
JK: And to go back, this would be a
function of those bi-monthly meetings
you were discussing?
YH: Exactly. Another part of the
bimonthly meetings is
that there are certain issues that come up during the year that
we can't predict... One example wouldbe the
SQU chalkings during Coming Out Week
It was like last year or the year before that
there was a huge outrage by students who
were opposed to those chalkings, right, and
there really wasn't this mechanism in place
for students to talk What happened was
that there was this quick administrative
push to come to this forum, for students who
really cared about the issue to go talk about
it and think things through. What was
happening was that there were counterchalkings and people were erasing chalkings there was a lot of tension there if
there were a mechanism where student
group leaders were already meeting, this
issue could've been discussed among the

PHOENIX

...

...

group.
JK: How do you see your role in
terms of interfacing between student

workshops where students didn't have the
time to get out all they wanted. Something
that is really critical is learning about this,

as cliche as that sounds.
First of all, let's assume that's there no
racism and there's no homophobia at
Swarthmore Even if that is the case, for
eighteen years before we reached this point,
we have been living in a world where this
surrounds us
the moment we leave this
institution is where we confront those sameisms again... Having a better understanding
of that... through Swarthmore is something
that I think people will be able to take for
their entire lifetimes I think Swarthmore
as a leading academic institution is in a
place to make [changes necessary to stop
prejudice]
to influence the direction of
how those issues go.
JK: In terms of what StuCo has done
for the past two semesters, I was curious
to know what you think StuCo has succeeded the most on
a trend or an initiative and what you think StuCo may
have to improve on in that sense.
YH: Obviously, the clear things are they
made meals last thirty minutes longer in
Tarble. Students do feel a direct effectof that
expansion of the library is something that
affects a lot of students
Those are good
steps in that through the surveys and
through speaking to other students, Student
Council figured out what student demands,
needs and requests were and they accomplished those

demands of the students and making it so

...

life here is better in some little way. Another
success that could be expanded upon due
to last year's Student Council elections
...

where there was this lack of understanding
about IC/BCC issues, a lack of care... what
Student Council did was bring in a lot of IC
leaders in to speak about IC issues. I saw a
lot oftimes what the trend was
and I think
that you need to start the dialogue somewhere
but I think that Student Council
needs to go past this point
and go be a
proactive member of this institution to help
students with what they're doing. If we can
move past the point where they're like,
"Great, we've opened dialogue, this is good"
you need to do something with that dialogue! This accountability factor that will
play in next year, hopefully, will push past
that dialogue. I really think that this year
has been more successful than in years past
in terms of meeting student requests and in
opening up this dialogue.
But there are some issues with moving
past dialogue. One student told me, to have
seven meetings about the same issue seems
just so inefficientand a huge waste of time. I
understand that Student Council wants to
understand things fully, but sometimes
things don't seem to click to XYZ members
I can't give you a specific incidence because
of confidentiality but this is the sort of
thing that happens when someone says,
"We've opened dialogue. Dialogue IS a success."
JK: Versus seeking an end?

concerns and bringing those concerns
to the Board of Managers?
YH: Again, there are two different distinctions I do make. There are experiences
I have had personally here and the other
distinction is that I represent the entire
student body. If there are seemingly small
issues that a student brings up to me, those
are issues I will press for regardless
From the Board of Manager's perspective,
they may have those ideas already in line.
For me, my job is to input as many different viewpoints from as many different
angles so that any decision that they make

I have to look out

for the seemingly small issue ideas that
will come up.
My goal is, given the experiences that
I've had, I'll give my personal input, and
then I'll make sure that student opinions
that their ideas are being heard. It's a
must. There's no other way around it.
JK: At the first Q&A that was held
here, you expressed a positive remark
about the workshops that Student
Council went through (Training for

Change), but in my impression you
seemed to believe that there was more

that could be done in that respect

upon those ideas?

twice a year are a great step in the right
direction. They're what needs to be done in
order for people to make well-informed
decisions. One thing that I'd like to have

The Big Chair retires from Parrish Beach
Jake Beckman 'O4, architect of the Big Chair, discusses its history and the possibility of designing a durable replacement
As JakeBeckman 'O4 wheeled out his most
recent art piece under the cover of darkness in
the spring of 2003, he had no idea that the
piece would become an integral part of
Swarthmore's landscape. Although Beckman
has showcased many pieces on campus, the
one commonly known as the Big Chair has

elicited the biggest response. "It's really sweet talked with Beckman to find out more about
that it holds such a place in people's hearts this beloved piece of Swarthmore and any

Hannah Purkey: What inspired you
to make the Big Chair?

Jake Beckman: At the time I was
interested in works of "happenings," especially Allan Kaprow's work as well as
Claus Oldenberg's oversized sculptures. I
was inspired by conversations I had with
different people, and by friends throwing
out ideas and brainstorming. Part of it
was also this sort of mysterious place that
inspiration comes from. But a lot of the
experience was making it, on doing it in
secret and pushing it out there in the middle of the night.
HP: Why was it made in secret?
JB: It was about the performance of
putting it out. A couple of other people at
school at the time and I wanted to have it
be a surprise and be a delight, something
that suddenly appears. I wanted it to be a
secret so it would really be about the
piece and people's interactions with it,
not about a big build up to it's unveiling.
HP: Even though it was a secret,

was it well received?
JB: Well it was actually meant to be
temporary like a lot of other pieces I did.
It was supposed to be up for a few weeks
and then come down, but it lasted five
years longer than intended. It took on a
life of its own in a lot of ways, and it
became something more than anyone
could have imagined. People certainly
seem to like it.

I don't have anything in the works

Cleveland next February and was just in a

Yo La Tengo bassist speaks on music, old and new
m

As part of ThePhoenix preeview to Worthstock 2008, The
Phoenix had an exclusivve interview with Yo La Tengos
bassist JamesMcNew [pictured center].
Anna Zalokostas: You've been playing music for a
long tune, both with Yo La Tengo and separately, so I
wanted to ask about what changes you've noticed in
the music industry, especially recently with albums
being made available digitally.
James McNew: Well, quite obviously, the Internet was
not what it was today when we were kids. You would listen to the radio and probably for all three of us [in YLT] at
the time, we were getting interested in music that wasn't
being played on radio stations, or at least on radio stations
on the right side of the dial. There would be records that
you wouldread about in a magazine and say, "Wow, that
sounds pretty cool," but then you had to go find them
somewhere. It's not like you could just go back to your laptop and hear them within five seconds of hearing the
band's name for the first time.
There's definitely good and bad things about that
I
mean, I would have liked it. It would have saved me a lot
of trouble. At the same time, I think not having that immediate access forced me to use my imagination a lot more
and I think it's just sort of driven me into this world really deep, really quick. I didn't get tiredof it ever. It just sort
of seems endless and exciting.
AZ: What sort of things did you listen to when you
were younger?
JM: There were always records being played in the
house, and it's not like my parents were making me listen
to the The Velvet Underground when I was 2 years old. It
kind of worked out really great because my mom was the
Beatles and Bob Dylan and kind of the nice side, and my
dad was the
and James Brown and kind of
the naughty side. So I had both anjf think that was a very

JM: I'm always more interested in listening to music
from other times. I like all sorts of stuff from the 60s and
70s, and the 80s and 90s yielded some really great music as
well. Wow, there's your pull quote. I've really gone out on
a limb there with my musical taste.
Lately, I've been listening to records I've had in my collection for more than half my life and, I think, have kind
of gone back to to see how I feel about them now. The
record "Damaged" by Black Flag has held up more amazingly than any other record in my record collection, I
bought it in high school and still have that exact same
copy and it still sounds amazing.
I guess they're not exactly new but I'm pretty fond of
the band Why? from Oakland, California, They have a
brand new record out called "Alopecia" that is really
tremendous. And Au Revoir Simone, a New York band.
AZ: Both good choices. Is there a musical act who
you really wish you could have been able to see live,
but missed out on?
JM: Oh yeah, thousands of them. Mathematically, the
percentage is kind of decreasing these days because everybody's getting back together. It's like, "Oh! Now I can see
them." That has its ups and downs. I've seen some bands
reunite and play and it's been just unbelievably good and
sometimes it hasn't. The band Mission to Burma, a band
from Boston who broke up in the early 80s, were just gods
in my mind. I listened to those record everyday. They got
back together four or five years ago because they had a
bunch of new ideas. So they put out two full albums
brand new material and they just played a show in New 1
York. They're a working band. They weren't done. They're
just as good and now they have this kind of 20 years of age
and experience added to the power they already have that
is really kind of overwhehning. I'm really moved by that i
AZ: Talking about new ideas, 1 wanted to ask about I1

JM: We kind of just let it happen and see where we are.
It comes in cycles. We'll write a bunch of songs, record
them and go on tour and stay busy with thatfor a couple
of years and we all kind of know when it’s time to do it
again and we start over again from zero. It’s been a pretty
gratifying way to learn. 1t... reflects on where you are in

April 26, talented Swatties gave a tantalizing performance on stage in the Pearson Hall Theatre in LPAC. The
Department of Music and Dance presented a well-choreographed show with lots of cultural variety.
The show began with the "Partita Project" choreographed by faculty choreographer Lisa Kraus. Michelle
Nguyen 'IL Carmella Ollero 'O9, Kate Speer 'OB and
Hilary Tanabe 'OB danced to excerpts of J.S. Bach's
"Gigue" and "Chaconne" from Violin Partita No. 2. The
dancers recreated a baroque ballroom by setting up a
large screen behind them that showed their movements
from a bird's eye view. The effect allowed the audience to
see the spins and graceful movements from two different
angles. They traded off holding hands, carefully sliding
on the stage floor and helping each other up to an upright
position. They went on to form shapes as a group that
could only be seen from the angle of the screen above.
The next act, "In Absence of 'Sum'" was very different
from the first. It featured traditionalkathak dancing and
a rap written and performed by James Mendez Hodes 'OB
to the beat of Hindustani Classical Music. Mendez stood
looking pensive and cool with his arms crossed, dressed
in a cap and a long shirt. Four female dancers stood
behind him dressed in elaborate skirts in different
shades of purple and green. After Hodes' rap, all of the
dancers stomped their feet to the fast tabla beat played
by Lenny Seidman.
The women wore long braids and had clanging bangles around their ankles. Adding to the piece were
Professor Pallabi Chakravorty's chants of the phrase
"Let it be anguish come still to torment my heart /Come

even to leave me again" and the pleasing vocals of Priya
Johnson 'll
In the flamenco piece

that followed, entitled "El
Grito," the dance began with only the dancers' black silhouettes visible on stage. The silhouette of Javier
Camacho's 'O9 moved first, as he stretched his arms,
dressed in a classy black suit. Slowly the lights came up,
drenching the stage in red light and revealing four
women with white flowers in their hair, long flowing red
skirts and red tops. The dancers pulled off intricate footwork, twirled their skirts and managed to look serious
but beautiful.
The following piece incorporated both traditional tap
and rhythms created with drum sticks and chairs. The
set-up involved plenty of drama on a morning train,
including two women fighting over the same seat and
several more fawning over Kyle White 'OB. The performers wore striped ties, suspenders, white shirts and black
pants. White ended the piece by doing twelve consecutive
jump splits to the steady beat of the clashing sticks.

"My favorite moment was seeing my

with as much youthful vigor and intensity as all the students around her. She totally rocked the house."
The next act featured Ollero's own modern dance choreography. The piece used a screen onstage to create intrguing visuals. When two of the dancers were illuminated
by the spotlight center stage, the three other dancers
danced visible behind the screen.
The last piece "Where I Begin..." was choreographed
by C. Kemal Nance '92 with recorded music by bands
Earth, Wind and Fire and Danity Kane. The piece began
with three dancers emerging on stage in long white Tshirts. The dancers' robotic and disjointed movements
were accompanied by guest singers and a narrator. The
piece's theme of finding self-esteem and confidence was
apparent when the narrator stated, "I am worth every bit
of energy I give to everyone else",.
Then three guest artists in head wraps and flowing
whiterobes proceeded to sing, "You're the children of the
sunlight and you deserve the spotlight" continuously.
After this, Twan Claiborne 'OB danced enthusiastically in
long white pants and a tan shirt. There was a solo dance
segment by Kaitlin Smith 'lO, after which she was joined
by the rest of the female dancers dressed in vibrant
turquoise and white.
Smith said, "My favorite moment was at the start of
the second half in which I skip out to meet Twan and
dance with him for a moment in jubilation and solidariThis last African peice had a beautiful message and
lovely dancing. Omar Ramadan 'OB, a performer in the
last piece, said, "It felt great to dance in such an inspiring piece. I'm glad I was part of something that touched
people."

After a brief intermission, the Swarthmore Taiko
Ensemble announced their presence with a loud yell set
to the vibrating strokes of their drums.

May Maani 10 said, "Overall, the concert was great
and you could tell that the dancers really worked hard in
preparing for it. I especially loved the last piece, it was so
beautiful and inspiring."

Abigail Graber 'Escape's from Swarthmore
BY ABIGAIL GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu

I remember going to see "Harold and Kumar Go to White
Castle." It was right after I finished high school. I alternated
between feeling vaguely queasy and laughing so hard I
would have shot Jujubees out my nose, if only I'd had the
money to buy them.
Now I'm about to graduate from college, and many things
have changed. I still can't afford Jujubees, but I have read
Laura Mulvey's seminal work on the male gaze in narrative
cinema. (Whether you think this is an improvement depends
on your tolerance for film theory or, alternatively, on the
strength of your feeling for Jujubees.) I have also participated in academic discussions of homosocial male-bonding
through homophobic misogyny and, perhaps most saliently,
I have descended into the throes of an honors-exams-meetsgraduation-apocalypse meltdown, all the while cultivating
the kind of finely-tuned sense of bathroom humor that only
mixed housing can bestow.

What all this means is, I suppose it's fitting that, in my
52nd and final article for The Phoenix (that's right, Dalva,
52), I am forced to declare that Swarthmore has ruined a
movie for me.
Come on, New Line! I am the target demographic for
"Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay" I am
young. I am immature. I have a crush on Kal Penn. I am in
such a state of pre-exam, pre-graduation panic that I might
not have noticed if you just reran "Harold and Kumar Go to
White Castle." In fact, you could have run a different, entirely unrelated movie, called it "Harold and Kumar" and I still
would have liked it. You could have just repeated that part
with Neil Patrick Harris and the unicorn for 90 minutes and
that would have been cool. But you had to go and ruin it all
with your stupid, effing Male Gaze.
At its core, "Harold and Kumar" the sequel is a buddy
movie. I'm sure that the original was at least somewhat
homophobic, but in my teenaged innocence, I was too busy
laughing with Jujubee-propelling power to notice. "Harold
and Kumar Go to White Castle" also had a great gimmick:
this is what the token minority characters from other teen
movies are doing in their off time
adventures that are
smarter, funnier and hipper than Freddie Prinz Jr.'s bland
hijinks. Wouldn't you rather be their friends?
Alas, no. In "Harold and Kumar Escape From
Guantanamo Bay," homophobia is the gimmick. The movie
is designed to reassure its intended male audience that neither Harold (John Cho) nor Kumar (Kal Penn) are gay and
hey, you there, yes you, straight boy in the theatre, you're
not gay either!
How else to explain intense homosocial moments (Kumar
interrupts Harold in the bathroom multiple times) followed
by gratuitous female exposure? Harold and Kumar go to a
"bottom-less" party populated by their one male friendand a
crowd of women wearing skimpy tops, high heels and no bottoms. When their male friend exposes himself, his genitalia
are disgusting; Harold and Kumar drop their pants but are
shot only from the back, presumably lest some poor straight
boy in the theater have an untoward reaction. Because I
have scrupulously avoided the Women's Studies department, I have no problem with sexual objectification. But I
have a problem when a film depicts women as sex objects

and, despite an express invitation to do so, declines to go
there with men.
As its militant heterosexuality shows, this film is

extremely anxious. Trying so hard to surpass its prequel
(amusing aside: the Canadian-French title of the original is
"Harold et Kumar chassent le burger," once again confirming the theory that everything is more sublime in French), it
falls so short. When I was 17, Harold and Kumar were somehow totally relatable. They only wanted this one, tiny thing
and as one who has also chassented le burger, I could sympathize. But now they're on the run from Guantanamo, and
the cleverness of the first film has vanished along with its
trivial object. Writers/directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden
Schlossberg have lost their knack for penetrating, Gen-Y
humor and the perfect turn of phrase even their fart jokes
seemed off. I wanted to identify with Harold and Kumar. I
want their post-collegiate malaise to be my post-collegiate
malaise. But it seems our paths have diverged.

You could have repeated that part with
Neil Patrick Harris and the unicorn for
90 minutes and that would have been
cool. But you had to go and ruin it all
with your stupid, effing Male Gaze.
And yet I still sat through "Harold and Kumar" with a big
smile on my face. Neil Patrick Harris enters, rides a unicorn,
dies. The technical term for that is "quality." For the rest, I
can only conclude that deep in my heart, I have an abiding
affection for these lads that will take at least one more bad
sequel to displace. But my faith has been shaken.
In the end, I think I should thank Swarthmore, if for nothing else than for teaching me that I am not a 14-year-oldboy.
Though the extreme unicorn dearth on campus has been
regrettable, this has otherwise been a mind-expanding experience. But now I think the time has come for me to make my
escape.

Cheap Time and Jay Reatard revive punk at Olde Club
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

When high-end fashion designer John
Varvatos moved into the space once occupied by New York's legendary CBGBs, it
seemed as if punk rock had finally met its
end. Last Friday's Olde Club lineup,
which featured Cheap Time and Jay
Reatard; rebuffed mourners and cynics
alike, proving that punk is still alive and

kicking.
Cheap Time opened the night like a
train speeding down the tracks towards a
fiery wreck. Hailing from Nashville, the
trio looked like a slickly disaffected indie
outfit but played with the fury of
teenagers cooped up in their parents'
garage. With a powerful drumbeat rolling
in the background, Cheap Time ripped
through a handful of songs that couldn't
have been more than two minutes each.

Club stage. Pausing only to count out ""12-3" between each song, the band ended its
set soaked in sweat. The modestly sized
audience responded in kind to Cheap
Time's enthusiasm and bobbed approvingly with the beat.
Jay Reatard and his Reatards began
where Cheap Time left off and performed
a breakneck and electrifying show to a
now seething crowd. As with Cheap Time,
appearances were deceiving. While the
Reatards trio may have looked and headbanged like characters pulled from
Wayne's World, they played with
unmatchable drive and ferocity. With no
time to waste, Reatard powered through
songs from a variety of his most recent
releases, shouting out the title of each

track. Blending Ramones-style blitzkrieg
punk with scaled back rock riffs, the
Reatards evoked the spirit of the late
1970s when black leather jackets were
cool and music was raw "do-it-yourself
It was refreshing to have two bands that
played fast-paced garage punk instead of
lethargic indie pop," Robin Lipp 'lO said.
Despite the band's punk roots, its
sound was incredibly tight due to
Reatard's extensive musical experience.
Having dropped out of high school to play
guitar and record demos, the Tennessee
native was signed to a label at age 17. Now
27, he has released 18 full length albums
and has gained a reputation for wild live
performances. In a recent interview with
SPIN magazine, Reatard admitted that he
is trying to bring a more studied component to his recordings. "I used to be in
bands where the focus was on making the
loudest, most annoying sounds we could.

Now I'd rather figure out how to make
four chords work the right way," Reatard
told journalist David Marchese.
All of Reatard's practice paid off as the
audience thrashed the night away.
However, what did bother Olde Club goers
was the fact that his time on stage seemed
truncated.
"I'm glad I came and I had a lot of fun
...I just wish that [Reatard] had played a
longer set,"" Sarah Ifft 'O9 said.
For all of his fabled antics (beer bottle
throwing, spitting and fistfights, to name
a few), Reatard actually seemed remark-

ably tame. His most feral moment came at
the end of the night when, crouched over
an amp, he alternately screamed and violently abused the strings of his guitar.

The subhuman wail that filled Olde Club
resonated with the core element of punk
that is not afraid of being disgusting,
dirty and dangerous. For the most part,
the biggest threat came not from
Reatard's music but from overzealous
moshers.
So, next time you play at Swarthmore,
Jay Reatard, challenge us a little, make us
scared. A longer set might also be nice.

...

et was refreshing to have
two bands that played fastpaced garage punk instead
of lethargic indie pop."
Robin Lipp 'lO
Three-chord progressions, thudding
bass and unintelligible vocals were the
hallmark of the songs that the band
played off of their recently released LP. In
addition to simple melodies, Cheap Time
also brought incredible energy to the Olde

Though
drummer/singer Dean Spunt are the band's only two
members, the duo has always managed to produce much
more blaring, clamorous racket than you'd ever expect
from two people with a few instruments, and that hasn't
changed. Despite the band's move to major Seattle-based
label Sub Pop, "Nouns" is stylistically similar to what
noisy, ambient
No Age has recorded in the past
garage rock, droning fuzz, thundering drums, thrashing
guitar and raw, guttural vocals. The songs, though
short, are epic in their build-ups and masterfully integrate the raucous art of tension and release into the
structure and melodies of pop. While "Weirdo Rippers"
was by its very nature a loose association of songs,
"Nouns" is a much more cohesive, substantial album.
The racket is the same, but this time the songs sound
less spontaneous and more tightly stitched together; No
Age restlessly burns through track after track, racing
time as they try to outrun the inevitable end of the
album, making a sound that is monumentally big and
overwhelmingly loud.
With titles like "Things I Did When I Was Dead,"
"Ripped Knees" and "Brain Burner," the songs on
"Nouns" are aggressively insistent on a raw, intense
kind of physicality. No Age isn't just playing music for
you to hear; they're playing music for you to feel someone else's elbow piercing into your ribs as your
eardrums vibrate more rapidly than the speaker you're,
standing directly in front of and strangers' sweat is
being flicked onto your face. "Teen Creeps," with its jangling guitars, electric, beeping noise, heavy, thrashing
drums and hoarse, raspy sound marks a high point on
the album and comes right after "Eraser," the song chosen to be the first single off of "Nouns," a droning,
catchy tangle of plucking and banging that speaks of
what's seen, unseen, and selectively ignored. One of the
best songs offof the album, "Here Should Be My Home,"
comes toward the end and is a catchy pop anthem that
starts off simple with thumping drums and chugging
guitars before exploding into a turbulent, entropic
tumult of sound, noise and rhythmic clamors.
"Nouns" isn't just an album, it's an environment,
one that's visually represented in the large booklet of
vibrantly buzzing images and brightly colored art that
accompanies the CD. Sheets of bold, solid colors pop up
intermittently amongst the series of tattered photographs that feature tightly packed music venues and
messy practice spaces, dilapidated buildings in
Downtown L.A., overcrowded stacks of worn-out cassette tapes, rolls of bright stickers and snapshots of college students from places like Bard, Oberlin and
Brooklyn. The Smell, the Downtown Los Angeles music
space where No Age played their first actual show, is the
first of this series of images, and it is this exact lifeaffirming spirit of the Los Angeles D.I.Y. art scene that
is embodied in the band's sound and style. It is loud,
bold, confident, messy, spastic and rough
it kicks,
shouts, jumps, dances and punches, it bangs on instruments and makes garage-style racket sound like fun, upbeat, neon-colored pop songs, music that can be appre-

ciated by all.

Religion on campus a priority for administration
It is no question that religion
holds
great
power in this
world. From the

to

significant sway
over most of the

people. In fact,

so
that,
on his visit to
New York City, the Primate of Italy (one of the Pope's funniest names) proclaimed before the United Nations
General Assembly: "Indeed, the Holy See has always had
a place at the assemblies of the Nations, thereby manifesting its specific character as a subject in the international domain. As the United Nations recently confirmed,
the Holy See thereby makes its contribution according to
the dispositions of international law, helps to define that
law, and makes appeal to it." (Unfortunately, this was not
the first time an ex-Nazi stood on that podium.)
While the Catholic Church regrettably stands strong
in international politics, the Catholic community at
Swarthmore, like all religious groups here, holds little

religion

important

sway in campus politics. For the past year I have, in this
space, explored the role and nature of religion at
Swarthmore, and though I have certainly toyed with the
idea from time to time, I have never asked the question:
Are religious groups on campus somehow more important than other groups? Certainly the Catholic Church

holds more clout than the International Brotherhood of
but does that translate at all to
Swarthmore?
While religious groups on campus don't have nearly
the power that their larger groups do internationally,
there is something special about religious groups here.
The College has placed religion on a small, yet noticeable
pedestal. For instance, religious life has its own website
separate from the Student Activities website, which
houses all the groups, including a repeat of the religious
groups. There is also the Interfaith Center, which, according to the site, "exists to promote dialogue and understanding among faith traditions, and between people of
faith and those who do not belong to a faith tradition."
The College obviously deems religion important as it
pays two student Interfaith Interns to run the Interfaith
Center. These two are in charge of programming for the
center, and work to "foster communication between different faith groups on campus." Finally, there are the
three religious advisors (there would be four but the
Muslim Students Association declined the College's offer
to have an Imam join up), Protestant, Catholic and
Jewish, though they "are available as counselors,
resources and friends regardless of students' religious
affiliations."
I think there are two reasons for the added support
Swarthmore gives to religion on campus. First,
Swarthmore seems to give special attention to cultural
Boilermakers,

life on campus, which includes religious life. It greatly
supports the large institutional bases such as the
Intercultural Center, the Black Cultural Center and the
Office of Multicultural Affairs (under which religion
falls). While religious life has its three advisors, cultural
life in general benefits from having two deans: Associate
Dean for Multicultural Affairs Darryl Smaw and
Assistant Dean and Director of the Intercultural Center
Rafael Zapata. While the College supports all student
groups, there isn't such specific, institutionalized support for groups without cultural delineations, such as
Knit-Wits or Folk Dance Club. Religion's pedestal, therefore, comes from the fact that it falls under the cultural
category of student groups.
Second, the College administration pays special attention to religion because it believes that religion can play
an important role for students at this time in their lives.
During college, many students forge a distinct sense of
self, one that exists outside of the family life they have
At the beginning of last semester,
grown up with.
Assistant Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal explained
to me the importance that religion and spirituality can
play in the lives of college students. "I think spiritual
growth or development is important for many individuals, and I think at a time when people are figuring out
their identity, and what their values are, and who they
want to be in their lives, that that's an element that
should be part of the conversation and available to those
that want to explore it." Therefore, in the interest of fostering personal growth Swarthmore makes sure to maintain a vibrant religious community. It's not for everyone,
but for those who want it, it's there.

Sixteen Feet seniors say good-bye with final 'Toe Jam' concert
BY ANAGHA KRISHNAN

akrishnl@swarthmore.edu

Yoshi Johnson 'OB generated much
laughter when he introduced Sixteen Feet
at their Friday night 'Toe Jam," a concert
that spotlighted both new songs and old
favorites by Swarthmore's only all-male a
capella group. "We have a great concert
for you guys tonight," he said. "A great
and quick concert because there are a lot
of other fun events going on tonight that
you should be at," Johnson said.
According to group member Henry
Clapp 'O9, the decision to host the concert

itself was "stressful, because it was kind
of at the last minute. We learned a lot of
new arrangements very quickly, but luckily it all came together on timer." The
group began the evening with some interpretive dancing, and the song "Day Man"
from the show "It's Always Sunny in
Philadelphia." This performance also fea-

tured a cameo from our new mascot, the
phoenix, who frolicked onstage to a lot of
cheers and merriment.

THE PHOENIX

Johnson then had his first solo of the
night with "Ordinary People" by John
Legend. The song that followed was an
original piece, first performed in 1993 and
dedicated to everyone in the audience

who "self-identifies as a Swarthmore
girl."
predictably
enough,
Titled,
"Swarthmore Girls" the song featured
lyrical gems such as "I think you are one
hot babe / Let's go study in McCabe" and
was a big hit with the audience.
Other high points of the night included
Feet's re-enactment of the famous Harry
Potter Puppet Pals video on You Tube.
This is a personal favorite, and if for some
reason, you've missed out, go to YouTube
and watch the hilarity for yourself. The
Harry Potter skit was impeccably timed
and a great addition to Sixteen Feet's
musical repertoire.
After this came the announcement that
Sixteen Feet was hosting a guest group
from a "distant and foreign land." The
group members, they said, had traveled
all the way from the British Isles to perform at Swarthmore. 4.88 Meters, the

guest group, coincidentally featured all of
the Sixteen Feet men with the addition of
returning junior Colin Aarons 'O9 who
had been abroad this past semester.
Aarons performed the song "On and
On" by Stephen Bishop. 4.88 Meters cer-

tainly met with an enthusiastic reception,

as the screams from both male and female
members of the audience nearly drowned
out the applause. Hopefully, this will
encourage them to visit again.
The Feet also included a song written

by
Swarthmore Alum Andrew Rose Gregory,
titled "Do You Think." Senior Wren Elhai
then had a solo on the group's rendition of
the Franz Ferdinand hit "Take Me Out,"
which featured a rich and complicated
vocal arrangement with equally elaborate
group choreography. In keeping with the
surprising tone of the evening, the last act

was a Destiny's Child medley with the
songs "Bootylicious," "Survivor" and
"Say My Name." The men ended the concert proclaiming
that they were
"Independent, Bootylicious Survivors".

It was the last "Toe Jam" for seniors
Yoshi Johnson, Wren Elhai and James

Other members of the group have stated that since the real senior solos are
going to be performed at Jamboree, they
will be saving their emotions for that

seniors are a great class and it will be difficult to replace them. Daniel Del Nido 'lO

untrue! When my parents first came to the States in the
19705, most of the things they could afford were second-hand.
They were strangers in this country, using other strangers'
dishes to eat off ofand lamps to read from. Now that they can
afford things to imbue with their own experiences,
untouched by any previous owner's past, why would they
want to go back to buying used things?
I never had to endure the hardships my parents faced in

Perhaps they just did a good job of hiding themfrom me. But
my dad's stance does resonate with me in the sense that my
most favorite used clothes are the ones that I have the most
personal connection with, especially the ones I got from my
mom. There's the maroon, plaid button-down that I found
stowed away in her closet, which I remember her wearing in
stores

In the spring of my sophomore year, Les Savy Fav performed an epic show at Olde Club, no doubt thanks to tubby
Tim Harrington's beastly, unpredictable stage presence.
After the show, Linda and I wanted shirts from the show, but
the band had already begun putting everything away into
their van, which was parked I don't know where. But
Mickey did. So he sprinted out into the freezing cold while
Linda and I stayed back in Olde Club eating cheese puffs.

"Send in the clones, we have the buffers" that my mom got
in grad school. I imagine it was one of those shirts she got at
a science conference or with an order of lab equipment and
wore on weekends to do yard work or when she was playing
with me.

The shirt is this light, slate color with the words "Les

I still don't know. Turtle? Snail? Banana slug? It instantly
became my most worn shirt because the color matched
everything and it fit perfectly, just a little oversized like I
like it. During finals, I think I wore it consecutively for
almost a week. (It was finals, okay!) That summer, when
Linda was in Paris and I was in Taipei, we decided to start a
photo blog to document our adventures. As different as our
photos were, that shirt would occasionally pop up in both of
our posts. It became the sisterhood of the traveling Les Savy
Fav shirt.
I know I slumped a little sophomore year, but when I start
unraveling all the memories associated with this T-shirt,
that year actually turns out to be pretty fun. And that's how
I'd like to remember it. Years from now when I've hopefully
settled into a new life, the people, places and even I, will
probably be quite different. My Les Savy Fav shirt will have
become faded and threadbare by then, the perfect item for a
vintage clothing store. But I'd rather endure another vicious
mosh-pit at age forty than give up this shirt. Besides, all the
meaning associated with it would be lost on anyone else but
me anyways. After all, who's ever heard of 'Swathmore'?

There are some clothes that we wear to keep up appearances, and others that we wear merely for ourselves, as
reminders of a bygone time, as a badge ofhonor or a memorial to something or someone. The best items of clothing in
that regard are those that are somehow temporally associated with significant events, infused with a sense of history.
They're more than mere mementos, and don't necessarily
need to drip with sentimentality either. Take my dad again.
Never one to wax nostalgic, his favorite piece of clothing is

Sand-covered beds and the soft colors of a robotic dinosaur were among the
works featured in the List Gallery this week as part of the Senior Art Show
2008. Meghan Downie ’OB and Nick Forrest ‘OB are the two artists whose
works were on display. The paintings and sculptures that Downie has created
often explore commonplace items such as bananas, pitchers and even a
“Roboßaptor.” Her paintings reveal the soft shades and colors inherent in
these common objects in a subtle and interesting way. “Art... is really something that 1 do partially because 1 enjoy it and partially because it helps me feel
connected to the world around me. I feel like I understand or appreciate the
objects that I paint or sculpt more than those I don't,” Downie said.
Forrest takes a more philosophical approach to art in his exhibit. “I think in
both my writing and my art I have been dealing with the space between imagined realities and lived realities,” Forrest said, adding that he finds much of his
inspiration in “the process of reading and writing poetry.” His art explores the
question "How does one traverse and how is one transformed by the space
between observation and imagination?” Indeed, one series entitled
“Pilgrimage” consists of paintings of boys interacting with beds, mattresses and
bed frames in addition to three-dimensional boxes filled with sand and small
beds into which the audience can peer.

Ban on same-sex
marriage in Pa.?
Yesterday, the newly elected Australian government announced that it would be taking
steps to remove discrimination against queer
couples in over 100 laws. This marks a drastic
change for the nation, which previously discriminated against queer couples through taxes,
pensions and government-services benefits.

While the Australian government will be actively changing its laws to ensure more rights for a
minority group, Pennsylvania's state senate is
set to continue along a regressive and discriminatory trajectory, as a result of recent legislation
driven by a coalition of social conservatives.
Conservative and religious interest groups

have successfully lobbied state representatives
to propose an amendment to the state's constitution that would define marriage as solely
between one man and one woman. The proposed
legislation, currently under consideration by
the
Committee
of
the
Appropriations
Pennsylvania Senate, will ban civil unions and
same-sex marriage, or any functional equivalent. The structure of the legislation resembles
the constitutionalbans passed in 27 other states.
If enacted, the legislation would erode the
rights and benefits already secured for queer
couples in relationships that are the functional

equivalent of marriage, in both Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh.

It is not enough
to hope for change

.

Proponents of the ban argue that such legislation is needed in order to preserve the sanctity and stability of marriage. The larger argument at stake here is one that says that queer
relationships should not be state-sanctioned
because they are unhealthy and that two consenting adults who love each other cannot be
happy together.

Social conservatives need to recognize that
people can be happy in relationships that do not
conform to conventional gender constructs.
Marriage is not an inherently heteronormative
institution, and in our purportedly open, democratic society, individuals should have the freedom to partner with whomever they choose.
It is time for every state, that has not already
acted, to move in the direction chosen by
Massachusetts, South Africa, Spain, Canada,
Belgium and the Netherlands in supporting
same-sex marriages. Passing this legislation will
not stop people from engaging in relationships
with each other and will not stop the tide of
change forever.
Those who invoke the sanctity of marriage
argument would be wise to recall that the same
argument was used 50 years ago to obstruct proposals for the legalization of interracial marriage. When interracial marriages were not
legal, those commitments were not any less real
except in the civil sense. Marriage represents a
monogamous commitment to another person,
and that commitment can be made regardless of
the nomenclature of the given society.
It is not enough to hope for change, to hope
that the elected leaders of the state of
Pennsylvania will realize that the argument
against marriage equality depends on
entrenched homophobia and emotionally
charged religious denunciations. We must rise
up against these kinds of obstacles, and work to
thwart this legislation from going any further.

My Big Number!
A few weeks ago I discussed the ethos

of Swarthmore with an eccentric alum,
eager to gain some perspective on my
experience as I prepared to graduate.
Quite out of the blue, the conversation
took a turn towards the personal, and all
of a sudden, we found ourselves reflecting
on our respective college experiences.
Her tenure here, from 1967-1971, had seen
the dramatic, painful transformation of
the College and larger society.
Though she

was a self-described radical activist, then
and now, she reminisced somewhat ruefully that the College had been through
'hell and back' and taken many people
along for the ride, herself included. Maria
regarded the many years following
Swarthmore as a time for healing, when
she reflected on what had happened to her

ing is, in every case, very complicated
and difficult to define.' (It seems that
Swarthmorean wish-wash is ever a staple
of campus culture!)
Later, at Maria's suggestion, I made
my way to McCabe's third floor to page
through the Halcyons of years past.
Steeped in the images and events of
Swarthmore's storied past, I sought to
glean from those printed words and faded
portraits something about what Maria
spoke to. In the hours I spent there,
though, what struck me most were two
pictures I came across: one, of the ivyclad, ornately designed Carnegie Library
(a.k.a. "Old" Tarble), and another, of the
same building, gutted and ravaged by the
wrath of an unnamed student arsonist in
September 1983.
Unlike Parrish, Tarble was never
rebuilt to its former glory after it was
taken by fire. Seeing in these pictures the
enormity of what had been lost in its
it was a recreation center, a

cherished band space, a student center,
and a party space I thought about what
Maria

had said and wondered what

Swarthmore had done to that arsonist.
There had been similar acts of arson committed in Mary Lyon and Clothier, both of
which this student was suspected to be
the culprit. What had Swarthmore taken
away from him that was so great that he
wanted to take something back, and in
such a destructive, symbolic way?

dwindle into winter, and spring's brilliance of colors, which sets ablaze the
campus once more; the equally predictable cycle of firestorms of controversy

that overtake the campus. Here we find
romantic flames, some of them lifelong,
all kindled in a comfy Quaker matchbox.
For many Swarthmoreans, too, their time
at Swarthmore marks the moment that
ignited that inner light we call a social

We are a little scorched,
perhaps, but nonetheless

stronger
because of what we went
through here.
...

I mean, Swarthmore has been intense,

but I would never want to vengefully burn
down a cherished community space. This
Swarthmorean intensity, in fact, is at the
root of what Maria was talking about, and
from the glossy admissions brochures to
Bob Gross's, "No matter what you do or
say to me...," we've received many warnings about the challenges this place puts
to us. In a sense, then, fire seems quite
appropriate for characterizing the experience here. No one escapes completely
unscathed, nor should anyone expect to.
Apparently, though, some people are
burned quite badly, sacrificing much to
the demands of the place.
Still, there is a softer side of
Swarthmore, one that also fits well with
the metaphor offire. It is, for example, the
place where we first come to know the
fiery passions in our hearts; the glowing
warmth of success; the red, orange and

conscience.
In the end, though, the hardship i&
real. We give up something to
Swarthmore, that we might change and
grow by our time here. We walk away
from it all with lasting marks that attest
to our transformation in the fires of this
place. We are a little scorched, perhaps,

but nonetheless alive and all the more
vibrant, stronger because of what we

went through here. I don't know what
these 'somethings' sacrificed are
they
are different for everyone
but I do
know that we accept the bad with the good
in the hopes of becoming better people for
it.

Graduation is nearly here, and I am of
course grateful for every moment of my
experience. While I am looking toward
the future, trying to discern the shape of
things to come, I am also increasingly

reflective about Maria's words and my
own complicated relationship with

Swarthmore.

Swarthmore really was a trial by fire,
and while I am appreciative of the many
things I gained, for some time to come I
will be wondering about what I gave up,
trying to catalogue the things I lost in the

fire.

We have spent our time at Swarthmore studying comfortably, while our peers were serving
and continue to
serve in the military in the United States' wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan. In part, too much respect for the offices
of our political leaders, rather than their deeds, led our
country to put our fellow young peers into the undeniable hell of war. Poverty, social inequality, war and lack
of freedom stem in part from our reluctance to question
properly the institutions and social structures that allow
such injustices to persist. Let us be aware of what

to invoke what
may be the quintessential Swarthmore platitude. When
President Al Bloom spoke at his first commencement in
his current office, he argued that the college should foster in its students what he termed "ethical intelligence."
I want to propose an additional creed for us to assume:

"ethical irreverence."
While attending Swarthmore we honor our professors
who, we are told, will lead us to better and deeper understand our world. Administrators tell us that we are part
of an institution of elite higher learning committed to
social justice. Our families see us as children who attend
Swarthmore to somehow transform into intellectually
sound adults. Much of this is true, for we do not reach
graduation without these people. But they and their
respective generations leave us in times that also have
much to be desired.

THE PHOENIX

When I argue that we should embrace "ethical irreverence" as a concept, I mean to say that we must open our
hearts to the people who have led us to where we are

surface, our friendship may have seemed unlikely

proposing here. His open-heart, love for his friends and
love for life were complemented by a sense that no icon
was too sacred for a good laugh or a little fun. At newspaper meetings, he was always willing to challenge the
conventional wisdom expressed during any debate,
regardless of if we were discussing a profound political
matter or whether or not to get pizza after a Monday
night editorial board meeting.
In the spirit of ethical irreverence that Tariq, in many
ways, embodied, I tried jokingly to provoke him by arguing at a Sharpies dinner that Abraham Lincoln was, in
fact, our country's worst president, as he should have
just let the South secede so that we wouldn't have to deal
with it today. Tariq, proud of home and family, clearly
would not let this preposterous point stand. His defense
of the South was just as vigorous as his epic discourses
on the merits of "crunk" rapper Li'l Jon. I write this column with the memory of his unmistakable laugh and
deep heart in my mind.
Bob Dylan has an enigmatic song called "Open The
Door, Homer," where, in my mind, he speaks to the idea
of ethical irreverence that I write of here: "Tack up all of
your memories,' said Nick / 'For you cannot relive them
/ And remember when you are out there trying to heal
the sick / You must first forgive them'." As we encounter
the world beyond our college years and engage with the
current illnesses of this world, we are armed with the lessons of those who came before us. Doing so with ethical
irreverence means we must keep our hearts open to
these people. But they gave us their wisdom only for it to
be re-imagined once again.

When we leave Swarthmore we should thank our par-

ents and professors, friends and loved ones. Let us also
recognize and forgive their failings. The world needs

more open hearts, less constricting reverence. Let us eel
ebrate our time here with open, irreverent hearts.

Track tunes up for Conferences next week
Mullarkey runs steeple at Penn

Men make noise at TCNJ, Penn

Darby

Vanßuren 'lO both dropped season bests
in the 800. Darby posted a 1:57, which

was good enough to earn a 6th place finish. Vanßuren also posted an impressive time of 2:05, successfully qualifying
for Conferences. Teammate Jaymes
Fairfax-Columbo 'lO was full of praise for
Vanßuren's race. "Andrew ran a really
good race. Last week he missed qualifying by .01 [seconds] and he dropped two

seconds this weekend, while running
into the wind. I called it. I said he would
do it, and he did it. Andrew Vanßuren
does not disappoint," he said.
Seth Green 'lO and Alex Breslow 11
also competed in the 800, posting times
of 2:11 and 2:27 respectively.
Mickey Katz 'OB also ran a season

Men's lacrosse splits final two games, finishes undefeated in non-Conference action
The Swarthmore men's lacrosse
team (8-7, 1-7 CC) finished off its last

defeated the Rangers of Drew
University, but dropped its last game
to rival #9 Haverford College on
Saturday.
The Garnet's win against Drew

secured an undefeated record for the

team in non-conference play (7-0), the

Women's tennis (12-6, 9-1 CC) traveled to

Johns Hopkins

University

this weekend to com-

pete
the
Centennial
Conference
in
Championships. In the semi-finals , they faced
off against a resilient Muhlenberg College team
(10-5, 8-2 CC), which they handily defeated 5-2 for
their second win against the Mules this season.
"Going into the Conference Championships this
weekend, the team was pretty pumped up. We
recently played a very close match against the
nationally ranked TCNJ [The College of New
Jersey] and felt good about our performance,"

Erica Lukoski 'OB said.
"During the regular season we only beat
Muhlenberg 5-4," Rachel Wallwork 'lO said. "So
everyone needed to play their best."
Led by the All-Centennial Conference doubles
team of Jennie Park 'O9 and Rachel Wallwork 'lO,
the Garnet began the day winning doubles 2-L
Erica Lukoski 'OB and Luann Cignavitch 'll won
the #2 doubles match. "Our doubles win was
great. We lost to them in a tight match 9-7 during conference play and wanted a chance to play
against them. We were aggressive from the start
and stepped up on key points," Lukoski said.
In singles action, Centennial Conference
Player of the Year Rachel Wallwork 'lO led the
team with a win at #1 singles. Swat also saw singles victories from three-time All- Centennial

Conference selection Jennie Park, Jamie
Midyette 'OB and Alexis Hickman 'll "I won my
singles match, which confirmed our win, but the
two still on the court looked like they were going
to pull through their matches as well. The whole
team played a really great match," Hickman
said.

"Everyone on the team has improved tremendously throughout the season and our hard work
was reflected in the score. I was really
impressed by the high level of energy of the team
during the Muhlenberg match," Wallwork said.
On Sunday, Swarthmore faced Johns
Hopkins (15-3, 10-0) for the Centennial
Conference Championship. "The atmosphere
was very intense. It was raining so we played
indoors, which changed the match a bit. The fact

that a conference championship title was on the
line was quite evident in the mood of the indoor
tennis-center," recalled Lukoski said.
Swat got off to a rough start, trailing the Blue
Jays 2-1 after doubles. "Being down 2-1 going into
singles is a lot different than 3-0, and our singles
play was great, coming out with great intensity
and effort," Lukoski said.
Swarthmore saw singles victories from
Wallwork and Park but couldn't overcome
Hopkins for the title, falling 5-3. The Garnet lost
to the Blue Jays 9-0 in regular season play.
"My singles match was mentally and physically exhausting, but the team support really
helped me pull through," Park said.
Wallwork agreed, saying, "The support from
the team was crucial for finding the energy to
come back and win those close matches."
"The match was awesome. As our coach told
us, we left it all out on the court. We showed that
despite graduating a significant portion of our
line-up last year, we still came in second in the
conference and played in the championship
match. The only thing that could have made the
match better would have been winning, but I am
very pleased with the match we played and the
sportsmanship we showed," contributed
Lukoski said.
"All of our hard work this season really paid
off this weekend," Park said. "While we lost in
the conference finals, everyone played their best,
and you can't ask for more than that. We finished
strong and it was a great way to end a successful
season."
"I have had a great time this season! The girls
have been great and made it so much fun! I can't
wait for next season, even though I am going to
miss our seniors!!" exclaimed Hickman.
Women's tennis says farewell to two seniors:
Erica Lukoski and Jamie Midyette. "The end of
my senior season was great," Lukoski said. "I am
going to miss the team and tennis incredibly
next year and feel so lucky to have been part of
such a wonderful program for my four years at
Swarthmore. I am proud to say that as seniors,
Jamie and I hold a 38-2 centennial conference
team record, having been Centennial Conference
Champions twice and runners-up twice. Now
that is impressive!"

SPORTS IN BRIEF
Men's tennis upset by Haverford in CC semis
The Swarthmore men's tennis
team's season was cut short last
weekend with a heartbreaking loss
to the rival Fords of Haverford
College. The Garnet men also took
on the Fords last Wednesday, beating them 6-3 and building upon
what was already a 49 game winning streak against the program.
On Saturday, however, an unexpected injury left the Garnet
exposed, resulting in a 5-4 defeat,
Swarthmore's first loss to the black
squirrels since 1956.
On Wednesday, Swarthmore rallied to beat Haverford for the 50th
consecutive time, securing the #2
seed in the Conference tournament
and bringing their overall record to
7-9 (7-2 CC). The Garnet earned victories in the No. 2, 4, 5, and 6 singles, and the No. 1 and No. 2 dou-

bles.

In
doubles action, Kevin
Shaughnessy 'O9 paired with
Jonathan Lo 'OB to take the No. 1
match 8-3. JJ England 'O9 and Mark
Greenburg 'O9 followed with an
exciting tiebreak win in the No. 2
match. This gave the Garnet a 2-1
lead going into the singles matches.
Swarthmore finished strong to
seal the victory in the singles
matches. Shaughnessy improved
his personal record to 8-1 in conference, winning the No. 2 match.
Mark Wee 'll, Greenburg and

Justin diFeliciantonio 'lO also
claimed their matches in the No. 4,
5, and 6 matches, respectively.
The win on Wednesday put the
Garnet in the number 2 spot for the
Centennial
Conference
Tournament, hosted by the #1 seed,
Johns Hopkins University. The
Garnet was scheduled to face the #3

seed, Haverford, in what was hoped
to be a repeat of Wednesday's
action, but the matchup took a late
and unexpected turn for the worst.
Haverford jumped into the lead
early, reversing the doubles scores
from Wednesday's action and carrying a 2-1 lead into the singles
matches. England and Greenburg
held strong in the No. 2 match for
the Garnet win. As singles action
started up, Shaughnessy continued
his hot streak, beating Haverford's
Stephen Feder at the No. 2 spot and
bringing his record to 9-1 CC. This
left the overall score tied at two.
Haverford struck again, taking
the next two matches (No. 6 and No.
1) and reclaiming a 4-2 lead. The
Garnet battled back, however, as
Greenburg and England continued
to perform, winning the No. 5 and
No. 3 matches, respectively. This
locked up the score at 4 a piece and
left it up to the last singles match,
the No. 4 fight between Wee and
Haverford's Marc Rudolph.
Wee took on Rudolph with confidence, as he had beaten him in
straight sets on Wednesday (6-2, 75). Every point was a battle, as both
of the first two sets went into
tiebreaks, one ending in Wee's
favor and one in Rudolph's.
Going into the third set, however, Wee began to suffer from intense
cramps in his leg and was unable to
move as quickly and agilely as
usual. Rudolph quickly seized this
advantage and finished Wee off in
the third set, 6-0. This unfortunate
loss put an abrupt end to the
Garnet men's weekend. It brings
their season record to 7-10 overall.

Soccer's transition to USA a bumpy road
I've
never
really
thought about why the
world's most popular sport
never took off in this country. Having just watched

the Manchester Utd.
Barcelona match, I feel
like everyone could appreciate the beauty of the
--

game. In fact, I truly pity
those without a passion for
this game. I've recently
thought about this issue a
lot, but still can't come up

with anything concrete.
Below are some of my musings and the voice inside
Red Card
my head agrees.
SOCCER IS BORING! I
can't tell you how many
times I've heard that before. Ok, so I guess this is a relative
statement as I'm sure many of you compare it with sports
like American football, basketball, and baseball (which is
probably as boring as a 5-day cricket test match). Fine, I
could see how basketball is intense because you're constantly either attacking or defending and some of the passes,
plays and dunks are so sick to watch. I could also see how
American football is an attractive sport, but I've never really been much of a fan of stop-start sports (that's why volleyball gets boring after a while, because there isn't much room
for individual creativity).
Another question I have is if soccer is considered "boring," then why are sports like golf, tennis, NASCAR and

DHEERAJ RAVI

...

THE PHOENIX

bowling pretty popular? (ESPN devotes much more time to
these sports than soccer and the MLS doesn't count.) No,
soccer is definitely not boring. Before saying that, you
shouldprobably watch a game or two. If you are free/want to
enjoy 90 minutes, watch a match between two entertaining
sides (Man Utd vs. Barca, for instance). It is one of the hardest games to learn because it involves using your legs (come
to think of it, not many sports that are popular in American
use legs apart from running), which are much harder to con...

trol than your hands.

And it's not like the effort isn't there. Nike has spent piles
of money trying to increase the popularity of the game, but
have they been doing it right? Back in the 70s, Pele played for
the New York Cosmos in the National American Soccer
League and pundits predicted that he would revolutionize
the way Americans thought about soccer. He didn't. People
here don't really know who he is or what he's done for the
game. Back to the present, we are repeating our mistake by
naming David Beckham (not even close to as good as Pele
was) and people are predicting that he will change the game.
How is one single person going to change conceptions when
he is living big in Hollywood, especially if the American people don't know about his background? He and his wife will
definitely take up space in newspapers (why do I call them
newspapers more like hogwash mixed with drivel).
But honestly, the problem is with our culture. We are
-

very individualistically oriented about many things (not
that it's a bad thing, just a different way of thinking
about your place in this world). Having never lived in
this country before I came for college, I've noticed

Americans, or at least those most influenced by the consumerist machine that engulfs us all, have very different
mentalities and thought processes as compared to more
May

X 2008

interdependent cultures (I know this is a very simplistic
assessment but bear with me). In these cultures, family
relationships are of primary importance. The ability to
incorporate others around you in your self-definition is

unheard of in many individualistic societies. This may
be a reason why sports like rugby and soccer are much
more appealing in other parts of the world (Latin
America, Africa, Asia, okay, Europe's an exception
because it is fairly individualistic). Sure, there's basketball, which is popular in America, but it's also very popular around the world (there's a reason why America
didn't get gold in Athens at the 2004 Olympics!). And*
some may claim that sports like American football and
baseball are team sports, but are they really? Baseball
usually involves two or three players at most in any play.
The stop-start aspect of football undermines claims that
it's a team sport because much more strategy and precision is involved (i.e. setting up plays, time-outs, etc.) as
opposed to the players having to control the movement
and tempo of the game, not arbitrary rules.
As capitalists, we are obsessed with results and
progress. American commentators for American sports
make a much bigger deal about things like statistics.
While these do serve to keep track of players' performances and categorize them, it isn't really as fun as the
process. Claims about soccer being boring come from
those who can't relax and be patient and enjoy a spectacle in front of their eyes. I urge you all to watch the
upcoming Champions League Final, but most importantly, the forthcoming Euros as I'm sure there'll be plenty of*
emotions flying all over the place.

Softball splits pair at Haverford, preps for playoffs
BY BEN RAPHEL

braphell@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore softball team split its regular season
finale with Haverford on Saturday and is now preparing
for the Centennial Conference playoffs. The Garnet
secured its third straight berth to the conference playoffs
on April 18 with a 40 shutout win over
Franklin Marshall
&

ip

College.
HAVERFORD
0
Last Saturday, the
Garnet traveled to
having
Haverford,
just lost two days earlier to nationally
7 ranked
HAVERFORD
Rowan
University by the
score of 7-0. The Haverford doubleheader was not only a
competition against Swarthmore's fiercest rival, but also a
chance to play against another conference playoff team.
The first game against the Fords was an instant classic.
For nine scoreless innings, Kathryn Riley 'lO waged an
intense pitching battle with Haverford pitcher Becky
Garibotto. Finally, in the top of the tenth, Krista Scheirer 11
hit the game-winning single, scoring Kira Kern 11 The
Garnet held the Fords scoreless in the bottom of the inning,
holding on for the 1-0 victory. Each pitcher only gave up six
hits in the game, while Riley posted 11 strikeouts in the winning effort.
"The fact that Haverford is our sister school and one of
our main rivals helped us persevere through the ten
innings," Christine Sendelsky 'O9 said in an e-mail. "We
came out ready to play in the first game, our team was fired
up and full of energy."

In game two of the Haverford doubleheader, the
Garnet scored first when Sendelsky singled to score
Monica Cody 10 in the top of the first.
However, Haverford answered quickly and tied the
score in the bottom of the inning. The Fords then scored
six runs in the bottom of the fourth, and despite a valiant
comeback effort, Swarthmore never could recover. In the
next inning, Sendelsky hit a two-run double, while
Melissa Emmerson 'll had an RBI single to help close the
gap. An RBI double by Katie Gold 'OB erased the deficit,
but these crucial hits would not be enough for the
Garnet, as the team fell short to the Fords, 7-5. Al Zelaski
'O9 gave up eight hits over six innings of work in the losing effort.
The split at Haverford left Swarthmore with a 21-16
record for the season, along with a 10-6 record in the
Centennial Conference. This record gives the Garnet the
fourth and final spot in the conference playoffs this
weekend. The playoffs are a two-day, double elimination
tournament that will take place at top-seeded Ursinus

College.
The Garnet will play its first playoff game against the
host Bears, starting around noon on Saturday. The team
will be looking for revenge against an Ursinus team that
shut out the Garnet twice earlier this season.
"We're ready to take the home team down in their
own territory," Kristin Caspar 'O9 said. "Ursinus is our
biggest competitor right now."
"We are a very resilient team, and we have the talent
to beat Ursinus. We need to put the ball in play, on the
ground instead of in the air, which makes for easy outs,
and capitalize on their mistakes," Sendelsky said. "We
need to make the adjustment to hit the outside pitch
because that's where [Ursinus pitcher] Lauren Davis will
be putting the ball all day."

The other two opponents that Swarthmore may face in
the conference tournament will be second-seeded Haverford
and third-seeded Dickinson College. The Garnet split its doubleheaders earlierthis season against both the Fords and the
Red Devils.
"To win conferences we need to go into every game confident in ourselves, our teammates and coaches. We need to
know that at the end of the day we're a great team, but we
need to be that great team," Sendelsky said.
"No matter who we play this weekend, it should be a
high-energy game," Caspar said.

"I feel fortunate to be a member of
such a talented, well-rounded team."
Christine Sendelsky 'O9
Despite what happens at the conference tournament this
weekend, this season has been very successful for
Swarthmore softball. The Garnet has once again reached the
Centennial playoffs, along with competing against some
tough nationally-ranked opponents. In addition, a talented
corps of freshmen made an impact at the plate this season,
and with only one graduating senior on this year's squad,
the Garnet should again be a force in future seasons.
"I feel fortunate to be a member of such a talented,
well-rounded team," Sendelsky said. "I just hope this
year we can take the next step and be in the championship game, coming out of it the championship team,
and I believe that this year, more than ever, we are capable of doing so because our current team is the most talented team we've had so far."
