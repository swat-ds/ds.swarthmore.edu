B&G Investigates Oil Leakage
By Melissa Jacobs
Seven sealed drums currently sit
in Physical Plant's Services Building. The fifty-five gallon drums resemble those used to collectenvironmentally hazardous waste, and even
here amongst the meticulously labeled trees of the Scott Arboretum,
they are being used for that very
unsettling purpose.
Two years ago the crew of Build-

ings and Grounds decided that the
time was long overdue to replace the

thirty-seven year old oil tanks used

by the heating plant. Even before the
unearthing of these tanks had begun,

Buildings and Grounds suspected
leakage. Upon digging,Physical Plant
found #6 oil in the ground surrounding the tanks. It remains unclear
whether the free product plume, or
escaped oil, is a result of leakage in
the aging oil tanks or whether it was

the result of overflow during filling
of the tanks. Regardless of how the
oil found its way into the ground, the
immediate concern was removing the
leaked oil before it contaminated the
Crum creek.
C. Stuart Hain, Facilities Director
of Buildings and Grounds, believes
that it is the College's responsibility
to pay proper attention so that the
leakage does not become a greater

Swarthmore alumna Jennifer
Romich graduated in Spring '94 with
a degree in economics, but today she
can befound in Chicago'sWest Side
rather than on Wall Street. Romich
is one of 15 new members of the
Inner-City Teaching Corps (ICTC),
a selective volunteer program that
recruits graduates of the nation's top
colleges and universities to teach
and to inspire students living in impoverished Chicago neighborhoods.
ICTC was founded in 1992 by
Patrick Ryan, a parochial school
social studies teacher, to meet the
needofurban schools for able teachers. Since ICTC's inception, 35 recent college graduates have been
acceptedby the Corpsand they have
taught over 1,100children in parochial schools.
ICTC's mission is to energize inner-city schools by "bringing together dynamic young men and
women to work in the spirit of helping others to help themselves."ICTC
believes that, along with tremendous ability, a high levelofcommitment from volunteersis necessary to
achieve this goal. Those who participate in the program make a twoyear commitment to teach or coach
in Chicago while living in ICTC
community housing withotherCorps
members.
As a volunteer, Romich receives
only room, board, medical insurance, transportation, and a salary of
five dollars a day to teach fifth grade
in the Near West Side. She says that
her lifestyle is "not a sacrifice at all."
The program provides much of what
she needs, in addition to the opportunity to "teach whereI feel needed."
Romich feels that one of the hardest parts of teaching in ICTC is being forced to compromise the educational ideals she held at Swarthmore.
She says she had hoped that all aspects of her class would be a break
from the traditional, but ifshe spends
a lot of time planning a creative
math lesson, she might need to use
exercises from a book for grammar

Dean Mason, Quintessential "Tri-College
Man," Will Leave Swat at End of Semester
By Amy Albert
JoeM ason, Associate Deanfor Multicultural
Affairs, will be leaving Swarthmore at theend
of this semester to continue work on his doctoral thesis. Mason has coordinated
multiculturalefforts in both academicand nonacademic areas for the past two years.
Mason has sought to create "a larger and
larger cultural space on campus," which, he
says, encourages discussions of multicultural
issues. He has coordinated activities of the
Black Cultural Center, the Intercultural Center, and the Gender Equity Advisor's Office,
and worked to create a visionof a multicultural
future at Swarthmore. As a part of these efforts,
he will be making a presentation on November
4 at a conference on black cultural centers
concerning theneed for "black cultural centers
to assume leadership...in the movements toward multiculturalismand multi-racialism."
With the Mellon Seminar Group, which
focuses on issues of gender, race, and class in
the classroom, Mason tried to identify and
address problems specific to minorities and

women in the classroom.
Prior to serving in the Multicultural Affairs
Office, Mason served as head of the Black
Cultural Center for three years. He considers
thishis mostrewarding position at Swarthmore.

"There I could set goals and figure out when I
had reached them," he said. His work in the
Office for MulticulturalAffairs has been more
policy-oriented, making it more difficult to
notice its immediate effects.
Mason has long been a part of the Tri-College Community.He graduated from Haverford
and is currently completing doctoral studies at
Bryn Mawr. As he explains it, "I'm called a
Tri-CollegeMan." He has used tri-college connections in his work at Swarthmore to encourage the sharing ofresources and facilities among
the colleges. He has also worked extensively
with the Tri-Co program, a networkfor minority students on all three campuses.
Looking toward the future, Mason thinks
Swarthmore needs to further define its outlook
on multiculturalism through student, staff, and
administrative efforts. Two task forces formed
by the College Planning Committee (CPC),
one of which deals with speech issues and the
other of which deals with issues raised by
diversity, will begin meeting later this year to
begin this undertaking both inside and outside

later in the day. Romich says, "I wrote
down my ideals [for my classroom]
at the beginning of the summer and I
make sure I look at them every so
often." She continually evaluates if
what she does in class is advancing
her hopes of improving her students
school performance.
Another obstacle which Romich
faces is that the students resist if she
tries to employ teaching methods that
are too innovative. She attempted a
class newspaper project at the beginning of the year, but the children
were too out of control for it to be
successful. Romich says she has to
remember that these kids were conditionedby theirprevious educational
experiences to learn by rote. They are
not yet sure how to respond to the
break from routine her teaching presents, and as a result she spends much
time teaching the children how to
behave in the educational setting she
has provided them. "I wanted to have
an enactive classroom," she says, "but
these are kids who can't go out and
experience life without beating on
each other first."
Romich' s most markededucational
success has been improving the writing skills of her students. They spend
twenty minutes every day writing in
their journals. After two months of
school, "Kids who couldn't write a
sentenceare now writing full pages,"
she remarks. The students are also
making progress in reading, and
Romich has abandoned the basal
reader in favor of novels.
Romich is glad to be working in
the parochial school system, which
inher opinion far surpasses Chicago's
inner-city public school system in
the quality of its educational program. Only 10% of the students are
Catholic; most are going to parochial
schools because they come from
homes in which the adults value education and are willing to pay what
part of the tuition they can afford.
Romich says, "The kids who go to
these schools don't want to be gang
bangers ortakedrugs...They are good
kids and they want to learn."

Thanh Hoang '97 gathered impressions of
students immediately after Allen Ginsberg's
poetry reading on Monday, October 31
"It was funny and
provocative. Being that I read
him before, hearing the music
and his voice made the poetry
come to life and much more
powerful. He's a great
political and spiritual writer/'

and repeatedly argued

that repairs for normal
wear and tear should be
paid by the College, not
the students," according
to Chang-Muy.
Feldman remarks,
"The optimal situation
would be to find out who
did the damage. But since
we don't know who did
it, it seems most fair that
the students as a community would share the
cost." This arrangement
is similar to the one that already exists in

dents of vandalism Tull and Chang-Muy discovered were a damaged door to an equipment
storage room, a bathroom wallkicked in on the
second floor, and flourescent lights ripped out
in the basement. Tull estimated that the total
cost of repairs wouldbe $7OO for parts and $6OO
for labor.
Chang-Muy then notifiedAndy Feldman '96
and Jack Schecter '96, co-coordinators of Student Council, of the charge, "emphasizing that
therequest for payment was for vandalism, not

residence halls.

Although it is the most equitable solution
given the situation, "with over 100 clubs on this
campus who rely on Student Activity funds,
[over] $lOOO spent on repair costs is a big
waste," Feldman said. He hopes the fact that
"when Swatties do vandalism, Swatties foot
the bill" will "impress on the minds of those
energetic people who like to swing from light
fixtures and kick through walls."

The Department of Public Safety has hired
three new employees to fill "vacancies due to

The new staff members are Darlene Boyd,
Sheila Carter, and John Amis. Boyd is the coowner of Holmes Public Safety, a retail business dealing in police, fire, and safety equipment. "She attended Keystone Business School

"At first I thought he seemed
really quiet, but then it was
really amazing to see him

boy, very enthusiastic about
his work. He wanted us to
feel the same way about his
work like he did."

Membersof the Department ofPublic Safety
recently participated in a program of diversity
training which focused on issues of public
relations.
Cultural Diversity Workshops, the first of
which occurred last year, are mandatory for all
members of the PublicS af ety department. They
were initiated because "it's a very germane
topic in general to society today, and extremely
germane to colleges," Owen Redgrave remarked.-.
Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges joined
forces with Swarthmore to conduct the program this year. Two sessions were held,
oneSwarthmore and one at Bryn Mawr. Empty
spaces were made open to members of local
police forces, but "we pretty much filled both
workshops," Redgrave said.
According to Redgrave, discussion topics
included "workforce and societal demographics," "definitionsof diversity," and "sources of
prejudice." Participants watched a video titled
"A Class Divided" and discussed both stereotypes and ways to treat issues of diversity in
situations they encounter in the course of their

Second Annual
Haunted House
Deemed a Success
Leon Francis, assistant director of Public
Safety, announced thatthe Halloween Haunted
House in Old Tarble was a success. It raised
over $lOOO for the American Cancer Society.
Approximately 1600 guests visited the House,
which was open for the second consecutive
year, he said. It was staffed by members of the
SwarthmoreCollege Public Safety department
and the Parkside Fire Company. No students
participated in organizing the events, Francis
said. All labor was volunteered, and costs were
paid by the two hosting organizations. Public
Safety "hopes to do this next year given the
great response from the community," Owen
Redgrave said.

ICTC....from page 1
Romich is thankful for the fact that the parochial school provides an atmosphere in which
these students, who come from neighborhoods
stricken with violence, can speak freely of
morals, values, and God.This helped her deal
with a situation "when the students asked me
why a five-year-old girl had gotten pushed out
of a window, what else could I say but, 'We
have to pray to God.'"Romich adds, "I can also
tell them I love them, which I couldn't do in a
public school."
The greatest reward Romich has received
fromICTC has been the experience of working
with the families of the children and the children themselves. The parents of the children

often stop in to see her, and some volunteer at
theschool. Children, parents, and teachers participate in fund-raisers which provide financial
aid for the children.
Romich also has gained muchfrom theexperience of living with other members of ICTC.
She is a part ofa structured community; there is
one budget and all the housemates take turns
cooking and shopping. Her social life is provided for her; in this sense, she believes, "it's a
lot like dorm life at Swat." Yet shefinds herself
doing twice as much work as before.

support for the shows. We monitor auditions
for all shows, with the intention of making sure
that all students are given a fair chance; and we

has on the one hand lead the Drama Board to
sponsor workshops and joint venture projects
which fall outside of the scope of producing

workshop led over a number of weeks by a
professional puppeteer, allowing people interested in investing the time to learn hands on

masks) in theater work. In addition, we plan to
sponsor an outside performer during AIDS
Awareness Week who will be giving a one-man
show that is meant to educate (and entertain.)
We are looking to other groups on campus
(community service, for example) to work with
as well. Finally, I would make note of the fact

Allen Ginsberg came to
Swarthmore on Halloween. Playing
to a crowd packed tightly into the
cinema, Ginsberg read poems describing the essential tenets of Buddhism and the wide variety of objects
that had come in contact with his
sphincter over the years.
Despite the bizarre nature of
Ginsberg' s performance, perhaps the
most interesting aspect of the evening
was watching the audience's reaction. Ginsberg is man from another
era, a piece of history. He is jolly yet
outspoken, apeace-loving, pot-smok-

ing liberal striving to find inner harmony. One wouldthink that he would
fit right in at Swarthmore considering our well-known liberalism, and
our now-publicized drug culture.
But even here he ultimately fails to
blend. From the moment he walked
in asking if he could use somebody's
copy of his collected poems to the
final ten minutes when hehad us sing
the words "and all the hills echoed"
over and over, he was a man strangely
distant from his audience.
Despite the audience's love of his
politics and admirationofhis poetry,
there was something about him that
was just different While most of the
audience was composed of the kind

of Swatties who sit around and wish
that they could have lived through
the 60's-when things were simple
and there were causes really worth
fighting for-we didn't know quite
what to make of him.
People laughed when he brought
out his little lap organ and crooned
out a poem in his hoarse yet melodic
voice. Then they gradually fell silent,
listening intently. Then there was the
abrupt, shocked silence, as he repeated the short poem that ends, "As
I cum in my hand," for the second
time. And people fidgetedrestlessly
as he sang "and all the hills echoed"
again and again, waiting for us to get
into it. He exhorted us to sing louder,
torock the room with the imagery of
childrenplaying in the hills as the sun
sets, and then he finally gave up.
We couldn't do it, we couldn't
simply let loose and sing with him.
We are made in a more pragmatic
mold. In our time, wars are failed
attempts to end famine or civil strife,
free love is deadly, every sentence
must be carefully filtered for offensive phrases, and college is a time to
worry about our futures. So we watch

Black republic in 1804, in a brutal
uprisingagainstFrench colonists. For
the next hundred years, aside from
paying debts, Haiti was economically and politically ostracized by the
rest of the world. However, in 1915,
U.S. Marines invaded Haiti, ostensibly to restore political order, and
stayed for nineteen years. During that
time, the Marines put in roads and
murdered all the members of a guerrilla organization that fought for the
rights of therural poor, among other
things. From 1957 until 1964, the

I'm
saying that
there are not real struggles nor sincere causes fought for at Swarthmore.
But the purpose and nature of these
struggles have to be questioned. The
fact that we are involved in some

Intention is not enough. Intention is
not a solution, but a motivator. Figuring it all out is half the battle and
sustaining it is the other. The fact of
the matter is that there is very little

not invested in sustaining them after

Dear Students,

Approximately four years ago, I had the privilege of
being accepted to work here. Just seeing the beauty of the
campus was breathtaking!
My first job was serving, then for a short time I cooked,
and finally transferred to the grill. This is so special to me
because here I have the best of both worlds. One of my
favorite pastimes is cooking and the fact thatI have contact
with all the students is just a dream come true. You will
never know how important you are to me. You're such a
caring group and I feel so attached to so many of you. The
only downfall is that graduation is inevitable. I just wish I
could stay here forever, and you, too.
Prior to working at the College, I was employed by the

Philadelphia Eagles Football organization-yes, those
Eagles. Sure, this was a very prestigious job, where I
met many famous players and coaches and partied with
them, but this could never compare to the joy and
happiness of working with all of you.
My only wish for you is that upon graduation, you
could be as happy and content as I; always looking
forward to work and being with such a wonderful group
of kids.
And never forget thatI'm always there for you, if you
need someone to talk to.
Respectfully yours,

Some Last-Minute, Pre-Election
Day Thoughts on PA Politics
Wofford: Concerned Santorum: Hard-Nosed, ReformMinded, and Not Wofford
and Responsible
By Maria C. Lin

"He's not perfect—he tends to be
absentminded, he mumbles., .but he's
not Rick Santorum either. Wofford is
a scholarly, principled man...one of

the few politicians in Washington
who has actually given some thought
to the issues." Listen to what the
Philadelphia Daily News (October
17, 1994) and most citizens have to
say about Senator Harris Wofford,
and the resounding voice is thathe is
a good man with a lot of integrity
who should be reelected to the U.S.
Senate. In times of the vacant politics
of sound-bites and flashy images,
Wofford remains down-to-earth. He
is not as eloquent as Santorum, not as
smooth with catch phrases and easy
answers, but a careful thinker who
has "exhibited honest concern for the
people of Pennsylvania." (Citizen's
Voice, 14 August 1994).
Harris Wofford runs on a platform
that is hard to uphold these days—one of social and civil rights. He has
demonstrated a lifetime commitment
to civil rights, from serving as special
advisor for Civil Rights to President
Kennedy to marching with Martin
Luther King in the 60s. He was the

ployer mandates.He suggests, rather,
a system ofmedical savings accounts,
or whathasbeen termed "Medisave."
With Medisave, people would save
money by purchasing health insurance policies with very high
deductibles and then invest the savings in tax-free

On November 8, we have an opportunity to exercise one of our great
rights as Americancitizens: the right
tovote.While it might seem as if one
individualvote does not make a large
difference in the big picture, voting

Wofford is more than willing to turn
more and more responsibility over to
government while our national debt
rises and we are asked to "contribute" more every
year. Nowhere in
his philosophy do

find confiin people to
do things for
themselves, like

ture welfare, and

choice, and will
provide more
affordable and
more accessible health
care coverage.
However,
there are inherent biases in
this plan. Medical savings would attract the rich
because they get the biggest benefit
from tax-free investments. And the
accounts would attract the healthy
because they would not expect to

i

money out
of
their
pockets for
health care.
As the New
York Times
wrote,

"Medisave
would hurt
thepoorand
the chronically ill and
inadvertently dis-

dents seeking educational opportunity. All in all, Wofford has shown a
sincere commitment to social
progress and education.
Wofford's special issue, however,
is health care. He has struggled to
push universal health care legislation
ever since he was elected in an upset
victory in '9l, on the mandate of
affordable health care for all. Despite
gridlock in Congress over health care
legislation, Woffordhas vowed to be
part of the battle in the future, inside
the Senate or out.
Wofford basically stands for an
employer-mandate, shared-contribution system, in which employers of
companies of over 10 workers pay
for 80% of the employee's health
insurance, and the employee pays
20%. With this proposal are lowincome subsidiesfor theunemployed,
a requirement that the employers offer their employees the choice of three
private plans, as well as a basic benefits package that covers preventive
care. He also proposes interim healthcare benefits for welfare recipients
who go to work.

is the best way we can make a statement about how we want our government to operate and who we want
representing us.
While many elections come down
to two candidates who are so similar
that finding areas of debate is impossible, this year's Pennsylvania Senate race between Harris Wofford and
Rick Santorum is a welcome exception. These are two individuals who
represent vastly different views of
what the role ofnational government
should be.

Harris Wofford, elected to theSenate in 1991, belongs to the school of
politics that likes to rely on government to do things
and to people.

for

He believes thatthe more power and
responsibility the government has
over its citizens (and their money),
the better; and he has the voting record
to back this belief up.
This philosophy, while producing
an image of a compassion and concern, has serious consequences that
are overlooked far too often. The
cost of this theory of government has
resulted in a tax burden for most

Americans that exceeds one-third of
their income, and still has left our
country deep in debt.
Wofford's approach also shows a
disturbing ignorance of history: atno

Consider the
consequences of

find a job), at least one-third of your
income will be taken from you to be

As a matter of fact, the only control
you have over how much of your
money will be taken by the government and how that money will be

an active effort. While made much
simpler over the years, filling out a
ballot is still a hassle. Furthermore,
voting fosters involvement; it forces
us to draw on knowledge to develop

the lever or fill out a ballot you put
yourself and your beliefs on the line.
It is a validation of who you are.

Thought in Practice: A Place to Start for Activism

For all of those who have been
trapped in McCabe or stuck in Chem
Lab for the entire semester, Tuesday is Election Day. Yes, it is time
once again for us to crawl out of our
ivory tower and acknowledge the
existence of a world beyond the
confines of the'Ville. Don't worry,
we are not going to preach to you
that voting is a civic duty and communal responsibility which keeps
America vibrant Voting is more
than an obligation; it is an opportunity. To some degree, voting is the
ultimate test there are no essays, no
wrong answers, and no time limits.
Aside from all this, however, voting
allows us to apply the abstract principles we learn in class toward social change.
In essence, voting is a challenge
to us all to put our money where our
collective mouths are. Sitting in
class, we discuss the importance of
social change but dolittle in the way

the standard of living. But unlike
Wofford, Rick Santorum is reluctant
to turn to government to solve all the
nation's problems and unnecessarily
sacrifice the personal freedom of its
citizens.
Rick Santorum was elected to the
House of Representatives in 1990,
defeating a seven-term incumbent.
As a member of the Budget Committee during his first term, Santorum
introduced a budget which cut the
deficit without raising taxes, and he
introduced more legislation to cut
wasteful federal spending than any
other member of Congress.
Rick Santorum was fighting for
health care reform before the issue
even became "popular" in the 1992
presidential race. Santorum introduced the idea of Medical Savings
Accounts (MS As, or "Medisave") to
Congress in 1991, shortly after his
first term began. The introduction of
Medical Savings Accounts to the
health care system would not only
make it easier for more people to
purchase insurance, but it wouldpar-

Dukakis, Angela Davis, and Allen
Ginsberg who have made activism a
lifestyle. Each challenged us in one
way or another to act out our values

and activate social change. Voting
is a start. Although it is not glamorous, it is necessary. We need to be
willing and able to make the small
sacrifices before we attempt larger
ones. Voting offers a way to do this.

Stern

ered by insurance. Either you or your
employer (if your employer offers
health insurance) make payments into
your MSA. Any money not spent
grows tax-free in your account. If
you lose your job or move on to
another, your account stays with you.
This is particularly good news for
recent graduates who often lack job
security and may start off with one
job and move on to others after a
short period of time. Years down the
line, when you retire, the money in
your MSA may be used for medical
expenses or insurance not covered by
Medicare or it may be rolled over
into a private pension plan.
Harris Wofford, who was elected
on his promise of bringing about
health care reform, has yet to offer
any solutions that would improve the
state of health care in our country.

has been in the Senate, it has been

SANTORUM, from p. 5
difficultto tell if he has had an impact
on any legislation. The Washingtonbased magazine, Human Events, had
this to say about Wofford's health
reform performance: "Upon taking
office, however, Wofford was conspicuous by his neglect of the issue,
never offering a health plan of his
own or playing a lead role in the
debate. Now in the election year, he
has been conspicuous by his embrace
of virtually every health care plan
that includesa tax hike or mandates."
Already, Wofford has signed on to
the plan offered by the President and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the"Clinton
Heavy" plan of Senator Kennedy,
and the "single payer," Canadianstyleplan offeredby Senator Daschle.
A particularly devastating element
of these plans is the implementation
of "community rating" in determining insurance costs. Community rating pools risks, ignoring factors like
age, healthy habits and medical history in an effort to make health care
cost the same for everybody. As
Johnathan Karl writes in the Christian ScienceMonitor (10/8/93), "This
[community rating] might sound fine
in theory, but inpractice it forces the
young, who have theleast amount of
disposable income, to subsidize the
health care of the middle aged, who
are atthe peak of their earning power."
The New York Times (5/22/94) on
community rating pointed out that
"thepoor may subsidize the wealthy,
since younger people generally earn
less income than older people."

Arthur V. Ferrara, chairmanof the
Life InsuranceCouncil ofNew York
(New York being the state that has
gone the furthest towards community rating) noted in The New York
Times (5/22/94) thatthe result ofcommunity rating in his state has been
that"many young people have opted
to drop theircoverage rather thanpay
the high costs associated with health
insurance.... this law has caused tremendous strain on theyounger insurance buying population."
And this is supposed to be health
insurance reform. Add to this thefact
that all plans endorsed by Wofford
include heavy employer mandates—which will undoubtedly reduce the
ability of small businesses to hire—and college graduates have a pretty
grim looking future.
This is only one ofmany ways that
Harris Wofford and Rick Santorum
differ in their vision for the future.
Take a look at what these two candidateshave done while they havebeen
in office. Find out more about how
Rick Santorum has led the fight to
clean up Congress, reform the welfare system, bring about responsible
health care reform and reduce the
burden on taxpayers. Compare his
record to HarrisWofford's and keep
this in mind when you vote on November 8.

WOFFORD, from p. 5
medical services paid for by insurance. Wofford's plan would promote
preventive health care by including
those services, such as check-ups, flu
shots, and mammograms, in the basic benefits package, and by increasing funds for research.
The medical savings accounts plan
also overlooks the likelihood that
healthy people will gravitate toward
catastrophic coverage, and thus the
regular coverage pool will consist
increasingly of the chronically ill and
more costly to insure, driving premiums higher. The New York Times
article concludes by saying that
"Medisave is a needless payoff to
rich families and a body blow to
market reform."
Supporters of Santorum's health
care plan may criticize Wofford's
plan because itinvolves "community
rating," in which groups of people
are pooled, usually geographically,
to share the costs ofhealth coverage.

They say that this is an unfairburden
for the young and healthy, who must
pay for the medical costs of the elderly and unhealthy. First of all,
Woffordproposes anage-based communityrating, so that age groups will
be pooled together to share costs.
Secondly, community rating serves
to diminish the disparity between rates
for different groups,and to lessen the
discriminationagainst those withpreexisting conditions who pay exorbi-

for the age
disparity, the elderly currently pay
about 6 times more for health coverage than the young. With age-based
community rating, the ratio would
drop to 2 times, without reverting to
a completely uniform distributionof
costs for all groups.
Basically, what it comes down to
is that Rick Santorum is unwilling to
endorse a plan with employer mantant health plan rates. As

Wofford is one of
the few politicians
left in Washington
who brings dignity
back to government
dates and low-income subsidies that

would really strive for universal
health care coverage. Instead, he offers apian thatis consumer-incentive
based, and claims that these medical
savings accounts will encourage more
people to invest in health insurance.
Although this may be true, these
people will inevitably tend to be the
wealthier and healthier, the very
people who are not in dire need of
affordable coverage today.

funding for Medicare, who promotes

Reliving your youth with bigger toys
By Julia Kernochan

Each day as I pass the gaping hole
which used to be Parrish Annex, crowds
of Swatties are gathered at the fence, faces
frozen in awe of the mighty machines
swarming over the site. This fascination
is understandable. Not so long ago we
spent our days playing in the mud, moving yellow plastic trucks and making
motor noises; now we huddle in McCabe
and squabble over reserve reading. But
construction work still dangles a visceral
lure in front of all of us.
Recently, this voyeuristic pastime
became even more thrilling with the
appearance of an actual crane. Yes, folks!
We can now call one of these exciting
machines our own. Our crane, henceforth
called Sigmund in honor of the famous
phallus admirer, is a 45-foot hydraulic
crane extending to 60 feet with the addition of the "jib" at the end. He is usually
used to pour concrete or place lumber and
steel for walls. But don't grow too emotionally attached—codependency leads
nowhere, and Sigmund is soon to be
replaced by a larger version of himself.
Apparently, size does matter.

Although posing as a Phoenix reporter
won't get you onto the actual construction
site, it does allow you to have a conversation with the charming Terry Thomas.
Those of you considering construction
work as a possible career (Humanities
majors, for example) will be glad to know
that it pays well, and according to
Thomas, everyone is there because they
enjoy it.
Though work continues through the bitter winters, fall and spring are quite pleasant. Plus, you can indulge your obsession
with plaid shirts. Anyone who is inclined
to think poorly of construction workers
may want to know that the small redroofed building on the site holds the water
pipes for the entire campus. So if you like
showers, be nice.
Though Swatties have chosen the cerebral life of the intellect over the sensual
joys of physical labor, I think we miss the
long-ago days of sunshine, dirt, and
scraped knees. Standing at the fence
watching heavy machinery, we are obviously in mourning for our Inner Child.
And when studying becomes unbearable
and our stress level skyrockets, we all
yearn to go play in the mud.

Katie Wears Felt Chicken Hat
It was Saturday night at 1130 pjn. I
was wedged between a pizza box and one

of the Wonder Twins. I was moving five
one component of my body that was left
free to gyrate, my left eyebrow, to the
beat of themusic.
You guessed it. I was at die ML
Halloween party.
By the time the clock
struck midnight, I had
basically disrobed. The
crown shaped sunglasses
and Becky's gray quilted
bathrobe that had constituted the majority of my
disguise as the Statue of
Liberty had been deposited in one of my friend's
rooms and the only remnant of my costume that
survived on my person
was the chicken hat I
wore on my head.
Now this hat is one of
my prized possessions. It
is not just a hat with a picture of a chicken on it. Nor is it merely a
baseball cap with a chicken's head
perched on the thebill. This hat is, itself,
shaped like a giant felt chicken that sits
comfortably on yourhead.
And I LOVE this hat hthebestofall
possible worlds, I would wear this hat all
day, every day. I would wear it to class.
I would wear it in the shower (you don't
really to worry about washing your hair
when you've got a chicken on your head,
anyway). I would even wear it to dinner
with that man among men, die shining
beaconoflight in die fog thatis my existence, and the only reason I bother to drag
mypoor wretched soul out of die depths
of my bed inthe morning, Keanu Reeves.

But I realize that there are some social
conventions that one can not cross. A
strange statement, you might say, from a
woman who of her own volition wears
large green sequined hair bows and
maroon velour pants. But even I know
that society is just not ready to accept an

individual as a fully functional, dependable contributor to the
general community if
she's got a chicken on her
head. I can understand
this and, therefore, resign
myself to the fact that I
can only feel truly free to

Well, it was pretty apparent to me, as

I'm sure it is to you now, that she was not
truly asking what the object was that she
was pawing. After all, no one else at the
party had asked me what was on my
head, they'd only asked me why it was
there. I mean, it was pretty obvious that
the thing on my head was a chicken and
she was holding its butt.
It is more likely that this woman was

"Well, ever since that homicidal maniac held me and my husband hostage, our

No matter how many times I watch

Yet in movies, it happens all the time.
Case in point Dead Calm, in whichbeing
attacked by a psychopath proves just
what the couple in question needs to get a
little bit closer. It doesn't seem that the
perfect solution to family trauma would
be getting stuck on a sinking ship in the
middleof the ocean,but what do I know?

"exotic" as some would have you
believe. Chen Kaige's direction is frequently derivative (think Kubrick) and
die film is full of extraneous sequences
and pointless set-pieces (again Kubrick).
Set in China from the 1920's up until
1977, it's the story of two actors, Dieyi
and Xiaolao, fated throughout their lives
to play the roles ofConcubine and King
in the opera that gives the film its title. In
order to play therole of the Concubine, so
faithful to her King that she kills herself
rather than be parted from him, Dieyi is
pffpctively stripped ofhis masculinity,

he had no choicebut to
prefer men. He's oblivious to the world outside the stage, and
Xiaolao has to keep
reminding him that
"this is real life, not a
play." The film offers him pity in his
deluded state, but it looks more like contempt to me. How else to explain the way
he standby, clueless, as Xiaolaois beaten
by soldiers, or the way Xialao's pregnant
wife has to wade into the fray to save him
since Dieyi won't She loses thechild
However, the film's insight into
Chinese history is compelling, as it tracks
the changing role opera plays in Chinese
society through several revolutions and a
WorldWar. The opera sequences are fascinating, if not revelatory, and Gong Li
gives a very strong performance as
Xiaolao's wife.

Dead Calm is actually pretty suspenseful for a movie whose outcome is

For a film that split the Palme D'Or at
Cannes, Farewell My Concv&xne is quite
a disappointment neither as original nor

were synonymous with
feebleness, as if once
"turned into" a woman,

would choose to wear a chicken on her
head when she could have chosen a costume from an array of more attractive and
seductive disguises. I could have been a
diva, a Vegas showgirl, or a Dallas
Cowboys Cheerleader, right? I could
have, at the very least, found a more
attractive type of poultry, say a peacock
or a pheasant under glass, to wear on my

head.
Well, if I had not been physically
unable to turn and face this excessively
cleavaged woman due to the razor sharp
pizza box perched precariously at my
neck, my first response to this inquiry
concerning my costume wouldhavebeen
to tell the her that it was theback end of a
chicken with a chronic and highly infectious venereal disease.
But now, as I reflect back upon that
moment there in ML, I think it would
have been much more constructive to
explain to her the true origins of
Halloween and the holiday's relationship
to my disguise. I would tell her that the
reason we dress in disguises on
Halloween is so that when the dead rise
from the bowels of the earth to drag the
living souls back with them into Hell at
theend of the night, they will not recognize us as living souls and will, therefore,
not take us back with them. Thus, I
would explain, if she were a member of
the living undead, who would sherather
drag back with her? A voluptuous young
vixen or a girl with a chicken on her
head? Who, I would ask wantsto spend
eternity with a felt poultry hat and a
woman withunwashed hair?
And then, after calmly imparting all
this information to her, I would tell her

Stargate: Good FX, Poor Plot
It's time for you and I both to see what the editors think I really felt
I'm about to review. You see, last week they felt that
the 2 I gave to New Nightmare really should have been a 4. What are
you gonna do? Let's see what they think I thought of Stargate...
Stargate is a new sci-fi flick that gives us an otherworldly explanation for the origins of ancient Egypt. Well, it does a little more than that,
but that is at the heart of the movie. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is a
young Egyptologist whose ideas are not widely accepted by the boys of
the old guard. He's also, if you believe what the movie shows, the
smartest person this side of Thomas Jefferson. In two weeks he cracks
an ancient hieroglyphic code that activates a stargate to the other side of
the known universe. The project he works for is funded by the military
(and the scientists thought they wouldn't be hassled when the gate was
opened?) so Kurt Russell and a whole
bunch of no-name cannon fodder grunt
soldiers get sent through with Spader to
the other side.
There they find an
oppressed yet lovable people whom they
decide to help against the evil Ra. Ra
(Jaye Davidson) is an alien who has
lived for thousands of years and set up
the Egypt we know on Earth as a source of slaves.
The movie is pretty good. The special effects are some of the best I've
seen in a long time. They alone are worth the price of a student ticket.
The storyline is a little cheesy, but what's wrong with a little aged brie?
The idea at the heart of the movie (a stargate to the other side of the universe where the origins of Egypt are waiting to be explained, etc.) is a
good one, it's just that the characters got a little cliched along the way
(you know, tough-military-guy-with-a-dark-secret, wimpy-scientistwho-becomes-studly, love-interest, child-who-reaffirms-military-guy's
self-confidence, etc.). I have begun to wonder whether Jaye Davidso
will ever be cast as anything but a character who's sexual identity is
more than questionable.
Definitely check this flick out for the special effects, the central idea,
and good performances by Spader and Russell. If Stargate were
Swarthmore student it would be a passing.

Week In Review...

Men's X-

Women's Soccer

Country
Hard training and general fatigue manifestedthemselves in the
Men's Cross-Country team's
lacklustre fourth-place showing at
the Centennial Conference Championships. While Haverford was
the hands-do wn champion, the men
were somewhat suprised to be
soundly beaten by both Gettysburg
and the curiously-fresh Franklin
and Marshall. Senior co-captain
Gene Vann once again led the
charge, audaciously going out with
the big dogs. Despite his efforts,
Vann was unable to stay with his
arch-opponent, the aptly-nicknamed"wombat" of Haverford, yet
he still managed to finish 19th in
the conference in 27:25.
Indeed, virtually every member
of the team felt somewhat "flat"
after a strenuous week of training,
on top of various injuries, illnesses,
late nights, etc. Not too far behind
Vann strode the tightly-knittriangle
formation of JohnKane '95, Steve
Laubach '96, and John Freeman
'96, a pack unfortunately outkicked
by a pair of F&M tools. Kerry
Boeye '97, GrahamLucks '9B, and
Tom Fowler '96, who logged another personal record and finished
higher on the team than ever before, rounded out the top seven.
Freshmen Victor White and Noah
Danielsfinished up their debutseasons with solid performances.
While the centennial results were a
little disappointing, the Harriers intentionally trained through centennials with an intensely -focussed eye
to our most important race of the
season, NCAA regionals, to be held
November 12th at Allentown.This
race will give Swat a good opportunity for some payback, as well as
a chance to qualify for Division HI
nationals. Next week the team puts
into practice Coach Dixon's specialized taper plan, which will
gready facilitate their busting-out
in a relentless, single-minded onslaught on Gettysburg, F&M, and
Allegheny.

Throughout history, humanity
has witnessed many great struggles
and triumphs. However, no struggle
or triumph can compare to the magnificent effort put forth by our very
own Women's Cross CountryTeam
this past weekend in the Centennial
Conference Championship in
Gettysburg.
The sun glittered on marble war
memorials, thegrass was green, and
spirits were high as the GarnetHarriers readied for the test: 3.125 miles
of pure hell. No worries, though:
the Amazons took it all "in stride".
Frosh Danielle Wall placed 10th
overall to lead the Swat pack.
Shoshannah Pearlman,llth, Amy
Klosterman, 13th,Daniela Learner,
17th, Kate Dempsey, 18th, Allison
Schirmer, 40th, and Ingrid Spies,
42nd, rounded out the top seven
Garnetrunners. Despite such strong
efforts, Haverford miraculously
managed to nab second place from
the gamet-haired Swat women, who
placed third out of eight conference

open to make a shot straight past the

Haverford goalie and into the net.
In the second half the team continued its sophisticated level of play,
ending the game with a 1-0 trouncing of the dazed 'Ford soccer program. Swarthmore ends its season
with a 5-12-1 record.

Men's Soccer
Despite all of the hopes for a
climactic end to a bizarre season,
the Men's Soccer team lost its final
game of the season to arch-rival
Haverford. Although the Garnet
once again played with determination, they could neither overcome
Haverford's defense, nor shut down
its offense, and thus succumbed,
losing the game by a final score of
3-1. Looking back on a season filled

teams.

As the wild Amazons prep for
their Regionals in two weeks, they
would like to leave their fans with a
few words: "When [we] race our
minds are full of doubts. Who's
going to come in second? Who's
going to come in third?"

Swarthmore's territory, Arbour
sported her goalie skills by courageously snatching balls from the
feet of Haverford players and shutting down their offense. The only
goal came mid-way through the first
half off an indirect kick from the
left side twenty yards from the net.

Hood Trophy Tradition Continues Through the Years
Swarthmore and Haverford Are Even at 3-3 After the Fall Season
By Matthew Halpern
It has been four years since the
Hood Trophy was last displayed on
Swarthmore's campus. Four painfully long and embarrassing years for
all S watties who take personal pride
in our long-standing rivalry with
Haverford College. As this fall athletic season draws to a close, it appears that Swarthmoreand Haverford
will once again be embroiled in a
neck and neck competition to determine who will earn the rights to this
coveted prize.
The Hood Trophy, a large silver
Revere bowl, serves as a symbol of
the athletic rivalry between
Swarthmore College and Haverford
College. It was given by friends of
Albert L. Hood, Jr. in 1941, in
memory ofhis attempts to revive the
competitive athletic spirit between
the two schools. Each year, the trophy is given to the school whichhas
recorded the greatest numberof victories invarsity competitions.
Albert Hood was one of several
members ofhis family who attended
Swarthmore College. His older sister, also a Swarthmore graduate.

married Merle Miller, a captain of
Haverford's football team, and Hood
was therefore closely tied to the
Haverford College community as
well. Accordingly, Hood was incensed by theofficial discontinuation
of athletic competitions between the
two colleges. He utilized his affiliation with ThePhoenix to promote the
reinstatement of this great rivalry.
As a result of Hood's efforts,
Haverford and SwarthmoreColleges
were eventually reunited in athletic
competitions.
So far this year, Swarthmore and
Haverford are deadlocked at three
wins and three loses apiece in their
bids for the Hood Trophy. Last weekend, Swarthmore's Women's Soccer
team defeated HaverfordCollege 1-0
with a first halfstrike by Bess O'Neill
'95. Swarthmore's Field Hockey
team bested Haverford by a score of
3-0. The Garnet Volleyball team was
also successful in its effort against
the Fords, defeating them in a three
game match, by the scores 15-5,15Country team beat Swarthmore 5015. The Ford's Women's Cross

The Garnet Tide Outlasts
Week
Franklin & Marshall Dips
By Nathan Hegedus
Swarthmore defeated Franklin

Swarthmore's own athletes put themselves
the ultimate test this past Sunday when
competing in the grueling triathlon.The event
comprised of swimming,biking, and running,
and tested the student participants and their
stamina as all-around athletes.
As planned, the participants began their
journey in the water with the 500 yard swim.
After 25 long laps, the athletes made the transition to theirbikes and set outto complete the
9.1 mile cycling course which passed through
Springfield, Wallingford, and Swarthmore.The
final leg of the event consisted of 3.1 mile run
that led the triathletes out of the Crum and up
to the track and the well-deserved finish line.
The top individual finisher was Hunter
Gehlbach '95 with a time of 0:57:47. When
questioned about the event, Huntercommented,
"I had more competition than I could handle
throughout the swimming and cycling portions." The last leg seemed to determine the
outcome of the individualresults as competition spread out. However, only minutes behind Gehlbach Doug Sloane '95 finished with
a time of 1:00:47. Chris Henry '96, 1:07:20,
Jeremy Raich '97, 1:08:02, and Tim Sibley
'98,1:10:12, complete the top five individual
places respectively. The women competitors
of Stacy Nakell '96 and Elizabeth Frost '96
finished with times of 1:18:21 and 1:20:57,
respectively. All of the remaining individual
athletes finished with impressively close times,
reflecting the quality of competition. The
triathlon also had competitors in a team division. The first place team of Andrew Marino
to

Hunter Gehlbach 95 finished
first out of a considerable field of men in the
Swarthmore Triathlon. Although he participated in last spring's triathlon, Gehlbach has
little experience with any of the individual
events. He does, however, play Tennis and
Squash at Swarthmore.
When asked about his expectations for the
triathlon, he simply said, "I went inhoping to
shave a few inches of my beer gut
that's
all." Training was really not a question;
aside from casual athletic activity, Gehlbach
did little to prepare for the event Paul
Wachter explains this phenomenon by saying, "I was not surprised that Hunter won.
His dedication on the tennis court and his
general commitment to physical fitness made
him a shoe in to win the triathlon."

'96, Pete Balvanz '9B, and Kerry Boeye '97
finished in 1:00:54.
Organizers Tom Deak '95, Kristin Waugh
'97, Rob Howell '95, and JohannaPeters-Burton '97 worked hard to assure a smooth and safe
competition. The athletes agreed that the event

Scott Friesen '97,1:12:34, commented, "Your
brain isn't working too well whenyour body is
working that hard."After the initial thought of
"what am I doing to myself?" the athletes
developed their own rhythms and finished
tiredly yet with pride. The sense ofcamaraderie
was unmistakable in this grueling but very
friendly competition.
When asked about his secret to success,
Gehlbach divulged, "My last minute training
consisted of a calorie and carbohydrate laden
drink that my good friend "Mike Shea's" prepared for me." Gahlbach's secret must have
given him the extra energy he needed in the
running section to propel him to the finish. No
matter the preparation, theathletes walked away
from the finish line and collapsed near where
the food and drink was being offered. After
their ordeal, the refreshments were heartily
welcomed.
The brave participants of the triathlon can be
proud of themselves for their small yet significant feat of finishing. When the t-shirts appear
around campus, smile and admire as the athletes display theircourage on their sleeves. As
for the sheer fulfillment of the experience,
Gehlbach comments, "I got all the stomach
cramps I needed for a long time."

record to 3-5 overall and 3-3 in the Centennial
Conference, setting up a duel for third place
with Western Maryland next week.
F&M was winless in the conference coming
into the game as the Garnet Tide looked to
avenge a bitter 18-7 loss last year on a miserable, rainy day. Swarthmore overwhelmed the
Diplomats in the first half, jumping to a commanding 14-0 lead.
Dave Reeser '95 became Swarthmore's alltime leading rusher, surpassing the old mark of
1,886 yards set by Terry White in the late
seventies. His career total is now at 1,952
yards. Reeser finished the day with 102 yards
on 24 carries and two touchdown runs of five
and three yards, making the CentennialConference Honor Role. Reeser is currently the third
leading rusher in the conference this year with
409 yards. Senior offensive lineman Josh
Pearlman said "Dave is a great running back.
After blocking for him for four years, it is nice
to see him break the record." Reeser scored in
the first quarter, to give the Garnet Tide a 7-0
lead. Frank Amar '96 added to the lead with a
15 yard scamper in the second quarter.
Meanwhile, the defense completely stifled
the F&M offense. Linebacker Eric Williams
'95 once again made the Conference Honor
Role for his ten tackle performance. Williams
also forced a fumble, had an interception, and
broke up a pass in the end zone on the last play
of the game. The offensive statistics for the
Dips at half time were almost nonexistent.

On the first possession of the third quarter,
Reeser scored his second touchdownof the day
to put the Garnet up 21-0. The touchdown was
set up by a crucialfake punt that Reeser ran nine
yards for a first down. This touchdown turned
out to be the deciding score and the last one for
Swarthmore.
F&M started to move the baU on the
Swarthmore defense and drove for two late
touchdowns. The Diplomats finished with over
400 yards ofoffense after gaining less than 100
in the first half. The Swarthmore offense finished with 380 yards, with 271 on the ground.
This performance was the secondbest rushing
effort of the year. The offense started to misfire, however, in the second half and failed to
convert on several drives.
On their last possession, theDiplomats completed a couple of long passes to drive to the
Swarthmore ten yard line with less than thirty
seconds left in the game. The F&M quarterback, who finished with 260 yards, took two
shots into the end zone which were both broken
up by the Swarthmore secondary and the Garnet Tide escaped with their third win. Pearlman
said of the finish, "I was left biting my nails on
the sideline at the end of the game. I was
thrilled that the defense pulled it out and prevented them from scoring."
The team was happy with the victory, yet
slightly disappointed that they could not put the
Diplomats away when the chances presented
themselves. The Garnet Tide can't repeat this
performance when the team travels to Western
Maryland to take on the GreenTerrors and their
nationally ranked passing offense this week, in
the last game of the season. Swarthmore looks
to secure at least a tie for third place in the
conference, a winning conference record, and
to avenge yet another bitter loss from last year.

Swat Triathlon Takes Off
By Charity Miller

I

The Swarthmore women ruggers are on
their way to the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby
Union playoffs this weekend after finishing
the regular season in second place with three
conference wins. Their playoff spot was sealed
after an impressive 17-7 victory over Franklin
and Marshall last Saturday.
Last Saturday's win was, to say the least,
amazing. The team traveled to F & M in two
vans and got separated along the way. The
first van arrived in Lancaster with plenty of
time to warm up and to get dressed, but they
were concerned about the second van. As it
turned out, they had every reason to be concerned. The second van was at a toll booth in
the Poconos while half the team was warming
up on thefield. The game was delayed for half

an hour, and thenbegan with Swarthmore fielding only 11 players instead of the usual 15. Of
those, only 5 were A-side players, and some
were injured. The second half of the team
drove in at half time and found that the score
was 5-7, F & M. The impromptu A-side amazingly had held the opposition to only one try.
Swarthmore's usual A-side completely overwhelmed F & M in the second half. The F & M
team was so overwhelmed that they didn't even
invite the Swarthmore players to a post game
party. Andrea Barnett '97, Delta Ruscheinsky
'95, and Kelly Shannon '96 were the backbone
of the team for both halves, playing a fantastic
game.

This Saturday, the Swarthmoreruggers will
play the University of Delaware in the first
round of the playoffs. They will continue to
play throughout the day, until they lose.
