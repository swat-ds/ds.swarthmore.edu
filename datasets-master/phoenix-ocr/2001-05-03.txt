IC director announces resignation
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Anna Maria Cobo has resigned
from her position as assistant dean

and director of the Intercultural Center (IC) in order to act as director of
the Center for Hispanic Excellence at
the University of Pennsylvania, where
she will pursue her Ph.D., researching Latino students.
"It was a very difficult decision,"
Cobo said. "I haven't been job searching it wasn't because I wasn't happy
here at Swarthmore."
Cobo said she got a phone callfrom
UPenn offering to hire her as director
of the center and pay the tuition for
her Ph.D. She could not turn downthe
opportunity, she said.
Her replacement for the 2001-2002
school year will be Meghna Bhagat,
current graduate intern and evening
coordinator of the IC. Bhagat is a
graduate student at Penn. Bhagat will
work as acting director of the ICuntil
a permanent replacement is found.
She will not assume Cobo's position
as associate dean.
Dean of the College Bob Gross said
a search for a permanent IC director
will not begin until a Dean of
Multicultural Affairs has been selected. "We hope to finish the search
[for the multicultural dean]by the end
...

Students, officials

said. The search for a permanent IC director will begin next spring.

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
After two meetings with borough officials and the police chief about complaints of police discrimination, students and deans said they are pleased at the probability of
sensitivity training and better campus-police communication. But, for students involved in the talks, frustration
remains about the borough's opposition to a third-party
investigation as well as the department's sluggishness in

been the IC intern for the
Swarthmore Queer Union (SQU) for
two years, acting as a liaison between
the IC board and SQU board. The IC
comprises SQU as well as the Hispanic
Organization for Latino Awareness
(HOLA), the Native American Student
Association
(NASA)
and
the
Swarthmore Asian Organization
has

(SAO).
Tran did say he was "concerned for
continuity's sake" and hoped the "administration carries through with
promises they made to Anna Maria."
Gross spoke warmly of Bhagat as
well, claiming that she had "earned the
trust and admiration of various
groups" and had "done a lot of programming" during her year at Swarthmore.
Bhagat's work includes development of
"theme nights" at the ICand much planning for this year's first Diversity
Week.
Cobo said she was confident that
Bhagat would have the ability to lead
the IC through important events next
year, such as the 10th anniversary celebration, most of which Cobo has al-

thoroughly investigating the events.
"At the meeting, we really did make a few steps forward," Brandyn White 'O3 said. White is one of five students working with town officials to address the concerns.
"We've come to an understanding, I think, that there is
a general feeling on campus that students were discriminated against in terms of police behavior" threeweeks ago
...

and over the past four years.
Still, White said, "it's understood that both sides are

not going to be satisfied."
Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president for college and community relations, said he had come into the meeting believing it was imperative for the police to "understand that
the perception of students about how they were being
treated is extremely important" and that what happened
on April 9 was unlawful.
But Moriah Radin 'O2, who attends the meetings and
has sought out students' testimonies of perceived police
mistreatment in recent years, said that although she knew
Craig was "concerned about students' perceptions of being
mistreated," shebelieved he was not sure the mistreatment
had actually taken place.
The meetings took place April 19 and 25, and participants included Chief of Police Brian Craig, Mayor Bill
Cumby, Borough Council President Eck Gerner and Council Vice President Ann Seidman.

Admissions choice narrows to two
BY

GABRIEL HETLAND

The search committee for the new dean of admissions
and financial aid has narrowed its search down to two can-

didates. Janet Rapelye, current dean of admissions at
Wellesley College, was on campus Tuesday and Wednesday to chat with students, faculty and staff. Nancy Cable,
current dean of admissions and financial aid at Davidson
College, will come to campus next Wednesday.
Rapelye, the admissions dean at Wellesley for the past
ten years, met with students on Tuesday night. She was very
positive about Swarthmore, saying, "This is one of the treasures in America. There are very few places that have the
statistics Swarthmore has, but it's not just the statistics."
"You all bring something special to this place," she said.
Rapelye said many liberal arts colleges had "silently
applauded" Swarthmore's decision to cut football, recognizing the need to balance the student body within a small
class. She said some colleges in New England have indicated they "wish their schools had the courage to do that."
The candidate addressed many topics in a 90-minute
chat with students, including athletics, financial aid and
ethnic diversity. Rapelye said she understood the concern
that some students voiced thatfinancial aid concerns may

keep some students from applying early decision, for fear
they will lock themselves into an undesirable aid package.
She has released several students from early decision commitments at Wellesley for financial reasons, she explained.
Continuing Swarthmore's commitment to diversity and
multiculturalism were two priorities Rapelye mentioned.She
also commented on the Quaker "ethos" at Swarthmore, a tradition thatshefelt set Swarthmore apart from other colleges.
"This is an extraordinary place," Rapelye said. "I wanted
to look [at the job offer] because opportunities like this don't
come along often."
The search began last September when then-Dean of
Admissions Robin Mamlet left the college for Stanford
University. Since that time, former Director ofAdmissions
Jim Bock '9O has been the acting dean of admissions.
Bock was a candidate for the permanent dean's position but said he was now preparing to move back to being
the director of admissions. "I have absolute respect and
confidence in the committee's abilities," Bock said of the

Five students were also present, four of them from the
Swarthmore African-American Student Society (SASS), as
well as Eldridge, Bob Gross '62 dean of the college, and

selection committee. "They've selected two finalists at the
top of their game."
Bock has worked with the admissions office for six years

Timothy Sams, assistant dean of the college and the director of the Black Cultural Center.
Having specified sensitivity training for officers as one
of their goals, the students were glad that implementation
oftraining seemed likely. "Borough council members were
definitely enthusiastic about sensitivity training," said

but has only been acting dean for the last six months. He
said that the other candidates' greater job experience was
probably the major motivating factor in the committee's
decision.
Maurice Eldridge '6l, the search committee's co-chair and
vice president for college and community relations, said
the committee had a high opinion ofBock. "We admire him

"I have endorsedthe idea of sensitivity training on a
recurring basis," Eldridge said, noting that such training
should be ongoing and not just in response to a specific

tremendously and hold him in the highest regard," Eldridge
said, adding thathe is very pleased Bock will be staying at
the college.
One unique aspect of this search, Eldridge said, was the
use of an outside consulting firm to help the committee
choose candidates. "What some people don't realize," he
said, "is that for this type of position the best candidates
are not found through advertising but must be sought out."
"It's been a long and very thorough process," said Kate
Fama 'Ol, one of two students on the committee. The committee looked over many resumes in their search, she said,
meeting at least once, sometimes twice, each week.
In their search, Fama said the committee sought out
advice from all areas of the college, talking with student
groups, staff members, faculty, the financial aid office and
the president's office. In narrowing down the candidates,
Fama said the committee looked for someone who could
meet the needs of the various groups on campus.
Out of the many resumes, the committee chose ten candidates for follow-up interviews. The committee then selected
Rapelye and Cable, both with extensive experience, to come
to campus and meet with members of the college community.
Eldridge said the committee had hoped to bring candidates here when classes were still in session so that students and faculty could be part of the selectionprocess. He
said he expected the committee to choose a new dean by
the middle of the month.
Bock, who will be in charge of day-to-day operation in
admissions as director next year, said he looks forward to
working with either of the two candidates. His experience
as acting dean has thus far been somewhat stressful but
very rewarding, he said, adding that he is also excited to
be able to be a part of the final interviews for thenew dean.

Arrest made in
assault case

-

Police arrested Hassan West, 21, in Philadelphia Tuesday as a suspect in the April 8 assault en Randy Keim 'O2.
West, a student at Temple University, came under investigation as the result of repeated police interviews with
Swarthmore students. Keim identified West in a photo
spread that the Swarthmore Police Department prepared
for him.
West was arraigned at Media District Court, and bail
was set at $lO,OOO. West posted bail yesterday. No date had
been set for his court hearing as of press time.
Police are still searching for the other two men who allegedly entered Keim's dorm room in Mertz and assaulted
him. Chief Brian Craig of the Swarthmore Police Department said that, although police have leads on the two men,
he doesn't know how productive the investigation will be,
as West appears to be the only assailant Keim can positively identify.

Summer construction work begins
Most renovations to finish by fall, science center work to cause disruptions on campus for next several years
BY JON EHRENFELD

There will be an unusually large
number of construction projects around
the campus this summer. From dorm
renovations to the early construction
stages of the new science center, the college is taking advantage of the summer
break to continue many of its building
plans and begin new ones.
Most of theseplans are scheduled to end
before the next semester begins, but students returning in the fall will still experience several inconveniences due to the

projects.
The largest and most visible of these
is the construction around DuPont. So far,

several trees have been uprooted and
transplanted in preparation for more extensive work this summer.
The math wing and the lecture hall
will be demolished in the fall, and, this
summer, underground utilities for the
new portions of the building will be installed. The new science center is scheduled to be completed in 2005. Over the
next few years, construction will occur
from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m.

Inconveniences, relocations
The college community will have to
deal with the noise, mud and inconveniences the work site will create. The fac-

ulty, staff, and students in buildings at the
especially near
north end of campus
DuPont
will have to "deal with a lot of
noise," said Vice President of Facilities
Larry Schall. Students and faculty will
have to cope with the sight of the construction of what Schall called "the biggest
[construction] project in a long time."

Some of the students who may be affected the most next year are those living
in Woolman, which is located north of
DuPont. Most students, however, do not
seem overly concerned, as there will be

new entrances to DuPont, and the trip to
campus won't be noticeably lengthened.
"We thought Woolman would be the
bomb, so we decided to go for it in spite of
the construction," Edwin Nam 'O4 said,
"I'm hoping it won't be too bad
I'll be
able to get around it."
Math and statistics students will feel
the most direct effects because of the destruction of the current math department
wing. The department will not be left
homeless, however, as it will relocate off
campus. The college is turning two private
residences, three and five Whittier Place,
into space for the department.
...

Renovation of the houses will provide
room for classes, seminar rooms and of-

fices for the professors. For convenience, a
link between the two houses will bebuilt. The
new department will be only about 250 feet
beyond Papazian. The college is storing the
doors and other elements of the houses, so
they can be restored as private residences
when the math department leaves, Jan
Semler of Facilities said.
In Semler's opinion, students and faculty
will be "minimally inconvenienced by the
move." On campus, there are mixed reactions
to the department's relocation to Whittier
Place, but in general there is a favorable impression. "Well, visually, Whittier place will
be nicer, because DuPont is ugly," said James
Zvokel 'O4. "Also, that walk isn't that big a

deal."
Other students' concerns are focused the

location, however. Math student Lela Patrik

'O4 said the change would be "more inconvenient and may prevent students from seeking
the professors' help, because they won't be as
accessible."
The faculty echo some of these views. In
general, they have been very enthusiastic

about the relocation. Professor Deborah
Bergstrand voiced her support of the move,
which she termed an adventure. "I'm excited
about it," she said, "[to] the extent that the
entire science center project is exciting."
Although she voiced some concerns that students might not visit professors as often, she
did not think that would happen too much.
Professor Aimee Johnson had similar
views of the move, saying "I'm really looking forward to being in Whittier Place." Both
indicated they were looking forward to the
perquisites of a house having kitchens and
a lounge area, for example.

Summer dorm constructions
Other construction projects will occur this
summer but will be complete by the timestudents return to campus in the fall. Some of

these include the renovation of the Mertz
bathrooms and the installation of sprinklers
in PPR and Mertz.

The recent underground construction on
the Mertz lawn of the past few weeks is now
nearly finished. Workers were installing a
water pipeline for the separate water supply
needed for new fire sprinklers.
The installation of the sprinklers in
Mertz and PPR, as well as the renovations
to Mertz, have brought up some concerns
that there will be less student storage space

available this summer. The Mertz renovations will begin once the construction crew
working on the Intercultural Center finishes. Workers will renovate all of the bathrooms and move the first floor laundry
room to the basement. According to Alice
Balbierer of Facilities, this will make the

bathrooms accessible to the handicapped.
Balbierer said she did not see the renovations as significantly taking away from storage space. If space were to lessen at all, she
said, it would be "very slightly."
Director of Facilities Management Stuart
Hain said that, during the summer while the
construction was taking place, there would be
locked storage trailers at Mertz and PPR for
student use. Once the construction is complete, Hain said, there will be "very little storage space lost to the sprinkler installation."

Along with the major projects, there
are several smaller ones which will also
be completed this summer. By the beginning of next semester, the Swarthmore
College Computer Society (SCCS) will be
fully settled in the basement of Tarble, in
the space that was once the game room.
In addition, Worth is receiving new furniture, and work is being done in the
lobby of the Lamb-Miller Fieldhouse. All
of these projects are slated finish by the
end of August.

Intercultural Center renovated to create additional space
BY JON EHRENFELD
Construction on the Intercultural Center began Tuesday
to make renovations that will accommodate the center's recent expansion. The Intercultural Center (IC) is home to four
support groups. Work will continue for approximately six

more weeks.
The students and administration who work in the IC have
found the existing space there insufficient. According to Assistant Dean and Director of the Intercultural Center Anna
Maria Cobo, the IC "has grown tremendously, more so in
the last two years."
In addition to the expansion for current groups such as
HOLA and SQU, room must be made for a group that has
formed since the IC was built

MAY 03, 2001

the Native American Stu-

THE PHOENIX

dents Association (NASA).
The construction will take place in the north part of the
IC. The handrail above the large room will break open, and
a second floor will be constructed. The lower part will remain mostly the same and will still accommodate large
numbers of people.

The upper level is where most of work will take place.
When it is finished, there will be an office for Administrative Assistant Sheila Gonzalez, new bookcases, a library
and computer terminals. The library, which will be organized by librarians Pam Harris and Donny Smith, will be
searchable through the Tripod catalogue. There is a second phase of the construction, slated to take place a few
years from now, that would open up the attic of the IC and
create a connection to Clothier.

Although most of the members of the IC are enthused
about the construction because of the increased space and
resources that will be made available, some have lamented
the fact that the visually pleasing "big room" willbe altered.
It "might kill the aura that the building has right now," William Tran 'O3 said. Cobo noted that it might "take a lot of the
aesthetics away."
The IC construction is beginning now because the academic year is ending, and student groups will not have as
much need for the space. "I don't think it's going to interrupt any organizational stuff," Tran said. When students
return to school next year, the IC will be completed.
For students involved in the IC, it will be "the main place
where [they] can share their resources," Cobo said.

Spring calendar unchanged for 2001-02
BY IVAN BOOTHE
The Curriculum Committee
decided at its meeting yesterday
not to adopt either of the proposals to alter the spring schedule at
Swarthmore. After rejecting two
alternate plans, the committee decided to direct the Committee on
Faculty Procedures (COFP) to appoint a task force to deal with the
issue again next year.
Last week, Registrar Martin
Warner sent a straw poll via e-mail
to faculty and students, detailing

the scheduling options and soliciting opinions (see results, right).
"The difficulty we have to

deal withhere is the honors program," said English professor
Craig Williamson, chair of the
curriculum committee. In the
current schedule, spring classes
run for 14 weeks (unlike the 13week fall schedule). The finals
schedule consists of five days of
a "reading period," eight days of
course and honors written exams and three days of honors
oral exams. No examinations are
scheduled on Sundays. Eight
days after the final oral honors
examination is commencement,
which falls on June 4 this year.
"There's a general feeling on
the part of the faculty that, because graduation comes so late,
we want to find a model that

would shorten the term by one
week," Williamson said. Some
colleges graduate up to three
weeks earlier than Swarthmore.
The first plan proposed was
to shorten the class schedule
from 14 weeks to 13, mirroring
the length of the fall semester.
The finals schedule would remain the same length, and commencement, under this proposal,
would fall one week earlier.

The second alternate option
was to preserve the full 14-week
term but condense the finals period. Written course exams would
remain at eight days, but written
honors exams wouldbe shortened
to six days. Reading period would
be shortened to four days, and
there would be only two days for
oral examinations.
"The curriculum committee
talked at great length about the
polls," Williamson said. "The

various faculty votes in committee and the strawpoll showed that

there was not a large majority
supporting any of the options."
Williamson hopes that the
new task force will be able to
find a schedule that will place
graduation earlier, "while maintaining the quality of education
and not increasing the stress levels on students or faculty."
When the task force has come
up with a plan "that has more support," Williamson said, the model
will be brought before thecurriculum committee. If that committee
and the COFP both approve it,
then it would go to the Board of
Managers for final approval.
Williamson is not sure, however, that the ideal solution will

be found. "We've worked on this
in curriculum committee for
two years," he said, "and we
haven't found it."

Living wage campaign meets with board
BY ELIZABETH HANSEN
As 50 Harvard students protesting for a "living
wage" for Harvard University staff enter the second week ofa sit-in, Swarthmore's Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign is continuing its own push
for improved staff compensation. Members of the
campaign have drafted a letter to the Board of Managers and are meeting with them tomorrow.
Sam Blair 'O2, a leader of the Swarthmore campaign, compared the two campaigns this way:
"We're in a different place than they are." The
Harvard campaign began two years ago and has
widespread support from the city of Cambridge,
which has a "living wage ordinance."

This Friday, the Swarthmore campaign will make
a presentation to the Board of Managers' Committee on Social Responsibility.
The campaign has drafted
a letter to all the members
of the committee describing
some of the issues surrounding the campaign and
outlining its goals.
The letter also states the
campaign's dual objectives

for the meeting. "First, we
would like you to get back
to us with questions you
would need to see answered in order to be con-

The Swarthmore administration, campaign
said, has been aware of the press that the
Harvard sit-in is getting.
The administration at Harvard, Blair said, has
been continually reluctant to address anything
about the issue. Mattie Weiss 'Ol, a participant in
the Swarthmore campaign, explained that a
Swarthmore, where thereisbetter communication
between the administrationand the students, there
is no need for the Harvard students' tactics.
While the strategies of the two campaigns are
different, Blair pointed out that "our principal
values are the same."
Weiss thinks the positive attention receivec
by the Harvard sit-in has helped to shift the opin
ion of some Swarthmore students. "I think there
is a feeling at Swarthmore that [our campaign
was an out-there cam
paign, that we were re
ally pushing the limits,
she said. The publicity
surrounding Harvard's
campaign, Weiss said
"made us look a lot les
radical, and I think here
that's a good thing."

vinced to support the living wage principle and to
set up mechanisms to figure out how it could be
Paid for," it states. "Second, we would like you to
find room at your next meeting to continue the dialogue and discussion with us, allowing time at that
Meeting for some give and take."

Sharpies 111 will be renamed to honor art history professor
BY HOFAN CHAU

The Student Art Association (SAA) will
dedicate the space previously known as
Sharpies 111 to art history professor T. Kaori
Kitao today, in recognition ofher role in bring-

ing art to the forefront of the college. Kitao
will retire at the end of the semester.
"She deserves it," saidBrandon Silverman 'O2,
president of SAA. "Of all the professors I have
ever met, none [has] even come close to commanding the respect and friendliness [that] the
entire campus seems to show for Kitao."
"Getting resources [for this dedication] was
the easiest thing in my life," Silverman said.
"Everyone said, 'We want to get involved!'"
Professor Michael Cothren of the art department thought it was especially fitting that the

Unlike some other colleges, Swarthmore has a single department tha
encompasses both art history and studio arts. "When I came, the art depart
ment was art history," Kitao said. "Studio work was extra-curricular and no
credit. It was regarded as amateurish even though the efforts were not.
"It has been an upstream effort to convince the college of the seriousnes
ofart," Kitao said.
Chair of the art department Brian Meunier said thatKitao's contribution
is "almost limitless" in this respect. "Over the years, she's been an advocate
for art," he said. "In so many public venues, she's articulated the need for
studio art on this campus."
"If I had the power," Kitao said, "I would require all college students to
have one studio art and one art history [course]. It helps us learn better
because it teaches us to see clearly, intensely and systematically."
In a "Friends ofArt" newsletter, art professor Randall Exon described the
annual ritual in which faculty chairs, in alphabetical order of their depart
ment, would introduce a new faculty member. "Kaori would stand, wait in
silence, wait some more, and then, in a stentorian voice of declaration, she
would say: art... art... Art... ART!" he said.
"Since this is the only time art ever comes first at Swarthmore College,'
Exon said of the dedicated space, "I want to take full advantage of the moment.
"She has a virtually encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject matter she
teaches," Samuel Sadow 'O3 said, 'and is an expert at taking extremely complex
ideas and communicating them to the class in a way that is fairly easy to grasp.'
"[Kitao] has incredible breadth. I think that this is something you rarely
find in professor nowadays, especially in art history," Nicole Bensoussan '0
said. "She also really encouraged independent thought... it's a really consis
tent strand in her thinking to probe the visual evidence." Having taken Kitao's
class as a freshman, Bensoussan said the insight she gained from Kitao was
an important factor in helping her decide to major in art history.
"Knowing starts from perception," Kitao said. "People say, 'I don't know
much about art but I know what I like.' [But] when you know, you like better
Appreciating art requires effort. One has to constantly learn."
Her colleagues also mention the impact Kitao has on them. "I have ha(
the most enlightened discussions [with Kitao]," Meunier said. "We would
leave the conversation feeling high. I'll miss that personally
she drops
these little pearls and it's like seeds that grow in me."
"She's been a model of what liberal arts educators can be," Cothren said
"Her teaching is like juggling... because it's elegant, exciting and keeps sev
eral objects of study in perfect co-ordination."
During her 35 years of teaching, Kitao has designed a number of new courses
She introduced the study of film, urban history and theory in a course called "The
City" in the 19605, and technology and culture in her course "Everyday Things."
"The institution has been very supportive [of] non-traditional courses,'
Kitao said. "I can create [a] new course at whim and teach it the way I want
...

That is a blessing."
According to Cothren, Kitao has also been very involved in the architecture
ofthe college. She was convinced, he said, that "buildings frame the way people
interact, and she wanted to make sure human interaction at Swarthmore was
framed in a productive way, both intellectually and socially." Kitao helped selec
the architect for both the Lang Music Building and Kohlberg Hall.
"It will be nice to concentrate on one job instead of two," she said of her
retirement, explaining that an academic career involves the dual roles of teach
like graduation, mar
ing and scholarship. "It is a major time in a life cycle
riage, the death of one's parents and beloved... in many ways I feel exhausted.'
Kitao said she will miss teaching, although she will enjoy the freedom o
being able to travel at a moment's notice. "As a born ham, I'm going to lose
my natural audience," she lamented. In looking back, she says that her 35
years at the college were a great education.
"There is no better way to learn than teaching," she said.

Student Council discussed ways to improve the safe use of
alcohol on campus at its Monday meeting. Some members believed the lack of parties funded by the Social Affairs Committee (SAC) has been a problem, and others suggested organizing an "alcohol workshop" in order to promote responsible

position at UPenn
From COBO, pg. 3
According to those who have worked with her, Cobo
has left a strong legacy that will allow the center to
remain an important resource as the college seeks
to maintain high ethnic and social diversity in its
student population.
"She directed the Intercultural Center during a period ofconsiderable growth and dynamism," Gross said.
During her time here, Cobo has "developed each
of the constituent groups" as well as "kept the center open to the rest of the campus," Gross said, adding that she had also helped form a new group, NASA,
with Stacey Wagaman 'OL
SAO intern Cathy Ta 'O3 credited Cobo with "never
being afraid to discuss, evaluate and reform," highlighting the development of Diversity Week as an example. Attendance at open IC events had been low, Ta
said, and the weeklong series of events "increase[d]

education and awareness on campus."
Cobo was the first IC director to build connections
with Swarthmore graduates, arranging for
Swarthmore graduates to speak and publishing an
alumni newsletter. Cobo also worked with students
to revise the IC constitution and develop lecture and
leadership series last year.
She credited much of her success to the "passion,
leadership, activism, and ability to create" of her students as well as support from Gross and President Al
Bloom, who founded the Intercultural Center in 1992.

drinking by students.
One of the main problems with alcohol on campus this semester, campus life representative Lauren Tobias 'O2 said, has
been a perceived increase in dorm room drinking, likely due
to a smaller number of SAC-funded parties. This produces
more dangerous situations, as people who may be experiencing alcohol poisoning are in a more isolated setting rather
than in the company of a large group of students.
The council pointed to the lack of a Student Activities Coordinator, a ban on alcohol at Delta Upsilon fraternity parties
this past year, and the college's somewhat stricter stance on
alcohol this semester as possible causes for the decrease of
SAC-funded parties.
The council also considered the difficulties in coordinating and throwing a SAC party and discussed suggestion to
alleviate some of the pressure placed on students to throw
parties.
"After throwing a SAC party last weekend, I've realized
what a hellish experience it is," Student Budget Committee

Treasurer Marvin Barron 'O2 said. Aside from the usual difficulties in coordinating and planning, Barron said that some
people are "just mean." During the course of the evening, he
said, students stole his blender, and he also prevented the robbery of a keg.
Though SAC currently allocates money to students and
groups who want to throw campus-wide parties, it does little
to facilitate the actual coordination of these parties, leaving a
heavy burden on students to coordinate and host them volun-

tarily.
In order to encourage more SAC-funded parties next year,
Sara Edelstein 'O3 suggested creating a special subcommittee
of SAC that would help with the planning and production of
SAC funded parties. The subcommittee would include both
SAC members and council members.
Tobias suggested hosting a SAC orientation at the begin-

ning of each semester to give students hints on how to throw
a successful party, reserve campus space, advertise, and locate the necessary equipment.
"Many students are not aware that anyone can write a
party proposal
an individual, a group of friends or a stu-

dent organization," Tobias said in an interview. "An orientation would help to show students what elements are necessary for a good proposal, and how to go about getting the necessary campus resources."
A new Student Activities Coordinator is also in the process of being hired, she said, and is scheduled to begin working this summer.
In addition to the lack of SAC-funded parties this semester, the council discussed the concern that freshman enter
Swarthmore with little or no experience with alcohol and begin to think it's normal to drink in dorm rooms.
Tobias said that at the Deans' Advisory Committee meeting, "The administration's impression is that students come
[here] naive and need a bad experience to let [them] know
what alcohol is."
Many council members felt an alcohol workshop, similar
to the current Acquaintance Sexual Assault Prevention workshop freshmen attend during orientation, would be a good idea
for incoming students, though council members were unsure
as to when and how the workshop should take place.
Currently, Residential Assistants are encouraged to hold a
special hour-long workshop focusing specifically on alcohol,
but not all RAs actually hold one, and many freshmen pass
through orientation without any focused education on alcohol.
Tobias was skeptical about holding another workshop dur-

ing freshman orientation, citing the plethora of meetings freshmen are already required to attend. "We might not want to do
too much in too little time," she said.
College Planning Committee representative Jordan

Brackett 'Ol offered additional doubts about the effectiveness
of such a workshop at some point during the first semester of
freshman year. "The only way to truly understand the effects
of alcohol is to experience them first-hand," he said.
Overall, the council felt the formalization of such a workshop into the activities for freshmen was a good idea.
"Our hope is that this workshop would serve a number of
functions," Tobias said. "It wouldalert freshmen to the amount
of alcohol that can be reasonably consumed without becoming ill. It would give students a chance to hear upperclassmen's
actual experiences with alcohol, [and] perhaps they would be
likely to trust the advice given to them by older Swatties."
Though nothing was finalized, the council said they would
continue to investigate the possibility of increasing the number of SAC-funded parties and improving student awareness
about the effects of alcohol.

Students clear some hurdles in police talks, frustration remains
From SASS, pg. 3
Delonte Gholston 'O2, who attended the
meetings, said the students hoped for training every two years! The department did
undergo such training once about a decade
ago.
Craig and the borough council members
were supportive of learning about students' experiences with the police, White

said. Eldridge said Cumby "asked

if he
could have copies of [the testimonies]."
The students have requested that
Craig meet with SASS, which Radin said
he as "definitely willing" to do. Gholston
noted that Ann Seidman "recommended
that the borough review ways to combat
disparate treatment of students and

issues."

Despite these points of progress, the
students involved are frustrated about the
delay in the department's examination of

the case, which has prevented Craig from
drawing any conclusions about his officers' behavior April 9.
"They have yet to give us a police report," White said. "I think it's unaccept-

able." She noticed that the incidents under investigation occurred over three
weeks ago.
Craig said he was still researching the
case. "Right now, I'm in the process of interviewing some of the students that were

involved," he said, explaining that he had
called about eight students and only two had
responded.
"I wouldn't do anything to make them talk
to me. All I can do is leave messages and ask
that they respond," Craig said. "I'm just not
ready to draw any conclusions yet until I've
heard everything everyone had to say."
Craig said there was also considerable difficulty in investigating students' testimonies
claiming discrimination at the hands of the
police years ago. Students presented him with
these statements at the second meeting. "Some
of them I don't believe happened in
Swarthmore," he said.
As the case remains in limbo, some students are irritated by the seeming impossibility of the department in admitting to having done anything wrong.
"A public apology is definitelyneeded right
now," White declared, and said that SASS had
asked the department to give one. Radin also
said she wanted a "face-to-face apology to the

students."
Craig said, however, that the students had
not asked him for an apology.
Radin described the current situation as
"difficult to reconcile
they say one thing,
we say another." For this reason, students
have suggested a third-party investigation,
but Gholston described the mayor's reaction to such a suggestion as "strongly op...

posed."

"The mayor feels that's not

something he

believes is necessary," Radin said. She said
this came out of "the basic feeling that... we
believe our students are truthful, and they believe their officers are truthful."
Craig said it would "really be difficult to
find someone that would be agreeable to all
the parties" in terms of bias, as a third-party
investigator. White mentioned the ACLU
and the NAACP as possible sources to contact.

The students also recommended some kind
of on-campus mechanism to ensure that students' complaints about the police would be

heard and to "talk and keep things moving,"
Eldridge said. The department, he said,
seemed fully amenable to the idea.
Gholston said such a committee would
serve to ensure that "students have a place to
go to make sure their issues are addressed."
Craig said he has actively sought to open
lines of communication between the police

and the college throughout his
time here, meeting with Student Council twice
to discuss the possibility. Better campus-police dialogue has never seemed like a real possibility until now.
"Anybody can come to the police station
and tell us about something they're not
happy about," Craig said. Now, however, students are looking to establish "regular meetings" and "a better dialogue" between themdepartment

...

selves and officers.
He pointed out that, even after the events
ofApril 9, "nobody actually filed a complaint"

or came to the police department.
As far as increasing communication between students and officers, "that's something I've been trying to do for years,"
Craig said. "It seems like it takes a major
incident to bring the topic up." Eldridge
said the administration was "wide open"
to the possibility.
Craig has recently compiled recordings of the radio interaction among police officers for the night of April 9. Students who met with the police and town
officials hope to hear them next week.
Craig said the tapes were open to the
public and that he was "not going to edit
anything out."
Another possibility, Gholston said, is to
"amend [freshman] orientation" to include
"addressing issues of police discrimination" or to include those issues in the Acquaintance Sexual Awareness Program
and diversity workshops.
The meetings were "by and large respectful," as Eldridge put it. White said the
students had to "maintain a certain level
of diplomacy." Gholston said what had

"best characterized our discussions was
candor."
"People are willing to say what they
need to say," Radin said. "It's had its heated
moments, but I don't think anyone's lost
control."
A final meeting for the school year is
scheduled for next Wednesday, May 9.

Innis urges black Americans to vote Republican
BY IVAN BOOTHE
"Amongst the major groups in this country, ethnic or
regional, blacks are the only ones to practice one-party
politics in a two-party America." Roy Innis penned this
statement in 1984, on the cusp of the Reagan-Mondale presidential campaign. Since then, his opinion ofblack politics
in America has not changed, and Monday night Innis, a
writer and civil rights activist, spoke with a group of

Swarthmore students about his concerns.
Beginning with a briefoverview of the political history
of the United States from the Civil War, Innis noted that
when he asks many people which party Abraham Lincoln

belonged to, they invariably
tell him, "Democratic." Lincoin, in fact, was the first
president elected as a Republican, a party that was
founded in 1856. They identify Lincoln's party incorrectly, he said, because they
identify him with the end of
slavery, and they identify
civil rights with the Democratic Party.
"This rejection of the Republican Party," he said, "is
due to an ignorance of how we got here."
Throughout the last half of the 19th century and the first
quarter of the 20th century, blacks voted nearly 95 percent
Republican. Innis said the cause of this trend was their
gratefulness to the party that had freed blacks from slavery and was responsible for the passage Of the 13th, 14th
and 15thamendments to the Constitution.
In 1877, however, the Republican candidate for president, Rutherford B. Hayes, "sold out" blacks, Innis said,
in the infamous Hayes-Tilden compromise. "Republicans
realized that he who gets the majority of the black vote
loses the majority of the white vote," Innis said. "They
decided that they didn't want to be the party of the black
man."
Republicans thus began to distance themselves from
issues important to blacks. Despite this, Innis said, blacks
continued to vote Republican. "Blacks who didn't," he said,

crat-controlled."
In addition, he said, Republicans have been in power more
often, which supplied his second argument for blacks voting
for the GOP.
"There is something patently stupid for us to more often
be on the losing side," he said. And in 1984, Innis wrote that
voting Republican "would help to preserve progressive Republican legislators, who are now an endangered species
and it will slow the drift of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the country to the radical right." While Democrats take blacks for granted, Innis said, Republicans have no
reason to pay attention to them, since they know they will not
obtain a significant portion of their vote.
In the last presidential election, Innis said, every other political group split its vote between
and thus had influence over

"were 'class traitors.'"
"With the memory ofLincoln congesting their heart and
brain, black folks maintained an inflexible, monolithicand
neurotic attachment to the Republican Party up to 1928,"
Innis wrote in his 1984 article, "Why We Must Desegregate
the Republican Party."
When Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran, however, blacks
realized "that we had found our messiah," Innis said. By
Roosevelt's second term, nearly all blacks were voting
Democratic, and they never lookedback. Reverence for Lincoln was supplanted by loyalty to FDR and fidelity to his

party.
"The tyranny of the one-party strategy, with its tactical
inflexibility, was reimposed on the black community by
many of the same bunch of bankrupt leaders of black
America," Innis wrote. This "psycho-historical trauma,"
he said, plagues blacks to this day. "When we turned the
corner, we exhibited the same monolithic stupidity," he
said.
Innis said there are two reasons that more blacks should
vote for the Republican Party. First, he said the Democratic
Party has not upheld the promises it has extended to blacks.
Because blacks vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, the
Party has taken them for granted, he said, and has no reason to deal with their issues. Innis pointed out that, after
the last presidential election, districts in which disenfranchisement ofblacks allegedly took place were "all Demo-

both major parties.
Catholics, he said, voted 50
percent for each; Hispanics voted
one-third Republican. Forty-five
percent of Asians favored Bush,
as did forty percent of women.
Jews voted a surprising 20 percent Republican, and one-quarter
of homosexuals and Democrats
voted for Bush. "Blacks were the
only group to vote so strongly to one side," he said.
"Jewish leaders know that they need to communicate with
both parties," Innis said. There are enough Jewish members
of the Republican Party, he explained, that they can influence
the Republican platform and push for issues important to
them. In fact, he said, "I don'tbelieve there is even much communication between Republicans and the few Republican
blacks."

Innishas been involved in civil rights issues since the 1960s
as a part of the civil rights movement. He is currently the
chairman of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE), a notfor-profit corporation founded in 1942 thatworks against prejudice based on race, sex, age, disability, sexual orientationand

religion.

It is the only civil rights organization in the United States
to have non-governmental consultative status in the United
Nations, and representatives of CORE sit on the U.N.'s Department ofPublic Information and the Economic and Social

Council.

With Innis at the talk on Monday was his son, Niger, who
is currently the national spokesman for CORE. Roy and Niger
Innis proceeded to take questions from the audience.

Rajaa Shakir 'O4 asked whether dividing the black vote
would really be useful. "It doesn't seem productive to split the
black vote between the two parties," she said, "instead of collectively deciding on one candidate or the other."
"We're always being isolated," Roy Innis responded. "It
does not do anything for us when the isolation is on the losing
side." In 1984, when Ronald Reagan was nearly certain to be
elected to a second term, Innis wrote, "The Democrats are
doomed; why should we go down in defeat with them?"
"I still don't see why we should change our votes to reflect
mainstream America," Shakir said.
Niger Innis had an answer. "The problem was not so much
the overwhelming vote, but why," he said. If it had been because of the issues, he said, it would have been all right. Instead, "blacks were the victims of raw and racial demagoguery."
Campaigns waged by white political leaders and many
black leaders were "appealing to blacks in a racist way." Niger
Innis singled out an NAACP ad that depicted the tragedy of
James Byrd 111, who was dragged to death behind a truck in
Texas two years ago. "They ran the ad to inflame racial tensions," he said, and "suggested that Bush was a racist, which

The media, Roy Innis said, only exacerbates the situation. "The media allows only the emanations of Al Sharpton
and Jesse Jackson," he said.
"What exactly in the Republican Party is beneficial to
us?" Dale Jennings 'O4 asked. "I thought it was why we
should join the Republican Party, not why we shouldn't be

Democrats."
"Because," Niger Innis said, "George W. Bush wants to
challenge the educational establishment." Roy Innis added
that "black Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of

this."
Republicans, Niger Innis said, have "been incompetent"
advertising these issues to blacks. "It has been a terrible
campaign by the Republicans," he said.
When Matt Rubin 'O3 asked about the two men's opinions on affirmative action, Roy Innis said simply, "I hope
it goes away." He said the two of them were in favor of
economic affirmative action, based on income only. "Anyone can be poor," Roy Innis said, "white or black."
Even ifthe Republican Party platform is not completely
in-line with most blacks, Roy Innis said, it is still prudent
for more blacks to have influence over the party. "If we
hate the sons-of-bitches, then we should join them," he said.
As it stands now, blacks are irrelevant to both parties, he
said.

"Every time there's a political issue," Niger Innis said,
"you just trot out the blacks. We're a political bludgeon for

someone else's game.
"Do you want to haveinfluence over their ideas?" Niger
Innis asked. "The black vote would become more real," he
said, "especially because ofthe fact that you might lose that
vote."

LETTER
Overcoming the
uncomfortable end
Ends are always uncomfortable.
Right now, I'm very uncomfortable. I'm allergic
to every tree on campus. Deadline is less than an
hour away. And with this issue, my two-year
tenure as editor in chief of The Phoenix will come
to an end.
As a journalist, endings are somewhat foreign to
me. The news never stops
each day, each week is
both a new issue and the same issue at once, a
chance to correct mistakes and to create anew.
Trying to say something final is terrifically
frightening.

Intimidated by the prospect of writing about my
I stayed up late Tuesday night
reading the farewell letters of the past four editors
ofThe Phoenix. Although much of what they wrote
resonated with me as a fellow editor, each editor
wrote with a tone of relief at throwing off the
burden that is The Phoenix. Amidst nervous
breakdowns and plummeting grades, this ending
was freedom.
But I ain't going out like that.
At some point during my years of editorial
service, The Phoenix set me free. Just as I became
part of The Phoenix, The Phoenix became part of
me, part of my identity. Although I still work 30
hours to 40 hours a week on The Phoenix, those
hours are mine. I serve by choice, because I love it.
I wouldn't trade that time for anything in the
world.
With The Phoenix, I have chosen the constraints
the rules, the expectations and the rewards
within which I work. I have made a commitment
and made it uniquely mine. I often wonder if I will
ever have an opportunity as pure as this again.
Within the world I have embraced as mine, I am
free.
This, I suppose, is the kind of end with which
I'm at home that is to say, the end as a worthy,
meaningful purpose. For the past two years, The
Phoenix has been part of the focus I have brought
to the world in order to discover and illuminate
meaning in it, to paraphrase philosopher David
Wiggins. In the confusion and chaos that is modern
life, my choice and commitment has helped me
create, find and continually revise meaning.
More professors and friends than I can count
have openly wondered why I spend so much time
on The Phoenix. This is my answer to them: I love
it/it is meaningful to me/it is part of me. Still, some
have subtly encouraged me to quit; others have
outright recommended it. Next year, they will have
their wish.
But I'm leaving on my own terms. Rather than
quitting abruptly, I'm fading ever-so-slowly into the
background ofThe Phoenix, slouching toward
very discomfort,

graduation.
More importantly, I know I am leaving behind a
staff that loves The Phoenix as much as I do, that it
is committed to The Phoenix as I am. I know they
will find it as beautiful and pure and meaningful as

I have.
So when I walk down Magill Walk and back to
my room Wednesday night for the finaltime as
editor in chief of The Phoenix, there will be a
bounce in my step and tears in my eyes, for I shall
know, as Jack London did, that this is part of "the
most exquisite pitch of joy and happiness to which
life could thrill."

Cincinnati riots are justified reaction to years of racism
Dear Editor:

Riots by definition step over "the bounds of civility," as
"civility" is usually defined by the power structure against
which rioters are rebelling. In response to the recent Phoenix references to "riots" in David Haendler's "Blacks and
Republicans: a necessary marriage" (April 19) and in the
Phoenix staffs "Living loud" (April 26), I would like to point
out the lack of what I consider to be integral historical and
political context.

The Seattle riots of 1999 and the recent Cincinnati riots
were both direct responses to police treatment, first and foremost. In an editorial last week in support of the Harvard
living wage sit-in, The Phoenix opined that while there were
substantive issues at stake in the Seattle World Trade Organization protests, the resulting riots stepped "over the line
of civility."
What The Phoenix neglected to mention is that long before protesters stepped over that line, cops had clubbed and
beaten people participating in civil disobedience and discharged pepper spray and rubber bullets into crowds participating in completely legal, peaceful protest. The Seattle
police displayed a brutality that was absolutely unnecessary. If the WTO protests turned into riots, it was because
of police treatment of protesters, not because of the
protester's own conduct.
Substantially more problematic, however, is Haendler's
piece with its racial overtones. In addition to my overall
disagreement with Haendler's central idea, I take particular offense at his characterization of the anti-police brutality riots in Cincinnati. In reference to cities thathave worked
to improve relations between police officers and communities of color, Haendler writes that the "people of Cincinnati
would be well-advised to heed that example and try to open
up a constructive dialogue before they reach for their crowbars." This portrayal of the Cincinnati riots is both irre-

sponsible and misinformed. It characterizes the city's unrest as an ahistorical, ridiculous and unmerited outburst.
Everything would have been better, Haendler suggests, if only
people ofcolor in Cincinnati had tried to dialogue with their
police department about police treatment of minority popu-

lations.
Riots are not spontaneous. While they may appear so to
the outside viewer, riots are generally the result of a pattern-culminating catalyst. Citizens ofCincinnati did not simply "reach for their crowbars." For years, advocates in urban centers around the country have been trying to improve
relations between police and communities ofcolor (for their
safety, if not for love of the cops). How dare Haendler criticize the riots while neglecting to mention what provoked
them the fact that Cincinnati police have killed 15 black
men in the last six years.
The media has a long history of portraying riots, and especially riots in which most of the participants are people of
color, as unjustified violent outbursts. They are, indeed, violent outbursts. They are by no means unjustified. In 1968,
after three years of investigation, the presidential Kerner
Commission determined that segregation and poverty were
the primary causes of the 1965 Watts Riots. The day after the
riots in 1965, newspapers ran the headline, "Family Life
Breakdown in Negro Slums Sows Seeds of Race Violence."
That is to say, the riots were seen as a result of the poor moral
character of inner-city poor blacks, not as a result of racist
political and economic systems.
Riots are not a productive means of social change. They
are, however, generally expressions offrustration at an oppressive situation. Neither Seattle nor Cincinnati came out
of nowhere. To portray these events as spontaneous or even
"over the line of civility" while neglecting to talk about the
issue of police brutality is politically and historically wrong.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Extend racial awareness to others
Dear Editor:
As a recent alum, I was happy to hear that Swatties are

finally waking up to the reality ofracial discrimination/prejudice in their world. For a time, it seemed like Swarthmore
believed it was exempt from such realities. I must admit, however, that however well-intentionedPhoenix writers can be, it
would do them well to capture more diverse opinions when
interviewing people on this subject. I refer here to "Student
share stories of discrimination"(April 19,) written by Lillie
Dremeaux. You cannot capture the experience of campus/community racism or bias with one person's story or from the
perspective of one ethnic group. Many other minorities experience such injustice in Swarthmore; in particular I refer to
those of bi-racial heritage, Latinos and Asian-Americans.
Last year a group of people, composed ofLatinos and AsianAmericans in my class year, were refused service at a bar for
reasons no one was ever able to explain. Over the course of
four years, there were many more things that remain "unexplained." In addition, the racial tensions and discrimination
that exists within and often between diverse groups, in particular withinblack and Latino groups, is seldom discussed. I
urge Phoenix writers and by extension, the Swarthmore community, to expand the "racial dialogue" to include all people
mistreated by racism, colorism or gender bias in an effort to
correct the problem where it starts: within ourselves.

WSRN unfair to classical DJs
Dear Editor:
I take issue with the statement of the WSRN board that
"genre blocking is a mechanism designed to introduce listeners to music they will likely enjoy, not to punish classical DJs"
(letter to the editor, April 26). The classical timeslot is from 7
a.m. to 10 a.m. This timeslot conflicts with many classes, and
when it doesn't, it forces the DJs to wake up extremely early.
Surely there has to be a better way to "schedule [WSRN's] programming conscientiously," in a way that doesn't force some
genres into extremely lousy time slots. Who cares if people
are listening to you at 7 a.m. if you're half asleep?

Dear Editor:
Apparently my response to the Student Council letter has
not been made generally available, based on this weeks' opinion posted by Elizabeth Goldsmith. I think my letter tracks
closely with the points made by Goldsmith.
The main difference is my belief that for healing to occur,
the Administration and Board majority will have to display a
leadership that has been missing so far. Still, I can't help but
wonder what Elizabeth's answer would be to her friend if he
wanted to wear a badge or carry a sign asking for racial tolerance at his graduation.
But in any event, I think my letter should make it clear
that we have no plans for any activities at graduation.

Bill Robinson '6O
President, Mind the Light
Ed. note: Excerpts from the letter follow:

Graduationis a special time for the graduating seniors, their
families, and invited guests. We do not feel it would be an appropriate setting for any MTL activities. We would recommend
that any actions of those in attendance be respectful ofothers
who do not share our views... we do not think it is either necessary or appropriate to use graduation as a forum for our views.
As we have indicated in other communications, we do not
believe in being disruptive at college events. We do believe it
is appropriate to present the facts about the decision, our concerns about how the decision was made, and our concerns
about the direction the college is taking without the involvement or consensus of the college community.
The kind of disruption that occurred at Family Weekend
is a result of the strong emotions felt by many members of the
college community. With the exception of one session in the
Meeting House in December and the March edition of the
Swarthmore Bulletin, the administration has provided no forum for expressions of dissent.

History vital to women's rights movement
BY MAUREEN VERNON
With our young ages, short memories, and ignorance of the
past, it becomes too easy for us to forget recent history. When my
mother was in high school, there weren't any female athletic
teams at her school. Not too long ago, the only role women could
play in sports was spectator. When the women's lacrosse team
played their final game, a small group ofmy friends and I thought
it would be fun to dress as cheerleaders for support. We were
women athletes cheering for women athletes, but we were also
dressed up in those hopelessly objectifying outfits. How sad I felt
knowing that this used to be women's only opportunity.
How awful I felt about the continuation of cultural connotations attached to cheerleading.
By donning the uniforms, we
"

somehow became someone
else's fantasy, the sexually accessible, cute cheerleaders.
The negativity of this feeling was topped onlyby the reaction of the impressionable
pre-teen girls who told us
that we were good cheerleaders. One made us dandelion
bracelets and told us that she
wanted to be a cheerleader

What would the women who paved the way for our participation in sports say to this young girl? What would my suffragette aunt, Mabel Vernon, after chaining herself to the White
House to protest for women's suffrage, tell the woman who

doesn't vote? What would women like her tell the "feminist"
that expects her date to pay and doors to be open after fighting
for relational equality? What would Virginia Woolf, kept out of
college because of her gender, say to those ofus who don't take
advantage of our opportunities? How would they react to the
continued presence of violence against women?
We have forgotten what specific inequalities
such as men
driving, taking husband's names and men paying for dates and
opening doors
meant to the women who fought to change
them. What would they say to

wage gap, job segregation,

tic violence rates, single working poor mothers, pornography and disparities in higher
education. They would tell us that "our" work is not done.
Then they would tell us to look at our diplomas, start-up salaries, teams and the narrowing wage gap and appreciate how
far we've come. This is crucial if feminism is going to be a
powerful force, rather than seeping into the recesses of our
collective consciousness until something spurs its rebirth, like
de-legalized abortion. We have lost our connection to our powerful ancestry because we have neglected to appreciate those
that have fought the battles before.
How easy it is to forget how far we have come, and the
tenacious visionaries that have brought us here. By forgetting this, we disempower ourselves and fail to take the next
step: "Those who do not remember the past are condemned to
repeat it." If we don't know where we've been, how can we
know where we're going?

too (insert scream). I urgently turned her to the playing field
and told her that she wants to be a lacrosse player, not a cheerleader. Then I remembered the power of cultural ideologies
for women. At that age, I wanted to be a cheerleader too. They
were the heroes of the female story, embodying the culturally
valued characteristics of beauty and popularity.
Standing there on the sideline, I started remembering that
not too long ago women couldn't participate in sports at all. In
fact, women were discriminated against in practically every
sphere of life. Women gained suffrage 81 years ago. In 1973, women
won theright to choose the future of theirbodies; FDA-approved
birth control pills are only 41 years old. Women earned 59 cents
to the male dollar in 1978, and the wage gap remains. Despite
years of organizing, we don't have an Equal Rights Amendment,
a sad embarrassment to the "leaders of the free world."

We need reformed
council elections
According to independent watchdog groups, more
money was spent on the current Student Council election cycle than in all of last year's campaigns combined. Where once anyone could serve on the council,
now only those candidates who are filthy rich or who
are supported by the big-money interests have the
chance to be heard in our beloved, all-powerful student government. Soon, we'll start seeing campaigns
sponsored by Phillip Morris, and the only people on
council will be the progeny of oil sheiks. I think it's
time the little man had his voice heard again. The time
has come for campaign finance reform.
Did everyone see those big campaign posters in
Sharpies that looked professionally done? How could
they were gargantuan!
anyone have missed them
Those cost four bucks a pop. My entire campaign cost
four dollars, and frankly I found that excessive. I would
rather have spent that money on beer and allergy
drugs. How am I to compete with Big Money? I am
merely a humble candidate with a 14-point plan for
making all of your lives better. I thought I used my
four dollars judiciously, putting up forty signs around
campus, many of them strategically placed in bathrooms in order to get voters' undivided attention. By
the next day, half of them were torn down, and three
days later a mere eight were left hanging, some ofthem
outrageously covered by other candidates' signs. Other
candidates seem to have solved this problem by putting up a whole new round of signs every couple days.
It seems that the only way to win a campaign these
days is through attrition, and attrition requires funding. One study showed that 95 percent of SC candidates who outspent their opponent won.
The trouble all began with Lauren "Starfruit"
Tobias last semester. She was running against popular incumbent Will Ortman, and in order to win, she
ran a textbook campaign of plastering the campus with
so many signs that only a blind man could avoid her
deluge of promises. Mike Morse has taken up the
Tobias tradition by spreading his populist "anti-PDC"
signs for all to see. Anna Morgan tried to capitalize on
Morse's name recognition by running as "The Horse,"
but we all know how hopeless her cause was. The Anna
Morgans of the student body have no chance, and their
worthwhile proposals are drowned out in the cacophony of the big-money interests. Anna Morgan's
only prayer of winning is public funding ofcampaigns,
and limiting the excesses of campaign spending.
Now some antiquated "Constitutionalists" might
object that this is a blatant violation ofthe First Amendment, and the Supreme Court has ruled that campaign
speech is protected just like any other speech. But campaign finance reform just means that some candidates
can't just shout louder than their quieter opponents.
Others might point out that the freedom of association
of money is equivalent to freedom of speech. However,
they clearly must not have listened to the Left's constant harangue that money is inherently evil.
Others would object that the system of "one man,
one vote" must be counterbalanced by allowing those
with a greater personal stake in the issues at hand
(special interests) to demonstrate their arguments for
the public debate. But then we'll be giving the bigmoney interests too much sway. SBC might object that
they're strapped for cash already, and public funding
is going to cost big bucks. But can you really put a
price tag on democracy? Finally, some opponents will
contend that all campaign finance reform will do is
curtail civil discourse, and consequently the media
will be given disproportionate influence over who gets
elected. But hey, I'm a staff member of The Phoenix,
so I like the sound of that.
I've had enough of our corrupt election system,
and I've heard enough stories about the big money
donors who get to go to Paces with Tobias. The time
has come to clean up the system and kick the special
interests out of Parrish Parlours.

Democracy

not a cure-all
Leftists forget that democracy does
not guarantee equality for all
BY DAVID HAENDLER
If there's one thing that modern leftists can agree
on, it's the miraculous power of democracy. There has
always been a strong populist streak in left-wing movements, but nowadays that tendency seems to be especially strong.
Take free trade protestors, for instance. One theme
which consistently reoccurs at anti-globalization rallies
is the idea that the activists, rather than government
officials, are the true representatives of what the public wants. When protestors in Quebec put together their
own economic conference, they called it "The People's
Summit," making the not-entirely-unreasonable assumption that all free marketers like myself are evil
robot replicants rather than authentic people. When
anti-WorldTrade Organization filmmakers put together
a documentary on the Seattle riots, they gave their paean
to Starbucks-smashing the humble title "This Is What

LETTER
Characterization of parent's protest inaccurate
Dear Editor:
I hope Elizabeth Goldsmith will revisit her judgment
about the presence of Mind the Light (MTL) members on
campus during Family Weekend ("Spoiled brats," April 12).
I assume her comment that "parents with pressing questions [were] steamrolled by outspoken, belligerent MTL members during the recent Parents' Weekend" refers to the forum with President Bloom. I infer that she did not attend
this session and that her information was derived from the
stories that "abound" on campus. I was at that forum, and I
would like to provide a different interpretation.
I'm a Swarthmore alumna and the parent ofa football player.
I also belong to MTL, but I was on campus Family Weekend
because I am a parent with pressing questions about the athletic decision and the precedent it sets. Family Weekend was
my only chance to ask those questions because theadministration has neiher invited me to discuss what happened nor answered any of the four important letters I have written.
No steamrolling took place in the first half of the forum because the administration controlled the format. After they finished, at least four non-football parents asked questions; a fifth
parent commended theadministration on itsathletics decision.
Five "anti-decision" people were recognized: three football
parents, a senior (a football player) and an alumnus. Three
asked questions I don'tview as steamrolling.
As the third football parent to speak, I asked a footballsounding question that was really a process question accus-

ARC of having a pre-determined conclusion. President Bloom answered with a familiar refrain: "I absolutely
disagree that I ever said anything like this." My husband,
Bob Clark "71, interrupted from the audience and shouted;
after a highly charged exchange, he left the auditorium. The
alumnus (a former Board of Managers member) asked why
President Bloom had lobbied him to eliminate football a
month before the board's December 2000 decision. As Bloom
denied this accusation, Keith pointed at this alumnus and
shouted, "I'll speak to you outside!" President Bloom then
declared the forum over, and football parents began to protest the meeting's contraction.
Elizabeth Goldsmith should hold the administration responsible for handling the situation poorly. Should the provost shake a finger and shout at a former board member? If
our voluble response to president Bloom's continued denial
of facts we find incontrovertible was inappropriate, why is
Provost Keith's behavior not equally inappropriate? Furthermore, why shouldn'twe expect the president of Swarthmore
College to skillfully handle dissent?
I am sorry if some parents who attended the forum had
important questions that remained unasked. They could try
writing a letter to this administration. If they, too, are stonewalled, then perhaps they will begin to understand our frustration and concern for the college's future. It might just
change the nature of the stories abounding on campus.

Last week, loyal Phoenix readers were treated to a collaborative poem which said that democracy would do everything from providing a decent standard of living for

but it's still pretty disconcerting.
When you say the word 'idemocracy," for most of us it conjures up images ofvoting booths and C-SPAN. For those of
us interested in globalization, it may bring to mind the
recent electoral victory of Mexico's free-tradingpresident,
Vicente Fox. How did all that stuff get replaced by puppetwielding anarchists and free verse about the living wage?
For the supporters of June Jordan, the word "democracy" seems to be a shorthand way of saying, "Things
that we like, such as tolerance, minority representation
and fair treatment of workers." The problem is that democracy, especially in its purer forms, is none of these
things. Democracy is not conducive to fair treatment of
minorities. In Mississippi, a referendum calling for the
Confederate banner to be removed from the state flag
was defeated by a solid majority despite the facts that
Mississippi's black residents are offended by it and that
"The Dukes of Hazzard" has been off the air for many
years. Democracy is not a system which safeguards the
working man. From Pericles to Thomas Jefferson, many
of history's greatest democratic thinkers have been
slaveholders. And despite the attractive rhetoric of "one

man, one vote," democracy does not protect equality.
Slobodan Milosevic was booted out ofoffice not for starting a campaign of genocide against Kosovo's Albanians,
but because he couldn't get the job done. By making the
fallacious statement that activism equals democracy
equals goodness and happiness for everyone, leftists
ignore a long history of populist thuggery and
majoritarian tyranny.

produce moral, equitable results when it is channeled
through a representative government with a firm basis
in constitutional law. And there are many times when
the will of the people should be flat-out denied. One of
the best things about the republican, two-party system
of government is that not everyone's views are represented. As anyone who has ever attended a Pat Buchanan
rally, a Noam Chomsky lecture or a Star Trek convention knows, there are plenty of people in this country
who should not be allowed to hold political power. When
you characterize the opinions of a small, extremely vocal group of volunteers as being more valid than the opinions of duly elected officials, the activities listed above
are transformed from the eccentricitiesof weird, dysfunctional minorities into completely legitimate expressions
of the popular mood. Protest movements are a vital part
of the public discourse, but they cannot claim to trump
the results of the electoral process.

SC campaigns products of flawed system
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
Wayne Cabradilla thinks that his unbridled passion for unicorns will get him elected to Student Council. David
Ellis is convinced that the financial represemtative has the power and the responsibility to raise the average Swarthmore G.P.A. Mike Morse is promising to abolish PDCs and give extra credit for lab sections
the same campaign
promises made by educational policy candidates for the last three semesters. And just about every single candidate
has decided that one poster won't do the job. I apparently need a dozen to be convinced of their superiority over all
other candidates (who are also, naturally, posting twenty or so posters right next to their competitors'). Posted on the
same wall. By the same candidate. With the candidate's name in huge letters. In colors usually used in nature to scare
away predators and denote danger. All hail almighty Kinko's.
It seems that the winning equation for the campaign victory has been reduced to the brightest colors, the loudest
promises, the biggest fonts and the most random campaign slogans. Sure, they all make me giggle deep inside. But I
still fail to see the relevance of x-rays of bottles stuck in the most painful places to Student Council. These campaigns
are a waste of paper, time, wall space and words. Most of the campaign promises are unrealistic and are a repetition
of previous campaigns. Even more so they suffer from a surprising lack of creativity. Which probably explains the
propensity of the candidates to delve into the random and bizarre in hopes of locating their funny bones.
The most upsetting thing about the campaign, however, is that neither one of these phenomena is the fault of the
candidates. Rather, it is highly likely that those who take the principles guiding this semester's campaign to the
extremes will win. Frankly, not campaigning using at least one of the methods mentioned above would be an
unwise political choice. In fact, the choice would border on stupidity and just about automatically disqualify a
candidate from receiving my personal vote for failure to capitalize on what is realistic and popular. The Swarthmore
way of campaigning thus presents the wannabe council members with a choice: to win or to be reasonable in their
methods.
The question I humbly pose is whether the winners' places on council shouldbe won based on their senses ofhumor
not something required of a SC member and tried and true promises thathave worked time after time, rather than
on their pertinent qualities and distinctive platforms. And just throw in the question of the council changing something
to prevent future bombardment of my feeble brain by minimalist slogans like "Lauren Tobias for Co-Pres," which relate
absolutely no information and rely on nothing but name recognition and popularity of the candidate.
The people whose campaigns I mentioned have succeeded in their purpose: grabbing my attention and making me
remember their names. They have therefore successfully capitalized on the latest campus trends and the most talkedabout issues. Most of them should also be very proud of themselves for being funny people. Nonetheless, I voted on
their Phoenix platforms and not on their individual senses of humor. I just hope that the majority of the student body
did the same and did not hold the candidates responsible for their collective wastefulness.

How to care,
yet survive
BY DANIEL MARRIN

Tuesday morning, I awoke to a phone call from a woman at
Drexel Hill, who announced that I had won $950 worth of cemetery property. A while back, I would have hung up laughing,
but on Tuesday I accepted the offer. While this year has taught
me to take advantage of totally random situations, I also knew
that even if I couldn't use the property, I might be able to give it
to someone else who could. I probably sound like a bleeding heart,
but I have never seen myself that way.
When I first came in here as a freshman, I had opinions on a
lot of social concerns, but I didn't want to diverge from academics by acting on them. Only I didn't think of it as apathy. I called
it "issue fatigue," caring about an issue but lacking the will to
speak out. In the Swarthmore bubble, one is both isolated from
many issues and surrounded by campaigns. Our myriad movements usually operate on a small scale, with memberships changing every two to three years. Looking at the sheer number of
campaigns contrasted withlittle visible need to change anything
besides your GPA, I think you can get fatigued about something
you actually have a strong opinion on.
Outside campus, the time doesn't seem ripe for social progress.

THE RISE OF CAUSES I DISAGREE
WITH, SUCH AS THE PRO-LIFE
MOVEMENT, CONSTITUTES VITAL
ACTIVISM FOR THIS CAMPUS. THESE
CAUSES SIGNAL THAT MORE
STUDENTS ARE GETTING ORGANIZED
ABOUT ISSUES THEY CARE ABOUT.
Our president is considered illegitimate by some and hypocritical by many. While his latest Parade Magazine exclusive claims
he wishes to “lift the spirit of the country,” his administration
works to remove funds for underprivileged education, environmental protections, and benefits for labor, Social Security, and
Medicare. The sheer level of hypocrisy between the rhetoric and
the lawmaking is enough to make you want to move to Sweden.
What does it say for my love of this country when I’d be rather
pleasantly surprised if our two top leaders, Bush and Cheney,
died tomorrow in a car crash? How do you end that cynicism and
find faith again?
Cynicism stops when you decide that maybe even if our leaders don’t agree with our positions, we can still make it so they
cannot afford to ignore us. For me, faith has come from looking
at this web of problems in our newspapers, world and college,
and picking the issue that most angers and inspires me. My passion returned because, after years of seeing campus campaigns
only making small ripples in a sea of troubles, I found that issue.
As an anti-death penalty activist, I have a concrete social problem that can be fixed, and in working on that, I learn and become
impassioned about discrimination, poverty, social injustice,
criminal justice, the lawmaking process and the potential of a
united religious left.
Throughout these years, I heard people call Swarthmore liberal, chock-full ofissues and activists. Frankly, if we’re the most
liberal school out there, I’d find that rather sad, because there’s
a lot more to be done. However, there are definitely groups here
to take advantage of. One doesn’t need to be a stereotypical rebellious “activist,” defiant ofall societal conventions, to get involved
either. Even the rise of causes I disagree with, such as the prolife movement, constitute vital activism for this campus, because
it signals that more students are getting organized about issues
they care about.
As our last president fell into scandal in the winter ofmy freshman year, I joined many others in feeling fatigued about social
progress. I saw my cynicism and disappointment reflected in the
nation’s stance toward our political leaders. However, this “issue fatigue” can be cured. If you think there’s too much work
and too little time to save the world, don’t. Just find the issue
that drives you and strive to make a small difference within it,
with equal doses of anger and faith. It might change your outlook on other things as well. Finally, I beg you not to despair
about politics in 2001, but to see it as a reason to become even
more determined to raise your voices for change. Ultimately,
there’s no need to move to Sweden.

Space is
the place
BY TED CHAN
Despite NASA's gyrations, the Soviet space
program's decision to allow extreme-tourist Dennis
Tito into orbit is a good one that's long past due.
Space, after all, is somewhere people dream of going. Not just multimillionaires like Dennis Tito, but
millions of others. By satiating this need, even if it
is limited to the incredibly wealthy, American and
Soviet space programs can gain the funding they

IF BILL GATES OR RUPERT
MURDOCH DEVELOPS THIS
FLEDGLING INDUSTRY, THEY
WILL NOT TURN THE MONEY
TOWARDS SPACE RESEARCH.
need to further important projects.
I'll admit, I'm a space junkie. I've been hooked
ever since I went to the Hayden Planetarium in
Boston's Museum of Science as a kid. A borderlineunhealthy addiction to "Star Trek: The Next Generation" also contributed. So it breaks my heart every time I hear we don't have enough funding to send
another probe to Mars or study a distant quasar. I
had few better moments in my childhood than poring over the photographs and information Voyager
2 sent back about Neptune and Uranus. I marveled
at all those new moons and rings. Those pictures
got a whole generation of kids interested in the far
reaches of our solar system.
Besides enhancing my knowledge, the research
involved enhances many other things. Better materials and applied technologies for the entire aero-

space industry, important understandings of other
planets and planetary systems that carry over to our
own planet. As I learned to say in a year working at
Brookstone, the innovative gadget store, "The incredible Tempurpedic pillow is derived from research by NASA!"
Certainly, it's debatable whether these advances
are worth the huge amount of money that governments have needed to contribute in the past. But if
they ean extract the cash from space tourists and
commercial research contracts and use it to build
more space shuttles, stations and probes, train more
astronauts and revive interest about space exploration, why not do it? NASA has objected over safety
concerns, but it really shouldn'tbe too hard to adapt
space shuttles and stations to be safe for a relatively
untrained passenger. Basically, you give them a window seat and tell them not to touch any damn buttons. Worst comes to worst, you can always get bailed
out by an inanimate carbon rod.
A lot of things once belonged only to scientists or
a trained select few. Space, until this week, has been
one of them. But there's no doubt that people want
to go into space, and will pay to do it. It's time for
NASA, a group truly dedicated to research, to hop
in on this lucrative opportunity, and put the money
they make towards furthering space research. Otherwise, it's not going to be too long before some
wealthy, bold tycoon realizes this is the gateway to
a billion dollar industry. If Bill Gates or Rupert
Murdoch develops this fledgling industry, they will
not turn the money towards space research. No matter how much of a philanthropist that person might
turn out to be, it would be a real shame to see NASA
miss out on that opportunity.
Hawaii, Paris, outer space. For different reasons,
they're attractive destinations for those with the
means. For national space programs losing money
and losing interest, it's time to make orbit a costly
alternative to sunshine, mountains and fresh air.

This is America
How a roadtrip

taught one Swattie
what school couldn't
BY MATT RUBIN
On my way to Ohio this weekend, I drove
over 20 hours on cruise control. I quickly realized (after almost hitting a decapitated
deer) that cruise control can lull you into a
sense of false confidence. The bloody image
of that decapitated deer loomed in mind as I
realized that, much like cruise control, my
liberal education has lulled me into a false
sense of confidence in my knowledge of this
country. I finally realized that I know nothing of the culture ofmiddle America, a large
and important segment of our nation.
I was completely caught off guard by all
the small, rural towns we passed. In
Shippensburg, after my windshield wiper
broke, I attempted to pay for the duct tape I
used to fix it; the cashier was astoundedand
refused my money. In Normalville, I stared
at a cashier in disbelief when she told me
that Johnnie's Homestyle Restaurant was the
only restaurant in a fifteen-mile radius; I was
even more astounded by Johnnie's amazing
apple pie and friendly service. And don't
even get me started on Ponderosa, let alone
the mullets therein.
My trip through the Rust Belt taught me
how little I really know about America.
While I might be an expert on American urbanization and gentrification and their effects on various generations of AfricanAmericans or the economic implications of
the Truman Doctrine, I hardly know anything about grain storage or livestock grazing. My scenic views from one day on the
Ohio Turnpike (facilitated by my potentially
murderous cruise control) accounted for
more time spent studying this region than
I have received in over a decade of liberal,
suburban education.
Before this trip, I thought that I, ivory-tower intellectual
that I am, had nothing to learn from Lamar, Pa. Rather, I believed, Lamar had a lot to learn from me. Having heard little
more about central Pennsylvania than the number of hate
groups registered there, I pictured an "Amerika" in need of
serious help, not the America that I quickly grew to love. The
America I encountered this weekend was replete with patriotic flags hanging from tatteredbarns, license plates and town
names proudly proclaiming service to this nation's military,
and friendly people whose chief concerns are their happiness,
their family and their God.
By not being taught about this
America, I have been implicitly
taught to dismiss it. After all, if, at
m^^mmmK^m^^mm
a prestigious institution like
Swarthmore, there is something I
am not taught about, must that
thing not be devoid of intellectualism and therefore of value? While
my parents might, in an attempt to
motivate me in my studies, answer
yes to this question, my answer is
an emphatic no. The silent majority of this state's population, in addition to being fascinating and
lovely, is also important to understand. After all, it elected
our last president, and will most likely elect many more.
Schools today do not teach classes intended to help us
profoundly understand the large rural area between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, or all of the similar areas that make
up the geographic majority of this great nation. Instead, anewfound focus on "social history" and a study of inner cities and minorities often comes at the expense of any attention to what is perhaps the largest quasi-coherent faction in
the country. To some degree, I believe, this new sort of education is motivated by a valid reaction to years of learning
only about dead white males. These dead white males we so

often study, however, do not speak for the silent majority that makes up our nation's countryside. For, while
N.W.A.'s song "Fuck the Police" might accurately portray
the sentiments of many who are opposed to racial profiling, Milton's "Paradise Lost" in no way reflects the atti-

tudes of wheat farmers angry about issues of free trade.
In fact, I can't even think of one document I've studied
that in any way taught me about the culture of middle

America.
The premise behind so much of our education here is
that, in order to make an impact on our world, we must
first deeply understand it. As long as we continue to ignore such a large and integral part of our national community, however, we will never
attain this deep understanding
and instead will simply retain
the perspectives with which we
entered Swarthmore. No matter how progressive our knowledge is, it will be severely limited.

BEFORE THIS TRIP, I
THOUGHT THAT I,
IVORY-TOWER INTELLECTUAL
THAT I AM, HAD NOTHING TO
LEARN FROM LAMAR, PA.

Ironically, my journey to

Ohio coincided with my first
encounter with the song "This
is America" by one of my favorite bands, Spacehog. In it,
frontman Royston Langdon sings, "The Statue of Liberty
lost her virginity to me/ oh yeah/ 'cause this isAmerica."
However, my trip began to teach me that Royston's
America, the America of vulgar metropolises and poor,
pseudo-intellectual allusions, is not most people's
America.
America, rather, consists ofthe vastplots ofland between
hereand California. The coasts and cities ofthis nation make
up a tiny portion of it, while countless miles of sceniclandscapes house millions of our fellow Americans. So, what
kind ofan education simply ignores national matters of such
sheer magnitude? A poor, liberal one.

IN DEPTH
During

the couple of weeks that followed the Board of
Managers December 2 decision to drop football and
wrestling from the intercollegiate athletic program and
to demote badminton, it seemed on the surface as if the campus was largely united in their feelings ofshock and condemnation of the process by which the decision was made. But
five months later, when asked about the healing process and
the aftermathof the decision, students differed widely in their
responses. Some students said they thought the decision had
mostly subsided for the majority of students, while others
primarily thosepersonally affected by it—said they stillthink
about it every day.
While not personally affected the cut, Pablo Montagnes
'O2 said he feels as the decision is "not done" because "some
people don't feel like it's been resolved."
Dan Schwartz 'Ol said he did not see people actively discussing the situation anymore. Echoing the view of several
other students, Jeff Loesel 'Ol said that it seems like many
decisions that initially create a large controversy on campus
and then die down.

Judging partly by the posts on the Daily Jolt, which he
acknowledged weren't a very accurate source, Jordan
Brackett 'Ol said he feels that some people are tired of the
issue, while othersremain deeply angry. "Al Bloom's approval
rating has gone down," he said, '&nd people are a little more
distrustful of the administration. That said, I don't think it's
very

extreme."
Student Council Co-President Colin Moore said, "I think
for the most part people have accepted the decision, but it
has eroded the administration's social capital to a large degree."
He said that the council's focus has been on using the decision to try to find ways to ensure greater input from students in the future. "Student Council has worked hard to get
more student input [to the administration and board] and
has been mildly successful, though not as successful as I would
have liked."
Earlier this semester, Moore said administrators were
open to more student input and agreed to meet with Student
Council members more regularly and to contact them if a
major decision was being made. As for the Board of Managers, Moore described it as "a very conservative organization"
that "doesn't really want anymore formal input from students."
In the end, Moore feels that the council has been more
successful in establishing informal means for a stronger voice
from students. "As far as institutional processes, that hasn't
happened and I don't see it happening in the near future."
But, Moore said, "I think the ARC is making a good effort
to improve athletics for students here and to a large extent
doing exactly what they said they would in the aftermath of
the decision."
Dean of the college Bob Grosssaid he had heard that some
felt therewas an undercurrent of distrust toward the administration. "I don't think anyone could design a process that
would include a plebiscite," he said. "While I have to admit
that we were rushed by the calendar and didn't take all the
steps that we might have taken, the fact that this is an autocratic administration that doesn't listen to students is belied
by dozens ofother examples."
Gross said the administration has approached the decision process by trying to "make whole as much as possible
the athletes affected by the decision." This does not mean
trying to make them happy with the decision, Gross said, but
instead includes facilitating transfers or domestic exchanges.
Moreover, he said, the college is "determined to show that
this effort really is about strengthening athletics." Finally,
the ARC is dealing with the cultural issues of stereotyping of
athletes. "We need as a community to respond to each others
passions and competencies," Gross said. "I don't think it's
fair to rank passions."
President Al Bloom said he has tried to publicize his open
office hours and meet with students almost immediately when
they ask for an appointment. For instance, he said that he is
meeting with a group of concerned students this week.
Students seemed divided on the issue of whether or not
the college has provided enough opportunities to discuss the
issue. "I'm not sure if there's a consensus about how much
people want to be engaged in this," Brackett said. The majority of students who did not seem to be as emotionally impacted by thedecision said they thought the administration
had ultimately provided sufficient information, though students had to seek it out.
Coaches said they helped their teams deal with healing
process by having team or individual meetings and trying to
provide as much information as possible to students who
wanted it.

Revisiting

Athletics
BY SONIA SCHERR
"We've talked a lot about the benefits of sport," basketball
coachAdrienne Shibles said. "We talkedabout what it meant to
each of us because they were feeling that what they do and the
effort they put out isn't valued."
Expressing the opinion of several coachesand students, Moore
felt that the decision allowed the campus to confront theissue of
devaluing ofathletes more directly than in the past. "If anything
positive came out of [the events surrounding the decision], it
was that the anger athletes felt about unrelated issues was
brought to the forefront, and students started discussing [those
issues] for the first time."

Swim coach Sue Davis said she "thinks the administration is

genuinely concerned about the healing process. I think the administration is learning a lot about how much athletics means
to athletes and what is involved in having a truly great intercollegiate athletic program."
And many students were adopting a wait and see attitude.
"The rationale behind this decision was to strengthen the
remaining athletic teams," Loesel said. "In five years I'd like to
see if they are."

BADMINTON
Badminton players say they are unclear about the future of
their team and wish that the administration would actively reach

out to them.

"It's been difficult to heal because there's no certainty as to
what's going to happen," said tri-captain Siobhan Carty 'OL Carty
said she feels that the members ofher team have been "left out of
the loop," placed in a secondary position to football, and generally not given the respect they deserve.
Tri-captain Karen Lange 'O2 also felt that a lack of information has left the team in limbo and prevented a sense of closure
that might lead to healing. "We've gotten very, very little to no
contact from theadministration and nothing from the ARC," said
Lange, who said that she has no more information about the
team than what she has read in ThePhoenix. She said she would
like to discuss the status of her team, why demoting the team to
club status is a good decision and how the team will function as
a club sport.
Lange and Jane Ng 'Ol, also a captain, also said that the demands of being Swarthmore students also mean that they have
many other matters to deal with besides the future oftheir team.
"It starts feeling like I and the team should be the only ones to
make overtures to get the ball rolling," Lange said. "It's disappointing that the authority figures in my community are not
making lines for communication."
The team had one meeting with Keith, Bloom and Williams,
and individual members of the team also went to talk to Bloom
earlier this semester. Badminton players also say they feel hurt
that no official notification was ever sent to their team about the
board's decision.
"It would have been nice if there were more occasions when
we as a team were contacted," Ng said. At the same time, how-

ever, she felt that there is not much to discuss because it is not
yet clear how badminton will function as a club sport.
Although none of the badmintonplayers interviewed seemed
to know for certain when the team's status would change from
varsity to club, Bloom and Keith said in interviews earlier this
week that the team will be grandfathered, retaining its varsity
distinctionfor the next three years while members of the team
at the time of the board's decision remain at the college.
Ng said that while it would have been nice if the decision had
not occurred, she does not think that team members are still
angry. The most pressing goal, she said, will be to make sure
that the team can still operate at the same level as a club sport.
Eventually she believes that the team will address the issue of
regaining its varsity status, a goal she feels can be achieved in
part because of the team's diversity. "By cutting badminton,
you're taking a varsity sport away from a lot of female minority
students," she said.
"We as a team don't hold a grudge against Al Bloom," she
said. "It was a very flawed process on many different levels. It
seems kind ofsilly to point fingers at individualsand say they're
responsible

Ng, who felt that some of the negative tactics used against
the administration have not been highly productive, said she
personally prefers to meet with the administrationand make
sure that progress is made. "It would be nice if they apoloI'd
gized but I personally think it's such a complex issue
rather they spend the energy they'd put into coming up with
an apology into addressing how they can fix the situation."
This means taking into consideration the fact that badminton functions differently from club sports when reexamining
the latter program.
Ng and Carty said the team focused on making it through
the season, most ofwhich occurred after the board's decision.
Ng noted that Bloom came to one of their matches, a gesture
she appreciated. The team won the conference title, which
"meant a lot to us," Ng said. "It was a way to prove to them
that we do well and are proud to be a team."
She was also pleased that some posts on the Daily Jolt recognized badminton's situation. "That's a good sign because
for us it's really important that people don't just think it's a
...

football thing."
But Lange said the season was still a difficult one. "I was
burnt out enough from all the politics that it was hard to enjoy playing this year. I was a huge pro-Swarthmore person
before this," said Lange, who emphasizes that she still loves
her professors and fellow students. But when prospective students came to the college a couple weeks ago, "for the first
time I wasn't sure what to tell them."
She added, "It's hard to say you're still hurt, that there's
been no healing process, when it seems like most of campus
has moved on."

FOOTBALL
Football players whose sport was cut last December may
appear to be moving on. In general, underclassmen have decided whether they will stay at Swarthmore, attempt to transfer to another institution with a football program, or spend
the fall semester elsewhere. But football players interviewed
say they remain deeply upset and, in some cases, angered by
the board's decision to drop their sport. They say that for them,
the anguish caused by the cut will always remain.
Expressing a recurring theme among those interviewed,
Justin Paglieli 'O2 said, "The sheer fact of cutting our teams
hurts us inexplicably. I don'tknow if that can ever be healed."
Rob Melick 'O3 said he was not sure what would constitute
a healing process in the aftermath of the decision. "My mom
never had a chance to see my last football game," he said.
"You can't heal that." When Melick speaks with his mother,
she often tells him that she feels bad about missing that final
game.
"There are some things you can't replace, can't refund,
can't make better," Melick said.
Others focused on their continuing anger. "I'm still justas
furious as when I found out," tri-captain Scott Murray 'Ol said.
"Maybe healing will happen when I get out, when everything
I see doesn'tremind me of [the decision]."
"For me personally, it's still something I think about ev-

ery day, and it still doesn'tsit right withme,"
Brian Byrnes 'O2 said. "I'm forced to choose
between leaving and my last chance to play
the game I love, and being here with the
people I've grown to love in the past few

years." For players like Byrnes, healing is
problematic because they feel that the administrationfailed to give serious consideration
to possibilities other than dropping football,
and has not been upfront about what they
perceive was itscommitment to the program.
"I think there's a lot of issues that the administration hasn't really addressed properly," he said, 'cind deep down I don't think
they've ever been completely honest about
the subject."

end, hereiterated again his appreciation for the
special people he has met here and the opportunities afforded by the honors program. (Melick
is an honors economics major with a minor in
peace and conflict studies.) But as he watches
some ofhis teammates transfer or make plans
to leave next fall, there are moments when he
questions this decision.He said he may consider
spending fall semester of his senior year at
Carleton in order to have one more opportunity
to play football before he graduates.
But Melick will be on campus this fall. To
ease the sadness of Saturday afternoons in the
fall without football, he hopes to get off campus,
perhaps to do some coaching at a boys and girls
club in Philadelphia.
Murray and Jay Schembs 'Ol pointed out that
the decision is particularly difficult because football has been a significantpart
of players' lives for many
years. Schembs did suggest
that part of the healing process
might involve players trying
activities they did not have
time to participate in when
they were playing football; he
said he had noticed some players returning to sports they
might have played in high
school, such as rugby or baseball, but had not done in college because of the demands of

football.

Wes Sconce 'O4 said he is

concentrating on matters other
than the board's decision.

"If

you're going to stay here
there's no reason to dwell on
it," he said. "Nothing's going to
change."
While saying he probably
would not have initially chosen

Swarthmore without a football
program, he has decided to re-

main because he likes the college, has become involved in
campus life and does not see
himself starting over somewhere else.
Most of the players felt that the administration has taken steps to facilitate whatever
amount of healing is possible. For instance,
Byrnes said Dean ofStudent Life Tedd Goundie
has met at least once with almost all the players
to discuss plans for the future, and that people
at every levelof the administration have worked
to help players who want to transfer or spend
the fall away from Swarthmore.
"On the whole they're doing whatever they
can to make sure people can be where they want
to be next fall, which is nice," said Byrnes, who
had just returned from a visit to Pomona where
he and Paglieli will spend thefall semester. "But
at the same time it doesn't make up for what
happened," he said.
In addition to Byrnes and Paglieli, who will
participate in a domestic exchange program at
Pomona in order to play football, Goundieknows
ofthree membersof the team who intend to take
a leave of absence in the fall and will study
abroad or take classes at another school; they
will not play football, however. As for thosewithdrawing permanently, three players have already transferred, and Goundie has information
on 11 other players who are in the process of
applying to transfer, though he is unsure how
many will end up leaving. Those football players interviewed gave similar estimates for the
number of students attempting to transfer or
leave campus for the fall semester.
Melick mentioned that certain members of
the administration have made an effort to talk
to players and to participate in a fireside chat to
discuss the issue of making athletes feel more
comfortable on campus.
While maintaining that administrators are
open to meeting with students, some members

Athletic director Bob Williams.
The majority of the football players interviewedfelt thatsufficient informationstill
has not been presented as to why the decision was made. Moreover, the players maintain that the administration dismissed facts
they presented that might suggest alternative conclusions to the one reached in December. There is a pervasive feeling among
members of the team that the real reason
football was cut has to do more with stereotyping of players than with improving the
remaining sports. Paglieli, whoalso wrestled,
said no satisfactory reason has been given
to explain why that program was terminated.
The decision to cut was particularly painful to many players because it came after a
three-year rebuilding period in which the
team improved dramatically, ending a three
year losing streak and finishing last year's
season 4-5.
"The decision to cut [football] dramatically changed our lives," Paglieli said. "We
worked three years on building the program
up from nothing to a respectable team, and
we were about to see the fruits of our labors."
Melick speculated about possible future
successes if the team had continued, and
wondered if he would have done anything
differently if he had known that November
11would be his last day ofintercollegiate football. "There's something unsettling," he said,
"knowing it was my last game but not knowing it at the time."
In an op-ed that appeared in The Phoenix
earlier this semester, Melick discussed his
decision to stay at Swarthmore rather than
transfer to another school where he could
play football. During an interviewlast week-

THE PHOENIX

of thefootball team said they felt unable tobring
themselves to do so because of their feelings
about the decision and how it was made.
Moreover, several players felt that the college needed to provide more forums whereplayers and particularly alumni and parents
could vent their feelings about the decision.
Some believed that outbursts such as the one at
parent's weekend resultedfrom the lack ofother
opportunities for alumniand parents to discuss
the decision.

"I want to see the administration accept accountability for what they did and really understand how much it hurt people on campus,"
Melick said. He felt that the college could have
done a better job communicating with parents
of the players, such as sending out personal
notes rather than two form letters. Personal letters to members of the team might also have
helped, he said.
But he felt that it is perhaps too late for such
gestures, and that it is important to focus on
actions that can be taken to make athletes feel
more comfortable on campus.

And Melick, who believes that education is
the key to ending the perceived stereotyping of
athletes, has come up with a few ideas of his
own. As a Campus Advisor (CA) for freshmen
in the fall, he hopes to develop activities for firstyear orientation week that will promote a
greater understanding of and respect for what
all athletes bring to the college community.

MIND THE LIGHT
Although formed in response to the board's
controversial decision to cut sports programs
Mind the Light
an organization of parents,
students, and alumni ofSwarthmore—has generated some controversy of its own in recent
weeks with a confrontation at parents weekend
and a statement by one member that the group
would protest at graduation.
According to a mission statement posted on
its Web site, MTL's purpose is to work toward
ending discrimination at Swarthmore, supporting a range ofinterests among thestudent body,
returning the college to its Quaker roots of inclusion and "to remind our College community
that, during periods of divisionand conflict, we
should 'Mind the Light' and return to the core
values that define Swarthmore College."
Mind
the
from
Light
evolved
SaveSwatSports, an organization formed in reaction to the board's December decision to cut
football and wrestling and demote badminton.
The organization has 500 members, according
to chair Bill Robinson '6O, and he expects membership "to pick up quite a bit more."
However, two separate incidents at a parent's
weekend panel has made some wary of the
group: at the event, MTL members accused Al
Bloom of lying, and member David Rowley was
quoted in the The Phoenix as saying "we will
continue to make ourselves known at graduation, alumni day and other college meetings" has
made some wary ofthe group. Student Council
wrote a letter to MTL asking them not to stage
protests at graduation, and the group responded
two weeks later with a letter stating that this
event was not an appropriate forum for expressing their views (see letter, pg. 9).
Melick, who is student vice chair of MTL,
repeatedly emphasized that while he cannot
speak for all members of the group, he is adamantly against any MTL action at graduation.
"Seniorshave earnedthat day," he said 'and our
own cause should not be furthered at their expense."
Most football players and a few other students strongly supported the MLT. Paglieli, a
memberofthefootball and wrestling teams, sees
the group as restoring inclusive decision-making and the Quaker value of consensus. Andrea
Figuero 'O2, a lacrosse and field hockey player,
believes that MTL is an important presence for
students who feel the college does not under-

standthem.

"I think we would feel really alone if we
didn't have a large body of parents and
alumni to show support," she said.
Byrnes feels that when the administration does not seem to be listening to civil attempts at dialogue, sometimesit is necessary
to try other strategies. He pointed out that
Swarthmore students frequently stage protests in support of various causes.
But most students (and student-athletes
and coaches) interviewed said they felt ambivalent about the organization, saying they
support some ofits purported goal but disagree with some ofthe methods they are using to achieve those goals.
Brackett feels MTL's only legitimate gripe
is that they were slighted in the process by
which the decision was made. He feels that
many arguments used by MTL members are
simply wrong, such as the sentiment thatthe
administration is trying to turn the school
into "revenge of the nerds," and points out

that the college is generally more diverse
than 10 years ago and that many students
are more heavily involved in campus life.

Moore said he is worried that the group
is not taking a forward looking approach by
working for inclusion. "I'm concerned sometimes that they're just angry and want to drag
people's name though the mud, including the
name of this school."
Montagnes said he felt there the group
was "very inconsistent" in its claim to want
a return to Quaker values while at the same
time usingpersonal attack and other aggressive tactics. However, he distinguished between the alumni and student factions of
MTL, saying that thelatterhas shown much
more responsibility and leadership.
Asked to respond to such criticisms,
Robinson said that MTL is not a monolithic
organization, and that some of its members
feel so strongly about the decision that they
are very distrustful of the people involved.

While some students also suspected that
MTL is interested solely in the football decision, Melick says that the group's aims are
far-reaching. "We want to make sure that the
process by which the decision came about
never happens again," he said. "To cast us
all as bitter football players is a sweeping generalization on their part."
Robinson also stressed that the group was
concerned about badminton and wrestling
and feel that these sports were "pawns" in
the decision to cut football. He said, "if the
decision had been made to keep football with
the appropriate process," which includes
input and consensus among the factions involved, 'and it was concluded that there was
no way to keep football, then there wouldn't
be Mind the Light." But, he added, "I would
find it rather remarkable that you could
come to that conclusion."
The group also distributed a letter at prospective student's weekend alluding to
people's objections to the football cut, pointing students to the MTL Web site, encouraging them to become familiar with the decision, and urging them to make sure that the
administration kept maintainedits commitment to the remaining sports. According to
student MTL members involved in writing
and distributing it, the purpose of the letter
was to informprospective students about the
decision in a more complete manner than
they felt the administration has done. The
letter was considerably softer in tone and
substance than an earlier draft which lambasted the administration and urged students to consider other schools which was
never handed out.
Jim Bock, dean of admissions, said he

thought the letter was "fine."
"They distributed theletter in a very positive way and I think studentsrespected that,"

Coaches remain optimistic
BY SONIA SCHERR
In its recommendation to the Board of Managers lastDecember to cut football and wrestling and
demote badminton, the Athletic Review Committee cited the need to improve the college's intercollegiate athletic program while still maintaining a
diverse student body as the primary reason for this
decision. Nearly five months later, coaches generally said the college is moving toward this goal,
although they were careful to stress that plans remain in the discussion stages and that only time
will reveal whether or not the athletic program
improves. Some coaches seemed more measured
in their responses than others.
Basketball coach and ARC member Lee
Wimberly said "theadministration has shown that
they're genuinely concerned about making the athletic experience for students involved better." He
emphasized that this includes not just the intercollegiate program but club sports and recreational
opportunities as well.
Men's and women's swimcoach Sue Davis said
she feels that the college is genuinely committed
to improving the intercollegiate athletic teams, and
what remains to be done is finding the right way
to realize that goal.
"Not a lot of things have happened but there's a
lot of talk about what we need to do," saidKaren
Borbee, women's field hockey and lacrosse coach.
"That's the first step."
Amy Brunner, women's soccer coach and ARC
member said, "Steps are being made. I think everyone would always wish it was faster but I think
people need to understand that some of the steps
We can't rush out and finish
something without looking at the plan as a whole,
need planning.

...

and that takes time." Both Brunner and Borbee said
they hope to see tangible results by September.

Women's basketball coach Andrienne Shibles
said, "We're taking the right steps, but I think we
need to take more steps. In order to revitalize the
athletic program, a lot of work needs to be done."
Athletic director Bob Williams said he is "encouraged and optimistic about what's been transpiring so far." He added, "The area that has been
most difficult for us is facilities. Things have not
moved forward for us as rapidly as one might expect." However, he felt that this pace is understandable given the degree of planning involved.
Williams and the coaches were unanimous in
their support of this year's relationship with the
admissions office, praising in particular JimBock's
fairness and level of involvement.
Noting that the foundation for strengthening
team is talented student-athletes, Pete Carroll, who
coaches men's and women's cross-country and
track and field coach, said, "This recruiting year

has been very positive. I'm very appreciative of
the admissions support we've gotten and I look forward to a continuing relationship with the admissions group as far as continuing to strengthen our
teams."
Brunner and Wimberly noted that the athletics
department worked well both among themselves
and with the admissions staff. "I felt as though
without in any way compromising the what this
college stands for, there's been improved communication between admissions and the athletic department," said Wimberly, who like other coaches
emphasize that the standardsfor admission are just
as rigorous as in the past.
"I think things went as smoothly as could be
expected given that we had to redesign the process
after the decision was made," Bock said.
However, both the coachesand Bock lookedforward to the hiring of an associate athletic director, who would serve as a liaison between the admissions and athletics, as an important step in the
ongoing process of improving communication between the two departments.
"The new athletic director will be a real key in
the overall upgrade of our relationship with admissions," Carroll said. "[Having] someone as a
liason who's just overseeing the process is a comforting feeling."
Coaches said theassociate athletic director will
be able to focus on issues related to recruiting that
they do not have time for given their other respon-

sibilities. JimBock said creating this new position

will take the pressure off coaches who might have
felt uncomfortable pushing the needs of their own
sport.
The major change this year in the relationship
between admissions and athletics is that all 21
sports had formal communicationwith the admissions office; in previous years, only 12 sports were
given this opportunity. While saying that he does
not share the "nuts and bolts" of the communication system between the two departments because
he does not feel that these details are relevant, Bock

said the admissions office followed the ARC'S

recommendation of having 10 to 15 percent of the
students in the enrolled incoming class receive
preference based on athletic talent.
This year, however, because of the goal to
strengthen the remaining sports, Bock said a conscious decision was made to aim toward the upper
limit of that range. Moreover, it was difficult to predict yield for sport that had never been part of the
recruiting process. Calling admissions "part art, part
science," he said the percentage of recruited athletes in the admitted pool was probably similar to
the 15 percent target for the enrolled class, though

Although for some the Athletics Review Committee's name may have become synonymous with the decision to drop athletic programs, the
committee's work this semester is focused on initiatives to improve various
aspects of the athletic experience at Swarthmore, members say.
According to provost Jennie Keith, the ARC will present a report to the
board this weekend discussing the committee's activities this semester, following up on the progress of recommendations in the December report, and
making specific suggestions regarding issues of campus culture and support
for club sports.
Meeting biweekly, the ARC now includes three coaches Karen Borbee,
Lee Wimberly and Mike Mullan
who respectively coach women's field
hockey and lacrosse, men's basketball and men's tennis. With the excpetion
of Joe Corso 'O2, who transferred at the beginning of this semester, all of the
student members from last semester continue to serve on the ARC, including Mark Dingfield 'Ol, Sarah Jay 'Ol and Kate Vivalo 'OL New student members consist ofKatie Cloonan 'O3, Jennifer Pao 'Ol and Tim Lang 'O4.
In keeping with the recommendation made by ARC in December that all
sports have full-time coaches, the current part-time coaches of baseball, men's
soccer and women's tennis will be offered interim full-time appointments
for next year. The college will also conduct a national search next year for
permanent coaches in these areas, while at the same time working to define
full-time positions for women's volleyball, Softball and field hockey in order
to move toward hiring full-time coaching staff for these sports as well.
While praising the "amazing" part-time coaching staff, Keith said that
having full-time coaches is important "not just for what they can do for the
team and for recruiting but also for the opportunity it gives them to be members of the community and get involved in the culture of the college." This

deeper understanding of the college, Keith said, helps them be effective at
both recruiting students who might fit in at the college and persuading them
to matriculate.
Also underway is a national searchfor an associate athletic director whose
primary responsibility would be to provide leadership for the recruiting program and to serve as a liaison between athletics and admission, according to
Athletic Director Bob Williams. In addition, the associate athletic director
would assist with the daily operation of the sports program.
The committee, which has met four times, is chaired by engineering professor Art McGarity and Williams, and also includes student Katie Tarr 'O2,
Erika Williams 'Ol and Dingfield. Williams said the committee is looking for a
candidate who has interest and experience in recruiting, who possesses a national perspective on intercollegiate issues, and understand and appreciates
and understands the focus on academics and at [the college] and at the same
time understands the dedication that our student-athletes have for sport."
Over one hundred applications for the position have been received, and
the committee is currently in the process of narrowing the field and will
begin setting up phone interviews at its next meeting. Williams said he hopes
to have someone hired by September.
Williams, the coaching staff and Vice President for Facilities and Development Larry Schall are also working with an architect to develop a longterm plan for athletic facilities, including fields. This summer, some basic
work will be done in the fieldhouse, including painting coaches' offices and
major repairs in locker rooms. One of the Cunningham fields will also be
reconditioned for better drainage, and the Dellmuth-Rath facility at
Cunningham will be renovated to include heat, showers, and hot water.
Although plans for major renovations would depend on whether or not
plans for a hotel on the athletic fields move forward, Williams said they have
discussed possibilities such as installing lights on the Clothier fields.
Besides these more tangible changes, the ARC this semester is addressing the role of athletics in campus culture, including the perceived stereotyping of athletes an issue that both coaches and student-athletes stressed
was an important one. The ARC will "propose to the board strategies that
would help [student-athletes and those who participate in sports and other
members of the community not involved in athletics] "to come to a more
mutual understanding about the role of athletics here."
Student ARC member Mark Dingfield said the committee is looking at
ways to "bridge the disconnect between athletics and academics," perhaps
by holding joint events between these two communities such as workshops
on sports psychology. "The idea is to emphasize the common ground between
the athletic community and the academic community," Dingfield said^
The committee has also surveyed student athletes as well as academic
departments about this scheduling conflicts between athletics and other activities. Keith who feels that there is "a really serious problem" with scheduling, said the curriculum committee has agreed to take on this issue.
In addition, the committee has met with members of club sports and representative of the newly formed Student Athlete Athletic Committee, which
provided input to the ARC from the intercollegiate athletic teams.
This weekend, the ARC will recommend to the board that the committee
continue for another year; Keith said she is not yet sure what her role will be
in the committee when steps down from her position as provost at the end of
this year.
President Bloom felt that the ARC'S work is "moving at a very productive
pace." "I'm very satisfied with the progress so far. The committee and I are
committed to building an athletic program that will consistently offer the
quality of competitive experience and the satisfaction from it that our stu-

dents deserve," he said.

Mind The Light, administrators comment on potential dialogues
From ATHLETICS, pg. 14
he said.
Moore, however, worried that "students
who would be very valuable to the community could be scared offby the letter." He feels
thatprospective students cannot understand
the issue in its entirety because they do not
have sufficient context, that is, an understanding of the culture of Swarthmore and
an awareness of the "other side of the story."
Although several students said that they
are unclear as to exactly what Mind The
Light is trying to accomplish, Robinson said
in a telephone interview that the
organization's more specific goals are still
in the development stage. They include educating the members of the Swarthmore community about the flaws in the process and
substance of the decision; encouraging the
board and the administration to have an
open dialogue on the issue; reaffirming the
college's stated mission, which Robinson
feels has been changed without discussion
of the entire community; reexamining admissions policies that Robinson feels do not
strike a balancebetween extracurricular and
academic interests; changing the slot system,

whichRobinson feels is a "disaster" because

it does not look at the whole individual; work-

ing with the schools in NESCAC and the Centennial Conference to address the issues in

Shulman and Bowen's "The Game of Life;" a
book addressing the issue ofathletics and elite
colleges, and working for a stronger voice for
Alumni Council.
In a telephone interview, Robinson said he
believes most MTL members are upset with the
process by the decision itself, the process by
which it was made, and most significantly by
the its aftermath and what he feel is an "abject
failure of leadership" on the part of the college.
He says thatmembers ofthe administrationand
the board have not responded personally to his
letters of concern and in short "have been nonresponsive to the college's efforts to all attempts
to discuss dialogue in an open forum or, more
importantly, in an open forum," according to an
e-mail sent to The Phoenix several weeks ago.
Responding to Robinson's statement, Bloom
said, "I'm sorry that he is disappointed, but I
feel the administration has been as responsive
as it can be while fulfilling its obligation to govern the college and build its future." The college received approximately 1300 letters regarding the decision.
Nancy

Bekavac, a member of the Board of

Managers, said that between whenthe decision
was made and the end ofFebruary, she has personally responded to 'at least 70 e-mails and

probably more," writing five or six e-mails daily
and having 'a pretty extensive discussion" with

some alumni.
She said she has corresponded eight or 10
times with Robinson, responding to almost everything she received from him. Bekavac feels
that the deeper issue is that "we don't do what
they want us to do and we don't see things the
way they see them
and we don't."
When probed about his contact with board
members, Robinson did say hehad a correspondencewith Bekavac and that she was "the only
board member who had responded in true listening fashion."
Asked how she is approaching MTL, Provost
JennieKeith said, "I am a Quaker myself and
partly because ofthis I'm trying very, very, very
hard to understand how this decision looks to
people in that organization and to respect their
concerns for the college."
Bloom and Larry Shane, chairman of the
Board ofManagers, said they are making efforts
to engage alumni. After discussing plans for
outreach with the executive committee of
alumni council in February, members of the

board and administration will be meeting in
June with three groups ofalumni in New York,
Washington and California. Bloom said he has
also been having small group meetings with
small groups of alumni around the country.

Shane said that one of the items on the

agenda of this weekend's board meeting will
be to discuss ideas for reaching out to MTL

members and other concerned alumni. "It's
time to step this process up," Shane said.
Asked how the decision has affected
fundraising efforts among alumni, Vice
PresidentofAlumniRelations DanWest said,
"Yes, the decision certainly has affected
fundraising in that it's diverted time and
energy [responding to alumni reactions] but
no, it doesn't seem to have detractedfrom or
undermined seriously the effort."
The capital campaign is "still very much
on track," according to West, with $9O million raised toward a goal of $lOO million in
September, whenthe $230 million campaign
will be announced publicly. The annualfund
is $25,000 ahead of the amount pledged at this
timelast year, though the "participation rate

is somewhat behind what it was at this time
last year and we fully expect that it's going
to be down, but we don't know how much."
"Less than a handful" of alumni have
taken back their contributions, according to
West, with two significant pledges withdrawn. "As far as anyone who earliermade
a pledge and then wanted to cancel it, I think
we're talking about five or six people," he
said.

Communication with admissions cited as strengthening factor
From COACHES, pg. 15
it might have been slightly lowerbecause athletes, who have

contact with coaches, tend to yield at a higher rate.
Bock stressed that there is no limit to the number ofathletes on campus, only to those who receive preference during the admissions process because of their athletic talent.
He said that while the admissions office would continue to
work within the 10 to 15 percent constraint, exactly where
within this range could change depending on team needs.
"I think [lO to 15 percent] figure is appropriate for
Swarthmore, and leaning toward 15 percent was appropriate given the year," he said.
Asked whether the 15 percent figure was sufficient, Williams said, "We certainly wish we had a few more but that's
the range we were given to work with and that we have to

make work." Williams said that this year the athletic department was able to work effectively with 15 percent. However, he felt that this percentage cannot be decreased. "That's
the end we need to work with to be successful," he said "If
we have to move, we have to move forward." Williams said
"only time will tell" if 15 percent proves adequate.
Davis noted that the admissions process seemed to be
more "objective" this year in that they seemed to adopt a
more holistic approach toward evaluating prospective students. "While I fully used all of the slots allocated for swimand wished I had more
a number of quality stuming
dent athletes (three swimmers) were accepted this year based
on admissions seeing them as an important potential addition to the studentbody here, withoutathletic ability being
an important factor." Calling this a positive development,
Davis said, "in general, in the last two years, very few quality, yieldable student athletes were admitted without slots."
Basically if a student was an athlete, we needed to usea slot.
She still feels that the number of slots allocated to her teams
is insufficient as it is very unlikely to have a 90 percent matriculation rate.. "It comes down to a pure numbers game,"
said Davis, who must yield five to six student-athletes each
year for each of her teams. "If I yield 50 percent of the number of slots that I have it is insufficient. If what happened this
year in admissions continues, and we're dealing with talented
student-athletes admitted above and beyond the slot allocation, then that sheds a little light on the horizon."
However, she said, "if you're going strictly by the percentage, [l5 percent] is too low to have an adequate number
of slots each year for the current 21 intercollegiate teams."
Davis said coaches will submit a "state of sport" report
about their teams, which includes information regarding
yield. The allocation of "slots" will change from year to year

based on yield, need, and competitive records.
As for this year's admissions results, Bock said he has
not yet looked specifically at the yield of student-athletes.
Of the small percentage of the overall admitted pool that

16

MAY 03. 2001

THE PHOENIX

had responded by last Friday, about 50 percent had accepted
offers ofadmission. Bock said that this was ahead of the overall yield last year, but that it was too early to tell what kind of
effect the board's decision might have had on yield. "So far
things look great," said Bock, who will make a report to the
Board of Managers this weekend on behalf of the ARC.

Asked about the numbers of student-athletes who have committed to Swarthmore, Williams said, "Knock on wood, the yield
has been pretty good so far." He also said that coaches had to
deal with many questions from prospective students about the
board's decision.
Interviews with individual coaches revealed variation
among teams in terms of both yield and the extent to which
coaches felt that their recruiting was impacted by the decision
to cut programs.

Carroll said the decision did not come up in his discussions
withprospective studentsand overall did not seem to affect the
pool of applicants, although he received fewer inquiries about
certain event groups, such as throwing and sprinting, which
tend to crossover with football. "I didn't personally get a call
back from a prospective student saying 'You dropped football,
wrestling, badminton and I'm concerned you don'tsupport athletics,'" he said.

Carroll said that while about 80 percent of his program was
unaffected by the board's decision, it could potentially impact
the throwing and sprinting events, which on the men's track
andfield team are "person for person the strongest event group."
Although there was no effect this year, the Carroll predicted that
the cut probably will have some effect next spring. "In a couple
of years, the dynamic of the team could change in terms of
whether or not these types ofathletes will come to Swarthmore
despite the fact that football no longer exists," he said.
But while saying he will miss the senior class, which includes some irreplaceable individuals, Carroll is pleased with
the types of student-athletes coming in and remains optimistic
that "through the continued process of working with admissions, in a few years [the track and cross-country programs]
will be as strong as they've ever been."

Although Williams said the department was initially worried about the cut's effect on thebaseball team, they were pleased
this year to field a squad of 18 to 20 players.
Golf coach Mark Duzenski, who had communication with
the admissions office for the first time, said threeofhis recruits
had committed to Swarthmore a result he said he was happy
with given that only three returning players started the season: "It's the first time I've got a number of guys coming in that
call themselves golfers as opposed to being football players who
play golf or baseball players who play golf," he said.
Wimberly said he had a strong recruiting year; although
one or two recruits made "passing comments" asking if basketball would be next on the chopping block, he did not think the
cut affected any of his recruits' decisions.
The board's decision seemed to have a greater impact on

women's soccer, field hockey, lacrossse and badminton.
Shibles and Brunner said the decision definitely had an effect on their sports because, in the words of Borbee, "the
decision, its aftermath and the discussion presently on campus makes potential student-athletes wonderabout the value
ofathletics here at Swarthmore." Shibles said, "It's important to continue to spread theword that Swarthmore's a place
that encourages students to push themselves in different
ways outside the classroom."
Both Brunner and Shibles thought thatthe decision made
a difference with a couple of individualrecruits.
Brunner said shethinks her yield will be reasonably high
this year, though she is not yet sure whether her team will
be stronger in terms of talent. Shibles declined to comment
on how her team is shaping up, saying she does not yet know.
Borbee said that field hockey is in "pretty good shape"
withfive or six incoming students, though she is "concerned"
about lacrosse. Although she will have a "great" returning
group of students, she said she has not received much positive feedback from prospective students.
When asked how the dropping offootball and wrestling
affected recruiting, Davis fielded questions from som prospective students concerned that if football was dropped,

swimming could be next.
With regard to students in the overall admitted pool (not
just student-athletes), Bock said he had heard of only one or
two students whose decisions might have been affected by
the program cut. "I can live with one or two," he said. "People
choose not to come here for a variety of reasons." He that
only one student and a couple parents asked questions about
the cut during prospective student's weekend. A survey sent
to all admitted students should yield more information on
the possible impact of the cut, Bock said.
Coaches generally felt that they have sufficient opportunity to communicate their wishes to the administration,
though most said it is too early to say how well the college is
doing in terms of addressing specific issues such as recruiting and facilities. A couple coaches declined to comment on
the latter question. Others said they were optimistic that
change will occur.
"At this point I don't see any indication at all that it's
going to be one of those all talk and no action things,"
Wimberly said.
Brunner and Borbee said they hope to see tangible improvements by fall. "A lot of things will come clear in the
next year," Shibles said, pointing out that the college will
appoint a new dean ofadmissions and associate athletic director. "The process can't happen overnight. It's going to
take constant focus. It's going to take time."
"Hopefully," Carroll said, "someone will come back in 12
or 24 months time and ask these same questions so we can
respond with better knowledge as far as our critique is con-

cerned."

Ellipsis goes out with a bang
BY MORGHAN HOLT
The first and only time I saw ellipsis perform before Friday's
farewell concert in Mephistos was at the Rose Tattoo Cafe sometime last spring. I knew Vale Jokisch 'Ol, one of the three band
members, from working with her in the Admissions Office, and
was intrigued by thefact that she was in a band. But I'd only known
her in the context of the Admissions Office, which does not exactly present a great opportunity to familiarize oneself with the
many talents of one's co-workers. We'd talked, of course, but it
was mostly about classes and majors and other time-filling fluff.
Mostly, we just filed application material in silence. I anticipated
ellipsis' performance on the basis of the Vale I knew: the seemingly reserved, headphone-wearing student worker.
Needless to say, I was floored the first time I saw her take the
microphone. I wasn't expecting the intense, throaty voice that
flooded Paces. I wasn't expecting to be completely caught up in
her quivering chords and fluctuating tones. But I was.
The first ellipsis performance I saw was utterly intoxicating. I
was stunned by Vale's hidden talentand impressed by the band in
general. Matt Murphy 'Ol had great stage presence and Joel Price
'OO played the violin
which I'd previously presumed a pretty
boring instrument like I'd never imagined it could be played. I
didn't know then that they'd recorded an album or I would have
bought it. They were that good.
This year passed quickly and, work not permitting, it didn't
allow me the chance to see ellipsis in concert again
until their
final performance as Swarthmore students (well, for Matt and Vale,
anyway) last Friday night. I was ecstatic for the listening opportunity, but bummed because I knew this would be the last time.
But they're planning on staying together and continuing to
record. In fact, they're recording their sophomore album in LPAC
later this month. "Insomniac Dance" should be available for purchase by the end of the summer, and based on the sneak peek provided during Friday's concert, I fully intend to add it to my collection.
ellipsis opened their show immediately and without introduction, picking up their instruments and plunging right into a series of songs from their 2000 album, "and so 0n...." Joel and Matt
dominated the vocals for the first two songs and apologized in advance for Vale's sickness-constrained vocal capacity before she
stepped to themic and wowed the audience with her versatile voice
in "Move On." If Vale was truly sick, no one in the audience could
tell; it certainly wasn't audible in her voice, and, if indeed it had
been hindering her performance, she's even better thanI'd remem-

bered.
Starting at 8 p.m. and ending shortly after 10:30, the concert
was much longer than I'd anticipated, but I was glad for its duration. I wouldn't have been content to leave after an hour and, even

after absorbing two and a halfhours of captivating entertainment,
I would have happily accepted more if they'd continued playing
when I finally got up to leave.
ellipsis played a ton of original work, much of it new to the
Swarthmoreaudience: the unreleased songs from their future CD,
and some of it familiarly catchy, compelling the audience to provide Vale, Matt and Joel with broken backup. The fluidity of the
lyrics and the ease with which they matched the music impressed
me, mostly because the lyrics are particularly well-written and it
is more often the case that bands with lyrical genius struggle
musically than that theyproduce genuinely enjoyable music that's
also profound. But ellipsis does it, and does it well, even experimentally, as evidenced by Joel's project "Tarantelle," which Matt
sang and the band played incredibly smoothly.
Throughout the show, ellipsis consistently demonstrated their
multi-faceted abilities, proving that their talents are hardly onedimensional. Covering artists from Tracy Chapman to the
Barenaked Ladies to even Guns N' Roses, the band jumped effortlessly from one genre to the other, even occasionally succumbing
to Joel's warranted "show-off bluegrass bits.
In short, ellipsis' final performance as Swatties was excellent
and provided unwavering quality entertainment, both musical and
comedic, as they filled the empty, instrument-switching/tuning
moments between songs with humorous jibes at each other and at
the audience. I was reluctant to leave Mephistos after the show,
wondering if I'd ever be lucky enough to have my ears fullofVale's
throbbing voice, Joel's skillful improvisational fiddling or Mart's
lyrical creations again. I've since been comforted by forcing myself
to remember that they'll soon be releasing an album that I can play
on repeat to my heart's content and that they're planning on sticking together beyond the bounds ofthe bubble, which means it's possible they'll return to Swat to play as a real-world band at some
point in the future. Until then, all I can do is thank them for an
amazing show and wish them well in their upcoming endeavors.

How do you audition to play God? With only ancient
myths and Scripture to work with, how do you approach
playing a Prophet or Chosen One without creating a caricature? Method acting, the creation of habits and attitudes within a role, is tough given the abstract and revered nature of mythic figures. Gods and prophets are
our best and worst roles, providing infinite room for
imagination, but a total lack of characterization.
D irecting 111 students Kiran Rikhye and Jon Stancato
alternated between comedy and drama in previous productions, but for their final production this weekend,
"Mythology in Flux," each tackled a myth. Their two
ensembles have reworked ancient tales, adding improvised dance movement and finding personal modern connections. Their efforts take the audience into two ancient worlds: Stancato's "Testing Abraham" and
Rikhye's "Persephone Doubled."
Rikhye chose the Greek myth of Persephone, the offspring of the incestuous interaction of Zeus (Hunter
Wells 'O2) and Demeter (Heather Weyrick '01), the harvest goddess. Persephone (Emine Fisek 'O3/Adrienne
Mackey 'O4) is snatched away by lovestruck Hades
(Wells), God ofthe Underworld. In grief, Demeter curses
the earth, creating Winter, a time without harvests. In
response, Hades and Zeus agree that Persephone will
return to her mother for two-thirds of the year. During

the third, she will remain in the Underworld and Win-

ter will fall over Earth.
Rikyhe's ensemble evokes the emotions of the piece
using physical movements of Contact Improvisation.
The four actors go beyond mere narrative with comedic

sequences that reflect themes ofharvest and death. For
the harvest, the ensemble riffs on varieties of squash
with quotes from "The Joy of Cooking," and, for death,
reports bizarre statistics in a tragicomic style. The sequences demonstrate just how much ancient myth can
be manipulated. Rikhye's ensemble faces the added chal-

lenge of making sure the audience comprehends the
Greek myth, a mythology that is not popularly known.
The actors must ensure that the story remains clear to
the audience even as they experiment within its themes.
Stancato's ensemble, however, has the freedom to chal-

lenge the audience as they perform the familiar Old Testament tale of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham (Steven
Salter 'O2), is summoned by God (Felicia Leicht 'O4), to
sacrifice his son, Isaac (Carlos Duque 'O3), as a burnt offering. Without question, Abraham takes Isaac into the
hills and ties him to an altar, ready to kill his trembling
child. Suddenly, God proclaims that Abraham's willing-

ness has proven his faith, and God blesses him, dismissing the execution. In gratitude and utter terror, Abraham
and Isaac head home to Abraham's wife Sarah (Sarah
Yardney 'O2), their familial love seemingly shattered.
The actors and director agreed that the best way to
build trust in each other and to revitalize the tale was
through the use of personal stories. Each actor tells
stories of when they felt like Abraham, Isaac and God,
in the Biblical context. These short monologues, what
Stancato calls "emblem" pieces are what makes "Testing Abraham" stand apart from previous versions of
the same tale.
For the first emblem, Salter proclaims, "Then I was
Abraham." He then proceeds into his personal story
until he hits the pivotal line: "I promised I wouldn't,
but I did it anyway." All four actors then converge for
an improvised war over his words, an adaptation of
Joseph Chaikin's Open Theatre performance style. The
actors push and pull each other, at first playfully, then
brutally. Their bodies linked, the actors caress, attack,
join and break each other down as they repeat and rework every word of Salter's line. The three emblems
take similar lines through a hundred variations of motion and language.
Later, amidst preparations for the execution, the actors turn to a powerful sequence ofnear-execution from
Elie Wiesel's Holocaust tale, Night, that emphasizes
modern day senseless executions. A Hebrew hymn invoked at the opening and close reiterates how closely
the play relates to Jewish bloodshed today, human sacrifices made over the very same holy land where
Abraham nearly slaughtered his only son. Through
such sequences, the ensemble invokes the chilling question of what warrants human sacrifice.
Prepare yourself for a barrage of gods, myths and
morality gone mad this Saturday night at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 2 in the Frear Theatre, LPAC.

Radiohead latest original
BY ANDREW STOUT

Radiohead wants you to know: the band is not coming back.
The British group turned contemporary notions of rock music upside-down
with its fourth album, "Kid A," released last October. Its distorted, psychotic
beauty earned it several Grammy nominations and widespread market
success, but left some critics scratching their heads. Radiohead abandoned
not only genre norms, but also the guitar-heavy sound that spawned the
success of 1997's "OK Computer."
There had been rumors that Radiohead's fifth album, "Amnesiac," would
be a return to normalcy: more traditional, guitar-oriented, and radio-friendly.
But it's clear that the band has no
intentions of doubling back on the
creative path they worked so hard
to forge. The material for
"Amnesiac" comes from the same
series of recording sessions that
yielded "Kid A," and the fifth album
is as forward-thrusting and original
as the fourth.
Like "Kid A," the music of
"Amnesiac" involves a lot of
distortion, layered sampling, and
other nontraditional effects.
"Amnesiac" displays more diversity

than "Kid A," however. It is clear
from the wide variety of songs that
Radiohead is seeking to
incorporate many disparate
influences —from middle-eastern
rhythms to jazz into their

revolutionary, evolving sound.
Radiohead.
"Amnesiac" won't hit stores until
June 5, but an advance has been
released. The album opens with steelpan break-drum beats, then slips into
the same melodious synth sound that gave "Kid A" its immediate intrauterine
feel. "Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box" is a bit more up-tempo than
"Everything In Its Right Place," and with a more familiar time signature and
more distinguishable beat, it is more accessible. The drawback of the
opening of "Amnesiac" is that it lacks the immediate sense of enveloping
atmosphere that Radiohead's other albums boasted. "Packt" also hints at
what Radiohead thinks of the music industry machine and popular press.
"I'm a reasonable man / Get off my case," sings lead singer Thorn Yorke.
"After years of waiting nothing came / And you realize you're looking...,
looking in the wrong place."
Yorke's yearning vocals on "You And Whose Army?" recall "Karma Police."
If "this is what you get/ when you mess with us" was the voice of dystopia's
Orwellian controlling force, "come on, come on / you and whose army?" is the
drugged, delusional voice of its victim, backed by a poetic organ, piano and

B

string composition.
My favorite track on the advance is "I Might Be Wrong." It starts off with a
bouncing blues/roots-rock guitar hook. It's enough to make one think that
Radiohead has made it back to something vaguely resembling mainstream
until the vocals come in. It sounds like Yorke is singing underwater through
six feet of plastic tubing. This song is slated to be their first single in the

United States, and should hit the airwaves soon.

The first United Kingdom single, "Pyramid Song," is a beautiful piano
requiem, spiced later with strings, bass, snare and polyrhythms.
Another probable candidate for an American single release is "Knives
Out." Never mind that it's about cannibalism. It has one of the most
prominent guitar parts on the album, and some of the clearest vocals as well
in short, it's the most traditional and radio-friendly cut on "Amnesiac."
The album also features an unnecessary recasting of "Morning Bell." The
new version is more recognizable than commentary led me to expect. The
unchanged lyrics drag along a track that sounds like a music box running
down. That said, it's not bad, but I would have rather seen Radiohead put
one of their better unreleased songs in its place, and release "Amnesiac
Morning Bell" as a B-side.
Amnesiac closes with "Life In A Glass House," in which Yorke soulfully
intones paranoid lyrics over what sounds like a New Orleans funeral
procession. Jonny Greenwood's jazz composition and instrumentation, which
made "The National Anthem" so remarkable, are even more effective here.
"Amnesiac" could probably ride the coattails of "Kid A" to market success,
but it won't need to. In its own right, "Amnesiac" is incredible the first time,
and grows on you with repeated listening. Those who struggled with "Kid A"
will have similar complaints about "Amnesiac," but it isn't "Kid B." "Kid A"
was a creative movement for Radiohead, and Amnesiac is a related, but
independent project perhaps moving in the same direction as "Kid A," but
with distinctive value and features. This will be an album for those whb

appreciate Radiohead's relentless musical courage and innovation with an
open mind.

Summer not for work
BY MORGHAN HOLT
As the semester draws to a close, McCabe is
buzzing with discussion of summer plans.
People have all sorts of impressive internships,
real resume-bolstering opportunities. Others are
volunteering, working with "Habitat for Humanity"-type groups to build homes and otherwise aid the needy. Still others are planning on
spending the summer in classrooms away from
Swat, attempting to get ahead in their academic
plans. And some hardworking Swatties will be
manning the counters at burger joints across
the nation. Specifics aside, it seems we've pretty
much managed to fill our vacations with obligations, deadlines and responsibilities.
And that's all well and good. By nature, most
of us are highly motivated overachievers.

classwork, we're cramming more crap into these
ninety days than can realistically be done in
ninety days, just like we've been doing for the

good that we're inclined

Still, knowing the nature ofmost Swatties, I've
been mildly discouraged
by the unending reports
oflabor-filled summer plans. In the midst of fretting over landing internships that will look good
to future employers or taking classes at other institutions to get them out of the way and prepare
for next semester's intended course-load, I'm
afraid that Swatties have forgotten that, above
all else, the next three months are intended to
provide a much-needed vacation, time free from
stress and overexertion. We've spent the last nine
months agonizing over papers and responsibility, packing our day planners with more stuff
than we can realistically accomplish. We've also
spent the last nine months bitching about how
badly we need a break, even complaining after
spring and fall breaks that the ten-day stretches
were little more than teases, offering just enough
time to alleviate half a semester's worth of sleep
deprivation.

How I learned to stop worrying and love children
there's anything Peter cannot stand, it's the idea thathe might

BY ESTER BLOOM

"How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog" isn't sad in and of
itself. When I saw it at the Philadelphia International Film
Festival, however, the director, Michael Kalesniko, was
present and answered questions from the audience. When
someone asked when the film would be distributed nationwide, Kalesniko's smile drooped.
Apparently, "How to Kill" was produced by a small,
strictly B-movie company that is trying to make it big. So
while Miramax, Lion's Gate and scores of others have ap-

proached the studio to buy the film, the studio won't release it unless whoever is interested also purchases four
other pieces of crap.
So the chances that this movie will see the inside of
mainstream theaters are slim, which is both hard to believe
(it's star-powered by Kenneth Branagh and Robin WrightPenn) and a pity. Although it isn't great, "How to Kill Your
Neighbor's Dog" is incisively funny and enjoyable.
Peter McGowen (Branagh) is a sarcastic, egocentric
writer married to Melanie, a dance instructor (Robin
Wright-Penn in a bizarre black wig, like Uma Thurman's
from Pulp Fiction, only cut off at the ears). They live in
L.A., which explains why Melanie is the size of a halogen
floor lamp and Peter takes such morbid, rebellious pleasure in chain smoking.

About a decade before, Peter had written a series of ex-

tremely successful plays. He was toasted as the rising star
only
of Broadway, America, and by extension the world
now, years later, he's stuck cranking out second-rate material and doesn'tknow what to do with himself. His present
play is being directed by a campy, altogether-out-there cheese
ball (played with typical precision by character actor David
Krumholtz) and acted by two meagerly-talented phonies.
During rehearsals, his face registers a very specific,
unique kind of pain. Not only is the execution of his play
ridiculous, but the play itself is sub-par, and he can tell. If

be mediocre.
In addition, while he and Melanie have a lovely home,

Melanie is attuned to the same biological clock as Bridget
Jones, and with each tick she becomes more insistent on filling the house with children. If there's anything Peter cannot
stand, it's children.
Then on top of that, his neighbors' dog will not stop barking. Peter lies awake night after night, sexually frustrated
because the knowledge that Melanie is attaching procreative
significance to each encounter saps his ability to perform; but,
when on occasion he does manage to doze off, the dog takes
that as its cue to howl. If there's anything Peter cannot stand,
it's... yeah.
Peter's tirades are well-written and scathing and he rattles
off one-liners like a stand-up comic, to the point where I became incredulous that anyone that effortlessly clever could
have such intense writer's block. It's also slightly unbeliev-

able that Melanie is as tolerant as she is. At no point does she
tell Peter she's tired of his navel-gazing, however much it
makes her laugh. She remains the eternally patient, supportive wife, never minding that it doesn't occur to her husband

to ask how she is.
In any event, Peter, on one late night stroll, encounters a
man who claims to be him. This "Peter," his doppelganger, is

an even better audience than Melanie: "Peter" is fixated on
Peter. He copies his actions and speech patterns, and listens
rapturously to Peter's every mundane complaint. Initially,

Kenneth Branaugh stars as sarcastic, egocentric writer
Peter McGowen in the enjoyable "How to Kill your
Neighbor's Dog."

Peter takes him for granted and doesn't think too much about
this, perhaps, is why "Peter" is the person
his ardent fan
who ultimately shocks Peter out of his rut, forcing him to re-

"Private Parts."
Although the film becomes formulaic at times

evaluate his outlook, his decisions, and himself.
Kalesniko, a veteran industry screenwriter and script doctor, authored as well as directed. It comes as no surprise, then,
that "How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog" is a polished indictment of Hollywood as much as a simple comedy, or that in
some parts it's hilarious; Kalesniko's previous credits include

Peter's

descent into mainstream child-worship, for example, is as
subtle as a fall down a flight of stairs
it never loses its
edge. And for that reason, I hope that the studio holding
this film for ransom has a Peter-esque change of heart.
Kalesniko's directorial debut is too impressive to wither
away unseen.

crushing Johns Hopkins' Lauren Shevehik 6-L 6-3 and Muhlenberg's Keri Waldowski 6-0, 6-2. Reddy
continued to the semifinals, facing Washington College's Nekko Browder. After a tough first set, Reddy
defeatedBrowder 7-6 (13-11), 6-L Nearly an hour later, Reddy challenged Haverford's defending champion
and third seed Alyssa Kennedy for the title. Reddy played hard and smart to win the conference singles
championship 6-3, 6-3.

Caroline Celano 'O4 won her first match, pummeling Ursinus' Lauren Thomas 6-L 6-0. In her second
round, Celano fought hard against Browder, but fell in three sets 7-5,5-7, 6-2. Swarthmore's third singles
entry, Kristina Pao 'O4, closed out her grueling match against Dickinson's Melissa Sviatko, winning 6-3,
5-7, 6-4. Pao continued to advance in the draw, defeating second seed Alethea Derosiers from Western
Maryland College 6-4, 6-4. Pao fell in the semifinals in a three set match against Kennedy 4-6, 6-0, 6-3.
The Garnet first doubles team of Jennifer Pao 'Ol and Laura Swerdlow 'O2 hoped to win the doubles
title this year after finishing as runners-up a year ago. After defeating second-seeded Jen Chung and
Mackenzie Parke 8-2, Pao and Swerdlow played with confidence and patience to advance to the semifinal
round, where they dominated Franklin and Marshall's Pam Hillock and Alissa Leone 8-L In the longawaited final match, the Garnet faced first seed Nekko Browder and Shoko Nakamura from Washington
College. In a tough two sets, the Garnet fell to the Shorewomen 6-3, 6-4.
The other Swarthmore doubles team of Reddy and Celano easily defeated their first-round opponents
8-2, but faced Washington's duo in the second round. Browder and Nakamura defeated the Garnet 8-5.
This weekend's tournament proved quite successful. The ladies' team is awaiting an invitation to the
Atlantic South Regional portion of the NCAA Division 111 National Championships; invitations as well
as locations of the host sites will be announced May 7.

BY PAYAL SHAH
This past Saturday, the women's rugby team once again piled into their
vans at the crack of dawn. This time they were on a three-hour drive to the
middle of Pennsylvania and Bucknell University. Over 12 hours later, the
women returned from their last game of the season, now with two more victories, three scoring seniors, and a van full of happy ruggers.
The A-side game was slightly altered from its usual course because of a
field that for somereason was narrower than regulations. However, to cries of
"Butt F*cknell," the team psyched up for their last game. The seniors espe-

cially showed they had something to prove. Captain and scrumhalf Nancy Craig
'Ol was instrumental in several key plays, quickly getting the ball out to flyhalf
Cathy Vaughan 'OL Over the past four years, the two have developed an unbeatable connection that is now a legacy among Swarthmore ruggers.
Maya Peterson 'O2 started the game off on the right foot, taking the ball
into the try zone after a strong play by the forwards, especially by quick-aslightening Erica Anderson 'Ol and Siobhan Carty 'OL Despite several Bucknell
attempts to gain control of the ball, Swarthmore maintained possession for
what was mostly an offensive game.
Although Bucknell did score one try, the A-side backline regulated the situation. Within minutes, a quick pass from Laura Blume 'Ol got the ball out to
wing and back captain Emily Wilkins 'OL Wilkins ran the ball past the big but
slow Bucknell girls, and directly into the try zone. Craig took the kick, making
a conversion that ended the game at a 12-5 victory for Swarthmore.
B-side played an equally strong game, shutting out Bucknell's large but
unpolished team. The back line dominated on the field, constantly sprinting
past the sluggish Bucknell backs and forwards. Flyhalf Kirsten "Kiki"

on a scissor, which allowed Ford to run the ball right up to the try zone.
Carty stepped in for an injured B-side player and took the ball into the try
zone. Joanne Jacobson 'O3 was instrumental in tackling, as was captain Jessie

Warmothers siege
Pennsylvania
BY MARAH GOTCSIK AND CAROLYNN LAURENZA

For the first time this spring, the Warmothers
stepped onto the field and were able to see their
opponents clearly, unobstructed by sheets of rain
or sleet or their breath from the cold. What time
was it? Game time. Sectionals time.
The tournament, located at Haverford, began
with pool play on Saturday, April 28. The 'Moms
went 3-1, shutting out Haverford 13-0 and beating
the University of Pennsylvania 13-3. Alison
Landrey 'O4 wowed all in attendance by
completing more scores than most thought
physically possible.
Competition stiffened against Penn State, but
in the true spirit of "el smack down," they were no
match for Swarthmore in the end: final score 13-7.
The final match of the day was against Bucknell,
an awesome team that the Warmothers had yet
to beat this season. The Mothers fell 13-6 in a
game that, though good spirited, was
nonetheless slightly disappointing for the team.
Unfortunately, that night a few Warmothers
agreed to go out to dinner with Bucknell, where
cheer-writer extraordinaire Marah Gotcsik 'O2 ate
some not-so-tasty eggplant parmesan, and was
unable to play the following day. Although rumors
abounded about the friendly rivals slipping
something in her food, they are (as of yet)

unconfirmed.
Swat returned to Haverford on Sunday, April 29
vengeful and focused. Carnegie Mellon was the
first to experience the power of the "steam roller"
in the last round of pool play. Deserving MVP of
the game Joanne Gaskell 'O3 caught at least eight
scores in the endzone: final score 13-0.
Coming into the championship bracket, the
'Moms sat in a three-way tie for first place and
were set to play Penn State in the semi-finals.
After proving themselves 13-8, they prepared to
take the field for finals against Bucknell. Finding
themselves down 8-4 at the half, the Warmothers
came together as a team for an impressive 15-12
victory, holding on to last year's sectionals crown
and providing them with the first seed at MetroEast (which-includes New York, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland) Regionals.
Everyone in attendance had phenomenal play.
Carolynn Laurenza 'O3 and Jenny Hoedeman 'Ol
jumped to heights that most people cannot reach
on a step ladder. Sanya Carley 'O3 (now back 100
percent after surgery) and Alyssa Bell 'O3
handled the disc like pros. Sarah "Stan" Stanton
'O3 and Sierra Curtis-McLaine 'O2 made
awesome cuts all over the place. Sara Kates'o2 demonstrated what defense is
supposed to look like, point-blocking Bucknell's
star handler and also stopping a huck (a wicked
hard full-field throw) with her bicep and face. Ask
her about the bruise. Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol
proved just why she is the team's Callahan
nominee (the Callahan is ultimate's version of
the Heisman trophy) with her impressive ability to
throw the disc beautifully to cuts anywhere on
the field and all-around strong play.
This weekend, the Warmothers will travel to
Regionals at Princeton. They think that you
should, too, for many reasons, including: it's not
too far away, you're done with classes, you want
to be outside on a beautiful spring weekend
watching hundreds of hot college men and
women sweating and flying (and Swarthmore is
known to be one of the hottest teams in the
country, as well as one of the best) and finally,
this is your last chance of the year to see what
the hell is so special about ultimate, anyway.

Baseball ends season on positive note
BY FRANK MARTINEZ

The Swarthmore baseball team lost some of the momentum
that it had gained last weekbut still ended the season on a positive note. Finishing with a poor overall record of 5-20, the team
nevertheless finished .500 over its last six games.
The first two games played last week were more frustrating
than productive. On Thursday, April 26, the team traveled to
Muhlenberg to make up a game that had been rained out three
weeks earlier in the season. Finishing up his fifth year in the
Swarthmore program, Head Coach Frank Agovino was anxious to get the albatross of Muhlenberg off his neck. The Mules
are the only team that Swarthmore has not beaten over the last
half decade.
Ending that streak will have to wait until next year, as
Swarthmore lost 14-9. The score indicates a closer game than
the one actually played. Swarthmore gave away an early lead
of 13-1, and only then managed to put up some runs against the
Muhlenberg reserves to make the score respectable. With no
Swarthmore players stepping up with a particularly big day,
the game was a waste.
After playing so well the previous week and then not showing up at Muhlenberg, the team placed extra importance on the
season-ending double header, hosting rival Haverford College.
In addition to the rivalry and the closeness of the Hood Trophy
race, the baseball team did not want to lose the progress for
which it had worked so hard. The last day of the season is the
most memorable, so the team wanted a positive performance
to leave the young team hungry for next season.
Even with a lot offans in the stands and g food-grilling by
the bench, game one proved to be a debacle for the Garnet. Starting pitcher Matt Goldstein 'O4, after throwing two consecutive
two-run complete games, was not at his best. With little run
production, Swarthmore soon let the game get out of reach
against probably the weakest team in the Centennial Conference. As the game progressed, the entire group hitters, pitchers, fielders, and coaches were frustrated. The game and mood
turned as ugly as the final score, 15-1
Fortunately Swarthmore came back in game two with renewed enthusiasm and intensity. James Zvokel 'O4 got his second win in a row and cemented himself as a legitimately effective starting pitcher. Swarthmore went up early and seemed to
-

tack on extra runs each time the Fords got within striking distance. At the end of the day, Swarthmore won the second game
8-6, thanks to timely hitting and some great glove work, flashed
by middle infielders Wes Sconce 'O4 and Jon Konits 'O4.
Again, the offense hinged on the sizzling bats of Scott
Kushner 'O2 and freshman sensation Ryan Pannorfi 'O4. With
one out in the thirdinning, Kushner doubled downthe left field
line and soon scored off Pannorfi's two run homer, the first of
his collegiate career. They were followed by hits by Josh
Lindsey 'Ol, Mat Rapoza 'O3, Ryan Chahrour 'O4 and Wes Sconce
'O4, en route to a 5-run inning. In the sixth inning, Kushner
launched his fourth round-tripper of the year into deep left center to put the Garnet up for good.
What made the home runs so amazing was how hard each
ball was hit. Swarthmore is the only conference team without
a legitimate outfield fence, so in order to hit a home run, the
ball must be hit far enough so that the runner can run around
all the bases before the fielders get the ball to the plate.
Kushner's shot, in particular, was easily the farthest hit ball of
the year as it fell just short of the PPR parking lot. Kushner
finished 3 for 4 and Pannorfi closed out his rookie season with
a perfect 4 for 4 performance at the plate.
Statistically, the triumvirate of Kushner, Pannorfi, and
Lindsey proved to be a potent combination all season. Kushner
hit .344 from the leadoff spot, leading the team in runs scored
(21), RBI (14), hits (31), doubles (6), homers (4) and slugging percentage (.544). Pannorfi led the team in batting average (.388),
stolen bases (7), and on-base percentage (.438) and was second
in runs (15) and slugging percentage (.522). Lindsey was second
on the team with a .361 average, 30 hits, and 12 RBI. Each of
these players has a chance at all-conference honors, which will
be announced next week.
After sweeping Haverford to end the season for the past two
years, it was a bit disappointing, especially for the few upperclassmen, to split against the rivals this year. Regardless, the
second game was a solid effort. This season was a rebuilding
year in every sense as most of the players were making their
collegiate debuts. While the team can play better, a young team
is bound to have its ups and downs. Next year, with the addition ofwhat looks to be a talented class of 2005, the Garnet will
have the opportunity to propel themselves towards consistent
and competitive play.

Club sports offer athletes flexibility, independence
BY ANNA MASILELA
You're finally out of the house. You wake up when you want to, you eat when you want
to, and you shower when you want to. You pick and choose your classes according to your
tastes, and you participate in the activities that you feel most accurately reflect your complex characteristics. In short, you're making all the decisions and trying to pay at least
some of the bills.
So why in the world did you sign yourself up for something that requires you to give up
some of that newly-minted freedom and be lorded over by someone who reminds you of
Sgt. Hartman from "Full Metal Jacket" more and more as each day of the season wears on?
!
Why, in other words, would you play a varsity sport? That is a question that some students have answered by signing up instead
for club sports, including men's and
women's rugby, men's volleyball and men's

THESE PLAYERS DON'T
WANT A COACH TELLING
THEM WHERE TO BE,
WHO WILL PLAY AND
WHAT TO WEAR.

and women's ultimate frisbee.
Whether they are defectors from the varsity sports system or newbies who never
wanted to be part of that system in the first
place, club sport players are a force on campus that is proud of taking on extra responsibility in order to retain the independence
to which they have grown accustomed.
These players don't want a coach telling them where to be, who will play and what to wear
and they're willing to pay club dues out of pocket, fundraise, and organize each game
themselves in order to have a bigger say in how their sport is run.
There are definite advantages to participating in club sports, not the least of which is
the flexibility. Practices are usually held three or four times each week, and captains are
understanding if their players occasionally miss practice. The captains, who are the main
decision-makers on each team, understand that different players have varying levels of
commitment to the team. This creates opportunities for players of all abilities to contribute to the team according to the amount of time they put in.
An even more obvious advantage forathletes who participate in club sports is the complete integration of the athletic and the social. This is not an option for varsity athletes,
who must separate the two because of closer administrative oversight. However, this lack
of administrative interference is also a main source of some of the difficulties facing clubs
sports. The planned construction over the next few years is creating a space crunch and
club teams, priority-wise, are at the end of the line. With less than a month left in the
school year, the rugby teams still do not know where they will be playing next fall, after
their current field near DuPont is leveled for science center construction.
But the women's rugby team has not lacked support from athletics, said team cocaptain Nancy Craig 'OL "Everyone I've talked to has been committed to getting us a
field," said Craig. "We just don't know where that will be."
The Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union (EPRU), the oversight body for college rugby
in the area, has started requiring coaches for all teams. That's another cost that the
rugby team has had to cover, since the athletic department pays solely for the athletic
trainers who are present at games and practices.
For the frisbee teams, the perennial complaint is the quality of Mertz field. Its usually
lumpy surface is now covered with fresh wounds.
The main difference between varsity and club sports, however, is the fact that the
athletic department does not directly fund club sports, although it does offer the same
insurance coverage and access to the training room, according to athletics administrative assistant Marian Fahy. A season of a varsity sport cost can cost the Athletic Department between $5,000 and $15,000. These figures exclude the salaries of coaches and their
assistants. Club sports, on the other hand, receive the majority of their funds from the

The athletic department does not fund club sports, including women's rugby, pictured
above. Each club team costs about $3,000 a season to operate.
Student Budget Committee (SBC). The money received from SBC helps the women's rugby
team pay its coach a small honorariumand covers the cost of EPRU membership as well
as the registration fee for USA Rugby. The cost of the team, including the coach's salary,
totals about $3,000 per season, according to treasurer Rabi Whitaker 'O3. The socials are
paid for by fundraisers, including the Dash for Cash, and by club dues paid out-of-pocket
by members.

The overall cost is similar for women's frisbee, according to captain Jenny Hoedeman
'Ol, and is also largely covered by SBC. Funding for nationals, which has been around
$lO,OOO in the last two years because of the transportation costs involved, has been covered
by a combination of money from the Deans' Office and the Office of the President. But
there is a possibility that this alternative source of funding may not be available to club
teams any more. SBC periodically raised the possibility of shifting club sport funding to
to the athletic department. A report authored by the Aththe tune of $25,000 each year
letic Review Committee, which will be presented to the Board of Managers this weekend,
according to student member Sarah Jay 'Ol, could also recommend changes to better support the club sports program, potentially changing the monetary structure.
For the time being, however, club sports offer an alternative to the varsity program
that has been attracting about 10 percent of the school each year. Sure, there is an increased responsibility load and the future may not be on the most even ground (or even
any ground at all), but playing club sports means playing in an atmosphere that is in
many ways independent of non-player supervision. And for some Swatties, that's where
the real game is.

Swat runners fare well at UPenn tourney
Agunloye, Jeuland qualify for NCAA Division 111 Nationals
BY MARK JANOFF

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

Joe Makin keeps pace with a pack of Haverford runners.

The outdoor track and field team wrapped up its regular-season schedule last weekend at the University of
Pennsylvania's 107th Penn Relays tournament. This year,
the four-day tournament attracted over 200 colleges and
universities representing all levels ofNCAA competition.
Swarthmore participated in a limited number of races,
but the runners fared well. In the women's 5000-meter,
Joko Agunloye 'Ol automatically qualified for the NCAA
Division 111 National Championships with a time of 17:20.
Agunloye recently qualified for Nationals in the 10,000meter at Moravian College's Greyhound Invitational.
At the Penn Relays, Marc Jeuland 'Ol provisionally
qualified for Nationals with a time of 14:40.77 in the men's
5000-meter. The time was also a Centennial Conference
record. Jeuland, a consistently strong runner throughout the season, credits last summer's coaching change
for helping him qualify for Nationals.
"Hiring Pete Carroll as head coach last summer was
the best decision possible because he knows how to train
runners with a consistent and demanding program,"
Jeuland said. "I never could have made Nationals in cross

country or track without his expert guidance."
The team also fared well at the Widener Invitational
tournament on Saturday, April 2L Representing the men,
Ambrose Dieringer 'Ol continued his strong running with
a time of 2:03.56 in the 800-meter dash. Kwaku Ntoso 'O3
finished eighth in both the 110-meter and 400-meter
hurdles. Jeuland once again finished the men's 1500meter in less than four minutes.
Njideka Akunyili 'O4 placed fourth in the women's 400meter hurdles with a time of 1:08.52. In the women's 400meter dash, Imo Akpan 'O2 placed first with a Nationals
provisional qualifying mark of 57.73. In the field events,
Clara Fuchsman 'Ol placed ninth in the women's shot
put and tenth in the women's discus.
When considering the team's season performance and
its fate, Jeuland said, "I'm proud of the progress of the
underclassmen and their improved work ethic. There are
tough rebuilding years ahead for Swarthmore track and
cross country, but the basis is in place."
The Centennial Conference Championships will take
place at Muhlenberg between May 4 and 6, and Millikin
University will host the NCAA Division 111 Nationals
between May 23 and 26.

Laxers dominate
Fords 21-8, end 10-5

I'm going to share a secret with all ofyou, my friends,
in this, my last submission to The Phoenix. I hope it will
repay my readers for my leaving them at the end of the
semester.
In high school we had 300 characters to say goodbye
in the "Strenuous Life" Roosevelt Roughrider yearbook.
Three hundred characters didn t provide nearly enough
room to convey the loss I felt in saying goodbye to people
I loved.
This column is not nearly enough room either.
It's a beautiful thing to be able to tell a story well.
When I was a second grader, I loved lying on my back
on the blue rug in the back of our stuffy classroom and
listen to Mrs. Ravatt read stories in the afternoon. I can
still remember running my hands through the thick blue
rug and my cautious attempts to inch closer to Jessica

Preg, the prettiest girl in the class.

To those of us that love stories, the storyteller holds
a special place in our hearts.
Often there are things in our lives that recall to us
the stories that are most dear to us, stories from our
own lives. You never know what the great storytellers
in your life will be. A storyteller might be scar on your
chin. It could be something straightforward, like a pho-

tograph.

An old glove used to be able to retell the story of my
baseball career. I'd worn one glove since I was 11, a black
Wilson A2OOO series shortstop glove. That piece of
stitched leather went everywhere with me. From each
all-star game win to every error I had ever committed
in the field, the glove retold every baseball story I'd ever
created. It was with me on Washington back roads as I
traveled to summer tournaments in towns like Yakima
and Walla Walla. It was with me when I gave it up my
senior year of high school to be the team's catcher. I
wrote the history of eight years of my life into that glove.

SOMETIMES YOU LOSE THE
STORIES OF YOUR LIFE
MIDSTREAM. THAT'S UFE.
I lost my glove in the spring of last year. For those of
you that know me
well, I'm sure you're not surprised
that I'd lose something. I don't know how or where I
lost it, but it was a very troubling and emotional loss
for me. I missed it like crazy this season. My replace-

ment glove never felt quite right.

Sometimes you lose the stories of your life mid-

stream. That's life.

But there are some stories you never want to lose.
Those are the stories you need to give to your friends
for safekeeping. Your friends should always be the very
best storytellers in your life.
My advice to you, readers, is that as you go through
life, write your stories on people, as deeply as you can.
Then, maybe, hopefully, somewhere down the road a
friend will retell to you a story that you had lost. And
you'll be able to lie on your back and remember a blue
rug and a beautiful young girl.
You are the author of your own life. It's a beautiful
thing to tell a story well.
I'm going to miss you, sports fans.
As Gerlitz would say: Love life. Laugh a lot. Enjoy
the company of friends.
And don't forget.

Seniors Erika Williams, Amber Adamson, Natania Kremer, Sari Altchuler and Kristen English read along as part of the
Senior Day presentation. They combined for eight goals and three assists in the matchup with Haverford.

The Swarthmore women's lacrosse team finishes the season 10-5
overall and 5-4 in the Centennial Conference, good for a fifth place
conference finish. They await individual post-season honors.
BY KATIE CLOONAN
On Thursday, April 26, the women's lacrosse team stepped
onto Cunningham field with a specific plan of action. What
plan, you may ask? To obliterate their local rivals, the
Haverford Fords.

Accompanied by a rowdy contingent of fans, the Fords
arrived expecting to dominate the matchup and repeat last
year's close 12-10 win over the Garnet. But the Lady Laxers
had a secret weapon, namely better skills. Try as they might,
Haverford watched and never caught up as Swarthmore took
possession of the first draw control. From then on, the Garnet ran with the ball and never looked back.
At intermission, Swarthmore led 12-4 after a nasty halffilled
with Haverford fouls and uncontrolled checks. To pay the Fords
back for their wildly swinging sticks (and theblood drawnfrom
them), the Lady Laxers doled out another eight goals in the
second half, demonstrating remarkable depth as seven different players scored. Katie Tarr 'O2 led the offensive charge as
she scored a season-high eight goals for her
performance. Tri-captain Kristen English 'Ol dominated her final Swarthmore women's lacrosse game with three goals, two
assists, five ground balls, three caused turnovers andfour draw
controls. Jeering and heckling from Haverford fans proved

about as effectual as the Haverford offense, which was limited to a meager four goals in the second half. Netminder
Jenn Hart 'O3 was in charge of the backfield, have a spectacular season finale of 17 saves, tying her career best. The
final score of 21-8 sent the dragging Fords back on their bus
to contemplate and wallow in jealousy.
After her fine efforts as an offense-minded defender, English was recognized on the Centennial Conference Weekly
Honor Roll. Additionally, Tarr topped off the season-end
statistics on the team and in the conference as leading
scorer. Hart joined her on the top of the conference statistic lists as the goalie withthe highest save percentage (59.4).
Mavis Biss 'O2 pulled out 32 goals and three assists, making her 11th in the conference, with English and Erika
Williams 'Ol rounding out the top four team scorers with
25 and 20 goals respectively.
With a solid record of 10-5, 5-4 within the Centennial
Conference, the team is looking forward to next season,
despite the holes that will be left by the graduation of Amber Adamson 'Ol, Sari Altchuler 'Ol, two-time tri-captain
English, tri-captain Natania Kremer 'Ol and Williams. The
Lady Laxers will also greatly miss another integral part of
their game Mr. Bill English, unofficially voted the most
dedicated fan.
