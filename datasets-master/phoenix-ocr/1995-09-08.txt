Swarthmore Ties for Second
Place in U.S. News Rankings
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl
Swarthmore College tied with Williams College for second place in this
year's U.S. News & World Report
rankings of 161 national liberal arts colleges, the magazine announced yesterday. For the thirdyear in a row, Amherst
College received the highest rating.
Swarthmore and Williams had total
scores equal to 99.4 percent of Amherst's
score, well ahead of fourth-place
Bowdoin College, whose total score was
less than 97 percent of Amherst's.
"There is no doubt that we have the
finest students, faculty and educational
program," saidPresident Al Bloom. "We
only have a little more educating of the
outside world to do."
In the 11 years that US. News has

College Mourns Wartenburg's Death
By Elizabeth Weber

When Carl Wartenburg died, on August 9, at the age of 48, Swarthmore lost

who truly believed
in this institution. "He didn't seek the
limelight," said Susan Untereker, Director of Admissions, "but when hehad the
limelight, hemade the most of it And he
never missed an opportunity to include
Swarthmore in such presentations...He
believed thatSwarthmore is thepremiere
liberal arts college in the world."
Wartenburg was especially committed to introducing Swarthmore to firstgeneration college students, international
students, and students from working class
backgrounds, she said, and to increasing
the admissions department's appreciation for the special non-academic disctions of its applicants. He had initi•d a review of all Admissions publications whose first concrete result, a revised version of "Speaking of Swarthmore," came out this week.
"[He] was uniquely effective in bringing our nation's high school students,
their parents and counselors to a deeper
appreciation of the fundamental values
and purposes of quality education," said
President Bloom. "Carl's readiness to
extend trust to others, and to recognize
and reinforce their potential, empowered
every young person he met to be more
personally confident and more committed to realizing their own dreams of significant accomplishment."
"He was a terrifically nice guy," said
Beth Wiles '9B, one of Wartenburg's
advisees.
"Most of all, he was fun," said
Untereker. "He was fun to talk to, and
a Dean ofAdmissions

and he was great fun to work with." Dean
Ngina Lythcott added that he was "an
absolutely extraordinary colleague. In the
short time I worked with him, he was
more than a colleague; he was a friend.
He was a man who loved Swarthmore,
and enjoyed making the right match between Swarthmore and prospective students, and we will miss him."
Wartenburg had been Dean of Admissions since 1994, and Director ofAdmis-

sionsfrom 1993,when he came to S warthmore from Princeton's administration,
until assuming the position of Dean.
He had previously worked in the administrationat Davis and Elkins College,
his alma mater, at Hendrix College in
Arkansas, and he was also appointed as
the first Director of the Arkansas
Governor's School, by Gov. Bill Clinton
in 1980. He held a Master of Divinity
degree from Princeton Theological Semi-

nary and was ordained as a UnitarianUniversalist minister. A nationwide
search for his succesor has already begun, said Untereker.

In addition to his responsibilities at
Swarthmore, Wartenburg was a member
of the Board of Trustees and the Executive Committee of the Princeton Education Center at Blairstown, which operates a summer camp in northwestern New
Jersey for disadvantaged youths. He also
coached youth baseball and soccer, and
served on the boards of the Trenton, NJ
City Museum, the University League,
and the Young Scholars InstituteofTrenton. He was a consultant to the North
Carolina Governor's Instituteof Alcohol
and Substance Abuse and a member of
the Advisory Board of the Recovery Institute of San Francisco as well as the
Board of the Mercer County, N J Council
on Alcoholism.
Lythcott noted Wartenburg "loved the
outdoors; his favorite vacation was to be
in the midst of the awesome beauty of
nature." Wartenburg was on a camping
vacation in Maineat the timeofhis death.
He is survived by two sons, Andrew,

Orientation Gives Frosh a Taste of Swarthmore
Article Written By Cathy Glasheen
Additional Research By
Erik Huneke and Julie Falk
The Class of 1999 was introduced

to

many facets of Swarthmore College life

as they went through Orientation '95
from Tuesday, August 29 to Sunday,
September 3. Along with transfer students and exchange students, the 359
first-years participated in a fun-filled
frenzy of bonding activities, information
sessions, and meetings with deans and
faculty. The week made a terrific impact
on yet another group of enthusiastic
Swarthmore students who were sorry to
see this once-in-a-Swarthmore-career
event conclude.
The Orientation committee included
Stephen Dußois *96, Starr Glidden '9B,
Fernanda Gonzalez '9B, Gena Merliss
'97, TanishaLittle '97, andßahul Sakhuja
'9B. During the spring, the group decided that they each would assume responsibility for the various aspects of the
planning and organization ofOrientation
Week. Merliss said that they intended to
"introduce first-years to [the idea of] the
Swarthmore community as something
different not only from high school and
home, but also from other colleges."
New students said that they were
pleased that there were so many people
available to them as resources during the
week; this was due in part to a new form
ofdepartmental advising which Gonzalez
helped to organize, as well as discussion
groups to which the Deans made themselves available to answer questions. On
a day when students were encouraged to
have lunch with their academic advisors,
professors and upper-class students from
the College's academic departments set
up tables outside of Sharpies to answer

questions and, according to Gonzalez,
help incoming students "feel comfort-

able with academic life at Swarthmore."
Stephanie Wang from New York, NY,
said that she found the tables to be a
valuable resource in preparation for registration.
The first Collection that the Class of
'99 attended was held in the amphitheater and featured Don Shimamoto, Associate Professor and Chair of the Mathematics department, as keynote speaker,
and Andy Feldman '96, president of the
senior class, as an upperclassman speaker.
College PresidentAlfredßloOm and Dean
Ngina Lythcott also addressed the students; Dean Bob Gross' perennial favorite, the "no matter what you say or do to
me..." speech, delivered at the first meeting for all freshmen, received a "thumbsup" from the new Class. After Dean
Lythcott addressed the class, students
broke up into groups of about 20 students
each for discussions facilitated by members of the Deans' Office. In thesegroups,
students were encouraged to get to know
some of the deans as well as ask general
questions about the College. Although
Dean of Students Tedd Goundie was
willing to take even personal questions,
most students had more pressing questions about academic concerns.
Merliss attended to other concerns
during Swat Training, which consisted
of a variety of games. One of them
helped students to feel what it might be
like to be discriminated against by other
members of the community. The "Who
Am I?" game, adopted from CIVIC training, consisted of small groupsof students
trying to guess about a person's personality, interests, and past based solely on
their own experiences. In doing this,
students were meant to realize the ways

in which their prejudices affected how

they might judge and treat other people.

In the "Culture Walk," two lines of
students faced one another; a student
would call out one of their characteristics, and others who shared that characteristic would walk around while the rest
of the students clapped. Merliss felt that
this exercise helped students to recognize "how differentpeople were, but that
there were people in similar situations"
within the group.
Dußois said "a lot of CAs mentioned
to me that attendance at the CA meetings
was really high." This level of concern
was not limited to the regular meetings,

however; a lunch discussion about
multicultural issues which was poorly
attended last year prompted a lively exchange over "people's expectations of
how multiculturalism is discussed," according to Gonzalez.
New students say that the bonding
activities also gave them their first
glimpses of the special closeness of the
Swarthmore community, as well as a
sense that they were already a welcomed
part of it. Jones said that the activity that
most made her feel this way was the
'Trust Walk." Individual CA groups
were blindfolded andledhroughtheCrum
Woods, holding hands. All of the CA
groups met at the Crum Meadow, where
the blindfolds were removed. The group
stood in a circle and each person sat down
in the lap of the person behind them.
Jones describedthe experience as "amaz-

ing."
Members of the new class felt that the
number and variety of activities helped
them to meet other students. "I've never
met so many friendly people in my life,"
said Aarti Iyer of Washington, D:C.

New Registrar to Simplify
Access to Student Records
By Girldhar Srinivasan

Martin O. Warner has joined the College as Registrar, replacing JaneMull ins,
who retired July 1 after a 30-year career
at Swarthmore. Most recently, Warner
was Assistant Registrar and a Student
Advisor at Duke University.
Before holding that position, he
worked at a motley array of jobs, from
truck driver to diner cook. At the age of
thirty, he earned his undergraduate de-

gree inreligious studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Warner's main goal for the next few
years, he says, is to implement the
College's new administrative computing
system for the maintenance of student
records. In addition to storing records in
the system, he hopes to use it to help
students and their advisors get more information about which graduation requirements they've fulfilled. Another
change Warner has initiated is a new
weekly meeting of the staff of the
Registrar's office.
Warner said he wants to assure students thathe will "bring a sense of stability in the management of student records,
despite the presence of a new face... in
the Registrar's office. Things might
change a little in the future, but basic
business is going to remain the same."
A great advocate of volunteer work,
Warner, a Chicago native, often works as
a community mediator, and believes that
"aregular amount of a little volunteering
is an important part of a well rounded
individual," and that it "broadens the
mind in a way that nothing else can."
Warner has also been a blood donor for
the last IS years.
Warner hopes to become an active
member of the college community and
says that he is particularly looking forward to meeting students. NancyOchs of
theRegistrar's office said that "Like Jane,
he's always available to students, and is
a really wonderful person."

Soccer Team Wins 2 of 3 Games
Thompson Assists, Schall Scores Winning Goal in Overtime
By David Lischer

Swarthmore's men's soccer carries a
2-1 record into this weekend's tournament at Elizabethtown. After splitting
two tough matches with Division II opponents Wheeling Jesuit and West

Chester last weekend, the Garnet
squeaked past Holy Family 1-0 on
Wednesday. The goal came on a cross by
Amber Thompson '97 that was netted by
Michael Schall '99 in the first of two 15
minute overtime periods.
The Garnet had the advantage in the
number of quality scoring chances it
earned during the scoreless 90 minutes
of regulation play, while its swift attackers narrowly missed headers on goal.
However, it was the effort of the Garnet
defense, led by Schall and tri-captain
Jesse Murphy '96 that overcame the
sloppy play on both sides to earn the

victory. Goaltender Will Dulaney '97
made a game-saving stop of a breakaway
halfway through the secondhalf. Murphy
returns after missing all of last season
with an injury.
In their first game of the season, the
Garnet defeated Wheeling Jesuit 2-1 on
goals by Thompson andTirian Mink '9B.
Against a stronger West Chester team,
the Garnet played well before giving up
two late goals in the second half. "We
had numerous chances to score ourselves
during the game," said tri-captain Derek
Johnson '96. "We were just unable to
finish our opportunities."
The Garnet's strength this year will be
defense. They have instituted a flat-back
system, where the team plays with two
center fullbacks. The flat-back system is
like a zone defense relying on overlapping coverage among the defenders and
seeking to compress the field and limit

the area the offense has to work in.
Joining Murphy and Schall on the back
line are Johnson, Tirian Mink '9B, and
Alec Stall '9B. Stall is versatile and
provides a strong physical presence. He
is capable of playing wherever the coach
feels the team needs him. Schall has
made an immediate impact and plays
with a poise not seen in most freshmen.
Backing up Dulaney at goaltender is
Andrew Macßeth '99. Macßeth got a
rough initiation in the first game of the
season against Wheeling Jesuit. Dulaney
was ejected for a dangerous slide, and
Macßeth entered the game cold off the
bench to face a penalty shot. The opponent missed the goal completely, and
Macßeth finished the half to help the
Garnet win their first game of the season.

College Hires New Public
Relations Director
By John Freeman

After an exhaustive national search, the College welcomed Tom Krattenmaker onto staff as
its new Director of Public Relations this summer.
Formerly of Princeton University, Krattenmaker
brings 12years of reporting experience to the task
of conveying S warthmore's unique identity to the
media.
Though counterintuitiveto the College's Quaker
tradition, public relations and controlled media
messages have become an integral part of admissions and alumni relations. Barbara Haddad Ryan
'59, Associate Vice President for External Affairs, explained that "liberal arts colleges such as
Swarthmore are all competing for the same market of high achieving students.... Although we
don't have a high priority on promoting ourselves
as a college, it's not feasible to be the best-kept
secret in education."
As the college has learned, achieving accord
with the media can be a difficult process. In
addition to patience and experience, itrequires the
ability to handle almost anything.
Krattenmaker's uniquely checkered past reflects his own patience. A dozenyears ago, he was
a 23-year-old Minnesotan who had missed his
own graduation ceremony for a summer internship at California's third largest daily, the Orange
County Register. As things go in the precarious
worldof journalism,Krattenmaker had gone west
for gold. Krattenmakerreminisces: "Ireally didn't
have anything thing else going at the time. I was
counting on [the internship] to pay off."
Krattenmaker was having a typical intern experience until about two-thirds of the way through the
summer, when an usual but rewarding break came.
It was 9:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening, and he
was almost out the door for a night with some
friends when the telephone rang. Kevin Cooper,

All information presented at the hearing was
carefully consideredbefore the Committee deliberated to reach its findings. The Committee determined that there was evidence of plagiarism, and
therefore reached a finding of guilt on the charge.
The Committee again deliberated in order to
identify appropriate sanctions. Taking into consideration the nature of the incident, the evidence,
and the testimony heard, the Committee decided
to recommend that the paper in question not be
accepted. The Committee further recommended

that the faculty consider allowing the student the
opportunity to complete the requirement to their
satisfaction by this year's graduation. The sanc-

tion was non-notational.
The Committee would like to remind students
that plagiarism is a very serious matter. When a
student is not sure about the College policy's
implications for a particular assignment, it is the
student's responsibility to consult with the faculty
member.

•On Tuesday afternoon, July 11, 1995, the
College Judicial Committee met to consider a
complaint against a student. The complaint was
made by a faculty member; the student was charged
with academic dishonesty. The members of the

College JudicialCommittee were: Professor Robert DuPlessis, Professor Sharon FriedleT, Associate Vice President Lawrence Schall, Franklin
Rubinstein '97, and Andrew Marino '96. The
Committee was convened by Ngina Lythcott.

As the new year dawned and the countdown to
a new millenia fell from seven years to six, a
skeleton was unearthed from the ruins of the
Parrish Annex. Now Kohlberg, the newest albeit
unfinished building at Swarthmore College, is
beginning to put some flesh upon its man-made
bones.
Over the summer, remarkableprogress has taken
shape on the exterior of Kohlberg. Stones and
granite, added to the exterior, have given the
building a more finished look, and the wall facing
the Lang Performing Arts Center is complete. The
pattern of the stones has become more fixed and
less haphazard, and shows up, especially on part
of the wall facing Parrish as well as on the tower.
All that remains'to be added to the exterior of the
tower are the black granite markers. Most of the
windows have been set, but the art glass, although
finished, is pending installation. Concerns have
arisen as to whether the windows might be hit by
flying pieces of stone, causing the delay.
The art glass, better known as the
"stained-glass of the
90's", will decorate a

The pathway between Kohlberg and Lang PAC
has re-opened, and a walkway of wood chips, now

next few months, but is expected to be improved

OPINIONS
Texas: Concealed Weapons and Motives
by Chuck Stevens

One of the appealing things about following
politics is that nifty, semi-instructive events are
nearly always going on somewhere; it just takes a
little persistence (and the patience to read past the
front page of the paper) to find them. Notably, a
recent perusal of a Sunday New York Times
unearthedapiece on the Texas legislature'srepeal
of a law banning the carrying of concealed weapons, making it the 28th state to proclaim said
activity a right of its citizenry. (No bearing on
your life, deafS wattie?A concealed-weapons ban
in Philadelphia was overturned just this summer.
Don't stop reading yet.)
The move fits in nicely with the conservative
(get-tough-on-crime) and libertarian (governmentshould-be-real-real-ina.':tive) themes that are ever
so trendy these days, but whether ithas any useful
effect is another issue. How a decision that encourages citizens to pursue justicevigilante-style,
and complicates the lives of police officers, will
solve any crime problems is not immediately
apparent.

Looking for absurdities in politics nowadays is
akin to hunting for grass on a lawn, so the above
discovery did not exactly turn your columnist's
Sunday upside down. And Texas is not generally
known as a hotbed of liberal procressivism. But
the reasoning invoked to defend this particular
decision seemed particularly odd.
For example, a Houston state legislator named
RonWilson defended the new law on grounds that
"we want to maintain some modicum of social
decorum here." Though your columnist's mind
reels with sarcastic replies to that, it seems most
judicious to wonder soberly how trying to deter
crime by promoting weapons proliferation constitutes a defense of social niceties. ("What a lovely
Smith & Wesson, dear. But remember to curl your
pinky when you fire.")
Can Mr. Wilson simultaneously declare that
"we are operating in what we like to call a civilized society" and pass a law that merely makes
justice a tad more arbitrary? (That is, how does

that pleasurable task of coming to know increasin June at

Alumni Weekend and then on trips across the
country and to South America later in the summer.
It is always a delight to observe in our alums that
characteristic talent for seeing, amid complexities, the heart of what is required to shape a better
world. And it is always such a wonderful validation of the education we jointly undertake to see
how quickly our alums, making use of that talent,
are able to achieve positions of leadership across
the extraordinary range of unique paths of life

intelligence, creativity, sensitivity and joy they unfailingly bring to
their leadership.
If, on a gray November day, you find yourself
sitting in the library with your confidence temporarily dampenedby the work at hand, or if you find
yourself beginning to feel a bit impatient to move

-President Alfred H. Bloom
Dear Students,
One of the great benefits of academic life from
my point of view is its abundance of beginnings.
I hope this particular new academic year will
begin, and continue, in satisfying and stimulating
ways for you.
One of my responsibilities as Provost is the
recruitment of extraordinary faculty members to
Swarthmore. This year I'm delighted to announce
that there will be three new members of the con-

n Biology, Chemistry and
tinuing faculty
and two very distinguished scholars
Religion
in our Cornell and Lang Visiting Professorships.
The Cornell Professorship is awarded to a
scholar who will offer wider social and cultural
perspectives to our campus. The Cornell Professor for this year is Asmarom Legesse, who was a
member of our Department of Sociology and
Anthropology until 1993 when he returned to his
nativeEritrea to play a role in the development of
social and educational programs in the newly
independent nation. Professor Legesse served as
Academic Vice-President of the University of
Asmara in Eritrea, and is an advisor to OXFAM
and UNICEF as well as to the Government of
Eritrea abou tissues ofeducation, health, development and refugee populations.
The Lang Professorship of Social Change was
created to bring to campus, as teachers, individuals who have used their intellectual abilities to
bring about positive social change. Dr. PaulPlatero
of the Navajo Nation will be here as the Lang
Professor during the spring semester. He holds a
Ph.D. in theoretical Linguistics from MIT and is
an expert on Navajo syntax. He has had a shaping
role in education for Native Americans. His curricula on Navajo history, culture and language are
used in Navajo schools as well as in training
teachers and teacher aides. Dr. Platero established the Navajo State OfficeofEducation, served
on the National Advisory Council on Indian Education and is a member of the Jefferson Forum,
which consists of outstarding scholars of American descentwho work in higher education.
The Cornell and Lang Professorships represent
well our deep commitment to sustaining
Swarthmore as an educationalcommunity in which
we not only achieve academic excellence.
-Provost Jenny Keith
—;

a more civilized state than everyone carrying guns
in plain sight?)
The notion that weapons proliferation means
decorum is not confined to Texas state legislators—a Mr. Jim Wilson of the magazine Shooting
Times opines that "an armed society is a polite
society," for instance, making your columnist
long for those genteel, refined days of the Old
West—but, humor value aside, itmisses thepoint.
The point of banning concealed weapons, it
would seem, is to leave law enforcement in the
hands of the police, where it belongs, generally.

What a lovely Smith &
Wesson dear. But remember to curl your pinky
when you tire.
(Do the Texas courts really want to spend time
sorting out a lot of you-pulled-your-gun-first-noyou-did disputes?)
Even if the recent move doesn't officially endorse justice via John Wayne or some equivalent,
it makes vigilante retribution and the like all too
possible by rendering the police powerless, except to clean up the mess. Ounce of prevention,
anyone?
For while allowing concealed weapons may
force criminals to think twice about crime (although, funny, some of us always thought of
armed crime as a desperate act, something by
which criminals incur a few risks anyway), it also,
by the same reasoning, forces ordinary citizens to
take more precautionary measures. Will you, Mr.
Store Owner in Texas, feel especially comfortable
without a gun under the counter now that any of
your customers could be carrying one?
Obviously, this isn't solely a concealed-weapons argument, but it seems worth wondering
whether effectively necessitating gun possession
for safety is a desirable approach to crime prevention. Even if an armed society is a polite society

(civility through suspicion—wheel), having a 357
in one's purse or pocket does not, necessarily,
make one feel safe (and judging from the widely

publicized paranoia of thenation' s various heavily
armed militias, perhaps it has the opposite effect).
The usual arguments for prevention of handgun
deaths via a decreased weapons supply will not be
rehashed here, but it is worth pondering what,
exactly, such a law can accomplish. Simple deterrence doesn't seem to be the aim, unlessyou think
that the possibility of a citizen's having a gun is a
stronger deterrent than said gun openly displayed.
(Not terribly plausible, especially since, generally, a gun in a purse or a hip pocket is less
immediately accessible than one carried in a holster or belt.) If better law enforcement is the idea,
the law's sponsors would do well to listen to the
Texas police officers who see the new development as ominous. Kenneth Yarbrough, president
of the Texas Police Chiefs Association, favors
open-carry requirements under the current licensing procedures, noting that "at least we would
know immediately, by sight, that a person was
carrying a weapon." A society full of itchy trigger
fingers may sound neat to a few, but not to those
who have to keep order.
The reasoning behind the Texas law may be
rooted in tender Texan sensibilities more than
anything else, in the end: Yarbrough opines that "I
don'tknow that our society would be willing to
accept" open-carry legislation. So whether the
movement to ignore that guns are a presence in
Texas life is rooted in fashion concerns (really;
Stephen Hallbrook, a Virginia attorney and expert
on gun laws, helpfully points out that "in modern
society a gun just doesn't go with the attire. You
wear a business suit or a lady wears a dress, and
you're not going to strap a six-shooter around
that", forcing your columnist to revamp his wardrobe) or simply a peculiar notion of a "civilized
society" wherein guns are common but unacknowledged, there are other, stranger factors than
simple crime consciousness at work. Whether it
was those elements or simply confused notions
aboutcrime prevention thatled to the overturning
of Texas' law is, sadly, not at all clear.

together and spent a good deal of the day talking.
He was quite excited about his summer camping

We, all of us, chose Swarthmore in large part
because of Carl. We knew it was one of the best
colleges in the country; we'd read the literature
and seen the campus; but most of what we knew
came through Carl. He seemed to embody everything we were looking for in a college and its
people.
When we came down in August and heard of his
death, we were devastated. I rallied against the
random capriciousness of the universe. I have to
admit that I seriously considered packing everything and everyone up and going home.
But we stayed. My son, and many students like
him are here because of Carl, and that's part of his
legacy. I would have like to have spent these next
four years getting to know him better and I'm
sorry that can't happen. But, however briefly, he
did touch our lives with a profound effect, and for
that all I can say is "Thanks, Carl."
-Richards Steinbock

To the Editors:
Carl's death was as sudden as it was unexpected. Many of the Admissions staff members
had been hired by Carl, and lament that oftentimes
a job has everything to do with who you are
working for. Fran Cuneo, Carl'sright hand woman
feels that she is still "waiting for Carl to zip
through the door carrying all his stuff." Fran uses
theremembrance ofCarl's zeal and goals to help
motivate herself with the everyday activities of
this "wild place" (a.k.a. the Admissions Office.)
Carl had a less than traditional approach toward
Swarthmore Admissions. Susan Untereker, Director of Admissions, saw Carl as believing
"Swarthmore should be recognized globally as
the premier U.S. liberal arts college and he believed that Admissions should be proactive in
informing young people of their options here. He
felt that the campus, the students, and faculty were
the best 'recruiters' and increased campus pro-

grams for prospective students and counselors,
encourages publications that better represented
the College as a whole and believed that technology could be positively used to communicate
more about the College to a broader audience."
Carl brought a different color to Swarthmore,
and his hue will not fade. His intensity of interest
and concern for people affected all who knew
him. I will forever remember him as the man who
came to our women's basketball practice to tell us
that he "appreciated what we were doing."
Meanwhile, there is a national search for all
candidates to take the position of Dean ofAdmissions.
With the help of the Scott Arboretum, a dedicated tree will be established in honor of Carl;
expected planting date is this spring. If you are
interested in donating to this cause, please email

to the family and fiancee of Carl Wartenburg.
We first heard of Carl last fall when our son
came home from a high school football game with
a glowing report about a Dean ofAdmissions he'd
met by chance. The two of themtalked a while that
Sunday, and at length the next day. With that, the
idea of Swarthmore as a college of choice was

born.
I first met Carl in February during a campus

UN Conference in Your Responsibility Doesn't End With a Vote

Beijing an Outrage
by Justin Herring
Imagine a country utterly without respect for basic human rights. Imagine a
place where you can be imprisoned, tortured, and executed merely for speaking
out against the government. Imagine a
population control program that tacitly
encourages female infanticide. Where
would you find such a place? You need
look no further then the site of the United
Nations Conference on Women-China.
Holding a conference on any human
rights issue in China makes as much
sense as holding a conference on weapons proliferation in Iraq or a conference
on terrorism in Libya. However, it is
particularly galling that China was chosen for a conference specifically dedicated to women's rights. China is only
one member in the international club of
nations that brutally and deliberately
oppresses its people, but it stands virtually alone in its systematic abuse of
women's rights.
It's difficult to imagine policies more
repressive for women thenChina's population control program. Forced sterilization and abortions are only the more
obvious injustice's inflicted on women.

The one child policy, combined with a
desire for boys who will be able to provide financially for their parents, has led
to dramatically more boys being raised
then girls. The ugly truthis that girls are
often aborted, in the case of the more
affluent, or, for the poor masses, simply
abandoned to die after birth.
The U.N. made a mistake by agreeing
to hold the conference in China, but it's
clear they lack the courage to take any
kind of action even when the Chinese
engage in harassment and intimidationof
conference members. On Saturday the
women leading the Non-Governmental
Organizations Forum on Women threatened to pull out if the Chinese didn't stop
stifling thefree speech at the conference.
Typically, for a U.N. body, they backed
down after they got no response from the
Chinese.
The communist government of China
has relentlessly stifled the conference.
From the beginning they banned several
groups from attending that were hostile
to Chinese interests, such as some Tibetan women living abroad. They delayed the visas of other attendees who
were critical of China. Now that the conference is under way theirrelentless sur-

veillance and harassment of any criticism against China has been shockingly
undisguised. One example is a lawyer
who tried to distributepro-Tibetan literature; she was physically attacked by Chinese 'security' personnel.
Despite their efforts to suppress criticism directed at themselves, the Chinese
government desperately wanted this conference, and they especially want Hillary
Clinton to come to China. This conference offers the opportunity for China to
polish a badly tarnished human rights
image. They know that even now press
coverage of the event is only moderate,
and long after their hostile role is forgotten the location of the conference will be
remembered. It will give them a bully

pulpit from which they will claim they
are concerned about human rights, and
that the communist governments brutal
treatment ofChinese citizens is theresult
of a different, non-western, 'interpretation' of human rights.
In particular, the conference attendees
themselves will want to play down the
Chinese antagonism in order to make the
document they produce seem more le-

gitimate.
They won't want to distract people
from what they see as the important thing,

their feminist doctrine. Such sentiments
are illustrated by the U.N. leadership,
with warm comments such as the one by
Under Secretary Ismat Kittani, "You have
invited the world to your capital and the
world is grateful."
The United States should take action.
We should withdraw from the conference. As this goes to press Mrs. Clinton
has arrived in Beijing and our involvement grows deeper and more intractable.

Unfortunately, by handing them a public
relations victory of this magnitude we
encourage them to change their deservedly horrific human rights image with
hollow symbols instead of concrete action.

institution. But they may never surface
because individuals will not communicate them to their Council reps, or the
school administration.
Many students have complaints about
the workings of Council but will not
voice it. Many complain about being
treated unfairly by Council committees
but will never publicly voice theirpains.
Please do, either to individual Council
members or through the open Council
meetings on Thursday nights.
I believe that, collectively, we are up
to the task. Lets not shirk our duty; it does
not take a leap of the imagination to see
how current ambivalence about what

Poverty means being kept out of policy

We are living today in a world of
incredible wealth, yet a world where more
and more people are becoming poor. In
the United States and worldwide, jobs
ing conditions are worsening for the ma-

jority, while a few get richer. The gap
between rich and poor is growing, with
the US leading the industrial world in
income inequality, according to recent
reports. The people whose labor provided the technology by which the standard of living of many of us is improving
are now being replaced by that technology in the labor market. Technology is
now doing the jobs many humans used to

do.
Yet at the same time that

secure

jobs

with livable wages are becoming less and
less available, assistance for the poor is
being cut worldwide. So what of the poor
and working class and, perhaps eventually, the middle class and even upper
class, who can't survive in today's
economy? Are we a society that believes
that only those who "work" should live?

What happens as more and more people
become unemployed as jobs are replaced
by technology? The attitude (which penetrates the current welfare debate) that
capital-producing work should be the
necessary prerequisite for receiving income is limiting and uncreative.
First, it is impractical, as there are
fewer jobs available which permit families to survive even in a modest lifestyle.
Also, in the debate, we often lose track of
the fact that parenthood is a full-time job
and that perhaps it is not unreasonable

physically sick to sur-

vive? This recalls
from the past grim
memories of societies I don't think we
want to imitate. Fortunately, we live in a
world of such wealth that poverty does
not have to exist. Can't we envision a
humane society which seeks solutions
for the survival ofall?
We need to begin to understand and
fight poverty as a systemic problem, not
as the individual problem it's so often
treated as. It is a problem which is rooted
in a system which necessitates unemployment and yet fails to provide adequate income for the unemployed or for
the unpaid employed, such as mothers.
We're humans, we're creative. We don't
have to accept poverty, even if it doesn't

directly affect us.
Let's harness our creativity and our
wealth, which has been collectively produced using the land and water we all
inhabit and employ it for the collective
good.
Is this really the best we can do
hungry and sick five-year olds living and

Or can we dare to imagine a society

supported to raise children and where
people will not waste their lives away in
fiery mines, in chemical saturated factories and fields or in fast-food restaurants,

but rather will be able to raise families
and create art.
Let's redefine work. Let's follow the
lead of the organized poor to build a
world not where we seek to take from
each other what we can, but where we all

We, Franklin Rubinstein and Dan

the task of coming up with some sort of
an identity for a section which has no
expressed purpose. Our fear was that it
would be an odd, random collection of

entertaining tidbits on various sociallyrelated events with no one single cohesive theme. The more we thought about
this, the more frightened we became.

we have come up with, tentatively titled,
"My First Experience at Swat Parties,"
by Bartholemew Gid Bombgardner, '99:
Wow. I am so excited. My first weekend at Swat. Oh boy oh boy, I am going

John's Summer Movie Review

The ups and downs of Wayne Wang, Judge Dredd and Paul Wachter
By John Derderian
If you're an avid filmgoer you probablyrecognized this summer as a handful
of superb films stranded and floating in a
waterworld of bad cinema. You might
have hadnoble intentions to only see the
best movies, only to Find yourself assent
to the prodding of your friends and go to
the midnight showing of Species. Or you
may have carefully
selected what you
thought to be thebest
movies, only to be
disappointed more
often than not by
Hollywood formula.
I caught a few flicks

shocking subject matter, make this story
of a married woman who works the day
shift in a Parisian brothel a must see.
Judge Dredd (*) On our way across
country Paul Wachter '97 and I were able
to catch one film (half the number of
speeding tickets we received). Sly
Stallone's performance in this awful
comic book adaptation left me thinking
"I guess you won't need a law degree to

this Summer, and

though I often departed the theater
with a sort of quizzical melancholy, I

was also able to pick
a few winners.
Here's a sample of
Summer
my

filmography.
Wayne Wang's
Smoke (**l/2), a
slice of life in and
around a Brooklyn
cigar shop, has a terrific ensemble cast
andrich atmosphere,
but the philosophical ramblings on human existence grow
a little tiresome.
Think Lawrence
Kasdan's Grand
Canyon, replacing L. A. with a New
York backdrop. Russ Meyer's 1965 cult
classic Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!
(***l/2) is a supercharged road movie
which follows three buxom vixens (one
of whom sports a campy Italian accent)
as they wreak havoc on all men in their
path. This standard drive-in exploitation
feature has so much raw verve and manic
energy thatit has attained legendary status among B-movie fans. First Knight
(*l/2) Richard Gere plays Lancelot.
Enough said. Little Odessa (***) Tim
Roth gives one of severalwonderful performances in this grim tale of a disintegrating Russian family inBrooklyn. Lupe
Nunez-Femandez '97 calls it "perfect
tragedy." Belle de Jour (****), Luis
Bunuel's masterpiece starring a magnetic Catherine Deneuve, was among the
best this Summer had to offer (too bad it
was made in 1967). The flashback sequences, the high couture, and the
director's relaxed approach to rather

be a

judge in the future." This

was

actually one of my Summer movie highlights, not for the film but for the shady

way two corrupt ushers smuggled us in
through the back alley in Chicago. Kids
(***)

was probably the most controver-

sial film of the Summer. First timedirector Larry Clark (whose previous efforts
in photography include a portrait of the
Tulsa, Oklahoma drug world and a River
Phoenix teen-mag compilation) treads
familiar ground in this day in the life of
Washington Square skaters. The proceedings, however, often seem very dictated and forced, not exactly the best way
to achieve an honest representation ofhis
subject Outsideof the curious deflowering pastime of the male lead, the behavior of most of the kids is quite familiar.
One can only believe that this characteris
a cheap device to tantalize and shock
audiences. Switching from pseudo-documentary to documentary, Unzipped
(***l/2), Douglas Keeve's film about

fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, was undoubtedly the most hilarious film of the
Summer. It follows the designer over the
period of one year as he pieces together
his Spring runway show. Mizrahi is a
comic tour de force, reeling off one liners, doing remarkable impersonations,
and earnestly singing the theme to The
Mary Tyler Moore Show. It's worth
seeing justto glimpse the inner workings
of the fashion industry. Under Seige 2
(**)-Seagal is back in
Die Hard on a train,
with villain Eric
Bogosian bringing his
frenetic off-Broadway
ranting to your local
multiplex. Jeffrey
(**l/2) is the screen
adaptation of Paul
Rudnick's play of the
same name. Steven
"Wings" Weber and
Admiral "Patrick
Stewart" Piccard lead
the cast in this comedy about a gay man
who, due to his frustration with the unromantic precautions
thathave become necessary in the era of
AIDS, wants to give
up sex. Like most
movies thatcome from
the stage, the action is
a little tight, but most
of the humor survived
the transition. The
large release and
mainstream actors that
this project attracted, mark a watershed
for the portrayal of gay life in cinema.
Sigourney Weaver has a sidesplitting
cameo as a Susan Powter-esque motivational speaker. Desperado (** 1/2),Robert Rodriguez's Hollywood follow up to
the ultra-low budget El Mariachi (the
Sundance favorite that was reportedly
made for $7,000) has enough bloody,
violent slow motion action sequences to
put a John Woo film to shame. Antonio
Banderas steps into the role of the
Mariachi on amission, adding extra salsa
to this tortilla western. Rodriguez, with
more pesos to spend on basically the
same story, replaces the grainy charm
and cost mandatedinventionofMariachi
with this slick, tongue-in-cheek homage
to the genre (he also added a feverish
score by Los Lobos). Jerry Karnas '97
says "it's all image, man." I justcouldn't
stop thinking that Desperado would definitely find an audience as a syndicated
TV show starring Lorenzo Lamas.

Steve Martin and Jason Robards share a father son bonding experience in Parenthood.

Parenthood and While You Were
Sleeping Playing this Weekend!!:)
Carl: The first film Kate I will be
reviewing is While You Were Sleeping
starring Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman,
and Peter Gallagher. I personally can't
give this film too high a rating as it's not
even Christmas time yet and the movie
takes place during Christmas. I like to
watch movies "in season". And besides,
Sandra's character is just this way too
sappy woman who spends every night
with her cat. On a high note, Pullman's
character fares far better here than the
one he played in Malice.
Kate: All right, Kate here, stepping in
with the voice of reason. Carl, your
knowledge of the movie Malice won't help you here. Fess
up, you've never even seen
While You Were Sleeping.
Granted, While You Were
Sleeping is a pretty sappy
movie. You could even call it
a chick movie, if you were
into those sweeping generalizations. I have, however, had
many males tell me that they
really enjoyed this film. Even
if you're not into the mushy
romance bit, there are some
genuinely funny moments.
The story begins by introducing Lucy Moneratz (Bullock), a lonely token booth
worker at one of Chicago's
many L- stops. She is working Christmas Day, and passes
the time daydreaming of the
handsome commuter Peter
Callaghan (Gallagher) who
passes by every day. Although
she has never mustered the
courage to speak to theman of her dreams,
she jumps to his rescue when he is mugged
and pushed onto the El tracks. Peter's
family, left almost entirely in the dark
about his personal life, arrives at the
hospital and eagerly accepts Lucy as
Peter's fiance. She doesn't have the
heart, or the overwhelming desire, to
correct them, and spends the holidays
soaking up the family's love while Peter
remains in a coma. Meanwhile, Lucy
begins to fall for Peter's brother Jack
(Pullman), who never believed her story
in the first place. When Peter wakes up,
Lucy must choose between the two, as
well as explain herself to the trusting

and it is, but also pretty entertaining. The
highlight, by far, is the ever-present character of Joe, Jr., (Michael Respoli), and
his futile attempts to romance Lucy. I
would happily see the movie again for
the sole purpose of hearing his uniquely
Chicago accent.
Carl: And just for the record, my
review was based on a carefully researched survey of a control group of
Swarthmore students. Anyway, I did see
this week's second motion picture Parenthood directed by that guy who played
Opie. I really recommend this film with
its all-star cast of Steve Martin, Mary

crew,

Steenburgen, Jason Robards, Rick
Moranis, Diane Wiest, Keanu Reaves,

There's not exactly what I'd call a plot
here, but its about the Buckmans, a family in which every member has a great
deal of problems and learns the joys and

troubles of raising children and being a
child. When I say everyone in the movie
has troubles, they're not simplified Full
House solved-in-a-half-hour stuff, nor
are they outrageous Pulp Fiction problems, but rather pretty believable dilemmas for the average American family.
The majority of the film is centeredaround
the problems of Gil (Martin) and Karen's

think just about everyone will find a few
characters that they can relate to in this
movie.
Kate: Parenthood really is a pretty
remarkable movie, and not to be confused with the completely unrelated WB Network Robert
Townsend sitcom that shares
its name. It's an atypical film
for Steve Martin, who is rarely
the comedic straight man, but
who plays therole extremely
well here. Gil and Karen are
clearly the most normal of the
family clan, and it's because
they'reso likable that theother

At Swat 70
Years Ago
By Jessica Harbour
1925,
fraternities and sororities
In
(which weren'tbanned until 1932)ruled
the roost. The seven fraternities and six
sororities were governed by a Pan-Hellenic Council, which had just imposed a
new setofrules to prevent hazing. Separate Student Governments existed for
men and women. Female sophomores
sometimes had to face a Sophomore
Court: 'The fingers of those who persisted in wearing rings were painted
with iodine. Others who had been seen
fussing were ordered to put court plaster
over their mouths...Some general offenses were punished by forcing the
disobedient ones to wear two lemons
around their necks and also to carry a
soap box filled with beets and hay."
And in place of the McCabe Mile and
the Crum Regatta, the sophomores and
freshmen had an annual Poster Fight, in
which the object was to put up as many
posters as you could while tearing down
the posters of the other class. The defeated freshmen were forced to sing
"We Love the Sophomores" on their
knees, which, of course, would never
happen at today's kinder, gentler
Swarthmore.

Some people think that women take a
long time to learn to play a sport—particularly a sport like rugby that most people
have no experience with before college.

The team'snew captains, Rebecca Cole
'96 and Kelly Shannon '96, were somewhat concerned about the lack of returning players this season. The team lost
many of its strongest players to graduation last spring and study abroad this

The infamous Swarthmore Men's
Rugby team is already in full force after
completing their first full week of practice. The team is being led this year by
Seniors Jason Dougal and Chaz Teplin.
Teplin made the observationthatthe team
is heavy in the number of Juniors and
Seniors that they have returning, but light
in terms of new recruits .
For those of you who are not familiar
with rugby terminology, the team is divided into Forwards and Backs, which is
roughly the defense and offense. Dougal
is the Forward captain and is commonly
referred to as the "Field General." Teplin
is the Back captain and encourages any
interested Freshmen or Upperclassmen
to give him a call at x 3449 if you want to
play. It is definitely not to late to play.
Our male ruggers, fondly called the
Evil Buzzards or 'Zards, face many challenges this season in their division. They
are in a new division, in fact, but they are
determined to excell.
On an exciting note, the team's schedule is full of home games. They are
playing a preseason game this Saturday
at Scranton College, but they will be
back next weekend for an exciting home
match. Wathcing rugby is a very pleasant way to the spend the afternoon on
Dupont Field.

A coach's number one priority, even at
Swarthmore, is to win. Say what you will

about his personality or whatever else,
Kentwell has done an excellent job of
molding the field hockey program into a
winner. He has taken it from the depths
of the Centennial Conference and made
it into a legitimate conference title and
playoff contender. Mr. Kentwell may
step on some peoples' feet when he tries
to assemble the best team possible, but
he wasn'tbrought here to be a sensitivity
counselor. There never has been, nor
will there ever be, a coach who won
universal approval from his or her players. To be a winner involves going the
extra mile, and if that means playing for
a coach for whom you don't particularly
care, then so be it.
Stay tuned- this probably won't be the
last we hear from the field hockey program.

head coach Richard Kentwell, but the
ones off the field seem to be slowly
killing this team.
In the latest installment of this ridiculous soap-opera, the field hockey team is
experiencing a numbers problem. Injuries and illnesses aside, several players
have decided to leave the team for various reasons. One player, who requested
anonymity, said that she "didn't wantto
put up with the frustration of having to
play for Richard [Kentwell]" and that
"field hockey had become more of a
chore instead of something fun." Another player, who also requested anonymity, said that she left the team because ".he [Kentwell] doesn't appreciate
the dedication and work some people
have given to the program... he's really
caught up in building a "Dream Team"
and in the process, he kind of forgets
about the people who got him here, to
where the program is at now."

Given the facts, it is easy to blame
Richard Kentwell for the field hockey
team's problems. I have heard numerous
complaints about his abrasive coaching
style and his treatment of the players.
Some of Kentwell's methods are questionable. I know from personal experi-

PRE-SEASON REVIEW

Hockey
By Jean Quinn
In an effort to build on last year's
the women's field hockey team
kicked off its season with more than a
week of intensive pre-season practices.
Eighteen returning players and nine firstyear students arrived to hone their skills,
build their endurance, andprepare for the
competitions thatlie ahead. Coach RichardKentwell held three practice sessions
each day to get the players ready and fit.
"People worked very hard and showed
great improvement" in those important
pre-season days, said Kentwell. Kelly
Wilcox '97, a field hockey player with
seven years experience at midfield and in
front of the goal, also reported that she
"could see improvement each day."

each other, both on and off the field,' 1

Tide Prepares for Shot at the Title
By Francis Amar

l

In 1995, the GarnetTide will be looking to break on through to the other side.
Following two very mediocre seasons,
the Tide hopes to return to their 1992
form, which saw them finish second in
the Centennial Conference with a 5-3*
record.
This year, the Garnet Tide will have
theirwork cutout for them, however. For
the Garnet Tide to have any realistic
chance of moving up in the Centennial
Conference, they must improve on both
sides of the ball as well as special teams.
Offense Last year's offense was light
years ahead of the lifeless unit that Head
CoachKarl Miran directed in 1993,but it
could only muster 17.8 points per game,
marginally better than their 16.4 points
per game in 1993. To improve on this,
Miran needs more consistency from quarterback Patrick Straub '97. As Straub,
who threw for 1,136yards and 6 touchdowns last season, goes, so goes the
Garnet Tide offense.
The quarterback is a pivotal player in
any offense," said Miran. ""In our offense, Pat has to make split second decisions dealing with both the run and pass
game. It helps that there is a lot of talent
at the skill positions, so Pat can get them
the ball and let them create big plays.
"

He's shown a tremendous amount of
maturity throughout the preseason. During his career, he has been occasionally
brilliant and often good. He looks like
he's able to make the transition to the
next level, which is playing consistently
good"
Although the passing game will take
on a little more emphasis this year, don't
expect the Garnet Tide to become the
BYU ofthe CentennialConference. Even
after the graduation of the school's alltime leading rusher, Dave Reeser '95, the
running game should be better than it was
last year. Behemoth fullback Nick
Milligan '96, who has not only the
strength and size to pulverize would be
tacklers but also surprising agility, will
spearhead the ground attack. Milligan,
who rushed for 480 yards and 3 touchdowns last season, will be expected to
shoulder more of the load. The tailback
chores will be handled by the Garnet
Tide's version of the three-headed monster. Francis Amar '96 has emerged as
the starter, after an intense training camp
battle with Pat Donaghy '97. The two
will likely split time throughout the season. Korey Wright '99, who has been
slowed throughout the preseason by a
back injury, will no doubt see plenty of
action, as will backup fullback Chas
Keegan '99.

Volleyball

With only four players with significollegiate experience, the starting
lineup of this season's women's volleyball team is by no means set. Captains
Nancy Rosenbaum '96 and DianaBieber

'9B a fixture at setter. Defensive specialist Laura Pitman '96 suffered a torn rotator cuff suffered in preseason, and may
miss the season.
In search of a middle hitter, Coach
Larry Perry may be forced to convert
Rosenbaum to the position. Although
she's not a natural middle hitter,
Rosenbaum is a superb athlete and may
be the best solution. In practice,
Rosenbaum, Connie Cheung '9B, and
Hillary Sheipe '9B have worked outat the
position.

Looks to Top .500
By Pat Donaghy

When a 5-12 team loses many key
because of graduation, the outlook seems grim. Indeed, a 5-0 opening
game loss to a very strong St. Mary's
(MD) squad may be a sign of things to
come. However, because of the strong
character of the returning players along
withthe athleticism of the talentedfreshmen, this team should be able to make a
big improvement fromlast year, and will
be at least a .500 team, believes head
coach Cheri Goetcheus.
Co-captains Sarah Guroff and
Robin Canada, along with fellow seniors
Laura Starita and Mara Willard will undertake the task of meshing the team

The newcomers "include lots of solid

players with already
developed talent to
play at the college
level."
together to form a winning unit Accord-

ing to teammate Lauren Jacobi '97, "The
seniors have done a great job in leading
by example and creating a comfortable
atmosphere for the rest of the players,
especially die freshmen."
Besides the four seniors, other returning players will also take a big role in

developing theyoung team. Claireßaxter
'9B, a Seven Sisters All-Tournament
Team selection last year, moves to stopper and will be the backbone of the defense. Betsy Rosenbaum '9B and Jill
Willdonger '97 are two fast wingers who
will fire up the offense. Jacobi, who set
up the winning goal against Haverford
last year, will once again be amainstay in
midfield.
But a surprise to most players has
been the ability of the freshmen. Guroff
said that the newcomers "include lots of
solidplayers with already developed talent to play at the college level."
Goetcheus, who also was excited about
the condition in which the freshmen arrived, said that as a result, more time
could be used to develop skills. This is
key for a team that had as short a preseason that the team did this year. While
eventually more freshmen may crack the
starting lineup, Jenn VanderVeer, Janice
Gallagher and goalie Anne Holland
started in the season opener.
Although the 5-0 loss was a tough
way to open the season, Goetcheus said
that "it's important to learn from an early
loss. I'm hoping that the team will be
more aggressive." She also pointed out
that there was a great overall improvement from the first half to the second
half. The improvement will have to continue when die team hosts Misericordia
on Saturday and Kutztown on Wednesday, in order to gear up for the Seven
Sisters tournament next weekend also at
home.

If the new formula of
having a stronger
defense and more
effective teamwork
on offense works,
the team should have
a good chance of
equaling, and perhaps surpassing last

year's 15-4 squad.
says Wilcox, citing the team's unity as a
strength. "Speed and quickness on the
front line and in the midfield, and solid
and consistent defense" enhance the
team's ability to perform well, she added.
The good rapport that was so quickly
establishedbetween the players transfers
easily to the field when the women begin
to work together, she said. "The team
moves the ball down the field as an entire
team, supporting each other the entire
way."

In addition to its cohesiveness, the
is empowered by a wealth of talented first-year students. Specifically,
Coach Kentwell mentioned the strong
team

contributions of Jen Hagan, Holly Baker,
and Donna Griffen. The team lost two of
its highest scorers to graduation and needs
first-year students who could take their
place as offensive threats.
As the number of returning players >
dwindled to about a dozen, the team now
consists primarily of underclassmen.
Samantha Peltz '97, a member of the
forward line, believes that a possible
"weak spot may be the fact that we are a
very young team. Though the underclassmen are acapable group, confidence
may be an issue at first." Peltz said,
"Coach Richard is encouraging a different style of play this season. We are
concentrating more on stick skills and
accuracy as opposed to last year's focus,
which lay in the strength of individual
players' drives.... Though we may not
be as high scoring a team this year, we
have solidified our defense, so we may be \
in for lower scoring matches in general."
If this new formula works, the team should
have a good chance of equaling and,
perhaps, surpassing the success of last
year's which enjoyed a thirteen game
winning streak at the beginning of the
season and finished 15-4.
While Peltz has high hopes after a 5-0
win Thursday over King's College,Coach
Kentwell would not make any predictions. "I feel the team is stronger thanlast
year. The bottom line will be capitalizing on the opportunities we create. The
team's first two games against King's 1
College and Johns Hopkins (Sept. 9,lpm, \
Home) will set a tone for the season," he
said. "Overall, we should be strong, but
it is really just too early to tell anything /
more. We couW be 15-4 again, or 4-15." V

Athletes of the Week

Chuck Hudson '96
Hudson, a three year starter at left tackle, is our first male athlete of the
week. The 6'4" 250 pound lineman earned second team All-Conference
honors last season and was voted a preseason Ail-American by the College
Football Preview. Hudson brings agility and savoir-faire to his position.
Additionally, his leadership skills will come into focus as he helps to mold an
inexperienced offensive lineinto a cohesive unit. A teammate of Hudson said
that he"is the most dominant offensive lineman I've ever played with."

Elliott isfamous for her long, blonde hair and amazing studying skills.
But the lone senior on the field hockey team has also combined academics
with being able to play a sport every semester shehas been at S warthmore.
In the Spring, she has had a hand in the succesful women's lacrosse
program. Her teammates recognize her as a fantastic athlete with a big
heart and a winning attitude. Elliott can serve as a great role modelfor the
young field hockey squad.
