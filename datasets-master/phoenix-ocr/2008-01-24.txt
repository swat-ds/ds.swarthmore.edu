Students appreciated the school's funding. "I was planning to volunteer for one of
the primary states regardless," Justin

"The funding from the President's
Office made it possible for me to go to New
Hampshire and be involved in the
process," said Daniel Leigh 'O9, former
president of the College Democrats.
"Beyond that, it didn't influence me or the
work I did at all. The money from the
President's Office only facilitated transportation to and from New Hampshire.

Who we worked for and what we did was

International, ED and regular applications rise
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's selectivity continues to surge as the number of applications to the college increases and the number
of applicants accepted remains approximately the same.
The first wave of decisions was sent out on Dec. 15 of last
year to those who applied Fall Early Decision. The
Admissions Office is currently in the process of processing

and reading applications for Winter Early Decision and
Regular Decision. These applicants will hear their verdicts
around Feb. 15 and Apr. 1 of this year, respectively.
This year, the number of ED applicants once again created a new record. According to Dean of Admissions Jim
Bock '9O, there were 424 applicants last year for Fall and
Winter ED, and this year that figure has risen 12 percent to
475 applications. In terms of admission rates, 44.3 percent of
Fall ED applicants were admitted last year compared to 40.5
percent of applicants this year.
Bock attributes these differences to the Admissions

Office's continued outreach, Princeton and Harvard's
moves to eliminate their early admissions programs and
the fact that more students are applying to colleges overall.
He also included word of mouth, college rankings and good
press as other factors that may have urged more high
school seniors to apply ED to Swarthmore.
Many recent articles in The Chronicle of Higher
Education have mentioned Swarthmore, and War News
Radio and the Genocide Intervention Network continue to
generate national attention for the college. Recent Nobel
Laureate in Physics John Mather '6B has also kept
Swarthmore's name in the papers and in the public consciousness.
Bock believes that the Swarthmore Unscripted DVD that
the admissions office distributes has also been successful at
courting high school students. Applicants have also stated
that their campus visits left them with a favorable impression of the college. According to Bock, the wealth of opportunities offered by Swarthmore as well as its students and
faculty are commonly mentioned in applications as well.
"It breaks a lot of stereotypes when prospective students
visit, which is part of our goal. It is to our advantage when

THE PHOENIX

they visit classes, meet students and speak with profes-

sors," Bock said.
Members of the incoming Swarthmore class of 2012 cited
many of these factors in their decisions to apply Fall ED to
the college. "I applied ED to Swarthmore because I knew
absolutely that it was my first choice," Lauren Stern 'l2
said. "It had the programs that I wanted and it had the
small size. I'm local and I had not anticipated staying local,
but I ended up falling in love with [Swarthmore]. So I
thought, they have ED and that's supposed to help your
chances, and it was definitely my first choice." "When I
went to visit campus, I just really had a feel for it," Shawn
Doherty 'l2 said.

Swarthmore had no formal international studies program,
it ranked in the top 10 in [Foreign Policy's] ranking [of
internationalrelations programs]," Stern said.
In addition to early admissions, overall applications to

the college are up as well. Swarthmore received a total of
5,335 applications last year for the class of 2011, and those for
the class of 2012 have already reached 5,807, although the
Admissions Office is still in the process of counting applications, Bock said. Notably, international student applications to the college have grown this year. So far, the office
has processed 950 such applications, while last year the
total number stood at 790 applications.
"We have been doing more international travel this year
It is hard to say that there is a correlation between that
and the increase in applications, but we would like to
believe thatthere is," Bock said. "However, there were a lot
of places that we didn't go, and we still saw applications
from those areas, so clearly they are learning about us
somehow."
Bock felt that Swarthmore's announcement of no-loan
financial aid awards had little impact on the increase in
applications. Fall ED applicants certainly were not affected
by the change as their applications were due nearly a
month before the Dec. 15 announcement. According to
Bock, those applying Winter ED probably were not affected
by the announcement either, as their applications were due
on Jan. 2, and they had likely already decided to apply ED
...

"We have been doing more
International travel this year...
However, there were a lot of places
that we didn't go, and we still saw

Jim Bock '9O
Dean of Admissions
"A lot of schools look the same on paper. When I got to
Swarthmore, I just had a feeling. I was really impressed
with the way they sat us down, and it was a really close-knit
feeling. It wasn't all numbers. I also really like everything
that Swarthmore does with community service, its strong
academics and the fact thatlots of students live on campus."
Doherty also mentioned being done with college applications in December as another motivator in her decision to

apply early.
"I thought that Swarthmore students seemed really
intellectual and had a little something extra that I didn't see
anywhere else. What sealed the deal was when Jim Bock

gave my admissions session and told me that, while

Bock felt that it is still too early to anticipate the impact
that no-loan awards will have on applications to the college.
He did, however, say that he expects the change to have a
greater impact on the percentage of accepted students
matriculating at the college compared to that of the total

number of applications received.

Bock also said that he did not feel as if Swarthmore's
decision to do away with loans in its financial aid awards
came too late. "We were one of the first. The [liberal arts
colleges] I know that did it before us were Davidson,
Amherst and Williams
Pomona came out on the same
day as us. We were right in the midst of it, and very few
schools are able to do it. I just think it was appropriate and
was really glad that the board decided to do it," Bock said.

In an e-mail sent to students on Dec. 12,
2007, Swarthmore President Al Bloom
announced the college's decision to
replace all loans with grants next year.
According to "A Brief Primer on
Financial Aid at Swarthmore College" for
2007-2008, the average loan component of
an individual financial aid package is

$2,295.

Nevertheless, the discussion at the Board
meeting was an impassioned one that
came to consensus on doing "the right
thing and doing it right away."
Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O
added that the decision was collectively
supported by the President's staff and
board.

Independence of the Decision

With the new financial aid policy, this
component will no longer be the student's
responsibility and will be replaced with
additional scholarship money.

Publications such as The New York
Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer
have taken note of prestigious colleges'
expansion of financial aid offerings,

which was decided upon earlier than had
been expected, was announced around the
same time that other top-notch institutions of higher learning, such as Harvard
University and Yale University, stated
their intent to increase their financial aid
offerings. The college's decision will
affect all incoming students as well as the
current classes of 2011, 2010 and 2009, but
will not be implemented retroactively.

"The Board [of Managers], hearing a

Financial Aid Director Laura Talbot
said that although the college's Board of
Managers' meeting to discuss the new policy was held on the same Saturday as
Harvard's Board of Managers' meeting,
Harvard's decision to change its financial
aid policy held no bearing on the college's
decision. "Some of the things Harvard has
been doing, we've been doing for a number of years," Talbot said, citing the college's reduction of the influence of house
equity when calculating financial aid.
"We gear the [financial aid] review to
each family. It is not a push-button
answer."
Eldridge also pointed to the already
generous financial aid packages that the
college has offered. "It's about doing the

best we can for students," Talbot said.
"Financial aid is one of the first things
that is discussed," Talbot added.
However, Eldridge did acknowledge
the competition first tier schools face in
attracting students. "The timing of the
decision makes it possible to implement it
in time for the incoming class but of
course does not ignore the competitive
arena that admissions is," Eldridge said
in an e-mail.

National college conference addresses writing program diversity
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore. edu

Convened to discuss topics such as diversity issues in
writing programs and the training of tutors, the Small
Liberal Arts College Writing Program Administrators, a
group of the directors of the writing programs of 58 liberal
arts colleges, held a conference at Swarthmore over winter
break to compare writing programs.
The conference was held from Jan. 11-13, and 36 of the 58
colleges in SLAC-WPA were represented, according to Jill
Gladstein, the writing program director at Swarthmore and
the primary organizer of the conference. "We invited writing directors to come and talk about the best practices and
the current challenges in helping students at this type of
institution develop their writing," Gladstein said.
This conference marked the first time that the SLACWPA has convened. Gladstein, along with Lisa Lebduska
and Dara Regaignon, the writing directors for Wheaton
College and Pomona College, respectively, conceived the
idea. Gladstein, Lebduska and Regaignon attended a national conference for writing program administrators in July
where they recognized the need for a more focused discussion on writing instruction, according to Regaignon. Since
Gladstein was heavily involved in the project's early stages,
she offered to host the first conference.
"It was an opportunity to showcase Swarthmore and to
get our name out," Gladstein said.
Lebduska emphasized the importance of bringing together schools of similar sizes and backgrounds that, unlike
larger schools, do not have graduate programs to help teach
writing. These smaller schools, therefore, do not have many
of the advantages that come with graduate programs, like
available teaching assistants or separate writing departments. "A lot of the programs we have are housed in English
departments, instead of separate ones," Lebduska said.

"This sets up a different dynamic. It's a helpful dynamic,
but it means that the larger institutions cannot provide role
models."
The conference was organized into three main sessions,
each addressing a different issue essential to liberal arts
writing programs. One of these sessions focused on faculty
development through several panel discussions that emphasized the need for writing programs to work with faculty
across different departments.
"This is especially important at schools like
Swarthmore, which doesn't have a first year composition
course, but instead has writing intensive courses that go
across the disciplines," Gladstein said.
"Jill [Gladstein] had a chance to speak about her biology
project, which was very well received at the conference,"
WA program intern Mary De Boer said. "She followed students throughout a biology class and tried to figure out how
students grew as writers and what techniques Writing
Associates were using that were effective."
The other sessions included discussions on how to assess
students' writing and how issues of diversity affect writing
programs.
"It is always a concern of writing programs to make sure
that you have a representative group of people working as
writing tutors and that you are reaching the whole student
body," De Boer said.
This is a topic that has been discussed recently in
Swarthmore's writing program. As part of their training
class, a group of Writing Associates investigated diversity
issues in the writing program.
"We compared people's perceptions of the WA program
to reality," Ariane Vartanian 'lO, a WA who worked on the
project, said. "We wanted to see what the campus thought
the program was made up of." In order to do this, they first
examined the diversity of the WAs in terms of race, gender

and social class, and then compared these results to those of

the entire campus. They also administered interviews of
students within the writing program and students outside
of it to compare the perception of the program to the reality. Their results showed that opinions of the program varied, but for the most part were accurate in recognizing the
majority of WAs to be Caucasian and female. "It's good to
talk about it and what we want for the program," Vartanian

said.
The conference showed that each school approached the
teaching of writing a little differently, according to
Gladstein.
"We are probably one of the more comprehensive programs in thatthere is a course WA piece as well as the writing center, the mentor program and service programs,"
Gladstein said.
Gladstein did, however, hear several good program ideas

from other schools at the conference. One of them was a
speaking associates program.
"We are very much in the beginning stages, but we are
thinking about how our model for writing could be used for
speaking as well," Gladstein said. Although the program is
not specifically modeled after any one school, the idea for
speaking associates has been circling among writing programs at other colleges. This program would focus on helping students with oral presentations or leading class discussions, according to Gladstein. She hopes that the program will be piloted into a class soon to see if it could succeed at Swarthmore.
Gladstein and Lebduska say that they are now sharing
what they have learned and are seeing which programs
could be used at their respective schools. Both have had
high hopes for the future of SLAC-WPA and for another
meeting next year.
"I hope we can build up momentum and start thinking
about joint research or grants to look at how liberal arts students learn to write," Lebduska said.

On the Republican side, Shaffer volunteered for Mitt Romney's campaign in lowa
and New Hampshire for about two weeks.
"In both lowa and New Hampshire I helped
manage the phone bank and participated in
door to door efforts," Shaffer .said inanemail. "I was in lowa from Dec. 26 through
Jan. 3 and in New Hampshire Jan. 4-9. In
lowa, a unique project I had with four other
interns was to prepare caucus packages for
the more than 1500 precincts in the state.
With intense photocopying and sorting it

took two 12- hour days to complete the pack-

ages.
"The fun part is that we split the state in
five and to deliver the packages to all 99
county chairs. I drove easily 600 miles in
one day across Northern lowa which was a
great experience seeing the state let's just
say I saw a lot of silos! On caucus night I also
had the privilege of working in our Svar
room' answering calls of voter irregularites.
Despite the loss, it was an unforgettable
experience," he said. Having worked unoffi-

cially with the Romney campaign before,
Shaffer plans to work on a campaign-sponsored bus from Washington D.C. to
Jacksonville, FL to continue supporting his
candidate.
Charlie Decker 'O9, Internet Director and
former Executive Director of the College
Democrats, is currently in South Carolina
and will soon travel to New York. He chose
to continue volunteering on the Obama campaign rather than return to Swarthmore for
spring semester. He spent his winter break
in New Hampshire.
"Unlike everyone else working in
Manchester, I was working more up north,
which is more politically independent," he
said. "One thing I found interesting was we
talked to a couple of people who said they
would register as Republicans in the New
Hampshire open primary to vote for McCain
because they hate Romney but would vote
for Obama in the general election."

Daniel Leigh who was president of the
College Democrats last fall, worked for John
Edwards in Derry, NH "Most days I was
canvassing," he said in an e-mail.
"My first day I was with the 'fly team'
which is a van full of volunteers which can
drive to a precinct and knock it out quickly
and effectively. Following that, one of the
organizers in the Derry office loaned me her
car and I did clean up turf finishing up the
doors other volunteers either couldn't or
didn't want to get to."
Leigh was involved in staffing rallies and
observed various other candidates' campaign rallies. "New Hampshire is kind of
like a political mix of festival, parade and
horse race. Right after I arrived, as I was
walking through downtown Manchester to
the Edwards headquarters, I encountered a
mob of Ron Paul supporters parading down
the street chanting 'Ron Paul revolution!
Give us back our constitution!'"
What most struck Leigh, however, were
the attitudes of New Hampshire residents.
"Most of the people I met were proud of their
prominent role every four years. They were
also very happy with the money that the
flood of press, volunteers, and political professionals coming to New Hampshire brings
in. It's really pretty amazing how many people descend on such a small state for the primary."
In support of Bill Richardson, Jesse Hoff
'll volunteered in New Hampshire from
Dec. 27 to Jan. 8. "I've been a supporter for

Jesse Hoff speaks with former Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson, for
whom Hoff campaigned in New Hampshire this winter.
"I'm disappointed with what
happened, but it's also about getting a message out, and that's what we did."
According to Molly Weston 10, President
of the College Democrats, leaders of the
College Democrats and College Republicans
encouraged members to volunteer. "I promoted the opportunity of primary volunteering to other Swarthmore College
Republicans," Shaffer said in e-mail. "Many
were interested, but those had already made
winter plans. I hope more members can get
involved in nearby primaries such as
Delaware or New Jersey, which are coming
up on Feb. 5." Continued Swat political
involvement will not end with winter break,
and the College Republicans and College
Democrats groups are likely to collaborate
in the future. The Swarthmore Students for

for the upcoming New Jersey primary.

the Dems [do] not endorse candidates in the
primary, we are excited about the potential
for volunteering for all the candidates and
especially the nominee as soon as he or she
is chosen."

"Looking forward, especially given the
overwhelming number of states voting on
Super Tuesday, it seems likely that we will
have a firm nominee selected within the
next several weeks. Once that takes place,
we are excited to work with the campaign in
Delaware County, especially given how
important Pennsylvania will probably be in
the next presidential election," Weston con-

tinued.

"We will also be re-connecting with more
local campaigns and elected officials. For
instance, we look forward to welcoming
Representative Sestak back to campus and
are currently working on scheduling a visit
from him. It is always exciting to be a part of
College Democrats during an election year

and this November looks to be particularly
exhilarating."

Professor sketches stories of Abu Ghraib detainees
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu
Visiting assistant professor of art Daniel
who is currently on leave, has
recently returned from Istanbul, Turkey
and Amnan, Jordan after completing a
series of prints detailing the thoughts and
experiences of former detainees who were
victims to torture and abuse in the Abu
Ghraib prison in Iraq.
According to Heyman, the inspiration
for his artwork came from reading articles
about the alleged torture of Iraqi detainees
by members of the U.S. Army Reserve.
"Ever since the photos from Abu Ghraib
came out, I've been very concerned that
Americans are...using the war on terrorism to lower safeguards against human
rights
I found it very upsetting and started making some of the work that I was
doing at the time reflect the torture problem by incorporating some of the images of
Abu Ghraib in some of my pictures,"
Heyman,

...

Heyman

said.

After integrating the images of the Abu
Ghraib detainees into his artwork for about
a year, Heyman became dissatisfied with

the "übiquitous" nature of his sources and
decided to pursue a more direct way of presenting the voices of the victims through
his work.
At this point, Heyman met Susan Burke,
a lawyer in Philadelphia, whose firm Burke
O'Neil LLC was responsible for the prosecution of the torture victims' cases.
The lawsuit was against-two firms,
Titan Corporation and CACI International,
Inc., that were hired to provide translators
and interrogators. The class action complaint was also filed against an interrogator and two linguists working for either of
the firms for committing the "series of tortious acts".
Burke invited Heyman to travel with
the law firm to the Middle East, which pro-

vided him with the opportunity to speak to

and see the torture victims face to face
while the firm conducted preliminary

interviews.
"For the most part, it was a very simple
process. I draw the portraits of the people

that were telling us what happened, and
write down what they remember. I don't
edit what I write down," Heyman said. In
his artwork, Heyman not only captured the

expressions and postures of the detainees
being interviewed but simultaneously
wrote down their words as the translator
provided them, making for an interesting
synthesis of first and third person perspectives as the translator would take on the
detainees' voices at times and retain his

own at others.
"When I got access to the victims of torture, I wanted people to pay attention
specifically to exactly what [was] being
heard"... It's very rare that you can just get
the unmediated voice, especially if it something as politically sensitive as torture," he
said.
For his printmaking, Heyman used a
technique called dry point. This process
involved scratching a copper plate With a
diamond pointed stylus.
"An edition printer prints it for me in
Philadelphia. It's extremely direct. There's
nothing else you have to do to the plate,"
Heyman said. "Another technique I've been
using involves watercolors and gouache
paints. I use a brush and write down what
[the detainees] say in watercolor."

In addition to his work with the Abu

Ghraib

prison

detainees, Heyman has

recently done similar portrait work with

the victims and survivors of the
Blackwater shootings at the Nisour Square
in Baghdad, Iraq on Sep. 16.
According to Heyman, Blackwater gunmen from a four car envoy and helicopters
opened fire on the square for 15 minutes,
resulting in 16 deaths and many wounded.
For this particular tragedy, Heyman
also sat in on preliminary interviews of the
witnesses and the loved ones of the direct
victims of the shootings. One interviewee
was a male doctor who had lost his wife and
son to the shootings.
Heyman wrote of this experience in a
journal during his stay at Istanbul: "He
spoke in English and was extremely articulate, at times even poetic, and listening to
his descriptions of his love for his wife and
son, and their love for their family, their
hopes and accomplishments, was heart
breaking and leaves a wound that every
American should try to feel as we glibly say
of such violence, 'Well, bad things happen
in a war.'"
Heyman's artwork detailing the person-

al voices of the victims of war-torn Iraq has
garnered the attention of his colleagues as
well as various exhibition libraries.
"I have visited his studio and looked at
his work with him," said Louise Lincoln,
Director of the DePaul University Museum
of Art in Chicago. "First of all, it is very
good. He's a very good draftsman, which is
to say he's technically very good as a printmaker in drawing."
"I also think he's found a remarkably
powerful way to give voice to people who
have been crucially involved in important
events, but whose identity and presence
has not been visible for us in the U.5.,"
Lincoln continued. "He understands that
these people are individuals who have
names [and] their own experiences and
that is very important."
Lincoln has become familiar with
Heyman's work in preparation for an
upcoming exhibit at the museum. The
exhibit will display the various works
Heyman has done on former detainees of
Iraq, among other similarly themed pieces.
"It has been about the excitement
[Heyman] has felt to being able to connect
his art to something that is so representative of our times," chair of the art department Syd Carpenter said. "It's something
that is so central to the core of what we are
thinking of ourselves as a nation."
Carpenter has yet to see any of the actual prints of Heyman's most recent work,
but knows about his work on the Abu
Ghraib detainees from what she has discussed with Heyman.
In addition to the DePaul University
Museum of Art, exhibitions of Heyman's
artwork will be held at the Samuel Dorsky
Museum of Art at SUNY New Paltz, the
New York Public Library and the North
Dakota Museum of Art.

Summer housing shifts from ML to Parrish
BY MATT BLEIMAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

In years past, students who needed to
stay on campus over the summer could
rent housing at Swarthmore's off-campus
dorm, Mary Lyon. This summer, the
housing will be moved from Mary Lyon

to Parrish.

All Thanks to Remodeling
Summer housing is coordinated
through the Facilities and Services
Office by Director of Summer Programs
Tricia Maloney. According to Maloney,
Mary Lyon needs some paint and carpeting done, and the facilities need to be
clear for the renovations to occur most

easily.

"Parrish has the number of beds we
need and it does not have any work being
done on it this summer," Maloney said.
She has heard from only a few students
asking about the change but has not

"It is also not such a long
hike from Parrish [as
opposed to Mary Lyon]."
Lorenzo Ramirez 'lO
received any feedback on it.
There is no decision yet on the future
of summer housing. "We make the decision on a year-to-year basis on what
dorms are being used," she said.
Housing coordinator Liz Derickson 'Ol
explained why Mary Lyon has been used
for summer housing in the past. "[Mary
Lyon] is normally the summer housing
location because it is primarily occupied
by non-seniors. This means that summer
residents can move in at the end of classes," Derickson said. "[Mary Lyon] also
has a good capacity for summer housing:
[approximately]. 100." She added that
though Willets is similar to Mary Lyon in
that regard, it is instead used for
Commencement housing.
She also believes that the switch may
not be permanent. Because there are
many senior residents in Parrish, it is
difficult to make the transition from the
school year to summer. This is a major
reason why Mary Lyon is used. Since
there are typically fewer seniors in the
dorm compared to other large-occupency
residence halls, the students are gone in
time for housing to be available for the
summer.

"[Mary Lyon] is normally
the summer housing
location because it is
primarily occupied by
non-seniors."
Liz Derickson 'Ol
Housing Coordinator
Walk a Mile in an ML-er's Shoes
Lorenzo Ramirez 'lO was one of the
students who inhabited Mary Lyon last
summer while doing research on the deer
population in the area. "Part of it was
good because you would wake up and go
to work and come back off campus,"
Ramirez said. "It felt like it was not at

THE PHOENIX

school because you went home, cooked
dinner, watched a movie, and went off
to work again the next day."
While he saw the benefits of living
off-campus over the summer, Ramirez
did not find the situation to be perfect.
"It can get really boring unless you are
doing something constantly," he said.
He also said that it could get very hot
in the non-air-conditioned dorm.
Though the issue of heat is often
ignored during the school year, the
excessive summer heat made living in
Mary Lyon uncomfortable for students.
Because of Mary Lyon's flaws,
Ramirez believes that Parrish will be a
better host for summer housing.
"It if gets hot you can come down to

the first floor whereas at Mary Lyon
you have to come on campus for air
conditioning. It is also not such a long
hike from Parrish," he said. Ramirez
said that the combination of the heat
and distance made it necessary to
leave early in the morning to get to
work on time.
Despite the disadvantages of sum-

mer housing in Mary Lyon (lack of air
conditoning, distance from campus),
Ramirez, who also lives in Mary Lyon
this school year, was content with it.
He found it to be much more social
than during the school year, which he
attributed to the fact that no one wants
to be in his or her hot room. Being off
campus also gave him a sense of
removal. "It did feel like you were on
your own and allowed you to become
more individual," he said.

If all goes according to plan, those biding their time at Swat over the summer will spend
the warmer months in the year on the halls of Parrish as opposed to Mary Lyon, which
will be closed for renovations.

Regarding the transition to Parrish,

"Stop and frisk" to curb crime in Philly
BY SARAH PETERSON
Last year, The Phoenix covered former Philadelphia
mayor John Street's support of a community movement
calling for a total of ten thousand men to volunteer in
their neighborhoods in response to the escalating homicide rate in .the city. This year, the newly-inaugurated
Mayor Michael Nutter is taking a different approach,
and hopes that it will only take ten weeks to turn the tide
against violent crime and homicide.
But Nutter
elected in November and sworn in on
Jan. 7
isn't underestimating the city's present crisis.
Among the many initiatives characterizing the mayor's
plans for improving the city, the "Safety Now" crime initiative is perhaps the most forceful and ambitious: following his swearing-in, he announced that he intends to
see the homicide rate drop by 30 to 50 percent in the next
three to five years.

"This stop and frisk is going to be a
disaster... Again, it's going to be the
police against the communty. And I
think that would be a disaster."
Sylvester Johnson
former Philadelphia Police
Commissioner
The details of his plan, however, have also made it the
most controversial.
Emphasizing the need to quickly halt the gunfire and
violence before beginning to address the social and economic challenges underlying the crisis, the mayor has
declared upon his arrival in office a temporary state of
emergency in afflicted neighborhoods throughout the
city. He is mandating through cooperation with the
police that what the Safety Now proposal refers to as
"constitutional 'stop and frisk'" searches become regular
practice citywide. But many are discussing whether
these strategies
however effective they may prove
nevertheless run the risk of alienating citizens and
infringing upon their rights.
A year ago, Nutter released a "Safety Now" proposal
as part of his campaign for mayoral office. Subtitled "Ten
Weeks to a Safer Philadelphia," the anti-crime proposal
included plans to declare a state of emergency in the city
vis-a-vis the rate of violent crime and to identify "target
enforcement zones" where increased police presence and
curfews will be implemented.
"Under Title 10 of the Philadelphia Code, the mayor
can declare '"partial martial law, in parts of the city that
are afflicted by crime and disorder,'" explained Ralph
Taylor, a professor in the department of Criminal Justice
at Temple University.
Most discussion has centered, however, on Nutter's
promotion of the practice of 'stop and frisk' tactics to
recover illegal weapons from those who may be carrying
them in public.
In the targeted enforcement zones, Taylor said,
trained police will have enhanced powers allowing them
to stop whomever they want, as long as they have reasonable suspicion that the suspect might be armed.
Nutter additionally hopes that by making the public

aware of the stop and frisk strategy, would-be criminals
will be less likely to carry illegal weapons.
According to a Philadelphia Inquirer article that ran
on Jan. 1 this year, the current tally of homicides that
occurred in Philadelphia during 2007 is at 392

argue reasonable suspicion since the individual being
stopped might, in fact, be carrying a legal weapon.
Officers are trained to detect when someone is carrying
a weapon, but there's no way of knowing that weapon's
legal status. "When you talk about constitutional stop
and frisk, I'm not sure if that's consistent with stopping
everyone you think might be carrying a gun," Roper

said.

An additional concern is how Nutter's policy could
further strain the relationship between police and citizens.

"What Nutter is saying

this stop and frisk is

tion. "Unless the

community buys into

gun violence is apparent. Their constitutionality, many
argue, is less explicit.
Legal grounds for the stop and frisk dates back to 1968,
when the Supreme Court ruled in Terry v. Ohio that it
was constitutional (i.e., not in violation of the Fourth
Amendment) for an officer to stop and pat down (or
"frisk") someone in public if that officer had reasonable
suspicion of a crime being committed.

some of these

things, it's going to be an adversarial relationship
Again, it's going to be the police against the community.
And I think that would be a disaster."
"In the 1970s and 'Bos, the Philadelphia police were
nationally famous for being not only brutal, but also
very biased, particularly against African-Americans,"
Roper said. The ACLU brought and settled a lawsuit
against the city in the 1990s that said the police were targeting ethnic minorities "for exactly these kinds of
stop and frisk, loitering tickets, things that
things
aren't about serious crime, but constant police harassment and surveillance of people."
Following the lawsuit, Roper said, the city was
required for many years to track the reports of stops, the
reasons for stops and the race of individuals being
stopped.
More recently, a 2003 study by Temple University
found that citizens generally thought well of the police.
However, "one in five did not think police respected their
basic rights; one in four did not think police treated people equally; one in three thought police stopped people
without good reason."
These figures were cited by Taylor in his "Remarks to
the New Mayor" presentation at St. Joseph's University
during a "Public Forum on Violence in Philadelphia"
last February. In interview, Taylor confirmed that these
doubts and concerns about police bias often carried out
...

across racial lines.

"There's a continuum of police interactions. The basic premise is that
the more intrusive the police action
or search, the more justification they
have to have for it."
Mary Catherine Roper
Staff Atorney for ACLU-PA
Taylor acknowledged the concerns many have about
the disintegration of civil liberties and police-community relations. However, he said, "the other thing that people need to bear in mind is that if there were something
simple that could be done, people would already have
done it. This is something that is hugely problematic.
Philadelphia is in pretty serious trouble, as are lots of
other cities."
Finally, Taylor said, "It's not so much a question of, 'is
it the right idea or not?' The real question here is, 'how
will it be implemented, and how will it be monitored?'"
January 24, 2008

The question of monitoring was answered by

Deputy

Director of the Police Advisory Commission Kelvyn

Anderson.
The PAC is an oversight agency that represents the
interests of the citizens of Philadelphia and works closely with the police department and city officials to investigate allegations of police misconduct, as well as to consider department policies and practices.
"We're going to look at all the stops and determine for
ourselves what happens, and report those results to the
police commissioner, the mayor and the public,"
Anderson said.

"If there were something simple that
could be done, people would
already have done it. This is something that is hugely problematic."

"There's a continuum of police interactions," said
Catherine Roper, a staff attorney with the
American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. "The
basic premise is that the more intrusive the police action
or search, the more justification they have to have for
it."
For a police officer to stop a citizen and search for
weapons, he or she must reasonably suspect that the
individual being stopped is in the process of committing
a crime. Due to the seemingly broad criteria for reasonable suspicion, much is left to the judgment of the officer,
which makes some people nervous about whether race
will be inappropriately used as justification for a search.
Moreover, if the supposed crime being committed is
possession of an illegal weapon, then it is difficult to
Mary

spetersl@swarthmore.edu

Anderson and the PAC have looked closely at the
results of targeted enforcement in New York and are on
the lookout for problems similar to those experienced
there, including an increase in citizen complaints.
"We really want to try and tease out those incidents
in which police are being excessively or inappropriately
aggressive," Anderson said. "In Philadelphia and also in
New York, part of the way that this is monitored is filling out more paperwork in terms of stops, and what the
reasons for those stops are."
Regarding the fraught history of abuse and mistrust
between police and citizens in Philadelphia, Anderson
pointed out that things have changed over the past twenty years.

"Those are things that happened quite a while ago;
department is very different now. Philly
police have more minorities and women than any major
department in the nation, and that is a result of the past,
and lawsuits and some distinct efforts by folks in
Philadelphia to change the character of the department," Anderson said.
Taylor, Roper and Anderson all remain hopeful that
the strategies will be carried out both successfully and
fairly, making the city safer and also improving the relationship between citizens and police. If citizens see that
the initiatives are being carried out effectively and fairly, that impression could go a long way, Taylor said.
"You've got very good people in place
if anyone can
get it done, it's Ramsey," Taylor said, referring to
Nutter's newly-appointed Police Commissioner Charles
Ramsey, who was formerly the chief of police in
Washington, D.C. Ramsey is currently conducting meetings with the Philadelphia community as he puts together his official crime response plan. The plan, publicly
requested by Nutter, is due by the end of this month.
"Charles Ramsey is a big proponent of community
policing. [He's talking about] putting police on their
feet, not in cars, in those neighborhoods. If he does that,
it could go a long way to changing the character of these
the police

communities," Roper said.
In the meantime, Roper said, she and the ACLU will
continue to field complaints and go out into the communities to inform citizens of their rights.
Meanwhile, with so much discussion centering on
targeted enforcement, not as much attention has been
paid to what long-term preventative measures will follow once the crisis has subsided. "Safety Now" also
includes provisions for preventing crime through social
and economic programs
not just through policing.
Nutter intends to expand the Youth Violence Reduction
Program, which has already proven successful in the
neighborhoods where it exists. He also intends to curtail
the incidence of repeat offenses by promoting the hiring
of ex-prisoners and through new jobs and tax credits for
organizations who hire and retain ex-prisoners. Finally,
Nutter has declared his intent to work with both local
and state officials to pass stronger gun control legislation.

Green businesses provide economic boost
BY EMILY MARTINEZ
DAILY CALIFORNIAN (UC-BERKELEY)
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.
Going
green may do more than just help the
environment, according to a new study of
Berkeley's green businesses.
-

The study, by Raquel Pinderhughes, a
at San Francisco State
professor
University, suggests that environmentally
friendly businesses in Berkeley have created economic opportunities for unskilled
workers, providing an alternative to bluecollar jobs. At Tuesday's debut of the
study, Mayor Tom Bates, a proponent of
green businesses, said the study would
raise awareness for an emerging market
and asserted his commitment to supporting the growing environmental economy.
"There are tremendous opportunities
in creating a green economy," Bates said.
"People are talking about green jobs and
the green wave. It's the new vogue."
Over the past two years, Pinderhughes
interviewed employers and workers in 21
different green businesses in Berkeley.
This was the first such study conducted,
Pinderhughes said.

The study assessed the potential for
in the Bay Area to provide high-quality jobs to workers with
barriers to employment, such as those
with limited formal education.
green businesses

"Often, as we improve
environmental quality, we
neglect to address social
equality and end up
displacing people."
Raquel Pinderhughes
San Fransisco State
University Professor
She found most jobs did not require a
high level of skill for entry. Many also
provided on-the-job training and opportunities for advancement.
The majority of the businesses were in
economic sectors likely to experience sig-

nificant growth, an important factor considering the possibility of an economic
recession, Pinderhughes said.
"Going in, we didn't know if these
green-collar jobs were worth fighting
for," she said. "But we found a lot of
excitement in these jobs. They have
excellent wages, uniformly high levels of
benefits and offer inherently meaningful,

community-oriented work."
Pinderhughes said the creation of the
new jobs had the potential to solve both
environmental and social problems by
creating jobs that have positive ecological impacts.
"Often, as we improve environmental
quality, we neglect to address social
equality and end up displacing people,"
Pinderhughes said.
While some Berkeley business owners
applauded the study and said they too felt
it would help expand the green economy,
they also said they hoped the movement
would stay grounded.
"The study will become an engine to
drive an agenda, a political agenda if
we're not careful," said Gene Agress, an
owner of Berkeley Mills, one of the busi-

nesses that participated in the study. "If
this report starts out political, I think
that it will suffer an untimely death."
Some residents expressed concern that
the local controversies over zoning in
West Berkeley may bleed over into this
issue.

But Pinderhughes said the movement
would survive politics.
"I'm not worried about politicizing
this at all," she said. "I think that this is
the perfect time to have this discussion."
In December, Bates joined UC
Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau,
Steven Chu,
director of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, and the
mayors of Oakland, Richmond and
Emeryville in signing a pledge to support
environmental causes in the East Bay,
such as renewable energy and green business.
City Councilmember Darryl Moore,
who represents West Berkeley, said he
saw a bright future for the green movement.

"We should celebrate the study;, that's
will benefit West Berkeley, the city
and the green [movement]," he said.

Popular Facebook pastime "Scrabulous" threatened by lawsuit
BY CAROLYN MCGOUGH
DAILY BRUIN (UCLA)
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES Scrabulous, an online version of the game Scrabble, has become one of the most
widely used applications on Facebook, adding just another reason for UCLA students to spend time on the socialnetworking Web site.
But Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc., who own the rights to
Scrabble, which is unaffiliated with Scrabulous, are not
so thrilled with the sudden popularity of the online
game. And as Hasbro and Mattel threaten legal action,
claiming copyright and trademark infringement, thousands of Facebook users are fighting to rescue the online
-

game.

"Scrabulous is something new and fun to do on
Facebook," said Kyle Wood, a second-year undeclared
student. "I think it would be a shame to take the application off Facebook, because it's letting kids from our generation rediscover a classic board game."
Scrabulous has become popular among Facebook
users because of its innovative spin on a new game and
its accessibility, Wood said.
Others like Scrabulous because it brings a game from
students' youth to the 21st-century age of the Internet.

"What consumers may not realize is
that Scrabulous is an illegally copied
online version of the world's most
popular word game."

"Before I saw Scrabulous on Facebook, I hadn't really
played Scrabble since I was a kid," said Babak
Shahrivar, a third-year English student. "The coolest
thing about Scrabulous was that you could access it right
online."
Normally, Facebook is used by students to keep in
touch with friends, Shahrivar said, but Scrabulous arose
when Facebook needed something new. The application
reaches out to anyone looking for entertainment on the
site beyond perusing photos and writing on friends'
walls, he said. Scrabulous allows users not only to keep
in touch with friends, but to challenge them.
THE PHOENIX

"Scrabulous is a good way to kill time and test your
mental abilities," said Jason Wyman, second-year political science student. "It's a fun way to compete against
your friends and see how you match up to them."
Scrabulous users, like Shahrivar and Wyman, are putting up a fight at least 40 different "Save Scrabulous"
groups have popped up on Facebook, the largest of which
has attracted over 45,000 members.
The founder of the largest "Save Scrabulous"
Facebook group, for instance, is Jason Madhosingh, a 30year-old New Yorker who works in marketing.
"I actually started the group a few months ago when
Scrabulous was having problems with its Web server,"
Madhosingh said. "I was trying to rally people to donate
money to help Scrabulous improve the servers and to
help people play Scrabble. Since that time it's really
taken a life of its own, and it's been amazing to see people so passionate about this brand."
Wood said the uproar caused by Hasbro's legal
threats is a result of the sheer convenience of
Scrabulous.
The game is turn-based, with one partner playing at a
time. It does not require players to be online simultaneously, and multiple games can be played at any one time.

"Despite how much I really like to play Scrabble,"
Wood said. "I usually don't have the time to get out a
board, find all the tiles, and locate a partner to play with,
so I don't play. But Scrabulous, an online version of a
game I really like, lets me play with friends."
Scrabulous allows players to take as much or as little
time as they want on a game, Wood said, perfect for college students with busy schedules.
"I don't have to sit down for hours to play," he said.
"Using Scrabulous, I can play for a while, leave, and
then come back to my game."
Madhosingh said what Scrabulous fans really want is
to be acknowledged by the companies who own Scrabble.
"I think there are a lot of consumers who just want to
engage," he said. "What they're looking for is largely a
reaction and interaction with these companies. I think
that what they're all really apprehensive about is that

will be no engagement with them as consumers
and as people interested in this brand."
Many Scrabble fans, whether players online or on a
board, simply want to know that Hasbro and Mattel are
listening, he said.
"A lot of people are very frustrated that they can't get
anything but a form letter from these companies," he
said. Madhosingh referred to a letter sent out by
there

January 24, 2008

Scrabble officials urging fans to switch to legal Scrabble
sites. The letter is the only acknowledgement fans have
gotten thus far.
"We are not surprised that fans have thoroughly
enjoyed playing Scrabulous on Facebook.com," Scrabble
officials said in the letter. "What consumers may not
realize, however, is that Scrabulous is an illegally copied
online version of the world's most popular word game."

"I think Scrabulous could really get

The founders of Scrabulous, as well as Scrabble
founders Hasbro and Mattel, could not be reached for

comment.

Hasbro Inc. owns the rights to the word game in the
U.S. and Canada, while Mattel Inc. owns the rights elsewhere.
The online version of the game was created by Rajat
Agarwalla and Jayant Agarwalla, two brothers from
Calcutta, India.
The game is one of the top 10 most downloaded applications on Facebook, according to ABC News, and can
also be played at the Agarwallas' Web site.
Scrabulous attracts 545,478 daily active users, accord-

ing to the application's Web site.
But, despite its popularity, the online version of the
game infringes on Hasbro's trademark, Hasbro
spokesman Gary Serba said in a statement to ABC News.
The company is discussing options with the parties
involved, hoping to find a solution.
Fans of the virtual Scrabble game are crossing their
fingers that it will be saved.
"I think Scrabulous could really get people back into
Scrabble," Wyman said. "And that's what Hasbro missed.
They're protecting their interests, but also taking the
chance that a new generation of Scrabble players was

With Swarthmore graduate Justin
Hall '9B pioneering a more personal
style of writing in the mid 19905, the
blog has become an extensive and
often intimate medium.
History professor Timothy Burke
has been an active blogger since 2002
when he began Easily Distracted,
home to his ruminations on "culture,
politics and other shiny objects." A
veteran web user, Burke saw blogging
as "the next natural evolution of a
kind of online writing that I had been
doing ever since I had been a graduate

student."
Like Burke, film professor Bob

on various online forums when he

began his blog, Graphic Engine, six

the unique vocal platform that blogging offers them. While maintaining a
fairly academic tone, both use their
blogs to explore a variety of topics
from a more personal standpoint.
"I feel free to indulge there my
likes and dislikes, fannish excitement
and grouchy kvetching," Rehak said,
"But it's also a sketchpad for roughing out ideas and arguments."
Blogging allows Burke and Rehak to
share these varied thoughts with an

array of readers within and outside of
academia.
The fact that students are included
among the readers of Burke and
Rehak's blogs has never posed a problem. Both professors enjoy having students either post a comment on their

Film professor Bob Rehak was inspired by other academic blogs to start his blog

blogs or respond to an entry in person. "College, perhaps Swarthmore in
particular, is a place to develop your
voice and hone critical thinking
skills, so I'm always happy when I can

exchange ideas with someone," Rehak

said.

According to both Burke and
Rehak, there are a fair number of
Swarthmore students and alumni who
keep tabs on their blogs.
"It makes me think a professor is
pretty cool if they have a blog, generally, and it's nice to see them as fullyrounded people with families and
lives rather than just as professors,"
Lauren Stokes 'O9 said.
Although students are eager to
engage professors in discussions concerning their blogs, the role that blogs
do and should ultimately play in the
classroom is still very much up in the

air.
Both Burke and Rehak have experimented with using blogs in their
courses. Burke uses Easily Distracted
to post syllabi in addition to a number
of extended essays including his Last

says that blogs encourage "collective
conversation on course topics outside
the classroom, as well as in getting
students to pool knowledge and share
resources."
Burke also believes that blogs help
students think through issues at hand
with "reflective and personal writing." Yet, Burke acknowledges that

"When I have something I want to

across the country can do that over

Martin Luther

King,

Jr.

The Swarthmore community remembers the Civil Rights leader with three days of scheduled events

own words: "What is needed is a
realization that power without love is
reckless and abusive, and love without
power is sentimental and anemic. Power at
its best is love implementing the demands
of justice, and justice at its best is power
correcting everything that stands against
love." The same themes were woven into
the reflections of the students on the panel.
The panel was moderated by Matt
Armstead 'O9 and included five student
panelist, Romane Paul 'lO, Sarah Apt 'lO,
Markus Schlotterbeck 'lO, Keith Benjamin
'O9 and Marissa Davis 'OB, who all eloKing's

quently provided insight and personal
experience. "I appreciated how each person spoke about a different aspect of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy,"
Schlotterbeck said. The diversity of the
panel and the audience, including both
students and faculty, combined with the
universality of the message,

was inspiring.

Paul started the discussion withreferences to Hurricane Katrina and the Jena 6.
He emphasized the three important chal-

lenges of maintaining unity, wrapping oneself around a central issue, and taking
action to create change. Apt mentioned the
significance of applying King's message to
the immigration issues today. She used
King's point that "true justice can't be
achieved until justice can be experienced
by everyone" to support her statement.

"I appreciated how

Schlotterbeck shared a personal experience about Somalian immigrants entering
the small towns of Lewiston and Auburn,
Maine. He said that seeing members of the
community rally in support of diversity
showed him "Martin Luther King Jr.'s
dream and what it looks like today."
Benjamin began with a captivating story
about his trip to Ghana over winter break.
He quoted King "I cannot sit idly by in
Atlanta and not be concerned about what

happens in Birmingham. Injustice any
where is a threat to justice everywhere.'
Benjamin expanded this idea and paral
leled the conditions in Birmingham in the
1960s with the issues in Chester, PA and in
Darfur today to show the continuing rele
vance of King's statement. He stressed the
value of finding one's own dream. Davis
also talked about personal experiences anc

"Change is change, no matter how small or

When the panel was opened for discus
sion, a variety of questions came up. One
student expressed feelings of being over
whelmed by unfortunate events that occur
despite protests and rallies. The panelists
and audience also recognized that
racism was not displayed in the same
ways in the 1960s as it is now and
responses to acts of discrimination
can vary from the protests of the

Martin Luther King, Jr.
Recently, I went to check out the new sculpture that
local artist Marty Long created out of the remnants of the
once magnificent Bender Oak that stood on the path to the
Faulkner Tennis Courts. This particular oak was estimated to be anywhere from 150 to 350 years old, certainly here
long before the College was established, and its botanical
name is Quercus x benderi. (The "x" indicates the oak's
status as a hybrid of Q. coccinea and Q. rubra).
According to Arboretum Visitor Programs Coordinator
Rebecca Robert, the tree's status as a naturally occurring
hybrid made it unique since most hybrids are intentionally created by arborists and don't occur, as this one did, by
chance in nature. Robert also stated that it was partially
the rarity of this type of tree that led to the decision to celebrate it with a sculpture.
The oak had been deteriorating for a number of years,
and after the decision to cut it down was made, the
Collections Committee at the Arboretum asked Marty
Long to create an art piece commemorating the tree. The
Arboretum knew about Marty through his work at the
Morris Arboretum, where he had created a "green man
mask" comprised of many carved leaves. Long, though
now a prolific wood sculptor, did not start out working in
this medium. He began his career, in fact, at culinary
school, where he went from carving butter and chocolate to
carving ice, even winning a silver medal at the World Ice

Art Champions. At present, he works entirely on commission and carves primarily in wood. Long stated that
although he has progressed from materials far less permanent than wood, he enjoys creating art that has a definite
life span (he estimates this sculpture will last between 10
and 20 years) because he sees art as being "like music it
stays for a period of time and then can be remembered."
Long created the sculpture over winter break, beginning on Dec. 22 and finishing up just under a month later
on Janl9. The sculpture, for those who have yet to see it, is
in theform of an oak leaf and acorn. The basic motif for the
sculpture was provided by the Arboretum, although Long
was given a great deal of creative freedom. "The committee
suggested a sculpture, an ode to oaks Marty took it from
there," Robert said.
Swarthmore students have had a variety of reactions to
the art piece. Even though Stephan Lefebvre 11, like most
first-years, never saw the Bender Oak while it was living,
he appreciated the sculpture and its skillful execution: "I
like the smooth finish...it's great." Anjali Jaiman 10, however, preferred the stump: "I could climb and play in it,
[but] now it's Art." The next time you are on your way to
Olde Club, take a small detour and take a look at the sculpture to see what you think of the latest addition to
Swarthmore's campus.

Taking pride in doing nothing over break

BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS
azalokol@swarthmore.edu

The start of every semester seems to perpetually keep
the most cherished of high school traditions alive: the
"What did you do over summer vacation?" essay question.
At Swarthmore, this question takes on the form of the
automated "Hi! How are you? What did you do over
break?" greeting. For those of us who spent winter break
eating Nutella out of the jar and watching reruns of "Deal
or No Deal," stories of how someone down the hall spent
the month building homes for amputee child soldiers with
tuberculosis often induceboth feelings of nausea and inadequacy.
But there's no reason to feel bad about having done
"nothing," I say. Though overachieving do-gooders may be

more vocal about their experiences working with presidential candidates, there's just as much pride in sitting
around as there is in volunteering, and you get quite a bit
out of it, too.
While some of you were out campaigning for presidential candidates, the rest of us slept until 2 p.m. everyday,
watched "Futurama" marathons, played Mario Kart on
N64, exponentially increased the speed with which we
could find words on a Boggle board through constant practice and ended at least four out of the seven nights of the
week with a trip to 7-Eleven. "I spent twelve hours straight
by the pool with my mom," Anagha Krishnan 'lO said. "We
just kept ordering Mojitos and fries, and more Mojitos and

that I wasn't going to see my family for another four
months so I decided to start spending time with them."
Other students, like Sara Lipshutz 11, were slightly
more productive, but still didn't really partake in anything
that might ever qualify as resume-building.

days. Then I realized I wasn't going

"When I came home, I found that my family was really
busy. I didn't really have a lot of stress, having just come
back from my first semester at college. I saw how crazy
they all were, and took on the sort of 'maid' or 'housekeeper' position at home I did the cleaning, laundry, dishes,
but also the cooking. I experimented with lasagnas, I made
a couple of stir-fries, I did all the grocery shopping and I
learned to make my own pesto! So I learned how to feed my
family over break. I wasn't cooking because I had to, I was
cooking because I was having a blast," said Lipshutz.
Some might call this "doing nothing" over break, but
that simply isn't true. Sell your soul to 8 a.m. alarms if you
want, but there are certain things that you get out of
"doing nothing" that you can't from research or internships: closer interpersonal relationships, a clear mind, a
rejuvenated attitude, a better understanding of what you
want, a renewed sense of determination, or maybe even
better bowling skills, a greater vocabulary oran increased
understanding of how to navigate your way through New
York City streets.
Partaking in activities that you can't put on a resume
doesn't mean that you "did nothing" over break. There is
still value in doing things that aren't necessarily the most
directly useful. Khan grew closer to her mom, Cubuk spent
some much-needed time with his family and Lipshutz
learned how to cook some new meals. We all, hopefully, got
some rest, and came back to campus, well, maybe not
ready to work, but at least much more relaxed. Breaks are
called breaks precisely because that's just what they are
intended to be a time to take it easy. What other time in
your life are you going to be able to sit on your butt for a
month but now? And there is absolutely nothing shameful
about that.

that is collapsed into with the knowledge
that the first thing you will see in the
morning isn't a flickering computer screen

However, after the recuperative period
ends, the over-long break can often
devolve into a stupefying sequence of family events and meeting the children of various high school friends that leaves us

This malaise of inaction is further complicated by the immediate difficulties facing the four returning classes. For freshmen, the dream-like academic joy ride is

sophomores must somehow assign an identity to their directionless, slumping lives,
juniors have to either deal with a housing

laid-back study abroad was, and sophomores AND juniors have to rush now that

columns are ex post facto, in a sense to write a purportedly facts-based account of an experience first requires the
experience to have taken place but my shoestring budget
requires me to write about travels that have already come
and gone, namely those I encountered traipsing about
Hungary and its neighbors last fall. In that sense, perhaps
my column is ex ex post facto; for the ex ex ex post facto version, pick up an adult magazine.
At best, I hope it will be poignant, evocative and generally a testament to those experiences that tie us together on
some fundamental, human level; at worst, it will be mildly
aggravating, like dandruff, or like unloading your wash into

line-dancing, bonfire-ing, lake swimming... You get the idea.

and a lot ofcoffee (all luxuries I was soon forced to do largely without), I was spirited away six hours south to zombie
my way through opening my second bank account and then
a staid dinner in an Indian restaurant with my family and
my sister's oldest friend.
Day three: A late night of frantic packing, another handful of sleep and I was off again, this time to a retinal appoint-

more moderate brick apartments like my own. Streets are
narrow, and public transportation can be found wherever
you turn your head. When I arrived, I shared the city with
the Cow Parade, so painted Plexiglas cows also had a tendency to turn up unexpectedly.
The third dinner, in the course of my 72 hour sprint, was
off Oktogon Square (home of a yellow cow and a milkshake

CROSSWORD

Swarthraore Professor K. David Harrison, a worldrenowned author and editor, has traveled extensively
around the world to study and record dying languages, facing many challenges along the way. But one thing he has
never experienced before is the Sundance Film Festival.
"We've been getting incredibly enthusiastic responses,"
Harrison said over the phone, still deep in the throes of
Sundance, complete with movie star sightings. "It's pretty
amazing for a couple of nerdy scientists."
The two "nerdy scientists" to wheom Harrison is referring to are himself and Gregory Anderson, directors of the
Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages.
Harrison and Anderson are at Sundance because they are

"There have been seven screenings, and each time they
open it up for Q&A [after the film], they have to kick us out

track down the last speakers of endangered languages in
India, Siberia and Bolivia. Many risks and dangers were
encountered during the trip, including the difficulties of
reaching the remote, isolated areas where speakers of
endangered languages lived. The perils were frequent
enough that Harrison referred fondly to the trip as an
experiment in "adventure science."
Harrison particularly remembers an experience while
he was in India, during which he listened to a language
through headphones and had an "aha!" moment when he
heard numbers spoken in the language. He discovered that
the language had a unique counting system that was
incredibly complex —it used a base 12/base 20 system. "It

was

an exciting

moment," he said.

Harrison said he wondered throughout the trip, "Do last
speakers exist? Can we find them?" Two of the languages
that he has studied in the past, Tofa and Os, are each spoken by fewer than 30 people. There are an estimated 7,000
languages in the world, and nearly half of them are endangered, meaning that they face possible extinction. They are
predicted to die out before the end of the century.
Nabta Idries 'lO was receptive to the documentary. "I
feel like it's a science that doesn't get a lot of recognition,
especially since language is so crucial to human knowledge," she said. "I wouldn't have known [about critically
endangered languages] if it wasn't for the documentary."
Others, however, had some apprehensions about the
film. "I don't want linguistics to go mainstream," Alysha
Newton 'lO said.
When asked what he was doing next, Harrison suggested that being around the Hollywood crowd may have had

more of an influence on him than even he knew. "I have
some skiing planned for tomorrow," he said with a laugh.

Besides hitting the slopes, Harrison is currently in the
middle-of a project called the Enduring Voices Project that

the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages is
working on with National Geographic. As a part of the project, the two linguists developed a Language Hotspot Map
"designed to help map out areas around the planet where
language diversity is threatened and then visit and record
the last speakers," Harrison said.
The threat of language extinction is color-coded to represent low, medium, high and severe threats in the hotspots
on the map. This March, Harrison will be in India, and in
July, he will be in Bolivia, both of which received attention
in the documentary as hotspots with a low and severe
threat of language extinction, respectively.
All of Harrison's work has contributed to his goal to provide additional information to scientists about the nature
of language and its role in shaping culture.
He says he's most excited about the documentary

because he especially wants "young people to see what linguists can do because it is very rewarding."

the aftermath of the Apocalypse. The television stations are
also somewhat post-apocalyptic; everywhere you turn you

take a phrase from the immortal Dwight K. Schrute
all
because of the ongoing strike by the Writers Guild of
America.
The reasons for the strike have been documented exhaustively in many other places, so I won't go into them here.
Instead, I shall focus on ways to satisfy your TV craving for
the rest of the spring when, hopefully, the strike will have
been resolved, and the barren shores of television's landscape will once again be full of noisy, multi-faceted life. And
by life, I certainly don't mean reality television.
Lost: The weird, complex, fascinating saga that is
Lost starts up its fourth season on Jan. 31 Due to the
strike, only half the episodes (eight out of 16)
have been filmed, but I can predict now
that those eight episodes will be more
satisfying than the entire run of a
show like According to Jim. If you
don'twatch the show, I wouldn't suggest

PBS: Yes, I know, the connotations of PBS are boredom,
uptightness and endless pledge drives. However, the channel
carries some of the best television to come out of Great
Britain, such as the excellent Prime Suspect (starring Helen
Mirren). This spring, PBS will also be heaven for the many
Austenites out there, as it airs a series of six films, one for
each novel that Austen published, as well as a fictionalized
biopic that imagines a love life for the spinster. If you're into
period romance and comedies of manners, you may want to
check out PBS in the next few months.

instead, take the time that the strike has

about a place, please tell me.) I also know that the crafty bas-

sell them on iTunes, forcing their viewers to pay for the
channel in order to watch their shows. However, if you can
get your hands on either The Wire or Big Love, both shows
are well worth your time. The former, a sprawling crime

Critical Mass Media
Mass media. As inclined towards the
superficial as it may be, I'still find it a fascinating organism, which, in catering to
our most primal need for entertainment,
acts like a chemical trace on what is on our
collective mind, even as it actively shapes
it.
With every new innovation in media
technology, a boom of new concepts is generated and expands our vocabulary for
human experience. And what greater
upheaval of popular media has there been
in recent times than the advent of digital
video? Allowing the once divine visual
medium of cinema to slowly dissipate into
its less sanctified counterparts, television
and then the computer, it has both culturally and financially threatened the authority
of the movie theater. Today, people are
more and more willing to sacrifice quality
for convenience. The Internet is a powerful

media, the demise of the picture show
seemed all but inevitable several years ago,
and Hollywood readied itself for the battle
with M. Night Shyamalan helming the
ranks for the preservation of film tradition
and George Lucas in the other corner,
heralding the digital age for film. Although
the DVD has overtaken and effectively
killed the VHS, the anticipated collapse in
theater sales never quite happened.
Why is this the case? Does the movie theater continue to be as coveted a venue for

entertainment as it was before? An oft
given reason is the ferocity with which the
movie industry shoves blockbusters down
its audience's throats, advertising like
there's no tomorrow, so that every summer
the umpteenth Spider-Man movie will yet
again break box office records worldwide.

This explanation, however, is probably
more unkind to the film medium than it
should be.
I won't go as far as to follow traditionalists like Shyamalan in saying that film is
undeniably a superior medium. The debate
on whether digital video can trump film in
quality remains unresolved. In terms of resolution, both have their drawbacks. Digital
video is pixelated, while film has its grain,
which some will tell you makes for a
greater sense of realism or cinematic-ness.
It ultimately boils down to which aesthetics
are more acceptable. Film, with its century-

tainment.

Instead, the relationship between film

productions like this past year's "Zodiac"
and "Superman Returns") and film is also
adopting techniques usually reserved for
digital video. And with the rising prominence of personal videos ("home videos"
sounds like such a dated term by now) particularly on YouTube, shaky, handheld, lowres videos have just about become the
shorthand for documenting down and dirty
real life, a tradition arguably first brought
to mainstream consciousness in 1999's "The
Blair Witch Project," whose ingenious marketing campaign was a predecessor to this
month's much-hyped "Cloverfield."
In Hollywood, digital video only seems
to thrive either when masked by a huge
budget and state-of-the-art technology that
makes it as "cinematic" as possible or as an
elaborate gimmick that toys with a documentary aesthetic. But digital video is
showing exciting signs oflife and diversity

in a market far removed from the mainthat of the foreign art film.
This past winter break afforded me the
luxury of heading to New York's Museum of
Modern Art, where the Global Film
Initiative screens films from several "countries with develqping film communities"
every year around this time.
Among them, "Kubrador" from the
Philippines, follows three days in the life of

Amy through derelict alleyways
of Manila in very long takes. The camera
makes shaky, often stomach-turning movements. All of these qualities amount to the
sense that you're watching a documentary.

and tracks

But unlike "The Blair Witch Project" or
"Cloverfield," the fourth wall is never broken, giving "Kubrador" a much greater kin-

ship with neorealist films.
In spite of the ugliness of its digital
image, the camera still finds space to land
on some beautiful compositions, like a shot
of a slowly clearing sky after rain.
"Kubrador" has its surreal elements too, as

Amy's

open-ended close has little to do with the
story that proceeded it but nonetheless has
a heavy sense of pathos. The end is comple-

mented by the image of an indistinct mass
of people moving past Amy, their movements blurred in a way that only crappy
digital cameras can seem to capture, and it
hauntingly shatters the sense of real time
that the film had been playing on all along.
Watching "Kubrador" reminded me of
another country where film culture seems
to be wholly embracing DV, mainland
China. Because of its stunted movie history
under Mao and the preponderance of piracy
that makes theatergoing all but nonexist-

ent, Chinese filmmakers seem to have far
less loyalty to film. What's been produced
on DV in the past decade largely outside of
the state system, Jia Zhangke's films for
instance, hint at the great potential DV has
for other countries with emerging film cultures.

Approximately 30 minutes after the World Trade

Time to stand a-loan
We enthusiastically commend the recent
decision by the Board of Directors of the
College to eliminate the loan portion of financial aid for students currently receiving aid.
As we report this week in "Financial aid
loans become scholarships" (p. 4), the average
dollar value for a Swarthmore loan is $2,295
and accounts for the smallest part of financial
aid packages, or seven percent of contributions to financial aid overall. Two thirds of
the students currently on financial aid will

benefit from the decision, with the remaining
students already exempt from the loan component in their current aid packages. That
amounts to over 500 students who will benefit
from the new policy, which is tremendous
considering the small size of the student body.
The choice will improve the lives of many students in the near future and for many years to
come, and at an expense of only about one
percent of the College's endowment. The cost
of SL7 million will be covered by the endowment and future fundraising efforts.
When the Board of Directors reached an
impassioned consensus in favor of going no
loans, did they imperil the financial status of
the College by acting so rashly? The tight
financial situation that Al Bloom previously
portrayed hardly seems to be the case, unless
the Board did not have the best interests of

Swarthmore in mind or they felt so strongly
about going no loans that they flouted conventionalfiscal conservatism.
Other schools sustained many conversations about improving their own financial aid
programs, and they acted before us. We are

left wondering why the College waited to act
in the first place, and then what the specific
impetus was that caused the Board to act so

quickly in December. The Board has only
hinted at some of its motivations, but the
most important one seems to be the need to remain competitive.
We were pleasantly surprised by the decision, but we question whether it was made
with progressive motivations in mind, those
ideas that the College hopes to instill in us.
We wish that a decision to aid such a large

number of students had been made without
influence from other institutions of higher
learning, though we doubt the decision would
have been made in such a timely manner and
with such impassioned consensus. Where was
the passion before Princeton's announcement, Harvard's announcement, Williams's
announcement or Amherst's announcement?
The College appears to be on track to
achieve even more progressive policies
through some of its new committees, such as
the Sustainability Committee. If we want
Swarthmore to truly lead its peers, then the
committees must act now to start fundraising
for the next great initiative. If money is tight,
then we must prioritize and optimize our

That first day, I found myself doing
some strange things. I realized that typically, I'll turn on the TV with the intention of fillingup 20 minutes of time, but
two hours later, find myself still completely engrossed in "Meerkat Manor."
However, when I took a break from
work that day, I folded my clothes and
cleaned my room. What? I even practiced piano, which I have perhaps done
semiannually since my last high school
piano recital. An even more interesting
side effect: I stopped over-eating. I often
eat just because food tastes good and am
far from actually hungry. But much of
that snacking was done in front of the
TV, when I could eat and watch at the
same time. Once I stopped watching TV,
the incentive to eat dropped remarkably. Now, the things I could do with my

free hands were being hampered by
dealing with food, so I found myself sitting there eating cookies impatiently.
Very quickly, I began choosing to do

Unsurprisingly, when a Stanford
University School of Medicine study of

Californian 9-year olds reduced the
amount of time they spent on TV, video
and videogame playing there was a significant decrease in body mass index
and waist circumference.
While Swarthmore might be atypical, undergraduates watch an average of
24.3 hours of TV a week, even when
they're at school according to the NY
Times. I'm sure that number balloons
for most people when they go home. The
average American watches 321 hours of

hours a week of anything is enough to

our offense very well [and

easy baskets. The opposing

end, the Garnet's experience and talent prevailed,
according to McCormick.
It was also sheer will
that drove the players to

luckily, we did it. We finally got a good win after a
long losing streak," Matt

Both Kurman and fellow

Raul
Ordonez 'O9 contributed 11
points for the Garnet. Team
captain Christopher "Truck
Driver" Nana-Sinkam 'OB
had a career high with five
assists, a feat he partially
attributed to the strong performance of the team that
day. "I feel like a lot of credit has to go the team for
shooting very well. It is
easy to get the assists when
everyone is clicking and
doing the right thing,"
Nana-Sinkam said.
Matt Allen 'lO, who
scored a total of 13 points
with five assists during the
game on Monday, described
a strong sense of camaraderie among the players.
"I just love all the guys on
the team. They are actually
one of the big reasons for

why I am here at Swat. We
really do care about each

other," Allen said.
Most of the recent games
ended in close losses,
although the outcomes
might have been quite different had the Garnet benefited from a few more lucky
bounces. Wolf was convinced that the team's hard
work can still pay off this
season. "I believe we still
have the potential to obtain

a reputable record this season if things go our way,"
he said.

There are 10 teams in
the Centennial Conference,
and the top five teams will
compete against each other

at the end of the season for

champions. Nana-Sinkam
said it might still be possible to qualify for the play-

offs. "At this point it may be
hard to make it to playoffs.
But if we win a major proportion of the last ten
games, there is still a good
chance that we can," he
said.
The season ends on Feb.
23, after a final face-off
against Haverford College.
The team will probably
need at least nine wins to
quality for playoffs. "We

are still optimistic," Wolf
said about the Garnet's
prospects for postseason

competition.

The women's basketball team competed against
Washington University on Tuesday, Jan. 22. After 40 minutes
of intensive play, the team lost to its opponent with a score
of 81-71 "There were definitely a lot of good things going on,"
Head Coach Renee DeVarney said. "Some of the things that
we struggled with were turnovers and rebound. I must say,
[the other team] had a hot shooting game tonight, which is
not normal. We have a new and enthusiastic freshman class,
and we are trying to learn to play better."
"{The team] is getting better each day. We will steal some
of those wins soon," said DeVarney, who is returning for her
third year of coaching at Swarthmore. At Tuesday's game,
Kathryn Stockbower 'll led the team with an extraordinary
single-game score of 34 points plus 17 rebounds. Captain
Karen Berk 'OB was also a key scorer of the game, earning 16
points in total.
Despite the team's mixed record, Berk said she is optimistic about the remainder of the season. "I think that for
the most part, we played well [on Tuesday]. We will need to
focus on eliminating turnovers and also to limit the other
team's offense and rebound. Although we have struggled
this semester, we will not let the outcome of the game affect
our positive attitude in any way," Berk said.
Laura Popovics 'OB said that the players will address the
mistakes made at Tuesday's game in preparation for weaker
opponents they expect to face later this season. "We have
some games coming up that we know we will win for sure.
We will be building off of this game in order to pick up some
more wins," she said.
Stockbower said that morale remains high, despite
recent losses. "I'm glad to be playing with such a good group

dance before the, season
started. Regardless of
the "Spygate" scandal, of which plenty of you have
informed me, believe me, the Patriots have banded
together through unrelenting focus to get where they
are today. However, I urge everyone not to be quick to
judge the underdog New York Giants since they have
surged from a Wild-Card playoff team to a Super Bowl
finalist.
Perhaps the biggest testament to Bill Belichick as a
coach is his uncanny ability to set aside distractions
and to keep the mentality of the players as a single
focus. Nowhere on the Patriots' roster are there players who create drama by guaranteeing wins, or complaining about the play of teammates or coaches.
Though there isn't much to complain about as a team
that boasts the most potent offense in NFL history as
well as record setting individuals, the Patriots have not
once sunk to the level of criticizing one another or
their opponents. It's easy to pick on the top dog l .
Just this weekend one of my buddies came up to me
and said, "Classy team you have where your receivers
beat women." The comment was made in reference to
the current scandal concerning Randy Moss. Though
the intentions of the individual confronting Moss seem

to clearly indicate a gold-digging shakedown on her
part, I still believe that Bill Belichick will be able to
focus the team on other issues, the most important
game of the season perhaps. They are so close to perfection, four short quarters away from establishing
their names in the history books.
Winning every game of an NFL season is unquestioningly a Herculean task, requiring a whole lot of talent and a whole lot of luck, too. In my opinion, the
sheer amount of weapons, both offensive and defensive, on the Patriots roster is certainly going to give the
Giants a fit on Feb. 3.
I refuse to write off the chances of the Giants winning, however, for more than a few reasons. First, I
personally like the Giants with their host of badass
players and Boston College alums (both coaches and

players). They are certainly a capable team with a solid
running game, which seems to be the experts' way to
beat the Patriots. Besides, on any given day any team
can win; I think that nothing illustrates that more than
little Division I-AA Appalachian State beating perennial powerhouse Michigan at the Big House this fall.
Things can happen to anyone, every fighter has a
puncher's chance of winning. Lots of critics seem to
give Eli Manning a raw deal. In my eyes he is an
extremely talented quarterback just waiting to break
into the limelight. What bigger game to do that than
the Super Bowl? If Eli can stretch the field with his
receivers, and ifBrandon Jacobs and the running game
can stay tough between the tackles, then I see this
game being a lot closer than predicted.
That being said, I still think this game will go to the
Patriots in a barnburner. I think that the sheer experience of the veterans on the Pats will keep the team
composed on such a big stage, especially considering
their field general Tom Brady is a two-time Super Bowl
MVP. I'm looking forward to a big game, and even
though my team isn't an underdog, with all the Patriot
resentment and flak I receive they will certainly feel
like one. Besides, everyone should watch the game

For some Swarthmore students, winter break is as a
time to catch up on well-deserved rest. For members of the
men's and women's swim teams, however, it is a time to
prepare for their remaining meets, culminating in the
highly competitive Centennial Conference Champion-

ships.

This year, the swim teams headed off to Puerto Rico for
ten days of intense training and emotional bonding. While
in Puerto Rico, the swimmers endured a rigorous schedule
ofboth in-pool and dry-land training sessions. "Despite the
sunny locale, the trip is a lot of work," said Reid Wilkening
'lO.

The swimmers woke up around 5 a.m. every morning
and were in the pool by 6 a.m. After a break, training
would resume later in the day for an afternoon session.

Despite the aggressive and tiring workout routines, the
training trip is incredibly beneficial to the teams' physical
and emotional strength. With Centennial Conference matches fast approaching, the teams must be in the best shape possible. "I know that the training we put in while in Puerto
Rico will directly correlate to fast swims at the conference
meet," said Wilkening.
Furthermore after ten days of living and working hard
together, according to Wrobel, "the swimmers really came
together as a team." Sterling Satterfield 11 acknowledged
that "having two practices a day wasn't very fun." But by
the end of the training trip, "The team bonded in a way that
can't be described," Satterfield said.
