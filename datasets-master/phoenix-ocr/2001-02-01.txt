Princeton alters financial aid policies
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
Princeton University students who receive financial aid next fall will not have
to borrow money as a part of their aid packages and will benefit from a range of other
improvements in the university's financial
aid program.
The university has emphasized that it
is building on an already progressive aid
policy that has "prompted other private
universities to follow suit and make a college education more affordable," according
to spokesperson Marilyn Marks.
Laura Talbot, Swarthmore's director of
financial aid, said the underlying philosophy on financial aid is the same at both
Swarthmore, with 1,400 students, and
Princeton, with 4,600 undergraduates. The
college "already does much of what
Princeton announced as new," she said.
"We want to let students consider

Swarthmore without price being a concern."
In the past, Princeton has aimed its financial aid efforts at assisting low-income
students in meeting the costs of attending
college, but middle-class students have often been saddled with financial aid packages composed mostly ofloans. After the
changes are implemented, the portions of
.financial aid offers that would have been

loans in the past will become grants. Packages
will continue to include money earned at summer and school-year jobs.
Still, many Princetonians whose financial
aid packages do not fully meet theirneeds will
continue to take out loans in order to meet

whatever sum the university decides their
families can pay. The same applies to
Swarthmore students who request aid but do
not receive it.
Currently, about seventy percent of
Swarthmore applicants request financial aid,
and fifty percent of matriculating students
receive it. At Princeton, forty percent of students receive aid.
The university announced its decision
while most students are away from campus
for their post-finals "inter-session." Jed
Peterson, a freshman who remained on campus, praised Princeton's efforts. "Education
in this country is much too expensive," he
said. "Any effort to limit the cost is a good
thing." He added that he hoped other institutions would be able to follow suit but recognized that most of them do not have nearly as
many resources as Princeton.
The changes to financial aid come as a part
an initiative for a broad range of improvements at Princeton. It will fund this by taking money from its endowment, which, at $8
billion is eight times the size of Swarthmore's.
Part of Peterson's financialaid package last

year contained loans, so the switch in policy
will affect him directly. Due to an already progressive policy, however, the loan portion was
"really a very small amount."
Peterson also spoke positively about his
school's aid program prior to the elimination

of loans. "The Princeton financial aid package was better than any other schools that I
applied to," he said, citing the offer as "certainly influential" in his college choice.
Peterson added that when he won a scholarship from his high school, the first thing
Princeton eliminated from his package was
the work-study component and part of the
loan, not the grants.
Talbot said she does not anticipate that
Swarthmore will lose potential students to
Princeton or other schools that may implement similar aid policies. She said surveys of
admitted students show that the final choice
ofwhich college to attend is rarely determined
by which school has the lower loan component of a financial aid package.
She also noted that when Princeton announced changes to its aid policies three years
ago, lowering its loan component, and other
schools such as Yale and Stanford quickly followed suit, it had little affect on students' decisions to enroll at Swarthmore.

Co-president resigns from Student Council
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
Two minutes into their first meeting of the year, the Student Council received some unexpected news: Brandon
Silverman 'O2, the council's co-president, resigned from his
position in order to take over as a Resident Assistant in Willets.
Addressing the council, Silverman explained his decision.
"I've thought long and hard about it," he said. "Being an RA
is something I've wanted to do since I got here, and I know I

cannot do both."
The announcement was met with surprise by many members of the council. Jordan Brackett 'Ol, last semester's cochair, told Silverman he would be missed. "We're sorry to see
you go," he said. "You have worked hard and proved yourself
as one of the best Student Council members, but we respect
your decision and wish you luck."

Among Student Council members, Silverman was one of

the most experienced. This would have been his fourth semester, including a previous semester as co-chair. He was
voted in as co-president at the end of last semester, solidly
defeating his two competitors, Michael DeFillipo 'O4 and David

Thomas 'O2.

Silverman, however, said he had no intention of completely
walking away. "I was appointed to two committees at
[Monday's] meeting, and I plan to stay as involved until I cease
being helpful to the Council. There are several issues in particular that I, personally, would still like to see through to the
finish," he said.
Silverman applied to be an RA last spring, and was selected
as one of two male alternates for the position. In the fall, the
other alternate, Matt Davis 'Ol, was given a position in Parrish.
But a position opened up over winter break, when the RA on
Willets Third North, Andy Karr 'O2, resigned.
"I was contacted about a week before I was supposed to

SC co-president Brandon Silverman resigned from his
Position on Monday. He will become an RA in Willets.

come to schoolabout Andy's resignation," said Silverman. "As
the only remaining alternate, I chose to accept."
He went on to say thathe had continued on Student Council only because he didn't expect an RA position to open up.
"If I had known either that there would be a resignation or
even the possibility of one before the end of the spring," he
said, "I would not have run in the last election."
Silverman's resignation leaves Colin Moore 'O2, who was
appointed according to the conditions of the old constitution,
as the current and only leader of the Council. A special elec-

tion will be held to elect a new co-president to finish out
Silverman's one-year term. Students may decide to run for
the co-president until midnight next Monday.
According to stipulations in the new constitution, ratified in December's campus-wide referendum, the special
election cannot be held until two weeks after the formal
resignation of the old member, which occurred at this
week's meeting. Balloting for the new election will begin
on Feb. 12 and end on Feb. 14.
Silverman expressed confidence in the abilities-of the
new council. "Colin Moore is going to be an outstanding
leader on the council much better than I ever was
and that made the situation a lot less difficult," he said.
"Furthermore, we finally established a gender equality on
council, largely in part due to [council member] Andy
Wong's efforts last semester, that will provide a much more
legitimate perspective to every decision SC makes. It is
going to be a very good semester for everyone involved,
and I am stoked to see what they can accomplish."
The council's recommendation on the alcohol policy is
due to Dean's Advisory Council (DAC) member Tedd
Goundie within the next two weeks. According to Brackett,
the DAC will accept or reject the council's recommendations, which could lead to changes in the way alcohol is

handled at Swarthmore.
The issue of alcohol was raised last year as part of the
DAC's periodic review. Student Council has been discussing the report since that time.
Bracket commented on the Student Council's report,

saying, "It won't be drastically different. It will incorporate what we feel are the best ways to maintain a safedrinking atmosphere on campus with a system that is legally
and morally responsible."

Moore also introduced three new initiatives which the
Council will work to accomplish in the near future. The
first deals with safety issues, and will attempt to provide
the campus with better lighting and security as well as
considering the more long-term goal of swipe-card entrance
to dorms. The second initiative, labeled BOM #2, is a fol-

low-up to the recent athletic cuts by the Board of Managers. The council intends to work with the administration
in an attempt to strengthen student's voices in the decision-making process. Finally, the Student Council hopes
to work on an initiative that will keep Tarble open later.

SCHOLARSHIPS

Constitution revision to improve council
Senior wins
Marshall award
BY ELIZABETH HANSEN

BY JON EHRENFELD
The British government has awarded Jordan Wales 'Ol
the Marshall Scholarship, a prestigious honor given each
year to 40 American students for their academic excellence
and leadership potential.
The scholarship will give Wales tuition for two years at
a UnitedKingdom graduate program ofhis choosing. Pend
ing his acceptance, he will attend
the University of Edinburgh in
Scotland.
Most recipients of the Marshall
Scholarship choose to study at one
of the United Kingdom's two best
known universities, Oxford or
Cambridge, Wales said. But be
cause he found both of their artifi
cial intelligence and cognitive science departments lacking, he
looked to the University of Sussex
and the University of Edinburgh
wa i es
and settled on the latter. Wales saic
the university had strong departments in his fields and cited
the city as a fascinating cultural center.
At Edinburgh, he plans to spend his first year pursuing
a Master of Sciences in cognitive science and his second
year pursuing a Master of Sciences in artificial intelligence.
Wales began his application for the scholarship over the
summer while he was interning for Microsoft. The application asked him to document most of his academic history, including the familiar "tell-us-ali-about-yourself essay" and to provide recommendations. "It was a lot like
writing college applications," he said.
After submitting his application, Wales went to Washington, D.C. for an interview at the British Embassy. Although he was initially daunted at the prospect of having
to talk about all his academic achievements in an interview, he enjoyed the wide range of questions the interview
ers asked, and ultimately found the process "exciting."
Wales is currently an honors engineering major with
a minor in physiological psychology. He chose his minor
before the school offered a concentration in cognitive science.
As disparate as these two fields may seem, Wales finds
they have much in common with each other and merge in
the study ofartificial intelligence (AI), his area ofinterest
at Swarthmore. Without a complete understanding of how
and why humans and the brain function, he said, it is difficult to begin creating AI.
That is where physiological psychology comes in. "It
has a behavioral approach to psychology," Wales said. "It
fits in really well with my interest in AI." Wales also citec
the school's engineering program as conducive to his interests. Rather than channeling students into a specific
branch of engineering, he said, it was a fluid program that
allowed him to focus on specifics, such as AI.
Wales has focused on these interests outside of school,
as well. Last year he was part of the team from Swarthmore
which won first prize in the American Association of Artificial Intelligence robot competition. The previous year, he
worked with psychology professor Allen Schneider doing
experiments with memory in rats.
Wales is interested in nonsymbolic artificial intelligence, a type of AI in which robots use "intelligence" to
analyze things they see rather thanperforming a database
search for an object. He intends to closely link this type of
AI with the study of neural networks and brain physiology.

Great Britain established the Marshall Scholarship in
1954 in recognition of the United States' efforts to rebuild
England after World War 11. Named after Gen. George
Marshall, whose eponymous plan dedicatedmillions ofdollars to rebuilding Europe, the scholarship seeks out students who show not only academic excellence but also potential for leadership and decision-making qualities.
Reflecting on Swarthmore'srole in shaping his academic
development, Wales acknowledged the school's atmosphere
and mission in steering his interests and efforts. "The liberal arts approach has allowed me to delve into other diverse fields [besides computer science]," Wales said. "Something that I really enjoy is the environment of debate anc
questioning." He also expressed gratitude toward the diverse
array ofinterests and pursuits among hisfellow students.

THE PHOENIX

To illustrate one of the reasons why it was necessary for
the Student Council to retool its constitution last semester,
former Student Council co-chair Matt Schwartz 'Ol tells the
story of a co-chair about ten years ago who tried to abuse
his power as a member of the council.
The co-chair had received a grade he wasn't very happy
with, and to remedy this unfortunate situation,he proceeded
to push the council for the creation of a grade review committee a committee to which students could appeal their
bad grades and attempt to have them overturned.
Council members are confident that the new constitution,
ratified by the council and the student body last November,
will help prevent this sort of pursuit of personal interest, and
more generally ensure that the council's actions more fully
reflect the needs and wishes of the entire student body.
Perhaps the most noticeable, and according to Schwartz,
"the most important change to the constitution is the creation of the co-president position. As the council is seeking
to present a stronger voice to the administration this semester, Schwartz said a co-president elected by the student
body "will establish a mandate thattells the administration
'this person was chosen by the student body.' It will help
the council with its legitimacy and increase its accountability." He believes the public election of the presidents will
ensure their integrity. "Hopefully we will not get a loose
cannon co-chair because the president will have to be elected
by everybody," said Schwartz.
In the past, after students were elected to the council,
the new members picked two co-chairs in a blind vote. By
introducing direct election of the co-presidents, SC hopes to
have clearer leadership.
"The [co-president] position was given more authority
and power," said co-president ColinMoore 'O2. "The co-presidents will not be just in charge of organization or meeting
facilitation. They will set the tone of student councilfor the
semester."
Moore's position is a perfect example of the transition
taking place in the council. He was elected as Financial
Policy Representative (a new position derivedfrom the College Budget Committee Representative) last fall. Though he
goes by the title of co-president, he was picked under the
old constitution as co-chair for this semester. At the end of
the semester, both of his positions will be up for re-election—a new co-president will be elected, as well as a new
Financial Policy Representative. The co-chair position was
not the only one that was overhauled. Many other council
positions have been renamed and reworked as well.
"[The new constitution] made the positions' duties
clearer, encompassing more tasks," said Moore. Now, "the
names [of the new positions] match better with the actual
duties. Before, the titles were based on which committee
you sat on. Now the names are simplified, and the delegation [of tasks] is easier."
For example, the position of Student Groups Advisor
sprang from the previous Charter Chair position. The old
Outreach Advisor is now a Campus Relations Representative. By the fall semester of 2001, the new constitution will
be fully implemented.
"The transition seems to be goingreally well," said council memberPeter Holm 'OL "We elected seven new members

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Student Council Secretary Poulami Roychowdhury takes
notes at Monday night's meeting, the first this semester,
to fill the new positions at the end of last semester, and at
the end of this semester we'll be completing the turnover
so that all the new positions will be filled.
"I think people really responded to the retooling of SC
positions in the new constitution," said Holm. "We had
more than 20 people running for spots, and I think a lot of
that is because the new SC positions correspond more
closely to the concerns and priorities of students."
While SC hopes for increased enthusiasm from the student body, the other long-term effects of the new constitution may be hard to perceive. "I think we will see the differences in the future
it's hard to tell now, hard to detect.
Some of the changes will be counterfactual," said council
member JordanBrackett 'Ol "For example, without one line
in the constitution, what would happen? There are lots of
safeguards [in the new constitution]: what to do if there is a
bad council or a member who isn't fulfilling their duties."

Other members of the council think that the relation-'

ship between the administration and the student body will
change because of the constitution. "In the past, student
council has been treated by the administration as a focus
group for gathering feedback," said Schwartz. Because of
the new constitution, he said, "eventually, the student body
will be seen [by the administration] as a constituent of the
college thathas to consent before a decision is made. This
did not happen with the athletics decision. Students need
to be seen as real members ofthis community, not just customers, products or clients."

Students campaign for staff living wage
BY GABRIEL HETLAND

After conducting 80 to 100 interviews with staff members during September and October, members of
Swarthmore Living Wage Campaign (SLWC) say that college staffbelieve that the college often puts them last when
big decisions need to made.
Talking with staffmembers in one-on-one meetings, SLWC
members found much of the staff is concerned about sala-

ries, representation and respect. According to the group, staff
said they feel that their wages are too low to live on, reflectin
a lower priority and lack of respect given them compared
with students and faculty. Student financial aid and faculty
salaries are at model levels, noted SLWC, while staff wages
are still calculated based on a pure market system, and do
not always meet targeted increases.
SLWC members Nate Wessler 'O4 and Mariah Montgomery 'O4 said staff feel as though students, faculty and especially the administration often fail to treat them with dignity when discussing the college's attitudes and policies,
despite the role they have in keeping the campus running.

Wessler said Swarthmore has what he characterized as
a "moral imperative" to give their staffthe respect he feels
they deserve and which the college, he said, has the capability of providing. Following the interviews, SLWC began
discussions with members of the Human Resources department and the College Budget Committee. Students and staff
also began holding regular meetings to work on the campaign, which up to 30 staffmembers sometimes attended.
Wessler, Montgomery and other members of SLWC
stressed that the campaign has been a joint effort between
staff and students from the start. The students involved see
it as theirrole to bring staff grievances to light, then finding
out ways in which they can be helpful in spurring change.
As a part of this effort, an educational teach-in will be
held Feb. 6, at 8 p.m. in the Hicks Mural Room. The event
is primarily aimed at students, though group members said
all are welcome to attend. SLWC has also composed a petition to President Al Bloom that outlines the group's reasons for seeking a living wage. In the coming weeks, students and staff from SLWC will also be meeting with Bloom
and the senior staff, as well as with Student Council.

Princeton replaces loans with grants
From PRINCETON, pg. 3
"We do not try to offer better financial aid in order to woo a student away
from another school. We hope students
choose Swarthmore because the atmosphere fits right," Talbot said.
The price for a Princeton education
next year will be $33,613, and the changes
in financial aid will cost about $5 million.

The university's endowment has recently grown to about $8 billion, due to
the success of its Annual Giving program and fundraising efforts.
Swarthmore's cost for tuition, room
and board is slightly less, totaling
$33,004.

In another comparison, the average
family income for aid recipients in the
class of 2004 was $79,000 at Princetonbut
$71,480 at Swarthmore. This means that
Swarthmore accepts more low-income
students but may also deem that more
middle-income students do not need the
aid they apply for.
Princeton's aim in eliminating loans
from financial aid packages is to free its
students from financial hardship after
graduation and to permit them to make
career and educational choices without
having to take large debts into consider-

ation.

"We want to ensure that no student
admitted to Princetonfeels that he or she
cannot attend because it would present
a financial hardship," said Princeton
University President Harold T Shapiro.
"We have made all of today's improvements with that goal in mind."
Nationally, college students who
graduate this year will have an average
of $15,000 to $20,000 in debt.
Princeton seniors have borrowed an
average of$2,615, which reflects both the
institution's previous efforts to cater to
the financial needs of its students and

how much of the student body does not
need loans at all.
In comparison, Swarthmore's graduating seniors receiving financial aid
were asked to borrow $l5, 970, but this
sum does not take into account students
who were not on aid.
In the fall of 1998, Princeton students
whose families earned under $46,500 per
year were not required to take out any
loans, and the university reduced the
amount of loan money in packages for
families who made $46,500 to $66,500
each year.
At Swarthmore, 38 percent of the
class of 2004 did not have any loans in
their package.
Princeton asserts that it is "the first
of its peer institutions and, except for
the service academies, possibly the first
to announce
American university
that aid recipients will not be required
to borrow to pay for college."
Nationally, loans make up an average of 60 percent of aid packages.
The changes will affect all undergraduates starting this fall and will benefit many students.
One-quarter of Princeton students
who receive aid are required to borrow.
Over 62 percent of the freshman class is
receiving loans this year, including
those who choose to borrow in order to
offset what Princeton decides they are
able to pay.
A spectrum of other changes in financial aid will alter the offers to students starting next year. Students will
have to put 5 percent of their savings
towards tuition, as opposed to the previous 35 percent; theirparents will continue to pay 5 percent of their savings.
The university will phase in this
change beginning with next year's
freshman class.
In addition, students whose families
earn under $46,500 per year will have to
pay $BOO less from their summer job

money, and those whose families are in
the $46,500 to $66,500 per year bracket
will pay $5OO less from summer jobs. The

university madethis change with the understanding that some students give a
portion of their own money to help their

families.
Families who earn under $66,500 each
year will now have the university's
health plan, worth $370, included in their
aid package.

To be fair to those who rent rather
than own homes, renters will receive an
allowance against their savings that
equals the value of the average family
home, which was about $140,000 in the
2001-02 academic year. Because home equity is not considered a part of assets, it
was eliminated from formula calculations several years ago.
Finally, the admissions policy for international students will be need-blind,
as it has been for American and Canadian students in the past. This change
means that all students will be admitted
or rejected without regard to their financial need. For those who are accepted,
the financial aid office will apply a formula to determine how much they are
able to pay.
Swarthmore is not need-blindfor international students, as it is for other
students. According to Talbot, the college admits a higher proportion of foreign students than most colleges and attempts to offer them scholarships when
needed.
"The lowest loan is the best plan,"
Talbot said in a broad assessment of financial aid policy. "Princeton's plan is
a wonderful plan, and we will be talking
about it in our discussions of financial
aid at Swarthmore for the future."

the host of college service organizations and
promote a sense of civic responsibility, the college
announced earlier this year. The new Lang Center
will not be a physical building, but an
"administrative center," according to Patricia
James, the center's leader.
"It represents a bringing together of all the
parts of community service and civic learning at
the college under one umbrella," said James.
One year ago, the Board of Managers created a
committee to study the role of social responsibility
and how the concept is addressed throughout the
college. Lang, who sits on the Board of Managers,
"inspired the formation" of this committee,
according to James. James said that community
service was one of Lang's "key experiences at
Swarthmore."
"In my freshman year, I think I was perhaps the
only volunteer on campus," said Lang. "I consider

Police arrest second
mugging suspect

Juilliard grad Wachs named
spring orchestra conductor

BY GERRIT HALL

BY JONATHAN EHRENFELD

Since the armed mugging on campus last semester, a second suspect has been brought into custody.
Clare Harney 'O3 and Chris Keary 'O3, the two victims of the mugging that occurred near the train station, testified at a hearing for the two suspects Tuesday morning. Police do not have enough information
to arrest the third and final suspect, according to
Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig.
"The trial that happened [Tuesday] was a preliminary hearing, which means they haven't decided
much," Keary said. The hearing was to decide which
charges wouldbe brought up against the two suspects.
At the time of the interview, Keary, Harney and Craig
did not knowwhich charges would be brought up
against the suspects.
A formal arraignment will take place in the future to set the trial date, according to Harney, which
will not require their presence. "From the arraignment date, I believe it's two to six months," he said.
If the case reaches a trial, "it's possible we might
be called back again," said Keary. The case, however,
may not reach that point.
"They're pretty sure it's going to plea bargain,"
said Harney.
Meanwhile, Swarthmore police have not made an
arrest of the thirdindividual. "We have a suspect who
we think is the same person who committed a robbery in Rutledge, but we haven't been able to make a
positive identification," said Craig.
"It's very much an open case," said Keary.

Daniel Wachs has been named the new conductor of the
Swarthmore College Orchestra this spring. Wachs willalso teach an
ear training section this spring in addition to his conducting duties.
Wachs is a graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts.
He lived in Philadelphia from 1994 to 1998, where he obtained his
bachelor's degree in piano from the Curtis Institute of Music. He
received his master's degree, also in piano, from the Juilliard School
ofMusic in New York.
in conductHe is currently working on his second master's
ing
at Juilliard. His conducting debut came at the well-known
Alice Tully Hall in New York's Lincoln Center.
The orchestra's first concert will take place on April 28. The
featured artists include Olivia Gruber 'O3, who won the 2000-2001
Concerto Competition. They will also be performing Nikolai
Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade," because, Wachs said, "I
wanted to challenge and encourage the orchestra." This piece is
made difficult by numerous wind solos in addition to the
concertmaster's violin solos.
Wachs has indicated his excitement and enthusiasm at being
part of the orchestra as well as being at Swarthmore. "I'm honored
to be a part of the Swarthmore community," he said.
In order to prepare the orchestra for the task of performing
"Scheherazade," Wachs plans to train intensively—up to threehours
per practice—with the orchestra, focusing on elements such as sound
and musical phrasing. In addition, he is currently looking for percussionists, harpists and wind players to fill gaps in the orchestra.
Expressing pleasure and gratitude at being able to work with
John Alston and the orchestra, Wachs said, "I have complete confidence in them, and I'm hoping to be able to return next year to
continue working with them."

life."
The committee decided to form the Lang
Center, which was implemented to "link [students']
academic experience with the concerns of good
citizenship," according to the mission statement. It
will give service groups "more resources" and
"bring together" service opportunities on campus.
"I'd like to see Swarthmore set the example of
higher education with the scope and quality of
their social involvements," said Lang.
The center also has significant plans for
supporting civic responsibility at Swarthmore. One
goal James mentioned was providing funding for
any service internship. The Lang Center will also
support faculty who wish to incorporate community
service into courses.
"It's a tremendous amount of work, it's totally
worth it, and it's a great way to learn," said James.
Other goals mentioned by James include training
for social affairs programs, an expanded Summer
of Service program, organization of mentors, an
intercollegiate organization, and "maybe a van
someday."
Lang is providing the endowment for the center,
which marks the latest in a long history of
endowments to Swarthmore. In addition to
supporting construction of the Lang Music Building
and the Lang Performing Arts Center and
endowing the Lang Scholarship, he has
contributed to professorships and faculty research.
Students active in service organizations on
campus expressed support for the new Lang

Center and its goals.
"The more that service can be incorporated into
the curriculum, the better," said Jesse Hartigan
'O4.
"It's about time," said Rajaa Shakir 'O4.
"Community service is so big on this campus, but
it's very disjointed, and it's hard for people who
are interested but not zealous to find resources."

Information Technology Student Associates program to do something about it.
The program is a new initiative
among Swarthmore, Haverford and
Bryn Mawr designed to capitalize on student computer experience to support the
faculty members. It is funded by a
Mellon grant, whose aim is to support
liberal arts faculty in integrating electronic materials into their classes. The
program will train and hire students to
assist faculty in course software and
Web-based support. The training will
involve a week-long camp over the sum-

skills such as mastery of Web design software.
As of Tuesday morning, 74 students
from the three colleges had applied for
the program, 35 of them from
Swarthmore. Although the majority of
the students are math, engineering or
computer science majors, the pool of applicants also includes majors in comparative literature and peace studies.
Maurer stressed that the program
will try not to take students away from
existing technicalpositions. "We are not
trying to take over," he said. "The program will work though the [Computing

shift."

Faculty are already fairly dependent
upon student experts to help them
through computer glitches. "I have profited a great deal from students at the
Computing Center, who have prepared
software for me," said Kim Arrow, a professor in the dance department.
Although Arrow admits that he is
"someone who hates staring into the

about the possibilities of technology. He

The question is: do technological advances enhance the learning experience? For example, the course management software Blackboard, introduced
by the same Mellon grant, will offer faculty a framework for a Web page, online
threaded discussions, online grades, and
the possibility of completing feedback
surveys over the net.
Although Maurer himself is skepticalabout pure online learning, he thinks
that "as a supplement [to the classroom
experience], these things could work
well."
Sosin would agree. He was
"bummed" that one ofhis professors did
not have a Web page. "It's one less way
they can communicate," he said.
Maurer's Haverford counterpart,
Doug Davis, says that students can only
benefit when the faculty makes informed decisions. He also points out the
benefits of a collaborative relationship
between student and professor.
"It's a new teaching dynamic the
student will be in constant communication with the professor and has better
skills," he said.

President George Bush recently appointed
Swarthmore alumnus Robert Zoellick 75 as the
United States Trade Representative.
Zoellick, who graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
Swarthmore, went on to receive a J.D. from
Harvard Law School, as well as a public policy
degree from Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. Zoellick had previously served
under Bush's father, George Herbert Walker
Bush.
Zoellick got his start in Washington during the
Reagan administration, when he served under
one of his Harvard law professors, Richard
Darman, in the Treasury Department.
In 1988, Zoellick moved to the State
Department, where he served as the UnderSecretary of State for Economic and Agricultural
Affairs, and later as the Deputy Chief of Stafffor
President George H.W. Bush.
Zoellick's impressive resume is not limited to
political appointments. Zoellick has also served
as a professor of national security at the United
States Naval Academy and as executive vice
president of Fannie Mae.
He has also held positions on a variety of wellknown diplomatic and economic organizations,
including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
the World Trade Organization, and the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation.
Additionally, Zoellick has been recognized with
the Distinguished Service Award, the Department
of the Treasury's highest honor, as well as the
German Government's Knight Commanders
Cross for his role in the multinational
conferences regarding the reunification of
Germany.

nition to those who had made speeches on
their behalf.
Candidates for executive positions must
declare their candidacy and then obtain a
nomination by another College Republican,
but the process is "mostly a pro forma thing,"
Thomas said. "Anyone can nominate anyone."
Thomas was nominated for second vice-chair
last year but lost.
Whoever secures most of the endorsements
of the College Republican chapters in southeastern Pennsylvania
which the ShadierThomas ticket already has is usually guaranteed victory, Thomas said. Due to the public nature of these endorsements, the winners
of contests are usually known before the actual conference, in similar fashion to polls predicting the results of national elections.
The vice-chair position would entail
fundraising, starting College Republicans
chapters, and running campaigns similar to
those of any local political group. It would
also require publicizing the voice of the College Republicans on statewide political af-

fairs.
Thomas doubts that his position as vicechair will have any noticeable effect on the
Swarthmore College community or improve
recruitment of more Republican students. Realistically, he said, the campus Republicans

But he does think his new position
could increase the clout of Swarthmore

arrange more high-profile campus
events.
"I think it will have some impact because
it will lead to having better speakers," Thomas said, adding that he hopes to bring Governor Tom Ridge to campus next year.

OPINIONS
EDITORIAL

Aid reaction needed
On the bookcase behind President Al Bloom's desk,
there is a small sign that reads, "El cash habla." But
when Princeton University announced Monday it would
start exchanging scholarships for undergraduate loans,
the cash wasn't talking
it was screaming.
The exchange, which Princeton estimates will cost
the university at least $5 million a year, doesn't just
make Princeton a more attractive choice for middleclass students with significant loans. It fundamentally
alters how the game of college financial aid is played
it takes the burden off students and parents and places it
squarely on the institutions' shoulders. If Princeton
determines a student can't afford the price of admission,
no longer will the implicit assumption be, "With our
degree, you'll be able to afford it four years from now."
For some years now, the gold standard in college
admissions has been need-blind admissions. It was and
still is a significant financial commitment to admit
students without regard to theirfinancial situations
even in the Ivy League, Brown University has yet to find
the resources to support need-blind admissions. Yet by
replacing scholarships with loans, Princeton has already
rewritten the contract between a school and its students,
enlarging and expanding it beyond the admissions office.
Even under need-blind admissions, students graduate
with thousands of dollars in debt. Although their
financial needs are "met," low-interestloans are usually
counted toward meeting those needs. While the loans
often have more lax payment rules, they are still loans, a
significantburden to carry when entering the real world.
Without these loans, more students will be able to
attend graduate and professional schools, untroubled by
the prospect of not carrying student debt until their late
twenties. And with the scholarships, the unspoken
assertion is that Princeton will have a substantial edge
in attracting the best middle-class students.
Can and will other schools try to keep up? Undoubtedly Princeton's three richest competitors Harvard,
Yale and Stanford will attempt to call Princeton's
gambit. But it remains to be seen whether changes
among the richest schools will cause a shakedown
throughout higher education as they have in the past.
How Swarthmore and other well-endowed liberal
arts colleges react will help determine to what extent the
waves of Princeton's move reach the shores of the small
college world. Per capita, few schools, if any, can match
Princeton's $8 billion endowment, and the financial
burdens of Princeton's policy are impossible to shoulder
for institutions slightly farther down the ladder. But
Swarthmore does compete for students with the
Princetons of the world, and it is likely that the college
will have to respond to the change to stay competitive.
It's crucial to determinewhether a change in the
spirit ofPrinceton's would benefit Swarthmore more
than other uses of the money. The scholarships-for-loans
initiative is part ofPrinceton's larger financial aid
improvements, which include increased graduate
student support and need-blind internationaladmissions. This is a pointed reminder that college admissions
isn't only about money for the middle class. Perhaps the
money would be best directed toward expanding
financial aid for students whose income falls just above
the normal aid limit or developing programs forstudents
who might not traditionally consider Swarthmore.
There's also the question of where this money might
come from. With a capital campaign already in progress
and the Board of Managers notoriously wary of changes
in endowment spending, it may take some creative
accounting to come up with the money.
Yet Princeton's commitment to making a college
education more affordable is a step in the right direction, especially in the face of rising tuition, which now
puts a year at Swarthmore and comparable schools well
over $30,000. With education costs spiraling upward, it's
refreshing to see Princeton take responsibility for some
of the financial burden it has dumped on its students.
Will Swarthmore react to Princeton's change?
Possibly. Should it react to Princeton's change? Absolutely. For those of us who leave college more worried
about our financial futures than when we entered, any

IDEA:

FUNNIER ALTERNATE

Athletics cuts cannot be left unexamined

Faculty search policy clarified

Dear Editor:
It is indeed tempting to assign the football/wrestling/badminton
decision to the dustbin of history and call for a time ofhealing ("Time
for healing now," Jan. 25, pg. 8). The sad fact, however, is that some
wounds may be too deep, and too threatening to the long-term health
of the college, for any simple therapy. The more I add to my own
experience in the ARC with first-hand accounts of the committee's
meetings and procedures this past fall, and the more I learn about
how the decision was handled by the Board of Managers, the less
willing I am to see the issue disappear into business as usual.
My gravest concern is that the decision-making process that has
served the college well for all of the 40 years of my career here has
been corrupted. For that reason alone, far above my conviction that
the substance of the decision was wrong, I believe that we must
continue to examine closely and critically the version of events that
forms the core of the administration's intense and highly orchestrated public relations offensive. The decision and the process may
not still be debatable as "news," but the debate must go on, vigoreven at the cost of conflict and painful diviously and in public
sions, and in the face of administrative attempts to quash dissenting voices.

Dear Editor:
I am writing to clarify a passage in the article
in The Phoenix of Jan. 25,2001, about diversity in
the faculty ("The gradually changing face of the
faculty," pg. 10-12), specifically with regard to extra financial resources for departments involved
in tenure-track searches.
In recruiting for faculty positions, our experience has been that chances for recruiting faculty of color are enhanced when we are able to
attract a broad pool of candidates. Normally a
department only brings three finalists to campus for a position; however, the department may
request additional funds so they can invite a
larger number. This extra support for the
department's efforts to develop a broad pool of
candidates hasallowed us to bring some tremendously interesting scholars, including scholars
of color, to campus, and to our great benefit,
some of them have turned out to be a wonderful
fit for the college.

An article last week on Jared Solomon's suit against

Swat not Utopia
During the Fantastically Fatuous Football (oh yeah, andbadmintonand wrestling) Fiasco thatoccurred last semester, I heard
many a football player (or footballalum or football player's parent) proclaim that Swarthmorehad deceived him—that a promise had been made and then broken in an effective betrayal on
the part of the Swat administration. When I heard these cries of
foul play, two thoughts popped into my mind: first, that perhaps
the initial football-renovation promise itself was a betrayal of
the Swarthmore in which I chose to enroll; and second, that the
Swarthmore in which I chose to enroll never really existed.
When I arrived at Swarthmore, I thought that I'd reached
Elysium. Indeed, this was the depiction of Swarthmore that I
was given from day one of my interest in the school.
Swarthmore was supposed to be this beautiful place, a bastion of tolerance and respect for all people, with nearly the
entire student body, faculty and administration firmly devoted
to activism, diversity and social consciousness. I'd somehow
developed the notion that Swarthmore was Liberal Heaven.
I learnedthe truth about Swarthmore the hard way. My freshman year, when I still believed in this Utopian view of Swat, some
wise senior friends ofmine attempted to warn me many times.
When they observed my unbridled optimism and enthusiasm,
they said, "Jackie, by the time you're a junior, you'll be sick of
this place, and you'll have realized that it just ain'tall that good."
Had I listened to them more carefully, perhaps I wouldn't be the
jadedcynic that I am today, or perhaps I just would've become a
jadedcynic long ago and spared myself the disappointment.
Over time, I learned to abandon my Swarthmore snobbery,
that "It couldn't happen here" or "People aren't like that here"
mentality. It was beaten out of me, especially last semester
through comments made by various people on campus, my first
personal encounter with homophobia, various abominable letters written to The Phoenix, and most significantly, through
my experiences on the Daily Jolt forum. There the power of
anonymity allowed all kinds of opinions that supposedly don't
exist at Swarthmore to appear in a public setting, ranging from
the more controversial opinions ofthe poor, silenced conservatives of Swarthmore to disgusting posts riddled with abject homophobia, racism, misogyny and general stupidity. When I told
some Swatties (interestingly, mostly freshmen and sophomores)
about the horrific things I'd read, they quickly resorted to the
escapist rhetoric of S watties still stuck in the dream ofan ideal
school
"Well, I'm sure that only an isolatedfew people wrote
that stuff. People aren't like that here."
But why should we think that the Swarthmore population
is exempt from such ways of thinking? Does Swarthmore interrogate each applicant as to his or her personal beliefs or
political convictions? I can't recall filling out any part of the
application that asked, "Are you a racist? Are you a
homophobe? Are you a misogynist?"
I'm not really sure how so many Swatties acquire these
misconceptions of Swat. Perhaps it's due to an amalgam of
Swat admissions and administration propaganda, the opinions of certain students to whom I spoke when applying (admissions plants, no doubt), and optimistic naivete. Whatever
the cause, it seems that the vision of Swarthmore that was a
shiny little ray of hope for some incoming freshman was nothing more than a sly enticement, a sham involving admissions,
the administration and Swarthmore students alike. In other
words, friends, we've been duped.
In this, Swarthmore is muchlike theUnited States. America
is constantly hailed as the greatest nation in the world, a bastion of freedom and meritocracy for the poor and huddled
masses of the world. It's funny, then, how much of the rest of
the world thinks we're a crime-ridden, barbaric, unjust society
that has a really stupid way of selecting the person who will
come to be known as the "leader ofthe free world." And that is
what's so annoying about America. It's not that it needs to be,
or could ever be, a perfect meritocratic Utopia for all people; it
just needs to stop telling everyone that it is.
Similarly, I'm not saying that Swarthmore must, or even
should, be a little liberal Utopia. Rather, I feel that the administration needs to be more honest about the realities of
Swarthmore in its presentation to incoming students.
But, much more importantly, Swatties themselves need to
realize that Swarthmore is much less perfect than they'd like
to think. We're not an ivory tower; we can't ascribe every act
of prejudice, hatred or puerile stupidity to "an isolated few."
Yes, Swarthmore may be an exceptional place, but it's also
more susceptible to the ills that plague the "real world" than
we might like to admit.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Testing conditions absurd, unfair
Dear Editor:
The story regarding Jared Solomon ("Student sues
LSAT over testing time limit," Jan. 25, pg. 3) was truly bizarre. Having begun college "reluctant to tellpeople" about
his ADD, and having applied for and received special academic treatment during his sophomore year, senior year
finds Mr. Solomon posing with a sign reading "PRISONER
CHARGE: LEARNING DISABLED." I imagine the picture was intended as a joke, but, I admit I don't get it. Who,
even jokingly, is oppressing Solomon? Definitely not this
college, and definitely not the LSAC, whose estimate that
he could take their test in five-plus hours was far closer to
the actual amount oftime he found necessary thanhis own
psychiatrist's "best estimate" ofnearly a full calendar day.
Some might find such a grossly inflated estimate solid
grounds for finding a better psychiatrist.
Moreover, despite Solomon's repeated insistence thathe
is "not looking in any way for an unfair advantage," his revised best estimate of 10 hours of testing time seems exactly
...

that. While I understand that students with legitimate disabilities may require extra time for their tests to be fairly
representative of their abilities, the conditions sought and
won by Solomon (which amount to being given nearly triple
the normal time and a host ofother special testing conditions) are so excessive as to be unfair to all the other students who struggled
and by all accounts the LSAT is a
struggle
to complete the test in the standard amount of
time. Admittedly, I couldbe wrong in deeming 10hours excessive, but I at least hope that if Mr. Solomon does in fact
work at one-third the speed of his peers, he chooses to bill
his clients at one-third the hourly rate.
I don't know Jared Solomon, and I certainly harbor
no animosity toward him. But I do feel his case illustrates
the abusive power that flimsy fairness rhetoric and flimsiermedical claims can wield when molded into the form
of a lawsuit. Sadly, that's a lesson that will serve him
well in his chosen field.

College should divest from arms manufacturing
Dear Editor:
We are writing to express our disappointment regarding the college's investment policy, in particular its unwillingness to consider divestment from arms manufacturers. In November a letter was sent to the Board ofManagers and the administration urging the college to re-examine its investment practices. Sadly, we feel that our
concerns were not given serious consideration.
Our letter suggested that the college draw a line in the
investment sand. Specifically, we proposed that
Swarthmore divest from such companies as arms manufacturers whose products are inherently destructive. We
recognize that a policy of divestment, if not pursued carefully, could undermine our endowment and our
community's ability to provide a unique educational experience. Yet to reject all divestment is to undermine the
moral foundations of the very community that our endowment makes possible. A line must be drawn a line
that protects our endowment and our ethics.
This line separates a corporation's practices and its
products. While our community may accept investment
in companies with questionable practices, we cannot stand
for investment in corporations that make products which
undermine the norms and traditions of the Swarthmore
community. Through stockholder resolutions, we are at
least able to take action against such corporate practices
as poor working conditions, low wages, few benefits and
policies harmful to the environment. However, we cannot

hope to influence, as stockholders, the very products that
define a corporation. Especially in light of Swarthmore's
Quaker roots, we believe that arms manufacturers—companies that manufacture land mines and missile systems
cross the line, as their products directly threaten human life and global security.
In response to our concerns, we received a letter from
the Vice President ofFinance and Planning on behalf of
the Committee on Socially Responsible Investing. The
reply indicated that "the purpose of the Endowment is to
generate the maximum rate of return within risk parameters
The Endowment must be policy neutral; it must
not be considered an instrument of social change." With
this standard in mind, we find ourselves sadly wondering whether the college would invest in chattel slavery if
it were determined to give high returns with little risk.
Just 14 years ago, Swarthmore resisted divestment from
South Africa on similar grounds, relenting only after a
student takeover of a Board of Managers meeting. We are
disturbed to find that college policy has not progressed.
....

We request that the administration and board reconsider the "policy neutrality" of the endowment. We call

for a constructive dialogue, from which we can reach a
resolution that reflects the community's values. We ask
that our concerns not be so readily dismissed.

Small change could make Swat football viable
Dear Editor:
Instead of eliminating football,
Swarthmore could build its image as
an innovative institution by changing
the way football is played. Swarthmore
should start a small-college football
conference that plays football with a
small, but significant, change in the
rules: once a player comes off the field,
he cannot go back on. Instead ofhordes
of specialized players being the pawns
of the coaches, the game would be returned to the athletes. Players would
have to be sufficiently skilled to play
both offense and defense. Since fewer
players would play, they all would play

e

so much more; the players would have
to be better all-around athletes. Because
they would be on the field the entire
time, they could not rely on the coaches
telling them what to do in every situation; the players would have to make
decisions on thefield. They would have
to know how to play the game.
While this would be hard to implement immediately, there are probably
enough other schools with concerns
about football to make a conference.
Football is expensive, andDivision 111
doesn't have the TV and ticket revenue to justify the cost. Making the
teams smaller(20 to 25 players) would

mean fewer coaches, less equipment,
fewer traveling costs, etc. And for
Swarthmore, it would mean football
would not have to dominate all the
available athletic slots or the male athletic pool in order to be competitive.
Although such a game would not
be appropriate for someone looking to
enter the NFL, that is not the goal of
most football players in Division 111
competition. And I think such a game
would be very attractive to most good
high school football players, particularly the more well-rounded athlete
that Swarthmore would be trying to
find. In high school, most of the best
players play offense and defense because they are the best athletes and
you don't have the student body (or
the recruiting) available for everyone
to specialize. Many high school players are disappointed in the amount of
playing time they get in college, and
this strategy would give athletes more
opportunity to play. I bet enough Division 111 schools in the Philadelphia
area are willing to try something like
this, or perhaps just to use this system when they play Swarthmore (so
they could try it out).

Halcyon, Halcyoff: it matters
sible death of the Halcyon seems to be di-

BY MATT RUBIN
Two weeks ago, right before coming back
to school, I dug up my parents' old college
yearbook. Sitting in my living room and

looking through it with them was one of the
highlights of my vacation. I

heard my parents describe
the first time they met and
saw the picture of the guy
who set them up together. I
saw an action shot of my father in the newsroom while
editing the paper (he had an
afro). I discovered that my
mother used to be beautiful.
So you can see why I am
particularly upset at the
news that the Halcyon might
be cancelled. I am also upset that no one
seems to care.
Here are some examples of what my
friends have said about this cancellation:
"1... 1... 1... I really... I just hate the Hal-

rected towards the quality of the publication
itself. These people agree that a good yearbook, in theory, can turn out to be a treasured heirloom. The Halcyon, they say, is

simply not a good yearbook.
Being the responsive and
considerate man that I am, I
decided to take a look at a
couple of old issues of the
Halcyon before dismissing
the publication out ofhand.
I must not have been lookat the same books that
other people have seen.

Bandersnatch, but then what the hell is a
Bandersnatch, or a Halcyon, for that matter?
If the yearbook is fine, I wonder, then
why do we criticize it? Perhaps the reason
we criticize the Halcyon so much has nothing to do with the Halcyon itself. Perhaps
we deride it because it reminds of all the
"traditional" college or high school things
that we reject here at idyllic Swarthmore.
We have no mascot. We have no sororities.

No.
Just because we continually praise our
quirky intellectualism does not mean that we
need to eliminate standard traditions that
are nevertheless lovely. By this logic, we
might as well not have a graduation ceremony. Without a yearbook, we won't have
any photos to remember it by anyway.
Both the Alumni Office and Student Bu
get Committee are debating who, if at all,
should fund the Halcyon. What is most important to me is thatit gets funded, period.
But, considering that the yearbook is a
product received and used by alumni, I
think it is clear that the Alumni Office
should be funding it.
Students need to do whatver they can ■"
to make sure this happens. Student
Council needs to talk to the Alumni Office; students need to talk to Student
Council; we all need to talk to each
other.
I am still a young man, but my par}
ents have convinced me that I will treasure my yearbooks as I get older. No
longer will the yearbook be nothing
more than a way to say, "LYLAS and

the people who inspired me and this entire

Don't let petty
goals interfere
with big picture BY
I had a dream the other day: I was waiting for my
dad to come back from work and take me to the airport. I was initially preoccupied because he took
longer than I expected. When he was finally ready, I
checked to find out whether I had something in my
suitcase, only to discover that most of the contents I
had packed had been replaced by things I did not
need, such as numerous cans of tennis balls. I had to
remove everything from my bag and start packing
from scratch with no time available. The stress level
was sky-high as I sifted through my stuff to decide
what was necessary. I did not question why I was in
such a hurry or why it was so important to get to the
airport until I woke up.
I feel that people are more stressed than ever.
Whether getting to the airport on time or writing a
paper, people are stressed, especially at Swarthmore.
A more relaxed approach vanishes and is replaced
by a potentially self-destructive drive for perfection.

Mediocrity is unacceptable. Maybe that is the price
to pay for studying at an elite school, but sometimes
I seriously question whether it is worth it.

Small goals become the basis of my existence: "Do
the readings. Do the dishes. Do the papers. Do, do,
do, dooo!" And in the middle of all this doing, awareness evaporates as I get turned into a stress-ball. My
personal belief is that everything has its own rhythm,
its own nature that should be respected. However, I
often find myself trying to cram the reading in or to
write a good paper very quickly. I agonize over
whether I'll have enough time to do everything I absolutely must. I forget that there is no one here giving orders other than myself and forget to question
whether I really feel like doing this stuff.
I think about loading dynamite and a timer into a
room. We build our bombs as we choose our classes,
and once the add/drop period is over we are locked
in a room for the rest of the semester trying to disassemble what we ourselves built. More explosives are
added and time dwindles, but the challenge remains
the same. When all we can think about is the danger
of the explosives, we forget we are dreaming, as indeed we are. By recognizing that this all a dream, we
can simply dismiss its existence. Far easier said than
done, but nonetheless possible.
The emphasis here is on the ends— whether or
not I'll get a good grade on a paper rather than the
means. I never ask, "Did I enjoy doing this?" And
enjoying myself does not entail cracking jokes and
drinking booze as I write the paper. Enjoying myself
means allowing my ideas to be transferred onto the
page without so much concern about whether they
will be right or wrong, liked or disliked, good or bad.
Because a paper is ultimately just another brick in
the road to something else and, as such, I do not think
it can beassessed as a definitive piece of work, much
less something representative of who I am or what I
am worth. In fact, I think nothing can, and the important thing is to have enough confidence to allow
the writing process to turn you into a good writer,
rather than imposing good writing on the process.
In losing sight of the process, the loss of proportions is inevitable. Every goal becomes vital to my
existence and I quickly forget that there is much more
to life than whatever I am doing at the moment. Focusing on the process, however, allows me to see the
proportions in my life.
The opportunity for complete immersion that is
offered here at Swarthmore is great in many ways,
as it enables us to really focus on our work and not
worry about anything else. At the same time, I think
the challenge is not to lose sight of what we really
and basically deem important in our lives. To some
extent, if we have that clear, the rest should follow.

OUTSIDE
THE BOX
When he referred to the left, late Vice President Spiro
Agnew was unkind. Agnew accused members of the left of
being "hysterical hypochondriacs of history," "nattering nabobs of negativism" and "pusillanimous pussyfooters."
Agnew spared few leftists in his frequent rhetoricalassaults

least of all the anti-Vietnam radicals of Swarthmore Col-

lege, who, legend has it, would stare icily at commuters getting on and off SEPTA, since they were the fuel behind the
process that was leading to the murder ofmillions of Vietnamese. Agnew issued to Swarthmore perhaps the most damning
pejorative of the day, labeling us the "Kremlin on the Crum."
While today's Swarthmore population has toned down its

liberal extremism, there remains little doubt that the dominant ideology of our institution is leftist. The main political
question most of us pondered last semester was not whether
to vote for Bush or Gore, but
whether to vote for Gore or
Nader. More accurately, the question that seemed to be dominating The Phoenix opinions pages
was whether a "vote for Nader really was a vote for Bush"
the
implication being that Bush and
his agenda were so evil that it
would prohibit one voting for
one's favorite candidate.
Swarthmore's continued preoccupation with the assumption that social justice is dependent on a leftist ideology defies
America's national ideological movements. In the 19605, the
left's liberalismwas dominant; intellectuals seemed unanimous
in their support for federal programs to alleviate poverty and
their agreement on federal rights over states' rights.
The 1990s witnessed the domination of conservative ideology, embodied in Newt Gingrich's 1994 ascent to power. Since
1994, conservatives have taken the intellectual initiative by
asserting the supremacy of federalism and the importance of
personal responsibility. Just like conservatives in thelate 19605,
modern liberals' main activity is reaction
they either react
to conservative initiatives by adopting them as their own (welfare reform, free trade), or they react to conservative initiatives by kicking and screaming incoherently (WTO protests).
The fact that our political thought on both school and nation-wide levels is dominated by ideology is highly problematic. Ideologues seem to think that on some absolute level they
are right, and those who disagree are not only wrong, they are
enemies. If you try to convince anyone from the conservative
Heritage Foundation that the United States should occasionally assist in building nations, you will witness immediate,

Ideologues limit
intellectual growth
vigorous disagreement, regardless of their expertise on the
topic. Likewise, I wish you luck if you talk to a member of
Swarthmore's ideologically driven Progressive Action Coali-

tion about the virtues of school vouchers or missile defense.
On topics where serious people disagree, can one side really be right and the other wrong? With science, the answer
is yes, but with policy I would venture the answer is no all
but a few times a century. While we can all agree that the
abolitionists were right on an absolute level, it seems unclear
who among the hawks and the doves was right in 1812, or
whether the "free silver movement" was more right than the
"hard money policy" in 1896.
On matters of which we are certain, it can seem baffling
that knowledgeable, serious people can disagree with us. Slate's
Michael Kinsley identifies two legitimate reasons that those
who disagree with us can be
wrong: they can be blinded by
either prejudice or predisposition. Kinsley's prejudice seems
to explain why the left habitually calls those who disagree
with it racist, sexist and/or homophobic. Predisposition illustrates how, incredibly, people's
framework of beliefs can give
them an opinion on any given
issue, even if they are unaware of the specifics
in other
words, an ideology.
Predisposition is the direct result oflaziness or weakness.
It is difficult to constantly adjust our system of beliefs every
time a new issue comes up. The way we view the world politically can provide us depth, security and meaning in a dangerous fashion, and it may be emotionally debilitating to constantly scrap our world vision for seemingly minor issues.
It is dangerous when we can no longer discuss many issues
and thoughts seriously. We must overcome our weakness and
laziness in order to build a community where we can approach
each new topic based on that topic alone, and not from a rigid
personal framework ofbeliefs that may or may not apply. Those
who disagree with us are just as "right" as we are.
On a national level, we must realize that the ideology of
1990s conservatism is as empty as that of 1960s liberalism.
When conservatives attack the federal government for no
other reason than that is the way their mind works, it hurts
our nation as a whole and prevents the conception of future
Marshall Programs. We must stand up to and rebut ideologues
wherever and whenever they preach. To do otherwise is to
limit the freedom and growth of the human mind.

PART TWO OF TWO
BY SONIA SCHERR
In the past 40 years, the civil rights movement has led to greater equality for
people of color; affirmative action policies have helped open up higher education to those previously excluded from predominately white institutions; and,
at Swarthmore, these societal changes, coupled with college initiatives, have
slowly begun to change the once-homogeneous face of the faculty.
The first black and Latino/a professors were hired in the 19705. Today, 13
percent of Swarthmore's tenure-track faculty are minorities, 76 percent ofwhom
have tenure.
Several efforts in the past dozen years have focused on increasing the representation of minority faculty at Swarthmore. One such initiative is the minority-scholars-in-residence program, which brings people of color just beginning
their academic careers to campus for temporary appointments, thereby allowing them to experience a liberal-arts environment and enabling the college to
find potential minority candidates for more permanent positions.
According to those interviewed, the effort to diversify the faculty is essential
to Swarthmore's larger mission as an institution of higher education.
Braulio Munoz, professor and chair of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, said that to be effective leaders of this country, the next generation
being formed at Swarthmore will need a "complete picture" of America in all its
increasing diversity. If an institution does not provide this complete picture, he
said, then it will not produce leaders and its influence will weaken.
"Swarthmore must never be an island; it must reflect what society at large
is," Munoz said. "We want to be a leader of society and therefore we can never
be separate from society."
This article, the second in a two-part series, focuses on the success of
Swarthmore's recent initiatives and the reasons why the numbers of minority
faculty remain low; last week's article addressed the history of faculty diversity
here as well as specific efforts to bring more minorities to the college.

Swarthmore's Progress
Recent studies show that colleges and universities nationwide have made
few stridestoward diversifying their faculty. At Swarthmore, however, the number of minority faculty members has increased in the past twenty years. In 19801981, ten faculty members on the tenure track were minorities; in 1990-1991, there
were 16 faculty of color in tenure-track positions. Among the 160 faculty members holding tenure-track appointments in the current academic year, there are
21 minorities, including 12 African-Americans, six Asian-Americans, and three
Latino/as. Moreover, one of every four appointments to tenure-track positions
in the past five years has been a person of color.
Most minority faculty and departmental chairsfeel that the college has made
significant headway in the effort to diversify its faculty, though more work re-

BE AN ISLAND; IT MUST
REFLECT WHAT SOCIETY AT
LARGE IS. WE WANT TO BE A
LEADER OF SOCIETY AND
THEREFORE WE CAN NEVER
BE SEPARATE FROM
SOCIETY."
mains to be done.
Expressing the opinion of the majority of faculty
interviewed, Munoz said, "There's been quite a bit
of progress over the past ten years." But, he added,
"the effort to recruit minority faculty must be ongoing and constant because the numbers are stilllow."
The faculty were unanimous in theirpraise of the
work that President Al Bloom and Provost Jennie
Keith have done to bring more minority faculty to
the college.
Political science professor Keith Reeves said
Bloom and Keith played a crucial role in convincing
him to leave an attractive position at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government.The decision to leave
Harvard was a difficult one, Reeves said, and he
needed to be persuaded that accepting an appointment here would be good for him personally and pro-

fessionally as well as for the college.
"I myself could not have envisioned coming
if Al and Jennie had not been in their respective
capacities," said Reeves, who is currently on a
leave ofabsence from Harvard and could end up
staying at Swarthmore. "Their encouragement
and support suggested a level of commitment
that's not mere lip service."
Reeves, who grew up in nearby Chester and
attended Swarthmore in the mid-1980s, said the
college has grown more diverse since he was a
student. He especially noted a younger cohort of
minority faculty in areas such as economics, political science, and mathematics, where they previously had been much less visible.
But those interviewed felt that the college is
not at point where it can relax efforts to diversify the faculty.
Mathematics professor Garikai Campbell,
who attended Swarthmore as an undergraduate
in the late 1980s, said the college had made "incredible strides" with regard to encouraging excellent black scholars to consider Swarthmore.
Campbell believes there is room for further
progress both in recruiting and retaining more
African-Americans and other minorities in tenure-track positions. "I think Swarthmore has
clearly taken a leadership role in increading
diversity and I think it is critical that
Swarthmore coninue to build on this commitment, particularly at the faculty level, particu-

The student perspective
While not as positive as professors in their assessment of the
college's attempt to diversify its faculty, most students of color
interviewed said some headway has occurred in this area. But
they would like more efforts to be made.
Charles Withers 'O2, vice-president of the Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Student Society (SASS), said, "I'm very disappointed
that I have yet to have a black professor in the sciences at all
during my two and a half years here."
A biology major who isalso taking pre-medical courses, Withers
said thefaculty should reflect the diversity present in the student
body. "As a black man, it's encouraging to see other black men
and women in the field I'm going into," he said.
Withers said he has noted the work the college has done to
build faculty diversity, but it has not been enough. "I would like to
see more done before I leave," he said.

Delonte Gholston 'O2 is a former member of the SASS
executive board who served as student observer to the Board of
Managers last semester. Speaking as a student, Gholston said
that although he does not think the college is doing everything
possible to bring minority faculty here, "it is making a full and
honest effort to recruit and retain faculty of color."
Gholston believes that faculty of color are particularly likely
to understand any transition issues students might experience
upon moving from their home environment to immersion in
Swarthmore's culture. Moreover, Gholston said, "it would be a
sad tragedy to see members of color only in service positions
and not in the upper echelons of the intelligentsia."
Stacey Wagaman 'Ol, who helped found the Native American
Student Association last spring, said she is "not too pleased"
that the appointment of English instructor Michelle Hermann as
a minority-scholar-in-residence will end this year. Hermann is the
only American Indian faculty member at the college, which means
that of all underrepresented minority groups, American Indians
have the weakest presence among the faculty. There are about
eight American Indian students at Swarthmore.
According to Wagaman, Hermann has served as an advisor
for NASA and for American Indian students in general. "It's nice
to have someone to talk to about Indian issues," Wagaman said.
For instance, when some members of the college community
reacted negatively to NASA's "casino night" an event intended
to increase awareness of American Indian gaming and its
significance to tribal culture
Hermann was able to provide
support.
By teaching courses on American Indian literature, Hermann
has also allowed the English department to offer a broader
curriculum. Wagaman is worried thatwhen Hermann leaves, the
college will not hire another American Indian professor to replace
her. "There aren't many Native Americans here, period,"
Wagaman said. Eliminating courses like those Hermann taught
"would be a further act of marginalization in my mind," she said.
Gloria Chan 'O2, president of the Swarthmore Asian
Organization, said her impression is that some departments make
a strong effort to recruit minority faculty, while others do not.
Kaysha Corinealdi 'O2, who serves on the board of the
Hispanic Organization for Latino Awareness (HOLA), said she
thinks the college has made strides in recruiting black faculty
members. "Now the college needs to implement those efforts
with the same force and hopefully not with the same amount
of time for Latino/a and Asian faculty," she said.
According to Corinealdi, the presence of minority faculty often
gives students of color a sense that their voices are heard.
"Faculty of color are very open to all students," she said, "and
can have a special connection to students of color."
In some cases, student organizations have taken on the task
of working to increase the number of faculty of color at
Swarthmore.
Last spring, SASS wrote a letter to the administration urging
them to seriously consider hiring black professors in tenure-track
faculty positions, according to Withers. The group also sent a
letter to the athletic department urging them to do the same for
black head coaches.
According to Wagaman, NASA has sent a letter to the English
department in support of retaining Hermann.
Chan said that a SAO administrative committee is trying to
help find ways to retain good minority professors currently in
part-time positions, as well as to assist the English department
with its search for an adjunct faculty member who would teach
Asian-American literature. Another goal of the committee is to
facilitate discussion between students and professors on the
topic of diversity.

'Pipeline’ problem
Narrow applicant pool result of minority underrepresentation in doctoral degrees
From DIVERSITY, pg. 11
larly in the most difficult area of the natural sciences.
Currently, four minority faculty with tenure-track
appointments are in the natural sciences, eight are in
the humanities, eight are in the social sciences and one
is in physical education.
History professor Lillian Li offered a somewhat different outlook. While saying she would be happy to have
more Asian-Americans on the faculty, she does not believe that they are underrepresented in the same way as
other minority groups, since the percentage of AsianAmericans in academia
and particularly in the natural sciences tends to be at least as great as their representation in America at large.
"The real test ofwhether there's prejudice is whether
you'd hire an Asian-American to teachRussian history,"
she said.

Challenges and Opportunities
Nationwide, although minoritiescomprise 28 percent
of the general population, they hold about 16 percent of
full-time faculty positions. Asian-Americans comprise 5.5
percent of full-time faculty; blacks, 4.9 percent; Latino/
as, 2.6 percent; and American Indians, 0.4 percent, according to a 1997 report from the National Centerfor Educa-

tion Statistics.
One issue that Swarthmore along with other institutions faces in its efforts to recruit minority faculty
is a narrow "pipeline," or the relatively small number of
minorities with doctorates who are looking for jobs in
academia. Swarthmore generally requires that tenuretrack faculty hold a Ph.D., and while minorities are earning more doctoral degrees than ever before, they remain
underrepresented among all recipients.
In 1996-1997, for instance, minoritiesreceived 17 percent of doctoral degrees, according to the NCESWeb site.
The Chronicle of Higher Education stated that in 1998,
African-Americans received 1,467 doctorates, or approximately 5 percent of the total number awarded. Approximately one-third of these Ph.D.s were in education.
And minorities who earn Ph.D.s may choose to enter
private industry ratherthan pursue a career in higher education. This means there is intense competition among institutions for those who do enter the academic job market.
The pipeline is particularly narrow in the natural sciences, where minorities (with the exception of AsianAmericans) account for fewer Ph.D. recipients than they
do in otherfields. In 1998, for instance, 50 African-Americans received Ph.D.s in the physical sciences, according
to a report from the National Science Foundation.
By contrast, the chairs of the Department of Sociology
and Anthropology and the Department of Modern Languages andLiteratures reported that they generally do not
have trouble finding minority candidates for positions because ofthemulticultural nature ofthese disciplines. Similarly, certain subfields ofthe humanities or social sciences,
such as African-American or Latin-American history, also
tend to attract a diverse pool of applicants.
But why the pipeline problem in many fields? First,
minorities tend to be underrepresented at every level of
educational attainment, which means they are less likely
to befound at the highest levels. In addition, for both minorities and non-minorities, the first generation to obtain a degree beyond the bachelor's may experience more
pressure to seek jobs with a higher level of economic security or to pursue career paths that society deems more
prestigious, faculty members said. Biology professor
Mark Jacobs pointed out that unlike fields such as law
and medicine, the academic profession tends not to be
well understood by those outside it. In some cases, the
issue may be a lack of emotional and/or financial support necessary to complete a Ph.D. program.
The notion of"cultural capital" may also help explain
why there are fewer minorities in the pipeline, according to Munoz. If students both minorities and non-minorities —come from an environmentwhere intellectual
pursuits are the norm, they often absorb these values.
Upon entering college, they may view the academic world
as an extension of themselves and consider joining that
world. But if this is not the case, then "even if you go to
school, you will see thatworld as something different from

who [you] are," making it more difficult to be comfortable
with academic life, Munoz said.
Furthermore, when looking for jobs in academia, the
attractions of Ivy League schools frequently beckon.
"Many minority faculty come from a culture and tradition in which Harvard and Yale are top," Munoz said.
Although Swarthmore is an elite institution, it is not a
research university a distinction that has a particular
impact in the natural sciences, according to Campbell. The
college is incredibly supportive when it comes to obtaining resources and getting set up to do your research, but
many people just don't know this about Swarthmore.
Building bridges to the conferencelike the MellonMinority Undergraduate Fellowship Summer Conference, which
hosts outstanding, recent Ph.D.s is essential to increasing
the diversity in the pool of people who know about and
seriously consider Swarthmore," Campbell said.
Reeves believes that some colleges and universities
although not Swarthmore —do not know how to recruit black
faculty members. One schoolwherehe was recruited seemed
to think that he would accept a position if offered the right
amount of money. Although he tried to explain that considerations such as the academic environment were more important than money, "they didn't get it," Reeves said.
"Some institutions forget that African-American schol-

"I WOULD BE WILLING TO
WAGER THAT FACULTY OF
COLOR HAVE MORE
HEADHUNTERS CALLING THEM."
ars are like everyone else and want to be treated and approached as such," he added.
In addition, the presence of colleagues
whether minority or non-minority
involved in a common area of
research and available to share ideas "is an important intangible, particularly with minority faculty members,"
Reeves said.

At Swarthmore and other traditionally white institutions, the relatively smallnumber of minority faculty may
discourage others from coming. But many of the minority faculty interviewed for this article said they saw this
as an opportunity to promote change.
"I knew that was a problem," said economics professor
Philip Jefferson. "I embraced it as a challenge. I knew that
by my coming here it would makeit easierfor others to come."
Others said that Swarthmore's effort to achieve a diverse campus was one of the reasons they chose to accept
a position. "The college's commitment to student diversity was a signal to me that it had a real interest in a diverse community," said Marcus McFerren, minorityscholar-in-residence in biology.
But even once faculty arrive at the college, other opportunities may arise to lure themaway. Vollmersaid she
as been contacted half a dozen times by headhunters for
both academicand non-academic positions, some of which
paid more than her current salary.
"I would be willing to wager that faculty of color have
more headhunters calling them," she said.
Looking Ahead
Although bringing minority faculty to the college may
be challenging in some areas, those interviewed agreed
that the effort must continue.
"We're not a college that should sit back and say, it's
hard everywhere, because we're a college that's on top
and that's watched," Jacobs said.
Jefferson said, "As of right now, I think it's important
for the college to continue doing what it's doing and make
sure there's no dropping of the ball as candidates present

themselves."

Spanish professor Aurora Camacho de Schmidt
stressed the importance of taking into account a
candidate's life experience when making hiring decisions.
In a figurative sense, some minority faculty members

Future diversity challenges

The environment for minority faculty

From DIVERSITY, pg. 12

Building a diverse faculty does not end with successful recruitment strategies, researchers say,
but also depends on the environment that minority scholars find once they arrive at an institution.
At Swarthmore, the faculty of color interviewed unanimously said they feel welcomed by the
college and have encountered a supportive atmosphere. Nevertheless, some of those interviewed
said they still face distinct issues as faculty of color.
Economics professor Philip Jefferson said his experience as a minority faculty member has
been "very positive."
"I'm appropriately viewed in the college and in economics in general as a person first and then as
an economist," he said. "For me personally, race has not played much of a role in terms of my
experience here."
At the same time, however, Jefferson said the broad nature of his involvement in academia and
college life does not give anyone the opportunity to view him solely as a minority faculty member.
"People through experience come to realize by looking at my scholarship, teaching and particularly
service [to the college] that it would be inaccurate and inappropriate to narrow my contribution
simply to thatof the minority professor in economics."
Mathematics professor Garikai Campbell said that while feeling comfortable in the Swarthmore
environment, he is nonetheless aware of his status as a minority. "It's not trivial being the only
African-American [tenure-track professor] in the natural sciences," Campbell said. "There are issues
having to do with diversity that need to be worked out. It's the natural process of a place trying to be
more diverse."
While departments do not provide support to faculty of color beyond what is usually given to
professors, some minority faculty say they have actively sought out mentors among their colleagues.
Campbell, who hopes to become Swarthmore's first tenuredblack professor in the natural sciences,
believes he is highly fortunate to have found two black faculty members whom he considers mentors.
Their guidance has been critical to his success, Campbell said. "There are sometimes nuances to
things that go on that I feel they are uniquely qualified to pick up on," he said. "They can give a good
perspective to what you are going through."
But mentoring also comes from non-minority faculty. Political science professor Keith Reeves said
that Richard Rubin, a professor of political science and public policy, served as his undergraduate
mentor here and continues to provide support. "In the last ten or 15 years, I have not made a major
decision without consulting him," he said.
Mentoring is important for both minority and non-minority junior faculty, said biology professor
Amy Cheng Vollmer, who pointed out thatthe transition from a high-powered research environment
to a high-powered teaching environment is similar to the move from high school to college. But
mentoring tends to be uneven, Vollmer said, with some departments adopting a more proactive
approach than others.
Because they are often asked to provide minority representation on college committees or to serve
as mentors for minority students, faculty of color—at Swarthmore and at predominantly white institutions
nationwide—face additional pressures along with the usual demands of teaching and scholarship.
These extra responsibilities can be "a huge component of the job," Jefferson said. "Speaking in
general, that has been a concern for some minority faculty."
Spanish professor Aurora Camacho de Schmidt said she is frequently invited to be on committees.
"I find it very time-consuming, but it's not a burden," she said. "The fact that faculty elect me to
committees shows their desire for minority representation and openness to me."
Campbell said such pressures are part of what faculty of color must deal with as members of
underrepresented groups. "It's hard. I don'tthinkthere's any way around it," he said. "If there's an issue
that affects a particular minority group, all people part of that minority group care about that issue."
Sometimes, students of colorfeel more comfortable relating to minority faculty members because
of similarities in cultural background. As a result, minority professors frequently serve as informal
advisors to students of color even those whose course work is not concentrated in their particular
departments. Vollmersaid students come to speak with her about issues such as interracial dating
and familial pressures to pursue certain career paths. "I can understand where they're coming from,"
she said. "Some of my wonderful colleagues might not be able to."
Although the college does not do anything special to retain minority faculty once they are in
tenure-track positions, provost Jennie Keith said, "We try to recognize that, because of their small
numbers, minority faculty members face even more demands on their time and energy than others."
Departmental chairs were divided on whether or not these extra burdens are taken into account
in tenure and other promotional decisions.
But several faculty of color said they personally havefound ways to ease the additional pressures
placed on them. One strategy is to have a vision of what they want their activities to be.
Vollmer remembered when she was the only non-tenured faculty member on the second ballot
for the Council on Educational Policy. Involved in other committees at the time, Vollmer initially
wondered if she should ask to have her name taken off the list, although she decided against this
after soliciting the advice of colleagues. Instead, her name remained on the ballot. When elected,
she asked the provost to limit her other committee assignments.
"The point is to be strategic," said Vollmer, adding that she ultimately learned a great deal
about how the college works from her experience on the CEP while still having time to devote to
research and teaching.
In addition, Vollmer advises students to be understanding of faculty responsibilities. According to
Vollmer, whilefaculty of color remember their own lack of mentors in college and want to work with
minority students, they also need time to develop professionally. For instance, when students asked
Vollmer to serve as advisor to the Swarthmore Asian Organization, she requested that they meet in
her laboratory rather than in her office. She was trying to make a point about where her efforts must
lie. "I couldn't be SAO advisor because the department would look at that as a diversion from why I
got hired," she explained.
But professors say that alleviating the pressuresfor minority faculty members is ultimately a matter
of strengthening their presence at the college. Speaking of this need to have a "critical mass" of minority
faculty at Swarthmore, Braulio Muhoz, professor and chair of the Department of Sociology and
Anthropology, said, "We're not there yet; we need to get there. Once we do, it'll be a much better place
for minority faculty in terms of more people to share the burden and make it a piace of their own."
SONIA SCHERR

might havehad to travel a longer distance to get here because of theirbackgrounds.
This experience provides a larger perspective and is valuablefor students to know
about, Camacho de Schmidt said.
Munoz believes that the college must recruit faculty in the way that it recruits its
students, by emphasizing the small size, supportive environment, and quality offacilities.
In addition to increasing connections with institutions that graduate good minority candidates, Campbell said the college should work to build stronger relationship withprograms such as the Mellon Minority Undergraduate Fellowship,
aimed at encouraging students ofcolor to pursue careers in academia. Campbell's
own experience as a Mellon Fellow played an important role in his decision to
become a professor. In particular, Mellon conferences provided valuable support
given the small number of minorities in some Ph.D. programs, said Campbell,
who was the second African-American to earn a doctorate in math from Rutgers.
Moreover, Campbell feels that the college should study how well it is doing in
terms of attracting undergraduate students of color to the natural studies in order to determine what action might be taken in this area. "If there can be real
changes here, then there can be real changes at higher levels," he said.
The potential to have an impact on underrepresented minorities in the natural sciences was one of the reasons Campbell came to the college. Because of
Swarthmore's teaching opportunities and commitmentto diversity, Campbell said
he felt this impact could be made in this environment better than in any other.
Indeed, the personal experience of minority faculty here attests to the influ-

ence that faculty ofcolor may have on students' future directions.
For instance, as an undergraduate at Vassar, Jefferson was struck by the dearth
ofblack students and professors in the economics department and in the college in
general. During the summer after his junior year, he participated in a program run
by the American Economics Association for minorities interested in pursuing a
doctorate in economics. The experience was "transformative," Jefferson said.
"That single image of working with students who were like me and seeing
students who were like me at the head of the classroom was all that I needed to
make me believe that I could, ifI chose, study economics for the rest of my life,"
he said.
As for Swarthmore's effort to diversify its faculty, Camacho de Schmidt
stressed that an open attitude is not enough; rather, the college must actively
work for inclusion.
"In the year 2001, an institution can't be predominately white by chance," she
said. "There must be forces thatkeep it that way."
But Camacho de Schmidt and Vollmer believe that Swarthmore is in a unique
position to overcome these forces. "What this college can do is not what other
colleges can do," Camacho de Schmidt said. "They don't have the Quaker tradition, the liberal tradition, the community, the student body."
Looking forward to a time when a conversation on minority faculty would be
unnecessary, Vollmer said, "If any place can do this, it's a place like Swarthmore."

LIVING
Lonely and lost in a
sea of WWF fans, I
cried (a little)
BY FRANK MARTINEZ
I never thought that I could be lonely while sitting in the
same building with 21,000 people. But that was what happened
on Sunday when I went to see the WWF's "Come Get Some"
with a couple friends. First of all, my seat was lonely. Despite
having a $45 ticket, I got a seat that, by quirk of the stadium
designers, was all by itself. So I pretty much sat in a section of
one person for the entire almost-three-hour event.
Everything about it was lonely. The whole South Philadelphia sports complex is lonely with its wide, seemingly deserted
streets. The First Union Center seemed lonely, too, with all
that empty space up above and those rows upon rows of morose maroon chairs. And, most poignantly, the world of professional wrestling is lonely.
The WWF is a world in which wrestlers abuse their bodies
like no human should and never get to see their families because they're always on the road. To a professional wrestler,
the audience's adoration
the one clear and constant sign of
intimacy in their lives
can evaporate in a second. Take too
long to do something exciting or perform a sloppy suplex and
thousands of cheering fans will suddenly boo and hiss.
That does not even begin to address the wrestling fans.
Imagine what kind of a person, especially if they are even close
to grown, would pay a sizable chunk of money to go and watch
guys in their underwear pretend to hit one other. A person, I
am afraid, who deep down is looking for some sort of connection. A person, perhaps, like Scott Kushner.
Now, I don't mean to belittle wrestling fans. Not at all. Everything in moderation is healthy, and I am not ashamed to
say that I used to be a wrestling fan, when I was twelve. And
my Grandpa, who recently passed away, used to get a kick out
ofwatching "rasslers" on Saturday mornings. But there's something disturbing about people who don't get IDed at bars but
yell and scream at an event like "Come Get Some."
I'm being too hard on wrestling, I know. I did have fun, for
the most part. Those guys had some great moves that were
pleasures to behold. It is an "athletic contest" where the term
"contest" is questionable, and "athletic" downright wrong. Electrifying pyrotechnic displays certainly got me pumped. But I
still think, mostly, the experience was lonely.
I felt lonely all alone in my island-for-a-bleacher seat. I felt
lonely because I had no idea who the wrestlers were, what
their secret moves were, or even what comic book-like ideal
they represented. In my day, it was easy. Hulk Hogan stood for
America and Yokozuna stood for Japan. The Undertaker stood
for dead people and scary stuff while Lex Luger stood for himself. On Sunday, it seemed like every wrestler just stood for
himself, and the fans loved it anyway.
It seemed like the fans are just for themselves, too. They
only want what pleases them. The new WWF is overglamorized, overcomercialized, and oversexed. I swear I heard someone near me yell, "Show your tits!" at the busty lady on stage
even before the opening ceremony ended. (It might have been
Ted, but doesn't he have a girlfriend?) Isn't pro wrestling supposed to be about cheering for good guys who fight bad guys,
not flipping the bird into a camera and degrading women?
But it's all a Utile different now. Even the Undertaker has
drastically changed. Now he's just some tall guy chilling in
pants and a black T-shirt. Before, I really thought that, just
maybe, he was one of the undead who just happened to pursue
a career in the professional wrestling circuit. But now that
myth has died, at least to me.
At some parts, the loneliness really got to me. I was sitting
in my solitary chair, my knees practically curled to my chest,
enjoying my nachos to the fullest. I was watching the show in
this position when a particularly loud, bright firework went
off—frightening me rather thoroughly. As I looked around at
the wildly screaming, anger-infused mob and the smoke clearing by the mat, I began to cry.
Then my friend Scott looked over at me, and I realized I
was being silly. It was dark, so he couldn't have seen my tears,
which I quickly wiped away. I stood up, screamed and put both
arms in the air in a victory pose, each index finger extended
skyward to emphasize my elation. The Rock was working the
crowd, and he's my new favorite wrestler.

Back in the day, wrestling was
more pure, more All-American
I remember a day when, to be a professional wrestler,
all you needed was face paint and a Speedo. You could be
deaf, dumb and obese (a la Andre the Giant, Earthquake,
and Greg "The Hammer" Valentine) and nobody cared.
Now, you need an entourage, a wardrobe of silk shirts
and velvet pants, a lifetime supply of steroids and the
public speaking prowess of Winston Churchill.
I remember a day when body-slams were high-risk
maneuvers and there was no way you could kick out of a
leg drop. Now, wrestlers shrug off chair shots as if they're
mosquito bites and the crowd mercilessly pelts you with
batteries unless you do a double back-flip through a table.
I remember a day when fans cheered American he-

biceps, and stripping down to our tighty-whities justprior
to my beating him within one clothesline of death. Now,
my brother would probably get the upper hand, and I'd
be the one ending up in traction from a flying pile-drive.
(Note: My brother was never actually in traction. It was
just a severe neck sprain.)
I remember a day when wrestling was as real as war
and as serious as a heart attack. The only "in depth"
wrestling coverage could be found in the WWF magazine, which advertised $2O foam fingers reading
"Bushwackers" and reaffirmed the realism of wrestling.
Now, professional wrestling is admittedly just "sports

wrestling managers were
pipsqueaks whose voices vastly over-

flesh-colored, back-breaking saline bags to the
ring and slide off their miniskirts to expose their

I remember a day when I had to stealthily
sneak into our living room after everyone was
in bed so I could catch the last 10 minutes of Saturday Night's Main Event, only to see Marty
Janetty making short work of the Brooklyn

like "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, the Undertaker,
and Triple H square off every Monday, Thursday and Sunday, every week of the year.
I remember a day when wrestling pay-perviews were actually worth $49.99 because
there were only 4 such events per year and
it was your one chance to see the likes of
Randy "Macho Man" Savage and Jake
"The Snake" Roberts in action. Now, they hold
a pay-per-view every month, the matches are exactly
the same as the ones I've been watching on Mondays,
Thursdays and Sundays, and the price has been upped
to $59.99.
I remember a day when the WWF's token AfricanAmerican was "The Birdman" Koko B. Ware, who
brought a parrot to the ring just before he got his face
kicked in. Now, the Federation's token African-American is K-Kwik, the dookie braid-sporting, bad southern
rap-spouting, crowd nap-inducing, baggy-jean-covered

teenage and twentysomething thing: the crowd I saw ranged
from age seven to 70, from a child leading his father with
"Austin 3:16" signs to a grandmotherly woman in the row
beside me checking program stats.
Finally, WWF is not just a guy thing; the tone is definitely macho, but the crowd is filled with women, from
teenagers to women in their fifties, yearning to see the Rock
and Stone Cold Steve Austin in action. When I arrived at
the ticket window, I looked to my right and watched the
female of a young couple pick up the tickets reserved under her name and credit card, looking far more eager than
her man. Meanwhile, the champion of the women's division is a proud, tall, brunette cross-dresser, Ivory, and the
most popular female, Chyna, is not worried about her body
image in the least.
The tournament began promptly at 1:00 p.m. with a local radio announcer asking for the cheers of the "WWF
kids" in the house and receiving a huge response from an
audience that was mostly too young to be buying the beer
on tap. It was not clear during intermission whether the
parents had dragged the kids, or the kids had dragged their
parents; both groups seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the
show. And why not? It had a little of everything. It was a
gladiatorial battle with the roaring
Philadelphia crowd as raucous as
Romans. It was an intense
drama, as tag team wrestlers

fans got a hard-rock/hip-hop

simulated the acrobatic feats of a circus.
Near the end, when the Too Cool duo emerged
in spotted white jackets and jeans to taunt the ref,
the crowd and each other, I even sensed a little
bit of slapstick silent comedy in the mix.
I finally realized that all the cartoonish elements in the ring add up to a battle of live-action
superheroes for children of the post-comic book
age. These kids in red-and-black Kane mask are
worshipping heroes just like I used to worship
Spidey and the X-Men. Chyna, wearing an
American flag jumpsuit, looks exactly like

Wonder Woman on steroids. WWF wrestlers
are even better than Marvel superheroes
because they don't need secret identities. The Rock is all Hulk and no

Mild-mannered Ted Chan, a hard-working, generally
civil, middle-of-the-road, hyphen-loving student-athlete at
Swarthmore College, steps into the nacho booth and instantly transforms into the plebe of plebes, the lowest common denominator, a hardcore pro wrestling fan.
In a haze of post-modernity, historiography and
hermeneutics, it's easy to lose touch with essential facets of oneself. I consider watching pro wrestling a manner of reconnecting with myself, a part of myself I regard as quite authentic, though long since forsaken for
the sake of acceptance in My So-Called Liberal Arts Life.
Same with football, asking for bloody steak and the occasional objectification of women.
I spend the majority of my life with genuine respect
for women, and suppress most of the urges my id flings at
me. I read a lot. And write a lot of papers. I try not to
swear, and I no longer tell profs to "Stop being a pussy"
when their lectures hit a lull. As such, the WWF is a tremendous catharsis for me. As is its uglier, less popular,
buck-toothed younger brother, Extreme Championship
Wrestling. I actually felt much less at home at WWF than
ECW, whose smaller venues and more mature demographic make the verbal portion of the release far more
satisfying. I felt bad yelling, "Show your tits!" or "Suck
it!" with six-year-old kids sitting within five feet of me.
And, on the ECW scale, those are about 2s.
In addition to my highly latent Neanderthal side, pro
wrestling also reminds me of my childhood, when the day
the music died for me was when The Honky Tonk Man
lost. Though, if that's the case, the music died about twice
a week. Man, he sucked.
In any case, wrestling was among the few happy moments of my traumatic youth, especially in those painful
formative 12 to 14 years. Wrestling, both fake and real,
was the salve for the German suplex off the top ropes that
was middle school dances and trying to figure out how to
ask out Lauren Klapholz (I never did).
So I rambled on. What does wrestling mean to you?
For some, it's just plain entertainment. For some, it's an
NC-17 soap opera. To Frank Martinez, it's an existentialist metaphor. To Scott Kushner, it's a chance to incessantly
jabber about random tag teams who retired ten years ago.
For me, it's a link to sides of myself that have all but faded
into obscurity, Neanderthal, adolescent and not-studying.
Note: No matter what Frank Martinez says, do not believe that he cried he's just saying that to get girls.

ESTER BLOOM

I was swept off my feet this weekend.Rendered completely and utterly breathless. Is this love that I'm feeling? No, not in terms of a knight in shining armor. A
collection of paintings blew me away, actually
the
canvases lining several walls ofa little gallery on swank
Walnut Street in Philadelphia. It wasn't love, but it
was magical. It was Randy Exon's show of his paintings ofIreland.
To comprehensively express the effect these paintings had on me, I must anthropomorphize them. There
was something undeniably alive, intensely real about
them. I don't know
what it was, exactly,
which is part of the
magic. The gallery was
filled with a synergistic
aura. A few paintings,
though, completely
transported me.

others hazy, otherworldly. Beautiful. Truly evocative.
The show's timing couldn't have been better. I've
been going through a little existentialist crisis recently (it's not actually as drastic as that; I tend to
have these somewhat frequently). The hang-up has
been about art and my relationship with it. As an art
history major, much of my day and, well, life is saturated with art. It's this same intensive scrutiny that's
been my problem lately. It's started seeming hollow
and rather pointless. While I was never under any
illusions that my art history degree would help me
directly make the world a better place, I did at one
time believe thatthere was a point. To me, art is about

dialogue between the piece and the viewer. Theorizing seems too far removedfrom the artistic essence. I
had lately started to forget why art enraptures me.
But the show kicked something back in place. I
think Exon's power is in his ability to capture the

essemce of his milieuwhile simultaneously appealing
to something in everyone's soul. Perhaps I sound too

flowery in trying to convey this power. Perhaps this
sounds trite. But it was truly breathtaking.
My favorite painting was of an interior. It's clearly
someone's homebut thelocation is not further dictated.
It depicts a series of doorways, enticing the viewer into
the painting, into this world. The palette is blues and
grays that evoke a tinge of mystery. Still, there's something familiarabout the image. It's that dream-like quality again. Don't get me wrong; it's not like these are
fantastical or surrealist paintings or anything. More
like magic realism, I guess, if I must categorize.
I feel like sticking a label on these works is almost
heretical. In fact, at the opening, as people stood by,
dissecting the interior painting, I had to tell myself that
the formal analysis helped themrelate to the painting.
To me, though, it was misplaced. The paintings don't
need to be intellectualized. Maybe they're 'great art'
on an academic level. But they're more than that.They
reached me on a personal level, touching my soul as
they stole my breath. I remember now how it feels to
be in the presence of magic. I remember now why I
love art.

'slammin'"), and, more importantly, introduces Sarah
'cool'
to her brother, Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas).
Derek is clean-cut, suave, smart and generally adored. Once

Sarah demonstrates how clueless she is, he devotes each afternoon to teaching her hip-hop, which, as the audience learns
along with Sarah, is not only a dance form, but also "an attitude." Accordingly, to fit in, Sarah must adjust everything from
the way she speaks to the way she sits.
Since Sarah, like most teen-movie protagonists, has conveniently little personality to begin with, she transforms herself
with relative ease. Soon she has picked up all the slang and
traded her Gap outfits for large pants, sneakers and braids. In
the process, Sarah and Derek begin a typical, adorable relationship; he even convinces her to try for Julliard again.
While Sarah becomes an expert in these superficialities,
however, she remains oblivious to anything below the surface.
When people confront her with their problems regarding her
relationship, she responds, "Whatever. We like each other."
What else matters? The soundtrackechoes her color-blind philosophy, back-dropping Sarah and Derek's modest love scene

with "I see your true colors/That's why I love you."
There's something almost insidiousabout how this movie
brings up issues and then refuses to deal with them. Sarah
nabs one of the most promising boys in school, stirs up resentment and bitterness on all sides and fails to understand
why it's an issue. By the end, the movie abandons its doubts
and simply shrugs, concurring that love does conquer all.
More interesting than either Sarah's formulaic relationship with Derek (date, kiss, fight, resolve, kiss again) or with
the urban world is Chenille's story. Nearly all teeny-bopper
movies avoid the repercussions of sex like they avoid depth
or intelligence; in this film, Chenille has a baby. It changes
her outlook and adds usually neglected characteristics to the
film.
For the most part, "Save the Last Dance" is fun. The script
is bearable and the acting only intermittently bad. With just
a tad more courage to delve deeper into its subject, it could
have been the first MTV movie worth remembering.

Beats of the streets: a new face in hip-hop?
BY SCOTT KUSHNER
Universal Records has recently been responsible for much of the hip-hop revolution. In 1998, Universal was behind the surfacing of Juvenile and the rest of the Cash
Money clique, which brought southern rap
to the industry forefront. Last year, they
cashed in on Nelly, a then-unknown talent
out of St. Louis. Universal now turns its
attention further north, back to the birthplace of rap, to unveil anotherfresh face and
soundfor the industry. Unfortunately, they
fall well short of greatness with their newest project, Genovese Oin-oh-vee-cee).
Just as Nelly and the Hot Boyz are distinguished by their southern drawl and
unique slang, Genovese's "My America"
relies on the fact that he is the only Italian
rapper to go mainstream. Unfortunately,
Gen's authentic Italiano accent mysteriously disappears sometime between the
opening skit and the first song. The intro
skit honestly sounds just like a scene from
Godfather 11, complete with the phrases
"bust my balls" and "pizzan." I even halfexpected Tony Soprano to make a guest appearance.
As soon as the bass line kicks in, however, a lazy New York accent that sounds
remarkably like Nas on Valium replaces
that of Don Corleone. Whatever happened

to his intriguing accent in those crucial silent moments between tracks turned what
could have been an above-average album
into a very plain and unexciting LP.
In fact, perhaps "above-average" is giving him a bit too much credit for what is a
poor album at best. Everything, from the
redundant and uninspired lyrics to the absolutely horrific hooks, leaves much to be
desired. For some strange reason, Genovese
feels obliged to try to "sing" each chorus
despite apparently still going through pu-

AND "PIZZAN."
berty, his voice often wavering and
cracking when he tries to hold a note.
If there's such a thing as a "hit single"
on the album, it is "My Life," in which

Vese relates the double life he faced during his childhood. As a youngster, he

bounced back and forth from his affluent father in Long Island to his dirt-poor
mother in Yonkers. While his story is
compelling, it loses quite a bit in the rap
lyric translation. Coincidentally, "My
Life" is the only song on the album in
which Genovese does not perform the
hook. Hmmmmmm. As polished as "My
Life" is compared to other tracks on the
album, it will never manage to put

Genovese permanently on the hip-hop

map.

Perhaps the biggest letdown of this
is the group of 15-plus
instrumentals, wasted on a man of such
minimal talent.Smooth blends ofpianos,
horns, drums and keyboards make for
some beats that inspire you, against better judgment, to dance. They even help
mask the fact that you just spent $17.95
on repetitive dribble but not nearly
enough to justify the purchase.

Genovese, Universal Record's
newest face on the rap/hip-hop

scene.

Prior to this album, Genovese had
limited exposure to the public. His

two biggest "claims to fame" were that
he began rapping with his thenschoolmate, Styles (now of The Lox),
and that he appeared on DJ Clue's
mix tapes in 1996. One can't help but
get the sense that Genovese considers his D J Clue experience a life-long

ticket to stardom. "People still re-

member me from Clue's tapes, so I

don'tfeel like a 'new' artist," claims
Gen. Great maybe they'll buy your
album. I'll be GENerous to GENovese

BY ANNA MASILELA
When Josh Loeffler 'O3 and
Chris Loeffler 'O4 step onto an athletic field, they're never stepping
out alone. The brothers stillrecall
their father's coaching tips during
each game and theirextended family still cheers them on from the
sidelines. They can be found on
the basketball court this winter,
but the two McCabe Scholars also
played football for Swarthmore.
"It's a great feeling to be part
of a rebuilding program," said
Chris, "because though there are
losses, you know that you're helping to change things." Such a challenge is uniquely suited to a pair
that has been all about athletics
all their life.
"We always knew we would be
athletes, even thought we weren't
pressed into doing it," said Josh.
"It was always normal in our family, just the kind of thing we did."
With a hoop waiting in the
backyard, the brothers started
handling the ball as soon as they
could walk and dribble at the same
time. When they were in the first
grade, Josh and Chris started playing soccer and baseball in youth

school and he became involved in
their athletic training from an early
age.

"Our coach-player relationship
meant that he could help us out
more when we wanted to improve
and he could push us harder than
he could otherkids," said Josh. "He
expected more out of us and he
knew what we could do. I don't
think I would trade that for anything."

Their father didn't do it alone,
however. Josh and Chris also had
the support of their mother, Jennifer, who was also an athlete, competing in field hockey and track.
"She didn't let us sit around and
watch TV; she would make us go
out and play," said Josh. "She even
pitched to us when we were little."

sisters Morgan and Kaci play volleyball and soccer and are continuing the family tradition of basketball. Harry, of course, is coaching

The Loeffler family is firmly established in West Grove, Pa. The
brothers paint a Rockwellian picture of their neighborhood:
Grandma was a next-door neighbor
on one side and an aunt and uncle
on the other; another uncle and
aunt lived thirty seconds away and
a turn in the road revealed the
house of yet another aunt and
uncle. This is where the brothers'
parents both grew up and where
Chris is considering settling after
he finishes school.
Swarthmore, only an hour
away, was not first on their college
lists. "I saw the school and I
thought all people did was study all
day," said Chris. During his senior
year in high school, he had wanted
to try a large school with new
people, but he's since changed his
mind.He is still considering transferring to another school in order
to have an opportunity to play football, but this time around, it's
small, liberal-arts schools like
Amherst and Williams that top his
list. Josh has decided that he will
stay put. Although both admit that
the small size of Swarthmore limits the social life, the Loefflers
aren't complaining.
"The social life isn't great, but
it's much better than it seems at

BY LANE OATEY
My father once told me that when he's playing tennis,
and he feels like he's starting to wear down, he imagines
his old high school football coach standing to the side of
the court watching him. He said it always gives him the
strength and determination to go on. Let's hope Coach A
comes to my 8:30 and 9:30 classes this year.
Hey there sports fans. Welcome back to this "endless
pit of despair" that we sometimes call Swarthmore College. Personally I prefer to call it "hell," because I'm attracted to the sheer simplicity and power of such image-loaded monosyllabic words. Other people use the
expression "ancient Chinese torture" to describe life
here, and I've heard a few mutter theword "agony" while
shuffling from class to class. But hey, nicknames aside,
I think we can all rest a little easier knowing that someone has recently escaped this place's evil clutches. We
can celebrate that individual's newfound freedom and
try our best not to succumb to the bitterness and shallowness of petty jealousy.
Basically what I'm trying to warm you up for, folks,
is the announcement that Pete Alvanos, former head
coach of the now-defunct Swarthmore football team, is
leaving us this February to take the helm ofHamilton
College's football program. He's taking his show on the
road, heading up into the wasteland that is upstate New
York. After not accepting the head coaching position at
Ursinus, it looks like Coach A has decided to flex his
muscles in the legendary New England Small College
Athletic Conference (NESCAC).
Up north, Division 111 football may be even more pure
than it is in our own Centennial Conference. More of
the NESCAC teams are from highly respected liberal
arts colleges than CC teams. Our partners in crime up
on top of the U.S. News and World Report rankings,
Williams and Amherst, are in NESCAC, as are schools
like Middlebury and Bowdoin. And there's no perennial powerhouse like Western Maryland to contend with.
The boys up in the NESCAC don't usually spend their
summers chucking bales of hay and hauling around 40lb. bags of manure; they spend their summers on the

The PAIAW Conference tournament will be this Saturday at Bryn
Athyn, where Lange and Siobhan

champs. A victory this Saturday would
give them an automatic bid to nation-

Bullets sink Tide swimmers
BY BRANDYN WHITE
On Saturday, Jan. 27, Swarthmore's men's and women's
swim teams traveled to Gettysburg hoping to defeat the Bullets. After a sweeping 207-49 victory over Bryn Mawr on
Jan. 24, the Garnet Tide women set out to sink the Bullet
women, who have not lost a Conference meet since 1981 But
beginning with the 400-yard individual medley (IM) relay,
the Bullets set a painful tone of Gettysburg victory for the
rest of the meet.
Despite losing 131-73, the Swarthmore women swam very
consistent races and maintained a high level of competitive
spirit. The 400 IM relay team of Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol,
Lisa Ladewski 'O2, Alice Bonarou 'O2 and Leah Davis 'O4
posted a time of 4:20.69 to earn a second-place finish. Davis
also placed second in the 50 free (26.07) and fourth in the 100
free (5817).
The Garnet welcomed the return of Bonarou from a semester abroad; she placed second in the 200 breast (2:4013)
and third in the 200 fly (2:23.38). The Swarthmore women
dominated the 200 backstroke event: Howes-Mischel finished first with a time of 2:2121 Alissa Parmelee 'Ol placed
second (2:22.95) and Brandyn White 'O3 finished fourth
(2:24.35).

Despite losing 151-53 to the Bullets, the Garnet Tidesmen
swam consistently throughout the meet. John Lillvis 'O3
swam extraordinary races and was the only male
Swarthmore swimmer to win an event. He won the 200 fly
with a time of 2:02.69 and placed second in the 500 free with
a time of 5:09.39. Lillvis also swam a leg for the second-place
400 free relay team with Chris Bussard 'O3, Ted Sherer 'Ol
and David Whitehead 'O3. Another strong finisher for the
Garnet was Mike Dudley 'O2, who placed second in the 200
IM (2:06.52), second in the 200 back (2:08.65), and third in the
200 breast (2:23.98).
For both the men's and women's teams, the meet was a
hard loss after an exhaustive training trip. "We went up
against the best team in the conference for both the men
and women with the plan that if we swam a bit above ourselves, we could make it a really competitive meet," said
Head Coach Sue Davis. "The reality that reared its ugly head
on Jan. 27 was that I watched a team that was still exhausted
from the rigors of the training trip trying to the best of their
abilities to swim above that exhaustion."
The men's record now stands at 2-2 in the conference and
3-4 overall, while the women are 3-2 in conference competition and 6-2 overall. Swarthmore will host Dickinson at Ware
Pool on Saturday, Feb. 3 at 2 p.m.

So now, after spending three years laboring to turn
the corner in building a successful football program,
Coach A has the difficult task of going in and trying to
rebuild the team at Hamilton. Their record this year
was 2-7, which is far better, as you'll recall, than our
record when he arrived here. Yet despite their promising record, they struggled to put up points. The offense
only managed to score two touchdowns all season.
The rebuilding may take some time. But it only took
him three seasons here at Swarthmore and look where
we finished. This school doesn't even really like sports,
let alone the sport that dominates mainstream American male culture. Most kids here hate any kind ofmainstream male culture, especially when it's not criticized
in a midterm paper and graded by hippies.
I know Coach A will do a great job at Hamilton. Pete
loves his young men, he loves football, and he loves
coaching at top academic schoolsbecause he values the
impact of collegiate athletics on education. He is a man
of character, honor and great integrity.
I'm really happy for the guys at Hamilton. But more
than anything I'm jealous of them.What Swat gave us
was great; what it took away from us was far greater, if
only because of what we put in.
We will always be your men, coach.
And someday, when my punk kid tries to beat me at
tennis, I'll run him ragged in your honor, sir. Just make
sure you bring those icy blue eyes and bulging veins of
yours. And when we're done you can make him hit the
sled for 10 minutes, even though he's a fullback and he
isn't used to hitting the sled at all, let alone hitting it for
10 minutes straight without rest. And you know what?
Maybe he'll find himself out there on the field, like I
did, and maybe he won't forget those lessons, like I won't
forget. And maybe he will be a better man for it, like I
am a better man for it.
Thank you, Coach A, and the best of luck to you and
to your family.

Hype to gripe: Super Blow

Garnet keeps the
lead in the East

Pummel me over the head with a sledgehammer. Gouge my eyes
out with a corkscrew. Crush my testicles in a vice grip. Whatever
you do, whatever torture you subject me to, please do not make me
watch the Ravens play the Giants anymore. Congratulations to the
Ravens for being the champs. Congratulations to the Giants for
keeping it close in the first half. Now please leave the
ummm
NFL spotlight and never return.
Let me be the first to say that I am utterly disgusted that I put
any energy into following the 2000-2001 NFL season. And believe
me, it took quite a bit. Nine months ago, I drafted my first fantasy
football team. Five months ago, I sat in an Internet cafe in Sydney
at 4 a.m. on a Monday morning (due to the 17 hour time difference)
and proceeded to click "Reload" 5000 times over the next five hours
as I watched the scores to this years' first games update on
ESPN.com. (Yes, pathetic, I know. No, really...l'm fully aware). For
the next 17 weeks, I squeezed myself between belligerent Aussies in
a seedy sports bar on Tuesday afternoons to watch Monday Night
Football. Upon my return to the US, I planted myself in front of the
TV during the NFL playoffs despite that the much-loathed Raiders
were advancing, and my beloved 49ers were nowhere to be found. I
was even teetering on giddiness from anticipation for a Super Bowl
which pitted two teams I have about as much vested interest in as I
do in 18th Century Western European fashion. And how does the
NFL repay such a loyal fan? With has-been and never-was quarterbacks leading lethargic offenses? With 36 seconds of Super Bowl
excitement? Two kickoff returns do not a worthwhile Super Bowl
...

make.

By the way, would anyone else like to proclaim the Ravens the
greatest defensive team ever? Or perhaps we should all make sure
to reiterate that QB Trent Dilfer returned to the city that spurned
him to finally win a championship. Don't get me wrong, Baltimore's
D is scarier than Muhammed Ali performing a circumcision, but
just like last year's "Greatest Show on Earth," the Neverscore Defense will not be able to carry their Neverscore offensive counter-

part another season.
Perhaps the biggest travesty of the Super Bowl is that somebody
besides Kerry Collins was named MVP. No single player contributed more to the Ravens' victory than Collins. After a stellar NFC
Championship game against a listless Viking "defense," Collins was
compared to ex-Giant great Phil Simms. Following Sunday's performance, he will forever be compared to P.J. Carlisimo. Sorry
Bartner, but it looks like JimFassel has rediscovered the infamous
"interception button" as Collins, with uncanny precision, was able
to pick apart the Giants' offense and threadthe proverbial needle to
find awaiting Baltimore defenders. His 49-yard touchdown strike to
Ravens DB Duane Starks was poetry in motion. Sunday, Kerry
Collins proved that he is truly a man of superior physical ability,
unmatched cranial fortitude, and a role model for recovering alcoholics with aspirations of failing on a grand scale. I'll drink to that.
How bad was this Super Bowl? Well, let's examine the three things
you expect to see at the Super Bowl. 1) the launching of advertising
genius' most recent progeny, 2) the hottest music acts, and 3) the
most exciting football game of the season. Aside from Bob Dole

shamelessly parlaying his impotence into a Pepsi ad, the commercials
left much to be desired. Speaking of Pepsi, they must have
L
dropped about $2O million on their Super Bowl spots. If they would
just spend half that much on making a product that didn'ttaste like
carbonated molasses, I'd think of actually buying some. Then, the
five most obnoxious "men" on the planet, the Backstreet Boys, performed the National Anthem. The halftime show saw Aerosmith
sing their 1998 (yes, 3 years old) hit, "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,"
just before teaming up with the next five most obnoxious "men": 'NSync. No boy-band animosity. No argument over which group's 15
minutes will run out first. No brawl over who gets to fondle Britney
after the game.
Finally, the game. 21 punts!?! That's not football...that's soccer.
Then there's the MVP, Ray Lewis, who finished with seven lousy
tackles and a couple pass deflections/dropped interceptions. No
sacks. No picks. No forced fumbles. No tackles for a loss. No criminal activity. Hell, not even a lousy misdemeanor. This is the one
sacred day of the year that men can be men and their girlfriends
won't bitch and moan when you slap them on the ass and tell them
to fetch you a beer. So what are we fed as our unleavened bread on
this annual Sabbath? Crap commercials, teeny boppers and a kicking contest. What a jip.

What?! What?! Women's basketball, that's what. A record-breaking season, that's what. The Swarthmore
women's team garnered a little more attention from the world at large on Saturday, Jan. 27, when they traveled
to Gettysburg, Pa., and duplicated the ferocity of the famous historic battle, making the Lady Bullets bite theirs.
With an overtime victory of 71-65, the Garnet righted a wrong by dethroning the regionally ranked Gettysburg
in their own palace.
Three days later, the Garnet sealed their first-place standing in the conference with a barnburner win against
Washington College, 56-55. The team is currently 16-2 overall and 8-1 in the conference.
The Swarthmore women abided by the mantra of their favorite male assistant basketball coach, DougRouse,
by owning "the first five minutes of each half." At the Gettysburg game, they came out gunning, but the shots
weren't falling. The women bricked their way to a measly 30 percent from the field, only to rectify that display in
the second half, finishing with 40 percent from the field. Missing shots meant that the women would have to pick
things up on the defensive end, and that they did, forcing the Bullets to 20 turnovers and only 27 percent shooting from the field for the game. Despite playing an uncharacteristically fast-paced first half, the Tide went into
the locker room with a two-point lead. With a renewed commitment to finishing shots, and a dogged determination to show the conference exactly who the best defensive team is, an amazing team effort led to a three-point
lead with mere seconds remaining on the clock.
The Garnettes were ready to walk off the floor with a victory in hand when Gettysburg quickly inbounded
the ball, passed up court, and flung up a "Hail Mary." A silent crowd gave way to eruptive screams and applause
as they watched the ball sail through the net as the buzzer signaled what should have been the end of the game.
For a momentarily stunned Swarthmore team, it signaled the beginning of an overtime period that they were to
dominate 15-9. No one expected the Garnet Tide to defeat a strong Lady Bullets squad, but belief in their abilities
and in each other was all these ladies would need that day in the Battle of Gettysburg, Part 11.
Heather Kile 'O2 led all scorers with 24 points and 11 rebounds. While Swarthmore was not shooting well
inside the arc, they faired better from behind the line with a little help from Ali Furman 'O3, who finished with
